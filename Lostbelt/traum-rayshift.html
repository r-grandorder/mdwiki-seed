It&#39;s a fine topic, but isn&#39;t the subject matter a little too vague?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> First, we need to discuss what we define as “perfection”.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> True enough. Then, how about this:</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> “A perfect human is one who never errs.”</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Rather than overcoming hardships or making the impossible possible,</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> what if we define perfection as... a “lack of error in a person&#39;s judgment”?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Oh, that would make matters much simpler.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> No matter how much of a genius or a superhuman one may be, errors in judgment are bound to occur.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> On the other hand, even if minor mistakes and oversights were to occur,</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> a person of outstanding aptitude can compensate for those, while being able to resolve the issue at hand.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> However, you could hardly consider such a thing to be the “perfect choice”.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Therefore, perfection refers to a “state without error”.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Even for the average Joe, as long as the decisions they make are consistently optimal,</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> then you could say those are the perfect actions of a perfect human.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Hmm. In other words, “a perfect human makes no oversights”.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> So a person ceases to be perfect the instant such an oversight is made... Is that what you mean to say, Sion?</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> I guess so.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> See, the unfortunate thing about an exam-style evaluation is that one honest mistake is all it takes to lose that perfect 100% score.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> But, if I were to put it like you just did, Da Vinci, the opposite also applies.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Or, “there exists a perfect problem for which even the perfect human will make an oversight.”</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> If a problem capable of fooling even an unerring, perfect human exists, that is.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Oh, but then consider this case:</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> The mistake is not necessarily a mistake at all. The person purposefully overlooked the problem.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> A “perfect human”, precisely due to their perfection, willfully ignored the problem.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> For that is a problem that ought not to be solved. Therefore,</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> the very fact that they overlooked the problem is in and of itself proof of “a perfect decision, a perfect choice”...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Something like that? That might be leaning too hard on the semantics, though.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> —.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> That&#39;s enough chit-chat. Our vessel is due to depart the Arctic Circle.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Since our Technical Advisor and Special Advisor are present...</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Why not give us a routine status update? It is your duty to report even the known facts.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Totally my fault. I did originally come here to report to you, Captain.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Now then, I&#39;d like to go over what Novum Chaldea&#39;s been through so far, and what the future holds for us.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> A few days after the annihilation of the British Lostbelt,</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> right after we brokered peace with the Larval Beast, Koyanskaya,</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> we lost the Wandering Sea, our temporary lodgings, due to an incursion by the Alien God.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> The staff of Novum Chaldea made an emergency escape on the Storm Border.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> We befuddled the Alien God—U-Olga Marie—by directing the gravitational collapse of the Wandering Sea right back at her...</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Well... I&#39;d like to at least think it was effective based on the fact that she didn&#39;t pursue us...</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Her abilities and personality are far too unorthodox for me to draw any sort of normal conclusion.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> In any case,</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> we loaded the mainframes of the Spiritron Calculation Engine TRISMEGISTUS II and the Near-Future Observation Lens SHEBA on board the Storm,</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> and so, with our base in the skyborne ship, the Storm Border, Chaldea has turned over a new leaf.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> The adventure resumed, following that.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Having made our escape from U-Olga Marie, we made our way towards safety by relying on TRISMEGISTUS II&#39;s future forecasts.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Which brings us to the present, still cruising, in spite of the troubles that befell us en route to our destination.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Yep. We zipped here and there across the Eurasian continent,</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> occasionally making landfall to convert the remaining buildings into spiritrons to replenish our resources.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> In the end, we ended up hiding away for a while in the Arctic Circle though...</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> That was quite the chilling experience. The ship wasn&#39;t designed for cold climates.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Ah, so you were cold after all, Captain. Sorry, sorry. But please do bear with me.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> It&#39;s because the TRISMEGISTUS II proposed the Arctic Circle as “the safest place to be”.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> I know that. As a matter of fact, the Alien God has yet to attack us.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> But that&#39;s only until yesterday, Captain.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> We&#39;re pretty much done with the weaponization of the Holy Sword essence we acquired in the British Lostbelt.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Now all that&#39;s left is to complete the required number of simulated test runs.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Commander Gordolf, Administrative Advisor Holmes, and myself as Technical Advisor.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> We all left the Arctic Circle with the consent of Chaldea&#39;s staff.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Our destination is the site of the final battle: South America, where the Alien God is located.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> We&#39;re finally en route to the final Lostbelt via North America.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Oh, we also took a look at the official name of the Holy Sword Armament earlier. It&#39;s a name that the Nemo Series, myself included, have no complaints about.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> I know, right? Although, I do think it&#39;s a little over the top!</p><p><strong>Announcement:</strong><br> Abnormal conditions observed. Abnormal conditions observed.</p><p><strong>Announcement:</strong><br> Both TRISMEGISTUS II&#39;s future forecasts and SHEBA&#39;s near-future observations are returning errors.</p><p><strong>Announcement:</strong><br> An obstacle not accounted for in Novum Chaldea&#39;s anti-Alien God protocol has been detected.</p><p><strong>Announcement:</strong><br> —Detecting decline in the attestation values for Pan-Human History of the bleached Earth.</p><p><strong>Announcement:</strong><br> Risk of transience upon the present due to interference with the past has been confirmed.</p><p><strong>Announcement:</strong><br> Chaldea staff are requested to urgently initiate the Rayshift execution sequence.</p><p><strong>Announcement:</strong><br> According to SHEBA&#39;s observations, this is one of the “largest direct attacks on Pan-Human History” ever made.</p><p><strong>Announcement:</strong><br> It is a large-scale Singularity.</p><h2 id="section-1-the-coffinmaker-is-my-only-friend" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1-the-coffinmaker-is-my-only-friend" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 1: The Coffinmaker is My Only Friend</h2><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> —A soliloquy.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> ■■■■■■ cannot comprehend ■■■■■.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> They cannot discern whether dead or alive, standing or sitting,</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> whether thoughtful or thoughtless, begging alms or offering prayers.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> They know not a thing.

Or perhaps it would better be called competence?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> My sins, my fate, my obligations. The day to put an end to them will arrive at last.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Here, beneath the falls we named Reichenbach.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Now, I&#39;ll start the briefing by addressing the large-scale Singularity.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Its date is unstable, but it is no later than 1700 AD. However, there may be a deviation of at least 100 years.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> The location is undetermined, but judging by the observed vegetation, the Far East, Africa, and Europe are off the table.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> We presume it&#39;s in what was previously North America.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> It lacks the magical energy density levels seen in the Age of Gods, but there have been extremely large disturbances in the observed values.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Ripples of magical energy are generated incessantly, like a pond beaten by rain.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> It has me wondering if someone over there is wildly throwing around Anti-Army Noble Phantasms.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Furthermore, its Human Order Foundation Value is “ERROR”.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Why ERROR...? Aren&#39;t immeasurable values designated with the rank EX?</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Because this one isn&#39;t even immeasurable.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> We&#39;ve never seen a case like this before.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Under normal circumstances, we&#39;d have marked the smallest microsingularity as E-.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> After all, there&#39;s no need to take note of anything smaller than that. We wouldn&#39;t even consider that a Singularity.</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> Is there some kind of bug in the system?</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> If only...</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> We&#39;ll be monitoring the Foundation Value alongside observing you.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> In any event, we lack answers for pretty much everything right now.</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> I see, things are mostly unknown... which means–</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> We&#39;ve got to find out first-hand.</p><hr><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> Those are the words of someone who never plans ahead, but yes, you&#39;re right...</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Fortunately, Mr. Holmes is one of the compatible Servants for this Rayshift.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> We want you to bring the truth of the matter straight into the light! You can do that, can&#39;t you?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> It&#39;s a mountain of a task, but I&#39;ll move it. Probing into the truth is exactly what we detectives do for a living.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> It&#39;s all barits-up to you.</p><hr><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Hahaha, is that your idea of a salutation?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Is that all for the Singularity? Then, it&#39;s my turn to explain.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> We&#39;ll have one more Servant accompanying you this time. Unfortunately, it won&#39;t be Mash.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That&#39;s right.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Maintenance on the Ortenaus hasn&#39;t finished yet...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> As technical advisor, I can&#39;t allow her to Rayshift before maintenance is complete.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> She remained tenacious through fierce battles across the Fairy Kingdom and Tunguska, all without rest. Her Saint Graph may have drifted out of sync a bit.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Foufou. Foou, fou!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I guess he&#39;s not coming with us this time either...</p><hr><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Well, the plan is to Rayshift her to you as reinforcements once everything is good-to-go.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> And so, instead, your additional partner is—</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> There is no need for suspense in the matter. It is I.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Lord Vlad!</p><hr><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Indeed. It is a great role, but I will accept it most humbly.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> There were several other compatible Servants aside from Lord Vlad...</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> But three units are the limit for this Rayshift. Two, if we send Mash as rear guard.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> And since Holmes is committed, we only have one spot open.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> It was successfully resolved through peaceful discussion, and with hardly any bloodshed.</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> (So, they resolved it with a fight to the death?)</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> This Singularity is packed with mysteries, Master, but do not lose sight of the objective.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Excessive empathy for one&#39;s adversaries tends to lead to foolish turns.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Although... it may be too late to say such things. For you are the Master, and should do as you please.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Very well, I shall be on standby in spirit form. Call upon me if you need me.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Quite dependable.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Finally, there&#39;s one more special guest for the Rayshift.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Another...?</p><hr><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> That&#39;s right.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> If we have two Masters, our operational scope will expand.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Sion! Do you mean...?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Kadoc!?</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Yes, bullseye.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Well then, Kadoc, please report to the deck with as much enthusiasm as you can muster.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> New Director...!?</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> I-It&#39;s my turn...? No, thanks! I&#39;m still commander here!</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> That might be something we can work on, but let&#39;s leave it at that for the time being.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Our second Master is right here.</p><hr><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Yeah, gotcha. I&#39;m Kadoc Zemlupus, former Master of the A Team.</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> Kadoc!? Hold on, aren&#39;t you still a Crypter!?</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> I am, but my Lostbelt has disappeared.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> So has Olympus, which was to be our refuge.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> In other words, my only option was surrender. Obviously, I don&#39;t expect you to take my word for it.</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong></p><h1 id="i-don-t-believe-this-nonsense" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#i-don-t-believe-this-nonsense" aria-hidden="true">#</a> I don&#39;t believe this nonsense!</h1><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> You&#39;re free not to. I will have to prove it through my actions.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> What&#39;s with the collar...?</p><hr><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Good catch, Fujimaru. Sion, give them the rundown.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Right, right. What we have here is the Atlas Institute&#39;s hand-crafted magus-killer collar.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> If he takes any suspicious action while we&#39;re monitoring...</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> The collar&#39;s function activates, completely destroying his magic circuits.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> The same applies if he tries to force its removal. It isn&#39;t necessarily meant to kill by design...</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> But the intentional disruption of magic circuits caused by this collar would most definitely result in death.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Oh, and be aware that unauthorized use of magecraft will also trigger the collar.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> No mincing words on my account, honestly. But that&#39;s it in a nutshell.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> So... Kadoc.</p><hr><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Yeah.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Good to be working together!</p><hr><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Okay... first thing&#39;s first.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> As a magus, don&#39;t go flashing your hands around carelessly. They reveal too much information.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> As a Master, you should know how important the hand housing your Command Spells is.</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> ... ...</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> (Those grim magus-like words help remind me that I too am a magus.)</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> When it comes to Fujimaru,</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> having the aptitude for being a Master didn&#39;t automatically make [♂ him /♀️ her] a magus...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> So maybe you can instruct [♂ him /♀️ her] little by little in that area, Kadoc Zemlupus?</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Fine by me.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> ... ...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> (Miss Sion, regarding the Sirius Light—)</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> (It couldn&#39;t be removed. Please put it aside for now.)</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> (Understood.)</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> (If the Alien God could remotely activate the Sirius Light, they would have done so by now.)</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> (Being overly anxious would be ill-advised.)</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> (True. It&#39;s still a Command Spell, however huge the scale...)</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> (Our collar is sure to activate before it can be triggered.)</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> (We should try to avoid that, though, if at all possible.)</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> I&#39;m done with my end of the briefing, Sion. Is there anything else?</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Yes, one last thing.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> There are keywords for the Singularity divined by hieroglyphic prediction.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> “No problem. Rebellion. Eyelids.”</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> What does that even mean?</p><hr><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> I&#39;m just as confounded as you are.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> The facts are as we see them:</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> “This Singularity can not be overlooked, and is on the same scale as the seven Singularities previous.”</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> That&#39;s the short of it.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Even though it does put us at a standstill in regards to our approaching the seventh Lostbelt.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Annihilate the large-scale Singularity at any cost. Stand by for Rayshift!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Roger that!</p><hr><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Whatever the era, whatever the place, whatever the ideology...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Nothing is more difficult to succeed in than war.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Die. Die, die, die.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> There is nothing but artless death there. Neither race, gender, nor age factor into it.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> There are those who get by on their skill, effort, and luck. Even they meet an anticlimactic end in the face of death.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> In death, living things become a mere lump of flesh, that is the natural order. Be that as it may, with Servants, this fails to occur.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> When they die, they fade away. There&#39;s no sign of having been there. No record of their presence.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Death so abrupt it confounds the mind.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Whether they are heroes who saved their homeland, or anti-heroes that brought them to ruin...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> They nonetheless die as though it were only natural, for whatever the reason.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> War never changes. No matter how much time passes, nor how civilization develops.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Killing one another is simply the final step of any negotiations.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> These heroes have but one goal—to rebel.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Not against a king, not against God, not even against the world.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> It is a rebellion against Pan-Human History.</p><p><strong>P：???:</strong><br> Do you even understand why you were summoned?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>The castle was unbearable, even for the veteran heroes summoned as Servants.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>In this castle stood crimson brilliance and darkest insanity. Any man less than a hero would fall to madness.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>The beauty before them was the embodiment of that insanity.</p><p><strong>Saber Class:</strong><br> No, Queen Kriemhild, I know nothing of what—</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Her name is Kriemhild.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> In the Nibelungenlied, she was a princess who vowed revenge for the murder of her husband, Siegfried.</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> Deserting in the face of the enemy.</p><p><strong>Saber Class:</strong><br> ...!</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> Overlooking the enemy.</p><p><strong>Archer Class:</strong><br> !</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> Disrupting the battlefield by over-extending pursuit.</p><p><strong>Rider Class:</strong><br> ... ...</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> Speak.</p><p><strong>Saber Class:</strong><br> My retreat was due to Rider&#39;s disruption. If I&#39;d held my ground, death was likely.</p><p><strong>Archer Class:</strong><br> That was no enemy. It was just a child.</p><p><strong>Rider Class:</strong><br> I am to blame. I rightfully accept my punishment.</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> ... Good.</p><p><strong>Rider Class:</strong><br> ...!</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> However certain death was, holding your ground would not have been a meaningless end for your men.</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> You deserve execution.</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> There are no children on the battlefield. Any that were would be Servants.</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> If you cannot fathom such logic, then you deserve execution.</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> And with that—</p><p><strong>Rider Class:</strong><br> Wh...y...</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> You must have thought that acting obedient would save you in spite of this demeanor of mine.</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> Very shrewd, and clever. You are unnecessary.</p><p><strong>Rider Class:</strong><br> Damn you...you&#39;re...just a...crazed...vengeful...demon...</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> What now?</p><p><strong>Q：???:</strong><br> Well, well... Yet another gaudy mess strewn about.</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> One for which cleaning is not your duty, Zhang Jiao.</p><p><strong>Zhang Jiao:</strong><br> And precisely what my puppet soldiers are for. Go, see to it.</p><p><strong>Zhang Jiao:</strong><br> How goes the front line?</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> Stalemate as always. That insufferable man is nothing if not defensive.</p><p><strong>Zhang Jiao:</strong><br> That&#39;s only to be expected from a hero who became known for such a thing ...Ah, pardon me.</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> And how fares your end?</p><p><strong>Zhang Jiao:</strong><br> I am mobilizing everything from my puppet knowledge and the Taiping Yaoshu, but it can&#39;t be done overnight.</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> We will grant you the time and the materials. However, failure is not an option.</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> Otherwise, even you will have to be beheaded.</p><p><strong>Zhang Jiao:</strong><br> Well, well. Then let me put you at ease, with all my devotion.</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> Hmm... That will do. Are there new Servants?</p><p><strong>Zhang Jiao:</strong><br> It seems more have been summoned into the ranks. Though this time it felt like more had gone to the other factions.</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> Hmph... Has the Via Regia Realm moved?</p><p><strong>Zhang Jiao:</strong><br> Not as of yet. My men haven&#39;t been taking any action beyond scouting.</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> Yes. I suppose their plan is to attack when the other two sides are mutually occupied.</p><p><strong>Zhang Jiao:</strong><br> They haven&#39;t enough numbers to charge in for an ambush, but just enough that they&#39;re still a threat.</p><p><strong>Zhang Jiao:</strong><br> Such a humiliating position to be in.</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> With the result being this insufferable stalemate.</p><p><strong>Zhang Jiao:</strong><br> Yes, indeed...</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> Have the Assassins maintain due vigilance.</p><p><strong>Zhang Jiao:</strong><br> I shall.</p><p><strong>Zhang Jiao:</strong><br> One last thing, your star of fate has just now taken a shine.</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> Star of fate...?</p><p><strong>Zhang Jiao:</strong><br> The one coming who will bring important changes to this Singularity. I speak of—</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> Yes... Coming, they&#39;re coming. They&#39;ve already come.</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> Oh, what am I to do? I don&#39;t know where to start.</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> How exactly can I bring them suffering? How exactly can I bring them misery?</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> Beheadings go without saying, but I&#39;ve yet to tire of superficial punishments.</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> As though some mage out of the rabble could command those such as us.</p><p><strong>Zhang Jiao:</strong><br> Oh, oh. Calm yourself, my queen. It&#39;s the rule in polite society to be courteous with prisoners of war, for a time.</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> I don&#39;t care, I don&#39;t care, I don&#39;t care a bit.</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> Very well...</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> Keep on guard until we confirm where [♂ he /♀️ she] is.</p><p><strong>Zhang Jiao:</strong><br> Although, we are rather lacking in spies.</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> Call back some of the Assassins engaged in scouting duties against the Via Regia Realm.</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> Have them keep watch for Chaldea for the time being.</p><p><strong>Zhang Jiao:</strong><br> Understood.</p><p><strong>R：???:</strong><br> Hey, have you finished talking?</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> How very unusual of you to come out of your torture chamber, Salome...</p><p><strong>Salome:</strong><br> Torture? I don&#39;t even know what that is.</p><p><strong>Salome:</strong><br> All I want is somebody&#39;s head.</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> Fair enough... So, what brings you here?</p><p><strong>Salome:</strong><br> What&#39;s this Chaldea?</p><p><strong>Zhang Jiao:</strong><br> Ho-ho-ho. Well, if I had to put it in one word—</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> Enemies. Nothing more, nothing less.</p><p><strong>Salome:</strong><br> You&#39;ll fight them?</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> I&#39;ll kill them.</p><p><strong>Salome:</strong><br> I see...</p><p><strong>Salome:</strong><br> But if one has a lovely enough head, would you save it for me?</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> I&#39;ll consider it... There&#39;s no telling one way or the other.</p><p><strong>Salome:</strong><br> Really? That&#39;s too bad.</p><p><strong>Salome:</strong><br> Well, I&#39;ll be going out. Shall I get you something?</p><p><strong>Salome:</strong><br> Umm, maybe sachertorte cake. Doesn&#39;t that sound delicious?</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> No, thank you...</p><p><strong>Salome:</strong><br> Okay. See you later.</p><p><strong>Zhang Jiao:</strong><br> Is it really fine to let that one indulge herself so much?</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> She is an anti-hero in touch with her own nature. Denying it outright won&#39;t bring any gain.</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> If she can fight, that makes her strong, so let her play around accordingly.</p><p><strong>Zhang Jiao:</strong><br> As you wish.</p><p><strong>Caster Class:</strong><br> Master Zhang Jiao, preparations for the experiment are complete.</p><p><strong>Zhang Jiao:</strong><br> Splendid, I&#39;ll be right there. And with that, my queen, I must take my leave.</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> Insufferable, insufferable...</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> Chaldea, der Große, and the Emperor. I hate each and every one of them.</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> It&#39;s that hero who&#39;s to blame for all this. If he isn&#39;t summoned soon, I&#39;m going to break down.</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> Hurry, hurry, hurry...</p><p><strong>Lancer Class:</strong><br> That is all I have to report!</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Thank you. You may withdraw.</p><p><strong>Lancer Class:</strong><br> Yes, O Emperor!</p><p><strong>I：???:</strong><br> ... More heroes have lost their lives...</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Do not mourn, Your Holiness. Your sorrow is proper, but misplaced.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> I would give my life for you. We are all fighting with that resolve.</p><p><strong>I：???:</strong><br> But I—I don&#39;t think I&#39;m someone worthy of all that...</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> One&#39;s worth is determined not just by themselves, but by others.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> However much you may deny it, however much you scorn or blame yourself for this dream-like children&#39;s story.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> You have our love and respect, heavy though they must be.</p><p><strong>I：???:</strong><br> Yes. Truthfully, it&#39;s too heavy a burden!</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Hahaha, you&#39;re quite a strict one.</p><p><strong>I：???:</strong><br> Would that I could meet my death with such laughter and contentment.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> I will not let you walk the path of death, Your Holiness.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Such is our pledge, and my belief.</p><p><strong>I：???:</strong><br> I just told you that it&#39;s too heavy!</p><p><strong>I：???:</strong><br> But that will do. It will have to do. We do what we must, to the bitter end.</p><p><strong>I：???:</strong><br> But can I say one thing about this, Your Emperorship?</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> What is it?</p><p><strong>I：???:</strong><br> All the barbaric atrocities and merciless cruelties performed in my name.</p><p><strong>I：???:</strong><br> Are they committed not because we are on the brink of death, but because it is what you want?</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> That is a difficult question...</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> If it should be that you cannot face this...</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> You&#39;re right. It&#39;s not so significant a price, but I will sacrifice myself to save you.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> The life of an emperor in exile must be worth that much.</p><p><strong>I：???:</strong><br> I—No, I&#39;ll explain.</p><p><strong>I：???:</strong><br> I only sought to test my worth to you as a pretense, if only a little.</p><p><strong>I：???:</strong><br> No, far more than a little.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Is that how you interpret the voice of the Lord?</p><p><strong>I：???:</strong><br> I cannot say.</p><p><strong>I：???:</strong><br> After all, God&#39;s messages can be complicated at times.</p><p><strong>I：???:</strong><br> I should hope incomprehensible for one so disrespectful as myself.</p><p><strong>I：???:</strong><br> Although, there is always the option that I—</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Please, Your Holiness, not another word. Otherwise, you stray into restlessness and blasphemy.</p><p><strong>I：???:</strong><br> Well, how rude. I have always made sure to mind my manners!</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Is that so...?</p><p><strong>I：???:</strong><br> Now then.</p><p><strong>I：???:</strong><br> As always, I am heading out to worship.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Sure, go ahead.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> I will be late to join you, since I have to strategize with my men.</p><p><strong>I：???:</strong><br> All right! And if I may add one more thing?</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Hmm?</p><p><strong>I：???:</strong><br> The intrigues.</p><p><strong>I：???:</strong><br> Take care not to overdo it with them, or you&#39;ll spoil your looks!</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> ... This spells trouble.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> I take it her receiving the title of Pope is more significant than apparent.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> —But you know, my dear? I still have a few intrigues to work through you.</p><p><strong>Saber Class:</strong><br> Your Lordship, I am reporting in.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Right. Let&#39;s hear your reports.</p><p><strong>Saber Class:</strong><br> At once.</p><p><strong>Saber Class:</strong><br> A medium-sized force invaded from the Revenge Realm three hours ago, moving to take the Trigonion Tower.</p><p><strong>Saber Class:</strong><br> The thirty Archer classes assigned to stand by repelled the attack with a simultaneous barrage of their Noble Phantasms.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Right, that means I read the situation correctly.</p><p><strong>Saber Class:</strong><br> Yes, Lordship.</p><p><strong>Saber Class:</strong><br> However, ten Servants who attempted pursuit during the retreat were crushed in turn.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> I gave orders to maintain defensive position and not pursue...</p><p><strong>Saber Class:</strong><br> Yes.</p><p><strong>Saber Class:</strong><br> There were some lapses in the Rider, Berserker, and Lancer classes.</p><p><strong>Saber Class:</strong><br> They said they wanted to press the advantage. Now...</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Are you one of the Servants in such a hurry to seize the day?</p><p><strong>Rider Class:</strong><br> I...I&#39;m truly...truly sorry...</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> ... ...Do you feel any remorse?</p><p><strong>Rider Class:</strong><br> Y-yes, O Emperor!</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Do you think that you will be granted mercy?</p><p><strong>Rider Class:</strong><br> I mean...um...I mean...</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> —Heh.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> No, forgive me for intimidating you. It&#39;s a general&#39;s instinct to charge out seeking glory.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> It must be difficult for a warrior to suppress that.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> You are pardoned. The rest of you shouldn&#39;t judge that harshly.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Needless to say, it is your domain to bestow honors where fit.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Provided, of course, such charges succeed.</p><p><strong>Saber Class:</strong><br> Yes, Your Lordship...!</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Very good. Next item.</p><p><strong>Archer Class:</strong><br> A brawl between these two Servants.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Brawling among Servants is a no-no. Especially in our realm.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Therefore, both of you need to be punished. In the next battle, your orders are to back up the rearguard.</p><p><strong>Archer Class:</strong><br> Go on, you&#39;ve been judged. Don&#39;t dawdle.</p><p><strong>Caster Class:</strong><br> That leaves me last.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Well, to think our local honor student has committed an offence.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> What offence could one who had marched alongside the one and only Alexander the Great be guilty of?</p><p><strong>Caster Class:</strong><br> I have—</p><p><strong>Caster Class:</strong><br> Gah...hah...!</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> —No. That&#39;s the one thing in this realm that I forbid.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> We do not acknowledge Pan-Human History. We acknowledge nothing but rebellion.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> That goes for cooperation and mercy as well.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> I thought you realized as much when you came over to this side of things.</p><p><strong>Caster Class:</strong><br> But...we...are...</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Heroes, true.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> We are beings who defied the flow of history, who were swallowed up, and some even erased.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> The bonds shackling us to defend the Human Order have long disappeared, and I—</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> I simply must make Pan-Human History pay. Though that grudge may be completely personal, I suppose.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> This realm is a gathering place for such people. Your summoning here must have caused a bit of a distortion.</p><p><strong>Caster Class:</strong><br> It&#39;s you people...who are twisted...</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> —That may be. But I will not stop.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> ... ...</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> I&#39;m going to worship. Begone from my sight.</p><p><strong>Saber Class:</strong><br> Right away!</p><p><strong>I：???:</strong><br> —I am not in error. —I am not mistaken.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>At first, her prayers were not for herself, but only for others.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>Prayers for something. Prayers for someone.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>That was proper, since one can justify their position by way of devotion.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>Even so, this prayer is only for herself.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>Her sin is no sin. Her atonement is no atonement.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>And yet, that contradiction is only the result of devotion that comes to fruition here.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>A contradiction driving her into inescapable torment.</p><p><strong>I：???:</strong><br> —Please deliver me salvation.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>She simply murmured a wish for which she did not even know towards whom it should be directed.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> I&#39;m sorry to have kept you.</p><p><strong>I：???:</strong><br> No... that&#39;s all right. I had just started my prayers.</p><p><strong>I：???:</strong><br> ... ...</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> What&#39;s the matter?</p><p><strong>I：???:</strong><br> Nothing at all... Come, let&#39;s resume and give prayer on your behalf.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> No matter how much blood stains your hands, I hope I can shoulder some of your sin&#39;s burdens.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I&#39;m sorry. I&#39;m sorry. I&#39;m sorry. Even then, I...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I have nothing more to offer.</p><p><strong>Lancer Class:</strong><br> End of report.</p><p><strong>Lancer Class:</strong><br> The analysis from the Casters is that the other two realms withdrew after bloodying each other&#39;s noses.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Hmm, stopping short at skirmishes. As always, they&#39;re being wary of us.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> How&#39;s it look for you, Roland?</p><p><strong>Roland:</strong><br> Nothing we don&#39;t already know...</p><p><strong>Roland:</strong><br> Our force is the smallest, but the quality of our troops is anything but inferior.</p><p><strong>Roland:</strong><br> If we put our backs into it, we can hold off anyone at any time.</p><p><strong>Saber Class:</strong><br> Most of all, this realm—it&#39;s home to our great king, Karl der Große.</p><p><strong>Lancer Class:</strong><br> Right, Kriemhild and Constantine are nothing compared to us!</p><p><strong>Archer Class:</strong><br> We have no true king but our great king, Karl der Große!</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> So say they, Your Majesty!</p><p><strong>A: ??? :</strong><br> Hm...</p><p><strong>D：???:</strong><br> Neither the princess warped by revenge, nor the emperor who failed to protect his country...</p><p><strong>D：???:</strong><br> ...are any match for us. These are the words of Karl der Große.</p><p><strong>Saber Class:</strong><br> Yeah, just like we said...!</p><p><strong>A: ??? :</strong><br> Hm...</p><p><strong>D：???:</strong><br> We are always the last to take action. A king should never move carelessly.</p><p><strong>D：???:</strong><br> Our Assassins must double their efforts. All of you are encouraged to keep up your training, he says.</p><p><strong>Archer Class:</strong><br> Yes, as you command!</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Your Majesty, Roland and me are up next.</p><p><strong>A：???:</strong><br> Mhm.</p><p><strong>A：???:</strong><br> Roland, I leave it in your capable hands.</p><p><strong>Roland:</strong><br> I&#39;m honored, my lord. Right, let&#39;s move out!</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Roland. Don&#39;t forget to pack your sense of reason, &#39;kay?</p><p><strong>Roland:</strong><br> Isn&#39;t that YOUR major malfunction!?</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> ...Ahem.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> So, how&#39;s it going?</p><p><strong>D：???:</strong><br> It&#39;s good to live to fight another day. I&#39;m breathing a sigh of relief.</p><p><strong>D：???:</strong><br> Our good sir did a fine job as well.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Even though I&#39;m doing nothing but grunting out hums and mm-hmms!?</p><p><strong>D：???:</strong><br> That&#39;s more than enough. A hundred words can be worth less than one said out of folly.</p><p><strong>D：???:</strong><br> Truth be told, it&#39;s no good how the kingly aura no longer embaldens—emboldens once you speak.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Did you just make some wisecrack about the crown of my head?</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> You&#39;re just paranoid!</p><p><strong>A：???:</strong><br> Is that a fact...?</p><p><strong>D：???:</strong><br> Let&#39;s put that aside. The enemy scouts are penetrating deeper than ever.</p><p><strong>D：???:</strong><br> Sure enough, this charade won&#39;t hold up much longer...</p><p><strong>D：???:</strong><br> The venerated Karl der Große simply hasn&#39;t shown at all...</p><p><strong>D：???:</strong><br> He&#39;s suffered some kind of wound, or something more serious.</p><p><strong>D：???:</strong><br> It&#39;s natural to come to that conclusion.</p><p><strong>A：???:</strong><br> But if I bucked up and stepped into his shoes...</p><p><strong>D：???:</strong><br> The axe would fall on your neck, without a word.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Hah hah hah, that&#39;s a real pickle!</p><p><strong>D：???:</strong><br> It&#39;s nothing to laugh about.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Uh, you don&#39;t think so?</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> What we basically need is an event to distract from suspicions about His Majesty.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Like, say—if a fourth faction were on its way.</p><p><strong>D：???:</strong><br> ...!</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Just a hunch though! I don&#39;t know where I got that from.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> It&#39;s high time we turned things around.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Let&#39;s make sure we have plenty of scouts ready to take advantage of this opportunity!</p><p><strong>D：???:</strong><br> I suppose it&#39;s sound to have faith in your hunches...</p><p><strong>D：???:</strong><br> Understood. I&#39;ll dispatch the scouts.</p><p><strong>D：???:</strong><br> We&#39;ll recall not only the Assassins, but the Riders and Casters.</p><p><strong>D：???:</strong><br> If we rely on the other classes for defense, we can hold out to some degree.</p><p><strong>D：???:</strong><br> That includes you too.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> I gotchaaaa!</p><p><strong>D：???:</strong><br> Your grace...</p><p><strong>A：???:</strong><br> Hm.</p><p><strong>D：???:</strong><br> I sense a turning point for you here, your worship. And I implore you to hold steady.</p><p><strong>A：???:</strong><br> Yeah, of course. I&#39;ll show everyone what Don— Karl der Große is made of!</p><p><strong>D：???:</strong><br> Your words and actions are treading on dangerous ground now, sir. If you&#39;re exposed, it&#39;s heads-off time.</p><p><strong>A：???:</strong><br> Eep!</p><p><strong>D：???:</strong><br> Please keep up a mature, yet bold front. Is that agreeable?</p><p><strong>A：???:</strong><br> Mm!</p><p><strong>D：???:</strong><br> Now then...</p><p><strong>D：???:</strong><br> The fourth faction, naturally, would be that organization...</p><p><strong>D：???:</strong><br> Heaven knows how it will turn out.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> That burns...so that&#39;s...what a Rayshift is like?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Something about it...seemed off...</p><hr><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Indeed.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> It seems the circumstances are different from how we usually Rayshift.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Fair enough. This is my first time, after all.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> I&#39;ll leave figuring out what went weird to you guys.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Master, can you communicate with Chaldea?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes, Chaldea here. This is Mash Kyrielight, comms operator.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> We picked up some strange fluctuations during the Rayshift, are you all right?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I&#39;m okay!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That&#39;s a relief...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Right.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> We were able to confirm both Master and Kadoc&#39;s safety from here as well.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> And Holmes and Vlad weren&#39;t thrown astray. You&#39;ve all made it safely.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> According to SHEBA&#39;s observations, there should be a small town nearby.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Is that where we&#39;re heading?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Whatever the case, the first step is information. We must gather clues, even when risking some danger.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> If that&#39;s what the manual says...</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> ... ...</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> By the way, let me ask you something. Have you ever made use of Suggestion?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Suggestion?</p><hr><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> I get it...</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> So despite knowing you look suspicious, you purposefully talked things out no matter how crazy the notion...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Well, should it matter, [♂ his /♀️ her] Mystic Code pretty much eliminates most of the physical discomfort that comes with magecraft.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> That&#39;s true...!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It is...!</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Got to show you all the ropes... Well, okay.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> I&#39;ll be using Suggestion, so you better think of some questions while you can.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Got it.</p><hr><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Now, how about the destination?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Right. It&#39;s straight north from your location.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Then let us be off. I would have preferred a mount, but we shall make do on foot.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Then I shall serve as rear guard.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Fujimaru, Kadoc. You two take the center of the formation.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Yeah.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> ... ...?</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Holmes?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Oh, I&#39;m sorry. I&#39;ll be right with you.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> The clear blue sky. A gentle breeze makes a pleasant sound on the grassy meadows.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Every bit of it is tranquil. Peaceful.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> —And for that reason, they couldn&#39;t help but have a frighteningly ominous premonition.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> The subject of that premonition was...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Not Kadoc Zemlupus. Not Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> And not Vlad III. Not even Sherlock Holmes.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> ... ...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>It was, despite all odds, this girl alone who felt there was no choice but to send [♂ him /♀️ her] into the Singularity.</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> It&#39;s all in ruins...</p><hr><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> No sign of people. It seems fortune does not favor us...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> No sign of anyone, you say...? Hm.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Mister Zemlupus. Can you perform a detailed analysis of the debris?</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Analysis? You want me to date it or something?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> If you could. I can garner some knowledge of the events, but—</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Naturally, the veracity is limited. Reaching the minutiae of the matter is not plausible without the use of magecraft.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> But this time, we have a magus with us.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> So that&#39;s how it is, huh?</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> It&#39;s not exactly my area of expertise, but nothing I outright can&#39;t do.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> I&#39;ll essentially just be performing archeological dating.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Yes, that will be fine.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Furthermore, I theorize that this debris is not man-made, but magical in nature.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Magical...?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Perhaps just the debris, or perhaps the whole town. Let us wait for his analysis first.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> What kind of a joke is this...?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> What is it?</p><hr><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Well...long story short, this whole thing is woven together using magecraft.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> I guess it&#39;s almost like a Caster&#39;s “Territory Creation” skill?</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> This kind of feat would be difficult for any ordinary magus...but a Servant could pull it off easily.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> The whole area is reminiscent of something from medieval to modern Europe...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> How strange, indeed.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Lord Vlad said there was no sign of human activity earlier.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> But the way it appears to me, it is as if it had never been used in the first place.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> What do you mean...?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> It is akin to a movie set, metaphorically speaking.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> There are faint traces of use, but not over an extended period of time.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> This place was constructed in an instant by a Servant or a magus.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Or so I would like to believe...</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> I see...</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Such things do occur, strange as it may sound.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Then allow me to pose a question, detective.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Yes?</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Assuming that this town were created by a Servant or something equivalent...</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Who would have been the one to destroy it?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Well, this was certainly not due to natural disaster. Nor was it simply overrun by nature.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Holes in the walls, likely from arrows. Nicks and scratches caused by stray blows from weapons in close quarters.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> To those of us gathered here, this should be a regretfully familiar sight.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> This was a battleground for Servants.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Master. Everyone. Please be on your guard.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I&#39;m sensing Servants, heading directly towards you.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The number...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> N-Numbers—</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Mash?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> N-no, this can&#39;t be right... Da Vinci!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> I&#39;ve got the same here as well! This can&#39;t be a malfunction.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Stay calm and listen, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> You&#39;ve got an army of Servants heading your way.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Wait. An army?</p><hr><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Yeah.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> I&#39;ve got about a hundred separate signals. All of them Servants.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Wha—</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Let me reconfirm that.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> They are actually Servants, and not something comparable to them?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> I&#39;ve already double- and triple-checked it, I&#39;m positive! Now either hide or get out of there!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> U-um, another army has just appeared! Their numbers are roughly the same!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> How in the—!?</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Hrm.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> So this town is to become the center of a pincer attack by Servants?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Enemy contact is imminent.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Well then... Let us make ourselves scarce.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Kadoc. Master.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Concealing one&#39;s presence would prove difficult, so long as as one is not of the Assassin class.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> However, when they have formed large groups like this, the likelihood of being found anyway is quite high.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> I would like you two to conceal yourselves elsewhere. Lord Vlad and I will do our best to slip past them.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Use your Command Spells if need be. Even if worst comes to pass, we should probably be able to turn this around.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Roger!</p><hr><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> I shall count on you two. We shall do the same, of course.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> To do what?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> What are the thoughts and aims of the approaching Servants, exactly?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Gathering information is our first priority. Every bit of their words and deeds we observe will be invaluable.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Got it.</p><hr><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Thank you, [♂ Mister /♀️ Miss] Fujimaru. Well, goodbye for now!</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Here should be good. Let&#39;s dig out a hiding place.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Should I get more debris?</p><hr><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Yeah, probably...</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Something big enough to conceal this, but not so much that it draws attention.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Okay!</p><hr><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> This should work. All right, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Hurry up and get in. And don&#39;t move a muscle.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> “Rat&#39;s body in hiding. Cat&#39;s byway escape. Let shallow cleverness prevail o&#39;er cunning.”</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Was that...?</p><hr><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Concealment magecraft.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> I don&#39;t know if it&#39;ll fool a Servant, but it&#39;s better than nothing.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Amazing...</p><hr><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Are you serious? This is some pretty basic stuff.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> The incantation isn&#39;t even shortened. It&#39;s still too slow to be used in the spur-of-the-moment.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Well...that doesn&#39;t matter now. It helps with soundproofing too, but don&#39;t raise your voice.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> What kind of magus are you?</p><hr><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Hm? Oh, you&#39;re asking about my magecraft.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Should I not?</p><hr><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> No, it&#39;s fine... It&#39;s on the verge of obsolescence now anyway. Actually, it probably already is.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Telling you about it won&#39;t make a difference at this point.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> It&#39;s anti-beast magecraft, meant for fighting animals.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Man has been his own worst enemy ever since ancient times, but predators were still up there in terms of threats.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> No human could win against a beast barehanded.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> So, the creation of magecraft to fight them was probably inevitable.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> You can probably guess why it&#39;s on its way out now.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Both tracking and killing beasts...</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> All of that can be done with mundane means in the present day.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> It&#39;s helpful for bringing down beasts of prey—</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> But those sort of beasts don&#39;t even exist in the modern age anymore.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> I guess that&#39;s the fate of magecraft in general...</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> The art grows stronger and more stable with time, but eventually loses its purpose.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Did you ever think about quitting being a mage?</p><hr><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> ... ...</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> If you were expecting to catch me off guard... it didn&#39;t work.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> But, let me give you a tip.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> If you asked that of any normal magus, they&#39;d probably kill you as a matter of course.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> It&#39;s like asking, “Why don&#39;t you just die, since your life is meaningless?”</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> It would piss anybody off.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Sorry...</p><hr><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Well, I can&#39;t raise a hand against you right now anyway. You&#39;ve got me on your leash, after all.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Sorry...that was uncalled for. I guess I&#39;m still holding a grudge.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Looks like we&#39;re out of time for small talk.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> We got as far away from the center of town as we could, so now we&#39;ll just have to pray they don&#39;t find us.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> —Here they come.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> (Deep breath)</p><hr><p><strong>Saber Class:</strong><br> According to our scouts, the enemies this time are once again mid-class.</p><p><strong>Saber Class:</strong><br> Our strategy is to blanket the area with the Archers&#39; Noble Phantasms, while deploying the Riders on the flanks.</p><p><strong>Saber Class:</strong><br> The Sabers and Lancers will hold the center, while the Riders will charge in and cause disarray amongst the frontline.</p><p><strong>Saber Class:</strong><br> Make sure you each time the releases of your Noble Phantasms correctly!</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Unbelievable... They really are all Servants...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> What are their True Names...?</p><hr><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> No clue. But they&#39;re all from different ages and countries.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> And despite that, they&#39;re all organized into a single army.

There&#39;s nothing but liquor in the bar.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> This atmosphere doesn&#39;t lend itself well to wine tasting.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> It&#39;s unfortunate, but maybe another opportunity will present itself.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Now then, both of you, please recall what you&#39;ve learned. It doesn&#39;t matter how small a detail it may seem.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Hmm...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> I see.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Armies of Servants...</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> This ludicrous sight is something I&#39;ve once dreamt of. Never did I think it would actually materialize, though.</p><hr><div class="custom-container tip"><p class="custom-container-title">Note</p><p>The below dialogue triggers if the player has completed the Apocrypha Collab Story.</p></div><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> According to the database, the largest recorded battle between Servants was seven against seven.</p><hr><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Regarding battles with multiple Servants, exceptions like the Final Singularity do exist, however...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> That was practically a miracle. And bear in mind that it was the decisive battle to protect the Human Order.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Servants taking up large-scale battle formations like we saw just now is unprecedented.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Indeed, it&#39;s certainly very interesting...</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> At a glance, there seemed to be a bowman from around the Hundred Years War period—a longbowman, to be exact.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> There was also some sort of Samurai from the Far East. Judging by his armour, I&#39;d say he&#39;s probably some warlord from the Warring States period.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> There was another guy with an old Tanegashima arquebus from Japan, as well as someone who looked like an American cowboy.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> The Casters...mostly had their faces hidden or were obscuring their identities.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> The so-called seven classes seemed to be roughly equally distributed in number, coming from an extensive span of regions, as well—</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Seems like it. So next would be...the terms “Heroic Spirit-grade” and “Phantom-grade”.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> That would be the ranking of Saint Graphs. There were more than 200 Servants.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Not all of them were heroes who made their mark on Pan-Human History.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Going by Kadoc&#39;s report...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Consider a hypothetical knight who fought in some famous battle.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> A nameless person who would not be summoned normally, but was in fact summoned here.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> With that said, they are still undoubtedly Servants.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> So it seems...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Why confirm what seem like reminders, Holmes?</p><hr><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Ah, because there&#39;s a substantial difference between something like a Servant-class Demonic Beast and a Servant itself.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Although it&#39;s a rather loose term, it is most correct to describe a Servant as a “Heroic Spirit with a Master”.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Of course, even this has a very broad meaning.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Following that definition, my supposition is that Stray Servants are Heroic Spirits that have a temporary Master in the form of the land they are summoned in.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> To return to our previous topic, no matter how weak or strong they may be,</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> they cannot be a Servant if there is no Master.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Then those Servants were...</p><hr><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> A great mystery indeed. Who is their Master, really?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Or...is there something exceptional that warrants the absence of a Master?</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> We don&#39;t know yet, huh?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Yes, I&#39;ll have to investigate a little more.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> About Revenge, Restoration and Via Regia.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Words with strong connotations, indeed. I&#39;m curious about the Servants, but this seems no less important.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> About those &quot;realms&quot; that were mentioned?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> It most likely refers to a nation or territory.</p><hr><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> —The Revenge Realm, the Restoration Realm, and the Via Regia Realm.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> They may represent the characteristics of each faction. And, taking into account the names that you overheard...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Revenge Realm, and the name Kriemhild.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> That is without a doubt the Kriemhild from Siegfried&#39;s legend.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> I infer that her class is Saber or Berserker. Though there is also the possibility of it being Avenger.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> From the battle formations of the Heroic Spirits, it can be assumed that she has quite the intellect, or that she has an excellent adjutant.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Restoration Realm...Constantine.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> There are multiple Constantines, but my deductions suggest that it would be the 11th.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Constantine XI, the last emperor of the Eastern Roman Empire.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> The name “Restoration” is certainly intriguing, but let&#39;s put that aside as being an unknown for now.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Lastly, the Via Regia Realm and Karl der Große.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> That&#39;s such a big name to appear here... If it is indeed Karl der Große, he would be overwhelming.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> He should be on a level where I would confidently declare that he&#39;d win this war.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> I am of the same opinion.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Neither Kriemhild nor Constantine could compare to him.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Is Karl der Große really that amazing?</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> You should pay more attention to your studies.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> His name is one that looms over European history, probably one of the most well known in the whole world.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> The King of the Franks, who became the first Emperor of the successor to ancient Rome, the Holy Roman Empire.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Essentially, one of the forefathers of Europe.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> The strength of a Servant depends not only on their individual qualities, but also their level of fame and the depth of their Mystery...</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Taking that into account, Karl der Große would be a top-ranked Servant.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> (Continue listening in silence)</p><hr><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> However, there are some things that weigh on my mind. The way he&#39;s waging war, for example.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Waging war?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> I&#39;m referring to the maneuvering of the Via Regia Realm&#39;s army.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> In order to reduce losses of their own troops, they withdraw until a suitable point in time, and let the other factions fight it out.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Lord Vlad, would you say that the use of such a tactic is suitable for a situation like this?</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> I would. Hmm...it&#39;s just that...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Just what?</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> It was a clash between medium-sized units. And it seemed to be rather one-sided, as well.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> As such, depending on how they timed the intervention, it should have been possible to thoroughly subjugate the enemy.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> If I had been in command, I would have waited a little longer before entering the fray.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> The already-pressured Restoration Realm&#39;s forces would have no choice but to strike the Revenge Realm&#39;s forces as hard as they could to avoid being caught in a pincer maneuver.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> The Via Regia Realm would then be in a position to mercilessly destroy the exhausted soldiers of the Restoration Realm.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> If they had then attempted to retaliate, ignoring the Revenge Realm—</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> they would already be far too deep behind enemy lines.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> At that point, even a glancing attack from an Archer or Caster could cause considerable damage.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> From what I&#39;ve observed, the timing certainly seemed roughly handled.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> ... But...what if it wasn&#39;t?</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> What?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Well...if their timing wasn&#39;t roughly handled, I can think of several other possibilities.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> However, it is not something that can be confirmed at the moment.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Ah...could you mean...?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> It isn&#39;t time to talk about it yet!</p><hr><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Hahaha, you beat me to it. Now then, regarding their goals...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Most of the Stray Servants summoned by the Holy Grail, the source of their respective Singularity, were in service of the Human Order.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Or at least, our past experiences indicate as much.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Likewise, the Heroic Spirits summoned in rituals such as the Holy Grail War also tend to be on the side of the Human Order.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> That said, the nature of Heroic Spirits vary greatly.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Their personality may be altered depending on whether they have a Master or not.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> A virtuous hero, or a monster baring their fangs.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Both are equally valid sides of the same person, both records of the past.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> You&#39;ve been talking about fundamental stuff for a while now, Holmes...</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> A little roundabout, don&#39;t you think?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Hahaha, my apologies.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Well, essentially—this situation wouldn&#39;t normally be possible.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> The Servants, whether they are good or evil, have formed armies and mobilized as part of them.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Land, country, ideology, faith, and lineage seem to all have been thrown out the window.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> In some ways, it&#39;s an ideal world. With that said, the Three Kingdoms...or should I call them the Three Realms?</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> As they are fighting against each other, there must be something that they disagree on...</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> So are they our enemies? Or could they be allies?</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Is it possible to arrange for a temporary cooperation, something like between me and you guys?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> I would hope that one of these three realms are on our side.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> But we have to be cautious in our approach.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> After all, this battlefield of organized Servant armies is not one we have experienced before.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Holmes and I are both limited in what we can do.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> The aforementioned medium-sized units would annihilate us, no matter which realm they serve.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> The difference in numbers is just too vast. And they have their Noble Phantasms as trump cards, as well.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> ... ...</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Master, to battle positions. The enemy is here.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> !</p><hr><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Huh? An enemy?</p><p><strong>Assassin Class:</strong><br> Your head is mine!</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> I think not.</p><p><strong>Assassin Class:</strong><br> Gh, huh...!?</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Assassins.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I-it&#39;s an enemy Servant! I&#39;m sorry, Master!</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Presence Concealment! Oh dear, that was close!</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> (Vlad III noticed him... I see. The smell of blood alerted him.)</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> There is no need to fret, I will enter battle now. Is that all right, Master?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Go ahead!</p><hr><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Uh...I&#39;ll stand back for now. There&#39;s no need to put myself in danger anyway.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Yes, please do so.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Now then... You seem to be hunting for survivors.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> I might as well ask: which realm are you from?</p><p><strong>Assassin Class:</strong><br> ... ...</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Keeping silent, I see. Regardless, the fact that you are my enemies does not change.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> I shall hunt you without mercy.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> —Let us go. Prepare to receive my stakes of anguish and remorse.</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Assassin Class:</strong><br> Gah, ha...!</p><p><strong>Assassin Class:</strong><br> Your power...your Command Spells...damned be you... our enemy!</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> That settled things.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> I would not call it a trifling task, for many a reason...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Are you monitoring, Da Vinci? I&#39;d like an analysis of the combat data.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Da Vinci...?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Can...■u■ he■r...?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I can&#39;t hear her over all this static...</p><hr><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Hmm...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> A large interference occurred on our side the moment the battle started. We&#39;re in no condition to provide advice, as the data we were collecting is unreliable.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Hm.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> The same as in the Fairy Kingdom?</p><hr><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> I wouldn&#39;t be so sure. I&#39;m noticing some slightly differing nuance.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> No electronic devices were allowed in the Fairy Kingdom. That was a concept born out of its rejection of Pan-Human History.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> But here, despite the constant interferences, the equipment did not lose its function.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Meaning we should believe that the mechanism at work here is not the same as in the Fairy Kingdom.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Man...you&#39;re pretty much how I imagined the great detective.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> That&#39;s because I am the great detective.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Was there anything of note in the battle we just fought?</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Either Master or Kadoc Zemlupus may answer.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Command Spells...</p><hr><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> ... Oh...right.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> They had Command Spells loaded.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Not normal Command Spells, though. Support Command Spells, the same kind Chaldea&#39;s Masters use.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> They were loaded with enough energy to fire off a Noble Phantasm without charging one.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> So, who gave them Command Spells?</p><hr><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> ... That&#39;s the question.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> If it was a Master, we can safely assume them not to be any normal human being.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Command Spells were activated in the battle we witnessed, and again in the one we just fought.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> That&#39;s not something anyone would do with a resource that can only be used three times. I could understand if they had a magical core recharging the Command Spells,</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> but nothing suggested they did. Even the most skilled of magi—</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Yeah, I don&#39;t think even Kirschtaria could have done that.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Even assuming a magus on his level is still alive, it still sounds impossible.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Hmm. Then where did their Command Spells come from?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> It looked like they fell from the sky.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> The sky?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> From far beyond here...</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Right. They came from further than our eyes can see, at the very least.</p><hr><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Well...let&#39;s avoid jumping to conclusions this early. We&#39;re severely lacking in information.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Only one fact matters right now.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> They called us their enemy. They are unquestionably hostile to us.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> And what should we do about it?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Good question. A reasonable approach would be...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> To find a Servant willing to help us, and a local to share information about what&#39;s happening here.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Ideally one of each, but we need at least one or the other.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Any comments, Holmes?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> It won&#39;t be easy.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> A search for an ally amongst the Servants shouldn&#39;t go the usual route in this case.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> All Servants are obviously in established conflict against one another.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> I have little hopes of finding a local either.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> How so?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> The town we&#39;re in says it all. What do you think it was built for?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> The most likely reason is as a setting for a battle to the death. The town was made just for what we witnessed.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Knowing that this was North America, we should naturally assume local populations inhabited the area,</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> but they either escaped or died as collateral of the war.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Whichever it is, it&#39;s safe to assume we&#39;ll find no locals here.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Therefore, we must somehow find a Servant who shares our interests.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> While not the most honorable method to solve our problems,</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> I assume no one here is against torturing a captured Servant for information, correct?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Information gained through torture is not trustworthy, so I&#39;d prefer a more amicable approach.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Hmph, so be it.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Master, a special warning!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Special warning!</p><hr><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> What the hell is that?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Crap, I forgot to inform Kadoc.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> It&#39;s a warning for when our previous combat data indicates the presence of one particular kind of Servant.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Having Muramasa with us for such a long period of time really helped out a lot.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> You don&#39;t mean...?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Just as you&#39;ve guessed, Kadoc. An Apostle of the Alien God.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> With Limbo eliminated and Mister Muramasa having given his life,</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> there&#39;s only one left: Grigori Rasputin...that is, Kotomine Kirei.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> But what reason could he have to show his face here—?</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> ... ...</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> (What&#39;s going on...? Something inside me seems certain it&#39;s not him.)</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> (But it&#39;s a fact that he&#39;s the only Apostle of the Alien God left.)</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> (No, wait, unless—)</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Indeed, I do feel the presence of a Servant. Hide not, Apostle of the Alien God.</p><p><strong>F：???:</strong><br> Oh dear, you got me good. No point in hiding what is already known.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...!</p><hr><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> That&#39;s...not Rasputin!</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> You, you&#39;re—</p><p><strong>F：???:</strong><br> So nice to meet you, my dear Holmes. No, I shouldn&#39;t act so familiar with an older gentleman.</p><p><strong>F：???:</strong><br> How about “Sir Sherlock,” if you&#39;ll pardon the sarcasm?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Who are you...?</p><p><strong>F：???:</strong><br> Oh, have you never seen my face before?

What is your objective, James Moriarty?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> If I said I was here to purge a traitor, what would you think?</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> I&#39;d be honored, and thank you for my good fortune.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Then I&#39;d bend over laughing at how petty the Alien God really is.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> But that&#39;s not what you mean, is it?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Oh, naturally. The Alien God has no interest in you in the slightest.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Ain&#39;t that great.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> And let me reassure you, you are not a traitor in any sense.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> The Alien God desired Kirschtaria Wodime alone.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> The rest of you were nothing more than the cheap toys that come with the cereal, wouldn&#39;t you agree?</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Yeah, I know.

Just what kind of power is that...?)</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> (Based on previous data, he must have the power of a Divine Spirit, much like Limbo and Muramasa did.)</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> (Think closely, Kadoc. Moriarty remains unharmed.)</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> (The Noble Phantasm definitely connected with him.

Your decision-making in the face of a predator is cardinal.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> But you were too slow.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Your best option would have been to drop everything and run the instant you recognized me.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> —“Rise up, and rebel.”</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> D-damn you...!</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Now, which Realm will you choose?

Do you remember that Caster from earlier?</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Oh, the Tao spellcaster... I&#39;m not all that familiar with the Eastern arts.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Neither am I, yet I recognized his words. “The Azure Sky is surely dead.” An ancient Chinese proclamation about the Han dynasty.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> There&#39;s more to it as well. “The Yellow Sky will soon rise.”</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> “Yellow Sky” was the name given to the head of a certain religious sect in ancient China.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> That sect&#39;s name was the Way of Supreme Peace—and it was lead by the legendary Zhang Jiao, a Taoist practitioner of considerable skill.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> So long as he is there, infiltration will be nigh-on impossible.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Taoism, huh...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Taoist arts, or Xian arts... My own understanding only scratches the surface—</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> It would be a poor plan to charge his stronghold empty-handed.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> That much is certain.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> I&#39;ll look into it on my end too. But, what are you planning to do for now?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> At this point, we&#39;ve significantly deviated from my original plan... And so I believe we should instead head for the Restoration Realm first.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> The Restoration Realm...? Well, I guess I don&#39;t really have anything against that...</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> So you want to negotiate with them?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> I intend to.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> However, I have one concern with them I would first like to investigate.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> That being?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> What exactly the word “Restoration” refers to.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Let&#39;s move out...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> If we can secure their cooperation, and rescue Fujimaru...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Our available options should dramatically increase.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> I guess so...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Time is against us. Come, Kadoc!</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Right.</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> (The mood here is surprisingly friendly...)</p><hr><p><strong>Rider Class:</strong><br> Hey, Saber.</p><p><strong>Saber Class:</strong><br> What is it?</p><p><strong>Rider Class:</strong><br> What country did you say you were from, and what did you do there?</p><p><strong>Saber Class:</strong><br> C&#39;mon, we&#39;ve been working together for days.

But they gotta have some of my blood!</p><p><strong>Rider Class:</strong><br> Archer, this your first time with us, right? Where are you from?</p><p><strong>Archer Class:</strong><br> I&#39;m one of the Knights of Fianna. My True Name is...</p><p><strong>Rider Class:</strong><br> Oh, don&#39;t bother.

The artificial berserker, Frankenstein.</p><p><strong>Rider Class:</strong><br> They all made a name for themselves, but some chose death and some went out like warriors...each met their respective fate.</p><p><strong>Rider Class:</strong><br> Being remembered, whatever for, is a mark of success.</p><p><strong>Archer Class:</strong><br> I know. Distinguished service is the pride of all warriors.</p><p><strong>Saber Class:</strong><br> Yeah, that&#39;s the spirit.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> (I see there&#39;s a few names I know...)</p><hr><p><strong>Rider Class:</strong><br> Hey, kid!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Rider Class:</strong><br> I&#39;m talking to you.

You don&#39;t feel like one.</p><p><strong>Rider Class:</strong><br> Not a civilian either.

So where&#39;re you from?</p><p><strong>Saber Class:</strong><br> Must be Japan, considering [♂ his /♀️ her] face.</p><p><strong>Rider Class:</strong><br> Oh, Japanese. Ah, I remember seeing one in another squad.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> (They&#39;re not hostile like that Archer from before.)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> (What makes them different, I wonder...?)</p><hr><p><strong>Saber Class:</strong><br> Cut the chatter. We&#39;re taking [♂ him /♀️ her] to be executed.</p><p><strong>Rider Class:</strong><br> What? Is that true, Master Zhang Jiao?</p><p><strong>Zhang Jiao:</strong><br> Hoh-hoh-hoh.

Your fortune for encounters is terribly unlucky, yet excellently lucky.</p><p><strong>Zhang Jiao:</strong><br> Your bagua is overall leaning towards bad luck. You have nowhere to run.</p><p><strong>Zhang Jiao:</strong><br> Your only weapon here is the wit of your words, pretty much.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Bad luck, huh...</p><hr><p><strong>Rider Class:</strong><br> Hahaha.

Get it together, Sherlock.)</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> (Did being outwitted by the Professor throw me out of sorts? No, that&#39;s not it. Wake up. Open your eyes.)</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> A solid image, to be sure. It resembles the citadel of Camelot from the Holy Land&#39;s Singularity, in a way.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Da Vinci.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> We&#39;re concealing the transmission. Will that be a problem?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> I do not believe so.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> It seems that communications with [♂ Mister /♀️ Miss] Fujimaru are still being jammed, so...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> [♂ His /♀️ Her] vitals are still stable. Seems like [♂ he /♀️ she]&#39;s safe for the moment.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Now then—</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> The fact that every single one is a Servant... it&#39;s nothing short of astonishing.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> It&#39;s like we&#39;re at a swap meet for them.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> That one is French...and that one is German... or perhaps Austrian...?</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Can you tell their True Names?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> I can hazard a guess at a few...but more importantly, this all confirms one thing.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> There is one fundamental commonality between their summonings—an extremely strange one at that.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> What?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> They all serve one Master, most likely.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> ... Huh...?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> When it comes to a Servant, the role of a Master can be reduced to two primary duties.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> The first is to serve as an anchor to bind their existence to the world. A keystone, if you would.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Anybody with functioning magic circuits and sufficient aptitude is capable of this.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Like Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Precisely.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> That is [♂ Mister /♀️ Miss] Fujimaru&#39;s primary role.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Second is the provision of energy for the Servant.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Magical energy is vital for Servants, so it falls to the Master to supply it.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Yeah, that&#39;s right.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> In the case of you guys, summoning Servants has to be supplemented by some kind of magical furnace operated by Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Indeed...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> That is ultimately how Chaldea secures the energy for its Servants.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> The same holds true here. Every single one of them are receiving magical energy from the same entity.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> How did you even pick up on all that?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> I judged as much from their behavior and conversation. In addition, I used the greatest tool of all—</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> My intuition.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Uh-huh...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> In any case...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Put simply, we have several thousand Servants all fighting each other under a singular Master.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> They range from Phantom-grade for small-scale individual combat, all the way to Heroic-Spirit grade to affect a large area.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> This should be impossible...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Yes, or very close to it.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Even if they are somehow using the same system Chaldea does, they would require some sort of high-output source of magical energy, such as our own magic furnace.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Naturally, the source of energy here must be a Holy Grail. However, I&#39;ve never heard of one being divided into thirds.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Right...you simply cannot subdivide a Grail like that.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> What I&#39;m more worried about is what they all want.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> ...Hm?</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> What is it?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> There is some kind of commotion over there... Let&#39;s go take a look.</p><p><strong>Archer Class:</strong><br> The 17th Iron Fingers engaged a Via Regia Realm unit in combat.</p><p><strong>Archer Class:</strong><br> Zero casualties were suffered due to the enemy&#39;s immediate retreat!</p><p><strong>Lancer Class:</strong><br> The 7th Beetles and the 9th Rain of Fire engaged a medium-sized Revenge Realm unit at Fort Ortous.</p><p><strong>Lancer Class:</strong><br> Both the 6th and the 8th were annihilated. Our own units suffered heavy casualties as well.</p><p><strong>Lancer Class:</strong><br> However, we succeeded in taking Fort Ortous. Casters have already started reconstruction.</p><p><strong>Lancer Class:</strong><br> That is all!</p><p><strong>D：???:</strong><br> Very good.</p><p><strong>D：???:</strong><br> No signs of weakness. The Via Regia Realm remains as elusive as ever...</p><p><strong>D：???:</strong><br> We&#39;ve attempted to scout them using Assassins multiple times, and yet they always break and flee before anything comes of it.</p><p><strong>D：???:</strong><br> They&#39;ve completely blocked any scrying attempted by our Casters as well.</p><p><strong>Saber Class:</strong><br> Your Lordship, should we move against them in full? Our forces should be more than sufficient.</p><p><strong>D：???:</strong><br> No. There is nothing more foolish than engaging in a war on two fronts... If only we could acquire more information...</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> (Is he the ruler here...?)</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> (If so, that must be Constantine XI.)</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> ... ...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> (Did he notice us?)</p><p><strong>J：???:</strong><br> Excuse me, please.</p><p><strong>Both:</strong><br> !!</p><p><strong>E：???:</strong><br> The two of you are not safe here.</p><p><strong>E：???:</strong><br> He will recognize you. Come this way.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Hey.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Yes... Let&#39;s go for now. Don&#39;t look towards the emperor.</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> ... ...</p><p><strong>Saber Class:</strong><br> Is something the matter?</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> Nothing. Give me the latest report.</p><p><strong>Saber Class:</strong><br> Yes, Your Lordship.</p><p><strong>Saber Class:</strong><br> It&#39;s from an Assassin undercover in the Revenge Realm.</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> Oh?</p><p><strong>Saber Class:</strong><br> “They&#39;ve captured the Master of Chaldea. [♂ He /♀️ She] is now their prisoner.”</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> —I see. So that&#39;s how it is.</p><p><strong>Saber Class:</strong><br> Your Lordship?</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> Assemble the men. It seems we too have been infiltrated.</p><p><strong>Saber Class:</strong><br> You mean—</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> By Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Saber Class:</strong><br> ...!</p><p><strong>E：???:</strong><br> —Okay. We&#39;ve made it this far, so we should probably be safe.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> You have our thanks, Miss—</p><p><strong>E：???:</strong><br> Ah, let me take off my disguise.</p><p><strong>E：???:</strong><br> Whew. I could hardly breathe in that!</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Who&#39;re you?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> I see...you have some relation to the church?</p><p><strong>E：???:</strong><br> Yes. My name is Joan.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Joan...wait, as in Johanna!? The one from the High Priestess arcana!?</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> Yes. The Illusory Popess, Joan.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Allow me to make introductions. I am Sherlock Holmes.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> And this is Kadoc Zemlupus. He is not a Servant, but a Master.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> You didn&#39;t have to tell her that...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> I did not, but it should not pose a problem. It would have come to light eventually anyway, and we need to gain her trust.</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> Oh, well, thank you very much.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Well, well...how uncharacteristically kind of you, Holmes.</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> Does he actually have a soft spot for pretty girls?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Hahaha. Could you two stop? I don&#39;t need you exposing me so soon.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> So...why exactly did you help us?</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Are you a Servant on our side?</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> No...by all rights...I stand against you.</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> It has to be that way. But...I don&#39;t like it.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> You don&#39;t?</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> Lying, hurting, and killing others...I hate it all.</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> It probably makes me an awful hero... I must seem a jester to you.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Not at all. It&#39;s quite noble of you.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> I apologize for my bluntness, Your Holiness, but right now we need information.</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> Of course. I&#39;ll tell you all I can.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> First of all—please enlighten us as to the current state of events in this Singularity.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Or, so I would like to ask, but having you start from the beginning would be too time-consuming. Allow me instead to elucidate a theory of mine.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Please feel free to interrupt if you have anything to add, or if I am mistaken somehow.</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> All right.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Now then...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> —This Singularity is home to three rival powers. Each of them possess their own territories, which are called Realms.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> The Revenge Realm of Kriemhild, the Restoration Realm of Constantine...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> ...and the Via Regia Realm of Karl.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> But is this merely a struggle for power...or is there perhaps some secondary objective?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> The reason why this Singularity should not exist is that every single Heroic Spirit here stands against Pan-Human History.</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> Yes... It is as you say.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Most likely, the battle is over the Holy Grails.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> One Grail alone simply cannot account for all of this.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> There must be one for each Realm, and each in turn seeks the other two.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> A high enough prize for anyone to wage war over.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Three Grails...! So that&#39;s where they&#39;re getting all that energy!</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> My, you even guessed that much...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> It was a simple deduction.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> In addition—the Master that originally bound you here simultaneously both does and does not exist.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Their Command Spells are invoked in times of combat, but they themselves never appear in person.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> One definitely exists, and yet nobody has seen them in person.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Your Master is an enigma—and because of that, the Servants have nothing to do besides rebel as they like.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> You have no specific orders from a Master. So instead, you simply began doing whatever you pleased.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> You band together based around shared thoughts, actions, and motivations.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> And you have no idea when or how this will all come to an end.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> You simply and single-mindedly continue your little war.</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> —Your analysis was perfect. There wasn&#39;t anything for me to add.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> You are too kind, Your Holiness.</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> At first I was... baffled. Rebelling against the Human Order, throwing Pan-Human History into chaos.</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> Orders that no Servant should want to receive.</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> ...and yet we had no problem with it. We simply accepted the orders.</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> It varies from person to person, and occasionally someone will not let themselves be convinced.</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> But even so—we simply can&#39;t disobey them.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Does your Master have that much power?</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> No...and that&#39;s what I don&#39;t understand. Why do we continue with this? Why can&#39;t we disobey them?</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> It&#39;s a mystery to all of us.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Hm...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> ... It truly is an enigma...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> May I ask one more thing? I&#39;d like to know more about the various Realms.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Any peculiarities of theirs, specifically.</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> Yes, of course.</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> The Revenge Realm—Kriemhild&#39;s—is our biggest opponent at the moment.</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> Revenge. Anger. Despair. That&#39;s her moti...mochi...</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Motivation?</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> Yes, that!</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> Ahem... At least, that&#39;s what I&#39;ve heard.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> (She&#39;s so crude!)</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> I see, I see.</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> Consequently, she seems to make use of more Berserkers...or so they say.</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> As for our Realm, that of Restoration...well, you can see it for yourself.</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> We have fewer overall Servants than those of the Revenge Realm do, but I think we are better organized.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> I see, I see. So you say everyone is doing their best—</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> Yes, everyone works so hard! It&#39;s amazing!</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Hahaha. Well that poses a bit of a problem for us, though.</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> O-oh, yes...I&#39;m sorry...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> You seem to have some trouble saying it, so allow me to guess. Your Servants are of a higher quality here.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Am I correct?</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> Y-yes...that&#39;s right.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> What? What&#39;s difficult about that?</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> The Revenge Realm emphasizes quantity, while the Restoration excels in quality.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Their morale is both equally high, though. So what of the Via Regia Realm?</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> They—actually, we don&#39;t know much about them right now.</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> Both the number and quality of their Servants is unknown. Nobody&#39;s even managed to infiltrate their city.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Oh-ho.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> I would have guessed the Realm led by Karl der Große to be the predominant power here...</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> I—I&#39;m afraid I can&#39;t answer that. I&#39;m sorry I can&#39;t be of more assistance.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> No, we learned more than enough. My thanks, Your Holiness.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> No doubt it must have been difficult for you.</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> Difficult...?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> You are the only one here suffering over the contradiction between the Human Order and your orders to rebel.</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> It&#39;s not just me... Everyone is conflicted on the inside.</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> The Master&#39;s command to rebel against the Human Order. My very nature, which tells me to save it.</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> My instincts drive me to the former, yet logic sends me to the latter. It was following that logic that led me to speak to the two of you...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> I see...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Holmes.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> ...!</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> (What is it?)</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> (We&#39;re surrounded. Time to leave.)</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> (Was it her...?)</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> ...?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> (No. Apparently we were spotted, and they made the first move.)</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> —Oh, there was one more thing left to ask.</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> Yes, what is it?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Are you perhaps the reason why this Realm is named “Restoration”?</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> That—</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Oh, you&#39;ll have to excuse us!</p><p><strong>Assassin Class:</strong><br> Gh!</p><p><strong>Assassin Class:</strong><br> You bastard...!</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> Please stop!</p><p><strong>Assassin Class:</strong><br> Your Holiness!</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> Let them go... That conversation told me all I need to know about Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> We don&#39;t need to worry about them.</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> —I see. So you did not betray us.</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> What would be the point in that?</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> You&#39;re quite right... This is all you have.</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> That is why we are the Restoration Realm.</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> My apologies. It seems I&#39;ve become a little high-strung.</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> —No. Your devotion is most important to me.</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> Still, Chaldea seems less well-prepared than I had expected.</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> The Servant, Sherlock Holmes. And the Master, Kadoc Zemlupus.</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> They seem to be its only two members.</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> Hm...then we can put off dealing with them until later.</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> Yes.</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> No point in lingering on Sherlock Holmes still. That great detective spun out of nothing more than a tale.</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> ... ...</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> Hm? Ah, my apologies... I did not mean it that way.</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> Yes, I know. I&#39;m well acquainted with you by now.</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> Is that so...? Well then, Joan–sorry, Your Holiness.</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> I&#39;d like you to come by the castle. Your presence will be good for the men&#39;s morale.</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> Yes, of course. Let us go.</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> Indeed, let&#39;s.</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> I wonder if I should sing a hymn...?</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> Save that for another time.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> —I have lost my way, Constantine.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Your wish and mine are doubtless one and the same.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Even still...I am but myself.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Pope Joan is, after all, but a fleeting dream, never to be dreamt a second time—</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Seems like that&#39;s the last of our pursuers. I didn&#39;t think we were gonna get away...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> It was a rather half-hearted pursuit in the end. Her Holiness Joan must have made arrangements.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Arrangements...?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> She didn&#39;t help us out of the goodness of her heart, you know.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> She wanted to get as much information about Chaldea as she could.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> To her, we are unknown invaders. It&#39;s just that—</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Just what?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> It doesn&#39;t seem like she made contact with us solely with that straightforward motive.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> She is agonising in her own way.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Do you have any evidence, or I guess, any logic that led you to that conclusion?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> She knew our identities.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> That in itself is no surprise, as Moriarty is here.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> If he is operating behind the scenes, it&#39;s safe to assume that such information has been leaked.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Well, that&#39;s true. There&#39;s no need for Moriarty to even show himself...</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> There should be plenty of methods to supply information to Constantine&#39;s faction.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> With that in mind, there is one strange thing.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Even from that short conversation, I was able to recognise that, Her Holiness, Joan is an intelligent and dependable person.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Would someone like her really think that she could extract information from me?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> As conceited a line as I&#39;ve ever heard, but I do agree.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Ah... I thought about that too...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> With Holmes&#39; level of perception, I&#39;d be more afraid of him extracting information from me.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Exactly.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> She appeared alone in front of me and pretended to help, all the while trying to extract information.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> I cannot help but find this behaviour peculiar.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> After all, it&#39;s me we&#39;re talking about. Therefore, I believe that—</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> While pretending to get information out of us, she was also giving some to us...?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Yes, indeed.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Perhaps she is under the impression that she is not contradicting herself.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> That she was acting with all her heart for the sake of her Realm.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> But as she said, logic won out.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> It may be her sense of responsibility as a guardian of the Human Order, or some other emotion entirely.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Well... anyhow, it&#39;s good that we managed to get away.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> So what should we do now?</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> That should be obvious. Continue the investigation of this Singularity.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ... ...</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> Ahem...</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> As far as I&#39;ve been informed, the Revenge Realm is not a place Holmes can handle alone.</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> Thus, intelligence gathering takes precedence. Once this Singularity has been resolved—</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> A chance for Fujimaru to return will definitely present itself.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ... Director, um...</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> Of course...</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> There is no doubt that Fujimaru is the cornerstone of our strategy.</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> As such...</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> You will need to gather information and companions before coming up with a rescue mission plan.</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> Then we&#39;ll talk. All right? Okay!? Got it!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes, of course. There&#39;s no problem!</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> That&#39;s right.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> As long as the necessary elements are in play, a rescue should not prove impossible.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Roger that. So, what now, Holmes? If we&#39;re not going to the Revenge Realm, that means—</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Of course, it will be the Via Regia Realm.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Are you insane? It&#39;s Karl der Große, you know.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Don&#39;t you think that compared to Kriemhild, the princess famed for being drunk on vengeance, we would at least be able to have an audience with him?</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Well, sure, but...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Then let us depart.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> —While this is merely a deduction, I believe his Realm may be our only refuge.</p><h2 id="section-6-do-i-want-your-head" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-6-do-i-want-your-head" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 6: Do I Want Your Head?</h2><p><strong>???:</strong><br> My name is...should I really say it...? Don&#39;t think I can handle the pressure...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> What pressure?</p><hr><p><strong>???:</strong><br> You want me to help you get out of here, don&#39;t you?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I guess, yeah.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> I bet. Any normal person would think that.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Sorry, though. I wasn&#39;t kidding about getting caught.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> I&#39;ve got no magecraft, no Skills, and no Noble Phantasm that&#39;s gonna bust you out of jail. Nothing at all. I&#39;m running on fumes here.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I won&#39;t pressure you.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Oh, you won&#39;t? You&#39;re really something, kid... I can sense—even smell—that you&#39;re a big shot.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Well, not that it really matters. My skills, Noble Phantasms, swordsmanship, magecraft—they&#39;re all in a sealed state.</p><hr><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Will you be all right in that condition?</p><hr><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Hmm...more or less... I&#39;ll probably manage somehow...</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> How do I explain it...? You know how there are types of Noble Phantasms that don&#39;t end too well for the guy using them?</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> That&#39;s where I&#39;m at right now. I could do something if I unleashed that power—</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> But it isn&#39;t time to pull the trigger yet. That&#39;s my gut feeling, at least.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Also...isn&#39;t it about time you told me your name?</p><hr><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Huh? Didn&#39;t I tell you my name?</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> ... ...</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> I didn&#39;t! And I don&#39;t even know your name either!</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Wahahahaha! We&#39;ve been chatting all day and I didn&#39;t even realize!</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Wait, all day? Are you holding up okay? You hungry at all?</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Never mind food. Water!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...maybe not so good...</p><hr><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Whoa, definitely not good! Hey, jailer!! Or just about anyone!</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Somebody get over here! Heeeeyy!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> (Fa...ding...)</p><hr><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Before me, I saw a vast wasteland of endless white. Any trace of humanity had been erased.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> We no longer had any hope for survival, let alone of turning the tide. Nothing we tried had even the slightest effect.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> In this wasteland, I searched through old records like a raccoon pawing through garbage.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I managed to find an old motorcycle, with barely enough fuel for a one-way trip, and began riding across the blinding white wasteland.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> It&#39;s just...nothing about this makes sense. There are so many unanswered questions. If I&#39;m going to die, I at least want to know why.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Was that...my dream? Or was...it...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> a Servant&#39;s...dream...?</p><hr><p><strong>B：???:</strong><br> Oh, you&#39;re finally awake?</p><p><strong>B：???:</strong><br> Are you all right? Try drinking some water. Can you keep it down?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Thank you very much...</p><p><strong>B：???:</strong><br> Oh, you can say a proper “thank you”. That&#39;s a good [♂ boy /♀️ girl].</p><p><strong>B：???:</strong><br> Oh, how rude of me. I should introduce myself.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Who are you...?</p><p><strong>B：???:</strong><br> Well, hehe. I guess that would be what you worry about.</p><p><strong>B：???:</strong><br> But you&#39;re right, I&#39;d better introduce myself.</p><hr><p><strong>B：???:</strong><br> Master of Chaldea, I am Salome. Salome, daughter of Herodias.</p><p><strong>Salome:</strong><br> Um...you&#39;re hungry, aren&#39;t you?</p><p><strong>Salome:</strong><br> I brought fruit, if you&#39;re fine with that. Apples, oranges, and lots more...</p><p><strong>Salome:</strong><br> Oh yes, oranges. Like the sun! They weren&#39;t around when I was alive, but I love them.</p><p><strong>Salome:</strong><br> Yes, you liked them. I&#39;m glad.</p><p><strong>Salome:</strong><br> But this won&#39;t do for a meal. We still need meat, fish, bread, and the sort.</p><p><strong>Salome:</strong><br> I&#39;ll bring them for you later, but I need a favor in return.</p><p><strong>Salome:</strong><br> Is that all right?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> If it&#39;s something I can do from here...</p><hr><p><strong>Salome:</strong><br> Sure, it shouldn&#39;t be any problem!</p><p><strong>Salome:</strong><br> Could you, um, tell me all about yourself?</p><p><strong>Salome:</strong><br> There&#39;s a reason for it.</p><p><strong>Salome:</strong><br> Every last one of the Servants here are the same sort of people, you see.</p><p><strong>Salome:</strong><br> Fighting, killing, fighting again, some more killing, win or don&#39;t, lose or don&#39;t.</p><p><strong>Salome:</strong><br> All the stuff about their legends or stories, or how they ushered in new eras?</p><p><strong>Salome:</strong><br> Yeah, sure. They&#39;re all remarkable people.</p><p><strong>Salome:</strong><br> Everyone&#39;s so, so amazing. They&#39;re all people who made their mark on history.</p><p><strong>Salome:</strong><br> Sure, there are a few who are like Jokanaan. Even then, they&#39;re all...heroes.</p><p><strong>Salome:</strong><br> There must be lots of pure, noble, and holy people in the Restoration Realm...like Jokanaan.</p><p><strong>Salome:</strong><br> Oh, my mind is wandering. Sorry about that.</p><p><strong>Salome:</strong><br> You&#39;re—you&#39;re different, aren&#39;t you?</p><p><strong>Salome:</strong><br> You&#39;re not a hero, and not a Servant. You don&#39;t really look remarkable in any way.</p><p><strong>Salome:</strong><br> So, will you tell me about something? Hey, will you? Anything will do, please.</p><p><strong>Salome:</strong><br> Well? Will you tell me a story?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Uhm...anything&#39;s fine, right?</p><hr><p><strong>Salome:</strong><br> Yes, of course!</p><p><strong>Salome:</strong><br> I don&#39;t mind if it isn&#39;t very engaging. I won&#39;t take your head based on that, okay?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> In that case—</p><hr><p><strong>Salome:</strong><br> Well, hehehe. That&#39;s so funny!</p><p><strong>Salome:</strong><br> I had no idea that happened in the United States. Edison is so fantastic!</p><p><strong>Salome:</strong><br> Doctor Jekyll from England is also so charming.</p><p><strong>Salome:</strong><br> But neither are very much like Jokanaan. Hehehehe.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Hey, you, the Servant.</p><p><strong>Salome:</strong><br> Oh, what is it?</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Er, you mentioned bringing in the rest of the meal. I don&#39;t mean for me, for the Master.</p><p><strong>Salome:</strong><br> Oh! How thoughtless of me!</p><p><strong>Salome:</strong><br> Wait here for a moment. Meat, fish, bread...</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> You okay?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I&#39;m fine, just hungry...</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> I-I don&#39;t mean that, I mean Salome.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> You mean around Salome?</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Yeah, yeah. Salome.</p><hr><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Since, you know, about Salome—</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> She&#39;s the girl who demanded the head of the holy man Jokanaan. A simple-minded and cruel Berserker.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> No matter how you slice it, she&#39;s a calamity of a Servant who could kill you at a moment&#39;s notice.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Aren&#39;t you scared?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> For now, not really.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Gotcha. You know, kid, you&#39;re kinda awesome!</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Oh, that there was meant as a compliment. I&#39;m not being a smartass or nothing!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> She&#39;s not the one who&#39;s after my head.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> R-really? Hmm...well, I guess that&#39;s a good outlook...</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Fair enough. And fairly awesome of you, kid!</p><p><strong>Fujimaru:</strong><br> Is it really that awesome?</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> I don&#39;t know how you see it, but yeah, I think so.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Sorry if it&#39;s a selfish compliment.</p><hr><p><strong>???:</strong><br> ...Hm? Salome...? No, it&#39;s not her...</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Aww, shit.

What&#39;s on the menu?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Meat! Fish! Bread!</p><hr><p><strong>???:</strong><br> You mind being a little more specific?</p><p><strong>Salome:</strong><br> The meat was...um...“roast beef”? Something like that.</p><p><strong>Salome:</strong><br> The fish they shipped in was caught in a lake. I didn&#39;t catch the species.</p><p><strong>Salome:</strong><br> I heard that it&#39;s delicious, though, so it&#39;s probably fine.</p><p><strong>Salome:</strong><br> The bread... I picked one that wasn&#39;t too hard...</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Gotcha. Thanks, girly!</p><p><strong>Salome:</strong><br> I only hear your voice, Mr. Trapped Servant.</p><p><strong>Salome:</strong><br> But you come off as a very heroic person.</p><p><strong>A：???:</strong><br> You can tell by my voice alone?</p><p><strong>Salome:</strong><br> Well...I can tell in one way or another.</p><p><strong>Salome:</strong><br> You must have the makings of a fantastic hero. Or maybe a fantastic adventurer?</p><p><strong>A：???:</strong><br> Hrm, I suppose you hit the nail on one of those heads there, while also being completely off the mark.</p><p><strong>A：???:</strong><br> I&#39;ve just been pointlessly loafing around like this every day since I got caught.</p><p><strong>Salome:</strong><br> I&#39;m not so sure about that. You&#39;ve actually been capable of leaving all along, haven&#39;t you?</p><p><strong>A：???:</strong><br> I dunno... I had thought that would be impossible...</p><p><strong>A：???:</strong><br> Like, if I went that far, then that&#39;d be the end of everything...</p><p><strong>Salome:</strong><br> Hmm.</p><p><strong>Salome:</strong><br> I&#39;m certainly a little interested, but Fujimaru is more valuable to me right now.</p><p><strong>Salome:</strong><br> Valuable...like, precious? Hmm, maybe not that far.</p><p><strong>Salome:</strong><br> Now, Fujimaru. Another story, if you would.</p><p><strong>Salome:</strong><br> Oh, and of course there&#39;s no need to stop eating on my account!</p><p><strong>Salome:</strong><br> Manners aren&#39;t so essential down here.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...all in all, Uruk became a disaster area.</p><hr><p><strong>Salome:</strong><br> Well, well well well!</p><p><strong>Salome:</strong><br> How lovely. How very, very lovely! You adopted that lifestyle so far back in history, did you?</p><p><strong>Salome:</strong><br> I&#39;d thought that we Servants couldn&#39;t really appreciate food since we don&#39;t feel hunger...</p><p><strong>Salome:</strong><br> But I could tell just from listening that the Uruk cuisine was delicious.</p><p><strong>Salome:</strong><br> Yes, yes! My mouth even started watering for the first time in forever!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Sorry, I didn&#39;t leave anything for you...</p><hr><p><strong>Salome:</strong><br> Well! Hehehe, that&#39;s all fine. That&#39;s completely fine.</p><p><strong>Salome:</strong><br> I&#39;m glad you enjoyed it. I&#39;ll be back tomorrow with more of our finest dishes!</p><p><strong>Salome:</strong><br> When I return, why don&#39;t we share them?</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Hey. I&#39;d appreciate being part of that!</p><p><strong>Salome:</strong><br> No, Mr. Hero. You&#39;ll stay where you are.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Dammit! Well, whatever!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Can&#39;t he join in?</p><p><strong>Salome:</strong><br> ... ...</p><p><strong>Salome:</strong><br> Nuh-uh♡</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Too bad...</p><p><strong>Salome:</strong><br> Hngh...</p><p><strong>Salome:</strong><br> Well, I could always share the leftovers with you after we finish eating.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Okay, that&#39;ll do!</p><p><strong>Salome:</strong><br> You are such an easygoing man. It&#39;s almost like you have no burdens to shoulder.</p><p><strong>Salome:</strong><br> Or maybe they&#39;re there and you&#39;re just ignoring them?</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> You&#39;re too sharp by half...</p><p><strong>Salome:</strong><br> Hehehehehe. That&#39;s what makes me me.</p><hr><p><strong>Salome:</strong><br> Now, I have to get going.</p><p><strong>Salome:</strong><br> I&#39;ll see you tomorrow.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Til tomorrow, Salome.</p><hr><p><strong>Salome:</strong><br> ... ...</p><p><strong>Salome:</strong><br> Okay!</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Thanks for helping me score some grub. You don&#39;t mind, right?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> It&#39;s all good!</p><hr><p><strong>???:</strong><br> All right.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> But, I mean...humans take three meals a day. Breakfast, lunch, dinner...</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> You forgot about that, Salome...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> H-hey, I&#39;ll be fine until tomorrow!</p><hr><p><strong>???:</strong><br> And there&#39;s still the matter of water!</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> While we&#39;re at it, there&#39;s something I need to ask...

In short, she&#39;s for all intents and purposes a princess.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> And, well, she went crazy for this prophet guy called Jokanaan.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> If it were a matter of love, you could just write off the whole matter.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Up to that point, whether her love was accepted or not, it comes off as a tragicomedy.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> But Salome wanted the head of the man she loved.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> It&#39;s one of those, you know, fetishes. Something like that, I guess?</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Or maybe her love was so strong that she wanted him to be hers forever?</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> I don&#39;t know the details that well.

That&#39;s right!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Did you ever fight anything in your life?</p><hr><p><strong>A：Seton (?):</strong><br> Sure, I did!

It&#39;s good to have met you, Fujimaru!</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> So Salome has taken a liking to that human?</p><p><strong>Zhang Jiao:</strong><br> In all likelihood.</p><p><strong>Zhang Jiao:</strong><br> She brought food that I&#39;d neglected to provide, and stayed enamored despite the hour.</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> No matter...</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> Her taking a liking to [♂ him /♀️ her] only means the probability of [♂ his /♀️ her] death is that much greater.</p><p><strong>Zhang Jiao:</strong><br> Based on the Jokanaan story?</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> No, I mean as a Servant that came to this Realm.</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> You know what I mean, Zhang Jiao.</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> The object of her love will eventually be seen as Jokanaan.</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> Even if the conversation doesn&#39;t imply that being the case at all, she&#39;ll be convinced of it.</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> She may not seem to think it yet, but sooner or later, it will come to pass.</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> Salome will, without a doubt, be unable to stop herself.</p><p><strong>Zhang Jiao:</strong><br> Hrm. In which case, I suppose I should leave it be?</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> You should still post one or two Servants on guard, just in case.</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> All that remains is for Salome to be convinced that [♂ he /♀️ she] is Jokanaan, and that&#39;s that.</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> All this aside, Zhang Jiao. How is...that...doing?</p><p><strong>Zhang Jiao:</strong><br> Right this way, my queen...</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> Very good. Will it be ready for the decisive battle?</p><p><strong>Zhang Jiao:</strong><br> Of course.</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> —Then it&#39;s simply a matter of whether that battle will occur on the date you specified.</p><p><strong>Zhang Jiao:</strong><br> My divinations foretold as much.</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> I suppose the results would be comparable to a Caster Servant bearing precognitive Skills...</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> Is that really all it takes?</p><p><strong>Zhang Jiao:</strong><br> Indeed.</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> Oh...I nearly forgot. Take care of this, by the way.</p><p><strong>Zhang Jiao:</strong><br> A written directive... Hm...</p><p><strong>Caster Class:</strong><br> Master Zhang Jiao.</p><p><strong>Zhang Jiao:</strong><br> What is it? I&#39;m busy reading this.</p><p><strong>Caster Class:</strong><br> I don&#39;t think that woman truly understands how astounding this research is.</p><p><strong>Zhang Jiao:</strong><br> No...perhaps not.</p><p><strong>Caster Class:</strong><br> It–no, he is already estranged from the Servant framework...</p><p><strong>Caster Class:</strong><br> This is technology on a cosmic scale.</p><p><strong>Zhang Jiao:</strong><br> And what is the use of telling me this?</p><p><strong>Caster Class:</strong><br> I would ask of you—to please take her place on the throne.</p><p><strong>Zhang Jiao:</strong><br> I see. I see. So I seeee.</p><p><strong>Zhang Jiao:</strong><br> You say such amusing things, young fella! So you would use this thing to carry out a rebellion?</p><p><strong>Caster Class:</strong><br> We&#39;ve already rebelled against Pan-Human History. What&#39;s one more rebellion—</p><p><strong>Zhang Jiao:</strong><br> Mm, I understand.</p><p><strong>Zhang Jiao:</strong><br> I recall you saying you served a kingdom founded in Bashu by a man of the Liu clan...</p><p><strong>Zhang Jiao:</strong><br> You&#39;d taken pains to conceal your sorcery, which you&#39;ve since formally divulged.</p><p><strong>Caster Class:</strong><br> Yes, sir.</p><p><strong>Zhang Jiao:</strong><br> Then, I have one question...</p><p><strong>Zhang Jiao:</strong><br> What do you think of Queen Kriemhild?</p><p><strong>Zhang Jiao:</strong><br> Oh, perhaps a better question would be: Do you not recognize her as a lord fit to serve?</p><p><strong>Zhang Jiao:</strong><br> Or do you perhaps serve her, acknowledging only her strength, and not her lordship?</p><p><strong>Caster Class:</strong><br> —No, I don&#39;t recognize her in either way.</p><p><strong>Zhang Jiao:</strong><br> Is that so? Then die.</p><p><strong>Caster Class:</strong><br> Wh...y...</p><p><strong>Zhang Jiao:</strong><br> It matters not whether we serve. At heart, we heroes are selfish to a fault.</p><p><strong>Zhang Jiao:</strong><br> However...you cannot say that you don&#39;t acknowledge the queen&#39;s power.</p><p><strong>Zhang Jiao:</strong><br> That would imply that you were capable of appraising her power correctly in the first place.</p><p><strong>Zhang Jiao:</strong><br> See here, you dying Caster. That thing of a woman is, to put it simply, a monster.</p><p><strong>Zhang Jiao:</strong><br> Think about it. The man she loved was murdered—</p><p><strong>Zhang Jiao:</strong><br> With single-minded purpose, she seduced a great king, took control of his soldiers, and caused a great conflagration.</p><p><strong>Zhang Jiao:</strong><br> In the end, her vengeance consumed even her own brother.</p><p><strong>Zhang Jiao:</strong><br> Upon taking up that Demonic Sword—one she shouldn&#39;t have been able to wield—she took the head of her detested target.</p><p><strong>Zhang Jiao:</strong><br> After which she herself was killed when told the act was a disgrace to a warrior, or something along those lines...</p><p><strong>Zhang Jiao:</strong><br> I should think that she ceased to care once her vengeance had been completed.</p><p><strong>Zhang Jiao:</strong><br> As long as she exacted her vengeance first, being killed did not matter.</p><p><strong>Zhang Jiao:</strong><br> In that sense, she is undoubtedly a Berserker. Yet at the same time, she retains her wits.</p><p><strong>Zhang Jiao:</strong><br> How can you be so unaware? How can you not understand?</p><p><strong>Zhang Jiao:</strong><br> Your intent to rebel had already been noticed.</p><p><strong>Zhang Jiao:</strong><br> That directive was an order to eliminate you.</p><p><strong>Caster Class:</strong><br> How...could...</p><p><strong>Zhang Jiao:</strong><br> What made you think you could move unnoticed?</p><p><strong>Zhang Jiao:</strong><br> I couldn&#39;t care less what you were planning inside your little head. You had already failed as soon as you began preparations.</p><p><strong>Zhang Jiao:</strong><br> Even until a moment ago, you were wholly unaware of how deficient they were.</p><p><strong>Zhang Jiao:</strong><br> No secure ways to communicate with comrades. No escape routes laid out in the event of failure.</p><p><strong>Zhang Jiao:</strong><br> No negotiations for admission to the Restoration or Via Regia Realms. You didn&#39;t prepare any such things, did you?</p><p><strong>Caster Class:</strong><br> That...was...</p><p><strong>Zhang Jiao:</strong><br> You&#39;ve truly underestimated our fearsome queen. Who would ever lend support to such a rebellion?</p><p><strong>Zhang Jiao:</strong><br> Honestly. Hey, everyone?</p><p><strong>Zhang Jiao:</strong><br> Do the rest of you have as little faith in me...?</p><p><strong>Zhang Jiao:</strong><br> Have I given the impression that I would betray anybody if given the chance?</p><p><strong>Assassin Class:</strong><br> To put it gently... Yes, very much so.</p><p><strong>Archer Class:</strong><br> It&#39;s a wonder that you haven&#39;t betrayed us.</p><p><strong>Saber Class:</strong><br> Hahah! Truly astonishing that you haven&#39;t!</p><p><strong>Zhang Jiao:</strong><br> Have you such little faith in your elders?</p><p><strong>Zhang Jiao:</strong><br> Ah well. Come, let us begin the 28th testing exercise.</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> All that you know, all that you try to conceal, even all that you&#39;ve unconsciously forgotten—I can find out.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Is that understood?</p><p><strong>Archer Class:</strong><br> ... Yes...</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> (Is this brainwashing?)</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> With that, I&#39;ve managed to get a rough estimate of the locations of the Revenge and Restoration Realms.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Naturally, the Via Regia Realm&#39;s location can be extrapolated from this information. It may be a bit crude, but this is how the situation looks at the moment.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> We&#39;re currently right at the center of the Singularity.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> The Revenge Realm lies to the north, while the Restoration Realm sits to the east.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> And the Via Regia Realm should therefore be located to the southwest.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> According to that Archer...</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> The other two realms have dispatched a considerable amount of spies, but are still unable to even get an overview of the city.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> In addition to their natural defenses, it appears that their fortresses have Bounded Fields weaved from myriads of different spells.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Can we even reach a place like that without a Caster?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Well, I&#39;ll see what I can do about that... Anyhow, I have a question for you, Kadoc.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> ?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> —Do you happen to like rock climbing?</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Ugh, I have a bad feeling about this...!</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> It&#39;s all right, Kadoc Zemlupus. You like rock, don&#39;t you?</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> That&#39;s a different kind of rock!! What&#39;s with the dad joke!?</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> ... ...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Kadoc.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The new director was very hurt by that implied remark on his age...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> If you want to appear young, you just need to get rid of the mustache.</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> Not in a million years!</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> All right, all right. I&#39;m sorry, okay?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Very good, that&#39;s the spirit!</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Shit, I at least need a tool. If you have a knife, Holmes, then lend it to me.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> I don&#39;t mind.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Other than that, I need some protection from the cold, and to convert this into proper mountain climbing equipment...an ice axe should do the trick...</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Well, that seems to be all.</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> Good. Fujimaru could stand to learn from those survival techniques...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Hahaha, this is where [♂ he /♀️ she] would have a gleam in [♂ his /♀️ her] eye, isn&#39;t it?</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> Well, I wouldn&#39;t force it out if it&#39;s a magecraft secret...</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Are you mocking me? I&#39;m just good with my hands.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> If you want me to teach you, I can give you instructions later.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Very well. It&#39;s time to depart.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Considering the size of this Singularity, among other things, we should reach the city in less than two days.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> All that&#39;s left is to see what points we can raise to justify rescuing [♂ Mister /♀️ Miss] Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Let us hurry.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Got it.</p><h2 id="section-7-no-i-don-t-want-your-head" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-7-no-i-don-t-want-your-head" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 7: No, I Don&#39;t Want Your Head</h2><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> —I tried on a paler shade of lipstick.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I also changed my Spiritron Dress from the flashy red to a more mature black.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> It&#39;s nothing special, and it won&#39;t mean anything will change.

Sorry, but could you put up with just some small talk?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> So lax!</p><hr><p><strong>Rider Class:</strong><br> Yeah, aren&#39;t we!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Well...actually...</p><hr><p><strong>Rider Class:</strong><br> For real?</p><p><strong>Saber Class:</strong><br> No way that&#39;s true.</p><p><strong>Archer Class:</strong><br> How the heck are you still alive?</p><p><strong>Caster Class:</strong><br> You shouldn&#39;t embellish your stories, you know. Wait, you aren&#39;t? Seriously?</p><p><strong>All:</strong><br> YEEEEEEEEAH—! KNIGHTS OF THE ROUND TAAAAAAABLE—! AWRIIIIIIIIGHT—!</p><p><strong>Salome:</strong><br> I don&#39;t quite understand the situation...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> They just got so fired up...</p><hr><p><strong>Salome:</strong><br> But, they didn&#39;t do anything bad to you, did they?</p><p><strong>Salome:</strong><br> ... In that case...</p><p><strong>Salome:</strong><br> I guess it&#39;s okay.</p><p><strong>Rider Class:</strong><br> Aah...we really are a bunch of pests, aren&#39;t we?</p><p><strong>Saber Class:</strong><br> Well, we can&#39;t just leave [♂ him /♀️ her] be, can we?</p><p><strong>Berserker Class:</strong><br> Me like when everyone make ruckus.</p><p><strong>Caster Class:</strong><br> Hey dumbass, you can stop talking like that, for one.</p><p><strong>Berserker Class:</strong><br> ...okay...</p><p><strong>Salome:</strong><br> Shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up! Who do all of you think you are, anyway!?</p><p><strong>Rider Class:</strong><br> A Rider from Sicily?</p><p><strong>Berserker Class:</strong><br> Berserker! From Europe!</p><p><strong>Saber Class:</strong><br> Isn&#39;t that a bit too vague? Same goes for me though.</p><p><strong>Archer Class:</strong><br> Me? I&#39;m a Greek Archer.</p><p><strong>Archer Class:</strong><br> Atalante?</p><p><strong>Archer Class:</strong><br> It&#39;s a bit embarrassing to be compared to someone blessed by the moon goddess Artemis herself...</p><p><strong>Lancer Class:</strong><br> Ah...I&#39;m...uh...a Lancer who wishes to remain anonymous...!</p><p><strong>Saber Class:</strong><br> Well, it&#39;s only natural to want to keep your True Name concealed.</p><p><strong>Saber Class:</strong><br> You&#39;re being awfully thorough not to give away any hints though. Anyway, my True Name is–</p><p><strong>Caster Class:</strong><br> I&#39;m an alchemist. I trust you&#39;re all well familiar with me...</p><p><strong>Rider Class:</strong><br> You&#39;re just setting yourself up for disappointment when someone inevitably says they&#39;ve never heard of you.</p><p><strong>Caster Class:</strong><br> ... I&#39;m just an everyday alchemist...</p><p><strong>Assassin Class:</strong><br> I&#39;m an Assassin, for pretty convoluted reasons.</p><p><strong>Salome:</strong><br> So, so many annoyances...</p><p><strong>Rider Class:</strong><br> Hey, at least we&#39;re under orders!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Well, why don&#39;t we all have a meal together?</p><hr><p><strong>Salome:</strong><br> W-well...if you say so...</p><p><strong>Salome:</strong><br> It&#39;s not what I would have wanted, but let&#39;s have a meal together.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Who knew you could miss rice this much...</p><hr><p><strong>Saber Class:</strong><br> The Sabers from the Orient insisted on having it.</p><p><strong>Salome:</strong><br> Is that so?</p><p><strong>Rider Class:</strong><br> They were ready to perform harakiri if they couldn&#39;t have rice.</p><p><strong>Rider Class:</strong><br> When they brought it up, Master Zhang Jiao said he didn&#39;t understand, but still made it so they could have some.</p><p><strong>Archer Class:</strong><br> Where is this being grown, anyway? Actually, if it was being grown, wouldn&#39;t it still not be ready to eat?</p><p><strong>Caster Class:</strong><br> Magecraft can&#39;t create something out nothing, but it can grant value to something which had none previously.</p><p><strong>Caster Class:</strong><br> That&#39;s well within its limits.</p><p><strong>Assassin Class:</strong><br> Meaning, he just used magecraft to speed up the process.</p><p><strong>Salome:</strong><br> ... Hey...</p><p><strong>Salome:</strong><br> Do you want some dessert?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I&#39;m still working on the meat, though...</p><hr><p><strong>Salome:</strong><br> That was then, and this is now.</p><p><strong>Salome:</strong><br> Here, have an apple, won&#39;t you?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Thanks, I will.</p><hr><p><strong>Salome:</strong><br> Open wide.</p><p><strong>Salome:</strong><br> How is it?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> It&#39;s delicious.</p><hr><p><strong>Salome:</strong><br> Isn&#39;t it? Isn&#39;t it? (Smug satisfaction)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> It&#39;s a good apple.</p><hr><p><strong>Salome:</strong><br> ... Mmph...</p><p><strong>Rider Class:</strong><br> Hey, Chaldean. Sorry to interrupt, but that scores you a big, fat zero.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Why!?</p><hr><p><strong>Assassin Class:</strong><br> Isn&#39;t this apple kinda shitty?</p><p><strong>Assassin Class:</strong><br> It still has the skin and core, and there&#39;s so little of it...</p><p><strong>Salome:</strong><br> ... ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I&#39;m sure whoever cut it...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> ...tried their very best.</p><hr><p><strong>Salome:</strong><br> ...!</p><p><strong>Archer Class:</strong><br> You think so?</p><p><strong>Salome:</strong><br> Is that so...I wonder...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> —I don&#39;t really get it.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I don&#39;t understand. There&#39;s too much I still don&#39;t know.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> No radiance of a blessed holy man. No raging force of a great victory.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Just a peaceful and inexplicably ordinary passing of time. Like a short stint spent in the sun.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Something I never once experienced at that banquet, yet something faintly familiar.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> —■■■■■aan.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I had definitely uttered that name.</p><p><strong>Caster Class:</strong><br> ... ...</p><p><strong>Saber Class:</strong><br> Well, time for us to get going.</p><p><strong>Rider Class:</strong><br> What&#39;s on today&#39;s schedule?</p><p><strong>Saber Class:</strong><br> We&#39;re scouting the Restoration Realm. They&#39;re going to work on repairing the Jovian Fort.</p><p><strong>Rider Class:</strong><br> Got it. We&#39;ll leave this to you, Lady Salome!</p><p><strong>Salome:</strong><br> Aww... I have to leave as well.</p><p><strong>Salome:</strong><br> Kriemhild is quite the taskmaster.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Take care out there.</p><hr><p><strong>Salome:</strong><br> ...!</p><p><strong>Salome:</strong><br> Y-yeah. Yes. Thank you. Thank you very much!</p><p><strong>Salome:</strong><br> I would love to hear more of your stories when I return!</p><p><strong>Seton (?):</strong><br> ...and as you can see, maybe-Seton luckily did not interrupt your little tête–à–tête.</p><p><strong>Seton (?):</strong><br> Ain&#39;t I considerate? Feel free to praise me.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Yes, how very thoughtful...</p><p><strong>Seton (?):</strong><br> Sure was, wasn&#39;t it?</p><p><strong>Seton (?):</strong><br> Well, Salome was awful cranky today.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> You&#39;re still calling yourself that?</p><p><strong>Seton (?):</strong><br> Well, it&#39;s gotten me this far, hasn&#39;t it?</p><hr><p><strong>Seton (?):</strong><br> Still, with those seven...</p><p><strong>Seton (?):</strong><br> Yeah... It might just work out.</p><p><strong>Seton (?):</strong><br> Huh? What will? Well, I wouldn&#39;t wanna disappoint you, so I&#39;ll keep my mouth shut for now!</p><p><strong>Seton (?):</strong><br> For now, just keep yourself in shape, just in case.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Guess I&#39;ll start doing some pushups!</p><p><strong>Seton (?):</strong><br> Oh, yeah! Awesome!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> All right, I&#39;ll start working my abs tomorrow!</p><p><strong>Seton (?):</strong><br> Ooh! Aweso...wait, no, not awesome!</p><p><strong>Seton (?):</strong><br> Today! Start preparing today!</p><hr><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> ...Tch!</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Phew...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Will you be all right, Kadoc?</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> I&#39;ll manage. It&#39;s a lot steeper than I imagined...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> If only that was the only problem...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Here they come! Several avian monsters are heading your way at high speed!</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> We must hurry.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> In this situation, even getting pushed off would mean game over.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> I know, but I can only hurry so much!</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> ...Good, I see a crevice! It looks quite unstable, but we can take shelter there for the time being.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> If we hold out for a while, they should give up and leave.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> I sure hope your deductions are on point, goddamnit!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> You...!</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> Ooh! What was that magecraft!?</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> It was just a flash! Not like it was an actual attack!</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> Oh...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> A commendable plan. There is no better method of dealing with wild beasts than to stun them.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> All right, Kadoc, I think we should back off a little...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Your deductions are on point today! There&#39;s a Servant signal directly above you!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Wow, it&#39;s moving so swiftly! Actually, it just disappeared!</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> Another bug!?</p><p><strong>F：???:</strong><br> Wahaha! Wahaha! Bird monster, bird monster, good birdies!</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> So noisy! And we can&#39;t do anything about it.</p><p><strong>F：???:</strong><br> But I shall not let evil pass unchecked! I can&#39;t believe you&#39;d abduct them to feed the chicks!</p><p><strong>F：???:</strong><br> Well...that&#39;s not actually that bad. Is it? I still can&#39;t overlook it! Sorry!</p><p><strong>F：???:</strong><br> Because those guys are our long-awaited guests from Paldella!</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> (Hm...Looks as though we&#39;ll have no issues. It&#39;s Chaldea, though.)</p><p><strong>F：???:</strong><br> No point arguing with birds, I&#39;ll just use my Noble Phantasm—</p><p><strong>F：???:</strong><br> “The Magic Flute that Induces Panic—La Black Luna!”</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Guh!? We&#39;re being caught up in it too!</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> This was certainly beyond my expectations...</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> (Beasts tend to be weak against loud noises after all. It&#39;s only natural that they&#39;d flee.)</p><p><strong>F：???:</strong><br> Phew, all done!</p><p><strong>F：???:</strong><br> — —</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> ... ...</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> ... ...</p><p><strong>F：???:</strong><br> —? —!</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> (I can&#39;t hear a damn thing...)</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> (So close. You&#39;re acting way too chummy. And I still can&#39;t hear anything!)</p><p><strong>F：???:</strong><br> ...!</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Wait wait wait! I&#39;m still deaf in my ears, just wait a damn second!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Ah, you there.</p><p><strong>F：???:</strong><br> Huh? Me? Whoa, a message from the future!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Ah, um. Sure... Gordolf, take it away!</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> W-wait, what! What is this all of a sudden!?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> I have a bad feeling about this! I doubt whatever I say will get through to him!</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> Huh, why&#39;s that... Ahem...</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> Uh, who exactly might you be? Are you perhaps related to the Via Regia Realm&#39;s Karl der Große?</p><p><strong>F：???:</strong></p><h1 id="astolfooooo" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#astolfooooo" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Astolfooooo!!!!</h1><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> So! Damn! Noisy!!</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> ...Hold it? Astolfo? Astolfo as in, um...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Astolfo is one of the legendary paladins of Charlemagne, a knight that even reached the moon!</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Oh...am I actually like super famous? Ufufuhihihehehe.</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> (He&#39;s famous for having no reason, though...)</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Yay. Peace, peace!</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> ...tch, ah... I can finally hear again...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Hm, the Heroic Spirit Astolfo.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Was that True Name release earlier the horn with which you once drove away harpies?</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Yep! That thing is really useful for getting rid of demonic beasts.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> If I really blow it as hard as I can, even an entire army would panic. Anyway...um...it&#39;s amazing!</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> I see. By the way, we&#39;re—</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Ah, don&#39;t worry about introductions! You guys are from Caldera, right?</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Huh? You&#39;re not? Are you aliens?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Hahaha. We are from Chaldea, yes. My name is Sherlock Holmes.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> This is Kadoc Zemlupus, an allied mage.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Glad to meet you!</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Oh, but I already said hi just now... Huh? You couldn&#39;t hear anything? Why not?</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> ... Was it my fault...!?</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Absolutely.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Aww, sorry about that. But well, it&#39;s better than becoming their snack, you know.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> You&#39;d have only lasted three minutes on that foothold.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> So really, it may have been my fault, but it actually wasn&#39;t!</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> ...Huh? So which is it, then?</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Nah, don&#39;t worry about. It&#39;s not like there were any lasting side effects.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Yep! Probably not!</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> “Probably”?</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Did you just say “probably”...?</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> A-anyway—good people of Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> We of the Via Regia Realm (I don&#39;t really get it though) have been awaiting your arrival.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> (I don&#39;t really get it though.) If you would, follow me!</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> (Do you think we can trust him?)</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> (If my reasoning is correct, there should be no problem for the time being.)</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> (There are one or two minor issues, however.)</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Oh, but please don&#39;t blab about our stuff to the other realms, okay?</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> You wouldn&#39;t want to make a knight cry.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> You&#39;re gonna cry about it?</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Not me, Roland will.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Ah, I thought he&#39;d be here...</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Of course. This is the Realm of Karl der Große, after all! Hahaha!</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Oh yeah, he wanders around naked sometimes, but don&#39;t worry about it.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Got it.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> ... ...</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Wait, naked?</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Eh, you didn&#39;t know?</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> I thought Roland would at least be famous for his naturism.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Yes, yes, he&#39;s certainly famous, I know that! But! For real!</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> This and that are totally different things!</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> I guess that&#39;s true... It would probably seem disgraceful to a lady&#39;s eyes.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Hm...some kinda...censor bar...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> (He&#39;s saying nothing but ominous stuff...! What should we do, Da Vinci?)</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> (I&#39;m totally okay with this. A hero&#39;s naked body? Nice. Very nice...)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> (I forgot, Da Vinci did lean that way!)</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Well, anyway.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> I&#39;ll try and stop him from doing anything too unsightly!</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Let&#39;s get going already!</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Okay, let&#39;s go...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Mhm.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> By the way, Kadoc. About the hero Astolfo.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Right.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> As one of Charlemagne&#39;s Twelve Paladins, I didn&#39;t expect him to have such a jovial personality.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> There are all sorts of insane legends about him, but one is of particular importance right now.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> O-oh?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> It is a story titled “Orlando Furioso”.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> In it, Astolfo travelled to the moon to recover Roland&#39;s reason.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> In the process, he actually regained the reason that he himself had lost. However, it was once again gone by the time he returned.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Essentially...the hero Astolfo is one devoid of reason.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> I knew that much already, but I do have a bad feeling about this. We&#39;ll have to continue this later...!</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Indeed.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Our hero has already ridden off on his mount and forgotten all about us!</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Let&#39;s do our best to catch up!</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Seriously.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> A-Astolfo is pulling away from you at a tremendous speed!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I can only gauge the direction, so please hurry up!</p><p><strong>Both:</strong><br> Whoaaaaaaaa!</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> (That&#39;s not something you&#39;d normally hear from them...)</p><p><strong>Nemo Marine:</strong><br> It&#39;ll make a good memory, so I&#39;ll record it.</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> I&#39;ve arriiiived!</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Or, wait... I think I&#39;ve forgotten something...</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> ... ...</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Couldn&#39;t have been important then!</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong></p><h1 id="it-definitely-was" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#it-definitely-was" aria-hidden="true">#</a> It definitely was!</h1><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> ...! (I remember now.)</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Sorry about that...</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> It&#39;s fine and all to be sorry. Just...for now...</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Need...water...</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Okay, I&#39;ll bring all the fruit water you can drink!</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Phew...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Sure enough, it is a strain to run at full speed wearing clothes of this character.</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> Mm. Truly a sight to have beheld.</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> Now then. So this is the realm which Karl der Große rules...</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> And yet...</p><p><strong>Saber Class:</strong><br> Come on!</p><p><strong>Saber Class:</strong><br> Start calisthenics! One, two, three, four... five, six, seven, eight.</p><p><strong>Archer Class:</strong><br> Make sure you line those stamps up right.</p><p><strong>Caster Class:</strong><br> Come on in! Vegetables at a good price! Cabbage! Get your cabbage!</p><p><strong>Caster Class:</strong><br> Why am I selling vegetables? I was a mage who studied under Paracelsus!</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> Isn&#39;t this too picturesque? What&#39;s with this place?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> This is probably the will of Karl der Große. His subordinates also seem inclined to follow suit.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Not exactly how I pictured it.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> In my head, I kept thinking it&#39;d be the kind of realm that constantly marches out and conquers.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> The military facilities are most likely concealed. In any case, a thorough blockade of information is in effect.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Whaa, here you go. Sorry about that, honestly.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> ?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Now I see...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Had you simply forgotten, it fails to explain that breakneck pace.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Not to mention, is that your usual means of transport?</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> I don&#39;t follow what you&#39;re saying, Administrative Advisor.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> In order to avoid exposing the location of this realm, Astolfo presumably goes through that exact routine when returning.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Forgetting us was incidental, but that maximum speed seems to be a habit of his.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Wow, you&#39;re definitely the great detective. But that&#39;s still not any excuse for forgetting you.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> So you had to move as fast as you could either way?</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Yeah, that&#39;s right. Okay, let&#39;s pay a visit to His Majesty!</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Follow me, follow me! Yahooey!!</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Now, are you in an appropriate frame of mind?</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Sure am...</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> I&#39;ve already conveyed this to you both, but just a reminder...</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> If the comm is forcibly shut down, Holmes will negotiate.</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> In the event our Master is requested to speak over a Servant, Kadoc will speak in [♂ his /♀️ her] stead.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> I got it. I&#39;m not about to push my own assertions.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> I don&#39;t even have a horse in this race anymore. I&#39;ll play the proxy negotiator part right.</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> Ah, I nearly forgot, one other thing—</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> And so the transmission is cut off, as expected. Well, it&#39;s only natural for a lord&#39;s fortress.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Then, we&#39;ll proceed as planned.</p><p><strong>Saber Class:</strong><br> Your Majesty, I bring livers of demonic beasts as gifts to replenish magical energy for your royal guards.</p><p><strong>E：Karl der Große:</strong><br> ...See to it.</p><p><strong>F：???:</strong><br> His Majesty has asked you to distribute one to each royal guard present.</p><p><strong>Saber Class:</strong><br> Understood.</p><p><strong>Rider Class:</strong><br> Today&#39;s patrol report.</p><p><strong>Rider Class:</strong><br> There were four instances of brawling between Servants. Noble Phantasms were used in three of them.</p><p><strong>E：Karl der Große:</strong><br> ...Punish them.</p><p><strong>F：???:</strong><br> His Majesty hereby seals the Noble Phantasm on each of those who used theirs.</p><p><strong>F：???:</strong><br> The matters of those who did not are considered closed, he says.</p><p><strong>F：???:</strong><br> Restraint from using their Noble Phantasm is the same as demonstrating their good reason.</p><p><strong>Rider Class:</strong><br> Yes, Your Majesty!</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Your Majesty.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Over here. One of your Twelve Paladins, Astolfo.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> I&#39;ve brought all of the you-know-whos.</p><p><strong>E：Karl der Große:</strong><br> ...!</p><p><strong>F：???:</strong><br> His Majesty has ordered all to clear the room. Every royal guard is also ordered to leave.</p><p><strong>Royal Guard:</strong><br> But—</p><p><strong>F：???:</strong><br> There is no problem. They are not a threat, nor do they have the strength to fight.</p><p><strong>Royal Guard:</strong><br> ...By your command!</p><p><strong>F：???:</strong><br> Astolfo, well done for having received them.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Oh no, it was no trouble at all!</p><p><strong>F：???:</strong><br> —Now then. Servant, Sherlock Holmes...</p><p><strong>F：???:</strong><br> What is the purpose of your visit to the Via Regia Realm?</p><p><strong>F：???:</strong><br> That is my question. But perhaps I should be asking you, instead.</p><p><strong>F：???:</strong><br> Not the Servant, but his Master.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> (Yeah, this was obviously bound to happen if they know Holmes&#39; True Name...)</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Kadoc Zemlupus.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Though I am a Master, I only act as substitute. I don&#39;t have a contract with Holmes.</p><p><strong>F：???:</strong><br> I see.</p><p><strong>F：???:</strong><br> In which case, the proper Master of Chaldea was the one they captured.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> That&#39;s right.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Our first priority over all others is to rescue Master Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> We would ask you to cooperate in this matter. Naturally, we will pay any reasonable price.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> But the rescue operation must take priority.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> We are aware that [♂ he /♀️ she] is being held in the Revenge Realm, but nothing else beyond that.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> How shall you answer?</p><p><strong>E：Karl der Große:</strong><br> ...Hm.</p><p><strong>F：???:</strong><br> His Majesty demands total submission to this realm in return.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> (There&#39;s the total submission. Normally, that&#39;s something we&#39;d flat-out reject, but...)</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Understood. We agree to the terms.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Provided that I may offer an opinion...</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> I don&#39;t think Karl der Große would tell us to resign ourselves to certain death.</p><p><strong>F：???:</strong><br> I see, so you assumed as much? Did Mister Holmes instruct you to say that?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Hopefully, that much can be excused.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> It is not too difficult for me to imagine which questions will be posed upon our arrival here.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> You should have expected that. Ahahahaha!</p><p><strong>E：Karl der Große:</strong><br> ...Mm.</p><p><strong>F：???:</strong><br> Very well, says His Majesty.</p><p><strong>F：???:</strong><br> In deference to those who conquered more than five Lostbelts, ye greatest of stargazers.</p><p><strong>F：???:</strong><br> And in anticipation of your hard work, first we will see to the Master&#39;s—</p><p><strong>F：???:</strong><br> To Fujimaru&#39;s rescue.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Can it be done?</p><p><strong>F：???:</strong><br> Only with the befitting sacrifices required. Now, Minerva, go forth.</p><p><strong>Minerva:</strong><br> Hoo...hoo...</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> (Was that...Minerva from Olympus? Its shape was pretty different...but there&#39;s no mistaking it.)</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> (How did a Lostbelt&#39;s technology get to this Singularity...?)</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> (Never mind, let&#39;s leave that aside for now. There&#39;s more important matters at hand.)</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Just a second. Where is that owl heading off to...?</p><p><strong>F：???:</strong><br> To grant the wish of Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> It&#39;s already heading for the rescue?</p><p><strong>F：???:</strong><br> Some say that there&#39;s no time like the present, do they not?</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Well, sure. But, how?</p><p><strong>F：???:</strong><br> The Revenge Realm has a number of Via Regia Servants planted in secret.</p><p><strong>F：???:</strong><br> It is inconvenient to gather information from here, given the state of the natural defenses around the stronghold...</p><p><strong>F：???:</strong><br> That task is instead fulfilled by gaining intelligence on the Restoration Realm via the Revenge Realm, where security is lax.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> I see.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> By using the Revenge Realm as a relay, it is possible to gain intelligence on the Restoration Realm.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> But, when it comes to getting them out—</p><p><strong>E：Karl der Große:</strong><br> ...Hm.</p><p><strong>F：???:</strong><br> Karl der Große has spoken. There will be inevitable sacrifices.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> (Whoa, come on. Aren&#39;t the costs too high on their end?)</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> (Our only toll is total submission, even if such a thing is what&#39;s expected of us.)</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> (To begin with, it might be possible to renege on our promise after the rescue operation.)</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> (We haven&#39;t even signed a contract or anything either, like a self-Geas scroll.)</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> (Or is there some kind of mechanism throughout the land, like in the sixth Lostbelt, the Fairy Kingdom?)</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> (No...I&#39;ll have to drop this train of thought. Leave the speculations to Holmes.)</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> (For the moment, both deceit and the truth are left at the door. We took on the rescue plan as an objective fact. Progress comes first.)</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> We are deeply grateful for the consideration which Karl der Große has given us.</p><p><strong>E：Karl der Große:</strong><br> ...Mm!</p><p><strong>F：???:</strong><br> Then we will happily arrange accommodations for the two of you.</p><p><strong>F：???:</strong><br> Please rest your bodies there for the time being.</p><p><strong>F：???:</strong><br> It will most likely take two days to return here from the time the operation is initiated.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Okay, I&#39;ll show them around!</p><p><strong>F：???:</strong><br> Please do.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Oh, one moment. There was one last question.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> It&#39;s a pity indeed that we could not look upon the countenance of Karl der Große...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> But who are you that serves as his adjutant? Miss—</p><p><strong>F：???:</strong><br> Oh, I am just serving as secretary.</p><p><strong>F：???:</strong><br> Merely a secretary who performed some middling heroic deeds around Spain.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> I understand. Thank you very much.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Hey, it&#39;s tour time!</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Then if you&#39;ll excuse us, Karl der Große.</p><p><strong>E：Karl der Große:</strong><br> ...Hm.</p><p><strong>F：???:</strong><br> Phew...I don&#39;t like that detective one bit.</p><p><strong>E：???:</strong><br> Oh, are you all right?</p><p><strong>F：???:</strong><br> Hehehe.</p><p><strong>F：???:</strong><br> Our secret has gone to sh—pardon me. He probably pieced together quite a bit about our ruse.</p><p><strong>F：???:</strong><br> I don&#39;t think our True Names are at risk of being exposed, but he would have narrowed down the possibilities considerably.</p><p><strong>F：???:</strong><br> Was it a mistake in the end to bring out Minerva there, after all?</p><p><strong>E：???:</strong><br> Regardless...we are in Chaldea&#39;s debt. We have to repay them.</p><p><strong>E：???:</strong><br> No matter the cost.</p><p><strong>F：???:</strong><br> I don&#39;t think we owe them any favors or gratitude, personally...</p><p><strong>E：???:</strong><br> It&#39;s purely a one-sided debt. A one-sided attitude...</p><p><strong>E：???:</strong><br> I just ask that you bear with me.</p><p><strong>F：???:</strong><br> Yes, of course. Whatever task you would have me undertake, your grace, I will accept.</p><p><strong>E：???:</strong><br> I appreciate that...</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> —A new day.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> As usual, I&#39;m bringing [♂ him /♀️ her] food today.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I remembered that humans need to eat three times a day.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Which means that we would inevitably cross paths three times a day.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> How didn&#39;t I realize something so obvious?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> With my spirits high, I prepare a meal for him.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Jokanaan, Jokanaan.

Maybe the other Servants are still unaware!</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> —Notice to all.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Servants of the 1st Scouting Unit have broken the Master out of jail.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Kill them all, no matter the cost. Yes, that includes the Master.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> That would be preferable, I suppose, to letting the enemy have [♂ him /♀️ her].</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> I offer a Zhang Jiao-made strengthening Mystic Code as reward for whoever kills them.</p><p><strong>Rider Class:</strong><br> Damn...it...! Kriemhild...!</p><p><strong>Rider Class:</strong><br> What a nightmare!</p><p><strong>Rider Class:</strong><br> Caster! Use any magecraft you can! Whatever&#39;s fine, as long as it distracts!</p><p><strong>Rider Class:</strong><br> Saber and Lancer, can the castle gate be destroyed by your Noble Phantasms if it&#39;s already been shut?</p><p><strong>Saber Class:</strong><br> Don&#39;t be ridiculous. It&#39;s not like we&#39;re packing Holy Swords or Lances.</p><p><strong>Rider Class:</strong><br> Then I&#39;ll have to haul the Master in my chariot! It&#39;s a race against time until the Assassins sent our way catch up!</p><p><strong>Both:</strong><br> Understood!</p><p><strong>G：Saber Class:</strong><br> There they are!</p><p><strong>Rider Class:</strong><br> Let&#39;s move, Master!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Salome, come with us!</p><hr><p><strong>Salome:</strong><br> Huh? Ah, yes. I will!</p><p><strong>Rider Class:</strong><br> Kid, you can summon Servants, right!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I...probably can!</p><hr><p><strong>Rider Class:</strong><br> Okay, I&#39;ll trust you on that. We&#39;ve got three Servants in our path already.</p><p><strong>Rider Class:</strong><br> It&#39;ll be real bad if we don&#39;t settle the fight quickly. Give it your all!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Rider Class:</strong><br> Yeah, I knew you could do it! You all right...?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Sorry, that might be too much for me...!</p><hr><p><strong>Salome:</strong><br> (Cough!)</p><p><strong>Rider Class:</strong><br> Salome? Is something wrong with you too?</p><p><strong>Salome:</strong><br> ...Never mind me. We should go.</p><p><strong>Rider Class:</strong><br> The gates...yes, they&#39;re not closed yet! Let&#39;s move!</p><p><strong>Saber Class:</strong><br> Lancer!</p><p><strong>Lancer Class:</strong><br> Yeah, right behind you—!?</p><p><strong>Saber Class:</strong><br> What&#39;s this!?</p><p><strong>Lancer Class:</strong><br> My foot&#39;s been ensnared! Go! Leave me behind!</p><p><strong>Archer Class:</strong><br> I&#39;ll also stay behind to buy time. Go!</p><p><strong>Saber Class:</strong><br> ...Thank you!</p><p><strong>J：Saber Class:</strong><br> ...Surround them!</p><p><strong>Lancer Class:</strong><br> You shall not pass...!</p><p><strong>Archer Class:</strong><br> Damn you...!</p><p><strong>Archer Class:</strong><br> Kh...!</p><p><strong>Royal Guard:</strong><br> Too slow.</p><p><strong>Archer Class:</strong><br> Gah...!</p><p><strong>Lancer Class:</strong><br> Archer!</p><p><strong>Lancer Class:</strong><br> By the honor of my chivalric order...I swear... My name is—</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> Silence, peon.</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> Do not name yourself a knight if you can be defeated by a mere queen. A knight must be far more noble and mighty.</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> The same goes for all you royal guards.</p><p><strong>Royal Guard:</strong><br> Yes!</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> They escaped through the gates? Very well.</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> I&#39;m pursuing... Follow me. Fetch my horse.</p><p><strong>Saber Class:</strong><br> Confirming Lancer has vanished. Doesn&#39;t seem like we&#39;re in the clear, even with the gates behind us.</p><p><strong>Rider Class:</strong><br> I know that!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Sorry...everyone...</p><hr><p><strong>Salome:</strong><br> What are you apologizing for?</p><p><strong>Salome:</strong><br> These people have yet to do anything right by you.</p><p><strong>Salome:</strong><br> You were basically forced to break out. I may not be very clever, but...</p><p><strong>Salome:</strong><br> Even I know there&#39;s no way you could have refused in that situation.</p><p><strong>Rider Class:</strong><br> ... ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Even then, I had to escape at some point.</p><hr><p><strong>Salome:</strong><br> Maybe you&#39;re right...but I don&#39;t think there&#39;s anything you should apologize for.</p><p><strong>Rider Class:</strong><br> She&#39;s right. You shouldn&#39;t feel obligated to.</p><p><strong>Rider Class:</strong><br> It&#39;s just, to fulfill our orders—that being, rescuing you...</p><p><strong>Rider Class:</strong><br> It&#39;s worthwhile to risk our pitiful lives.</p><p><strong>Rider Class:</strong><br> Give me a pauper&#39;s grave. That&#39;s what I believe in.</p><p><strong>Caster Class:</strong><br> Here&#39;s where I leave you. I&#39;ll make use of some greater magecraft.</p><p><strong>Caster Class:</strong><br> It will turn this entire plain into a swamp. That should buy you plenty of time.</p><p><strong>Rider Class:</strong><br> We trust in you.</p><p><strong>Salome:</strong><br> Be careful.</p><p><strong>Caster Class:</strong><br> Sure.</p><p><strong>Caster Class:</strong><br> “Metamorphosis. Slowly does the earth sink and give rise to sea. With peace doth the moments tick away.”</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> The magecraft used by the Caster essentially wrought water out of the soil.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Except, they deliberately exercised it on a wider scale, transforming the entire vicinity into a vast swamp.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> In turn, all the affected terrain itself was also sprawling.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> It may have only been a temporary measure, but it would be enough to halt pursuers in their tracks.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> —However.</p><p><strong>Zhang Jiao:</strong><br> Ah, the naivety of one&#39;s youth.</p><p><strong>Caster Class:</strong><br> Wha...!?</p><p><strong>Zhang Jiao:</strong><br> Firstly, this kind of technique can only be broken through the practitioner&#39;s death. Therefore, concealing oneself must come first.</p><p><strong>Zhang Jiao:</strong><br> Secondly, if the enemy has a Caster, it&#39;s a given that the effective winner will be whoever waits to see the other&#39;s move.</p><p><strong>Zhang Jiao:</strong><br> Thirdly, my being here meant there was never a way this technique would work.</p><p><strong>Caster Class:</strong><br> ...I was in error...from the very first move...</p><p><strong>Zhang Jiao:</strong><br> —Regardless, you did pull me out of the formation to chase after you.</p><p><strong>Zhang Jiao:</strong><br> In that at least, you nameless Caster, you have my compliments.</p><p><strong>Assassin Class:</strong><br> Reporting in!</p><p><strong>Assassin Class:</strong><br> Havoc has broken out around the Gate of Retribution! It seems we have another fugitive escaping from the jail...!</p><p><strong>Zhang Jiao:</strong><br> Oh? That Servant inferior to even a Caster?</p><p><strong>Assassin Class:</strong><br> Yes, sir.</p><p><strong>Assassin Class:</strong><br> Somehow, he&#39;d prepared an offensive Mystic Code beforehand...</p><p><strong>Assassin Class:</strong><br> There&#39;s mayhem from the loud explosions and lights, not to mention the Servants panicking from what seemed like an enemy assault.</p><p><strong>Zhang Jiao:</strong><br> No sense in dwelling on it...</p><p><strong>Zhang Jiao:</strong><br> Very well, Your Majesty, I shall briefly take my leave on my puppet palanquin...</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> You&#39;ve been sedentary. Wouldn&#39;t it be better to run there on your own two feet?</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> In the interest of your health.</p><p><strong>Zhang Jiao:</strong><br> Hwah hwah hwah. An old sack asketh much patching, as they say.</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> Indeed. Follow the example of your elders, you listless Archer. Get ready to play your role.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Oh-kay. Well, I&#39;ll only shoot when I&#39;m told to.</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong><br> I have picked up their scent, my queen.</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong><br> They&#39;re heading in a different direction than the Restoration Realm.</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> The Via Regia Realm, then. We&#39;ll eliminate them before they can escape.</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> By no means can they leave this realm alive. Is that understood?</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong><br> As you command.</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> That bird just now...?</p><hr><p><strong>Rider Class:</strong><br> Yeah, looks like we lost Caster too. I guess he couldn&#39;t hold out for that long.</p><p><strong>Salome:</strong><br> —Hey, do you mind if I ask you something?</p><p><strong>Salome:</strong><br> Why are you so eager to put your lives on the line for just one person?</p><p><strong>Rider Class:</strong><br> That&#39;s what our orders are! Besides...</p><p><strong>Rider Class:</strong><br> It feels wrong to hate [♂ him /♀️ her] so much when [♂ he /♀️ she]&#39;s not even so bad.</p><p><strong>Rider Class:</strong><br> Isn&#39;t it only natural to want to get someone out of a place like that?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...Thanks.</p><hr><p><strong>Rider Class:</strong><br> Nah, don&#39;t mention it.</p><p><strong>Salome:</strong><br> Was it really that difficult an experience...?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> A bit...</p><p><strong>Salome:</strong><br> Oh. I&#39;m sorry, I didn&#39;t realize.</p><p><strong>Salome:</strong><br> I suppose it really is hard—to be hated, that is.</p><p><strong>Salome:</strong><br> I don&#39;t really get it, but I guess that&#39;s just how the world is.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> You&#39;re fun to spend time with, Salome.</p><p><strong>Salome:</strong><br> You think so!?</p><p><strong>Salome:</strong><br> That&#39;s wonderful. I&#39;m so glad.</p><p><strong>Salome:</strong><br> It makes me so happy to hear you say that.</p><hr><p><strong>Saber Class:</strong><br> ...! Rider! Get down!</p><p><strong>Rider Class:</strong><br> Ggh!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Are you okay!?</p><hr><p><strong>Rider Class:</strong><br> Y-yeah. I&#39;ll be—ggh!</p><p><strong>Saber Class:</strong><br> Poison...!</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong><br> Naturally. We are an Assassin, after all. Now suffer in your death.</p><p><strong>Saber Class:</strong><br> If it&#39;s just an Assassin...!</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong><br> Rifler.</p><p><strong>Saber Class:</strong><br> !</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong><br> This is what we are truly capable of. Your judgement was poor, Saber.</p><p><strong>Saber Class:</strong><br> D-damn...you—!</p><p><strong>E：Hundred Personas:</strong><br> !?</p><p><strong>E：Hundred Personas:</strong><br> Thousand Leagues, Geographer, and Poison Taster have been lost. However—</p><p><strong>E：Hundred Personas:</strong><br> The single Rider on the enemy side has already been poisoned.</p><p><strong>E：Hundred Personas:</strong><br> Lady Salome. Please stop this nonsense.</p><p><strong>Salome:</strong><br> You guys...are not Jokanaan.</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong><br> ?</p><p><strong>Salome:</strong><br> Nobody but him may give me orders.</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong><br> E-evade!!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> —This feeling—this pounding—in my chest. It is surely nothing more than the usual fits of emotion.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> But I still have just enough self-control to assert it—that [♂ he /♀️ she] is not Jokanaan.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I just need to tell myself to put up with it for a little longer...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Deep breaths, one after another. I—I have to use my last resort.</p><p><strong>Salome:</strong><br> Fujimaru. No...Master.</p><p><strong>Salome:</strong><br> Please, command me. Command me to strike down our enemy!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I&#39;m counting on you, Salome!</p><hr><p><strong>Salome:</strong><br> Yes...yes! I will—I shall stand by your side!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong><br> I was convinced no mission could entice our heart...</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong><br> Yet, against all odds, we have fallen corrupt... We... rebels to... Pan-Human History... Agh...</p><p><strong>Salome:</strong><br> It felt like this Assassin was holding back...</p><p><strong>Salome:</strong><br> Let&#39;s get moving. We need to get as far away as we can—</p><p><strong>Salome:</strong><br> Ggh....</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Salome!</p><hr><p><strong>Salome:</strong><br> Don&#39;t mind me. I&#39;m fine. How about you, Rider?</p><p><strong>Rider Class:</strong><br> I&#39;m good... Gotta keep going... Shit, I can&#39;t bring out my chariot...</p><p><strong>Rider Class:</strong><br> Let&#39;s go...by foot... I&#39;ll show you...the way...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> (Carry his arm around my shoulders)</p><hr><p><strong>Rider Class:</strong><br> Sorry...</p><p><strong>Salome:</strong><br> I&#39;ll carry him. He&#39;s too heavy for a human Master to bother with.</p><p><strong>Salome:</strong><br> Come on, we need to run.</p><p><strong>Salome:</strong><br> Kriemhild is not so generous as to let us escape so easily...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Run, run, run. She&#39;s more tenacious and inescapable than any snake.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> She&#39;ll keep pursuing [♂ him /♀️ her].</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I look ahead, shouldering a Servant I don&#39;t know the name of.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> [♂ He /♀️ She] keeps fighting, finding new paths forward, never hesitating.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Ah, the very image of a saint.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I can&#39;t stop yearning for [♂ him /♀️ her], no matter how much I tell myself I shouldn&#39;t.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> It&#39;s beyond my control. If I was doing it by choice, I&#39;d hate myself so much I&#39;d immediately kill myself upon being summoned.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I can&#39;t stop seeking or desiring Jokanaan.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> That&#39;s what makes Salome a Berserker.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Whether siding with the Human Order or rebelling against it, that&#39;s the one thing I won&#39;t take no as an answer for.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> —That&#39;s why Kriemhild had no doubts. She was sure I would find Jokanaan in [♂ him /♀️ her].</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I can tell. That&#39;s why I shouldn&#39;t have gone with [♂ him /♀️ her].</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I should have gone no further than silent prayers for a safe escape. That would certainly have been enough for my love to burn out.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> That kykeon was the final straw. I should have thrown it in the trash instead of eating it.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I ate, then deserted my realm. I can&#39;t imagine a more lethal blow than that single dish.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Love, love, and love. Or: dreams, splendor, and journey.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> And despite all this, [♂ he /♀️ she] won&#39;t even turn around to face me.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> It&#39;s always straight ahead with [♂ him /♀️ her]. Always facing the correct direction.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Yes. That&#39;s how I like it. That&#39;s what makes you so lovely. That&#39;s the true you.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I know that at the end of this journey, you won&#39;t even remember me,</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> despite all this love I have for you.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I love you, so may I have your head?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> What do you say, Jokanaan? Jokanaan, Jokanaan, Jokanaan!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Oh, I can&#39;t hold myself any longer. I even went into a Master contract, which was meant to be my last resort.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Is it not working because the contract is provisory? Would I be fine if it were more long-term?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Would I be able to tell that you&#39;re not my prophet if I just stuck around you for a little longer?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I don&#39;t know. This doesn&#39;t feel real. I can&#39;t perceive it.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I can withstand any pain, but not love.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> That&#39;s just the way I am.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> My urges are unbearable and taxing. Because of them, I am evil.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Even recognizing all that, I can&#39;t do a thing to stop them.</p><p><strong>Salome:</strong><br> —!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Salome?</p><hr><p><strong>Salome:</strong><br> I&#39;m fine... Don&#39;t worry about me.</p><p><strong>Rider Class:</strong><br> Just a little more. We&#39;re nearly at the rendezvous with our Assassin—</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Rider Class:</strong><br> Hey, Assassin!</p><p><strong>Assassin Class:</strong><br> ... ...</p><p><strong>Rider Class:</strong><br> This is as far as I can go. Sorry, Assassin. The rest is up to you—</p><p><strong>Assassin Class:</strong><br> Ru...n.</p><p><strong>Rider Class:</strong><br> It&#39;s a trap...!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Get down!</p><hr><p><strong>Salome:</strong><br> Master! Oh no, you&#39;re bleeding so much...!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Aaaaaargh!</p><hr><p><strong>Royal Guard:</strong><br> It worked! Finish [♂ him /♀️ her] off!</p><p><strong>Salome:</strong><br> —What do you think you&#39;re doing?</p><p><strong>Royal Guard:</strong><br> Salome! I heard you betrayed us...but to think that was true!</p><p><strong>Salome:</strong><br> Unforgivable! [♂ He /♀️ She]&#39;s my Jokanaan!</p><p><strong>Royal Guard:</strong><br> !</p><p><strong>Salome:</strong><br> Watch me closely, Master. I&#39;m going to tear them to shreds...!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Royal Guard:</strong><br> Damn... But...mission accomplished...!</p><p><strong>Salome:</strong><br> Phew, we did it, Master! Master...?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I...can&#39;t...</p><hr><p><strong>Salome:</strong><br> Master! Master!</p><p><strong>Salome:</strong><br> Hold on, Master! Don&#39;t leave me! Please!</p><p><strong>Rider Class:</strong><br> Salo...me...</p><p><strong>Salome:</strong><br> I&#39;m sorry. I&#39;m so sorry. I should have been faster.</p><p><strong>Rider Class:</strong><br> Salome!</p><p><strong>Salome:</strong><br> !</p><p><strong>Rider Class:</strong><br> Hurry, get out of here. I&#39;m about to...disappear...</p><p><strong>Rider Class:</strong><br> The Via Regia Realm is...not far...beyond this forest.</p><p><strong>Rider Class:</strong><br> I&#39;m going to...shoot my Noble Phantasm...at the sky...</p><p><strong>Rider Class:</strong><br> As a signal. Let&#39;s hope...they get the message...</p><p><strong>Salome:</strong><br> But...! What about you?</p><p><strong>Rider Class:</strong><br> It&#39;s for the sake of the mission... Listen...get out of here right now...</p><p><strong>Rider Class:</strong><br> It&#39;s all...up to you...from here. I beg you...keep yourself together.</p><p><strong>Rider Class:</strong><br> That human...is not your Jokanaan.</p><p><strong>Salome:</strong><br> ... I know that...</p><p><strong>Rider Class:</strong><br> If you do, then go... Go!</p><p><strong>Rider Class:</strong><br> Damn...I don&#39;t wanna...die...</p><p><strong>Rider Class:</strong><br> I don&#39;t wanna die... But my life is a small price to pay...</p><p><strong>Rider Class:</strong><br> Shatter, my Spiritual Core! Inherit my will, Human Order!</p><p><strong>Rider Class:</strong><br> Releasing Noble Phantasm—</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> A golden beam of light reaches for the skies behind me.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> The light is very weak, as one would expect. Nothing comparable to the proud Holy Swords and Demonic Spears of seasoned heroes.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> But it is without a doubt the purest glimmer any ordinary warrior could muster.</p><p><strong>Salome:</strong><br> We have to hurry...!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I run, unconcerned by the flash.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Needless to say, our Revenge Realm pursuers also noticed the light.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> And we move so slowly that they could catch up to us at any moment.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Master is injured... [♂ He /♀️ She]&#39;s breathing. [♂ He /♀️ She] has a clear pulse.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> [♂ He /♀️ She] wasn&#39;t poisoned like Rider. [♂ He /♀️ She]&#39;s just bleeding heavily.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I need to stop the bleeding, but I also can&#39;t stop running to do so.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I realize the hopelessness of the situation.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I don&#39;t even know how to treat a bleeding wound.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Manifesting as a Servant granted me a fair share of knowledge, but there&#39;s still a lot I don&#39;t know.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> A girl who did nothing but receive love her whole life never learned how to treat wounds.</p><p><strong>Salome:</strong><br> It&#39;s okay. You&#39;re alive. You&#39;re can&#39;t die here. Because you&#39;re...you&#39;re Jokanaan.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Joka...?</p><hr><p><strong>Salome:</strong><br> Ah... Sorry, that doesn&#39;t matter now.</p><p><strong>Salome:</strong><br> We have to hurry! I know it hurts, but just hold on a little longer...!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I must hurry. Before it&#39;s too late.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I can&#39;t let myself keep seeing [♂ him /♀️ her] struggle. I can&#39;t let myself keep feeling [♂ his /♀️ her] nobility.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I must control myself before I turn into a loving monster—</p><p><strong>Salome:</strong><br> —Ah.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Our eyes, they met.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> [♂ His /♀️ Her] positive, earnest, and sincere eyes pierced mine when I wasn&#39;t prepared.</p><p><strong>Salome:</strong><br> —Jokanaan.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Joka...?</p><hr><p><strong>Salome:</strong><br> Jokanaan, please.</p><p><strong>Salome:</strong><br> I have a favor to ask.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I&#39;m slipping into a nightmarish delirium.</p><p><strong>Salome:</strong><br> Please listen to me, my love.</p><p><strong>Salome:</strong><br> May I...</p><p><strong>Salome:</strong><br> —May I...have your...head?</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I innocently await [♂ his /♀️ her] answer.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I wait for [♂ his /♀️ her] pain-addled mind to make [♂ his /♀️ her] choice.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Say yes or say no—I&#39;ll sever [♂ his /♀️ her] head regardless.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Jokanaan, Jokanaan, Jokanaan!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> How could I, loving you so much, not notice you this close to me?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Let me hear your last words.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I&#39;m a Servant. I am power. Face me.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Reject me without falter. Or offer a prayer to God.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Will you be smiling at the very end, or admonishing me with a serious countenance?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Either is fine. As long as you&#39;re Jokanaan.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> What&#39;s your answer? What&#39;s your answer, my dear?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I still...want to live.</p><hr><p><strong>Salome:</strong><br> —What?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Don&#39;t kill me.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I don&#39;t wanna die.</p><hr><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> My friends are waiting for me...!</p><hr><p><strong>Salome:</strong><br> What? What? What? What?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> [♂ He /♀️ She]&#39;s begging for [♂ his /♀️ her] life. This can&#39;t be.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Jokanaan wouldn&#39;t do that. No holy man would do that.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> They would ask for their deaths to be noble and sublime, or they would convince me to let them live through incorruptible reason.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Above all, saints don&#39;t fear death.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Choosing life or death is just matter of picking which would stain their soul less.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> But [♂ he /♀️ she]&#39;s begging for [♂ his /♀️ her] life. With pleading eyes, [♂ he /♀️ she] says that [♂ he /♀️ she] wants to live.</p><p><strong>Salome:</strong><br> ... Of...course.</p><p><strong>Salome:</strong><br> You...weren&#39;t...Jokanaan.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I don&#39;t care anymore. [♂ He /♀️ She]&#39;s worthless. I have no reason to help [♂ him /♀️ her].</p><p><strong>Salome:</strong><br> Sorry about that. Let&#39;s keep moving... Master.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> My legs feel more invigorated than ever.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I walk with greatest care, to ensure [♂ his /♀️ her] survival, to ease [♂ his /♀️ her] pain.</p><p><strong>Salome:</strong><br> ...!</p><p><strong>Salome:</strong><br> —Kriemhild&#39;s personal squadron!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Personal...!?</p><hr><p><strong>Salome:</strong><br> You know she&#39;s a queen, right? She is able to grant others her power.</p><p><strong>Salome:</strong><br> The ones under her “personal command” receive her power, and gain powerful permanent blessings.</p><p><strong>Salome:</strong><br> Which means...we&#39;re...not in the best of situations.</p><p><strong>Salome:</strong><br> I previously held this power, but obviously, I lost it.</p><p><strong>Salome:</strong><br> I&#39;m really sorry. Can you walk on your own?</p><p><strong>Salome:</strong><br> All right. This is where we part ways.</p><p><strong>Salome:</strong><br> You weren&#39;t Jokanaan, but I really enjoyed our little escapade.</p><p><strong>Salome:</strong><br> Thank you, and goodbye. I wish you the best of luck.</p><p><strong>Salome:</strong><br> I&#39;m leaving.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> My magical energy reserve is not enough. But, the Command Spell granted to me is still active.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Not one from my current Master. The one from my original Master.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> —A Berserker is not exactly a thinker, but this got me thinking.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Where did this Command Spell come from?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> No one ever seemed to question it— Almost like they couldn&#39;t question it.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> What is this power that keeps getting replenished with every fight?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Hahaha, why do I even care? I don&#39;t need to think.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Just fight for [♂ him /♀️ her]. Die for [♂ him /♀️ her].</p><p><strong>Salome:</strong><br> Come to me, Kriemhild. If you oppose my dear–no...</p><p><strong>Salome:</strong><br> If you oppose my Master...I&#39;ll kill you. I won&#39;t leave a single scrap of your body intact.</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Salome:</strong><br> ...Tch...kh...!</p><p><strong>Salome:</strong><br> Master... Didn&#39;t you run away?</p><p><strong>Salome:</strong><br> But... you&#39;re still there?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Salome:</strong><br> No, Master! Stay awake...!</p><p><strong>Salome:</strong><br> Master!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...Zzz...</p><hr><p><strong>Salome:</strong><br> ...Oh, huh? You&#39;re sleeping...?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Is this... a dream...?</p><hr><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> —I can tell from your expression that this must come as a surprise.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Moriarty...!?</p><hr><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> It really is nothing to be surprised over. I do have this kind of power, after all.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Think of it as though it were a fated encounter, if you like.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> What&#39;s your objective here...?</p><hr><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Hmm, a valid question. Though mundane.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> It goes without saying that I&#39;m interested in you. Ordinary, common, frustrated, yet still moving forward.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Unfortunately, I can&#39;t relate to that sort of thing. So it&#39;s only natural then to talk, in order to understand one another, isn&#39;t it?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Then, this is...</p><hr><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Yes, this is a dream. You&#39;ve been here, right? At least once before.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Not even the Alien God can peer into dreams. And I have the power of a Divine Spirit.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> So, with a bit of tinkering, I ended up coming here to set up a backroom deal.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You don&#39;t suppose...</p><hr><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Oh, no. There will be no compromises. I am, at the end of the day, an Apostle of the Alien World.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> True, this Singularity has nothing to do with me. But, what lies at its core is vengeance.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Its originator has every right to exact it.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Now then... I won&#39;t mince words. Give up your position.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...What?</p><hr><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> You&#39;re like a deer in headlights. As a gentleman, I promise your life will be spared.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> As for the lives of the others, well—consider it an inevitable sacrifice.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I refuse.</p><hr><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Huh, no matter, I shouldn&#39;t expect you to answer right away. Give it some thought.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> As you&#39;d expect, it would be the betrayal of a lifetime. No, this would be the second time, wouldn&#39;t it?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Now then, you unfortunately have someone waiting to see you—so I&#39;ll be merrily on my way.</p><p><strong>Salome:</strong><br> Oh... are you awake yet...? Hehehe.</p><p><strong>Salome:</strong><br> You are such a heartless person to fall asleep in a situation like this.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Are you okay...?</p><hr><p><strong>Salome:</strong><br> I should be asking you that. You could have fallen asleep because your time was running out.</p><p><strong>Salome:</strong><br> I didn&#39;t know how to stop the bleeding, but your Mystic Code seems to have done the job.</p><p><strong>Salome:</strong><br> It&#39;s faint, but your pulse is getting stronger.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> We&#39;re both covered in blood.</p><hr><p><strong>Salome:</strong><br> You&#39;re telling me. What an awful mess.</p><p><strong>Salome:</strong><br> Hehe. It&#39;s funny though. You really weren&#39;t Jokanaan, were you?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>Then I had no duty or obligation to help. And yet, I acted out of compassion.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>A feeling somehow different from the raging fires of love, like a smoldering flame.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>Is this what it means for a Servant to have a Master?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>—I don&#39;t want your head. —But, I do want to protect you.</p><p><strong>Salome:</strong><br> That&#39;s right. You know—</p><p><strong>Salome:</strong><br> ... ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Did you just...hear...a gunshot...?</p><hr><p><strong>Salome:</strong><br> I did... I think they&#39;re looking for us.</p><p><strong>Salome:</strong><br> Let&#39;s move quickly.</p><p><strong>Salome:</strong><br> Right now. They won&#39;t be long.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> We walk over the rolling hills. We keep walking, believing that something must lie on the other side.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I may be nearing my end. The bleeding is intense.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Consciousness is fading. But still, bit by bit, I move forward.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Forward, forward, forward.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> There they are!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> We both look up toward the sound of the voice.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Someone, recognizable as a Servant at first sight, waves their hand like crazy.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Heeeeeey! Heeeeeeeeeey!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Relief washes over us as the knight hurries to meet us.</p><p><strong>Salome:</strong><br> Hey, are you okay?</p><p><strong>Salome:</strong><br> Good... Yeah, that&#39;s great...</p><p><strong>Salome:</strong><br> Then, here&#39;s where I turn back.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You&#39;re not...coming?</p><hr><p><strong>Salome:</strong><br> No, I&#39;m not. I mean, I wouldn&#39;t fit in with those from the Via Regia Realm.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>A bewitching smile. The blood surrounding it is what makes it beautiful.</p><p><strong>Salome:</strong><br> Next time we meet, it&#39;ll be as enemies on the battlefield. And I&#39;ll show you how strong I can really be.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I see... That&#39;s that, then.</p><hr><p><strong>Salome:</strong><br> Well then, goodbye. You&#39;re not Jokanaan, just an everyday—</p><p><strong>Salome:</strong><br> ...very kind person.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Yes, truly. [♂ He /♀️ She] wanted to live.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Just as we feel fear as death approaches, we feel longing as life approaches.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> In order to go on living, [♂ he /♀️ she] gets to [♂ his /♀️ her] feet.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Someone who shouldn&#39;t even be near me, a person who takes heads for a thrill.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> And so, this is goodbye. With this, it is really goodbye.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> [♂ He /♀️ She] turns away from me, despite [♂ his /♀️ her] regret.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Likewise, I turn away from [♂ him /♀️ her]. Our backs face each other.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> —And slowly, [♂ he /♀️ she] walks away.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> As his footsteps get further and further away, I begin to do the same.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> In fact, running would be difficult. All that&#39;s left is for my legs to give out.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> A gunshot. A shattered Spiritual Core. It&#39;s agony to live on even another second.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> But, I don&#39;t want Master to see that.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I&#39;m Salome, fearsome, beautiful, and reliable. That&#39;s who I&#39;ll be, to my very last breath.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> So I put on a farce with all my being.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I put on an act better than any actor in the world, one that could even fool myself.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> —After that first hit, the next shot will surely be the one to end me.</p><p><strong>Salome:</strong><br> Hehe. It&#39;s already pointless...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Though, wouldn&#39;t it be an act of mercy?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Now that staying alive is such a struggle, it would definitely bring relief.</p><p><strong>Salome:</strong><br> Ah—</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> The pain is gone. And salvation is now certainly in sight.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I am insane. I am broken.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> There&#39;s no doubting that. And yet, still—</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I want to believe this tiny feeling I have has nothing to do with either.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I feel fulfilled. I had such a wonderful time.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> It was only a few days. But they were such, such lovely days.</p><p><strong>Salome:</strong><br> Ah...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Looking up at the sky, at the evening sun shining through the trees...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> The orange light, warm like [♂ him /♀️ her]—</p><p><strong>Archer Class:</strong><br> ... Well, as a monk, I guess it&#39;d be standard practice to say a few words.</p><p><strong>Archer Class:</strong><br> Forgive me, foreign beauty. This was the way of things in the Warring States.</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> Did you finish her off?</p><p><strong>Archer Class:</strong><br> No traces left. I guess that&#39;s that.</p><p><strong>Assassin Class:</strong><br> Shall we move in, my queen?</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> It&#39;s enough that we know which way they&#39;ve headed.</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> And that the traitor has been eliminated.</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> While it is irksome that the Master of Chaldea is now in the hands of the enemy...</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> The Via Regia Realm have acted, which in itself is significant.</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> For now... let&#39;s take comfort that at least Salome didn&#39;t cross over.</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> Assassin will remain here and continue scouting and guarding against the Via Regia Realm.</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> Archer, we&#39;re going back.</p><p><strong>Archer Class:</strong><br> Right with you.</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> ... ...</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> Pitiful woman.</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> The feeling you held was not love, much less the romantic kind.</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> It was nothing more than the strong pitying the weak.</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> You mistook it for something truly precious.</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> —Truly pitiful.</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> To think an emotion so commonplace to everyone else had been as precious as a jewel for you.</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Consciousness disconnecting</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Back feels so hot</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Can&#39;t answer the call</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Already well past physical limits</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Hope that Servant pulled through</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Though it&#39;d be nice to meet again—</p><p><strong>B：???:</strong><br> –ster. Master!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Mash...?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Thank goodness you&#39;ve come to, Master...!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> We&#39;ll immediately contact the other two at your location. Hold on just a moment.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> We&#39;re in...</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes, you&#39;re in the Via Regia Realm.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I&#39;m sorry, I think an explanation from Holmes would be better if you want the details.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Mash, can we talk for a second?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes, of course. I&#39;ve already sent word, so we have until they arrive.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> So...are you all right despite your injuries? Are you in any pain...?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I seem okay.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Oh, that&#39;s such a relief. The wound was so deep, and you were bleeding so heavily...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> There was a Caster with you who could use healing magecraft, so you pulled through.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Where&#39;s that Caster now...?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> There was nothing more for them to do. All you could do...was get enough rest.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I was serving as your nurse...even if only over the comms line...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Thank you.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Oh no! I couldn&#39;t really do anything to help... just watch pathetically.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> You&#39;re awake, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> It&#39;s good to have you back, [♂ Mister /♀️ Miss] Fujimaru.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Holmes, Kadoc...!</p><hr><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Which of us ought to start talking? I suppose... No, what we have to say can wait.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> What happened after we were separated? I&#39;d like to hear the short version.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Hmm, I see. That too is—</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> The Servants involved in your rescue were all wiped out...</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> We heard on our end that they were pretty formidable in their own right.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> If it had just been a battle, there would have been a chance at victory. However, it&#39;s a different matter when they need to protect someone.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Leaving aside the issues of compatibility, the numbers speak for themselves in this case.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> With overwhelming advantage to the pursuers.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> But, when that Rider used their Noble Phantasm at the end...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Astolfo—a Servant of the Via Regia Realm, saw it. He took off at once and found you.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> It was a job well done, and deserving of praise.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> As for you, [♂ Mister /♀️ Miss] Fujimaru, you must have endured much.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Well...this is our refuge for now. They&#39;ve got a pretty good idea where we stand, though.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> We had to reach an understanding in order to act without restrictions.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> So that means...</p><hr><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Right.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Karl der Große is a Servant here in the Via Regia Realm.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Although, we haven&#39;t heard directly from him as of yet.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Some of the Servants under his command know this to be true.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Yet, most of the Servants seem to accept that Karl der Große is on the side of rebellion.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> There are some key points I can share with you... but before that, let&#39;s first pay our respects to Karl der Große.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> The top position of Chaldea is Director Gordolf&#39;s... but here and now, it can be no one but you.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Although, until now I&#39;ve done most of the talking. We should still offer greetings and—</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> (Holmes... You&#39;re withholding things like usual.)</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> (We were supposed to all be on same page as soon as Fujimaru arrived...)</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> ...a greeting though, at the very least. And throw in some words of gratitude.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> I mean, the one who helped us was Astolfo, a paladin serving under Karl der Große.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Understood. Sounds simple enough.</p><hr><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Let me just tell you one thing...</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> This is the foremost figure who left their mark in European history, alright?</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Try not to come off as too brash.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Any etiquette lessons to share...?</p><hr><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> One, at least. Remember to bend a knee.</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> Sloppy.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> It&#39;s what worked last time, so there shouldn&#39;t be any problems...probably.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Greetings, and thanks...</p><hr><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Yoo-hoo. Feeling better?</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Hey, so you&#39;re awake! Isn&#39;t that swell?</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> And your wound&#39;s healed? Yeah, okay! Oh, my name&#39;s Astolfo.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> One of the Twelve Paladins of Charlemagne, or maybe of Karl der Große?</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Well, it&#39;s all the same to me.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> So, you&#39;re off to say hello? Great! Go, go, go!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I can&#39;t get a word in!</p><hr><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> You might want to give up on that with this guy.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> You hurry up and come with, Kadoc. His Majesty awaits!</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> You’re making the emperor “empatient”! Ahahahaha!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...a pun...!?</p><hr><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Don&#39;t respond. Anything you say will just make him laugh for no reason.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Ahahahahahaha!</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> See? There he goes.</p><p><strong>G：???:</strong><br> Just grow up, Astolfo! You shouldn’t be laughing at the drop of a hat!</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Aren&#39;t hats falling off people&#39;s heads totally funny, though?</p><p><strong>G：???:</strong><br> Not in the slightest.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Whaaat?</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Oh, excuse me. My name&#39;s Roland.</p><p><strong>Roland:</strong><br> Another of the Twelve Paladins serving Karl der Große.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> It&#39;s nice to meet you.</p><hr><p><strong>Roland:</strong><br> It&#39;s wonderful to know that you&#39;re safe.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Why are you acting so well-behaved? Go on and strip down like you always do.</p><p><strong>Roland:</strong><br> Look, Astolfo...</p><p><strong>Roland:</strong><br> I&#39;m not especially fond of being naked... Well, I am...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> (He definitely is.)</p><hr><p><strong>Roland:</strong><br> But there&#39;s a time and a place for nudity, you know?</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Well, well. So how about now?</p><p><strong>Roland:</strong><br> Seven people out of ten say they could handle it, two don&#39;t care either way, and one says that I shouldn&#39;t.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Only one in ten!?</p><hr><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> (A face that&#39;s looked into the abyss and seen pink elephants)</p><p><strong>Roland:</strong><br> Don&#39;t worry. That one in ten weighs as heavy to me as eight.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> I don&#39;t really get it, but okay.</p><p><strong>Roland:</strong><br> Fine, I didn&#39;t really get what you were on about either!</p><p><strong>Both:</strong></p><h1 id="ahahaha" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#ahahaha" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Ahahaha!</h1><p><strong>Roland:</strong><br> Alright, I&#39;ll show you around. Please follow me.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Just go with the flow. Your head and guts will hurt if you start overthinking it.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Here&#39;s where you make your sarcastic remark.</p><hr><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> I resent that. I&#39;m not that kind of character.</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> (Is he sure about that...?)</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> (What was that chill down my spine just now...)</p><p><strong>Roland:</strong><br> Karl der Große. It&#39;s Roland, accompanied by Astolfo.</p><p><strong>Roland:</strong><br> We have arrived along with the Master of Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Karl der Große:</strong><br> ...Mm!</p><p><strong>I：???:</strong><br> Karl der Große is especially pleased.</p><p><strong>Karl der Große:</strong><br> W-wait.</p><p><strong>I：???:</strong><br> ...!</p><p><strong>Karl der Große:</strong><br> Tell me... Tell me if you will, what you thought— what you reckoned about my subordinates.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> What I thought?</p><hr><p><strong>Karl der Große:</strong><br> Mm.</p><p><strong>I：???:</strong><br> Your Majesty, that&#39;s...</p><p><strong>Karl der Große:</strong><br> No, I have to hear this. Such is my commandment.</p><p><strong>I：???:</strong><br> If you wouldn&#39;t mind, then, great Master of Chaldea.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I understand.</p><hr><p><strong>Karl der Große:</strong><br> I see... I see...</p><p><strong>Karl der Große:</strong><br> Thanks, kiddo.</p><p><strong>I：???:</strong><br> Your Majesty, a little less...</p><p><strong>Karl der Große:</strong><br> Wha? Ah, hm! Well considered.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Thank you...for your kind words?</p><hr><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> ...Now, then.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> (May we?)</p><p><strong>Roland:</strong><br> (We finished clearing everyone out. No issues.)</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> That will do, Your Majesty.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Doesn&#39;t putting on the airs of a great king weigh heavily on your mind?</p><p><strong>I：???:</strong><br> Roland...</p><p><strong>Roland:</strong><br> Sorry. I think we&#39;ve taken this about as far as it can go.</p><p><strong>Roland:</strong><br> Don&#39;t you agree?</p><p><strong>I：???:</strong><br> It seems you&#39;re right... Sir, the play has come to an end.</p><p><strong>H：Karl der Große (?):</strong><br> Huh, are we alright now?</p><p><strong>I：???:</strong><br> We are.</p><p><strong>I：???:</strong><br> I had originally taken this to only be a matter of time, seeing as how Chaldea has Sherlock Holmes.</p><p><strong>I：???:</strong><br> Let us raise the curtain, rather than let it drop.</p><p><strong>H：Karl der Große (?):</strong><br> Nwah! We&#39;re doing it already, Sancho!?</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> Yes, the time is right. You know it had to happen sooner or later.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Sancho...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> That would mean your name is Alonso Quixano. Or—Don Quixote!</p><p><strong>H：Don Quixote:</strong><br> I-indeed.</p><p><strong>H：Don Quixote:</strong><br> My name is Don Quixote de la Mancha, knight-errant of Spain!</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> Or so he styles himself. And I am Sancho Panza.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> U-uhm, I myself am aware of the story of Don Quixote...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> But, I believe Sancho was described in the story as an older man with a paunch...</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> Yes. The very same Sancho. And yet, I am not merely Sancho...</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> I&#39;m a blend of many elements from the story&#39;s characters.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Hmm.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> I shall surmise—Rocinante, Don Quixote&#39;s beloved steed. Dulcinea, his exalted but imaginary princess.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> And the Duchess&#39; maidservant, Altisidora. All correct?</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> Es perfecto. A grand solution.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> I am most honored.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I see... Even Rocinante as well? No wonder...</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> Yes. His worship rode me all around, every single day.</p><p><strong>H：Don Quixote:</strong><br> Are you smearing my good name!? Look here, I handled her just as I would any other horse!</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> Windmills.</p><p><strong>H：Don Quixote:</strong><br> Hnk!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> What was that just now?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That&#39;s right.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> According to the original story, he had mistaken windmills for giants.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> He bravely mounted his beloved Rocinante, and sallied forth.</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> When speaking of riding horses, of course I as Rocinante would be involved.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Right, the windmills...</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> Yes.</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> As you might expect, I was the party involved to the greatest extend in these escapades. What with being the horse and all.</p><hr><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> Oh, there are those abominable giants! All right, we&#39;re charging in, Rocinante!</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> Wait, your worship? Any way you look at them, those are windmills.</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> Hmph...if I could describe for you the threat of this domain, you might understand...</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> No, your grace, I told you to wait.</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> Let us charge, Rocinante! Look upon my majestic figure, my princess—!</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> Wow, he&#39;s really going for it.</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> Hooo-waaah!!</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> Look, I tried to tell you.</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> Blast it! Even if its form was changed to a windmill by some cunning sorcerer...</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> A giant remains a giant. At this point, I&#39;ll charge it with everything I have—</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> ... ...</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> Sure enough, I must stop now that my whole body is aching.</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> Oh, oh. Poor Rocinante. Are you alive? Are you all right?</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> Just one of the episodes of Don Quixote de la Mancha, most renowned in all the world.</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> Rocinante was even crying in the shadows, if you can believe it.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> That&#39;s so sad.</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> They looked like giants at the time...</p><p><strong>Roland:</strong><br> Yeah, that&#39;s been known to happen.</p><p><strong>Roland:</strong><br> Back when I lost my own reason, Astolfo looked like a virtuous lady.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> What? Don&#39;t I still look the same? Don&#39;t I?</p><p><strong>Roland:</strong><br> You tell me what&#39;s so lady-like about the sight of you riding your hippogriff, asleep and drooling!</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Fhkyah!</p><p><strong>Roland:</strong><br> Gyaaah!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Is this a bit?</p><hr><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Yeah.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> At least try denying it!</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> Ahem. All things considered...</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> The moral here is that reacting to assumptions with violence will bring troubles.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Well then, I suppose it would be prudent to ask now why you took the name of Karl der Große.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> And these are most likely two of the real Twelve Paladins. Why then did they serve you?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Here is where you&#39;re caught up, Fujimaru. I would very much like to hear the reasoning.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> They haven&#39;t told you?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That&#39;s right.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Sancho promised to reveal everything as soon as you were up again, Master.</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> Mm.</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> We&#39;re very glad to have your cooperation, but unfortunately, this Singularity is rife with mysteries.</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> Even Holmes can only do so much without material on which to base his deductions.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Precisely.</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> Yes.</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> That said, I can only speak from my perspective as a Servant summoned here...</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> ... ...</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> If I may, sir?</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> M-m... Mm.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> (He doesn&#39;t look too hot.)</p><hr><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> (Is something the matter?)</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> When we were both summoned to this Singularity,</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> we learned that a large number of Servants were planning to rebel against Pan-Human History.</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> The rebellious spirit could&#39;ve been due to a hero being muddied with evil, or an anti-hero&#39;s wickedness...</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> But we learned quickly that neither were the case here.</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> They advocated rebellion in general, as something that seemed and felt perfectly fair.</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> As you would expect, Servants were called on by the Counter Force in order to correct this Singularity.</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> But with numbers against them, they were intercepted one after another.</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> Worst of all, some Servants have become infected by the ideology... Some even ended up joining the rebel side.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> It could be that another force is behind this. A Servant of our own was seized, as well.</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> Were they, now...?</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> In any case, that was no time for correcting the Singularity.</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> As such, we first decided to gather allies.</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> The rebelling Servants fortunately are not a hive, having their own diversity of beliefs.</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> We successfully invited Astolfo and Roland to join us in establishing a third realm.</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> And by hook or by crook, we&#39;re securing the balance of power in three directions.</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> So as not to let Revenge or Restoration garner too much strength.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> But, your decision to invite and include us... must mean you&#39;ve gradually reached an impasse.</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> An impasse?</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> True. The greatest flaw in our forces is—</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> The matter of Karl der Große not being Karl der Große.</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> Karl der Große&#39;s name and the draw of the two Paladins are only just enough to keep things sustained.</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> No, I ought to say that it was only just enough.</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> My estimation is that in a matter of days, fear and doubt will have surfaced among our subordinates.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> After all, those subordinates are in rebellion against Pan-Human History, and are acting under that belief.</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> Yes, just as you say.</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> For instance—those Servants embedded in the Revenge Realm were on our side—on the side of the Human Order.</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> Most Servants consider us rebels against Pan-Human History, just like they are.</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> Still, we did mislead them into thinking so.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Hmm. How do they seem from your point of view?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> It is not unnatural in itself for Servants of Pan-Human History to turn on one another.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> They bear their own thoughts, principles, and dreams... Commanding them, or being commanded by them.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> The thought of eliminating your enemies by force of arms is a valid one for a hero.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> There have also been Servants who have suffered corruption.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> The records for the Seventh Singularity state that Ushiwakamaru was corrupted by the Chaos Tide, ultimately joining the enemy forces.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> But this Singularity fits neither case.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> These Servants were properly summoned, and their reason and intelligence have not been impaired.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Yet to go so far as to rebel against the Human Order—against Pan-Human History—is nothing short of strange.</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> I&#39;ve marvelled at this too, and made numerous subtle inquiries to that end—</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> They don&#39;t take it at face value, either. It seems to be a feeling, like a hunger, akin to instinct, so to speak.</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> A condition where they seemingly feel no option except to rebel. Consequently, there appear to be individual differences.</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> Those in the Revenge and Restoration Realms who display weak instincts for rebellion are made priorities for elimination.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Individual differences notwithstanding, a summoned Servant is influenced spiritually by the personality of their Master.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Like a wicked monster with an evil Master, and a virtuous familiar with a good-natured Master.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Of course, when it comes to Heroic Spirits, that&#39;s only a minor change. When it comes to anything rooted in instinct—</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> You mean to say...it&#39;s to the extent that an evil entity has become the Master?</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> For instance, uhm...like...James Moriarty.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> ... ...</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> What&#39;s on your mind, Administrative Advisor?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Holmes...?</p><hr><h2 id="section-8-chat-in-the-dark-night" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-8-chat-in-the-dark-night" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 8: Chat in the Dark Night</h2><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Sherlock Holmes, my bitter enemy. The eternal light to my shadow.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> —However... Hm.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Now that I have manifested as an Apostle of the Alien World, the man named Sherlock Holmes matters not to me.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Nevertheless, his ability to investigate, deduce, and uncover the truth remains a pertinent issue.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> The use of such skills within this Singularity would be a problem.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Thusly, I have sown the seeds of misdirection.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> I revealed my existence before him, complete with a monologue befitting the occasion.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Pure nonsense. Heh.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> However, my very being here will cause that man to lose sight of his original objective.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> If Holmes is the one who casts light on the truth, then I am the one who shrouds it in darkness.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> A darkness even he cannot illuminate.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> I see. The Alien God is more thorough than I had originally thought.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Vlad III imprisoned himself upon his own stakes. Such a powerful Servant would have been a useful pawn...</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> A shame indeed, but other pieces remain in play.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> The possibilities are...no, I cannot say.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Holmes...?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> I apologize.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> When it comes to this Moriarty, I simply have no idea where to begin.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> I don&#39;t believe he is a Master, but—</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> You&#39;re being uncharacteristically vague.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> ...That in itself is possibly a conclusion.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> In this Singularity, the concept of a “Master” has no significance.</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> Meaning...finding and killing their Master won&#39;t eliminate the Servants?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> I should think not.</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> That is definitely a problem...</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> We recruited you all because we thought you, if nobody else, would be able to do it...</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> Huuh!?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Naturally, there remains other ways in which we can lend our support. The Revenge and Restoration Realms, for example.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> We can take them both on, and win.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Seize the Holy Grails that maintain them, and collapse the Singularity.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Would that not be possible?</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> Of course it would...but did you take our differences in strength into account?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> I did. On that basis, we shall be victorious.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> I concede there are numerous issues and obstacles to be dealt with, but I do not believe we are at the point where we can admit defeat quite yet.</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> ... Sir...</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> Right... Señor Sherlock Holmes.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Yes?</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> I beg of you, please save Pan-Human History.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> ...Leave it to me.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> That being said...at the moment, our options are rather limited.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> First, we are going to need a small, elite team of which to make use.</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> In that case, we&#39;ll assemble some Servants for you.</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> They are all quite reliable. Aside from Roland and Astolfo, of course.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Thank you. That would be most helpful.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> (And to keep an eye on us too, no doubt. But...)</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> (Sancho&#39;s been taking charge ever since they revealed themselves...)</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> (Come to think of it, she was almost always the one who relayed what Karl der Große said.)</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> (Given Don Quixote&#39;s origins, is Sancho the more diplomatic one here...?)</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> (It&#39;d be a different case if she were just Sancho...)</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> (But the story of Don Quixote also includes a delusional princess, a deceitful maid, and even an unnamed duke.)</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> (Well...whatever. Should things get out of hand...)</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> (It&#39;s Chaldea—namely [♂ him /♀️ her]—who will have to wrack their brain to make a decision.)</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> (I&#39;m just here to present the facts.)</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> Now then, please make yourselves at home in the private quarters we have prepared for you.</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> —And now, your grace.</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> From what we were told, it would be difficult to resolve the Singularity by merely killing the Master.</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> So it seems...</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> What are your thoughts? I believe—</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> No, no, Sancho. I...still belong on this throne.</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> No matter what anybody else says, I have a mission I must carry out.</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> ... ...</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> ...Don&#39;t I?</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> Yes... As you say, sir.</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> For the time being, I have several missions in mind for the commando unit.</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> Mm.</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> Leave it to me to choose their watchdogs.</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> We may have a shortage of personnel, but this is still one of the three Realms.</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> This realm is full of individuals of noteworthy skill yet to be utilized.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Phew...</p><hr><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> It seems we are being watched... Though it appears our voices won&#39;t reach them.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> I can at least put up a Bounded Field for some light soundproofing. Should I?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> If you would.</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> So, now that we&#39;ve managed to get settled for the moment...</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> Are we okay with this? It&#39;s not Karl der Große, but Don Quixote!</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> I would say it&#39;s fine...but this really isn&#39;t fine at all.</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> Exactly!</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Be that as it may, we have no other options.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Both the Revenge and Restoration Realms are completely self-sufficient as independent entities.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> And above all else, they both display clear hostility towards Pan-Human History.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Had the same been true of the Via Regia Realm, we would have been left completely out of options.</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> Well, that&#39;s true...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Don&#39;t you have something else to say first, Gordolf?</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> Yes, of course.</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> Fujimaru. Well done coming back alive. I commend you.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Thank you very much!</p><hr><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> But...</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> It would be better!! If you didn&#39;t get captured!! In the first place!! Do you have any idea how much trouble you caused!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Sorrysorrysorry!</p><hr><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Still, I&#39;m amazed you even made it back alive.</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> Hmph. Well, I suppose pure dumb luck is in itself a talent.</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> But if there are Servants prone to defecting like Salome was...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Servants are not unthinking, unfeeling puppets.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> They have their own thoughts and feelings.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Gaining new perspectives can lead to a change in one&#39;s ideals, even if only for a short time.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> However, when all is said and done, what returns to the Throne is merely a record of events. The resulting memories and feelings eventually fade away...</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> By the way, whatever happened to that so-called Seton fellow?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> We lost track of him in all the commotion...</p><hr><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> You couldn&#39;t even make his face out, huh...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Let&#39;s set aside the matter of him for now.</p><p><strong>Meunière:</strong><br> Incidentally, I&#39;ve processed the data we&#39;ve collected so far, and drawn up a diagram summarizing our current understanding of the three realms. Would it be of any use?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Absolutely!</p><hr><p><strong>Meunière:</strong><br> Great. Let me bring it up on the screen.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Hmm...</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Looking at it this way, the Via Regia Realm doesn&#39;t seem to excel at anything in particular.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> The fact that they&#39;re still standing at all is amazing.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> They are likely to excel at mobility. In addition, their stronghold itself is rather impenetrable.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> I&#39;m sure countermeasures have been taken to prevent enemy Servants entering Spirit Form as well.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Their enemies may be Servants, but they will have to march here on foot—and if they do so en masse, they can easily be intercepted.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Should they attempt to break through, they can be engaged from behind.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> She has created quite an advantageous position here, though I don&#39;t know if that was intentional or not on her part.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Well, Holmes. We ask you once again, what should we do now?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> First of all, regarding this self-proclaimed “Apostle of the Alien World” Moriarty. It is all but certain that he is planning something behind the scenes.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> One option would be to continue pursuing him...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> However, that will not bring us any closer to our goal of resolving this Singularity.</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> So we&#39;re back to where we started...work together with this Realm to destroy the other two.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Yes. There is no room for negotiation.</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> Well, I don&#39;t see that being a problem. It&#39;s not like this is a Lostbelt.</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> They went as far as to start a war, so they should be prepared to go down that road.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Still, it seems like you&#39;ll be working as a commando unit. But, I wonder what that entails?</p><p><strong>I：???:</strong><br> Excuse me. May I come in?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> (Switching comms to concealed mode. Responding to us will seem like you&#39;re talking to yourself, so keep that in mind.)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Come in!</p><hr><p><strong>I：???:</strong><br> Thank you.</p><p><strong>I：???:</strong><br> I am the newest member of the Karl Commandos, and a Caster-class Servant—</p><p><strong>I：???:</strong><br> My True Name is Xu Fu.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> So you&#39;re...</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> Could it be that you&#39;re maybe actually familiar with my legend?</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> On the orders of the First Qin Emperor, I went in search of Mount Penglai and the elixir of immortality.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Xu Fu...?</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> A fangshi who travelled to Japan to search for the elixir of immortality, by the order of Qin Shi Huang.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> It&#39;s basic Asian history, you can just look it up later.</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> Hehe, I don&#39;t mind. I&#39;m just a minor hero, after all.</p><hr><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> I see. Pleased to meet you, Miss Xu Fu.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> I am Sherlock Holmes, private detective. And this is—</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> Kadoc Zemlupus. Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> Those are the codenames I got from the Secretary...</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> I understand that you have some matters you would rather not speak of.</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> But, uhm, if you could secretly let me in on them later, I&#39;d be happy to be of assistance. Please.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Hahaha. Well, we shall...see about that.</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> Wow, I suddenly feel like not believing a single thing you say to me.</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> Still, two Casters and an Extra Class is an odd grouping.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Well, you know. Stuff happens.</p><p><strong>J：???:</strong><br> Lady Xu Fu, please allow me to introduce myself as well.</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> Ah.</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> Oh, right...</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> Allow me to introduce you to another new addition to the Commandos.</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> Rest assured, I most definitely did not forget about him at all.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> (You totally did, didn&#39;t you...)</p><hr><p><strong>J：???:</strong><br> Hahaha. No wonder you have the trust of the Secretary. You speak in such a dignified way.</p><p><strong>J：???:</strong><br> My name is Diarmuid Ua Duibhne, proud member of the Knights of Fianna.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> I am also known as Diarmuid of the Radiant Face. A pleasure to make your acquaintance.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Diarmuid Ua Duibhne...!</p><hr><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> Oh, it seems you are familiar with me. I had not thought myself that famous...</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> Perhaps we met in a previous Singularity or Holy Grail War?</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> Regretfully, I do not remember any such thing... however, I am here as your ally now.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> Please order me as you would the other Commandos.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> My, my. He&#39;s quite the dandy, isn&#39;t he?</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> Ah yes, you&#39;re one for the beauty of a pretty face, aren&#39;t you, Technical Advisor...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Now then, if you would kindly tell us about the mission we&#39;ve been assigned?</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> Of course.</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> Our mission is to perform reconnaissance-in-force and secure an abandoned fort.</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> Unfortunately, we&#39;re rather short-staffed right now, so we&#39;re to complete two assignments in one day.</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> I get the feeling that the Secretary is going to be working us to the bone.</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> Fufu... If it&#39;ll be this much of a pain, I might just run away...</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> Why is she suddenly in such a crappy mood!?</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> Obviously, I will be supporting you from the rear.</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> And Diarmuid will be the tip of our spear, so to speak.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> Yes. I shall escort you all to the best of my ability!</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> His face really is bright...</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> How do you get anything done looking like that?</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> It won&#39;t be a problem, as it doesn&#39;t shine during infiltrations!</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> Can it just not do it at all, instead?</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> —Ahem. Anyway, we have an early start tomorrow.</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> I recommend that all Commandos either take on spirit form or go to bed early tonight.</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...?</p><hr><p><strong>A：???:</strong><br> Quiet. It&#39;s me, Kadoc.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Keep your voice down. I wanna talk to you outside...</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Okay, this should be good...</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Mash, is everything ready?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Sigh... Like I said earlier, Da Vinci is still performing maintenance on my equipment.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The New Director already went to bed. The night shift staff are also resting...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I&#39;m the only one active in Chaldea at the moment.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> What calls for a meeting at this moment in particular?</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Just to be on the safe side.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> After I woke up in Chaldea, I reviewed all the records on the Lostbelts that came after Russia.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> And I want to talk to you about the Chaldean.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> He&#39;s not the Doctor.</p><hr><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> I know.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> We don&#39;t who he is, so we&#39;ll just have to save that topic for another day.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Remember what he said? “There&#39;s someone on that boat who can&#39;t be trusted.”</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> And then also that Archer&#39;s unsettling message?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Of course.</p><hr><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> There&#39;s certainly something to say about how you reported in full the conversation he told you to keep secret...</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> But, well...I know you guys well enough at this point to know it&#39;d be pointless.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Mash, I expect you remember what was reported. Have you thought about who it could be?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It&#39;s all in my report.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I did have a candidate, but...it&#39;s too unrealistic.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> What, weren&#39;t you a mystery novel fangirl? Are you telling me you discarded your theory without a second thought?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> No, it&#39;s the other way around.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I believe I theorized about it as logically as I could.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> But my conclusion was always—that what was said didn&#39;t make complete sense.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> I&#39;d still like to hear what your thoughts are...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Sure. He said someone can&#39;t be trusted...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> In other words, that there is a traitor amongst Chaldea&#39;s staff.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> There is no evidence to support it, and most importantly, no motive.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> A whydunit, as we call it in the mystery novel community.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Yeah, I&#39;ve heard that term before.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> “Since any supernatural phenomenon is possible with magecraft, there&#39;s no meaning in pursuing a howdunit.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> However, the reason behind the act—the whydunit—is one thing that is never not significative.“</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Correct.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Following that logic, Chaldea&#39;s current staff is entirely off the suspect list.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I can&#39;t imagine any motive any of them would have to help in the bleaching of Earth.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I know you could argue they&#39;re just hiding their intentions, but...I&#39;m positive we&#39;d have stumbled upon it long time ago if that was the case.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> None of them would&#39;ve had a reason to help with or hinder the bleaching.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Makes sense.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Their crime is already complete. There&#39;s no point in lending a hand to the organization trying to undo it.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The same applies to Servants. Myself, Captain Nemo, Da Vinci.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> And then there&#39;s Holmes, but even he is working against the blank state of the Earth.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That leaves us with just the Masters... Sion, Kadoc, and Senpai.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Both warnings were given before Kadoc joined Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> So that&#39;s a perfect alibi.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Senpai is out of the question.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> As extreme as it may sound, Senpai could&#39;ve easily put a definitive end to the case at any time [♂ he /♀️ she] wanted by simply throwing in the towel.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> That&#39;s true...</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Since Sion is a member of the Atlas Institute, there&#39;s a reasonable possibility that her goals don&#39;t align with ours—</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It&#39;s unlikely...but far from impossible that this could become a motive for betrayal.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> But even in that case, she made one move that rules her out,</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> when the Alien God annihilated the Wandering Sea with a pseudo-black hole.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Sion made her last stand, fully prepared for her impending death.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> If she wanted to betray us, that would have been her best opportunity.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Having seen the outcome beforehand, she could have easily escaped alone...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> None of us could have possibly survived if she did.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> So, I guess that narrows it down to me, right?</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Both people giving you the warning could have predicted my returning to Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> But if you&#39;re the culprit, we wouldn&#39;t even be having this conversation to begin with.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> It doesn&#39;t. Before anything else, I&#39;d like to say I&#39;m no traitor in this.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Not that you&#39;d really take the word of a former traitor to Pan-Human History...</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> But I don&#39;t have the guts to betray anyone who put a death collar around my neck.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I believe you do have the guts, but I otherwise agree with what you said.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> If your wish is to survive, you won&#39;t betray anyone in a situation where that betrayal would spell death for you...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It would be an incomprehensible move.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> The thing about motives,</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> is that everyone in the staff, including ourselves and the Servants,</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> had consistent behavior patterns, to an extent. Well, except me, sort of...</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> I betrayed Pan-Human History, lost, got a nasty injury, and came back, but after that—</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> I agreed to a limited support role to avoid long-term confinement or death.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Moral judgments on my choices aside, no part of that felt out of character, did it?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It didn&#39;t. Which brings us back to my initial conclusion that the Chaldean was—</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> But you have a suspect in mind, don&#39;t you?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Senpai...!</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Not exactly a suspect. But there is something I&#39;m wondering about.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> I want Mash to search something in the database. If you get any results...</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> ...I&#39;ll have just been making a clown out of myself with my suspicions. But if you get none...</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Then my question was valid.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I have the database search tab open, just in case.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Anytime, Kadoc.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> It&#39;s about the Servants. First...Da Vinci.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> The original Da Vinci was summoned by Chaldea, and in time, her later model inherited her role.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Meaning, the summoner she&#39;s obeying is Chaldea, and she&#39;s been cooperating since before the Incineration of Human History.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Nemo claimed to have been summoned by Sion, if I&#39;m remembering the records correctly.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Despite being a mix between Phantom and Divine Spirit, Nemo was properly summoned.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Fujimaru&#39;s contracted Servant, Mash Kyrielight, goes without saying.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Kadoc...are you asking what I think you&#39;re asking?</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> I am. Sherlock Holmes.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> When, where, and by whom was he summoned?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> What are you getting at?</p><hr><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Servants need Masters, and not just as a tank holding magical energy as fuel.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> The contract plays an important part in anchoring them to reality.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> That&#39;s the main reason Masters are necessary. Otherwise, why bother with someone that generally makes no difference in battles between heroes?</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Compared to this, magecraft backup is of little importance.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> But, we often come across Stray Servants...</p><hr><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> True.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> In past Singularities, there were Servants neither affiliated with Chaldea nor the enemy.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> But those were just cases of the land itself using the power of the Grail that created the Singularity,</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> resulting in the summoning of Servants to aid in the struggle to return to the actual history.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Consider the land their “vessels”. In that case, it makes sense for them to operate without a Master.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> That said, the Lostbelts had Stray Servants that didn&#39;t depend on any Grail.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Like Beowulf in Russia.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Then, isn&#39;t that what Holmes is? Considering we first met him in the Atlas Institute—</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> No, wait...</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Huh?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> We first met him in Atlas, but...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> ...he was in the Mage&#39;s Association in London.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> T-true. Sorry for my discomposure.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> He did mention that.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> He confirmed he was the one who left the messages in London.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> In London, you managed to safely acquire the information I left at the Mage&#39;s Association, right?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> It was just paperwork, but it must&#39;ve been worth a thousand pounds to you at the time.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> It makes perfect sense for him to have been summoned in London thanks to being linked to the land...</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> But, what&#39;s the reason for him to appear in Camelot and Shinjuku later on—</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Holmes&#39; answer was that he forcibly extended his manifestation,</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> and performed a burdensome brute-force Rayshift.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Like Miyamoto Musashi?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> No, he can&#39;t repeat the process as frequently as Musashi. He couldn&#39;t do it more than twice, at the cost of being weakened.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> He said that these two instances left him borderline unable to fight.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Makes sense. I did read that he could barely fight in Shinjuku.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> After Shinjuku, he officially became Senpai&#39;s Servant, and as such,</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> his debuffs were cleared, although at the cost of his ability to Rayshift independently.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Or at least, so he told us...</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Got it... Well, there aren&#39;t really any glaring holes in his story.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> It makes sense...but something is bugging me.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> I can&#39;t do this... The dots just aren&#39;t connecting.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> There&#39;s one thing I can say with confidence.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It is impossible for Holmes to be a traitor.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Considering all his past contributions, attitudes, and motives—</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I can&#39;t reach a clear whydunit.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I trust Holmes.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> What about you, Fujimaru?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I trust him.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I&#39;m...not sure.</p><hr><div class="custom-container tip"><p class="custom-container-title">Note</p><p>This choice will show if Sherlock&#39;s interlude has been completed by player.</p></div><p><strong>Fujimaru 3:</strong><br> Holmes is a man of justice.</p><hr><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Well, it doesn&#39;t matter to me. I&#39;m just here to present the facts.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Or...I at least wish it didn&#39;t matter, but life&#39;s not that simple.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Fujimaru, Mash, do me a favor and forget our conversation here tonight.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> It&#39;s Holmes we&#39;re dealing with, after all.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> If you trust Holmes, I don&#39;t want to be giving you intrusive thoughts. And if you don&#39;t, you wouldn&#39;t want to let him notice.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I can&#39;t do that on command...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Are you going to, like...hit my head or...?</p><hr><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> How are you this dumb...?</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Sealing memories is basic magecraft. Well, at least the version that requires consent.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> W-what do I need to do?</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Check file AG-134458 in the Storm Border&#39;s Chaldea Database.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> The article on alpine goats hides the location of memory-sealing spell scrolls.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Just write the time and date on it to use.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Understood. I will.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Fujimaru, Mash.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> This is only a seal. You probably won&#39;t be able to completely forget everything.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> The conversation will stay deep in your consciousness. If you really trust Holmes,</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> then keep observing and doubting him to prove your trust. Got it?</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Okay, see you tomorrow.</p><h2 id="section-9-we-are-the-karl-commandos" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-9-we-are-the-karl-commandos" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 9: We Are the Karl Commandos!</h2><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Good morning, Senpai.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Foou.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Good morning!</p><hr><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> And an excellent morning it is.</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> Indeed.</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> It&#39;s a sunny day, truly befitting the Karl Commandos.</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> Good fortune continues to smile upon us...I think.</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> Good morning. Let&#39;s depart right away.</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> I want to hurry back as fast as possible so I can take a nap. (Munch munch)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> She&#39;s already thinking about downtime...</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> I&#39;ve been ever so lazy since I was summoned. Perhaps all that hard work in the past has finally caught up with me.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Then let&#39;s get cracking.</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> Splendid... A splendid attitude indeed. (Munch munch)</p><hr><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> ... ...(Munch)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> (Did she just grab my ear?)</p><hr><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> Good morning!! Let us raise our spirits for today as well!!</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> Way too much energy for this early in the morning...</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> Hehe. If it weren&#39;t for you guys, I would be working as a pair with this man... Hehehe...my stomach would be dead.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Hahaha. Although it is morning, it doesn&#39;t mean that there won&#39;t be any enemies.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> We have to firmly demonstrate our usefulness here.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> Well then, as we agreed upon yesterday, I shall be the vanguard.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> Holmes and Fujimaru will form the center.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> And Xu Fu will hold the rear, if we are all in agreement?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Roger that.</p><hr><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> I&#39;ll tag along with the mission for now. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll have anything to do if I stay behind anyway.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> Then, we are off! Let&#39;s exit the main street from the north gate.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> I thought this when I first arrived as well, but... does trade and commerce exist here?</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> There&#39;s a considerable amount. Payment is done through QP though.</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> Storing the excess reinforcement resources from demonic beast hunting would be pointless.</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> As such, the Servants of all the realms use them to reinforce their Saint Graphs.</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> I still have some ways to go, though... You guys seem a lot better off than me.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> (Even though two of us aren&#39;t Servants...)</p><hr><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> Oh, hang on a sec.

The journey out and back is going to be hard for this mission.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ?</p><hr><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Oh, you don&#39;t know because you were passed out the whole time.</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> This place is very deep in the mountains.

Why not?</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> This area is full of snakes and the like.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Oh, snakes? With some simple magecraft, I can just–</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> The people of the Far East would call them Orochis.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Start with that next time!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> Nicely done~.

You shouldn&#39;t be surprised by anything.</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> This mission seemed like a piece of cake...!</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> When I heard there&#39;d be three Casters, I really didn&#39;t know what to do!</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> Yay, it was so easy♪</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> Let&#39;s carry on then. We&#39;ll be arriving at the reconnaissance site soon.</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> I have been meaning to ask you, Miss Xu Fu.</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> What is it?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> It&#39;s not a pertinent question, merely a curiosity of mine. Did you manage to find the elixir of immortality you were looking for?</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> Oh... Well...yes...but also, no... It...sort of became irrelevant...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> What made it irrelevant?</p><hr><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> Ah!</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> I&#39;d like to request secrecy on this topic, on the off chance the First Qin Emperor ever gets summoned!</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> I don&#39;t mind talking about it here, but only because he&#39;ll never be summoned to this Singularity!</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> ...right?</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> Hahaha, sorry to interrupt such a delightful subject,</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> but we&#39;re arriving at the tower of Xanten.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> The watchtower is located midway between the Revenge Realm and the Via Regia Realm.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> Since the sky is not red, this is currently Via Regia territory.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> The sky gets red?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Yeah, the sky was all red there...</p><hr><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> The Revenge Realm dyes its sky red.</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> “Past this line is my turf. Come closer if you wanna see the color of your blood, punk.”</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> ...a declaration of intent, so I gather.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Mister Ua Duibhne, remind us of our mission.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> She mentioned it being reconnaissance-in-force...</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> Yes. We confirmed a little while earlier that a small squadron was deployed here.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> Our job is to check who it&#39;s comprised of, and then we are to retreat.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> But if the situation should call for it, we have permission to eliminate them.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> How small are we talking?</p><hr><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> Ten to twenty Servants. We&#39;re at quite the numerical disadvantage...</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> However, I hear the team is composed entirely of Phantom-grade Servants, so it&#39;s far from a battle we can&#39;t win.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> So, how shall we approach them?</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> A tower...?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Really weird architecture, right?</p><hr><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> I agree. It&#39;s a tad too tall for a watchtower.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> —Hmm. Fascinating.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> Have you noticed anything?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> As you might expect, without infiltrating and studying the interior, I can&#39;t tell you what lies inside.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Shush...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> They have a patrol.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> I can&#39;t see any guards outside—but I don&#39;t believe they wouldn&#39;t have any.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> The first fact to consider is that Assassins are hiding themselves with Presence Concealment.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Two... No, three of them. If I were their general, I&#39;d position them at...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> One in each of the lateral doors, and the third one in the rear.</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> Then, I&#39;ll try to break their concealment.</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> It&#39;d normally be nothing more than a shot in the dark, but after narrowing down their locations that much,</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> my Tao arts should be able to do the job. I will put up a soundproofing Bounded Field at the same time.</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> I believe we can infiltrate unnoticed if we&#39;re lucky.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> Excellent. Amazing work today, Lady Xu Fu.</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> I am always amazing. So, are you ready?</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> Aye.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Sounds good.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> All set.</p><hr><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> Perfect.</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> “Banned Action. Sharp-eyed Ghost. Zhen Qiguai Fu. And to top it off, New Jokou Zekka Talisman.”</p><p><strong>Assassin Class:</strong><br> Wha...!? Enemies! I can&#39;t...move...!</p><p><strong>Assassin Class:</strong><br> Attack! Incoming! They can&#39;t...hear...me...!</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> My name is Diarmuid ua Duibhne, knight of Fianna! Here I come!</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> I wish to remain anonymous!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Karl Commandos, let&#39;s go!</p><hr><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Are you really going with that name? I don&#39;t remember agreeing with that part.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Hahaha, don&#39;t you think we have more pressing matters at hand?</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Assassin Class:</strong><br> Zounds...!</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> ...No reinforcements approaching. Our presence wasn&#39;t noticed. Inside the tower...</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> I can&#39;t feel any presences or fighting spirit. Should we enter immediately?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Hm. Nothing inside stands out that much.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> There is some paperwork. Let&#39;s take a read...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> What does it say?</p><hr><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> This one is...a blueprint of the tower. Hmm, hmm.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Anything interesting there?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Miss Xu Fu.</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> Hwha?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> There&#39;s a small chance this tower is connected to the land&#39;s leyline.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Would it be possible to confirm that?</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> Hm, maybe, if I go underground.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Then, if you would be so kind?</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> Uh, on my own? No. Who would agree with those terms?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Hahaha, true.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Fujimaru, you go with her.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> S-Sure!</p><hr><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> I&#39;ll go along too. It&#39;s dangerous for two Casters to go alone.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> And where are you going, Holmes?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> To the top of the tower, of course.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> Then us three will go downstairs. MOVE OUT!</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> I wish we wouldn&#39;t have to, but all right. Do we really have to?</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> Ghhh...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Any progress?</p><hr><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> This goes...here...then here... What&#39;s that supposed to mean?</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> ...Okay, we can ask now.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> Ask who?</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> That Caster working over there. You deal with them, here.</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> Hyah!</p><p><strong>Caster Class:</strong><br> Agh... My body...!?</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> It&#39;s a Caster, so my spell won&#39;t last long. Hurry, please!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Tell us in advance next time!</p><hr><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> Okay...that makes a lot of sense.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> We knocked the enemy out. Is that a problem?</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> Not at all. I said “ask” just as a figure of speech.</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> I could get a pretty good idea on what kind of work they were doing here from their actions, methods, and leftover spells.</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> That&#39;s what I meant by “asking”.</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> It&#39;s what I imagined it&#39;d be.</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> A mechanism that draws magical energy from the leyline and sends it to the top of the tower.</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> It hasn&#39;t been turned on yet. Were they yet to test it?</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> Hmmm. I wonder how much magical energy they were planning to pull?</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> Almost enough to form a Holy Grail, I think?</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> That&#39;s quite a lot.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> Was their intent to perform some form of special summon?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Master.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Now that Xu Fu conveyed the results of her analysis, Holmes is asking you to make way to the rooftop ASAP.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Holmes asked us to assemble on the roof.</p><hr><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Hello, and apologies for the sudden roll call. I noticed some ruckus on your end as well.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> We had some confrontations on the way, but nothing Holmes couldn&#39;t easily clean up.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> I guess Diarmuid... was the star on your team.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> The opponents were not high enough in level to pose a threat. Especially not with Lady Xu Fu&#39;s support,</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> and Fujimaru&#39;s summons. Teamwork was the key to our success.</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> Words that are as pretty as your exterior. Somehow it sickens me.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> (A look of confusion)</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Are you sure about what you said down there? (I heard it from Miss Kyrielight.)</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> Hmm, I can say with 100% confidence.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Really? That&#39;s a great relief then, if only a short-lived one.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Her words sounded sinister to me, though.</p><hr><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> They are. My theory was correct.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Hence why I was in such a hurry to reach the top of the tower.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Mister Ua Duibhne, Miss Xu Fu, take a look at this. As you can see, it&#39;s empty.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> All that&#39;s left in the room is a production table. Most likely—</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> The purpose of this tower was the destruction of the Via Regia Realm.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> It should operate by syphoning energy from the leyline, converting it into physical form,</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> and subsequently firing it.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> This place was meant to be the pedestal of a turret. But evidently, we found no such weapon.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> I surmised the amount of magical energy being siphoned was far too large, and as such, they failed to produce a battery capable of withstanding it.</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> What an anticlimactic end to their story...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Before anything, we should investigate the Revenge Realm Servants involved in this operation.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> If we keep them under check, we will inevitably be preventing the forging of their cannon.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Or alternatively, should they try to do anything here, destroy the tower immediately.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> The Servants on patrol should be returning soon.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> We must take our leave at once.</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> Our next mission will be to secure an abandoned fortress. This will also be in Via Regia Realm territory.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> If we walked there, it seems like it would take all day...</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> We&#39;ll borrow a carriage from a nearby safe room and ride it there.</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> So easy~♪</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Safe rooms... You have such things here?</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> Yes. We established them at the Secretary&#39;s directive.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> We have four in the Via Regia Realm, two in the Revenge Realm, and one in the Restoration Realm.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> They are all carefully disguised, and none of them have been discovered yet.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Hmm. Impressive.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> (Still, they have a surprising amount of them. Could they serve some other purpose?)</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> I have received the keys from the Secretary. Let&#39;s go.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Keys?</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> Apparently they are sealed in such a way that they explode if you don&#39;t use the appropriate key. We&#39;ve taken every precaution.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> I see.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> If a Servant were to trespass, any attempted key would be useless...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> A forceful approach would just be to blow the whole room away. That way, no information is left to be discovered.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> What about infiltration via Spirit Form?</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> The entire area is protected by a Bounded Field, so it will explode if one is detected.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Haha, brilliant!</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> This way, if you&#39;d please.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> It looks just like ordinary wilderness...</p><hr><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> But under this broken carriage...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Whoa, amazing!</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> Hahah. I can understand your excitement. It is what you call a secret base, after all.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> A horse...?</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> It&#39;s a golem. We couldn&#39;t just leave a living horse alone in here.</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> Yeah... Like the Kabbalist Casters often make.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> In the Revenge Realm, they&#39;d have a demonic beast pulling it. I&#39;d like to ride on one of those, too, someday.</p><hr><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Are there any spare weapons here? Is it okay to take them?</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> These aren&#39;t good for much more than decoration. We only use them in emergencies.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> If that&#39;s fine with you, take as many as you want. Nobody will miss them, after all!</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Yeah, that makes sense.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Hm. There&#39;s also a defensive Mystic Code. We should probably take...no. Better stop here.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Why?</p><hr><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> (It&#39;d be problematic if the collar reacted and then exploded...)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Ah...</p><hr><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> They have wine, but no shaoxing wine. No beer either. Dang.</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> Guess I&#39;ll bring that up with the Secretary when we&#39;re done!</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> We should get moving. I will drive the coach, so everybody else get in the back.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> We will be moving rather quick, so the ride may get bumpy. Now, we sally forth! Hyah!</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> ... ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> We have arrived! Now we proceed on foot.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> Please, this way.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> ... ...I feel sick...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Me too...</p><hr><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> M-my sincerest apologies! I got carried away and drove us too quickly!</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> If I hadn&#39;t astralized myself, things might have gotten ugly...</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> You two didn&#39;t do it, so you should be careful...</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Sorry, do you have any motion sickness pills?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Here.</p><hr><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Thanks.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Even I got a little carsick, and I was watching it all on a monitor...</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> Now then. Let&#39;s move past that and start over.</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> We&#39;re near a fortress built by the Revenge Realm. They originally used it as a beachhead for an invasion of the Via Regia.</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> The battle was fierce, but the Via Regia just barely came out the winner. The Revenge Realm had no choice but to pull out of here.</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> However, the damage here was extensive, so they had to abandon the fortress.</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> Now, we want to avoid any suspicious movements, but at the same time, we can&#39;t just leave it in this state.</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> That&#39;s why we&#39;ve kept its appearance up, while secretly stockpiling supplies inside...</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> But we need to make sure it&#39;s still well-protected.</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> That said, it&#39;s still basically an abandoned fort, so it&#39;s starting to attract roaming demonic beasts.</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> I feel like our first step should be to take care of them.</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> The rearguard troops will take care of everything else, so we can just take care of exterminating these demonic beasts.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> Then let us promptly take care of this. By the way, do you know if any of them are demon boars?</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> I can&#39;t say for sure. Do you have some kind of problem with them, Diarmuid?</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> I...um...died to one.</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> Well. R.I.P. you, I suppose?</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> You&#39;re not dead yet, you know.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> No, I definitely am. Ahahaha.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> I guess so! (How can you laugh about that?)</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> We&#39;ll set up a bounded field to keep the demonic beasts from escaping the fortress.</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> After that...well...just do your thing, I guess.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> That&#39;s it...?</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> We&#39;ll just be praised as resourceful. Now get your game face on!</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> Now, to battle!</p><p><strong>Demon Boar:</strong><br> Grrrrrrrr....</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> Temporary retreat!</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> Already!?</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> ...Sorry, it was a reflex...</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> But anyway, the demon boar is but a conceptual rival to me!</p><div class="custom-container danger"><p class="custom-container-title">Flag</p><p>The following choices will trigger a different battle sequence and dialogue at the beginning of the next arrow.</p></div><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Then the rest of us will deal with it!</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> My thanks! I am counting on you!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> But with the weapons we have now...!</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> ... ...That&#39;s right!</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> At the time, I had brought fatally incompatible weapons.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> Very well! This time I shall overcome my weakness! Have at you!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><div class="custom-container warning"><p class="custom-container-title">Branch</p><p>This dialogue triggers if player selected &quot;Then the rest of us will deal with it!&quot;</p></div><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Enemy organisms completely subjugated.

Please sign the transfer.</p><p><strong>Caster Class:</strong><br> Yes, ma&#39;am.</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> We&#39;ll be taking our leave.</p><p><strong>Caster Class:</strong><br> Understood.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Phew... It&#39;d be great if we could take it slow on the way back.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> With this, our first mission was a success.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Something doesn&#39;t feel right...</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> But I guess it wasn&#39;t supposed to, considering the whole Singularity is abnormal.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Looks like we&#39;ll have to play the long game.</p><hr><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Indeed. But with that being the case...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> It rather worries me that we left him behind.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Lord Vlad, you mean?</p><hr><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Exactly.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> According to Chaldea&#39;s data, his Saint Graph hasn&#39;t disappeared—and his contract is still valid.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> He shouldn&#39;t have gone anywhere.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> We must at least isolate him elsewhere.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Can&#39;t we consult Karl der Große about transporting him?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> We should.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Let us see if he is willing to offer his assistance.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> We&#39;re arriving at the safe room. We&#39;ll be on foot from here on out.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> ... ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> —Both of them let out a sigh.</p><h2 id="section-10-the-departure-of-don-quixote-de-la-mancha" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-10-the-departure-of-don-quixote-de-la-mancha" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 10: The Departure of Don Quixote de la Mancha!</h2><p><strong>Saber Class:</strong><br> This concludes the report.</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> ...Hmm.</p><p><strong>Saber Class:</strong><br> Is anything the matter?</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> Is it possible to enquire whether more towers like this are in the vicinity of the Via Regia Realm?</p><p><strong>Assassin Class:</strong><br> Infiltrating their capital has proven difficult, but to survey the surrounding area would be simple.</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> I need you to immediately start surveying further. It&#39;s strangely curious...</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> Look into this tower a little further, Caster.</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> I&#39;ll increase your staff if need be.</p><p><strong>Caster Class:</strong><br> Yes, O Emperor.</p><p><strong>Saber Class:</strong><br> What could be in this tower?</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> ...At present, the respective war potential of the three realms is roughly equal.</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> The Revenge Realm, eagerly repeating their incursions. Our Restoration Realm, which counters them.</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> And the Via Regia Realm, who stand by to spectate and execute feints.</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> The supposition of myself and our strategists is that the time is ripe for the Revenge Realm to prepare for a full-scale invasion.</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> To that end, there must be a surefire strategy for victory.</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> And one that won&#39;t take too long, since the Via Regia are sure to interfere.</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> Which brings us to this tower. It&#39;s only natural to assume something is at play here.</p><p><strong>Saber Class:</strong><br> Then, in the event there were more towers like this—</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> The one tower is enough to investigate. Feel free to destroy it.</p><p><strong>Saber Class:</strong><br> Certainly, Your Lordship.</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> Now then, that concludes today&#39;s war council. Her Holiness Pope Joan will now conduct rites for our dead.</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> It&#39;s difficult for me...but I ask any among you with no plans to please attend if able.</p><p><strong>Saber Class:</strong><br> Of course, Your Lordship.</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> Right, I leave it to you.</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> —I pray that all of you find rest peacefully and quietly.</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> This concludes my prayers for today. Thank you all for coming.</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> Come, Bradamante, let&#39;s go.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> Yes, I&#39;ll accompany you!</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> Today went well, didn&#39;t it?</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> Oh, was there something different?</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> No, it just seemed as though we had fewer casualties.</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> It did, yes.</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> Yet just as no life is worth less than other, a lower number of lives lost is no less a tragedy.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> B-Begging your pardon...!</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> Death is such a sad thing. Not that I have any right to say, seeing as I&#39;m the one sending them to their graves.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> But it is sad indeed to die. And yet, we feel no regrets over it.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> Neither for waging rebellion against Pan-Human History, nor dying in the act... Such a strange thing.</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> But is that really all right?</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> Is what all right, Your Holiness?</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> We were told that the ruler of the Via Regia Realm is Karl der Große.</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> Was he not king to you in life?</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> —Yes, but I chose Restoration over the Via Regia.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> Our Emperor&#39;s will is what I believed to be the correct choice.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> But then, this seems to have harbored doubts about me in some of the people.</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> Hehe, that&#39;s good enough. I&#39;ll trust in your word.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> Thank you so much!</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> Of course. If you don&#39;t mind, may I treat you to a meal?</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> To... a meal?</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> Yes.</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> Of course, Servants don&#39;t need to eat. But doesn&#39;t a good meal do wonders for morale?</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> That&#39;s why the emperor has asked Servants who have the knowledge for it, to cook meals.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> Yes, I see...</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> Even if you don&#39;t feel hunger, doesn&#39;t food still taste good?</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> Of course! But where does the food originate from?</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> I don&#39;t know that much about it.</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> But it must be all right if I haven&#39;t heard any complaints!</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> All right, let&#39;s eat!</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> Yes! Let&#39;s eat!</p><p><strong>Zhang Jiao:</strong><br> The desertion of Salome leaves behind something of an ache.</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> Does it? Although it was unexpected that she didn&#39;t slice off the head of the Chaldea human,</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> I knew she would eventually turn out the way she did. You felt the same way, didn&#39;t you?</p><p><strong>Zhang Jiao:</strong><br> We were simply unlucky on when “eventually” was.</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> True enough. But it&#39;s trivial compared to that thing.</p><p><strong>Zhang Jiao:</strong><br> Hmm. Well, to look on the bright side...</p><p><strong>Zhang Jiao:</strong><br> These troubles have directed the Restoration Realm&#39;s attentions towards Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Zhang Jiao:</strong><br> Even if the state of the tower is no longer a secret, they won&#39;t be able to understand its true purpose.</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> However, some final adjustments remain. After all, it&#39;s not functional with our Servant yet, is it?</p><p><strong>Zhang Jiao:</strong><br> Its self-centering protection is far too firm.</p><p><strong>Zhang Jiao:</strong><br> Either some error arose during the summoning... Or it was that way all along.</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> No matter. In fact, isn&#39;t it more convenient like that?</p><p><strong>Zhang Jiao:</strong><br> Yes, indeed. But why are you so quick to embrace an inadequate outcome?</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> Chaldea came to us, didn&#39;t they? Then they fled to the Via Regia Realm.</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> All the pieces for this war are in place. So all that remains is to win and bring about the end.</p><p><strong>Zhang Jiao:</strong><br> One&#39;s only destination is the grave, is it?</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> That&#39;s just fine. We are both not afraid to meet our end.</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> Isn&#39;t that what rebelling against Pan-Human History is all about?</p><p><strong>Zhang Jiao:</strong><br> Well, now. Of course it is. But is that really all right with you?</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> How would it not be?</p><p><strong>Zhang Jiao:</strong><br> Just a thought, mind you. Your actual wish may not come true.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> If any Servant other than these two had been present,</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> they would have been convinced they&#39;d just been killed.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Killing intent of such magnitude, of such intense emotion, densely flooded the chamber.</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> —Next time, I&#39;ll kill you.</p><p><strong>Zhang Jiao:</strong><br> Hwoh hwoh hwoh! Excuse me for that.</p><p><strong>Zhang Jiao:</strong><br> To an old fellow like myself, that much killing intent is pure poison.</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> Hmph...</p><p><strong>Zhang Jiao:</strong><br> Now, I&#39;ll be off to begin the final adjustments. I won&#39;t be able to assist you for some time.</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> Well, how lucky for you.</p><p><strong>Zhang Jiao:</strong><br> Oh, how horrible...</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> My wish, huh?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> —My wish. It goes without saying that I have one.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> My husband, hero of all. A man full of deceit.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I want to show that man, to tell him, that it was his fault.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> A child, a woman, an elder, or a dear friend. Anybody would suffice.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I want to throw their innards in his face.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> What he tried to protect. What he tried to cherish.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> What I could never be to him. I want to lay it all to waste.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> If he would save a hundred people, then I want to kill a thousand.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Although it&#39;s just as likely it won&#39;t faze him at all.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> A heart like diamond and as generous as the sea.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> —As far as I&#39;m concerned, he&#39;s an insensitive and ill-bred man.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> But I suppose that&#39;s what comes of trying to see the good in things.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I want to see you and speak with you when it&#39;s all over. To tell you that everything was useless and in vain.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>But this wish is a difficult one to grant.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Whatever the Realm, he&#39;ll assuredly be positioned to rebel against Pan-Human History if summoned.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> In other words, on the allied side. That doesn&#39;t change even among the Restoration or Via Regia.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I am at a total loss.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Being his nemesis is what I want. I must declare him my sworn enemy and then end his life.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> So when I learned of Chaldea&#39;s invasion, it brought something close to anticipation.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Yet it seems the [♂ boy /♀️ girl] unfortunately did not bring that man along with [♂ him /♀️ her].</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Which means all that&#39;s left is to fall back on the narrow hope that he will be summoned on Pan-Human History&#39;s side.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Nonetheless, that is another pipe dream. I can only continue to fulfil my duties, and let things take their course.</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> How very unlike me to be fighting for my Master instead of for myself.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> —The prayer had weight to it. —The prayer had sincerity to its timbre.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Yes, sincere and heavy. To such a degree that it readily supported the rebellion against Pan-Human History.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Just what kind of Master are they? I can&#39;t even understand that much.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> The belief in the righteousness of this wish is what&#39;s fuelling us all to—</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Good day, Queen of Revenge.</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> Oh, it&#39;s you. What brings you here?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Why, only to cheer you on. Nothing more, nothing less.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> My objective is for any of the three realms to claim all the Grails.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> I don&#39;t care which of you does. You should all strive to do your utmost.</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> —There&#39;s one thing I&#39;d like to ask.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> What is it?</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> I wonder if that&#39;s also what the Master wishes of us?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> ...A difficult question.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Such is the consequence of responsibility. There is meaning in all this blood and death.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> And there is but one being who must not win, but that needn&#39;t concern you.</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> ...I see.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Does that trouble you?</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> Oh, no.</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> I hardly know what to say to an abrupt intruder, so I merely posed a half-hearted question.</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> It doesn&#39;t matter, not one bit.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> ...Hmm, I suppose I&#39;m not welcome here.</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> Have you any information on the Restoration or the Via Regia?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> That would violate fair play.</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> Then I have less and less use for you.</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> Follow me around like this any longer and I will have to denounce you as a stalker.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> ...That would be harsh indeed.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> I should think you originally meant to ask more. For instance, about the absence of a certain Servant...</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> But is that presuming too much? A pity.</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> ... ...</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Well, goodbye then.</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> Goodbye, good-for-nothing.</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> ...Hmph.</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> If all you&#39;re doing is moving the pieces, you&#39;re a fool.</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> Yet if you set yourself down on the board, you&#39;re nothing more than another piece.</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> You have all the makings of a grandmaster, but you chose not to pursue that path.</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> What an admirable act. Upstanding, to the point where you&#39;ve wrapped yourself back around into being a fool.</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> A mathematician should know better.</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> I see... So you wish to save Vlad III?</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> Ooh... Señor Vlad, the great hero of Romania!</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> Although his reputation as Lord Impaler is not the most pleasant.</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> Maybe he&#39;s reasonable once you get to know him!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> It&#39;s fine. He&#39;s a very well-mannered king.</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> Oh-ho... A well-mannered king, you say...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Just don&#39;t call him a vampire and it&#39;s no problem.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> (He&#39;s a lot like a Dead Apostle in the way he fights, though...)</p><hr><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> ... ...</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> It&#39;s too late to swap places now, your grace. It would be too obvious at this point.</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> Hm... That&#39;s true...</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> Be that as it may, we definitely cannot leave him as he is now.</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> ...We of the Via Regia are in need of power, but more than that, we need insight.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> So, you are saying you need someone knowledgeable in military affairs?</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> Yes, we do.</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> I&#39;ve managed to somehow prevent our management from being swamped by performing multiple roles...</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> But this is as far as I can bring us. I was never able to devise a winning strategy from the start.</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> That is why we should rescue Vlad III, and cure him if at all possible.</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> ...we would be happy to take that upon ourselves, if you don&#39;t mind.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> ...In other words...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> You have a high-level healing or restorative Noble Phantasm capable of bringing Vlad III back to his full strength—</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Is that what you are implying?</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> I don&#39;t mean to say it&#39;ll be without issues. It&#39;s a gamble, to be quite honest.</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> Gambling is bad, Sancho.</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> Agreed.</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> Countless mages have been ruined betting on the long odds of a casino...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Is that true?</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> Ah, that&#39;s right.</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> You were raised in the sheltered environment of Chaldea, Mash.</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> Mages are fundamentally arrogant, and believe everything goes the way they believe it should.</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> I&#39;ve known too many with that mindset, and it only gets worse with prestige.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I see...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Magecraft does allow one to make the seemingly impossible possible...</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> And that&#39;s where it all starts.</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> Gambling also works under the assumption that you can win.</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> Cheats and rigged games can be reliably detected with magecraft.</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> If anything, there&#39;s no better tool than magecraft to allow you to cheat yourself.</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> In other words, they&#39;ll always win.</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> That&#39;s the way they think.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> But...that&#39;s still gambling, isn&#39;t it?</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> It is.</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> Gambling fairly and without cheating means that you have a 50% chance of losing.</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> Well, about half of the mages win, right? But what do you think they do after that?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ... ...Pour all their winnings into the next bet?</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> Yes, that&#39;s how it goes... you just end up convinced you&#39;ll win the next one too, strangely enough.</p><p><strong>Meunière:</strong><br> You sound like you speak from personal experience, old man... like you were in a no-win situation...</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> No, I&#39;m a winner! Even in a situation like this, I&#39;m still alive, aren&#39;t I?</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fooofoouve.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It seems like Fou is praising your positivity.</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> Hah hah hah, thanks, hah hah hah. (Dry laughter)</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> Well, thank you. Those were some nice messages by Chaldea&#39;s... leader?</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> That gentleman sounded like a leader. But I&#39;m afraid we slipped a bit off-topic.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Sorry about that...</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> No, no. Don&#39;t worry about it.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> He just can&#39;t keep his mouth shut about gambling...</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> I see. So he lost everything that way...</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> How sad...</p><hr><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> —Anyway, back to our bet.</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> ...Normally this would only have a 30% chance of success.</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> Normally it just fails—by which I mean, 50% of the time, nothing happens.</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> There&#39;s a 20% chance of it failing fatally—which would result in damage to the Saint Graph.</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> Master Fujimaru, Master of Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> What are your thoughts? I leave the final decision in your hands.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Do it, please.</p><hr><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> ...You sure about this?</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> We can&#39;t just decide like that when Vlad&#39;s freaking free will is sealed.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> It&#39;s what Lord Vlad would have done.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> ...I see.</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> Your understanding of Servants is splendid. I applaud your judgment.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> It&#39;s what I would want if I were him.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> I see...</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> No, I&#39;m honestly impressed. I&#39;m not being sarcastic or anything.</p><hr><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> Well, sir?</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> Um...huh?</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> Have you not been listening, sir? We are setting out.</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> Setting out...?</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> Yes.</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> To destroy the gaol Vlad III imposed upon himself.</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> We shall use our Noble Phantasm.</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> Ooh...ooh! That! Of course!</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> “Valiente Asalto Dedicado a la Princesa: Aah, I dedicate my spear to my beloved princess!”</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> Wrong.</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> Oh nyoh.</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> A Noble Phantasm of our level will not be able to breach the stakes that Lord Vlad has imprisoned himself upon.</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> Th-then... why do I have to go?</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> Because—</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> Because!</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> It&#39;s a secret~♪</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> SAAAAANCHO—!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> (Doesn&#39;t she remind you of a certain little imp?)</p><hr><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> ... ...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Are you getting a headache, Kadoc?</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> No... it&#39;s nothing.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> (Don&#39;t dwell on the past, Kadoc.

Did you eat something strange?</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> When I was alive, I ate what I thought was dragon meat. It was actually lizard.</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> Oh, that was wonderful. It never appeared in the story though.</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> I guess they didn&#39;t like the idea of a strange joke about food.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> N-no, it&#39;s nothing.

There is a Noble Phantasm, but not one for attacking, such as an anti-army type?</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> Yes, precisely.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Don Quixote&#39;s Noble Phantasm... To nullify the condition of Vlad III...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> ... ...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> The less said—the better, you might say?</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> As well put as an English gentleman would. But you&#39;ll know everything soon enough.</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> —As if executed by impalement, the man stood there still.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Stained with fresh blood, and swaying along whilst being blown by the wind, he looked like a rotting corpse.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> But he was alive.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> This is the kind of location either Restoration or Revenge could come through, right?</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> So why is he still here?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> See for yourself.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> A stone...?</p><hr><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> The moment he senses something moving around him, it automatically activates his Noble Phantasm.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> He may have manipulated his psyche when driving the stakes through himself.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Talk about monstrous...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> &quot;Monstrous&quot; is too harsh.</p><hr><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> I don&#39;t mean like that.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> The mentality of it is monstrous.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> What would you or I have done in that messy situation?</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> I think all I had on my mind was running away.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> So did I, I might add.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> I could come up with the notion of sealing myself, but beyond that, I don&#39;t think I&#39;d consider the need to defend myself.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> I may be intelligent, but I have no experience as a Heroic Spirit on the battlefield.</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> But... for the time being, we must put a halt to this self-defense...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> That much cannot be helped. Let us neutralise the threat in combat.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> The two of you, use the Noble Phantasm when Master signals.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> [♂ Mister /♀️ Miss] Fujimaru, can we ask your help?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Leave it to me!</p><hr><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Just be careful.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Getting killed by your own Servant would be no laughing matter.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> All right.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Now, for the time being, let us ask our Lord Vlad to calm down.</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Now!</p><hr><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> Understood!</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> Then do as I showed you before, your grace! Shut your eyes!</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> Y-Yeah!</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> —Recover, recover, recover.</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> The completed book is closed, and you awaken from your warm dreams.</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> Be cured of your ailments. All is in the past.</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> We must abandon our dreams in order to survive.</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> Activate Noble Phantasm. Return to reality.</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> Alas, This Brutal but Kind Reality— Triste Suave Alonso Quijano</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...! Surrounding magical energy is decreasing rapidly!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> This is... At this rate...Vlad will be unable to maintain his existence!</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> Yes, because that is the power of this Noble Phantasm.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Wha—</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> I imagined this would be the case. You called it a return to reality.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> You sent Lord Vlad here back— to 17th century Spain.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> There is no Singularity, nor any magecraft or mysteries. Just a rustic countryside, simple and tranquil.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> In the region where Don Quixote lived.</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> Wait, wait, wait.</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> In the 17th century, Mystery won&#39;t have been quite as diminished as it is today.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> It shouldn&#39;t be more than a small deviation compared to the Age of Gods, but that may indeed be true.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> However, Director, that is at best an extrapolation across the world as a whole.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> The focus of this Noble Phantasm is much less broad.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> It forcibly returns the Servant to a rural reality where neither magecraft nor Mystery are observed.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Thereby voiding the contract with Master, and cutting off one&#39;s supply of magical energy for sustenance.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Even the Skill of Independent Action is disabled.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> That is because there was no hero called Vlad III in 17th century Spain.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Of course, whatever power Moriarty made use of to brainwash Vlad III—</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> It too fades away like a dream.</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> ...Although it goes no further than that. Truthfully, this Noble Phantasm has a major flaw.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> What flaw...?</p><hr><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> If we overuse it, we too shall disappear.</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> I see... So that explains the peacefulness I&#39;m feeling...</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> What is he going on about all of a sudden!? Do something, will you?</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> Right, cancel the Noble Phantasm! Right now!</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> (Good, it didn&#39;t cause them to disappear. Since it didn&#39;t completely remove the effects of the Noble Phantasm...)</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> (The compulsion for Lord Vlad to rebel should, as Miss Sancho calculated, now be removed.)</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> (As for his combat ability, it&#39;s 50-50—)</p><p><strong>H：Vlad III:</strong><br> ... ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Are you all right, Lord Vlad?</p><hr><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> ...Heh. To think Master would ever inquire about my physical condition.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> I&#39;m glad to say that my maladies have run their course.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> It appears that you have recovered your reason, Lord Vlad.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> And what of the rebelliousness from before?</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> ...Hmph, it barely warrants asking. I am recovered.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> The embers may linger, but I have enough rationality to keep them in check.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Pray tell, what you&#39;ve done?</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> I assumed that rescue would follow with the correction of the Singularity...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Um, the thing is—</p><hr><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> We would like to explain in full, but this is enemy territory.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Let us be underway first.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Sooner the better. Phew, I don&#39;t sweat like this on a normal day...</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> All&#39;s well that ends well, isn&#39;t it!</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> I should say so!</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Don&#39;t the two of you know that you were real close to disappearing under any normal circumstance?</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> The Via Regia Realm was kind of on the verge of total annihilation.</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> Tosh, Sir Kadoc. That is a form of adventure!</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> Adventure, yeah!</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> Adventure, yeah!</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> ...Fujimaru, say something.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Adventure, yeah!</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Not that!</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> (Gaze of tender affection)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Thank you so much!</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> Not at all. You&#39;re welcome.</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> Folks such as us saving a hero of such distinction—</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> By gum, it&#39;s like something out of a dream!</p><hr><h2 id="section-11-vlad-iii-returns" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-11-vlad-iii-returns" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 11: Vlad III Returns</h2><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Now I see.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Until the Singularity is corrected, myself engaging in combat will not be possible...</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> In addition, I have one more announcement.</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> We, too, are incapacitated for some time in the aftermath of that Noble Phantasm.</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> We&#39;re at the level where if we should try and attack any windmills, we stand to go flying.</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> Really, Sancho. Have I grown that weak?</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> You have. Please see for yourself by attacking Master Holmes.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Eh?</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> All right, let&#39;s give it a go! I&#39;m charging at you!</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> Uooooohh!</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> (After a moment&#39;s hesitation, he puts his palm on Don Quixote&#39;s head)</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> Woryaaahhhh, oryaaaaaaah.</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> Huff...</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> Hmm, it&#39;s a draw. Ha-ha-ha!</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> Fujimaru, drop to the ground.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Do I have to!?</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> I know it&#39;s the cliché response, but I can&#39;t help but want to!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Down!</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> Mm. Well done!</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Is that some sort of ritual?</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> (Silently downs headache medicine)</p><hr><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Hmm.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Was it decided that you required my wisdom, even at the cost of forfeiting his powers as king of his realm?</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> Yes. Our power is, after all, not substantial to begin with.</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> If the kings of both realms were to launch a serious attack, the result would not change, even if we were at full strength.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> ...Having said that, how could you abandon the power you had been given without hesitation?</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> An act of selflessness, or just the opposite, selfishness?</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> ... ...</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Pardon me. I am showing discourtesy to those who have revived me.</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> Not at all.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> First of all, we should take a look around the Via Regia city. I will inspect our armaments—</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> No, I am jumping ahead of myself here. I have something important to first take care of.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Such as?</p><hr><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> A few things.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> My True Name is Vlad III, Servant of Chaldea, and class Berserker.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> I have now rejoined the fight.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Keep up the good work, Lord Vlad.</p><hr><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Of course.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Although it is difficult at present for me to become your spear, there is still much work to be done.</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> ... ...</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> Your grace?</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> There... That there is how a knight and lord ought to look...!</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> If only I could do that!</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> ...Ahem. Welcome back, your grace.</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> ...Something&#39;s off...</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> ... ...</p><p><strong>C：Dulcinea:</strong><br> O my knight, Don Quixote, be selfish and I will slap you silly.</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> Whyaow!? My deepest apologies!</p><p><strong>C：Dulcinea:</strong><br> Very good.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> What was that...?</p><hr><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> One of the components of Miss Sancho is apparently Princess Dulcinea.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> According to the story of “Don Quixote”, one of the reasons he travels...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> ...is to proclaim Princess Dulcinea&#39;s beauty.</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> Hehe, it is an embarrassing account.</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> It&#39;s awful on my heart when she transforms all in a flash...</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> I don&#39;t care♪</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> Without a care in the world...</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> I&#39;m finding the loss of Vlad III&#39;s powers in combat to be a dire one...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> That may be true... but it&#39;s hard to say that this time around.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Since we do have military strength of our own to stand against the others.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> But up to this point, we&#39;ve lacked the tactical expertise to put all that to work.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> If Vlad can compensate with this—then it might not be so significant of a loss.</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> It may turn out that way...but our own forces seem, well...</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> Now then, we will both be on our way first.</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> We&#39;ll see you soon in the throne room... (Mumble, mumble)</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> Excuse us!</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Now then, [♂ Mister /♀️ Miss] Fujimaru and Kadoc, let&#39;s take a walk around town.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> As before, we&#39;ll be applying Servant&#39;s disguises to the two of you.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> ...Hmm. Lively, but lacking in ambition. Morale is moderate.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> But, regrettably... they are without motivation.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Motivation... I see.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Since the realm&#39;s entire populace is made up of Servants, it is safe to say that we have universal conscription.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Of course, it bears consideration that the longer this war drags out, the lower motivation and morale will drop.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> War removes people from their daily lives, and those engaged in prolonged battle grow weary of war.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> ...For as long as this war continues, those who have grown weary of war will fall behind in the fight.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> According to what I heard earlier, military drills will commence soon.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Why don&#39;t we head that way?</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Mm, we shall.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Hey, Fujimaru.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Yeah?</p><hr><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Do you think we&#39;re included in the drills too?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Seems that way.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> I guess so...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> A little hope never hurt anyone...!</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> I&#39;m all out of hope. Optimism&#39;s faded clear into resignation.</p><hr><p><strong>Saber Class:</strong><br> Ready, slash!</p><p><strong>Archer Class:</strong><br> Take aim, fire!</p><p><strong>Lancer Class:</strong><br> Oraoraora!</p><p><strong>Lancer Class:</strong><br> Behold my spearmanship, which once bore the title of “gale”!</p><p><strong>Assassin Class:</strong><br> I presume that was self-proclaimed!?</p><p><strong>Caster Class:</strong><br> Mumble...mumble... Why can&#39;t I use Rapid Casting...?</p><p><strong>Caster Class:</strong><br> After all the studies I put myself through as an alchemist...</p><p><strong>Caster Class:</strong><br> ...I guess...I&#39;m just...tongue-tied...</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> Oh, I&#39;m surprised at how vigorous they are...</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Well. Not that it&#39;s my place to say, but isn&#39;t this good enough?</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> This is—more than regrettable.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> So what&#39;s your take?</p><hr><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Not here. First we wait for the audience with the king—Karl der Große.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> If only so as not to tell the same story twice.</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> They won&#39;t pass muster?</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Not at all.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> —For argument&#39;s sake, let us suppose the situation turns out entirely in our favor.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Specifically, a best case scenario where an all-out war between the Revenge and Restoration Realms ends with one of them wiped out,</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> and the military strength of the remaining realm is substantially diminished.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> With the current state of affairs in this realm, we still stand to be utterly defeated.</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> Th-That bad...</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Humm...</p><p><strong>Roland:</strong><br> Hngh...</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> The two Servants there seem to grasp the general idea as to why.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Uh, well, roughly? We were part of the Twelve Paladins.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> That is, we&#39;ve got experience serving as respectable officers.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> But where the other Servants are concerned...</p><hr><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Right.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> There are heroes, soldiers, those who fought in major battles. All kinds of people.</p><p><strong>Roland:</strong><br> But that adds up to a heaping mess. There&#39;s no way to unify them.</p><p><strong>Roland:</strong><br> It takes all we&#39;ve got just to command a small unit.</p><p><strong>Roland:</strong><br> Perfect discipline in an army with just two Servants in command is next to impossible. Diarmuid and Xu Fu, well...too little, too late.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> As far as I am aware, Kriemhild of the Revenge Realm and Constantine of the Restoration Realm</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> each have complete command over their armies. By comparison, we are a rabble.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> In the end, can we unite as an army?</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Everything here hangs on the Via Regia Realm to do so.</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> Then what exactly should we do?</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Since ancient times, there has been but one means to form an army out of common soldiers.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> That is, to drill them.</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> Military drills...</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> It would be pointless for each individual to put whatever effort they prefer into their training, as they do now.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> They must come together as an army and move as though they were one living thing.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Otherwise, there will be many issues larger than the fight ahead of them.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> I would like you to announce that joint exercises for all Servants of the Via Regia Realm will commence early tomorrow morning.</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> Yes, right away.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Our first formations will be temporary, and will be reorganized as training continues.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> For should we assign positions for each Servant on an individual basis, or should we group alike Classes together?</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> What kind of units will be necessary, and of what strengths? Where are we most lacking?</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> These are all matters to sort out.</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> ...Hey, Sancho?</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> I&#39;d advise not to say you want to hand over your throne and crown, your worship.</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> Yessirrrrrrr!</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> If I do say so myself... No, the right Servant to sit on the throne isn&#39;t me by any stretch!</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Unfortunately, you must not. As I am now, there exists no ability for me to lead on the front lines.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Above all, you have already taken the name of Karl der Große.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> With abdication unfeasible, I am unconvinced that your successor could even be myself.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Karl der Große is who you are, and that can no longer be changed.</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> Ugh...</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> You shall no longer be allowed to flee.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Even if a cliff lies before you, you must crawl up in order to reach the other side.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Do not falter. Steel yourself like iron with lies and pretense. You are king. That is now an unchanging matter.</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> ... ...All right...</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> Please rest assured, sir.</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> In the event of any emergency, I will take care of things.</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> ...Urgh...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Hmm.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> (That statement from Miss Sancho was full of confidence. If the stories hold true, Don Quixote should be feeling relief.)</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> (But his current expression is... filled with guilt.)</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> ... ...</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Tomorrow&#39;s military drills require all of you to participate, including Master.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> As expected, it is impractical to summon Servants during drills, where you have prying eyes all around...</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Although, as long as you refrain from utilizing their Noble Phantasms, you can possibly assert yourself as a summoner who conjures shadow soldiers.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> U-Understood!</p><hr><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> I expect you to advise Master as a mage, Kadoc.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> That&#39;s a big role. I&#39;ll do my utmost.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Holmes, you are the great detective. Therefore, you must be able to see what I cannot.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Even lacking in military expertise, can you meet my expectations?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Of course I can.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> I guess it&#39;s nice to be working with you, Master [♂ guy /♀️ girl].</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> Say, as for us—</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Yours is the most difficult task.</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> A-And what is it?</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Do nothing. Trust us and stand watch.</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> ...But to do nothing?</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> You are Karl der Große, and therefore should not allow yourself to step forward or to fight.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Your job is to trust in your subordinates.</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> ...Of course!</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Now, Master and Kadoc may attend to their rest. I shall retire, too, for a time.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> (Can&#39;t get back to sleep...)</p><hr><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> Oh, [♂ Señor /♀️ Señorita] Fujimaru?</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> I wonder if there&#39;s anything wrong? Could something be troubling you...?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I just got up for a bit and can&#39;t sleep again.</p><hr><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> Hahaha, us old men don&#39;t sleep all that well. But you&#39;re just a pup, Master.</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> Sancho!</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> Right here, what do you need? Some cocoa, I take it?</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> Just what my lovely maid would have in mind.</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> Hehehe, you&#39;re welcome. Won&#39;t be a minute.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> That reminds me... How did you end up as king?</p><hr><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> It&#39;s not so long a story... Just the way things turned out.</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> Yes, it&#39;s really just how things turned out.</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> I became aware that I was a Servant fighting for Pan-Human History. In other words, an enemy of the Servants in these realms.</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> It might be safe to call it a stroke of luck.</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> Before I even got a word out, Sancho shut me up and feigned that we were their comrades.</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> And when we snuck into the Revenge Realm to collect information, I knew it would be a dead end.</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> My body could survive that Realm, but my psyche certainly couldn&#39;t.</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> I am somewhat cowardly. And yet, the Restoration Realm wasn&#39;t much different.</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> Although their motives and methods differ, their goal is rebellion against Pan-Human History.</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> After much deliberation on the matter, we decided to move someplace where the influence of the two realms would do less harm.</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> And then suddenly, I noticed. There were other Servants running away alongside me.</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> When Sancho figured out there were other Servants on the side of Pan-Human History, she suggested we make a place for them.</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> Me? All I did was run around in circles.</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> The only times I was useful were when I had a few fights with demonic beasts...</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> All I did was raise my hand when the decision came that someone had to be king of the realm.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Isn&#39;t that a great feat...?</p><hr><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> Oh no, it wasn&#39;t great of me at all. Nothing about it was great.</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> After all, I&#39;m—not even in my prime. My body and mind can be only in an aged state.</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> The story of Don Quixote begins and ends with me still an old man.</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> Those who knew me only knew me as an old man. That&#39;s why my appearance shows my age like this.</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> Haha... My stomach was in all kinds of knots after calling myself so lofty a name as Karl der Große.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> The ambience is pretty different from daytime...</p><hr><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> The nights can be so lonesome. They make me go back to my old self.</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> Though I know you find me depressing...</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> Sir, Master Fujimaru, I&#39;ve brought the cocoa.</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> Oh, Sancho. Thank you.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Thank you very much.</p><hr><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> No problem at all.</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> Mm. It&#39;s sweet. Sweet and delicious.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> It&#39;s really tasty!</p><hr><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> Hehehe, I&#39;m honored to receive your compliments.</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> Hrmm.</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> Drinking cocoa like this, it&#39;s an easy way to forget that you&#39;re a knight...</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> Oh, that won&#39;t do. We&#39;ll need to swear it off, then.</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> Knock it off. It&#39;s one of the few pleasures this old man has, all right?</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> Only a joke.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> From what I heard...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Did you take charge of the realm, Sancho?</p><hr><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> Not at all. I merely offered suggestions.</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> After all, I am also an ultra-helpful maid.</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> What his grace wishes is the duty of his squire to make happen.</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> He became king because it is the station of least danger.</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> If we were to go serve on the front lines, we would be treated like any common soldiers.</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> I can&#39;t let him die so easily...</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> When sitting on the throne, I&#39;m basically just giving off grunts and mutterings anyway.</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> A king can be like that. They&#39;re like parents to adolescent children.</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> Right. I&#39;m the official third wheel of the Via Regia!</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> Just stand tall and proud. That&#39;s all it takes to be a king.</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> I suppose...</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> [♂ Señor /♀️ Señorita] Fujimaru, what are your thoughts?</p><div class="custom-container warning"><p class="custom-container-title">Branch</p><p>Branched scenes depending on choice.</p></div><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I think that&#39;d be the best course.</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> I agree. You see, your worship?</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> Stand graceful, like a majestic bird.</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> Hm! Give me some wings and I&#39;ll be Swan Quixote!</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> ...Sorry about that...</p><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> No, hey, forget it...</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> How pitiful, your worship...</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> Don&#39;t feel pity! At least be angry with me! You&#39;ll make me three times as miserable!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Maybe make your own move when it counts most.</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> So that&#39;s the way it&#39;s got to be... Hrm.</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> Yes, sir. Make a move when it counts the most.</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> Any other time, do nothing.</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> Hm, do nothing...</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> Then that is just where the matter rests, at least for the time being.</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> I wonder if it will...?</p><div class="custom-container warning"><p class="custom-container-title">Branch</p><p>Branch end.</p></div><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> That was delicious. I&#39;d better be getting back.</p><hr><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> ... ...</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> Don&#39;t you want to talk some more?</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> No... I have to get an early start. We should all be getting some rest.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Good night, then.</p><hr><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> ...No good?</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> ...It&#39;s difficult to say. Apologies can&#39;t be made without courage.</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> From your point of view, Sancho, how&#39;s that Master of Chaldea look to you?</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> I&#39;m not so good at judging people.</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> ...I think [♂ he /♀️ she] is a good person. Most importantly, a person willing to accept apologies.</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> Chaldea is here, your grace. It&#39;s not as though you don&#39;t know what that means, do you?</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> They have walked right in. Therefore, there is no cause for concern.</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> ...Hrm. Even then...</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> ...All of this means nothing to me. The one thing we need, your worship, is your spirit.</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> Although—</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> Hm?</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> Depending on how things go, a mere apology might not suffice.</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> ... ...</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> It&#39;s high time we headed back to the throne. Karl der Große has returned from battle.</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> —Troops, my True Name is Vlad III.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> At this time, I am one who has been invited to support the Via Regia Realm by Karl der Große.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> ...Due to certain circumstances, I have lost my power as a Servant.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> But, as a result...</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> I have been entrusted with full authority over the army at His Majesty&#39;s pleasure.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> As commander-in-chief, or simply general. That is the duty to which I have been entrusted.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Let any who are not content offer objection.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> ...hmph. I am glad there seems to be no discontent with my position.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Now, we will commence our training post-haste.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> From this point, you must be commanded as a single army, not as individual heroes.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Not lone heroes, but compositions of several into units, who when united then form an army.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> ...But I know words alone will not convince you. That goes for all present.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Your achievements as individuals are what made you Heroic Spirits.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Your mindset is likely, “I will do as I please, because I&#39;m strong.”</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> That being the case, we shall first start with maneuvers.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> I will put together a unit, keeping numbers to a minimum.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> The scenario is as follows: You, as a larger force, will conduct a siege on our smaller group.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> However, our reinforcements will arrive in due time.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Until then, we shall see if you can break through our defenses.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Given these factors, victory for you is assured, and defeat unacceptable.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> —Such an easy task should be no problem for you, surely?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> The provocation was strong enough to incite the proud Servants.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> “Yeah, I&#39;ll do this.” “I&#39;ll show you my strength.” “Don&#39;t you cry foul.” “I will take you down.”</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Amid angry roars from left and right, Vlad III ordered his Casters to build a temporary fortress.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> The fortress was likely too frail to survive a Servant attack, as its unimpressive appearance suggested.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Vlad III entered the stage of his besiegement, accompanied by a small group of Servants, and shut the gates behind him.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> —There were three hours left until the designated start time.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> The Servants chosen for Vlad&#39;s side ran about restlessly.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> A few grumbled complaints about why they were doing this.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> Since you had us chosen for this mission, you can trust we shall carry it out faithfully.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Good.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> However, Sir Vlad, why choose a siege?</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Defense is my field of expertise. Moreover, no one ought dare voice a complaint if we win under these circumstances.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> Yes, I see!</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Caster, Fujimaru.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> H-Here.</p><hr><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> As I said before, you can&#39;t use your Noble Phantasm. But it is unnecessary to defeat them.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> This is a battle of attrition. An ongoing test of endurance and tenacity. I trust that you will organize your team with that in mind.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Your team includes Holmes, Xu Fu, and Roland.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> The fort has deliberate holes, making it easily occupiable if those are crossed.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> They will first attack with brute force, and failing that, take notice of the holes.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> But looking from the other angle...</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Once they take notice of the holes, their attack will be extremely predictable.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Whether on the offensive or the defensive, the important thing is to analyze the behavior of the enemy force.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> A signal will be sent. Hide near the holes until then, lying in wait to ambush the enemy.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Roger that!</p><hr><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Mm. Stay firm.</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> Hiya. Now, I will tag along as usual, offering support without fighting directly.</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> What&#39;s with that look of “I don&#39;t know why I expected any different?”</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> You&#39;re exactly the same, you know. Na-na na-na-na!</p><p><strong>Roland:</strong><br> All right already. Stop dawdling and set up that spell we discussed.</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> Oh-kay. Mumble, mumble... Hup.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Were you even trying with that chant?</p><hr><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> Oh, shut it. It&#39;s not about the words, it&#39;s about the feelings. Feeeelings.</p><p><strong>Roland:</strong><br> Didn&#39;t look like you were trying too hard with the feelings, either. I&#39;ll let it slide though, for my broken heart is used to such things.</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> Try saying your big heart is forgiving instead. Way to be a downer, dude.</p><p><strong>Roland:</strong><br> My bad. And, here they come.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> A side gate was secretly built to the right of the rear gate.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> The gate is expected to be too small for a chariot to enter, but multiple people can enter simultaneously without difficulty.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> ...And it seems the enemy is also aware of that. Word should be spreading through the ranks.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> In other words, it will not be Riders we face.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> But those skilled in close combat, such as Sabers and Lancers, as well as Assassins—</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Therein is Lord Vlad&#39;s conjecture.</p><p><strong>Roland:</strong><br> ...They&#39;re here.</p><p><strong>Roland:</strong><br> Now!</p><p><strong>G：Saber Class:</strong><br> Damn, an ambush! Fall back, now!</p><p><strong>K：Lancer Class:</strong><br> What!? Easier said than done...!</p><p><strong>Roland:</strong><br> Hwahahaha! Then we&#39;ll just attack as we like!</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> Yay, it feels so good to beat someone so utterly helpless to a pulp!</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> Nyah-nyah! Your stupid plan is blowing right up in your stupid faces♪</p><p><strong>Assassin Class:</strong><br> Ugh... That Caster there&#39;s the worst! What kind of stupid doll is that, anyway?</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> ... ...I&#39;ll kill them!!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Okay, closing in!</p><hr><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> Right. We have about five seconds until Lady Xu Fu takes matters into her own...fists. Better stop her!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Saber Class:</strong><br> Retreat! Retreat!</p><p><strong>Lancer Class:</strong><br> Damn, and we thought the plan was solid too!</p><p><strong>Saber Class:</strong><br> To think we were defeated by such a motley crew! The disgrace on the name of my knightly order... Nkh!</p><p><strong>Lancer Class:</strong><br> I&#39;ll say. How did we lose to such a crappy unit...?</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> What&#39;s wrong, bonehead? It ain&#39;t gonna be an open casket once I&#39;m done with you!</p><p><strong>Saber Class:</strong><br> Hot foot it out of here!</p><p><strong>Roland:</strong><br> Nice work with the sour grapes there. Now, that concludes our duties.</p><p><strong>Roland:</strong><br> By the looks of things, they went pretty much as expected... Shall we go check on Lord Vlad, just in case?</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> —And with that, I hereby take charge of the army. You will be commanded thus.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> I take it there are no objections?</p><p><strong>Saber Class:</strong><br> N-No, none...</p><p><strong>Caster Class:</strong><br> A demon, he&#39;s a demon...</p><p><strong>Rider Class:</strong><br> Seriously, what happened... How were we supposed to win...?</p><p><strong>Archer Class:</strong><br> We can&#39;t even destroy one piddly fort... As heroes, our prestige ought to be weeping...</p><p><strong>D：???:</strong><br> It all went as expected, but what a sight to behold. Ah, this is Sancho.</p><p><strong>C：???:</strong><br> Scary... So scary...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Heh, are you two all right?</p><hr><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> Just fine, since the castle is almost entirely empty.</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> I&#39;m reminded how there&#39;s nothing quite as scary as a well-led army.</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> That&#39;s true. I am so relieved we succeeded in the rescue campaign.</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> If we leave military matters to Lord Vlad, things can be brought up to a satisfactory standard for now.</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> Mm. ...In which case.</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> Yes, I will consult with Lord Vlad from this point on, and I am sure we will see results.</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> It&#39;s good to be working with you all.</p><h2 id="section-12-planning-the-assassination" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-12-planning-the-assassination" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 12: Planning the Assassination</h2><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> ...And so, we were successfully able to have Lord Vlad take on military responsibilities.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> It was only my great pleasure to do so. I stake my honor on your victory.</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> And yet, here we are, finally at the starting line. We&#39;re considerably behind where we should be.</p><p><strong>Roland:</strong><br> Stay positive, Sancho. We&#39;re merely conserving our strength.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Yeah, smooth words make smooth ways! I happen to be an expert on that!</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Now then, Lord Vlad.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Naturally, we shall continue honing our military prowess. What follows on from that?</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Mm. Well, I would like everyone to please look at this map.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> There are many things we need to accomplish, but we currently have only three possible routes.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Stay on the defensive, or go on the offensive? And if we choose the latter, do we move against the Restoration or the Revenge Realm?</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Based on the information gathered from the spies Sancho has sent out—we should launch an attack against the Revenge Realm.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Why is that?</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> ...If you take the long-term view,</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> the Restoration Realm has better generals at their disposal, and there is a strong chance that they will grow stronger in terms of influence.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> However...</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> For better or worse, Constantine XI is not one prone to duplicity.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> His fundamental aim is to be the dominant force here in this Singularity. He believes he can win under his power alone, without the need for the enemy to first show their hand.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> However, the Revenge Realm is different.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> They will sit back and watch play unfold, then double down when the odds are firmly in their favor.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> There is also the matter of the suspicious tower we previously investigated. Holmes was entirely correct, it is some form of long-range artillery battery.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Geographically speaking, it is perfectly placed for such. However—</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> However?</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> I cannot help but feel that work on the tower has already concluded.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> ...!</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Perhaps there is a Servant who carries a cannon as their Noble Phantasm.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Or something even more threatening. I cannot imagine what.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> ...Either way, I believe all the Revenge Realm&#39;s stratagems center around underhanded tactics, and punishing mistakes.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> And it would seem that the mastermind behind all this is that Servant among them... Zhang Jiao.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> We mustn&#39;t strike at Queen Kriemhild. If we do so now, the Revenge Realm may undergo complete collapse.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> And if we do, the Restoration Realm is sure to make its move.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Undoubtedly.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Once again, this is merely an informed guess on my part.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> I may be entirely mistaken. However, we must make our move soon.</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> I understand. However—can we even mobilize the army in this situation?</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Yes. Our only chance at besting Zhang Jiao is to employ an elite squad to undertake an assassination.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Still, the Revenge Realm will surely be prepared against such attempts.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> So we will also deploy the army on a large scale. If they believe we will attack them–no, if we actually do so.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> The Revenge and Restoration realms will focus their attention to the resulting chaos, leaving us unchecked to perform the assassination.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Hence, our need for additional training.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> I will be occupied with that for about half of the day, but I can help plan the operation at night.</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> Very well. Then we shall take care of the planning.</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> Does that sound proper to you, Lord Vlad?</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Mm, if you would.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Would [♂ Mister /♀️ Miss] Fujimaru play a part in this mission?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I&#39;d imagine I&#39;m on the assassination team.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Indeed.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> It is dangerous role for the Master to play, but your ability to summon will be vital.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> You want me to go too?</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> ...Guess we don&#39;t have a choice. Your summoning abilities will definitely come in handy.</p><hr><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> I would like to take part in the assassination plot as well.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> I have some knowledge of both stealth and combat, and I&#39;m worried about potential moves from Moriarty.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> With him here... I cannot let Master go alone.</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> Then, we will choose an Assassin to undertake this mission.</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> Naturally, they will be a Pan-Human History Servant.</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> And Master Fujimaru can&#39;t fight while concealing [♂ his /♀️ her] power.</p><p><strong>Roland:</strong><br> I guess we&#39;re no good at that...</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Well, infiltrations were never our thing anyway.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> I&#39;ll stay behind as well. Honestly, I don&#39;t think I&#39;d be of much use.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> You still have time to make a decision. We need to prepare the army to carry out this operation.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> In the meantime, we need to work out the assassination plan. Let&#39;s have them call in the Assassin as soon as possible.</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> Right, right. Now then—</p><p><strong>Assassin Class:</strong><br> Assassin-class Servant. True Name: A secret. Greetings.</p><p><strong>Assassin Class:</strong><br> I was an assassin for a certain religious order. I shall gratefully accept this assignment.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Mm.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> First of all, you will be accompanied by two others on this task. Sherlock Holmes and Master.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> You have until the military exercises are complete to coordinate your individual roles.</p><p><strong>Assassin Class:</strong><br> Of course.</p><p><strong>Assassin Class:</strong><br> ...and with that said, it is a pleasure to work with you. Shall we get a drink together?</p><p><strong>Assassin Class:</strong><br> I&#39;ve heard that people in the modern age frequently bond over drinks.</p><p><strong>Assassin Class:</strong><br> Not that I partake myself.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Doesn&#39;t that ruin the concept?</p><hr><p><strong>Assassin Class:</strong><br> It sure does!</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Hmm. Well, let&#39;s hold off on that for now.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> We must first learn each other&#39;s capabilities.</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> I&#39;ll reserve a training space for you.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Very well then. Everyone, let us bring this rebellion against Pan-Human History to a close.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> —Prayer.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Simply, it is a pointless act.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> No matter how holy the people consider the act to be,</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I, Joan, wonder if I&#39;m not deceiving them.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I believe in God. I place my trust in Him.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> But what if my faith is just for show?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I have been haunted by the idea ever since I was summoned.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> It goes without saying, Pope Joan is but a fantasy.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> The debate over whether or not she was real spanned centuries.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> And I know this. I&#39;m fully aware.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I am an imaginary character, and all of my life, both the good and the bad,</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> couldn&#39;t possibly have been any more fictional. A plaything.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I believe I fell into despair every time I&#39;ve been summoned to a Holy Grail War.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> (Though there are no records of Pope Joan ever being summoned.)</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> This knowledge strips me of my duty...or even my right to pray to the Lord.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> Is that really how it is? I wouldn&#39;t be so sure.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> I hear the modern era rejects Mystery and fantasy. Even our days of adventure.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> Some even say myths and legends were created retroactively.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> But I—never doubted I am who I am.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> Charlemagne&#39;s glorious Paladins existed, and so did my love for Ruggiero.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> Even now, as a shadow cast by the Human Order instead of the real Bradamante,</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> I&#39;m still myself.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> The same should apply to you, Your Holiness.</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> ...Bradamante.</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> You and I are both shadows of the Human Order.</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> But you, on the other hand, have a solid sense of self.</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> There may perhaps be a reason for that.</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> Or, if you pardon my strange choice of words—</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> Most heroes, perhaps, see themselves as companions to their own Mystery and fantasies.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> ...?</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> But that&#39;s not the case for me.</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> I was created through imagination, yet refuted by knowledge.</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> My history, my very life, was torn down to shreds, and then—</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> “Now we know for sure. The woman known as Joan never actually existed.”</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> That is the verdict I was reduced to.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> It was the correct thing to do. Knowledge is the search for reality, for absolute truth.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Joan&#39;s existence should not be passed over as a mere fantasy.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> History changes dramatically depending on whether or not she exists.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Therefore, every piece of evidence needed to be thoroughly dissected and analyzed.</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> They were right. They were right. They were always right to do what they did.</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> ...Yes. I was simply quashed out willfully.</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> It was sad and painful, so much so that I felt like my chest was being torn open.</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> I wanted to grab these people by the collar, and shake them while I screamed out my frustrations.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> However, we don&#39;t approve it. That is the will of the Restoration Realm, including His Majesty the Emperor.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> ...“Grab them by the collar”?</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> ...It pains me to say it though, as I am dragging everybody else down into my sorrows.</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> Also, that was just a figure of speech. Don&#39;t worry about it.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> Lady Joan.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> I am a paladin, the embodiment of justice and righteousness. I fight for God and my country.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> If I ignored your anguish, Archbishop Turpin would never forgive me!</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> Putting aside the rebellion against Pan-Human History, I could never lose my respect for you!</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> ...I&#39;m grateful, Bradamante. I have no way to return this favor.</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> All I can do is pray that you will one day be reunited with the one you love...</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> My thoughts and prayers are with you.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> Thank you soooooooooooooo much!</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> Even so, I didn&#39;t know if it was all right for me to ask this.</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> Didn&#39;t you get into a fight with another Servant not too long ago?</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> —Yes. People still think I&#39;m a spy.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> I can say with pride that it was a misunderstanding, since I parted with them because of my beliefs.</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> ...I see.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> I knew it... You still don&#39;t trust me, do you?</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> —That&#39;s not it at all. I trust you completely.</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> I just... didn&#39;t want to force you to fight your comrades.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> Thank you for your consideration. However, I won&#39;t be needing it.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> I vow to fight them honorably. That&#39;s what one of the Twelve Paladins should do.</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> ...Thank you. And I apologize.</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> Please look past my shameful insult to your pride.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> N-no! No no no no no! It&#39;s totally okay to mistrust me!</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> I intend to follow both Your Holiness and His Majesty the Emperor, to the very end.</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> And if Constantine and I were to go our separate ways?</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> Y-you can&#39;t make me decide between you two!</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> That&#39;s like asking to choose between your mom or your dad!</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> Sorry, I was just kidding!</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> Come on!</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Now then, everyone. Let us concoct our plan.</p><p><strong>Assassin Class:</strong><br> Indeed. Careful planning is paramount for a successful assassination.</p><p><strong>Assassin Class:</strong><br> My honored predecessors all say as much.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> First, the goal is to assassinate the second-in-command Zhang Jiao. We have no other option but to remove him from this Singularity.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> The sheer intelligence he possesses, as Zhang Jiao, is a far more troubling weapon than his spells or Noble Phantasm.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> We considered incapacitating and capturing him via means of magecraft...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Ultimately, we must take away all chances he could have to put this intellect to good use.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> The logical conclusion is therefore to carry out his assassination.</p><p><strong>Assassin Class:</strong><br> So I see. Understood.</p><p><strong>Assassin Class:</strong><br> Because it&#39;s possible the objective will change as the situation in the field develops.</p><p><strong>Assassin Class:</strong><br> It is a fine thing indeed that we share that mutual understanding.</p><p><strong>Assassin Class:</strong><br> Good communication.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> For the plan at hand, there are three essential considerations. The how, the where, and the when.</p><p><strong>Assassin Class:</strong><br> The how... needless to say, an ambush by way of engaging in combat.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Precisely. Sniping carries a high risk of failure. If we had a highly skilled Archer, it would be a different matter—</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> No, it would still be difficult. The target is Zhang Jiao, leader of the Yellow Turban Bandits.</p><p><strong>Assassin Class:</strong><br> Depending on the tao arts in use, his protections may well be impregnable.</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> ...Oh, now I see. So that&#39;s why you called on me...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> I&#39;ve come to the conclusion that it&#39;s essential to be accompanied by a professional of the tao and sage arts.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> With permission from the Secretary.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> (She may be on the side of rebellion, but she can be restrained by Assassin should there be a need.)</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> (Though we ought to try our best to ensure that never happens...)</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> But naturally, I&#39;m sure I won&#39;t be going into the field with you...</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> I should say that I am not very quick to act, more of a... something, compared to other people...</p><p><strong>Assassin Class:</strong><br> Slowpoke?</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> Yes, that. Slowpoke! ...May I leave now?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Don&#39;t go sulking on us!</p><hr><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Hahaha.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Now that Miss Xu Fu is on board, we should discuss the location and date for executing the plan.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> First, let&#39;s discuss his patterns of behavior.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> According to the scouts who had tracked Zhang Jiao—</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Typically, Zhang Jiao is in the Revenge Realm&#39;s capital.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> On occasion, he moves to Fort Azagouc.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Kriemhild has entrusted him with full authority over the surrounding area–</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> There are times where he may lead expeditions into the Restoration Realm.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> He&#39;s an excellent sergeant to his troops. But not enough to compensate for the varying aptitudes of the individual soldiers under him.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> The results of their expeditions are usually defeat. Even so, they are always able to safely form a retreat.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Zhang Jiao has never been inflicted a personal injury thus far in the war of the realms.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> His abilities in direct combat seem low, but he compensates it with his superior adaptability.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Effectively, he could be considered another king. Assassination within the capital would be extremely ill-advised.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> There is no escape route, and a strong likelihood of failure should a last-ditch assassination attempt be carried out.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> There is also a strong potential for escape, should we attack him on the road to Fort Azagouc.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Conclusion: Recommend infiltration of fort and carry out assassination.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> But on the other hand, the probability of success for the assassination plan itself is low. Relying on a stroke of luck will surely lead to failure.</p><p><strong>Assassin Class:</strong><br> Hmm, how bothersome. The question is, how sound is the security system at the fort?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> There&#39;s no doubting it&#39;ll be solid. We should assume that all possibilities have been considered.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Miss Xu Fu, how would you defend this fort?</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> Do you know the fort&#39;s appearance and its location?</p><p><strong>Assassin Class:</strong><br> Well... Yes, here is the intel.</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> Hum-hum... Mm... Yeah, it&#39;s solid.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You can tell?</p><hr><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> I am less familiar with the Western arts, but I can pick up on Eastern arts intuitively.</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> I&#39;d be lost if, conversely, they were to have adopted from the Western arts that are outside of my field of expertise.</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> Now, this fort... was built according to the principles of what is known as the Qimen Dunjia.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Qimen Dunjia...?</p><hr><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> Hmm... To simplify it, astrology and studies of I Ching are used to determine the placements of various things.</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> Extending to people, armies, even castles. Ways to walk towards success, the directions towards failure, and so on.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> As I recall, this was utilized by Zhuge Liang during the Three Kingdoms period.</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> Yeah, the Stone Sentinel Maze, sometimes called the Unreturning Formation. I know all about that.</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> ...So, in summary...</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> This means that Fort Azagouc is stubbornly fortified by Zhang Jiao&#39;s tao arts.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> But from the opposite viewpoint, eastern or western–ancient or modern, fortresses are vulnerable to infiltration from within.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> As long as the protective tao arts can be cleared away, accomplishing the plan may be a simple matter.</p><p><strong>Assassin Class:</strong><br> Which is to say... everything will depend on this servant here.</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> ...Huh? On me?</p><p><strong>All:</strong></p><p>(Nodding yes)</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> ...Well, then I&#39;ll do it.</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> Now that I think about it, I&#39;m much older than you, regardless of what my appearance might suggest.</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> I have been a hardcore fangshi since the time of the First Qin Emperor.</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> Though I was occupied with a separate matter for quite some time, and matters of tao arts are somewhat fuzzy...</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll figure out something!</p><p><strong>Assassin Class:</strong><br> (Anxious.)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> (Anxious.)</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> Now look here, the operation will fall to pieces without me.</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> Show me all due respect.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Don&#39;t worry, we believe in Fu!</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> “Fu”? Where do you get off running your mouth like that, dipstick?</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> ... ...Oh, I get it. Funny.</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> Stick with “Lady Xu Fu”, though. Show some respect for your elders!</p><hr><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> What about the specifics? Is it necessary to observe the fort for countermeasures against the tao arts?</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> Um... there may be more countermeasures than we can possibly prepare for the current situation.</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> For instance, here is a talisman used in taoism. And here is another talisman used to negate it.</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> I&#39;m making all I can while I can, after which...</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> You will all need to thoroughly cram as much “Tao Arts for Dummies” into your heads as possible...</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> Yeah, there&#39;s lots to be done.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Very well. I see the road ahead.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Our first objective is to begin combat drills as a team. We have to have basic coordination as a bare minimum.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> We must also receive training on tao arts countermeasures, all while aiding Miss Xu Fu with Item Construction...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> The particulars of the plan will undergo continuous change until the day of the assassination.</p><p><strong>Assassin Class:</strong><br> That will be reasonable.</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> Then, we&#39;ll begin at once. Please bring some materials for crafting the talismans.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Hmm?</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> Um, the paper can be from Forbidden Pages... Ah, there was one more important thing.</p><p><strong>Assassin Class:</strong><br> Such as?</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> Let&#39;s fill those buckets with chicken blood. Finding bigger chickens is the most practical way to get more.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> I see what you&#39;re doing. You&#39;re going to use chicken blood to write the talismans.</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> Precisely.</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> To be completely honest, I can&#39;t tell how effective my talismans will be against Zhang Jiao&#39;s fortress,</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> but we have to make do with the hand we&#39;re dealt.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Agreed. Let us give everything we have to this mission.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> We&#39;re gonna get him good!</p><hr><p><strong>Assassin Class:</strong><br> Friendship, unity, and effort... The formula to the most beautiful victory...</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> (This Assassin is quite the poet...)</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> —A few days later.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I&#39;m sooo tired of reading...</p><hr><p><strong>Assassin Class:</strong><br> A-agreed...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Hahaha. This is nothing to me.</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> Well, I think that should suffice. You need time to digest what you&#39;ve learned, you know...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> We are laymen, after all. We should be only learning the parts we might need to put to practice.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> The team coordination drills are also beginning to bear fruit.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> And Lord Vlad claims the main army&#39;s drilling course is almost settled.</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> Meaning... our departure is soon.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Yes. The members to carry out the plan are us four Servants.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> [♂ Mr. /♀️ Miss] Fujimaru, I count on your simplified summons for combat support.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> That&#39;s right. [♂ He /♀️ She] should have enough firepower to put down Zhang Jiao.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> The more we invest into a project, the bigger its chances of being detected.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> This is as far as we can go without risking that.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> There seem to be no objections. Then, we shall carry out the operation.</p><p><strong>Assassin Class:</strong><br> May our unity prevail!</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> Why does our Assassin talk like a shounen manga protagonist...?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> We leave early in the morning. Say your farewells before then.</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> Hmm. Hmmmmmm.</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> What bothers you, sir? Does your grace&#39;s lumbar hurt?</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> It does. Massage me later. ...That wasn&#39;t it!</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> No...well... It&#39;s far too late to bring this up, but....</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> Have you considered... how it&#39;s dangerous for [♂ Señor /♀️ Señorita] Fujimaru to be going there?</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> I truly relate to your concerns, Don Quixote—</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> but our Master needs to stand close to the Servants [♂ he /♀️ she] summons.</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> It is actually possible for [♂ him /♀️ her] to stand back and offer support from behind,</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> but [♂ he /♀️ she] never follows this strategy! So all I can do here is share your grievances.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> I&#39;m technically a qualified Master, but I don&#39;t have permission to summon Servants.</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> Naturally.</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> We cannot grant the privilege of summoning to a one-time traitor to Pan-Human History.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Not that I&#39;m complaining.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> I&#39;d rather never be a Servant&#39;s partner again.</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> Back to the main subject. Regrettably, Don Quixote, truly regrettably...</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> we must send [♂ him /♀️ her] to assassinate Zhang Jiao.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I&#39;m going.</p><hr><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> Your worship,</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> I found Chaldea&#39;s account perfectly reasonable.</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> There is nothing for us to do. We will just pray for their success.</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> ...True...</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> [♂ Señor /♀️ Señorita] Fujimaru! Please come back alive!</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> For I, Don Quixote, intend to welcome you back with open arms!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Thank you. I&#39;ll definitely be back.</p><hr><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> Certainly!</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> Ah... Did I sound like a real knight there?</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> Yes, you were very knightly!</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> Then I guess I should go with them after all!</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> Absolutely not♪</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> Gh, I never stood a chance...</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> A throne is no place for a knight.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> It is no easy task, but bear with it.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> ...and my Master, it pains me not being able to accompany you.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> My value as a Servant has been lost ever since I was stripped of my combat abilities...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You&#39;re still fighting your own fight, aren&#39;t you?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> That makes you still my Servant.</p><hr><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> —Hmph. Most truthful words.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Entrust with me with the diversion. We shall put on quite the display.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Sherlock Holmes.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> I understand, Lord Vlad. I will see to the Master&#39;s safety.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Astolfo.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Yes?</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Escort the Master&#39;s party to the Revenge Realm.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Gotcha!</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> You heard the general. I&#39;ll be with you for a part of the way.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Roland&#39;s going with a separate unit.</p><p><strong>Roland:</strong><br> Sure thing.</p><p><strong>Roland:</strong><br> I&#39;d love to lend you my horn, but I&#39;m the only one who can blow it, so...</p><p><strong>Roland:</strong><br> Well, focus on surviving, and you should be fine!</p><p><strong>Roland:</strong><br> Hmm? Is that what you&#39;ve been doing all this time? Then I have no advice to give you!</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> I truly wish I could have thrown you a send-off party...</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> but his grace insists celebrations should be saved for after the mission.</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> Indeed.</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> After you return triumphant from your operation, we&#39;ll have joys to share.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> That&#39;s better.</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> I&#39;ll be preparing the feast.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> A party?</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> A party, indeed!</p><hr><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Oh, nice! I love parties! Really looking forward to that!</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> And I&#39;ll make it a gaudy one...lively and gaudy...</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> ... ...Tell me, Sancho.</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> Yes, your grace?</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> What makes a party gaudy?</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> Thinking about it, the only kind of party I know is the harvest festival.</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> What about the Duke&#39;s and Don Diego&#39;s fanciful invitations?</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> Sorry... The Duke and the Duchess are are far from ideal role models here...</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> At any rate, you mustn&#39;t worry. Leave the arrangements to your trusty Sancho. I will however be piling your worship full of chores.</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> Marvelous! I will have no idea what I am doing, so be patient with me!</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> I like your honesty.</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Morning, Fujimaru. You&#39;re up early.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Better to sleep a little longer.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I&#39;m going for a quick walk.</p><hr><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> You do you.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> (No one&#39;s up yet...)</p><hr><p><strong>Seton (?):</strong><br> Good morning there. How&#39;re you doing?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Oh, who might you be...?</p><p><strong>Seton (?):</strong><br> Oh, Chaldea&#39;s comms? Nice to meet you.</p><p><strong>Seton (?):</strong><br> I&#39;m Seton, Fujimaru&#39;s comrade-in-arms!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You&#39;re still going by that name...?</p><p><strong>Seton (?):</strong><br> Gotta commit to my assertions. I probably won&#39;t ever break out the True Name anyway.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Comrades-in-arms...</p><p><strong>Seton (?):</strong><br> Hahaha, guess not. That&#39;s just me embellishing the story. We never really fought together.</p><p><strong>Fujimaru :</strong><br> No, I wasn&#39;t disagreeing with the word choice.</p><p><strong>Seton (?):</strong><br> Oh, you don&#39;t mind? That&#39;s kind of embarrassing!</p><hr><p><strong>Seton (?):</strong><br> So, why are you out this early in the morning...? Actually, it&#39;s still closer to night than morning.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> My morning today will be really busy.</p><hr><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Can you confide in this Servant? Do you know if he&#39;s trustworthy?</p><p><strong>Seton (?):</strong><br> Don&#39;t worry. No one&#39;ll hear a word from me.</p><p><strong>Seton (?):</strong><br> Gossip is an uncool thing to do.</p><p><strong>Seton (?):</strong><br> It really sucks that I still can&#39;t help you in any way...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You could at least show your face already!</p><hr><p><strong>Seton (?):</strong><br> Hahahahaha. I&#39;ll keep the mystery man act for a little longer!</p><p><strong>Seton (?):</strong><br> You know how it is. Timing is everything.</p><p><strong>Seton (?):</strong><br> Yeah, I know how self-aggrandizing that sounds. Sorry about that.</p><p><strong>Seton (?):</strong><br> I&#39;m not asking you to believe me...</p><p><strong>Seton (?):</strong><br> but treat me like a lottery ticket. If you get lucky enough, you have a chance to win big with me.</p><p><strong>Seton (?):</strong><br> Welp, there&#39;s the sun. Good luck. I&#39;m rooting for you!</p><p><strong>Seton (?):</strong><br> Wish me luck too!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Hmm... Talk about your mystery men.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> He doesn&#39;t seem to be lying about being weak though. His Saint Graph&#39;s scale is as small as the average Phantom.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> But you know for sure he&#39;s a Servant, and not hostile... right?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Absolutely.</p><hr><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Okay. I trust your judgment on this one.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> But why is he not actively trying to help...?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> He did say he had a reason, so I guess we&#39;ll just leave him be for the time being.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> All right, get back to the castle. It&#39;s going to be a long day.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Right. Is everyone ready?</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> Yessir.</p><p><strong>Assassin Class:</strong><br> No problems.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Then let&#39;s take our leave. We will be infiltrating rather deeply into the Revenge Realm today.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Enemy encounters will be inevitable, but it is unnecessary for us to overcome them in battle.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Escape is always an option.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> I asked Miss Xu Fu to make us talismans for that purpose.</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> They have a limited number of uses, and they&#39;re risky to use against a Caster, but they&#39;re better than nothing...</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Yoo-hoo. Are you all ready?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Yes, no problem.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> As you know, I&#39;m here to run-run-run the golem chariot to the Realm&#39;s border!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Thanks in advance!</p><hr><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Alrighty then, let&#39;s be on our way!</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> Not to sound like a broken record, but remember... infiltrating from the cardinal direction is essential.</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> Qimen Dunjia is extremely complicated, but it follows a pre-established procedure.</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> It&#39;s a spell that doesn&#39;t depend on the fangshi&#39;s capabilities. In simpler terms, it works like a firearm.</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> Even the best gunman can&#39;t skip the process of loading the bullet, opening the safety lock, then pulling the trigger.</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> No step can be skipped, correct?</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> The same is true for this spell. It&#39;s complicated, but not invincible.</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> Here&#39;s a basic example: Imagine someone builds a castle secured against invaders from every direction.</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> This raises one question:</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> How can the people inside leave?</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> This means entry is possible. It&#39;s just that the entry method is extremely complex and convoluted by design.</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> But with enough effort, I can solve the puzzle. Though if I make any mistake...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Are you apologizing in advance?</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> I guess I am, but a simple apology wouldn&#39;t cut it in this case.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> We start over from the beginning.</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> There are no 1-ups in real life.</p><hr><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> Now, assuming we manage to get in, we shouldn&#39;t be facing many soldiers inside the fort.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Due to Qimen Dunjia, correct?</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> Exactly.</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> To make a long story short, on top of having to go through an excruciatingly finicky process to get in, their actions inside have a chance of disturbing the fort&#39;s directionality.</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> You can&#39;t station just any Servant there, nor do you want to. If possible, you don&#39;t want anyone there at all.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> But we have reasons to believe he holds forces in there today.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Zhang Jiao&#39;s spells must be employing some kind of being to act as a stand-in soldier.</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> Hmm, that makes sense. He could have familiars for that.</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> If that&#39;s the case, I guess he could limit its attack patterns not to interfere with the spell...</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> But that would shackle the familiars with severe restrictions... Things are looking good for us.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Thank you, Miss Xu Fu. Reviewing the content on the way to the field was truly helpful.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> We will be counting on your expertise there. You are essential to our plan.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> And another essential member in your midst is—</p><p><strong>Assassin Class:</strong><br> Ah, yes, me. The unnamed Assassin.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> We are working under the assumption that your Noble Phantasm is capable of defeating Zhang Jiao.</p><p><strong>Assassin Class:</strong><br> ...Certainly.</p><p><strong>Assassin Class:</strong><br> I failed to earn the title of Hassan-i-Sabbah, but my Noble Phantasm is not inferior to any of theirs.</p><p><strong>Assassin Class:</strong><br> In retrospect, this excessive pride of mine may have been the very reason why the Hassan-i-Sabbah name was beyond my reach.</p><p><strong>Assassin Class:</strong><br> Speaking of which, honorable Fujimaru, I hear word that you met with past bearers of the Hassan name.</p><p><strong>Assassin Class:</strong><br> What were they like?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> They were all very respectable.</p><hr><p><strong>Assassin Class:</strong><br> I see...</p><p><strong>Assassin Class:</strong><br> I feel a little ashamed and anguished to speak so highly of myself alongside such good company,</p><p><strong>Assassin Class:</strong><br> but you may trust in me to make this mission successful!</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Yeah, hello. Can I have a word?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> What is it?</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Uh...</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> A squad of ours got into a little quarrel with a Revenge Realm squad.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> An enemy encounter already... How do our forces fare?</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Hm, we sure aren&#39;t winning. They&#39;re pretty much ready to retreat.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Any ideas? Wanna steer clear, since you&#39;re on a stealth mission?</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> Oh, that definitely would be a good idea.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> [♂ Mr. /♀️ Miss] Fujimaru, any opinions?</p><div class="custom-container danger"><p class="custom-container-title">Flag</p><p>The following choices trigger different scenes in the current and next node, along with a different fight sequence.</p></div><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> We&#39;ll help them.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Cool beans!</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> I was getting really bored from just driving the chariot!</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Let&#39;s get things rolling!</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Hey there, my name is Astolfo, Paladin of the Via Regia Realm!</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> I lend my sword in the name of justice...

It&#39;s a pleasure to meet you!!</p><p><strong>Assassin Class:</strong><br> It&#39;s great to see someone respecting the importance of a courteous greeting.</p><p><strong>Fujimaru:</strong><br> Kinda weird to start fighting right after, though!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> We&#39;ll avoid them.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Okay.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Yeah, our squad isn&#39;t doing too bad over there. Ok.

It comprises some 60 Heroic Spirit-grade and 4,940 Phantom-grade Servants.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> And yet it is still inferior to the Revenge and Restoration Realms.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Yet even so, there is a certain level of beauty in well-trained Servants being commanded together as a single whole.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Gentlemen. Today, the Via Regia Realm enters the arena of wide-area combat.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> As you have been informed, this battle is the culmination of your training.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Meaning that you may consider it a large-scale exercise. Having said that—a heedless performance will be considered treasonous.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Not just towards me, but against the great king we all revere—Karl der Große.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> This battle is not a show for those of the Revenge Realm.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> But for the sake of Karl der Große.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> —He may not be here.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> But, naturally... He is watching over you, with scrying magecraft, very carefully. Each and every one of you!</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> So throw yourselves in without shame! For the Emperor! For we are the righteous Via Regia!</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Revenge and Restoration are of no consequence! Show your power to the fullest extent!</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> Dear God, please... please... keep everyone safe...!</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> Hmm. It may be safer not to watch. It looks like your heart will beat itself inside-out if you do...</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> I will be watching in your stead, so please continue your prayers, sir.</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> Rassin-frassin...</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> Whew. As I thought, being Karl der Große is a heavy burden on us.</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> Everything we&#39;ve done to survive has brought us closer to death...</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> Funny how things are...</p><p><strong>Assassin Class:</strong><br> D-dispatch! The Via Regia Realm of Karl der Große is on the move!</p><p><strong>Assassin Class:</strong><br> Their target is Fort Worms, in our Realm!</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> So they have come. What of their numbers?</p><p><strong>Assassin Class:</strong><br> 5,000 at best.</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> I see.</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> Not worth meeting them with our whole army.</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> ...Still, this is the first move the Via Regia Realm has made. The defense stationed in the Restoration Realm is at a minimum.</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> I&#39;ll go as well. Contact Zhang Jiao immediately.</p><p><strong>Caster Class:</strong><br> M-my sincerest apologies!</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> ...?</p><p><strong>Caster Class:</strong><br> We can&#39;t find him anywhere!</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> ...Did something happen?</p><p><strong>Assassin Class:</strong><br> What are your orders?</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> ...Intercept them. Send ten thousand for now. That should be more than enough.</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> Royal Guards. Assemble the troops immediately!</p><p><strong>Royal Guard:</strong><br> By your command!</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> He&#39;s either playing hooky, betrayed us, or perhaps even dead.</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> In any case, he couldn&#39;t have chosen a worse time. Damned old man—</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>The queen sighs in frustration.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> —Let&#39;s turn back the clock a bit.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Fort Azagouc.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> That is the fort where Zhang Jiao and one hundred of his subordinate Servants have secluded themselves.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> It may not seem like many, but it is ample for a fort where the direction of every movement, including patrol, is pre-established.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> In addition, a large number of Zhang Jiao&#39;s own weapons are incorporated into the security system.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> And of course, it is deep inside his own territory.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Both the Restoration and Via Regia are aware of this fort&#39;s location, but they don&#39;t bother sending their own troops here.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> However, Zhang Jiao is not secluded in here on a whim.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> He has two reasons to be here.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> One is “surveillance”.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> The Revenge Realm avoids this fortress. Consequently, Zhang Jiao must periodically come to inspect it. It&#39;s a requirement to keep his peace of mind.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> And at the same time, he verifies that the patrolling Servants haven&#39;t figured out the fort&#39;s forbidden secret.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> If someone were unlucky enough to find out, he would have no choice but to eliminate the complication.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> The other reason is “preparation.” Zhang Jiao never neglects his preparations for the rebellion.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Not just against Pan-Human History.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Naturally, it is a rebellion against Kriemhild, queen of the Revenge Realm.</p><p><strong>Zhang Jiao:</strong><br> I don&#39;t know how much longer that woman can keep it together.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>Zhang Jiao fears for her mental stability.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Kriemhild used every means at her disposal to avenge her beloved husband, Siegfried.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> She even dedicated her body to Alteraat the time, known as Attila.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Both her hatred and her eye for strategy are extraordinary.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Zhang Jiao understands this all too well. Yet there remains one simple fact.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> She is a Berserker.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> No matter how composed she may seem, the fact does not change that she is a monster consumed by the flames of vengeance.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> —Therefore, rebelling against her is an inevitable necessity. Preferably by making as much use of her talents as possible until she breaks.</p><p><strong>Zhang Jiao:</strong><br> I wonder how she&#39;ll react?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> He was asking because he still didn&#39;t know if the card he held was an ace or a joker.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> If played well, it would be a blade to Kriemhild&#39;s throat. If played wrong, it would doom both himself and the Revenge Realm.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> As such, Zhang Jiao can&#39;t entrust the adjustments to any subordinate. He must work on the project alone.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> As a man who once built an army of hundreds of thousands of believers, he had many stratagems, prospects, and wishes.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> —Nonetheless, it was to all be for naught, as he was unlucky enough to be in the wrong fort on the wrong day.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> The elder held two secrets, but made two miscalculations.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> One was failing to recognize the enemy had an excellent fangshi, though not as skilled as himself.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> And the second, which would prove fatal,</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> was failing to anticipate that the world&#39;s greatest detective would appear before him that day.</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> Here&#39;s my Quimen Dunjia plate. Actually, it was made with Zhang Jiao in mind, so it&#39;s rather rudimentary.</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> All it really needed to do was tell us which direction to move in, so I didn&#39;t bother with anything else...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Very well, Miss Xu Fu. Where do we start?</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> Bamen. Eight doors to the imaginary planets: rest, birth, injury, grove, scenery, death, surprise, and opening.</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> We must face birth, scenery, and opening. We must avoid the remaining five.</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> ...Let&#39;s start with the birth door.</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> This way. As stealthy as possible.</p><p><strong>M：Assassin Class:</strong><br> Everyone please follow me, then.</p><p><strong>M：Assassin Class:</strong><br> If you do as practiced, then you may be able to slightly capitalize on my Presence Concealment.</p><p><strong>M：Assassin Class:</strong><br> Not to a great extent, as I am but one of many Assassins, not a Hassan who stands out from the rest.</p><p><strong>M：Assassin Class:</strong><br> But it&#39;s better than nothing, you might say.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> This should be sufficient. Let us be off.</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> (—Something&#39;s wrong.)</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> ...!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> (What is it?)</p><hr><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> (Oh no, this way leads through the door of death! Everyone, don&#39;t move!)</p><p><strong>All:</strong><br> !</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> (Zhang Jiao... you&#39;ve made further improvements to the Qimon Dunjia!)</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> (We have to think like he does going forward. One mistake will send us right through the door of death...!)</p><p><strong>M：Assassin Class:</strong><br> (...!)</p><p><strong>M：Assassin Class:</strong><br> (The enemy. Three of them. Your orders?)</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> (I&#39;d have preferred to avoid this, but—)</p><p><strong>M：Assassin Class:</strong><br> (How troublesome. Which way, Lady Xu Fu?)</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> (From here, we have to go either forwards or to the right.)</p><p><strong>M：Assassin Class:</strong><br> (So avoiding them is impossible.)</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> (Do we have the time to soundproof the area?)</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> (With my newer and even more improved Jokou Zekka Talisman, we should be able to erase all signs of a struggle.)</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> (But we need to finish them quickly, and without using any Noble Phantasms. The talisman doesn&#39;t last forever.)</p><p><strong>M：Assassin Class:</strong><br> (You have my thanks. Now, to kill them.)</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> (On my mark. 3, 2, 1...)</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> (...now!)</p><p><strong>Lancer Class:</strong><br> !?</p><p><strong>Saber Class:</strong><br> (Ambush! We&#39;ve been... what!?)</p><p><strong>Rider Class:</strong><br> (No, my voice... no sound...!)</p><p><strong>M：Assassin Class:</strong><br> (Now I take your lives!)</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Assassin Class:</strong><br> (I&#39;ve got them. Seems our cover is still intact, too. Let&#39;s keep going.)</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> (We&#39;ll head down to the basement from here. If Holmes&#39; deduction holds true...)</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> (Yes, that&#39;s where Zhang Jiao is.)</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> (I am not familiar with the intricacies of the tao arts, but I have gained a fair understanding of the process thanks to you.)</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> (If I know the procedure, I can see where it leads, and thus reach a conclusion.)</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> (Near the safest place in this fortress—)</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> (That&#39;s where he&#39;ll be.)</p><p><strong>Zhang Jiao:</strong><br> ... ...Mm.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> A pleasure to make your acquaintance, Lord Zhang Jiao.</p><p><strong>Zhang Jiao:</strong><br> Well, well. Sherlock Holmes, is it?</p><p><strong>Zhang Jiao:</strong><br> To think you would slip through the cage of my Taoist spell...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> No, no, I could not have done it alone. The secrets of a foreign country are beyond my ability to deduce.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> But, with the assistance of someone familiar in the tao arts... I can draw a conclusion so long as I understand the procedure.</p><p><strong>Zhang Jiao:</strong><br> I see. And you are... the Master who fled.</p><p><strong>Zhang Jiao:</strong><br> To think you would come back. How commendable.</p><p><strong>Zhang Jiao:</strong><br> Here to avenge Salome?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Zhang Jiao:</strong><br> Hoho. Don&#39;t go glaring at me.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I&#39;m not going to fall for that bait.</p><p><strong>Zhang Jiao:</strong><br> You may as well have lost yourself to fury the moment you had to control your emotions at all.</p><p><strong>Zhang Jiao:</strong><br> At times like this, it is important to remain calm.</p><hr><p><strong>Zhang Jiao:</strong><br> Now then, did you think you would get away unscathed from your little stroll in my interior?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Indeed, we do.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Because you have no means of calling your allies.</p><p><strong>Zhang Jiao:</strong><br> ...What?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> On the contrary, it would be quite a problem for you should your allies come rushing over. There is something rather important here in this fortress.</p><p><strong>Zhang Jiao:</strong><br> —</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> We, of course, have called our ally. She will surely remove every trace of sound from this fortress.</p><p><strong>Zhang Jiao:</strong><br> Kakakakaka. Should I call this terrifying, or perhaps praise it as mercy?</p><p><strong>Zhang Jiao:</strong><br> Indeed, I cannot call upon my allies heedlessly. Which is why I must now paralyze them all.</p><p><strong>Zhang Jiao:</strong><br> But—did your deductions account for the existence of this?</p><p><strong>Zhang Jiao:</strong><br> Come on out!</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> ...Hmm.</p><p><strong>Zhang Jiao:</strong><br> Yellow Turban puppet soldiers. Quite fashionable, are they not? Were these in your deductions?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Hahaha. No, they were not.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> However, I did deduce that you would have either an accomplice or loyal minions.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> This, too, was part of my calculations. Now, en garde.</p><p><strong>Zhang Jiao:</strong><br> —Hah.</p><p><strong>Zhang Jiao:</strong><br> My luck remains ever hale and hearty. I&#39;m not decrepit enough to be killed by the likes of you.</p><p><strong>Zhang Jiao:</strong><br> Here comes the Great Teacher, Zhang Jiao!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Zhang Jiao:</strong><br> —That was nothing. This isn&#39;t over yet!</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> (His combat performance exceeds expectations! He might even be comparable to a Top Servant...!)</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> (Does he possess the Holy Grail? No, that doesn&#39;t add up.)</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> (Heroic Spirit Zhang Jiao. There is something that sets him apart from the others—)</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> I see. Now I understand.</p><p><strong>Zhang Jiao:</strong><br> Hah, and what is it that you&#39;ve “understood”?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> —</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> (I couldn&#39;t catch what he just said...)</p><hr><p><strong>Assassin Class:</strong><br> You&#39;re wide open!</p><p><strong>Zhang Jiao:</strong><br> Oh.</p><p><strong>Zhang Jiao:</strong><br> Oooh, oh. Oh. Oooooooooh!</p><p><strong>Zhang Jiao:</strong><br> This cannot be! So that&#39;s what this is about!</p><p><strong>Zhang Jiao:</strong><br> Curse you...curse you, curse you, curse you! I have blundered, I have blundered, what a blunder...!</p><p><strong>Zhang Jiao:</strong><br> You, how did you figure it out!?</p><p><strong>Zhang Jiao:</strong><br> How were you able to solve it...!?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> That&#39;s—Hmm.</p><p><strong>Zhang Jiao:</strong><br> Kukakakaka! A clown! A clown, am I?</p><p><strong>Zhang Jiao:</strong><br> My luck has yet to run out!? Of course not!!</p><p><strong>Zhang Jiao:</strong><br> I never had any to begin with!</p><p><strong>Zhang Jiao:</strong><br> Aaaaa. Fading, I&#39;m fading away... So it was... never possible...in the first place...</p><p><strong>Zhang Jiao:</strong><br> I was...wrong...after all...? My...Master...?</p><p><strong>Assassin Class:</strong><br> Disappearance of hostile Servant, confirmed. It didn&#39;t seem like my Noble Phantasm was very effective.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Holmes, what did you say to Zhang Jiao?</p><hr><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> It is but a trifling matter. Or so it should be...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> But perhaps it might just be... his undoing.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> And that is?</p><hr><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Oh, that is—</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> The question of whether or not you are truly you.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> But in this case... our efforts were a little...</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> ...!

It&#39;s time for the spectacle of Fort Azagouc&#39;s obliteration.</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> That old man seems to have arranged for the fort to collapse should he die prematurely.</p><p><strong>Zhang Jiao:</strong><br> A self-destructing system is what all men dream of!</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Then, we shall make a swift escape.</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> Ah, yes. So we&#39;ll have to head from the birth door to the scenery door—</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> That isn&#39;t necessary. As I am now, I can deduce succinctly.</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> Wow, detectives sure are amazing.</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> ...Wait a sec. Doesn&#39;t that mean I&#39;m no longer needed?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Hahaha. We can speak later. Let&#39;s go!</p><p><strong>Saber Class:</strong><br> W-What the hell is going—!?</p><p><strong>Archer Class:</strong><br> I don&#39;t know! We have to get out of here...!</p><p><strong>Saber Class:</strong><br> Whoa, stop! That&#39;s a forbidden direction!</p><p><strong>Archer Class:</strong><br> Uh... Huh... Aaaahhhhh!</p><p><strong>Saber Class:</strong><br> Shit! Where should I go...!</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Excuse me!</p><p><strong>Saber Class:</strong><br> Ahhh!</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> If we go straight through here, we should be able to leave from the scenery door.</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> Fujimaru, what do you think?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Holmes knows what he&#39;s doing.</p><hr><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> Ugh!</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> Why don&#39;t you just get a Holmes of every class and settle everything with them?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Your mind goes to terrifying places.</p><hr><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> I may be outstanding, but certainly not omnipotent. Of course, I do have the aptitude to be a Caster.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> For now though, I&#39;m fine with being a Ruler.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Phew, we made it out safely.</p><p><strong>Assassin Class:</strong><br> To be honest, I was prepared to die but... that was way too easy.</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> Oof, that sounded like a death flag. If you&#39;re not careful, heads are gonna start flying.</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> Your head, of course.</p><p><strong>Assassin Class:</strong><br> Lady Xu Fu, could you please stop saying such scary things without warning!</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> The golem carriage still seems to be properly concealed. There is no sign that it was discovered.</p><p><strong>Assassin Class:</strong><br> No enemy in sight. Let&#39;s get going.</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> There are none, huh...</p><p><strong>Assassin Class:</strong><br> You sound disappointed, Lady Xu Fu. Really...?</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> No transmission yet?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> It would be better to wait until we are nearing the border of the Via Regia Realm first.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> It will take time for word of the fall of Fort Azagouc to spread,</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> as well as the confirmation of Zhang Jiao&#39;s elimination.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> They will also need time to organise troops to pursue us after our deeds are exposed.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> ...Hm.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> We musn&#39;t rest easy yet, but I doubt they could catch up to us, no matter how fast they are.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> As long as we remain wary of the patrols, we should be able to get away.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> That&#39;s a relief...</p><hr><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> —All is well. He has no premonition of danger, making no premonitions nor deductions.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> The red sky gradually fades into blue.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> They will soon arrive in the Via Regia Realm, their mission complete.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Even in this tranquil scene, Holmes is pondering deeply.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> ... ...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>Pondering what, you ask? Well of course, that would be me, who refuses to show myself.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> (Lord Vlad would... originally be on his side if things had gone according to his schemes.)</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> (That was done in order to reduce Chaldea&#39;s battle strength. So far, it makes sense.)</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> (But... why hasn&#39;t he shown himself? Even now, he has still not launched an attack.)</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> (Apostle of the Alien World... Does that role even exist?)</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> (If so, just where in the singularity is...? No, what is...?)</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> His thoughts go around in circles, the truth shrouded in a cloud of uncertainty.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> —But Sherlock Holmes doesn&#39;t know.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Even for one who should know everything, there is one thing that he doesn&#39;t know.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> ...To an extent,</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> this Singularity is no different to a Lostbelt. History is woven by people.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> The passage of time in which intelligent beings do not exist is not perceivable by anyone.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> If a worm were to crawl around here for one or two years,</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> it could be said that no time has passed. This singularity is the exact opposite.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Servants are the embodiment of the progress of human history.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> In this Singularity, heroes and anti-heroes from many worlds, countries, and races continue to be summoned.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Essentially, the paths taken by humans permeate throughout the background.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> As such, the phrase “rebellion against Pan-Human History” has great meaning.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> The elimination of this Singularity requires leaps in reasoning rather than a buildup of deductions.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> And the Holmes who continues to ruminate about me will not be able to reach that answer.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> I am convinced of that. As he is now—it is impossible.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Our goal is achievable.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> ...To put Sherlock Holmes to rest, as an Apostle of the Alien World.</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Oh, our timing is impeccable. Vlad III seems to have returned as well.</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> Hmm, did things work out as well as they appear to have?</p><p><strong>Roland:</strong><br> They sure did!</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> Gyah!</p><p><strong>Roland:</strong><br> ...Isn&#39;t it dangerous to hit people with flowerpots?</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> It&#39;s fine, you&#39;re invincible. So, what happened?</p><p><strong>Roland:</strong><br> Well, you know, it was our first proper battle.</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> And the outcome?</p><p><strong>Roland:</strong><br> A greater success than we expected. Lord Vlad&#39;s commands were followed by the troops without hesitation.</p><p><strong>Roland:</strong><br> Formations, directions, deployments. Everything went perfectly.</p><p><strong>Roland:</strong><br> Yeah, I think—we&#39;ve fully conveyed the fearsomeness of the Via Regia Realm.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> I see. That&#39;s good to hear.</p><p><strong>Roland:</strong><br> The plan to assassinate Zhang Jiao—sure, I can tell from the look on that guy&#39;s face.</p><p><strong>Roland:</strong><br> Nice work.</p><p><strong>Assassin Class:</strong><br> Things went smoothly. A triumph for teamwork.</p><p><strong>Roland:</strong><br> Now, I suppose we&#39;ll close out our missions with a final report to His Majesty.</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> What a pain... Can&#39;t we skip on the report submission? No?</p><p><strong>Assassin Class:</strong><br> What remarkable negligence. As for me, I am simply wracked with stress.</p><p><strong>Roland:</strong><br> Hey, he&#39;s just a good-natured old man. Don&#39;t sweat it!</p><p><strong>Assassin Class:</strong><br> What nonsense.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> —And with that, our report concludes.</p><p><strong>D：Secretary:</strong><br> Thank you all for your hard work. You will receive rewards from His Majesty.</p><p><strong>E：Karl der Große (?):</strong><br> Your efforts are appreciated. I&#39;m truly glad... you all made it back alive...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Thank you for your kind words.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> We are honored to have made a contribution as subordinates to His Majesty, Karl der Große.</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> Phew, my shoulders are stiff...</p><p><strong>Assassin Class:</strong><br> My thanks for the reward.</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> What did you get?</p><p><strong>Assassin Class:</strong><br> Some thaumaturgical items for strengthening my Saint Graph, and a support Mystic Code.</p><p><strong>Assassin Class:</strong><br> You want as many of these as you can get your hands on.</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> Humm...</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> My talismans are on the kingdom&#39;s bill, so I think I&#39;ll take some materials to strengthen my Saint Graph for myself.</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> What about Holmes and Fujimaru?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Hahaha, we seem to be in the same situation.</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> Be sure to tell the Secretary if you haven&#39;t received anything.</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> Keeping quiet won&#39;t do you any good!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> G-Got it.</p><hr><p><strong>Assassin Class:</strong><br> Now, I&#39;ll stand by here.</p><p><strong>Assassin Class:</strong><br> I will need more training, so my coordination doesn&#39;t fall behind within the Assassin squad.</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> I&#39;m gonna take a break in my spirit form too. Have fun, then.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Yes, likewise.</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> Are the two of you free?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Oh, Miss Sancho. How can we be of service?</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> Do you recall the matter of throwing a party upon your safe return?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Of course I do. Oh, by the looks of things—</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> Yes. We are ready to receive you.</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> I would appreciate if you made some time to return to the throne room.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Of course. And yourself, Master?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I&#39;m in!</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> Thank you very much. His grace will be elated.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> The other two...</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> I owe apologies to the other pair who worked on the mission...</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> But as his worship may well expose his identity, I must keep it a secret.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> No matter, we will be on our way to the apparent wrap party.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Miss Sancho, would there be an issue if we left halfway through?</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> Not at all.</p><hr><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> Then let&#39;s raise our glasses. Go ahead!</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Cheers!</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Our first battle went reasonably well... but no matter.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> The boost in morale from a banquet should not be underestimated.</p><p><strong>Roland:</strong><br> Man, I wish Astolfo could&#39;ve seen my heroic figure in action!</p><p><strong>Roland:</strong><br> The way I performed my duty while totally blending in with the rank-and-file!</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> R-Right. So you think... that counts as active participation...?</p><p><strong>Roland:</strong><br> Sure does!</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> We were able to monitor using scrying magecraft.</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> It was quite the sight to behold.</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> The formation was so orderly that I couldn&#39;t even tell where Master Roland was.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Despite their higher standard of skill, they took care to avoid unilateral or rash actions.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Nonetheless, it was both pleasing and troubling that everything was in order.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> How so?</p><hr><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> One of the objectives of the large-scale military exercise this time was to measure responses to sudden incidents.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> When everything goes too well, arrogance is bound to set in.</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> That is true.</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> It may be a good idea to work on those by way of strategic maneuvers where failure is the expected outcome.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Hmm. Then we shall form a plan for that at once.</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> Everyone, please eat and drink your fill. Ah, what a happy occasion!</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> Sir, please don&#39;t get overexcited.</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> True.</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> “There is nothing more dangerous than a mage carried away by their high spirits.”</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> I&#39;ve been sternly rebuked about that by Toole IV.</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> Even the nobleman from Chaldea has a woman for him like Sancho is for me!?</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> Mm. An indomitable spirit that&#39;s never merely occasionally strict!</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> We&#39;re like two peas in a pod!</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> Well, now. When you put it that way, your grace, I do see how things stand.</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> ...No, Sancho, I don&#39;t mean it that way.</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> Then what do you mean?</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> (A figure of a man realising his mistake and leaving before he makes things worse)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> This is Mash Kyrielight, substituting for Director Gordolf.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Thank you for your hard work, Senpai.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Sure thing.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> And to Kadoc as well...</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> No, I didn&#39;t do anything this time.

And yet...</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> I have no idea what the hell causes that to happen.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> We&#39;ve conducted a great deal of research on our end, but haven&#39;t found out any more than you.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> If you dragged it out of me... like Holmes is fond of saying,</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> the only thing for certain is that the Master that is utilizing the Command Spells is just one person.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Okay... Damn it, we&#39;ve got to be missing something.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Suppose that Moriarty was the Master?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That may be possible...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Suppose a Servant were the Master?</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Sure, it wouldn&#39;t be impossible for a Servant to become a Master themselves...</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> But even then, the scale here is way too huge.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> There&#39;s no one in all the world who could be a Master to a collective of 10,000 Servants.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> There&#39;s no... one...</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ... ...</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Well, all that aside for the moment.

That&#39;s totally possible.</p><p><strong>Roland:</strong><br> He was a real adventurer, His Majesty–hold on, calling him His Majesty all the time is getting annoying.</p><p><strong>Roland:</strong><br> I&#39;ll just call him Chuck.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Heh heh heh heh.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Don&#39;t you think that you had best refrain from referring to your king in so familiar a fashion?</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> I take no umbrage, but I am sure there are some rascals about who as a result will show attitude towards His Majesty.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> ...Although, that aside, you speak as one of his confidantes.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Fine, go ahead. Let us keep the conversation overly informal.</p><p><strong>Roland:</strong><br> W-Well, okay.</p><p><strong>Roland:</strong><br> So, Fujimaru. Let&#39;s talk about Chuck.</p><p><strong>Roland:</strong><br> Simply put, he was an adventurer. The type who rushes away, never to return.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> I guess we were all born with a measure of that.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Adventure over politics!</p><p><strong>Roland:</strong><br> Chuck isn&#39;t the type of king who&#39;s made for a throne.</p><p><strong>Roland:</strong><br> He&#39;s a guy who&#39;d gladly agree and hit the road if Don Quixote wanted to play the part.</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> Hold on.</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> If Karl der Große were really here, couldn&#39;t I quit being king!?</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Settle down, it&#39;s just a hypothetical.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> The two of you, you both...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> ...love Charlemagne, don&#39;t you?</p><hr><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Well, duh!</p><p><strong>Roland:</strong><br> Pretty much!</p><p><strong>Roland:</strong><br> I went through a lot of hard times, but I never once regretted being his retainer!</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> So I see.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> He was a great emperor who in his lifetime bowed before no one...</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> But I would like to meet him at least once.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I&#39;d like to meet him.</p><hr><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Yeah, true.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> I think you&#39;d hit it off really well with that king!</p><div class="custom-container warning"><p class="custom-container-title">Branch</p><p>The branch from the two separate scenes end here.</p></div><div class="custom-container danger"><p class="custom-container-title">Flag</p><p>The following choices each lead to vastly different scenes.

Even if by fumbling your way.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Now, what brings you here?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> (Can&#39;t speak... Is it because this is a dream?)</p><hr><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Hmph. So you arrived ahead of your ability to speak?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Those sorts of things can happen. Or perhaps this was a desire of mine brought to life in the dream state.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> So, let me do the talking, then. You can listen to me with that bitter expression on your face.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Frankly speaking, I detest you.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> You Chaldeans are a cancerous existence. Have you ever considered that?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> While they may have been Lostbelts, you have six times corrected and six times destroyed the world.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Oh, but I know! It was the only way for you all to survive.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> That&#39;s what you wish to say, isn&#39;t it? And yet—</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Such righteousness resting upon your shoulders, or on those of Mash Kyrielight&#39;s...</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Do those malignant ways weigh so lightly?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> You all understand well, for certain. But understanding alone cannot sustain the spirit.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> If you can endure a moment&#39;s fury, can you also handle the sorrow that permeates in its wake?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> I don&#39;t think you have that quality. Therefore, I will not suffer you to stand in my way.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> ...But we needn&#39;t take things any further. Besides, you will forget all about this dream.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> It makes no great difference whether or not we remember our dreams.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> This conversation is meaningless. No one can overturn fate.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> No one. So, disappear at once and delay me no further.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> I&#39;ll be putting an end to the Realm you&#39;re inhabiting, and him along with it.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I was having such a strange dream...</p><hr><div class="custom-container warning"><p class="custom-container-title">Branch</p><p>This scene plays if player has selected &quot;I should visit Xu Fu and Assassin...&quot;</p></div><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> Master Fujimaru, are you going to rest now?</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> Oh...not yet?</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> ...I see.</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> In that case, I shall designate a meeting place for you all to easily gather.</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> Take some drinks and snacks with you.

Those would be...luxury goods.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Exactly. Alcohol, for certain, but also snacks and fruit.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Not to mention, tobacco.</p><p><strong>Assassin Class:</strong><br> Oh...even a hookah? I could go for that. I don&#39;t imbibe, so I will be content with tea.</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> I&#39;ll take the liquor♪</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Well, everyone. You have done well. Even Karl der Große was particularly pleased.</p><p><strong>Both:</strong><br> Ooh...</p><p><strong>Assassin Class:</strong><br> Well, it doesn&#39;t quite feel that way.</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> True.</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> ... ...</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> About Zhang Jiao, you&#39;re sure he&#39;s dead?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Yes, I confirmed that as well.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> He disappeared utterly. Except—</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> Except what?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> It is possible that Zhang Jiao will be resurrected, or that another of him may exist.</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> What?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> “Are you really you?” This question threw Zhang Jiao into confusion.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> In other words—for whatever reason, his self-awareness has become remarkably vague.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> I judged as such on the grounds of him being an imposter. That&#39;s why I posed the question.</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> Well, I thought his strength was genuine.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Yes, he was abnormally strong. Enough for me to harbor hints of discomfort.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Only... He could not be the only fake Zhang Jiao with strength that abnormal.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> In that aspect, he&#39;s remarkably similar to the Yellow Turban puppet soldiers he controls.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Well, yes. I suppose it&#39;s only a theory?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> (It doesn&#39;t seem far-fetched...)</p><hr><p><strong>Assassin Class:</strong><br> And yet, it doesn&#39;t matter whether he was destroyed. If need be, we can always assassinate him again.</p><p><strong>Assassin Class:</strong><br> It&#39;s merely a matter of bonding as a team.</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> You and your bonds.</p><p><strong>Assassin Class:</strong><br> That is what it means to fight together. Phoo...</p><p><strong>Assassin Class:</strong><br> I am enjoying this hookah. It&#39;s great to no longer have health as a concern.</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> True, we&#39;re Servants.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> If hypothetically, a human were here,</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> what would happen then?</p><hr><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> ... ...</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> Hwha? What do you mean?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Would you maybe... tear them to shreds?</p><hr><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> ...I see, I see. So you suppose we&#39;d proceed to tear their limbs off?</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong></p><h1 id="the-hell-i-would" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#the-hell-i-would" aria-hidden="true">#</a> The hell I would!!</h1><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> What, did you encounter some kind of barbaric Servant like that someplace you were summoned to? Or am I the unlucky one?</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> What? Fairies?</p><p><strong>Assassin Class:</strong><br> Fairies... really?</p><p><strong>Assassin Class:</strong><br> I&#39;ve heard rumors about them, but zero idea of what they are like.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> The fairies were not dangerous in and of themselves. Rather, they were extreme imitations of humanity.</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> Well, be that as it may, I wouldn&#39;t discuss the matter too loudly.</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> There are stranger things at play than having humans in the picture.</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> Disregarding all that, isn&#39;t our greatest and fundamental priority the rivalry with the other two realms?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Incidentally, our circumstance is that we drifted naturally towards the Via Regia Realm.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> What are your opinions on the Revenge and Restoration Realms?</p><p><strong>Assassin Class:</strong><br> Nations to be defeated, aren&#39;t they? Many of my comrades have died.</p><p><strong>Assassin Class:</strong><br> Of course, the same is true for the other realms. And so we share no compromise.</p><p><strong>Assassin Class:</strong><br> To surrender and lose all, or to see it all destroyed.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> I see. So it is not a matter of malice, but of duty?</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> That&#39;s how it seems. I don&#39;t feel it quite the same way.</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> Not that I&#39;m compatible with Revenge or Restoration. Revenge comes off more ugly, if anything.</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> Restoration is, well...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> What would you do about Restoration?</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> That man, Constantine. You know, the greatest Servant there.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Yes, that&#39;s right. Constantine XI.</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> I find him creepy.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Oh, do you?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Where Constantine XI is concerned, he is neither tyrannical nor fatuous.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> His powers as a Servant are uncertain, but he would have the Holy Grail&#39;s backup as king of his realm.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Then why the disgust?</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> Hmm, how to put it best?</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> While I don&#39;t advocate rampant corruption or warmongering states...</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> I personally don&#39;t favor his spotless integrity.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> I understand.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> The Restoration Realm must hold to their integrity and righteousness to stay true to their purpose.</p><p><strong>Assassin Class:</strong><br> What purpose do you mean?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> He seeks to carry out retribution upon Pan-Human History. That is, to restore a woman whose existence was forbidden.</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> What woman...?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Pope Joan.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> I believe Constantine&#39;s purpose in rebelling against Pan-Human History is to make her presence known.</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> Pope, Joan...</p><p><strong>Assassin Class:</strong><br> Hrm. It seems like a hole in my endowed knowledge...</p><p><strong>Assassin Class:</strong><br> Who is she, exactly?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Once believed to have existed, a female pope who was later declared otherwise.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> It is truly an uncommon occurrence.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> To begin with, Heroic Spirits are things that contain Mystery. I am no exception.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> When inscribing an existence into Pan-Human History, how much of it is the past&#39;s reality and how much is fantasy?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Some Heroic Spirits are purely born out of stories. Such as Nursery Rhyme, for instance.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Some Heroic Spirits have their stories and sources overlap into reality. Such as myself or Mister Jekyll, for instance.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> It is said that things such as myths and legends are at times crafted retroactively.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Of course, there are many cases—where the reality that took place on the texture of the Age of Gods was mythic.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> The existence of the Twelve Olympian Gods, for example, is a case in point.</p><p><strong>Assassin Class:</strong><br> What, did they really exist?</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> This detective knows it all...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> In any case...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Reality and fantasy haven&#39;t much meaning among Heroic Spirits.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> —And yet,</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> this is categorically untrue for Joan.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Being a pope meant that her existence was thoroughly scrutinized.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> And history came to deny it.</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> ...Well, that&#39;s unfortunate.</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> But why does Constantine wish for her to be restored?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Well, therein lies the whydunit.</p><p><strong>Assassin Class:</strong><br> ...Perhaps it is a matter of the bond between a man and a woman.</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> Ew, get boned.</p><p><strong>Assassin Class:</strong><br> I very much suspect that is his intention.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Not bad!</p><p><strong>Assassin Class:</strong><br> This is training for my improv skills.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Uh, right...</p><p><strong>Assassin Class:</strong><br> I should hope my comrade-in-arms can provide a little more vibrancy in [♂ his /♀️ her] comebacks.</p><hr><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> In any event, it is not something to be overly concerned about. We simply need to oppose them.</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> But it doesn&#39;t look like we&#39;ll be fighting Restoration for a while.</p><p><strong>Assassin Class:</strong><br> Indeed. For the time being, the strategy will be to cut pieces from the Revenge territory.</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> Look, we can save that for another time. Let&#39;s drink!</p><p><strong>Assassin Class:</strong><br> Certainly! No, wait, I do not imbibe.</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> Okay, I&#39;m gonna break out the taoist mystery medicine.

Come forth, Zhang Jiao.</p><p><strong>Zhang Jiao:</strong><br> Ah... Did I die?</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> Apparently you did. How pitiful.</p><p><strong>Assassin Class:</strong><br> Th-This is...!</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> A spell to create an alter ego, or perhaps the work of his Noble Phantasm. Either way, I couldn&#39;t care less.</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> Zhang Jiao is here. That&#39;s all that matters, isn&#39;t it?</p><p><strong>Assassin Class:</strong><br> ...Yes, my queen!</p><p><strong>Zhang Jiao:</strong><br> So... what was I up to?</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> It seems the only drawback is that your memories don&#39;t carry over.</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> This is what you left behind, addressed to yourself.</p><p><strong>Zhang Jiao:</strong><br> Well, well. I see, I see. ...this battle was lost rather miserably.</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> It was. Not that it changes anything.</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> Though, I suppose I do resent being looked down upon.</p><p><strong>Zhang Jiao:</strong><br> Shall we proceed, then?</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> We shall. Our actions will match those of the Restoration Realm.</p><p><strong>Zhang Jiao:</strong><br> ...Hm? May I ask what your intentions are?</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> The Restoration Realm is poised to assault the Via Regia Realm. That much is clear from their military formation.</p><p><strong>Zhang Jiao:</strong><br> But not us?</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> Yes. Constantine appears to understand.</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> That virtue will never trump vice unless one is willing to take a gamble.</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> Joan.</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> Yes?</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> I do not doubt your words. But, I would still like to confirm this once more.</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> Is this deduction indisputably true, or is there room for doubt?</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> It&#39;s the latter.</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> I had a “revelation”, and I presented it to you.</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> I cannot explain where it came from, nor the logic behind it... Thus, I cannot rule out the possibility of it being false.</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> But you did hear it, didn&#39;t you?</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> Yes. It said, “Wage war against the Via Regia Realm and victory shall be yours.”</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> I leave it to you to either trust this message or denounce it as nonsense.</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> ...Bradamante.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> Yes, Your Lordship.</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> What do you make of Joan&#39;s “revelation”? Do you believe we can triumph against Karl der Große?</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> —Yes, we can.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> The Karl der Große who rules the Via Regia Realm is an impostor...</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> Or his powers are being blocked for some reason or another.</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> And what do you base this on?</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> The fact that he did not show up in that military operation. His Majesty isn&#39;t that cautious.</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> Is that so?</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> From my perspective, that level of caution goes without saying.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> That may be so, provided that he was summoned to rule a country.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> But if he is summoned to partake in a Holy Grail War, my king would not act in such an insipid manner.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> He is the kind of person who stands on the front lines, no matter the situation.</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> But... Karl der Große is accompanied by those two. Roland and Astolfo of the Twelve Paladins.</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> We consider this Karl der Große to be the real thing by their presence.</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> Would the Twelve Paladins truly revere a false lord?</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> It&#39;s the other way around.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> That is precisely why those two would do so.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> We paladins strive to embody chivalry. And what&#39;s more,</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> we would bear any dishonor, should we believe our cause to be just.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> ...And if I may add, should the real Karl der Große be present,</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> and someone else were posing as him, so long as the emperor considers their actions chivalrous,</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> he would simply permit them to continue with a laugh. That&#39;s the kind of person he is.</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> ...I see.</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> (Only one factor remains.)</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> (Moriarty&#39;s information. Chaldea is hiding in the Via Regia Realm.)</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> (The Revenge Realm should be incapable of mobilizing their troops.)</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> (...Let&#39;s settle this, Via Regia Realm.)</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> Assemble the commanders, Bradamante. We will immediately move to wage a decisive battle against the Via Regia Realm.</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> ...!</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> Don&#39;t be surprised. This is undoubtedly a gamble.</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> But we must strike while the iron is hot, and wage war on the Via Regia Realm.</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> The Revenge Realm has lost Zhang Jiao, and the Via Regia Realm have sustained their own losses in battle.</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> If we are to fight, then it&#39;s now or never. Before the Via Regia Realm gains further momentum—</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> We will crush them. Is this fine, Joan?</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> Then I have a request.</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> —Please take me with you.</p><p><strong>Both:</strong><br> !!</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> Your Holiness, that&#39;s...!</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> No, it would do no good for me to just sit back and pray here.</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> If this is to be a gamble, then let us put everything we have on the line.</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> I... don&#39;t want to just wait placidly here for the outcome.</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> It&#39;s fine. I&#39;m a Servant too.</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> ...Fine. But please stick to logistical support.</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> Of course I will.</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> I am aware that it would be a nuisance for me to fight on the front lines.</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> That&#39;ll do. I will be on the front lines, and you will be at the rear.</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> This will be the first major battle since these realms were first established... let us achieve victory.</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> Yes!</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> Then let us begin the assembly!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> The world is on the verge of an upheaval.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> On this day, the Restoration Realm awoke from their slumber, adamant on breaking the lengthy stalemate.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Even if the enemy realms were made aware, halting the march would be a fool&#39;s errand.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> And Constantine XI made an additional move.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> A ploy to lure Karl der Große, fake or not, out onto the battlefield.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> The plan is simple, and it is this simplicity that makes it unstoppable.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> —A few days after the Zhang Jiao assassination mission.</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> ... ...</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> ... ...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Sorry to call you here in such a rush, but there&#39;s been an abrupt development.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> What&#39;s going on...?</p><hr><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> Please take a look at this.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Is this—a direct challenge?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> ... ...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> I see, what a bold move they&#39;ve made. An official declaration of war and a request for an audience with Karl der Große.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> I take it that he intends to meet you on the battlefield?</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> Yes.</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> This declaration was brought to me after several skirmishes with the Restoration Realm.</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> It goes without saying that the Via Regia Realm Servants are also aware of this declaration.</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> ...So, in other words, we can&#39;t weasel our way out. We have to head for the battlefield.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Is that a certainty?</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> For an individual of Karl der Große&#39;s stature, keeping his honor intact would outweigh logical thought.</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> This is a path no hero can avoid.</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> I would like your opinion on this, Lord Vlad.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> We cannot go against this declaration. Our next confrontation with the Restoration Realm will be total war.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Nonetheless, we must abandon this naturally defensible area.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> After all, even the battlefield itself has been named.</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> Let&#39;s negotiate and see if we can somehow get ourselves a more advantageous battlefield.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> I agree.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Even if gaining the home field will prove difficult, we do not want to pit our numbers against theirs on an open plain.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> In any case, what a well-written declaration. It proclaims the passion and ruthlessness of its author.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> It bruises the pride of those under the command of Karl der Große, appropriate for dragging us out into battle.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Speaking of which, rumors have been going around for a while now that Karl der Große might be an impostor.</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> We are aware of it too. I have instructed the Assassins to quell them.</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> But rumors spread like wildfire, as is their nature. Especially if they&#39;re not completely unfounded.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> It is the Restoration Realm.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Their plan appears to be waging total war against us, appearances be damned.</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> Umm, so... will I be on the front lines?</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> We will, of course, have to hide your figure.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Whoever lays eyes upon you will understand in a moment that you are not an emperor, but a knight.</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> We plan on covering the pavilion with a tent, similar to the throne.</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> I believe that showing up on the front lines while taking precautions against assassination attempts is our best option.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Yes, that will do. The problem is who to put there.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Why not just Don Quixote?</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> What are your thoughts on this matter, Don Quixote?</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> I... I probably shouldn&#39;t be there.</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> My voice trembles at the mere thought of standing on the battlefield, and that&#39;d make my behavior mighty suspicious.</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> It&#39;s no use even if I have Sancho by my side.</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> I... cannot fight a war.</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> Your grace...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> In which case, we will need someone else to fill in for him.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> It will be hard for Astolfo, Roland, or I to do this.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> I am already known as the commander of this army. Needless to say, the same applies to Astolfo and Roland too.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> (Raise hand)</p><p><strong>Roland:</strong><br> Yes!? Will you do it!?</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Are you sure?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> I&#39;d like to say... that this is something I cannot let you do.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Truth be told, you are the closest we have to a Karl der Große, Fujimaru.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> What about Holmes...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> ...Hmm. It is true that my face is not widely known.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> If I disguise myself using a Noble Phantasm, I should be able to deceive them.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> But there is a need to demonstrate my power as Karl der Große. I am uncertain whether or not I can pull that deception off with my own Noble Phantasm.</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> That means—</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> [♂ Mister /♀️ Miss] Fujimaru. I know this is sudden, but why don&#39;t you try your hand at being Karl der Große?</p><p><strong>Fujimaru:</strong><br> Here comes the unreasonable request!</p><hr><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> No way...</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Fujimaru as Karl der Große? Isn&#39;t that going to be difficult?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Anyone would find it difficult to do. Not to mention dangerous.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Because there are sure to be Servants targeting Karl der Große.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> However, [♂ he /♀️ she] has the power to fight off Servants.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Summoning...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Our Master can summon Servants to fight with in the blink of an eye.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> The power to lead and command a plethora of heroes. [♂ He /♀️ She] also has a track record of conquering numerous Singularities and Lostbelts.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Even if [♂ he /♀️ she] is caught off guard, there is a good chance that [♂ he /♀️ she] will be able to handle things.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> ...Well, I guess it&#39;s true that [♂ he /♀️ she] can manage somehow by summoning compatible Servants...?</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> I should be the one protecting you, but I have an army to command, and I am also weakened at this present time.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> You shall be as Karl der Große, protected by thousands of Servants...</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> The risk is not negligible, but it may turn out in our favor after all.</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> What happens if Fujimaru can&#39;t do it?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> In that case, I would be the only candidate. I do have a Noble Phantasm for disguises on hand.</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> But if it comes to that...</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> Won&#39;t Fujimaru be by your side?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Yes, you&#39;re exactly right.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> I am now a Servant of Chaldea, and as such, I can hardly afford to operate without my Master.</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> ...So you&#39;re saying that doing it or not makes little difference?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Indeed.</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> Haven&#39;t we just gone full circle?</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> In that case, we&#39;d be better off having the Master act as Karl der Große!</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> You&#39;ll be able to prioritize [♂ his /♀️ her] protection better than you would if [♂ he /♀️ she] were just a tagalong!</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> —Well, we would actually like to recommend a second option.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> What would that be?</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> ...We flee. How does that sound?</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Flee? Run away?</p><p><strong>Roland:</strong><br> Hahaha, that&#39;s a funny joke, Sancho. ...Eh, huh, you&#39;re not joking?</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> At the very least, Chaldea would be well advised to flee.</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> To flee, eh? That may be an option...</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> What? No!</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> You&#39;re not the one calling the shots here.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> That may be an option, but it would not remedy our current situation. In fact, it would only aim to worsen it.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> This large-scale Singularity cannot be allowed to engrave itself in human history.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> It is a threat comparable to those seven Singularities and six Lostbelts.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Or the exceptional Heian Singularity and Tunguska.</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> If only we could talk things out with the enemy and come to an understanding...</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> All right. Now, Master.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> You shall now assume the guise of Karl der Große.</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> I&#39;ll have your regal attire ready in no time. And his worship will be a Royal Guard.</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> Whoa, I&#39;m moving up in life!</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> Isn&#39;t it the opposite!?</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> You&#39;ll be able to change your voice. It&#39;ll be fine as long as your body language matches that of Karl der Große behind the veil.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> I shall immediately begin devising countermeasures against the Restoration Realm. You shall be joining me, Roland.</p><p><strong>Roland:</strong><br> Yes, sir.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Astolfo and Don Quixote shall both remain by my Master&#39;s side.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> But you may join the battlefield on your Hippogriff, should the need arise.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> As a so-called commando unit.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Roger that! I&#39;ll do my best!</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Now all that remains are battlefield negotiations. Sancho, Holmes.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> I shall leave that to you.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> The location designated by the Restoration Realm within their borders is an open plain...</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> We must avoid this location at all costs.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Yes. I believe we can avoid it.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Mm?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> They&#39;re using a classic bargaining technique, the door-in-the-face.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> “Door in the face”? What the hell does that mean?</p><p><strong>Roland:</strong><br> You don&#39;t even know that, Astolfo?</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> I dooooon&#39;t! Do you, Roland?</p><p><strong>Roland:</strong><br> Yeah, of course! ...Which is why I must ask you to explain, Holmes.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Hey, the truth is that you just don&#39;t know, do you?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Hahaha.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> It is a negotiation technique where you first put forth a request that&#39;s likely to be shot down, then follow it up with your original request that now seems much more reasonable in comparison.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> It&#39;s a basic skill in negotiation.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> The same as that sales tactic where you start at an absurd asking price, and then reduce the price to your real asking price, where it now appears to be a bargain.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Oh, I see! So that&#39;s why I&#39;m always getting ripped off!</p><p><strong>Roland:</strong><br> That happens to you often?</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> I mean, I feel bad about haggling.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Their true intention is likely—</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> A plain in the vicinity of the Restoration-Via Regia border. One that&#39;s “advantageous to us and slightly disadvantageous to the enemy”.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> It is likely the Ani Plains, a location that meets these criteria.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> ...Hmm.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> I would certainly choose this site to be our battlefield if I were with the Restoration Realm.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> We too ended up concluding that this location is better for us than the completely disadvantageous one the Restoration Realm first suggested.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Is this what they are after? Should we scorn them for their sagacity or praise their full efforts?</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> We will find a good point of compromise that lands us at a more advantageous battlefield.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> I shall choose a few locations, and make my own visits as necessary.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> All right, let&#39;s do this!</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> ... ...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> The world is on the verge of an upheaval.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> The Via Regia Realm and Chaldea are tossed about by the great waves of history.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> A Singularity that was once far too small for the world is now a cradle that would shake history itself.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> A hero praised for nobility, an anti-hero who was called a monster.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> A hero who slaughtered a hundred, an anti-hero who defended a thousand.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> None of that makes a difference. They simply slaughter one another.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> In a sense, this may be the Singularity that equalized the world.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> For its raison d&#39;être is rebellion against Pan-Human History, irrespective of nation or race.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> While averting their eyes from the pointlessness of it all—or perhaps while facing it.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> These men and women, heroes of yore, continue their bloody fight.</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> ...Unbelievable. Don&#39;t tell me you are serving as an envoy?</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Hmph. I have lost my power as a Servant, after all.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> This role befits me, last Roman Emperor.</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> I wonder about that...</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> According to our own intelligence, you were the one responsible for bolstering the strength of the Via Regia&#39;s army.</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> If we take you captive here, all that would be undone...</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> A severe blow, wouldn&#39;t you say?</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> How impudent of you, Emperor. Or are you merely trying to provoke a response from me?</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Had I feared such things, I would have never come here in the first place.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Their training is long since complete. Whoever succeeds me as their leader will be just as effective.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Harming me will bring dishonor to the Restoration Realm as well.</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> Do you think I am putting on airs?</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Such an attitude will only take you so far. In the end, your own principles must allow for my safe return.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> ...Although, we would be having a very different conversation if the Revenge Realm did not exist.</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> —You speak the truth.</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> It is time we bring this farce to a close. Now...</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> Our battlefield shall not be the fields of Ani, where our Realms border.</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> It shall instead be at Sirmium, you say?</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Of course. You have already received our dispatch, have you not?</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Do not say you haven&#39;t read it. Feigning ignorance is a waste of time.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> When I accepted your invitation, the negotiations had already concluded.</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> ...You have a gift for words, Son of Dracul. Or perhaps these words are not your own?</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> The latter, as it happens.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> I am not incapable of negotiation, but it is good to rely on others more suited to it.</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> ... ...Hmph.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> —Constantine ponders thus.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> The other party intends to fight at Sirmium.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> This came as a surprise to the tactician Servants of the Restoration Realm.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> It was understood that fighting on the Ani plains was something the Via Regia would want to avoid.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> And it was assumed that the Via Regia would prefer to fight in their home territory, fortified by their own natural defenses.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Constantine and his allies were prepared to grant such an concession.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> If Karl der Große was willing to hide himself away, then the theory that he was an imposter would be all the more believable.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> They thought they could win through a combination of Servant morale, competency, and strategy.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> That was the situation as analyzed by Constantine and his men.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> However, the newly designated battlefield was within the Restoration Realm&#39;s lands.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Of course, it is not a place where superior numbers alone can ensure victory.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Sirmium had been abandoned due to its location on the border between Realms.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> The various Bounded Fields and buildings erected by Casters were long degraded and worthless.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Constantine had dispatched scouts as soon as the city was proposed as the battlefield.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> —But, they were already too late.</p><p><strong>Assassin Class:</strong><br> What...!?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> This supposedly abandoned city had been transformed into a mighty fortress.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Improvised construction through a Caster&#39;s magecraft, or perhaps simple manual labor by Servants and golems.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> It is not impossible for Servants to construct a castle in a single night.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Constantine began to wonder, and ordered checks on other former cities along the border—</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> The results were astonishing.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> There were indications of fortifications in the ruined cities, and a terrifying number of spies stationed in forts along the border.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Constantine had desired his decisive battle to be within Via Regia territory.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Such a challenge would keep his Servant&#39;s morale high,</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> while further strengthening the rumor that Karl der Große is a sham.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> This would ultimately lead to the Restoration Realm&#39;s victory.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Or so Constantine thought.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Of course, if it really was Karl der Große, all their strategies would be meaningless.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Consequently, the true nature of Karl der Große&#39;s authenticity was kept secret to all but a few of his inner circle.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Either way, Constantine had no choice but to accept the other party&#39;s demands.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> The Via Regia Realm chose to fight inside the Restoration Realm.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Even though the castle had already been completed, and their defenses were flawless—</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> The Via Regia Realm had bravely challenged the Restoration Realm to battle inside their own territory.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> If rumors spread that Karl der Große was invading them, the Restoration&#39;s morale would naturally plummet.</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> Is it the Via Regia&#39;s way to play games with their strategies...?</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Then you call us cowards?</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> Of course not.</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> Excellent. Then, we shall meet your army at Sirmium.</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> We shall defeat you in fair combat.</p><p><strong>Rider Class:</strong><br> Your Lordship.</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> Dispatch a messenger to the border. Be proper about it.</p><p><strong>Rider Class:</strong><br> Yes, Your Lordship. Dispatching a runner.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> You have my thanks, O Mighty Emperor.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> It is an honor to make war against someone from my own era.</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> This battle goes beyond honor. When we next meet, I shall show no mercy.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> How marvelous. My thoughts were the same.</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> —By the way, how is Karl der Große&#39;s health?</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Hmph.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> I imagine that even now, he struggles to choose his armor.</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> ...?</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Let us meet each other on the battlefield, O Mighty Emperor.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> ...Phew.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Sure was reckless coming here without a Servant...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Um... why go to Fort Azagouc, Kadoc?</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Since it&#39;s in ruins now, I probably won&#39;t run into any trouble here.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Kriemhild and the rest of her army are probably preoccupied with the battle between the Restoration and Via Regia, too.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> To be honest, we&#39;ve had way too many close calls up till now.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I want to ask you—</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> There&#39;s still something in here.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...!</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Holmes would probably say the same thing.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> The feng shui of that fortress wasn&#39;t just to keep Zhang Jiao safe...</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Zhang Jiao said this was to protect something. I want to know what that is.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Gordolf knows about this too, so that&#39;s why he&#39;s letting me act on my own.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Still, going by yourself—</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> I&#39;ll be all right.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...?</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Somehow. I don&#39;t know how exactly, but I&#39;m not alone.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> I&#39;ll just go in, look around, and come back. No issues.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Just please don&#39;t forget to check in.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Yeah. I&#39;d hate for you all to activate my collar and kill me.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That won&#39;t happen. I&#39;m only worried about you.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> ... ...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> What is it?</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> —It&#39;s nothing. You just sounded like an actual person there.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...What do you mean?</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Your emotions are clearer to me. I don&#39;t know, maybe you were always this way.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Or maybe you changed after meeting Fujimaru. [♂ He /♀️ She]&#39;s awfully carefree, after all.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That&#39;s true. We&#39;ve been through a lot together.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I think I still have room to grow as a person, as well.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> ... Meanwhile, I haven&#39;t changed one bit.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Not when I was assigned to the A Team, and not when I turned against Pan-Human History.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> I was just afraid of death and wanted to survive. So I fought against the Master who saved the world.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Betrayal after betrayal. My life is just a mess.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Kadoc. I know what you&#39;ve gone through.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I won&#39;t say it couldn&#39;t have gone any other way. But—</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Huh? Oh, don&#39;t listen to me. It&#39;s just self-loathing.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Self-loathing?</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Yeah. I&#39;m not going to kill myself or accept death or anything. Didn&#39;t I promise you?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> —</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Now... half a day to the fort, huh? How&#39;s the war going?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Well...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It appears that we have settled on the location for the battlefield.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Then... all that&#39;s left is to fight, I guess.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes. Oh, and... hehe.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Hm?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Well...actually...about Master...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> What...the...?</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> What is this, you ask?</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> Servants have labored all night to create the “Emperor&#39;s Glorious Garment”.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> It&#39;s so...gaudy.</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> Of course. It is for Karl der Große, after all...</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> The concept was: “Gorgeous, Golden, and Glorious.” Or “G and G and G,” for short.</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> By the way, the use of so many G-words was a complete coincidence. There is no deeper meaning.</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> There isn&#39;t?</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> No, not at all.</p><hr><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Wahahahahahahahah!!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You&#39;re a knight in service to Karl der Große...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> ...and it puts you in stitches...</p><hr><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> Don&#39;t worry. The aura of gaudiness really ties it all together.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Yeah, no worries at all! This will... probably work out!</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> ...good thing I&#39;m a Royal Guardsman...</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> His grace must have his own splendid armor as well.</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> Seriously...? Isn&#39;t this a little much for a hedge knight like me?</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> You are a knight of the Royal Guards, your grace. Therefore, you must look the part.</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> Now, get dressed.</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> Mngh...if I have to.</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> Tah-daaaaah~!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Gorgeous!</p><hr><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Golden!</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> Wahahaha, you think so? I sure look the part of a Royal Guard in this getup!</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> You two are quite a sight together.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Hmm. But won&#39;t they stick out like a sore thumb on the battlefield?</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> It&#39;s fine. We will keep them both guarded indoors.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Guess we have no choice!</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Oh-ho. It suits the two of them, does it not?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Y-You think so...?</p><hr><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> Then I&#39;ll come out and say it. You look absolutely ridiculous.</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> Oh, I disagree.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> I think it&#39;s funny!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Funny, huh...</p><hr><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Now then, being able to choose our battlefield is one of the few advantages we have.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Still, we&#39;re really up a creek without a paddle here!</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Quite so. I deeply regret the loss of my powers even more now.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> But lamenting what is gone does not help our cause. Instead, I shall do what I can.</p><p><strong>Roland:</strong><br> Lord Vlad, the troops are all in formation.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Mm.</p><p><strong>Roland:</strong><br> Oh, it&#39;s Karl der Große. &#39;Sup?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> It is I, Karl der Große, your emperor!</p><hr><p><strong>Roland:</strong><br> If you can crack a joke in this situation, then I got nothing to worry about.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Master, take off that costume for now.</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> What is it?</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> This city will be the site of our decisive battle.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Would it not be a good idea to get the lay of the land while we still can?</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Roland, escort [♂ him /♀️ her] around. It will be too conspicuous if I go.</p><p><strong>Roland:</strong><br> Roger that!</p><p><strong>Roland:</strong><br> All right, Master [♂ guy /♀️ girl]! Let&#39;s get to work!</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Saber Class:</strong><br> Caster! We need a Bounded Field around this armory!</p><p><strong>Caster Class:</strong><br> Roger! Constructing a Pentafold Composite Bounded Field!</p><p><strong>Archer Class:</strong><br> We&#39;re low on explosive quarrels for reinforcement! When are we getting them?</p><p><strong>Assassin Class:</strong><br> A message from the manufacturer team representative, as follows: “Piss off, we&#39;re giving our all here. Shit doesn&#39;t get done overnight!”</p><p><strong>Archer Class:</strong><br> What was that? I&#39;m gonna kill your ass.</p><p><strong>Assassin Class:</strong><br> Don&#39;t shoot the messenger!</p><p><strong>Berserker Class:</strong><br> Nwoooooooh!</p><p><strong>Saber Class:</strong><br> Hah, great arms, Berserker. Put that log by the front gate.</p><p><strong>Rider Class:</strong><br> Make way! Lancer, your supplies are here!</p><p><strong>Lancer Class:</strong><br> Move out, boys! Make sure every corner of this building has eyes on it!</p><p><strong>Rider Class:</strong><br> Things are looking good! Next delivery! Woohoo!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Our guys are all fired up...</p><hr><p><strong>Roland:</strong><br> As they should be. We&#39;re almost at the final battle.</p><p><strong>B：???:</strong><br> Oh. Fujimaru?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I know that voice...</p><hr><p><strong>Seton (?):</strong><br> Heya, it&#39;s Seton.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Wait, what&#39;s Roland doing?</p><hr><p><strong>Seton (?):</strong><br> He&#39;s gone over there.</p><p><strong>Seton (?):</strong><br> Anyways...</p><p><strong>Seton (?):</strong><br> I came to this town, not knowing what was going on.</p><p><strong>Seton (?):</strong><br> I can smell the final battle coming.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Yeah.</p><hr><p><strong>Seton (?):</strong><br> You&#39;re fighting Constantine first? I couldn&#39;t dream of him ever going on the offensive.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You know him?</p><hr><p><strong>Seton (?):</strong><br> No way. Only by his reputation.</p><p><strong>Seton (?):</strong><br> Constantine, last Emperor of the Byzantine Empire. Also called the Eastern Roman Empire.</p><p><strong>Seton (?):</strong><br> The man who defended Constantinople until it was a hopeless cause.</p><p><strong>Seton (?):</strong><br> And now, an emperor rebelling against the Human Order.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...Can we win?</p><hr><p><strong>Seton (?):</strong><br> Hmmm... I wonder.</p><p><strong>Seton (?):</strong><br> To be honest with you, I think the Restoration Realm has a 4:6 advantage... no, more like 3:7.</p><p><strong>Seton (?):</strong><br> But, well, things are in motion. It&#39;s too late to back out now.</p><p><strong>Seton (?):</strong><br> Remember, going back on your decisions is the worst thing you can do on a battlefield.</p><p><strong>Seton (?):</strong><br> If you see a pitfall before you, the best thing to do is jump over it, right?</p><p><strong>Seton (?):</strong><br> Though, yeah, sometimes the pitfall is too wide for that.</p><p><strong>Seton (?):</strong><br> Anyway, I&#39;m still useless as ever. My bad.</p><p><strong>Seton (?):</strong><br> You&#39;re okay with that?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I&#39;m just glad you&#39;re here.</p><hr><p><strong>Seton (?):</strong><br> ...Cool. Then laying low to survive was worth it.</p><p><strong>Seton (?):</strong><br> Oh, before I forget, tell Lord Vlad and Sherlock Holmes something.</p><p><strong>Seton (?):</strong><br> I surmise that the Restoration Realm is going all-out. Like, “Pope Joan will be among the ranks”-level all out.</p><p><strong>Seton (?):</strong><br> Her presence will have a huge effect on their morale.</p><p><strong>Seton (?):</strong><br> Tell them to be wary of that.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Gotcha!</p><hr><p><strong>Seton (?):</strong><br> That&#39;s all from me. See you later, comrade-in-arms!</p><p><strong>Roland:</strong><br> Uh... was that a friend of yours?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> The self-proclaimed Seton.</p><p><strong>Roland:</strong><br> “Seton”?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> My fellow prisoner in the Revenge Realm.</p><p><strong>Roland:</strong><br> Oh, at the Revenge Realm...</p><hr><p><strong>Roland:</strong><br> Uh, listen. I&#39;ve got nothing to substantiate it,</p><p><strong>Roland:</strong><br> but my gut is telling me you&#39;re better off far away from him. It&#39;s complicated...</p><p><strong>Roland:</strong><br> Let&#39;s leave it at that. Wanna look around some more?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Welcome back, Master. Did something happen?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Xu Fu was crying.</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> I wrote talismans.</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> I wrote and wrote and wrote and wrote and wrote and wrote and wrote and wrote and wrote and wrote and wrote and wrote and the pile would never end...!</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Hahaha, that is understandable. And how is the town?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I saw so many weapons...</p><hr><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> Seeing it from above, it was already more fortress than town.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> As it should be.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> We have assembled a fair number of weapons, large enough to be effective against Servants.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> I am not that knowledgeable about military affairs—especially about siege warfare.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> But even still, I can tell that our fortress is exceedingly solid.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> But that&#39;s assuming we&#39;re fighting only Phantom-grades or Heroic Spirit-grades with no Noble Phantasms.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Kind of an extreme example, but I could brute-force my way through the fortress&#39; defenses.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> The difference of strength between warriors is astounding on both sides.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> The enemy army has approximately 8,000 Servants, with 100 of them being Heroic Spirit-grade.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Ours has only 5,500, Heroic Spirit-grades included.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Is the town well-defended enough to overturn this numerical disadvantage?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Or are they strong enough to overturn our Servants&#39; defences?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> That is one thing reasoning can&#39;t deduce. That said, praying is far from the only thing we can do.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Whatchu mean?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> We can learn, Mister Astolfo.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Who is our opponent? What steps is he willing to take? And what is his plan of action?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Having 8,000 bodies is great on paper, but they are an army with a unified will.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Therefore, I shall deduce their motives and their movements.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Oh, you&#39;re sounding mighty reliable there!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Right. One other thing, Holmes.</p><hr><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> ...?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Hm... Joan is on her way?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Putting together her pain, her principles and ideals, and the importance of this battle,</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> it was inevitable that she would eventually intervene with the army directly.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Why would Joan do this...?</p><hr><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Out of responsibility, most likely.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> She is not a rebel to the Human Order. Their Master did not instill rebelliousness into her.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> She is simply an ordinary Pan-Human Servant.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> What...!?</p><hr><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> ... ...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> —How sinful...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Death is tragic and dreadful. Life is noble and beautiful.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> And killing is the greatest sin of all.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> But can I even be a sinner?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I&#39;m a fictional character. Dreams, delusions, hopes, and despairs given shape.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> If a character hurts or kills a person, is it culpable for the crime?</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> —Of course I am.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> There&#39;s no way this isn&#39;t a sin. Still,</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> even then, my life has faded from the texture of reality.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> All my feelings and experiences are untrue.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> ...Trampled feelings. Fruitless experiences.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I might be taking my frustrations out on the wrong people,</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> but I couldn&#39;t find any effective way to appease my maddening rage.</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> Joan.</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> I am here... Let us depart to the battlefield.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Holding the hand offered to me, I set out to the battlefield.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> All sins and evils committed in this conflict are mine alone. I&#39;m sure that one day I&#39;ll burn in the flames of judgment. With all that in mind,</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I am about to cause a war.</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Repooorrrting!</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> The Servant army of Constantine, the Restoration Realm, is 8,000 in total!</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Composed of 3,000 in the vanguard, 3,000 in the middle guard, and 2,000 in the rearguard.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Their emperor, Constantine XI, was seen in the vanguard.</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> What?! The Emperor wants to lead from the front lines?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> No. This must be a challenge to a war of words.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Against [♂ His /♀️ Her] Majesty, our Karl der Große.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> What do I do!?</p><hr><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> This was expected, of course.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Astolfo, one of your Noble Phantasms is a magical horn. Can it be used as a normal horn?</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Huh? Well, of course it can.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> It just blows loud if I don&#39;t activate it as a Noble Phantasm.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Then we will be using it. Ask the Casters for voice-amplifying magecraft.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> After all, unlike them, we can&#39;t put our emperor on the front lines.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> I will provide the words for you to speak. It is vital that you do not go silent or stutter.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Present yourself with confidence and dignity.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Add a little anger too! It&#39;s the secret sauce of a good speech.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...I&#39;ll try!</p><hr><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> My name is Constantine, Emperor of the Restoration Realm!</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> Karl der Große, Emperor of the Via Regia Realm, I request an audience with you!</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> Or do you have a reason not to show yourself?</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> ...! Was that...a horn?</p><p><strong>S：???:</strong><br> Order! Order! Karl der Große speaks!</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> Karl der Große...! He has a Caster amplifying his voice?</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> I ask again for an audience!</p><p><strong>Karl der Große:</strong><br> —I refuse.</p><p><strong>Karl der Große:</strong><br> I am the father of one world, and at the same time, I am the father who laments thy presence.</p><p><strong>Karl der Große:</strong><br> My sons, my daughters. Why dost thou rebel against me?</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> You&#39;re afraid of showing yourself, aren&#39;t you?</p><p><strong>Karl der Große:</strong><br> Thou art the frightened one. Thou need&#39;st my visage for thine peace of mind.</p><p><strong>Karl der Große:</strong><br> If thou wert to scorn and denounce me as an imposter, thou shouldst be able to fight with serenity.</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> ...!</p><p><strong>Karl der Große:</strong><br> But only if I were an imposter.</p><p><strong>Karl der Große:</strong><br> Thy invasion is premised on my being a false king. Thou circulated the word amongst thine soldiers.</p><p><strong>Karl der Große:</strong><br> ...Couldst thou truly not see how that was the plan?</p><p><strong>Karl der Große:</strong><br> The signal that I am the true king shall be thy troop&#39;s downfall.</p><p><strong>Karl der Große:</strong><br> I am Karl der Große, father of Europe.</p><p><strong>Karl der Große:</strong><br> Constantine, art thou willing to abandon thyself to thine instincts?</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> —</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> You got me...</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> Indeed, if you are the real Karl der Große, this war will be over before it starts.</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> Convinced as I am that you are a sham, I can&#39;t gamble all I have in the search for proof.</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> Then we fight. In my battle and victory, I will discern who you truly are.</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> See you on the battlefield!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Ugh... I&#39;m so tired...</p><hr><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Haha. That must have been mentally exhausting.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> That said, the worst has already passed. Lord Vlad.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Indeed, I take charge from here. My Master, Karl der Große.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Let us fight with all our might.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Don&#39;t let them take us down!</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Yes.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> May the fortunes of war be on our side.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Heh, spoken like a true emperor.</p><hr><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> This scrying magecraft allows us to keep track of the situation in each battlefield. Feel free to support any troop at your discretion.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Holmes, Don Quixote. Take care of the rest.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> I am going into battle!</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> The castle raid starts now. Let us review the attack.</p><p><strong>Saber Class:</strong><br> Yes, Your Lordship. Here is the map of Sirmium.</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> As you can see, Sirmium was once a city located on the Restoration Realm&#39;s border with the Via Regia Realm.</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> The east gate is adjacent to a forest. And to the west, they have a hoarding made of stone.</p><p><strong>Saber Class:</strong><br> Yes, Your Lordship. Our shortest route would be to their north gate.</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> We would have to go around the castle to attack their south gate.</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> And what is our plan?</p><p><strong>Saber Class:</strong><br> The logical route would be to raid the north gate. However...</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> Your concern is quite understandable. It&#39;s scarier when there are no visible obstacles in our way.</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> It is reasonable to assume that a trap has been set.</p><p><strong>Saber Class:</strong><br> Then how will we proceed?</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> Wait for night to fall and attack east and west simultaneously.</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> Divide our vanguard of 3,000 into two groups of 1,500 and synchronize our attacks.</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> Depending on the situation, the middle guard joins for support and closes out the game.</p><p><strong>Saber Class:</strong><br> Understood!</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> I will sort the two groups.</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> Should anything unexpected happen, I&#39;ll be the vanguard&#39;s anchor.</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> Do you understand?</p><p><strong>Saber Class:</strong><br> Yes, Your Lordship! For the Restoration of Her Holiness!</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> Heh... I was on the other side of this battle in my lifetime.</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> Life and the world alike have their ironies.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Divide the soldiers in half and attack from the east and west? That Holmes&#39; guesswork was flawless.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Judging by the movements of the troops—</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> He will split the 3,000 soldiers into groups of 1,500 to attack the east and west.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> This siege is unprecedented for both Constantine and ourselves...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Which is all the more reason to stand by at first.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> If we are in a bad position, we retreat immediately. If they are in a bad position, we immediately pursue.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> It is less than ideal, but we&#39;ll have to play by ear.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Hmph. I would most likely have arrived at the same conclusion.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> The worst possible outcome for them is to lose all of their 3,000 vanguard Servants in the opening battle.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> It would be an incident major enough for them to consider an all-out retreat. As such, they must be prudent... lest they wish to turn the battle into a footrace.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> That is as far as my reasoning can take us. The rest is up to you.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> —Forest Guard, are you prepared?</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> Yes, general!</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> At your orders. But isn&#39;t this “Forest Guard” name a little too lame?</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Hmm... Then you are the Ranger Servant Unit.</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> Much better!</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Activate the spell when half the enemy troops enter the area. Or, when they react.</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> Yessir.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> West side, Roland and Astolfo.</p><p><strong>Roland:</strong><br> Roland speaking. Astolfo and I are both ready to go.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Unlike the east side, yours shall be a battle of pure force.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Enemies might rival your strength, therefore you have no permission to die. Slay them without fail.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> His order had a strong undertone of fixation. Astolfo and Roland were necessary for the challenges ahead.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> The two understood this very well. This is why they responded to this insane request.</p><p><strong>Roland:</strong><br> You heard the man. He&#39;ll be really mad if we die.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Not that!</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> That&#39;d be worse than angering Charlie!</p><p><strong>Roland:</strong><br> Would it, really?</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Maybe I have some kind of weird hyperdimensional connection to him! I don&#39;t know. Maybe.</p><p><strong>Roland:</strong><br> Shouldn&#39;t be a connection that important. You hear me, troops?</p><p><strong>Archer Class:</strong><br> Loud and clear!</p><p><strong>Roland:</strong><br> Unlike the east side, our battle will be a slugfest.</p><p><strong>Roland:</strong><br> Don&#39;t die on me! But do die for us!</p><p><strong>Archer Class:</strong><br> Yes... Sir?</p><p><strong>Roland:</strong><br> ...Put your life on the line for the fight, but without actually dying!</p><p><strong>Archer Class:</strong><br> Understood! You could have worded it like that from the start!</p><p><strong>Assassin Class:</strong><br> (I detect a spell.)</p><p><strong>Assassin Class:</strong><br> Captain. Have you noticed?</p><p><strong>Saber Class:</strong><br> Hmm? What?</p><p><strong>Assassin Class:</strong><br> You didn&#39;t? A spell seems to have been deployed in the forest.</p><p><strong>Saber Class:</strong><br> Of course there is one. Anyone can tell this forest is a prime ambush location.</p><p><strong>Saber Class:</strong><br> The only reason they haven&#39;t attacked us is because half of our troops haven&#39;t entered the forest yet.</p><p><strong>Assassin Class:</strong><br> ...I see. I&#39;m glad you&#39;re aware.</p><p><strong>Saber Class:</strong><br> Ok, boys, let&#39;s take this bait.</p><p><strong>Assassin Class:</strong><br> Bait...?</p><p><strong>Saber Class:</strong><br> I am one of the Knights Hospitallers of Rhodes! True Name, mghhgmghmgh!</p><p><strong>Assassin Class:</strong><br> What kind of idiot shouts his True Name out of the blue!?</p><p><strong>Saber Class:</strong><br> C&#39;mon, we both know each other&#39;s cards, so it&#39;s best to take this one on one!</p><p><strong>Assassin Class:</strong><br> What are you on about?</p><p><strong>Saber Class:</strong><br> Less than 200 Servants lurk this forest.</p><p><strong>Saber Class:</strong><br> Meaning our half-cavalry of 750 Servants is more than enough to crush them! Most plans can be foiled with enough numbers!</p><p><strong>Saber Class:</strong><br> Ghh!</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> Huhu, huhuhu, huhuhuhuhuhu. Most plans can be foiled with enough numbers. Very true.</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> So here&#39;s one that can&#39;t. It looks like this:</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> Deplore the end of your luck. Weep for the beginning of your misfortune.</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> This forest is now hell.</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> Here is the fabled spell in my tao art of Qimen Dunjia.</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> The Stone Sentinel Maze. Not that my version can compare to Zhuge Liang&#39;s.</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> Kongming&#39;s is, you know, a work of art tied to his Noble Phantasm.</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> Now, Mr. Knight, if you permit the correction,</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> it&#39;s not 200 vs 750. It&#39;s 50 vs 5.</p><p><strong>Saber Class:</strong><br> What...?</p><p><strong>Assassin Class:</strong><br> I-Impossible...! We are being split.</p><p><strong>Saber Class:</strong><br> Oh no... analyze the spell and destroy it!</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> It&#39;s a race against time. Diarmuid!</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> Aye, of course! My True Name is Diarmuid.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> Steel yourselves—and fight!</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Saber Class:</strong><br> Damn you...!</p><p><strong>Archer Class:</strong><br> We&#39;ve wrapped things up here too!</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> There are still more. Don&#39;t let your guard down! There&#39;s no telling when Lady Xu Fu&#39;s spell will break.</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> It&#39;ll hold up until its limit, but it&#39;s over once that&#39;s reached.</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> Keep that in mind!</p><p><strong>Archer Class:</strong><br> As you command!</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> We&#39;ll lure in the next five. Point the way, Dunjia board!</p><p><strong>Lancer Class:</strong><br> What...!?</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> Where are my manners? I am Diarmuid, knight of the Via Regia Realm.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> Here I come!</p><p><strong>Lancer Class:</strong><br> Whoa, at least let us name ourselves too!</p><p><strong>Roland:</strong><br> Here comes the first wave!

In that case, please give it another go.</p><p><strong>Roland:</strong><br> We&#39;ll all be in a snag if this place gets destroyed!</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Well, aren&#39;t you a slave-driver!?</p><p><strong>Roland:</strong><br> We&#39;re low on fliers!</p><p><strong>Roland:</strong><br> So we&#39;re gonna be working Servants with high mobility to the bone here!</p><p><strong>Roland:</strong><br> They don&#39;t even need to have high mobility, being nimble alone is good enough!</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> I wish someone like Perseus would show up with his Pegasus!</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Roland:</strong><br> Man, our offensive is brutal...</p><p><strong>Roland:</strong><br> Figures that&#39;s what happens when you put all the brawn in the same place.</p><p><strong>Lancer Class:</strong><br> This is the west gate!

Uraaa!</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Whoa, Roland&#39;s on a rampage. Hey, Caster and Assassin over there, can you do something?</p><p><strong>Both:</strong><br> Yes, sir.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> When he starts breathing heavily— pull Roland out of battle and have him rest.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> It looks like he&#39;s burning through an absurd amount of magical energy, so things could get rather dicey if he missteps.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Things aren&#39;t the same as back when he was alive, but he loses his mind when he gets all worked up.</p><p><strong>Caster Class:</strong><br> Understood.

Barriers? Or attacks?</p><p><strong>Lancer Class:</strong><br> Either way, give some support—</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Time to summon!</p><hr><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Lancer Class:</strong><br> Well done! You drove them back!</p><p><strong>Lancer Class:</strong><br> But I couldn&#39;t quite tell what exactly you summoned. What was—</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Yeah... that&#39;s a secret.</p><hr><p><strong>Lancer Class:</strong><br> I see. Well, seeing as how it&#39;s a Noble Phantasm, I guess that&#39;s understandable. Keep it up!</p><p><strong>Roland:</strong><br> Hey, Fujimaru! Sorry, but could you come over here!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> W-What!?</p><hr><p><strong>Roland:</strong><br> The Rider squad&#39;s simultaneous assault includes their Noble Phantasms. It&#39;s hard for me to block them alone.</p><p><strong>Roland:</strong><br> I mean, I&#39;ll be fine. But the gate and ramparts behind us can&#39;t take it.</p><p><strong>Roland:</strong><br> Can you try and tank them somehow with a sturdy Servant!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...I&#39;ll give it a try!</p><hr><p><strong>Roland:</strong><br> Please do! I want to say don&#39;t push yourself, but please do push yourself!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Rider Class:</strong><br> Kh...

Don&#39;t push yourself if you think it&#39;s too dangerous!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Roger that, there&#39;s still a long way to go!</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> Right, that&#39;s the spirit.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> ...What if I only push myself a little?</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> Absolutely not, you dolt! I&#39;ll give you double the paperwork to submit!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Master, the new director is right about this.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> We have a long fight ahead of us, so be sure to pace yourself.</p><hr><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> Exactly. After all, you are now— Karl der Große!</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> What&#39;s with the look of, “I wish you wouldn&#39;t remind me”?</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> All right, now get back to your post!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> And so, after some time, the Restoration Realm forces began their retreat.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> The first battle ended in victory for the Via Regia Realm.</p><h2 id="section-15-total-war-restoration-realm-part-2" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-15-total-war-restoration-realm-part-2" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 15: Total War - Restoration Realm (Part 2)</h2><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> —I take it the retreat is complete? Report, each of you.</p><p><strong>Saber Class:</strong><br> Report from the east gate. An unidentified Bounded Field has been established in the woodlands area.</p><p><strong>Saber Class:</strong><br> It appears to be an Oriental spell, which we found difficult to analyze.</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> And since then?</p><p><strong>Saber Class:</strong><br> We have already concluded our analysis and believe we can breach it within the day.</p><p><strong>Saber Class:</strong><br> The fruits of the Casters&#39; efforts.</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> Yes, I shall reward them later. What of the west gate?</p><p><strong>Lancer Class:</strong><br> Report from the west gate. They&#39;ve assembled their elite forces there and are stubbornly holding out.</p><p><strong>Lancer Class:</strong><br> In particular, the Paladins of Charlemagne and the summoner have been giving us trouble.</p><p><strong>Lancer Class:</strong><br> They immediately summon Shadow Servants tailored to their needs and deal with us by exploiting our weaknesses.</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> ...Hmm. I shall head for the west gate to handle that.</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> If the spell of the east gate has been analyzed, then the rest should be easy.</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> Crush them. That will suffice.</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> Then the middle guard will assault the north gate... the main gate of the fortress. The scouts have ascertained it.</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> There are no traps. They likely did not have enough time to set any up.</p><p><strong>Assassin Class:</strong><br> I see... May I ask on what you base that?</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> ...We had confirmed the presence of spies in cities other than Sirmium.</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> That goes without saying.</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> There was the possibility of an abandoned city other than Sirmium being chosen during the negotiations.</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> We had ended up choosing Sirmium because we held time and honor in high regard...</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> But for the Via Regia Realm, it must have felt like treading a tightrope.</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> The lack of human resources is the Via Regia Realm&#39;s weakness. Even if they should possess one or two outstanding Servants...</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> They lack the manpower to fortify two or three cities at once.</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> Even if they work their Casters to the bone. That is to say, their limit is nearer than one might expect.</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> Now we will press our assault from three directions. East, west and north. As for the east gate—</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> I will leave it to you. Burn the forest down if you must.</p><p><strong>B：???:</strong><br> —Understood. We shall solemnly burn it down.</p><p><strong>Assassin Class:</strong><br> ...Will we really be alright with this woman?</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> She&#39;s a Berserker, going berserk is in the name. Give her plenty of space when that happens.</p><p><strong>B：???:</strong><br> Yes, burn I shall. I shall burn it down. I have no lingering attachment to this world.</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> —Constantine.</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> ...Joan?</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> Please let me go to the front lines. I shall assault the north gate.</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> ...Are you sure?</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> Please leave it to me. I shall put everything on the line to keep Her Holiness safe.</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> —Very well. Then I leave it to you.</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> But I have one question. What is your battle plan?</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> Your Emperorship, I am the Pope.</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> I shall merely pray. That—is more than enough, is it not?</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> ...Hahahahaha! That&#39;s exactly right. The enemy shall prostrate themselves before your prayers!</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> I will be in charge of handling the west gate. How long do you think the preparations for each will take?</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> Umm, half a day...I guess?</p><p><strong>Assassin Class:</strong><br> A day if we wish to fully prepare.</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> How about you, Bradamante?</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> Too slow. We have to be able to re-engage them every couple of hours.</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> Well said, Bradamante.</p><p><strong>Assassin Class:</strong><br> B-But—we&#39;re all totally exhausted.</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> I am well-aware.</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> But if we are tired, they must be all the more so.</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> One last push, just one last push. That&#39;s all I ask.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> Well then, I shall go and prepare the middle guard! Please wait here, Lady Joan!</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> We depart in two hours!</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> Eh? Huh? Y-Yes ma&#39;am! I mean, I understand!</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> All right, that&#39;s more like it! Let&#39;s do this!</p><p><strong>Assassin Class:</strong><br> Then we shall also make preparations for the east gate.</p><p><strong>B：???:</strong><br> How tiring...</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> I must apologize to the men at the west gate, but I have another task for them.</p><p><strong>Saber Class:</strong><br> I see. That&#39;s why you had us retreat early on.</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> You&#39;ve still got some remaining strength, do you not?</p><p><strong>Saber Class:</strong><br> Only a little.</p><p><strong>Saber Class:</strong><br> Nevertheless, morale will soar if victory is assured.</p><p><strong>Saber Class:</strong><br> We can depart in two hours. No problem.</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> Good to hear, then let&#39;s go!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I&#39;m beat!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes. Good work out there, Senpai. Please take a good, long rest today.</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> Hmm. Judging by the look of things, tomorrow&#39;s going to be intense too.</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> This was a tough battle, even for Servants.</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> Don&#39;t think about anything else today, just get plenty of rest.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Right, well then...</p><hr><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> Mm.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Karl der Große, I apologize for intruding on your rest, but this is an emergency.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...Huh?</p><hr><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Forgive me for imposing upon your respite, Your Majesty.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> More importantly, what&#39;s the matter!?</p><hr><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Our worst prediction came true. In all likelihood, they will press their assault from the east, west, and north in an hour.</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> W-What did you say...!?</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Their retreat was earlier than we had expected, so the possibility was there...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Yes, the speed of their retreat was odd.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> It is likely, to begin with, that Constantine has been working on the assumption that there would be a series of battles.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> And the soldiers were not informed.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> That is likely. From my appraisal of the battlefield, the soldiers were giving it their all.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Noble Phantasms flew about as they tried to take this fortress with all their might.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> ...So I had figured we would not be seeing a series of battles. I suppose that makes Constantine worthy of praise.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> To think that his soldiers were able to conserve enough energy to stage another invasion...</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Their proficiency and morale are in a different league.</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> I&#39;m afraid all this praise is not doing us any favors...</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Indeed. Let us fight hard in turn.</p><p><strong>O：Assassin Class:</strong><br> E-Emergency... Emergency!</p><p><strong>O：Assassin Class:</strong><br> The middle guard of the Restoration Realm has commenced their march on the north gate!</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Have we not already been notified?</p><p><strong>O：Assassin Class:</strong><br> W-Well...the thing is...!</p><p><strong>O：Assassin Class:</strong><br> Joan...Pope Joan leads the Restoration Realm invasion force at the north gate!</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> ...!</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> So that&#39;s how it is...!</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Mobilize the warriors of the Orient and head for the north gate!</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Do not, under any circumstance, allow anyone of her denomination on the front lines!</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> D-Do we have to go that far!?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Pope Joan. Her existence may have been denied, but she still bears the title of Pope, the head of the Church.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> The power she exerts as a Servant should be truly tremendous.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> There is no telling what would happen to our forces should they face her.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Holmes, will you be all right there?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Perhaps.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> It may have been a problem for Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, but not so much for myself.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> I will be fine, I believe.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Very well. Then I shall dispatch you.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> The battlefield at the north gate is sure to be fiercely contested.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> We will send as many of our elite forces there as we can, but the east and west gates will likely see a change in tactics compared to the first battle.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> ...To be honest, I am surprised.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> While the Revenge Realm may have suffered a debilitating blow, it still thrives.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> But this is likely the full might of the Restoration Realm.</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> ...Is it possible that they already have an arrangement with the Revenge Realm?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> It is unlikely, but I cannot rule it out with certainty either. Nevertheless, it could not have been through official diplomatic means.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Even if they stage a betrayal, there is no sign of any international law in effect.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Words are but words, and a loss is a loss.</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> In that case—</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> You are correct, Sancho. They appear to be wholeheartedly devoted to crushing us.</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> ... ...</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> S-S-S-So what should we do!?</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> That much is obvious.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> In all times and places, there is but one thing to do to an enemy who intends to destroy you.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Resist to the bitter end. Let us go, Master.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...Right!</p><hr><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Initiate wide area transmission.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> O elite warriors of the Via Regia Realm, hear me.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> It has been ascertained that the Restoration Realm forces you repelled at midnight have made their preparations and are on the offensive once more.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> It is a vicious way of working your troops to the bone—</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> But let me ask this. Have you fought on battlefields so peaceful that this much is sufficient to drive you to despair?</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Enemies, enemies, enemies.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Is it not perfectly natural to be surrounded by enemies on all sides?</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> For it is by overturning this, that you are here.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> To be honored as a hero and to have perished as one.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> In other words, to put it plainly, fight and triumph.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> For that is my wish, the wish of the Via Regia Realm, and of Karl der Große!</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> ...Morale remains high for the time being.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Our fates will depend on whether or not we can overcome this string of battles.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Not even the forces of the Restoration Realm are inexhaustible. If we can repel this, they will choose to withdraw.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> The east gate, the west gate, the north gate. Now, what to do—</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> I will take the north gate.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Don Quixote, Astolfo, Roland, and Diarmuid will take the west gate.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> I will be dispatching our elite forces.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> And Master...can I leave the east gate to you?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...Roger that!</p><hr><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> It is likely that Xu Fu&#39;s Taoist spells will be ineffective. These strings of battles would only happen if they had a way around it.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Close the gate, and follow the rules of siege warfare to buy time.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> I shall remain here to keep abreast of the situation on the battlefield and issue additional directives.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> —This will be a long night.</p><p><strong>O：Assassin Class:</strong><br> You&#39;ve come at just the right time! Lady Xu Fu has...!</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> Huh? My Stone Sentinel Maze (Simplified) has been dismantled? That fast?</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> No, no, that&#39;s impossible!

That&#39;s...well...</p><p><strong>Saber Class:</strong><br> Whatever, give that to me!</p><p><strong>Saber Class:</strong><br> I&#39;ll shoot her!</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> ... ...</p><p><strong>Saber Class:</strong><br> Tch. You, Archer. Take aim and shoot!</p><p><strong>Saber Class:</strong><br> We are the Via Regia Realm, and we face the Restoration Realm. That makes them the enemy!</p><p><strong>Archer Class:</strong><br> I-I get that!

The north gate is breached!</p><p><strong>Saber Class:</strong><br> Berserkers and Lancers have formed up to hold the north gate, but without reinforcements...!</p><p><strong>Archer Class:</strong><br> There aren&#39;t going to be any reinforcements!

If you can get past my Noble Phantasm, these Threefold Walls, that is.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> H-He&#39;s strong...by myself, breaching a single wall is the best I can do!</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> One wall&#39;s all I can phase through. Any more than that is too much to ask!</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> That thing is the dictionary definition of an ironclad defense!</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> We&#39;ll probably need Mehmed II, or a Servant on a level comparable to him to breach those, won&#39;t we?</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> ...I shall trust your instincts. Well then, Diarmuid.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> At your command.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Lead your men and whittle down Constantine&#39;s forces. It ought to be better than nothing.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> At once.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Lord Vlad.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Holmes? Should you not be at the north gate?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> The gate has been opened, but I dropped a quantity of rubble in the gateway.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Just as planned. Well done.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> It won&#39;t stop them forever, but it should buy us some time.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> More importantly, we should shift our focus to this location. Situationally speaking—</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> I have come to report! The west gate is being overrun. At this rate...!</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> I see...</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> ... ...</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Prepare to retreat.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> We exhausted every strategy and spell we had on hand, but we still couldn&#39;t hold out.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Don Quixote.</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> Y-Yes.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> ...I am sorry.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> The men and resources you entrusted me with have gone to waste.</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> No.</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> ...I alone could not have made it this far. The whims of fate decide victory and defeat.</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> I, too, am familiar with the bitter taste of defeat. Of course, compared to this war, I may as well have been playing in the mud.</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> I shall serve as your rearguard.</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> The fate of the Via Regia realm rests on your shoulders now.</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> —I cannot let you do that, your grace.</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> Sancho? ...No, you must evacuate too.</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> Your grace, I am your maid, squire, and princess. I am your guardian.</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> I will save you, sir. Come hell or high water.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Sancho, what are you—</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Lord Vlad!</p><hr><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> What is the matter, Master?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> The east gate is...!</p><hr><p><strong>All:</strong><br> ...!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> —A little while ago.</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> Umm... Are you an acquaintance of hers?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> It&#39;s a long story...</p><hr><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> Well, it&#39;s not exactly uncommon for an allied Servant to turn enemy.</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> Take it easy, take it easy.</p><p><strong>Assassin Class:</strong><br> More importantly.</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> What?</p><p><strong>Assassin Class:</strong><br> The forest has been burned down, and the east gate is wide open.</p><p><strong>Assassin Class:</strong><br> There may be no time to catch our breath.</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> Have you instructed the Casters to fortify the gate and ramparts?</p><p><strong>Assassin Class:</strong><br> We&#39;re already trying, but there&#39;s a limit to what we can manage...</p><p><strong>Assassin Class:</strong><br> It&#39;s unlikely we can defend against the destructive power of their back-to-back Noble Phantasms.</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> Ugh. So this is what she meant by “strength in numbers”!</p><p><strong>Assassin Class:</strong><br> ...Incoming!</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> Good evening. We meet again♡</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Speak of the devil!</p><hr><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> I am so very happy. Truly, all that burning was but a small price to pay.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> So, have you reconsidered? Aren&#39;t you interested in joining us?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Absolutely not.</p><hr><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> ... ...</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> Oh— What a shame♡</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> —It happened in the blink of an eye.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Neither Xu Fu nor the Master of Chaldea had their guard down.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> They had both been prepared for combat.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> And yet.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> “Stand your ground!” “We&#39;re being overrun. Leg it out of here!”</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Their thoughts could not have been further apart.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> ...It truly is such a shame. Send word, Assassin.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> The east gate has been destroyed.</p><p><strong>S：Assassin Class:</strong><br> Compliments from His Lordship and a further directive. “The west gate has fallen. Commence pincer attack.”</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> No way...!?</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> As expected, that man moves with the grace of a swan, yet strikes with the precision of a snake.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> —So, what shall it be?</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> I have 1,500 servants at my command, ready to overrun you.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Just one thing before you do.</p><hr><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> ...?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> The west gate hasn&#39;t fallen.</p><hr><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> ...!</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> Huh? Seriously?</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> Whatever makes you say that?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Lord Vlad still draws breath at the west gate.</p><hr><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> ... ...</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> Now that you mention it— there should be more of a commotion if the west gate did fall...</p><p><strong>S：Assassin Class:</strong><br> T-That doesn&#39;t matter, does it!?</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> ... ...Which one of you lied?</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> Is it His Lordship? Or is it you?</p><p><strong>S：Assassin Class:</strong><br> That&#39;s—</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> The Restoration Realm has slighted me. I shall be leaving you now.</p><p><strong>S：Assassin Class:</strong><br> W-What did you say...!?</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> The Restoration Realm is a pure land, free of lies and deception.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> ...or at least, so I originally thought.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> I simply cannot lend my support to a land of two-faced liars, even if it is only for appearances.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> For I stand to lose my own pride.</p><p><strong>S：Assassin Class:</strong><br> You&#39;re gonna defect to the Via Regia Realm?</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> ... ...You over there, Caster.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> Have you ever told a lie?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I have.</p><hr><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> —Is that so?</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> Then there is no place for me to go.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> I shall leave this place to you. I have destroyed the east gate.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> Surely you are not going to lose without me now, are you?</p><p><strong>S：Assassin Class:</strong><br> ... ...Heroes truly are incorrigible.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> I am an anti-hero. If you wish to take my life, feel free to try.</p><p><strong>S：Assassin Class:</strong><br> Get lost. We&#39;ll take care of things ourselves.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> Yes, that I shall.</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> T-Thank goodness~.</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> Talk about avoiding a fiery temper...</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> ...Although, she still destroyed the east gate.</p><p><strong>Assassin Class:</strong><br> For the time being, we have the Casters working on fixing the gate.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Then we&#39;ll go buy you some time!</p><hr><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> ... ...</p><p><strong>Assassin Class:</strong><br> Are you not going, Lady Xu Fu?</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> ...I AM GOING! Damn it, this all feels very defeatist!</p><p><strong>Rider Class:</strong><br> Wipe them out! Our victory is at hand!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Let&#39;s give all we have to protect them...!</p><hr><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> N-No more! All troops, retreat! Retreat!</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> We will demolish the ramparts completely and buy time as instructed...!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Did we receive such instructions!?</p><hr><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> Yes, we did!</p><p><strong>Assassin Class:</strong><br> Copy that, we&#39;ll blow it up! Archer!</p><p><strong>Archer Class:</strong><br> Unleashing Noble Phantasm...! Fire!</p><p><strong>Rider Class:</strong><br> Damn them...! But the gate is no more!</p><p><strong>Rider Class:</strong><br> Move in! Charge! Over the demolished ramparts!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> And so the eastern gate has been breached...</p><hr><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> ...I suppose we have no choice but to retreat to the Via Regia Realm. Send word of our retreat to every commander.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> My apologies, Master... this battle is lost.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Let us not drown ourselves in our own regrets. We will simply make our next move.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> That being...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> (Lord Vlad, I will subdue Miss Sancho. So make your escape as quickly as—)</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Holmes?</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> I won&#39;t let you.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Guh...!?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> You are quite quick to surrender, Miss Sancho.</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> Yes. Especially in the interest of his grace&#39;s safety.</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> Sancho? Hey, what are you doing? Sancho?</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> We will both surrender to the Restoration Realm. I have Lord Vlad in mind as an offering.</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> Wha... Whaaat!?</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> This would not have been an option if we were dealing with Kriemhild.</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> But with the Restoration...with Constantine, a plea for mercy should work.</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> At what point did you notice?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Since quite a while ago.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> You only appeared troubled when it came to Don Quixote&#39;s safety and wellbeing.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> However, this is surely a rather spontaneous decision.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> If it wasn&#39;t, you would already be collaborating with the opposition.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> And you most likely...have not tipped your hand to Don Quixote either.</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> It&#39;s because his worship happens to wear his heart on his sleeve.</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> ...Stop it, Sancho! This is not what I want!</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> Would you rather die, then?</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> Well, that&#39;s...</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> You don&#39;t want to die. You don&#39;t want to be hurt. That&#39;s what makes humans human.</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> Have you forgotten that we are not heroes, your worship?</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> —!</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Holmes. Rendezvous with Master and fulfill your duty!</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> ...Understood.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Well then, Sancho. I am apparently your bargaining chip.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> So, take me with you.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Someone must be chosen to take the fall, in any case.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Constantine is sure to be satisfied with my head.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> But...</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> ...We are not to lay a finger on the Master of Chaldea... right?</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Just so.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> For that is what truly matters to me and to Holmes.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> May you remain faithful to your lord no matter what.</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> Please stop, Sancho. I really...</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> Your grace.</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> No... I don&#39;t mean to...deny your devotion...</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Don Quixote. O knight-errant who longed for the legends and became one himself.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> You will gain no trust if betrayal causes hesitation in you.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> You would be better off growing a thicker skin.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Otherwise, you stand to gain no trust from anyone.</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> That is fine.</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> We don&#39;t expect anyone to trust in us.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Sancho...what drives you to such lengths?</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> You would not understand, Lord Vlad.</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> Battles, heroes, gods, and legends all terrify us.</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> We wish to steer clear of them if possible. We don&#39;t want to be in their presence for even an instant.</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> For we are banal and unremarkable. We have no right to stand beside everyone else.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> But everyone knows of Don Quixote the knight.</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> As a synonym for fool, true... But that is fine.</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> No matter how foolish we may be, or how much we may regret, we will live on.</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> We simply have to survive...!</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Your feelings are being laid bare, Sancho. You should calm down.</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> ...I&#39;m sorry. Well, let us be off.</p><h2 id="section-16-the-king-arrived-for-his-gallant-knight" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-16-the-king-arrived-for-his-gallant-knight" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 16: The King Arrived for His Gallant Knight</h2><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> —We want to live.</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> We want to draw breath, for our hearts to beat, to breathe in oxygen and exhale carbon dioxide.</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> To long for that, to wish for it, is not evil.</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> Then, is it evil to betray something to achieve that? Is it evil to flee?</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> I&#39;m sorry...! I can&#39;t do it, I just can&#39;t do it!</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> We cannot win. We cannot fight back. We are of no use.</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> Forgive me, forgive me, please forgive me...! Please forgive me for running away!</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> We ran.</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> We ran all the way to this Singularity from the Atlantean Lostbelt.</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> ...Yes. We fled.</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> No, that&#39;s not right. I made him flee.</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> He was so scared that he no longer knew what was right, or what to do—</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> Yes, he merely asked. But it&#39;s no wonder he did.</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> There were gods there. There were heroes there with the strength of demons.</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> A few Servants decided there was no victory to be had, who gave up and vanished.</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> All the while proclaiming they did not wish to waste their time or their magical energy.</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> There were also those who stood their ground. There were also those who did not flee, but took flight from the world.</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> And there were those, like us, who ran away.</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> Using our second Noble Phantasm, we escaped Atlantis with ease.</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> Our miscalculation was that we wandered into this Singularity right after we made our escape.</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> We are a rare breed of Servant, one who came here with knowledge of the Lostbelts.</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> ...I do not regret having fled. We would not have contributed anything to the war effort.</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> I kept making excuses that it would not have made a difference even if we stood our ground here.</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> —But Chaldea did it. They pulled it off.</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> They were all splendid, noble, and proud heroes.</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> Which is why we were not there...</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> I feel nothing in particular about that.</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> Because our presence or absence would not have affected the outcome any.</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> But it was a most shocking event for his grace.</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> I was—wrong.</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> That is not true.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>Don&#39;t say that.

But even so, his worship tried to do good until the end.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> However, that goodness was the goodness of the mediocre. What was needed now is valor.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I want you to live. I want you to live your life as a person.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> ...This may differ from the expectations of one summoned as a Servant.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> But I believe that is what I am here for.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> So I shall betray. Even if it goes against his wishes.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> —But there was just one thing I failed to take into account.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I had believed his grace to be good but cowardly, having lost his valor in Atlantis.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> But what mattered was neither cravenness nor valor. It was virtue.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> His grace, who had been accompanying Lord Vlad, wordlessly moved to do something no one had expected.</p><p><strong>Saber Class:</strong><br> All troops, fall back!

I presume that you are the negotiator?</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> Yes.</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> In exchange for sparing my life and Don Quixote&#39;s, I will offer you Vlad III—</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> That was it.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> At this point, Constantine was willing to negotiate.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Of course, there was the option of capturing both Sancho and Don Quixote too.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> But that thought vanished the instant he heard the name of Don Quixote.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Famous he may be. The most famous knight in the world he may be.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> But strong, he is not. He is but a washed up old man, a pitiful country bumpkin.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> This is something anyone who has read the story of Don Quixote knows well.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> As he moved to declare that there would be no issues—something fluttered to his feet.</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> Hmm...?</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> ...I am...</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> Your...grace?</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> I am the knight-errant, Don Quixote de la Mancha!</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> I named myself Karl der Große in the Via Regia Realm and have inherited his will!</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> ...I-I am a Servant of Pan-Human History! I have been summoned to vanquish you!</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> Mighty emperor, Constantine XI!</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> I hereby challenge you to a duel!</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> —. —.</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> ... ...Well, now.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>A voice so cold, it almost froze Sancho&#39;s spine.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>It did not merely signify the breakdown of negotiations, but was tantamount to a declaration of war.</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> Sir.</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> ... ...</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> You won&#39;t harm a hair on my princess, my squire, or my friends.</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> Not for as long as I still stand, anyway.</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> Very well. Single combat it is.</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> I shall show you no mercy, O self-proclaimed knight.</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> —Prepare yourself, Pan-Human History. The rest of you, make no interference!</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> This is my fight!</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> O emperor who rebels against the Human Order, you are the one who ought to be prepared!</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> No, no, sir!</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> Don&#39;t say it, Sancho! I know, I know damn well!</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> That this act renders your devotion and your wishes meaningless!</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> But still, I must not retreat!</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> Here...I come!</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> W-We have to hide for now... Hm? Something wrong?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> No... Wait a moment.</p><hr><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Good, here you are!</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> The situation is not looking good. Lord Vlad has been captured by Sancho.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> By Sancho...!?</p><hr><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> ...That was always a risk.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> She serves Don Quixote, and our interests merely happened to align.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> She would willingly turn on us if it means prolonging the life of her lord.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> But...I, too, have erred. The timing could not have been worse.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> The Via Regia Realm will now cease to function as a collective.</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> ...You what?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Miss Xu Fu, you are to fall back to the Via Regia Realm—</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> No...we&#39;ve come this far.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> We should probably tell our little Xu Fu.</p><hr><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> Hey, punk. It&#39;s Lady Xu Fu to you. So, tell me what?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> In any case, we are not safe here. I will explain the situation as we retreat.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> ...[♂ Mister /♀️ Miss] Fujimaru, I take it you are prepared for her to turn hostile?</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> Huh, what? All of a sudden, I&#39;d rather not hear what you have to say!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I&#39;m sorry!</p><hr><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> Huh? What? Whatareyouonabout!?</p><p><strong>Meunière:</strong><br> Emergency transmission! Contact with enemy forces, imminent.</p><p><strong>Meunière:</strong><br> Repel them posthaste and make your escape!</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> Huh, what&#39;s this transmission? What... WHAT—!?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Now, let me explain the situation as we engage the enemy forces.</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> Is this really the time for that—!?</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> So you guys are from Pan-Human History!? ...I mean, so am I! Strictly speaking, anyway!</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Precisely.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I&#39;m really sorry.</p><hr><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> ... ...</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> Uhh... ...uhh.</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> ...Fine, I forgive you! In exchange, let me hit you once later on.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Do you not harbor any fury towards Pan-Human History?</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> I&#39;d be lying if I said I didn&#39;t.</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> But it&#39;s something imposed on us by our Master.</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> And it seems I&#39;m under way less of its influence. I&#39;ve kept quiet about it for my own good, though.</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> If I hadn&#39;t, things would&#39;ve gotten out of hand.</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> I&#39;m the exception to the rule, though. It&#39;s best you don&#39;t share your secret too widely...</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> ... ...</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> Ah, so here I have some bad news, more bad news, and even more bad news.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Yes, what is it!!?</p><hr><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> Don Quixote has gone public about having called himself Karl der Große.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> ...I see.</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> He&#39;s spilled the beans about being a Pan-Human History Servant.</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> Right...</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> And then challenged Constantine to one-on-one combat...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Why on earth...?</p><hr><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong></p><h1 id="i-have-no-idea-either" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#i-have-no-idea-either" aria-hidden="true">#</a> I have no idea either!</h1><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> Gah!</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> ... ...</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> Ggh...mmngh!</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> N-Not yet! En garde!</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> Grgh...guh...!</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> Sir!</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> Stay back!</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> ... ...</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> G-gah...!</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> ...How curious.</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> Your glorious armor has been reduced to scrap, and yet you still stand.</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> Has your fame given you this resilience?</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> Don Quixote. A foolish old man of a knight. Nothing more than a clown.</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> Unfortunately, this is reality.</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> Your chivalry, your own story. None of that matters here.</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> Not to mention, your claim of being a Servant of Pan-Human History.</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> ...Did chivalry drive you to do this?</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> Koff...</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> No... ahahahahaha! That...that was...just on a whim...you see?</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> ...? Incomprehensible.</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> Why would you undo all that you had built?</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> You could have obediently turned over Vlad III and gone into hiding.</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> Your selfish actions are utterly meaningless.</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> As long as you side with Pan-Human History, I will kill you and your followers.</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> I do feel sorry...for Sancho...</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> —But I can&#39;t give in. It&#39;s wrong. I simply cannot give up.</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> ...I see.</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> Sir!</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> O Emperor, please stop!</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> You&#39;ve already won! We are defeated! My life is yours!</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> So—</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> Sancho! Never say that word!</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> For you are both Sancho and Dulcinea!</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> You are my beloved lady!</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> ...!</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> O Emperor.</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> You are a great man, one who shoulders the weight of an entire empire.</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> Compared to you, I am simply a clown playing the part of a knight.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I must be delusional.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Perhaps I am nothing more than an old man who stole the idea of Don Quixote...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Or perhaps I am nothing more than a phantom, a collection of ridiculous fantasies.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> No, no. No, no, no—</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> If that were the case, then where did that pain come from? Where did that sense of dread come from?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I had run away.</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> Onward, to Olympus!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> The greatest heroes of legend had gathered together.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Some of them were different from what I imagined.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Among such legends, I felt out of place.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I met true knights. I had dreamt of such a moment.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> It truly was the story of my dreams. A dazzling tale of brilliant adventure!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I felt alive! I was a living knight!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> —But...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Even they were no match against the gods of Atlantis.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> To see the world&#39;s greatest heroes disappear before my eyes...it was heartbreaking.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I couldn&#39;t do anything. I was powerless.</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> Then let us run away. Leave it all to me, your grace.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Her words were enough to move me to tears.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Without thinking, I abandoned chivalry.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> And I found myself in this Singularity.</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> I...ran away. I ran away from my dream.</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> And to run away now...even in reality...</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> You—</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> If I run away...then I&#39;ve lost...</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> No matter how much of a fool Don Quixote was... he remained victorious until the very end...</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> To so easily have lost sight of something so important...</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> —It&#39;s only to be expected.</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> Helping others. Being a good person.</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> Before even one&#39;s knighthood, these ideals are what every human must strive to be.</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> If I can stand and fight here and now, then I must do so!</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> Even should you be my opponent, O Emperor!</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> —Hmph.</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> Uraaaaaaah!</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> ...I ought to respect your determination. However...</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> Ggh...urgh...</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> Sadly, we have our own creed to fulfill to her as well.</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> Forgive me, Don Quixote. You were a fool of a knight, but a splendid individual!</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> Sir!</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Evade, Don Quixote! That blow—</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Everyone knew it meant death.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Sancho, watching from the sidelines. Vlad III too, and Don Quixote himself.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Constantine was convinced this strike would seal his victory.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> —And then the night became bright as day.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> The brilliant holy light dazzled all 1,500 of the surrounding Restoration Realm Servants.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> —Man, was that cool.</p><p><strong>I：???:</strong><br> You don&#39;t run away from reality. You confront it.</p><p><strong>I：???:</strong><br> That&#39;s the coolest thing you could do. Not just as a knight, but as a person.</p><p><strong>I：???:</strong><br> I guess you&#39;ve earned the name of Karl der Große.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> I&#39;ll allow it! And if I tell you yes, well, no one out there can say otherwise!</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> I ask of you, what is your name?</p><p><strong>I：???:</strong><br> My name is Charlemagne!</p><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> Also known as Karl der Große, the father of Europe!</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> Wh—at?</p><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> I&#39;m the real thing, the genuine article. So, Don Quixote!</p><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> Brave hero, no less vigorous than my paladins,</p><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> your battle is enshrined in my heart!</p><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> Therefore, I command you this new task! Leave this place to protect your princess!</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> I must refuse!</p><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> ... ...Seriously?</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> I—by my honor as a knight, I must know...!</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> Are you truly Charlemagne, and are you really on our side...</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> I must find this out! Sancho, get somewhere safe—</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> No. If I move from here, I&#39;ll cry.</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> Okay, never mind!</p><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> ...Ahahahahah! A good knight needs a good princess and a good squire after all!</p><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> Then behold! My brilliance! My Holy Sword! My Noble Phantasm!</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> —A Noble Phantasm!?</p><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> Taste the radiance of my Holy Sword, Constantine!</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> This light... It is truly...!</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> The Holy Sword, Joyeuse.</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> Said to change its color thirty times a day.</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> One of the greatest Holy Swords in legend, passed down to him from the emperor of Constantinople...!</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> Th-That means...!</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> That he is the real, authentic, genuine Karl der Große... He is really Charlemagne!</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> That&#39;s what it means!</p><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> Naturally!</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> ... ...</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> Constantine. Fall back.</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> Joan!</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> We have already won.</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> The Via Regia Servants in front of the north gate are being mopped up.</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> There is no purpose in risking your life here.</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> But they are Servants of Pan-Human History!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> We&#39;re fashionably late!</p><hr><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> —!</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> It is good to see that you&#39;re still alive, Don Quixote, Miss Sancho.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Looking at the situation—indeed, it seems the tables have been well and truly turned.</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> Master Fujimaru, Master Holmes...</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> Your Emperorship.</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> ...Understood. We&#39;re falling back.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Your Majesty, Emperor Constantine.</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> ...?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> I have nothing to say to you. I hope you will accept our sincerity.</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> ...My thanks. Men! We withdraw!</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> ...My king.</p><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> Believe in the path you have chosen, Bradamante. That&#39;s the star we&#39;re fighting under.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> ...Thank you very much, my king! And please excuse me!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> More importantly, (fake-)Seton!</p><hr><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> Yeah! Seton is my old name! I&#39;m Charlemagne now!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Seriously!?</p><hr><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> Of course. I&#39;m Charlemagne, super seriously.</p><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> I came to this Singularity as Karl der Große&#39;s proxy.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...Huh?</p><hr><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> Karl der Große&#39;s...proxy?</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Then you really are an imposter. No, that king&#39;s ambition...</p><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> Well, if you boil it down, I really am Karl der Große.</p><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> But you can think of me as not being the “Father of Europe”.</p><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> Right now I&#39;m just Charlemagne, the man who left behind a funny old legend in Europe.</p><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> Like...it&#39;s the me from my young adventurer days, get it?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> I see.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> The legends of your adventures with the Twelve Paladins, and the legends of you founding a great empire as the Father of Europe.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Servants can occasionally gain Saint Graphs with an emphasis towards different sides of them.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Both the good and evil parts of a person can manifest separately, for example.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> In your case, you are heavily influenced by the legends of your grand adventures.</p><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> Of course the great detective would figure it out, no problemo!</p><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> That said...</p><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> You see, one time I got into a mortal struggle with my kingly facet. Call it a domestic dispute, if you will.</p><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> It happened because...well, it&#39;s a long story. What matters is that we were on good terms when all was said and done.</p><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> And so this time, he&#39;s letting this aspect of himself take care of things.</p><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> “You must go to this Singularity. Worry not, I shall grant you my aid, paltry though it is.”</p><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> So he said.</p><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> And so, I&#39;ve managed to manifest myself somehow or another. But unfortunately, I&#39;m still an irregularity.</p><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> I wasn&#39;t summoned by the Holy Grail, but from a chain summoning with the paladins as a basis.</p><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> So y&#39;know, “no Master + forcing an impossible summon = my Saint Graph got all screwed up”.</p><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> I&#39;ve managed to keep myself in good shape up until now thanks to my safety mode...</p><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> But I can only go all-out...hmm...maybe twice more if I really stick to it!</p><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> I&#39;m also on a timer, so even if I don&#39;t do anything, I&#39;ll be gone in about 48 hours.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Hold up.</p><p><strong>Roland:</strong><br> What the hell is this—!?</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Your Majesty! What are you even doing here!</p><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> Well, to help out you guys + Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Both:</strong><br> Eh?</p><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> Do I look like the sort of heartless jerk who would abandon his beloved friends and subordinates?</p><p><strong>Roland:</strong><br> Well, no. I didn&#39;t think you&#39;d do that, but...did you really go out of your way just for that reason?</p><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> Hell yeah!</p><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> I mean, helping cool guys like you is just the most awesome thing ever!</p><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> Though I sorta just geeked out too much over Don Quixote&#39;s coolness right now,</p><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> and activated my true power!</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> ...Huh?</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> Hey, Sancho. Did he say the wrong name there just now?</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> No, Lord Charlemagne actually did say that.</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> That Don Quixote is the greatest of all knights.</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> No, he didn&#39;t just say that!</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> He said it. I heard it, did I not?</p><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> ...Yep!</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> You made him say it! You forced him to say that just now!</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> —But for me, it&#39;s true. You really are the greatest of knights.</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> ...I&#39;m deeply sorry, everyone. We&#39;ve been such a hindrance.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Sancho.</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> —Yes.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> On occasions like this, even one such as myself can read the room.</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> ...Huh?</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> “Just pretend it never happened.”</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> I believe that is the best solution here, do you not?</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> Um, that&#39;s...a little too convenient...</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> This crisis is just as much my fault.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> In hindsight, this whole episode may end up being quite the black mark beside my name.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> So I, too, would like to pretend it never happened.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Do you agree, Your Majesty?</p><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> Like I just said, I don&#39;t really have an imperial aura or whatever, but...I guess?</p><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> That doesn&#39;t mean we&#39;ve reached a happily-ever-after yet, though.</p><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> The Via Regia&#39;s army is in tatters.</p><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> Some of them didn&#39;t believe me when I appealed to them, and others were hostile to me simply because I&#39;m a Pan-Human History Servant.</p><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> Between all this...we&#39;d be lucky to end up with just 500 left.</p><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> —Still, Sancho Panza.</p><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> And Don Quixote.</p><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> Will you follow me? No, follow us?</p><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> Specifically, this kid right here!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Huh...?</p><hr><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> ...We were Pan-Human History Servants from the start. We have no other choice.</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> If Master Fujimaru will still have us, that is.</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> Um... I don&#39;t mind if you send me off to die, so long as you forgive Sancho...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> If Lord Vlad is okay with it, then so am I.</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> Thank you so much! My Master!</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> I am very grateful, Master Fujimaru. No, Lord Master.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> No problems here. Let&#39;s fight together.</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> Of course we shall!</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> ...Yes.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> And if Don Quixote should fall into danger?</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> ...Of course, I will not betray you...</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Her eyes! Look at her eyes!</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Haha. I apologize, that was in poor taste on my part. That will suffice.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> After all, you won&#39;t be able to get away with something like that a second time.</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> ...I can&#39;t argue with that.</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> Much less with the generosity you two offer.</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> Thank you very much.</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> And please, take good care of his grace.</p><hr><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> All right then. Let&#39;s rally the remaining Servants.</p><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> Be careful though, they might get angry and start a riot!</p><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> It&#39;s no big deal.

For the Yellow Turban puppet soldiers were now sitting ducks.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> However. She had the wits to realize right away.</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> —Oh, so it&#39;s me.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Legend has it that the threefold walls fell on account of a single gate, heedlessly left unlocked.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Its veracity is irrelevant. All that matters is that this legend was engraved.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Thus—a hole is always present in these walls. Even though it may be one as small as the eye of a needle.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> It is through this hole that Joan now finds herself targeted.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Quite the trouble, she thought.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> She understood instinctively that this arrow will unfailingly take a life.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> She folds her arms in her mind&#39;s eye, and thinks.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> To sacrifice someone else is–unthinkable. To sacrifice oneself is–bothersome.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Between the unthinkable and the bothersome, the latter would be of lesser consequence.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Her death would indeed cause problems.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> It is even possible that the Restoration Realm stands to lose its reason for existence.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Yet Joan thinks.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Constantine&#39;s Noble Phantasm is the embodiment of the Byzantine, of the Eastern Roman Empire&#39;s legend.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> That is to say, it recreates real events. In which case,</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> its protection would be limited to those who once existed in reality.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Wouldn&#39;t fictitious and imaginary beings of fantasy like Joan fall outside the scope of its protection?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Such a possibility does exist.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> She never wished for anyone to die for her sake.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> —This is fate.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Such a thing was bound to happen someday for everyone who calls themselves a hero or a saint.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> A sudden death, a pointless end. This is how humans are, it seems.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Presumptuous as it may be for a fictitious being to speak about humans.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> It is a fact that meeting a human-like end gave her a measure of comfort.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> And yet.</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> Joan!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> The winds of fate changed.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> How had it not occurred to me? That he would notice the enemy&#39;s Noble Phantasm and try to shield me.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> How had it not occurred to me? That he would have reached the same conclusion I did.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> The lone fantasy that the threefold walls would not protect.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Constantine must have considered this possibility at least once in all this time.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> —It was unthinkable that he wouldn&#39;t have.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Because this man, this emperor who wished to lead a peaceful life,</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> had cherished the girl-shaped fantasy that is Joan.</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> Get down, Joan!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> It was an act tantamount to leaving the gate unlocked.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> No matter how firm these walls may be, they are meaningless so long as that legend exists.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Constantine shielded Joan.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> That was, of course, the right move. For a fantasy has no place within his walls.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Hence, it is Pope Joan who would have been skewered—</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Hence, Kriemhild has attained the best possible outcome.</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> —I have you now, Emperor.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> ...I recall the day of my summoning.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> The rebellion against Pan-Human History carved into my soul.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> The moment I chose to keep moving forward with that anger, even as my heart ached—</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I met a woman who I should have killed.</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> ...I see, is that so? Then you and I are enemies.</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> It would seem so, Your Holiness.</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> Oh!

You can tell?</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> You know that...you are someone who does not exist in history.</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> Huh? Well, I mean, yeah?</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> I am a hopeless fantasy who fleetingly emerged from the interstices of history and was denied in ten seconds flat.</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> Or are you saying I belong in the history&#39;s own trashcan because I was thoroughly rejected without ever becoming a legend?</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> Did I go that far!?</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> Well, I&#39;m surely better off dying right here by the wayside.</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> I will, of course, resist if you try to kill me. But it would be futile, wouldn&#39;t it?</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> Futile?</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> —Because I was rejected. Rejected by the Pan-Human History you rebel against.</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> ...Do you hold a grudge over it?</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> I do!</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> So you don&#39;t deny it...</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> I mean, of course I do!</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> I mean, don&#39;t create something if you&#39;re just gonna deny it. Don&#39;t add details for what you&#39;re just going to discard. Basic manners!</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> The whole affair with the Pope being exposed as a woman, whoever wrote that was into some seriously unholy stuff!</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> Putting everything into perspective makes me want to, I don&#39;t know, shake history by the collar!</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> Then, umm... smash its head against a landline phone, and burn it to cinders with a flamethrower. For starters.</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> You&#39;re into some pretty unholy stuff yourself, you know...</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> —Well, I&#39;m alive now, and I can&#39;t let my life go to waste.</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> I offer my body and my life not to those who would deny me,</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> but to something else entirely. Does that satisfy you, O Emperor?</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> Now then, let us fight.</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> —No, I&#39;m not going to fight you.</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> ...You won&#39;t?</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> I am fatally incompatible with Kriemhild, who was summoned before me.</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> I believe I&#39;m better off assembling Servants under my own banner than being at her beck and call.</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> Yes. I will restore you. I swear it.</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> A noble cause, one worth rebelling against Pan-Human History to accomplish. Even if I was simply attacking others for no reason until now—</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> As long as there&#39;s a driving force, there&#39;s a whydunit, no?</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> I cannot forgive the fact that you were erased. I cannot forgive those who threw you in the trash.</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> So I will affirm you.</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> I will incorporate you into Pan-Human History as someone who truly existed.</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> —Huh. Oh. Huh?</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> Yeah, and while you do make a lot of funny faces, it would be better if you remained prim and proper in front of our army.</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> A-Are you seriously doing this!?</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> You don&#39;t want to disappear, do you?</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> O-Of course I don&#39;t!</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> Then work with me here. To live, to survive.</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> Let me be your pawn, Joan.</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> ...I&#39;ll double-cross you at the worst possible moment, you know?</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> After all, I&#39;m technically a Servant of Pan-Human History.</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> When that happens, that&#39;s where I&#39;ll give up. For I rebel so that you may live.</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> As for why, wouldn&#39;t you say it&#39;s rather stylish in itself?</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> How secular of you...</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> You do realize that showing off to the ladies is unbecoming of a monarch, right?</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> Well, you&#39;re absolutely right.</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> Unbecoming as well as lecherous. Wretched enough to fall for a honey trap.</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> But if it&#39;s for you, even becoming a foolish monarch doesn&#39;t sound so bad.</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> I am, after all, a rebel.</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> ... ...</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> So, what say you? Will you accept?</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> If you refuse, I will simply persist until you do.</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> ...Fine. I. Get. It!</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> Damn me for succumbing to temptation!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> —Thus, I gained a reason to win, no matter what.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> She was cheerful, clever, quick-witted, and frank.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> She swore vulgarly in the face of her fate and yet she had accepted it in contentful resignation.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Then let that fate be changed.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> This is a restoration.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Of your rights as a human being. In other words, a retrieval of your means to live.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> The repulsive ending of an eternally ephemeral, yet beautiful fantasy shall be overturned.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I want you to walk this earth. I want you to breathe in deeply.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I want you to shout and laugh out loud.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Yes—deep down, that is what my wish was.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> If it were to come under attack, it would surely spell my defeat.</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> Constantine!

Please call for our specialist spellcasters.</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> Wait, Constantine...!? You&#39;re in no condition to get up yet!</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> Would you rather have me lie down and wait for death? Not in a million years.</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> You&#39;re even speaking indignantly!</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> You&#39;re one to talk. Ugh...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I accept all the pain and all the regrets. Back and forth, to and fro.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Oh, what a... quintessentially human life I have led.</p><p><strong>Caster Class:</strong><br> The spell is prepared.

This may not be what you want to hear, but I have been fatally shot.</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> Yes.</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> Owing to the efforts of the Casters, I am barely able to speak.</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> The curtains have fallen all too soon. I apologize for that.</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> It is safe to say, from the presence of the Yellow Turban puppet soldiers, that Zhang Jiao lives.</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> A mistake on the Via Regia Realm&#39;s part,</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> or perhaps... he&#39;s the type of Servant who has taken measures to ensure death is but a mere inconvenience.</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> Either way, I had planned to take advantage of that, but the tables were turned on me.</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> ...I was struck by an Archer&#39;s arrow.</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> It is unheard of for an arrow to cover such a large distance yet retain such immense power.</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> Either some myth steeped in Mystery, or a fearsome legend carved into history.</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> Or perhaps other factors are at play. Either way, I want you to exercise caution.</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> —Now then, let&#39;s talk about what comes next.</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> You have two options. One is to capitulate to the Revenge Realm.</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> Though it may gall you to join those whom you have been warring against until now...</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> This is, I suppose, the fate of war. Or of heroes.</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> The other is to head for the Via Regia Realm. I wouldn&#39;t recommend that.</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> They are, as you all know, from Pan-Human History.</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> Nonetheless—</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> Just say it, Constantine!</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> Cut out the lies already, for goodness sake!</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> Joan is a Servant from Pan-Human History.</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> ...That&#39;s right, I could not allow her to remain a fantasy.</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> The rebellion against Pan-Human History is entirely dedicated to her restoration.</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> It was all a fabrication birthed from my selfishness and egotism.</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> If these lies of mine enrage you, and you head for the Revenge Realm, so be it.</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> But you cannot stay here. And...it&#39;s not because I&#39;m dying, or anything like that.</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> I created this realm. It is a realm that I created, cherished, and led.</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> My final request will be a selfish one. I want this Realm to perish with me.</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> ...Good grief, you sure move fast, Kriemhild.</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> Head for the Via Regia Realm, Joan.</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> No!</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> Hah, I figured you&#39;d say that. But that won&#39;t do.</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> Bradamante, can I leave this to you?</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> —Is this really okay?</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> It is in the nature of my summoning for me to deny Pan-Human History.</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> And yet it is Pan-Human History that I must now rely on. One damnable contradiction.</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> But you&#39;ve long since accepted that contradiction, haven&#39;t you, Bradamante?</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> At least, ever since the real Charlemagne showed up.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> —Yes.</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> Then, I take it you understand what needs to be done?</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> Of course. ...Bradamante hereby begs your pardon, Lady Joan!</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> W-wait, Brad, you brute!</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> Brutamante will carry you now!</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> Your Lordship!</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> Yes?</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> Farewell, and may fortune smile upon the path you walk.</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> Yours too, Paladin of Charlemagne. Take care of Joan.</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> She&#39;s a stubborn one, that girl.</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> I can&#39;t let that slide!</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> Let go of me, Bradamante! No! No! I don&#39;t want this to be goodbye...!</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> Joan.</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> ...!</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> —It&#39;s been fun. Goodbye.</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> You idiot! I had way, way more fun!</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> Is that so? Well, I&#39;m honored!</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> ...So that is how it is, you lot should choose your own path too.</p><p><strong>Caster Class:</strong><br> Begging your pardon, O Emperor.</p><p><strong>Caster Class:</strong><br> But we, too, are rather fond of the Restoration Realm.</p><p><strong>Saber Class:</strong><br> Though it is a surprise...or perhaps not quite, that our pope was on the side of Pan-Human History.</p><p><strong>Saber Class:</strong><br> Well, not that it matters either way.</p><p><strong>Saber Class:</strong><br> We&#39;ve fallen for you as hard as you have fallen for Pope Joan, Your Lordship.</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> I see. Looks like you&#39;ve been deceived by an unscrupulous man.</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> This is the second time that I&#39;ve been besieged in a falling castle.</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> And on the verge of death too...</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> If that does not deter you, then follow me down into the depths of hell, you fools!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> —So it falls.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> The Revenge Realm, not letting this opportunity pass, readily dispatches its assembled forces.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> The crumbling Bounded Fields were torn apart by the Noble Phantasms of Servants, and Noble Phantasms poised to replace them were pushed back by even greater numbers of Noble Phantasms.</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> You need not leave them time to surrender. Give them no quarter.</p><p><strong>Zhang Jiao:</strong><br> Would that not—cause enemy resistance to intensify?</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> Yes, in a conventional war. But this war is anything but conventional.</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> Heroes who have made up their minds will never budge, whether we slaughter them all or give them free rein to surrender.</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> Is that not so?</p><p><strong>Zhang Jiao:</strong><br> ...So it is.</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> Which is why the answer is to overrun and massacre them. As befits the Restoration Realm.</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> Their unsightly dreams will rot away in vain. For that is the path they have chosen to walk.</p><p><strong>Zhang Jiao:</strong><br> Although I doubt they themselves consider them the least bit unsightly.</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> I&#39;m sure they don&#39;t. That&#39;s the troubling part.</p><p><strong>Saber Class:</strong><br> When all is said and done, even when on the verge of death, we still draw breath.</p><p><strong>Saber Class:</strong><br> Is this our destiny?</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> ...Perhaps...</p><p><strong>Saber Class:</strong><br> Killed that guy, and I&#39;ve now reached my limit. Your Lordship, forgive me for taking my leave!</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> Right. So long.</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> Phew... so this is the end of the road for me, then.</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> Still, to think I&#39;d meet the same end as I did in life.</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> Am I cursed? Is that it?</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> Well, it&#39;s been nice knowing you, Your Emperorship.</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> Yeah. I thought this summoning was just the worst, but I&#39;ll try being a little more optimistic.</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> Without ever giving up, just like you wouldn&#39;t!</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> ...Well, if it lead to that meeting, my curse wasn&#39;t so bad.</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> Should this Singularity disappear, you will surely disappear with it.</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> These memories, these feelings, all of them would be swept away.</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> Which is to say, no other “me” would harbor any feelings for that girl in this Singularity.</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> ...I like the sound of that. That&#39;s how a second life should go.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I can hardly breathe. Yet my sword, my armor, my flag–all of those are what makes me an emperor.</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> ...Let&#39;s go!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> There is not a moment in life as vexing and as delightful as this.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I simply slay the enemy before me. I push ever forward.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Both my retainers and my banners have disappeared, my armor is broken, and my sword has shattered.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Even so, I push ever forward. And then, I realize.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> —A barren field lies before my eyes.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> A place I had never reached in my lifetime, a place I will surely never again reach.</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong><br> Oh, so this—is what lies out there.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Constantine laughed.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Constantine disappeared.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> 2,238 Servants remained of the Restoration Realm&#39;s forces.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> They fought unfalteringly against the Revenge Realm to the last man, harboring no regrets. And they were all annihilated.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> On the other hand, there were 542 Servants who wished to defect from the Restoration Realm to the Via Regia Realm.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> These were the Servants who adored Joan, and understood her feelings.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> For there resides a human from Pan-Human History.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> They must ask this of [♂ him /♀️ her]: What are your thoughts on this phantasmal girl?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Such was the duty, the mission, of these survivors.</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> I&#39;m beat...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Are you all right, Kadoc?</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Yeah, I am.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> You know how I&#39;ve been keeping my magecraft usage down to a minimum to avoid detection?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes, I can only pick up an exceedingly faint trace of magical energy myself.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> I have a backache, no thanks to that. Damn it, I suppose I should&#39;ve used at least a little.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It would&#39;ve been better if we had a Mystic Code supporting you, just like Senpai does.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Nah, I&#39;ll pass. That&#39;d just invite more unnecessary suspicion.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Would it?</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Well, I just have to put up with it for a while.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> But—</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Mash? Is this because we&#39;ve entered the Revenge Realm...?</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> No, not at all. It&#39;s probably because I&#39;m present.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> ...Moriarty...!</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Pardon me, I&#39;ll fix it for you.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> James Moriarty...!</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Oh, perfect timing. Mash Kyrielight.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> I&#39;d appreciate if you kept my presence here a secret from Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> And of course, from Sir Sherlock as well.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I couldn&#39;t possibly—</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Which would you prefer?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Excuse me?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Forcibly releasing Kadoc&#39;s collar? Or its outright activation?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Personally speaking, I don&#39;t mind either way.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...!</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Mash, what are you hesitating for? You should have the authority to do this.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Activate the collar. Do it now.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> —I absolutely refuse!</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Hey, listen here.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> This guy&#39;s an Apostle of the Alien World.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Whatever he&#39;s scheming, neither of us are in for a good time.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> He absolutely can&#39;t stand being left in the dark. He mustn&#39;t be able to extract any information from me.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> So kill me now. It&#39;s for the best.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I refuse.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Mash.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I said that I refuse!</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Mm, that was some excellent comedy. Almost worthy of a standing ovation.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Let me assure you.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> I have no intention of harming you, nor do I have any intention of extracting any information out of you.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Besides...</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> I was already aware of matters concerning you since the moment I became an Apostle of the Alien World.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> On the contrary, I am in the position where I need fear you stealing information from me.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> —Really?</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> (...He&#39;s right, that&#39;s for sure. Even if there&#39;s more to Chaldea than meets the eye...)</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> (It still doesn&#39;t change the fact that we&#39;re constantly in danger, and still have no information on this guy.)</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> (With the exception of Koyanskaya, who was... not an Apostle of the Alien God...)</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> (...both Muramasa and Limbo were High Servants who had some kind of Divine Spirit incorporated into them.)</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> (This guy isn&#39;t just Moriarty. The problem is who else he is.)</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> —Good, that&#39;s the look.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> What?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Seemingly servile yet brazen. Seemingly self-deprecating yet confident.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> That&#39;s the look of a wolf stalking its prey.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> ... ...</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Oh dear, has my use of “wolf” hit a sore spot?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Let me guess, considering the sort of magecraft you use, a dog was the name they mocked you by?</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> ...You make me sick!</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Hmm? What&#39;s this all of a sudden?</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> You don&#39;t normally figure out that much in just an instant, do you!? I feel like I&#39;ve just been dissected...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I presume that means he was spot on.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Now that you mention it, Beryl Gut would often bark at Kadoc...</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Mash, you&#39;re really not helping here...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Oh, no, no, I&#39;m so sorry!</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Hahahahaha! Delightful, how delightful!</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Now then, putting that aside. You came here because Zhang Jiao&#39;s fortress has been on your mind, hasn&#39;t it?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> The same is true for me.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Having said that, it&#39;s Revenge Realm territory past this point.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> You won&#39;t have an easy time going at it alone. So, why don&#39;t we work together here?</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Fine by me.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Wow, a prompt reply.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> A-Are you sure about this, Kadoc?</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> If he wanted me dead, he&#39;d have already done it.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Like he said so earlier, there isn&#39;t much information he can glean from me.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Vital information on Chaldea has been withheld from me too.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> For example, I haven&#39;t the faintest idea of the Storm Border&#39;s layout.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> It&#39;s likely that this guy already knows pretty much everything I do about Chaldea,</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> so we should aim to get all the information we can from him.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Oh my, do you believe yourself capable of this?</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> I don&#39;t know. And I won&#39;t know unless I give it a try.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Ah yes, just like how you tried to slaughter all of Chaldea&#39;s personnel.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Straight for the jugular, huh.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Indeed.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> I don&#39;t really have a problem with that.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> A sin is a sin, I&#39;ll accept punishment for it as soon as we resolve this situation.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Until then, it&#39;s in my interest to cooperate. I&#39;ll give it my all so I can lessen said punishment as much as I can.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Hmm, I see. That is logically sound.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> But does this not weigh on your conscience?</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> ...I&#39;m not obligated to answer that. Besides, if we&#39;re to talk, you&#39;ll eventually figure it out anyway.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> That is, if you&#39;re confident that you can.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Yet another good point made! ...Very well then, in that case.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> A handshake? I&#39;ll pass. Wouldn&#39;t want you infecting me with your villainy.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Hmm, I&#39;m starting to like you more and more!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> A-Are you sure about this...?</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> I don&#39;t know. We&#39;re in uncharted territory now.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> ...Well, whatever will be, will be.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It does feel like you&#39;re desperate here, Kadoc...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> But I understand. I will keep this liaison a secret from the others.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Please give me a moment while I change to another console.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Incidentally, Kadoc, can you keep a cool head?</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> ...For the time being.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> I see. In that case, let&#39;s make that permanent.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> ...?</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> ...Whatever. Let&#39;s get a move on.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> I&#39;m sure that...Qimen Dunjia, if I recall correctly,</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> spell has dissipated, but we&#39;re better off safe than sorry.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Oh, you really think so?</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Huh?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Zhang Jiao was extremely fixated on the defense of that fortress. To the point he even left behind something akin to a copy of himself.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> And to the extent he hoodwinked it into thinking it was the real Zhang Jiao, and not an alter ego.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Strange, isn&#39;t it? And if it&#39;s strange, we should consider it abnormal.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> And if we consider it abnormal—</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> You&#39;ve got to be kidding me, they&#39;re still guarding the area?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> It&#39;s likely that the fortress will be repaired soon. So let&#39;s go and rid ourselves of it.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> On this occasion, I am your Servant, Kadoc Zemlupus.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> No thanks. I have only one Servant, now and forevermore.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> You fight however you want and I&#39;ll just support you as a mage, that&#39;s all.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> ...As you wish. Now then, shall we!?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Hello there, soldiers!</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> I must ask bit parts such as yourselves to exit posthaste.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> As this stage is mine to take!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> There we go.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> ...One hell of an absurd power you&#39;ve got there. Their attacks were all nullified... no, something about them was weird.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Such is trivial for an Apostle of the Alien World.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Yeah, I guess it would be.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> (Why is he showing me this? Is he that confident his abilities would never fail him?)</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> (He was neither evading nor blocking their attacks. Those attacks did reach him...)</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> (...but the damage associated with them did not register. Not even on his clothes.)</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> (I feel like this matter is more serious than any damage he may have dealt to the enemy...)</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> (Who or what exactly...is this guy fused with?)</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Hahaha.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> You won&#39;t be figuring it out from just this much, and it wouldn&#39;t help you much even if you did.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Having said that, it&#39;d be a bother if Zhang Jiao does get here. So let&#39;s be on the hunt before he does.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> ...You&#39;ve got a point.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> In that case, I&#39;ll help you search.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Hahaha, how does betrayal feel, Mash Kyrielight?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> No comment. I am not at liberty to speak with a wicked professor.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> What have I done to deserve this hatred...</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> That&#39;s a line reserved for those with a likeable side to them, Moriarty.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> And the coup de grâce.</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> I&#39;ll be damned, they really paid attention to their security detail.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Well, this shouldn&#39;t be a surprise, but...</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> I&#39;m impressed you opened a door with such a complicated mechanism that easily.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> You were able to instantly deduce the correct combination from 6.4 quintillion possible permutations.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> That&#39;s because I&#39;m astoundingly phenomenal.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> I mean, that&#39;s a given. But you were so fast that it almost felt like you were cheating.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Well, yes!</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Whatever, it doesn&#39;t matter as long as it&#39;s open. Let&#39;s go, Moriarty.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Or perhaps we should all go &#39;Hip-Hip-Hurrah!&#39;?</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Only Fujimaru would play along with that.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That is true...</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> It can&#39;t be helped, then.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> ...Do you know what&#39;s down here?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> There are things even I don&#39;t know. And this is one of them.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> That said, if Zhang Jiao has kept it a secret from Kriemhild, that pretty much narrows it down.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Is that so?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Whoops, we&#39;ve got wyverns...not really, but a Soul Eater instead...but not really either.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Quite the tough Demonic Beast we have here. What do you think, Kadoc?</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> That I&#39;m glad that you&#39;re here with us, for now.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> To think the security would be this tight...</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> First of all, let&#39;s squash it, shall we? With mathematical precision!</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> What does squashing something mathematically even mean?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> It means that we&#39;ll settle this within 30 seconds!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Don&#39;t just multiply yourself without warning, that&#39;s scary.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Hahaha! I merely wanted to demonstrate that nothing is impossible for an Apostle of the Alien World!</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> And you recombined without a hitch. Are the Apostles of the Alien World all eccentrics or something?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> That...shouldn&#39;t be the case.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> You call that a confident answer!?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> More importantly, it looks as though we&#39;ve arrived.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Now what hero might come out from poking the golden nest?</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> ...!</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> My, so we did hit the jackpot.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Who is this?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> R-right. I know, his Saint Graph data has already been registered.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> This man is—!</p><p><strong>G：???:</strong><br> —I never thought I&#39;d be set free.</p><p><strong>G：???:</strong><br> I thought I was going to be put to sleep for eternity...</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> The great dragon-slaying hero, Siegfried. I had figured it was either him or Das Rheingold.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> I see. Now I understand what Zhang Jiao is trying to do.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> Zhang Jiao...I see, he&#39;s second-in-command of the Revenge Realm.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Umm...Siegfried, do you harbor any thoughts of rebellion against Pan-Human History?</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> None at all.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> I see, then please keep your distance from this guy for a while.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> He has the power to convert you to the other side.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> While I do have it, I won&#39;t use it. Because that variable wasn&#39;t accounted for in my fate.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> ...Fate?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Fate and calculations are one and the same.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Quantum mechanics may have ruled out Laplace&#39;s demon, but fate is still determined via calculation.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Yet another outdated notion.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Wouldn&#39;t you say the world of mages is what&#39;s truly outdated?</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> You got me there. So is that it?</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Things are proceeding according to plan. Is that what you want to say?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Correct.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> I&#39;m well aware of the pleasure that wielding power in the palm of your hand brings, but here&#39;s a warning.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Go on.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> It goes hand-in-hand with one&#39;s downfall.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>The man who would one day become the world&#39;s greatest criminal simply shrugged his shoulders at the young man&#39;s warning.</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> That man has departed... Who exactly was he?</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> I&#39;ll explain as we go along... By the way, Siegfried.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> Yes?</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> You&#39;re informed about the Revenge Realm. Does that mean you&#39;re also aware of who leads it?</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> ...Of course.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> She&#39;s—Kriemhild&#39;s your wife, right? Or at least that&#39;s how the legend goes.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> Yes, it&#39;s likely my wife, the same Kriemhild that I know.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> I&#39;m asking you if you can fight her.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> I can. I am a hero, and a Servant.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> This blade of mine shall not dull, not even if my wife is to be my enemy.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> I swear to fight to the utmost of my ability.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> ...S-Sure. You&#39;re sure dedicated. Almost too dedicated.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Siegfried is as earnest as ever, the same as he was in the First Singularity, in Orleans during the Hundred Years&#39; War.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> I see...</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> Then I shall abound with humor this time around.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> I can already tell from this short conversation that you don&#39;t have a knack for it. Sorry, man.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> Is that so...?</p><p><strong>Saber Class:</strong><br> Queen Kriemhild. Here is the Holy Grail.</p><p><strong>Saber Class:</strong><br> It manifested concurrently with Constantine&#39;s disappearance.</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> Well done.</p><p><strong>Saber Class:</strong><br> Oooh... I can feel my Saint Graph growing stronger...!</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> As for the half-ruined Via Regia Realm, it&#39;s essentially a foregone conclusion.</p><p><strong>Royal Guard:</strong><br> Hail! All hail Queen Kriemhild!</p><p><strong>Royal Guard:</strong><br> Our revenge is at hand!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Cheer after cheer arose. For the end of the Via Regia Realm was in sight.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> In other words, the unification of the three realms is on the horizon. The soldiers cheered ceaselessly.</p><p><strong>Zhang Jiao:</strong><br> I suppose I shall go and get some fresh air.</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> ...Hmph, suit yourself.</p><p><strong>Zhang Jiao:</strong><br> So they&#39;ve taken Siegfried...</p><p><strong>Zhang Jiao:</strong><br> Damn you, Pan-Human History. Why would you go back to scour a place you&#39;ve already searched?</p><p><strong>Caster Class:</strong><br> Lord Zhang Jiao, Queen Kriemhild requests your presence.</p><p><strong>Zhang Jiao:</strong><br> ...? Then why did she say “suit yourself” just now?</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> Did you just mention Siegfried?</p><p><strong>Zhang Jiao:</strong><br> Oho, so you overheard.</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> It matters not whether I heard you or not. I see all that goes on within this realm as long as it pertains to him, even your innermost thoughts.</p><p><strong>Zhang Jiao:</strong><br> I see. As one would expect.</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> You knew I would pick up on this, didn&#39;t you?</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> After all, I had worked my tricks on the Bounded Field.</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> Even if the Orient and the Occident differ in their styles, a certain degree of understanding is possible as long as the outcome they achieve is the same.</p><p><strong>Zhang Jiao:</strong><br> Indeed it is.</p><p><strong>Zhang Jiao:</strong><br> So I did try to not think about Siegfried while I was here.</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> You should have sealed the memories of your wrongdoing. So, what&#39;s your excuse?</p><p><strong>Zhang Jiao:</strong><br> ...That man would have been a problem, whether he sided with or against us.</p><p><strong>Zhang Jiao:</strong><br> You cannot afford to be agitated. For you are the linchpin of the Revenge Realm.</p><p><strong>Zhang Jiao:</strong><br> Even the Restoration Realm suffered a total collapse when Constantine broke.</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> This is where our opinions differ, Zhang Jiao. I have been waiting for him.</p><p><strong>Zhang Jiao:</strong><br> As his wife?</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> No, he is not my husband. He&#39;s merely leftovers.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>She smiles with a ferocious, wolfish smile.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>The smile of a bloodsoaked monster, one that no fair maiden should ever have.</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> Were you not aware, Zhang Jiao?</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> I have more right than anyone else in the world to exact revenge on him.</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> Yes, that much is certain.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> —It all began in a country known as Burgundy.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Kriemhild watched it from a window.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Those childlike warriors wavering between joy and apprehension as they struck with spears and stone.</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> Is he really that strong?</p><p><strong>Lady-in-Waiting:</strong><br> Who might you be referring to?</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> The barbarian from Niederland.</p><p><strong>Lady-in-Waiting:</strong><br> Oh, you mean Lord Siegfried!</p><p><strong>Lady-in-Waiting:</strong><br> The invincible hero who bathed in dragon&#39;s blood, wielding the Holy and Demonic Sword, Balmung!</p><p><strong>Lady-in-Waiting:</strong><br> And he&#39;s so handsome, it feels like I&#39;m in heaven!</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> ...Is that so? Looks like he&#39;s got everything going for him.</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> No, there is one thing he lacks. A decent personality.</p><p><strong>Lady-in-Waiting:</strong><br> Princess...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> And so I would finally meet him a year later.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> ...In hindsight, I wonder if that was love, obsession, or something else entirely.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> This inescapable madness (I will not forgive Hagen), guilt (Was it my fault?),</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> and sorrow (He was murdered).</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I cannot recall a thing.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> When Siegfried perished at the spring, pierced through his only weakness, my heart died with him.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> It did not take long before my grief turned to hate.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> But what overwhelmed me the most was what Hagen had to say.</p><p><strong>Hagen:</strong><br> In the end, you never understood a thing.</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> About what?</p><p><strong>Hagen:</strong><br> I took him down with a stab to the back, ending the feuding.</p><p><strong>Hagen:</strong><br> That was the promise I made with Siegfried. It was his idea.</p><p><strong>Hagen:</strong><br> How very...valiant of your hero, wasn&#39;t it?</p><p><strong>Hagen:</strong><br> But as you can see, the tragedies beget more tragedies.</p><p><strong>Hagen:</strong><br> What he did! What I did!</p><p><strong>Hagen:</strong><br> It was all in vain! You are to blame for that, Kriemhild!</p><p><strong>Hagen:</strong><br> You should&#39;ve just stayed put, and not thought about revenge!</p><p><strong>Hagen:</strong><br> For what reason did we even—!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> ...I don&#39;t remember much of what happened after that.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> But according to the records, someone denounced me horribly and slashed me while I stood in a daze.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Not that it matters, I had no intention of living on there.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> My sole regret—was that unbearable confession.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I see, I see, so that&#39;s how it was? This fury, this hatred, all of it...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> It&#39;s all your fault.</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> Did I not tell you? I have been waiting for him.</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> My passion was insufficient, and his love was fake. Hate is the only emotion that he and I can give one another.</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> But what I find most detestable... is how that man will undoubtedly...</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> ...No matter. If she has declared rebellion against Pan-Human History,</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> I must fight her.</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> ...try to kill me.</p><h2 id="section-18-the-pope-galvanizes" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-18-the-pope-galvanizes" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 18: The Pope Galvanizes</h2><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> —Via Regia Realm, Throne room.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Umm...</p><hr><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> Hmm?

So break a leg!</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> Oh... t-thank you...</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> I see, so that&#39;s Charlemagne...</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> It takes a lot to make my Brad blush.

You are acting like street thugs here.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Anyone who found this attitude funny should be ashamed.</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> Ahem.</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> Tch, I&#39;m sooo sorry.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> ... ...</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> Lady Joan, try to sugarcoat your feelings a little more. Think of yourself as a sweet sticky donut.</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> Donut tell me what to do!</p><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> Hey, things are going to get dicey if we don&#39;t get this show going soon.</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> What are you implying?</p><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> Their Lancer and our Roland missed the stopping point, now they&#39;re at their wits&#39; end and looking mighty awkward.</p><p><strong>Both:</strong><br> If you get it, then hurry it up!</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> Oh, right... They wanted someone to quickly cut them off...</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> All right, let&#39;s do this! Now it&#39;s time to rumble! Let&#39;s communicate with our fists, baby!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> W-We&#39;ve lost... I&#39;m sorry, Lady Joan...</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> It&#39;s fine, that felt refreshing... I mean, that felt purifying. Yeah, purifying.</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> We lost.

Don&#39;t! Read! Someone&#39;s mindset! So accurately!</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> My apologies, one of my components happens to be Rocinante, you see.</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> A human heart is what I&#39;m rather lacking in.</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> I think there&#39;s more than enough of that to go around though...</p><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> Hmm.. this is complicated. What to do?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Your Holiness.</p><hr><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> Y-Yes!</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> I mean, what might the matter be?</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> O Master of Pan-Human History, Fujimaru.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> It&#39;s okay that you harbor animosity towards us,</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> but please help us.</p><hr><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> ... ...</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> ...Very well. If it is within my means to do so.</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> Mister Holmes, is this your handiwork?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Handiwork?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Hmm, did I teach [♂ him /♀️ her] to respond in a way that exploits your greatest weakness...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Is that what you mean to say? Because you would be wrong.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> [♂ Mister /♀️ Miss] Fujimaru spoke those words of [♂ his /♀️ her] own volition, straight from the heart.</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> Seriously?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Quite serious.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> This...may not be much of a deduction. But let us put the obvious facts out there.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Pope Joan. You are firm against that which is strong.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> You never cower before heroes and luminaries. For you already harbored rebellious thoughts towards Pan-Human History from the start.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> But you are most vulnerable to the pleas of the weak. For you are the Pope!</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> You who wield your vaunted love as your strength, champion of the faithful flock, the powerless masses!</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Which is why... you will never ignore the pleas of the weak.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Even if the weak are not fervent believers.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Your love would never allow you to do so. —O proud Pope Joan, am I mistaken?</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> ...Fine. I get it, I&#39;ll be your flagbearer, or whatever!</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> But in exchange, don&#39;t use the people of my realm as bait or anything!</p><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> Of course not.</p><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> I, Charlemagne, assure you that we shall do no such underhanded thing.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Hmm. Karl der Große and Pope Joan.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> The two of them should suffice as the flagbearers of those who would side with Pan-Human History.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> ...Please do not look so displeased, Pope Joan.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Our history can, at times, be one of romance.</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> Yes, yes, I get it.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> But even so, we have 1,005 combatants with us. The Revenge Realm is estimated to have approximately 12,000.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> The percentage of Heroic Spirit-grade among them should be higher than ours too.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Being outnumbered tenfold, we need a plan to turn the tables. Having said that, our options are very limited.</p><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> Most good measures we can take won&#39;t work unless we have more troops.</p><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> There&#39;s pretty much only one thing we can do.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Indeed.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Have our elite forces charge in and take Kriemhild&#39;s head.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Our remaining Servants will serve as the rear guard and concentrate their efforts on preventing pursuit.</p><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> Which means Astolfo, Roland, Holmes, Bradamante, Diarmuid, and I will be on the front lines...</p><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> And the idea is to have us charge in.</p><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> Fujimaru, you will, of course, be out and about on the front lines too, okay?</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> A moment please! I-I too wish to be on the front lines!</p><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> No, Don Quixote. You will be with the middle guard.</p><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> It is likely that even our most elite forces...</p><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> will be unable to hold out against the sheer quantity of enemy soldiers swarming upon them.</p><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> In other words, they&#39;ll die. We&#39;ll be lucky if there&#39;s even one survivor.</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> —</p><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> Which is why, Don Quixote de la Mancha, when that time comes.</p><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> We will need your power, knight-errant. You will be our new vanguard.</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> I am deeply honored!</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> Ugh... Your grace...</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> No, Sancho.</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> As a Servant, this is a battle we must join.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> In any case, the odds aren&#39;t looking too good...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I&#39;m sorry to have kept you waiting! Kadoc is back!</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Oh, that was rather fast... Any success?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Please allow me to make a slight correction to what you just said.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Charlemagne said that we would be lucky to have even one survivor...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> But with this person here, I believe we&#39;d be looking at a different story!</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> I&#39;m wiped...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Welcome back!</p><hr><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Did you find someone, Kadoc?</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Yeah. Come on in.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> My name is Siegfried. I shall be joining the Via Regia Realm and Restoration Realm alliance.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> This body of mine, bathed in dragon&#39;s blood, is armor of invincible steel.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> If it&#39;s not too much trouble, I would like to be your vanguard.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Holy crap—!!?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Astolfo was first to speak what was on everyone&#39;s minds.</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Siegfried...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> I see. No wonder Zhang Jiao had him sealed away.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> He truly is the ultimate trigger for Kriemhild.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Irrespective of whether he is with or against her, her mind will undoubtedly fall into significant disarray.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> However...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Kadoc, did you really make contact with Moriarty?</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Yeah.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> No Caster can conjure an illusion that faithful.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> I was confident he was the real deal.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> I see—and did he mention anything else?</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Mash should have the conversation logged.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes, about that, I checked a while ago...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> And it appears that all conversational data from when Kadoc met Moriarty onwards has been irretrievably destroyed.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> This, of course, includes visual data as well. What an inexcusable baddie bad professor.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> (A baddie bad professor... does Miss Kyrielight also know of a goody two shoes professor?)</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> —Ahem. No doubt to deny me of any clues.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> What I said earlier was the entirety of our conversation.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Can&#39;t you sniff out any clues from that?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Yes, I should be able to—</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> ...But it&#39;s no good.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Unlike the slump I faced in Olympus, its effect on my Saint Graph is not as all-encompassing.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> But my reasoning always gets thrown into disorder when it comes to this particular Moriarty.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Under normal circumstances, I am the one who triumphs over him.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> I once fought him, my greatest rival, and we both fell into the Reichenbach Falls.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> In truth, it was a mutual kill. But you could still say victory was mine nonetheless.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> ...I survived, after all. Both in the novels and in the reality of human history.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The return of Holmes... from The Great Hiatus. In The Adventure of the Empty House!</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> But... I just can&#39;t seem to ascertain a path to victory this time around.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Perhaps it&#39;s because he&#39;s an Apostle of the Alien World, as I had feared. Or perhaps—</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Perhaps what?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> I may not be able to win, no matter what happens.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> ... ...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> ...In any case, let us focus on Kriemhild first.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Now that she holds two Holy Grails, she is undoubtedly the biggest threat.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I&#39;m here, Charlemagne.</p><hr><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> Good, you made it. Well, come have a seat over here.</p><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> A little more over to the corner. There you go.</p><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> Oh, did you bring the blanket like I asked you? The stone floor gets cold when you sit on it.</p><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> Now, hide here and watch.</p><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> As for whether there&#39;s meaning in it or not, I&#39;d lean towards the latter.</p><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> But you probably want to know...</p><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> And despite what it looks like, the truth is that she wants to open up too.</p><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> I can&#39;t leave this to the others. I&#39;m probably the only one who can get her to talk.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...I&#39;m counting on you.</p><hr><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> Okay.</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> ...What business do you have with me?</p><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> Hey there.</p><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> I mean, there&#39;s something I want to talk about.</p><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> I&#39;ve made the same pitch to the others, but you joined later, so I still have to make the rounds.</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> Oh-kay...</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> Not that I mind, but what might the matter be?</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> We&#39;ve already established our alliance, and all I have to do is pray in the middle guard.</p><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> Whoa, you&#39;ve sure got an attitude.</p><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> ...Still, isn&#39;t it better to let your feelings out before the battle at least?</p><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> Surely you&#39;ve got a ton of them. Like fury, or fury, or...fury.</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> You&#39;ve only listed fury, you jerk.</p><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> It would be uncouth for me to list any others.</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> I wouldn&#39;t be having any trouble if I could do that.</p><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> But there&#39;s no one else around.</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> You are around, Charlemagne. O great Father of Europe.</p><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> Oh, that&#39;s a half-truth.</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> ...Huh?</p><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> It was actually the other Karl der Große who achieved the great accomplishment of being titled the Father of Europe.</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> The... other...?</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> In other words, you&#39;re... um, the accumulation of the remaining legends.</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> An existence akin to a fantasy, so to speak?</p><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> Yes, that&#39;s right. Much like you.</p><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> Well, I might be worse off in a sense. After all, I&#39;m almost all fiction.</p><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> Truth be told, even summoning me as a Servant of Pan-Human History should be impossible.</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> Why?</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> Even different aspects of a Servant can be summoned.</p><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> Yet the achievements of the historical Karl der Große were too great for that.</p><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> He was a hero who was mundane until the very end, yet still reached the zenith.</p><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> Without any skyborne Demonic Beast, without any legendary Holy Sword,</p><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> he established Europe through political office and military warfare... that&#39;s how he was.</p><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> Simply put—there was no room for me to exist.</p><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> The Twelve Paladins are a different story though. To put in extreme terms, they&#39;ll exist just fine without me.</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> But is everyone not already familiar with your story?</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> As for me—I was accused of being an impostor.</p><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> Yes.</p><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> Frankly, with you being part of papal history, it was eventually bound to happen.</p><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> But you do understand how they view you, right?</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> That&#39;s—</p><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> There are those who would be saddened by your absence...</p><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> I doubt there are that many in Pan-Human History who would mock you as an impostor, no?</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> ... ...</p><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> You are not unwanted by Pan-Human History.</p><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> You&#39;re here because you were wanted—</p><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> You were wanted yet you didn&#39;t exist, which is why your legend remained, even when you were rejected.</p><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> If no one truly wanted you to be, even your legend itself would have disappeared.</p><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> Like a bubble.</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> Like a bubble, huh?</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> Constantine said as much too. That there is meaning in me remaining in history.</p><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> Oh, so you&#39;ve already heard that one.</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> But I just can&#39;t understand that.</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> How can you endure it, knowing that your life is nothing but a meaningless daydream?</p><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> Hmm...</p><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> I suppose it&#39;s because I swing my blade for the ones who believed in me being here.</p><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> Does it matter even if you remain on the Texture of reality or not? Who cares if someone thinks of you as nothing more than a fantasy?</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> Besides, I—harbored fury towards Pan-Human History and supported the rebellion.</p><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> The fact that you view it as a sin already means you&#39;re one of us.</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> ...I wonder if Constantine foresaw this happening.</p><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> I doubt he did. But...</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> But what?</p><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> I think he was fine with you choosing either side.</p><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> If you were to rebel against Pan-Human History, he would continue to rebel too.</p><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> If you accepted it nevertheless, he would have readily seen you off.</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> Why would he go that far—</p><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> Oh... it would be uncouth for me to say.</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> Really?</p><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> Yeah, well, you&#39;ll just have to ask Bradamante.</p><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> And you may be unable to cleanse yourself of this resentment and fury.</p><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> But that&#39;s okay.</p><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> In the first place, you&#39;re not the only one who&#39;s been angered by Pan-Human History.</p><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> ...And only the ones who can say the good outweighs the bad answer the summoning.</p><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> I&#39;d like you to look for something that makes all the bad worth it before you leave this land.</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> Very well. I will... give it some thought.</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> I will also ask Bradamante. Umm, you have my utmost gratitude.</p><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> You can just go with a “thank you”.</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> Thanks a bunch, crown boy!</p><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> Isn&#39;t that a little too friendly!?</p><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> Constantine... I wish I could&#39;ve had a nice chat with him.</p><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> And I&#39;m sorry I made you hide.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> She might not have opened up if I was there.</p><hr><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> Yes, exactly!</p><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> But you must&#39;ve been curious too about Joan&#39;s true feelings.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I&#39;ll do what I can to show her the good that outweighs the bad.</p><hr><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> Yeah, let&#39;s go for it!</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> I&#39;m sorry, Master, but there&#39;s something I&#39;d like to discuss with you.</p><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> Oh, it&#39;s Siegfried. It... doesn&#39;t seem like I ought to listen to this.</p><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> So, I&#39;ll be off now.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Thank you!</p><hr><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> Apparently, we once fought alongside one another.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> I apologize for not having any recollection of it. I only hope I was of use to you...</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> That aside, I have a request I&#39;d like to make.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> ... ...</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> Should I make this request, I...would have no right to complain even if I&#39;m killed for it.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Give me a second.</p><hr><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> ?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I&#39;ve just cut the comm to Chaldea.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> That should give you some time.</p><hr><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> I see. Now that you mention it, you are from Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> Most appreciated. So... I&#39;d like to ask a favor of you.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> That&#39;s—</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> (Lost for words)</p><hr><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> I am... truly sorry.</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> ...And that&#39;s the gist of it. Did you get it, Bradamante?</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> Huh?</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> Well, I mean, Lady Joan and Lord Constantine were—</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> Mutually in love, I believe.</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> ... ...</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong></p><h1 id="excuse-me" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#excuse-me" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Excuse me?</h1><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> Eh? Huh? ...Eh?</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> You&#39;ve got to be kidding me, don&#39;t tell me you actually didn&#39;t notice?</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> ...No, I mean... I never thought...it was...anything romantic...</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> More like friendship... or fondness... or familial love? Or maybe sympathy...</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> I think he loved you on top of all of that. Probably.</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> Sigh...</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> Oh, does that displease you?</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> But I still don&#39;t think Emperor Constantine would regret a thing.</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> I-I-I-I never said it displeased me! I didn&#39;t say a word of that sort!</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> I was just, you know, surprised.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> Is this really your first time?</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> I should have it in spades, but it seems I&#39;ve forgotten it.</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> You know how I&#39;m an impostor in the first place. Perhaps it never existed at all.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> Oh...</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> ...In other words... this ex-boyfriend (?) of mine who I don&#39;t even remember, is a two-dimensional man whose face I don&#39;t even know...</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> Let&#39;s stop.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> Let&#39;s not go there, you&#39;d only get endless darkness out of it.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> Isn&#39;t it better to consider him your first love?</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> It&#39;s kind of hard for me when you put it that way... but, oh.</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> I do feel kind of happy, which is why it&#39;s kind of sad.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> I think that&#39;s fine.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> His Lordship was probably the sort of person who could wish for the happiness of the one he loved.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> Either way, Lady Joan is—</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> No, as long as you feel happiness in your heart when you look back on this battle, Joan.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> That in itself should be the greatest of rewards for His Lordship.</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> That might be a tall order.</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> After all—his death still saddens me.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> ...That sadness is also an important feeling.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> It&#39;s only because you were happy in the first place that losing him brings you sadness.</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> Yes... you&#39;re right. Thank you, Bradamante.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> Don&#39;t mention it!</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> ... ...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> How can I help you, Holmes?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> I&#39;ve been... thinking about Moriarty&#39;s powers. But I lack sufficient material to make a deduction.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Would his ability that attempted to make Vlad rebel against Pan-Human History be a hint?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> I think so as well...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> But would he really give away a hint so carelessly when I was right in front of him?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> That in itself raises another suspicion. But that just might be what he&#39;s after.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> We&#39;re going in circles here...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> You should go and get some rest, Miss Kyrielight.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Considering Charlemagne&#39;s operational limit and other factors, we have only five hours to go until we depart.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Right. Then I&#39;ll be taking a short nap.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Good night, Holmes.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> What do you know about me, Moriarty?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> I know everything there is to know about you, Sherlock Holmes.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Though I remain unsure whether to hold you in respect or contempt.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> ...Now then, who will triumph in this battle?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Kriemhild, who seeks to exact revenge on Siegfried?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Or perhaps Chaldea... the Via Regia Realm which bears the noble cause of saving the world?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Not that it matters at this point either way... No, in this case,</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> I suppose Chaldea is preferable.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> For it would create a proper motive to defeat THE Sherlock Holmes.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> So save the world and then destroy it, good fellows.

Instead—</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> I will handle it.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> Even if the arrow is considerably powerful, my Noble Phantasm can withstand it.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> I will stand on the front lines focusing on defense with my swordsmanship.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> However, I will find it difficult to be on guard against the surrounding enemy troops.</p><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> About that—</p><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> Fujimaru and I, as well as the Twelve Paladins, will handle the front lines.</p><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> But, Astolfo.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Hm?</p><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> You&#39;re my secret anti-Archer plan.</p><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> You&#39;ll be on foot until we&#39;re halfway through, and once that Archer begins his assault—</p><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> Make sure you take him out.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> —As you command.

It was just as they had planned.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> The rest of the front line put some distance between them. This too, was just as they had planned.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> True Ether, released.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> A Holy Sword that is simultaneously a cursed Demonic Sword.

Do not let him use that Noble Phantasm...!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Of course, this would result in their death.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> The incoming arrow will surely obliterate the entire area indiscriminately, both friend and foe.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> However, it would also achieve victory at the cost of this small, paltry army.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> So that those downtrodden vanquished might finally grasp glory. So that those who lived a life of triumph may never forget the taste of glory.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Everyone tries to seize victory over their immediate lives.</p><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> Fujimaru!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Then it is up to [♂ him /♀️ her] to prevent it.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Summoning Servants on the borders of the space indicated by Siegfried.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> We&#39;ll finish them off posthaste...!</p><hr><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Azure sparks fly as sword and arrow clash. The very air warps and screams. Magical energy surges tempestuously.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> —Sure enough, there stands the dragon-slaying hero.</p><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> Amazing...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> No...injuries...</p><hr><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> Let us proceed. There should be some time until the next arrow.</p><p><strong>Caster Class:</strong><br> U-Unscathed... Damage...undetected...</p><p><strong>Caster Class:</strong><br> Impossible! This can&#39;t be!</p><p><strong>Caster Class:</strong><br> That arrow shot through even Constantine&#39;s walls!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> It is no wonder the Casters have turned pale. There are few capable of withstanding a hit from that arrow.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> It was the kind of projectile that the fragile bodies of humans have no hope of withstanding.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> —They were not informed.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> That the hero who has begun sprinting once more is the great hero spoken of in legends as the dragon-slayer.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> The man who bathed in dragon blood and attained an invincible body.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> When it comes to marching forward while on the defensive, no one else can hope to hold a candle to this hero.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> His name is Siegfried. His pale blade cleaves the vermilion sky.</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Tametomo:</strong><br> ...Deflected.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> It did not miss. It was deflected.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> First of all, that sword was unexpectedly sturdy.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> It is, without a doubt, a Noble Phantasm.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> It must be a Noble Phantasm derived from the Age of Gods at that, or a weapon whose name is carved into legend.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> However, the problem is what followed afterwards.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> The sword struck the arrow that was fired. That in itself was no surprise.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Yet it was with impeccable skill that he handled the energy of the arrow.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> That, on the other hand, was strange and abnormal.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Under normal circumstances, even if his sword halts the arrow, the absurd amount of magical energy infused into the arrow would have obliterated him.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> However, he withstood even that tempestuous magical energy.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> ...On the contrary, the injuries he sustained were too trivial to even be called minor wounds.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Needless to say, it must be some manner of Noble Phantasm. One that makes him sturdy or invincible.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> There are a plethora of defensive Noble Phantasms in existence, and Tametomo wasn&#39;t familar with them all.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> What he understood, though, was its sturdiness. So the problem lies in skill, as expected.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Repelling a bullet from a handgun with a sword is not impossible. But it is impossible to do the same with a missile.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Because even if it were repelled, it would be a meaningless act, since it would explode on the spot.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Swordsmanship is meaningless before an arrow capable of piercing the very earth.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Or so it should have been.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> —Correcting trajectory. Commencing recalculations.</p><p><strong>Caster Class:</strong><br> Hey... What are you doing...!?</p><p><strong>Caster Class:</strong><br> You only fire arrows at my command! Cease this, cease this at once!</p><p><strong>Caster Class:</strong><br> Tch. Activate the emergency shutdown system!</p><p><strong>Assassin Class:</strong><br> It...It&#39;s not working! System rejection, error!</p><p><strong>Caster Class:</strong><br> Huuuuh!?</p><p><strong>Caster Class:</strong><br> T-Then how!? That thing, Minamoto-no-Tametomo, is already...</p><p><strong>Assassin Class:</strong><br> Yes. He is capable of unassisted fire.</p><p><strong>Caster Class:</strong><br> C-Cut the supply! Cut the magical energy supply right now—</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Tametomo:</strong><br> I won&#39;t let you.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Tametomo:</strong><br> Noble Phantasm, initiated. Targeting the hero on the front lines. Tentative name: Dragon.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> It was a tentative name that was not based on anything in particular, yet that word encapsulated his true nature.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> The dragon-slayer is, simply put, a dragon himself. His fangs and sturdiness live up to his name.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> In that case, what should I do? In that case, in that case, in that case.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Tametomo:</strong><br> —Commencing bombardment.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>The arrow in his hands split into three.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>The magical energy supplied to him by the tower had been limited to one shot&#39;s worth so far...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>However, that limit was no more.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Tametomo:</strong><br> —Noble Phantasm, discharging.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>The Minamoto-no-Tametomo from this Singularity has no standard by which to tell good and evil apart, nor does he have the conviction he should otherwise have.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>He merely stands, shooting his arrows all the while.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>This sole fact drives him mad.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Tametomo:</strong><br> The Moonlight Cannon, Gouchin Yumiharizuki.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Tametomo:</strong><br> —Unbroken Threefold Salvo.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Even a single one of those arrows would have sufficed in bringing down a hero.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> And here there are three of them, carving a path through the bright-red sky, each following a deadly trajectory.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> Another one&#39;s incoming! Everyone, stay where you are!</p><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> It&#39;s fast...! Astolfo!</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> ...I&#39;ve got him! Your trusty Astolfo&#39;s gonna be breaking off now!</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Not sure if I&#39;m gonna make it back or not, so this is gonna have to be goodbye!</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Master of Chaldea, my king, and my fellow comrades from the Twelve Paladins!</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Farewell!</p><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> Sure, I&#39;m counting on you, Astolfo! I&#39;m really counting on you, so just don&#39;t screw up when it actually matters!</p><p><strong>Roland:</strong><br> We can only pray for the best, though I&#39;m worried!</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> Pull yourself together! Just focus and don&#39;t think anything stupid!</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Yeah, that&#39;s not something you say to a comrade who&#39;s marching to their death!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Best of luck, Astolfo!</p><hr><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Okay, victory shall be yours! Hippogriff!</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Saber! I mean, Siegfried! I&#39;m all ready!</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> ...There&#39;s the gleam! Target is 15.8 km away. Top floor of the tower!</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Roger!</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> The problem now is—this next shot.</p><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> I leave it to you, Fujimaru! Protect Siegfried one more time!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> So it&#39;s three consecutive shots this time...!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> He concluded immediately that completely blocking them was impossible.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Siegfried positioned himself such that he would at least avoid sustaining fatal injuries.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> It may have been a position that could only be described as an exceedingly half-hearted one.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> But it would be an exception in his case.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> (The first shot—)</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> “<ruby> Balmung<rt>Phantasmal Greatsword - Felling of the Sky Demon</rt></ruby>”. Activate, collide, neutralize.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> (The second shot—)</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Unfooled by the trajectory interwoven with feints, he swung the follow up swing of his sword and diverted the deadly trajectory.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> But that is all Siegfried was capable of doing. Even with skills such as his, two shots were all he could handle.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Thus, he had no choice but to weather the remaining third shot.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> It came with a slight delay after the first and second shots, due to following an even more complicated trajectory—</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> But the actions Siegfried could take were exceedingly limited.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Unable to deflect it with his blade, unable to evade it entirely. Unable to discard his blade and cross his arms to shield himself.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> It was all he could do to slightly shift his body. If that was all he could do, then the arrow was still bound to reach his Spiritual Core.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> It would only shift it by a few centimeters. It would still be enough to kill, considering its power.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Unless it was up against Siegfried.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> His aim was true. Minamoto-no-Tametomo&#39;s arrow struck Siegfried.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Struck by that legendary arrow said to have scuppered a ship with its destructive might,</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Siegfried was—</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Tametomo:</strong><br> —Life signs confirmed.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>He stood tall. Unable to avoid injuries, he was not entirely unharmed.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>Yet the hero glared back all the same, with his sword in hand.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>He could not believe it, he simply could not believe it. However, Tametomo finally realizes.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Tametomo:</strong><br> —Reduction.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> His Noble Phantasm is likely one that reduces the damage his body takes, irrespective of where said damage may be.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> It was as though his body was reassembled out of steel, or perhaps it was like a curse.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Nevertheless, Minamoto-no-Tametomo sought to uncover the weakness of this man—</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> and then he noticed that beast, flying towards him at the speed of sound.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Tametomo:</strong><br> Interceptive measures.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>Needless to say, Tametomo had focused his attention on intercepting it. This was well within expectations.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>Minamoto-no-Tametomo was not so foolish as to think there would be no reprisals after attacking twice.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>The skyborne Demonic Beast attacked at tremendous speeds.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>Its trajectory was exceedingly linear, one that exceedingly prioritizes speed.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>—That is to say, it has an ace up its sleeve.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>So Tametomo shot an arrow with no killing intent, whilst acting as though it were meant to kill.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> The Demonic Beast passed through the arrow without even a paltry attempt at evasion.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> It phased through the arrow that should have pierced it. And that was the end of Tametomo&#39;s analysis.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Tametomo:</strong><br> —Calculations finalized. Commencing bombardment.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>Of course, not even Tametomo could tell how much the Demonic Beast could phase through from that one act alone.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>Though one thing is certain, it cannot do so forever.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>For if that were the case, it would have merely needed to continue flying at him while phasing through attacks.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>There is a limit preventing it from doing so.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>It is either distance, or it is time. And regardless of which it is...</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Tametomo:</strong><br> No obstacles detected.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Accurate shots are fired, measuring distance and time in meters and seconds.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Soldiers lined up in an orderly manner commenced a fusillade. Even hiding in the reverse side of this dimension would not enable escape.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Three arrows pierced Astolfo.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Gah...!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> While those arrows may not have been Noble Phantasms, they carried enough destructive force to shred his body.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Although, of course, this is a situation he was prepared for.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Not yet!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>He races across the sky. Like a ray of light, he carves through the radiant sky.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>He fears not death, for this knight has always lacked such feelings.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>He fears not pain either.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>So all he fears is being incapable of carrying out his duty.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Endure, live, fight! It&#39;s all over if you die here, Astolfo!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Astolfo, after repeated dimensional shifts, finally closed in on Minamoto-no-Tametomo.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> This is it, Hippogriff!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Tametomo&#39;s arrow pierced the Hippogriff without phasing through it.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> I am Astolfo! One of the Twelve Paladins of Charlemagne!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> The Hippogriff falls. However, Astolfo has already left its back.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> The cavalryman, deprived of his wings, charges at Minamoto-no-Tametomo at a speed close to freefall.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Tametomo:</strong><br> —Reloading.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>And Tametomo responds, even in such a situation, with an unusual degree of calmness.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>He nocks his arrow, then shoots. His target is the Spiritual Core.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>And in response.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> All right, let&#39;s do this!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>Rather than the sword hanging at his waist, Astolfo held his Noble Phantasm, his lance, in his hands.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>This is no mere coincidence. Not that Astolfo had thought it up, of course.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> —The Archer who shot Constantine to death likely made use of that tower.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> The way that tower works is that it turns a Servant into a turret.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> In which case, it must come at a cost.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> In all likelihood, he or she will be rooted in place and will die should the supply from their legs be severed.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> The walls of Constantine cannot possibly be penetrated without paying a price that severe.</p><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> The supply from their legs...in that case, Astolfo, can&#39;t you use that?</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Use what?</p><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> I&#39;m talking about your Noble Phantasm, that lance. Well, that&#39;s settled then.</p><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> Siegfried will defend against any attacks made by this mysterious Archer.</p><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> And Astolfo will go on the offensive!</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> ...Oh, I see! I get it now, that Noble Phantasm!</p><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> Your Noble Phantasm, got it?</p><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> Should you finally manage to make your way to that bowman somehow,</p><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> use your Noble Phantasm!</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> —Will you be the one to vanquish that bowman?</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Yep!</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> I don&#39;t know if I can do it or not, but I&#39;ll do my best!</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> I see.</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> ...That bowman merely carried out his orders.</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> He must have been summoned and issued his orders, then he carried them out dispassionately.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Yeah...</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> —But even so,</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> I&#39;m really furious that someone I love was murdered!</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> Please avenge us! Would you be in need of a blessing or such!?</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> I&#39;ll take whatever I can get!</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> So it is. Well then,</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> “O mighty knight, please avenge us!”</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Oh, I will. I sure will.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> All right, I&#39;ll avenge you!</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Tametomo:</strong><br> ...What...!?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Purposefully inducing miracles.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Such is what the Holy Words of Joan do.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Astolfo laughs fearlessly, even with his heart pierced.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Down with a Touch—</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Tametomo:</strong><br> The next shot...!</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Trap of Argalia!</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Agh...!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> He could not move even an inch.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Even the Holy Word of the Pope could not change the fact that Tametomo&#39;s arrow had pierced his Spiritual Core.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> It has merely postponed the subsequent consequences by a short while.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> For just a fleeting moment, Astolfo was rendered unable to die.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> And that will suffice. All that&#39;s left now is to fulfill his duty as a Paladin.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> The lance wielded by Astolfo severs the magical energy supply from both legs.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> As Minamoto-no-Tametomo had been consuming a vast amount of magical energy drawn through the tower from the leyline,</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> this was tantamount to a fatal wound.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Tametomo:</strong><br> ... ...</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Tametomo:</strong><br> —Calculations unfeasible. —Supply suspended.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>He reached out to see if he was still capable of combat.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>—And realized he had no cause.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Tametomo:</strong><br> ...I suppose a life lived as a weapon needs be ended as one.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>This is what was expected of him on this occasion.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>In which case, a broken machine has no reason to move. It is humans who work miracles.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Tametomo:</strong><br> —A miracle, then?</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Yeah...no, I&#39;m about to die too.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Tametomo:</strong><br> I see. Nevertheless, be proud.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Tametomo:</strong><br> For you have vanquished Chinzei Hachiro —Minamoto-no-Tametomo.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Tametomo:</strong><br> Hold great pride in it, and spread the word far and wide.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> I&#39;m glad to hear that. But I cheated a bit this time.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> I&#39;ll hold pride in it when I beat you fair and square next time!</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Tametomo:</strong><br> Indeed, so that is how you see it? Then it is futile.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Tametomo:</strong><br> For next time, I shall triumph.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Hahaha! Just try if you can!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> The crimson sky ought to have been ominous, yet it was strangely beautiful.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> —Yeah, I&#39;m satisfied.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Tametomo:</strong><br> Mm.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> The two of them hail from different histories, different eras, different countries, and belong to different races. Differing in just about every aspect.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Yet, their thoughts were the same in their final moments.</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> ...The arrows...have stopped!</p><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> Good job, Astolfo! ...I&#39;ll have to reward him when he gets back!</p><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> Press on! Don&#39;t waste time!</p><p><strong>Roland:</strong><br> Reporting in! We are 100 meters out from the Revenge Realm&#39;s main gate!</p><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> Getting real close! We&#39;re almost there!</p><p><strong>Roland:</strong><br> According to a Caster&#39;s rough estimate, it can withstand at least five A rank, Anti-Army Noble Phantasms!</p><p><strong>Roland:</strong><br> Moreover, it&#39;s got reflective spells woven into it so a lackluster Noble Phantasm would only bounce back at us—</p><p><strong>Roland:</strong><br> Hence its name: Gate of Retribution!</p><p><strong>Roland:</strong><br> You know what that means!</p><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> What does it mean?</p><p><strong>Roland:</strong><br> This might be my last moment in the spotlight, Boss!</p><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> There you have it.</p><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> Master, hey Master! We might lose Roland here!</p><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> Please prep the backup!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...Got it!</p><hr><p><strong>Roland:</strong><br> Farewell, Master!</p><p><strong>Roland:</strong><br> Siding with Pan-Human History was absolutely the right call. You guys really were fun!</p><p><strong>Roland:</strong><br> Please give my regards to Gramps Quixote!</p><p><strong>Roland:</strong><br> Also to that really lovely girl from those transmissions!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You sure that&#39;s going to work!?</p><hr><p><strong>Roland:</strong><br> Of course I am. My Holy Sword is Durandal, passed down from Hector.</p><p><strong>Roland:</strong><br> The peerless sword that Mandricardo worked a miracle with. So!</p><p><strong>Roland:</strong><br> So! I will hereby! Prove that I am its true bearer!</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> Roland!</p><p><strong>Roland:</strong><br> Yeah!?</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> It may have been brief and it may have been a long time coming, but it was an honor to share the battlefield with you again!</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> It really was brief though!</p><p><strong>Roland:</strong><br> Thanks! And I&#39;ll have you know it&#39;s only brief because you went to the enemy side!</p><p><strong>Roland:</strong><br> Alrighty then...guess I&#39;ll go work some miracles!</p><p><strong>Caster Class:</strong><br> Reporting in! The Via Regia Restoration Alliance army has stopped 30 meters away from the gate!</p><p><strong>Caster Class:</strong><br> We assume that their lack of a means to open the main gate has slowed them down!</p><p><strong>Zhang Jiao:</strong><br> Very well. Instruct the Casters to stack their spells atop each other.</p><p><strong>Zhang Jiao:</strong><br> No matter the kind of spell, be it Eastern, Western, Middle Eastern, or South American.</p><p><strong>Caster Class:</strong><br> Is there a need to go this far?</p><p><strong>Caster Class:</strong><br> The main gate can withstand even multiple A-rank, Anti-Army Noble Phantasms!</p><p><strong>Caster Class:</strong><br> It even has a multitude of conceptual spells applied to it. Once closed, even we would find reopening it difficult.</p><p><strong>Zhang Jiao:</strong><br> That is the problem.</p><p><strong>Caster Class:</strong><br> Pardon me?</p><p><strong>Zhang Jiao:</strong><br> Gates are, after all, made to be opened. Not closed.</p><p><strong>Zhang Jiao:</strong><br> Should it be opened not with force, but through further conceptual means—</p><p><strong>Zhang Jiao:</strong><br> Should our efforts be easily rendered meaningless—</p><p><strong>Zhang Jiao:</strong><br> Then the Gate of Retribution might open readily.</p><p><strong>Roland:</strong><br> Sir Siegfried. I, Roland, will take over from here!</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> Understood, please do!</p><p><strong>Roland:</strong><br> O peerless blade, vestiges of great saints. I beseech thee to bring about yet another miracle for our army.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> The blade that Roland wields is Durandal.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Though it was the blade once wielded by the great Trojan hero Hector,</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> there is a single difference now than when Hector wielded it.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> The remains of saints embedded within its hilt imparted upon it another power separate from its use as a blade.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Namely, miracles.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Roland raised his blade to open the Gate of Retribution that not even the prayers of Joan could have opened.</p><p><strong>Roland:</strong><br> Open—Gate of Retribution!</p><p><strong>Zhang Jiao:</strong><br> Well, well, so that&#39;s Roland. The man famed as the mightiest of the Twelve Paladins.</p><p><strong>Zhang Jiao:</strong><br> Nonetheless, arrows appear to be effective against him.</p><p><strong>Archer Class:</strong><br> That&#39;s strange. They weren&#39;t effective before...</p><p><strong>Archer Class:</strong><br> Let&#39;s just say fortune favors us. Fire away, fire away!</p><p><strong>Zhang Jiao:</strong><br> The gate...isn&#39;t opening. I was worried something would happen, but it seems like I may have overthought it.</p><p><strong>Zhang Jiao:</strong><br> Good, the troops we&#39;ve deployed will soon coalesce and encircle them.</p><p><strong>Zhang Jiao:</strong><br> Then we exterminate them.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> ...!</p><p><strong>Roland:</strong></p><h1 id="stay-back" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#stay-back" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Stay back!</h1><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Hold on, Siegfried could...!</p><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> No. This is it for Roland.</p><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> You mustn&#39;t interfere. That&#39;s just how miracles work.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Isn&#39;t Roland supposed to be invincible...!?</p><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> That&#39;s right. He&#39;s invincible.</p><hr><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> An invincible being with a body like diamond.</p><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> That is who Roland of the Twelve Paladins of Charlemagne is. But invincible is all he is.</p><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> Invincibility doesn&#39;t open gates. So he discarded it.</p><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> No, discarded is not the right word. He offered it up.</p><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> Everything he had...to a miracle.</p><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> (But—not even this is good enough, is it? In that case, Siegfried and I have no choice but to use our Noble Phantasms.)</p><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> (We stand to lose much... Is there no other way...?)</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Roland will offer up everything he has to open the gate.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Charlemagne was only half-correct there.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> That was not all he had offered up.</p><p><strong>Roland:</strong><br> These arrows...really...do hurt...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>He laughs bitterly, coughing up blood as he states the obvious.</p><p><strong>Roland:</strong><br> But the gate should definitely open now...it should open...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> —It did not open. A miracle demanded more than he offered.</p><p><strong>Roland:</strong><br> No way...!</p><p><strong>Roland:</strong><br> Open up...open up...open up... Please work, miracle...!</p><p><strong>Roland:</strong><br> Please! Just this once, just this once, please make it in time!</p><p><strong>Roland:</strong><br> I beg you, I beg you...don&#39;t make me relive that bloody Battle of Roncevaux all over again!</p><p><strong>Roland:</strong><br> Don&#39;t mind me! I&#39;ve done my due! So please save my comrades!</p><p><strong>Roland:</strong><br> I would offer up my life for that!</p><p><strong>Roland:</strong><br> I will offer up anything I have that is mine to offer!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> —The Holy Sword heeded his prayer.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> To offer up everything.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> The main thing about miracles is that they have to be traded in exchange for something else.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> The Holy Sword is not enough. No relic, on its own, is enough.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Even his very life would fall just short of being enough.</p><p><strong>Roland:</strong><br> What else...what else... What else do I still have left to offer...!?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> —There is one other.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> A modest dream he had envisioned, unbeknownst to all.</p><p><strong>Roland:</strong><br> ...I&#39;ve got it!</p><p><strong>Roland:</strong><br> But is this really it?</p><p><strong>Roland:</strong><br> ... ...</p><p><strong>Roland:</strong><br> Yes, in a way...this is something more important to me than my own life.</p><p><strong>Roland:</strong><br> Hear me, gate! All my memories and records, I offer unto you!</p><p><strong>Roland:</strong><br> All of them, every last bit! Take all of me from the memories of others as well!</p><p><strong>Roland:</strong><br> I&#39;m fine with them never knowing who opened this gate, he who will die doing so!</p><p><strong>Roland:</strong><br> I shall even offer up the exultation of knowing the ones I fought alongside here!</p><p><strong>Roland:</strong><br> That&#39;s right, this pride need not carry over! It&#39;s okay!</p><p><strong>Roland:</strong><br> Even if none of them are to understand a thing!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> They forget. Why this gate opened and how it was opened.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> All is forgotten. Even the fact that he stood and fought on this battlefield.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Even Sherlock Holmes, who should have been able to assemble a record via reasoning, would fail to venture a guess.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> The same, of course, goes for Roland himself.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> For that is the price of a miracle.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Let there be a miracle...!!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> What stands here is but a concept that may or may not have been human.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> But the gate did begin to open.</p><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> Yes! The gate...it&#39;s starting to open up!</p><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> I don&#39;t know why it&#39;s opening, but we&#39;d better hurry!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Why is the gate suddenly...!?</p><hr><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> I&#39;m not sure, but now&#39;s not the time to be thinking about it.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> Come on, let&#39;s hurry!</p><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> All troops, move in!</p><p><strong>Zhang Jiao:</strong><br> Wha—Who opened the gate!?</p><p><strong>Archer Class:</strong><br> W-We don&#39;t know!

What are you doing!?</p><p><strong>Zhang Jiao:</strong><br> ...Fall back, back to the palace!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Not a soul could hamper the opening of the gate.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Not a soul could hinder he who had become the very “phenomenon” of a gate opening.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Until the gate has fully opened and closed,</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> this “phenomenon” will continue to perform miracles.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> And upon ensuring that the rearguard of the alliance made it in, the gate finally closed.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Nothing lies there. Who opened the gate, and how was it opened?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> For the human Master and the observers of Chaldea, the ones who ought to have remembered.

His thoughts simply turned to the death in front of him.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> The life of Kadoc was a dull one to begin with, in every aspect.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> A mage with hardly any history behind his name, in a family whose development of magecraft had lost all momentum.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> He was born into it with mediocre talent, falling short of being a wonder child.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> The fact that Chaldea took him in at all was a miracle in itself.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Then he died at Chaldea, was resurrected, became a Crypter, and then—</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> ...Well, it&#39;s been a good run.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I had a look at the records. I saw the records of the other Crypters who fought in their Lostbelts.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Ophelia Phamrsolone, who cast aside her Mystic Eye and wielded the Sirius Light to seal the flame of the apocalypse, Surtr.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Akuta Hinako...Yu Mei-ren, who sacrificed all she had for the one she loved.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Kirschtaria Wodime, who sought to uplift all of humanity to godhood and suffered betrayal at the hands of Beryl.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Scandinavia Peperoncino, who set off to the underworld, taking Beryl&#39;s power with him to the grave.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> And Beryl Gut, who failed to attain his dearest wish.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Daybit and I are the only Crypters left.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> And I was first to taste defeat. So the truth of it is that—</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> My fate had ended a long time ago. That&#39;s the feeling I get.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> (Well, there&#39;s nothing more I can do here.)</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Nothing I can do about this, nothing I can do about that. I feel like that phrase encapsulates my whole life.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> But there really is nothing I can do. I cannot possibly evade this blade swinging down on me.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> To top it off, my body had moved for some reason to shield Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Even though [♂ he /♀️ she] was my enemy, even though I hated [♂ him /♀️ her].</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> [♂ His /♀️ Her] life was still one that Ophelia and Peperoncino gave everything they had to preserve.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Truth be told, [♂ he /♀️ she] has far more potential than someone like me.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> This is my stop. ...nothing I can do about that.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Naturally, I won&#39;t let that happen.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> —Huh?</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Who are...wait, no. I know who you are...</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> There&#39;s nothing you can do about this. After all, she trusts me to fulfill her request.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> “Please keep Kadoc safe.”</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> ...!</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Oh, damn it. So I&#39;m still not allowed to sacrifice myself?</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Of course not.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> You may not grow old peacefully, but do try your best to stick around a little longer.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> That is what I—what she, my Anastasia—</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> wished for. It is what I, Viy, wish for as well. So please try your best, just a little further.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> I know you can do it. I&#39;m sure of it.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> That just now...</p><hr><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Yeah, that was my trump card.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I held my tears back. I was happy. And sad.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> That just now was merely the vestiges of an Elemental.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> It was mere coincidence that it so happened to take that form at the behest of its master, Anastasia, and come to my aid.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> After all, I have no heroic powers of my own. None at all.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Yet I strangely felt pride in this situation, one where I was protected. One that should have made me feel inadequate.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> That&#39;s right, Anastasia. Just like you were my Caster,</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I too am your Master.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Fujimaru, toss me an energy ampoule too.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> You saw what just happened, didn&#39;t you?</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> It&#39;s not exactly a Servant, but some of Viy&#39;s power still remains.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Basically, it means I&#39;m going to be backing you up. Got it?</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> All right, let&#39;s get this show on the road. We&#39;re going all out before the ice melts!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Agh...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Guh...!</p><hr><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> Are you two all right? We&#39;re fine, just a little further...!</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> I can see that! ...Damn it, there&#39;s still so many of them.</p><p><strong>C：???:</strong><br> Dear me, would you like to have the path cleared away?</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> !</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Damn it, this is just the worst...!</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> Hmph. That was rather rude of you.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Hmm? Have you jumped ship from the Restoration Realm to the Revenge Realm?</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> Surely you jest. I have no wish to call anyone who lies my lord.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> You there. Yes, you.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> Please answer me truthfully. Do you intend to destroy this Singularity?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...Yes, I do.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> (Nod silently)</p><hr><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> ...I see.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> I have no wish to help the deceitful Pan-Human History, but I see no issue with helping someone honest like you.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> I shall open up the path with my flames. It will lead you straight to the throne.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> Please rest assured, I will hold down the fort here. So please press forward.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> ...Why would you go this far?</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> ...Good question.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> I&#39;m afraid...I don&#39;t quite understand myself.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Thank you.</p><hr><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> You&#39;re very welcome.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> It would seem that I am happy enough just seeing you back on your feet once more.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> Huhuhu, I wonder why, huhuhuhuhu...!</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> ...I&#39;m not sure what&#39;s going on here, but you&#39;ve sure got it rough...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You think so?</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> I do think so! You&#39;ve got to get some self-awareness!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I guess so...</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Okay, as long as you get it. I think.</p><hr><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> ...All right, this place seems good enough. I&#39;ll join this Servant here in holding them back.</p><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> I&#39;ll leave the rest to you, Siegfried. Go and settle things with Kriemhild!</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> ... ...</p><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> Looking forward to working with you!</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> You strike me as someone who is all lies, hero.</p><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> I suppose so!</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> And snidery seems to fly over your head...well, I won&#39;t be wasting words on you.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> Do be careful not to get caught up in my flames.</p><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> All right, let&#39;s do this! Time to go wild!</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> You should really listen to what others have to say, you know?</p><p><strong>Zhang Jiao:</strong><br> The lucid yang ascends to form the heavens, the five elements manifest to establish the ten heavenly stems. I humbly pray as I devote to you—</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> (This incantation is...)</p><p><strong>Zhang Jiao:</strong><br> The divine host descends, Great Teacher— Defend yet remain by my side. Jí Jí Rú Lǜlìng!</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> (One would normally beseech a god Xian for protection, but he made his prayer treating himself as the god!)</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> (This is probably his trump card, and—)</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Miss Bradamante! Keep your distance from Zhang Jiao for the time being! Stay on the defensive!</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> G-Got it...!</p><p><strong>Zhang Jiao:</strong><br> Then I shall make my move.

What about it, you geezer!?</p><p><strong>Zhang Jiao:</strong><br> Oh, nothing. Are you truly fine with this?</p><p><strong>Zhang Jiao:</strong><br> Do you not harbor rebellious thoughts towards Pan-Human History?</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> That&#39;s a problem I can deal with later!</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> Because you robbed me of the person I valued more than that!</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> So I&#39;m going to kick your ass, no holds barred!</p><p><strong>Zhang Jiao:</strong><br> This won&#39;t do.</p><p><strong>Zhang Jiao:</strong><br> You leave me no choice. This might be a shoddy plan—but I shall overpower you with the might of numbers!</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> Kriemhild&#39;s personal squadron...all Heroic Spirit-grade!</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> (Reinforcements at this stage! They&#39;re not making this easy...!)</p><p><strong>Zhang Jiao:</strong><br> Wha...!</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> Did...you do that, Lord Holmes!?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> No, I&#39;m not carrying any firearms!</p><p><strong>Zhang Jiao:</strong><br> So you&#39;ve betrayed me, you oath-breaking monk...!</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> —Of course I did. Who am I to overlook such a good opportunity?</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> I had every intention of destroying this Singularity from the very beginning.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> I longed for this moment, even if I should be mired in mud, blood, and wickedness!</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> I will ruin everything, Great Teacher!</p><p><strong>Zhang Jiao:</strong><br> Tch...!</p><p><strong>Zhang Jiao:</strong><br> Did you believe you could escape me at that distance!?</p><p><strong>Zhang Jiao:</strong><br> Jí Jí Rú Lǜlìng—Haaa!</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Zhang Jiao:</strong><br> ...!?</p><p><strong>Zhang Jiao:</strong><br> (Did I—finish her in a single blow? No counterattack, no traps, no Curse Reversal?)</p><p><strong>Zhang Jiao:</strong><br> (In which case.

More importantly—</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Who was the sniper who saved us, perhaps?</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> Yes!</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> I don&#39;t recall our troops having a sniper of that caliber among them...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> I didn&#39;t get to see enough to theorize, but at least she wasn&#39;t our enemy.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Judging from how Zhang Jiao phrased it, they must have been an individual from the Revenge Realm who has been looking to stage a betrayal this whole time.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> ...It was truly a magnificent shot.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Ha, ha, ha... So you did it, I thank you...</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> I know not who you are, and though all I can do now is pray.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Win, all of you...!</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> ...We&#39;ve arrived.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> It would appear the enemies in pursuit are being held back by those two.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> It&#39;s now or never.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> Let us pay Kriemhild, the queen of the Revenge Realm, a visit.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> Please follow my lead, Master.</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> The sound of the armor creaking made Kriemhild feel strangely nostalgic.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> The man she fell in love with, loved, and then hated, now stood before her eyes.</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> It&#39;s been a while, dear.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> ...It has.</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> ...Melancholic as usual, I see.</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> Or is this proof that you will show me no mercy now that I am your enemy?</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> You&#39;d be right on both counts.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> You always went on about how melancholic I was.</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> That I did.</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> Though I didn&#39;t expect you&#39;d be this melancholic even before your enemies.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> ...I don&#39;t suppose you have any intention of stopping?</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> None at all.</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> Not even if every Servant in the Revenge Realm were to rise up against me.</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> Not even if I am on my own, betrayed by all, doomed to fight you all alone.</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> I know what I have to do. I know who I have to defeat.</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> Siegfried. My loathsome dear. My detestable husband. Traitor. Liar...!</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> —You&#39;re right. I have only ever lied, Kriemhild.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> The man sighed, as if to say he was tired.</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> It&#39;s too late to apologize!</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> You betrayed my love! I put everything on the line to avenge you!</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> Yet, from the very beginning, you had already forsaken your life! I won&#39;t forgive, I won&#39;t forgive you, I won&#39;t forgive you...!</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> (You&#39;ve got to be kidding me.)</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> (Her words alone electrify the room.)</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> (She&#39;s been elevated to Top Servant level thanks to the Holy Grails.)</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> (Her stats are likely above Siegfried&#39;s...!)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Siegfried...!</p><hr><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> ...I understand.</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> Your Holy Sword, Balmung. And my Demonic Sword, Balmung.</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> Is it not obvious which one is stronger?</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> We both wield Balmung the Phantasmal Greatsword. It&#39;s an even match.</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> I see...if you cannot even tell how much stronger your enemy is—</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> Then you&#39;re more of a fool than a hero, wouldn&#39;t you say!?</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Here she comes! Brace yourselves, this is the turning point!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Let&#39;s do this...!</p><hr><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> —How fun. —How fun, how fun, how fun!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Vengeance can&#39;t be achieved with a mournful face. Vengeance can&#39;t be achieved with a melancholic heart.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I&#39;m taking revenge against my most hated enemy. The one final target I could never have reached in my lifetime!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Go mad, go mad, go mad with revenge. The obsession of the dead causes hatred to well up.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> It was all your fault. I hated you for all of it.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Yet you remain ever the hero, struggling to save the world without so much as an apology.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> So perish, then. Perish, world.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> My beloathed, all that you cherish deserves to perish from this world.</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> Oh, ahh, ahh, aaaaaaaaaaaaa!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> She lacked finesse and the basics of swordsmanship.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Yet the excess magical energy and more importantly, the hatred, undeniably made up for it.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> (Damn, she&#39;s strong...! I guess this is what we get with two Holy Grails backing her up!)</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>She charges in with power double that of Siegfried&#39;s, her sword strikes hitting twice as hard at twice the speed.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>Siegfried is undoubtedly one of the greatest heroes this world has seen. With his peerless sword and armor, there are few opponents he would not best.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>But it is likely Kriemhild is wielding a power greater than that with the support of the Holy Grails.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> Guh...agh...!</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> Die—!</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> Haaah!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Not good, the damage is starting to accumulate...!</p><hr><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> If we could just...find a...weakness...

Can you transfer the power of your Mystic Eyes over to Siegfried?</p><p><strong>Viy:</strong><br> ...I can. What of it?</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Please do it.</p><p><strong>Viy:</strong><br> You&#39;re working me to the bone.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> ...Please!!</p><p><strong>Viy:</strong><br> It&#39;s a joke, I&#39;m just kidding, Master of my Master. Then I&#39;ll get right on it.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Siegfried!

Spatial Frequency, Channel. Matching.</p><p><strong>Viy:</strong><br> Commencing Clear Sight link. Target Hero Identity: Siegfried.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> This is...!</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> ...!</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> (Something has changed all of a sudden...and it&#39;s not me. I&#39;m functioning just fine.)</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> (Mystic Eyes...)</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> ...!</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> —I hear Mystic Eyes are a rare occurrence in this world. Are yours one such example?</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> (So she noticed it.)</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> It&#39;s certainly not one that binds its target.</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> Nevertheless, Siegfried, it isn&#39;t strengthening you either. Merely gazing on the past won&#39;t change a thing.</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> In which case, is it the future...or perhaps it exploits my weaknesses?</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> ... ...</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> Weakness, it is. Very well, do as you please.</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> I, too, am aware of your weaknesses. Which makes this fair.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> That would be unfair to you.</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> Stop acting like a saint. Doing that makes you so much more detestable.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> Is that so? Then I shall be unscrupulous.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> —While I do apologize for it, I will give you no quarter.</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> Ahahahaha! So you&#39;ve been holding back against me this whole time?</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> No, not at all.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> However—if you ask me if I had any intention of killing you, then my answer would be different.</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> ...!</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> I&#39;m going to fight to kill. First, I&#39;ll defeat you.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> Then we&#39;ll worry about the rest.</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> Now...really...really, really—losing it!</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> Very well then, your heroism and my hatred.</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> We will finally find out, at long last, which of those is righteous!</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I recall the first time we met.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Back then, I was young and earnest. I believed in the innate goodness and nobility of man. And above all else—</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I had faith in the love that man was capable of. Not merely the love shared between lovers, but familial love and affection too.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> When I fell in love, those feelings only grew stronger.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I believed that love was eternal, faithful, virtuous, and immutable.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> That did not change, even after I was driven mad with vengeance.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> This love of mine will never change. It is as pure and as immutable as a diamond.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I realized this truth moments before I killed Hagen.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> It was a trivial matter. That woman and I, the ones who intensified the feud.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> If it were down to us, we could have resolved the issue with a fistfight. However, both she and I had a plethora of relatives and subordinates.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> In other words, it was about to turn out into a conflict between our houses. A conflict tantamount to a war between countries.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> They say my husband, the one who I loved with all my heart, gave his life to prevent that.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Yes. That meant my revenge was meaningless from the get-go.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I see. So I could not have possibly been an Avenger. Berserker is the class that truly befits me.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Oh—but I am furious. I am so, so furious.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> My husband proclaimed his love for me. That he did.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> But it surely must have been mere lip service.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Said only because he was obligated to say them to the woman he took as wife.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> For my feelings have no place in that heroic conduct of his.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> My grief and sorrow meant nothing to him.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> No, on the contrary, I suppose he could not have cared less.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> He must never have imagined I would seek revenge.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> He must have thought that I would lament, mourn, and then find someone else.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> To hell with that, to hell with that. Damn it, every fiber of my being burns with fury.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Yet I could not grow any stronger.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Neither from the overwhelming amount of magical energy I received from the Holy Grails, nor from my crazed lust for revenge.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> The dragon-slayer&#39;s righteous strike sends my body flying.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Fujimaru, the Holy Grails have fallen from Kriemhild&#39;s hold!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Roger that, Holy Grails retrieved!</p><hr><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Game set,—right?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...Yeah.</p><hr><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> ...What&#39;s the matter? You look tense.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I think it&#39;s about time...</p><hr><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> For what?</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> —Hah. So it didn&#39;t work after all.</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> Troops numbering over 10,000. Two Holy Grails. My Demonic Sword. And above all else, my vengeful hatred.</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> None of those could hold a candle to you.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> ...That&#39;s not true. You were strong. And besides,</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> ...I should have had more faith in your strength and weakness.</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> —That is because...</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> I...believed you are the kind of person who would stand back on your feet no matter how many setbacks you face.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> With that sort of strength, I had figured you would have been able to lead a better life.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> ...I should have believed in one other thing—</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> Your noble outlook on love.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>The man&#39;s shoulders slumped as I looked on, stunned, at his sorrow.</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> I had always thought that I didn&#39;t matter. What are you saying now of all times, you idiot?</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> ...True, I consider myself an idiot too. And that pains me.</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> Pains you?</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> Surely there is nothing more painful than reflecting on your own foolishness, is there?</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> I was—wrong. And now I will be committing yet another mistake.</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> ...?</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> —Master. No, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> Kriemhild will never swing her Demonic Sword again.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> The vast amount of magical energy the Holy Grails had been supplying her with has largely been exhausted in this battle.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> I tried to kill her, and nearly did. And now, here I stand.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> —I&#39;ve kept my end of our contract. Please forgive me.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...I understand. Thank you for everything.</p><hr><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> Likewise.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> Thank you for granting this foolish wish of mine.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> Now then—</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> Eh? Ah? Eh? Um...what are you doing?</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> Your ambition of establishing a Singularity—or dream—well, whatever you want to call it.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> It has certainly fallen apart. Your opposition has retrieved the Holy Grails as well.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> Now, at long last, I can finally fight for you, fair and square.</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> —What?</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Huh...?</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> I apologize for startling you. But this is something I had decided on beforehand.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> If Kriemhild should survive the crumbling of her ambitions,</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> then I would wield this blade for her sake. Even if that means going against you.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> Even if, in doing so, my life is forfeit.</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> Why...are you...going this far!?</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> No, no, I must not acknowledge it, not that...!</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> Kriemhild.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> I may have been wrong about you, but you were wrong about me too.</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> Huh...?</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> It is hardly unnatural to fight for the one you love.</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> — —</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>Siegfried reached out to me with a smile while I was at a loss for words.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> Let us stand and win.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> For your pride and love.</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> ... ...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>Upon grasping the situation, I could not help but laugh.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>I grab ahold of his outstretched hand.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>However, it was merely like taking a wall as a crutch.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>And before I could be pulled up, I stood up of my own volition.</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> Don&#39;t get too carried away, Siegfried.</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> Of course I can still fight.</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> But I can fight even harder if I have a mighty warrior like you by my side.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> You&#39;re right. Yes, you&#39;re right. After all, you&#39;re the sort of person who never gives up.</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> Is that my only charm point?</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> There are a few others, but—</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> I haven&#39;t acknowledged myself enough to brag about my love to others.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> Simply put, I don&#39;t wish to brag about my love merely because I feel threatened by other men.</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> ... ...Hmm? Hmmmm?</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> You didn&#39;t actually think someone else could steal me away, did you?</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> Well, yes.</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> —</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> They jumped from the stunned silence straight into the dating sitcom dialogue...</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> We&#39;re not dating!! ...We&#39;re a married couple!!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Are you upset, Kadoc?</p><hr><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> ...It&#39;s not really my place to say anything about betrayal.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Besides, isn&#39;t it also a Master&#39;s duty to grant their Servant&#39;s wishes?</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> But we cannot afford to lose. And it looks like they have every intention of winning.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Of course!</p><hr><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> —I appreciate that. However, I shall not hold back.</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> ...Yes. Let&#39;s win, Siegfried.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Despite their words, the truth is that this is merely a charade for both sides.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> To all of you from Pan-Human History, please rest assured.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> The battle that is about to unfold is merely a rite of parting.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> —How unpleasant. I don&#39;t deserve such a happy ending.</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> ...So this is as far as I go...</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> Is this really all right...? I&#39;m...such a horrible woman...</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> Even if your actions were vile, you need not suffer a ghastly end.</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> —No, this is an ending ghastly enough.</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> After all, I&#39;m full of regrets.</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> For that crazed vengeance of mine, this situation, all of it...!</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> Then that is our punishment, and our atonement.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> Let us be off. I have no regrets if it means dying with you.</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> ...I see. Then hold my hand. Don&#39;t let go.</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong><br> Please, please, until we fall and pass like bubbles—</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Is it...over?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Not yet.</p><hr><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> I guess not. The worst is yet to come.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Master!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> According to our observational results, it appears three Holy Grails have been secured...!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> It&#39;s all right!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The majority of the Revenge Realm Servants have already been annihilated.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> There are survivors who have chosen to surrender... but the three realms have already been unified.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I believe they will soon be unsummoned.</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> Hmm, in any case, it&#39;s a job well done! You did well!</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> ...However, there are no signs of a Singularity&#39;s collapse, are there?</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> Oh dear...so it&#39;s already over, is it not?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> It&#39;s the end of the Revenge Realm.</p><hr><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> ...I see.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> The three Holy Grails unite and the rebellious Servants disappear.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> How extravagant. How marvelous.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> That unsightly, self-indulgent conflict I felt appalled by and those who revelled in it have—</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> all disappeared. I can hardly believe that it&#39;s making me feel this lonely.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> I will be taking my leave too. Oh, one last thing—</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Hm?</p><hr><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> I believe that you are my dear Anchin.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I don&#39;t think that&#39;s quite right though...</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> That&#39;s fine. After all, I&#39;m sure of it.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> You&#39;ve lost me.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> You never truly know yourself, as they say.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> But it&#39;s all right, you can place your trust in my discerning eyes.</p><hr><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> Well then, I will be taking my leave now. May your days ahead be pleasant.</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Hello there, so you&#39;ve returned? I&#39;ve already received the report.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Here is ours. Zhang Jiao has perished from our attack.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> However, the way he disappeared was identical to what occurred during the assassination. There is no assurance that he was the real thing.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> And what of Siegfried, who headed your way—</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> He and Kriemhild fell together. Well, it should be fine since we&#39;ve acquired the Holy Grails.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> ...Hmm, I see.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Though the Singularity has not collapsed despite our acquisition of the Holy Grail.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> I knew it, it&#39;s him...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> ...An earthquake? No, this is—</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> An emergency transmission... No, this is...!?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Congratulations to the Via Regia Restoration Alliance.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Thus ends the rebellion against Pan-Human History, and so collapses the Singularity.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> —Is that what you expected?</p><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> To think you&#39;d even transmit this to us... Who are you?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> I am James Moriarty.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> An Apostle of the Alien World and the last Servant rebelling against Pan-Human History.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> ...!</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Greetings, Bradamante and Joan. It&#39;s been some time.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Your emotions getting the better of you was unexpected... Not really. It was always within the realm of possibility.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> You need not fret over it. You were always on Pan-Human History&#39;s side to begin with.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> It&#39;s just that the heat of this Singularity brought you where you are.</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> —That may be so. Are you saying that you are unaffected by this “heat”?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> But of course.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> No matter who unifies the three realms, it is merely a necessary ritual.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> A ritual...is it?</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> ...I see. But nonetheless, “that” is how you are.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Oh, what about me?</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> You claim that you are unaffected by this fever.</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> But that is most likely not the case.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> I see, that may very well be so.</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> Señor Holmes! [♂ Señor /♀️ Señorita] Fujimaru!</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> Who is this man?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Hello there, Don Quixote de la Mancha. If it isn&#39;t the great braggart himself?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> The ones beside you are Sancho...Dulcinea, and Rocinante...oh, and—</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> If you choose to probe me any further, I&#39;ll be charging you with sexual harassment.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Whoa, that&#39;s going a bit too far. This wasn&#39;t in the calculations.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Fine, fine. There are no problems with you lot.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Either way, it doesn&#39;t look like you&#39;ll hold out, does it?</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> ...Seems so. Looks like this is the end of our role.</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> Yes, apparently so.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Congratulations! Congratulations to all! Oh, did I already mention it?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Your painstaking efforts will not result in this Singularity&#39;s elimination.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> In other words, it was all pointless. How do you feel about that?</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> ...!</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> Hahaha! And here I was wondering what you were about to say all of a sudden!</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> As a forerunner, I&#39;ll let you in on a little something, Moriarty.</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> Conflict is meaningless to begin with, and life is borderline meaningless!</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> That said, we must not spend it slovenly.</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> There&#39;s nothing wrong with indulging in fantasies, but those fantasies also deserve to be engaged seriously.</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> I was enchanted by my dream of knighthood. Which is why I toiled as a knight.</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> I couldn&#39;t be corrupted into an outraging bandit when I was captive to my dream of knighthood, could I?</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> Besides, there was meaning to this battle. For [♂ he /♀️ she] still lives, and so do the others!</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> —Is that so?</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> Now, I shall be bidding you all farewell a step ahead of the rest. Let us be off, Sancho.</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> His grace has said pretty much all I had wanted to say.</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> So farewell, everyone. And farewell to you too, Professor Moriarty.</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> This is a humble parting gift for you. Accept it as my apologies. Minerva.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Oh, Minerva...</p><hr><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> She will serve as your scout until you have eliminated this Singularity.</p><p><strong>Sancho:</strong><br> Shall we, your grace?</p><p><strong>Don Quixote:</strong><br> Yes. Farewell!</p><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> So what exactly do you want after all this?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> A fight, of course.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> A decisive battle against Chaldea, no...to settle things with Sherlock Holmes.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> —Is that so? Of course, I&#39;m all for it.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> After all, you are my archenemy.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> From this point onward, it will be a fair and square battle of wits.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> If you possess staggering wits that surpass my expectations, then—</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> that would spell my defeat. But if they are within my expectations, then I will triumph.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Come then, Sherlock Holmes.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Where?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> The center of the boundary of the three realms. The stage has been set there.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> The name of that stage is the Reichenbach Falls. Fitting, isn&#39;t it?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> ...I suppose so.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Good day to you then, Sir Sherlock. And farewell, Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Farewell to you, Servants.</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> So James Moriarty finally bares his fangs...!</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> But what exactly was his role in this Singularity?</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> When he showed himself before us, he recommended the unification of the realms and warned us of Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> That was all.</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> ...Perhaps we were simply insignificant so far as he&#39;s concerned.</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> Adding onto that, perhaps even this Singularity itself may have been insignificant to him.</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> What he seeks is to settle the score with Chaldea and—</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> ...with his archenemy.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> It would appear that this is as far as Lady Joan and I go.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> It was an honor to fight alongside you, despite everything.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> Nevertheless, even after the unification of the realms, my heart still throbs with rebellion.</p><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> Is that so?</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> That is so, Your Majesty. Honestly, I hope my next summoning is a proper one.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> Well, I&#39;m off now!</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> I shall take my leave too. And pray from the bottom of my heart.</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> ...I still cannot shake my animosity towards Pan-Human History. But I do pray, from the bottom of my heart, for your safety.</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> Since that emperor with a gentle smile, Constantine, truly existed,</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> —then Pan-Human History must be wonderful.</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> I can proudly answer Charlemagne&#39;s question now.</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> I can say the good outweighs the bad. His wish makes it all worth it.</p><p><strong>Joan:</strong><br> So, best of luck...all of you!</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Nearly every Servant in this Singularity harbored a rebellious spirit to some degree.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Not under the influence of the Apostle of the Alien World, but under the influence of their Master.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> No, that&#39;s not quite right. The countless Command Spells that flitted about in the war.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> That was the most important clue.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> As expected, Moriarty was not a Master but an Apostle of the Alien World.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Enough words, Holmes. You must set out immediately.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> ...My apologies.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> That said, I am still unrecovered from the damage done to my Saint Graph. I would only be a hindrance in your final battle against Moriarty.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Considering the strain on Master&#39;s magical energy reserves, it would be for the best if I returned to Chaldea&#39;s Spirit Graph trunk.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Charlemagne, our father, I would like to entrust my Master to you.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Meager as it may be, I would like to bequeath to you the magical energy I had been using to stay materialized.</p><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> I&#39;ll gratefully accept it... Sorry, but I happen to be rather gluttonous.</p><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> I can&#39;t tell if what you have to offer will be able extend my combat time even a single minute.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Will that much not be enough for you?</p><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> Maybe so.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Now then Master, Kadoc, Holmes. I shall await your return.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Thank you, and good job!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Receiving Servant repatriation signal from the Singularity. We will stand by for treatment as soon as he returns.</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> This Singularity is nearing its end. Rally your spirits, everyone.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Please make us something when we get back.</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> Hmm. Do you have anything in mind?</p><p><strong>Fujimaru:</strong><br> Some extravagant carbonara!</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> Oh-ho, to see you go with that choice...have you been enchanted by that sizzling carbonara with plenty of bacon?</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> Very well, very well. Then come back starving.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Foufoufou!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I&#39;m sorry, but Fou is saying he wants his portion too!</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> Huh!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Please reward us when we get back.</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> No, not that I mind though. Is there anything that you want?</p><p><strong>Fujimaru:</strong><br> A bunch of things!</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> First, a delicious meal...hmm, then a multiplayer game... hmm.</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> Though I won&#39;t be joining in, got that?</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> Then a warm, spacious bath...hmm. And a bed where you can fall sound asleep...hmm.</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> ...Let&#39;s stay positive and do everything the best we can!</p><hr><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Heh, well then... Minerva, we&#39;ll leave the scouting to you.</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> ... ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Wait, Xu Fu!?</p><hr><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> That&#39;s a Taoist talisman. Looks like it was made as a landmark.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> ...It&#39;s got a letter or some kind of note written on it.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Let&#39;s see...</p><hr><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> Oh, if you are reading this, then it means I have fallen in battle. My deepest apologies.</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> Or perhaps I was unsummoned after your victory? Not that it matters either way.</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> Well, I am obliged to you in a lot of ways, and vice versa.</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> So here&#39;s some valuable information from me.</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> It is my belief that there is a different Master for each Servant.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> !</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> Because when I used the Tao arts to divine the Master who summoned me, what I got was—</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> “Gently”, “Without resenting others”, “Without loathing others”, “Why?”, “Yet I cannot forgive”.</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> According to the divination, the summoning was conducted with such thoughts in mind.</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> Yet when I tried divining another Servant as a test,</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> “I will kill you”, “I will not forgive you”, “I won&#39;t forgive you for killing so much of humanity”, “Why?”,</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> were the results I got. This Servant had escaped the Via Regia Realm in the midst of that turmoil and made their way to the Revenge Realm.</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> I believe the difference in the extents of our rebellion against and revulsion towards Pan-Human History derives from the differences between our Masters.</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> Meaning, there are as many Masters as there were summoned Servants...or perhaps, there may have been even more of them.</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> I&#39;ve told you everything I know. Perhaps it will point you in the right direction. Bye!</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> ... ...Multiple Masters...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> That possibility is—no, but—</p><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> Sorry, but let&#39;s think it over as we go along.</p><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> Because I don&#39;t have much time left.</p><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> It&#39;s even possible that I will disappear as soon as we get to the Reichenbach Falls.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> ...Apologies.

That I won&#39;t deny.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> However, it is by overcoming this that one progresses towards their fate.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Wouldn&#39;t you agree, Sir Sherlock?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> ...James Moriarty.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Well, Sir, have you figured out the answer?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Have you figured out my identity, my objective, my truth?</p><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> You&#39;re up, Master.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> ...No. Actually, I would like you to wait for a while.</p><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> Hmm?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> I would like a one-on-one battle against Moriarty.</p><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> ...Seriously?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> I mean it—It&#39;s what I must do.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> That is what my gut is telling me.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> ... ...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>All of a sudden, Holmes seemed to shimmer before my eyes like a mirage.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>It must&#39;ve been the same for [♂ him /♀️ her] too.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>I don&#39;t know if [♂ he /♀️ she] tried asking him to stop or tried grabbing his clothes.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>But Holmes laughed gently as he unclasped that restraint.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>It&#39;s not my place to ask if he&#39;s sure about this.

Not on my life.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> —!</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> ...!</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> (I...didn&#39;t miss. Rather, my attacks aren&#39;t even registering as attacks.)</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> (Not even the sensation of impact exists.

Perhaps being summoned as a youth caused this?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> In this youthful form, the memories of my own lifetime have been cut short.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Hence my high hopes for you, Sherlock Holmes. My sworn enemy.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> O detective as wise and as cruel as I.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> It would appear that you remained clueless until the very end.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Is that so?

I must have been in a daze.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> How unusual, for a person like me to—</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Person?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> But of course. Even Servants were once human in life.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Those who carry the blood of gods in their veins, those who are based on Divine Spirits.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> There is a great diversity of Servants, but the majority of them were human.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Hello there, Sir Sherlock.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Who are you...?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> A vagueness reminiscent of a dream.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> You see, there is a mystery I would like you to solve. I would like you to give me a correct answer.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Don&#39;t listen to him, Holmes.</p><hr><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> No, Watson. Riddles are made to be answered.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Thank you. Well, here is the question for you.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> So this “mystery” is one that&#39;s been continually popping up all over this Singularity—</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> —Who is your Master? The one who summoned and tried to make use of you, that is.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> A question that&#39;s been asked again and again.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> By the Holy Grail of the Fourth Singularity? A karmic chain summoning via the Heroic Spirit Henry Jekyll?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Each time I am confronted with this question, I would—coherentize the facts in my mind.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> But that deception can only take me so far. I am, yes, I have finally...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> ...examined and grasped my own “mystery”.</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Babbage:</strong><br> Mister Holmes.</p><p><strong>Babbage:</strong><br> The Human Order Incineration plot has already succeeded. I have no way of overturning this.</p><p><strong>Babbage:</strong><br> Having accepted those facts, I&#39;d like to make this request.</p><p><strong>Babbage:</strong><br> Should humanity resolve the Human Order Incineration, something else is bound to come afterwards.</p><p><strong>Babbage:</strong><br> The Human Order Incineration is the dissipation of human history extending all the way into the past. However, why did it start from 2016?</p><p><strong>Babbage:</strong><br> This is where I sensed an “impending crisis”.</p><p><strong>Babbage:</strong><br> The Human Order Incineration did not erase the years 2017 and beyond.</p><p><strong>Babbage:</strong><br> The years 2017 and onward did not exist in the first place.</p><p><strong>Babbage:</strong><br> The King of Magic saw this and chose to harvest resources by working backwards from the year 2016.</p><p><strong>Babbage:</strong><br> —As such, I would like to request that you solve this mystery.</p><p><strong>Babbage:</strong><br> Why did the Human Order Incineration occur? What are Singularities, and what causes them?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Yes. Sherlock Holmes was summoned in London.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Entrusted with Mister Babbage&#39;s request, I made my way from the Fourth Singularity to the Sixth.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I had heard that TRI-HERMES, the spiritron computer of the Atlas Institute, was in the Sixth Singularity.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> ...This series of events could not be recorded by Chaldea&#39;s control room due to the Atlas Institute&#39;s communications jamming,</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> thus leaving Leonardo Da Vinci and Romani Archaman unaware.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> This caused the postponement of the million dollar question.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Could a Heroic Spirit summoned by the land&#39;s power truly cross over to a different land without a Master?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Of course, it is not impossible. For that is the ability of a great detective such as myself.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> But Romani Archaman, wise as he was, must have considered an alternate possibility.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> That Sherlock Holmes must have a proper summoner—a proper Master.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I&#39;m sure you don&#39;t need me to tell you who that is.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> A double agent within Chaldea, collaborating with it to thwart the King of Magic&#39;s scheme.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> None but the Alien God can bestow a Servant with such a purpose.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> All along, I have been—a Servant summoned by the Alien God in 2016.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> The first Apostle of the Alien God, so to speak.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> ...Goodness me, I have neither recollection nor awareness of this fact. But circumstantial evidence indicates that this is the case.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> It is likely that I sealed my own memories away, forgetting the fact that I am an Apostle of the Alien God.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Was it for the sake of gaining Chaldea&#39;s trust, or was it to emancipate myself from the Alien God...?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> I have no means of knowing which, given that I sealed away the memories of my summoning.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> But I can make a few inferences.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I was summoned by the Alien God and thus obeyed them.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I would prefer to think that was not the case, but since this is a matter of fact, I shall accept it.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> —In which case, what was my motive?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I hadn&#39;t been brainwashed. So I must have acquiesced to the Alien God&#39;s summons after some negotiation.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> In which case, what cause would move Sherlock Holmes to obey the Alien God?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> The Alien God summoned me in London and sent me to TRI-HERMES thereafter.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Singularity. Pan-Human History. Lostbelt. Fantasy Tree. The shape of stars. The shape of space. The shape of God.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Celestial bodies turned unobservable and countless galaxies rose over the planet&#39;s surface.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Such loneliness. Such isolation. It is as though this planet has been cut off from the universe.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Our world is already hollow, empty and void. And yet—</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> —I see. Should that be the motive, then it stands to reason that I would obey.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I erased my own memories, my own records.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> But not for the sake of hiding my status as an Apostle of the Alien God.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> But because I would be compelled to cooperate with the Alien God, by my very own nature, should I recall my status as an Apostle.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> For that is who I, Sherlock Holmes, am. It has nothing to do with selling out humanity or betraying Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I created that unsightly cover story to betray my own creed.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> The “me” engraved in human history at the time of my summoning—The imperturbable me, who would make deductions irrespective of good and evil,</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> had created the “me” who would make deductions that lean towards good, one whom the Chaldeans would prefer.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Like how I once was, or perhaps like myself from out of a fantasy.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> ... ...I see, so that&#39;s how it is?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Holmes!</p><hr><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Watson—</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> No, Yelena perhaps? It doesn&#39;t seem to be the small Da Vinci.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Or could it be you, [♂ Mister /♀️ Miss] Fujimaru?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Once you eliminate the impossible, whatever remains, no matter how improbable, must be the truth.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> There was a flaw in the theory of my past self.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> It is the possibility that I myself and those around me would be in jeopardy should the truth be uncovered.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> For that reason, I have been averting my eyes from this mystery.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> I sealed the problem itself out of sight and out of mind, before I could reach that conclusion.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Don&#39;t go any further...!</p><hr><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> But now the seal has been undone. Who summoned the “unveiler”? Well, it is all too obvious.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> I am an Apostle of the Alien God.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> The role I have been given is <img src="https://i.imgur.com/7VYgcEB.png" alt="berserk2"></p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Holmes!</p><hr><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> What has been missing since my summoning is being filled.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I may have been able to comprehend, fathom, and answer many truths—</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> But that is of no consequence now.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I understand Moriarty&#39;s objective. I know what he&#39;s after in this Singularity.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> It&#39;s Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Well, I suppose that&#39;s a problem too.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> This man looking down at me is young and unpolished, deliberate yet prideful.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Hence, I will unveil his objective.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> So all I have to do is tell them what kind of power this Moriarty has acquired.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> ...I see. Even now, I&#39;m still—</p><p><strong>L：Holmes:</strong><br> It would appear that I have found the answer...!</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> —What?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> [♂ Mister /♀️ Miss] Fujimaru!</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Moriarty&#39;s power is that of the three goddesses of fate, the Norns of Norse mythology!</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> I see, so you truly are absolute. But you are no longer an issue!</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> ...!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> —That will do.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> So I fall.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I suppose discovering the truth has led to my annihilation, rather than a fatal wound.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Though I may be an Apostle of the Alien God, I&#39;ve kept averting my eyes from that truth. I have been betraying my Master by doing so.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> On the other hand, I cannot deny my betrayal of Chaldea either.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> For my role is to <img src="https://i.imgur.com/7VYgcEB.png" alt="berserk2"></p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> As such, the timing is as good as it can get.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> After all, this is a matter even you have overlooked, Holmes.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> It wasn&#39;t a “problem so difficult that even the great detective himself has overlooked it”.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> The fact that Sherlock Holmes is ignoring it is the problem itself.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> That was what she meant, and she meant it as a warning.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> My apologies, Miss Sion. I failed to notice your heartfelt attentiveness.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> But I did not have a choice, did I?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> It was a truly unbecoming faux pas for a gentleman to intentionally overlook it—</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> But those feelings did not befit the great detective who investigated the murder of Pan-Human History for the cause of justice,</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> the Heroic Spirit Sherlock Holmes.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> —I enjoyed these days very much.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Before me lies a hard-to-crack case. Crisis approaches. And in spite of Watson&#39;s absence...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I spent those hectic days with many dear companions. It is with great reluctance that I part with them.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I kept averting my eyes so that I could stay with them.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> But I was able to choose the best option while avoiding the worst one. By wielding wit and reason as my weapons to the very end, just like a true detective.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I am laughing now. I am smiling up at Moriarty as he looks down on me.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> He, on the other hand—has a puzzled look on his face.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> The answer, of course, is obvious.</p><p><strong>L：Holmes:</strong><br> It is because we, Chaldea, will triumph.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I don&#39;t need to infer anything. This is an answer I can give with certainty.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> That we will triumph.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I fear not death. All I feel is certainty in victory and a measure of peace.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> —James Moriarty.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> You may have won. But despite that, victory is still mine.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Farewell, staff of Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Farewell, Mister Zemlupus. Farewell, Miss Sion and Captain Nemo.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Farewell, Da Vinci. Farewell, Director Gordolf.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Farewell, Yelena.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Farewell, [♂ Mister /♀️ Miss] Fujimaru. Farewell, Miss Kyrielight.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Farewell to all my dear and wonderful friends.</p><p><strong>L：Holmes:</strong><br> Yes. Those were wonderful days indeed.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> ...I won... No...I should&#39;ve won...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> A chill crawls up my spine.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Rather than fear, it was from uncertainty and an enigma.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> What was that satisfied laugh about...?</p><p><strong>E：???:</strong><br> You can&#39;t see it, can you?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Who goes there!?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> —Me—?</p><p><strong>Moriarty(?):</strong><br> Well yes, you can consider me yourself from thirty years down the line.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> What business do you have here?</p><p><strong>Moriarty(?):</strong><br> You have made a complete and utter mistake. I&#39;m here to inform you of that.</p><p><strong>Moriarty(?):</strong><br> The one who knows you best is you yourself, or so they say.</p><p><strong>Moriarty(?):</strong><br> That goes double for a greenhorn like you.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> —Hah.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> You must be joking. I&#39;ve beaten him. The man who kept besting you throughout your life.</p><p><strong>Moriarty(?):</strong><br> Oh yes, that one&#39;s a giveaway.</p><p><strong>Moriarty(?):</strong><br> You fought Sherlock Holmes one-on-one and emerged victorious.</p><p><strong>Moriarty(?):</strong><br> A grand, dramatic victory indeed. However—</p><p><strong>Moriarty(?):</strong><br> Is there not work left to be done? Go on, give it your best.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> ...! Not yet! It&#39;s not over yet!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> That&#39;s right, what&#39;s got me so befuddled?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> My objective is to—</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Sherlock Holmes is dead, ladies and gentlemen.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> That fulfills one of my objectives. Which leaves me with only one more.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> What objective...?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> The usurpation of Chaldea. Your organization is mine for the taking.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> —</p><hr><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> It&#39;s not really surprising, is it now?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> I believe that I can fight and win far more efficiently than the lot of you.</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> ...I beg your pardon.</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> But do you not think that we are furious after having just lost a comrade of ours?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> ...Hmm. Well, I do suppose such feelings are present.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Of course, I do understand that.</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> No, you don&#39;t. You don&#39;t understand, not one bit.</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> We&#39;re telling you to get off your high horse.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> I&#39;m not asking for your opinion.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> So, Kadoc Zemlupus. What do you make of my offer?</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> ...I take it you&#39;re asking me to become your Master?</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> W-Wh-Wha......!?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Correct.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> You see, I have no interest in Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> You&#39;re far more hardworking, diligent, and zealous than [♂ him /♀️ her]. Although, you&#39;re also more of a cynic.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> That doesn&#39;t sound like a compliment... Unfortunately, I&#39;m going to have to turn you down.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> I&#39;ll have to pass on going through all this betrayal all over again.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Hm?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Oh. I see, so that&#39;s where we differ.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> You won&#39;t have to betray Chaldea at all. I will be doing the dishonorable thing.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> ...Are you for real?</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> You&#39;re just going to renounce your status as an Apostle?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> I am not an Apostle of the Alien God, but rather an Apostle of the Alien World.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> I did not form a contract with the Alien God. Rather, I formed one with the mechanism—the system—they possess.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> While the Alien God may have summoned and bestowed power upon me, I am under no obligation to obey.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> For that is a fate I have severed.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> ...The three goddesses of fate...!</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Precisely.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> There are three Divine Spirits embedded within me, just as Holmes told you.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> They are Urðr, Verðandi and Skuld. The three Norse goddesses of fate.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> They weave and sever threads to link and sunder fates.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> ...That certainly explains why you didn&#39;t die.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> You kept linking your fate such that you wouldn&#39;t die from any attack.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Right you are. I was able to unshackle myself, thanks to that.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> And now I am free.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Nonetheless—it would be unseemly of me to remain an Apostle of the Alien World.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> After all, I was only an Apostle for the sake of defeating Sherlock Holmes.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> I had every intention of breaking my contract once that was achieved. In which case, I would prefer to have another Master.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Such as you—Kadoc Zemlupus.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> —I see.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>I gaze up at the Reichenbach Falls, atop which stands Moriarty.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>His power is outstanding. His strategies and tactics are well thought out.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>And above all else, he means every last word of it. Even I can tell as much.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>So he truly does mean his betrayal.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>Should I accept him, Chaldea will surely be capable of solving the matter more efficiently.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>This is not a proposal I can reject out of hand. But—there&#39;s just one thing.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> There&#39;s no pride in it.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I would normally say things like that are worth less than dirt.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> But that&#39;s a line for humans to speak. I am a Crypter and a magus.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> So I&#39;ll think rationally, and come to the following conclusion:</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Understood. All I have to do is become your Master, correct?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Kadoc...!?</p><hr><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Yes, indeed. Shall we begin—</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Hold it. I&#39;ve got two conditions for you.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Conditions...?</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> One is to fight Fujimaru and triumph.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Show me what you&#39;ve got.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> And the second is to not complain about the outcome.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> That&#39;s all. Simple enough for someone like you who wields the power of the three goddesses of fate.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Hmm. It will be one futile battle for [♂ him /♀️ her], but very well.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> ...Fujimaru. Are you up for it?</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Do it for Holmes. Go beat the crap out of him.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Charlemagne!</p><hr><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> Of course, I understand!</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> The Father of Europe, the first Holy Roman Emperor. You are without doubt a first-rate Servant...</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> but you&#39;re leaking magical energy all over the place. You can&#39;t fight any longer than a few minutes.</p><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> A few minutes will be enough to end this.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> —Hah. What foolishness.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Then I&#39;ll call for another.</p><hr><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Another? Oh, so you mean to summon a Servant.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Go ahead, suit yourself.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Come, my—</p><hr><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> First Servant!</p><hr><p><strong>Announcement:</strong><br> Unsummon Program, Assault Start. Commencing Spiritron conversion.</p><p><strong>Announcement:</strong><br> All processes completed. Commencing verification of Emergency Order.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Here I am, Master. Your First Servant.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Shielder Class. Mash Kyrielight has arrived!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ... ...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It&#39;s all right. If Holmes were here, he&#39;d say something to me like...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> “Come now, Miss Kyrielight, relax.”</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I stand here on behalf of what I believe in, and not in the name of revenge.</p><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> That&#39;s a nice expression you&#39;re wearing there.</p><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> Yep. I heard you&#39;re a Knight of the Round Table, but right now I wouldn&#39;t mind rechristening the Twelve Paladins into Thirteen!</p><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> Let&#39;s do this, Mash!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes. It&#39;s an honor, Charlemagne!</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> What a load of rubbish. Just try if you can.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Haaaaaah!</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> (...A bunch of insolence. This might as well be a throwaway match. Still, I suppose I should show them the difference in power between us.)</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> (O goddess triumvirate, link the threads of fate. Her attacks shall never reach me.)</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> (For that is fate. The proper course of events.)</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> —!?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Wh...at...!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Attack, connected!</p><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> Okay, I&#39;m right behind you!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Right! Mash Kyrielite, moving in!</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> W—Wait! Hold on, hold on, hold on! What&#39;s happening!?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> The threads of fate are...about to snap...!? They&#39;re weakening...!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> You&#39;re right.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Holmes told us back there that you&#39;re no longer an issue.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Now I understand what he meant.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> By defeating Holmes, you have ended up terminating your own fate.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> James Moriarty is Sherlock Holmes&#39; greatest, ultimate adversary.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That is to say,</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Holmes himself was none other than your destined rival!</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> —Very well, Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Let us fight an unsightly battle to achieve victory. It&#39;s not going to be a narrow one. I&#39;ll show you the overwhelming gap in power between us.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> There won&#39;t be any cheap tricks either. It&#39;ll have you all convinced and on your knees—</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> For that is the only kind of victory I have need of...!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Saint Graph readings are skyrocketing... Looks like he&#39;s going all out here!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Don&#39;t worry, we&#39;re going all out too!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes, of course!</p><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> Let us lock horns with the last dregs of our strength! All right, let&#39;s do this!</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> —I shall answer that frankness of yours with my own full, honest strength.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> For that is how I shall achieve a perfect victory. For that is how I shall make you all kneel.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> I am James Moriarty, Apostle of the Alien World, the Napoleon of Crime.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> The one who shall bring you Chaldeans to heel.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> ...Here I come!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Moriarty(?):</strong><br> —Fate is never an immutable matter.</p><p><strong>Moriarty(?):</strong><br> A single pebble can so easily throw that fate into disarray.</p><p><strong>Moriarty(?):</strong><br> What do you think led to your defeat?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> ...It&#39;s Sherlock Holmes.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Instead of killing just him, I should&#39;ve gotten rid of him along with the rest of Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Moriarty(?):</strong><br> No. You don&#39;t even get half marks for that answer.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> ...Is it because I underestimated Fujimaru?</p><p><strong>Moriarty(?):</strong><br> No. You accurately gauged [♂ his /♀️ her] capabilities.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Is it Charlemagne? Or Mash Kyrielight?</p><p><strong>Moriarty(?):</strong><br> No, no, no. Is there not another?</p><p><strong>Moriarty(?):</strong><br> A person you consider crucial.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> ...Kadoc Zemlupus?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> But he didn&#39;t even do anything. He was just a bystander.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> He wasn&#39;t even fulfilling a Master&#39;s duties—</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> It can&#39;t be.</p><p><strong>Moriarty(?):</strong><br> It was he who revealed the threads of fate, boy, allowing them to be severed.</p><p><strong>Moriarty(?):</strong><br> Remember well, greenhorn. Arrogance begets negligence, and negligence goeth before a fall.</p><p><strong>Moriarty(?):</strong><br> Now here&#39;s a question from me. What is it you ought to do now?</p><p><strong>Moriarty(?):</strong><br> Surely you aren&#39;t going to be a good sport and await your death, are you?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> ... ...</p><p><strong>Moriarty(?):</strong><br> What an idealist! At this rate, you&#39;re a long way off from becoming “me”!</p><p><strong>Moriarty(?):</strong><br> But it sure must have been easy coming to that conclusion, considering you&#39;ve got something extra in you.</p><p><strong>Moriarty(?):</strong><br> Even more so considering that it&#39;s the power of the three goddesses of fate. No wonder you&#39;ve resigned yourself to death.</p><p><strong>Moriarty(?):</strong><br> Let this be a lesson, dandy man.</p><p><strong>Moriarty(?):</strong><br> An instant death may be hard to avoid, but a slowly creeping death is one easily avoided.</p><p><strong>Moriarty(?):</strong><br> All it would take is for you to discard that arrogance of yours.</p><p><strong>Viy:</strong><br> ...This is it. I no longer have a shred of power left in me.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> That&#39;s more than enough. You helped me right up until the very end.</p><p><strong>Viy:</strong><br> It was a request, what choice did I have?</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> I see...</p><p><strong>Viy:</strong><br> Goodbye, Kadoc Zemlupus.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Just one last thing. —Thank you, I&#39;m only here because of you.</p><p><strong>Viy:</strong><br> You&#39;re very welcome. Master of my master.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> ...So long.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> ...Have I lost...?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Significant decline in magical energy due to partial destruction of Saint Graph. Damage to your weapons has sealed your Noble Phantasm.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> You have lost, James Moriarty.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Yes, you&#39;re absolutely right. By the way...</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> ...may I presume that while Mash Kyrielight was who cut my strings, it was Kadoc who enabled that to happen?</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> That&#39;s right. I never said anything about not helping them, after all.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> First off, it&#39;s your own fault if the support of someone like me without a Servant can put you at a disadvantage.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Hahaha, you&#39;ve got me there.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> —Now all that&#39;s left is for me to die a pathetic death. Which is where this proposal comes in.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> A...proposal?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Ahem. Umm.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> ...Help me out here, will you?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> — —.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> (Speechless, as one would expect)</p><hr><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> ...Are you seriously saying this?</p><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> It would seem he is. What now, Master?</p><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> I&#39;ll decapitate him right away if your answer is a no.</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> Do you really believe we&#39;d let you off the hook after you murdered Sherlock Holmes, our Administrative Advisor?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Allow me to refute that. Wouldn&#39;t you say the murder counted as self-defense?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> S-Self-defense...!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ... ...Oh.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Heh heh heh, as expected of Mash Kyrielight. I knew you&#39;d be the first one to notice!</p><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> ...What does he mean?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Mash?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Well...this is about what happened in their lifetimes...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Holmes and Professor Moriarty both fell here, at the Reichenbach Falls—</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Though they were both pronounced dead, Holmes returned after some time.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> On the other hand, it was implied that Professor Moriarty did truly die.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> So, in other words...if you consider what happened in their lifetimes...</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Exactly!</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> I was murdered! Then I killed him! It&#39;s only fair that we&#39;re even now, is it not!?</p><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> No, no, no, no, no. That&#39;s not how this works...is it!?</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> Don&#39;t you go spouting those nonsensical theories of yours, Moriarty! You ought to apologize to the Archer of Shinjuku!!</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> How exactly would you have me apologize to the older me? I merely stated the facts.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Do feel at ease though. I&#39;m in the same situation as Charlemagne over there.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> My Saint Graph has been partially destroyed, my magical energy is uncontrollably ebbing away, and the goddess triumvirate&#39;s threads of fate have been severed.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> If all goes well, I will die before I ever get to leave this Singularity.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Even establishing a provisional contract with you wouldn&#39;t change that.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> ...I suppose so.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> You&#39;re doomed unless you have an ace up your sleeve.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> And this is no longer a situation where you can afford to hide such a thing.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> You will most assuredly die within this Singularity, James Moriarty.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Yes, but that&#39;s not all there is to this Singularity.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> There is something crucial here that will affect your future.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...!</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> I&#39;m the only one who can take you there. For I am the only one aware of it.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> So, what will it be?</p><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> I&#39;m a Servant.</p><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> This matter concerns Chaldea, so I&#39;ll keep my mouth shut.</p><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> Please make your own call.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> I&#39;ll refrain from voicing my opinion too. It&#39;s not something I ought to have a say in.</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> G...Grr...a vital clue, is it...?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ... ...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> New Director, I am in favor of Moriarty&#39;s proposal.</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> What?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I believe Holmes would do the same if he were here.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> He is not one to be swept along by fleeting emotions.</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> ...That does sound like something the Administrative Advisor would do.</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> Furthermore, if that is Mash Kyrielight&#39;s opinion, then I take no issue with it.</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> How about you—Fujimaru?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I don&#39;t mind.</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> ...I see.</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> Let&#39;s not take a life here, provided that he&#39;s kept on a tight leash of course.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Sure, if you&#39;ll let me have some payback just this once.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Payback...oh, corporal punishment? Sure, I don&#39;t mind.</p><p><strong>Fujimaru:</strong><br> Ouch, ouch...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Are you all right, Master...?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> You&#39;re not used to beating someone up, are you?</p><hr><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Now, about that provisional contract—</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> I have no intention of contracting with you. I&#39;m sure you know that already.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Good grief, how single-minded.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Then that leaves me no choice but to contract with you. Consider it an honor.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I don&#39;t really see it as an honor though...</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> You&#39;re supposed to bear with it and act professional, (Provisional) Master.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Fine.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> ...I&#39;d like you to appreciate the gravity of this a little more.</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> How egotistical for a guy on the verge of death...</p><hr><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> This should keep me around for a bit longer. Nonetheless, I can&#39;t afford any chit-chat.</p><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> Great, it looks like you have an accord.</p><p><strong>K：Charlemagne:</strong><br> James Moriarty.</p><p><strong>K：Charlemagne:</strong><br> It pains me to entrust an incarnation of evil like you with this...</p><p><strong>K：Charlemagne:</strong><br> But at the same time, I&#39;m certain that you&#39;re the type of person to make good on your promises.</p><p><strong>K：Charlemagne:</strong><br> I&#39;ll leave our Master in your hands. Understood?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> ... ...Yeah, I get it.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> It would be far too pathetic to stage a betrayal after begging for my life.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> We&#39;re keeping an eye on you precisely because that&#39;s the sort of thing you&#39;d pull.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Hahaha, stop saying the truth. But to hear you say that—</p><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> Oh, speaking of which, it&#39;s time for me to go, Master.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...Thank you so, so much...!</p><hr><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> Stop, stop.</p><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> I sought awesomeness, and you were awesome.</p><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> It&#39;s just that simple. Karl der Große is sure to be rejoicing in the digital sea too.</p><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> ...Well, if he were here to see this situation...</p><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> He&#39;d suddenly go “I&#39;d like to have Mash as my bride” or something...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Excuse me? What are you saying all of a sudden?</p><hr><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> Oh, no worries. He&#39;s not the type to lay his hands on someone else&#39;s girl...I think...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> That only worries me more though!?</p><hr><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> Hahaha, it&#39;s not that bad, really.</p><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> I wasn&#39;t sure what to make of it at first, but I&#39;m glad I was summoned.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I&#39;m glad I met you too.</p><hr><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> I&#39;m glad to hear that.</p><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> I hope the next Singularity&#39;s a merry one! Because I&#39;ll bring all Twelve Paladins with me to have fun!</p><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> No, let&#39;s invite the Knights of the Round Table too. And then we can play football or something!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Sounds great!</p><hr><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> Well, do call on me if anything happens. See you later, bye-bye, farewell.</p><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> ... ...</p><p><strong>Charlemagne:</strong><br> —Oh, it&#39;s gotten a little gloomy. I&#39;m not too good with this sort of atmosphere...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Goodbye, Charlemagne.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Now then, Moriarty...please show us the way.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Because I&#39;ll be keeping an eye on you!</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Hahaha. Rest assured, the accumulated damage already has me on the verge of disappearing with barely any strength left.</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> Well then, let me ask this right off the bat.</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> What is this crucial thing you speak of? And where is it located?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> I&#39;m sure you already knew prior to Rayshifting that this is North America, right?</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> Yes.</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> There was nothing American about this place though...</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> It&#39;s just more European architecture everywhere I look.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> The place I&#39;m about to guide you to is an extremely American one though.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> It&#39;s located deep within the Via Regia Realm. A place once known as the State of Nevada.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> A certain blank region which even the talented Sancho failed to notice.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> —Ha, you&#39;ll understand when we get there!</p><h2 id="section-22-and-so-you-shall-face-retribution" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-22-and-so-you-shall-face-retribution" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 22: And So You Shall Face Retribution</h2><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Well, who&#39;s going to drive this golem carriage—</p><p><strong>All Three:</strong><br> (Pointing)</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Of course, who else but me? After all, I&#39;m the only one who knows the way.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> I&#39;ll just quietly get a move on! Minerva, I&#39;d like you to keep an eye out, just in case.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ... ...</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> ... ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Speaking of which!</p><hr><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> W-What the hell, Fujimaru? Don&#39;t just yell all out of nowhere.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Yeah, it&#39;s just that I remembered what Pepe said.</p><hr><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I see there&#39;s no A-Team.</p><hr><p><strong>Count Peperon:</strong><br> Maybe one day! When you finally get big enough, Fujimaru,</p><p><strong>Count Peperon:</strong><br> you, me, and Kadoc can call ourselves the A-Team! Oh, that will be such fun!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> So Pepe said that...</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Nope. Fujimaru still has a long way to go before [♂ he /♀️ she] can count [♂ himself /♀️ herself] part of the A-Team.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> B-But there may not be another chance if you let this one pass.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Personally, I am in favor of calling [♂ him /♀️ her] a part of the A-Team...</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> A compromise it is then. A-Minus Team.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Sounds like the grading scale of an American university!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes, it has a familiar ring to it.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> But “minus” is bad for optics, could we perhaps tone it down a little?</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> A-Dash.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Sure, let&#39;s go with that.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Are you fine with that...?</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> By the way,</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> I only knew him for a little while, so I&#39;m totally fine with it.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> But what about the two of you?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You mean Holmes?</p><hr><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Of course.</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> Stop asking questions that could have an impact on morale, Kadoc.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> I figured now&#39;s as good a time as any to put it out there...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Well...of course, I am sad.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> And I&#39;m also frustrated. But above all else, I still can&#39;t believe it...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Those are my honest feelings.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> You think he&#39;s still alive or something?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> No...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I heard the disappearance of his Saint Graph signal was confirmed right after I Rayshifted.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Judging from the record of that Saint Graph, it couldn&#39;t have been anyone other than Holmes.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Still, it&#39;s Holmes we&#39;re talking about.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> So I thought he&#39;d come strutting back home as if nothing had happened...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That&#39;s how I feel right now.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I mean...the great detective who vanished into the Reichenbach Falls did make his comeback before the readers.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> —You&#39;re right!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Although I hear Conan Doyle wasn&#39;t all too pleased with that!</p><hr><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> —I see. So that&#39;s how you guys see it? I suppose that just goes to show how long you&#39;ve known him.</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> Precisely, as expected of a Chaldean veteran and newly minted researcher, Mash Kyrielight.</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> That handsome guy will make his return as though nothing had happened. Oh...yes, that is surely the case.</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> I have nothing in the way of proof or evidence, but that is what I choose to believe. The reason being—yes, the reason being that—</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> What do you think it is, Technical Advisor?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Leave it to me. “The reason being that there are still mysteries left unsolved!”</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Right? The mystery behind the bleaching of the world and the Alien God&#39;s true identity. The role of the Fantasy Trees.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> The great detective can hardly bow out until he&#39;s elucidated those in their entirety.</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> Yes! Precisely, you&#39;re exactly right!</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> We must endeavour to gather as much information as possible until he nonchalantly makes his return!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I hear wolves howling.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> No need to worry, I&#39;ve laid out a spell to ward off beasts. It should last for a night at least.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Feel free to stay in spirit form, Moriarty.</p><hr><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> I&#39;ll take you up on that offer. Thank you.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> What about Minerva?</p><hr><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Looks like a write-off to me.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> After all, she was made with technology derived from Olympus.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> This is as far as she goes with the technology present in this era and in this Singularity.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You did well...</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It&#39;s very refreshing being able to camp like this...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I wish Pepe were here with us.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Ah, well.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> There aren&#39;t many magi as good at reading the room as he was.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> He was a unique sort of guy, one who never made things awkward.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Even that moody Akuta caved in to his requests.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> ...I didn&#39;t know she was Yu Mei-ren, though...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Shocked?</p><hr><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> This goes beyond just being shocked.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> It hit me as hard as it would&#39;ve if I found out my roommate was actually an alien all along.</p><p><strong>Akuta Hinako:</strong><br> Got a problem?</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> I used to think she was this mysterious, placid magus. On further reflection, I feel like an idiot.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> I can&#39;t even comprehend how she landed that job.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> According to Koyanskaya, Director Marisbury was the one who scouted her.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It&#39;s likely he sought to eliminate the risks that came with the demonstration of Rayshifting.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> I see.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> I too was led to believe Akuta had ties to the former director Marisbury...</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> I guess that inference alone was on the money.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Speaking of which...I&#39;ve been meaning to ask you, Kadoc.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Hm?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> What did you think about Kirschtaria&#39;s plan?</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> You mean the whole deification of humankind thing?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> An unthinkable dream, an absurdly ambitious plan. How much of it were you aware of, Kadoc?</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Only as much as this blockhead next to me. In other words, I had no idea.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Hey, that&#39;s rude!</p><hr><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> If all had gone well, Kirschtaria&#39;s plan would have been realized.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> I had no reason to oppose it. Though I don&#39;t think it foolish...</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> It did come as a surprise to me.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> A...surprise?</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Magi, by definition, are more or less a bunch of egotists.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Even lofty ideals such as the salvation of humanity will eventually fall prey to corruption and lead them astray.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> If he had been in Pan-Human History, Kirschtaria would&#39;ve eventually established a new faculty—</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Or perhaps he would&#39;ve inherited the seat of a Lord.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> That in itself would have been more than enough for a magus to distinguish themselves.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Yet he crafted a plan that goes against that and put it into action.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> The accumulation of his efforts. Their results. The merit he had earned. A privileged position.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> He tossed all that aside as though they were “insignificant”, and strove to stand hand-in-hand with all mankind.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> What I couldn&#39;t believe was that spirit of his, rather than his thaumaturgical aptitude or skills.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> ...Not that I noticed it back then though. He was truly a man worthy of being our leader.</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> Apologies for the interruption...Kadoc Zemlupus.</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> Regarding Daybit, the final Crypter who surely awaits us in the seventh Lostbelt.</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> What do you make of him?</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> I&#39;m going to level with you here.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> I really don&#39;t know much about Daybit.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> He was, at times, like the all-veiling darkness and yet, he was also like a radiant light dispelling a person&#39;s doubts.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> At times, it would seem like we could communicate with him and yet, at times it felt like we weren&#39;t even speaking the same language.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> And yet he could deftly handle matters of communication. So well that it almost alarmed us.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> In that sense, he and Holmes are rather alike.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> He would suddenly state the exact solution we were looking for, despite never having had any involvement or hand in it on his part.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> ...It kind of felt like he was seeing a whole other dimension that we weren&#39;t.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Sporadic yet unabating. That is who Daybit Sem Void is.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> That&#39;s all I can say about him.</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> Hmm, that wasn&#39;t helpful at all!</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Well, excuse me!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> (I wonder if I should ask about Ophelia too?)</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> What&#39;s the matter, Fujimaru?</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Ophelia? ...Ophelia, huh?</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> If Daybit is the one who stayed the same, then Ophelia would be the one who changed.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> But I don&#39;t see that as a bad thing at all. On the contrary...the surprise must&#39;ve been on Ophelia&#39;s end.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> On Ophelia&#39;s end?</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> It would&#39;ve been a shock to all of us back then, seeing Mash being this chatty.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I-I see...that may be so.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> You see, Ophelia—</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> ... ...</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> No, let&#39;s not go there.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Now&#39;s not the time to bring that up anymore. The reason she changed, that is.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> I invoke my right to remain silent. I won&#39;t talk, not even if my collar is activated.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Oh, we&#39;ve long since shut your collar down.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> ...Are you fine with letting me know that...?</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Well, that does give me some comfort.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> I&#39;ve been beside myself with worry that someone might accidentally activate it.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I think it&#39;s about time we slept.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Good idea. Tomorrow&#39;s going to be an early day.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Roger that. I&#39;ll keep the fire lit.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Good night.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes. Good night, Senpai.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ... ...</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> ... ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> By the way, I&#39;ve got this other thing–</p><hr><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> Just sleep!</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> At long last, after yet another day had passed, the four travelers arrived at their destination.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Well then.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> What? We&#39;re here?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Is this really our destination, Moriarty?</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> There&#39;s absolutely nothing here.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> This is but a camouflage, courtesy of yours truly. The coordinates, however, are a perfect match.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Hm? Hmm? These coordinates...this place...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Uh, Moriarty? Are you really sure this is where we&#39;re headed?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Although this is completely out of the blue, you saw this coming from a mile away, no?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> I see...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> I&#39;d pegged this as a prank, and if that were the case, I thought I&#39;d let Mash give you a good wallop.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> I would do no such thing, not at this point.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Gentlemen, let us now speak the password as one.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Password?</p><hr><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Since time immemorial, there is but one phrase you say when you wish to open closed doors, correct?</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Do we really have to say it?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> I&#39;m going to sulk disappointedly if you won&#39;t say it.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> By all means, sulk away and be very disappointed, James Moriarty.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Now then, three-two-one—</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Open Sesame!</p><hr><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Really? Did you really just say that?</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> What&#39;s more, Moriarty is so surprised that he&#39;s been rendered speechless.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That&#39;s such a shame!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Umm, guys?</p><hr><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> A-Apologies...now then, ahem.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> “Open Sesame”.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> An earthquake...?</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Hey, why are there stairs in a place like this...?</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Does this mean we&#39;re headed underground?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Well, I wonder about that. Are you stout-hearted enough to go?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Let&#39;s go!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Right!</p><p><strong>Both:</strong><br> You&#39;re way too easy going!</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> ...Shall we go?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Yes, we shall...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It&#39;s rather deep...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I can hardly make out anything...</p><hr><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> That&#39;s a problem too, but even more problems abound. This staircase isn&#39;t made of stone.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Oh, you&#39;re right.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> From the feel of it...it&#39;s definitely man-made. It feels so very modern...</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Do be careful, if you happen to fall, you&#39;ll never stop falling.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Nonetheless, we have descended quite a fair bit. The third basement level...no, the fourth?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> A rough estimate of our destination would place it around the tenth basement level.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> In all likelihood, they were wary of deep penetration ordnance such as bunker busters.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> ... ...Huh?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Bunker busters...?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Oh, I get that it&#39;s the name of the weapon and such...</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> But that&#39;s a modern military weapon, is it not? Is that relevant?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> More than you can imagine. Let us move on.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Well, this is as far as the stairs go. Are the three of you all right?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I-I&#39;m beat...</p><hr><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> It takes quite a mental toll to go down a staircase in pitch black darkness.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Master, your hand please. I believe it will help you be at ease a little—!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Master!</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Zhang Jiao...!?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> No need to concern yourselves with him. He&#39;s long dead.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> ...Huh?</p><p><strong>Zhang Jiao:</strong><br> ... ...</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> I&#39;m not too familiar with it myself. Let&#39;s see, umm...that&#39;s it.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> I believe he&#39;s an existence referred to as a shijiexian.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> However, as long as he remains a corpse, his Master won&#39;t be supplying him with magical energy.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> So Zhang Jiao had little choice but to create an alter ego of himself, while erasing its self-awareness as an alter ego at the same time.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> For it would lose its sense of self should it gain awareness of its status as an alter ego, putting it at risk of annihilation.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Even if the assassination plan should succeed, even if he should fall in the final battle...</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> As long as he, the real self, remains in existence here, he will create an alter ego and revive.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> The revived alter ego would have eventually restored this Singularity.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> And then invite in resummoned Servants, foment conflicts, and bring about another War of the Realms.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> All for the sake of his Master.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> That&#39;s over now though.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> The cost of creating an alter ego is that he systematized his own real self.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Incapable of self-defense, incapable of self-growth, little more than—</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Decoration.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Was Zhang Jiao...protecting this place?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> No.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> I guess you could call it that, but it would be more accurate to say that he had no choice but to do so.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> You could say that while his Master created this Singularity, it was Zhang Jiao who nurtured it.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> It was his dedication to it that made this Singularity so intricately bizarre.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Now then, I&#39;ll open the door.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> From this point onward, communication with Chaldea will likely be rendered impossible.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> It&#39;s already grown erratic, has it not?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> ...He&#39;s got a point there, the signal&#39;s about to cut off. The three of you be careful now.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Don&#39;t worry, we&#39;ll be right back.</p><hr><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Yep!</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> No matter what may happen, make sure to prioritize your safe return, Kadoc Zemlupus.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Got it.</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> It pains me to say this...but you&#39;re the only one we can count on. After all, the two of them there are the foolhardy type!</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Yeah, I&#39;m WELL aware of that.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I-Is that so?</p><hr><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> That. Is. So.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> In any case, take care. I&#39;ll be waiting for your reports!</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Well then—</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> The trio were dumbfounded by the alienness of the passageway.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> A cosmic...corridor...?</p><hr><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> That which I must show you lies ahead.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Now, let us move on to ground zero of this Singularity.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Ground...zero...</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> But this is almost like—</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Kadoc?</p><hr><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> No...it&#39;s nothing.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> How far will we be walking this time?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Oh, I assure you that it&#39;ll be quite a short stroll.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...All right, let&#39;s go!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Right!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> The quartet walked wordlessly down the cosmic corridor.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> They had no time to admire the beautiful yet horrifying sights before them, or perhaps there simply was no room for fear.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> There was this oppressive feeling, like the walls were closing in. As though they were driven by necessity.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Kadoc, Mash, and Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> What swept across their minds was a truly distressing feeling. It was neither unpleasant nor uncomfortable.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> It was like restlessly traversing a mountain in the dark of night.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> “I&#39;m about to see something truly ominous.”</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> A strange certainty of that nature.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> The Master of this Singularity lies up ahead.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Needless to say, his act is one of revenge and retribution against Pan-Human History.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> He has that right—I believe that is what I told you before, Kadoc?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> But that&#39;s not quite accurate.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> He was not in a position to do otherwise.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> He was obligated to do so, as it was his duty.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Even should the intent to retaliate be absent, as an entity, he was in a position where he could not do otherwise.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> And the Servant, Zhang Jiao, established this extreme-scale Singularity to fulfill that wish.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Using Area 51, Nevada, USA in the year 2017— as its point of origin.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> We&#39;ve arrived. This is the final door.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> I presume you&#39;re ready?</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Master.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Open it, Moriarty.</p><hr><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Understood.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> —What lay before their eyes was an unremarkable yet outlandish scenery.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Kadoc Zemlupus had lived his life as a magus.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Mash Kyrielight and Fujimaru had fought their way through a multitude of Singularities and Lostbelts.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Many oddities have they encountered. Some worthy of awe, and some not.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> And yet–it&#39;s not every day that they encounter a situation wherein “unremarkable scenery becomes an oddity”.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> —Where are we?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> That is, of course, self-explanatory.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> You could call it an operating theater, or perhaps a treatment room, or perhaps a laboratory.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> The devices on the walls appear to be state-of-the-art, but it would probably be safer to not touch them.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> —No, that is irrelevant. That is well and truly irrelevant now.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Their sense of sight rejects it.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> It screams that it does not wish to see what lies in this room.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> My time is almost up...but one last thing. Allow me to introduce you.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> This here is the origin of the entire Singularity.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> The life-form that purportedly crash landed on Earth 100 years ago.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> One who has cultivated a hatred towards humanity after 100 years of subjection to all forms of experimentation here.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Subject: E.</p></div><!--[--><!--]--></div><footer class="page-meta"><div class="meta-item edit-link"><a class="external-link meta-item-label" href="https://github.com/r-grandorder/tri-hermes/edit/main/src/Lostbelt/traum-rayshift.md" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" aria-label="Help us improve this page!"><!--[--><!--]--> Help us improve this page! <span><svg class="external-link-icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewbox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path><polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg><span class="external-link-icon-sr-only">open in new window</span></span><!--[--><!--]--></a></div><div class="meta-item last-updated"><span class="meta-item-label">Last Updated: </span><!----></div><div class="meta-item contributors"><span class="meta-item-label">Contributors: </span><span class="meta-item-info"><!--[--><!--[--><span class="contributor" title="email: 59034871+Fgrandorder@users.noreply.github.com">Lib</span><!----><!--]--><!--]--></span></div></footer><!----><!--[--><!--]--></main><!--]--></div><!----><!--]--></div>
