Deeper.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Further. Further.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Those are the only thoughts that have<br> occupied my mind up to this point.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> This is the Reverse Side of the target world–a completely opaque domain, impossible to observe. It is the deepest, and most shallow, trap to ever exist. It is both the closest afterworld, and the furthest.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> However, it is not my duty either to invade the target world, nor to commence the war for its observation.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> No, my duty is merely to call for<br> them...and to remain myself.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> The conditions have all been met. Next, I will shut down my consciousness and transfer all my authority to myself. Goodbye.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I&#39;m adrift.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I&#39;ve been drifting here forever.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> It&#39;s lonely drifting all alone, so...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> ...I think I&#39;ll call for them.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/XAqlQYL.png" alt="berserk1"></p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Yes. Call out their names.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Deeper. Deeper...<br> Further. Further...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I will wait at the unknowable sea...within the rainbow dream.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> ...Ehehe.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Senpai. Senpai?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> You&#39;ve been standing in the hall staring into space for a few minutes now. Is everything okay?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Do you have a stomachache!? Is the stress of tomorrow&#39;s special mission wreaking havoc on your insides!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> No, nothing like that. Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;m fine.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> (Was I daydreaming? ...Maybe I&#39;m just imagining things.)</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Are you sure? Well, that&#39;s a relief.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Since we enhanced Captain Nemo&#39;s<br> Spirit Origin in India...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...he can keep his Noble Phantasm–Nautilus, the ultimate submarine–in reality indefinitely.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> And a good thing too, since a ship that can cross an ancient sea of gods will be absolutely crucial for the Atlantic Lostbelt mission we&#39;ll be undertaking next.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> However, while we do need to put Captain&#39;s ship through its paces to make sure it&#39;s all ready for the upcoming voyage, there&#39;s also a lot of other essential gear and equipment we still have to procure.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> So since the rest of Chaldea&#39;s<br> staff will be working on that...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Captain, you, me, and a few Servants will be taking the Nautilus out for a test run by ourselves.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> But don&#39;t relax just because it&#39;s a test run! It&#39;s going to be an intense training exercise covering many scenarios, including a Void Space dive!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> So I wouldn&#39;t be at all surprised if you were feeling nervous about it, especially since we&#39;ll be conducting the exercise without many of our usual crew on the bridge.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I&#39;m a little nervous, sure, but I&#39;m mostly just excited.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I&#39;m always up for a boat trip with you, Mash!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Right. To tell you the truth, I&#39;m excited about it too. The idea of sailing the Void Sea is a little nerve-racking...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...but if it means getting to be on the crew of Captain Nemo&#39;s famous Nautilus, I&#39;m more than happy to do so!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Oh, speaking of which, have you heard which Servants have been selected to go with us yet?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> No, not yet.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Just that they&#39;ve narrowed it down to four.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Well, I&#39;m told the final decision was to bring Osakabehime, Scáthach-Skadi, and Xiang Yu.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Yikes. Talk about a recipe for chaos.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> That&#39;s gonna be a hell of a team...</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Some of them are relatively new additions, so I admit, I&#39;m a little concerned about how well they&#39;ll be able to work together.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> So, if there&#39;s only three of them, does that mean–</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I take it the fact that there&#39;s just three of them means</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes, that&#39;s right. Abby did make it to the final round, but Sion ultimately decided she wouldn&#39;t be a good fit.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Trismegistus II&#39;s suggestions this time were basically incomprehensible though, so they were difficult to interpret...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Still, Da Vinci said the data made it clear that this mission would just be too much for Abby, and she wouldn&#39;t be a good fit for the kind of battles we&#39;re likely to face.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Sion couldn&#39;t argue with that, so she agreed to take Abby off the roster, especially since doing so would also help conserve magical energy.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It&#39;s too bad. Abby was so disappointed when they told her she couldn&#39;t go...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> That is a shame, but Da Vinci definitely knows what she&#39;s talking about.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> (I&#39;ll have to bring her some pancakes later to cheer her up.)</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Anyway, Sion said she was going to pull an all-nighter so she could search all of Trismegistus II for entropy...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...but if you&#39;re ready to call it a day, Senpai,<br> you&#39;re more than welcome to turn in.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Uh, why do I feel like someone&#39;s staring at me?</p><hr><p><strong>B：???:</strong><br> (Staaare)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Speak of the devil.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Never mind. Mystery solved.</p><hr><p><strong>Abigail:</strong><br> (Staaare)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Hey there, young lady.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Having trouble sleeping?</p><hr><p><strong>Abigail:</strong><br> Master... I really am a naughty girl.</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong><br> I understand being taken off the mission, since it sounds like it would just be too much for me...</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong><br> But I still can&#39;t help but want to ride that big metal ship with you...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I wish I could bring you along, too. So next time, I will.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I&#39;ll bring you along next time. I promise.</p><hr><p><strong>Abigail:</strong><br> Really? Do you mean it?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Of course!</p><hr><p><strong>Abigail:</strong><br> That&#39;s wonderful...but...</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong><br> ...I still won&#39;t be able to see you for so long, and I&#39;m really going to miss you...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> (Oh, right in the feels.)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> (She really is anxious about this, isn&#39;t she?)</p><hr><p><strong>C：???:</strong><br> Oh hey, if it ain&#39;t Master and Abigail.<br> What&#39;re you two doin&#39; up this late?</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong><br> Oei? What are you doing here?</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong><br> Well, y&#39;know how Master&#39;s settin&#39; off in that big ol&#39; metal whale tomorrow, right? So I thought I&#39;d paint [♂ &#39;im /♀️ &#39;er] a treasure ship for good luck.</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong><br> But I sure didn&#39;t think I&#39;d find a fellow Foreigner lookin&#39; so blue. Say, how &#39;bout you paint with me?</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong><br> Me!? But, I couldn&#39;t. I&#39;m just<br> a child, and you&#39;re a famous–</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong><br> Don&#39;t you worry &#39;bout that. Ain&#39;t nothin&#39; quite like a picture painted by a kiddo.</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong><br> Sides, collaborations can be a blast, too.<br> Now go get your pastels and let&#39;s make some art!</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong><br> Ooh, that does sound like fun!<br> Are you sure? Can I, Master?</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong><br> Hmm. A treasure ship, huh... This would let me make<br> a wonderful good-luck charm for you, Master!</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong><br> ...Hey, Master? Sorry to ask ya this right before your big practice voyage, but do ya think you could stay up with us for a while?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Fine with me. Honestly, you&#39;re doing me a big favor here.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Of course. You&#39;re really good with kids, aren&#39;t you?</p><hr><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong><br> Ahahahaha! Well, that&#39;s a load offa my shoulders, hearin&#39; you say that. But hey, it&#39;s no biggie. Me an&#39; Toto-sama are just big ol&#39; kids at heart anyway.</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong><br> Besides, this Foreigner class we are&#39;s on a whole &#39;nother level, right? I mean, we&#39;re s&#39;posed to be a threat to all humanity, right?</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong><br> So if one of us Foreigners is in a bind, best thing we can do is help each other out.</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong><br> Anyway, now that that&#39;s settled, let&#39;s get goin&#39;! Oh, and if you get bored, ya can always take a gander at the picture scrolls I painted myself.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> At the ones YOU made!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I definitely want to check those out!</p><hr><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Sorry! I&#39;m sorry!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Am I late?</p><hr><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Morning, Fujimaru!<br> Hmm. Looks like you&#39;re right on time!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Well, technically, you were late by 0.008 seconds, but I&#39;ll be nice and let that slide! Now go on, get on board!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Hmph. Cutting it awfully close, aren&#39;t we,<br> Fujimaru? Did you even make time for breakfast this morning?</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Really now, any Master worth their salt would have arrived at least ten minutes ahead of schedule.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Seems that means you&#39;ve got a ways to go before you can call yourself a fully-fledged Master. Remember, you should be graceful and diligent in all matters.</p><p><strong>G：Sion:</strong><br> That is all well and good, Goredolf, but if I am not mistaken, I believe I saw you at the dock over an hour before departure.</p><p><strong>G：Sion:</strong><br> Nearly arriving late may be bad, but is it not also a problem to be too early?</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Gah! You saw me here, Sion!?</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> I-I mean, I was just taking a walk, that&#39;s all.<br> Yes, that&#39;s it. A little constitutional.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> It, um, certainly had nothing to do with any concern I have regarding the successful completion of the Nautilus&#39;s test run. Nope.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Anyway, listen well, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> The success of this test run will be the clearest indicator of whether we are actually able to infiltrate the Atlantic Lostbelt.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> It is therefore imperative that you not let yourself be distracted by thoughts like, “Oh boy, this new Nautilus is so much fun to ride!” or, “Man, submarines are so cool!”</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> ...And that you maintain your focus at all times to ensure the mission&#39;s success!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> You certainly haven&#39;t made it this far by neglecting your responsibilities, correct?</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Then you must continue in that responsible vein–<br> which includes being punctual–until you&#39;ve made it back safely! That&#39;s all!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Sir, yes sir!</p><hr><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Thank you for that masterful display of leadership, Goredolf. I especially appreciate your knack for brevity.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> If you had gone on any longer, I would have had to remind you that further remarks, inspiring though they may be, would only end up delaying the operation&#39;s commencement...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> ...but it seems I needn&#39;t worry about that today.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Haven&#39;t I already told you I&#39;ve had enough of you<br> mean-spirited interjections!? I may be a devout<br> oligarch, but I&#39;m also a staunch pacifist!</p><p><strong>F：Sion:</strong><br> The fact that you are all exchanging such witty banter this early in the morning just goes to show what seasoned veterans you Chaldeans truly are.</p><p><strong>F：Sion:</strong><br> If you are able to be so jocular under these circumstances, then it seems clear you do not need any advice from me.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Yeah, we haven&#39;t known each other all that long, but we&#39;ve still managed to overcome all sorts of hardships together.</p><p><strong>F：Sion:</strong><br> I see, I see. So you have shared good times and hard times alike. I suppose that is what comes from being stuck in the same boat, pun intended!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>G：Sion:</strong><br> But of course, that is also exactly why this training exercise is necessary.</p><p><strong>G：Sion:</strong><br> After all, as newcomers, neither Captain nor myself are at a point where we can joke with all of you as you are able to with one another.</p><p><strong>G：Sion:</strong><br> This trial run is an important mission to test the Nautilus&#39;s performance and limitations...</p><p><strong>G：Sion:</strong><br> ...but its secondary purpose is for Fujimaru and Captain to get to know and trust each other better.</p><p><strong>G：Sion:</strong><br> It is my hope that they will end up with just as strong a relationship as all of you, if not more so.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Hmph. Well if nothing else, I can tell you there&#39;s at least one idiot among our crew who already trusts Captain more than the rest of us.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> At any rate, Captain may be reticent, cold, and more likely to oil his gun than join in a conversation...</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> ...but given that he and Fujimaru will be working together to test the Nautilus&#39;s top speed and cornering capabilities, they simply won&#39;t be able to avoid becoming better friends.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Trust me, I went through the same thing with my navigator back in the Safari Rally.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> He did end up canceling on me at the last minute, though. I never did find out why...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Well, it seems to me like Fujimaru is already pretty fond of Captain, so I&#39;m sure this training exercise will go great.</p><p><strong>G：Sion:</strong><br> Oh? Then you do not find him off-putting,<br> Fujimaru? I guess you really are a seasoned veteran Master.</p><p><strong>G：Sion:</strong><br> I must say, I am a little jealous.<br> Let us not forget, Captain is still my Servant.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Oh? I&#39;m surprised to hear you of all people admit to jealousy, Ms. Sion. I do hope the all-nighter you pulled wasn&#39;t too arduous.</p><p><strong>G：Sion:</strong><br> Oh, no, I do not mind working all night. I am just a little concerned about the choice of Servant companions.</p><p><strong>G：Sion:</strong><br> I simply cannot figure out why Trismegistus II decided they were the best fit for this mission.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Er, just to be sure, are you quite certain we can trust this machine&#39;s analysis?</p><p><strong>G：Sion:</strong><br> Oh, I am not worried about that. I do not have to understand the equation to have faith in the results.</p><p><strong>G：Sion:</strong><br> Besides, if we were to have Trismegistus II write up its reasoning in a report...</p><p><strong>G：Sion:</strong><br> ...it would take us over half a year simply to decipher it.</p><p><strong>G：Sion:</strong><br> So no, my concerns are not about Trismegistus II, but about the environment in which such Servants will be necessary.</p><p><strong>G：Sion:</strong><br> For example, what sort of environment would lead to Abigail Williams being a recommended addition to the crew?</p><p><strong>G：Sion:</strong><br> Was removing her from the roster ultimately the correct choice? Those are the sorts of things I am worried about.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Hmm. I see your point, but since we can only afford to have three Servants come along, including her really wasn&#39;t an option.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Anyway, we should probably start getting ready for the next operation. It&#39;ll be a little while until we&#39;re done, so spend this time as you see fit.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> All right, I think I&#39;ve said everything I want to say for now. You&#39;re lucky we only have so much time until launch.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I&#39;m sorry. I&#39;ll be more careful in the future.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> (That might be the harshest scolding I&#39;ve ever had in my life.)</p><hr><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> I understand that, as a Master, caring for the younger Servants is an important part of your duties.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> But that&#39;s no excuse for tardiness. In the mission we&#39;re about to undertake, punctuality is of the utmost importance. There&#39;s no way to save a sailor who missed the boat, after all.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> So while you&#39;re on my ship, make damn sure you&#39;re on time for everything from now on. Is that clear?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Aye, aye, O Captain, my captain!</p><hr><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> “My captain”?<br> Never mind. Just get to your post...Acting Commander.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Um, it&#39;s still about an hour early for you to call me that...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Man, that&#39;s embarrassing...</p><hr><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Consider it a little payback.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Okay, Mash, stop clinging to Fujimaru<br> like a remora and get to your post.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> A remor–I mean, I&#39;m sorry, Captain! I was just reflecting on my failure to ensure Master got enough rest last night! It won&#39;t happen again!</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> How about the other passengers?<br> Are you all ready to set sail?</p><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> I am. As I have no Authority over the sea, I am happy to follow this child sea-god&#39;s instructions. Indeed, I am looking forward to being treated as just another passenger.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> No! No, I&#39;m not ready! But if Ma-chan wants me here, then I&#39;m gonna do my princessy best to be my usual hiko self, even in a submarine!</p><p><strong>Xiang Yu:</strong><br> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Huh? Are you nervous about this, Xiang Yu?</p><hr><p><strong>Xiang Yu:</strong><br> ...No. I am still operating within standard parameters.</p><p><strong>Xiang Yu:</strong><br> I was simply thinking about my beloved, and how she thrashed about on the floor in a tantrum when her fervent requests to accompany me on this mission were denied.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> That was...definitely a thing that happened, wasn&#39;t it?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> (I guess Xiang Yu&#39;s mind is elsewhere.)</p><hr><p><strong>Xiang Yu:</strong><br> Rest assured that I am perfectly able to carry out my primary directive. Master, Captain, I suggest we embark on our voyage without delay.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Excellent. Then let&#39;s get going!</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> This is the assault submarine Nautilus. Sion, report your final assessment of the shell&#39;s pressure-resistance.</p><p><strong>F：Sion:</strong><br> This is Sion at Novum Chaldea.<br> The hull is in perfect shape, of course.</p><p><strong>F：Sion:</strong><br> So, how are you feeling now, Captain?</p><p><strong>F：Sion:</strong><br> Would you say that my promise to provide a ship worthy of you has been fulfilled?</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> ...Yeah, it has. Thank you, Sion of Novum Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> I have not a single complaint about the ship. It&#39;s got the same amount of tension as a right whale&#39;s whiskers, perfectly balanced.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> And so I believe we&#39;re ready to set sail. That is all!</p><p><strong>F：Sion:</strong><br> Wooo! It is good to see you in high spirits, Captain! I am also very glad that I was finally able to keep my promise.</p><p><strong>F：Sion:</strong><br> All right then, I wish you an excellent maiden voyage. Do not worry about anything here while you are gone; I have your room locked up tight as a clam!</p><p><strong>F：Sion:</strong><br> Fujimaru, I am counting on you to take care of Captain for me while you are out in Void Space!</p><p><strong>F：Sion:</strong><br> While we will be unable to provide support this time, we will be rooting for you to have an experience that is truly out of this world!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I plan on it.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I&#39;ll do my best!</p><hr><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Open the vents! Commence standard dive!</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Hmm, that&#39;s one Quick-focused party...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> How&#39;s everyone doing?</p><hr><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Damn, no wonder Xiang Yu used to be the Hegemon-King of Western Chu! And with me and the goddess backing up his OP NP, I don&#39;t think anyone can touch him!</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Between the goddess buffing him with her powerful rune magecraft, and me filling in the gaps, I&#39;d say we&#39;ve got a killer team comp!</p><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> I&#39;m not so sure. Such a diverse makeup can easily lead to one becoming the proverbial jack-of-all-trades, master of none. Is there anything you can do to improve your Noble Phantasm&#39;s turnover rate, Osakabe?</p><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> As a Berserker, Xiang Yu requires precision support to keep fighting at his peak, so I expect you will need to vary your approach in battle until you find what works.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Ouch! Direct AND accurate constructive criticism!<br> Okay, I will do my ganbest!</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Sooo, Lord Xiang Yuuu, how did you like my NP? If you like, I would be mooore than happy to let you and your beloved tour Himeji Castle sometime.</p><p><strong>Xiang Yu:</strong><br> ...If we have reached the end of our training exercise, I would like to request a ten-minute break.</p><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> ...Perhaps he did not care for your<br> calling him “Hegemon-King,” Osakabe.</p><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> Also, your castle&#39;s defenses and Yu&#39;s Noble Phantasm are a poor match. Really, they do not fit together at all.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Nooo! My plan to ingratiate myself with him!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I don&#39;t think you did anything wrong, Batty.There&#39;s something off about Xiang Yu today.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> It wasn&#39;t you, Batty. Xiang Yu doesn&#39;t seem like himself.</p><hr><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> Do you think so? Truth be told, I still have trouble making sense of the expressions of metal men.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> (Sniff) Well, if you say so, Ma-chan,<br> you&#39;re probably right...</p><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> While Xiang Yu is clearly a cut above most Berserkers, I nonetheless cannot tell what he truly thinks, as I never encountered his like in Scandinavia.</p><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> I will therefore be relying on your judgment<br> even more than usual, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Anyway, guess we might as well take a break too. Plus, when we&#39;re done, it&#39;ll be the perfect time for an incident.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Good point.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Great job, Master!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I saw the whole simulation from here in the cockpit, and everyone&#39;s teamwork was impeccable!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I was giving it everything I had.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Now we just relax and wait.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Right. This next phase will require even more caution than usual.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> We&#39;re going to simulate encountering an unexpected hostile marine force during a shallow water dive, and practice making an emergency dive to Void Space to evade it.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> What&#39;s more, we&#39;ll be doing so entirely on our own.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> At this point, everyone back at the Wandering Sea Chaldea Base is still able to observe us, but once we make the dive into Void Space, we&#39;ll be completely cut off from them.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It&#39;s a little nerve-racking, but I know we&#39;ll do our best to handle anything that comes our way!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> On that note, I think I&#39;ll go over the navigation manual again, just to be sure. Please go ahead and relax, Senpai!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Phew...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> You know, I think I will take a breather while I can.</p><hr><p><strong>Xiang Yu:</strong><br> (Bustling around)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Xiang Yu&#39;s fiddling with some instruments...</p><hr><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> And now he&#39;s gone.</p><hr><p><strong>Xiang Yu:</strong><br> (Bustling around)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Nope, never mind. Now he&#39;s bringing in a big wooden crate...</p><hr><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> And he just left it there.</p><hr><p><strong>Xiang Yu:</strong><br> (Bustling around)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Now he&#39;s got an inkstone and a brush...</p><hr><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> And he&#39;s scribbling something on the wall...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Hold up. What&#39;s going on here!?</p><hr><p><strong>Xiang Yu:</strong><br> Master, I recommend you do not interfere. As you can see, even four hands are not enough to handle everything that must be done.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I&#39;m not gonna stop you, but I do have to ask what you&#39;re doing.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Captain&#39;s not gonna like this, you know.</p><hr><p><strong>Xiang Yu:</strong><br> Unfortunately, I have neither the time nor the processing power to explain at the moment.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I don&#39;t like the sound of that...but okay, I trust you.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> That sounds ominous... But all right.I&#39;m sure you know what you&#39;re doing.</p><hr><p><strong>Xiang Yu:</strong><br> Thank you, Master. Now, if you will excuse me.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> And just like that, he&#39;s gone... I wonder what those scribbles–er, symbols he wrote on the wall mean?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> W-well, knowing Xiang Yu, I&#39;m sure it has something to do with his prognosticative abilities.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> His actions may seem bizarre now, but in time, we&#39;ll find out there were good reasons for them...right?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I think so.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Yeah. Doesn&#39;t make it any less baffling, though.</p><hr><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> What&#39;s wrong with that Berserker!?</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> The moment I take my eyes off him, he&#39;s scurrying around like some kind of oversized spider crab and messing up my ship!</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> If we weren&#39;t about to undertake an operation, I&#39;d have him swabbing the deck all day!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Sorry about that, Captain!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I know you&#39;re mad, but please let him do what he thinks is best!</p><hr><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> ...Ahem.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> I&#39;m sorry. I&#39;m usually much better<br> at keeping my cool than that.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Don&#39;t worry. I always make sure I know who my passengers are before they board.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> I understand that Xiang Yu is actually much more intelligent than he looks. I do. But...</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Having a Berserker walking about doing whatever he pleases in my delicate ship still really gets on my nerves.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> And I mean that in a literal sense, since this Nautilus actually IS a part of me. Just keep that in mind, if you would.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I will, don&#39;t worry. Oh, isn&#39;t it about time?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Say, isn&#39;t it time to get going?</p><hr><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> So it is. Then let&#39;s get this emergency underway.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Training alert! Training alert! Silence on the line.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Hostile marine forces detected at zero-nine-zero!<br> All sensors detect an A-class combat threat!</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Commencing emergency Zero Sail evasive maneuver! I repeat, commencing emergency Zero Sail evasive maneuver!</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> We expect to emerge from Void Space in twelve hours!<br> Do you read me, Novum Chaldea!?</p><p><strong>F：Sion:</strong><br> This is Sion at Novum Chaldea reading you<br> loud and clear! Good luck, Nautilus!</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> End transmission! Nautilus personnel, get to your emergency stations to prepare for Zero Sail! All compartments, brace for turbulence!</p><p><strong>P.A. System:</strong><br> You got it, boss. Expanding Nautilus pressure hull<br> shock wave resistance theory.</p><p><strong>P.A. System:</strong><br> Removing existence verification for Reality Space.<br> Time to go floating together.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> It&#39;s so weird not having Da Vinci make those announcements...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I think I&#39;m finally starting to get nervous.</p><hr><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Here we go! Nautilus!</p><p><strong>P.A. System:</strong><br> Go ahead. Void Space Dive, Zero Sail: unfurl!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Looks like the Zero Sail went off without a hitch. I&#39;m especially glad to see Nemo&#39;s in good shape.</p><p><strong>F：Sion:</strong><br> Me too. The fact that you are not there to provide the upward compatible computational services you usually do has made him about thirty percent more fired up than usual.</p><p><strong>F：Sion:</strong><br> That is Captain for you. He has his own ways of handling responsibility.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> How about you? Think you&#39;ll be joining the next boarding exercise?</p><p><strong>F：Sion:</strong><br> No, I have my hands full taking care of Trismegistus II.</p><p><strong>F：Sion:</strong><br> That said, once this is all over, I would love to go on a little boating trip.</p><p><strong>F：Sion:</strong><br> But I would want to go before the Bleached Earth Phenomenon is resolved, since that would truly be going where no human has gone before.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Oho. An adventure with none other than Captain Nemo himself sounds truly delightful. Would you perchance have need of a great detective among your crew, Ms. Sion?</p><p><strong>Heroine XX:</strong><br> Don&#39;t you dare!</p><p><strong>Heroine XX:</strong><br> This is a matter solely between Master and Servant!<br> Our only place is to send them off with a smile!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Aah! Where&#39;d this Foreigner come from, and why does she look just like the one I saw during the strangest Hawaii vacation of my life!?</p><p><strong>Heroine XX:</strong><br> Me? I canceled a side gig–Ahem... I mean, personal matter to answer Master&#39;s summons.</p><p><strong>Heroine XX:</strong><br> But since now it looks like I won&#39;t be needed at all, I plan to drown my sorrows by spending this vacation diving into the sea under the dock!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> ...Huh? Why aren&#39;t you resident geniuses saying anything? Don&#39;t tell me I&#39;m the one who has to point out the ridiculousness of this so-called plan?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Oh, well, Ms. XX there is something of a...special case. Let&#39;s see, how can I put this...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> It&#39;s like...she&#39;s her own contextual Singularity? Impossible to analyze with anything approaching seriousness? Even attempting to do so just instantly devolves into a farce?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Agreed on all counts, Commander. Plus, as a Foreigner, things like logic and reason have little hold on her.</p><p><strong>G：Sion:</strong><br> I see. Now I understand (read: no longer care).</p><p><strong>G：Sion:</strong><br> Oh, but just to be clear, Captain is not subservient to me. He and I are equals.</p><p><strong>Heroine XX:</strong><br> Oh, really?</p><p><strong>Heroine XX:</strong><br> &#39;Cause I thought I heard you say you were jealous<br> of Fujimaru for getting along with him so well.</p><p><strong>F：Sion:</strong><br> Only in the sense that I wish Captain and I could have a traditional Master and Servant relationship.</p><p><strong>F：Sion:</strong><br> To be honest, I did not summon him to form a contract with him so much as to let the Phantom Spirit of Nemo materialize.</p><p><strong>F：Sion:</strong><br> So if Captain has decided that the Chaldeans are worth entrusting with the fate of humanity, then I am not at all surprised that he has also decided to switch teams, so to speak.</p><p><strong>F：Sion:</strong><br> All that aside, what is it you are doing here, anyway? You do know there is no space-time distorting Singularity active here, do you not?</p><p><strong>Heroine XX:</strong><br> Hahaha, c&#39;mon, Sion, that&#39;s no fair.</p><p><strong>Heroine XX:</strong><br> You make it sound like I never show up unless there&#39;s a Singularity to be solved.</p><p><strong>Heroine XX:</strong><br> No, I&#39;m just here for the same reason I always am:<br> &#39;cause I sensed it&#39;d be my turn soon.</p><p><strong>F：Sion:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> ...Hey, Sion? Just to make absolutely sure: You ARE certain there&#39;s nothing off about this mission, right?</p><p><strong>F：Sion:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>F：Sion:</strong><br> ...Well...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Hm? What are you so concerned about, Da Vinci?<br> All the conditions for this test run were perfect.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Everything from the passengers&#39; status verification to the cargo transport went off without a hitch.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> The Nautilus is in excellent condition, and<br> Fujimaru&#39;s crew is sailing the Void Sea, a place so dreadfully dull that the very concept of an incident taking place there is utterly unthinkable.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Now that our technology for navigating it is stable,<br> I daresay there is no safer course in all of creation.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> In fact, I&#39;ll go so far as to say that this training exercise is completely safe in every regard.</p><p><strong>Heroine XX:</strong><br> Yeah, exactly! I could tell as much just from the<br> dashing figure Fujimaru cut as [♂ he /♀️ she] headed off on the mission.</p><p><strong>Heroine XX:</strong><br> Trust me, every bone in this space cop&#39;s body is telling me this test run&#39;s gonna go perfectly!</p><p><strong>Heroine XX:</strong><br> Now, if you&#39;ll excuse me, I&#39;m off for some solo diving! Be back by dinner!</p><p><strong>Bridge Members:</strong><br> Hmmm?</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Er... While I don&#39;t wish to split hairs, especially given how cautious you&#39;ve all been thus far...perhaps it wouldn&#39;t hurt to try making double extra sure, just in case?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> I admit...I do feel like a black cat just crossed my path as I shattered a mirror while walking under a ladder, but...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> While I too am loath to say this, I must admit, it would be quite illogical to ignore the quite unintentional warning of a Heroic Spirit who was inscribed into the Throne for her intuition alone.</p><p><strong>G：Sion:</strong><br> Oops, sorry about that. Trismegistus II just finished its analysis. I admit, the timing is...</p><p><strong>G：Sion:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>G：Sion:</strong><br> Um, guys? Holmes especially?<br> You may want to sit down for this.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Oh? Please, enlighten us, Ms. Sion. What did our<br> beloved Spiritron Calculation Engine have to say?</p><p><strong>G：Sion:</strong><br> It would seem this is all a dream.</p><p><strong>Everyone:</strong><br> Huh???</p><h2 id="act-one-the-unknowable-reef-1-2" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#act-one-the-unknowable-reef-1-2" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Act One: The Unknowable Reef (1/2)</h2><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Looks like the dive was a success.</p><hr><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Of course it was. I&#39;m not about to let Da Vinci outdo me at steering my own ship.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Now, as promised, it&#39;s time to have some fun.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Great! I&#39;ll go ahead and switch gears!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Ahem... Today, at 13:30, the Nautilus encountered a hostile force. We proceeded to undertake evasive action in the form of a Zero Sail, thereby losing contact with Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Therefore, in accordance with the procedure for a Code Four incident, the Nautilus is now operating independently!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> During this time of emergency, Master<br> Fujimaru will serve as acting commander...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> And I, Mash Kyrielight, will serve as<br> [♂ his /♀️ her] acting v-vice commander!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> In accordance with these regulations, we have assumed command of the Nautilus. Any objections, Nemo?</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> This is Nemo. As captain of this vessel, I approve of the change in command.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> You&#39;re now officially the commander,<br> Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> That said, the ship&#39;s captain always retains sole authority over the ship&#39;s operations.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> If a captain were to order someone to get off their ship, that person would have to obey, even if they were the admiral of that ship&#39;s entire fleet.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> So while I&#39;ll certainly respect your orders as much as possible, I&#39;m also going to do everything I can to keep my ship safe.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Is that clear? If you issue too many strange or pointless orders, you&#39;re going to see me very, very angry.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I-I&#39;ll do my best.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I&#39;m already scared enough without your help!</p><hr><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Don&#39;t worry. As long as you do your job right,<br> I&#39;ll play along as obediently as a coral fish.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Now, moving on: this is going to sever my link to the Wandering Sea for a while, just like we planned.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> That means I&#39;m also going to lose my connection to Sion, effectively making me a Rogue Servant.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> I should be able to stick around longer than an average Servant thanks to my direct link to the ship&#39;s Magical Reactor, but I&#39;ll still be at risk of disappearing if I run out of magical energy.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> So if something happens to me, it&#39;ll be your responsibility to get everyone back to the surface–<br> Reality Space, that is.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> So, um... Since we already agreed on this and everything, I guess we should form a temporary contract.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> G-got it. All part of the mission, right?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> (Wow, I think I can actually feel the weight of all this responsibility...)</p><hr><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Hmm... That was pretty different than it was with Sion. It almost feels like I&#39;ve got a fishhook stuck in my gullet.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Anyway, this makes us officially Master and Servant,<br> though only temporarily.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Maybe this would be a good time to properly introduce you to all of us? Then again, you met everyone at the launch ceremony, so we can skip that if you like.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Would you like to be introduced to the Nemo Series? (You can skip this if you&#39;ve read their introductions in the main story.)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Yes</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> No (Skip)</p><hr><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Got it. Okay, everyone gather round! This&#39;ll also be a good time to introduce you all to the passengers!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Man, no matter how many times I see them all...</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It really is a breathtaking number<br> of people, isn&#39;t it, Senpai!?</p><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> Well, well, well...</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Ahaaa. Now I wakarunderstand.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Let me introduce you to everyone again. This here crew is the very lifeblood of the Nautilus.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> I call them...the Nemo Series!</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Let&#39;s start with the Nemo Marines. They steer the ship and man the radar. For this voyage, I&#39;ve got twelve of them in constant rotation.</p><p><strong>Nemo Marine:</strong><br> Hi, everyone! Hi, Master! We&#39;re doing our very best, so please don&#39;t be mad if we mess up!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> G-got it.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Hi, Nemos!</p><hr><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Next, we&#39;ve got Nemo Nurse. She runs the medical bay, and she&#39;s an old hand when it comes to treating injuries.</p><p><strong>Nemo Nurse:</strong><br> Hello. I&#39;m both a nurse and a doctor, and I sincerely hope I won&#39;t be needed at all.</p><p><strong>Nemo Nurse:</strong><br> But if I am, rest assured that my Medicine skills are all ranked A, so please don&#39;t hesitate to come see me should you get hurt.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I definitely don&#39;t want to get hurt, but if I do,it&#39;s great to know I&#39;ll be in good hands.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I feel better already!</p><hr><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Next, we&#39;d usually have Nemo Baker...but she won&#39;t be joining us for this mission, since the Border doesn&#39;t have enough space for a full kitchen.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> But don&#39;t worry, Master. To make up for that, she freeze-dried and vacuum-packed some yummy meals in case you get hungry.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> We&#39;ve also got a nice selection of drinks if you&#39;d care for one. And if any of you adult Servants would care for a cocktail, just let me know, and I&#39;ll make you one.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I&#39;m just grateful there&#39;s anything to eat at all.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Making cocktails sounds like fun. Maybe I&#39;ll help you.</p><hr><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Next, we have Nemo Professor, the most eccentric of the bunch.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Even I don&#39;t understand how she can be so laid-back all the time, but I&#39;ve given her as much of my brainpower as I can afford to allocate.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> She&#39;ll have numerous important roles to fulfill during this exercise, including research and strategy development.</p><p><strong>Nemo Professor:</strong><br> Yes, hello, I&#39;m Nemo Professor, the one who&#39;s so laid-back as to apparently not merit a particularly enthusiastic introduction.</p><p><strong>Nemo Professor:</strong><br> You actually already heard me on the P.A. system earlier, so feel free to say hi if you see me around. I don&#39;t mind a little elbow rubbing, either.</p><p><strong>Nemo Professor:</strong><br> I&#39;m manning the computer room on this mission, but I&#39;m not as good at steering this ship as Da Vinci, so don&#39;t expect me to pull off any crazy maneuvers or anything.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> G-got it.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Those glasses look really good on you!</p><hr><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> And finally, we&#39;ve got Nemo Engineer. She&#39;s in charge of the engine room, which is almost literally the beating heart of the ship.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> She has as many responsibilities on this ship as I do, so you can think of her as a shadow captain of sorts.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Be careful about giving any orders that&#39;ll strain the ship. That&#39;ll make Engineer angry, and you wouldn&#39;t like her when she&#39;s angry.</p><p><strong>Nemo Engineer:</strong><br> The hell&#39;re you talkin&#39; about, Cap bastard!? Here, I&#39;ll make it real simple: overloading my ship is evil!</p><p><strong>Nemo Engineer:</strong><br> Lemme give you a word of warning too, Temporary Master: the only way you and your pals are gonna get to enjoy your fancy-schmancy boat trip&#39;s if the engine&#39;s running smooth as butter.</p><p><strong>Nemo Engineer:</strong><br> Also, it gets crazy hot in the engine room, so don&#39;t forget to send down water or some ice cream that won&#39;t melt too quickly on the regular!</p><p><strong>Nemo Engineer:</strong><br> Remember, you piss me off, and the Nautilus is done for!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You&#39;re so cool!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I&#39;ve always thought engineers were cool,and you just proved it beyond any doubt!</p><hr><p><strong>Nemo Engineer:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Nemo Engineer:</strong><br> I-I see. Well, yeah, I guess I am pretty cool.<br> Well, me, and engineers in general.</p><p><strong>Nemo Engineer:</strong><br> Tch. You&#39;re kind of a weirdo,<br> aren&#39;t ya, Temporary Master?</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> True, Fujimaru&#39;s appetite for adventure<br> is a little bigger than I was expecting.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Anyway, between the twelve marines, Engineer, Professor, Nurse, and me, we have sixteen crew members altogether.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> And that&#39;s the Nemo Series lineup who&#39;ll be manning the ship for our training exercise today.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> They&#39;re the heart, brains, and blood of the Nautilus, keeping it running smoothly at all hours of the day.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> The better you can get along with them,<br> the more homey this ship&#39;ll be.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Don&#39;t have to tell me twice!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Can&#39;t wait to get to know you all better!</p><hr><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Okay, dismissed! All hands, return to your stations!</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Hey, Captain? Those sailors aren&#39;t familiars or anything like that, right?</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Given how you just talked about them, I&#39;m guessing they&#39;re clones? Did you partition your mind and give one partition to each individual personality or something?</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> I can&#39;t go into the details too much since I&#39;m using Sion&#39;s patented technique, but you&#39;re essentially correct.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Technically speaking, they&#39;re all still me.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> I just divided the work involved in running the ship among them to avoid confusion and ensure there&#39;d always be enough hands to go around.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Of course, they all have their own distinct personalities, since that&#39;s the bare minimum required for them to act autonomously.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Well, except for the marines; they all have basically the same personality. You can think of them as one person sharing twelve bodies.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> I also gave each of the Series their own private memory space, so we really are equals in the true sense of the word.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> The only hierarchy we adhere to is the one required for any chain of command to function.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Wooowie. I know you&#39;re not making a big deal about it, but man, the Atlas Institute really is sugoi.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> I tried something similar with my origami once, but I broke my brain pretty much right away.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Anyway, now that the formalities are out of the way, it&#39;s time to get to work.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Your first job as acting commander will be to see each part of the Nautilus in action for yourself.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> After that, I&#39;ve put together a training program for you that will brief you on the process of emerging into Reality Space.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Finally, you&#39;ll practice undersea warfare in the simulator. I&#39;ll be joining you for that part.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> I know it&#39;s a lot to get through, but once you do, there will be a delicious dinner awaiting you.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I&#39;ll do my best.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I&#39;m looking forward to our first training session together.</p><hr><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Just what I like to hear.<br> All right, no time like the present to–</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Report! What&#39;s going on!?</p><p><strong>Nemo Marine:</strong><br> You rang?<br> Huh? There&#39;s an alarm going off!?</p><p><strong>Nemo Marine:</strong><br> Sorry &#39;bout that! I was just taking a break since we can&#39;t use sonar in Void Space, so it wasn&#39;t me!</p><p><strong>Nemo Marine:</strong><br> Maybe the Professor did it?</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Professor?</p><p><strong>Nemo Professor:</strong><br> Nope, it wasn&#39;t me, either.</p><p><strong>Nemo Professor:</strong><br> I&#39;m guessing it might&#39;ve been the bridge.<br> Maybe you should check the admin console there?</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Hm? That&#39;s weird. The sonar we use in Reality Space is...active.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Hold up. Did you just say sonar? As in, echolocation? I&#39;m our resident bat expert, so doesn&#39;t that mean–</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Yup. This alarm is telling us we&#39;re about to run aground.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Gyaa! I knew it! C-c-come on, Captain, what&#39;re you<br> waiting for!? Don&#39;t we gotta be all “evasive starboard” or something!?</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> It&#39;s okay, Osakabehime. We&#39;re in Void Space, remember? There is no ground here.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Ugh. I&#39;ve never been able to wrap my head around this meta magecraft stuff, especially when it comes to Void and Reality space.</p><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> Unlike my Norse mythology&#39;s dualistic worldview, other religions tend to think of the early stages of existence as primordial chaos.</p><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> They saw it as a writhing, seething mass of everything in the world all mixed together–land, water, heat, cold, good, evil, and so on–thereby harboring limitless possibilities.</p><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> In one sense, Void Space is similar, in that it too possesses untold possibilities.</p><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> But unlike primordial chaos, which accomplishes this by mixing everything together at once, I believe Void Space does so by being unobservable.</p><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> That is to say, this is the Reverse Side of the World, a completely opaque domain where not even established laws of physics can be glimpsed.</p><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> As a result, there is no possibility here that cannot be assumed to exist in some form.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Hang on. Did you say “unobservable”?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> So, if it can&#39;t be observed, why are weable to see outside the window right now?</p><hr><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> Ah, an insightful question. The truth is, we are not actually seeing this rainbow-colored vortex, at least in the true sense of the word.</p><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> Under normal circumstances, the reality we belong to and the void of this domain cannot interact.</p><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> While we are able to “see” this void thanks to the Zero Sail&#39;s engineering, it cannot overcome the insurmountable gap that still lies between us.</p><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> Thus, our senses are only able to experience false impressions of the void, making this rainbow sight no more than a hallucination.</p><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> As a matter of fact, you and I are not even seeing the same rainbow when we look out that window.</p><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> Conversely, if there were any beings who called Void Space home, they would no doubt be unable to observe our world as it truly is, either.</p><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> So long as this insurmountable gap exists, Reality Space and Void Space will remain fundamentally incompatible and unable to interact with each other.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I see. Or rather, I don&#39;t see, huh...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> By the way, Ms. Skadi, should we be worried about that alarm?</p><hr><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> Very well, my pupil, listen closely.</p><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> According to the gods&#39; explanation, it is impossible for us to see or touch anything that belongs to the unobservable domain.</p><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> Therefore, it should also be impossible for us to detect any manner of obstacle here, let alone be obstructed by one in any real sense. I believe our captain here already said as much.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Yeah, that&#39;s right. While there are technically some shock waves on the mirror world plane of existence that could theoretically be obstructions, we&#39;ve already calculated a way around them.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> So I&#39;m guessing this alarm is just some kind of glitch caused by the Berserker messing with things he shouldn&#39;t. Hmph.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Come to think of it, Xiang Yu wasn&#39;t around for the Nemo Series&#39; introduction, either. I swear, what could he be thinking?</p><p><strong>Xiang Yu:</strong><br> You wished to see me, Captain?</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Aah!? You&#39;re actually here, Xiang Yu!?</p><p><strong>Xiang Yu:</strong><br> I apologize for my absence, and for the insufficient explanation I&#39;m about to give you.</p><p><strong>Xiang Yu:</strong><br> Everyone, cover your ears.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Wha...? (Said while quickly moving to cover your ears.)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> (Cover your ears even as you wonder what&#39;s going on.)</p><hr><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> (Eek!)</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> (Gwaaah! My eaaars!)</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> (What&#39;s he up to this time!?)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> (A-are you all right, Senpai!?)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> (I can&#39;t hear what anyone&#39;s saying, but I think I can guess.)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> (I only see their mouths moving,but I&#39;m pretty sure I get the gist.)</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> (Huh? Now Xiang Yu is taking the bundle of bamboo he&#39;s holding... No, wait, it&#39;s a brush! And he&#39;s drawing something with it at incredible speed, all while continuing to shout at the top of his lungs!)</p><p><strong>Xiang Yu:</strong><br> There is nothing more I can do.<br> Here, Master, take this.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Oh, uh, okay.</p><hr><p><strong>Xiang Yu:</strong><br> As my body will be quite unsuited for this upcoming battle, I opted to take numerous advance measures to prepare for it. My apologies once again for doing so with neither permission nor explanation.</p><p><strong>Xiang Yu:</strong><br> I implore you to hit the brakes and open the box. In the meantime, I will sleep until I am needed once again, so that I may better conserve energy.</p><p><strong>Xiang Yu:</strong><br> ...Good luck, Master.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I&#39;m not sure I can recall Xiang Yu ever saying anything like “Good luck” before, Senpai...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Acting Vice Commander, Captain...let&#39;s stop the ship.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Guys? I think we should stop the ship.</p><hr><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> ...Were you not listening earlier, Master?<br> There are no obstacles in Void Space. None.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Every one of the Nemo Series agrees that this is just an equipment malfunction. The only thing we&#39;re worried about is you letting that Berserker jerk you around.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Even so...I&#39;d still like you to stop the ship.</p><hr><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> ...All right. But only because you&#39;re the commander now. Engine room, full reverse. Emergency stop.</p><p><strong>Nemo Engineer:</strong><br> Tch! An emergency stop when there ain&#39;t a damn thing in the way!? Fine, fine. Triton Wheel, reverse!</p><p><strong>Nemo Marine:</strong><br> Roger that!</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> It&#39;s going to be a little bumpy,<br> so you may all want to hang on to the–</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Waaah! Nooow whaaat!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> U-um, Captain!?<br> Is stopping a submarine usually this violent!?</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> No! I don&#39;t know how, but...we&#39;ve run aground!</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Hang in there, everyone!<br> Nemo Series, damage report ASAP!</p><p><strong>Nemo Engineer:</strong><br> Engine room here, that impact knocked a few of us out! Dammit, what idiot put a reef in the Void Sea!?</p><p><strong>Nemo Nurse:</strong><br> Infirmary here, all my equipment is still working fine, so let me know if we have any casualties.</p><p><strong>Nemo Marine:</strong><br> Observation room here! We&#39;ve got a huge crack in the outer shell, and we&#39;re taking on wat–er...rainbows!</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> We&#39;re WHAT!?</p><p><strong>Nemo Professor:</strong><br> Computer room here. Things aren&#39;t looking great. Whatever we hit has pierced the hull and lodged itself inside...</p><p><strong>Nemo Professor:</strong><br> Also, I&#39;m trapped under some equipment that got knocked ov–Wait. What the...!? How is the void flooding in here? That shouldn&#39;t be possible!</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Impossible... Then our observation of the void is converging!? Professor! What&#39;s going to happen if we don&#39;t do something to stop the flood!? Give it to me as simple as you can!</p><p><strong>Nemo Professor:</strong><br> Simply? We&#39;ll all be wiped out...<br> Out, out, ou ou ou o o o o</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> ...Abandon lower compartments four through six! All hands, I want all bulkheads to abandoned compartments welded shut! Erect an observation-disrupting Bounded Field as soon as they&#39;re done!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Whoa, whoa, hold on!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> What about Professor, and that marine!?</p><hr><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> I can always clone them again! I might have to deal with some mental damage from the fear and pain they&#39;ll experience, but–</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> By my Command Spell...both of you, get up here NOW!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Professor, Marine, to the bridge on the double!</p><hr><p><strong>Nemo Marine:</strong><br> Wh-wh-whoa... I-I&#39;m saved!</p><p><strong>Nemo Professor:</strong><br> Yay, I&#39;m still alive. I might have peed myself a little, but please don&#39;t hold it against me.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> A-are you nuts!? Just because you can restore them with the Nautilus&#39;s Magical Reactor Core, that doesn&#39;t mean you should be so quick to use Command Spells–</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I already promised I was going to befriend you.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I&#39;m not going to just let you, or any ofthe Nemo Series, die if I can stop it.</p><hr><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> I see. That explains a lot, actually. Thank you, Acting Commander–No, Master.</p><p><strong>Nemo Marine:</strong><br> What WAS that, Captain!? Why was I drowning in rainbows, of all things!? Also, I think I was starting to lose my mind while that was happening!</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> This shouldn&#39;t be possible, but...the only explanation that makes sense is that Void Space is somehow observable now.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> What do you mean?</p><hr><p><strong>Nemo Professor:</strong><br> Like that goddess lady said earlier, under normal circumstances, there shouldn&#39;t be any possible way for us to properly observe the void.</p><p><strong>Nemo Professor:</strong><br> If you asked a hundred people to describe what they saw, you&#39;d get a hundred different answers, none of which you&#39;d be able to verify in any way.</p><p><strong>Nemo Professor:</strong><br> So, void entities always maintain their unobservability, making it absolutely impossible for reality and void to interact. At least, that&#39;s how it&#39;s supposed to be, but–</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> If someone, or something, changed Void Space in a way so that everyone who observed it saw the exact same rainbow vortex, then both reality and the void would each be able to observe the other.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> And that would cause those of us from reality,<br> and this world of void, to start...bugging out.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Bugging out?</p><hr><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Listen, every human sense and ability to process information we developed over thousands of years–<br> that is, our senses and even our connection to the world–would go haywire.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Umm... Do you think you can you put it any simpler!?</p><hr><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> ...Okay, fine. Either we go completely mad, or the world around us does.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> More specifically, our perception of the world, or perhaps the world itself, would become twisted beyond recognition. Proving which of the two was being affected would be impossible, but either way, the result is the same: total annihilation.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Suffice to say, we can no longer look at any light coming in from the outside, we can&#39;t afford to touch it, and we definitely can&#39;t let it flood the ship.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> As of this point, we can no longer count on Void Space&#39;s unobservability to keep us safe. The world outside the pressure hull and our Bounded Field is now just as deadly and hostile as the deep sea!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Just...wow. I had no idea Void Space was so scary!</p><hr><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Of course it is! Any kind of completely unobservable domain you can imagine was never going to be anything less than the stuff of apocalyptic nightmares!</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> But even so, this was supposed to be the safest sea in the world to dive into, if only because I thought we wouldn&#39;t have to worry about reefs–the bane of submarine crews everywhere!</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Well, so much for that! Dammit, I knew we should&#39;ve at least finished developing the ship&#39;s defensive barriers!</p><p><strong>Nemo Engineer:</strong><br> Bridge here! We just finished sealing off the bulkheads, and the ship&#39;s come to a complete stop! The rest is up to you!</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> ...Right! First of all, we need to prepare for a low-speed emerge–</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Oh come on, nani the hell is it noooooow!?</p><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> (Collapsed in white-eyed shock)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> No way... Are we under attack!?</p><p><strong>Nemo Marine:</strong><br> We sure are, Acting Vice Commander! Incoming attack to our portside pressure hull, bearing three-two-three! The barrage looks to be about as strong as a C-rank Noble Phantasm!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> A C-rank Noble Phantasm... That puts it in the same league as Mori&#39;s Ningen Mukotsu and Kintoki&#39;s Golden Spark!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Well, that sounds pretty not great.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> That&#39;s bad, I&#39;m guessing?</p><hr><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Of course it&#39;s bad. I mean, we&#39;re okay for the moment, but... An attack? In Void Space? What could possibly be attacking us?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Never mind how things are supposed to work here.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Let&#39;s just focus on getting out of the bind we&#39;re in right now.</p><hr><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> I know, but we don&#39;t have any means of fighting back! When we sealed off the lower decks, we also lost our entire stock of torpedoes!</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> And even if we hadn&#39;t, how are we supposed to fire them in Void Space!? We never dreamed combat here was even possible, let alone that we&#39;d be forced to engage in it!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> (Oh man, oh man... Come on, . Keep it together!)</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Master, wait! I just remembered!<br> Didn&#39;t Xiang Yu also tell you to open the box!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> That&#39;s it!</p><hr><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I-is this...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> M-Mash&#39;s swimsuit...?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Wh-what&#39;s one of my outfits doing in here!? ...Wait. Master, look! There&#39;s also a note with some familiar-looking handwriting inside!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> “Hellooo Senpai☆<br> You just can&#39;t help getting into trouble, can you?”</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> “Well, lucky for you, your considerate, capable kouhai foresaw such an occasion, and decided to send you a little secret weapon to help you out of it☆”</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> “Unfortunately, I didn&#39;t have time to make more than one since your oversized mecha friend Xiang Yu sprung the order on me at the eleventh hour.”</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> “Hey, do me a favor and tell him to give me a heads-up about these things ahead of time next time, &#39;kay♡”</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> “In the meantime, I really want to be able to deny any involvement in this latest incident, so I&#39;ll be off on the Far Side of the Moon shoring up my alibi. Good luck♡<br> Yours truly, BB”</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> It&#39;s a gift from the moon demon!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Put it on, Mash! Put it on right now!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> H-huh!? You want me to change into this swimsuit!? Here!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Sorry, but there&#39;s no time! I&#39;m going to use a Command Spell!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Don&#39;t worry! I&#39;ll have you change in a flashand put up a light curtain for privacy!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I-I can&#39;t say I&#39;m entirely okay with this, but there, I&#39;m all changed, Master! Although, I still don&#39;t see why I–</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Mash?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The sea...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The sea is calling to me!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Captain! Permission to use the ship&#39;s air lock!?</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Y-you don&#39;t mean–</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I do. I don&#39;t know what BB did to this swimsuit, but I think I can move about in this sea just like any other now!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> So I&#39;ll go out and fend off the attacks myself!<br> Don&#39;t worry! I&#39;m not a Shielder for nothing!</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Thank goodness we made it through that...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Well, time to face the music.(By which I mean an angry Mash...)</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I do have things I&#39;d like to say about my forced swimsuit change, but that can wait until later. For now, I can at least say this outfit BB gave us works extremely well.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Not only does it let me perceive Void Space as easily as I can Reality Space, it even feels like it&#39;s boosting my physical capabilities.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That said, I still wasn&#39;t able to get a visual on the enemies attacking us. All I could do was flail around at random and use my Noble Phantasm...</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> That&#39;s waaay better than nothing. I don&#39;t even wanna think about what might&#39;ve happened if we hadn&#39;t had that.</p><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> Then, Xiang Yu and our ally from the moon must have foreseen this predicament in far greater detail than we imagined...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Take it easy, Scáthach-Skadi, you were out so hardyou were practically drooling not too long ago.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> It&#39;s okay to rest a bit longer if you need to, Scáthach-Skadi.</p><hr><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> ...Hmm.</p><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> Very well, I think I will rest a bit longer then.<br> Worry not, I am still listening. Yes...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Xiang Yu seems like he would know what&#39;s going on, but he&#39;s shut himself inside his room and isn&#39;t responding to any of our questions.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The only thing he said before entering sleep mode was that he was doing so to conserve energy.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Yeah. It looks like he was right about everything.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> The sections we abandoned contained our computers, navigational equipment, torpedoes, food, and most of our magical energy resources.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> With all of them gone, the Nautilus will only be operational for about one-hundred and fifty more hours.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Xiang Yu must have known that maintaining Servants&#39; materializations constantly consumes small amounts of magical energy, and taken what measures he could to make up for that...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I just wish he&#39;d given us a hint about what was going to happen.</p><hr><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> He must have been so focused on his calculations that he couldn&#39;t spare the time.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Anyway, the fact remains that if it wasn&#39;t for him, we probably wouldn&#39;t be here now. I can&#39;t believe I ever doubted you, General Xiang Yu...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Wow, you made a complete one-eighty on him!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> General Xiang Yu, huh.</p><hr><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> When you realize you&#39;ve been wrong, you admit it as soon as possible. That is a law of life at sea.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> ...Not that it&#39;s going to make up for my idiocy now.<br> (Siiigh)</p><p><strong>Nemos:</strong><br> (Siiigh)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Oh no! The Nemo Series are all depressed!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Come on, Nemo Series! Cheer up!</p><hr><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> ...If you&#39;re still that optimistic about our situation, Acting Commander, maybe I need to revisit just how bad things are right now for you.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Our ship has run aground on a void reef (ridiculous as that sounds) and now we&#39;re stranded.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> We can still move, but only just. What&#39;s more, we can only use our legs, so to speak, since our sonar and torpedoes are gone.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> To keep the body metaphor going, we&#39;ve lost our eyes, our ears, and our arms. Though I suppose we can at least blindly stumble about.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> And if that wasn&#39;t bad enough, we&#39;ve also been attacked by a mysterious enemy with attacks as strong as midrange Noble Phantasms. So now, we need to evade this enemy, and the reef, without nearly enough in the way of food or fuel.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> We&#39;re left with two rather unappealing options: wait here to die, or run around blindly until we die. So forgive me if we&#39;re not exactly bursting with enthusiasm.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I get that you&#39;re worried, Nemo. But it&#39;s going to be okay.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I understand. But things are still going to work out somehow.</p><hr><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> ...?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Captain, the acting commander is fully aware that our current situation is dire.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> But we&#39;ve found ourselves in seemingly hopeless situations before, and we always managed to pull through.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> And we didn&#39;t do so alone. We wouldn&#39;t be here now if it wasn&#39;t for Chaldea&#39;s staff, the Heroic Spirits, and the people we met on our travels.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Even here, we&#39;ve already received help from the moon despite being cut off from Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> So remember, we&#39;re not the only ones here. There&#39;s also you, the Nemo Series, Osakabehime, Scáthach-Skadi... Suffice to say, we&#39;re far from alone.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Y-yeah. I know I was kind of freaking out earlier, but with things this yabad, I&#39;m ready to do my part!</p><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> On which note, I suppose I can no longer simply lie down on the job. It is time I got serious.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> ...You&#39;re right. I shouldn&#39;t have been so quick to succumb to fatalism.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> All right then, Mash and Fujimaru, let&#39;s look for the silver lining in these dark clouds.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Well, first off, there&#39;s this bamboo scroll Xiang Yu left for us. I think this is what people in ancient China used to take notes.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> At any rate, it contains an incredibly detailed diagram of some sort. It looks like a navigational chart.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Say, I just had a thought. Maybe that super-loud yelling was actually him doing some kind of echolocation scan?</p><p><strong>Nemo Professor:</strong><br> Let me see that... Hmm. If you&#39;re right about what this is, it looks like there&#39;s a pretty intricate oceanic trench here. In fact, it kind of looks like a maze.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The chart even shows our current location, the route we should take, and a mark indicating what appears to be our destination. Maybe this could help us escape?</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> As if he hadn&#39;t already helped us enough... Then again, I suppose I should expect no less from him.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Still, this only makes the loss of our sonar and torpedoes all the more painful. It would be one thing if they were still repairable, but with them gone completely, well...</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Unfortunately, we also don&#39;t have any of the engineering know-how or facilities we would need to make new advanced electric and Spiritron equipment from the machinery we still have on hand.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> So, Acting Commander, what do you think we should do next?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Find someone to help us, either locally or via summoning.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Look for someone here who can help us, or summon someone who can.</p><hr><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> ...I see. Normally, I&#39;d be pretty dubious about the prospect of finding anyone in Void Space, let alone someone who could help us...</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> ...but since we&#39;ve already run into reefs and enemies here, it seems clear that the usual rules no longer apply.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> As for the summoning option, we&#39;ll need to be very careful if we take that route. Like I said before, it costs energy just to keep a Servant materialized.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Honestly, keeping too many Servants around would be extremely risky even if the ship were in perfect condition.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Not to mention there might be circumstances where we need to shut off the Magical Reactors.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> But we also can&#39;t deny that having someone here help us make new versions of the lost equipment would improve our situation dramatically.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It&#39;s also the only strategy we can actively pursue given the current circumstances, so that alone may make it worth trying.</p><p><strong>Nemo Professor:</strong><br> I just ran the numbers. With Xiang Yu sleeping, we should have enough energy to keep another Servant around no problem.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> I guess that settles it, then. In that case,<br> Fujimaru, I have something important to tell you, and a suggestion to make.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Remember, we&#39;re not in a Lostbelt or a Singularity.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Void Space or not, we&#39;re still in the Wandering Sea...<br> which means we&#39;re also still on Chaldea Base premises.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> And while we may have suffered some significant damage, we still have Magical Reactors and a Servant handling computer duties.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> That makes this ship something of a Chaldea branch office, which means you can use the Spirit Origin graph for this summon.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> So then, I can call on either a Chaldean Servant,or one I&#39;ve formed a connection with before?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> In other words, I can summon a Chaldean Servant,or one I&#39;ve bonded with in the past?</p><hr><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> That&#39;s right. Which means we can summon a Servant we know we can trust, and who has the skills we need.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Performing an additional summon during a Nautilus voyage would normally be unthinkable, but in this case I think it&#39;s an acceptable risk.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> That&#39;s also why we need to be extremely careful about who we choose to summon. So my suggestion is to let Professor make that choice.</p><p><strong>Nemo Professor:</strong><br> My suggestion is temporarily activating the personnel selection routine Sion implanted in my mind to arrive at the best possible choice.</p><p><strong>Nemo Professor:</strong><br> The upside of this approach is that it&#39;d let us almost completely eliminate any risk of our making a mistake and choosing the wrong Servant.</p><p><strong>Nemo Professor:</strong><br> The downside is... Well, I&#39;ve never run this protocol before, so I&#39;m more than a little nervous.</p><p><strong>Nemo Professor:</strong><br> Oh, and also, Sion&#39;s routine has been known to make some incomprehensible personnel choices before, as I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve seen for yourself, Master.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Like the four Servants she chose for this mission...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Like Abby...</p><hr><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Right. Still, as General Xiang Yu&#39;s exploits here proved, there are ultimately good reasons behind those choices.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> So, what do you think, Fujimaru?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I&#39;m on board.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I&#39;ll let Nemo Professor handle the selection.</p><hr><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> All right. I don&#39;t see any reason to refuse, so...<br> As Captain, I officially endorse this plan to summon help!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Let&#39;s do it!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Lend me your shield, Mash!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Right, Senpai!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Huh!? This class signal... Is that–</p><p><strong>I：???:</strong><br> Hao haooo♪ I heard someone summoning and thought<br> I&#39;d try answering it! I&#39;m Yu-Yu, a Foreigner!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Yu-Yu!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Do I know Yu, Yu-Yuerm, you!?</p><hr><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> (...Huh? Have I actually met her before?)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> (For some reason, I feel like I have some vague memories of her...)</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I-if I may, Senpai, I don&#39;t believe we know this Heroic Spirit! Are you a court musician? Does anyone here recognize her?</p><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> Judging from her clothing, and her choice of greeting, she would seem to be a Heroic Spirit from somewhere in Proper Human History&#39;s Asia...</p><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> But never mind that now. What happened to summoning a Chaldean Servant, Professor?</p><p><strong>Nemo Professor:</strong><br> Yeah, this is weird.<br> Give me a sec while I check the logs...</p><p><strong>Nemo Professor:</strong><br> ...Hmm. It looks like the personnel selection routine ran into an error while it was searching for aptitude, and failed to use the Spirit Origin graph to narrow down the possible summons.</p><p><strong>Nemo Professor:</strong><br> That cause the Heroic Spirit control program to glitch out, so it ended up summoning a Heroic Spirit from the usual Throne instead.</p><p><strong>Nemo Professor:</strong><br> I suppose this just emphasizes how important it is to test things like this ahead of time. Lesson learned.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> So... We had a summoning accident?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> So... Chaldea didn&#39;t have the ideal helper we need after all?</p><hr><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Dammit. Our only hope, down the drain...<br> No, not yet. I refuse to give up just yet!</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Yu-Yu, you must be an accomplished Heroic Spirit, right!? Would you please tell us your True Name and special skills!?</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Hmm. You guys do seem like you&#39;re in a pretty tight spot, but, my T-True Name? Right off the bat? I don&#39;t know...</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Uso... I can totally tell...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Tell what?</p><hr><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> This genuine nobility and elegance shining through even as she attempts to hide it behind a friendly demeanor... I&#39;ll call it PDF (Princess Dominion Force) for short...</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> As a point of comparison, I have a PDF level of two...and hers must be at least three-hundred thirty-six thousand!!!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Oh crap! Batty&#39;s broken!</p><hr><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Even in Chaldea, which is its own kind of jigoku thanks to all the high PDF princesses running around there, the only other one with a PDF level in the six digits is Lady Cleopatra!!!</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> So this beautiful lady from China with enough PDF to rival one of the greatest empresses of all time, can...only...be...</p><p><strong>I：???:</strong><br> ...Uh, yes, I guess you&#39;re right.</p><p><strong>I：???:</strong><br> My True Name is Yang Yuhuan, though<br> I usually go by my nickname, Yu-Yu.</p><p><strong>I：???:</strong><br> Historically, um...I guess I&#39;m probably better known as Yang Guifei...</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> Oh gosh, this is so embarrassing...<br> Um, nice to meet you all, I guess?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> (Huh? Have I heard this introduction before?)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> (I could swear I&#39;ve dreamed about this...)</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I recognize that name! Yang Guifei was known far and wide as a peerless beauty during China&#39;s Tang dynasty, when she became Emperor Xuanzong&#39;s queen consort!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It&#39;s said that she set a hundred men&#39;s hearts aflame with a single smile, and she was also highly proficient in numerous fine arts! Is that why she has a musical instrument with her!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Anyway, that&#39;s Yang Guifei in a nutshell. She&#39;s a beauty so stunning she influenced all of China–a true woman of the people!</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> Nooo! Please, no more! I&#39;m nothing like that, really! I&#39;m just a commoner! The same nondescript lychee-loving village girl you&#39;d find anywhere!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> And she&#39;s unbelievably humble too, Master!<br> I can&#39;t help but be a little nervous around her!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Still, as acting vice commander of this ship,<br> it&#39;s imperative I ask questions that need answers!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yang Guifei, do you know why you<br> materialized as a Foreigner?</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Foreigners are exceedingly rare, even among the Extra classes, and there&#39;s still a lot we don&#39;t know about them.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> All we can say based on our experience is that Foreigners can turn the very laws of this world on their head.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Fortunately, Abby and Hokusai know what they are, and have kindly agreed to both keep themselves in check and help us with our mission, but what about you, Yang Guifei?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Do you understand that you&#39;re a highly unusual kind of being? Are you able and willing to keep your Spirit Origin under control?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> And most importantly...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Are you willing to help Master Fujimaru, and us, during these unprecedentedly dire circumstances?</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> Ehehe, I&#39;m happy to say my answer to all your questions is shì! That is, yes! Allow me to explain!</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> First, I&#39;m very aware that the Heroic Spirit summoning system is meant first and foremost to keep humanity safe!</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> Next, my Spirit Origin! I appreciate you dancing around it, Mash, but the fact is, historically I&#39;m a femme fatale so dangerous I could bring an entire nation to ruin, right?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I, um...can&#39;t deny there are some historians out there with that opinion, yes...</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> It&#39;s fine. I don&#39;t love it, but it is what it is. Anyway, thanks to that...</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> ...I do think I&#39;ve been given the Authority to wreak widespread havoc and destruction.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> !!!</p><hr><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> Still, at least in this Spirit Origin...</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> I feel terrible that I ended up indirectly sparking a rebellion, and would never go around hurting people like some sort of Avenger!</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> Also, since my beloved emperor would obviously never want anything bad to happen to humanity, I&#39;m not about to let some strange god get away with destroying them!</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> So yes, I, Yu-Yu, swear to make use of all the power at my command to help you, Master!</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> You could even use a Command Spell on me to make sure I do just that, if you like.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> That&#39;s okay, I believe you. By the way, I&#39;m Fujimaru.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> No, I trust you. My name&#39;s , by the way.</p><hr><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> Fujimaru... Great!<br> Nice to meet you, Fujimaru!</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> Now, would it be okay if I get to work right away?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Huh? Uh, sure, but what&#39;s this about?</p><hr><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> I&#39;m guessing it&#39;s because many people thought I was a great performer, but for whatever reason, I have really, reeeally good hearing.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> You do!? Then, does that mean you can even hear what&#39;s happening outside the ship!?</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> Shì! In fact, ever since I got here...</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> ...I&#39;ve been hearing someone outside pounding on the ship and saying, “There are enemies coming!”</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Someone outside the ship!? In Void Space!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> This could be perfect!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Maybe they&#39;re the local ally we didn&#39;t dare hope for!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Captain, permission to exit the ship again!<br> I&#39;ll go rescue whoever it is that&#39;s outside!</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Permission denied! I can&#39;t let you go out there alone when we know there might be enemies nearby.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> (If it was just me, I could move about like normal in Void Space too. But...)</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> (...No. I can&#39;t. It wouldn&#39;t be safe for me to leave the ship when we still don&#39;t know what&#39;s going on!)</p><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> Not to worry. That should not be a problem anymore.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Huh?</p><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> Yah.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Gyaaah! What the heck kind of<br> kinky stuff is happening here!?</p><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> There! I have transformed into my other self!</p><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> I will explain later. For the time being, now that we have more personnel who can move about in Void Space...</p><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> ...we should have no issue defeating these enemies and securing this mysterious being outside the ship.</p><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> (Gnnn. What IS this outfit!? I cannot understand why my other self would ever choose to dress this way...)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> There you have it, Captain Nemo!<br> What about a three-person team?</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> ...I guess that could work! All right, Acting Commander, it&#39;s your call! I&#39;ll go along with whatever you decide!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Of course I&#39;d like to send them out, but...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Are you sure you&#39;ll be okay, Mash?You said you couldn&#39;t see the enemy, right?</p><hr><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> I see, I see. So you&#39;re going to be fighting close-quarters battles in Void Space, yes? In that case, if I tweak this, and change that...</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> There we go! I think I can do something to help!</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> What kind of something!?</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> Since this place&#39;s true nature looks to be something akin to the pitch-dark depths of the sea, lit by false light...</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> ...I&#39;ll use the flame illusions I give off to imbue these enemies with an appropriate visual concept, thereby making them visible...ish!</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> Basically, I&#39;ll determine the enemies&#39; position, size, and class through the sound they make, then project a nice visual on top.</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> That should let you fight them without getting confused!</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> ...It looks like Yang Guifei both has a handle on our current situation and she&#39;s best-equipped to do something about it.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> I&#39;ll admit, I was worried about this summoning at first...but it looks like we really did get the Heroic Spirit we needed.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> (Perfect!)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> All right everyone, get ready to head out!</p><hr><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> There! I can see more void enemies in our vicinity, as well as a vast expanse of land that looks like a seabed!</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> Good, it worked. But don&#39;t rely on this ability of mine too much; I can&#39;t visualize enemies I can&#39;t hear!</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> Also, the topography you&#39;re seeing is a rough projection based on the reverberations I picked up during your battle. I&#39;ll refine it once I can use real naval charts as a reference.</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> In the meantime, now that the fight&#39;s over, you should save whoever&#39;s in trouble out there! Their voice has been getting weaker and weaker!</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> I think they&#39;re still hanging on to the port side of the outer hull, but if they let go... Well, anyway, try to save them before that happens, Mash!</p><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> Um... Maybe if I hold out this Gáe Bolg thing and have them grab onto it...</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Ugh, some help this goddess is gonna be! Mash, you go and look for them while I fold up a rescue team!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Understood... There! I see them!</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Good, &#39;cause I&#39;m too nearsighted to tell! Lead the way!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Right!</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> There, I see them! Chiyogami Rescue Squad, you&#39;re up!<br> Hakuro Sea Monkeys!!!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> We did it, Master! We rescued them!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Great! I don&#39;t think those are actually sea monkeys, though.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Way to go!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Rescue squad, returning to ship!<br> Requesting airlock access, Captain Nemo!</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Bridge here, granted.<br> We&#39;ll give our new guest a proper welcome.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> ...You know, Fujimaru, it&#39;s strange.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> This whole situation is utterly ludicrous, but I can&#39;t help but be kind of excited.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> The Void Sea is beyond deadly, and yet, someone was still drifting around in it. What sort of person could do that?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> When we managed to rescue the mysterious castaway outside the ship...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...I could never have imagined in my wildest dreams who they would turn out to be...</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Teehee. Ehehe.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Thank goodness. I thought I was going to end up disappearing into the void like so much kelp... Heh, kelp. That&#39;s a funny word.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> It&#39;s really tasty, though. Heh. Ahh, kindness... Thoughtfulness... Ehehe, I love people.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Oh, right, I&#39;m sorry. Eheheh, I almost forgot to introduce myself!</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> I&#39;m a Foreigner Servant. As you can see, my True Name is Van Gogh! Ehehe...</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> All hands!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Report!</p><hr><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> It&#39;s been five hours since the rescue operation.<br> So far, there have been no further enemy attacks.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Your course of action turned out to be correct, Acting Commander. Yang Guifei has been a huge help, and the person we rescued is assisting us now, too.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Despite how hopeless things seemed before, I think...we&#39;re finally seeing the light at the end of the tunnel.</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> Ehehehe. Stop it, Captain!<br> You&#39;re going to make me blush!</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> Thank you, though!<br> I&#39;ll keep doing my best to be your eyes and ears!</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> By the way, would it be possible for me to work outside the ship, too? How did you make it so you and Osakabehime could do that, Lady Goddess?</p><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> Well...the swimsuit our ally from the moon sent us was embedded with this. I believe it is called a “memory chip.”</p><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> There is a mysterious spell burned into it that appears to be, if not void magecraft, then something similar.</p><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> When this chip is installed into a spirit&#39;s clothing, it makes its wearer compatible with Void Space. Additionally, it improves their physical capabilities.</p><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> However, the only Servants who can make use of these outfits are those who possess swimsuit Spirit Origins, or who have otherwise acquired a swimsuit in the past.</p><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> Unfortunately, the only such Heroic Spirits here are Osakabe and Mash. I, well...</p><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> I&#39;m sorry, but...it was simply<br> too soon for me to wear one.</p><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> Still, if we are able to summon any other swimsuit-capable Servants at some point, I can ensure their clothing is similarly Void Space-compatible.</p><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> I may not know much about modern-day electronics, but I can still duplicate the entire chip with my rune magecraft.</p><p><strong>Nemo Engineer:</strong><br> Well, things from the engine room ain&#39;t lookin&#39; great!</p><p><strong>Nemo Engineer:</strong><br> We&#39;ve been luck enough to avoid any critical damage, but the drivetrain&#39;s still a mess since we ran aground.</p><p><strong>Nemo Engineer:</strong><br> We need to get to drydock to even begin doin&#39; something about our crazy fuel inefficiencies and that loud-as-shit engine rattlin&#39; you&#39;re headin&#39;!</p><p><strong>Nemo Engineer:</strong><br> And since we lost a whole ton of fuel, best not to expect any rapid maneuvers or speed changes anytime soon!</p><p><strong>Nemo Marine:</strong><br> We got beds set up for everyone in the crew compartment. Meals might be a little basic, though.</p><p><strong>Nemo Marine:</strong><br> Most of our food supply was lost along with the fuel, so we&#39;re afraid the Servants are all gonna have to make do with just magical energy for a while.</p><p><strong>Nemo Marine:</strong><br> But hey, aside from that, everything&#39;s fine!<br> We&#39;re really happy we&#39;ve got so many guests☆</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Thanks, everyone! Then with that out of the way, let&#39;s talk about our biggest problem–well, mystery, really.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I&#39;m speaking, of course, of Van Gogh.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Is she really THE Vincent van Gogh?<br> And, is she really on our side?</p><p><strong>Nemo Nurse:</strong><br> Well, I tested a sample of her blood. On the magecraft side of things, her spirit body is circulating an unusual kind of ether at very high densities.</p><p><strong>Nemo Nurse:</strong><br> Servant blood is already fairly different from standard blood, since it&#39;s homeostatic magical energy meant to keep the Servant&#39;s Spirit Origin working...</p><p><strong>Nemo Nurse:</strong><br> ...but Van Gogh&#39;s blood appears to be a step removed even from that.</p><p><strong>Nemo Nurse:</strong><br> While we&#39;re still waiting for Professor to conduct her examination, I can say that Van Gogh&#39;s Spiritron composition and reactions are similar to a type of plant-based elixir.</p><p><strong>Nemo Nurse:</strong><br> She may be a Heroic Spirit using a nonhuman body, like a special kind of homunculus, for her vessel.</p><p><strong>Nemo Nurse:</strong><br> By the way, the reason I&#39;ve been using female pronouns for her is because, at least medically speaking, she&#39;s one-hundred-percent, well, female.</p><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> Hmm. Well that is not so unusual. That sort of thing happens in Chaldea quite frequently, does it not?</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Just because there&#39;s precedent for it doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s not significant.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Hasn&#39;t there always been a clear reason for why Servants have materialized as a gender other than the one they&#39;re generally known to have been?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Yes, there has.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> There have been cases where a Heroic Spirit&#39;s legend was lost or altered, like with Altria and Raikou...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Others were summoned as part of a unit, like Hokusai...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> And then there&#39;s Musashi, whose circumstances are entirely unique.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> But the common thread among them all is that they are from time periods with very few reliable records.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> But Vincent Van Gogh was a world-famous painter from nineteenth-century Holland and France...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> We have ample historical record, including his own self-portraits and even a few photographs, to confirm he was male.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Well, what did she have to say about herself?<br> You talked to her a bit, right, Master?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Well...</p><hr><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> Heh... Ehehehe, you want to know what I was like when I was alive? Oh gosh, that&#39;s embarrassing. My life really wasn&#39;t all that special.</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> I couldn&#39;t hack it as either a salesperson or a missionary, so I just mooched off my parents and my little brother, Theo, and spent all my time painting pictures that never sold...</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> There were lots of painters I would&#39;ve loved to be friends with, but my attempt to befriend Gauguin was kind of a disaster...</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> After that, I, um, kind of fell into a funk and, ultimately, weeell...</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> I put a gun to my chest out in the little village of Auvers-sur-Oise. Heh...ehehe...</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> I never would&#39;ve dreamed that my paintings would be so popular a whole century later... Ehehe, I&#39;m sorry, I can&#39;t help but smile about that.</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> Was there anyone I loved? Of course, teehee. There was Kee, who you might&#39;ve heard of thanks to her famous quote, and Sien... Hm? Yes, they were women.</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> Same-sex relationships? What are you talking about?<br> I&#39;m a woman, and Kee was a... Oh. Uh...</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> ...Ehehe, what were we talking about again?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Her story definitely lined up with the historical Van Gogh, but...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> She did sound like Van Gogh, but something seemed off.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Right. The details she shared do line up perfectly with our records of Vincent van Gogh&#39;s life...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> But then there are the grave contradictions her gender brings up considering when Van Gogh lived.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> For example, the fact that Vincent is a male name, or the fact that her cohabitation with Paul Gauguin would have been a tremendous scandal back then if she had been a woman.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> And then there are all her relationship troubles the database lists, as those all involved other women, too.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I don&#39;t think she&#39;s lying to us...but she definitely seems a little mixed-up about her memories.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That said, she does seem to be fully cognizant of the fact that she&#39;s a woman.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Maybe she&#39;s a female Van Gogh from another world?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> She could be from a parallel world whereshe lived a similar life to our Van Gogh.</p><hr><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> If that&#39;s the case, I can think of three possibilities.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> One, she&#39;s an unrelated person who truly believes she&#39;s Vincent van Gogh. Two, she is Van Gogh, but her gender and memories are scrambled by a Spirit Origin abnormality.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> And three, she&#39;s actually an enemy who&#39;s lying about being Vincent van Gogh. What do you think, Master?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I&#39;m not sure, but I don&#39;t think she&#39;s our enemy.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> All I know for sure is, she&#39;s been extremelyfriendly ever since we rescued her.</p><hr><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> No waaay! Hokusai&#39;s materialized, too!?<br> Really!? Ehehe, ehehe, I&#39;d love to meet her!</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> I&#39;m a huge fan of Japan. In fact, Japanese artists were a huge influence on my work!</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> I don&#39;t know much about this Foreigner stuff, but if you form a contract with me, I&#39;ll gladly do anything I can to help! Ehehe!</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> It&#39;s a little worrying that she doesn&#39;t seem to realize she&#39;s a Foreigner, but at least she&#39;s not hostile.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Right. In the meantime, whether she&#39;s the real Van Gogh or not, she&#39;s already shared some valuable information about Void Space with us.</p><p><strong>Nemo Professor:</strong><br> I&#39;m still analyzing what she&#39;s given us, but at this point, it looks to be about ninety-nine point nine percent accurate.</p><p><strong>Nemo Professor:</strong><br> My hypothesis is that she was essentially born knowing things about Void Space by virtue of having materialized here.</p><p><strong>Nemo Professor:</strong><br> What&#39;s more, she&#39;s obviously already proven that she can move about Void Space freely even without a compatibility chip...</p><p><strong>Nemo Professor:</strong><br> ...so we can say for sure that she possesses protections pertaining to the sea that are at least as strong as ours–er, Nemo&#39;s.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Given those abilities, as well as the information she&#39;s given us, it seems like she could be a valuable asset in battle...</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Since she&#39;s a Servant, that decision is entirely up to you, Master. You&#39;re in charge of the ship now, after all.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> What do you want to do?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I&#39;ve got to form a temporary contract with her.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I should form a temporary contract with her.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I see your mind is as made up as a sea turtle&#39;s shell is hard, Master!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Uh... Oops. I guess I kind of sounded like Captain Nemo there, didn&#39;t I?</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> For future analogies, you might try a sea snail&#39;s tooth. Very tough, those. Er, but I digress.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> A temporary contract, huh? Understood. We should be able to scrounge up enough resources to keep one more Servant.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> But, that being said...</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Everyone, would you mind excusing us for a bit?<br> I&#39;d like to talk to the acting commander in private.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> I&#39;m afraid that goes for you too, Acting Vice Commander. I&#39;d also like to ask you to stand guard, to make sure nobody else overhears us.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> (Oh wow, this must be really important!)<br> All right, understood!</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> ...Good. Professor put up an audio jamming Bounded Field for us, so not even Yang Guifei should be able to overhear.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> All right, Master, what I&#39;m about to tell you is a little, well, sensitive, but if I&#39;m going to serve you properly, I think you should know.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> I think I might know who that Servant really is.</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> Nnn, that darn field is causing so much static I can&#39;t hear a thing. Wish I knew what they were talking about... Aren&#39;t you curious, Your Excellency Acting Vice Commander Kyrielight!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Just Mash is fine, please!</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> Okay then, Mash, what do YOU think Captain and Master are talking about all by themselves?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I think they&#39;re probably discussing some very fine particulars of this operation, so it makes sense they&#39;d want to keep things confidential.</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> I see. Yeah, I guess you&#39;re right. Oh well, what can you do? Politics is always a ridiculously complicated hornet&#39;s nest, no matter the issue or era.</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> So instead of dull and depressing stuff like that, I&#39;d much rather talk about something exciting, like romance! Tell me, what do you make of those two&#39;s prospects?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Huh? Are you saying Captain Nemo<br> and Master are, um...involved?</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> I have no proof, of course, but doesn&#39;t the idea of a commander abusing their authority to have a private tête-à-tête with their subordinate just sound dreeeamy?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> No. No, it does not.</p><p><strong>Nemo Marine:</strong><br> Hey guys! You looked like you were taking a break, so I brought you some drinks!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Thank you! It looks delicious. (Glug glug)</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> Oh, wow! That tastes so odd. Is this modern alcohol?</p><p><strong>Nemo Marine:</strong><br> It sure does! That&#39;s a cocktail called a depth charge!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> (Gurk!)</p><p><strong>Nemo Marine:</strong><br> Don&#39;t worry, these are nonalcoholic! The captain loves to chug these down when nobody else is around!</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> Hao hao! What a lovely drink that everyone can enjoy!<br> How about you, Mash? Do you like it–</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> This... This is terrible...<br> If I drink anything called a cocktail, I... I...</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> Wh-whoa, I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever seen anyone be so affected by, uh, nonalcoholic stuff so quickly! Your face is as pink as a peach!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> My heart rate and blood pressure are rising rapidly... Rational faculties declining...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Oh no. If I don&#39;t do something soon, I&#39;ll be overcome with the urge to burst into the bridge and grill Master with questions!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I need to shut myself down immediately, if not sooner! Button! Button! Where&#39;sh the button!?</p><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> Look at this. I was looking through the storeroom and happened to find this self-destruct switch.</p><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> Sion certainly has a sense of humor, including something like this among our–</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Perfect, thank you! Mash out! (Click)</p><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> Ah.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Aah! What was that!?</p><p><strong>Nemo Professor:</strong><br> This is the backup computer room. Someone just activated the self-destruct device we made for April Fool&#39;s.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Why would you even make something like that!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> What!? Is everyone okay!?</p><hr><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> I told Sion it was a bad idea, but she insisted it would be harmless! What&#39;s the damage, Marine!?</p><p><strong>Nemo Marine:</strong><br> Waaah! Everyone&#39;s hair is burned to a crisp,<br> but otherwise, we&#39;re fine!</p><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> How can you call this fine!?<br> H-how are you going to fix my poor hair!?</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> Owie... My eeears! Huh? Wait.<br> This ringing isn&#39;t from the explosion...</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> ...Uh-oh! Okay everyone, can the comic relief! There&#39;s a ton of enemies headed our way!</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> What!?</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> I&#39;m here to help! I forgot to mention this earlier, but Void Sea monsters are actually reeeally sensitive to sound!</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> So if you want to survive out here, you really shouldn&#39;t make any loud noises! Ehehe! Sorry, I laugh when I&#39;m nervous!</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> ...All right, which of you is ready to deploy!?</p><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> Mash has fainted, Osakabe is...missing?<br> Damn, she must have run away!</p><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> Very well, I shall just have to go out there again myself! Marines, bring me the strongest liquor you&#39;ve got! It might help me forget my shame!</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Even if you do with that, I still can&#39;t send only one Servant out there alone!</p><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> Hmm. Very well then, how about this?</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> Aah! What&#39;s going on!?<br> Why did my outfit change all of a sudden!?</p><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> I embedded a void compatibility spell in your clothing. It is a little rough since you have yet to undergo an Ascension, but it should be enough for you to operate outside the ship.</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> Really!? Xie xie! With this new Ascension form,<br> I can help out outside the ship, too!</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> E-er, um, ehehe, I&#39;d like to go outside as well!</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> Huh? You would!? Are you sure you can?</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> Oh yes, heh. I&#39;m already compatible with Void Space, and my brush is itching for some action, so... Ehehe...</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> Would it be okay with you if...we formed<br> a contract...[♂ Lord /♀️ Lady] Fujimaru...?</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> Probably not, huh...<br> I never could...attract any patrons...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Captain Nemo?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I trust this is okay with you, Captain?</p><hr><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Contracts are your domain, Master. But I can tell you, if I&#39;d had any objections to her joining our crew, I&#39;d have voiced them before we rescued her.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Vincent van Gogh?</p><hr><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> Y-yes!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You&#39;ve got a contract!</p><hr><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> ...Whaaaaaaaaaaaaa...!?</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa...!?</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa...<br> This is awesome!</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> Ehehe, ehehe, I promise I&#39;ll do my best!!!</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> Hooray! We won! I knew I could kick butt in combat!</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> And I have to say, Van Gogh,<br> you and I fight really well together!</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> You&#39;re amazing, Van Gogh!<br> Say, would you mind if I called you Goghie?</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> Huh!? Uh, ehehe...</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> This is great... I always wanted to try collaborating...with an artist from a different culture... Heh...</p><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> Gnn... I knew it. I cannot abide this shame. No, I must find Osakabe and drag her from hiding, whatever it takes.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Why&#39;d Batty run away, anyway?</p><hr><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> She must have caught on to the<br> tactic I was about to suggest.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Tactic?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> What tactic?</p><hr><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> We send her out to perform reconnaissance...by firing her out of a torpedo tube.</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Nooooooooo!!!</p><p><strong>B：Nemo Marine:</strong><br> I captured the deserter, Captain!</p><p><strong>B：Nemo Marine:</strong><br> This should make up for my crime of somehow inebriating the acting vice commander by giving her a nonalcoholic cocktail, right!?</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Good work, Marine. But no, it doesn&#39;t.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> You there, other Marine. Have the culprit write a formal apology after tickling his armpits for six hundred seconds.</p><p><strong>C：Nemo Marine:</strong><br> Aye, aye, sir! I&#39;ll tickle the heck out of him!</p><p><strong>B：Nemo Marine:</strong><br> Eee! Save meee!</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> All right, returning to the matter of Osakabehime serving as the focus of our groundbreaking sonar substitu–</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Iyaaaaaaaaa!!! (Flailing around)</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> ...Would you all mind explaining how it will work?</p><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> As has been so recently demonstrated, Void Space is overrun with vicious monsters that are sensitive to sound.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Excuse me, Teacher!? The acting commander is already lost!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Can someone please put this in English!?</p><hr><p><strong>Nemo Professor:</strong><br> Allow me then. Just so there&#39;s no confusion, it&#39;s best if you think of the Void Space we&#39;re in now as something completely different from the original Void Space.</p><p><strong>Nemo Professor:</strong><br> You see, the idea that Void Space was always full of dangerous reefs and monsters is simply too divergent from current theories in magecraft.</p><p><strong>Nemo Professor:</strong><br> With the information we have now, the most likely explanation is that someone tampered with this Void Space to make it observable, then scattered reefs and monsters all throughout it.</p><p><strong>Nemo Professor:</strong><br> While I&#39;m curious as to what that someone can do, and what their goal might be, it&#39;s not relevant to our current predicament.</p><p><strong>Nemo Professor:</strong><br> More importantly, the fact that these monsters are sensitive to sound would seem to indicate that they&#39;re well-acclimated to this new Void Space&#39;s characteristics.</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> Ehehe, it&#39;s like the unknowable chaos here divided itself into waters of arche and monsters of Logos...</p><p><strong>Nemo Professor:</strong><br> Hmm. Ms. Van Gogh&#39;s explanation may not be entirely clear, so to elaborate...</p><p><strong>Nemo Professor:</strong><br> Whatever originally occupied Void Space seems to have split into two clear types of entities thanks to our ability to observe Void Space now.</p><p><strong>Nemo Professor:</strong><br> If we were to compare this Void Space to a painter&#39;s palette, both the monsters and the reefs would be made up of thick paint, and the rainbow light that now permeates this space would be made up of thin paint.</p><p><strong>Nemo Professor:</strong><br> The rainbow light is dangerous–so much so that just viewing it with the naked eye is risky–but it also possesses other notable characteristics.</p><p><strong>Nemo Professor:</strong><br> I&#39;ve been referring to it as light, but that&#39;s just for simplicity&#39;s sake. It isn&#39;t actually light.</p><p><strong>Nemo Professor:</strong><br> Its luminescence is entirely illusory, which is why it doesn&#39;t illuminate anything, and it refuses to let our retinas retain its true image. Like Ms. Yang Guifei said, this place is essentially pitch-dark.</p><p><strong>Nemo Professor:</strong><br> If anything, the rainbow light we&#39;re “seeing” now–the thin paint, if you will–is more like water in its consistency.</p><p><strong>Nemo Professor:</strong><br> So although it has the same low density as air, it also swells, leaks, and vibrates like water...which means it&#39;s very good at carrying sound.</p><p><strong>Nemo Professor:</strong><br> That also explains why these void monsters are more sensitive to sound than light. Seems reasonable.</p><p><strong>Nemo Professor:</strong><br> So using the propellers and engaging in combat, to say nothing of the absurd commotion of a moment ago, will all attract enemies.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Ghh... I&#39;m sorry, everyone... I&#39;m so sorry...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Okay, now I get it. I think.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> It&#39;s okay, Mash. Go rest up. I&#39;ll fill you in later.</p><hr><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> So basically...this is pure submarine warfare.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> We&#39;re stuck in the deep sea, devoid of light, and we basically have to find our enemies by sound alone, without making any noise that could give away our own position.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Unfortunately, that also means we&#39;re incredibly disadvantaged, in numerous ways.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> First and foremost, with the Nautilus in her current shape, even starting the engine could make enough sound to trigger an attack.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Second, the enemies seem to generally lie immobile, and only attack when they notice us.</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> That&#39;s for sure... I was drifting around here for a long time, and, heh, they didn&#39;t do anything to me...</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> But, if you make a sound...anything from the little guys who just attacked us, to things bigger than this entire ship, will be on us like paint on canvas... Ehehe...</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> It must have been the large enemies that were blasting us with Noble Phantasm-level attacks, though we still don&#39;t know exactly what those attacks WERE...</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> At any rate, we know there are a lot more of them than there are of us, they&#39;ve got us surrounded, and they&#39;re just waiting for us to make a sound so they can find and attack us.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Meanwhile, with our radar out of commission, Yang Guifei&#39;s hearing is all we have to guide us. And with the enemy not making any sounds of their own, we have no choice but to do so ourselves.</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> You mean like, active sonar? Where you send out a sound and determine your enemies&#39; position by how long its waves take to bounce back?</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> That would be really, really dangerous.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Right. If we were to do that right now, it would obviously draw the enemy&#39;s attention. So that option&#39;s off the table.</p><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> Which is where Osakabe comes in. Her Bounded Field Noble Phantasm, and the divination she uses to prepare for it, are really quite remarkable.</p><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> In essence, she performs a fairly wide-area curse-based scan to distinguish friend from foe before firing her Noble Phantasm.</p><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> It is like a third eye that relies on neither sound nor sight. With this ability, we can locate our enemies while remaining completely quiet. I think it is an ideal solution.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> But to do that, you&#39;re gonna shoot me out into the Void Sea all by myself, right!?</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> That&#39;s way too excit–I mean,<br> dangerous for my blood!</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Of course we&#39;re not going to send you out there by yourself without any way to get back. It&#39;ll just look like we are.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Oh crap, now Captain&#39;s actually thinking about doing it! Nooo! I don&#39;t wanna shinidiiie!</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> You&#39;re a survival game expert, yes? Then you must understand how important recon is.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Urk. Well...yeah, I do get that. I guess I just hoped for a...umm...indoor option?</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> I see. I&#39;ll do my best to make that happen.<br> Now, what&#39;s the radius on your Bounded Field scan?</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Um, let&#39;s see... It extends out to about Himeji Castle&#39;s inner moat, so...maybe six hundred meters or so?</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> It looks like the naval chart Lord Xiang Yu left for us is at least a hundred square kilometers...</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Dammit, there&#39;s nowhere to run!!! A-at least make sure I&#39;ll have a way to get back safe! And a reward if I pull this off!! Onegaishiplease, Ma-chan!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> How about one Command Spell, to do with what you will?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> If you pull this off, you can use oneof my Command Spells any way you like.</p><hr><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Reverse Command Spell play!?<br> I didn&#39;t even know that was a thing!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Um, Master!? Are you sure it&#39;s safe to give Osakabehime that much freedom!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Don&#39;t worry. This IS Batty we&#39;re talking about here.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> It&#39;s okay. I&#39;m pretty sure she won&#39;t use it for anything too evil.</p><hr><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Are you suuure? Remember, I once masterminded a pretty badass coup as the lord of Csejte Pyramid Himeji Castle!</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Okay, Captain, if this means I&#39;ll get a Do-Anything-I-Want ticket (read: Command Spell) from Ma-chan, then I&#39;ll do it!</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Great. That takes care of our sonar substitute.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Now, our ultimate objective is to reach the escape point General Xiang Yu laid out for us, and our immediate goal is to seize control of every region along the way!</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Professor&#39;s already come up with a route, and identified four areas that we&#39;ll need to pass through on our way to our goal.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Until we can ensure a region is safe, we&#39;ll have the Nautilus remain on standby at its periphery and send Osakabehime out to probe the area.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Once she&#39;s determined an enemy&#39;s location...</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> ...we&#39;ll have her, Van Gogh, and Yang Guifei swim over and eliminate them in close-quarters combat!</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> Okay! Whether it be to see or fight, you can count on Yu-Yu to help!</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> I&#39;ll do my best, too! Ehehe!</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Acting Vice Commander Mash, you&#39;ll remain on board as our last line of defense against any extremely dangerous attacks we may face.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Scáthach-Skadi, I&#39;d like you to work with Professor as our head of engineering. Is that all right with you two?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Of course! I&#39;ll do whatever<br> it takes to restore my honor!</p><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> That is all right with me too, but are you sure we have the time it will take to enact this plan?</p><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> As I recall, we only have enough fuel for a hundred or so more hours, no?</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> You&#39;re right, but we don&#39;t have any other choice for the time being. We&#39;ll just have to keep working on repairs and try to think of a better plan as we go.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Let&#39;s start with the region we&#39;re in right now.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> For better or worse, this area is fairly narrow, so it should be ideal to determine whether our strategy is viable.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Once we&#39;ve finished sweeping the area for enemies, we&#39;ll see how much energy we used, and–Um, who&#39;s tugging on my sleeve?</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> Captain, Captain. Why does everyone here look like the Grande Armée about to go up against General Winter?</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> You know, that&#39;s a perfect analogy. The fact is, we&#39;re running low on resources, so we&#39;re having to power through on empty stomachs.</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> Huh? Does that mean we don&#39;t have any food?</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> That&#39;s right. We don&#39;t have nearly enough food or, most importantly, magical energy. While we&#39;re at it, we also don&#39;t have enough metal or chemical substances for all the repairs we need.</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> Hmm. Umm, heh, I don&#39;t know anything about ship repairs, but...I think we might be fine when it comes to food and magical energy?</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> ...What do you mean?</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> We can just eat the Logos monsters, like I did when I was drifting around. Ehehe.</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> She&#39;s right! It turns out that the void enemies we defeated can be processed into both high-purity magical energy and food!</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> So from here on, the combat team will also officially double as the resource procurement team!</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> All right, Acting Commander, give the order!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Code Name: Imaginary Scramble!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> All hands, begin operation “The Great Void Sea Escape”!</p><hr><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> Hao haooo! Okay, everyone,<br> let&#39;s get our first sortie started!</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Noooooo!!!</p><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> Oh, stop it already! You are something of a goddess yourself, right? Start acting like it!</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> But nobody told me I was gonna be tethered to the ship with monster intestineees!!!</p><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> It&#39;s all right! The guts we collected from the large enemy are more than strong enough to serve as a lifeline!</p><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> In fact, we may even be able to use these parts to repair the ship! Be proud, Osakabe! The Nautilus&#39;s fate is in your hands! Hehehe!</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> What&#39;s so funny!? Admit it! You&#39;re enjoying this,<br> aren&#39;t you, you baka sadist goddeeesss!!!</p><h2 id="act-one-the-unknowable-reef-2-2" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#act-one-the-unknowable-reef-2-2" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Act One: The Unknowable Reef (2/2)</h2><p><strong>Nemo Marine:</strong><br> Hey guys! Listen to this!</p><p><strong>Nemo Marine:</strong><br> Professor and the goddess lady said they found a way to convert enemy carcasses from void to reality lickety-split!</p><p><strong>E：Nemo Marine:</strong><br> Wow! So what&#39;s that mean?</p><p><strong>Nemo Marine:</strong><br> It means we can finally eat the void monsters!</p><p><strong>E：Nemo Marine:</strong><br> Oh man, that&#39;s gonna suck for you, Master! I didn&#39;t even eat monster meat back on the Mysterious Island!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Monster meat, huh...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I guess meat&#39;s back on the menu...</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> There you are, Master!<br> Oh, you look tired. Is something wrong?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> D-did you get groggy from one of the Nemo Marine&#39;s surprisingly strong drinks, like I did!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Don&#39;t worry about your drunken episode, Mash. Really, it&#39;s okay.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Thank you for being so understanding, Master. I&#39;ll be more careful about what I drink in the future. At any rate...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> No, the Marines and I were just working out a little.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That sounds like a great way to stay fit in an enclosed space like a submarine. I&#39;d love to join you, but first...</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Captain Nemo just made an important discovery, and he&#39;s called an emergency briefing on the bridge. Come on!</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Hey there, Acting Commander. Thanks for playing with the Marines. I know they can be a little rambunctious sometimes.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Anyway, I have good news and bad news.<br> Which would you like to hear first?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Is the good news monster meat?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Does the good news have anything to dowith our new monster meat menu?</p><hr><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> So the catfish is already out of the bag, huh? I&#39;ll have to tighten up the ship&#39;s security protocol when I get a chance.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Still, the situation is better than I expected.<br> A lot better.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> See, we&#39;re not just going to eat or burn up the monster carcasses we collected as they are.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> I know Van Gogh said we could eat them as-is, but it turns out she can only do that because of her unique Spirit Origin.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> When Professor took a look at a sample of Van Gogh&#39;s blood, she found it could convert void beings–that is, imaginary beings–into real ones.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> After further research, she managed to extract all sorts of useful real materials from void enemy carcasses.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> It&#39;s kind of amazing, really. We now have renewable sources of organic matter, minerals, magical energy, and safe-to-eat cuts of meat, so our resource problem is solved.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> This kind of practical experiment has never even been attempted in the history of void-related magecraft, let alone succeeded to this degree. So yes, that&#39;s the good news.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Yay, just what I always wanted: void monster steak.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Oh yeah, that&#39;s...great news. Really great.(Trying to convince yourself)</p><hr><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> I see you&#39;re not too happy about this, either.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Osakabehime and Scáthach-Skadi were pretty stubborn about not wanting to try it or make you eat it, either.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> We&#39;ve, um, certainly hunted monsters for food in past Singularities, but these are an especially unusual case.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I mean, these creatures live in a sea that drives us mad if we just look at it. I don&#39;t think we can blame anyone for being, well, hesitant.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Which is why I decided to do...this.</p><p><strong>D：???:</strong><br> Hello, everyone.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Oh, it&#39;s you! I think we met briefly<br> back at the launch ceremony?</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> That&#39;s right. This is Nemo Baker. While she of course specializes in baking bread, she&#39;s also proficient at cooking in general.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Thanks to the new magical energy we have to spare, I was able to convert part of Scáthach-Skadi&#39;s magecraft workshop into a kitchen.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> So with Baker working her magic, even monster meat will be more appetizing than rations. At least, I think so.</p><p><strong>Nemo Baker:</strong><br> Captain, can&#39;t you take this more seriously? Delicious food is one of the great joys of life on a ship, right?</p><p><strong>Nemo Baker:</strong><br> Don&#39;t worry, everyone. I&#39;ll do my best to make a yummy meal out of whatever ingredients I have to work with.</p><p><strong>Nemo Baker:</strong><br> It&#39;s not every day you get to go on a cruise, after all, so the more good memories you make, the better☆</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I&#39;m still scared, but I do feel a bit better.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I think I might actually be looking forwardto trying this monster meat now.</p><hr><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> So yes, that&#39;s the good news.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Now, the bad news.<br> I&#39;m afraid there&#39;s actually two things to share here.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> First, we now know for sure that we can&#39;t currently emerge back into Reality Space.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I had a feeling that might be the case given all the damage.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Because of the damage to the ship?</p><hr><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Actually, we wouldn&#39;t be able to emerge right now even if the ship were perfectly fine, since the Void Space we&#39;re in now has no concept of depth.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Well, specifically, this Void Space is SO deep that it rejects any measurement od depth. The sense of depth we have here now is illusory.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> As a result, the Nautilus cannot emerge from this place any more than it can dive deeper.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Basically, the spells the Paper Moon uses to employ the necessary concepts for emergence are unusable right now.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Any attempt to move up or down either simply won&#39;t work, or they&#39;ll cause the coordinate axes to freak out and make us crash into a rocky shoal, so we have to be cautious.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> The hallmark of submarine warfare is its third dimension, but here it&#39;s restricted to a two-dimensional plane akin to traditional maritime warfare.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> So when we encounter enemies, we won&#39;t be able to dive down and sneak underneath them or anything like that.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> ...All right, now that you&#39;re caught up on the first piece of bad news, you&#39;re ready to hear the second.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Remember those giant enemies Van Gogh mentioned?<br> Well, Sonarhime just picked one up.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Sonarhime...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Is she okay?</p><hr><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Oh yes, she&#39;s fine. She&#39;s used to being a living torpedo now, and she&#39;s sounding more like a seasoned scout every time.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> You certainly know a lot of interesting people,<br> don&#39;t you, Fujimaru?</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> At any rate, in Reality Space measurements, this giant enemy she discovered looks to be over eighty meters long.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Holy cow, that IS huge!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> That&#39;s even bigger than your average dragonkin!</p><hr><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Yeah. In fact, it&#39;s vastly larger than the original Nautilus–probably twice as big, if the amount of wastewater it&#39;s putting out is anything to go by.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> So yes, it&#39;s huge–easily big enough to qualify as a bona fide enemy ship. Of course, you may have seen even larger enemies over the course of your travels.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I guess Qin Shi Huang was bigger than that.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I guess the Trees of Emptiness are bigger than that.</p><hr><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Well, that does tell me a lot about the trials you&#39;ve faced to come this far.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> At any rate, we should expect giant enemies like this one to bombard us with Noble Phantasm-level attacks, like the kind we saw before.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> And given the route we&#39;re taking, facing those things in close-quarters combat is inevitable.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Do you think you can handle them, Master?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I don&#39;t think we&#39;ll be able to beat them outright.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I&#39;ll do my best, but my priority will be to keep everyone safe.</p><hr><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> I agree. Which is why I think we should consider sending out the acting vice commander, too.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> So you want me to defend everyone in the close combat team against the enemy like before?</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> That&#39;s right. If you can hold your ground in close with the enemy, they shouldn&#39;t be able to target the ship, either.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> That said, Servant combat is<br> Fujimaru&#39;s domain.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> So I&#39;ll leave the team formation, and the timing for sending everyone out, up to you.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Got it.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I&#39;ll make sure we all make it back safe and sound.</p><hr><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> We can&#39;t hold out any longer, Captain Nemo!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> We need to call them back, now!</p><hr><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> All right, Marines, get them out of there!<br> Reel in their lifelines, on the double!</p><p><strong>Nemo Marine:</strong><br> Nghhh... Wait! The reel&#39;s jammed!</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Now!?</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> This is Yang “Sonar” Guifei calling in from on site! We&#39;re dangling like fish on hooks out here!</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> I&#39;m hearing a lot more creatures headed our way from two-seven-five! Sounds like reinforcements! Get us outta heeere!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Hang in there just a little longer, Mash!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I&#39;m trying, Master! But I&#39;m afraid I really can&#39;t hold out much longer!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Can you get back to the ship on your own, Yang Guifei!?</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> No way! This thing&#39;ll send us flying who knows where if we try swimming away!</p><hr><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> There is one thing I can suggest, Master.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> If we cut the combat team loose and use my Noble Phantasm, those of us on the Nautilus may make it out of here alive.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> We&#39;re. Not. Doing. That.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Absolutely not.</p><hr><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> All right. I can see how serious you are about bringing everyone back. The way things are going, we need to keep that option as a last resort.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> We have approximately seventy seconds until enemy reinforcements arrive! Come on, Master! All of you! Think!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Ghhh...! I can&#39;t...hold out much longer!</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Iyaaaaaa! We&#39;re doooooomed! I knew I should&#39;ve<br> just stayed in my room like a good hiko!</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> Ehehehe... Heh... So much for my new life... Still, I&#39;m glad I got to meet all of you...before I disappear...</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> Nooo! Don&#39;t give up yet!</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> Juuust kidding. Heh. This isn&#39;t over just yet. Just a little Van Goghk for you... Ehehe...</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> Whoa, you sound really confident! Are you stronger<br> than you look? Do you have some kind of secret plan to save us!?</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> Could you all close your eyes?</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> Huh?</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> I&#39;m going to release my Noble Phantasm...and even I don&#39;t know what&#39;ll happen once I do...</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> It&#39;s a picture I painted when I was going through a really hard time, and I AM a Foreigner after all...</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> But, I am sure that if I release it...ehehe,<br> we&#39;ll make it out of this alive!</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Go for it!</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> By all means!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Do it, Van Gogh!</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Now what!?</p><p><strong>Nemo Professor:</strong><br> Computer room here!<br> All of our instruments just went haywire!</p><p><strong>Nemo Professor:</strong><br> Whatever this is, it shouldn&#39;t be possible! Even in Void Space! I can only theorize someone activated a Noble Phantasm on par with a Reality Marble!</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Somebody on the combat team used a Noble Phantasm we&#39;ve never seen before!?</p><p><strong>Nemo Professor:</strong><br> Oh, wait, hang on. What&#39;s this now?<br> Uh-huh, uh-huh. Hmm? Yes...</p><p><strong>Nemo Professor:</strong><br> Our instruments are back online, and... Uh-huh...<br> It looks like things are...okay there now?</p><p><strong>Nemo Professor:</strong><br> I can confirm that the combat team is back in the safe zone. Master, Captain, if you&#39;re going to fire the Noble Phantasm, now&#39;s your chance.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Nemo, now!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> You heard the Professor! Let&#39;s do it!</p><hr><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> So you&#39;re choosing to take the fight to the enemy here, huh. Very brave, Acting Commander.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Attention, all hands! Prepare to deploy a Noble Phantasm attack!</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Of course, the ship won&#39;t be able to endure the recoil in its current state, so divert all the energy we can spare to an Anti-Impact spell!</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Our target is the enemy ship at zero-six-five! The aftershocks should also drive off the reinforcements!</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Give it everything you&#39;ve got! If we can&#39;t break through the enemy in one shot, we&#39;ll all be sunk for sure!</p><p><strong>Nemo Engineer:</strong><br> I ALWAYS give it everything I&#39;ve got! Hey, computer room! You&#39;re sure you can keep the engine intact, right!?</p><p><strong>Nemo Professor:</strong><br> Nope, I can&#39;t. But I&#39;ll do my best to make sure it at least doesn&#39;t come apart entirely. Will that and a dance be enough, scary Engine Room Lady?</p><p><strong>Nemo Engineer:</strong><br> Hell no it won&#39;t! You mess this up, and I&#39;ll be makin&#39; you dance on top of whatever&#39;s left of our Magical Reactors!</p><p><strong>Nemo Marine:</strong><br> Oh no, this is terrible!<br> Professor&#39;s gonna end up as seafood barbecue!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Just as a reminder: these people are all still you, right, Captain?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> This is quite the one-person show you&#39;re putting on, Captain.</p><hr><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> I&#39;m just a bit flustered, and I am in the mood for a speech. Would you mind?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Go for it!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Definitely not!</p><hr><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> All right, everyone!<br> Win or lose, it all comes down to this!</p><p><strong>Nemo Marine:</strong><br> Well said, Captain!<br> That&#39;s what being a sailor&#39;s all about!</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Start up the Triton Engine!<br> All sections, final safety checks! Go!</p><p><strong>Nemo Marine:</strong><br> We&#39;ve already got the enemy square<br> in our sights, of course!</p><p><strong>Nemo Professor:</strong><br> Copy that. Distance to target and attack pattern analysis complete. Unfolding magical energy barrier!</p><p><strong>Nemo Engineer:</strong><br> Now that&#39;s what I&#39;m talkin&#39; about, Engines One and Two! Keep &#39;em revved right up to the redline.</p><p><strong>Nemo Baker:</strong><br> Hmm. Would anyone mind if I made custard pudding for today&#39;s snack?</p><p><strong>All Nemos:</strong><br> Not at all!</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> All right, here goes! Whoever dares threaten the peaceful seas is going to have to answer to Captain Nemo!</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Great Ram Nautilus!!!</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> First off, I&#39;m just glad you&#39;re all back safe and sound.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Great work out there, everyone!</p><hr><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> Oh gosh, I still can&#39;t believe we made it back alive! I don&#39;t think I really understood I&#39;d gotten myself into before!</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> I&#39;m happy...I was useful... Ehehe.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> I wonder what happened back there? I think I saw something, but... Ghh, my brain. All I can remember is seeing something horrible...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Me too. I&#39;m not sure why, but...when I try to recall what happened, my head just...hurts...</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> This is how you react after we all managed to make it back alive from a fearsome battle!? Yikes, warfare has changed a lot since my time.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Yang Guifei is right. This is the best possible result we could have hoped for, seeing as we didn&#39;t suffer a single casualty.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> That said, this victory did come at a cost.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> The ship&#39;s frame is only just holding together, the pressure hull is in tatters, and it almost cost us our lives to stop that rainbow-colored leak.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Luckily, we were able to hold it back thanks to the Nemo Series and Scáthach-Skadi, but honestly, I&#39;m not entirely sure how we&#39;re still alive.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I&#39;m still smarting from Engineer&#39;s, um, spirited talking-to.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Let&#39;s just say I&#39;m glad we&#39;ve got Nurse here.</p><hr><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> We lost because we didn&#39;t plan well enough. Also, we underestimated our enemy, and were way too careless about securing an escape.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> We might&#39;ve succeeded at removing the giant enemy blocking our way, but only at the cost of the Nautilus being as stuck as a beached whale.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> To get moving again, we&#39;ll need to collect everything we can from the area and put it all toward fixing the ship.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> And since the next areas are only going to get bigger, we&#39;ll need to really focus on resource collection.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> First, we&#39;ll use what parts we have to get the Nautilus ready to sail the Void Sea again. We need to focus on silent running and storage space for our extra resources.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> At the same time, we&#39;ll also need to expand our options for Void Sea warfare. Once we have more magical energy, we can, and should, bring in more Servants to help us.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> That said, it&#39;s now clear that attacking those giant enemies with Servants in close combat is a fool&#39;s errand, and we shouldn&#39;t bother trying to do so any longer.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> So it&#39;s going to be absolutely essential that<br> we find a new supply of torpedoes somewhere.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> I&#39;m afraid we can no longer afford to accommodate passengers. You&#39;re now all a part of this ship&#39;s crew, and I&#39;m going to work you accordingly! Be ready!</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> But I don&#39;t wanna wooork!</p><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> That is no way to treat a goddess... But, very well. I have plenty of skill and experience helping mortals, so I will do what I must.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> In particular, I&#39;m guessing the two Foreigners will be key to making our way out of this Void Sea, so I&#39;ll be counting on you more than ever.</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> Of course! Unskilled though I may be, I&#39;m happy to help any way I can!</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> Um, ehehe, I&#39;d like to help too,<br> but I don&#39;t know if I can...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You said you don&#39;t remember how you used your Noble Phantasm?</p><hr><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> Uh-uh. I was so caught up in the moment that...I never understood exactly how I was using my Noble Phantasm, or what its effects were...</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> I&#39;m sorry. I really am useless. Ehehe... The only thing I&#39;m good for...is eating monsters and, um, expelling them as magical energy...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Thanks, but, no thanks.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I appreciate the thought, but...no.</p><hr><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> Oh! How about my blood, instead? You can have as much of that as you like if it&#39;ll help! Ehehe...</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Van Gogh, for the time being, your job will be to help the resource acquisition team, and to cooperate with Professor and Nurse&#39;s tests.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> We should have enough blood from you for now,<br> but if we do need more, we&#39;ll be sure to ask.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> We&#39;re counting on you too, Van Gogh.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I&#39;d love to see one of your paintings someday.</p><hr><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> I-I got a job! And praise!</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> This is amazing! Ehehe, I promise I&#39;ll do my best!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> All right, I think it&#39;s time we nail down a firmer plan.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Okay team, you&#39;re dismissed for now. We need to talk strategy.</p><hr><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> Heh... Ehehe... I got a job... Steady work... Income... This is so cool... I&#39;m going to do my very best... Ehehe...</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> Goghie.</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> Aah! L-Lady Yang Guifei?<br> A-are you hugging me from behind?</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> It&#39;s so great how well you&#39;re fitting in here! It really gets you motivated, doesn&#39;t it? I know it is for me!</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> I look forward to working together!</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> Y-yes... I do too, Lady Yang Guifei...</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> Good luck remembering how to use your Noble Phantasm properly! I&#39;m rooting for you!</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> ...Why did that painting make that happen?</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> What is a Foreigner, anyway?</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> What...am I...?</p><h2 id="act-two-the-thunder-shooter-s-fishing-ground-1-4" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#act-two-the-thunder-shooter-s-fishing-ground-1-4" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Act Two: The Thunder Shooter&#39;s Fishing Ground (1/4)</h2><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Three, two, one... All stop!</p><p><strong>Nemo Professor:</strong><br> ...Perfect. We&#39;re right on the edge of the second area.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> No sign of attack.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Looks like we&#39;re in the clear.</p><hr><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Well, we did cut the engines and coast along silently for a good while.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> There&#39;s no room for complacency now! I&#39;ll show you the skill and grace of a submariner!</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> All right, we made it to a new area, and we have a few resources we can spare. Can you summon us more fighters, like we discussed?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Of course.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> If it&#39;s a summon you need, I&#39;m your .</p><hr><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Great. Like I said before, it&#39;s essential that we have a way to use torpedoes again.</p><p><strong>Nemo Professor:</strong><br> I worked out all the errors and bugs, so we shouldn&#39;t have a problem summoning a Chaldean Servant this time.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That&#39;s great, but I can&#39;t think of any Servants who can fire torpedoes... Maybe one of the inventors?</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> That&#39;s okay. We don&#39;t need actual torpedoes.<br> Whoever we summon has to meet several conditions.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> First, they need to possess a large projectile Noble Phantasm–something along the lines of an Anti-Ship cannon.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Second, that Noble Phantasm needs to use physical matter for its ammo, as opposed to something like laser beams. It would take a long time to explain why, but–</p><p><strong>Nemo Professor:</strong><br> Basically, any beam fired in the Void Sea would lose a lot of its power.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> What about the enemy? They use beams just fine.</p><hr><p><strong>Nemo Professor:</strong><br> True, but only because those cheaters use some kind of mysterious void-derived beams, and we currently have no idea how they work.</p><p><strong>Nemo Professor:</strong><br> It seems like it&#39;d be really hard to both analyze and apply the tech to a Noble Phantasm, so we&#39;re thinking of going back to basics on this with some good old-fashioned projectile ammo.</p><p><strong>Nemo Professor:</strong><br> Projectiles are great. They&#39;re a shining example of what oil and metal can accomplish together. Masswise, they&#39;re simple, powerful, and reliable.</p><p><strong>Nemo Professor:</strong><br> Best of all, they can be heavily customized. For example, we can add self-propulsion and homing capabilities to them with just a few runes.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> There you go. Third, this Noble Phantasm&#39;s projectiles can&#39;t use anything like gunpowder to fire or propel them.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> While we&#39;ll of course do our best to suppress any sound produced as a side effect of using this Noble Phantasm, it&#39;d be pretty much impossible to fire a cannon silently.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Ideally, it&#39;d be great if this Noble Phantasm were really powerful, but we can compensate for that to some extent.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> If we connect this theoretical Servant directly to the Nautilus&#39;s Magical Reactors, we can power it up enough that even a D-rank Noble Phantasm would work as long as it&#39;s Anti-Army.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> So taking all of that into consideration, I think we might actually have better luck with a Lancer or an Assassin than an Archer or a Rider.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> What about our resident goddess then?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Can&#39;t our resident goddess use Gáe Bolg Alternative?</p><hr><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> True, that would work fine...<br> if we had the real Scáthach here.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> But we now know that when Scáthach-Skadi forces herself to change into Scáthach&#39;s Assassin version, she ranks down so much she&#39;s no stronger than an average human.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> It makes sense, really, since she isn&#39;t actually Scáthach. Anyway, suffice to say, she definitely shouldn&#39;t be taking part in combat this time.</p><p><strong>Nemo Professor:</strong><br> Not to mention that she&#39;s now an essential member of the engineering team. Frankly, it would be a waste to send her out to the front line.</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> Then, it&#39;ll be up to the personnel selection routine to find the best Servant for the job?</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> That&#39;s right.<br> Okay, Fujimaru, do it!</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> ...Oh? Oh my.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> I know I had a lot on my mind, but I could have sworn I was still training in the simulator...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> It&#39;s Raikou!</p><hr><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Oh, you&#39;re really so happy to see me? Wonderful. Mother is always delighted to see you, too.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> I do remember hearing you were conducting a training exercise at sea somewhere, but I&#39;m quite certain I wasn&#39;t on call to be summoned. Hehe, I see. Something unexpected happened, didn&#39;t it?</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Well, that&#39;s quite all right. No matter what the problem may be, I&#39;ll resolve it quick as can be.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> By the way... My, my, there certainly are a lot of young women aboard this ship.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Yes, it&#39;s a very good thing I came here.<br> A very good thing indeed...</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> (Crap, a Berserker. This is the last thing we need. I&#39;d...better keep that to myself if I want to make it back alive, though.)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Senpai, I think this might be–</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Yup.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Definitely the best person for the job.</p><hr><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Hm?</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Is something wrong?<br> I&#39;m sensing some decidedly mixed reactions.</p><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> Not at all, knight of a foreign land. You have come at a perfect time. Help maintaining order is just what this ship needs.</p><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> I am told you once spent a summer as a veritable demon of discipline, and fortunately, I have the outfit you wore at the time ready and waiting.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> !!!</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> The indecent outfit I wore to combat indecency...!!!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Wat.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> So you DID know it was indecent.</p><hr><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Ahem... Well, if the situation calls for it...<br> No! No, I mustn&#39;t!</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> I can only serve as the shadow prefect during summer, when the sun&#39;s rays disrupt public decency.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Otherwise, it will lead to all sorts of problems,<br> such as... How should I put this...</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> If I were to become the shadow prefect now, I&#39;m concerned I may not be able to, um, pull my punches? That public decency might soon become the last thing on our minds...</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Oof, it&#39;s so hot in here. I know we&#39;ve gotta conserve energy right now, but did the AC have to go, too? Anyway, I&#39;m gonna go head out on patro–</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> ...Un...accept...able...</p><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> Now, Fujimaru!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> By my Command Spell, etcetera etcetera!!!</p><hr><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> My eyes have been opened!!!</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Now I see exactly what is going on here!</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> It seems this ship is indeed a hotbed of summer&#39;s wicked temptations!</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> But worry not, dear Master! If I must abandon my motherly duties and don this forbidden outfit to protect you, then that is what I shall do!</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Unacceptable! Unacceptable! Absolutely unacceptable!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Yay!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> It&#39;s Lancer Raikou!</p><hr><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> Wonderful, wonderful. Now, come with me. We must formulate a plan to combat indecency aboard the ship.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Hm? Huh?</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> But, I was going to start by confiscating all of Lady Osakabehime&#39;s abundant indecency attribute...</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Ma-chan, please tell me you&#39;re going to console me since she tried to korossacre me the second she showed up!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Sorry about that...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I&#39;ll have a word with Raikou later, okay?</p><hr><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> All right. I have heard the entire story in excruciating detail.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Really, you could have simply told me what was going on when I was first summoned.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Then again, I suppose that may be easier said than done...</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> At any rate, now that I truly understand the situation, rest assured that I will make full use of my Indra-given burial lightning to obliterate these Mystics from a foreign sea!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> We did it!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Now the Nautilus has torpedoes again!</p><hr><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> Hehe, and that is not all. In addition to combat, Raikou&#39;s powers should also allow us to significantly expand the size and scope of our recon capabilities.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Indeed. If I deploy an envoy of Gozu-Tenno to the Void Sea and have them run scans by sending out lightning waves, that should–</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> R-really!? Yatta! I&#39;m free! Hiko life, here I come!</p><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> Don&#39;t be silly. We still need all the recon we can get. In fact, we will be counting on you now more than ever.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Also, I know nothing at all about interpreting the scan results, so I plan to foist that off on–I mean, have you handle that part.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Gyaaah! Now I have more work than ever!<br> Come back, sweet freedom! Come baaack!</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> (There we go. Her backbreaking workload should keep her indecency in check, thereby leaving Master&#39;s body and soul safe once more.)</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> (But of course, one can never be too careful! I must remain ever vigilant in my pursuit of public decency!)</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> ...I was kind of worried how things were going to go there for a while, but it looks like it worked out. Though I still don&#39;t understand how Chaldeans can change Spirit Origins just by putting on swimsuits...</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> Swimsuits... Swimsuits... Maybe, if I wore one...<br> I could be a different class, too...</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> Ehehe... Kidding... Just another Van Goghk for you... That would never happen... Never...</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> ...Is there something you&#39;re worried about, Van Gogh?</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> Huh? Not at all, Captain.</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> I&#39;m just enjoying my second lease on life by making pictures with the paint the goddess lady snuck me... Ehehe...</p><p>(...Master, there&#39;s something I think you and the other leaders should know. Could I talk to you for a bit once we&#39;re done here?)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> (Nod quietly)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> ...Okay guys, I think it&#39;s time we all got back to our posts.</p><hr><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> All right, now that our private discussion is over...</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> What do you make of Yang Guifei&#39;s<br> story, Fujimaru?</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> You see, I actually do remember what happened when Van Gogh used her Noble Phantasm...</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> I thought you three should know too, but please just keep this off the record!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> So Van Gogh&#39;s Noble Phantasm was...Le Père Tanguy, I believe it&#39;s called? It&#39;s certainly one of Van Gogh&#39;s more famous paintings...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> So according to Yang Guifei, Van Gogh painted an old man surrounded by a variety of things in space, all of which then basically came to life and rescued us...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...and she&#39;s worried about the fact that Van Gogh was able to make things she painted in Void Space into reality-based objects, right?</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Right... To tell the truth, the only reasons we&#39;re able to interact with Void Space at all are the void magecraft chips and Van Gogh&#39;s blood.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Really, her Spirit Origin&#39;s practically a treasure trove of ways to manipulate Void Space. And now, we have additional information from Yang Guifei&#39;s Noble Phantasm.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> While it&#39;s difficult to make much sense out of the logs our sensors recorded during that battle, since they&#39;re so unlike anything I&#39;ve ever seen...</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> If Van Gogh really did manage to create an enormous mass out of nothing–something that would be completely impossible in Reality Space–a lot of things start to make sense.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Let&#39;s say that Yang Guifei&#39;s illusory textures weren&#39;t able to keep up with this new being that suddenly appeared, and the resulting mental shock to everyone out there fighting made them forget what happened.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> If that&#39;s accurate, it would explain a lot. Not just about that battle, but the entire situation we&#39;re in right now.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Now we know it&#39;s entirely possible that all these obstacles and monsters that could normally never exist in Void Space were created by her Noble Phantasm.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...To be honest, I think a lot of us were suspicious of Van Gogh when she first showed up.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> But she seemed so harmless that we all slowly let down our guard around her.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Speaking personally, I don&#39;t think she means any harm, but she also wouldn&#39;t be the first Heroic Spirit to be, um, going through some stuff...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> So I think we need to keep all of this in mind going forward.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> I agree. Plus, she also seems to be confused about who she is right now.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> If only we knew for sure who she is...</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Hmm. Well...</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> Hmm. Something&#39;s not right... Do the acting commander and the captain know more than they&#39;re letting on?</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> Ehehe, is something wrong, Lady Yang Guifei? You&#39;re pressed up against that door tighter than a tree frog.</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> Eek! I-i-i-it&#39;s nothing! Really!</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> But, uh, Goghie!? I just want you to know that, as a Foreigner myself, I&#39;m on your side no matter what! Well, bye!</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> Huh...?</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> Sometimes...I really have no idea what&#39;s going on.<br> Ehehe.</p><h2 id="act-two-the-thunder-shooter-s-fishing-ground-2-4" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#act-two-the-thunder-shooter-s-fishing-ground-2-4" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Act Two: The Thunder Shooter&#39;s Fishing Ground (2/4)</h2><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> ...All right, everyone, we finally have a chance to make up for our first humiliating defeat.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Thanks to Osakabehime, we know exactly where the enemy is located, and how big it is: eighty meters, just like the last one we encountered.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> We also know there aren&#39;t any other enemies nearby. So this time, we&#39;re going to try attacking it with a torpedo!</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> Torpedo-no-Raikou...<br> It&#39;s got a nice ring to it, heh...</p><p><strong>Nemo Professor:</strong><br> Minamoto-no-Raikou, let me just remind you one more time to please stay close to the ship.</p><p><strong>Nemo Professor:</strong><br> You&#39;ll need to brace yourself against the force fields we&#39;ve put up around the ship in order to use your overclocked Noble Phantasm safely.</p><p><strong>Nemo Professor:</strong><br> This might sound bad, but basically, just this once, we need you to conduct yourself as though you are a shipboard weapon.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Leave it to me. I&#39;ve had plenty of experience handling heavy weaponry, and I&#39;ve practiced wielding this one in the simulator.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> At long last, I will not be limited to Indra&#39;s power alone. Now, I will have invincible purifying crystallized intellect, combined with the enforcing power of many gods&#39; mantras and scriptures at my fingertips.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Ahh, I can&#39;t wait to fire it! And once I&#39;ve eradicated all the immoral evils of this world, I will give Master and Kintoki the best head pats of their lives!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Um...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> You&#39;re not reverting to your Berserker self, are you?</p><hr><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Not to worry. I&#39;m just excited to get started.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> With all due respect, Raikou, right now, you need to stay calm and collected, like an executioner.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> When it&#39;s time to fire, the ship is going to send you a vast amount of magical energy and precise calculations. At that exact moment, I want you to process it all and unleash your Noble Phantasm.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Basically, I want you be as cool as a sea cucumber, and as vicious as a cone snail. You can do that, right?</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Of course, Captain. Seafood is a favorite of mine.<br> Now, let&#39;s be on our way!</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> We have obliterated the horrid, shameless enemy vessel. Hehe, how wonderful!</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Yup, that played out just like it did in the simulation–<br> no, even better. Honestly, I&#39;m a little scared by how well it all worked.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The enemy didn&#39;t even try to fire back at us. Does this mean Raikou&#39;s Noble Phantasm was just that quiet?</p><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> Indeed. I inscribed her weapon with runes to limit its vibration of nearby space. You have my Goddess Guarantee that her spear is now completely silent.</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> I hear a fair amount of swimming creatures outside... Maybe these enemy ships aren&#39;t the sharpest tools in the shed?</p><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> I see... Then I suppose there is<br> still some room for improvement.</p><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> Captain, make sure to dismantle the enemy ship before bringing it aboard. I would particularly appreciate any parts that seem especially quiet.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Hmm, I&#39;m surprised she was so willing to voice her opinion in defiance of this foreign goddess&#39;s protection. I must say, it&#39;s a bit unsettling.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Well, desperate times and all that.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Honestly, that kind of thing seems par for the course at Chaldea.</p><hr><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> True. But you know, Master.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Since we so frequently find ourselves in desperate times, don&#39;t you think that&#39;s all the more reason to take pains to preserve order, morality, and decency?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Are you going where I think you&#39;re going with this?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Uh-oh. Does that mean</p><hr><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Indeed! From now on, while between missions, I will be resuming my prefect duties and cracking down on any displays of public indecency!</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> I will naturally be investigating whether you&#39;ve committed any public decency violations in my absence, Master.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> And if I should happen to find you have...</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> ...Ahem! I hope you&#39;ll be prepared<br> to face the consequences!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Oh nooo, whatever will I dooo.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> (I&#39;m so sure she&#39;s not gonna find anythingthat I actually feel a little bad for her.)</p><hr><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> (Mumbling indistinctly)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Goghie?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Something on your mind?</p><hr><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> Eep! Master! I-it&#39;s nothing. I was just thinking<br> about how Lady Raikou is so full of life...</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> I couldn&#39;t be more different from her, huh... Ehehe.<br> Sorry for being such a downer, Master...</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> Nnn. I hope Goghie&#39;s okay...</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> Master, I know you have a lot on your plate right now, but could I ask you to do something nice for Goghie?</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> Maybe you could take her for a walk...<br> Chat with her... Have a meal together...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> All right. It&#39;s a date.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Okay, I&#39;ll take her on a date.</p><hr><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> Exactly! Times like this, a nice date can–</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei &amp; Mash &amp; Nemo &amp; Osakabehime:</strong><br> Did you say “date”!?</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> (Sigh...)<br> Ehehe. Nothing ever seems...to go my way...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> There you are!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Hey! Goghie!</p><hr><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> Oh, Master...<br> I&#39;m sorry I&#39;m not a better painter...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> This feels weirdly familiar.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> (Are all Foreigners like this?)</p><hr><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> Ehehe... You certainly have your work cut out for you, don&#39;t you, Master?</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> Compared to you, I&#39;m just a frail bough in the mistral wind... Or maybe a frail Gogh... Ehehe...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> (I knew it! She&#39;s super nervous.Okay, I know just what to do!)</p><hr><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Hey, Goghie! What do you say we have some fun together!?</p><hr><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> Huh? But, you&#39;re the acting commander...<br> You must be very busy...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Don&#39;t worry. I&#39;ve got more time on my hands than you&#39;d think.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> It&#39;s fine! Let&#39;s just forget our troubles for now and enjoy ourselves!</p><hr><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> Huh? But...I–</p><p><strong>Nemo Engineer:</strong><br> So why&#39;d ya come here of all places, huh!?</p><p><strong>Nemo Engineer:</strong><br> Ya really think Van Gogh&#39;s gonna enjoy all this blazing heat and total lack of fun!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I&#39;m actually here to hang out with you, too, Engineer.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I figured you deserved a break too, so...</p><hr><p><strong>Nemo Engineer:</strong><br> Me? You don&#39;t gotta worry about me. A quick shower during my breaks is all I need to wash off any stress I might have pent up.</p><p><strong>Nemo Engineer:</strong><br> Long as the engine&#39;s doin&#39; well,<br> that&#39;s all I need to be happy.</p><p><strong>Nemo Engineer:</strong><br> Speakin&#39; of which, I still got a ton of work to do, so go on and get outta here! If ya wanna goof off that much, go play with one of the marines or somethin&#39;!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Let&#39;s just do one quick game. It&#39;ll only take a second.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> (Take out helmet and squeaky hammer)</p><hr><p><strong>Nemo Engineer:</strong><br> Huh? What&#39;s that stuff? Some kinda safety equipment?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> We play rock-paper-scissors, and whoever winstries to hit the loser with the hammer.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Whoever loses at rock-paper-scissors has to put thehelmet on to avoid getting hit with the hammer.</p><hr><p><strong>Nemo Engineer:</strong><br> Sooo...we do rock-paper-scissors, and if I win,<br> I go for the hammer, and you go for the helmet...</p><p><strong>Nemo Engineer:</strong><br> What kinda silly-ass game is that!?</p><p><strong>Nemo Engineer:</strong><br> And can&#39;t that hammer make any louder noises,<br> like a big kaboom or somethin&#39;!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Just try it on. Trust me.</p><hr><p><strong>Nemo Engineer:</strong><br> All right, hang on... Okay, I got how this works. So do I say “rock, paper, scissors, shoot!” or without the “shoot”? Without? Okay, got it!</p><p><strong>Nemo Engineer:</strong><br> Right, let&#39;s do this thing!<br> Rock, paper, scissors!!!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Welp, I sure lost that one.</p><hr><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> Ehehe... Still, it was very exciting to watch.<br> I was on pins and needles the whole time...</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> The look of shame and fury on Lady Engineer&#39;s face when you beat her the first two times was really funny...even if she did make a comeback after that...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I was hoping you&#39;d try it too, Van Gogh.</p><hr><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> Me? Ehehe, I don&#39;t know. I&#39;ve never been very good at competition of any kind...</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> If I&#39;d had to use the squeaky hammer...I&#39;d probably just panic and drop it... Especially with Lady Engineer glaring at me so intensely...</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> I&#39;m sorry you wasted your invitation on me...</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> S-still, I really did enjoy watching!<br> It was so exciting! Gogh-citing, even!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Okay, I think I know where to go next.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Let&#39;s visit the crew mess next.</p><hr><p><strong>Nemo Baker:</strong><br> Hi there. Welcome to the crew mess☆</p><p><strong>Nemo Baker:</strong><br> Are you on break now, Acting Commander?<br> Can I get you something strong to drink?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Just a soft drink for me, thanks. What would you like, Goghie?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> A soft drink for me. How about you, Goghie?</p><hr><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> Me? Oh... Uh... What should I get...?</p><p><strong>Nemo Baker:</strong><br> We also have absinthe.</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> Hwa!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Absinthe?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Is that your favorite drink or something?</p><hr><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> N-not at all! In fact, if I never see another bottle...<br> it&#39;ll still be too soon!!!</p><p><strong>Nemo Baker:</strong><br> Oh... I&#39;m sorry. I was just trying to make a joke.<br> I hope I didn&#39;t offend you.</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> Oh, no, please don&#39;t worry about me... Let me explain, Master. Back in my time, absinthe was one of the most popular kinds of alcohol in Paris.</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> It&#39;s pretty strong, especially for the low price, and it&#39;s served with a sugar cube to sweeten it, which made it pretty dangerous if you got hooked. Some people even thought it might have dangerous side effects...</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> Anyway, most artists back then would drink it whenever they were feeling down... And a lot of them drank themselves to death...</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> I didn&#39;t drink it all that much myself, though... Ehehe. Lautrec was a lot more...knowledgeable about it.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Now I see.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Sounds kind of traumatic.</p><hr><p><strong>Nemo Baker:</strong><br> In that case... Oh, come to think of it, I believe I saw at least one bottle of it...</p><p><strong>Nemo Baker:</strong><br> Here we go. Ta-daaa. It&#39;s elderflower cordial! People used to drink this in the Netherlands all the time, right?</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> Hwa!?</p><p><strong>Nemo Baker:</strong><br> Uh-oh... Did I touch a nerve again?</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> O-oh, no, I was just surprised to see Dutch writing again! I&#39;d love a cordial! It&#39;s just as beautiful as I remembered, like the rays of the sun itself!</p><p><strong>Nemo Baker:</strong><br> Hehehe. Would you like a glass of the same, Master?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Definitely.</p><hr><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> It&#39;s so sweet!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> It&#39;s so refreshing!</p><hr><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> I know! The gentle sweetness and fragrant aroma really bring out the flavor! Ehehe...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Are you having fun now?</p><hr><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> Oh yes, definitely!<br> Thank you for making time for me, Master...</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> I promise I&#39;ll do my best to sort through my feelings so I can do the jobs you need me to... Ehehe...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I&#39;m glad to hear that and all, but...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Sure, work&#39;s important, but you can&#39;t forget to have fun either!</p><hr><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> ?</p><p><strong>Nemo Baker:</strong><br> Goghie, I think Master just wants to see you smile.</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> Huh? Oh, uh...</p><p><strong>Nemo Baker:</strong><br> I know. I&#39;m sorry the Nautilus doesn&#39;t have much in the way of entertainment.</p><p><strong>Nemo Baker:</strong><br> There&#39;s still some time to go before the next meal, so maybe you could grab a spare marine and do something fun with them?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Say, I&#39;ve got an idea.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> What about painting a picture?</p><hr><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> No way! Do you paint too, Master!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Not at all, but it looks like fun.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> No, but it seems like it&#39;d be fun.</p><hr><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> Fun!? Of course it&#39;s fun! It&#39;s super fun!</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> Oh, this is great! I&#39;ll finally get to paint with someone else again! I can even teach you a little! Oh, this is gonna be so, so fun!</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> It&#39;s already so much fun that–</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> ...I went and bloomed. Whoops, ehehe...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> A Spirit Origin Ascension!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Wow, you look more grown-up now!</p><hr><p><strong>Nemo Baker:</strong><br> Wow, Goghie, you look so much more mature now!<br> I&#39;m kind of jealous!</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> Oh? Hmm, I guess this outfit is a little more feminine... But then, why wouldn&#39;t it be? I am a girl, after all.</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> But, wait... Vincent&#39;s a boy... The oldest son of the Van Gogh family, and a lazy good-for-nothing...</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> I remember Kee, Uncle Stricker&#39;s daughter, rejected me... And how things didn&#39;t go well with Sien the prostitute, either...</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> Wait. Hm? Huh?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> We&#39;re under attack! (Phew, saved by the alarm!)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Sorry Goghie, we&#39;ll have to finish our date later!</p><hr><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> O-oh, yes, of course, ehehe, wait, whaaa...!?<br> We&#39;re under attack!? I mean, this was a date!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Let&#39;s go take care of them.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Once we beat them, let&#39;s paint something together, okay?</p><hr><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> Y-yes! Of course! In fact, I think I could destroy any monster that tries to mess with us now! Heh, ehehe...!</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> There you are, Master! We&#39;ve got a close-combat fight on our hands! Small enemies are swarming our outer Bounded Field!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Why now?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Did someone make a loud noise again?</p><hr><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> I don&#39;t know what got their attention, but for now, we need to focus on getting rid of them! And make sure to do it as quietly as possible!</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> I already heard about what happened with you, Van Gogh! While I&#39;d love to run some detailed tests, right now, we need all the help we can get! Are you ready to head out!?</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> Yes, of course! I&#39;ll do the best I can!</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Nemo Nurse:</strong><br> ...There we go. I&#39;ve restored all the injured Servants to prime condition.</p><p><strong>Nemo Nurse:</strong><br> However, there&#39;s still an issue with you, Van Gogh. We need to study the effects your new Ascension may be having.</p><p><strong>Nemo Nurse:</strong><br> The change in skin color is especially striking... Anyway, we need to make sure there are no adverse health effects.</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> By all means, study away! It&#39;s okay if the tests are a little painful! I like pain!</p><p><strong>Nemo Nurse:</strong><br> Well, I appreciate you being so cooperative. All right, I&#39;ll go get Professor in here to help me.</p><p><strong>Nemo Nurse:</strong><br> I&#39;m sorry to have you postpone your date again, Master, but please try to understand. Captain&#39;s orders and all.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> No problem. Take good care of Goghie for me.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Guess we&#39;ll just have to paint pictures later then!</p><hr><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> Thank you, Master! Please, let me shake your hand!<br> I&#39;ll come back to you later! I promise!</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Mash &amp; Nemo &amp; Yang Guifei:</strong><br> Master!!!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Aah!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> What!? What are you all doing here!?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Well, I know this wasn&#39;t very respectful of your privacy, Master, but since there are a number of issues involving Van Gogh, we, um, took the liberty of following you...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I&#39;m so sorry...</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> I just wanted to say how incredibly touched I am, Master!</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> Your date was just unbelievably precious! And you didn&#39;t even try to pry into Goghie&#39;s history!</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> You were so considerate of her, too! I especially loved how you got her out of her shell and talking to other people so naturally!</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> (Siiigh) The whole thing was just so beautiful and heartwarming... It reminds me of the time I spent in the inner palace!</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Incidentally, Osakabehime loudly mumbled something similar right before she said she was getting a stomachache and holed herself up in her room.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Anyway, while I do think your thoughtfulness is praiseworthy, it&#39;s also exactly why I have to say something about how you interact with her.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> The fact is, we need to make a decision about whether we should continue to treat her like just another Servant.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Does that mean you suspect she&#39;s behind this whole incident, Captain?</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> No, it doesn&#39;t. But given her unstable Foreigner Spirit Origin, we have to be aware of the risks that come with her mental instability and bipolar tendencies.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Between the spontaneous Ascension due to her buoyed mental state, and the seemingly extreme changes to her Spirit Origin that occurred as a result, there are too many factors at play that we can neither understand nor control.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Throw in her Foreigner class status, and there&#39;s just no telling what kind of danger she might ultimately pose.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Of course, I think there might also be a reason why Yang Guifei, another Foreigner, is here during this highly unusual situation.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> It may be that Van Gogh has yet to reach her final Foreigner form...</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> ...and if that form turns out to be an enemy we need to defeat, that might be why Yang Guifei was summoned here.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> So...kind of like the Counter Force?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> That does sound like what happened with XX in Luluhawa...</p><hr><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> Huh? You&#39;re kidding, right...?</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> I can&#39;t do that! No way!</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> I know I only just met Goghie recently,<br> but she&#39;s already like a sister to me!</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Let me be clear that we are discussing a worst-case scenario here.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> But, if it does come to that,<br> we&#39;ll need to be ready, Fujimaru.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> ...Oh, hang on. I just got an update from Nurse.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> After taking a look at Van Gogh&#39;s Spirit Origin Ascension, she said she couldn&#39;t find anything noteworthy outside of a marked increase in magical energy capacity.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> In fact, given her unusual blood and spiritual properties, her new skin color might even be closer to her model form.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> At this point, we simply can&#39;t be definitive... But if we agree that she&#39;s potentially dangerous, we can still change how we treat her.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> For example, we could put her Spirit Origin into a sleep mode, like General Xiang Yu, or we could build a new, isolated chamber for her and confine her there.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> I know how harsh that all sounds, but if we think of it as ensuring a guest gets the necessary chance at recovery, it&#39;s more than humane.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> However, unfortunate though it may seem, we should limit how much you interact with her from now on, Master. After all, you&#39;re my Master now, which means you&#39;re also the Nautilus&#39;s lifeline.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I get what you&#39;re saying, Nemo...but I can&#39;t agree to that.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I hear you...but that&#39;s not how I&#39;d like to handle this.</p><hr><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Why not? Are you forgetting Van Gogh might be responsible for this entire situation?</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> What if continuing to interact with her freely ends up putting not just you, or the Nautilus, but all of Chaldea and Proper Human History at risk?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> We still don&#39;t know for sure that she&#39;s dangerous.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Even if she does turn out to be dangerous,I&#39;d rather solve the problem by sticking together.</p><hr><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> ...I see.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> So if things take a dangerous turn, you&#39;d prefer to get in close and find out the cause of the danger instead of just trying to make it go away.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> All right. If that is your decision...</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> ...then I am officially relieving you of command.</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> Huh!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Captain!?</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Is it that surprising? Masters and Servants are basically just two people connected by Command Spells. There&#39;s no law saying we have to do everything our Master says.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> And in your case especially, Fujimaru,<br> your Command Spell authority isn&#39;t even completely binding. If I think you&#39;re making a mistake, there&#39;s nothing stopping me from acting accordingly.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Yes, I am a Servant, but I&#39;m a Phantom Spirit first. My Spirit Origin may not be anything special, but that doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m not willing to make tough calls when necessary.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> And as the captain of this ship, I can&#39;t in good conscience follow a Master who would knowingly allow a dangerous element to move around unfettered.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> It&#39;s going to be a major problem for morale on the rest of this voyage unless we set the record straight here and now.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> So...as clichéd as it might sound,<br> I challenge you to a fight, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> If you win, I&#39;ll apologize for insubordination and swear fealty from then on. If you lose, you&#39;ll resign your post as acting commander and agree to follow my commands instead.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Captain, with all due respect, this is no time to be fighting among ourselves! Master, please, tell him why–</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Okay, let&#39;s do it.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> All right. Mash, get the simulator ready, would you?</p><hr><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> Master!? You&#39;re not serious, are you!?<br> Tell me you&#39;re not serious!</p><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> Ahh, what a wonderful sight to see after exiting my workshop for the first time in ages. I can practically feel my Spirit Origin being rejuvenated.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> D-do you really think so, Scáthach-Skadi!? Because it seems to me like the Nautilus&#39;s chain of command is on the verge of collapse!</p><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> Don&#39;t be ridiculous, Mash.</p><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> Fighting to resolve their differences is something my beloved children have done since ancient times. It is a truly heartwarming sight.</p><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> I see no reason why this dispute should be any different. There is always something to be learned through fierce competition with one&#39;s peers, regardless of age or gender!</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> D-does this really qualify as fierce competition?</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> I just want to make sure we don&#39;t have any regrets.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> It would be a huge waste to stand around blaming one another for things we did or didn&#39;t do that are only clear in hindsight.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> And I have absolutely no patience for pointless debate that just goes in endless circles.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> We need to make it abundantly clear who suggested what, who agreed to it, and who&#39;s ultimately responsible for it, or this whole mission will end in abject failure.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> All the more so given how we&#39;re all stuck together in the tight confines of a submarine.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> So this will be our fair and impartial court. Once we fight, we&#39;ll know where things stand. Simple as a sand dollar.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> All right, Master Fujimaru!<br> Come at me with everything you&#39;ve got!</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Let&#39;s see which of us has the strength of our convictions!</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> (Sulking)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Um...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Pretty sure I won...</p><hr><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> ...Aren&#39;t duels supposed to be fought one-on-one?<br> Why&#39;d you bring a full roster?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You said to come at you with everything I&#39;ve got, so...</p><hr><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> ...Talk about winning on a technicality...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> U-um, Captain Nemo?<br> Are you satisfied with these results?</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> ...(Sigh) Yes, it&#39;s fine. As promised, from now on, I&#39;ll go along with whatever you want to do, Acting Commander.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> If Van Gogh ends up causing any problems down the line, every crew member on this ship will face them together.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> We also won&#39;t blame Van Gogh, or Master...</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> ...or even any of the Servants who helped Master win our battle just now, for putting us in that position.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Basically, regardless of what dangers might befall the Nautilus in the future, the whole crew will be responsible for resolving them.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> That&#39;s all.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I knew you&#39;d understand, Captain Nemo!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Thanks, Nemo!</p><hr><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Yeah, yeah.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> So now that I&#39;ve lost, that&#39;s the end of it. I&#39;m not going to apologize. Too embarrassing.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Fine with me.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Don&#39;t worry about it.</p><hr><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> ...All right, I know this is short notice, but now that that&#39;s settled, there&#39;s something I&#39;d like to talk to you about, Acting Commander.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Oh, and it&#39;s top secret, so I&#39;d like you all to give us some privacy. Sorry to leave you out again, Mash.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> I, um... I&#39;m sorry.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> So you&#39;re apologizing after all!?</p><hr><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> No, not about that.<br> I still believe my actions were justified.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> I&#39;m apologizing for what I said before you shared your position... For my own weakness.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> When you get right down to it, I basically forced you to make a decision I wasn&#39;t comfortable making myself.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Speaking purely emotionally...I don&#39;t want to treat her...Van Gogh badly. I really don&#39;t.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> But the Nemo Series&#39; is divided on the subject of what to do about her. Engineer, the Marines, and Baker all agree with letting her roam free, Nurse is fine either way, and Professor wants to keep her confined.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> So I ended up foisting the decision onto you, even though, as captain of this ship, it should have been my call.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> And that&#39;s what I&#39;m apologizing for: my inability to make a tough decision.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...Okay, got it. All that aside:Do you actually have a soft spot for Van Gogh?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Does your desire to treat Van Gogh well haveanything to do with her similarities to you?</p><hr><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> ...More or less. I&#39;m not a real Heroic Spirit, at least, not like the others. I&#39;m a mixture of two separate Heroic Spirits and their legends.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> I know I settled on Nemo during our voyage in India, but that doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;ve made my peace with my dueling identities.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> ...I have a feeling Van Gogh&#39;s going through similar hardships. That&#39;s why, deep down, I&#39;d really like nothing more than to help her.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> I think, from a mental perspective, you can save her. But that still leaves the problems of the Extra class...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> As long as we all stick together, things will work out.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I&#39;m not worried. Not with all of us working together.</p><hr><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> ...If you say so. Good grief.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> ...Thanks, Master.</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> Ehehe... Ehehe... I&#39;m so glad...they let me out of the infirmary... That was the best night...I&#39;ve had in ages...</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> It was so much fun...teaching you how to paint, Master... Your croquis technique...really improved quickly, too...</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> I really enjoyed seeing...some of Hokusai&#39;s original paintings, too... Ahh, I&#39;m so happy... Ehehe... I wonder if this is all a dream... Ehehe...</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> Ahh, it really does feel like a dream... Such pretty warm light all around me... I&#39;m so happy... So happy that...</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> I bloomed!!!</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> Juuust kidding! Just another Van Goghk for you.<br> Van Goghk... Joking... Van Goghking around!</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> Ehehe! Ehehe! I usually never get this excited! I almost feel high! I&#39;m high Van Gogh! Heigh-ho, heigh-ho, it&#39;s off to paint I Van Gogh!</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> Ahh... I think I just ran out of magical energy...<br> Now I&#39;m a little sleepy... Ehehe... Good night...</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> Thank you so much, Master...<br> I&#39;m so grateful to you...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Congratulations on finishing your first painting session with Van Gogh, Senpai.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I saw that you stayed up all night painting with her after she was released with a clean bill of health... It did seem more like training at an art dojo than a creative exercise, though...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Turns out Van Gogh&#39;s a REALLY strict art teacher.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> That was the toughest art lesson I&#39;ve ever had, bar none.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Still, of all the things you did on your date, she seemed to enjoy herself the most while teaching you how to paint!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You really think so?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Is that what it looked like to you?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Y-yes... Why? Was that not the case?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> To me, it looked like she was trying to havefun so as not to think about anything else.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> It seemed to me like she was using funto distract herself from her problems.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Really?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Th-that&#39;s a little hard to believe, but if that&#39;s what you think, Senpai, you&#39;re probably right.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> But then, I wonder what we have to do to see her genuinely happy...</p><h2 id="act-two-the-thunder-shooter-s-fishing-ground-3-4" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#act-two-the-thunder-shooter-s-fishing-ground-3-4" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Act Two: The Thunder Shooter&#39;s Fishing Ground (3/4)</h2><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> I&#39;m here, and ready for the meeting!<br> So what&#39;s this all about, Master?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Your guess is as good as mine.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Looks like we&#39;ll be finding out together.</p><hr><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> Hm? So you don&#39;t know either?<br> It seems no one here knows.</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> That must mean Captain called this meeting. What&#39;s more, none of the other leaders know what it&#39;s about, and the goddess isn&#39;t here for some reason...</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> It can only mean one of two things then! Either a pleasant surprise, or some dire technical news!</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> Dire... Ehehe, dire is great... It&#39;s only when people are confronted with something dire...that their true beauty starts to shine through...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Huh?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> You changed back?</p><hr><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> The Professor gave me some weird concoction...that turned me back... Just kidding. Another Van Goghk for you...</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> I decided to stay in this form most of the time...because it uses less magical energy...and it&#39;s also less depressing...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I guess that other form was a little prone to, uh, overexcitement.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> True, you did tend to get a little, uh, worked up like that.</p><hr><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> Yeah... But when I felt down, I felt really, really down... Let&#39;s just say the day after our date...was kind of rough... Ehehe...</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> Anyway, regardless of what kind of news we get...<br> I&#39;ll be with you all the way, Master... Ehehe...</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> Wh-whoa! I&#39;m glad to see you thinking more positively, Goghie, but I&#39;m not about to lose a battle for Master&#39;s affection anytime soon!</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> Ehehe... I look forward to continuing to serve Master alongside you, Lady Yang Guifei...</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> ...Me too! No matter what kind of universe-shattering news we get, we&#39;ll be fine as long we stick together!</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Hello, everyone.<br> I appreciate you all coming on such short notice.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> As of a few minutes ago, we officially passed our<br> one-hundred and fifty hour Void Space time limit.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Whoa.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Oh yeah, I&#39;d forgotten about that.</p><hr><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> I initially thought we wouldn&#39;t be able to survive more than one-hundred and fifty hours out here.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> All the resources we brought with us from Chaldea are now gone. Under other circumstances, this would be the point where I admit defeat and fall on my sword...but these aren&#39;t normal circumstances.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> We&#39;re still alive, and we&#39;re going to keep it that way. It may take longer to escape than I first thought, but there&#39;s definitely a light at the end of this tunnel. One way or another, we WILL make it out of here.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> That&#39;s why I asked you all here: to remind you of how far we&#39;ve come, and to start anew, with fresh purpose!</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Great work, all of you! Keep it up, and I have no doubt we&#39;ll be back before we know it!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Aye, aye, Captain!</p><hr><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Now, I thought you all deserved a little reward, so Scáthach-Skadi and I took the liberty of putting something together.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> We couldn&#39;t go as all out as we would have liked,<br> but I hope you enjoy it all the same.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> All right, next stop: the crew mess!</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> ...?</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> Is something wrong, Lady Yang Guifei? Come on, let&#39;s hurry... I don&#39;t want to miss the food, ehehe...</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> I thought I heard something...<br> Maybe it was just my imagination?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Wow, look, Senpai! It&#39;s a veritable feast!</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> All kinds of bread... Fried fish and potatoes... Ehehe, even kinds of food I&#39;ve never even seen before... It&#39;s like Easter or something!</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Shrimp cocktails, oysters kilpatrick, gejang, moqueca, gumbo, steamed fish... It&#39;s like seafood tengoku in here!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> They&#39;ve even got curry!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Now it really feels like I&#39;ve joined the navy!</p><hr><p><strong>Nemo Baker:</strong><br> Dig in, everyone☆<br> There&#39;s plenty to go around!</p><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> Indeed, the chef and I worked hard to prepare this banquet. Enjoy and be grateful, my beloved children.</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> ...Um, Master? Given what the captain said about all of the initial resources being gone...this means all this food was made from void monsters, right?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I&#39;ll admit I was a little worried, but I guess I didn&#39;t have to be.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Yeah, but you&#39;d never guess that from looking at it.</p><hr><p><strong>Nemo Professor:</strong><br> Yes, victory is ours. At first, I was just hoping to be able to extract the three major nutrient groups along with essential vitamins and minerals.</p><p><strong>Nemo Professor:</strong><br> But the goddess and Baker insisted that proper meals are key to our operation here, and they helped me make leaps and bounds in our ingredient conversion techniques.</p><p><strong>Nemo Professor:</strong><br> So I even figured out ways to contribute to the ship&#39;s renovations. Suffice to say, our magecraft workshop-slash-kitchen has been on a roll, with no signs of slowing down.</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> Hmm. At first blush, this does seem like a feast as grand as anything served in the palace during the Tang dynasty, but...</p><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> These are no mere imitation dishes. We have used magecraft to transform them into something completely different from their origins.</p><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> Even so, some things would have been more trouble to transform than they were worth, so for dishes that used such ingredients, we took the liberty of swapping in other reality-converted magical creatures.</p><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> For example, the fried mandragora.</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> This calls for a Servant safety taste test!<br> Pardon me, Master!</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> Hao chi! It&#39;s just as delicious as it looks, and it&#39;s completely safe to eat! Don&#39;t worry, Master! Taste testing is actually something of a specialty of mine!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Okay, I&#39;m officially too hungry to hold off anymore!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Then let&#39;s eat already!</p><hr><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> Ehehe, this feels almost sinful... I hardly ever got to eat my fill back when I was alive...</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> And a gourmet meal like this would&#39;ve been out of the question... (Munch, munch)... Oh, could I have another one of these? ...Thanks... (Munch, munch)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> (I knew it. Her behavior and memories don&#39;t quite line up.)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> (I&#39;m glad she&#39;s getting a chance to eat her fill now.)</p><hr><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> ...Fujimaru, can I talk to you for a moment?</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> We kind of splurged on time and resources to prepare this feast. We can&#39;t do this sort of thing all the time.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> But a submarine is a sealed environment. Its passengers need some way to vent that stress, and a good meal is one of the best ways to do so. That&#39;s just as true for Heroic Spirits as it is for regular people.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> What I mean is, I&#39;d like to continue being pretty generous with the resources we allocate to meals. These kinds of things aren&#39;t just a luxury; they&#39;re a necessity, at least from time to time.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> So on that note, if you happen to notice any other sources of stress or dissatisfaction among the crew, I&#39;d appreciate it if you let me know about them.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Will do.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> You got it. Thanks, Captain.</p><hr><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> That said, I might be getting ahead of myself. After all, if all goes well, we won&#39;t have to stay in the Void Sea much longer.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> (That sounds a lot like tempting fate to me...)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> (I hope that optimism doesn&#39;t come back to bite us...)</p><hr><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> There you are, Fujimaru. Are you enjoying the food? Good, good. That makes this meal worth all the hard work I put into it.</p><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> Speaking of which, I actually prepared a special dish just for you. Not even the captain knows about it.</p><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> Tell me, are you still hungry?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Definitely.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Absolutely!</p><hr><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> Good, good. Very well then–</p><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> Hm!? Now what is it!? An all-you-can-eat special!?</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> We&#39;re under attack! But how did they find us!? I was sure we were running silent!</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Anyway, it looks like the rest of the party will have to wait! All hands to battle stations!</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> Huh!? But I&#39;m still not done!</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> Don&#39;t worry, Goghie! Think of it as a little mid-meal walk to aid with digestion! Once we&#39;re done with this, we can come back and eat even more!</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> Oh! Ehehe, what a sinful idea! Please don&#39;t forget to leave some food for me, Captain!</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Of course! Baker, we&#39;re going to need more party resources, double-time!</p><p><strong>Nemo Baker:</strong><br> Aye, aye, Captain! Good luck, everyone!</p><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> Very well, that last dish and I will be here waiting. Make sure you don&#39;t take too long.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I can&#39;t wait to see what it is!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I&#39;ll head to the bridge! Combat team, get to the air lock!</p><hr><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Oh, hello, Master. It&#39;s wonderful we were able to resume the party, isn&#39;t it?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Now it&#39;s more of a victory party.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> It&#39;s important for warriors to be rewarded for proving their valor in battle, so I think this was a wonderful idea.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Yes, all things are welcome in moderation. One mustn&#39;t indulge in depravity on a daily basis, of course, but days of good tidings should be celebrated joyously, without reservation.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Are you enjoying the food too, Raikou?</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Oh yes. This fermented shark...“hákarl” I think it was called, has been so surprisingly good that I found myself going back for seconds.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> ...Oh my, this will never do. I need to shape up before I find myself growing lazy!</p><hr><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> So on that note, I would like<br> to take this occasion to sing!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Uhhh–</p><hr><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> Hmm. Maybe this is where I&#39;m meant to come in?</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Hehe, that won&#39;t be necessary.<br> We already have all the sound equipment we need!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> O-oh wow, a high-end karaoke set just popped up from the floor! How is that even possible!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Also, are we sure it&#39;s a good idea to sing,<br> given our current circumstances?</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Sure, it&#39;ll be fine.<br> We already took out all the enemies in this area.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Besides, we took the trouble of making this party gear. It&#39;d be a shame not to use it. Let&#39;s just sit back and enjoy her show.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> This goes out to all my beloved children waiting for me in Chaldea...“The Tale of Slashing the Heike”!</p><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> Mmm, very nice. Very nice indeed.</p><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> By the way, Fujimaru,<br> I trust you remember our promise?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Of course.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I couldn&#39;t wait to get back to try it.</p><hr><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> Hehe, wonderful. I&#39;m glad to hear it.</p><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> Very well then, feast your eyes, and your taste buds, on this one-of-a-kind culinary masterpiece!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Uh...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Is that...?</p><hr><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> Indeed, it is void monster sashimi with the head and tail still intact.</p><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> I am told sashimi is a modern delicacy, and freshness is crucial to its preparation. It always sounded fascinating.</p><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> I thought this would be an excellent chance to try my hand at it, so I skipped the magecraft transformation for this monster and tried simply carving it raw.</p><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> I also have traditional sashimi condiments such as soy sauce and wasabi on hand should you wish to make use of them.</p><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> All right, my Master...as they say nowadays, dig in!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Just curious, but, did you happen to taste this yourself?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I don&#39;t suppose you taste-tested it, did you?</p><hr><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> No, I did not.</p><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> I thought you should be the first to try it. Oh, worry not, there are no toxins. I made sure of that during our analysis.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Ulp... I&#39;ve never seen sashimi with such knobby suckers or veiny skin before, but in a way, it almost looks...not unappetizing?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I-I know we&#39;ve eaten monsters out of necessity before, but seeing one prepared raw like this is very, uh, novel!</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> Wow, is this sushi!? If you don&#39;t want it, Master,<br> I&#39;d be happy to take it off your hands!</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> Oh no you don&#39;t! I need to taste-test it to make sure it&#39;s safe first!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> No, I need to be the first one to try it!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> (Silently make peace with your maker)All right, down the hatch!</p><hr><h2 id="act-two-the-thunder-shooter-s-fishing-ground-4-4" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#act-two-the-thunder-shooter-s-fishing-ground-4-4" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Act Two: The Thunder Shooter&#39;s Fishing Ground (4/4)</h2><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Good news, crew! Thanks to all your hard work, we&#39;re finally ready to leave these waters behind!</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> There are still a number of large enemy ships blocking our exit, but this time, we&#39;ve got a plan.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> We&#39;ve been racking up victories against these ships thanks to Raikou&#39;s incredible firepower, and I fully expect to keep or streak alive.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> I&#39;ve already got her in position, and according to our calculations, we should be able to finish this battle with about six lightning strikes from her Noble Phantasm.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> That said, if the plan goes awry, there&#39;s still a risk the enemy will counterattack and call for reinforcements again, so we&#39;ll need to be ready for that possibility, too.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Combat team, you&#39;ll remain on standby here in the ship.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> If worse comes to worst, we may also need to release the Nautilus Noble Phantasm again. I trust we&#39;re all good to go on that front now, Engine Room?</p><p><strong>Nemo Engineer:</strong><br> Hell yeah! I&#39;m still a little uneasy seein&#39; how we only just finished patchin&#39; the engine up, but we&#39;ll do what we gotta do, Captain!</p><p><strong>Nemo Engineer:</strong><br> If we gotta ram the hell outta those ships to make it outta here, then I&#39;ll make it happen if it&#39;s the last thing I ever do! Engine room out!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I feel bad for always asking so much of Nemo Engineer... We&#39;ll have to do our best to pick up the slack too.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Right you are.<br> I&#39;m expecting great things from all of you!</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> We&#39;ll begin the operation in T-minus six hundred seconds, but before we do, there&#39;s something I need to discuss with the acting commander in private.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Okay, you can come in now.</p><p><strong>D：???:</strong><br> Hehehe, very well.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Aah!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Raikou? I thought you were already outside the ship.</p><hr><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> It&#39;s a bit of a long story...</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> I&#39;ve actually been having Raikou investigate some things on the Nautilus in her capacity as shadow prefect...</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> ...and I asked her to let me know if she found anything suspicious, or anyone doing anything suspicious.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> I&#39;m sorry. While I do think it was worthwhile to have her keep a low profile, it doesn&#39;t excuse the fact that I overstepped my authority by ordering one of your Servants.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> That&#39;s okay. So what&#39;d you find, Raikou?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> So we&#39;re here because you found something then, Raikou?</p><hr><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Well, as it happens, I didn&#39;t find anything suspicious at all.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> This Spirit Origin isn&#39;t very well-suited to espionage, so I&#39;ve been going about my investigation quite openly...</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> ...and if nothing else, I can tell you that I found no signs of suspicious behavior on anyone&#39;s part during the two assaults the Nautilus has faced thus far.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> That includes the ones called Yang Guifei and Van Gogh.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I see... So you thought they might have something to do with this.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> True, they both did stick pretty close to me when they first showed up.</p><hr><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Naturally, I investigated these newcomers especially thoroughly to ensure any undesirables keep their distance from you, Master.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> But no matter how hard I looked, I found no evidence of suspicious behavior on their part during either assault.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> In fact, I can even say with certainty that there were no loud sounds produced in or by the Nautilus prior to those attacks.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Really?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Weird. I wonder how they found us then.</p><hr><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> I actually talked to everyone about this to confirm it for myself, and I learned something very interesting.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> While she doesn&#39;t know where it came from or what it could be, Yang Guifei was the only one who mentioned she thought she heard a strange sound before we were attacked.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> If that&#39;s true, it could be an enemy pinger.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> What&#39;s a pinger?</p><hr><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> It&#39;s an active form of sonar, which finds objects by emitting sound waves and seeing which ones bounce back.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> The pinger is the device that emits the sound waves.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Assuming that&#39;s what happened, that means the enemy has started searching from us.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Up till now, we&#39;ve only seen and captured void enemies who have been swimming and hunting on instinct alone, but that might be changing.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> While it&#39;s possible that at least one enemy who excels in covert abilities has been cunningly hiding their true intelligence from the beginning...</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> ...it could also be that the enemy is learning.<br> Or maybe...evolving.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> At least this clears the crew of suspicion.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> At least we know we don&#39;t need to suspect anyone here now.</p><hr><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> For now, anyway.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> During the victory party, I went out of my way to make noise to see if anyone in attendance would react suspiciously, but saw nothing of the sort.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Huh? That&#39;s why you sang!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> So your karaoke thing was all part of a sting operation!?</p><hr><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> W-well of course it was! Can you truly imagine me<br> actually choosing to do anything so indecent otherwise!?</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> We actually recorded that song ahead of time and used a polar opposite waveform to ensure its sound would be canceled out before it could escape the ship.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> If the enemy had attacked us then, it would&#39;ve given the idea that someone inside the ship was covertly controlling them more credence, but of course, that never happened.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Anyway, I&#39;m very grateful for Raikou&#39;s help.<br> She&#39;s been invaluable for gathering intel.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> (Sniff) Now everyone thinks<br> of me as “Mic-Hog Raikou”...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> (I totally did too, ahaha.)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> (Just smile and nod. Smile and nod...)</p><hr><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Oh, it&#39;s all right, Master. I would do anything to protect that precious smile of yours!</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Rest assured, Captain, I will continue to carry out my shadow prefectorial duties! If there is anything else I can help with, please don&#39;t hesitate to let me know!</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Now, if you&#39;ll excuse me, I must return to my post as our torpedo launcher!</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> ...Espionage might not be her strong suit, but having more Servants devoted to keeping you safe can only be a good thing.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Hey now, cheer up. The operation&#39;s about to begin, remember? Then again, a few worry lines might actually help you seem more like a real commander.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Personally, I&#39;m really happy about this. Even if it is only for the time being, it feels good knowing we have no cause to suspect anyone on the crew.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Now come on. We&#39;ve got new waters out there just waiting to be explored.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> The Vajra of Gozu-Tenno...reincarnation of the goddess Indra. The lance of divinity made from sacred bones...</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Come forth and annihilate all evil...and just for now, do so as quietly as possible...</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Vajra of Indra... Hup.</p><p><strong>Nemo Professor:</strong><br> Computer room here. Torpedo number three has been fired, and our magical energy supply is still holding steady. Have we got confirmation of impact?</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> Nnn... There, it just hit! It&#39;s hard to make out through the sound of Alpha blowing up, but I think it took out target Bravo.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> So all of our torpedoes so far have hit their targets, and still no return fire. It looks like we might have an overwhelming advantage against enemy ships now.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Yup. Everything&#39;s going as smooth<br> as a whale shark&#39;s swimming path.</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> Oh! Wait! I just heard that sound again...<br> We might have another ambush on our hands!</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> ...Damn, I guess I should&#39;ve known it wouldn&#39;t be that easy! Combat team, prepare to deploy!</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> H-h-hang on. This Bounded Field signal... This isn&#39;t<br> a bunch of little ones! We&#39;ve got a full-blown enemy ship incoming!</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> What!? An enemy ship is making its way toward us!?</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> They must&#39;ve used an active ping to locate us!<br> Dammit, of all the times...!</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Computer room! Can you switch Raikou&#39;s next target to this incoming ship!?</p><p><strong>Nemo Professor:</strong><br> Negative. Calculating Void Space coordinates and entering them into the homing spell is actually an incredibly advanced and delicate operation. I need at least three hundred seconds.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Dammit! All right then, we&#39;ll just have to use my Nautilus Noble Phantasm to–</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> We can&#39;t use it now!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> But Raikou&#39;s still out there!</p><hr><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> ...Then we might be done for. If they attack us and give our position away to the other enemy ships, we&#39;ll be surrounded.</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> Ehehehe, ehehe... Um...</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> What is it, Van Gogh? Do you think your Noble<br> Phantasm can get us out of this again?</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> No... But... In this form...I think I can help...without relying on some strange, mysterious Noble Phantasm...</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> I can draw a platform...where Lady Raikou is standing now...so that she can continue...sinking enemy ships...</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> While she does, the Nautilus can slowly reverse...luring the ship approaching us away from her...so we can use Captain Nemo&#39;s Noble Phantasm...to destroy it safely...</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> Would that work? Heh, ehehe...</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> ...!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> How about it, Captain!?</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> ...Yeah, that should work! I certainly don&#39;t see us coming up with a better idea in the time we have!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> What do you think, Professor!?</p><p><strong>Nemo Professor:</strong><br> It definitely sounds better than twiddling our thumbs, waiting to die!</p><hr><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> All right, Van Gogh, do it!</p><hr><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> Heh, hehehe, ehehehe! As you wish, Master!</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> I&#39;m glad we have a plan now, but we&#39;re still very much in the woods! I&#39;m hearing tons of things swimming our way ahead of the approaching enemy ship!</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Got it. Then the combat team will protect Raikou while she focuses on her torpedo duties from Van Gogh&#39;s platform...</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> ...and I&#39;ll use my Noble Phantasm to take out the enemy ship at point-blank range once we&#39;re far enough away from Raikou and the combat team!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You heard the captain, everyone!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> All hands, move out!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Understood! This time nothing gets by me!</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Vajra of Indra! There, that should take care of all the enemy ships up ahead!</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> That&#39;s great, but what about us!? The reinforcements just keep coming, and now we&#39;ve got the last big guy headed our way, too!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Is the Nautilus still not ready for your Noble Phantasm, Captain!?</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> We just got into position now! All hands, brace for impact! I&#39;m going to release my Noble Phantasm!</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> Thank goodness. Now we should be safe and sou–</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> Hm? Hang on. I&#39;m hearing a kind of cracking sound coming from our foothol–</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> Aaaaaah!</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> ...There! Engine room, emergency stop! Now!</p><p><strong>Nemo Engineer:</strong><br> Aye, aye, Captain!</p><p><strong>Nemo Marine:</strong><br> All the little ones and the Omega have been wiped out, with no sign of return fire! We did it!</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Yeah, we did–</p><p><strong>Nemo Professor:</strong><br> Oh, we did it all right! The combat team&#39;s platform looks to have fallen apart!</p><p><strong>Nemo Professor:</strong><br> Then they all got blasted away by our Noble Phantasm&#39;s shock wave! We can&#39;t even contact them anymore, either!</p><p><strong>Nemo Professor:</strong><br> They all cut their lifelines in preparation for the attack, so there&#39;s nothing to stop them from drifting to the ends of all logical coordinates!</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> What!? How can we rescue them!?</p><p><strong>Nemo Professor:</strong><br> (Sniff) We can&#39;t! Our attack just sent all the Servants capable of traversing Void Space flying!</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> ...This is terrible. Then, they&#39;re all–</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Easy, Nemo. I&#39;ll get someone to help.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Don&#39;t worry. We can call on someone to help.</p><hr><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Huh!? You want to summon another Servant now!?<br> Do we even have the magical energy for that!?</p><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> This is the workshop. Worry not. We are flush with magical energy right now, and the link to Mash&#39;s shield is still intact.</p><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> Feel free to call forth as many Servants as you need<br> until help arrives, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> ...Okay, let&#39;s do it! Bring in a Servant that&#39;s as good a swimmer as me–someone who can adapt to any kind of sea in the world!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You got it!</p><hr><p><strong>Lambda:</strong><br> I&#39;m Alter Ego Lambda. I don&#39;t know what this is all about, but you called, so I had to answer.</p><p><strong>Lambda:</strong><br> Dark, drab, and dirty place you got here. No sense of aesthetics whatsoever. Even your room in Chaldea is a bit cleaner than–</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Lady Sarasvati! Our savior!</p><p><strong>Lambda:</strong><br> Well now. I try to keep that side of myself secret when I&#39;m in this form, but I guess I couldn&#39;t completely hide my goddess-of-the-arts aura.</p><p><strong>Lambda:</strong><br> Unfortunately for you, though, I&#39;m not her.</p><p><strong>Lambda:</strong><br> I&#39;m Lambdaryllis, lord of the Leviathans. The merciless ruler of the seas; I am a patron of violence rather than the arts.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Right, the penguin!</p><p><strong>Lambda:</strong><br> THAT&#39;S the first thing out of your mouth after<br> summoning me!? And what&#39;s wrong with penguins, anyway!?</p><hr><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> Wonderful! Once again, you brought in just<br> the Heroic Spirit for the job, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> You there, High Servant. Blah, blah, blah...here is your Void Space patch.</p><p><strong>Lambda:</strong><br> ...That&#39;s all you have to say? Do you really think you can order me around like that without a proper explanation? Lostbelt goddess or not, there&#39;s no way I&#39;m putting on some strange gear from who knows whe–</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Come on, Lambdy, pleeease try it on?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> But I was hoping to see you in yourhigh-society stage outfit again, Lambdy!</p><hr><p><strong>Lambda:</strong><br> Lambdy!? You wanna die or something!?</p><p><strong>Lambda:</strong><br> Did being stuck in this hellhole drive you nuts?<br> Are you just a broken doll now?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I will be in about ten more seconds ifyou don&#39;t help the other Servants!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Not yet, but I will be soon if you don&#39;t help us out!Please, you&#39;ve gotta save the other Servants!</p><hr><p><strong>Lambda:</strong><br> Ugh, you really are panicked, aren&#39;t you? I can&#39;t even spare a moment for my usual cruel opening remarks.</p><p><strong>Lambda:</strong><br> All right, it looks like you really are short on time, and I&#39;ve got the gist well enough.</p><p><strong>Lambda:</strong><br> While I loathe wearing anything BB had a hand in,<br> I see it&#39;s a necessary evil here.</p><p><strong>Lambda:</strong><br> I don&#39;t usually take on new jobs so easily, but I suppose I can make an exception this one time...for the right price, obviously.</p><p><strong>Lambda:</strong><br> So if I were you, Master, I&#39;d make sure you&#39;re ready to dig deep into those pockets of yours when the bill comes!</p><p><strong>Lambda:</strong><br> All right, Scáthach-Skadi, hand it over. I&#39;ll show you all my patented fully-liquid-body quick-change technique. The family-friendly version, of course.</p><p><strong>Lambda:</strong><br> Oh, and let me make one more thing clear before we begin: I won&#39;t be doing any fighting this time.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Huh?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Why not?</p><hr><p><strong>Lambda:</strong><br> You really don&#39;t get it? Really?</p><p><strong>Lambda:</strong><br> Have you seen the Void Sea? It&#39;s revolting. I only swim in waters worthy of my elegance.</p><p><strong>Lambda:</strong><br> Oh, don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ll still fulfill your request.<br> You want me to save your friends, right?</p><p><strong>Lambda:</strong><br> Now that I&#39;ve got this void-compatibility chip, my Leviathans can handle the void, too. They&#39;ll have the job done in no time.</p><p><strong>Lambda:</strong><br> Go ahead and get the air lock ready.<br> This&#39;ll be over before you can say triple lutz.</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> Oh man...</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> I seriously thought I was gonna shindie!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> What a dramatic turn of events bringing the mysterious Alter Ego–I mean, Lambda in at our time of need, Senpai!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It was amazing to see how quickly<br> the penguins rescued us, too!</p><p><strong>Lambda:</strong><br> Hehehe. Leviathans, Kyrielight. They are properly referred to as “Leviathans.”</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Indeed, our rescue was truly an act of divine providence. Though I do have some thoughts about the manner in which it was carried out...</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Still, worry not. No matter how high the indecency index may rise, I will simply redouble my prefectoral efforts.</p><p><strong>Lambda:</strong><br> Well that&#39;s a backhanded compliment if ever I&#39;ve heard one. It seems this woman could give Lip a run for her money when it comes to making enemies...actually in more ways than one.</p><p><strong>Lambda:</strong><br> Not that I&#39;m going to be one of those enemies myself. There&#39;s clearly a lot I could learn from her in terms of...well-rounded physical beauty...</p><p><strong>Lambda:</strong><br> Hey. I haven&#39;t seen you around Chaldea before.<br> Who are you?</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Lambda:</strong><br> I sense a kind, but sorrowful song within you.<br> Are you a ny–</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> I... I...</p><p><strong>Lambda:</strong><br> Wha...!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Van Gogh!?</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> Mmph mmph mmph mmmmmmph!<br> (Talking while gnawing on her own arm)</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> S-somebody stop her! Quick!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I just checked on Van Gogh in the infirmary.<br> She seems to have calmed down now.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> She said she felt so guilty about what happened that she got confused, and apologized profusely.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Fortunately, the bites on her arm were only minor injuries. Though of course, that&#39;s no surprise, since she is a pure Heroic Spirit and all...</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> Poor Goghie. I had no idea she was so broken up over our foothold breaking down and putting us all in danger...</p><p><strong>Lambda:</strong><br> ...I see. I must have only made things worse for her.</p><p><strong>Lambda:</strong><br> I mean, a bright shining star like myself talking to her right after such an abject failure?</p><p><strong>Lambda:</strong><br> She must have been so nervous that I can hardly blame her for getting a little mixed up.</p><p><strong>Lambda:</strong><br> Anyway, on a different subject since I, of course, did nothing wrong...</p><p><strong>Lambda:</strong><br> Wait, THAT was Vincent van Gogh?<br> The legendarily troubled artistic genius?</p><p><strong>Lambda:</strong><br> She&#39;s obviously got something else mixed in with her.<br> I trust you&#39;ve already figured out what it is?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Lambda:</strong><br> Huh. You must be pretty twisted yourself, keeping a dangerous girlfriend like that around.</p><p><strong>Lambda:</strong><br> Oh well, it&#39;s none of my business. You there, in the sailor uniform. I&#39;m going to need my own room, along with a private bath.</p><p><strong>Lambda:</strong><br> See you later then, [♂ Mr. /♀️ Ms.] Half-Broken Doll.</p><p><strong>Lambda:</strong><br> You&#39;re used to this kind of chaos, yeah? I&#39;ll just sit back and laugh while you run around trying to contain this mess.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> So now we&#39;ve got yet another...ah, eccentric Servant aboard...</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> A gestalt Servant with multiple Divinities, huh? Well, at least those familiars of hers should be useful.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> They&#39;re Leviathans.</p><hr><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> ...Okay. Let&#39;s just leave it at that.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Anyway, we did the best we could, and things went as well as we could have hoped. I&#39;d say the operation was a success.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Naturally, we&#39;ll take good care of anyone who was injured. I have no criticisms about the way it all went.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Yes, that enemy ship moving in to attack us of its own accord may have caught us off guard, but we still managed to deal with it.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> So I say we&#39;re ready to complete the operation and move on to the next body of water. Any objections?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Not at all. Gotta say though, Van Gogh really saved the day.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Nope. But I&#39;ll have to check in on Van Gogh, later.</p><hr><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Definitely. We wouldn&#39;t have been able to handle that enemy ship if it wasn&#39;t for her quick thinking.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> No one could have expected her platform to fall apart like that, either. She didn&#39;t do anything wrong, and she shouldn&#39;t blame herself for what happened.</p><p><strong>Lambda:</strong><br> Sounds like you&#39;re trying to convince yourself there, my adorable little captain.</p><p><strong>Lambda:</strong><br> What, do you find it suspicious that she was<br> able to manifest new terrain like that?</p><p><strong>Lambda:</strong><br> How dull. How dreadfully boring. If you ask me, a little poisonous suspicion like that is just the spice this bunch needs.</p><p><strong>Lambda:</strong><br> Have you ever thought that maybe you keep finding yourself in these kinds of predicaments because you keep agonizing over every little thing?</p><p><strong>Lambda:</strong><br> Oh well, not my problem. Anyway, I&#39;ll send you my price chart for renting out my Leviathans later, in case you wish to make use of my services again in the future.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> ...So she wasn&#39;t kidding about making us pay for her help, huh. I don&#39;t know if I&#39;ve ever seen a goddess with such a keen business sense.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Let&#39;s just take it one day at a time, Captain.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Well, she does need a lot of money to put on her shows, so...</p><hr><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Oh, I don&#39;t mean it in a bad way. I even get the sense that deep down, she&#39;s a lot like me.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> We work hard, we don&#39;t slack off, and we run a tight ship, both figuratively and literally. I&#39;d say that makes us a perfect match for a Master like you.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Anyway, thanks to you, we have a torpedo substitute and a search and rescue team. As long as you&#39;re here, I think we can overcome whatever we face.</p><h2 id="idle-talk-1" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#idle-talk-1" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Idle Talk 1</h2><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> So we have no sign that something&#39;s wrong other than the prediction that this is all just a dream?</p><p><strong>B：Sion:</strong><br> Right. No matter how many times Trismegistus II runs the numbers, it always arrives at the conclusion that this is a dream.</p><p><strong>B：Sion:</strong><br> Holmes&#39;s reply was, “Fascinating. I believe I will retreat to the world of dreams as well,” before going back to bed. It does not seem like he will be of any help in figuring out what is going on.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Man, I can&#39;t even imagine the kind of thought process that&#39;d lead a machine to doubt its own existence, let alone that of the world around it.</p><p><strong>C：Sion:</strong><br> Well, that is because I am a genius,<br> and everything I make is amazing.</p><p><strong>C：Sion:</strong><br> When Trismegistus II goes to work, it considers every possibility under the sun. It even accounts for entropy as just another kind of abnormality.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Damn, sounds like a hell of a self-confident estimator. I might even be a little jealous.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> So if we take that analysis at face value, does that mean we&#39;re just characters in this dream, who&#39;ll disappear as soon as the dreamer wakes up?</p><p><strong>B：Sion:</strong><br> That, I do not know. I can only say it appears to be<br> at least ninety-nine-percent certain that the dreamer<br> is Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>B：Sion:</strong><br> The very fact that we are here discussing this now must mean that the dreamer is observing us, so maybe we are only constructs of Fujimaru&#39;s unconscious mind.</p><p><strong>B：Sion:</strong><br> And if that is in fact the case,<br> then I do not see much cause for concern.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Hmm. Then maybe I&#39;ll try coming up with a new invention so mind-blowing Fujimaru could never imagine it in a million years...</p><p><strong>C：Sion:</strong><br> I suppose you could, but that would only mean<br> [♂ he /♀️ she] sees you as someone able to do so.</p><p><strong>C：Sion:</strong><br> There is nothing to be gained by trying to fight this! Our only real choice is to sit back and see how things play out.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Hmph. So much for that idea then. Come to think of it, I&#39;ve been neglecting my inventions, but if this really is all a dream, then who cares?</p><p><strong>C：Sion:</strong><br> Oh? I am finding this all very interesting, myself.<br> Hi there, Fujimaru! Are you watching us right now?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Ugh, nothing dampens your intellectual curiosity,<br> does it, Sion? Ah, screw it, I&#39;ll play along, too.<br> Hey, heeey. You seeing this, Fujimaru?</p><p><strong>B：Sion:</strong><br> All right, while we are here, we should probably talk about something important.</p><p><strong>B：Sion:</strong><br> We are currently leaving the Nautilus completely to its own devices. Should we leave it like that, or try to do something to help?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Like what? Even if we wanted to, we don&#39;t have any way of intervening from here. Plus, that bit of weirdness with XX aside, there&#39;s been no sign anything&#39;s gone wrong.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Maybe we could attempt a forced Rayshift with Director Goredolf using his connection to Fujimaru as an anchor?</p><p><strong>B：Sion:</strong><br> ...No, I think we had better not. We do not want to inadvertently risk a dream becoming reality.</p><p><strong>B：Sion:</strong><br> If someone who definitely exists is made to intervene in a world that normally does not exist, the latter would end up incorporating the former.</p><p><strong>B：Sion:</strong><br> In this case, the world that Fujimaru and<br> the Nautilus are in right now would be the dream.</p><p><strong>B：Sion:</strong><br> While those of us staying behind in the Wandering Sea are technically part of that dream, we are also outside of it.</p><p><strong>B：Sion:</strong><br> Essentially, we are in a reality-based dream,<br> and they are in a dream within a dream...</p><p><strong>B：Sion:</strong><br> ...and I cannot recommend crossing that line.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> But crossing lines is what I do. It&#39;s basically my job.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Oh? What&#39;d our resident nincompoop AI observe now?</p><p><strong>C：Sion:</strong><br> Pretending not to hear that... Let me take a look...</p><p><strong>C：Sion:</strong><br> ...Oh great.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Now what? Whatever it is, it can&#39;t possibly be more ridiculous than this dream rigamarole, right?</p><p><strong>C：Sion:</strong><br> What if I told you it said the likelihood of this dream coming true was over eighty percent?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Say what?</p><h2 id="act-three-rallying-cry-from-the-calmest-region-1-6" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#act-three-rallying-cry-from-the-calmest-region-1-6" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Act Three: Rallying Cry from the Calmest Region (1/6)</h2><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Hey there.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I&#39;m coming in, okay?</p><hr><p><strong>Nemo Nurse:</strong><br> Oh, hello, Acting Commander. Are you here to see the patient? Or are you feeling under the weather yourself?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> The patient.</p><p><strong>Nemo Nurse:</strong><br> Understood. I&#39;m sure both she and her other visitor will be thrilled to see you.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Actually, I wanted to see you.</p><p><strong>Nemo Nurse:</strong><br> Aww, that&#39;s very sweet, but I&#39;m sure you&#39;re here first and foremost for the patient. Go on in. She already has another visitor.</p><hr><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> Oh! Master!<br> I&#39;m so sorry!

Enjoying the coffee?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Is that coffee? It smells really good.</p><hr><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> It&#39;s what Van Gogh wanted. I&#39;m more of a tea person myself, but I can go for the occasional cup of joe, too.</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> (Sniff) I don&#39;t deserve this delicious drink... Ehehe, you&#39;d probably all be better off if I were dead...</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> No more of that. Don&#39;t be so hard on yourself.</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> I&#39;m trying, but...it&#39;s hard...</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> I know. It&#39;s okay. Just take it one step at a time.<br> Look, your hands aren&#39;t shaking as bad as before.</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> (Huff, huff, huff...) Okay, I&#39;m calmer now.</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> I really am sorry, Master...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Don&#39;t worry about it.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> It&#39;s okay. You didn&#39;t do anything wrong.</p><hr><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> Oh... Thank you, ehehe. Mr. Nemo was kind enough to say the same, and I&#39;m trying to believe it myself...</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> But I still shouldn&#39;t have...gone crazy like that after we were rescued... I&#39;m so sorry. It&#39;s a bad habit of mine...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Hey, there&#39;s no one right way to be a Heroic Spirit.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Don&#39;t give it a second thought. Really.</p><hr><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> ...You&#39;re so compassionate, Master...<br> Ehehe, you&#39;re going to make me cry...</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> Ahem... Okay, I really have calmed down now.<br> You&#39;re still going to fire me, aren&#39;t you?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Nope. I have another job in mind for you.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Actually, I was thinking about changing the lineup.</p><hr><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Oh? This is the first I&#39;m hearing about this.<br> What kind of formation did you have in mind?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I&#39;ll tell you more on the bridge.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> You&#39;ll see. You still can&#39;t move around, right, Goghie?</p><hr><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> Oh! I-I can move! I&#39;ll go wherever I have to find out what&#39;s going to happen to me!</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Well, we are just about to reach the next area...<br> Okay, Van Gogh, let&#39;s head to the bridge.</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> O-okay...Nemo... Ehehe...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I see... So you&#39;re going to have<br> Van Gogh serve as an advisor?</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> That&#39;s right. While she does have an innate compatibility with Void Space, combat skills aren&#39;t exactly her specialty.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> So bearing that in mind, as well as everything we still don&#39;t know about her Noble Phantasm, we thought frontline combat may not be the best use of her abilities.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> In contrast, her quick thinking under pressure has saved our lives twice now.</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> I-i-it&#39;s nothing special, really... Ehehe... I just get nervous about different things than most people...</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> That&#39;s exactly the quality our leadership team needs, especially given how unpredictable our situation remains.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Ahem. So, in addition to Van Gogh&#39;s new position, I&#39;ve decided to make several changes to our strategy and lineup for this third area.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> First, I&#39;m going to take our reconnaissance abilities even further.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> I want to find and sink every last enemy in this area, and to do that, I&#39;m going to need help from Osakabehime, Raikou, and you, Lambdaryllis.</p><p><strong>Lambda:</strong><br> True, with my Leviathans and my Authority, it would be trivial for me to send them on completely silent recon missions.</p><p><strong>Lambda:</strong><br> But you do understand that I would have to go out into the Void Sea myself to command them?</p><p><strong>Lambda:</strong><br> I suppose if you REALLY insist, Master, I could at least consider it.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I definitely insist.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I do. We absolutely need your help.</p><hr><p><strong>Lambda:</strong><br> ...Oh, fine. Just make sure you show me the proper gratitude. I expect obsequious thanks.</p><p><strong>Lambda:</strong><br> When you take a service for granted, it begins to degrade over time, you know.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Of course.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Thank you, Lambda.</p><hr><p><strong>Lambda:</strong><br> Very good. As for the data they collect, I trust I can just hand it all off to you, Head Scout?</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Head Scout!? Is that my pet name now or something!? Come on, can&#39;t you at least lend me one of your penguins!? I&#39;m onegai-ing you here!</p><p><strong>Lambda:</strong><br> First, they&#39;re Leviathans. Second, since personal loans weren&#39;t part of my contract, it&#39;ll cost you three times the standard rate. Can you pay that?</p><p><strong>Lambda:</strong><br> Relax. Your throw jump is fairly entertaining to watch, so don&#39;t worry about changing your style to match me.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Is EVERYONE on this ship a heartless oni!?</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> I&#39;m sorry to ask so much of you, Osakabehime. If nothing else, I&#39;ll make sure you have all the resources we can spare.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Okay, okay, I&#39;ll do it already! Besides, this is nothing compared to the day-before-deadline crunch!</p><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> Hehe. With our reconnaissance capabilities expanding, I expect more of us will be working outside the ship, so I would like to take this time to share a useful tip.</p><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> Some of you may have already noticed, but it seems that Craft Essences which employ void-related magecraft confer void-compatibility to their user.</p><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> While I cannot promise they will let you perform strenuous activities in Void Space for long periods of time, especially since this compatibility is not embedded into your clothing, it should still be enough to let you fight or work on the ship outside for short periods.</p><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> So do try to remember to use an appropriate Craft Essence when using a combat shadow for battle in the Void Sea.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> True, we have a lot more combat<br> options available to us now.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> As such, in addition to Van Gogh, I&#39;d also like Yang Guifei to stay on the Nautilus from now on, since sonar is critical to our operations here.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Mash, while our defensive Bounded Fields are a lot stronger now, I&#39;d still like you to remain stationed on the Nautilus as our last line of defense.</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> Aye, aye, Captain! Whatever you say! (Wink)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes sir, Captain! I&#39;ll do my very best!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> (I see. So he&#39;s decided it would be best for me and Yang Guifei to be near Van Gogh and Master in the event of a worst-case scenario!)</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Raikou, you&#39;re the core of our offensive strategy, so that&#39;s where I&#39;d like you to stay. I know it won&#39;t be easy, especially since you&#39;re also on the recon team, so if we can help in any way, let us know.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Oh yes, of course. Then I do have one question.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> What should I do were my hand to slip, causing me to accidently sink a certain indecently dressed penguin?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Wait. What!?</p><hr><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> A joke, of course. Isn&#39;t that right, Van Gogh?</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> Uh... E-ehehe...</p><p><strong>Lambda:</strong><br> Ugh, of all the hellholes to get stuck in. All right, if I have to go out there to run recon, maybe I&#39;ll do that right now. We are almost there, right?</p><p><strong>Nemo Professor:</strong><br> Computer room here. We literally just entered the third region of the ocean.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> All right, team, this is it. Good luck out there!</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Oh, Ma-chan? Would it be okay if I tried a Sonarhime here before heading outside the ship?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Go for it.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> (She&#39;s named it like one of her skills now, huh...)</p><hr><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> Hmm, I don&#39;t hear anything out there myself.<br> Do you just want to make extra sure?</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Well, I do have to go out there with a lifeline and all, so... All right, let&#39;s see what this third area is all about!</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> ...Uh, Ma-chan? Captain?</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> I&#39;ve got really bad news, and incredibly bad news.<br> Do you care which one you get first? No? Okay.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> First off, the waters outside this ship are absolutely teeming with small enemies.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Second, about two hundred meters ahead of us...</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> ...there&#39;s an enemy ship roughly three<br> times the size of the Nautilus!!!</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> Uh-oh! All those small enemies just<br> sent out a ping simultaneously!</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> And now they&#39;re all swarming our way! We&#39;re already under attack!</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Well that&#39;s a hell of a way to roll out the welcome mat! Engine, full reverse! All hands, prepare for battle!</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> Oh! It sounds like the battle is over!</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> I still can&#39;t hear anything from the giant ship you mentioned, though. Are you sure it&#39;s out there, Batty?</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> I&#39;m sure! I&#39;ve been scanning the area every ten seconds, and it&#39;s definitely there! The other scouts&#39; data backs me up, too!</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> You just can&#39;t pick it up &#39;cause it&#39;s not making any sound! If you don&#39;t believe me, why don&#39;t you go outside and see for yourself!</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Oh man, it&#39;s still there. It&#39;s almost like it&#39;s just staring at us... Wait. Hm? Did it just move?</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> Ack! I heard it! It sounds like an underwater thunderstorm! It really does seem absolutely huge! But...it sounds like it&#39;s actually moving away from us?</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> ...Hey, yeah, you&#39;re right. It looks like it&#39;s coming about and heading the other way...</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Does this mean we&#39;re safe?</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> ...Gaaah! I take it back! It just let out a thunderous roar! It&#39;s vaporizing everything in a straight line. It must be using a beam!</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Are you serious!?</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> Yes, but it&#39;s moving away from us...</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> ...Uh-oh! Everyone, hang on to something tight!</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Bwaaaaaah!</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Calm down! It&#39;s just the aftershock from a far-off landmass being destroyed! But if this is just the aftershock...!</p><p><strong>Nemo Professor:</strong><br> Right you are, Captain. That beam was at least as powerful as an A-rank Noble Phantasm. I don&#39;t think we could&#39;ve survived a direct hit from that, even with our new armor.</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> Ooh, my poor eardrums... Still, at least it&#39;s over now. It sounds like the enemy ship is continuing to move away from us.</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> I&#39;m sorry, Lady Yu-Yu... That must&#39;ve been so loud for you-you... Ehehe... Another Van Goghk for you...</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> Anyway...I think that might&#39;ve been a warning...</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> As in, a warning shot? So that was the enemy&#39;s way of telling us not to come any farther...?</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> If you&#39;re right, that would mean the enemy ship is...intelligent...</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Professor, Scáthach-Skadi, we&#39;ll need to discuss later.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> For now, Fujimaru...<br> It looks like the enemy wants us to stop here.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> What do you think? Shall we live out the rest of our lives here getting by on whatever we can fish from the Void Sea?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> No way.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Not an option.</p><hr><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Right on. Then we&#39;ll just have<br> to fight our way out of here!</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Don&#39;t worry. Everyone here is still just as ready to fight as ever. All you have to do is give the order!</p><h2 id="act-three-rallying-cry-from-the-calmest-region-2-6" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#act-three-rallying-cry-from-the-calmest-region-2-6" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Act Three: Rallying Cry from the Calmest Region (2/6)</h2><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> After fighting a few battles here, it&#39;s clear these waters have far more enemies than we&#39;ve seen before.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Yeah, this is on a whole different level. The entire area is just crawl–uh, swimming with enemies, big and small alike!</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> That said, we haven&#39;t seen any sign of that super huge ship since we first ran into it. Maybe it&#39;s, like, the lord of this area or something?</p><p><strong>Nemo Professor:</strong><br> I&#39;d like to make a counterargument to that assertion.</p><p><strong>Nemo Professor:</strong><br> Ms. Goddess and I have dissected and researched dozens of these void enemies, and it&#39;s clear they&#39;re not animals.</p><p><strong>Nemo Professor:</strong><br> If anything, they seem to be more like spring-loaded toys; they are exceedingly simple creatures which only move in response to stimuli.</p><p><strong>Nemo Professor:</strong><br> Big or small, they&#39;re still basically nothing more than slightly advanced marionettes.</p><p><strong>Nemo Professor:</strong><br> So I can&#39;t imagine how beings like that could think, strategize, acquire sociality, or produce some kind of lord that could command them.</p><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> Hold on, Professor. Is it not true that even exceedingly simple parts can comprise complex mechanisms?</p><p><strong>Nemo Professor:</strong><br> Well sure, but if that was the case here, we&#39;d be seeing a void trench ecosystem with a lot more diversity.</p><p><strong>Nemo Professor:</strong><br> By which I mean, some of the enemies we&#39;ve captured would have to react in different ways to different stimuli.</p><p><strong>Nemo Professor:</strong><br> But so far, we&#39;ve only seen creatures who ambush targets, and others who hunt down whatever they detect, which isn&#39;t nearly enough variety.</p><p><strong>Nemo Professor:</strong><br> That said, we are starting to capture pinging enemies too, so I won&#39;t deny it&#39;s possible that they could be mutating, evolving, and innovating...</p><p><strong>Nemo Professor:</strong><br> But at the moment, there&#39;s still nowhere near enough behavioral diversity to suggest a leader unit.</p><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> Hmm... In that case, there is only one possible answer.<br> Care to guess what it is, Fujimaru?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...Somebody&#39;s controlling them?</p><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> Correct. Hehehe.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> ...This is all just a dream?</p><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> ...I could never have imagined you might say...that. You do know there is more to being clever than merely saying something surprising, do you not?</p><hr><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> In essence, if we assume that these enemies are not acting on their own accord, but rather at the direction of another, everything makes sense.</p><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> Indeed, this would perfectly explain why these creatures appear to be puppets: because they ARE puppets.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> But that&#39;s still just speculation, right, Goddess? Truth might often be stranger than fiction, but not always.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> ...At any rate, since that giant ship could still conceivably attack at any time, we&#39;ll need Osakabehime and Yang Guifei to keep an eye and ear out for it at all times.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Guuuys! We&#39;re under attaaack! Yu-Yu just picked up<br> some pings while she was on break, and now we&#39;ve got<br> a bunch of enemies headed our waaay!</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Dammit, speak of the devil!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Guess that means the combat team&#39;s up.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> This looks like another job for the penguins.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Right! I&#39;ll do my best to guide everyone while on standby. Ready to deploy at any time!</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> Of all the times for me to leave the bridge<br> and go on break... I&#39;m so sorry, everyone.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> No, this was my fault. I should have planned better.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> I&#39;m sorry to ask this, but I&#39;m afraid I&#39;ll need you two to stay on the bridge at all times from now on.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> As for long-range enemy scans, I want you to work alongside the Professor to engineer a viable technology for remote operations. I know it won&#39;t be easy for you, Osakabehime, but we need your help with this.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Kyaaa! Forced overtime!? Why me!? There&#39;s no Servant out there who needs breaks (read: is lazier) more than me!</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> Huh, is that really how you feel, Batty?<br> I find it inspiring myself.</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> I mean, dancing and fighting day and night to help people I care about? I couldn&#39;t ask for a better second life!</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Ulp. So this is the determination of a Servant who gets infinite magical energy from the Holy Grail known as love... You&#39;re shining so bright, I can&#39;t even look at you...</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> Hehehe♪</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> Of course, you&#39;re still just my Master, Master, buuut...</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> Seeing how wholeheartedly you believe in the Servants who have been fighting one arduous battle after another for you, well...</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> Now I know for sure that you&#39;re someone who deserves every ounce of love and respect I have to offer!</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Gnnn... So...cute...<br> Can&#39;t...let her...beat me... I&#39;ll work hard too...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You&#39;re both cute in my book.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Sorry to always ask so much of you...</p><hr><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> All that aside, this workload definitely isn&#39;t sustainable, so we&#39;ll need to think of a viable long-term solution.</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> Would it help if...we all drank coffee together...?<br> Ehehe... Probably not, huh...</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Actually, that sounds like a great idea. Those who must round the clock without sleep should get to enjoy something that makes it worth their while.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> So I&#39;m sure Fujimaru will make some delicious coffee for us. Right, Fujimaru?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> If you&#39;d like me to make it, I&#39;ll definitely do my best.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Sure thing! I&#39;ll go learn how to brew a good pot!</p><hr><h2 id="act-three-rallying-cry-from-the-calmest-region-3-6" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#act-three-rallying-cry-from-the-calmest-region-3-6" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Act Three: Rallying Cry from the Calmest Region (3/6)</h2><p><strong>A：Nemo Marine:</strong><br> Hm hm hmm, hm hm hmm♪</p><p><strong>B：Nemo Marine:</strong><br> This is great!</p><p><strong>C：Nemo Marine:</strong><br> We&#39;ve got our work cut out for us, huh!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Oh, hey, marines.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> How&#39;s it going, guys?</p><hr><p><strong>A：Nemo Marine:</strong><br> Hi, Master! Nice to see you out on patrol!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Hm?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> What&#39;s that you&#39;ve got there?</p><hr><p><strong>B：Nemo Marine:</strong><br> Oh, this? Ms. Yang Guifei gave it to–</p><p><strong>C：Nemo Marine:</strong><br> Shhh! Master&#39;s not supposed to know about that yet!</p><p><strong>B：Nemo Marine:</strong><br> Oh, right!

How&#39;s the patrol going?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ???</p><hr><p><strong>Yang Guifei?:</strong><br> Aha, I know what you&#39;re thinking. You&#39;re wondering why I&#39;m out here and not on the bridge, right?</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei?:</strong><br> Well I&#39;m not slacking off, if that&#39;s what you&#39;re thinking. There&#39;s actually two of me right now!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Huh?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> What are you talking about?</p><hr><p><strong>Yang Guifei B:</strong><br> (Suddenly speaking much faster) Well, even though my Divinity skill includes Authority over Divided Spirits, that doesn&#39;t mean I can literally or miraculously manifest a Divine Spirit.</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei B:</strong><br> In fact, usually, my Divinity would expand beyond what I could contain as a single Servant and cause my Spirit Origin to completely melt down if I tried to make another full-fledged copy of myself.</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei B:</strong><br> But then I surprised myself by discovering I can cool my excess Divinity by casting it out into the Void Sea, which lets me use it in ways I&#39;d normally never be able to even try.</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei B:</strong><br> So thanks to that, the Professor teaching me how to use Memory Partition, and some of Lady Goddess&#39;s rune magecraft, I finally managed to clone myself!</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei B:</strong><br> I call it: Yu-Yu&#39;s Void Space-Only Extra-Dimensional<br> Secret Ultra Cloning Technique!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> So, why go to all that trouble?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> So, why did you need to clone yourself in the first place?</p><hr><p><strong>Yang Guifei B:</strong><br> Well, um, to tell the truth, the workshop team was kind enough to help me with a selfish personal request.</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei B:</strong><br> I figured, since I only need my sense of hearing to perform my recon duties, maybe I could let my true self handle that and leave my clone free to pursue other things.</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei B:</strong><br> I mean, the sonar (read: Batty) and me have been holed up on the bridge ever since we got to this area, right?</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei B:</strong><br> That sort of thing can&#39;t be good for your mental health. Plus, having another one of me around would solve a lot of problems when it comes to battle, recon, or even just taking breaks.</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei B:</strong><br> Fortunately, I was able to clone Batty too, so it wasn&#39;t completely selfish. She loved the idea of having another one of her around. She was very excited about being able to expand her scanning range, and sleeping more when one of her wasn&#39;t on radar duty.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> That does sound like her. But what&#39;s this with the Marines.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> So you hid from me to do something secret with the Marines?</p><hr><p><strong>Yang Guifei B:</strong><br> Gack! You already found out about that!?</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei B:</strong><br> Well, I&#39;ve been thinking about what I could do for you and everyone else here to thank you for being so kind to me...</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei B:</strong><br> And I came up with the idea of using extra food resources to, um...make really strong good-luck doll charms...</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei B:</strong><br> Anyway, since the cat&#39;s out of the bag now, I&#39;ll just have to steel myself... Would you like one too, Master?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Thanks!</p><hr><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Uh... A face with three legs?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> It kind of looks like the flag of Sicily...or maybe the Isle of Man?</p><hr><p><strong>Yang Guifei B:</strong><br> I know, it&#39;s creepy, right!? I was so focused on imbuing them with good luck that they somehow ended up looking like, well, that!</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei B:</strong><br> Still, creepy or not, I am proud of how well it came out, and they do say the, uh, devil is in the details, so...</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei B:</strong><br> ...Huh?</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei B:</strong><br> Master, it looks like the me on the bridge just picked up more enemy signals! Is this what is meant by “speak of the devil”!?</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei B:</strong><br> Go on, Master! They&#39;re calling for all the officers!<br> Don&#39;t worry! I can fight too if I have to!</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Phew... I&#39;m glad it was just a regular enemy attack.<br> We have been seeing more of that lately, though...</p><p><strong>Osakabehime A:</strong><br> I&#39;ll say! I can&#39;t even remember how many times they&#39;ve attacked us since we got here!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Really? It doesn&#39;t seem like it&#39;s been that many to me.</p><hr><p><strong>Yang Guifei A:</strong><br> That&#39;s because Batty&#39;s origami and my ladies-in-waiting have been taking care of the low-level threats on their own.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> “Ladies-in-waiting”?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> You mean those flame sprites you have in battle?</p><hr><p><strong>Yang Guifei A:</strong><br> That&#39;s right. They&#39;re the attendants who used to serve at my Xīng Xiùer, my lunar mansion&#39;s inner palace.</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei A:</strong><br> They are flame spirits, but they&#39;re also known as “Fire Vampires.”</p><p><strong>Osakabehime A:</strong><br> They&#39;re surprisingly cute, but they do have a tendency to burn my origami whenever they play together...</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei A:</strong><br> Hehehe, sorry about that, Batty. And I&#39;m sorry to bother you while you were on break, Master.</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei A:</strong><br> Say hi to the other me for me!</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Master.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> It is I, your shadow prefect. I have a short<br> complain–I mean, report I would like to make.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Report, complaint, I&#39;m happy to listen either way.</p><hr><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> How very open-minded of you, Master...<br> But really, this is of no great importance.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> I only wish to say that it was difficult enough keeping an eye on everyone on this ship even before Lady Osakabehime and Lady Yang Guifei cloned themselves...</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Still, as long as I am around, I will not let a clone or two distract me from my duties.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> In the meantime, as I suspected, there continues to be no sign of anything indecen–I mean, suspicious, aboard this ship.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Thanks for keeping an eye on things, Raikou.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Thanks, Raikou. Keep up the good work.</p><hr><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Now I see. So Minamoto-no-Raikou&#39;s been spying on us.<br> I knew something was off.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Aah!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Lambda!?</p><hr><p><strong>Lambda:</strong><br> I wasn&#39;t hiding. I just happened by.</p><p><strong>Lambda:</strong><br> Anyway, I was thinking about that colossal enemy. You know, the one with an A-rank Noble Phantasm. What do you make of it?</p><p><strong>Lambda:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Lambda:</strong><br> What? I said I wasn&#39;t going to fight, and that&#39;s not going to change unless absolutely necessary.</p><p><strong>Lambda:</strong><br> I really doubt it&#39;s as strong as a mythological Demonic Beast, so Raikou and the others should be able to handle it.</p><p><strong>Lambda:</strong><br> Besides, it looks like you understand what the true threat is here.</p><p><strong>Lambda:</strong><br> We shouldn&#39;t be worried about what&#39;s out there; we need to worry about what&#39;s in here. That&#39;s why I&#39;m glad to know you&#39;ve got someone keeping an eye on us.</p><p><strong>Lambda:</strong><br> Now that I know you&#39;ve got that covered, I can focus on helping everyone else.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Thanks, Mysterious Alter Ego.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Is it just me, or do you seem a lot less guarded than everyone else?</p><hr><p><strong>Lambda:</strong><br> ...I&#39;m pretty sure you know this about me, but I couldn&#39;t care less what happens to humanity.</p><p><strong>Lambda:</strong><br> BB might be helping you guys out–or at least CLAIM she&#39;s helping–but that doesn&#39;t obligate the Sakura Five to do the same.</p><p><strong>Lambda:</strong><br> As far as we&#39;re concerned, humanity is none of our business. I sure don&#39;t care about saving the world.</p><p><strong>Lambda:</strong><br> Get it yet? I&#39;ve been helping you out because I feel like it, or because circumstances demanded it.</p><p><strong>Lambda:</strong><br> This is no different. I didn&#39;t ask to be summoned, so now that I&#39;m here, I consider seeing your pathetic face a bare minimum of compensation.</p><p><strong>Lambda:</strong><br> I&#39;ll make this simple. No matter how dangerous the being behind this incident might be, or how much of a threat they might pose to humanity...</p><p><strong>Lambda:</strong><br> ...you&#39;re the one who has to something about them,<br> Fujimaru, not me. Just keep that in mind.</p><p><strong>Lambda:</strong><br> And while I&#39;m giving out advice, don&#39;t be too quick to trust anyone else, either.</p><p><strong>Lambda:</strong><br> Just the fact that BB decided to help you means whatever this is, it&#39;s seriously bad news.</p><p><strong>Nemo Marine:</strong><br> Oh, Master!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> How&#39;s it going, Marine?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> What&#39;s up, Marine?</p><hr><p><strong>Nemo Marine:</strong><br> Ahaha, I&#39;m good, thanks!</p><p><strong>Nemo Marine:</strong><br> Oh, I almost forgot!<br> Thanks so much, Master!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> For what?</p><hr><p><strong>Nemo Marine:</strong><br> I&#39;m the marine that almost got sucked out into Void Space when we collided with that reef at the start of all this.</p><p><strong>Nemo Marine:</strong><br> I&#39;d probably have died out there<br> if you hadn&#39;t rescued me.</p><p><strong>Nemo Marine:</strong><br> Sure, I could always come back if the captain made me again, but it was still super scary at the time.</p><p><strong>Nemo Marine:</strong><br> Anyway, I just wanted to say how much I appreciate you saving me back there. Thanks again, Master!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Oh, you&#39;re THAT marine!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Well in that case, you&#39;re very welcome!</p><hr><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Huh? Isn&#39;t that doll–</p><hr><p><strong>Nemo Marine:</strong><br> Oh yeah, Ms. Yang Guifei gave it to me!<br> She gave you one too, right, Master?</p><p><strong>Nemo Marine:</strong><br> It&#39;s a little creepy, sure, but it&#39;s so well-made I&#39;ve been carrying it around with me everywhere!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I think yours is a little different from mine.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Yours looks a little different from mine.</p><hr><p><strong>Nemo Marine:</strong><br> You noticed, huh? Yeah, I drew those little swirls on the cheeks there myself. I thought it&#39;d be cuter that way.</p><p><strong>Nemo Marine:</strong><br> Besides, it&#39;s more fun having one that&#39;s not exactly like everyone else&#39;s, you know?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I hear that.</p><p><strong>Nemo Marine:</strong><br> Right!? Ehehe, I even gave it a name: Toto!<br> Pretty cute, right?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Actually, I think I like having something just like everyone else&#39;s.</p><p><strong>Nemo Marine:</strong><br> Really? I mean, woodblock prints and lithographs are great and all, but don&#39;t you ever feel like drawing your own stuff?</p><hr><p><strong>Nemo Marine:</strong><br> Anyway, me and my doll here oughta get back to work if we&#39;re gonna keep helping you out, Master!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Thanks, Marine!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I&#39;d better do the same!</p><hr><h2 id="act-three-rallying-cry-from-the-calmest-region-4-6" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#act-three-rallying-cry-from-the-calmest-region-4-6" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Act Three: Rallying Cry from the Calmest Region (4/6)</h2><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Welp, it&#39;s finally happening...</p><hr><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Yeah... We&#39;re still not in combat range of the target, but it&#39;s coming straight at us. It&#39;s not even bothering to stay silent anymore!</p><p><strong>Nemo Professor:</strong><br> Computer room here. I&#39;m putting the analysis of the enemy ship I made based on the recon team&#39;s data up on the monitor now.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> So this is the massive enemy ship...</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Has it sent out any pings yet?</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei A:</strong><br> No... Not yet...</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Well, keep your ears peeled. Once it does, it won&#39;t be long before its unleashes that incredibly powerful beam.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Engine room, back us off slowly. Keep our nose pointed at Enemy Ship Alpha.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> And above all, make sure you do it silently.</p><p><strong>Nemo Engineer:</strong><br> Roger that. I&#39;m gonna keep my transmissions to a minimum for a while too, to play it safe. Engineer out.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> ...Hopefully, it&#39;ll leave without even noticing us.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> If it doesn&#39;t, our only option is to flee while bombarding it with torpedoes.</p><p><strong>Nemo Professor:</strong><br> Incidentally, my calculations say that even with our current, powered-up torpedoes, it would take at least thirteen to sink that thing.</p><p><strong>Nemo Professor:</strong><br> And we can&#39;t ram it with my Nautilus Noble Phantasm, as there&#39;s a nearly one-hundred-percent chance that&#39;d just be suicide. Math is a cruel and unforgiving beast.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> I see. It won&#39;t be easy to fire thirteen torpedoes<br> in quick succession, but I&#39;ll do it if I must.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Okay. In the meantime, we&#39;ll keep putting distance between us and the enemy ship to avoid a worst-case scenario. Anything to add, Acting Commander?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> (Silently shake head)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> (Give an enthusiastic thumbs up)</p><hr><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> All right then... Good luck out there, everyone!</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei A:</strong><br> ...I can&#39;t hear anything anymore. I think we&#39;re okay.</p><p><strong>Nemo Professor:</strong><br> I think so too. It might&#39;ve taken us an hour, but we&#39;ve just about retreated to the edge of this area.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> ...Yeah, it looks like we&#39;re in the clear.<br> Though I almost get the feeling it let us get away...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Way to go, everyone!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Oh man, that was tense!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Congratulations, Acting Commander and Captain!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Still, I do have to wonder if we&#39;re going to have to fight that enormous enemy ship at some point to go on to the next area...</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Yeah, we probably will. Given its size, its strength, its sharp eyes, and its sheer speed, it&#39;s definitely going to be the toughest challenge we&#39;ve faced so far.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> So it&#39;s crucial we come up with a strategy and make sure we&#39;re ready. We can&#39;t afford to jump the gun on this one.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Now, what could we do...? Maybe we could take it out with one hugely souped-up torpedo? Or perhaps read its behavioral patterns and plan a surprise attack? Or–</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> Um, Nemo–I mean, Captain and Master?<br> Ehehe, I&#39;m sorry, but could I say something?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> What is it, Goghie?</p><hr><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> Well–</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei A:</strong><br> Uh-oh! Sorry, but I just picked up several pings behind us! A group of small enemies is headed our way!</p><p><strong>Osakabehime A:</strong><br> I see them too! Although... Huh!?<br> That&#39;s no small group, it&#39;s a dekabig one!</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> I-I&#39;m sorry, ehehe. I&#39;ll come back later...</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Yes, do that. Right now, we&#39;re going from the frying pan straight to the fire! We need to take care of these new enemies! Hang in there, Raikou! I&#39;ll send reinforcements as soon as possible!</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Understood!</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Lambdaryllis, I&#39;m sorry to do this,<br> but we need to borrow your familiars again!</p><p><strong>Lambda:</strong><br> By all means. Just know that if you&#39;re going to use my Leviathans, I won&#39;t tolerate failure.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Duly noted!</p><hr><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Great job, everyone.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Make sure you all have Nurse take a look at you, okay?</p><hr><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> I&#39;m glad everyone made it back safe and sound again.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Still, I hope that&#39;s not going to be a typical enemy from now on. Especially since they&#39;re still too small for our torpedoes...</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> Um, Captain? Master?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Oh, hey, Goghie.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Did you have an idea you wanted to tell us?</p><hr><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> Ehehe, it&#39;s no big deal, really, but...</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> What if, for that giant enemy, heh,<br> we tried close-range combat again?</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> ...Are you actually saying we should attack that colossal enemy ship directly?</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> Yes. Oh, but not just that. The idea is to chip away at it up close, then finish it off with a torpedo...</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> Since that ship is so big...ehehe, maybe it can&#39;t defend against attacks...from point-blank range?</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> Plus, now that Lady Lambdaryllis is here...<br> we should be able to approach it very quietly...</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> If we attack it with a big enough weapon, ehehe...<br> we might be able to damage it surprisingly easily...</p><p><strong>Osakabehime B:</strong><br> Hey, yeah. If we can get in close and destroy its weaponry, or somehow strip off its armor, I think this could work!</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> Oh! L-Lady Osakabehime... Y-yes, that&#39;s right.</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> With a big enough weapon, it should be fairly easy to go toe to toe–Or maybe fin to fin?–with that big ship... Ehehe.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime B:</strong><br> Whoooa... You&#39;re subaramazing, Professor Van Gogh! I had no idea you were such a smart strategist on top of being a genius painter!</p><p><strong>Osakabehime B:</strong><br> I&#39;ve, uh, been too anxious to talk to you up till now, but as a bit of a dabbler in art myself, I super respect you.</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> Ehehe, ehehe, you&#39;re too kind... I, um, really<br> appreciate you saving me too, so...</p><p><strong>Nemo Professor:</strong><br> Yes, hi, computer room here.<br> Sorry to butt in, but I overheard the whole thing.</p><p><strong>Nemo Professor:</strong><br> It&#39;s a fascinating idea for a battle tactic, but there&#39;s still one thing we&#39;d need before we could actually do it:</p><p><strong>Nemo Professor:</strong><br> A super aggressive Servant with one hell of a close-range Noble Phantasm, and the ability to use it in hand-to-hand combat.</p><p><strong>Nemo Professor:</strong><br> If we can get someone like that from the next summoning, then... Hmm, yeah, I think this plan&#39;d be well worth considering.</p><p><strong>Nemo Professor:</strong><br> So between that, and all the repairs and improvements we&#39;re still making to the ship, I think we could stand to collect some more resources.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Then what are we waiting for!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Then let&#39;s get to work!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Right, Acting Commander! Let&#39;s go back to the bridge and figure out a plan for acquiring more resources!</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> Me...a strategist...?</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> Ehehe... Ehehe... Ehehe... No...<br> You&#39;re wrong... It&#39;s not like that at all...</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> I&#39;m just pretty good at entrapping people...</p><h2 id="act-three-rallying-cry-from-the-calmest-region-5-6" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#act-three-rallying-cry-from-the-calmest-region-5-6" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Act Three: Rallying Cry from the Calmest Region (5/6)</h2><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> We&#39;ve finally got enough resources for another summon!</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> All right, this next Servant needs to be–</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Someone with a huge close-range Noble Phantasm!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Someone who excels at close-range combat!</p><hr><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> ...Which probably means they&#39;re<br> going to be a Berserker, huh...</p><p><strong>C：Yang Guifei A:</strong><br> Do you not care for Berserkers, Captain?<br> I think they&#39;re pretty cute, myself.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> You think? Between their brute strength and their inability to communicate, I think it&#39;s sensible to be on guard around them.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> We&#39;ll be fine no matter who shows up.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Don&#39;t worry, it&#39;ll be okay.

This one&#39;s not too mad as far as Berserkers go!</p><p><strong>Nemo Professor:</strong><br> Hmm, I see. Still, a mace, huh... It&#39;s going to take a lot of work to turn that into a weapon capable of destroying that ship&#39;s armor...</p><p><strong>Fran:</strong><br> Uh...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Here&#39;s the story, Fran...</p><p><strong>Fran:</strong><br> Uh... Ah...</p><p><strong>Fran:</strong><br> Can I...be hot...?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Oh! That&#39;s right! Once again, you summoned just the Servant we need, Senpai! Scáthach-Skadi? Are you there!?</p><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> Of course. Here, Frankenstein. Wear this swimsuit, and be as hot as you like!</p><p><strong>Fran:</strong><br> Uhh. I&#39;m not hot, but I&#39;ll bring the heat.</p><p><strong>Fran:</strong><br> My Bridal Blade can skewer that whale.</p><p><strong>Nemo Professor:</strong><br> Wh-whoa, that&#39;s a big honkin&#39; blade! It does look like it would be perfect for piercing the ship&#39;s armor and damaging its interior!</p><p><strong>Nemo Professor:</strong><br> Although... No matter how you slice it, that weapon can&#39;t have been designed with any thought to portability, right?</p><p><strong>Nemo Professor:</strong><br> Hehe, hehehe... The scientist who made her must have been some kind of idiot savant. I&#39;d love to meet them sometime.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> In some ways, they were definitely one of humanity&#39;s finest minds.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> (Well, now I know who I&#39;m never leaving alone in a room together.)</p><hr><p><strong>Fran:</strong><br> Uhh, uh?

I&#39;m Yang Guifei!<br> But you can call me Yu-Yu if you like.</p><p><strong>C：Yang Guifei B:</strong><br> Oh wow, Fran, you&#39;re a lot taller when you stand up straight, aren&#39;t you?</p><p><strong>Fran:</strong><br> Ooh, you&#39;re tiny. And Chinese. Tiny Chinese.<br> So cute. Nice to meet you.</p><p><strong>C：Yang Guifei B:</strong><br> Aww, you&#39;re the cute one here, Fran!<br> Nice to meet you, too!</p><p><strong>Fran:</strong><br> Mm.

Ehehe, I think I could make a great painting of you. You remind me of a sunflower...</p><p><strong>Fran:</strong><br> &#39;Kay. Let&#39;s go.</p><p><strong>H：Osakabehime B:</strong><br> Um... Do you think there&#39;s something about Professor Van Gogh&#39;s identity that needs to be hidden?</p><p><strong>C：Yang Guifei B:</strong><br> Okay, Batty, I think that&#39;s our cue to get out of here and head to the cafeteria!</p><p><strong>C：Yang Guifei B:</strong><br> Sifu Skadi said she managed to recreate lychee-flavored ice-cream bars, so let&#39;s go see how they came out!</p><p><strong>H：Osakabehime B:</strong><br> Gyaaa, I just said something I shouldn&#39;t have,<br> didn&#39;t I!?

I can&#39;t imagine any more horrible torture than hearing your own clone say something stupid while literally standing right next to you...</p><p><strong>H：Osakabehime A:</strong><br> All right, this may not make up for it, but: incoming!<br> I&#39;m picking up enemy hostiles headed our way on my<br> radar! And it looks like more of those midsize guys!</p><p><strong>C：Yang Guifei A:</strong><br> Oh, right! I was so caught up in the conversation that I didn&#39;t notice! They&#39;re coming in from two-one-three, and they&#39;re pinging the heck out of us, too!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Huh? Hang on. Wouldn&#39;t Fran be perfect for this?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I think this might already be a job for Fran.</p><hr><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> (Huff, huff) Here! I brought Fran with me!</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> After she lied down, she wouldn&#39;t move a millimeter, so I had to put her on a trolley... Ehehe, because I&#39;m a Gogh-getter, right?</p><p><strong>Fran:</strong><br> So tired. Too much effort. Someone crank the AC.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I-I&#39;m sorry to interrupt your heartwarming new comedy routine, but we really need your help right now!</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Fran:</strong><br> Uhh, we won! We beat the event!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> No, no, there&#39;s still plenty left to go.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> That was great, Fran. Glad to have you on board.</p><hr><p><strong>Fran:</strong><br> Uhh... Sleepy. Used too much...electricity...</p><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> Very well then, why not come to my workshop and take a nice long nap? I have a good deal of work to do on your Noble Phantasm, anyway.</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> Can I come, too? Ehehe,<br> I didn&#39;t finish my sketch yet, so...</p><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> Yes, of course. I am always happy to be surrounded by my beloved children.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> ...I don&#39;t think we can tiptoe around it much longer. When do you think we should bring it up, Master?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I don&#39;t know... I still want to give her a chance.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I&#39;m still hoping she&#39;ll figure it out herself...</p><hr><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Well sure, of course, but...</p><p><strong>Osakabehime A:</strong><br> ...Hey, Yu-Yu? Since they&#39;re so obviously talking about something that&#39;s meant to be secret, would it be terrible if we were to interrupt and join them?</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei A:</strong><br> You sure live up to your name, don&#39;t you, Batty?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I think it would be best if we left this matter up to them. Besides, as the two people in charge of this ship, they seem the best equipped to do so.</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei A:</strong><br> I couldn&#39;t have said it better, Acting Vice Commander! The best way we can help now is by doing our jobs.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime A:</strong><br> Then you might want to quit yapping and get your head back in the game, Yu-Yu.

Everyone ready?</p><p><strong>Lambda:</strong><br> First off, my Leviathans will, like silent and graceful swans, bring the assault team right alongside the enemy ship.</p><p><strong>Lambda:</strong><br> It&#39;ll be a significantly more difficult performance than usual, so I&#39;ll be there to lead them.</p><p><strong>Fran:</strong><br> Uh. Next, I cut the armor!</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> And from there, I&#39;ll use my Noble Phantasm to run the beast through in a single blow.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> As for me, I&#39;ll stay back with Raikou to defend both her and the ship!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...All that aside, we certainly don&#39;t look like a group of warriors headed off to battle, do we?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> It does kind of feel weirdly like summer here.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> We might be a colorful crowd, but we&#39;re still fighting for our lives.</p><hr><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> This is definitely one of the most ragtag crews I&#39;ve ever come across, that&#39;s for sure.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Still, the fact that they&#39;re taking this unprecedented threat so lightly does seem like something Heroic Spirits would do.</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> Ehehe... It looks like it&#39;s time!</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> So it does. Okay, no more pointless chatter!</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> All hands, we&#39;ve arrived at the designated position near Enemy Ship Alpha! Begin the operation!</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Fran:</strong><br> Yaaah! I&#39;m gonna chop it in haaalf!</p><p><strong>Lambda:</strong><br> This girl really has a knack for breaking the tension, doesn&#39;t she...? It&#39;s too big to chop in half, but that&#39;s okay; you&#39;ve done plenty to help. Now get on! Quick!</p><p><strong>Fran:</strong><br> Oh. Okay. You take good care of people.</p><p><strong>Lambda:</strong><br> Well of course I do. Any halfway decent collector knows how important looking after her dolls is.</p><p><strong>Lambda:</strong><br> ...Though I suppose I&#39;m not one to talk, since I&#39;ve also been...less than kind to some of my playthings.</p><p><strong>Fran:</strong><br> Why are you treating me like a doll?</p><p><strong>Lambda:</strong><br> Because you are one.<br> Aren&#39;t you, Frankenstein&#39;s monster?</p><p><strong>Lambda:</strong><br> You&#39;re a poor little bride doll created to be the vessel of the first human, Adam, but you never did get the partner you were promised.</p><p><strong>Lambda:</strong><br> I think that&#39;s a lovely concept, personally. If you like, I wouldn&#39;t mind helping your wish come true.</p><p><strong>Fran:</strong><br> No. I&#39;m tired. Just wanna sleep somewhere cool.</p><p><strong>Lambda:</strong><br> You just want to sleep? Really? Summer outfit or not, didn&#39;t you become a Heroic Spirit because you have something you refuse to compromise on?</p><p><strong>Fran:</strong><br> Uhh. My wish already came true.</p><p><strong>Lambda:</strong><br> ?</p><p><strong>Fran:</strong><br> The professor told me I should never have been born.</p><p><strong>Fran:</strong><br> I told him he&#39;s the one who chose my purpose for existing.</p><p><strong>Fran:</strong><br> So I said he should find a way for me to fulfill it. But he didn&#39;t.</p><p><strong>Fran:</strong><br> So I looked for one myself. My body fell apart, but my pursuit was still inscribed in the Throne.</p><p><strong>Fran:</strong><br> But now, I know I have purpose just by existing, even if I am a patchwork monster.</p><p><strong>Fran:</strong><br> I learned that at Chaldea. Now I have Papa, Babbage, Master, Mordred... That makes me happy.</p><p><strong>Fran:</strong><br> So my wish came true. I&#39;m different now. And my new lazy self was reinscribed on the Throne.</p><p><strong>Lambda:</strong><br> ...I see. Then I suppose congratulations are in order. I guess it wouldn&#39;t be fair to try and push my particular taste for tragedy onto you.</p><p><strong>Lambda:</strong><br> Besides, this isn&#39;t the Far Side of the Moon, where there&#39;s no hope of salvation. If you have another option aside from breaking down, then more power to you.</p><p><strong>Fran:</strong><br> So, you don&#39;t like lazy me?</p><p><strong>Lambda:</strong><br> You&#39;re just not my style.</p><p><strong>Fran:</strong><br> Can we be friends?</p><p><strong>Lambda:</strong><br> I don&#39;t know. But I suppose envy and sloth working together wouldn&#39;t be the weirdest thing we&#39;ve seen.</p><p><strong>Fran:</strong><br> I heard you can make water.<br> Will you make me a bath later?</p><p><strong>Lambda:</strong><br> As long as you&#39;re okay with Nemo chewing you out afterwards. I also did want to try making a pool on the ship&#39;s deck.</p><p><strong>Fran:</strong><br> Okay.<br> Can I call you “Mama”?</p><p><strong>Lambda:</strong><br> Absolutely not.</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Yang Guifei A:</strong><br> We did it!

Okay, everyone, brace for impac–</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> What the...!? What was that, Professor!?</p><p><strong>Nemo Professor:</strong><br> Computer room here. Hmm, that sounded like engine noise... My hypothesis is it was Alpha crying in pain, or just the sound of it coming apart.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> I see. Well, as long as it wasn&#39;t pinging for us–</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Huh!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Blood...?</p><hr><p><strong>Yang Guifei A:</strong><br> Ghh...</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei A:</strong><br> Ahaha.

Professor, what&#39;s going on!?</p><p><strong>Nemo Professor:</strong><br> As far as I can tell, that sound actually wounded Yang Guifei because of her delicate hearing.</p><p><strong>Nemo Professor:</strong><br> But that&#39;s not the only problem.</p><p><strong>Nemo Professor:</strong><br> When she gave most of her Spirit Origin to her clone so she could help out in ways other than being our sonar...</p><p><strong>Nemo Professor:</strong><br> ...it left her original self so weakened that a fatal injury like this will probably result in both her and her clone disappearing.</p><p><strong>Nemo Nurse:</strong><br> I&#39;m here! Don&#39;t move the patient!<br> I need to treat her right away!</p><p><strong>Nemo Nurse:</strong><br> ...What the...? You tweaked your Spirit Origin to boost your audio sensitivity with no thought to the risks?</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei A:</strong><br> Ehe... I&#39;m sorry, Nurse... (Cough!)<br> I just wanted to be...as helpful as possible...</p><p><strong>Nemo Nurse:</strong><br> Master, we need a Command Spell!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> By my Command Spell!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Restore your Spirit Origin!</p><hr><p><strong>Nemo Nurse:</strong><br> ...It&#39;s not enough!

I actually do know how to use it and what it does. I just didn&#39;t say anything because it&#39;s dangerous.</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> It proves that I&#39;m your enemy...<br> The enemy of the whole world.</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> But...ehehe, I don&#39;t want you to go away, Lady Yang Guifei. So I&#39;m going to use it.</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> ...I need to paint.</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei A:</strong><br> Goghie...</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> I need to paint... The starry sky and cypress trees that surpass life and death.</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> Far beyond faith, romance, and trompe-l&#39;œil. From eternity, through the whirlpool of the stars... With a handshake to you.</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> My study of cypresses and a village!<br> You know it as De Sterrennacht!</p><p><strong>Osakabehime A:</strong><br> Wh-what&#39;s going on!? Is that painting really oozing out into the air from the canvas!?</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> A Reality Marble!!!</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> It&#39;s a painting of the endless eternity I saw in the night sky during a particularly intense hallucinatory episode...</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> I used to think it was one of my worst paintings...but now that I&#39;m dead, I can see it has its good qualities, too.</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> At least, if you don&#39;t count the horrific gospel of the Outer God glaring at this world through it!</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> Any Foreigner who opens their eyes now will be turned into a god, and anyone else will be driven mad by the stars! So close your eyes!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Ghh...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Aaaaaah!?</p><hr><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> ...Lady Yang Guifei? Lady Yang Guifei?</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Nn...</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> Ehehe, oh good. So you&#39;re awake now?</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> What...happened...?</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Her Spirit Origin changed!?</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> It&#39;s a side effect of her deification restoring her damaged Spirit Origin.</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> I&#39;m glad it stopped here. If it had gone on much further, she wouldn&#39;t be a Servant any longer...</p><p><strong>E：Osakabehime:</strong><br> Y-Yu-Yu!? Are you okay!?<br> You look...really glammed up!</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> My apologies for the disturbance, friends. As you can see, I have narrowly escaped the jaws of death and am once again alive and well.</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> To think I would reach my ultimate form in this manner... I will make the most of this second chance at life to serve all of you, and my beloved Emperor, as best I can.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime A:</strong><br> Y-Yu-Yu?</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> ...Ah, forgive me. It seems the Ascension of my Spirit Origin has altered my personality somewhat.</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> A moment, please...</p><p><strong>A：Yang Guifei:</strong><br> ...There, I adjusted my Spirit Origin! Sorry, guys!<br> The Yu-Yu you know and love is back now!</p><p><strong>Osakabehime A:</strong><br> Whoooa! It really is you, Yu-Yu! This is great!</p><p><strong>Osakabehime A:</strong><br> ...Huh? What&#39;s the matter with you guys?</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> I knew it. It&#39;s too dangerous.</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> Things might have gone okay so far, but a single mistake will change every Foreigner into an enemy of humanity...</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> Ehehe... My Noble Phantasm is itself a threat to humanity. I&#39;m a pathetic excuse for a Heroic Spirit. I don&#39;t have any right to serve you, Master...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You&#39;re wrong.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> That&#39;s not true.</p><hr><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> A-are you okay, Master?

That tells me without a doubt that you&#39;re on humanity&#39;s side.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> You&#39;re hardly the first Foreigner we&#39;ve met who has the power to open a dangerous gate to another world.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> I&#39;m told that&#39;s the case for Abigail Williams, too.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> So as long as Fujimaru is okay with it,<br> I&#39;d like you to remain on the Nautilus, Van Gogh.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Of course I am.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I feel the same way.</p><hr><p><strong>A：Yang Guifei:</strong><br> Same here! Though I guess that&#39;s no surprise,<br> since you just saved my life and all!</p><p><strong>A：Yang Guifei:</strong><br> Besides, we might both have weird Spirit Origins, but that just means we can do things nobody else can.</p><p><strong>A：Yang Guifei:</strong><br> So I want you to stick around too, Van Gogh! And once we&#39;re done with this operation, let&#39;s go to Chaldea together!</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> ...(Sniff)... Ehehe, ehehe...</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> Master... Lady Yang Guifei... Nemo...<br> You&#39;re all so kind...</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> Okay, I&#39;ll do everything I can to help!<br> I promise!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Juuust kidding.</p><h2 id="idle-talk-2" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#idle-talk-2" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Idle Talk 2</h2><p><strong>A：Sion:</strong><br> A dream with a strong probability<br> of coming true, huh...?</p><p><strong>A：Sion:</strong><br> I have seen plenty of evidence in Chaldea&#39;s archives of other dream-related incidents. Even so, this is not a headache I expected.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> I&#39;ll say. Hmm, if that really is what&#39;s happening...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> ...maybe there&#39;s something we can do in this dream to improve everyone&#39;s chances of surviving if or when it comes true?</p><p><strong>B：Sion:</strong><br> I suppose we could see if there are any other anomalies in Novum Chaldea right now.</p><p><strong>B：Sion:</strong><br> ...Hmm. Well, it is already nighttime, which is when I am usually on duty, so there is nothing unusual there...</p><p><strong>B：Sion:</strong><br> Goredolf and the rest of the staff are on break... The Spirit Origin graphs are all in perfect working order...</p><p><strong>B：Sion:</strong><br> That just leaves the Servants on standby,<br> and they all seem to be asleep, too.</p><p><strong>B：Sion:</strong><br> Oh, that reminds me.</p><p><strong>B：Sion:</strong><br> If the Nautilus&#39;s crew were to run into trouble, they would try to summon someone to help them, right?</p><p><strong>B：Sion:</strong><br> Maybe that would let us determine what is going on with them right now?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Only problem is, there&#39;s no way to be sure. It&#39;s possible that one of the sleeping Servants has already been summoned while dreaming and is with<br> Fujimaru as we speak.</p><p><strong>B：Sion:</strong><br> Then we will just have to wake them all up and ask them if they–</p><p><strong>B：Sion:</strong><br> No, you are right, that would not work. Any that had been summoned would forget everything upon waking. Not to mention we would be depriving Captain and his crew of valuable help.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Yeah. So unfortunately, I really don&#39;t think there&#39;s anything we can do right now.</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong><br> Good evening, you two.<br> It certainly is a fine night, isn&#39;t it?</p><p><strong>A：Sion:</strong><br> Ah.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Hey there, Gilles de Rais.<br> How exactly is this a fine night for you?</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong><br> Ahh, an excellent question. I just took a peek at the astronomical telescope within my mind...</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong><br> ...and I happened to see two fixed stars, both shining with an ever so dim hue of green, not far from Mars.</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong><br> It is rare to see such a thing in the starry stretches of my mind, and all but impossible to predict. Thus, I am finding this night much to my liking.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Hmm, so it&#39;s just about your astrological reading of the sky in your own imagination, huh?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> I can&#39;t say I find that relatable. Definitely something strange going on here though.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Basically...</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong></p><h1 id="c-est-incroyable" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#c-est-incroyable" aria-hidden="true">#</a> C&#39;est incroyable!!!</h1><p><strong>Gilles:</strong><br> Oh, I do beg your pardon.

Or is it both?</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong><br> Indeed! I can scarcely believe my poor luck that I should miss such an amazing opportunity!</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong><br> I will have to board the Nautilus when the time comes for this dream to become reality!</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong><br> Of course, I&#39;ll need to bring both the dark and light Jeannes with me!

At any rate, given our current situation, it would seem we are experiencing an invasion from another world even as we speak.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Like those fantastical stories, or fictional tales, or whatever you want to call them, that you and Foreigners like Abby are supposedly based on?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> We&#39;ve never been able to verify those stories with magecraft, so they&#39;re kind of hard to believe when you can&#39;t even observe them causing any harm.</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong><br> Right you are. The outer universe is a place of fiction that transcends the bounds of reason, which makes it extremely difficult to predict or defend against.</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong><br> While it is not truly my place to speak on such matters, as I am but the mouthpiece of a borrowed Noble Phantasm...</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong><br> ...I can share what little I know if you care to hear it, my fair leaders.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Hmm, I don&#39;t know. If this really is a dream, I&#39;d rather not give it too much theoretical credence...</p><p><strong>A：Sion:</strong><br> No, I think we should hear what he has to say!<br> That may even be the whole point of this scene!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> H-huh, I hadn&#39;t thought about it like that. Okay Gilles, lay it on us. Just be careful not to overstep your bounds.</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong><br> Not to worry!

There&#39;s so many!</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Khh... Be careful, Master! I&#39;m going to carve a path straight to the bridge!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Don&#39;t bother with the bridge.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> The blood leads to the cargo hold.</p><hr><p><strong>Fran:</strong><br> Then we go the other way!</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Understood! Then I shall make sure we get there, even if I must drench the path in the enemy&#39;s blood!</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>B：???:</strong><br> More...</p><p><strong>B：???:</strong><br> I need more pain... More wounds... More punishment...</p><p><strong>B：???:</strong><br> But I can&#39;t inflict any more on myself...</p><p><strong>B：???:</strong><br> So I&#39;ll have to have someone do it for me...</p><p><strong>B：???:</strong><br> ...Ehehe, ehehe... I love pain...</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Van Gogh!?</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> What happened!? Aah! You&#39;re bleeding!</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> Please... Punish me, Nemo... Ehehe...</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> I don&#39;t know why, but...I can&#39;t die... Ehehe, isn&#39;t that strange? Ehehe, I&#39;m Van Gogh, but I can&#39;t die!</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Wh-what the...!? Did your blood just create monsters!?</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> Ehehe, ehehe... I don&#39;t understand anything anymore...<br> Who am I? Am I not Van Gogh...?</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> If I&#39;m not Van Gogh, then you don&#39;t need me...<br> Especially when I just make monsters...</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> So please...kill me, Nemo... Ehehe... You&#39;re the captain... You&#39;ll be doing everyone else...a favor... Ehehe...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> STOP!</p><hr><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Fujimaru!?<br> What&#39;re you doing here!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I&#39;ll tell you later!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Right now, we need to subdue Van Gogh for her own protection!</p><hr><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> ...Got it!</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> Ehehe... It hurts...<br> I love...it...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Captain, get Nurse in here.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> We need to get those wounds closed.</p><hr><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> The infirmary&#39;s not far from here.<br> I&#39;ll go get her, Master!</p><p><strong>Nemo Nurse:</strong><br> I heard what happened. I&#39;ll start treatment right away!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Keep them safe, Nemo.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I&#39;ll head up to the bridge!</p><hr><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Got it. It pains me to say this, but you&#39;re probably better equipped to handle this than I am.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> I&#39;m counting on you, Fujimaru!</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Almost...there...</p><p><strong>Fran:</strong><br> There&#39;s the bridge.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Now! Run for it!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Mash!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Is everyone all right!?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Master!<br> Yes, we&#39;re okay!</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Yu-Yu and me are fine!<br> I&#39;m super used to hiding out in a siege!</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> The marines were a little banged up, but it looks like they&#39;ve all recovered now!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> What about the other sections!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> And the other sections? Are they all right, too!?</p><hr><p><strong>Nemo Engineer:</strong><br> Engine room here! We got a few nasties pinning us down in here! Be real helpful if you could send us some help!</p><p><strong>Nemo Professor:</strong><br> This is the computer room.<br> Need some help down here too!</p><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> This is the workshop. Baker and I are both pinned down! Send help as soon as–Hm? What&#39;s going on? Oh, it&#39;s you–</p><p><strong>Lambda:</strong><br> Lambda here. I took care of the monsters in the aft compartment. They were blocking the way to the shower.</p><p><strong>Lambda:</strong><br> I&#39;ll pass by the engine and computer rooms next, but you might want to consider giving the whole ship an inspection to be safe.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> This is the cargo hold! I agree with Lambdaryllis!</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Fujimaru, we need to go over every millimeter of this ship! We can&#39;t let a single monster survive!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Got it!</p><hr><p><strong>Nemo Professor:</strong><br> Okay, I&#39;m back safe and sound.<br> That sure was an ordeal, wasn&#39;t it?</p><p><strong>Fran:</strong><br> Yeah. I want to take a bath and go to bed.</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> I do too, but this isn&#39;t over yet. We still have no idea how this happened.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> These monsters appeared out of nowhere. We&#39;ve been anchored in place the whole time too.</p><p><strong>Nemo Professor:</strong><br> Yes, about that. As I&#39;m sure you can imagine, the Nemo Series knows everything Captain has seen and heard.</p><p><strong>Nemo Marine:</strong><br> Van Gogh was...covered in blood...</p><p><strong>Nemo Marine:</strong><br> And then she started making monsters out of that blood!</p><p><strong>Nemo Professor:</strong><br> Okay, quiet, please. I&#39;ve done a preliminary investigation. Those monsters did come from Van Gogh&#39;s blood, but it wouldn&#39;t quite be accurate to say she made them.</p><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> Indeed. Her blood merely served as a catalyst to summon those monsters. Once the blood is cleaned up, it will no longer be a problem.</p><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> It may well be that some manner of spell activated inside her body on its own, whether she intended it or not.</p><p><strong>Nemo Professor:</strong><br> I have my doubts. It&#39;s clear her wounds were self-inflicted. Probably a consequence of her mental instability.</p><p><strong>Nemo Professor:</strong><br> My focus in the Nemo Series is logic and reason, and that&#39;s telling me we can&#39;t rule out the possibility that this whole mess was part of an elaborate suicide attempt.</p><p><strong>Nemo Marine:</strong><br> Yeah... If nothing else, we know for sure that those monsters showed up &#39;cause Van Gogh went nuts!</p><p><strong>Nemo Marine:</strong><br> I knew she was too dangerous to keep around! You&#39;re still gonna keep your contract with her, Master!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I...</p><hr><p><strong>Nemo Professor:</strong><br> Hmm. Let&#39;s just take it easy here, Marines.</p><p><strong>Nemo Professor:</strong><br> I know your straightforward nature is a big part of your appeal, but to be perfectly honest, I&#39;ve never cared for the way you guys so blatantly exclude anyone who&#39;s not in your group.</p><p><strong>Nemo Marine:</strong><br> Hey, you get to work all cozy in the computer room! You can&#39;t imagine what it&#39;s like for us, being right next to the void all the time!</p><p><strong>Nemo Baker:</strong><br> This is the kitchen. I&#39;m sorry to say this, Professor, but I think I agree with the marines.</p><p><strong>Nemo Baker:</strong><br> I wish you would try to understand what it&#39;s like being on the support side, where you can never solve any of the really big problems yourself.</p><p><strong>Nemo Baker:</strong><br> Nurse, you must know what it&#39;s like to want to get rid of anything that doesn&#39;t belong here for the safety of the crew, right?</p><p><strong>Nemo Nurse:</strong><br> This is Nemo Nurse in the cargo hold. I&#39;m too busy treating the patient to answer right now.</p><p><strong>Nemo Engineer:</strong><br> Engine room here! Knock it the hell off, bridge! Just &#39;cause Captain&#39;s exhausted right now doesn&#39;t give you all the right to freak out!</p><p><strong>Nemo Engineer:</strong><br> Our job&#39;s to beat the bad guys and protect the weak! That&#39;s all there is to it!</p><p><strong>Nemo Engineer:</strong><br> So, uh, if Van Gogh&#39;s a bad guy, then we&#39;ll beat her, but we&#39;ve still gotta keep her safe, so... Gaah, I don&#39;t know anymore! I need some ice cream to cool down!</p><p><strong>Nemo Professor:</strong><br> Yikes. Sorry about this, everyone.<br> This is Memory Partition&#39;s biggest weakness.</p><p><strong>Nemo Professor:</strong><br> When things get confusing like this, we end up with all sorts of conflicting ideas, and discussion just kind of deadlocks.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> This is awful...<br> What should we do, Senpai?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> First things first.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> We need to solve the mystery of how this happened.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Huh?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Take a look at this.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That&#39;s the drawing Xiang Yu left on the wall right before this all happened...</p><p><strong>Nemo Professor:</strong><br> Oh yeah, I forgot all about that. I tried to figure out what it meant a while ago, but I couldn&#39;t crack it!</p><p><strong>Nemo Professor:</strong><br> Wait. Did you figure it out, Master?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Yeah, I know what this is.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> This is a stone piece from the board game, Go.</p><hr><p><strong>Nemo Professor:</strong><br> Huh...?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Remember where Batty sensed the enemy&#39;s presence?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> There&#39;s a shadow on the grid square where Batty detected the enemy.</p><hr><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> O-okay, but there weren&#39;t actually any enemies there...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> The enemy&#39;s not in the square.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> The enemy&#39;s where the squares intersect.</p><hr><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> ...Huh? Wait. Is that what the Go piece means?</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> Hey, yeah. Unlike in chess, Go pieces are placed on the intersecting lines between the squares, not the squares themselves...</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> But wait. Does that mean the enemy&#39;s in between the squares? How does that make sense?</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> It doesn&#39;t! Besides, Yu-Yu and I haven&#39;t been missing anything in between the areas, Ma-chan!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> That&#39;s not what I&#39;m saying.</p><hr><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> What if this game board-like monitor...</p><hr><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...observed some kind of gap between the spaces of existence?</p><hr><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> I...think I understand?</p><p><strong>Nemo Professor:</strong><br> Hey, yeah... That&#39;s something we may have been overlooking entirely.</p><p><strong>Nemo Professor:</strong><br> If we assume that zero-width spaces are lined up at equal distances from each other exactly where the lines that make up this grid intersect, then...</p><p><strong>Nemo Professor:</strong><br> ...Yeah. Yeah, that would definitely explain the strange display glitch we&#39;re seeing on the monitor.</p><p><strong>Nemo Professor:</strong><br> So the very machine we used to observe this anomalous world has been bugging out...</p><p><strong>Nemo Professor:</strong><br> No, wait. If these impossible spaces really do exist, maybe it&#39;s because observing this world through the monitor actually caused the world to go a little nuts?</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> Hey, yeah! If we can&#39;t prove whether the people observing the world have gone mad, or if the world itself has gone mad...</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> ...Does that mean using a buggy machine to observe the world actually distorted the world&#39;s spatial structure, thereby creating gaps between spaces just like the lines on a Go board!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I&#39;m not sure, but I think it might be simpler than that.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> No, I get the feeling it&#39;s actually simpler than that.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...You&#39;re right, Senpai! Someone must have distorted Void Space at the start of all this!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Yeah. I don&#39;t think it was a machine that did all this.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I think somebody must have observed thosegaps using the machine as a guide.</p><hr><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> Indeed, it has always been my suspicion that it was not a machine that trapped us here, but a being.</p><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> Perhaps it was someone with the same kind of special power we have witnessed, and even benefited from, numerous times thus far?</p><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> Yes, since Yang Guifei has the power to project highly advanced visuals onto Void Space entities, and Van Gogh&#39;s blood has the power to convert those entities into real beings...</p><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> ...then perhaps it was another Foreigner who manipulated the Reverse Side of the World&#39;s Void Space into its present form?</p><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> If that is so, it explains the shape of the gaps between spaces.</p><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> Especially if we assume that this Foreigner got the idea by looking at this game board-like monitor, and recreated it, gaps and all.</p><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> In that case, since we know beyond a doubt that Yang Guifei was summoned here from the Throne after this incident had already begun, then the most likely suspect would seem to be–</p><p><strong>Nemo Marine:</strong><br> It&#39;s gotta be Van Gogh!<br> She&#39;s the one behind all of this!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Everyone, quiet down! Let&#39;s verify first.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Hang on. We need to verify this hypothesis first.</p><hr><p><strong>Nemo Professor:</strong><br> Good point. Then let&#39;s find out right now if these gaps between spaces–I&#39;ll call them “Go Board Spaces” for the time being–really do exist.</p><p><strong>Nemo Professor:</strong><br> I think we can say that both Yang Guifei and Osakabehime have unconsciously been conducting their searches under the assumption that the space we&#39;re in now is a typical three-dimensional one.</p><p><strong>Nemo Professor:</strong><br> So we&#39;ll completely reconsider that aspect while calculating to determine if there&#39;s anything that would contradict the existence of these Go Board Spaces.</p><p><strong>Nemo Professor:</strong><br> Okay, let&#39;s put our heads together, construct a magecraft function based on this new hypothesis, and update the monitor once we have.</p><p><strong>Nemo Professor:</strong><br> In the meantime, we all need to keep a cool head.<br> And actually, Captain, do you think you can come<br> back here soon?</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> ...I can&#39;t leave Van Gogh alone right now, and I can&#39;t bring her to the bridge now, either.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> That&#39;s okay. We&#39;ll make do.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Okay everyone, let&#39;s figure this out.</p><hr><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Nemo Professor:</strong><br> You were right on, Master.</p><p><strong>Nemo Professor:</strong><br> Once we re-examined our garbled scan data under this Go Board Spaces hypothesis, all the inconsistencies we&#39;d been struggling with disappeared.</p><p><strong>Nemo Professor:</strong><br> We also found a way to adjust our targeting coordinates to aim at these Go Board Spaces, and devised movement spells that will let our weaponry reach them.</p><p><strong>Nemo Professor:</strong><br> Now we can finally torpedo the enemies hiding out in the spaces between spaces. All that&#39;s left is to give the signal to counterattack.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Really!? Then let&#39;s see if it works right now! I&#39;m sick and tired of getting shot at and not being able to do anything about it!</p><p><strong>Lambda:</strong><br> Do you really think we could do that now?<br> With all this tension?</p><p><strong>Lambda:</strong><br> We have calls coming from inside AND outside the house–well, ship, in this case. Wouldn&#39;t it be wiser to focus on beefing up our internal security first?</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Not at all. The best strategy to distract from internal problems is to give everyone an external enemy to focus on.</p><p><strong>Lambda:</strong><br> ...You&#39;re even more twisted than I thought, aren&#39;t you?</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Just a little Genji humor. At any rate, as the shadow prefect, I have my own piece to say!</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Van Gogh is innocent! Believe me, I investigated her very thoroughly, and I never found a single piece of incriminating evidence!</p><p><strong>E：Nemo Marine:</strong><br> Oh come on. I could believe that if you were a Caster or an Assassin, but a Lancer?</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Ah... Well, I suppose I can understand your concern...</p><p><strong>E：Nemo Marine:</strong><br> Besides, she could&#39;ve just glanced at the monitor.<br> It wouldn&#39;t take any time at all.</p><p><strong>E：Nemo Marine:</strong><br> And who knows what&#39;s going on inside<br> a Foreigner&#39;s head, anyway?</p><p><strong>D：Nemo Marine:</strong><br> Yeah! We still have no reason to trust her!</p><p><strong>F：Nemo Marine:</strong><br> Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!</p><p><strong>Nemo Professor:</strong><br> Uh-oh. This is not good...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Oh no.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Don&#39;t tell me.</p><hr><p><strong>Nemo Marine:</strong><br> It&#39;s mutiny tiiime!</p><p><strong>Nemo Marine:</strong><br> Van Gogh&#39;s gotta buuurn!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Khh! Please calm down, Nemo Marines!<br> There&#39;s no need for violence!</p><p><strong>Fran:</strong><br> They&#39;re tougher than I thought!</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> And there&#39;s so many of them... It&#39;s going to be difficult to defeat them without injuring them!</p><p><strong>Lambda:</strong><br> Who cares if they get injured!? They&#39;re clones, right!? Just cut them down and be done with it!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Nobody&#39;s cutting anyone!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Captain! Can&#39;t you do something to stop them!?</p><hr><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Captain!? Please say something, Captain!</p><p><strong>Nemo Professor:</strong><br> Yup, this is bad. The main unit&#39;s so overloaded that it&#39;s starting to malfunction.</p><p><strong>Nemo Professor:</strong><br> If one of the clones gets destroyed now, he won&#39;t be able to recover their data or their Spirit Origin, which will cause a whole other set of problems. Big ones.</p><p><strong>Nemo Professor:</strong><br> We can try rebooting the main unit, but myself, Baker, Nurse, and Engineer all have to authorize it.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> At this rate, we&#39;ll all be killed<br> before we decide on a plan!</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> Come on, guys, stop it! Why are you doing this!?<br> We&#39;re all friends here, remember!?</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> Goghie&#39;s a good girl! I know it! If there&#39;s something wrong with her Spirit Origin that&#39;s causing this, then there must be a way to fix it!</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> And if there isn&#39;t, then...I&#39;ll stop her myself!<br> So please, cut this ouuut!</p><p><strong>Nemo Marines:</strong><br> Waaah!</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> My strength shall lift the mountains,<br> and my might shall conquer the world...</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> There. I have used my weakest attack to subdue all thirteen enemies.</p><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> Xi–</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Xi–</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Xiang Yu!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> What are you doing here!?</p><hr><p><strong>Xiang Yu:</strong><br> I awoke because I initially calculated this incident would be over by now. That seems not to be the case.</p><p><strong>Xiang Yu:</strong><br> My apologies, everyone. It seems my foresight was limited with regard to these events.</p><p><strong>Xiang Yu:</strong><br> Even so, the fact that you are all still alive must mean the three things I left to help Master must served their purpose.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Only three things?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I think you miscounted there, Xiang Yu.</p><hr><p><strong>Xiang Yu:</strong><br> What? Does this mean the drawing I left on the wall was not sufficiently clear?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> No, we got your message there.</p><hr><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I&#39;m talking about your fourth hint.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> You forgot the hint you just gave us.</p><hr><p><strong>Xiang Yu:</strong><br> Aha. Now I understand.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Oh! I get it now too, Master!</p><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> Indeed. Of all the tricks for the culprit to employ...</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Huh? What are you guys talking about?<br> Don&#39;t leave me in the dark out here alone!</p><p><strong>Lambda:</strong><br> Don&#39;t worry, you&#39;re not alone. Most of us here, myself included, are in the same boat.</p><p><strong>Lambda:</strong><br> Go on, Fujimaru,<br> just tell us what it is already.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Anyway, between the twelve marines, Engineer, Professor, Nurse, and me, we have sixteen crew members altogether.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> And that&#39;s the Nemo Series lineup who&#39;ll be manning the ship for our training exercise today.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...There are supposed to be<br> twelve Nemo Marines in total.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> So why are there thirteen!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> And it looks like one of them isn&#39;t knocked out.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> You there, quit faking and get up.</p><hr><p><strong>Nemo Marine (Fake):</strong><br> ...Ahahaha, I really messed up here, huh? I never thought you&#39;d get all of us in one place like this.</p><p><strong>Nemo Professor:</strong><br> I-I can&#39;t believe it... How did an imposter make their way into the Nemo Series when we&#39;re all using Memory Partition?</p><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> I think that is exactly the blind spot the culprit took advantage of.</p><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> You may all share what you see and feel, but perhaps you were too reliant on your sense of sight.</p><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> While I&#39;m sure you would have noticed the change in your shared senses immediately if one of your Series were to do something abnormal, or if one of you went missing...</p><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> ...there is no way you would have noticed any change when an imposter who looks just like you did the same. That you received no thoughts or senses from them made this easier.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> B-but I&#39;ve been keeping an eye on the marines all this time to ensure none of them got up to anything indecent!</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Still, as long as I am around, I will not let a clone or two distract me from my duties.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You said yourself that dealing with clones was tough, Raikou.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I guess thirteen clones was too many for you to keep up with.</p><hr><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> ...I suppose you&#39;re right, Master.<br> I&#39;m sorry for failing you... (Depressed)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> B-but then, who could the extra<br> Nemo Marine possibly be!?</p><p><strong>Nemo Marine (Fake):</strong><br> Good question! Wanna take a guess?</p><p><strong>Xiang Yu:</strong><br> Master, according to my calculations–</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> That&#39;s okay. I got it.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Don&#39;t worry. I already figured it out.</p><hr><p><strong>Nemo Marine (Fake):</strong><br> Oh yeah? Then prove it!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You&#39;re...</p><hr><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...Katsushika Hokusai.</p><hr><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Nemo Marine (Fake):</strong><br> Hehe. Hehehehe.</p><p><strong>Nemo Marine (Fake):</strong><br> Ahahahahahahaha!!!</p><p><strong>Nemo Marine (Fake):</strong><br> Well, guess the cat&#39;s outta the bag now!</p><p><strong>C：Katsushika Hokusai:</strong><br> Th-that&#39;s right, it&#39;s me! The invincible Swimsuit Swordmaster, painter, and fairy: Katsushika Hokusai!!!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Now? Really?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> This is hardly the time or place for that shtick.</p><hr><p><strong>C：Katsushika Hokusai:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong><br> Gaaah! Just forget ya saw that, all right!?</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong><br> I just can&#39;t pretend ta be my younger self sober any longer, not even to pass the Spirit Origin scan!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> So it wasn&#39;t your summer self, Hokusai?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> You were the one disguising yourself as a marine, Oei?</p><hr><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong><br> ...Anyway, how&#39;d ya know it was me, Master?</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong><br> Is it &#39;cause I&#39;m a Foreigner?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> No, it wasn&#39;t that.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> You&#39;ve been leaving clues here and there.</p><hr><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Well, except for the marines; they all have basically the same personality. You can think of them as one person sharing twelve bodies.</p><p><strong>Nemo Marine:</strong><br> You noticed, huh? Yeah, I drew those little swirls on the cheeks there myself. I thought it&#39;d be cuter that way.</p><p><strong>Nemo Marine:</strong><br> Besides, it&#39;s more fun having one that&#39;s not exactly like everyone else&#39;s, you know?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You were the only marine to customize their doll.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> The marines are all pretty much the same person.</p><hr><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong><br> Aha. Yeah, ya got me there. This little dolly was so well-made I couldn&#39;t help but try and one-up it.</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong><br> Those swirls I drew are actually teeny-tiny dragon crests. I&#39;ll show &#39;em to ya later.</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong><br> Anyway, now that that&#39;s settled, let&#39;s get goin&#39;! Oh, and if you get bored, ya can always take a gander at the picture scrolls I painted.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I also remember the scroll you showed me back then.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> And then there was the scroll you painted under your own name.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Oh! I&#39;ve seen that one in the database, too! It&#39;s called “Kan&#39;u Kappizu”, or “Operating on Guan Yu&#39;s Arm,” and it&#39;s one of the few known paintings by Katsushika Oui that still exist today!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It&#39;s a bold, gruesome painting that depicts the famous general Guan Yu ignoring the pain of his wound while playing Go!</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong><br> Aww, you guys remember that painting, Master, Mash?<br> Glad ta hear it made an impression on ya.</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong><br> I&#39;ll be honest, I remembered that painting I showed ya when I saw how this here monitor looked like a game board.</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong><br> I thought “That&#39;s it. If I just swap the shogi board out for a Go one, I can&#39;t lose.”</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> So it&#39;s just you then, Oei?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> What happened to Toto-sama?</p><hr><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong><br> Toto-sama&#39;s empty right now. Well, more like he&#39;s busy bein&#39; the antenna to the Outer God.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> So this was all your doing, Hokusai?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> So you&#39;re the one behind all this?</p><hr><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong><br> Yeah, you could say that!</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong><br> I mixed water an&#39; ink into the void to make these seas dangerous! I&#39;ve been paintin&#39; rocks and monsters left an&#39; right ta slow you down, Master!</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong><br> I added that sonar thingy I heard about at the workshop to the monsters! I got the idea ta hide &#39;em in the space between Go board spaces by sneakin&#39; a peek at the bridge!</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong><br> ...And I did it all to stop you and this ship, Master.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> But...why?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I don&#39;t understand. Why would you do that?</p><hr><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong><br> Ain&#39;t it obvious? For a painter, this Void Sea place&#39;s a dream come true!</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong><br> It&#39;s like one giant, blank canvas stretchin&#39; out far as the eye can see! And all ya gotta do to get all the paint ya want is stare into the void awhile. What kinda painter would I be if I didn&#39;t try ta paint somethin&#39; here?</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong><br> But for some reason, ol&#39; Toto-sama wasn&#39;t convinced! He kept hemmin&#39; an&#39; hawwin&#39; about whether it was okay for us ta paint here or not!</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong><br> So just this once, I gave &#39;im a bop on the noggin and disobeyed him. I decided I was gonna get on the Nautilus myself, come hell or high water.</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong><br> That was how he ended up like this...<br> an&#39; I&#39;ve been doin&#39; my own thing ever since.</p><p><strong>Nemo Professor:</strong><br> No way. I don&#39;t buy it. You might be a genius painter, but you don&#39;t have any skill that would let you disguise yourself as a Nemo Marine.</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong><br> Oh, that? I got somethin&#39; of a metaphysical critical when I used Item Construction. It let me past ta ship scans.</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong><br> I also lucked out when this Spirit Origin ended up fightin&#39; for dominance with my Saber Oei one, since that knocked out my vital signs.</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong><br> That made stowin&#39; away a piece of cake!</p><p><strong>Nemo Professor:</strong><br> You&#39;ve got to be kidding me!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Metaphysical crits. What can you do?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Nothing we can do about it then.</p><hr><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> Um, excuse me? Can I just say one thing, please!?</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> ...It&#39;s a pleasure to properly meet you, Lady Katsushika Hokusai. My name&#39;s Yang Yuhuan, though I&#39;m historically known as Yang Guifei.</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> I&#39;m also a Foreigner, just like you are.</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong><br> Yeah, I know. And damn if you ain&#39;t even more of a beauty than I&#39;d heard! I&#39;d love ta paint yer portrait sometime!</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong><br> So, what&#39;s a nation&#39; ruinin&#39; princess like you wanna say to a humble painter like me?</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> Have you really sworn loyalty to the Outer God?</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong><br> Ahahahahaha! Ahahahahahahaha!</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong><br> Couldn&#39;t be further from my mind!</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong><br> I just want a little time to paint aaaaaall the pictures I can.</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong><br> You don&#39;t mind stayin&#39; a little longer, do you, Master?</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong><br> I&#39;m just askin&#39; ya to keep the ship here about...two hundred years or so.</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong><br> That way, I won&#39;t hafta sic any more beasties on ya, or threaten ya with cannons, or anythin&#39; like that. You can all just hang out, relax, and enjoy yourselves. How&#39;s that sound?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Not great, to be honest.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I can&#39;t do that.</p><hr><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong><br> That so.</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong><br> In that case...</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> Master, I think this is exactly what I was summoned for! All you have to do is give the order!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Yang Guifei! Everyone! You know what you have to do!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I need you all to stop Hokusai!</p><hr><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> Mingbaile! Understood!!!</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> I&#39;ll do whatever it takes to subdue her!<br> Hang in there, Goghie...!</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong><br> Ghh! Hehehe, looks like I mighta bitten off a little more than I can chew!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I-I can&#39;t believe how strong she is! She&#39;s nothing like her file in the database!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Is she linked to the Outer God...? Is that all it takes to make someone this much stronger!?</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> Still, at least we&#39;ve got her on the ropes now!</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> Lady Hokusai, I have one last question for you!</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> When I asked if you were the one behind all this, you said, “Yeah, you could say that!”</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> Now, I want you to elaborate on that statement.</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> Tell me, was the being who enticed you into doing this a god, or a human?</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong><br> Beats me. All I know is, someone called ta me,<br> and I answered.</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong><br> Someone far, far away... A voice from the deepest reaches of the Void Sea!</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> ...!<br> Then, does that mean–</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong><br> Nope, no more yappin&#39;! Fights and fires might be Edo&#39;s flowers, but battlin&#39; with our Noble Phantasms is us Heroic Spirits&#39; flower!</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong><br> Ph’nglui ph’nglui, On Sochirishuta Sowaka,<br> wgah&#39;nagl fhtagn...!</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> Imperial edict! In the name of His Imperial Highness&#39;s Consort, I, Yang Taizhen–</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Both of you, cut it out!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Stop it before one of you ends up dead!</p><hr><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Hokusai...?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Huh? Van Gogh!?</p><p><strong>Nemo Professor:</strong><br> What happened over there, Nurse!?</p><p><strong>Nemo Nurse:</strong><br> Ow ow ow... I&#39;m sorry.<br> Van Gogh surprised me and tied me up...</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> Hokusai, Hokusai, Hokusai!<br> Ehehe, ehehe, I&#39;ve been wanting to meet you!</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong><br> Well now, so we got yet another beauty on board I ain&#39;t never seen before.</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong><br> You the one who called me here?</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> Huh? I...called you...?</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong><br> Deeper, deeper...</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> ...Further, further...</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> ...Ah.</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> I... Did I...</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong><br> Also, did I hear &#39;em say your name is Van Gogh? As in Vincent van Gogh, the painter from the Netherlands?</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> Yes, that&#39;s me... I&#39;m honored...you&#39;ve heard of me...</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong><br> ...Nah, that ain&#39;t right. Who are you, really?</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong><br> Ever since I got summoned ta this day an&#39; age, you better believe I been lookin&#39; up work from artists who started paintin&#39; after I died.</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong><br> That definitely goes for Mr. Van Gogh&#39;s work, too.<br> I spent a hell of a long time studyin&#39; his paintings.</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong><br> An&#39; the moment I took a gander at &#39;em, I could tell right away that they were just like mine!</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong><br> Don&#39;t get me wrong. It means the world ta me knowin&#39; one of the art world&#39;s biggest names took a likin&#39; ta my work.</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong><br> But...</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong><br> While Van Gogh mighta dug Hokusai&#39;s style, they say he was always more a fan of that Hiroshige youngster.</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong><br> Haha, and ya know what? I believe it. I can practically smell Hiroshige&#39;s hands all over Van Gogh&#39;s work.</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong><br> That tells me Van Gogh was a guy, not a gal. A naive, sensitive fella who prob&#39;ly caught more than his share of colds.</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong><br> Trust me, it takes a lot more than becomin&#39; a Servant ta change a painter&#39;s whole essence. Just take a look at that Da Vinci guy.</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong><br> So, I know this is the pot callin&#39; the kettle black here, but...I don&#39;t know you.</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong><br> Who are you really, lady?<br> You might call yourself Van Gogh, but–</p><p><strong>Lambda:</strong><br> Ha!</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong><br> Guh!</p><p><strong>Lambda:</strong><br> That was my glamorous Alter Ego special attack. I do hope you liked it.</p><p><strong>Lambda:</strong><br> I trust you don&#39;t mind, Fujimaru?<br> It seemed like she&#39;d said everything she had to say.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> U-uh, yeah, no problem.</p><hr><p><strong>Lambda:</strong><br> Good. Now you can deal with the bigger problem at hand. I look forward to seeing just how deep your love really goes.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I don&#39;t know exactly what sort of problem Van Gogh is struggling with...but do we really have no other choice but to pry into it now?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I mean, we&#39;re under so much pressure, and Captain isn&#39;t here with us either...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Hey, Goghie?</p><hr><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> ...Who&#39;s that?</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> It can&#39;t be me...</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> It looks like...I&#39;m just a nameless Foreigner...</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> ...who called Hokusai to the Void Sea...and tried to kill you all...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I don&#39;t care about any of that.</p><hr><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Besides, it looks like the worst is behind us now.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I just want to talk. That&#39;s all.</p><hr><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> ...Can I just ask you one thing, Master?</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> ...Do you know who I really am?<br> The true identity of my Heroic Spirit...?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...One thing at a time, okay? Let&#39;s just take it easy for now.</p><hr><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> Please, tell me...</p><p><strong>H：???:</strong><br> Clytie.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Huh?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> That wasn&#39;t me!</p><hr><p><strong>H：Nemo Marine:</strong><br> Clytie. Clytie. Clytie.<br> Clytie. Clytie. Clytie.</p><p><strong>I：Nemo Marine:</strong><br> Clytie. Clytie. Clytie.<br> Clytie. Clytie. Clytie.</p><p><strong>J：Nemo Marine:</strong><br> Clytie. Clytie. Clytie.<br> Clytie. Clytie. Clytie.</p><p><strong>Nemo Professor:</strong><br> Aah! They&#39;re all glitching!</p><p><strong>Nemo Professor:</strong><br> Come on, guys, cut it out! There&#39;s a reason Captain&#39;s been keeping that to himself!</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> Clytie...</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> Clytie?</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> Right... Ehehe, I remember now. That name was tucked away deep inside the knowledge I received from the Throne...</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> I see... Ehehe, ehehe!<br> It&#39;s the perfect name for me!</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> Oh... Is that why I bloomed?</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> Though, you know, Master...</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> Even after hearing that name, I still can&#39;t help but think of myself as Van Gogh. I can&#39;t escape his memories, either...</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> So...</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> So I&#39;ll go do my best to die on my own!</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> Somewhere deeper and further away, where I won&#39;t make any more trouble for any of you!</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> Ehehe, goodbye, Master! Goodbye, Lady Yang Guifei! Goodbye, everyone! A heartfelt handshake, to each of you!</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> Please give my regards to Nemo!</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> ...Huh?</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> This...can&#39;t be happening...<br> Goghie... Why?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> This is terrible!<br> Why do things never seem to go our way?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Never mind that now! We&#39;ve got to wake Captain up!Then we can go look for Goghie!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> First things first!We can find Goghie once we&#39;ve woken Captain up!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Right! This is all very confusing for everyone, but we&#39;ll do our best to help as much as we can!</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> I&#39;m really sorry, everyone. I guess the Memory Partition logic still has some serious bugs.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> I&#39;ll ask Sion to refine it as soon as we get back to the Wandering Sea.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Of course, that doesn&#39;t change the fact that I put all of you in danger. And on top of that, now Van Gogh&#39;s up and disappeared...</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> I can&#39;t tell you how sorry I am. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll ever be able to make amends for this mess.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> It&#39;s okay. We haven&#39;t permanently lost anything yet.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Don&#39;t worry, Nemo. I honestly don&#39;t think you did anything wrong.</p><hr><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> ...Thank you, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> All right, getting back on track: we need to prepare for the final phase of this operation. Let&#39;s start by assessing our current situation.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Right. First, the Nemo Marines that were behaving erratically are still operating, albeit with their personalities temporarily suspended.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The rest of the Nemo Series are still functioning as usual, though their opinions on what we should do next remain divided.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> That&#39;s largely because I&#39;m still conflicted about this whole thing myself. I won&#39;t ever let my thoughts shut down like that again though.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Sounds like your mind&#39;s just about made up.</p><hr><p><strong>Fran:</strong><br> Hokusai&#39;s in the slammer.<br> But she looks sane.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Indeed. Toto-sama has woken up too, though he claims he doesn&#39;t remember anything.</p><p><strong>Lambda:</strong><br> Maybe so, but that doesn&#39;t mean we can let her out. There&#39;s no telling when she might start acting up again.</p><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> The professor and I examined her Spirit Origin graph, and it seems her skills were illegally modified.</p><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> Father-Daughter Bond, the skill she uses to fight off the evil god&#39;s influence, was temporarily weakened, and in exchange, her Item Construction skill was significantly enhanced.</p><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> Disturbing though it may be, if this is the method the evil god used to influence her, then it is well within our means to counteract.</p><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> I have already equipped her with a Mystic Code that should neutralize the weakening effects. Now, all we can do is wait and see what happens next.</p><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> Fortunately, she has been quite cooperative since her capture, so for the time being, she should no longer be a concern.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Then that just leaves one problem: Van Gogh.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> In that case, we just have to figure out what to do about Goghie.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Right... We searched the entire ship top to<br> bottom, but we haven&#39;t found her anywhere.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> There&#39;s no trace of her in any of our system logs, either. It&#39;s like she completely disappeared...</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Chotto a minute! Are we really not gonna talk about how she wasn&#39;t actually Vincent van Gogh in the first place!?</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> For that matter, who is this Clytie person, anyway?</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> I&#39;m sorry. I think there were a lot of gaps in the knowledge I received from the Throne...</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> ...Clytie&#39;s a figure from Greek mythology. She&#39;s not very well-known, so it&#39;s no surprise that you might not have heard of her.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> She&#39;s one of the three thousand Oceanids–the water nymph daughters of the titan of the seas, Oceanus, and his wife and sister, Tethys.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Her story is one of tragic love, envy, and desolation.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Long, long ago, Apollo, god of the Sun and the arts, had fallen deeply in love yet again; this time, with a human.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Her name was Leucothoe. As the daughter of Orchamus, king of Persia, she was one of the most beautiful women in the world.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> But, although Apollo yearned deeply for Leucothoe,<br> he already had a lover:</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Clytie, a water nymph.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Though quite beautiful in her own right, she first despaired upon learning that Apollo had lost interest in her, then grew mad with envy.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Shortly thereafter, Clytie began filling King Orchamus&#39;s ears with all manner of vile stories about his daughter, with no regard for the truth of her tales.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Enraged, Orchamus called Leucothoe before him and had her put to death.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Apollo&#39;s heart broke in his grief, but even with Leucothoe gone, he never returned to Clytie&#39;s side.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> From then on, love would forever be beyond Clytie&#39;s grasp.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Though she regretted her actions, Clytie could never bring herself to abandon her love for the sun.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Morning, noon, and night,<br> she fixed her gaze upon the sun...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> ...and in time, she transformed from a nymph into a single flower.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I never would have imagined that Van Gogh was actually a character from Greek mythology...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Anyway, did I get Clytie&#39;s story right, Captain?</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Yes, that was spot-on. Thanks, Mash.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> When we first met Van Gogh, her flower girl motif almost immediately reminded me of Clytie, the water nymph who had a falling out with Apollo.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> The flower she becomes at the end of her story is called a heliotrope, which means something like, “to always face the sun.”</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> However, later retellings often depict her turning into a sunflower instead.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Of course, the Van Gogh we know also uses sunflowers prominently in a variety of ways, but so did Van Gogh the painter.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> He often used sunflowers in his paintings to represent the sun&#39;s warmth. In fact, some of his best-known work is actually a series of paintings titled “Sunflowers.”</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> On top of that, both our Van Gogh and the painter Van Gogh tended toward self-destruction.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> True. Vincent van Gogh was very intelligent, but he also struggled to manage his passions, which sometimes led to him harming himself.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> While Clytie&#39;s story definitely shows how unrequited love can make one do foolish things...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...I think the fact that her intense regrets made her turn into a flower could also be seen as her need to punish herself.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> When you think about it, for two Heroic Spirits with different backgrounds, and even genders, Van Gogh and Clytie do have a lot in common.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> ...I&#39;d guess Van Gogh&#39;s Spirit Origin is actually mostly Clytie.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> For one thing, further analysis shows us that she has a high ranking of Divinity, something you rarely see in Servants from modern eras.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> At first I thought that was just because she&#39;s a Foreigner, but if she&#39;s actually a nymph directly descended from titans, that would explain it much better.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Yet despite that, her memories are all Vincent van Gogh&#39;s, rather than Clytie&#39;s.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Which means...she must be a Phantom Spirit.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Maybe she&#39;s a Phantom Spirit then?</p><hr><p><strong>Lambda:</strong><br> She could also be a High Servant. Both her Van Gogh side and Clytie side seem fairly high-ranked, after all.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> I don&#39;t know. But I do know that, unlike you and me, she&#39;s been melded together from very disparate parts.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Now, she&#39;s a Heroic Spirit with the mind and body of Clytie, a female nymph, and Van Gogh, a male artist.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Her very existence is one giant contradiction.<br> It&#39;s no wonder she&#39;s so unstable.</p><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> Now I see. That must be what the Outer Gods are after.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You think so?</p><hr><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> I do. I can tell. After all, in one sense, I am an “outer” god myself.</p><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> So I can understand what they&#39;re thinking, though only up to a point.</p><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> When these gods set about making the Heroic Spirit we know as Van Gogh...</p><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> ...it must have been for the purpose of invading your world–that is, modern-day Earth.</p><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> The way from the outer to the inner, and from void to reality, is long and treacherous. It is not the sort of path that can be crossed in a single leap.</p><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> Indeed, even the strongest of gods could die a sudden, ignominious death if they were to stumble in the wrong spot.</p><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> So they must have sought a place they could use as a foothold into your world, a bridgehead or outpost of sorts.</p><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> They found one in Void Space. It is a completely unobservable zone, both next-door neighbor and distant destination to Reality Space, separated only by a thin wall of recognition.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Um, excuse me! I&#39;m sorry for interrupting, but does that mean this mysterious enemy already knows about Void Space?</p><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> I would think so, yes. We will need to come up with a means to counter that strategy upon our return.</p><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> At any rate, we now know that their plan was to send a Heroic Spirit to Void Space on an expedition to discover more of the yet unknown paradise.</p><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> To do this, they summoned Van Gogh to the void, where she proceeded to call Hokusai here and wait for us to arrive.</p><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> They clearly already have a means of accessing Void Space, yet instead of coming here directly, they chose to send a Heroic Spirit in their place...</p><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> I cannot profess to know what led to that decision, but given what we know of their goal, certainly their chosen Heroic Spirit must be capable of creating the base of operations they would need.</p><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> Furthermore, if we think back on what Van Gogh has accomplished thus far, we can surmise that she was given three duties to fulfill.</p><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> One: requisition local personnel. Two: create a local base. And three: deify the requisitioned personnel.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> N-now I get it. They planned to use Chaldea&#39;s Foreigners to bolster their ranks...</p><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> That&#39;s correct, Osakabe. I expect the cost of summoning Heroic Spirits to the void must be too great for them to amass an army that way.</p><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> So they must have thought to take advantage of our Servant resources and our access to Void Space, which they&#39;ve done quite well.</p><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> In answering Van Gogh&#39;s call, Hokusai developed a madness of her own, warping her skills and making her amenable to the Outer Gods&#39; desires.</p><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> Thus, once she had successfully disguised herself and stowed away aboard the Nautilus, the Outer Gods had everyone they needed.</p><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> Just as they planned, Hokusai transformed Void Space into a sea, and went on to paint trenches, battleships, and other grand works into existence.</p><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> Had we not stopped her, she may have eventually succumbed to her madness completely and painted a temple for these evil gods that they could use for their outpost.</p><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> I do not know how they planned to mount an assault on Reality Space from there...</p><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> ...but if nothing else, I expect we would have been forced to give up the Paper Moon in order to stop them.</p><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> And that, of course, would have put an end to any hope we had of restoring Proper Human History.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> Hehe, now, now, none of that. This may sound strange coming from me, but now that we have come this far...</p><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> ...I certainly have no wish to<br> see your world come to an end.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Wow. I had no idea we were that close to disaster...</p><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> Indeed we were.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Then the Outer Gods must have had Hokusai in their sights right from the start. So when they realized they could use her ukiyo-e connection with Vincent van Gogh to bring her here...</p><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> Indeed. That is no doubt one reason they chose Van Gogh. But I suspect their true aim lies elsewhere.</p><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> Van Gogh&#39;s Noble Phantasm, The Starry Night, is a painting capable of swallowing the very world with its alternate depiction of reality. It can transform Foreigners into gods, and spread madness to all who gaze upon it.</p><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> So once the Void Space temple was complete, they must have planned on her using her Noble Phantasm to deify the other Foreigners.</p><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> No doubt that is the final phase of their plan–the grand mechanism through which these evil gods meant to descend upon Earth.</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> But...but that doesn&#39;t make sense!</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> If Goghie really wanted to do that, she could have turned me into an evil god whenever she liked! But she didn&#39;t!</p><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> Exactly.</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> Huh?</p><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> Though some types of Foreigners may be compatible with Void Space, if they should cease to be Servants...</p><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> Or rather, if their inner Divinity were to take control of them, would they not then lose those abilities as well?</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> ...Are you saying Goghie was going to betray us?</p><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> No, I am certain she had no desire to do that. Which is exactly why her Spirit Origin was melded with Clytie.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> What do you mean?</p><hr><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> I too have read up on Vincent van Gogh&#39;s history. While some may call him a mad artist, I could see that deep down, he was a man of strong convictions.</p><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> Though he may well have yearned for a connection with the gods beyond the stars, he would never willingly be party to their plans once he learned they were evil in nature.</p><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> One need only look to the life he lived as proof.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Wait. Are you saying the reason Van Gogh took his own life was because he learned that painting The Starry Night inadvertently invited an evil god into our world?</p><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> I am saying that if that was indeed the case, then he would be bound by a similar restriction even as a Heroic Spirit.</p><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> Vincent van Gogh would never succumb to madness–that is, the Outer Gods&#39; influence. He would sooner take his own life.</p><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> This must have been a great conundrum for the Outer Gods. The Noble Phantasm they desired above all others was wielded only by Heroic Spirit who would never obey them.</p><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> So they hatched a horrific plan: they would create their own patchwork Heroic Spirit who would meet their needs.</p><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> They thought, “What if we were to take Vincent van Gogh&#39;s memories and talent, and give them to Clytie instead?”</p><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> In Clytie&#39;s case, she refused to take her own life regardless of how much she loathed herself, choosing to become a flower rather than fade away. That is the crucial part.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Then, you mean...they prevented their chosen Heroic Spirit from being able to commit suicide, as her doing so would ruin their plans!?</p><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> Correct. Do you remember? Van Gogh herself said that she wished to die, but was unable to do so.</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> So, the Van Gogh side of her felt she should die in order to stop the Outer Gods&#39; plans, but the Clytie side refused to allow her to do so...</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> Poor Goghie. That&#39;s the cruelest antinomy I&#39;ve ever heard... No, even without those fundamentally opposed beliefs jostling for control, the sheer discrepancy between Clytie&#39;s mind and Van Gogh&#39;s memories alone must have been so hard for her...</p><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> It seems the Outer Gods and madness are inextricably intertwined. Foreigners, indeed.</p><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> With suicide no longer an option, if Van Gogh lost the battle in her mind and succumbed to the madness, then she may no longer have had any compunctions against using her Noble Phantasm.</p><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> If that had come to pass, it would only be a matter of time until the evil gods&#39; temple was complete, just as they planned.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> How awful...</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Man. I know Heroic Spirits are basically living weapons, but twisting one of us to this degree is just...yabai.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> So what do we do now?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> What can we do to help her?</p><hr><p><strong>Lambda:</strong><br> Fine, I&#39;ll be the one to say it. There&#39;s one simple solution here. It&#39;s as efficient as it is cruel.</p><p><strong>Lambda:</strong><br> We honor her wishes. We kill her.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I...</p><hr><p><strong>Lambda:</strong><br> Oh, shut off the waterworks. I just stating the obvious. If you really want to save her, you&#39;ll have to do the work of thinking up something less obvious.</p><p><strong>Lambda:</strong><br> But I will say this. We&#39;re agreed that she can&#39;t kill herself no matter how much she wants to, right?</p><p><strong>Lambda:</strong><br> That means, now she&#39;s disappeared, she must be running around lost and desperate at being unable to use her last resort.</p><p><strong>Lambda:</strong><br> The fact that she gave up on the only way left to make her wish come true by having someone else kill her may even be a sign that her madness has reached its peak.</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> ...!</p><p><strong>Lambda:</strong><br> Oh come now, Ms. Timeless Beauty. Glaring at me won&#39;t accomplish anything here.</p><p><strong>Lambda:</strong><br> We all need to be aware that Van Gogh is only one step away from entering her final, most dangerous phase.</p><p><strong>Lambda:</strong><br> If you want to save her from that fate, then you&#39;ll have to rack your brains to come up with a plan that&#39;s just, kind, wise, and smart.</p><p><strong>Lambda:</strong><br> If you manage to pull that off, then I suppose I might consider helping you out a bit more. If I feel like it.</p><p><strong>Fran:</strong><br> I&#39;ll help too. I want to slack off more with Van Gogh.</p><p><strong>Fran:</strong><br> Go get Van Gogh... Go Gogh.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> I, too, will do my best to save this poor girl from her sad fate. Any honorable warrior would do the same.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> And of course, the very idea of letting these evil gods descend upon our world is outrageous! That would be an absolutely unacceptable affront to public decency!</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Yang Guifei, the Nautilus–No, wait.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Speaking as Captain Nemo, Phantom Spirit, I promise I&#39;ll do everything in my power to save her.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> And if I&#39;ve learned anything about you two over the course of this voyage, Acting Commander and Acting Vice Commander, it&#39;s that you both feel the same.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Damn straight.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> We&#39;re not leaving here without her.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Absolutely!</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> There you have it. We&#39;re all of one mind on this.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> So, will you help us save her too, Yang Guifei?</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> ...!</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> Yes! Oui! Shi! Of course!<br> I&#39;ll do whatever it takes to rescue her!</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> But first we have to find her! So I&#39;m going to have to make use of your mobility whether you like it or not, Lady Lambda!</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> We&#39;ll also need resources! Goddess, anything you can help us find–new weapons, new information, anything–will be a huge help!</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> Oh, and we&#39;ll also need to defeat the enemies hiding in the Go Board Spaces if we&#39;re going to get anywhere! Fran, Lady Raikou, I&#39;ll be counting on your help with that!</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> As for me, I&#39;ll put everything I have into finding those enemies! Will you look for them with me, Batty!?</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> ...Kyah! O-o-of course I will, Yu-Yu!</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Sorry, I got so caught up in watching everything unfold that I forgot I&#39;m actually part of it.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> But yeah, rescuing Professor Van Gogh? That sounds awesome! I&#39;m gonna work just as hard to make that happen as I did to make my deadline that summer!</p><p><strong>Xiang Yu:</strong><br> Excuse me.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Aah! Lord X-X-X-Xiang Yu!? I-I&#39;m so s-s-s-sumimasorry about calling you “Hegemon-King”!</p><p><strong>Xiang Yu:</strong><br> Hm? Oh, no, I am not at all concerned about that. As all paths I take are necessary, it was inevitable that history would come to know me by that moniker.</p><p><strong>Xiang Yu:</strong><br> I only wish to know if the naval chart I left you was entered into the computer&#39;s mapping system correctly.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Uh, yes, of course. I mean, we&#39;d never have made it this far in a million years without it.</p><p><strong>Xiang Yu:</strong><br> Then why are you all acting as though Clytie van Gogh&#39;s whereabouts are unknown?</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Huh?</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> Huh?</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Then, does that mean this final destination here is–</p><p><strong>Xiang Yu:</strong><br> Indeed. I already accounted for Clytie van Gogh&#39;s disappearance in my predictions.</p><p><strong>Xiang Yu:</strong><br> You should therefore be able to find her at that point.</p><p><strong>Xiang Yu:</strong><br> That said, my predictions show further conflict in the future, so I expect there will indeed be a fierce battle during the final stage of this incident.</p><p><strong>Xiang Yu:</strong><br> I also expect that our stockpile of resources will be the key to winning this battle, so I suggest we make every effort to ensure we are sufficiently prepared.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Thanks, Xiang Yu!</p><hr><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> ...!</p><p><strong>Xiang Yu:</strong><br> And Captain, belated though it may be, I owe you an apology. As much as time was of the essence, it was still wrong of me to tamper with your ship without your permission.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> ...Don&#39;t worry about it. If you hadn&#39;t done that, none of us would be here right now.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> I&#39;m glad you&#39;re on our side, Xiang Yu!</p><h2 id="idle-talk-3" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#idle-talk-3" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Idle Talk 3</h2><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Hmm. Okay, let me make sure I&#39;ve got this straight.<br> The key features that define these Outer Gods are:</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> One: they&#39;re huge, gross, and powerful.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Two: our usual physics and magecraft rules don&#39;t apply, which also makes it hard to communicate.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Three: they claim ownership rights to Earth, and inventor&#39;s rights to its life-forms.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Four: if they were actually in charge of Earth, they&#39;d turn it into something weird and grotesque.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Five: most of them have been imprisoned.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Six: while they generally act independently, some of them are allies, and some are enemies.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> And seven: Regardless of what they look like, they&#39;re not immortal metaphysical or conceptual beings. They&#39;re still flesh and blood creatures with life spans just as finite as ours.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> That...about sum it up?</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong><br> More or less. I am a bit concerned that we may be in danger of underestimating the threat they pose, but we can put that aside for the moment.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Now I get it. This theory is basically the antithesis of the last two thousand years of philosophical optimism.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> The author may as well be saying, “We&#39;re not pure beings, man. God isn&#39;t real. The only reason we&#39;re here is &#39;cause some gross, disgusting monsters made us.”</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> When you put it that way, it explains a lot about the Foreigner incidents that have cropped up so far.</p><p><strong>B：Sion:</strong><br> You think? Personally, I am inclined to write the whole idea off as fairy-tale nonsense.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Hey, don&#39;t be too quick to dismiss fairy tales, Sion. We&#39;ve already proven we can hypothesize about something like Void Space, after all.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Think of it this way. If the world of intellect we know is the inner side, and everything else is the outer side...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> ...then it&#39;s only logical that from our point of view, everything from ethics to world outlooks would be turned on their heads in that outer side.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> And that definitely lines up with the ideas of a certain early twentieth-century novelist.</p><p><strong>A：Sion:</strong><br> I still do not know.<br> The whole thing sounds ludicrous to me.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> You think? Anyway, let&#39;s move on.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> If we&#39;re dealing with Outer Gods here, the main points we need to worry about are five, six, and seven, right?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Since they can&#39;t make many direct moves, their options for intervening here are pretty limited.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> We might be able to leverage their oppositions to one another as a means to drive them away.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> And in the worst case, it&#39;s possible to use physical, magecraft, and other worldly means to destroy them.</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong><br> Fantastic! I have never seen anyone else grasp these ideas so quickly! You truly are a peerless genius!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Hehe, you know it!<br> All right, so what&#39;s this opposition about, anyway?</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong><br> Ah, yes. While some believe each of the Outer Gods belong to one of four factions, much like the four elementals of earth, water, fire, and wind...</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong><br> ...personally, I think that idea is preposterous, and has no basis in fact.</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong><br> However, it IS clear beyond a shadow of a doubt that there are some divinities who are innately opposed to one another simply by virtue of their conflicting natures.</p><p><strong>A：Sion:</strong><br> So some gods are in opposition to one another, huh... I do not know about that, but I do know that Hokusai and Abby do not seem in any way adversarial.</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong><br> Very true. In fact, they seem to be very good friends. Indeed, seeing them always brings a smile to my face.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> I&#39;m not gonna make a big thing of it now, but hearing that from you, it sounds more than a little ominous.</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong><br> Hohoho. At any rate, there&#39;s no telling what the future may bring.</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong><br> The way things are going now, it&#39;s only a matter of time until we encounter a Foreigner with clear hostile intent.</p><p><strong>A：Sion:</strong><br> So there is nothing we can do about that?<br> Well that is not encouraging.</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong><br> I am certain there is a divinity out there who considers Lady Hokusai their enemy, and the same also holds true for Lady Abigail!</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong><br> If both Foreigners were to, as they say, get into a tussle with their enemies, the chaos unleashed would be akin to hell on earth!</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong><br> And as heartwarming as that prospect may be, as the caretakers of this fine facility, I am sure that is a headache you would much prefer to avoid.</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong><br> However, it bears mentioning that if such a brawl did take place, it may actually lead to greater stability than we enjoy right now.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Is that your way of saying if we had one of these oppositional deities around, they would be a deterrent that keeps their enemy in check and stops the various Foreigners from going off the deep end?</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong><br> In essence, yes. As they say, fire is best fought with fire, and poison with poison. Indeed, even incurable poisons can be contained with another poison of equal potency.</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong><br> While I can see the sense in considering all Foreigners too dangerous to remain, I, for one, am firmly in favor of keeping them around.</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong><br> In fact, I would argue they are the very lamplights keeping the encroaching darkness at bay, thereby preventing a far more disastrous fire from ever occurring! That they are an unparalleled good omen here to fend off a threat to humanity from nothing less than another space-time continuum!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Hmmm. I think it&#39;s way too dangerous to go that far, but I do agree we shouldn&#39;t be too quick to get rid of them.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> After all, if knowledge is power, then the unknown is even more power.</p><p><strong>A：Sion:</strong><br> I agree with that, too. However, Marshal Gilles, there is still one thing I would like to ask you.</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong><br> By all means, Mademoiselle Sokaris.</p><p><strong>B：Sion:</strong><br> What do you think Foreigners actually ARE?</p><p><strong>B：Sion:</strong><br> Earlier, you described them as a kind of vaccine inoculating us against greater threats, but that is solely our way of looking at it, right?</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong><br> Ah yes, you have touched upon quite the key conundrum.</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong><br> What, we are all compelled to wonder, are they? Shrine maidens of evil gods? Vessels? Avatars? Replicas?</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong><br> I do have an opinion on the matter,<br> if you care to hear it.</p><p><strong>B：Sion:</strong><br> Of course.</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong><br> I believe they are genuine heroes.</p><p><strong>B：Sion:</strong><br> Oh?</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong><br> While one could certainly view them as an abnormal class that was created solely as a means of invading our world...</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong><br> ...the fact that these beings from the outer universe can only reach out to this world via the Throne of Heroes speaks volumes.</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong><br> The fact is, if these beings wish to come to our world, their only option is to don a Heroic Spirit–in other words, a human shadow that has left an indelible mark upon history.</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong><br> And what is that but an incredibly, incredibly binding restriction? It goes to show that even in the face of these Outer Gods, our world remains impenetrable and indomitable.</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong><br> So why should we be particularly afraid of their otherworldly madness? We know that humans are more than capable of going mad, killing, and destroying even without such influences.</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong><br> In fact, I will go so far as to say this: madness creates Anti-Heroes, which go on to create legends of terror.</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong><br> And the Throne of Heroes welcomes all of it.<br> I trust you see my point?</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong><br> The Foreigner girls are still in the midst of creating their legends, and they are doing so in exactly the same way as all the other Heroic Spirits did during their lifetimes.</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong><br> That is why I have no fear of Foreigners. Indeed, I welcome any and all new arrivals from their class.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> ...Well that turned out to be a more interesting discussion than I was expecting. Don&#39;t you think, Sion?</p><p><strong>A：Sion:</strong><br> I suppose so. Personally, I am still digesting the idea that new Anti-Heroes are being created even as we speak.</p><p><strong>Heroine XX:</strong><br> Yaaah! (Splash)</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Oh, hey there, Ms. XX.<br> Have you been swimming this whole time?</p><p><strong>Heroine XX:</strong><br> I have! Since we&#39;ve been seeing things like multiheaded and flying sharks lately, I thought I&#39;d get in some practice battles to prepare for the upcoming season!</p><p><strong>Heroine XX:</strong><br> Oh, crap, I didn&#39;t realize I&#39;d been out this late! I&#39;m off to nab whatever&#39;s left over from dinner!

(playing dumb).</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong><br> Getting back on track, by hook or by crook if necessary, I will say I feel a bit uneasy about one thing.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Oh? And what&#39;s that?</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong><br> Remember how I said that conflict between adversarial Foreigners should effectively allow them to cancel each other&#39;s power out?</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong><br> Well, if a Foreigner capable of mediating such a conflict were to show up...that would be another matter entirely.</p><h2 id="act-five-the-bottom-of-the-sea-blooming-and-yielding-1-2" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#act-five-the-bottom-of-the-sea-blooming-and-yielding-1-2" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Act Five: The Bottom of the Sea Blooming and Yielding (1/2)</h2><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> Deeper. Deeper...</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> Further. Further...</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> That&#39;s right. I did call out.</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> I definitely remember that.</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> I called out because I was lonely.</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> I need others. I need light.<br> I couldn&#39;t help but want that...</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> Because I&#39;m Clytie.</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> Everything makes sense now. So much more sense than thinking I was Van Gogh.</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> And yet, I am still Van Gogh.</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> The memories I built up over my short life... My way of life engraved upon my body... They all refuse to let me think of myself as anyone but Van Gogh.</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> But even so, I&#39;m still a woman. A morose coward.<br> A flower shadowed by mourning. A water nymph.</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> And this mind and body refuse to accept that I perceive myself as Van Gogh.</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> ...I wonder how much time I&#39;ve wasted on this pointless back-and-forth.</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> Time and time again I have tried tearing myself apart, but because I am not Van Gogh, it never works.</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> I&#39;ve almost ended up painting that picture so many times now, too. But I can&#39;t do that either now, because I&#39;m Van Gogh.</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> I&#39;m in so much pain that I kept cutting myself just to pass the time, only for my blood to cloud the arche–the water, until I could no longer see...</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> The next thing I knew, I was alone again. All alone, drifting aimlessly in the empty Void Sea.</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> But that&#39;s okay. I don&#39;t care anymore.</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> As long as I stay here and do nothing, at least I won&#39;t be a burden to anyone else anymore.</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> I won&#39;t die, I won&#39;t paint, and I won&#39;t call to anyone.</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> I&#39;ll just...drift here, forever.

Shallower! Higher! Higher!</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> I&#39;m picking up what feels like a cliff about twenty kilometers ahead of us! We might have a tough time making our way to Goghie!</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> Can you use your Bounded Field to pinpoint her location, Batty!?</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> You got it! Just leave everything to Batty!</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Hang in there, Professor Van Gogh! You might not look or act how I expected, but I still admire the jigoku out of your mad painting skills!</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> ...Shallower! Shallower! Higher! Higher!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Isn&#39;t sending out all those pings kind of tough?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Isn&#39;t it hard on you, sending out so many pings?</p><hr><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> Yes, it is! But right now, this is the only sound I can send out to the Void Sea!</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> There&#39;s no way I&#39;m letting Goghie sink down into the depths of grief without a fight! I&#39;m going to find her and pull her out of there, whatever it takes!</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> We&#39;re all getting out of this Zero Sail and going back to Reality Space together! I won&#39;t let her rot down here alone!</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> Yeah, that&#39;s right! I&#39;m fighting to save her, whether she wants me to or not! Come on, Goghie, hear me, dammit!</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> I have no problem with you trying to use your pings to get a message to her. We don&#39;t have any other means of communicating with her, after all.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> We&#39;ve stockpiled a mountain&#39;s worth of resources for this search and rescue, and we&#39;ve been putting up anti-beam and anti-explosive protections all around the Nautilus like they&#39;re going out of style.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> We also don&#39;t have to worry about small monsters or weak beam attacks at all now thanks to Yang Guifei and Osakabehime&#39;s familiars taking care of the little guys on their own.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> And if that&#39;s not enough, Raikou and I are stationed outside the ship!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> With both of our Noble Phantasms powered up, we&#39;ll sink any enemy ship we see before it can fire, and defend the ship from any A-rank attacks!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The combat team is taking out smaller enemies under Lambda&#39;s command, and they&#39;ll also work with Fran to take out the larger ones if necessary!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> That sounds great, Mash!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Now that&#39;s what I call teamwork!</p><hr><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> With this many offensive and defensive options at our disposal, we don&#39;t have to wait for enemies to find us anymore. We can draw them out with our active sonar.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> This is easily the most ridiculous submarine combat I&#39;ve ever seen, but this kind of breaking the mold is just what we, and Van Gogh, need right now!</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> Thanks, Captain! Speaking of combat, we&#39;ve got a huuuge swarm of enemies headed our way!</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Get them, familiars! The rest of you, take out the ones that slip past!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> This is frontline defense! Roger that! We have the situation well in hand!</p><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> Well, this is a pleasant surprise. I thought I would come see how my ship is faring since I finally have nothing to do in my workshop, and it would seem we have an overwhelming advantage now.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Don&#39;t jinx it. You know what they say comes before a fall.</p><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> What, pride? Come now, there is nothing wrong with taking a little pride in your work. As a blonde gentleman I once met somewhere said, what makes one a god if not pride?</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> Isn&#39;t that exactly what a leader says just before they&#39;re murdered in their sleep? It happened all the time whenever China changed dynasties. We called it the “Mandate of Heaven.”</p><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> Worry not; I have long since been deposed from my throne. Now, my only focus is loving humans everywhere. Leave the caution to them.</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> Ahahaha, I can&#39;t argue with that!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Hang on. “Your” ship?</p><p><strong>Nemo Professor:</strong><br> She&#39;s not wrong. The goddess has done an incredible amount of engineering and production over the course of this voyage.</p><p><strong>Nemo Professor:</strong><br> It would not be inaccurate to say that, at this point, roughly half of the Nautilus is her property.</p><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> Heh. Impressive, right? I ask no fee for my work. All I request in return is your love and adoration.</p><p><strong>Nemo Professor:</strong><br> Of course, there&#39;s no way these add-ons and modifications can be sustained in Reality Space, so we&#39;ll have to remove them and overhaul the whole ship once we get back. (Sniff)</p><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> Aww.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> This is the defensive team! We&#39;ve taken out almost all the enemies! We&#39;re heading back to the ship to resupply!</p><p><strong>Nemo Nurse:</strong><br> The infirmary is ready and waiting with all kinds of healing spells in case anyone is injured!</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Kitchen, we&#39;ve got warriors headed back! Make sure they all have something hot to drink!</p><p><strong>Nemo Baker:</strong><br> Kitchen here. Understood. I&#39;ll be waiting with everyone&#39;s usuals.</p><p><strong>Nemo Baker:</strong><br> ...You know, Master, once Goghie is back safe and sound, I&#39;d be happy to make you another elderflower cordial.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Thanks, Baker.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> That sounds great.</p><hr><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Engine room, we&#39;ll need flanking speed as soon as Osakabehime gets back. I know you don&#39;t need to actually warm up the engines, but keep them ready to go anyway.</p><p><strong>Nemo Engineer:</strong><br> Don&#39;t you worry about it! The Nautilus might look like some overgrown hippo now, but it&#39;s still my baby, dammit!</p><p><strong>Nemo Engineer:</strong><br> I&#39;ll make sure the engine keeps purring like a catfish, and you make sure you keep winning your battles! Engineer out!</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> ...It&#39;s too bad the marines&#39; consciousness is still frozen, but that aside, the entire Nemo Series is on the same page again.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> At this pace, we should be at our destination in about twenty or thirty minutes. Once again...I&#39;ll be counting on you, Fujimaru.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Don&#39;t worry. We&#39;ve got this.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Like I said: we&#39;re not leaving here without her.</p><hr><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> M-M-M-Ma-chan! Captain! We&#39;ve got an emergency!</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Now? That can&#39;t be good. All right, let&#39;s hear it. What&#39;d you find out?</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Well, uh, you know that cliff we spotted up ahead?</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Turns out, it&#39;s not a cliff at all! It&#39;s a really, really, REALLY dekahuge Professor Van Gogh!!!</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> Osakabe, are you absolutely certain you are not mistaken?</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Yes, I&#39;m positive!<br> Believe me, I double-checked a dozen times!</p><p><strong>Nemo Professor:</strong><br> It looks like this terrain is roughly circular, with about a three kilometer diameter...</p><p><strong>Nemo Professor:</strong><br> And you&#39;re telling us it&#39;s not a reef, but a Servant&#39;s body? I find that more than a little hard to believe.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> ...Fujimaru, how does that compare to the largest enemies you&#39;ve fought to date?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Uh...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Good question...</p><hr><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> It&#39;s actually spherical, not circular. It&#39;s kind of like a giant bowling ball floating in the middle of the Void Sea.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> The outside seems kind of like a spirit body&#39;s outer shell, complete with a powerful Spirit Core signal in the center.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> I think this is Professor Van Gogh&#39;s real body. And unfortunately, since it&#39;s a sphere, there&#39;s no quick or easy way for us to get to it.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> And...I&#39;m guessing here, but I don&#39;t think the outer shell is just a plain old wall. It feels really aggressive, and it&#39;s probably super dangerous...</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> I never would have imagined Van Gogh would mutate into something so massive...</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Maybe it&#39;s a side effect of Clytie&#39;s Spirit Origin. Like she&#39;s blooming instead of taking her own life.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Um, I don&#39;t think so. I&#39;m guessing this is still just a bud...which means we haven&#39;t reached the blooming stage yet...</p><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> So it truly is the advent of an evil god... Then again, this could simply be these Outer Gods&#39; plan B.</p><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> Perhaps they decided that, in the event they were unable to use Van Gogh to deify enough Foreigners, they could make her into a powerful god in her own right.</p><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> If that is indeed the case, it would make her both an undercover agent and a ticking time bomb.</p><p><strong>Nemo Professor:</strong><br> What should we do now, Captain? The ship&#39;s tougher than ever, but we never accounted for picking a fight with a glacier.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> I&#39;d like you all to come up with a plan that&#39;ll let us break through that shell with our existing firepower. Will you help us too, Goddess?</p><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> Of course. However, there is still one thing we need.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> What&#39;s that?</p><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> Sometimes, when one is facing impossible-seeming odds, one must turn to a malefactor for help. Is that not so?</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong><br> Who&#39;re you callin&#39; a malefactor!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Hey there, Oei.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Long time no see, Oei.</p><hr><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong><br> H-hey, Master. I, uh...</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong><br> Aw, forget it! I don&#39;t even remember how I got here! All I know&#39;s I was stuck in this cage when I came to, and now I can&#39;t even paint a damn picture!</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong><br> Whatever&#39;s going on, we Edoites don&#39;t make excuses for our deeds, even if we were drunk or in love at the time, so I ain&#39;t about to start now! Go ahead, do your worst!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You&#39;re not fooling anyone, Oei.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Just admit it, Oei. You do remember what happened, don&#39;t you?</p><hr><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong><br> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> It&#39;s okay. I&#39;m not mad.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I just want to know what happened. That&#39;s all.</p><hr><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong><br> ...<br> ...Okay.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Um, Hokusai? Why would you tell such an obvious lie?</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong><br> What else could I do!?<br> I ain&#39;t never been so ashamed in all my life!</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong><br> After I go outta my way to send Master off with a bang, I turn out ta be the bad guy who almost got you all killed!? And disgracin&#39; myself by first showin&#39; up in that swimsuit again to boot!?</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong><br> N-n-not to mention that, if I say I&#39;m a samurai, I&#39;d hafta commit seppuku to atone for my crimes, right!?</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong><br> So I couldn&#39;t help but try and, ya know,<br> sweep things under the rug...</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong><br> ...I&#39;m sorry, everyone...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Hmm... I guess it&#39;s okay.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Don&#39;t worry. Nobody&#39;s actually mad at you.</p><hr><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong><br> Y-ya mean it?</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> The fact is, no Servant is fully protected from someone or something tampering with their Spirit Origin.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It&#39;s true. A lot of them have been made to play parts in all kinds of wicked schemes, and they weren&#39;t all Foreigners by any means.</p><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> Indeed. So rest assured, there is no cause for you to be ashamed. We only kept you in here as a precaution, nothing more.</p><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> However, we can keep you here no longer, as we need your help. We would like your opinion on something, given that you painted this vast ocean into existence.</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong><br> ...H-haha. Well, in that case, yeah,<br> &#39;course I&#39;ll be glad ta help.</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong><br> All right, what happens in the Void Sea stays in the Void Sea, so no more shame for me! I&#39;ll do whatever I can ta put things right!</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong><br> First off, just so we&#39;re clear, I can&#39;t paint anythin&#39; into existence here now that I been cut off from the Outer God.</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong><br> But I do know this sea and this Go board better than anyone, and thanks to that, I can see a path to victory.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> You can!? That&#39;s great! What do we have to do?</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong><br> We use the gaps between the board&#39;s spaces.</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong><br> You guys prob&#39;ly already know this, but those gaps are each their own narrow cul-de-sacs. They&#39;re so narrow there&#39;s no way the Nautilus could get inside.</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong><br> They might be a little tough ta aim for, but once ya know the trick, they&#39;re useless as hidin&#39; places. That&#39;s what you guys thought they were, right?</p><p><strong>Nemo Professor:</strong><br> You mean they&#39;re not?</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong><br> Nope. They actually work just like a real Go board. Any place you surround? That becomes your territory.</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong><br> When you take over the smallest units of space, you cut off the moves your opponent can make with their Go stones and open up more for yourself.</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong><br> So if you guys take over the gaps right at the big gal&#39;s corners and make the space she&#39;s in your territory...</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong><br> ...you&#39;ll be able to jump right<br> into her center, no problem!</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Huh? So, put another way, if we occupy the four corners that make up the giant square area where Professor Van Gogh–I mean, the enemy is, we&#39;ll be able to just noclip right into her–uh, them?</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong><br> You got it! Pretty clever, right?</p><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> There is one thing I still don&#39;t understand. Why did you make such an elaborate mechanism only to never use it in the fourth area?</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong><br> ...&#39;Cause right when I was plannin&#39; to put down a bunch of Go stones and set a trap for you guys, you crushed the board with your Vajra thingy...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> (Now I feel a little guilty.)</p><hr><p><strong>Nemo Professor:</strong><br> If it&#39;s possible for us to warp directly inside the enemy&#39;s massive body, that&#39;ll save us a lot of time compared to cutting our way through.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Definitely. But to do that, we&#39;ll first need to seize control of these four Go Board Spaces, and with as few people as possible.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Once we&#39;ve done that, we&#39;ll cut down any obstacles we run into inside the enemy and rescue Van Gogh in the center.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Afterwards, we&#39;ll fire Raikou&#39;s lightning attack into the heart of the enemy&#39;s body to destroy it from the inside!</p><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> I see. Then our team formations all but decide themselves.</p><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> Raikou will assume torpedo duties. Lambdaryllis will be our legs. And Fran will deliver the final blows and aid in any rescues.</p><p><strong>Lambda:</strong><br> If I must. Since my penguins will have to be out there the whole time, I&#39;ll escort you all into the deep myself.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> (She finally admitted they&#39;re penguins...)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> (I&#39;ll be nice and pretend I didn&#39;t justhear her call her familiars “penguins.”)</p><hr><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> Fujimaru, since you will be unable to accompany them, we should have Fran carry a camera or something so you can see what is taking place.</p><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> Now, let&#39;s see... We will not need to worry about sonar while seizing control of these four points, so Osakabe and Yang Guifei can take one point each.</p><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> However, that still leaves two other fighter positions. And since Mash must protect the ship, I suppose I will just have to fill one of them myself.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Huh? Really?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Are you sure about this?</p><hr><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> If all I need to do is seize a single point of territory, then I should be fine. However, I do not expect to be of any use in battle, so I will be counting on you to handle that,<br> Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong><br> All right, now that it looks like my work here&#39;s done, I&#39;m just gonna head out back an&#39; paint a fisherperson&#39;s banner or somethin&#39; for good luck.</p><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> Nonsense. You will seize the last point. Do you not see the swimsuit I have ready for you?</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong><br> Aaaaaah! Nooo! Anythin&#39; but thaaat!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> By my Command Spell, yadda yadda yadda.</p><hr><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong><br> Oh man, I&#39;m wearin&#39; it! This is so embarrassin&#39;!</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong><br> Oh well, I guess there&#39;s worse things I could be wearin&#39; when I go apologize to Van Gogh...</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong><br> All right, if this is what this Edoite&#39;s gotta do ta make things right, I ain&#39;t gonna back down!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Great!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Looks like we&#39;ve got a plan!</p><hr><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> All right, then let&#39;s get started right–</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Gah! What was that!?</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> Ghh... I&#39;m okay!<br> I&#39;ve toughened up a good bit since the last time!</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> I just heard a voice from the<br> giant enemy structure up ahead!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> So Van Gogh&#39;s trying to talk to us!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> What did she say!?</p><hr><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> Basically... “Stay away”!</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> Hehe, what do you say, Acting Commander?<br> Shall we just give up then?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Not on your life!</p><hr><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> That&#39;s what I thought!</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> ...Incidentally, the voice was only the beginning. We&#39;ve also got a ton of enemies, including some that look kind of like torpedoes, headed straight for us!</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> I don&#39;t think our autonomous defenses will be able to handle them all! Can we fend them off ourselves!?</p><p><strong>Lambda:</strong><br> Oh please, who do you think we are? This will be the perfect little warm-up right before the big show.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Oh yes. I was just getting a bit tired of only throwing torpedoes around anyway, so I&#39;ll gladly take this opportunity to show what my blade can do in close-quarters combat.</p><p><strong>Fran:</strong><br> I guess I don&#39;t mind getting a little hot!</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I can hear Lady Yang Guifei&#39;s voice.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> She&#39;s calling to me.<br> She wants to save me. I can tell.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> And if she wants to save me, I&#39;m sure everyone else does too. Master... Fran...

It feels like the enemy isn&#39;t just trying to attack us!</p><p><strong>Nemo Professor:</strong><br> That&#39;s correct. Half of these warheads consist of A-rank explosives, while the other half are made up of resources and healing spells.</p><p><strong>Nemo Professor:</strong><br> If they weren&#39;t healing us at the same time they&#39;re hitting us, we might have already be just so much flotsam!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> These attacks are that powerful? Yikes.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Damn, I wish I could see them for myself...</p><hr><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> Captain! This has to be Goghie&#39;s doing!</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Right!

Would you prefer “Clytie”?</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> Van Gogh is fine! I still have Vincent van Gogh&#39;s talent and can paint the same paintings he did, so I think it suits me fine!</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> I might still end up going through the occasional identity crisis in the future...</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> But in general, I&#39;m looking forward to being a Greek girl who uses “Van Gogh” as a pseudonym!</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong><br> A pseudonym, huh? I&#39;m all for it. Go ahead an&#39; call yourself whatever you like. Say, once we get back ta Chaldea, how&#39;d ya like to collaborate?</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> Ooh, that sounds amazing!

Sorry about that...<br> Okay, let me explain.</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> This final area has lots of resources just floating around from the wreckage of my giant spirit body.</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> So, if we combine those resources with the surplus we already have on the ship...</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> ...the Nautilus can transform them into pure magical energy and make them into a Holy Grail.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Really!? Is that even possible!?</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> Ehehe. Luckily, there&#39;s so much magical energy here that I can easily meet the conditions to make a Holy Grail just by altering Void Space a little.</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> Once we have the Holy Grail, we can use it to restore Void Space back to how it used to be no problem. We can even give it new protections that&#39;ll make it harder to be invaded again.</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> After that, the Nautilus can easily emerge from its Zero Sail, and Chaldea can collect the rest of the Holy Grail.</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> Ehehe, and just like that, everyone&#39;s happy.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> There you have it. That should work, right, Professor?</p><p><strong>Nemo Professor:</strong><br> Hmm. The idea of using a powerful artifact like a Holy Grail as casually as any other item is pretty humbling, but it does definitely seem possible.</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> If you like, I could do it right now...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> That easy, huh?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Why not? Go for it.</p><hr><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> Ehehe, okay then, here goes...</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> ...Um, maybe you could all talk about something else while I do this?

Can&#39;t have &#39;em revoltin&#39; on us again, can we?</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong><br> Haha, sorry about that... Wait, hold up a sec. I don&#39;t remember doin&#39; anything to mess them up...</p><p><strong>Nemo Nurse:</strong><br> I hate to say it, but I think this just goes to show how much weaker we Nemos were deep down than we realized.</p><p><strong>Nemo Professor:</strong><br> I don&#39;t buy that. We had to scrutinize ourself intensely to split up like this in the first place, after all. I think it has to be a bug in the Memory Partition process.</p><p><strong>Nemo Engineer:</strong><br> I dunno; Captain can be kind of an imbecile sometimes. What do you think, Baker?</p><p><strong>Nemo Baker:</strong><br> Gosh, I don&#39;t know. It&#39;s hard to say...</p><p><strong>Nemo Engineer:</strong><br> Eesh.

What happened afterward?</p><hr><p><strong>Fran:</strong><br> Oh. Van Gogh used another Noble Phantasm.<br> It was all “Nyroom, dun dun dun, kablam!”</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Van Gogh&#39;s second Noble Phantasm, huh? Sounds awesome.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I wish I could&#39;ve seen it.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes, I would have liked to see what kind of picture it was, too.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Oh! Maybe it was Le Père Tanguy? The one she used back when she saved our lives the first time?</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> Huh? Le Père Tanguy?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Oh, whoops. Sorry for distracting you.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Are you able to talk while doing that?</p><hr><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> Oh, yes, talking should be fine... Anyway, I actually can&#39;t use that Noble Phantasm.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Huh?</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> I was relatively mentally stable when I painted that picture, so those on the other side were never really interested in it...</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> As Clytie van Gogh, the only Noble Phantasms I have are De Sterrennacht and Het Gele Huis...</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> I can still paint the picture though. But...why did we start talking about Tanguy, anyway?</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> Well, anyway, while we were talking, ehehe, I just about finished the Holy Grail.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Wow, that really was quick and easy.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I think the first one who brought up Tanguy was</p><hr><p><strong>C：???:</strong><br> As it happens, I actually do remember what happened when Van Gogh used her Noble Phantasm...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Huh?</p><hr><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Xiang Yu?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Did you just attack Yang Guifei?</p><hr><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> ...So, you tried to end me in a single blow, huh, Hegemon-King?</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> Too bad it didn&#39;t work♪ Even your insanely sharp blade couldn&#39;t cut me off from the chaos of the stars.</p><p><strong>Xiang Yu:</strong><br> Curse you...ruin of nations...</p><p><strong>Xiang Yu:</strong><br> Master, I&#39;m afraid...the rest is up...to you...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> X-Xiang Yu!?</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> Lady Yang Guifei!? What are you doing...?</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> Thanks for the Holy Grail, Goghie!<br> I&#39;ll be taking this now, okay?</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> Ah! S-stop...!</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> Ugh... I-it burns...!</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> ...I don&#39;t want to hurt you if I don&#39;t have to. We&#39;re both Foreigners, and besides, I like you. So...just stay back.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> What&#39;s the meaning of this, Yang Guifei?</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Stop. Put down the Holy Grail. Right now.</p><p><strong>Lambda:</strong><br> What she said. Otherwise, I&#39;ll fill you so full of holes you&#39;ll be emptier than the Void Sea.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> C-come on, Yu-Yu, cut it out!<br> Tell me this is just some kind of victory prank!</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> Nnn, I&#39;m afraid it&#39;s nothing like that, Batty. In fact, it might be an especially bad ending for you.</p><p><strong>Lambda:</strong><br> Don&#39;t you ignore me!</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Don&#39;t worry, Master! I&#39;ll put an end to this!</p><p><strong>Lambda &amp; Raikou:</strong><br> Ghh!?</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> I know I might not look like it,<br> but I&#39;m actually a pretty hard worker.</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> And I&#39;ve been working eeextra hard studying your weaknesses to make sure none of you could stop me here. So I don&#39;t think anything you try will work.</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> Now, let&#39;s try this again, Master.<br> I&#39;m going to neutralize you now, okay♪</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> ...Juuust kidding.</p><p><strong>Nemo Marine:</strong><br> Ah... Ah... Ah...</p><p><strong>Nemo Marine:</strong><br> Burn them...all...</p><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> Eeek! What are you doing, Marine!?<br> Aah! Get away from me!!!</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Byaaaaaah! Quit it! Let go of me! Yameteee!</p><p><strong>Lambda:</strong><br> Hey! Watch where you&#39;re grabbing me! I&#39;m a star, you–Huh!? I can&#39;t liquify my body!?</p><p><strong>Nemo Baker:</strong><br> Iä...I...ä...</p><p><strong>Nemo Engineer:</strong><br> Baker!? Not you too!?<br> What&#39;s wrong with her, Professor!?</p><p><strong>Nemo Professor:</strong><br> I don&#39;t know! She and the marines are all completely out of control! Captain, I think it&#39;s time to use your root-level authority!</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> That&#39;s not working either!<br> What did you do, Yang Guifei!?</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> I gave out little...gifts and made sure all my bases were covered while I waited for all of you to let your guard down.</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> So now that it&#39;s the final stage, and I&#39;m positively overflowing with eldritch power, I decided it was finally time to make my move!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> What kind of power did you say you had?</p><hr><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> Hehehe, eldritch, of course.<br> Can&#39;t you feel it all around me?</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Now you&#39;re just being ridiculous...</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> Oh, but I&#39;m not. I&#39;m veeery serious♪</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> Eldritch power is an indescribable, incredibly evil power that comes straight from the outer universe.</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> It&#39;s often tied directly to madness, and is used by the evil gods to bring great disaster upon you all.</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> Say, for example, making the summoning system bug out and connect directly to the Throne♪</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> Oh, I&#39;m sorry, I guess I don&#39;t sound very serious right now, do I? Let me fix that.</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> Hehehe. Good day to you all once again,<br> crew of the Nautilus.</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> Though I bear you no ill will, I&#39;m afraid my ultimate goals and your continued existence are mutually exclusive.</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> So I must be your enemy now.</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> Th...this is all my fault...</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> If I hadn&#39;t used De Sterrennacht...then Lady Yang Guifei would never have allied with an evil god!</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> Oh, no, no, Lady Van Gogh. Touching though your concern is, it is laughably inaccurate.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Does that mean...you&#39;ve been betraying<br> us from the very start!?</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> Obviously. I, too, am a Foreigner who heard the call and came here through the Throne.</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> Deeper. Deeper. Further. Further... Hehehe.</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> Th-that can&#39;t be right! The evil god that was haunting me only had me call out to gods from the same alliance!</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> I know it reached Hokusai, but none of the others made so much as a peep!</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> Yes, that&#39;s true. But fortunately, my beloved emperor has more than the necessary connections to vacate a seat for me.</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> And since that accursed being seems to be none the wiser this time, my beloved emperor ordered me to take advantage of this vacated seat to...let my hair down, so to speak.</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> So I made my way to the Throne and answered the summon just as planned.</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> Isn&#39;t that right, Emperor?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Huh? Master...?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> Hehe, hehehe. I swear, Emperor, you played it so cool you had me a bit worried at times.</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> Still, even knowing you were just playing around, it has been the thrill of a lifetime to follow your orders...</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> At any rate, I now have the Holy Grail, just as we planned. What would you have me do with it, my beloved Emperor?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> Ahh, yes, I see, I see.</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> So you wish the festivities to continue? For even more feverish dancing than ever before?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Senpai!? What are you saying!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> (I can&#39;t move!)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> (I can&#39;t say anything!)</p><hr><p><strong>Fran:</strong><br> Don&#39;t listen, Mash.</p><p><strong>Fran:</strong><br> She&#39;s mad.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Huh? Wha–</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Now I see. In her delirium, she&#39;s completely given in to the voices in her head.</p><p><strong>Lambda:</strong><br> You&#39;re one to talk... Fujimaru, just say<br> the word, and I&#39;ll kill her right here and now.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Wait! Stop! Come on, Yu-Yu, snap out of iiit!!!</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> This doesn&#39;t make sense... I could have sworn you were telling the truth when you made your summoning pledge!</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> Oh? As I recall, I said something along these lines:</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> I am aware that I, too, am a defender of humanity, and I also have no desire for revenge.</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> And of course, since my beloved emperor has no desire to see humanity destroyed, I will gladly ignore the temptations of other gods and devote myself wholly to [♂ him /♀️ her].</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> To that end, I am even prepared to be bound with a Command Spell.</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> However, Emperor...if you were to wish for depravity or destruction, I would not hesitate to enact your will.</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> Now, tell me, my beloved emperor!<br> What is your command!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Depravity...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Destruction...</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Senpai!?</p><p><strong>Fran:</strong><br> Uh, there. No more cursed doll.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Ah!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I can talk again!</p><hr><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> Yes! Yes! Yes! Your wish is my command,<br> my beloved Emperor!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Forget what I just said! Just forget it!</p><hr><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> Holy Grail! My Emperor desires feverish festivities! A banquet of depravity and destruction!</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> I therefore summon the dark dancers of the stars, the foul Foreigners who have long been lurking at the edge of the abyss!</p><p><strong>Nemo Professor:</strong><br> Huh!? The Heroic Spirit summoning system just activated by itself!</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong><br> What? Huh!? Where did I just get summoned!?</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong><br> Oh, Master! If you&#39;re here,<br> does that mean I&#39;m on the Nautilus!?</p><p><strong>Heroine XX:</strong><br> What&#39;s this!? It seems Mysterious Heroine XX has picked up the scent of a hidden extra mission! Overtime pay, here I come!</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> Hm? I could have sworn I summoned a third Servant as well...but, the maidens gathered here will suffice.</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> Now, allow me to infuse you with eldritch power!!!</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong><br> Aaaaaah!</p><p><strong>Heroine XX:</strong><br> Whoa! What kind of craziness have<br> I gotten myself into now!?</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong><br> Gaaaaaah! Not me too!?</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> Hwaaaaaa!?</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong><br> I&#39;m sorry, Master...<br> I really am a bad girl...</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong><br> Last night&#39;s drawing wasn&#39;t enough.<br> Not nearly enough...</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong><br> ...Hehe, hehehe...<br> Ahh, whatever am I going to do?</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong><br> Now that I&#39;m a bad girl, I think I&#39;ll take out all my frustration at being left home alone on you!</p><p><strong>Heroine XX:</strong><br> Master... I&#39;ve only been pretending to depend on your handouts... The truth is, I&#39;ve been squirreling money away...</p><p><strong>Heroine XX:</strong><br> I&#39;ve been studying hard in between missions...and making solid, boring investments in space stocks, space finance, and space cryptocurrency...</p><p><strong>Heroine XX:</strong><br> All so that...I can eventually make my way out of this seemingly endless hell of working for the space man...and enjoy something like retirement...in my old age...</p><p><strong>Heroine XX:</strong><br> I ask of you: Are you my [♂ fiancé /♀️ fiancée]? If you are not...<br> then you have no right to mess with my side gigs!</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong><br> ...So, uh, y&#39;know...</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong><br> Sorry about this, Master...</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong><br> Once I saw Oei kickin&#39; up a storm, I couldn&#39;t help but wanna get in on the action myself!</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong><br> I wanna take all my ink and dump it out into the Void Sea, then paint ta my heart&#39;s content! You can gimme that much, right!?</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> I... I...</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> Behold, Emperor!<br> The dancers you requested are here and ready!</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> All the embodiments of evil you could ask for! The spine-tingling charms of the inner palace right before your eyes!</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> Now, we will hold a festival of indescribable madness! We will sing, dance, shoot, kill, and fight for control of the Void Sea! The winner will earn the right to rule over the next era on Earth!</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> That&#39;s right! The Great Foreigner Festival Void Sea Scramble you asked for is finally about to begin!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Are you listening!? I never asked for this!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> You&#39;ve entirely stopped listening to me, haven&#39;t you?</p><hr><p><strong>Lambda:</strong><br> It&#39;s not that! She was never listening to you in the first place! We just never noticed since she&#39;s so damn smart!</p><p><strong>Lambda:</strong><br> On the surface, she pretended to help us, but on the inside, she&#39;s as insane and conspiratorial as Kiyohime and Raikou!</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> That was uncalled for! I&#39;m just a little more motherly in my other Spirit Origin, that&#39;s all!</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> It looks like you Heroic Spirits are saying something, but I&#39;m afraid I have no idea what it is♪</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> Now, come, dancers! Claim your territories, paint the sea with your preferred color, and partake in territorial warfare while we wait for our emperor to grace us with [♂ his /♀️ her] presence!</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> The winner shall take all, both for the seas and the emperor! Now, let us be on our way! Ahahahaha!!!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> (Speechless)</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> (Agape)</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> (Frozen in place)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Huh?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> You&#39;re not going with them, Van Gogh?</p><hr><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> I-I&#39;m sorry.<br> That kind of party isn&#39;t really my thing...</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> ...Are you still sane, Van Gogh? Even though you&#39;re in your final form?</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> Yes... Ehehe, though now I feel a little left out...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> But how? The eldritch power clearly made all the others lose their minds.</p><p><strong>Nemo Professor:</strong><br> Hmm. I really don&#39;t like forming hypotheses about such bizarre powers, but...</p><p><strong>Nemo Professor:</strong><br> ...maybe when we physically defeated her evil god&#39;s terminal and cut off her link, the eldritch power targeting her didn&#39;t take root?</p><p><strong>Fran:</strong><br> Look. I just threw away all the Nemo Series&#39; dolls.</p><p><strong>Nemo Marine:</strong><br> ...Huh? What were we just doing?</p><p><strong>Nemo Baker:</strong><br> Ngh, my head hurts... Maybe my oven has a gas leak?</p><p><strong>Nemo Engineer:</strong><br> Geez, you got one of those dolls too, Baker?<br> No wonder you were actin&#39; so weird.</p><p><strong>Nemo Nurse:</strong><br> So we were infected with Mental Corruption we somehow couldn&#39;t notice even with our Memory Partition... This eldritch power is truly frightening.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> ...So, I know things are kind of weird right now, but...</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> This IS an existential crisis for humanity, right?<br> I&#39;m not just imagining things am I?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> It definitely is.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Yup, this is a real doozy.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It looks like we&#39;ll need to begin a second operation, Acting Commander!</p><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> Indeed. And fortunately, Fran has already shown us a path to victory.</p><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> All we need do is remove the terminals feeding the Foreigners eldritch power from the Outer Gods, and it should quell their rampage.</p><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> Once they have come to their senses, even if only for a moment, we should then be able to restrain them.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Say, you were really freaking out earlier, weren&#39;t you, Goddess?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Thanks for breaking it down, Goddess. Not scared anymore then?</p><hr><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> ...Never mention that again. Now, Van Gogh, let me<br> ask you this: Can you still use De Sterrennacht?</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> Huh!? Wh-why do you ask?</p><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> That Noble Phantasm can transform Foreigners&#39; Spirit Origins, can it not?</p><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> Then could you not use it only to extract the Outer Gods&#39; terminals from the Foreigners, thereby severing their link?</p><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> Of course, if that degree of control is beyond your ability, then it would be far too risky to attempt...</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> ...I&#39;ll do it! I know I can do it!</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> Now that I&#39;m free of that evil god&#39;s tentacles, I&#39;ll do whatever it takes to be more helpful, Master!</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> Besides, if I can bring everyone back...ehehe, that would be awesome... I&#39;ve always wanted to be the MVP...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You&#39;re so cool, Goghie!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> You&#39;re so cute, Goghie!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It looks like Van Gogh staying behind may just be the silver lining we need, Senpai!</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Nnn, I guess that just leaves one big question. I&#39;m pretty sure the Chaldea Foreigners will be okay once we knock the crazy outta them...</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> But what about Yu-Yu?<br> It seemed like her madness ran pretty deep...</p><p><strong>Lambda:</strong><br> We should kill her.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> I agree. But–</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Sorry, but no.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I&#39;m not willing to do that.</p><hr><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> I knew it. You&#39;re so kind, Master.<br> Almost to a fault...</p><p><strong>Lambda:</strong><br> So this isn&#39;t over yet, huh... Oh, fine. Just be warned that I&#39;m using the pool for at least three days straight once we get back to Chaldea.</p><p><strong>S：???:</strong><br> Excuse me...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Huh?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Who&#39;s there?</p><hr><p><strong>Wu Zetian:</strong><br> It seems in all the commotion, I was summoned along with the others.</p><p><strong>Wu Zetian:</strong><br> I tried to announce my presence, though it fell on deaf ears amidst those Foreigners&#39; obnoxious ravings. Not one of you acknowledged my presence.</p><p><strong>Wu Zetian:</strong><br> Kehe, would it be all right if<br> I cried for a bit, Master?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I-I&#39;m sorry for overlooking you...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I swear I didn&#39;t see you until now...</p><hr><p><strong>Wu Zetian:</strong><br> That does nothing to make me feel better! (Sniff...)</p><p><strong>Wu Zetian:</strong><br> Wait, no! You&#39;re insolent fools who should be begging forgiveness for failing to notice my imperial presence! I should carve my crest into your hides for this!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Hang on...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I think this might be just what we need to get us out of this new eldritch nightmare, Acting Commander!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Wu Zetian is from Tang dynasty China, and she&#39;s the grandmother of Emperor Xuanzong, the same emperor Yang Guifei calls her beloved!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> With that kind of connection, I think we might be able to restore Yang Guifei to her senses as well!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Please help us, Nite-Brite!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> We need your help, Nite-Brite!</p><hr><p><strong>Wu Zetian:</strong><br> Oh!? So you would atone for ignoring me by thrusting me into the spotlight now!? Very well, I shall forgive your transgression just this once! Go on then, make the spotlight even brighter!</p><p><strong>Wu Zetian:</strong><br> That aside, it sounds as though the tentacle girl who summoned us here is the one called Yang Yuhuan I have been hearing about as of late?</p><p><strong>Wu Zetian:</strong><br> Then, does that mean the beloved emperor she speaks of is that Li Longji brat?</p><p><strong>Wu Zetian:</strong><br> Oh ho hooo, interesting. Then it would seem the time has come to let my dark, sadistic side run free once more!</p><p><strong>Wu Zetian:</strong><br> Come, ferryman, let us set off at once! I shall turn these Foreigners&#39; seas into an ocean of poison and blood! Keh heh heh!</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> I could do without the poison and blood part,<br> but it sounds good apart from that.<br> Let&#39;s get going, Fujimaru!</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> We have to snap them back to their<br> senses before it&#39;s too late!</p><p><strong>Xiang Yu:</strong><br> My calculations never predicted that Wu Zetian would come to our aid... Now it just remains to be seen if this turn of events bodes well or ill...</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Aah! Sorry, Xiang Yu, I forgot! Come on, Professor and Nurse! We need to get him back up and running!</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Once we&#39;re done with that...I&#39;ll join the fight, too!</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Now that all of humanity is at stake, it&#39;s time for our last stand! I&#39;ll do whatever it takes to stop it! I&#39;ll even use the protection of the sea that dwells within me for hand-to-hand combat!</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Scáthach-Skadi... Osakabehime... Xiang Yu... Van Gogh... All of you! This will be our last, most difficult battle yet, but I know we can win together!</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> Nemo...!</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> Ehehe, I&#39;m so happy we&#39;ll get to fight together!</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> Oh, and since Lady Yang Guifei obviously isn&#39;t here to project visuals we can see onto void entities anymore, I&#39;ll do my best to take her place...</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> I&#39;ll also diffuse the rainbow-colored arche so we can perceive it safely and make the bridge a little more cheerful, since, ehehe, we&#39;ll need all the mental solace we can get...</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> After all, from here on, we&#39;ll be facing something completely different from the logically mad void world we&#39;ve seen so far... Now, it&#39;s a void full of otherworldly malice and outer space madness...</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> So I have to hide it with rainbows and caricatures...or else, we&#39;ll all go mad ourselves in an instant... Ehehe.</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> Oh, and if you happen to notice any imperceptible hostility while I&#39;m cautiously painting...ehehe, please make sure to close your eyes, okay?</p><h2 id="idle-talk-4" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#idle-talk-4" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Idle Talk 4</h2><p><strong>A：Sion:</strong><br> A mediator?

Keep going.</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong><br> Well, Lady Hokusai&#39;s divinity, and the divinity in direct opposition to it...</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong><br> ...are actually thought to be siblings.</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong><br> What&#39;s more, these siblings, who are said to get along about as well as cats and dogs, actually have a third sibling deity.</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong><br> And it is the third, youngest sibling, who is thought to have some manner of connection to Mars.</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong><br> To be perfectly honest, I know next to nothing about this youngest sibling; I do not even know anything about their possible disposition.</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong><br> However, assuming these siblings call a certain dim green binary star home, and if my inner stars&#39; guiding light is any indication...</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong><br> ...I believe that this mysterious third sibling may be planning to mediate the disputes between the disparate factions of the outer universe.</p><p><strong>B：Sion:</strong><br> Hmm.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> True, if these outer universe gods stopped fighting each other and teamed up to fight us, we&#39;d be royally screwed.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Hmm...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> But nah, thinking about it some more, I&#39;m pretty sure we don&#39;t have anything to worry about.</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong><br> Oh? And why is that?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Because like you said, not even Foreigners can escape the constraints that come with being Servants.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> So once they encounter Fujimaru, they won&#39;t be able to help but fall for [♂ his /♀️ her] charms.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> [♂ He&#39;s /♀️ She&#39;s] faced everything from irredeemable villains<br> and crazed Berserkers to demons and evil gods,<br> and has formed a contract with every one of them.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> I get it, too. Being an extraordinary hero makes you appreciate even more how incredible it is for a completely ordinary person like [♂ him /♀️ her] to fight against<br> impossible odds.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> In fact, [♂ his /♀️ her] doing so might even be the best example<br> of the heights humanity as a whole can strive for.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> So I&#39;m pretty sure that once this mediator gets to<br> know Fujimaru, they&#39;ll fall for [♂ his /♀️ her] charms,<br> form a contract of their own...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> ...then turn around and convince the rest of the Foreigner army to follow their lead.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Which means this invasion attempt is basically already a failure. Wouldn&#39;t you agree, Caster Gilles de Rais?</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong><br> Hohohohoho! You&#39;ve certainly got me there!</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong><br> What a horrifically hopeful conclusion! Why, it made the very hairs on my heart stand on end!</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong><br> Indeed, you&#39;re correct! No matter what manner of alliance this wicked god sibling mediator attempts to form...</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong><br> ...or even if one of the evil gods from the constellation Piscis Austrinus should take advantage of the mediator&#39;s blind spot and attempt to cause Armageddon...</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong><br> ...our Master will no doubt find a way to bring them all back peacefully, and [♂ his /♀️ her] exploits in doing so<br> will be spoken of forever more!</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong><br> Ahh, this has truly been a delightful discussion; it has been as bright and bubbly as my beloved golden mead.</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong><br> Mmm, I&#39;m feeling inspired now. I think I shall return to my workshop and begin work on a new creation.</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong><br> Specifically, I think it is time I made new Jeannes and Foreigners to go with Gilles Doll Rais before the new children arrive...</p><p><strong>B：Sion:</strong><br> ...So, did we just go through all that only to loop back around to, “We do not actually have to do anything”?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Probably? But hey, at least we ought to have put the dreamer&#39;s mind at ease about Foreigners.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> And if that&#39;s the part we were meant to play in all this, then we did our job.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> And really, let&#39;s not forget all the exposition we heard here is just Marshal Gilles being delusional, as ever.</p><p><strong>Voyager:</strong><br> Bonsoir.<br> Nice night, huh?</p><p><strong>A：Sion:</strong><br> Oh, speak of the Foreigner.<br> What is it, Voyager?</p><p><strong>Voyager:</strong><br> You sounded like you were talking about something fun.<br> Was it outer space?</p><p><strong>B：Sion:</strong><br> Yes, that is right. We were discussing the bottom of a universe that is also an unfathomable abyss.</p><p><strong>B：Sion:</strong><br> While we should treat Marshal Gilles&#39;s exposition as the delusion that it is, that is merely a matter of camera angles.</p><p><strong>B：Sion:</strong><br> The fact is, we learned a lot from what he had to say.</p><p><strong>B：Sion:</strong><br> After all, while what he said is certainly fantastical, it is by no means impossible.</p><p><strong>B：Sion:</strong><br> There very well could be another universe of the kind he posited.</p><p><strong>Voyager:</strong><br> Uh-huh. The universe is big.<br> I&#39;m sure we don&#39;t know everything about it.</p><p><strong>Voyager:</strong><br> You know, I felt like someone was calling me too. Someone from a distant star, far, far away...</p><p><strong>Erice:</strong><br> There you are!<br> What do you think you&#39;re doing here, Voyager?</p><p><strong>Erice:</strong><br> Do you have any idea how worried I was after you just suddenly floated away like that!?</p><p><strong>Voyager:</strong><br> Do you want to go near Point Nemo too, Erice? To the rainbow sea, and the gods&#39; banquet?</p><p><strong>Erice:</strong><br> The gods&#39; banquet? I don&#39;t know what kind of signals you&#39;ve been picking up, but knock it off. Now come on, we need to go back and finish our tokoroten cooking battle!</p><p><strong>Erice:</strong><br> Sorry Voyager was bothering you, Sion! Good night!</p><p><strong>Voyager:</strong><br> But I want to go to the great Foreigner festival too. Aah, wait, Ericeee...</p><p><strong>Erice:</strong><br> Oh, hell no. We both know you&#39;re tired anyway.<br> Besides, you&#39;re just an honorary Foreigner, right?</p><p><strong>Erice:</strong><br> In any case, there&#39;s something inappropri–Ahem, I mean, I have a reeeally bad feeling about this!</p><p><strong>A：Sion:</strong><br> Hmm. Maybe it is a bad sign that a Foreigner like Voyager who is so inarguably from our world is also being influenced by whatever is going on here?</p><p><strong>A：Sion:</strong><br> Oh well!

I&#39;m such a baka! I should&#39;ve known I could never be friends with a genuine princess like you!</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> But as embarrassing as it is to realize our whole nakama thing was a sham, there&#39;s still one thing I know from spending all that time with you!</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> The way you smiled whenever we ate lychees, or when you were playing with the marines?</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> I&#39;m positive that was the real Yu-Yu!</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> So even if they might be a little broken, there&#39;s no way my Ma-chan will let any Servant with redeeming qualities like that get away!</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> A-and, um...that of course goes for me, too...</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Okay, that&#39;s all I had to say!<br> Get her, Ma-chan!!!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> (That&#39;s one way to show you care, Batty!)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> (That&#39;s one way to hide your embarrassment, Batty!)</p><hr><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> ...What are you talking about?<br> I don&#39;t...understand...</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> After all...my beloved emperor was sealed away...in the far reaches of Fomalhaut...

That is why I created hellfire from your favorite star while I awaited your arrival!</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> Now, I will use this frail vessel to kindle a flame on the seventh night of the seventh month, just like in “The Palace of Eternal Life”!</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> Oh, to be lovebirds in the sky, entwined branches on the earth, and to never again be separated from one another!</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> I will become one with the emperor. Now, to make that dream come true, I shall become a living flame to consume this world, and all other worlds beyond the stars!!!</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> Imperial edict. The Taoist nun of Penglai, Yang Taizhen, declares–</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Uh-oh! Her Noble Phantasm is about<br> to engulf the entire sea!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Can you do this, Van Gogh!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Can you still fight, Van Gogh!?</p><hr><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> Ehehehehe! Of course!</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> Lady Yang Guifei, you recognized me as one of your class... You said you didn&#39;t want to hurt me. That you even liked me!</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> I can&#39;t imagine it was all an act, but even if it was...I still need to pay you back for your kindness. That&#39;s what it means to be human, right!?</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> And since neither me, nor Nemo,<br> nor Master are your emperor...</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> ...I&#39;m going to show you what it&#39;s like to have your proposal met with “Nooit, neen, nimmer”! Ehehe!</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> Ah, ah, ah–</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> Aaaaaah! Why?

I was afraid of this!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> What&#39;s wrong, Van Gogh!?</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> Now I know why something felt off when I used my Noble Phantasm on Lady Yang Guifei before!</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> I just ran a deep scan on her Foreigner Spirit Origin, and almost ninety percent of its capacity is occupied by the evil god&#39;s terminal!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> N-ninety percent!?</p><hr><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> Yes... So if you try to tear the two apart, her Spirit Origin won&#39;t survive!</p><p><strong>Xiang Yu:</strong><br> According to my database, in life, Yang Yuhuan had no inclination for madness that would make her an attractive target for an outer universe divinity.</p><p><strong>Xiang Yu:</strong><br> However, we cannot ignore the fact that it also says her body went missing after her death.</p><p><strong>Xiang Yu:</strong><br> As this took place in the past, I cannot use my prognosticative abilities to say for certain, but to speculate on what may have happened...</p><p><strong>Xiang Yu:</strong><br> I would guess that an outer universe faction caught wind of her keen mind and devout love for her emperor, and used her body as the base upon which to build the Heroic Spirit we see now.</p><p><strong>Xiang Yu:</strong><br> As a result, most of her Spirit Origin is flooded with reverence for the outer universe, despite having no connection to it in her lifetime...</p><p><strong>Xiang Yu:</strong><br> It is truly a tragedy. All Yang ever wanted was to make Bai Juyi&#39;s poem a reality...</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> So these evil gods have been using her, toying with her, all for their own twisted ends...</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> That&#39;s just like what they did to me!<br> Lady Yang Guifei!</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> Why!? Why do you look so sad, my beloved emperor!? All I want is to serve you faithfully!</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> Ahh... It seems my spirit body has met its end...</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> Does this mean...you no longer have need of me?</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> Hehehe... As much as it pains me, if you wish for me to disappear...then so be it...</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> Ah! No! Don&#39;t!</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> Huh?</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Lightning deployment team here.<br> Do you read me, Van Gogh?</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> With some help from Nemo Nurse, we created a torpedo loaded with a liberation spell, similar to what we did in our final battle against you. I just fired it!</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Oh, I&#39;m also told it includes a binding spell. Yang Guifei should no longer be able to move!</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> Ghh! Wh-what is this?</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> So she&#39;s still trying to fight back!? The impudence! What are the rest of you waiting for!? Off you go, hurry along!</p><p><strong>Lambda:</strong><br> Oh shut up! We&#39;re here now, aren&#39;t we!?<br> All right, you two, get going!</p><p><strong>Fran:</strong><br> Hi ho, Van Gogh.</p><p><strong>Wu Zetian:</strong><br> I have come, too! Keh heh heh!</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> Fran? Wait...<br> What about your swimsuit, Lady Wu Zetian!?</p><p><strong>Wu Zetian:</strong><br> Hmph. I commanded Scáthach-Skadi to hurry and fashion me an appropriate outfit, but she said she did not have the time.</p><p><strong>Wu Zetian:</strong><br> So instead, I had her slap one of those void chip whatsits directly onto my Spirit Origin. It worked, but my spirit form is all messed up, so I am in no shape to aid in battle.</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> Th-that sounds so amaz–I mean, painful...<br> Why did you go to such lengths, Lady Wu?</p><p><strong>Wu Zetian:</strong><br> Lady Wu? How uncouth! You may address me either<br> as “Your Imperial Highness,” or “Nite-Brite.”</p><p><strong>Wu Zetian:</strong><br> As for why I went to such lengths, well, it is only right that I snuff out a fire that came from my country, no?</p><p><strong>Wu Zetian:</strong><br> At any rate! You there, Yang Yuhuan! You may do so while knocking your knees together if you wish, but you WILL listen to me!</p><p><strong>Wu Zetian:</strong><br> I am Wu Zetian, also known as Holy Empress Zetian, and I am your grandmother-in-law! Do not even think of claiming you haven&#39;t heard of me!</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> ...!!!</p><p><strong>Wu Zetian:</strong><br> I must say, it is quite an odd twist of fate that we should meet in a strange and foreign land like this a thousand years after our deaths, but never mind that now.</p><p><strong>Wu Zetian:</strong><br> Suffice to say, I know all about how my Zhou dynasty was rolled back in favor of Tang, only for the entire nation to be thrown into chaos because he chose you for his consort, you temptress!</p><p><strong>Wu Zetian:</strong><br> Oh yes, I have quite the bone to pick with both you and your beloved emperor! Perhaps I&#39;ll make you pay for your crimes with one of my wine barrel executions!</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> Eek...!!!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Well, at least she&#39;s responding!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Uh, I don&#39;t think you need to go quite that far!</p><hr><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> Um, Lady Nite-Brite, maybe threatening her isn&#39;t the best way to go here...</p><p><strong>Wu Zetian:</strong><br> “Lady Nite-Brite”? That does not sound right,<br> either... Eh, no matter. Van Gogh, was it?<br> Lend me your Noble Phantasm for a moment!</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> Huh!? Is that even possible...?</p><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> Goddess here. Ordinarily, it would not be, but thanks to a backdoor in the void chip, we can indeed link your and Wu Zetian&#39;s Spirit Origins now.</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> B-b-but, we&#39;ve only just met,<br> and that sounds so...intimate...</p><p><strong>Wu Zetian:</strong><br> Wh-what in the world are you talking about!? This will<br> be a purely tactical collaboration, nothing more!</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> But, won&#39;t connecting to a Foreigner&#39;s Spirit Origin drive you mad?</p><p><strong>Wu Zetian:</strong><br> That is where this electric girl comes in!<br> Trust me, I have thought of everything!</p><p><strong>Fran:</strong><br> I&#39;m a monster. I can handle fear and madness.</p><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> There you have it. We will connect both of you in tandem, with Fran acting as an intermediary. Now hurry up, before the binding spell fades!</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> But, um, are you going to do something mean to her...?</p><p><strong>Wu Zetian:</strong><br> Enough! I wanted to, believe me, but Master was dead set against it! Worry not! Loath though I am to enact it, I do have a peaceful plan in mind!</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> G-g-g-got it!</p><p><strong>Fran:</strong><br> Connecting.</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> Gah! What happened to this Spirit Origin!? I knew this would be difficult, but this is far more painful than I expected! And laggy! Can&#39;t you stabilize the connection speed!?</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> W-w-well, no matter. I suppose this will suffice.<br> All right, here goes...!</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> Xīngyè!!!</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> Ah...</p><p><strong>Fran:</strong><br> Disconnecting.</p><p><strong>Wu Zetian:</strong><br> Phew, there we go. Keh heh heh, nailed it! First try! Just another example of how amazing I truly am!</p><p><strong>Wu Zetian:</strong><br> All right, Van Gogh, you can take her into custody.</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> Ack! L-Lady Yang Guifei!?</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> What did you do to her?</p><p><strong>Wu Zetian:</strong><br> Oh, nothing, really. I merely outfitted her Spirit Origin&#39;s primary Spiritrons with horrifically strict and complicated operating restrictions.</p><p><strong>Wu Zetian:</strong><br> If destroying her is not an option, we need merely bind her with rules. Just the sort of solution you would expect from me, no, Master?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Way to go, Nite-Brite!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> You&#39;re the best sadist empress a Master could ask for!</p><hr><p><strong>Wu Zetian:</strong><br> Keh heh heh, stop, before you make me blush! Now, as for what this Yang Yuhuan girl will be like going forward...</p><p><strong>Wu Zetian:</strong><br> Her essence will remain unchanged. Underneath her innocent exterior, she will continue to think of nothing but her beloved emperor.</p><p><strong>Wu Zetian:</strong><br> No doubt she will still wish to marry said emperor, but worry not; one of the restrictions I placed on her requires her to grow to a point where she is ready for marriage.</p><p><strong>Wu Zetian:</strong><br> She may not be as diligent as me, but she is enough of a hard worker that she should soon learn how to control herself in order to achieve that growth.</p><p><strong>Wu Zetian:</strong><br> And if, Master, you were to take advantage of this opportunity to help her truly grow as a person, so that she becomes the person she merely behaves like...</p><p><strong>Wu Zetian:</strong><br> ...perhaps in time, you may even be able to completely remove the terminal connecting her to this outer universe.</p><p><strong>Wu Zetian:</strong><br> So I suggest you think of her as a newborn babe, even more so than the three stars of Chaldea&#39;s prized lava swimming team, and raise her accordingly, with warmth and compassion.</p><p><strong>Wu Zetian:</strong><br> Of course, infants require education. If you like, I would be willing to personally teach her how to be a proper lady.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Thanks, but no thanks.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Thanks, but I think I&#39;ll pass.</p><hr><p><strong>Wu Zetian:</strong><br> Keh heh heh! No need to be so modest! Though I must say, I never would have let her off the hook so easily before. It seems being a Servant has mellowed even me out!</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> Thank you, Lady Nite-Brite!</p><p><strong>Wu Zetian:</strong><br> No need to thank me! All I ask in return is that you teach me the ways of Western painting! What a grand opportunity to further enhance my artistic prowess!</p><p><strong>Van Gogh:</strong><br> Y-yes, of course! Ehehehe, me, teaching an empress how to paint... It&#39;s like a dream job!</p><p><strong>Fran:</strong><br> That takes care of that.<br> I&#39;m tired.

I&#39;ll still make sure to “fix” you back up properly later.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> This is a special, temporary treatment, just a little preemptive measure to pave the way for my real punishment.</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> ...You keep mentioning punishment, but I don&#39;t recall doing anything to deserve it...</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Oho, playing dumb now, are we? Sorry, no dice. I know you&#39;re clearheaded enough to know exactly what I&#39;m talking about right now.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> What you tried to do was a crime against all of humanity and Proper Human History.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> That&#39;s right. What you attempted in the name of your precious emperor was just STAGGERINGLY evil!</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> Ulp...</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> And now, it&#39;s time for your punishment:<br> a comprehensive review of your failed scheme!</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Oh yes, it&#39;s what every criminal mastermind fears more than anything! We&#39;re going to go over every last one of your failures in excruciating detail!</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> Nooo!!! Anything but that! I&#39;ll die from sheer embarrassment and regret! Can&#39;t Grandma Zetian just torture me insteaaad!?</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Hmm. While you have absolutely no right to refuse, this is still a family show, so I think I&#39;ll just subject you to tickle torture until you give in☆</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> Ahahahaha ahahahahahahaha ahahahaha ahaha!<br> Stop, stop! I&#39;ll talk, I&#39;ll taaalk!!!</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> ...First off, my Foreigner Spirit Origin was inscribed with a few...directives, I guess.</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> I had to be completely in tune with my god.</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> And I had to store up eldritch power in a way that wouldn&#39;t arouse suspicion.</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> Once I had enough eldritch power, I&#39;d be able to turn the tables in that god&#39;s favor.</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> From there, I was supposed to destroy, or steal, or do whatever I had to in order to turn the most important thing in my summoning session into experience points.</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> Those would eventually enable the god to grow stronger using me as a conduit until they reached a point where they could break their seal and make their comeback...</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> That&#39;s the very, very abridged version.</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> The divinity of the emperor I serve is basically all about burning and killing everything in sight...</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> ...but I couldn&#39;t really do that right after I was summoned, since I was still super weak.</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> Luckily, the god I was filling in for this time was a surprisingly intelligent, cold, and calculating type...</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> ...so thanks to that, I was able to excuse myself to my dear emperor for choosing to take a more...discreet approach this time.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Nooow I see. And your next step was to ingratiate yourself with Senpai, huh?</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> That&#39;s right... I can actually resist Command Spells to some degree as long as my emperor commands me to, so I wasn&#39;t especially worried about those.</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> However, the situation turned out to be much more difficult than I expected.</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> Starting with that stupid wild octopus, I couldn&#39;t have been stuck with more incompetent allies...</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> I could tell right away that it was Goghie who&#39;d called me, so I couldn&#39;t help but wish she&#39;d done a better job.</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> Though I guess I can&#39;t be too hard on her, since her plans got thrown out of whack when one of the alliance gods she was expecting just didn&#39;t show up.</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> Anyway, when I arrived, the situation basically looked like this:</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> Van Gogh, the favorite, had failed to get the two factions to work together, so that Outer God decided to go with their backup plan and have her bloom into a flower of pure madness.</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> Her rival, Hokusai, just wanted to paint all day and caper around doing whatever she pleased. I guess the idea was, if she painted enough, she&#39;d eventually get to the final manifestation?</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> And then there was me, the dark horse who snuck in amidst all that chaos. How was I supposed to win the race with the odds so stacked against me!?</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> ...But anyway, as much as the odds were stacked against me, it was still secretly a three-way race.</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> But that&#39;s not all. Regardless of who ended up winning, I couldn&#39;t afford to sink the Nautilus until it was all over.</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> It was the only place Goghie and I could store eldritch power, so it had to survive at least that long.</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> Even Lady Hokusai couldn&#39;t operate in Void<br> Space on her own, at least at first.</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> Oh, incidentally, it looks like she stretched her tentacles out all over Void Space and painted pictures even as she was destroying logic and reason left and right. Talk about a mad artist!</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> At any rate, the way things were going then, it looked like we were headed to just one big mess where nobody wins.</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> So I decided to do something to get the Nautilus back on the right track.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Hmm? Why did you do that? Couldn&#39;t you have just acted like the evil god stand-in you were and formed an alliance with Hokusai?</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> No, I couldn&#39;t. For whatever reason, Goghie&#39;s arbitration abilities only worked on gods from the existing alliance.</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> And since collecting eldritch power is a zero-sum game, nothing good would have come from multiple factions vying for it.</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> Trust me, one mastermind feasting on madness in the dead of night even as they present a peaceful façade during the day is more than enough.</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> Of course, had our divinities been part of the same alliance, the two factions could have worked together to build up eldritch power.</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> But that&#39;s just rarer than rare, like a dream team. If we could have pulled that off, this whole ordeal would probably have been over in an instant.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> I see, I see. Well I can certainly sympathize with the desire to be the only heroine (read: villain) in a given story!</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Anyway, that&#39;s why you, Van Gogh, and Hokusai each had separate schemes, huh?</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> Ahaha, I don&#39;t know if I&#39;d call it a scheme, per se...</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> While the best way to build up eldritch power is through phenomena that inspire terror and primal disgust...</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> ...the only pure human on the Nautilus was Master. Everyone else was a reputable Heroic Spirit, right?</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> So unfortunately, there was basically nothing I could do to drive them mad.</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> The Berserker&#39;s madness was practically nothing, and Goghie was racking up her own madness like crazy...</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> And of course, all the Servants were guarding Master, who would normally have been my best bet, very closely...</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> Then, just when things were looking hopeless,<br> I noticed the Nemo Marines.</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> They were Phantom Spirits, not Heroic ones, and even better, they were basically one person spread across twelve bodies. That made them the best hope I had of spreading rumors aboard the Nautilus.</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> I gave them cursed objects and called them protective charms, and over time, I cultivated madness in them based on piety and good intentions.</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> Surprisingly, it went pretty much the way I hoped. Eventually, they began spreading a new kind of madness around the ship, one quite different in nature from both Lady Hokusai&#39;s and Goghie&#39;s.</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> Meanwhile, the Nautilus had regained its ability to fight, and Goghie&#39;s settling point was just starting to come into sight, too.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Settling point? As far as I could tell from peeking in, Van Gogh seemed pretty damn dangerous right up to the end.</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> Nnn, well, I could already see the light at the end of her tunnel once Master and the captain began to show her genuine affection for her.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Ahh, gotcha. That&#39;s a pretty meta way of looking at things, but definitely an important one.</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> So, with all that in mind, how could I go about stealing Goghie&#39;s eldritch power?</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> Well, as the dark horse of this story, it only made sense for me to swoop in at the end and make off with everything.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> You know, that DOES make sense! Personally, I don&#39;t have any problem with those kinds of devious, underhanded moves☆</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> That was when I realized something else.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Well? What was it?</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> Could it be that my Master...<br> is actually my beloved emperor?</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Okay, back up!</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> It sounded like you were going about your scheme so methodically up to that point. Why&#39;d you go crazy all of a sudden?</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> Master has formed contracts with so many powerful<br> and temperamental Heroic Spirits, and [♂ he /♀️ she] doesn&#39;t<br> bat an eye at even the most crushing pressure...</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> And then there&#39;s [♂ his /♀️ her] incredible generosity, which<br> is kind of like–No, exactly like my beloved emperor! Yes!</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> ...(Sigh) Now I get it. This must be at the heart of why you&#39;re a Foreigner.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> The more eldritch power you store up, the more you become unable to tell who your own god really is...</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> D-don&#39;t talk about me like I&#39;m some kind of floozy!<br> I&#39;m nothing if not loving and loyal!</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Hey, don&#39;t worry, there&#39;s lots of Berserkers in Chaldea who say the same thing. I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll get along great.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> So, once you went off the deep end,<br> what did you do next?</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> ...Once I stole the Holy Grail, I should have just converted all of its magical energy into experience points and used them to transform into living flame...</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> But I wanted to make my beloved emperor happy so much that I, um...ended up putting on a grand Foreigner festival...</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Hmm. I kind of hate that I know exactly the feeling you&#39;re talking about...</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Anyway, you thought your festival would make your emperor happy, only for it to have the opposite effect...</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> ...and in the end, your defeat was sealed when your scary grandma-in-law gave you the verbal thrashing of your life, huh?</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> (Sigh)</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> You know, thinking about it now, wouldn&#39;t getting to serve my beloved emperor in Chaldea be my greatest wish coming true?</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Ah great, she&#39;s off in her own world now. All right, putting the memeworthy stuff aside...</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Okay. I see how it is now.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> You and I might be birds of a feather, but our plumage couldn&#39;t be more different.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> You&#39;re Chaotic-Good because one evil act spoils everything good you do, but I&#39;m Chaotic-Good because I&#39;m always pretending to be all evil while managing one good deed in the most stylish way possible.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Love drives me to make my schemes succeed,<br> and causes you to make yours fail.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Honestly, there&#39;s so much about your stance on this stuff I hate that I&#39;d sooner wipe my memories than risk learning from it.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> On the other hand, the way you Foreigners went about realizing your schemes was veeery educational!</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> As an AI, I tend to want to use my advanced intelligence to send players spiraling into chaos all at once...</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> But as an evil god, I see now that a little nudge at one&#39;s mental weaknesses is better, and that taking advantage of good-intentioned madness is also totally viable!</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> ...Of course, you don&#39;t want to go so far with it that you veer into Sessyoin territory, but it should work as long as you don&#39;t make it about your personal desires.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Then there&#39;s your “swoop in at the end and take it all for yourself” initiative, the way you handled Phantom Spirits...</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Mmm, it&#39;s all coming together! I&#39;ll have to remember all this the next time I put on a swimsuit☆</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> ...You know, it&#39;s strange. Once you said the word “swimsuit,” I went from hating you for reminding me of my failures to outright wanting to murder you...</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> Huh? Does this mean you&#39;re my sworn enemy?<br> Should I be burning you alive right now?</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Oopsies, I&#39;ve said too much☆ Oh well, I think we&#39;re about done here. Now, let&#39;s see about getting you back to Chaldea, shall we♪</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> (Sigh) Gosh, thinking back on all this...I royally screwed things up, didn&#39;t I...?</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Oho, what&#39;s this? Is your Good-natured heart only now feeling the weight of your sins?</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Well, don&#39;t you worry. Once your Spirit Origin is back to its original state, you&#39;ll be so maniacally besotted with your precious emperor again that you&#39;ll forget your guilt completely!</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Naturally, you&#39;ll forget everything that happened here at the studio, and almost all your Void Sea memories will be sealed away, too.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> From your perspective, you&#39;ll be all set to start a brand-new life at Chaldea under the impression that your precious emperor ordered you to go there. Enjoy☆</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> Now I feel like crying...</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> I feel terrible for how I treated Master...<br> Batty... Goghie...</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> They all treated me like a friend, even though this personality is just a façade...</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> But now, when I go back to Chaldea, I&#39;ll be so preoccupied with my beloved emperor off in the distant stars that I won&#39;t even notice them? That&#39;s terrible...</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> H-huh? Cut that out. This is no fun at all if you don&#39;t at least fight it! Come on!</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> ...So you feel bad about being mean to people you feel sorry for? I guess you really are good at heart, just like me.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> H-huh?</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> Yeah, I think I&#39;ve decided I actually like you!<br> We should be besties, BB!</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Wha!? No way! You said it yourself:<br> the best villains are solo acts!</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> I never thought of myself as a villain...</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> And with Lady Wu Zetian&#39;s restrictions stopping me from going berserk, and my natural diligence...maybe I can get even stronger if I work at it...?</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> In fact, maybe I can grow strong enough to save humanity or Proper Human History one day, even with this façade of a personality!</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> Ooh, I just got a great idea, BB! What if we both air all our dirty laundry and give in to the good side together!?</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> No freaking way!<br> Why would you even think that was a good idea!?</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> Hey, don&#39;t knock the aesthetics of destruction until you&#39;ve tried them. They definitely don&#39;t leave you feeling bummed out like you do after cheating and brute-forcing your way to a perfect victory.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Shut up! You don&#39;t know the first thing about me!</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Y-yikes. So this is the unbridled self-esteem and oratory skills that earned you your nation-ruining femme fatale reputation... Maybe I stared a little too long into the abyss...</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> But, unfortunately, that route you just suggested will never be made official!</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> So no, you&#39;re going to start over at Chaldea as a crazy Foreigner and build your good karma back up!</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Of course, I don&#39;t know what&#39;s going to happen when you try, and I couldn&#39;t possibly care less☆ Good luuuck☆</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> Aww, it&#39;s so cute how you pretend to be evil when you get flustered.</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> Thanks, BB! I&#39;ve learned a lot from you!</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Aaah! Quit it! You&#39;re creeping me out!<br> Don&#39;t look at me like thaaat!</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> That&#39;s all for today! BB Channel, signing ouuut!!!</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei:</strong><br> See you later, BB!</p><p></p></div><!--[--><!--]--></div><footer class="page-meta"><div class="meta-item edit-link"><a class="external-link meta-item-label" href="https://github.com/r-grandorder/tri-hermes/edit/main/src/Lostbelt/imaginary-scramble.md" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" aria-label="Help us improve this page!"><!--[--><!--]--> Help us improve this page! <span><svg class="external-link-icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewbox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path><polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg><span class="external-link-icon-sr-only">open in new window</span></span><!--[--><!--]--></a></div><div class="meta-item last-updated"><span class="meta-item-label">Last Updated: </span><!----></div><div class="meta-item contributors"><span class="meta-item-label">Contributors: </span><span class="meta-item-info"><!--[--><!--[--><span class="contributor" title="email: 59034871+Fgrandorder@users.noreply.github.com">Lib</span><!----><!--]--><!--]--></span></div></footer><!----><!--[--><!--]--></main><!--]--></div><!----><!--]--></div>
