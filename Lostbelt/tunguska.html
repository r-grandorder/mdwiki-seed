Sion Eltnam Sokaris.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Our visitor from the Atlas Academy. She who has retraced the destined route leading to doom.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Terms for using the Wandering Sea in 2017:</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> “In exchange...for the newly-issued eighth contract from Atlas,</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> you will be permitted to stay in the Wandering Sea for one year of virtual time on the bleached Earth—”</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> The proposed time will soon come. Are there to be no changes to this date?</p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/XDjbEki.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> That&#39;s right. No cuts or retakes. Please leave the contract as it is.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> I would be grateful if you would continue to take care of Chaldea.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> ...very well.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> We of the Wandering Sea, Baldanders, each recognize your genius.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> The Gate of Perpetuation, Seren, toasts to your will. The Gate of Rebirth, Ganu, casts pity on your deeds.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> The Gate of Progress, Eren, ridicules your loss. The Gate of Preservation, Genon, sympathizes with your mission.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> The Gate of Servility, Fusilka, remains ever contemptuous.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> In deference to the Atlas Academy, the Wandering Sea will overlook the preservers of the Human Order.</p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/bwzJoLo.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> —phew. Well, that was a strange way to communicate.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Man, how surprising. I never expected them to contact me.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> From the Gate of Rebirth, huh? Ganu, they said...</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Come to think of it, I have records of a Clock Tower mage becoming an apprentice around 1000 AD.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Did they assign someone from a relatively recent time period as liaison? Or is it a simple staff shortage?</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Ah, this isn&#39;t the time to worry about that. Let&#39;s get back to work!</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> TRISMEGISTUS II. Catastrophe Automation, halt. Now, show me what&#39;s falling apart today!</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> And there it is. The data&#39;s awfully cut-and-dry this time, huh?</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> The singularity&#39;s coordinates are well-measured, and the threat posed is clearly defined. 100 points!</p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/7GsJzC3.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Oh ho. The singularity came to be in January 2017, but it was established back in 1908.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> It was microscopic at first, but this past year...no, the past few days, it&#39;s ballooned in size massively.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Just like a Lostbelt. It must have experienced nearly a century&#39;s worth of time in an instant.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> If left unchecked, it&#39;ll spread all over Eurasia. Humanity will be reduced to lower animals.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Eww, that&#39;s not a peaceful end.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> We&#39;ve seen a lot of ends for mankind by now, but it&#39;s rare for humanity to be removed from the top of the food chain.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Well done, Beast IV. You truly are an Evil of Humanity.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Then we&#39;ll prepare an adequate response.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> TRISMEGISTUS II. Send an urgent communication to Chaldea&#39;s top brass.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> &quot;Juvenile Beast activity confirmed. Would like to commence suppression mission within 24 hours.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> &quot;Estimate the battle will be fought under special conditions, as with Britain&#39;s Lostbelt.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> &quot;In addition, Chaldea Base is currently undergoing year-end renovations, and is unable to make use of either Rayshift or Zero Sail.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> &quot;Onsite travel will be conducted by Storm Border. All staff members are requested to be onboard.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> &quot;Subjugation target is Chaldea&#39;s archenemy, the juvenile Beast, Tamamovitch Koyanskaya.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Now then. This is where she&#39;s been hiding since she disappeared from Britain...</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> She probably wouldn&#39;t have originally revealed her nest until both Chaldea and the Alien God were taken care of.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> But her strange behavior in Britain&#39;s Lostbelt is alarming. Her tail&#39;s in gear, literally!</p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/Ttv1BLE.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Still, that doesn&#39;t change that she&#39;s a powerful enemy. We&#39;ll need a lot to beat her...</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> This battle is an unavoidable step towards uniting Chaldea&#39;s forces against the Alien God.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Please do your utmost. All I can do is place my trust in you.</p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/cjCyt4q.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Well, TRISMEGISTUS II has given us the results this time anyway!</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> No matter what they do, Chaldea is wiped out! All my efforts this past year go up in smoke!</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Wait, cut, cut! There&#39;s no way I can share this with them, is there?</p><h2 id="section-1-beyond-the-walls-of-the-world" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1-beyond-the-walls-of-the-world" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 1: Beyond the walls of the world</h2><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/MKKyhTf.png" alt=""></p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/KzAyFPD.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> The light—</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> The light fills our vision.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Light.

And all of a sudden, a new reaction manifested there.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> No, I suppose &quot;all of a sudden&quot; is not quite the right way to put it.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> What has already been in existence for several months now has rapidly expanded over the past few days...</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> What it means is that the veil meant to pull the wool over humanity&#39;s eyes...that mask has finally been peeled off.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Central Siberia, to be specific. The Krasnoyarsk region.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> That places it—around the forested area upstream of the Tunguska river.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Any Heroic Spirit who lived in the same time period as I would know of that large-scale light emission.</p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/NLW5OVo.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Tunguska...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I have read the records. The Tunguska explosion, otherwise known as the Tungus explosion.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou fou?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> That is correct. It was an explosion that occurred over Tunguska in 1908 A.D.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Back in the day, it was not confirmed to have been an explosion...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> But it was a dreadful light. Even now, I can still see it in my eyes.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> You were in England at the time, Holmes...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Yes.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Its brilliance could be seen even from somewhere as far away as England. It was a dreadful explosion.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> The forest region was incinerated by the intense heat and further damaged heavily by the shockwave...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> But miraculously enough, there were no confirmed human casualties.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Naturally, it was a colossal disaster. There may have been casualties that were not on the records.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> At the very least, tremendous damage had been done to nature. Untold amounts of flora and fauna were lost.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I&#39;ve heard about it too...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> ...a fallen meteorite and an explosion...</p><hr><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> That appears to be how the truth is told. I believe it&#39;s also seen as such by magical society.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Even if you unravel the records, you&#39;d be hard-pressed to find any magical factors there.</p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/RRslRXM.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> That&#39;s not to say that no one associated it with the occult, but at the very least, the Mage&#39;s Association has ruled it a natural phenomenon.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> There is no evidence of Mystery having been employed.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> That&#39;s why this is an enigma. Why is it in Tunguska?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Well, I could venture a guess, but—</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Now&#39;s not the time to speak of it?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> That is how it is. Let us start with the facts.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> A unique domain that is neither Singularity nor Lostbelt has formed on the blank surface of Tunguska.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> It&#39;s not a Singularity?</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> The reaction is different from what we would identify as a Holy Grail. As such, we felt it prudent to classify it as something other than a Singularity.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> It&#39;s not a Lostbelt either?</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Yes. After all, there is no storm wall present. Furthermore, there is no &quot;variance&quot; as far as humanity goes.</p><hr><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> It&#39;s not like we don&#39;t have any guesses, but—</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> They&#39;re not based on any empirical evidence. There&#39;s a good chance it would lead to misunderstandings, so let&#39;s not go there.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> What we can pinpoint at this moment is the cause of this abnormality—no, the name of this enemy we must exterminate.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> TRISMEGISTUS II and Observation Lens SHEBA have both identified this magical signature as a juvenile Beast.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> The name of the enemy is Tamamovitch Koyanskaya. It&#39;s safe to say this unique domain is her &quot;stronghold&quot;.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fouuuu...</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Are we done with the explanation? Then allow me to say this once more.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> In regards to the reaction detected in the forest region of old Tunguska! What we will do is!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Find Koyanskaya&#39;s hideout and—Whaaat!?</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Foufou!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> W-What are you so excited about? I&#39;ll have you know I don&#39;t have any bacon, alright!?</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou, fouu!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That&#39;s no good, Fou. Come here.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Haa, haa...be sure to hold onto it, alright...?</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Umm, ahem.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Now where was I? (Tense)</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> —Tamamovitch Koyanskaya. She possesses a Saint Graph much like a Servant&#39;s,</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> and is the representative director of NFF Services, a private military company established in January of 2017 after the &quot;resolution of the Human Order Incineration&quot;,</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> as well as the juvenile Beast IV, the Beast of Cherishment.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> In all likelihood, the events that occurred in the British Lostbelt have left Koyanskaya...</p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/ijyN4wg.png" alt=""></p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/FY45B2G.png" alt=""></p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/XZDmaC6.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> ...in a defective state of sorts. We predict she will not be in perfect form.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Her might when we encountered her in the Atlantic Lostbelt, on Olympus, was tremendous...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> At the very least, the magical signature observed by SHEBA does not appear to surpass that.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> For now, that&#39;s a relief...I suppose.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes, Senpai...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> You&#39;re not going to say she&#39;s gotten any weaker, are you?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> I cannot say for sure.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fouuu...</p><p>--</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Now, the problem at hand is—</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> What is she up to?</p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/oju8wo9.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Meunière:</strong><br> ...she saved our hides in Britain...for the record. But that woman is still an enemy of humanity nonetheless.</p><p><strong>Meunière:</strong><br> Nor is she the type to repent after suffering a grievous wound.</p><p><strong>Meunière:</strong><br> She must have some kind of reason for withdrawing to the far reaches of Russia, don&#39;t you think?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Yeah. There&#39;s a good chance she&#39;s recovering the power she&#39;s lost.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Or perhaps she&#39;s plotting to grow further...?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> There&#39;s no reason to reveal your hideout just because you sustained an injury.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Putting something she had hidden out there in the open means there&#39;s no longer a need to keep it hidden, and—</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> That sounds likely.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> The undefined form we encountered in Olympus was most likely an incomplete state.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> The large horns seen in matured Beasts could not be seen in her previous form.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Juvenile...growth...</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> ...may I? All personnel, I&#39;d like you to hear me out.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> ...as Meunière has mentioned, that accursed Koyanskaya protected this ship in the Fairy Kingdom.</p><p><strong>Chaldea Staff:</strong><br> (The new director...)</p><p><strong>Chaldea Staff:</strong><br> (He actually got Meunière&#39;s name right for the first time in forever!?)</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> That is an unmistakable fact. And this may be information you have no way of knowing, but...</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Chillingly enough, she behaved much like a human, in a manner befitting a CEO.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> She did not just dispatch troops. She provided medical equipment and aid to those in great poverty.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Even if it was just good business, she was sincere in her dealings with those who sought help.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> She may possess the traits of a &quot;femme fatale and a devil&quot;, but she was not a unilateral exploiter either.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> If you talked to her, she...no, it&#39;s just &quot;something&quot; she used to establish dialogues.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> But...but!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> No matter what, we cannot afford to overlook the growth of a Beast!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Besides...this responsibility is mine to bear.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> This is especially true for those of you who knew the old Chaldea. It&#39;s bound to hurt and rankle a few.</p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/x3F17J7.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> ...it is clear that...I have no right to lead like this.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> But that&#39;s precisely why I would like to say this. Please let me take responsibility, even if I have no right to do so.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> I hereby announce to all Chaldea personnel! As of this moment, Chaldea will prepare for combat!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> The battle against the &quot;Alien God&quot;.A resolution to the &quot;bleaching of the Earth&quot;.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Putting that top priority on hold, we will divert all our efforts towards exterminating Koyanskaya!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> (Finally...)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> New Director Gordolf...</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Understood.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Nevertheless, this is not entirely a detour! We cannot afford to waste resources in that manner!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> While this is an anti-Beast operation, we will also be using this as a test run for the elimination of the seventh Lostbelt!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Our upcoming confrontation with the Alien God...consider this a rehearsal for that as well!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> In other words!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> We expect the Black Barrel will see active deployment!</p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/bvl5I1K.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> The Black Barrel...measures the target&#39;s Life Scale with the Accomplish Measure,</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> and attacks using &quot;life&quot; itself as a bullet,</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> But if it&#39;s used individually without a Command Spell involved, it is now possible with just Habetrot&#39;s assistance alone.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> It will end up being a physical weapon instead of a conceptual one though. But it will still be plenty effective as a weapon, considering its firepower.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> The barrel will burn out, so consecutive fire is out of the question, but being able to use it on demand is still a big deal.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Mm. I&#39;ve grasped the situation with the Black Barrel. Next up is—</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> the essence of the Divine Construct we acquired in the British Lostbelt. How goes the development of the main battery that makes use of it?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Oh, it&#39;s currently underway.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Development is proceeding at a rapid pace with Sion, but this is a first for me...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> It shames me to say this, but it won&#39;t be done in time for our current operation.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> I&#39;d like you to conduct this battle with Chaldea&#39;s usual tactics, applying them such that we get the maximum effect out of them.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> ...I see. Just maybe, I thought we could have...</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> But I was prepared for such an eventuality! No matter, it&#39;s not like we are short on alternatives!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> —The Plan to Eliminate the Seventh Lostbelt, Part 1!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Foufoufou.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Hmph. There&#39;s only a part 1 to it, you say?</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Mm. That is correct, but I&#39;d like you to pipe down now!</p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/AMhUj29.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The director gets what Fou is saying...</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> No, I haven&#39;t the faintest clue! But somehow, my soul understood that just now!</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> The Plan to Eliminate the Seventh Lostbelt—of course, is centered around Excalibur.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> However, we also have a secondary asset planned to supplement it. That is,</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> the simultaneous mass summoning of Chaldea&#39;s Heroic Spirits that becomes possible by running the Storm Border&#39;s magical furnaces in parallel.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> In other words, that&#39;s right—</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> The Large Scale Plan!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Storming the enemy&#39;s turf with a flood of Chaldea&#39;s Heroic Spirits, while keeping them continuously materialized. We will carry out this blitz operation while packing immense firepower.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> To put it simply...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> &quot;While keeping them in a state of constant materialization,</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> we will send in a bunch of Heroic Spirits suited for the mission.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> That would be the easiest way, assuming we can do that.”</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> And that&#39;s what we&#39;re aiming to do!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Foufooou!?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> This plan will be utilized solely for the purpose of exterminating Koyanskaya, however...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> ...at the same time, it will also serve as a test run for the elimination of the seventh Lostbelt.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> All the records will be valuable data in the future, so I&#39;d like you to keep this in mind.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Fujimaru.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Understood.</p><hr><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> You will be accompanied by up to ten Heroic Spirits as you enter the area of operations as a formidable army.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> We will get as close as we can with the Border and drop you in the vicinity of Koyanskaya&#39;s magical signature.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Move quickly and neutralize her.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> A most straightforward yet powerful strategy...let&#39;s all go and do our best together!</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> For this mission, we have carefully selected six Heroic Spirits. They are standing by in briefing room 2.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Naturally, they are ready to depart at a moment&#39;s notice.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Swifter than ever before!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> You must carry out this mission!

Mash Kyrielight has no issues.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> No issues here.</p><hr><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/KVbrjIg.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Status confirmation—</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Electrical systems damage at 20%. Recovery feasible. No engine damage. Frame damage at 10%. Operation viable.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Not too shabby, considering the landing from an emergency sortie. Is everyone alright?</p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/ZwT8oOq.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Meunière:</strong><br> Y-Yeah. I was prepared for some whiplash, but this is nothing.</p><p><strong>Meunière:</strong><br> On the contrary...my stiff shoulders are feeling better...?</p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/HdCZTHJ.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Why do you look like you&#39;ve gone to a chiropractor? Are you the type of person who rehabs on rollercoasters?</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> While the lifestyle my subordinate leads has me a bit depressed, h-hmm, I am fine as well.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Fujimaru and Kyrielight...hmph, also appear to be fine.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> ...! I see you&#39;ve joined us on board as well, furball! Tsk...can&#39;t send you back to the Storm at this point...</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Technical Advisor, how are things on your end? We have landed on enemy soil, are there any problems with the Saint Graphs?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Thank you for your concern, Director. I don&#39;t see any abnormalities in the Saint Graphs either.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> It would appear the Heroic Spirits weren&#39;t all forced out, like they were in the British Lostbelt.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Even if the Heroic Spirits are to be rejected, a loophole of sorts...is bound to exist.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Beings who already possess a clear life of their own should have no trouble either. This includes humans and animals.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> We should treat this domain as one that forces out or otherwise rejects Heroic Spirits whose existence depends heavily on human history.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou!</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Eh, don&#39;t you think that&#39;s a little strange?</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Huh?</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> I mean, I&#39;m here.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> That voice...</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> You like my voice? I like it too.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> In any case, I think your predictions are all a little off the mark.</p><hr><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> W-Who&#39;s there!?</p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/7ax9xEC.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Ibuki Dōji:</strong><br> After all—I&#39;m right here.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Ibuki-Douji!</p><p><strong>Ibuki Dōji:</strong><br> ...?</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Oh...</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> ...?</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> A Heroic Spirit. Or rather, less of a Heroic Spirit and more of a Divine Spirit Servant.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Oh, now that I mention it! Ibuki-Douji was on standby in briefing room 2.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> She&#39;s one of the six Heroic Spirits! So you were safe!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> ...hnn. She was...safe? How come?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Y-Yes.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Unlike a normal Heroic Spirit, Ibuki-Douji is a Divine Spirit Servant...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I wonder if it&#39;s due to that categorization?</p><p><strong>Meunière:</strong><br> Well, if she&#39;s here, she&#39;s here.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Ibuki Dōji:</strong><br> ...?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> ...no doubt about it. She&#39;s Ibuki-Douji.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> In that case, the nature of this place may differ from the British Lostbelt.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Judging from the situation, there&#39;s no doubt that it&#39;s preventing the materialization of Heroic Spirits.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Just like Britain, you&#39;re not held back by that if you incarnate. But there&#39;s one more thing!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Non-human Heroic Spirits are not forced out. What&#39;s the criteria here, I wonder?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Was she okayed because she&#39;s a Divine Spirit? Or is it because she&#39;s categorized as a Nature Spirit?</p><p><strong>Ibuki Dōji:</strong><br> Non-human?</p><p><strong>Ibuki Dōji:</strong><br> Divine Spirit? Nature Spirit?</p><p><strong>Ibuki Dōji:</strong><br> ...Hmm~.</p><p><strong>Ibuki Dōji:</strong><br> Was Ibuki-Douji my True Name?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Huh?</p><p><strong>Ibuki Dōji:</strong><br> ...?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Hold on a second.</p><p><strong>Ibuki Dōji:</strong><br> Hmm?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Could it be that there&#39;s something wrong with your memory?</p><hr><p><strong>Ibuki Dōji:</strong><br> Hmm~?</p><p><strong>Ibuki Dōji:</strong><br> Well, I am who I am. I&#39;m strong, kind, I like to drink,</p><p><strong>Ibuki Dōji:</strong><br> and I know I&#39;m your Servant.</p><p><strong>Ibuki Dōji:</strong><br> But other than that...it&#39;s all rather vague.</p><p><strong>Ibuki Dōji:</strong><br> Hmm, what exactly was I anyway?</p><p><strong>Ibuki Dōji:</strong><br> Not that I care, as long as I can get a nice drink!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> It&#39;s not alright, but I understand the situation.</p><p><strong>Ibuki Dōji:</strong><br> Is that so?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I see...it&#39;s a pleasure to have you, Ibuki-Douji!</p><p><strong>Ibuki Dōji:</strong><br> Yes! The pleasure&#39;s all mine, Master!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Aren&#39;t the two of you being a little too quick on the uptake?</p><hr><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Despite materializing, it would appear the tradeoff is an abnormality in her memories.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> There are some uncertain elements, but what about you, Ibuki-Douji? How would you rate yourself as a combatant?</p><p><strong>Ibuki Dōji:</strong><br> Me? Oh, I&#39;m strong.</p><p><strong>Ibuki Dōji:</strong><br> If my Master tells me to, I&#39;ll fight! I love a good rampage.</p><p><strong>Ibuki Dōji:</strong><br> Hmm. My head&#39;s all fuzzy, so I might not be at my best though...</p><p><strong>Ibuki Dōji:</strong><br> Let&#39;s see, I&#39;ll check, so give me a minute, okay?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Y-Yes.</p><p><strong>Ibuki Dōji:</strong><br> For starters, I can use fire.</p><p><strong>Ibuki Dōji:</strong><br> Looks like wind&#39;s part of the package too.</p><p><strong>Ibuki Dōji:</strong><br> I can also use lightning.</p><p><strong>Ibuki Dōji:</strong><br> Oh, naturally, I can use water as well!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Isn&#39;t that pretty much everything!?</p><p><strong>Ibuki Dōji:</strong><br> If I try hard, I think I can even change my Saint Graph! The magical energy consumption is gonna be a buzzkill, so I&#39;m not sure how many times I can do that.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> ...this is...</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> It may be regrettable that you aren&#39;t in perfect form, and that all six Servants aren&#39;t present, but I think you&#39;re already plenty reliable...?</p><p><strong>Meunière:</strong><br> Is this what they call a blessing in disguise...?</p><p><strong>Ibuki Dōji:</strong><br> Hee hee hee!</p><p><strong>Ibuki Dōji:</strong><br> Leave it all to your big sis here. No run-of-the-mill enemy&#39;s going to give me a hard time!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I&#39;ll be counting on you, Ibuki-Douji.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Let&#39;s work together!</p><hr><p><strong>Ibuki Dōji:</strong><br> Of course!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou, fooou!</p><h2 id="section-2-great-collision" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2-great-collision" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 2: Great Collision</h2><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/bu1Q1IY.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Well, whatever!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> The most important thing is that we&#39;ve increased our assets by one. This increases our capabilities!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> She may have memory problems, but securing a Divine Spirit Servant is a significant achievement.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Have we confirmed the Storm Border has left this territory?</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Then we have but two choices to us:To proceed forward, or do nothing.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> —naturally, we choose the former.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> There&#39;s no way the enemy isn&#39;t aware we&#39;ve landed at this point.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> We have no choice but to get to Koyanskaya and crush her as soon as possible!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> This will be different from seizing a Lostbelt. This is an extermination.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> The more time she has, the more Koyanskaya will mature as a Beast.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Therefore, we do the best with what we have right now.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> At least that&#39;s what I think, but—Wh-what are your thoughts, Technical Advisor?</p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/Wb5wcGF.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Of course, I&#39;m in agreement.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> The fact that we were able to land like this, and the fact that Ibuki-Douji stayed with us...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> You could call them both &quot;good opportunities.&quot;</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> After we get an understanding of the Special Territory&#39;s state of affairs and characteristics, we can fall back.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> First is search and analysis. That&#39;s just the basic route to take right now for us.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Isn&#39;t that right, Master Fujimaru?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Yeah!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> We start with what we can reach, right?</p><hr><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Hmph—</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> You seem to be able to grasp the gist of what I&#39;m saying.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Are you okay with this, Munimuni? You are a bit of a chicken, after all.</p><p><strong>Meunière:</strong><br> At least I&#39;m not an old fart, like you. Plus, it&#39;s good to be a little nervous this time, right?</p><p><strong>Meunière:</strong><br> So, are you sure you want to restart the operation here, Da Vinci?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> We can head out anytime.</p><p><strong>Meunière:</strong><br> Sheesh, you&#39;re way too eager! Don&#39;t get ahead of yourself!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> The original plan seems kind of impossible now...</p><p><strong>Meunière:</strong><br> Yeah, it sure does.</p><p><strong>Meunière:</strong><br> We were supposed to make a blitz right for the magical signature we assumed was Koyanskaya.</p><hr><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> As you might expect, we need to change plans here.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Originally, we considered a blitz attack by means of Heroic Spirits with high firepower and mobility.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> But there&#39;s a large distance between the aforementioned magical signature and where we are now. It&#39;s actually 150 kilometers away.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> We&#39;re currently at the southern edge of the Special Territory, so to reach Koyanskaya&#39;s signature in the center,</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> we&#39;ll have to cross a considerable distance.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> ...hm.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> I&#39;d like to force our way across using the Border, but this time we need to do more than just get there.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> First, I&#39;d like to get a better grasp of the area...</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> And if we&#39;re surrounded, why there&#39;s been no hostile responses by now—</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Get the picture?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> There&#39;s no hostile signatures within the surrounding area. You can bet that I&#39;m constantly sweeping for them.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> But outside of the Border&#39;s search range, I couldn&#39;t even begin to guess.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> We need to send out a separate investigation team.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...which means...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> We have to gather info about the surrounding area...right?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> You got it.</p><p><strong>Meunière:</strong><br> You should also secure additional assets. Who knows if there are any stray Servants out there...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Meaning, get out there and get more firepower.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Yep. Gathering intel and securing more assets. We&#39;re back to square one once again.</p><hr><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> I said before that the blitz operation would be a test run for our assault on the seventh Lostbelt,</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> but at the same time, it would have lessened the burden on everyone.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Unfortunately, that&#39;s no longer possible. I&#39;m really sorry about this.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Mash, and Ibuki-Douji out on field recon...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Of course it&#39;ll be all right.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Mash is with me again this time.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I may not be receiving power from the Storm Border, but if necessary, I can use the Black Barrel independently.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> For a moment, I think I can briefly amount to several Servants in firepower.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> This time we have Ibuki-Douji with us.</p><p><strong>Ibuki Dōji:</strong><br> Oh, you mean me?</p><p><strong>Ibuki Dōji:</strong><br> Ibuki-Douji, Ibuki-Douji...I&#39;ll have to remember that. You&#39;ll have a hundredfold spiritual power with me around!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> A hundredfold spiritual power...</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> In other words, the strength of a hundred people! Divine Spirits have a weird way of putting things!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Woah, you scared me!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Don&#39;t load your eyes with such subtle magical energy! It reminds me of the hellish Mystic Eye resistance training I went through!</p><p><strong>Meunière:</strong><br> Is that really something you did...? What kind of training did you do...</p><hr><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Well, let&#39;s try this again. Commencing the new operation.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> You&#39;ll gather information about the Special Territory, and invite additional Servants to join us.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Not many stray Servants would be able to maintain their existence in this place,</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> we don&#39;t know if we can set up a summoning circle, and the Servants we can summon are going to be limited...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> So I&#39;d like you to seize any chance you get.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> You&#39;ll probably be able to perform simple summons for a few minutes at a time.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Be sure to take the situation, as well as your own limits into account when you fight.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Roger that—commencing operation!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Be careful out there!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Let&#39;s go, Mash! Ibuki-Douji!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes, Master!</p><hr><p><strong>Ibuki Dōji:</strong><br> Okay!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Unfortunately, we still can&#39;t connect outside the barrier, but communications within the Special Territory are still good.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> We&#39;ll send you periodic reports from the Shadow Border. Now...</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> —Koyanskaya Subjugation Operation, start!</p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/OSkEd2l.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Ibuki Dōji:</strong><br> Ahaha!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> She&#39;s fast...!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Y-yes! She&#39;s just like an airplane!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Even with her Saint Graph enlarged to three meters, to reach this speed holding Senpai and myself...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> She isn&#39;t affected by the terrain even in this overgrown forest!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Foooooou!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> We don&#39;t know if there are any hostiles or not...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> But the overgrown foliage will obscure our view and should make us hard to spot.</p><p><strong>Ibuki Dōji:</strong><br> Are you sure about that, Mash?</p><p><strong>Ibuki Dōji:</strong><br> Am I not dazzling? Not physically, but in terms of presence.</p><p><strong>Ibuki Dōji:</strong><br> If I&#39;m seen, I will obviously stand out. So take care!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Um, yes. But...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I think it&#39;s a very unique way of scouting.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> She should be able to escape all but the swiftest enemies!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> She&#39;s sure...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> ...just like the roaring wind...</p><hr><p><strong>Ibuki Dōji:</strong><br> —!</p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/GtQkngJ.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Ibuki-Douji?</p><p><strong>Ibuki Dōji:</strong><br> ...I sense something big up ahead.

In that case, the answer is...</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Lost Familiars—</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Her familiars, in other words.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> The ones stationed here are automatic. They will automatically attack whoever they deem enemies.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Please rest assured,</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> for they do not share a data link with their administrator. Having said that...</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Those were exceptional units, even among the Lost Familiars. You lot ran out of luck back there.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Still, since you did take three exceptional units out all at once—</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> that would mean you made your own luck. That was splendid indeed.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Truly a force to be reckoned with.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou!</p><p><strong>Ibuki Dōji:</strong><br> That startled me.</p><p><strong>Ibuki Dōji:</strong><br> Getting this close even though they were in my sensory range.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Master, get behind me!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> It&#39;s alright.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Oh?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I think an enemy would&#39;ve attacked us already—</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> I see.

The opposite of an enemy! I am a professional, here to hunt a beast!</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> I&#39;ve been summoned in the Saint Graph of a Rider on this occasion. But I still have a few tricks up my sleeve, you see.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> So the thing is,</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> I ask that you leave the elimination of the shadow of Daji,</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> attempting to usurp Beast IV, to me.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Daji...?</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> I know quite a bit about her. I&#39;ve undertaken additional investigations as well.</p><p><strong>Ibuki Dōji:</strong><br> Alright! I take it we&#39;re bolstering our forces!</p><p><strong>Ibuki Dōji:</strong><br> Hold on—should I even be pleased about this? What do you say?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Probably...?</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Oh dear, could it be that you&#39;re wary of me? Perhaps a dashing lad has made a fool of you in the recent past?</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Hmm. Hmm.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> So that&#39;s how it is...</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> I must say, I was rather confident in my negotiation skills...how odd.</p><p><strong>Woman&#39;s Voice:</strong><br> That sounds about right.</p><p><strong>Woman&#39;s Voice:</strong><br> You&#39;re too euphemistic.

Please make use of me as a guide.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Unfortunately, we were not endowed with any knowledge of Chaldea&#39;s inner workings.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Only that you are an organization resisting on behalf of the Human Order.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> The trials you&#39;ve overcome to date.

This time, about the &quot;hostile life forms that exist in this domain&quot;.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> I believe you have already encountered them, but broadly speaking, there are two types.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Firstly, there are the mass-produced units who are born in succession, as a species.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> The ones resembling Yaga and Kali may be those...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Those are beings unique to their respective Lostbelts...</p><hr><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Yes, that is true. You called them Yaga and Kali?</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> I believe you&#39;ve also encountered the giants of Scandinavia, have you not?</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> These mass-produced units are commonly known as Lost Familiars.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Sometimes, rare variants of a higher class do manifest...</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> But for the most part, you can consider them the rank and file.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Oh, Lost Familiars is a term I came up with on my own. Please feel free to use it.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> They fall under the category of &quot;species that inhabit this domain&quot;.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Next up, you have these ultra-exceptional units formed via recreation! The Ivan recreation we just fought falls under this category.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> They fall under the category of &quot;an individual threat, unrelated to any species&quot;...Lost Weapons.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Hostile life forms that belong to a species are termed &quot;Lost Familiars&quot; and individual hostile entities are termed &quot;Lost Weapons&quot;.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> How about it? Simple enough, no?</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> So far, there are six familiars and six weapons. Six species and six individuals.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> I wonder how many of them she intends to collect? There are but seven Lostbelts...</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> No. That would be unlike her.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou, fou.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Anyway! We have done all that needs doing here.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> We should have whittled her forces down. Let us be on our way.</p><p><strong>Nikitch:</strong><br> Mmm!</p><p><strong>Nikitch:</strong><br> Let&#39;s get moving! You, Dragon, fly off with Mash and Fujimaru!</p><p><strong>Ibuki Dōji:</strong><br> Alrighty!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/7z6lvrP.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Mm—.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> That&#39;s right, around here should be good.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> The Lost Familiars have two types of behavorial patterns.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> They either stand by at accumulation points or move periodically along a patrol route.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> We&#39;re currently far off from either.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> So it&#39;s relatively safe.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou, fou.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Fou, if you get too close to the river edge...</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou-fish!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Woah.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Wow, there are lots of fish—</p><p><strong>Nikitch:</strong><br> Mm. They&#39;re delicious.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Y-yes.</p><p><strong>Nikitch:</strong><br> You want some?</p><p><strong>Ibuki Dōji:</strong><br> Wow, is it okay? When a beautiful woman invites me, I can&#39;t help but want to take part!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> A dragon species...eats fish, doesn&#39;t it, Lemon?</p><p><strong>Meunière:</strong><br> You must be picturing a Meunière that&#39;s good at cooking...How on earth would I know the dietary habits of a divine oriental dragon!?</p><p><strong>Meunière:</strong><br> Aren&#39;t they usually carnivores? They also like alcohol, right?</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Would you like me to help you with fishing? It&#39;s my specialty.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> !!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> When speaking of Taigong, it has to be fishing!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Taigong. His fondness for fishing is so well known in China and Japan that his name is associated with anglers...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> As expected of Taigong.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> That&#39;s right.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes!</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> But this time, my job is fox hunting—beast hunting. We have to hunt that human-resenting beast.</p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/mLkmjzF.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Hmm...This is an unusual case indeed.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> You may be a stray Servant, but clearly you&#39;re aware of the Human Order.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Rather than the land, you&#39;re a Heroic Spirit summoned by the world itself...is that it?</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> —Yes, that&#39;s about right.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> So could you be the Counter Force&#39;s...</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Oh, no no! It&#39;s not as clear cut as that.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Well—</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> I guess this isn&#39;t the time to be modest. Alright, I&#39;m gonna say it!</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> My usual self is, um...how should I say this?</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Even manifesting with the Saint Graph of a Grand Caster wouldn&#39;t be odd, you know.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Uh.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Err.</p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/z5rfLVI.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Meunière:</strong><br> Seriously?</p><p><strong>Ibuki Dōji:</strong><br> What happened? Still no bite?</p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/QbDITAJ.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Nikitch:</strong><br> No, not yet.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...Grand Caster?</p><hr><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Yes.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Grand Caster. I wonder if it&#39;s possible to be a Grand Rider as well?</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Anyhow, it&#39;s not something strange. But for some reason, I&#39;m just a normal Rider here.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> In addition, since I&#39;ve been constantly using fangshu to twist the rules and avoid getting forced out...</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> My power has been considerably drained. Ah, I&#39;m ashamed.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Being so serious about beast hunting... you&#39;re a professional Beast slayer indeed.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Unfortunately, he&#39;s currently manifested in a normal Saint Graph. With that said, it doesn&#39;t change the fact that it&#39;s very reassuring.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou!</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> No matter the state of my Saint Graph, there&#39;s probably only one thing that the Human Order wants from me.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> My job this time is to finish off that Beast IV candidate who&#39;s doing as she pleases everywhere.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Mm, what a mess.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> The Human Order and Lord Yuanshi Tianzun sure are working me to the bone!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> ... ...</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> ...O-oh. Is that some type of Kunlun Mountain joke?</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> When you suddenly reference the supreme being of a mythological system, it&#39;s hard to know how to react.</p><p><strong>Meunière:</strong><br> That&#39;s right, it&#39;s not that funny...</p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/K9nfvBd.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> I sure was talking big!</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> However, the current me has a very much reduced amount of magical power. I&#39;d like to ask everyone at Chaldea to lend me a hand.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Um, about that, we&#39;re glad to have your help as well!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Let&#39;s fight together, Taigong. Nikitich.</p><hr><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Yep, I&#39;m looking forward to working with you.</p><p><strong>Nikitch:</strong><br> Mm! It&#39;s about time I caught something.</p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/WI5fMC3.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Animals:</strong><br> (Fidgeting)</p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/7z6lvrP.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Leaving the fishing to Nikitich—let&#39;s start our information sharing.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Mm-hmm. From the Russian Lostbelt came the Yaga...those Beastmen.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> From the Scandinavian Lostbelt, she collected the Giants. I wonder what she collected from the Chinese Lostbelt?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That&#39;s unknown. We haven&#39;t encountered them yet either.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Hmm.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Perhaps...Were there tanks with tiger heads on them in the Chinese Lostbelt?</p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/riz3iqd.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> T-there were...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> There were, indeed...</p><hr><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> I see. So there were.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> I knew it, so those were the Familiars from the Chinese Lostbelt, huh...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Oh, um! I&#39;m sure they were there, but I thought it was a machine or...</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> No, it&#39;s a living thing. Or at least, the one we came across in this region was.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> The tiger part is living. It even roars.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> !</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> So, basically...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Koyanskaya&#39;s battle strength in this region is essentially made up by what she acquired from the Lostbelts?</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Essentially, yes.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> The six species of Lost Familiars are active in small numbers around the patrol routes.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> The Lost Weapons, who are ultra-exceptional units, exist for base defense and to be dispatched in abnormal situations.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> That was a reproduction of Ivan the Terrible just now, wasn&#39;t it?</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Yes. He was indeed placed very effectively.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Since they have full control over the leylines, they keep reappearing every time we strike them down.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> An inexhaustible supply of Familiars...and you&#39;ve been fighting them all alone?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> It&#39;s like being totally surrounded by enemies while deep within their territory.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I&#39;m amazed you were able to survive...</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> It&#39;s thanks to my speedy escapes, I guess!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Seems like you&#39;re barely scraping by.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> I&#39;m confident in my ability to escape. Yep.</p><hr><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> If they&#39;re struck down thoroughly enough, it&#39;ll be fine for a while. It&#39;s not to the extent where we have to lament the futility of fighting them.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> ...But they&#39;re in control of the leylines. It&#39;ll be difficult to set up a summoning circle then.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Unfortunately so.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> With that said, each location doesn&#39;t have a connection that transmits information to Koyanskaya.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> They&#39;re also cut off in terms of magical connections. The base&#39;s Lost Weapons are all in a state of complete autonomy.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Much like Koyanskaya...</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Basically, we&#39;re unlikely to be noticed unless we&#39;re near the &quot;castle&quot; in the center.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> &quot;Castle&quot;, huh—</p><p><strong>Nikitch:</strong><br> I caught a fish!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> The unexpected Strong Style!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> That&#39;s not fishing, you&#39;re just grabbing it!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Your whole body is soaked! A-are you okay?</p><p><strong>Nikitch:</strong><br> No problem.</p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/gzmGgQr.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Nikitch:</strong><br> Bububububububububu.<br> (Water droplets splashing around)</p><p><strong>Nikitch:</strong><br> That will dry me off.</p><p><strong>Ibuki Dōji:</strong><br> Hahahaha...and I&#39;m soaking as well. Hahaha!</p><p><strong>Ibuki Dōji:</strong><br> Judging by those ears, Nikichi has to be some type of animal incarnation, isn&#39;t she?</p><p><strong>Ibuki Dōji:</strong><br> And she&#39;s adept at shaking herself dry too!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> (Oh. You&#39;re cutting in there, Divine Spirit Ibuki-Douji!)</p><p><strong>Nikitch:</strong><br> Oho, you&#39;re interested in my ears?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Nikitich, um...are you a Beastman?</p><p><strong>Nikitch:</strong><br> No, I&#39;m not.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> (She&#39;s not?)</p><p><strong>Nikitch:</strong><br> I&#39;m not, but my wife was a strong, beautiful she-giant, more beast than man.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> So those beast ears are your wife&#39;s...?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Maybe your Saint Graph reproduces her features?</p><hr><p><strong>Ibuki Dōji:</strong><br> That&#39;s so sweet. I wonder if you&#39;re a Heroic Spirit that receives blessings from the love between you two.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> I see! So that&#39;s why you&#39;re in the form of a woman!</p><p><strong>Nikitch:</strong><br> No, it&#39;s not.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> It&#39;s not...</p><p><strong>Nikitch:</strong><br> Or it might be, a little.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> O-oh? So your ears and form are indeed because of your wife&#39;s blessing—</p><p><strong>Nikitch:</strong><br> Hm~.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> ...Which is it?</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Well then. I have a theory.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> What kind of principle is this region employing to force out Heroic Spirits of the Human Order—?</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> ... ...</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> ...It would be easy to talk about it here, but I&#39;d like for you to wait a while.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Hm. And what is your reasoning for that?</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> It&#39;s necessary for you Chaldeans to receive some prerequisite knowledge.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> In order to do that, we need to gain an understanding of this area. Specifically, there are two places I&#39;d like to visit.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> It&#39;s easier to show than to explain.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> And above all —</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Yes, your understanding about Koyanskaya should change a lot.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> At the same time, you should also learn why Nikitich and Ibuki-Douji aren&#39;t forced out as well.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> ...Seems like you&#39;re putting on airs, Heroic Spirit Taigong. Or should I say, Grand Candidate Taigong?</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> A presentation should be effective, shouldn&#39;t it? I tend to be particular about those sort of things by nature.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> And well, there really are some things in the world that just can&#39;t be described adequately with words alone.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> That&#39;s how I came to terms with the region myself. How you guys will feel about it though...</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> I&#39;m not so sure about that.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> I understand.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Fujimaru, Mash. What do you think about his statement?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> If there&#39;s something you want to show, I&#39;ll have a look.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> A picture is worth a thousand words, right?</p><hr><p><strong>Nikitch:</strong><br> Hm. Shall we move then?</p><p><strong>Nikitch:</strong><br> Alright. But we&#39;ve got to finish eating the fish first.</p><p><strong>Nikitch:</strong><br> Let&#39;s bake them.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Hm~.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Sorry, Nikitich, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a good idea to make smoke.</p><p><strong>Nikitch:</strong><br> You can use a technique then.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Huh. That&#39;s your reply!?</p><p><strong>Nikitch:</strong><br> There was a technique for roasting fish amongst your sage and dao arts, wasn&#39;t there?</p><p><strong>Nikitch:</strong><br> The seasoning is perfect! More salt, pepper, and others can be added just by wishing for it.</p><p><strong>Nikitch:</strong><br> Fine adjustments can be done as well! I&#39;ve already skewered them all!</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Yes, yes...</p><p><strong>Ibuki Dōji:</strong><br> Wow, that smells great! The fish will be cooked in no time!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> How convenient...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> So these are sage arts?</p><hr><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Oh no, it&#39;s actually one of my originals.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> I quite like fishing, so I thought it would be useful to have a technique that allows me to eat the fish as soon as I catch them.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> As expected of Taigong, the man associated with anglers—</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Oh, really?</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Ah, that&#39;s a bit embarrassing.</p><p><strong>Nikitch:</strong><br> The fish is ready. Let&#39;s all eat our share before we leave!</p><p><strong>Nikitch:</strong><br> You can&#39;t fight if you&#39;re hungry. Besides, you all look as young as chicks.</p><p><strong>Nikitch:</strong><br> And so you should eat! Hurry and eat!</p><p><strong>Nikitch:</strong><br> Eat and make up for the exhaustion in your continuous battles! After that, we bogatyrs go to battle once more!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Y-yes!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I&#39;ll be digging in!</p><hr><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> ...Let&#39;s begin our meal as well then! Fish, hm...I&#39;d like some meunière with it...</p><p><strong>Meunière:</strong><br> You called?</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Not you, Morningcall! Hm, what should I do...</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou fu, fou fu (Chew chew)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> (Chew chew)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Wow, it&#39;s so delicious...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The meat has a pleasant texture and a lovely aroma as well—</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It&#39;s a refreshing taste typical of freshwater fish!</p><p><strong>Ibuki Dōji:</strong><br> (Chew chew)</p><p><strong>Ibuki Dōji:</strong><br> Oh, it&#39;s so delicious!

But I wonder...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> It&#39;s just my intuition, but I think that—</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> It&#39;s a being that lives rooted in fact, and not in Mystery, right?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...that&#39;s how it looks to me too.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> It has a grounded feeling for a Phantasmal.

They lack any of their usual traits, such as high magical energy.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> However, they are the most common creature in this territory. There is nothing here to prey upon them.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> An apex predator...</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> They are forming a pack.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Small groups of them come together to form a large herd.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> In this canyon alone, let&#39;s see...several hundred of them belong to a single herd.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> In this environment?</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Yes.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> That&#39;s odd. I don&#39;t know if they eat meat, plants, or both, but there doesn&#39;t appear to be any feeding grounds nearby.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> This is just a colony.

After all, each step brings the discovery of a new species!</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> What&#39;s more, it&#39;s completely unknown if they fall under the normal evolutionary tree!</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> I&#39;m not familiar with modern-day sciences, and my fangshu can cover most of the bases.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> But even then, I&#39;m completely flummoxed.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> I have no idea.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> In terms of both composition and ecology, there&#39;s no way that creature should exist.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> ...is that a declaration?</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Yes.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...I don&#39;t understand.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Why would Koyanskaya do this?</p><hr><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> There you have it.

That is just how the war-beasts of the Dead Zone are.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> War-beasts...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> The name says it all, straightforward and easy to understand.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> They walk bipedally like humans, and kill with firearms much like a human.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> And above all else, they indulge in butchery like humans.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> The Lahmu of Uruk were horrifying creatures, but they had enough sapience to &quot;obey their mother&quot;.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> But the war-beasts lack even that. You even get the feeling that they were born only to slaughter one another.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Like a caricature of a human. Yet they roar and behave just like beasts.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Weapons and cruelty are exclusive to man. They are not inherent in wild animals.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Cruelty—Ibuki-Douji and the others may claim it is an intrinsic part of the essence of battle,</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> but that only applies to human battles.

This is merely guesswork, but—</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> I&#39;m positive that it&#39;s for the purpose of slaughtering humanity.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> ...Impressive.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> What an answer, Leonardo da Vinci. No wonder they call you the renaissance genius!</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> And allow me to add to that. Your analysis earlier was almost spot-on.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> The war-beasts have an extremely limited detection range. I too figured as much.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> But it&#39;s a different story when you consider what their natural prey is.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> !</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> They may respond poorly to Heroic Spirits, but they react much more to humans!?</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> In all likelihood.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> So that means—</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Mash!</p><hr><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/n14YpQm.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes!

The Director and Meunière are busy driving the Border and keeping an eye on the perimeter.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> I&#39;m the only one who can talk right now. Is that fine?</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Yes. I&#39;d like to continue our conversation from earlier.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> First, Lady Da Vinci. Your guess was correct, as expected.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Both the war-beasts and the Dead Zones are for the purpose of killing mankind.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> The question is, why is this the case?</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> In a completely blanked world, where the Russian Lostbelt has disappeared,</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> this land of Tunguska is still full of life.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> This two-faced Special Territory, existing similarly to a Lostbelt while being completely different.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> A land overflowing with unknown plants and animals exulting life. A wasteland of endless battles slaughtering life.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> And generally speaking, a grotesque biosphere that doesn&#39;t recognize any existence related to the Human Order, and refuses any connection to the Throne.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> A world that despises humanity despite not rejecting them, but also overflowing with violence against them.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> What is this place, exactly?</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Allow me to state my conclusion. There can be no mistake, this place is—</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> —somebody&#39;s inner world. A Reality Marble.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> !</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou!?</p><p><strong>Nikitch:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Ibuki Dōji:</strong><br> (Chewing happily)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> A Reality Marble...</p><hr><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> ...the ultimate achievement in magecraft.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> A superlative magecraft technique creating another world inside the real one.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> The effect varies depending on the user. But it allows things normally impossible in reality to occur, as a commonality.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Heroic Spirits sometimes use them as Noble Phantasms, but magically speaking, their value is absurd!</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Somebody&#39;s inner world. The embodiment of their mentality.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Without a doubt, another world apart from the one we know.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> That is what this place is.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> The world—of Tamamovitch Koyanskaya.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> A paradise safe from outsiders...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> A hell of human-killing weapons walking the earth...</p><hr><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/gDQNGMZ.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> If this is how her spirit is...if it is what shapes this world, then...</p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/IFSG5Az.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Refutal of the existence of mankind, and scathing cynicism towards civilization.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> The hypothesis makes sense if you take into account what Koyanskaya&#39;s said and done up to now.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Your conclusion is probably the correct one. But there&#39;s still another question to answer.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Normally, a Reality Marble can&#39;t be maintained for a long period of time, right?</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Were it used in the real world, that would be the case. But there are ways around that.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> When it&#39;s deployed inside the body of a single being!</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Yes.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> The whole Special Territory, the outer shell included, is most likely Koyanskaya herself.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> She extended her Saint Graph ad infinitum, and enshrined herself within the old Tunguska forest area.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Foooooou...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> I see...that make sense.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> For a while, I thought this was a variant of a Singularity or a Lostbelt.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> In any case, we&#39;d be better off thinking of this as a Reality Marble from here on.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> After all, the theme is far too consistent!</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> On the one hand, abundant life!<br> On the other, boundless carnage!</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> And both of them rejecting humanity!</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> ...far too straightforward for a Singularity using a Holy Grail.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> There&#39;s no way that vixen would be so up-front about her wishes.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> And it&#39;s too unnatural to be reached as a what-if history.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Hold on a second.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> I have to object to that one. If it is an alternate history, then there should be one without humans.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> If that is the case though, it still doesn&#39;t account for the arbitrary Dead Zones.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> ...good guess.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Now I&#39;ll prove why I think it&#39;s so unnatural. Please think back, everybody.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Do you recall the animals you saw at the canyon in the Life Zone?</p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/lXHO3i3.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Y-yes.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The new species, parents and children—</p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/MUzpv2j.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Those were not parents and children.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Huh...?</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Siblings.</p><p><strong>Ibuki Dōji:</strong><br> What?</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> All life here is related, in a manner of speaking. The insects, animals, plants, even the war-beasts.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The plants...and the war-beasts...?</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Miss Da Vinci. You still can&#39;t perform a genetic analysis, can you?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Well, we don&#39;t have any real equipment, so that&#39;s to be expected. Wait. Wait a second here.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Are you saying you can do that yourself? Unassisted?</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Hahaha...well, it&#39;s a bit embarrassing, you see.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> I had a lot of time to kill before meeting you all, and so I made use of many fangshu.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> So I can say this definitively, okay?</p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/OByH2a8.png" alt=""></p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/ZzBJ92e.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> The creatures of this world don&#39;t interbreed. Not the animals, not the plants, and not the war-beasts.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> They don&#39;t grow, they don&#39;t accumulate experiences, their genes don&#39;t intermingle, and they don&#39;t evolve.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> All the organisms in this realm are...</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Siblings, born from a single mother.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> That&#39;s impossible...!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> We have observational and collected data, on everything!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Reproductive organs are visible! Like on the fish from before...</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> They&#39;re just for show.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> But there is a life cycle itself. One called the food chain.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Birth, life, death.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Eat and be eaten, kill and be killed.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> The difference is—</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> All the life comes from just one source: Koyanskaya, ruler of this territory.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Everything, everything here is created in a fixed state.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> The same natural cycle of the food chain.The same cycle of brutal, violent slaughter.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Both of them are equally the same.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Nothing more than what is created by Koyanskaya, and what eventually returns to her.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> This world is definitively in a closed state.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> In some ways...even moreso than a Singularity or a Lostbelt.</p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/aWJgice.png" alt=""></p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Even if that&#39;s the case...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> These animals and plants have lives, don&#39;t they...?</p><hr><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Yes, they most certainly do.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Philosophically speaking, I couldn&#39;t say. But from a purely biological standpoint,</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> all the organisms in this Special Territory have lives of their own.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> They are alive. Therefore death also exists here, and the cycle of life and death continues.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> But as for right now—</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> They have no egos or sense of self.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Huh...?</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Like I said earlier, I had a lot of time to kill, and I can assure you I&#39;ve tested it many times.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> They have no ego. They have no self.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> I suppose that means that there&#39;s no need for life that grows, evolves, or inherits traits from before.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> At the very least, for the shadow of Daji—</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> —for Koyanskaya, the ruler of this territory.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> You&#39;ve called her a &quot;shadow&quot; several times now.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Yes.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Her scent is a little different from Daji herself.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Tamamovitch Koyanskaya is an alter ego of Daji, the Golden White Face. A bunrei subvariant,</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> or perhaps an exaggerated form of her as a Heroic Spirit.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> My word. What was she thinking when she built this world...</p><hr><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> No egos or sense of self...</p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/8XNK6QZ.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> It all...somehow makes sense again...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> But if this is a Reality Marble, then that would be the case.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Regardless of how twisted it is to us, if this is how she perceives the world deep down,</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> that&#39;s the way her mental landscape would be shaped.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Yes.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> ...that being the case.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> We can&#39;t deny the possibility that Koyanskaya will do something outside of the information we&#39;ve collected up to this point.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> This is a Reality Marble, after all. The laws of the natural world mean nothing here.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> After we rendezvous, we&#39;ll join forces and make our way to where she is at the center, but—</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Be on guard, right?

All right?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Go ahead.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes, please do.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Please do, Da Vinci.</p><hr><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> First, let&#39;s sort out and confirm the situation.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Now that we&#39;ve retrieved your recon team, we&#39;re making for the center of the territory with the Shadow Border.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> It&#39;s believed to be the dwelling place of this territory&#39;s ruler, Tamamovitch Koyanskaya.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> If this territory is an enlarged version of herself, then that&#39;s the location of the nucleus or main body.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Considering her ability to cross into the different Lostbelts, there may be no point in observing...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> but even now, her response hasn&#39;t moved.</p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/BuDr1OV.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> And she won&#39;t move.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Hm?</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> I give you my word as a Heroic Spirit and Grand Duke.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Daji never moves her residence. That&#39;s the kind of creature that thing is.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> She&#39;s something of a homebody.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Once establishing her &quot;den&quot;, she will defend herself, but not go out to attack.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Only when there is a full-scale attack on her castle will she finally show herself at its gates.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Where Koyanskaya is concerned, she strongly gave off the impression of a traveller.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> You mean to say that she has an indoorsy nature?</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou. Fou?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> The coordinates of the region&#39;s center are 60°55&#39; north latitude and 101°57&#39; east longitude.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> This was Koyanskaya&#39;s reaction point when observed two days ago at Chaldea Base.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> As you may know...</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> It&#39;s the same coordinates as that once great explosion&#39;s epicenter.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You mean...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The Tunguska Explosion, correct?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> the Tunguska Explosion.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Right. About 100 years ago, a massive explosion took place—</p><hr><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Mm, to sit at the center of mass destruction. Is it a declarative statement that she will carry out one of her own?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> That&#39;s one possibility. Or...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Are she and the explosion somehow connected?</p><hr><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> That&#39;s not so impossible a circumstance.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> It&#39;s just...the Tunguska Explosion.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> It&#39;s a momentous event in history&#39;s records, but I wonder what connection it has to Daji?</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> To be honest, I have no idea either. Why did that thing choose to come here?</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> We&#39;ve heard no legends of Russian dynasties led by a beauty to ruin, have we?</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Nor any episodes of fox or raccoon spirits appearing, or tales of forests being razed.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> ... ...</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> ...Life Zones and Dead Zones.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Those two ways of being at odds within the Reality Marble may somehow be related to the explosion...</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> It is possible that may be the case, but there&#39;s nothing at present to use as grounds for analysis—</p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/KFKkrFQ.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Nikitch:</strong></p><h4 id="i-don-t-care-even-if-there-is" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#i-don-t-care-even-if-there-is" aria-hidden="true">#</a> I don&#39;t care even if there is!</h4><p><strong>Nikitch:</strong><br> I don&#39;t care if it comes down to a huge explosion or wild beast, or whatever the hell it is.</p><p><strong>Nikitch:</strong><br> I have to defeat the enemy, and save the land of Russia.</p><p><strong>Ibuki Dōji:</strong><br> Wow. Such brave words!</p><p><strong>Ibuki Dōji:</strong><br> But yeah, that&#39;s good too for Master to hear. I&#39;ll give my all for [♂ him /♀ her], all the way!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...and me too. Mash Kyrielight, ready to do everything in her power.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Yeah, and I&#39;ll do my best to support you!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou!</p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/BuDr1OV.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Distance from current position to the target is 80 kilometers. At this speed, we&#39;ll arrive in two hours.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Where the explosion is concerned, it might be more expeditious to ask her personally.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Two hours...</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> It seems the battle is finally coming to a head. Technical Advisor, what about the combat side of things?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Okay, let&#39;s start from the conclusion.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> With our current strength—we should be able to defeat Koyanskaya!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> And the specific probability for victory?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Using the battle data from Olympus as reference, I input a variety of data for calculation. The probability of victory is 70%.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Foou!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes. A 70% probability is an encouraging projection.</p><p><strong>Nikitch:</strong><br> Hmm.</p><p><strong>Ibuki Dōji:</strong><br> Mm-hmm.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> ... ...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> ...but I have to tell you the truth.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> I&#39;d like to base a strategy on a higher probability than that, and having a 30% chance of defeat is too high to talk about!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Still, though.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> This time, instead of having enhancements like the Klironomia—we have Taigong, Nikitich, and Ibuki-Douji.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Taigong is a specialist in handling the nine-tails, and Nikitich is a regular professional in combat.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Ibuki-Douji&#39;s memories are still...</p><p><strong>Ibuki Dōji:</strong><br> Yeah, still fuzzy.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Her memory doesn&#39;t look like it&#39;s sound, but she has enough magical energy and combat ability to make up for it.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> In addition, firepower support from the Black Barrel. And simple field summonings of Heroic Spirits, courtesy of Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> After taking everything into account, that&#39;s the final figure I could come to.</p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/pguOYW8.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> I wish I could raise it higher with better operations and equipment, but that&#39;s all I can do as things stand.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> ...I&#39;m a disappointing technical advisor, and ashamed for it.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You&#39;ve done nothing shameful, Da Vinci.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Think so? Well, then I really need to prove you can count on me.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Thank you for always supporting us.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Like the renaissance genius ought to. Although, you can&#39;t get around my inability to do more than that.</p><hr><p><strong>Nikitch:</strong><br> ... ...</p><p><strong>Nikitch:</strong><br> (Pats her head)</p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/xJWhJ9J.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Wawah!?</p><p><strong>Nikitch:</strong><br> Yeah. Yeah.</p><p><strong>Nikitch:</strong><br> I don&#39;t know what kind of Heroic Spirit you are, but you&#39;re doing far better in enemy territory than any child can be expected.</p><p><strong>Nikitch:</strong><br> So don&#39;t make such a face. You look cute when you smile, so smile.</p><p><strong>Nikitch:</strong><br> That way, Fujimaru and Mash will be happy.</p><p><strong>Nikitch:</strong><br> Right?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> (Nod)</p><hr><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/6Jv8UP4.png" alt=""></p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/1YwQouW.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Umm.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> I hate to sober the mood, and feel free to say so as long as we&#39;re sitting for the briefing,</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> ...but did you take into account the possibility she&#39;ll be more powerful than our encounter on Olympus?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Of course, I did!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Hmm, good then!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Moving on...</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> I hate to say it, but I will. After all, that&#39;s what a good commander should do!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> I mean, wh-what if, she were?</p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/7m0pzjb.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> As for the possibility that she&#39;s already transformed into a matured Beast—</p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/BuDr1OV.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> That isn&#39;t possible.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> R-Really?</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> This Heroic Spirit calling herself Tamamovitch Koyanskaya, rather, this present world&#39;s shadow of Daji.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> She cannot yet be a mature Beast.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> ...color me assured.</p><p><strong>Ibuki Dōji:</strong><br> How do you mean?</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> The beast called Daji has the power to control nations.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> In other words, she has free rein to bully her prey while possessing the world around her.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Any person who resists is caught at once, and made to taste indescribable torments—</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> That&#39;s what makes her Daji.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Despite Koyanskaya being a shadow, her base nature is probably not far removed from Daji.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> But matters at present don&#39;t correspond. We&#39;re able to move relatively free within the territory like we have.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> From a situational standpoint, this means she is not in a state of maturity.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Mm-hmm...</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> However, it may be—</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> She may be incomplete due to some accident.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Despite time spent resting, or emerging,</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> she hasn&#39;t sent assassins or soldiers herself, and is letting her enemy run free for too long. It&#39;s unusual for Daji.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> At present, I believe the shadow of Daji turned juvenile Beast should be considered as being in a kind of debilitated state.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> An accident...</p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/BSYgBpb.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Senpai.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Yeah, there was an accident.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> It was Cernunnos.</p><hr><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/NSqnqCT.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> I bet that was the cause. Cernunnos—</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> During a certain event in Britain&#39;s Lost World, Koyanskaya took the brunt of Cernunnos&#39; power.</p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/PSnvaV1.png" alt=""></p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Koyanskaya, she...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> for some reason, shielded us from Cernunnos.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Hmm.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> And as a result, protected Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I think so too.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> If Koyanskaya hadn&#39;t shown herself before Cernunnos at that moment,</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> the Storm Border would surely have...</p><hr><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Hmm...?</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> By Cernunnos, you mean the old nature god of Ireland?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> More precisely, a Calamity in the form of his last vestiges.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> ... ...</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> ...I see. A force closer to that of nature than to the Human Order, correct?</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> That makes sense. Considering the state of her war-beasts, her current self must have suffered a painful blow.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Or rather, defining heretofore nonexistent weaknesses unto herself...</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> I don&#39;t know how she can take a direct hit from that and still maintain her existence.</p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/UX7rc9q.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Still, everyone!

Though I can&#39;t fathom why I would ask.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> The time is ripe. Energizing ideational key-crest.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> —The Kunlun Mountains are dedicated to Yuanshi Tianzun.—Fish tail crowned in gold, clad in cloth of crane plumage, joining the Heavens and the Earth!</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> —Imperishable conduct, purity of mind!—Xians of the Pure Land, to battle!</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> —These hands of mine are exactly like the twin treasure blades!</p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/3Adz1Xn.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> —I embody geography and astronomy, for the Bagua dwells within me!—That is to say, I am as a Xian attending to battle!</p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/roX9Aka.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Those chants...</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> No, is that an incantation to begin with? Where are you on that?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> It&#39;s probably a chant. There&#39;s definitely magical energy in his voice and words.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> I&#39;m not well-versed in the sage arts, or in ideological magecraft, but I can tell he&#39;s invoking some crazy stuff!</p><p><strong>Meunière:</strong><br> I-I&#39;ll say. I heard him mention something about the Xians!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> He proclaimed himself as such.

Taigong&#39;s bringing out the big guns!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> ...Mm, Hmm. I should say so. From my viewpoint, it&#39;s no surprise.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> If Taigong&#39;s adventures in &quot;Investiture&quot; are true, then he is a man with combat strength on par with a Xian!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> He killed Gao Youqian, a later Grand Marshal of the Four Sages, with a single blow. He even defeated Wen Zhong, strongest sage of the Shang Dynasty.</p><p><strong>Meunière:</strong><br> Wow! Taigong&#39;s image seemed a lot more like a military strategist...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Where he uses tactics, he&#39;s famed for his strategies. As a Daoshi, a prodigal on the level of a Xian.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> If so, it&#39;s most reassuring. But I still think his chant is at least a little alarming!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Since despite having a connection there, it&#39;s a declaration upon the highest mythological existence.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> To me, that sounds like a pretty risky chant. Is this normal for him?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Or—</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> It might mean he has to push himself this far to subdue Daji!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> !</p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/3Adz1Xn.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> —I stand on earth as the embodiment of Yuxu!—I stand on earth as one who executes the divine investiture!</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> —Come.

Tamamovitch Koyanskaya.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> The Golden White Face beast. The calamity that brought ruin to the Shang dynasty 3,000 years ago—</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> The thousand-year fox spirit Daji, one of the Evils of Humanity, Class Beast.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> According to one theory, she is the origin of one of Japan&#39;s three great demons, Tamamo-no-Mae.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Y-yes. Tamamo-no-Mae denies it herself though, but...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Let&#39;s drop her for now, otherwise things are going to get way too complicated!</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Thank you.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> I&#39;ve been assuming the true identity of the woman you call Tamamaovitch Koyanskaya...</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> ...to be that which became a Heroic Spirit after the death of Daji.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> I came into this world with that expectation, with a special Anti-Beast Noble Phantasm as my trump card.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> However...</p><p><strong>Nikitch:</strong><br> While the second Noble Phantasm was effective to a degree, the first had no effect at all!</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> It should have worked on her, both inside and out. The first for her innards, the second for her exterior.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> However, only the second took effect. What&#39;s more, it was at less than 10% of the intended output.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> A Noble Phantasm designed for Daji&#39;s shadow...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> It didn&#39;t work on her insides at all...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> It worked somewhat against her exterior...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> So that means—</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Yes.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> The second one may have had some effectiveness because of the similarities, but the first didn&#39;t because her origin was completely different.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> If that is the case...</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> —That beast is not the shadow of Daji after all.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> It may look like her, but she has nothing to do with Daji.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> It&#39;s something else.</p><h2 id="section-11-second-coming-of-cherishment" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-11-second-coming-of-cherishment" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 11: Second Coming of Cherishment</h2><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> —How beautiful, I thought.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Of my fated enemy, of the enemy I must slay.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> A fearsome beast that delights in committing atrocities, slinking into the declining Shang dynasty and leading King Zhou&#39;s heart astray piece by piece.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> The Golden White Face that went beyond the goddess Nüwa&#39;s expectations, growing mighty and ferocious, as it attempted to devour the human realm.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> A great beauty, considered to be a monstrous evil that disrupts the harmony of the world by even the foremost of the Xians, such as Yuanshi Tianzun and Xiwangmu.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> A willful calamity.

No, not a chance.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> However thin the shadow is cast, Daji would never do such a thing!</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> And so...</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Dear me, what a disgrace! Taigong has totally failed!</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Tamamovitch Koyanskaya is something else. She is not Daji!</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Her existence should be as a counterfeit of the Golden White Face.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> ...Wh-What?</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Th-Then what is the juvenile Beast-class that we&#39;ve been closing in on?</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> You think Tamamovitch Koyanskaya has no connection to the nine-tailed huli jing who is the Golden White Face fox?</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Yes.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> It&#39;s true that they resemble one another, but I think they are fundamentally different existences.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> !</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> S-So that&#39;s where we&#39;re at...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> 3,000 years ago, Daji was behind the ruin of the Shang dynasty. There&#39;s no question she was the Golden White Face, true?</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Undoubtedly so, she was a thousand-year fox spirit.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Lady Nüwa had decreed a hasty eradication for the Shang, but that demon went on to torment the people according to her evil nature.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> The beast fatale, a powerful and ferocious thing bearing nine tails. For that was Daji.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> ...Then I came here.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> I was certain the reason for my coming to this world was to eradicate the beast fatale.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> To consign the shadow of Daji to death, in accordance with Lady Nüwa&#39;s wishes from the Empyrean realm.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Or so, I had come to earnestly think—</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> What other purpose was there!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> So you mean,</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Tamamovitch is...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> not a Tamamo...?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Senpai, you recall hearing from Tamamo-no-Mae herself that she isn&#39;t Daji.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Hm? What are you talking about? How does one taxonomically classify the Tamamos?</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> I would appreciate you not confusing me any more than I already am...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> You don&#39;t look so good, Director. Just calm down a little.</p><p><strong>Nikitch:</strong><br> Here, drink some water.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> O-Oh...</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> (Gulp, gulp)</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Pwah...Oh, that&#39;s good...</p><p><strong>Nikitch:</strong><br> Water, drawn from the clear waters of the Life Zone.It&#39;s cold, and so clear that it shimmers under the sunlight.</p><p><strong>Nikitch:</strong><br> One sip will make you feel better. Have another.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> (Gulp, gulp)</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Pwah...Oh, I feel somewhat calmer...</p><p><strong>Nikitch:</strong><br> I should say so.</p><p><strong>Ibuki Dōji:</strong><br> (Stares unblinkingly)</p><p><strong>Nikitch:</strong><br> What?</p><p><strong>Ibuki Dōji:</strong><br> Nothing, just that you make a good caretaker. Almost to a motherly degree.</p><p><strong>Nikitch:</strong><br> I can do most things, you know.</p><p><strong>Nikitch:</strong><br> ...that leaves room for the few that I can&#39;t.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou!</p><p><strong>Nikitch:</strong><br> Oh, you want some water too? Here.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou fou.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Okay, that&#39;s all well and good. The Director seems to have settled down, so shall we move on?</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Yeah, let&#39;s straighten things out.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Firstly, we are certain—she is not some alter ego or bunrei of Daji.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Nor anything along the lines of a figure exaggerated to the height of a Heroic Spirit.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> I am adamant on that point. Despite that, and towering over these facts...</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Koyanskaya is imitating the Golden White Face, that much is certain.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> We have enough on which to base this, right?</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Yeah.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> We&#39;re counting on you this time, Heroic Spirit Taigong. This is no place to formulate a plan on shaky grounds.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Let me try to redeem myself for that mistake. Yes, my arrival should somewhat be evidence.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Her personality and behavior, the differences in effect my arts had on her. Not to mention,</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> the tail.</p><p><strong>Ibuki Dōji:</strong><br> And what a tail.</p><p><strong>Ibuki Dōji:</strong><br> (Shaking)</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou fou.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Speaking first of the amount of magical energy in her possession, it&#39;s strange for her not to have already reached a mature form.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> The alter ego and familiars we&#39;ve fought have made use of that much power.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Yet she has not yet reached maturity. But why is that?</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Because the model case for her self-evolution is the Golden White Face, whose nine-tailed form is her ideal body—</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Therein is my rationale.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Oho...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Aiming to be the new nine-tails...Yes, that might be convincing reasoning.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> ... ...</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> ...On top of that, and this is just a theory.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> The tails she collected could very well be the Lostbelts themselves.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Yagas or Kalis could&#39;ve stood in as tails?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> She used the Lostbelts to gather her tails?</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Yes.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> The process of turning the life forms of the Lostbelts into her familiars would render each existence—every piece of foreign intelligence into tails.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Wh-What do you mean?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> We might be jumping the gun here. Would you care to explain?</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> That&#39;s how it seemed from the alter ego, with a ludicrous mass to her Saint Graph.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> From what I could tell, it currently weighs hundreds of thousands of tons. A mass like a gargantuan monster.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> That much...!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> A giant monster...!?</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> It&#39;s not so easy to gauge at a glance, like power from the amount of magical energy...</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> But that mass is her weight of existence!</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Isn&#39;t it possible that she&#39;s been extracting the information of the six Lostbelts via her Lost Familiars, making it into tails, and expanding?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Six Lostbelts?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> We counted five tails before.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> If you&#39;re talking about the alter ego that emerged at Olympus, it wouldn&#39;t be so strange for it to have five tails.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Her main body may still only have five tails.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Oh?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> One of them was lost in Britain.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> The fight at Britain&#39;s Lake District.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Since Muramasa said that one of the spiritual cores was destroyed there by Mélusine.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Mm-hmm.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Although, even with the Beast Saint Graph...it stands that her growth stage had already reached the count of six tails.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Still, these assumptions notwithstanding...</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> A Saint Graph of so huge a mass will takeproportionate effort to utterly kill and burn out.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Which isn&#39;t to say it&#39;s equivalent to destroying six Lostbelts, but it will take spending a good amount of resources.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...I see...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Hrm...so we need firepower of that degree?</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> I&#39;m disappointed we haven&#39;t finished the Excalibur Cannon. I even prepared new sunglasses for the occasion...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Taigong?</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Yes?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Oh, you&#39;ve only now noticed?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Your expression looks strangely better, Taigong. Could it be you still have a card yet to play?</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Well...</p><p><strong>Nikitch:</strong><br> Say it, Taigong.</p><p><strong>Nikitch:</strong><br> I know you&#39;re afraid to reveal anything after you made such a terrible blunder.</p><p><strong>Nikitch:</strong><br> Even so, I think you should reveal anything you&#39;ve kept secret!</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> I-I&#39;d hate for you to talk about me like some kind of schemer...</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> ... ...</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> ...Yes. Yes, I do, after a fashion!</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> There&#39;s definitely a way to stop Koyan!</p><p><strong>Ibuki Dōji:</strong><br> Wow, there is!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou fou!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> If you have the means, then it&#39;s uplifting!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> I was honestly conflicted since she can generate unlimited war-beasts and Lost Familiars.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> It&#39;s turned out that she can mobilize them one after the other, right? In such a situation...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Continuing to head for the center of the territory will only play into her hands.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> I honestly wondered if we should abandon that strategy, and considered leaving the territory with all our power.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> That made me hesitate—</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Morningstar! Reset the Border&#39;s course for the center of the territory!</p><p><strong>Meunière:</strong><br> Already laid in! I knew that would be in line with your habits, Commander!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Mm.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> ...No, hold on. Wait first for your commander&#39;s orders before you act, all right?</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> As for me, I don&#39;t want to run away from this. I need to go to Koyanskaya&#39;s castle.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> The first Anti-Beast Noble Phantasm was a total dud, and the second not much better.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> But I promise, I will lead you to the solution!</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> There is a way!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Mm. If you say as such openly, can we rely on you?</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Please leave it to me.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> I removed certain properties of the Anti-Beast Noble Phantasm based on targeting Daji&#39;s shadow...</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> But there are countermeasures for any monster, no matter how mighty or huge beyond reckoning!</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> It&#39;s still a juvenile body. There are ways to plan for it.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Even if you don&#39;t know what it is, measures and countermeasures are always possible.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Though, I don&#39;t know for sure how well it will work—</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> —the means are there.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong></p><h4 id="serious-face-serious-face" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#serious-face-serious-face" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Serious face!

You&#39;re being too vague.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Not to worry, this will stay between us.

This way, please.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Y-Yes. We&#39;ll be right along.</p><p><strong>PB:</strong><br> Thank you for your understanding.

I wonder if it&#39;s a form of telepathy?</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Yes.

The CEO will be seeing you now.</p><p><strong>PB:</strong><br> Please wait here. I pray your negotiations with the CEO will brighten the future of the world.</p><p><strong>PB:</strong><br> Well, not that I have much in the way of sentience and self-awareness...</p><p><strong>PB:</strong><br> Now, if you&#39;ll excuse me, PB shall be taking his leave.</p><p><strong>Ibuki Dōji:</strong><br> How courteous.

Farewell, humans.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> Truth be told—</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> I am a little surprised.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> You are aware that you&#39;re inside a Reality Marble, right? I can spawn as many familiars and as many beasts as I see fit.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> In fact, I did just that. And you all had no other choice but to scamper away.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> The difference in strength between us is as clear as a financial statement. The fact that you boldly waltzed in here regardless means—</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> That you&#39;re here to show off some fresh idea?</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> No, no. First comes gratitude.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Thank you for starting this with a dialogue. And we too are surprised.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Of course, we are surprised that you&#39;re here to converse with us like this. But also surprised by PB&#39;s existence.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> To think you would create an entity capable of human speech in this domain.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> I figured that you—</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> That you loathe everything about humanity.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> Yes. That I do. However, disgust and appreciation are entirely separate matters.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> They will receive some respect from me, regardless of what lies inside, so long as the business they conduct is satisfactory.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> Well, such a case is extremely uncommon. Hence, PB.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> I would also like to thank you for conversing with him as an equal.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> PB happens to be a favorite of mine.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> (An extremely uncommon case...)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> (I wonder who that is...)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> (It&#39;s hard to imagine it, but I am curious...)</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> (Fooufoou...)</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> An extremely uncommon case, is it? I see.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> It&#39;s rather disappointing that I&#39;m not this person, Miss Tamamovitch Koyanskaya.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> Oh my—</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> Have you come to refer to me as Koyanskaya? I could&#39;ve sworn you were using another woman&#39;s name to refer to me.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Yes. I was mistaken.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> I must have unwittingly insulted you.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Taigong Lü Shang formally offers his apologies, Miss Koyanskaya.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> Oh, dear—</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> Those heartfelt words of apology are touching indeed. However—</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> As one hand reaches out to me, the other reaches for the gun hidden behind you, am I wrong?</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> For that is how humans hunt. For that is the hidden nature of man. Isn&#39;t that right, Mister Taigong?</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> There is no hidden nature. To miscall one is to disrespect them.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> I have heard that a fellow Chinese hero committed this same folly before, though he was of a Lostbelt.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> I cannot speak on his behalf...but we truly have given you a hard time.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> ...very well.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> I accept your apology. Courtesy is one of the few virtues that humans possess.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> No matter what may come after this, I will not desecrate the dead.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> Oh, is something the matter?</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> One of our few virtues. That may be so.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> We humans may have reigned as primates on this planet, but the cost of maintaining our culture and civilization is beyond imagination.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> We snuff out many lives just by living and going about our business.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> If monsters consuming far beyond the speed of their own reproduction are to be humanity&#39;s true nature. If that is to be our sin...</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> then the virtues brought about by civilization, society, and cultural exchange are far too small in comparison.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> Yes. Those few accomplishments hardly make up for that true nature.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> Apes who transformed their ecosphere from a circle of circulation into one of consumption...</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> No, that would be an insult to apes. As far as they are concerned, humanity may as well be alien life forms.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> You who feel guilt towards the higher order of animals that call this planet home, yet mark them for consumption all the same without exception.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> ...well, the fact that the opposite is also true is what makes humanity incorrigible though...</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> They truly are loathsome, considering both their virtues and vices.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> Seeing how you&#39;ve traversed this world, I&#39;m sure you already know.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> The reason I exist?</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> Of what I do behind the Alien God&#39;s back while I supported its invasion?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You long for humanity&#39;s downfall.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> ...Fufu.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> You want to witness the extinction of humanity.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> Oh, spot-on☆</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> My objective, my ideal, is without a doubt the &quot;total annihilation of humanity&quot;.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> But if I were asked whether I wish to annihilate them with my own hands, I would say no.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> I&#39;ll leave the hard work to the Alien God.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> I could not care less about Pan-human History and the Lostbelts.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> I simply want to watch and enjoy.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> A swarm of conceited, paltry egos screaming, whimpering, and floundering—</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> Being whittled away without ever achieving anything, until the last of them dies in tears.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> To see that with my own eyes is my wish. Aesthetics, shall we call it?</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> After all, I wouldn&#39;t be able to make an assessment otherwise, would I?</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> Of how empty, small, and revolting the last thing humanity leaves behind is.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> Creatures who will expire in a few millennia despite gaining wonderful technologies and knowledge.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> Multiplying without caring for their brethren, without healing the earth—</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> An ecosphere where the ignorant strong ultimately trample on the ignorant weak.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> I will record its final moments and put it on auction for everyone else in this universe.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> &quot;Just how much worth does this civilization have?&quot;</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> Isn&#39;t it just exciting? I wonder what its final price will be?</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> A trillion? A hundred million? Ten thousand? A thousand? No, I can only hope to get any value out of it.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> In the end, trash is trash. Is there someone who would pay even a single yen for it?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> (Stare silently)</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> ... ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> (Silently bite lip)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Senpai...</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> ...H-Hmm.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Good grief, this is—</p><p><strong>Nikitch:</strong><br> Aha!</p><p><strong>Nikitch:</strong><br> From what I&#39;ve heard, you&#39;re an extremely heartless fiend.</p><p><strong>Nikitch:</strong><br> I thought I could find common ground with you after seeing what life was like in the Life Zone,</p><p><strong>Nikitch:</strong><br> But you&#39;re just—just—</p><p><strong>Nikitch:</strong><br> How do I say this? You&#39;re just mocking the failures of others, hu—</p><p><strong>Nikitch:</strong><br> No, I won&#39;t say that. In any case! Even a starving dragon has better things to do!</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> ...who is this person?</p><p><strong>Nikitch:</strong><br> I&#39;m a bogatyr of Kiev. I came here to save the land of Russia.</p><p><strong>Ibuki Dōji:</strong><br> And I&#39;m Ibuki-Douji. I haven&#39;t introduced myself yet, have I?</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> Thank you for the courtesy.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> I did check, but it was too much of a hassle to ask for each name, so that helped.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> Mister Taigong. And dignitaries of Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> Shall we wrap up our conversation here?</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> I am tired after what happened with Cernunnos, but you played nice with PB, so...</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> I was touched by that, and so I ended up playing along with this conversation.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> But this is as far as that goes.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> It is true that our relationship thus far has been that of &quot;friends&quot;, but let&#39;s end that here too.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> —Huh?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Friends...how come?</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> Oh dear...to think you hadn&#39;t realized.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> Your priority is to excise the Fantasy Trees. My priority is to collect life forms.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> We were never enemies.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> I was living it up in the Lostbelts as a tourist. In that regard, we are cut from the same cloth.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> —</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> But not this time. You all came to this world to kill me.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> Words were unnecessary from the start.

In either case, that was a bad call for those calling themselves primates.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> It will no doubt be a fitting end for ones who have erred repeatedly like you.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> I shall only respond to ephemeral actions with ephemeral games.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> Oh—there is no need to cry out the Beast&#39;s name.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> For it is out of spite that I name myself before humanity.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...magical energy levels, rising rapidly!</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> This is where the real deal begins. The nature of her magical energy is completely different from the shadow earlier!</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> The spell protecting my Saint Graph is being corroded...it corrodes all that belongs to the Human Order.

So that I won&#39;t get worked up on the final stretch.)</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> (You truly are blessed, Taigong!)</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> (In the past, it was Yang Jian, King Wu Cheng, and the Twelve Immortals!)</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> (Now, it&#39;s Nikitich and everyone from Chaldea!)</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> (Allow me to live up to their expectations then.

It&#39;s hot, and there&#39;s this monster there!</p><p><strong>Hiryuu:</strong><br> This one looks to be stronger than that bastard Gorynych!

Implosion.Defiled remains that warped space and time.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> That is how this beast came to be.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Not due to legend, not due to history.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> But a conglomeration of prayers and roars begotten by disasters, nature, and man.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> A Nature Spirit entirely unrelated to the Human Order despite possessing a natural Saint Graph.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> The disaster that befell this land triggered her genesis.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> She smiles a wicked smile amidst the flames, with that unsightly form of hers. The Saint Graph composed of screams and anguish felt pleasant.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> It&#39;s the same. It&#39;s all the same. Death by disaster and death by plunder, it&#39;s all the same.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> —It&#39;s just all so fun. The beast smiled as a matter of course.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> The voices of the animals who continue to fall prey to man were like raindrops washing the filth off her body.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Humans don&#39;t keep their promises. They never do.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Killing in the name of survival, using it to live. All of it is so that a better cycle may be established.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> The animals born on this planet were aware of it from birth, as inhabitants of this planet.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> That this is the way nature works. That the longer a species lasts, the more life they consume.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> But humans have forgotten that promise. They have forgotten their responsibility.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Of all things—they coexisted with animals for purposes unrelated to the advancement of their species.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Then, for what purpose?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> For what reason did the earth suffer such bloodshed?For what reason did so many species go extinct?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> There is no answer. Of course there isn&#39;t. Humans never had any semblance of a purpose in the first place.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> She feels no anger. Neither does she feel any sorrow.This Saint Graph was borne of a disaster.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> There is no point siding with either humans or animals.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> However, she did feel it was awfully inexcusable.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Coexistence not for the sake of proliferation, but for the sake of happiness.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Procreation not for the sake of preserving the species, but to share joy.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Cherishment. As a living being, that love is a paradoxical one.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> In nature, love is what those who nurture their offspring possess.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> But, for the beast—for me, emotions nurtured for the sake of rapture are nothing short of incomprehensible.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> However.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> &quot;You who have scarred the earth. You, borne of an earth cleansed of life.&quot;</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> &quot;O beast of curses.&quot;</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> &quot;Those who rejoice at your birth may be few.&quot;</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> &quot;However,&quot;</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> &quot;you may at least have a name.&quot;</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> &quot;Yaskaya.&quot;</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Did someone name me?Or was it a name I gave myself?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Ya...skaya...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Yan...skaya?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Koyanskaya. Koyanskaya.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Koyanskaya—</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I understood, at that moment, that these feelings were evil.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> They defy the law of nature. It is still too early for life to possess them.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Even a divine being would fail to rein in these feelings.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> These feelings will surely warp all life born on this planet.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Just as there were humans who loved animals,and were felled by those same animals.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Just as there was a god who loved humans,yet was renounced by those same humans.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> —I see. Then I shall take on that form.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> In 2017, the seat of the fourth was vacated, and so I incarnated in its place.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> If to cherish is to be evil, then I shall abide by that logic as an Evil myself.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I shall follow in the footsteps of the god who was once denied that love.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Without a biological father, without a biological mother.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Nothing to inherit from a father, nor born from a mother, I became a solitary existence.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> To what end?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> —To understand true love, of course. A mother&#39;s love.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> However, I lack a mate. On this planet, my existence is one of a kind.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Therefore—</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I decided to adopt children.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I travelled the Lostbelts, rounding up grotesque children befitting the grotesque me.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> The children I adopted were brought into my tails where they would offer up their souls and genes.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> It did not come naturally to me. It was based on a legend handed down to this Saint Graph.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> &quot;The nine-tailed fox gave birth to many lives from its tails. Evil spirits from all over Japan were born in that moment.&quot;</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> A legend of one endowed with the traits of a beast, just like me.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> A nine-tailed beast. A Golden White Face.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I imitated its nature. I decided to obtain nine tails and nine children.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> However, I was particular about the children I chose. They must not be from a land dominated by the Human Order.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> For I do not belong to the Human Order. Because I reject humanity—</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Therefore, neither should my children be a part of human history.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> So I looked to the Lostbelts.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Worlds far removed from the Human Order, living yet dead.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Grotesque creatures that can only live in such worlds are the ones worthy of becoming my children.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> —The first.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> —The second.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> —The third.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> —The fourth.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> —The fifth.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> —The sixth.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I birthed many lives using the information I acquired as their basis.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Before I knew it, a forest had formed.Before I knew it, a river had formed.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> They will not be killed by humans.For not a single human will be born here.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> They have no need of an ego.They have no need of self-awareness.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Under the guidance of the law of the jungle, within the ceaseless circle of life,</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> the animals will live as they will, then die, then live, then die and then live—</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> And someday—</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> May I—</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Nikitch:</strong><br> Ooohhhhh!</p><p><strong>Nikitch:</strong></p><h4 id="i-can-do-this" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#i-can-do-this" aria-hidden="true">#</a> I.

You are the lamentations of the animals that perished.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> You are the pain that nature felt. You are its scream. You are the wailing of an abrupt death.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> You are, so to speak, the curses and anguish seared into the land of Tunguska.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> You are the beast formed from their union.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> —Miss Tamamovitch Koyanskaya.</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> You are, so to speak, the curses and anguish seared into the land of Tunguska.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> You are the beast formed from their union.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> —Miss Tamamovitch Koyanskaya.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The explosion of Tunguska...then that means that she&#39;s...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The embodiment of a concept...?</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> The Tunguska event made flesh!?</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> N-No, well...it is hard to rule that out entirely.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> There have been cases of concepts becoming Heroic Spirits, and it can even be said that tinkering with concepts is the ultimate goal of magecraft.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> You can call it a phenomenon all you want, but as far as human history is concerned, a colossal disaster of global scale is not an event it can afford to ignore—</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> In other words, it wouldn&#39;t be a stretch if it became a Ghost Liner!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Yep. The director&#39;s spot-on. There&#39;s no doubt that Koyanskaya is a Servant.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> The fact that she&#39;s an Alter Ego is proof of that, since they&#39;re modelled after a &quot;different aspect&quot; of a preexisting Heroic Spirit.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> That is, of course, assuming Taigong is correct. Though I do believe he&#39;s certain of it, considering he&#39;s made this sort of assertion...?</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Well, I guess I am.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> That is the answer I grasped from the spiritual core of her Saint Graph. It was a technique with plenty of irksome activation conditions,</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> but I did manage to trigger it. I mean, it scared the daylights out of me.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Oh, by the way, Fujimaru was the one who gave me the final hint.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Did I do something...?</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> ...since when did you take up magecraft?</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> It&#39;s called fangshu. You could also refer to it as sage arts.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> It is rather unlike Western magecraft in terms of versatility. It requires a lot of effort, but depending on how you set it up, well. You see,</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> quite a lot of things can be done with it.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> Huh. Like eavesdropping on a lady&#39;s secrets?</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Yes, indeed.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> I had a look at your true nature.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Let&#39;s give you an example, Miss Koyanskaya. You—</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> don&#39;t give a damn about humanity, do you?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> !</p><p><strong>Ibuki Dōji:</strong><br> Heh.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> ...w-wait. That can&#39;t be right.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> That atypically savage cruelty! It is a show of sadistic obsession with humanity!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> I-If she doesn&#39;t give a damn, then why would she...</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Yes. It&#39;s precisely because she couldn&#39;t care less that it becomes a routine for her.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> I&#39;m sure she does hate and loathe humanity. But not to the extent that she will act personally to cause human extinction.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> She will mess with it, at best...of course, that in itself will result in a lot of bloodshed.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> But when push comes to shove, finding amusement in witnessing humanity&#39;s downfall is all the interest in it she can muster.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> That&#39;s because the truth is that she couldn&#39;t care less.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> ...s-so what&#39;s the truth? What do you have to say for yourself, Tamamovitch Koyanskaya!</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Ibuki Dōji:</strong><br> Oh dear, giving us the silent treatment?</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Grngh.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> —In 1908 AD, a massive explosion occurred in the Tunguska forest zone.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Light and heat came as a result of the great explosion. A shockwave. Those final moments that came all too suddenly...</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> I&#39;m sure there must have been animals who believed it was gunfire brought about by human hands.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> But the truth of it was that their lives were snuffed out by that explosion.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Those grudges against humanity simmering deep within you. They are, simply put, residual thoughts that clung to you...</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Nothing more than a texture.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> That is why you cannot bring yourself to be serious about human extinction.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Anyone who lays eyes on this ecosphere will understand what you long for.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> That&#39;s right. You have something that takes precedence over human annihilation.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> I&#39;m sure you understand it too, don&#39;t you, Fujimaru?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...Yeah.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> ...It&#39;s probably because of that incompatibility—</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> ...Honestly. The Human Order&#39;s Counter Force, I take it?</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> I have perused the records of the Seventh Singularity. It was truly repugnant.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> It had the gall to prepare all these Heroic Spirits to use against me.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> Or is that diversity, by any chance, Pan-human History&#39;s greatest asset?</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Yes, I do feel sorry about that. After all, it has been over 10,000 years.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> We have all the right people in the right places on our side. A whole assemblage of specialists to ward off calamities.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> It would appear so. I was on the receiving end of that, and I lost.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> Good grief. I suppose I reap what I sow and am getting my just deserts. My fault for incurring a needless curse and dragging my feet.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> I knew that if I wanted to kill you all, I would&#39;ve had to do it in person.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> ...oh well.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> It&#39;s not as though I&#39;ve suffered a loss or anything. So I hold no regrets and feel no bitterness over that.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> ...the fourth Beast.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> Now that Primate Murder is no longer with us, I figured I&#39;d be able to take root as the fourth Beast,</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> but that turned out to be an ephemeral dream.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> Could it be that this planet has it out for me?</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> I yearned to be a Beast, but I couldn&#39;t make it. My dreams were shattered and I ended up being trampled by all you fine people from Chaldea...</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> Yes, I&#39;m about to lose it with all this frustration and wrath♡</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> Alrighty. Now that it&#39;s come to this, I guess I&#39;ll self-destruct and blow up the whole territory☆</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> !</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Woah, woah, woah! That&#39;s bad news! You may be saying it cutely, but I know you&#39;re serious, Koyanskaya!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> This woman is the type of lady who embodies the spirit of dragging everyone down with her!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Foou, foooou!</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Hmm.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> If I may offer a suggestion—</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Shall we put an end to this? This Beast candidate and Alien God apostle business. All of it.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> This hounding Chaldea and human history business too. We&#39;ll put it all behind us.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> Huh?</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Hmm?</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> I hereby propose a third option, one that does not demand the death or extinction of either party.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> So I invite you to accept this, Miss Koyanskaya.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> After all, you couldn&#39;t care less about humanity, do you?</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Do you not think it&#39;s absurd to stake your life over something you couldn&#39;t care less about?</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> ... ...</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> ...I see. You have a point.</p><p><strong>Meunière:</strong><br> Old man!?</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> N-N-No, that&#39;s not what I meant. I am definitely not referring to how my feelings have changed or anything!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> I simply came to this conclusion as a result of valuing my own life! The entirety of this domain is Koyanskaya, is it not?</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> If she self-destructs, we&#39;d have nowhere to run! In that case, reconciliation ought to be a viable path!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Besides—besides,</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> ...this is not a Lostbelt. It&#39;s not a Lostbelt.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Our interests aren&#39;t mutually exclusive. There&#39;s no reason why we ought to be killing each other...</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> There&#39;s no need to come to blows...if we can settle this through dialogue.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Isn&#39;t that right, Fujimaru? No, young Master of Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Not a ruthless magus by birth, but an ordinary person bearing a heavy burden forced upon him by circumstances.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> You, of all people, should understand this...probably...far better than anyone else.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> —Director Gordolf—</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> ...Yes...Yes!</p><p><strong>Ibuki Dōji:</strong><br> Hnn. I get it, Goffie.</p><p><strong>Ibuki Dōji:</strong><br> Waging a war to pulverize the enemy can be such a pain in the ass!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> There must&#39;ve been a better way to phrase that!That just now was probably one of the three high points of my life, wasn&#39;t it!?</p><p><strong>Ibuki Dōji:</strong><br> Sorry, sorry. Looks like being straightforward isn&#39;t a strong point of mine.</p><p><strong>Ibuki Dōji:</strong><br> But I was serious about that, okay?</p><p><strong>Ibuki Dōji:</strong><br> The effort outweighs the reward, and all that remains are piles of corpses and rivers of blood. That&#39;s what a war of eradication is, no?</p><p><strong>Ibuki Dōji:</strong><br> That&#39;s what this proposal is, avoiding it, right? I didn&#39;t say anything wrong, did I?</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> —</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> —Now this is a surprise.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> Although I believe His Excellency Gordolf harbors double or even triple the grudge against me, does he not?</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> I do! The mistakes I made at Chaldea, the countless crimes you committed! I will never forget them!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> But that is irrelevant! I will punish myself for my own foolishness!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> And you can settle your sins on your own!</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> How cold of you. You were third-rate to the very end, Your Excellency.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> I speak of you as a magus, of course.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> Well, losers can&#39;t be choosers. Do what you will, whether that&#39;s killing me or sealing me.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> It&#39;s a half measure, either way. Even if you get rid of me, a second and a third—</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> No. I&#39;m telling you we have a third option in store.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Pan-human History is cruel, that is a fact. There&#39;s never enough tickets to board the ship.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> I have a good eye for this, so I&#39;m well aware of all that.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Chaldea has no other path except that of killing these nonexistent lost probabilities, then moving forward.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> But that does not apply here. That is because your world does not belong in human history to begin with.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> ... ...</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> ...Yes.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Yes. That&#39;s right, you really ought to accept my proposal.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> There is no need to kill each other. It&#39;s a simple matter.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> ...I don&#39;t get it. I have already planted my roots in Tunguska.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> It is the cradle for my eclosion into a mature Beast, and it will remain immobile once it has been laid out. Until I eclose.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> Yet here I am. Utterly defeated.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> As long as I don&#39;t reach maturity, I cannot move a single inch from here.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> The Human Order. Pan-human History. Even if you reclaim those silly things...</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> This world of mine, sitting in a corner of Siberia, may cause an error in the restoration of the Human Order and get in your way, you know?</p><p><strong>Ibuki Dōji:</strong><br> ...Uh-huh.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> That makes sense. As for the details of reclaiming and restoring Pan-human History,</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> there is room for argument. However, that remark of hers remains a possibility we cannot deny.</p><p><strong>Ibuki Dōji:</strong><br> So what do we do? Should I lop her head off, after all?</p><p><strong>Ibuki Dōji:</strong><br> Should we pull a do-or-die move and try beheading her?</p><p><strong>Ibuki Dōji:</strong><br> Hmm, did you not get the message? I meant this girl&#39;s head.</p><p><strong>Ibuki Dōji:</strong><br> If my Master orders me to behead her, then I—</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I really don&#39;t want anyone&#39;s head.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Taigong, didn&#39;t you say you can do something?</p><p><strong>Nikitch:</strong><br> You heard him. Calm yourself, Dragon!</p><p><strong>Ibuki Dōji:</strong><br> ...fiiine.</p><p><strong>Ibuki Dōji:</strong><br> Wait a minute, you&#39;re up and about already? You&#39;re a tough one, Nikichi.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Nikitich, what about your injuries—</p><p><strong>Ibuki Dōji:</strong><br> You see, Mash used the salve that was in her shield on Nikitich.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou fou.</p><p><strong>Si Bu Xiang:</strong><br> Mo. Mo.</p><p><strong>Hiryuu:</strong><br> Heheh, she&#39;s pissed.</p><p><strong>Hiryuu:</strong><br> But that&#39;s what I like about you, big sis Ibuki.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> If I may, folks—</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> This world is a Reality Marble—</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> These are sceneries shaped by your mindscape, Koyan. This is your inner world itself.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> It possesses neither the distortion of the Holy Grail nor a demise comparable to a strange tale.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> In which case, this world is capable of surviving.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Causing an error during the restoration of the Human Order? I see, that is indeed a possibility...</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> So why not elsewhere?</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> —That&#39;s right. Elsewhere.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> A place not of this planet. What about the furthest reaches of that vast, borderless and infinite sky?</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Do you truly believe that there is no place for you?</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> ...!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> A domain that won&#39;t cause an error in Human Order restoration...! You speak of a venture into space!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Theoretically speaking...I do not believe it&#39;s impossible.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Given the capabilities demonstrated by the exterior of the domain, even the harsh vacuum of space</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> should pose virtually no threat!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Regarding the preservation of the atmosphere, we could offer you a Formal Wear with a unique technique woven into it...</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou, foou!</p><p><strong>Ibuki Dōji:</strong><br> Wow. You&#39;ve turned into a motormouth, Mash...?</p><p><strong>Nikitch:</strong><br> Woah, woah. Calm down there.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Yes, well.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Things will work out, as I have mentioned. Listen well—</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> This world is a Reality Marble—</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> These are sceneries shaped by your mindscape, Koyan. This is your inner world itself.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> It possesses neither the distortion of the Holy Grail nor a demise comparable to a strange tale.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> In which case, this world is capable of surviving.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Causing an error during the restoration of the Human Order? I see, that is indeed a possibility...</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> So why not elsewhere?</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> —That&#39;s right. Elsewhere.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> A place not of this planet. What about the furthest reaches of that vast, borderless and infinite sky?</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Do you truly believe that there is no place for you?</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> ...!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> A domain that won&#39;t cause an error in Human Order restoration...! You speak of a venture into space!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Theoretically speaking...I do not believe it&#39;s impossible.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Given the capabilities demonstrated by the exterior of the domain, even the harsh vacuum of space</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> should pose virtually no threat!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Regarding the preservation of the atmosphere, we could offer you a Formal Wear with a unique technique woven into it...</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou, foou!</p><p><strong>Ibuki Dōji:</strong><br> Wow. You&#39;ve turned into a motormouth, Mash...?</p><p><strong>Nikitch:</strong><br> Woah, woah. Calm down there.</p><p><strong>Ibuki Dōji:</strong><br> That&#39;s right, Mash. Woah there.</p><p><strong>Ibuki Dōji:</strong><br> Wait a minute, you look all fine and dandy, Nikichi! You really are tough!</p><p><strong>Hiryuu:</strong><br> As expected! Heheh, that&#39;s what I&#39;m talking about.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Nikitich, what about your injuries—</p><p><strong>Ibuki Dōji:</strong><br> You see, Mash used the salve that was in her shield on Nikitich.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Foou!</p><p><strong>Nikitch:</strong><br> Woah there, Mash. Woah there.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Calm down, Mash.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Let&#39;s hear the rest of the proposition.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Y-Y-Yes.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I just got so excited after suddenly hearing a statement overflowing with romance...!</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> No, that&#39;s quite fine. That sounds about right!</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> This is the third option I am proposing. To temporarily freeze her in space and time, then launch her into space!</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Needless to say, we will set the technique such that it will automatically undo the space-time freeze once you have reached a safe haven!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> No, no, hold on just a minute! What are you prattling on about? Space-time freezing and space travel and—</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Especially the former. You do realize that&#39;s the domain of True Magic, don&#39;t you!?</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong></p><h4 id="allow-me-to-answer" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#allow-me-to-answer" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Allow me to answer!</h4><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Foou!</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> I understand your misgivings, Director. Common sense dictates that having an entire swath of land travel through space is impossible!</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> However, this is a Reality Marble. In the end, it is but the inner world of one life form.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> So, what does this imply?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That if we stop this forced expansion towards the surface occurring at this moment, and revert it back down to its original, humanoid size...</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Yes!</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> I&#39;m certain the mass itself won&#39;t change. But the size is, well, crucial.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Nevertheless, it is beyond my power to launch her into space like this.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> So I&#39;ll tinker with this space a little and shrink her down further. Down to palm size, to be more specific.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> And then I&#39;ll launch her into space!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Foufoou!</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Now, about the space-time freeze, the fact that this is a Reality Marble works to our advantage.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Rather than meddle with space and time itself, we will merely slow the processes of a singular life form down to their utmost limit.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> We will have her enter a state that is similar to a space-time freeze!</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> What do you say, Miss Koyanskaya?</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> What do I...—</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Humanity will, of course, be nonexistent beyond this planet.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Humanity will be nonexistent, but you are free to either aim for Beasthood or expand your own world.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Or you can be a little braver and bestow your children with self-awareness.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> The problem right now is that the planet&#39;s atmosphere is encircled by the branches of the Fantasy Trees—</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> In that case, we just have to open up the sky.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Yes. Please do so.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> In other words...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> We will cut down the Fantasy Trees and restore the Human Order, prime the timing for just ahead of the Human Order restoration,</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> and launch this world into space during that process—Right?</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Spot-on! Now then—shall we begin?</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Hold on a minute here! Hold on, hold on, I said hold on! I&#39;m being left behind as a spectator again!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Space-time freeze!? Space travel!?</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> And we&#39;re not launching a rocket or a space shuttle, but a whole Reality Marble into space!?</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> That&#39;s a funny joke you&#39;ve got there...</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Or not! Calm down, ladies and gentlemen!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Even if you shrink her down, that&#39;s little more than window dressing! Taigong himself has said that her mass wouldn&#39;t change!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> The sheer energy it would require to launch an area of this scale into space! If reaching another celestial body is the objective here, you&#39;d need light-speed travel!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Even a generous donation of three magical energy cores from the Storm Border wouldn&#39;t be enough to cover it, alright!?</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> It is possible. There is a precedent!</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Would you all happen to be familiar with the story of Noah?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Noah...</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> You know, the one with the ark...</p><p><strong>Ibuki Dōji:</strong><br> Oh, so close! I&#39;m so close but I can&#39;t put my finger on it! My head&#39;s all fuzzy!</p><p><strong>Ibuki Dōji:</strong><br> Then there&#39;s this raven that shows up at the end...!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I take it you are referring to Noah from the Old Testament?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It is said that he built an ark and survived a great flood that engulfed the world, along with many other lives—</p><p><strong>Ibuki Dōji:</strong><br> That&#39;s him!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Foou!</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Frankly speaking, the two of us are fellow Grands. I&#39;ve learned a great many things from him!</p><p><strong>Nikitch:</strong><br> Is that so?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Ahaha. So that&#39;s how it is! It sounds a lot more feasible when you put it that way!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Seriously!? Am I the only one feeling like I&#39;ve been bewitched by a fox!?</p><p><strong>Ibuki Dōji:</strong><br> Ahahahahaha. By those nine tails? How smooth of you, Goffie♡</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> T-That&#39;s not what I meant!</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> I may not be as good as Noah is—</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> But for what it&#39;s worth, I am still a direct disciple of Lord Yuanshi Tianzun! I am Taigong, one who stood in life as the equal of the Xians!</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Let&#39;s give it a try, shall we? Even if it should prove impossible!</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Nevertheless, I will require your cooperation.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> I will require you to stay put as I cast the spell.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> How does that sound, Miss Koyanskaya? Will you accept this proposal?</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> ...of course I won&#39;t. Have you gone mad?</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> I don&#39;t give a damn if you&#39;d like to wallow in narcissism and self-pity, but don&#39;t drag me into it.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> I still have a means of dragging you all down with me. If accepting your silly proposal is all I have left, I&#39;d much rather play that card.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> No. You&#39;ll accept, Koyanskaya.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Because this transaction will benefit both sides, right?</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> ... ...</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> ...Jeez, I must&#39;ve cozied myself up to your rabble a bit too much. I would&#39;ve never guessed you&#39;d take advantage of my sole principle.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> Very well. I&#39;ll go along with that plan.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> The first Beast lies beyond dialogue.The second Beast lies beyond parting.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> And the fourth Beast will find a mutual answer, without ever taking up arms.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> —Congratulations, you have successfully subdued a Beast. This fox&#39;s tail lies tucked between her legs.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> Of course, that&#39;s done with great reluctance.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Fujimaru, I must once again ask you to channel your magical energy into me—as much as you can muster!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Take all of it!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> OK, give it your best shot!</p><p><strong>Nikitch:</strong><br> Rejoice, Taigong! For I will applaud you while we&#39;re at it!</p><p><strong>Nikitch:</strong><br> I&#39;m just basing this on my gut instinct here, but this is one of those techniques that&#39;ll make you go splat if you fail, right?</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Ahaha.

All of that at the hands of one species...</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> One after another after another, we eagerly went around driving other species to mass extinction.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> We killed and killed and killed and killed and killed and killed, we did our best to kill and ruin them...</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Countless lives have we snuffed out.

It is true that she did loathe humanity,</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> so I used that as a starting point and, well, I cajoled her.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Still, truth be told, she didn&#39;t seem like she cared much for humanity, did she?</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Both in words and actions.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> As for her not caring, that is the truth and yet an untruth, both a lie and a fact...</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> She loathed humanity, and in fact, she had been looking forward to its extinction.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Nevertheless.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Considering her history—</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> she must have loved them, in truth.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> People. Humans. Humanity.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> No matter how many forests they burn, no matter how many species that drive to extinction.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Even if she should conclude that our existences are incompatible, the primates known as humanity...</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> are no more than a species that lives among nature. One that she loves.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> ...and there are animal species that seek to deepen their bonds with humanity.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> She did not deny that, she did not pluck that away either. And she did not ignore that.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> In other words, she loved humanity.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> ...and that makes her grudge all the more fierce. Her words and deeds longing for the ruination of humanity are nothing less than indisputable truth.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> The existence of the Dead Zone, an aggregation of hatred and bloodlust directed at humanity. The acquisition of her aptitude for human slaughter and the manifestation of her authority.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> They are all genuine.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> You do remember, don&#39;t you? She had even grown great horns indicative of her status as a fully developed Beast.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> She did have those horns—</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...that&#39;s right. We did confirm the formation of large horns on her head.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> (Nod silently)</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Thus, we can conclude this!</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> —Koyanskaya harbors a love for humanity within her!</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Yet at the same time! She also harbors hatred and bloodlust! To the point she herself has grown sick of humanity!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Foufoou...!</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Love in spite of hatred. That dichotomy is by no means uncommon.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> It is not one exclusive to Beasts, for we humans often possess the same.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> You may or may not be aware of it though.</p><p><strong>Nikitch:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Yes.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The Beasts we have encountered so far...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> have at least had such an inclination.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> —</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> So you&#39;re saying that Koyanskaya</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> no longer wished to hate anymore?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> No longer wished to hate—</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes. I feel like I understand, Senpai.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> She no longer wished to hate anymore. I believe that is why she chose to leave for the sea of stars.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Not for the sake of humanity...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...no, for the sake of all animals, including humanity.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Oh, there&#39;s my cue.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Foufoou!</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Dear me, you&#39;re bidding me farewell?

But for what reason?</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> A stray Servant, walking around without a Holy Grail...even though the special territory has been eliminated.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Has the Human Order finally called for my retrieval?</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Or is it simply because I used a Xian-class greater sage art, causing the spiritual core of my Saint Graph to shatter?</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Which one is it, I wonder?</p><p><strong>Ibuki Dōji:</strong><br> Hmm...</p><p><strong>Ibuki Dōji:</strong><br> No way to tell!

She...</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> if she happens to have modelled herself after Daji...the nine-tailed Golden White Face,</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> then our cultural region is partly to blame, all things considered.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> I have to take responsibility for that.

Understood?</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> And...although I intend to say this again after you return,</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> I&#39;ll say it now anyway. Well done on your mission!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> The Koyanskaya Subjugation Operation is considered a success. Be sure to write up your operation reports with that in mind, both of you!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Roger that!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes. Mash Kyrielight, over and out!</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> —O beautiful beast.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> O beast. O woman, more beautiful than anyone or anything, who remains a beauty even after trampling the world and its people.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> You were powerful.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I lost many friends and many comrades.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I will never forget the battles we fought to defeat and capture you. On many occasions, I feared I had lost favor with the heavens.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Eventually we won, the Shang dynasty fell and you were ensnared by the Demon Binder.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> You continued to thrash about.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> You were the epitome of tenacity itself, clinging to life even if it meant being revoltingly mired in mud—</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> You begged for your life, time and time again.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> You cursed the world and its people, time and time again.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> But in my eyes, even that conduct seemed beautiful.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Yes, even in your final moments—</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> &quot;...farewell.&quot;</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> &quot;Daji, the Thousand-Year Fox Spirit. Unsurpassed in beauty and terror.&quot;</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> &quot;Yes, farewell.&quot;</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> &quot;To you I despise above all else. To you I adore above all else.&quot;</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> &quot;I hope you die suffering. More than anyone else.&quot;</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> &quot;Alas, I will not die. I will return to the Kunlun Mountains and become a Xian thereafter.&quot;</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> &quot;Yes, that you will—&quot;</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> &quot;That you will. That...&quot;</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> &quot;...eternal life I could never obtain, no matter how dearly I longed for it.&quot;</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> &quot;You will surely obtain it. Oh, how hateful. Oh, I loathe you so, so much.&quot;</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> &quot;...&quot;</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> &quot;Fine then.&quot;</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> &quot;In that case, you shall live. Cursed by all the beasts, you shall live.&quot;</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> &quot;Cursed, you say?&quot;</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> &quot;Yes, that&#39;s right.&quot;</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> &quot;Until you scoop up every drop of blood shed from my severed head...&quot;</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> &quot;you will forever remain a damned man.&quot;</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> &quot;Fufu.&quot;</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> &quot;Fufufufufu.&quot;</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> &quot;You will dance with those everlasting regrets forevermore in your everlasting life.&quot;</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> &quot;...&quot;</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> &quot;...how fearsome you are.&quot;</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> &quot;Didn&#39;t you know?&quot;</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> &quot;Yes. Yes, indeed I am! I am Daji. The beast fatale, the living calamity, and an Evil of Humanity!&quot;</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> &quot;I will always, always—&quot;</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> &quot;continue to hate, curse, and deplore you.&quot;</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> The story goes that,</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> at the twilight of the Shang dynasty, Taigong Lü Shang became so engrossed in calligraphy</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> that his wife sought to divorce him. And so it was that she left Lü Shang.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Thus the days went by—</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> And the Shang dynasty, no longer favored by the heavens, collapsed. When the Zhou dynasty rose in its place, Lü Shang</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> was granted Qi as his fiefdom for his meritorious achievements as a tactician of the Zhou.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Then his former wife appeared before him and sought reconciliation.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Lü Shang then poured water from a bowl and said this,</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> &quot;Return this water to its bowl. If you can do this, we shall reconcile.&quot;</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Needless to say, the spilt water won&#39;t ever go back into its bowl—</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> That which has passed will never return.What a heart-rending story.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Hmm?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> What actually happened?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Well, about that—</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Hahaha. What can I say—</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> ...Oh?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Where am I?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> ... ...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I don&#39;t get it.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I&#39;ve heard that Heroic Spirits are supposed to be in the Throne, and the Throne has the records of the Human Order and such.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> This blue sky is, well, what I can say, like a dream...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Otherwise, it would have to be an illusion.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Those fun-looking festivals over there are also—</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Hm. Festivals?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Do you perhaps mean those?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> The bogatyr Dobrynya Nikitich won&#39;t be coming back anymore, and since we have no choice but to consider him dead,</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> we must wed his young wife, who continues to wait for him, to a new husband. Not content with making such an absurd proclamation,</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> they even went as far as to plan a wedding resembling a grand festival!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Do you mean those accursed and abominable things!?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> No. That would be strange. Jeez, how far back are we talking?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> But wait, hold on.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> The hero has set out indeed this time. To save the Human Order, or rather, to save the land of Russia.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Hm? Heroic Spirits...don&#39;t leave the Throne entirely, do they?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Oh well. Umm, the point is—</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> In which case...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Not again. Another incident with Nikitich&#39;s wife while he&#39;s away!?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Repeating the same thing over and over. What are you even getting at?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Good grief. I&#39;ll be damned.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Nonetheless...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> If Russia is in danger, I must save it, no matter what.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Nikitich, ever the young warrior. After all, Nikitich can handle most anything.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> ... ...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> ...well.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> ...aside from parenting, that is.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> That&#39;s right, in 1908—</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> In 1908, Dobrynya Nikitich was summoned in Russia.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> As a bogatyr of the Sun Prince, he is not wholly unrelated to the goddess of the sun.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> The luminous goddess of the Orient gently celebrated that newborn life.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> O grotesque life, there is nothing to be afraid of. O screaming life, there is nothing to be afraid of.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> &quot;Even if you fall short of the sun in the heavens, you were born of the light. Therefore, you are a child of mine,&quot; she said.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Yeah. I see, that makes sense.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> And so went Nikitich. To the heart of that great explosion—</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Overcoming all obstacles and enduring all hardships.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Distorted by the power of the fragment of rock that scorched the land of Tunguska,</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> there lay an incomprehensible creature. Uncertain of whether it was a dragon or an insect, he cut it down. And atop the scorched and fallen trees—</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Nikitich met you, a newborn child.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Gave you a name...gave you flesh...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> You were together for a while, but in the end, Nikitich was little more than a shadow. A Heroic Spirit.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> In the end, I couldn&#39;t raise you. I came up short.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I couldn&#39;t accept your curses,I couldn&#39;t accept your screams.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Bearing witness to your end was all I could do.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Forgive me. Forgive me, Yaskaya.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> &quot;I&#39;m sure she&#39;ll forgive you.&quot;</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Oh, it&#39;s you. My beloved spouse.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> &quot;You can find out for yourself someday.&quot;</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> &quot;Yaskaya might just forgive you.&quot;</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Is that so? Is that so?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I doubt that. I do, but,</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Oh...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Oh, but it would be great if she did...—</p><h2 id="epilogue" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#epilogue" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Epilogue</h2><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><ul><li>Human Order Security Clock December 31, 2017 -- Internal Chaldea World Clock December 31, 20XX -</li></ul><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><ul><li>9:30 PM at the dock -- Access restricted within Chaldea Base -</li></ul><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Senpai.

Are we not the heroes who vanquished a Beast?</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> You would think there&#39;d be a reception either at the dining hall or the control room...</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Why are we being held up at the dock?What do you mean &quot;briefing&quot;!?</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Where is Sion Eltnam? Why is she not here!?</p><p><strong>Nemo Baker:</strong><br> I&#39;m sorry, Commander. Sion&#39;s orders.</p><p><strong>Nemo Baker:</strong><br> I&#39;m also itching to provide hospitality here...</p><p><strong>Nemo Baker:</strong><br> But you cannot use the facilities within the base today. Everyone, please return to your rooms.</p><p><strong>Nemo Baker:</strong><br> The Marines will be there to receive you in no time. I&#39;m sure you will get an explanation then.</p><p><strong>Nemo Professor:</strong><br> It&#39;s the end of the year eve~nt. In short, the base is undergoing major cleanu~p.</p><p><strong>Nemo Professor:</strong><br> Sion can be particular about these matters,</p><p><strong>Nemo Professor:</strong><br> I believe she wishes to start the New Year afre~sh.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Eh? Professor, where&#39;s Holmes?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> He was forced out by Koyanskaya&#39;s Reality Marble.

Well, I suppose we should follow the instructions too.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Should I head for the control room while the Chaldea personnel return to their rooms?</p><p><strong>Nemo Nurse:</strong><br> No, Da Vinci. Would you kindly return to the Border&#39;s computer room?</p><p><strong>Nemo Nurse:</strong><br> It seems Sion has some urgent paperwork that needs doing.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Oh, that doesn&#39;t sound pleasant. No matter, I got off easy this time.</p><p><strong>Nemo Nurse:</strong><br> Now then, I must ask everyone to return to their rooms.</p><p><strong>Nemo Nurse:</strong><br> You all did well with your battles thus far.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> A major cleanup...I take it the Marines are cleaning the common area?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Once I&#39;ve returned to my room, I would like to help out.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Please have a good rest, Senpai.

Haven&#39;t you heard? Everyone&#39;s moving into their new rooms, aren&#39;t they?</p><p><strong>Nemo Marine:</strong><br> That&#39;s why everyone&#39;s packing their bags and assembling at the dock once they&#39;re dooone!</p><p><strong>Nemo Marine:</strong><br> You have 30 minutes! Oh, you don&#39;t have to clean your roooom.</p><p><strong>Nemo Marine:</strong><br> Sion said &quot;You won&#39;t be using them anymore either way!&quot; Alright then, let&#39;s hurry!</p><p><strong>Nemo Marine:</strong><br> Captain also said &quot;Be punctual&quot; with this stern look on his face!</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> So, you&#39;ve made a safe return to Chaldea Base without a single casualty.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Congratulations on your successful Beastextermination.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Great news all around! That takes care of one of my worries!</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Now we just need the decisive spell employing the essence of the Holy Sword that you obtained in Britain—</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> If we can devise a method of attack that&#39;s geared toward anti-Alien God usage, we&#39;ll finally be able to challenge our enemy on their home turf!</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Hmm. Miss Sion, when you say home turf,</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> do you mean to say that the Alien God will deploy a Reality Marble-like domain, much like Koyanskaya did...?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> That this prediction is your other worry?</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Oh, did I mention that I only had one other worry?</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> I had every intention of keeping it a secret. I didn&#39;t even let Captain in on it.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Come now, anyone could have ventured a guess from your tone.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> You made no comments on the contents of Chaldea&#39;s operations, yet you had some rather strong opinions on our operational methods.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> It was all so that you could herd us into resolving those worrisome predictions only you foresaw, one after another.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> And now the greatest &quot;obstacle&quot;, Beast IV, has been ousted.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> I had figured that Beast IV was your final worry...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> However, now that you claim there is &quot;one more&quot;, I may have misunderstood that last one.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> There can&#39;t be that many factors that exceed Beast IV.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> In which case, is it not natural to assume there is but one factor left?</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Spot-on, broadly speaking. As expected of Sherlock Holmes.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> There is only one factor left I wish to sort out before we confront the Alien God.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> What might that be? To shed light on the Alien God&#39;s true identity and nature?</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> No. That can only happen when we do confront the Alien God.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> This &quot;last worry&quot; of mine is something far simpler.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> It can&#39;t be helped if you don&#39;t understand!</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> After all, this is a matter even you have overlooked, Holmes.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> I mean, I can&#39;t help but laugh. There&#39;s just no way you could&#39;ve seen this.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Since it slipped past even SHEBA&#39;s eyes, this is a problem neither of us could have done anything about!</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> ...?</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> ...welp, this is hardly the time to be cachinnating in despair.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> I&#39;ll leave the transport of the Saint Graphs to you, Holmes.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> On the off chance something happens, I&#39;m certain you can carry them to the Border, unlike me.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Right now, Chaldea Base is in an extremely perilous state.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> I cannot guarantee your safety with my Thought Acceleration and Memory Partition alone once ten minutes have passed.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Please hurry over to the Border and deliver the graphs to Da Vinci.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> You cannot guarantee my safety...would that mean your personal computing power is unable to ascertain the future?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> In which case, why not use TRISMEGISTUS II, the far more powerful computing unit?</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> I can&#39;t use it. The machine behind me is just a paper tiger.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> I&#39;ve already moved its contents elsewhere, and they&#39;re currently being rebooted.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> —! Then moving the Saint Graphs means...!</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> It&#39;s exactly what you think it means. I&#39;m glad you&#39;re quick on the uptake.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> ...just between you and me. During this mission,</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Chaldea should have suffered heavy casualties according to TRISMEGISTUS II&#39;s prediction.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> ...it even went as far as to conclude that &quot;the end result is defeat&quot;. Does this ring any bells, Holmes?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> ...of course it does. Reading those logs earlier chilled me to the bone.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Beast IV was harbouring a minus when it eclosed. It was the curse it incurred in Britain.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> That curse drove Koyanskaya into a corner, forcing her to undergo &quot;rapid maturation&quot;...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Yet their defeat was inevitable. And by that, I do not mean they were unable to defeat the Beast.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> They were destined to be annihilated the moment [♂ he /♀ she] set foot in that domain and fought at its epicenter.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Correct. Beast IV was ready to annihilate the entire domain. &quot;The hunters shall die with their prey&quot;—</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> That was the nature of the trap it had set up.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> If survival means victory, Chaldea should have lost. However...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Yes. The Heroic Spirit Taigong and Director Gordolf&#39;s personal feelings.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> And a decisive word from the Master, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Those miracles were what stopped Koyanskaya from self-destructing.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> —And so &quot;mutual slaughter&quot; turned into &quot;peaceful dialogue&quot;. As a result, there were no winners or losers.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Yep. A wonderful ending. Just what I expected of Chaldea!</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> But...</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> ...according to TRISMEGISTUS II&#39;s prediction, Chaldea will be annihilated today.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> A truly inevitable doom. Because the &quot;defeat&quot; comes after this.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> &quot;Warning. Warning.&quot;</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> &quot;Gravitational fluctuation confirmed 3,000 meters above the Wandering Sea.&quot;</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> &quot;Corresponding phenomenon sample: Olympus.Corresponding entity prospect: U-Olga Marie.&quot;</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> &quot;A pseudo-black hole formed via the manifestation of the Alien God.&quot;</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> !</p><p><strong>U-Olga Marie:</strong><br> An island that drifts along with the imaginary sea. A shadow cast by isolated space and time.</p><p><strong>U-Olga Marie:</strong><br> —Hmph. An impressive idea, by Earthling standards.</p><p><strong>U-Olga Marie:</strong><br> Even an omniscient vision capable of observing the world of subatomic particles would fail to detect something that does not exist in this era.</p><p><strong>U-Olga Marie:</strong><br> They were never in the palm of my hand to begin with. Scouring the seas was naught but a meaningless endeavor.</p><p><strong>U-Olga Marie:</strong><br> In Earthling terms, it would be akin to unauthorized use of radio frequencies...or perhaps, stowing yourselves away in an attic?</p><p><strong>U-Olga Marie:</strong><br> However—</p><p><strong>U-Olga Marie:</strong><br> This is the end for that wretched hideaway of yours! You see? It takes me but three seconds to find you, when I desire it!</p><p><strong>U-Olga Marie:</strong><br> It&#39;s little more than losing face, but I will still make you pay dearly for defying a god.</p><p><strong>U-Olga Marie:</strong><br> Fleas who have played with fire.O unsightly hornet&#39;s nest.</p><p><strong>U-Olga Marie:</strong><br> You will sink and vanish into the sea here!This is my decision as Prime Minister!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> &quot;The presence of the Alien God has been confirmed above the Wandering Sea.

Isn&#39;t the Wandering Sea supposed to be impregnable!?</p><p><strong>Meunière:</strong><br> The gravitational sphere means that thing, right? That pseudo-black hole from Olympus, right!?</p><p><strong>Meunière:</strong><br> The Wandering Sea&#39;s a goner if that thing gets dropped, you know!? What&#39;ll happen to our base!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Is everyone here!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The Chaldea personnel are all accounted for! Everyone&#39;s on board the Shadow Border!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Holmes and Sion aren&#39;t here yet though—oh!</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> I apologize for the delay, but the situation is dire. I will explain later.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> I have the Saint Graphs. Let&#39;s leave at once.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> I would like nothing more than that, but where is Sion Eltnam!?</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> I will blame her later for failing to foresee this while prattling on about &quot;predicting the future&quot;,</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> but she is now Chaldea personnel! We cannot leave her behind!</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Hmm. I&#39;d love to have her hear that line just now, Director Gordolf.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> But let&#39;s prioritize our escape for now. Miss Sion has also suggested as much.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> It appears she will be joining us later.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> &quot;I will keep the Five Gates firmly sealed. Such is the responsibility of one who has rented the Wandering Sea.&quot;</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> She said it would take her 20 minutes to do so.—I take it you understand the meaning of this?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Mister Holmes. That&#39;s...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> We have to go get her...!</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> There&#39;s no need for that, Fujimaru. This is what she said to me.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Chaldea should give priority to escaping. I&#39;ll be sure to catch up with you.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Well, not right away. But I will be sure to make it in time for the final battle.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> After all, that&#39;s why I left the Atlas Institute.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Everything so far is, dare I say it, just as I calculated.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> I may look like this, but I am still a gamer. There&#39;s absolutely no way I&#39;m going to die before I get to see the ending, lololol.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Those were the words of an alchemist of Atlas. I consider them to be truthful.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Here we are as proof of that, well-prepared and boarding the Border.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Da Vinci and Captain are already on the Storm Border, ready to depart.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> From the start, she knew this would happen.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> In which case, she should have made preparations for her own escape as well.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> H...Hmm. You do...have a point...</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> I&#39;d been wondering why we were suddenly told to pack...</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> But I suppose it&#39;s high time the enemy also got serious, considering there&#39;s only one Lostbelt left.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> This would have happened to us, sooner or later...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Yes. We would have had to leave the Wandering Sea at some point. That is why the Storm Border came equipped with living quarters.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> She intended on making the Storm Border our base from the start.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> She said that Chaldea ought not to be affiliated with any faction, not to be under the protection of the Wandering Sea,</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> but an organization composed of those who live in the present, dedicated to preserving the Human Order.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> ...not affiliated with any faction...an organization composed of those who live in the present...</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> ...hmm. That&#39;s it. That&#39;s exactly it, Administrative Advisor.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Meunière! Fujimaru! Kyrielight!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Board the Shadow Border at once! The other personnel are already on board!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> —Roger that!</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Gate of Perpetuation, Seren, line disconnected. Gate of Progress, Eren, line disconnected.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Gate of Preservation, Genon, line disconnected. Gate of Servility, Fusilka, line disconnected.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Gate of Rebirth, Ganu, line—</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Hmm?</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> How may I help you, Professor? Did you perhaps forget something?</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> —Actually,</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> what brings you here?</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> What would bring a magus of the &quot;True Wandering Sea&quot; before a magus of the modern era?</p><p><strong>Mage:</strong><br> You find it strange? This is, after all, our final meeting.</p><p><strong>Mage:</strong><br> I believe a direct, face-to-face greeting is common courtesy, no matter the era.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Oh...that&#39;s right. That is the case.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Unfortunately, our institute has been standalone for quite some time...</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> The culture of meeting in person has all but died out. Replaced with meeting via screens, mirrors, threads, and the net.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> I, too, am a heretic at the Atlas Institute. The techniques imparted by the Eltnams...</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Spiritron threads that directly hijack and access the brains of others...Etherlite, as it is called.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> And perhaps because my doting father spoiled me every chance he got,</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> I&#39;ve come to find meaning in &quot;skinship with other people&quot;.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> As a result, I&#39;ve become a positive person who refuses to use the all-too-convenient Etherlite technique.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> So your concern is most appreciated.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> I am grateful for this opportunity to exchange words with you in person.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> You&#39;re in THAT era, are you not? Shouldn&#39;t the cost of communication be absurdly high?</p><p><strong>Mage:</strong><br> It is indeed. It consumes enough magical energy to wipe out an entire continent.</p><p><strong>Mage:</strong><br> But there was no other use for it regardless.</p><p><strong>Mage:</strong><br> I have received permission from my mentor to splurge at least once for the future&#39;s sake.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Mentor...would you be referring to one of the magi who created the &quot;True Wandering Sea&quot;?</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> I had heard Ganu no longer has anyone left. But it turns out there were two remaining, including you.</p><p><strong>Mage:</strong><br> When it comes to these strange tales,</p><p><strong>Mage:</strong><br> the Gate of Rebirth ought to remain cut off from your era.</p><p><strong>Mage:</strong><br> In any case, the Wandering Sea of 2017 will now vanish.</p><p><strong>Mage:</strong><br> Whether or not I exist has nothing to do with Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Oh, so you won&#39;t scold me despite that my renting this place led to the island&#39;s decimation?</p><p><strong>Mage:</strong><br> Of course not. There is no such thing as decimation for the Wandering Sea. In the ancient past—</p><p><strong>Mage:</strong><br> they built a workshop on a lone island in a distant sea to isolate themselves from the reach of both gods and mankind.</p><p><strong>Mage:</strong><br> Thus, the entire zone vanished from the universe.</p><p><strong>Mage:</strong><br> Drifting astray in space and time. Or you could say it went missing for eternity. No one can observe or interact with it.</p><p><strong>Mage:</strong><br> Except—for these Five Gates.</p><p><strong>Mage:</strong><br> The Wandering Seas that manifest in each era are merely shadows cast by &quot;the Wandering Sea that once was&quot;.</p><p><strong>Mage:</strong><br> Even if the Wandering Sea of 2017 should collapse, that will only be the case for 2017.</p><p><strong>Mage:</strong><br> It will have no effect on either the past or the future. Nor will it affect the true form which has vanished.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> I see. I once thought that individual workshops lie beyond the Five Gates—</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> But they are in fact Time Gates, are they not?</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Gates that allow communication between the Wandering Sea prior to its disappearance and any era.</p><p><strong>Mage:</strong><br> Correct. I too was once a magus who lived in the Common Era. Much like you.</p><p><strong>Mage:</strong><br> I was beckoned by my mentor through the Gate of Rebirth and became a denizen of the other side.</p><p><strong>Mage:</strong><br> You called yourself a heretic of the Atlas Institute. In other words, there is no place for you in this world.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Mage:</strong><br> The number of magi endowed with the teachings of the Wandering Sea are few.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> I am aware. It is said that applications are permitted only once a year, and only one applicant is selected.</p><p><strong>Mage:</strong><br> Yes. However, there are not many who meet the standards required to join us.</p><p><strong>Mage:</strong><br> But if one manages to be present when the gates open, if Mystery and fate align with them, anyone could make the grade.</p><p><strong>Mage:</strong><br> At present, the gate to the Wandering Sea is open—Sion Eltnam.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> No. While I am grateful for your words, I still have something I must do here.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Rest assured, I will ensure the gates are closed. Please feel free to return, Fabro Rowan.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> For you and the Wandering Sea, the Alien God may be an irrelevant matter far in the future...</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> But for myself, [♂ him /♀ her], and Chaldea, this is a problem we must solve no matter what.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> So now is not the time for me to go there. If the gates are fated to open only in this very moment...</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> I must conclude it was simply not meant to be. I&#39;ll try my luck with something else next time.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Thank you for all your cooperation.</p><p><strong>Mage:</strong><br> I see. Then I will leave the cleanup to you.</p><p><strong>Mage:</strong><br> ...one last thing.</p><p><strong>Mage:</strong><br> We did not offer shelter to Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Mage:</strong><br> We offered you an opportunity, Sion. For that bizarre plan of yours.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> —</p><p><strong>Mage:</strong><br> May you have a good journey, Sion Eltnam. Proceed as you wish...no, proceed as you have foreseen.</p><p><strong>Mage:</strong><br> Girl born of the black earth. Like a lone bird soaring across the underworld.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> ...? What an odd metaphor...I have nothing to do with birds or the underworld...</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Well, I suppose I&#39;ll find out someday. I&#39;d better get started on my work!</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> There is no beauty in simply being destroyed. None at all! If we are to be destroyed either way, then self-destructing is the way to go. Self-destruct, it is!</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Now then—</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Let&#39;s see how durable the manifestation of the Alien God is!</p><p><strong>Nemo Marine:</strong><br> Wowow, the surface portion of the Wandering Sea is getting sucked into the gravitational spheeeeere!</p><p><strong>Nemo Marine:</strong><br> This is it, Captaaiin! If we wait any longer, we&#39;ll lose out on speeeed!</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> I know!</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Tomarin, Kawata, Octavia, Chin, Kayan, Elrond, Marcus, Meunière,</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Fujimaru, Mash, Fou, Gordolf, and Holmes are confirmed aboard!</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Storm Border, scrambling! We will hereby leave these waters at full speed!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> T-That is fine and all, but what about that Olga Marie!? Won&#39;t she chase us!?</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Why don&#39;t we launch a preemptive attack!? I mean, look at her. See how defenseless that little girl looks!</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> No, the ship&#39;s armaments at present are not enough to damage the Alien God!</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> If she chases us, then so be it! We&#39;ll outrun her!</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> All hands, take your seats!</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Professor! Shipboard inertial protection at maximum output!</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Bow, transfer the temporal flow of the dimensional drilling to the stern. We&#39;ll use the gap recoil to accelerate!</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> This is going to be the fastest takeoff we&#39;ve ever had! I&#39;ll leave the steering to you!</p><p><strong>Nemo Professor:</strong><br> Yep, got i~t. I&#39;ve already done the calculations, so we&#39;re good to go~.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Fire four Triton Engine units in parallel! Storm Border, taking off!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...what happened...?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> ...did we pull out...?</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Yeah. No pursuit from the Alien God either.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> The ship has now left the North Sea and is headed towards the center of the Eurasian continent.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> We will continue to hold course eastward and head for the Pacific Ocean.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Da Vinci, Holmes. Do you have any other questions?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> What happened to the Alien God? As we left, there was this intense flash of light...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> That was the Wandering Sea&#39;s...no, Sion&#39;s counterattack.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Just like how the Alien God compresses ultra-dense matter to create a gravitational sphere,</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> she compressed the Wandering Sea to an infinitesimal degree, released it, and launched the resultant energy at the Alien God.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Did the Alien God not pursue us because of that damage,</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> or did it not realize we escaped? I can&#39;t tell for sure.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> I see. So she did not simply take it lying down, as expected of an alchemist of Atlas.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> But what do we do now? Sion Eltnam will be back, won&#39;t she?</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Without her, we can neither maintain the Storm Border nor plan our operations with TRISMEGISTUS II, can we?</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Fear not, TRISMEGISTUS II has already been ported over to the Storm.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> That&#39;s what the major end-of-year cleanup was for!</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Well, it&#39;s nothing short of romantic having a massive computer inside an airborne warship!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Huh?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Huh!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Sion—!?</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Thank you for the &quot;we thought you exploded with the Wandering Sea&quot; reaction.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Apologies, but while I may look like this, I&#39;m actually a vam—no, let&#39;s just say I have a unique constitution.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> I shut the Wandering Sea gates and activated the self-destruct sequence! Then I rendezvoused with the Storm Border on my own.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Well, I suppose you could call it existential probability manipulation. Please consider it in the same vein as Yu Mei-ren&#39;s dispersion.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> I see. Alchemists who live in numbers do not see self-destruction...no, self-sacrifice as a good thing.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> What ought to be prioritized is not the subsequent result, but the calculations occurring in the present.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> I take it...all your actions are done with self-interest in mind?</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Yes. The good you do for others is good you do yourself, as they say!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Lead with that, damn it! What an effective way of painting yourself in a positive light!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Don&#39;t make me worry for nothing! I, no, I am an ironhearted commander, so it&#39;s not as though it hurt me.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> But you should consider the feelings of the other personnel, seriously! We don&#39;t want to see any more sacrifices!</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Oh. Is that so, folks?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Yep. Reflect on that.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> For real.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> But I&#39;m really glad you&#39;re okay.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...that&#39;s right, I think everyone else feels the same way.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I&#39;m very glad to see you return safely. Good work on the dismantling of the Wandering Sea, Sion.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> —Are you serious?</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> ...well, I knew all along though. Sion&#39;s sturdier than the average Servant.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> More importantly, let&#39;s go over our plan now that we&#39;ve calmed down.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> From now on, Chaldea&#39;s operations will be conducted from the Storm Border.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> The Storm will fly haphazardly across the earth so that we won&#39;t be spotted by the Alien God.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> We will make landfall only for refuelling and maintenance.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> The Storm may be an outstanding vessel, but even it will reach its limit eventually without a port.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> One more large-scale operation&#39;s the limit. I&#39;d like you to keep that in mind.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Understood. There&#39;s only one Lostbelt left either way.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Once the decisive anti-Alien God technique is complete, Chaldea will assault the seventh Lostbelt.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> —We will engage U-Olga Marie, the self-proclaimed &quot;Alien God&quot;, in combat.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Will that do, Commander Gordolf and [♂ Mister /♀ Miss] Fujimaru?</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> M-Mm. So we&#39;re finally in the endgame.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Very well, let&#39;s do it! But only after we&#39;ve made every preparation possible!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Of course.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> While the tuning of the Holy Sword is no doubt important, we mustn&#39;t forget to analyze the Alien God either.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Is the Alien God really Director Olga Marie? What is up with that form?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Right now, &quot;defeating&quot; her is the only option we have. But as we deepen our understanding of the enemy, other options may present themselves.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Just like they did with Koyanskaya. Isn&#39;t that right, Fujimaru?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Right!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> In that case, we&#39;ll have to get used to our new surroundings.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Let&#39;s split up and work to make the Storm Border a better base than ever before.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> It looks like Sion&#39;s built us a new facility too, no? Things are sure to get busier from here on out~.</p></div><!--[--><!--]--></div><footer class="page-meta"><div class="meta-item edit-link"><a class="external-link meta-item-label" href="https://github.com/r-grandorder/tri-hermes/edit/main/src/Lostbelt/tunguska.md" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" aria-label="Help us improve this page!"><!--[--><!--]--> Help us improve this page! <span><svg class="external-link-icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewbox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path><polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg><span class="external-link-icon-sr-only">open in new window</span></span><!--[--><!--]--></a></div><div class="meta-item last-updated"><span class="meta-item-label">Last Updated: </span><!----></div><div class="meta-item contributors"><span class="meta-item-label">Contributors: </span><span class="meta-item-info"><!--[--><!--[--><span class="contributor" title="email: 59034871+Fgrandorder@users.noreply.github.com">Lib</span><!----><!--]--><!--]--></span></div></footer><!----><!--[--><!--]--></main><!--]--></div><!----><!--]--></div>
