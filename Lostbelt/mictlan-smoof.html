Once Mashu is done scanning, we’re getting out of here!<br> Fujimaru! You—---</p><p>Why are you carrying the corpse!?

The bonds of matter in the space are becoming untangled and there’s a timespace disturbance with no passage before them. Mashu forcibly transports Fujimaru and Kadoc out of there.</p><p><img src="https://i.redd.it/qnwycaz1p18a1.png" alt=""></p><p>Back at the ship, Goredolf does a check on the trio. The trio has gotten some rest and have begun taking preparations for the next Lostbelt. Goredolf congratulates you guys for annihilating Traum as it was safely extinguished. He also holds out hope that Sherlock Holmes will return. Nemo states that everyone such as Muniere, Sion and Da Vinci are working hard to analyze everything and report it soon.</p><p>Currently, the Storm Border is hovering over North America and will take two days to arrive at the Amazon Rainforest in South America. Sion congratulates your return from Traum and advises that energy plays a big factor in summoning Servants.</p><p><img src="https://i.redd.it/6aw69f44p18a1.png" alt=""></p><p>Sion says to Kadoc that she was also convinced that Holmes was an Apostle of the “Foreign God”. There are two reasons why Sion believed this to be true. The first being the Sixth Singularity in which Sherlock Holmes got information by being in sync with TRI HERMES. A mere Heroic Spirit would have their Spirit Origin burst due to information overload. The second was that he stopped thinking about the “Foreign God’s” motive by becoming Chaldea’s ally.</p><p>Sion says that the “Foreign God” wanted him to cooperate with Chaldea. Sion assumed that his job was either “Cooperate up to Point A, but stop cooperating beyond Point B” or “If Chaldea has accomplished Point A, then annihilate Chaldea from the inside.”</p><p><img src="https://i.redd.it/5bwx4cw5p18a1.png" alt=""></p><p>Nemo asks if Sherlock Holmes should’ve came back if he rebelled against the “Foreign God”, but that’s where the mystery lies and the hint on how to approach the essence of the “Foreign God” as Sion says that he didn’t choose self-destruction. Holmes left the stage because as long as he was the Management Advisor then, he’ll live and continue to follow the “Foreign God”.</p><p><img src="https://i.redd.it/0d0lkjrbp18a1.png" alt=""></p><p>Da Vinci appears over the transmission and says that Specimen: E yielded bonus results for her. There was a Virus Data Bomb just hiding in that corner of space. If she opened it, then it’d explode, but Goredolf yells at her to stop, put the lid on and go outside. Moriarty interrupts the transmission.</p><p><img src="https://i.redd.it/x3w78mjdp18a1.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong></p><blockquote><p>Ah, test, test. Can you hear me? Is this even shooting properly?</p><p>Oh. Alright, that’s a nice angle. Unfortunately, there’s no chairs around here, so I’ll have to just stand.</p><p>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Or good evening. I am the evil genius, James Moriarty.</p><p>By the time this file is opened, I would have already disappeared. Truly unfortunate.</p><p>I prepared this just in case something happened, but this is a pre-recorded Moriarty video.</p><p>Now. I know we’ve been through a lot, but let’s wash that away please.</p><p>I wanted to save the world. It’s a heavy burden for Chaldea, no, for Fujimaru.</p><p>I can effectively save the world.</p><p>It’s because I have a lot of pride.</p><p>This is not to alarm Master Fujimaru.</p><p>Since I was too shy to directly tell you, I’ll tell you here and now.</p><p>I do not acknowledge Fujimaru. I want you to never be mistaken about that.</p></blockquote><p>Mashu:</p><blockquote><p>I apologize. May I delete this video?</p></blockquote><p><strong>Guda:</strong></p><blockquote><p>Hold on.</p><p>Let’s hold on there.</p></blockquote><p><img src="https://i.redd.it/i5nen9ahp18a1.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong></p><blockquote><p>You guys have gained information on “Specimen: E”.</p><p>It’s Chaldea’s job to analyze what “Specimen: E” is…but that’s a bit of a service.</p><p>That thing is not a lifeform of Earth.</p><p>It is the remains of a lifeform that has been concealed, surveyed and experimented on in that facility for about 100 years.</p><p>In its final moments, it screamed out to its brethren, but it seems it called out to the “Foreign God”...</p><p>I wasn’t able to find anything out other than that. But that’s because I missed the readings I needed.</p><p>TRISMEGISTUS II in the Storm Border should be able to reach those answers.</p><p>Now then, farewell, Chaldea. I pray that you guys discover the answers…well, I won’t pray for that.</p><p>Miracles are always bound to happen. Praying to god is something that students do when they’ve forgotten their homework.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong></p><blockquote><p>That bastard, is he trying to be sarcastic!?</p></blockquote><p><strong>Mashu:</strong></p><blockquote><p>He’s a horrible professor…! He’s a bad influence on Master’s personality!</p></blockquote><p><img src="https://i.redd.it/jpx9n77kp18a1.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong></p><blockquote><p>Are Kadoc Zemlupus’s and Mashu Kyrielight’s reactions over?</p><p>Ah, ahem. Let me do you another service.</p><p>With all this good will…or well, disservice I’ve done, I’m at risk of never being summoned at Chaldea in the future.</p><p>Let me be clear, you guys don’t have a lot of time.</p><p>With U-Olga Marie appearing as the “Foreign God”, she plans to further strengthen her Saint Graph.</p><p>There is an “Existence Outside the Domain” that slumbers within South America. This absolute taboo is classified only to the “Department of Lore” within the Mage Association.</p><p>It is a genuine invader (invasive lifeform) on this planet—</p><p>This cosmic being is named “ORT”. Her current goal is to fuse with it.</p><p>Hahaha, are you shocked? Surprised? If so, then that is delightful.</p><p>The time limit draws near. You have no time to rest after defeating me.</p><p>Once the “Foreign God” gets her hands on ORT, we lose.</p><p>You better hurry. Or else, this planet will split in two with all this evil potential it has.</p></blockquote><p><img src="https://i.redd.it/zfobn1dmp18a1.png" alt=""></p><p>Goredolf is shocked by the name ORT while you’re oblivious to that name. Goredolf rephrases a nasty quote about ORT and envies you for not hearing that name even once.</p><p><img src="https://i.redd.it/himxausnp18a1.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong></p><blockquote><p>ORT, huh, well…</p><p>In words you’ll understand, it’s a horror story that spreads around within the mage world.</p><p>They say that “before the Common Era, it was a comic lifeform that landed in South America and anyone who would get close to it would be killed”.</p><p>There wasn’t a single living mage who’d return after stepping into its domain.</p><p>Regardless, whether it was considered too dangerous to leave alone or for scientific interest…</p><p>In the 16th century, a long awaited Grand-ranked mage embarked to South America with 6 fellow Brand-ranked mages.</p><p>It’s the highest rank that a mage can ever achieve in the mage world. A monster able to tackle a country alone.</p><p>A rank below that would be the Brand mages who are jewel-like prodigies with abilities that rival a Grand’s.</p><p>Seven of them collectively venturing is a never before seen event.</p><p>In actuality, it seemed that there was a festive mood in the exploration logs of the campsite they made in the deep forest.</p><p>However…only one mage came back from that exploration.</p><p>“That thing can never be touched. No human on this Earth can do it”.</p><p>“Wait for the next period. We will place our hope onto new evolved lifeforms who’ll come after our extinction.”</p><p>While he was talking, he became a living crystal before the public’s eyes.</p><p>The mage’s name was Astea. One of the twelve lords of the Clock Tower at the time.</p><p>After the incident, the institutional head (the top) of the Mage Association and Clock Tower announced that this lifeform be named “ORT”.</p><p>Henceforth, South America came to be well known as an demon-infested area that humanity should never walk into.</p><p>For mage families who were on the edge like mine, it was a questionable fairytale.</p><p>Look at Goredolf, nobles were told this as if it were a fact.</p><p>Parents would terrify their misbehaving child with “ORT is coming for you”.</p></blockquote><p>Goredolf tells you that if ORT started moving, it’d crush the Earth in seconds as he was told. Nemo confesses that it appeals to his sense of adventure and Goredolf warns him about that attitude.</p><p><img src="https://i.redd.it/81wnnk9qp18a1.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Mashu:</strong></p><blockquote><p>I remembered something. There was a description of “ORT” in Chaldea’s library.</p><p>Currently, “ORT” is affirmed to be the strongest and mysterious lifeform in the mage world.</p><p>It is a tremendous spider-shaped cosmic lifeform that possesses a hard, soft, hot and cold exterior with an energy generation that’s a nuclear fusion reaction in its interior, and touching it would turn you into a crystallized substance.</p><p>We can only hope that humanity’s technology will advance so that we can analyze it in 3000 A.D. It is truly a “Threat to Humanity”.</p></blockquote><p>Sion is confused and ponders why the “Foreign God” would even fuse with ORT when she’s already strong enough as is.

Both seem pretty relieved that there’s no complications with it. Mashu seems to have an easier time with it and with Black Barrel. However, while Mashu is growing stronger and almost equivalent to a Top Servant, Da Vinci places a restriction on Black Barrel. The main usage for it now is “Bombardment via Mana Compression”. The calculation of Life Scale using Accomplish Measure, the formation of the Black Barrel and the creation of Dead Counter are forbidden because it puts too much strain on both the user and the Master. As well as the ban on using it in urban areas since it’ll potentially harm civilians and the effects are wide. This much was relayed to Fujimaru Ritsuka.</p><p><img src="https://i.redd.it/qt8uvihbc48a1.png" alt=""></p><p>Da Vinci informs Mashu that the Black Barrel weaponizes the “Concept of Death” and the Atlas Institute deems it a hazard. Regular Servants as they materialize are created via Ether since they can’t grow any stronger than what they were when they’re recorded in the Throne of Heroes. With the concept of a Demi-Servant, Mashu’s Saint Graph is growing due to her physical and mental growth.</p><p>The problem here is that Mashu is being more Heroic Spirit-like as she continues to live out her days. Da Vinci lectures her by telling her that Servants are “Ghost Liner: Boundary Record Belts”. The more power Mashu seeks, the more she’ll stop being “Demi”. Da Vinci tells Mashu that if she feels bad about something, she can take off Ortenaus and head back to the Border since she has companions at Novum Chaldea. Da Vinci also mentions that Fujimaru or her haven&#39;t given up on Olga Marie.</p><p><img src="https://i.redd.it/jink2ugcc48a1.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong></p><blockquote><p>The ship will soon be passing through Central America! We’ll be going from Mexico to Guatemala without any enemy interference!</p><p>As we travel beyond the Bleached Earth, we’ll approach South America’s “Storm Wall”! Operation commences in approximately 20 minutes!</p></blockquote><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong></p><blockquote><p>A-alright! Novum Chaldea, everyone station yourselves!</p><p>While we are carrying out this operation urgently, preparations have been completed beforehand.</p><p>So there’s nothing to be worried about! Right, Technical Advisor!?</p></blockquote><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong></p><blockquote><p>Of course. We have our ace against the “Foreign God”.</p><p>A sacred sword that’s augmented with the concept of a sacred sword—</p><p>It’s shown to have a 99.99% success rate. So there won’t be any problems with it in battle including the transformation sequence.</p></blockquote><p>Goredolf is amazed and curious about this. He assumes that it’ll be an artillery weapon that’ll be fired once the transformation sequence is completed. Muniere tells Goredolf that the Marines will be the one firing it. Sion digresses and asks Goredolf if he wants to hear about the analysis of Specimen: E.</p><p><img src="https://i.redd.it/dglz4c2gc48a1.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Sion:</strong></p><ol><li>The operating room is on the same level of our civilization. It’s all state of the art equipment.</li><li>“Specimen: E” is an unknown lifeform. TRISMEGISTUS II has no corresponding data regarding it.</li><li>There was a large amount of blood and cells detected in the room, but was wiped clean. This was from a human.</li></ol><p>Analysis is far from done, Sion says. But for now she has stopped TRISMEGISTUS II’s analysis to focus on this mission. You ask if a murder occurred due to Point #3. Sion replies that you have a keen eye, but answers that assuming that it was self-inflicted harm, then yes, a murder did happen.</p><p>Mashu asks if the blood was the result of some kind of operation from the operating table. Sion replies that it is half possible. The reason why it’s not fully possible is that blood would never travel far or even 1 meter from the operating table. Nemo interrupts them by announcing that they’re approaching their destination.</p><p><img src="https://i.redd.it/k8l65b0jc48a1.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Professor Nemo:</strong></p><blockquote><p>TRISMEGISTUS II has recommended that 4 Servants be summoned for this mission~.</p><p>Normally you would use your energy to summon after you’ve landed in the Lostbelt, but Britain set a precedent for us.</p><p>The first Servant who’s been summoned is headed towards the Control Room.</p><p>The other three Servants will join you momentarily.</p></blockquote><p>Goredolf says that what Professor Nemo said is right. Summoning in a Lostbelt is not ideal anymore. He goes on about how South America is an cruel land, therefore the Servant has to be strong, cruel, uncivilized and gorilla-like who acts monkey-like.</p><p><img src="https://i.redd.it/r8lbquyjc48a1.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong></p><blockquote><p>Who are you calling an ape!

You look well, Fujimaru Ritsuka. As you can see, I’ve responded to your wish for assistance.</p></blockquote><p>Nitocris states that she is summoned from Chaldea’s record of Nitocris’s Saint Graph. While she’ll know what Chaldea has experienced with her, for Nitocris, this is her first time meeting them.</p><p><img src="https://i.redd.it/e751dvl2d48a1.png" alt=""></p><p>She introduces herself as Nitocris, the sky god personification and user of the Underworld Mirror. Mashu notices something different about Nitocris. Nitocris responds that she’s in her “ideal state” with all the mana supply she’s getting from the Storm Border. She also has Independent Action attached to her as well.</p><p>Kadoc is surprised that she’s able to act like this and agree to helping Chaldea which makes him assume that she has a lot of faith in Fujimaru. He’s also surprised that she can be this effective with the mana supply she’s been given.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong></p><blockquote><p>Nitocris will be acting as Master’s bodyguard…well, we’re entrusting you to be the bodyguard of the on-field team.</p><p>We expect you to do a lot of walking and exploring in South America. We’ll also need someone who’s adaptable, suitable in group fights and uses magecraft that’s resistant to fever and impurity.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Habetrot:</strong></p><blockquote><p>Hmm. Seems like I’ll be playing bodyguard, huh. That being the case, I’ll introduce myself.</p><p>Alright! I’m Habetrot! I’m sort of like the guardian faerie that dwells in Mashu’s shield.</p></blockquote><p><img src="https://i.redd.it/7901biioc48a1.png" alt=""></p><p>Goredolf is pleased that the number of Servants that are able to help us and raises morale by encouraging everyone to find the Fantasy Tree and chop it down. However, Sion and Goredolf mention that there’s no Fantasy Tree to be detected in the Lostbelt, but there should be a Fantasy Tree equivalent there or a conditional Fantasy Tree (LB6 (withered Tree) and LB3 (concealed Tree)). However, neutralizing the “Foreign God” is top priority.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong></p><blockquote><p>The bow will now commence a dimensional punch!

But if you do, you’ll be reminded of Jaguarman from Babylonia. Mashu says that it is a Nahuatl word for “jaguar” and it is used in Central and South America. Elite jaguar warriors of the Aztec empire and Aztec mythology as well as an alter ego of the war god, Tezcatlipoca. They also could be Elementals lurking in the jungle.

After learning democracy and communism, Tepeu has figured out how politics and society functions and wants to move on to the next topic. He’s amazed at how civilization has evolved over the years.

Tepeu affirms the question and states that since his thought process wasn’t on the same wavelength as the other deinos, he moved to the first layer.</p><p><strong>Tepeu:</strong></p><blockquote><p>Deinos possess no intellect.

But we, deinos, <strong>are a different case</strong>.</p><p>Mictlan has no such threats. Therefore, evolution was unnecessary.</p></blockquote><p>Tepeu is also amazed about the digestive system of the human body, and how it allows you to remove the toxins of a plant and absorb its nutrients.

Mashu talks about Mictlan in Pan-Human History that consists of a Heaven that has thirteen layers, Earth that resides humans and Mictlan which has nine layers. People who naturally die and not through battle go through Mictlan and when they conquer all the trials then their souls return back to nature.</p><p>Mashu also explains about the cruelty of the Aztecs with sacrifices, slavery and perpetual fights.

When the Earth was declined by the gods, it became the world of death. Together with the asuras and the troubled gods, they restored the Earth and that was the stirring of the sea of milk which changed the world’s color from dead to alive. The gods threw everything from the world into the sea of milk to create the immortality elixir, Amrita. Thus, the white elephant, Airavata, came into being.</p><p>Tepeu is interested in what he’s heard from Kingprotea.

However, U-Olga Marie asks why they can’t bring along Kingprotea.</p><p><strong>Rasputin:</strong></p><blockquote><p>We cannot do that, my Lady.</p><p>Even though we liberated the mask, Kingprotea still remains the “Underworld Sentinel”.</p><p>She’ll have to act without a Master like Fujimaru or the Storm Border since she became a “Underworld Sentinel” and has to act within the “Underworld Layers”.</p></blockquote><p><img src="https://i.redd.it/a1sy6g0iux8a1.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Kingprotea:</strong></p><blockquote><p>Yes. I was summoned by the Storm Border, but I fell down to Mictlan without a contract with Master and a mana link path.</p><p>I can act even with my big mana furnace…but that weird bat…Camazotz forcibly influenced me. “I’ll grant you strength if you become a Sentinel”.</p></blockquote><p>U-Olga Marie wants Rasputin to do something about Kingprotea being stuck in the Underworld because she wants Protea free and able to join us.</p><p><strong>Rasputin:</strong></p><blockquote><p>I cannot do anything. While the wound has been removed, we are talking about the Saint Graph itself.</p><p>Kingprotea needs to return to her initial state to leave the Underworld.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Mashu:</strong></p><blockquote><p>.! Then we can leave her for now and summon her back via the Border—-</p></blockquote><p><img src="https://i.redd.it/ctcp5simux8a1.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Rasputin:</strong></p><blockquote><p>If we don’t consider the risks of resummoning, then that could work. Kingprotea is a Divine Spirit Class Servant.</p><p>The chances of summoning her once more is low. But if we summon her again, she won’t be restricted anymore.</p><p>However, even though it may be the same Heroic Spirit and body, you’ll never meet the “one in front of you now”.</p><p>That is the fate of all Servants. Please understand this, U-Olga Marie-sama.</p></blockquote><p><strong>U-Olga Marie:</strong></p><blockquote><p>Why-why is it such an inconvenient system? Who conjured this up?</p></blockquote><p><strong>Kingprotea:</strong></p><blockquote><p>…Fufu. Thank you for feeling bad for me.</p><p>But, it’ll be okay now.</p><p>I’m acknowledged at Xochitonal and got sort of an Alter…</p><p>At least, I don’t have a Master in “here (the first Underworld)” and I can keep going by myself.</p><p>So I’ll be waiting for everyone here. If you guys come back here again, I’ll crush everything for you!</p><p>No enemy can win against me!</p><p>I am Alter Ego, Kingprotea, and Fujimaru’s Servant no matter what!</p></blockquote><p><img src="https://i.redd.it/lboa4vyoux8a1.png" alt=""></p><p><img src="https://i.redd.it/jrqt0hhqux8a1.png" alt=""></p><p>Back to the present, you believe that Kingprotea is strong enough to be on her own. Tepeu doesn’t outright reject, but simply keeps it to himself since he has his own opinion on leaving someone behind. Nemo Marine tells Tepeu if he likes her because of her horns, but still knows that Tepeu worries for her. Tepeu rejects such a question since aquatic lifeforms are difficult to sympathize with. While aquatic and flying deinos are rare and see the world in a different view, those on the ground are the exact opposite, that’s why Tepeu worries for her due to differences in size and shape.</p><p><img src="https://i.redd.it/agblbuxrux8a1.png" alt=""></p><p>Rasputin asks Mashu about their communication with the Storm Border. Mashu responds that <strong>they haven’t had contact in 48 hours</strong> which prompts Rasputin to tell them that they should stop worrying about Kingprotea and focus on the Storm Border and its crew since the worst may have already happened.</p><p>Rasputin alerts the group about the incoming flying insects. He also informs them that they can inflict fever upon contact. Tepeu adds on by stating that it’s the sixth leading cause of death among deinos. <strong>The insects can inject poison through their mouths and it can penetrate through deinos’ bio-waves. Albeit, there’s no damage done, it can “cause pain enough to make them unconscious”.</strong> Rasputin is impressed by South America’s ecosystem and the like.</p><p><strong>Nemo Marine:</strong></p><blockquote><p>What are you laughing for~! What kind of bite gives people pain to the point they die~~~!?</p><p>Fujimaru, do something! Drive them away, drive them away~!</p></blockquote><p><img src="https://i.redd.it/f9hqpvhtux8a1.png" alt=""></p><p><img src="https://i.redd.it/h2otftnvux8a1.png" alt=""></p><p><img src="https://i.redd.it/qlq64n6wux8a1.png" alt=""></p><p><img src="https://i.redd.it/rjnryfc0vx8a1.png" alt=""></p><p>After the battle, <strong>Nemo Marine apologizes for not being useful in his role as a scout.</strong> Habetrot tells Marine that he has nothing to apologize for and that it’s just how the world of Mictlan is. We aren’t accustomed to the land yet, there’s poor visibility, the heat and in addition to being close to the sky. Habetrot reassures Nemo Marine that even Mashu’s Ortenaus couldn’t detect the enemies we fought earlier.</p><p>You cheer Nemo Marine up by saying that even if Marine wasn’t able to properly scout, Marine helped the group in different ways. Marine, in response, strives to be a treasure hunter in South America.</p><p><img src="https://i.redd.it/2vhrpf22vx8a1.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Tepeu:</strong></p><blockquote><p>Let’s rest a bit before that, Marine. Exploring this jungle at night is dangerous.</p><p>A coatl (snake) can sneak in fast before we can detect it. We wouldn’t be able to know there’s a cipactli (big alligator) camouflaged until we get very close to it.</p><p>There were carnivorous insects and berserk deinos lurking nearby.</p><p>They act and move as long as there is sunlight and sleep at night. That is the invariable principle of Mictlan.</p></blockquote><p>Nemo Marine happily goes to be the watchguard for the night. Mashu says that Nemo Marine doesn’t have to do that since there is a frequency that the insect we fought doesn&#39;t like, so they used that to set up an insecticide barrier.</p><p><img src="https://i.redd.it/6bepeh64vx8a1.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Nemo Marine:</strong></p><blockquote><p>Okay! I’ll use my sleeepppping bagggg! I love the comfy feeling~~!</p></blockquote><p><img src="https://i.redd.it/9ic7xxw6vx8a1.png" alt=""></p><p>On the other hand, Tepeu is very amazed at the insect repellent technology that we used. U-Olga Marie disagrees because since humanity is always filling a void that doesn’t need to be filled, they suffer the consequences. She uses nuclear fission as an extreme example and how they discharge harmful substances into the environment which can cause harm in the name of obtaining energy. She concludes that the chart of humanity’s engineering is very complicated and for Tepeu to not rate Pan-Human History very highly.</p><p>You and Mashu ask U-Olga Marie why she wants to be President of the Earth. U-Olga Marie doesn’t want to answer such a redundant question, but will answer anyway as it is her duty.</p><p><img src="https://i.redd.it/qqde8u0avx8a1.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>U-Olga Marie:</strong></p><blockquote><p>I arrived from a hollow planet after hearing the screams of this planet.</p><p>I have no interest in claiming this planet other than the fact that it called me here.</p><p>I do not plan to name myself “Queen” like Camazotz.</p><p>What I should be doing is leading and nurturing intelligent lifeforms that’ll come into use on the planet’s surface.</p><p>An equal governance. A fair history. And wanting to create a world where all races and thoughts are accepted.</p><p>That is what a president is. Someone who supervises, represents and celebrates the accomplishments of all people.</p><p>That’s who I felt like…<strong>I</strong> wanted to become.</p><p>…Ummm. I’m just in a state where I can’t remember a specific plan or a reason for it…</p><p>Anyways! To <strong>me,</strong> that’s what it means to rule.</p><p>For that reason, for that reason…I. I must restore everything to a blank slate once more, for the foolish humans—-</p><p>—---!</p></blockquote><p><img src="https://i.redd.it/itohqxfbvx8a1.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Fujimaru Ritsuka:</strong></p><blockquote><p>Director Olga Marie!?</p></blockquote><p><strong>U-Olga Marie:</strong></p><blockquote><p>…Again, who’s this director? You, whether it be in the palace or now, the amount of nonsense—--</p><p>No, we met in the cave for the first time, right? I wonder why I said palace.</p><p>Whatever. I’ll simply restate it if you have trouble remembering it.</p><p>“I have materialized here to abolish this world’s evils and correct it. I am the leader of foolish humanity, the mighty president”.</p><p>That is me, U-Olga Marie. Is that good enough?</p><p>You’re saying that there’s better “intelligent lifeforms” in the universe?</p><p>Hah—-fool. I did not say that foolishness was a bad thing. To begin with, humanity is not foolish.</p><p>Fundamentally, aren&#39;t intelligent lifeforms the foolish ones?</p><p>The universe updates itself because of the mistakes we make.</p></blockquote><p><strong>U-Olga Marie:</strong></p><blockquote><p>(I sounded sort of proud there)</p><p>(I wonder when my body will listen to me)</p><p>(Human Order output organ, lowered to 4%.

A while ago, U-Olga Marie states that she isn’t interested in disguises so she’ll stay in the forest. Rasputin, on the other hand, will go since he is interested in Chichen Itza, although he’ll bring back souvenirs for U-Olga Marie. Marie says that her butler is too free-spirited. Habetrot will be in Spirit Form for the majority of the trip to Chichen Itza.</p><p><strong>Nemo Marine:</strong></p><blockquote><p>Really? Then, I’ll stay behind!

It is an invention of Pan-Human History. We do not need it.</p><p>We are just laying out what others need. If there is something you want, then feel free to take as much as you’d like.</p><p>The sole deinos standing behind the stand are there for our protection. The individual difference between deinos is big.</p><p>One item could favor a deinos while it could be poison for another.</p><p>Deinos who understand that work as consultants in those stands.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Fujimaru Ritsuka:</strong></p><blockquote><p>A perfect supplying system with no bartering…?</p><p>Why is there no currency involved?</p></blockquote><p><img src="https://i.redd.it/al9n3mid5y8a1.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Rasputin:</strong></p><blockquote><p>…Deinos and humans are different after all. Humans <strong>lack too many things</strong>.</p><p>It is not just nourishment for us to keep functioning. There is also the “happiness” that suffices our mind.</p><p>Seeking better happiness than others. Seeking for more things to have than others.</p><p>It is this type of hunger that compelled humans to invent a method of “efficiently gaining wealth”.</p><p>Currency is the blood that flows through human society, but with all there is, <strong>we are limited to what we can achieve as individuals</strong> in life.</p><p>Just like with deinos and their strong physique and carefree existence, <strong>they lack nothing when it comes to survival</strong>.</p><p>They do not have the notion of “competition”. Everyone is equal and a respected friend here.</p></blockquote><p><img src="https://i.redd.it/frccby6k5y8a1.png" alt=""></p><p>Tepeu states that compared to our world, there is no war or racial differences here. They have a sport named xoqqer which is just a ceremonial competition, but even that is peaceful. Xoqqer is like a priest’s prayer where they express their gratitude for the radiance of the sun and pray for its continuation.</p><p><strong>Rasputin:</strong></p><blockquote><p>The continuation of the sun…Mr. Tepeu, here’s my second question.</p><p>There’s a Central American pyramid…at the heart of this town, is that an altar where the king resides?</p><p>It looks like a Pan-Human History structure. The only difference being—</p></blockquote><p><strong>Mashu:</strong></p><blockquote><p>There are crystals that extend to the sky from the summit of the altar. Like a jade crystal…</p></blockquote><p><img src="https://i.redd.it/koxcz93k4y8a1.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Tepeu:</strong></p><blockquote><p>Hohou, there are sun altars that exist in Pan-Human History?</p><p>The notion of being closer to heaven seems to be never changing.</p><p>That is the reason the holy ground exists within Chichen Itza. The sun begins and ends here.</p><p>It is the “Sun Itinerary”.</p><p>Pan-Human History’s sun is in space and the Earth revolves around it, right?</p><p>However, there is no space within Mictlan as the sun is within Mictlan.</p><p>According to everyone (Pan-Human History), our sun in Mictlan is an artificially made condensed sun.</p><p>The sun starts to move at Chichen Itza, travels to the ninth layer and returns back here.</p><p>That altar is the sun’s “home”. Upon the sun’s return, it closes the sun, give it vitality and send out again.</p><p>That is the mechanism of the sun in Mictlan.</p></blockquote><p>Rasputin learns that from that information alone, he deduces that the sun’s gravity is the earth’s surface and is a sun reliant on the laws of Mictlan. Tepeu corrects everyone on one last thing. The pillars are not crystals, but rather, vegetation. Tepeu notes everyone to notice the sparkling resin. It is the Cosmic Tree (not Fantasy Tree) that pierces Mictlan. Tepeu suggests that we can talk to the Dinosaur King if we just go up the altar. Mashu asks if it is really that simple.</p><p><img src="https://i.redd.it/kj7tfvto4y8a1.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Tepeu:</strong></p><blockquote><p>It is. To be honest, I was once a priest of Chichen Itza.</p><p>Though I ran away from Chichen Itza before the appearance of the Dinosaur King, so I am not acquainted with the King, but I do have a work history…and so-called connections.</p><p>Also, we never decided upon “territory” and “borders”.</p><p>Anyone is able to go wherever they want. Just how the sun makes its round trip in the world.</p></blockquote><p><img src="https://i.redd.it/82eylgcn4y8a1.png" alt=""></p><p>The current priest is automatically angry at Tepeu as the group makes its way to the altar. The current deinos priest tells Tepeu to go back to wherever he dwelled and asks if he is here to boast about his disciples.</p><p><strong>Tepeu:</strong></p><blockquote><p>Not disciples, but more like teachers. I have learned a lot from them.</p><p>That being said, Priest Vucub. I am pleased to see you healthy.</p><p>I’d like to request an audience with the Dinosaur King, would that be alright?</p></blockquote><p><img src="https://i.redd.it/1yutyeas4y8a1.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Priest Vucub:</strong></p><blockquote><p>That wouldn&#39;t be alright…!

So hurry up and get out of here!</p></blockquote><p><strong>Tepeu:</strong></p><blockquote><p>Wait, my house should still be in Chichen Itza.

Tepeu also forgot to congratulate him on getting to the position of Head Priest. Mashu states that we are going to have to find a different approach to this matter. You suggest to find information in order to find collaborators and meet up with the Dinosaur King that way.</p><p>Tepeu says that his house should be relatively safe since it is off the main street. He also wants to invite Nemo Marine and U-Olga Marie over as well and suggests that we all stick together on this.</p><p><img src="https://i.redd.it/n2v4a2ww4y8a1.png" alt="End of Chapter 4 Arrow 3"></p><p><img src="https://i.redd.it/qkheknkd8y8a1.png" alt=""></p><h1 id="arrow-4-3" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#arrow-4-3" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Arrow 4</h1><p><img src="https://i.redd.it/xinfetbm8y8a1.png" alt=""></p><p>Nemo Marine and U-Olga Marie congratulate you on your hard work so far.

Naturally deinos don’t really clean up after themselves, but for Tepeu, it bothers him very much that he has to clean regularly. Therefore, he moved (into the cave in early chapters) to forget about the nuisance of cleaning a home.</p><p><img src="https://i.redd.it/jlfr9znz8y8a1.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Tepeu wants to know about the Chichen Itza of Pan-Human History.</strong> Mashu explains that it was a Mayan city located in South America on the Yucatan Peninsula. <strong>The city continued from 1600 BCE to 900 CE.</strong> Mashu states that before the time period 1600 BCE to 250 CE was considered the Preclassic Period. The Classic Period was from 250 to 900 CE. The Post-Classic Period was from 900 CE to 16th century. Chichen Itza was built by the people of Itza in the Post-Classic Period.</p><p><img src="https://i.redd.it/nmiwe9l19y8a1.png" alt=""></p><p>Itza people were considered “outsiders” or descendants of those who escaped the fall of central Maya. They eventually reached a land with a fertile spring cenote and named it Chichen Itza (At the mouth of the well of the Itza). <strong>Kukulkan, the God of Wind and Water, was the name of the God they worshiped in Chichen Itza and the same god the Aztecs would eventually worship, Quetzalcoatl.</strong></p><p><img src="https://i.redd.it/akn20fl39y8a1.png" alt=""></p><p>Tepeu asks how they fell despite being in the blessings of their God. Mashu explains that when the Mayan civilization fell, the gods disappeared and Central America entered the Age of Man.</p><p>Something that’s actually worth noting in this entire lecture. Mashu mentions the name <strong>Hernan Cortes</strong>. Cortes and his Spaniards fought the Aztec kingdom and emerged victorious. This caused the Aztec kingdom to be renamed into Mexico. Nemo Marine says that it is unbelievable that an army of 500 Spaniards eliminated several thousands in the Aztec Kingdom.</p><p><img src="https://i.redd.it/q1kltnb59y8a1.png" alt=""></p><p>Nemo Marine tells a story about <strong>how Hernan Cortes was thought to be the second coming of Quetzalcoatl by the Aztecs resulting in them treating Hernan Cortes as a guest from a foreign land.</strong></p><p><img src="https://i.redd.it/nd0camxa9y8a1.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Tepeu:</strong></p><blockquote><p>Indeed. Guns are the weapons that the Ocelotl are using, right?</p><p>They are conquerors who arrived from the <strong>outside world</strong>. Oppressing and murdering local tribes with guns.</p><p>This is the same situation with what’s happened in Mictlan.</p><p>The Crypter, Daybit, is the reemergence of Hernan Cortes.</p></blockquote><p>Tepeu wants to know more about Tezcalipoca and Quezalcoatl, but it is getting late so they call it a day here.</p><p><img src="https://i.redd.it/ujt924ja9y8a1.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Rasputin:</strong></p><blockquote><p>But before that, I have one last question.</p><p>Mr. Tepeu. It’s clear that Chichen Itza was not meant for the Deinos.</p><p>Either way, this lifestyle conforms to the humanity of Pan-Human History.</p><p>Who built this city? Who is the Deinos’ “Dinosaur King”?</p></blockquote><p><strong>Tepeu:</strong></p><blockquote><p>Well. The Dinosaur King appeared very recently and is unrelated to Chichen Itza.</p><p>Kukulkan is one who created Chichen Itza.</p><p>It is stated that the Sun God Kukulkan built this city to govern Mictlan.</p></blockquote><p><img src="https://i.redd.it/583d6ngc9y8a1.png" alt="Chapter 4 END"></p><h2 id="chapter-5-life-in-chichen-itza-i" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#chapter-5-life-in-chichen-itza-i" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Chapter 5 - Life in Chichen Itza (I)</h2><p><img src="https://i.redd.it/nuhx0b4nxn9a1.png" alt="Chapter 5: Life in Chichen Itza I"></p><h1 id="arrow-1-4" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#arrow-1-4" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Arrow 1</h1><p><img src="https://i.redd.it/tmpm8h0fyn9a1.png" alt="Chapter 5 Arrow 1"></p><p><img src="https://i.redd.it/rs4ew8ucyn9a1.png" alt=""></p><p>It is morning and you have slept well. Tepeu greets everyone, but corrects himself to say “good morning” instead. Tepeu will prepare corn for breakfast today. Nemo Marine comes running over, complimenting how nice it is to sleep so soundly in a safe city like Chichen Itza. Habetrot manifests and says that normally Heroic Spirits can go into spirit form and lie dormant for energy conservation, but Marine can’t do that.</p><p><img src="https://i.redd.it/dz50oe8hyn9a1.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Nemo Marine:</strong></p><blockquote><p>Mhm. We, Marines, are basically like parts of Captain, but we aren’t the Heroic Spirit Nemo either.</p><p>If we go into spirit form while we’re separated from the Storm Border, then we can’t materialize back.</p><p>It’s thanks to Chaldea’s electric power and TRISMEGISTUS II that I can materialize as an individual like this.</p><p>The Storm Border replenishes our mana as well~. It’s also thanks to that the Nemo Series can do a lot of stuff.</p><p>That’s why it saves me the trouble so that I can sleep like last night. I cut down my mana consumption and I was able to heal a bit.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Fujimaru Ritsuka:</strong></p><blockquote><p>I see…</p><p>I didn’t know that.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Nemo Marine:</strong></p><blockquote><p>You never know when we’re in the Border~! Captain never explains anything to us anyway!</p><p>But even though we can’t go into spirit form, of course, there are some good things about it~!</p><p>Even if I get hurt, I can always just try to make it back to the Nautilus and baton pass with another Marine!</p><p>We Marines have 12 full time members and 24 total members! The more, the stronger☆</p><p>(Ah…we’re at 19 now though. 4 in Atlantis. 1 in Britain. Right?)</p></blockquote><p><img src="https://i.redd.it/tv6yioa2zn9a1.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Rasputin:</strong></p><blockquote><p>GOOD MORNING, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.</p><p>Forgive me, I am still stuck to my habits at mass. Please think of it as a defect of a Pseudo-Servant.</p><p>Now then. Let us quickly start our cosmic meeting. Would that be acceptable, My Lady?</p></blockquote><p><img src="https://i.redd.it/cmdvbwa3zn9a1.png" alt=""></p><p>U-Olga Marie starts the meeting with projected screens and footage of the city.</p><p><img src="https://i.redd.it/tm4x8j74zn9a1.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Rasputin:</strong></p><blockquote><p>Oh…you remembered a fragment of your powers. Truly astonishing.</p><p>According to this footage, the only way to the throne is the stairs to the altar.</p><p>This route is unusable since there are Deinos called “Fighters” guarding the place.</p><p>Additionally, the Dinosaur King’s private room has been confirmed to be like a villa through the President’s sharp sighted eyes, but there seems to be no confirmation of this Dinosaur King individual.</p><p>It seems that they are absent.</p><p>Supposing that if we were to brute force our way through to gain an audience with the Dinosaur King, our chances are slim.</p></blockquote><p><img src="https://i.redd.it/cfnohhp6zn9a1.png" alt=""></p><p>Rasputin mentions that contact with the Dinosaur King by any normal methods will be difficult. Rasputin enlarges a picture of an arena-like picture. Nemo Marine and Tepeu tell you that this is where xoqqer is held and the only form of entertainment they have.</p><p>U-Olga Marie took the liberty to scan and survey the deinos’ thoughts. Some of them are as follows, “Xoqqer begins after the next night”, “I’m excited. I’m excited. I wonder who’ll go to the finals”, and “The winner will be able to talk directly to the King. The experience to be with Kukulkan.”</p><p><img src="https://i.redd.it/955zo5t7zn9a1.png" alt=""></p><p>U-Olga Marie suggests participating in this tournament in order to meet with the Dinosaur King. <strong>You need an explanation of what xoqqer is.</strong> Tepeu basically describes xoqqer the same way soccer works in our world. Tepeu wanted to be a xoqqer player when he was young, but had to give up when he grew older.</p><p><strong>Fujimaru Ritsuka:</strong></p><blockquote><p>So it’s basically soccerrrr!</p><p>So it’s basically footballll!</p></blockquote><p><img src="https://i.redd.it/88l58c4bzn9a1.png" alt=""></p><p>Mashu reiterates the objective and adds that we have to get along with strong players so that we can join their team. Rasputin asks Tepeu how a xoqqer match is like and gives out a sample, 2 vs 2 or 4 vs 4. Tepeu answers that it is 11 vs 11. Rasputin tells them that they have a chance to join a pre-existing team if it’s 11 vs 11.</p><p><img src="https://i.redd.it/6fnk4qvczn9a1.png" alt=""></p><p>Mashu requests Rasputin to apply the deinos disguise back on. Rasputin took the entire to refine his sacrament so that our deinos disguise will only be seen by deinos and we can look normal. U-Olga Marie asks if we’ll look like deinos to actual deinos and to us, we’ll just look normal and Rasputin says that’ll be the case.</p><p>U-Olga Marie suggests that we split up so that the more teams we’re on, the better chance we’ll have to see the Dinosaur King. Therefore, U-Olga Marie will be competing against you for the sake of the objective.</p><p><strong>Rasputin:</strong></p><blockquote><p>Then it’ll be Fujimaru and Mashu, My Lady and I, and Mr. Tepeu and Marine.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Nemo Marine:</strong></p><blockquote><p>Okay! We’ll all do our best if it’s football! Watch me find a good team!</p></blockquote><p><strong>Tepeu:</strong></p><blockquote><p>Then let us regroup when the sun is around the fourth layer.</p><p>It is crucial that we confirm the situation as a group.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Fujimaru Ritsuka:</strong></p><blockquote><p>Got it!</p><p>Now, let’s find ourselves a team!</p></blockquote><p><img src="https://i.redd.it/368gf6sdzn9a1.png" alt="End of Chapter 5 Arrow 1"></p><h1 id="arrow-2-4" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#arrow-2-4" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Arrow 2</h1><p><img src="https://i.redd.it/9j9qax9fzn9a1.png" alt="Chapter 5 Arrow 2"></p><p>You stroll through the town and listen in to what other deinos might be talking about. One deinos is talking about how hot it’s becoming nowadays and if every other species can hold up fine. The second deinos they’re talking to have the opposite idea and focus on the quality of corn. A third deinos in the conversation wants to talk about xoqqer instead of Priest Vucub because his policies have led to the deaths of deinos lately.</p><p><img src="https://i.redd.it/so5rw9fhzn9a1.png" alt=""></p><p>The third deinos thanks the Crypter that xoqqer has become more enjoyable and the number of deinos deaths have decreased.</p><p>Mashu states that the town is getting busier by the minute and advises you to be careful to not get stepped on. Habetrot is surprised by the many kinds of deinos around here and seems to ask you about dinosaurs.</p><p><img src="https://i.redd.it/ii1he2kizn9a1.png" alt=""></p><p>Mashu instead gives you a brief lecture about dinosaurs, describing the many types of dinosaurs there are like the tyrannosaurus, triceratops, parasaurolophus, pteranodon, etc and also informing us of how they all became extinct. In the end, she’s grateful that she met a dinosaur even if it was in a Lostbelt.</p><p>Habetrot just wants to know about the strongest, smartest and best dinosaur there is and the one who does not make an enemy out of. Mashu answers that it would be Deinonychus and goes on a bit describing their features, but unfortunately, there’s not too many of them here.</p><p><strong>Mashu:</strong></p><blockquote><p>Actually, Tepeu-san has arranged for us to meet with some noble xoqqer team members.</p><p>They’re training themselves for tomorrow’s ceremony at the Ceremony Arena.</p><p>Anyone can freely go into the Ceremony Arena on the weekdays. Let’s head over there quickly!</p></blockquote><p>You head over to the Ceremony Arena and it is packed to the brim with Deinos. Xoqqer players and teams are earnestly preparing for their matches by warming up. Habetrot is very pleased by how close and polite players are to each other.</p><p><strong>Mashu:</strong></p><blockquote><p>Hmm, they’re on the red east side, platform 2, Team Death Rolling—</p></blockquote><p><strong>???:</strong></p><blockquote><p>Fuahhahahaha!</p><p>It’s always nice to see an eager fanboy!

They’ve had seven consecutive victories in the Mazatl Cup. The brothers asks if you’re here to watch them, root them on, things like that, but no, you’re here to ask them if your group can be on their team.</p><p>The Deinonychus Brothers ask if you’re the group with Tepeu and they also refer to Tepeu as Master (in a teacher kind of reference). The brothers assume that Tepeu sent us out here to get the brothers out of a pinch.</p><p><img src="https://i.redd.it/50uuvvbozn9a1.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>11 Deinonychus Brother, Right:</strong></p><blockquote><p>Get out there on the field (ceremonial field), rookies! Let’s see how well you move—</p><p>Gotta see those moves! Kyeeeeeeee! We bite, veteran bite!</p></blockquote><p><strong>Mashu &amp; Habetrot:</strong></p><blockquote><p>(Astonished)</p></blockquote><p>After the match, the team is surprised by how well you did and imagines if our group was part of their team. They let you into the group and don&#39;t really care about being formal so you can call them the 11 Deinonychus Brothers. However, there aren’t 11 of them in total.</p><p>Habetrot materializes and the 11 Deinonychus Brothers are surprised by her (disguised form). They have never seen such a tochtli before. The brothers comment that it looks like a different species, but not an Ocelotl (jaguar) and more like a whimsy and free creature.</p><p><strong>Mashu:</strong></p><blockquote><p>We’d like to participate in tomorrow’s xoqqer as substitutes, would that be alright?</p></blockquote><p><img src="https://i.redd.it/96zl955qzn9a1.png" alt=""></p><p>They include you guys as one of the 11 and you’ll be actual team players and not subs for them. Their morale is brimming with hope as they aren’t scared to drop out the first round now that your group is on the team. However, Mashu seems to point out that they have low standards going into the match with words like “participation rewards” and being able to pass the first round but not mentioning about winning the tournament.</p><p>Everyone in response looks away as if embarrassed. But it’s clear that they win and play by being reliant on yellow cards. The 11 Deinonychus Brothers tell them that their defenders were plagued with cocoa poisoning and informs them that eating too much cocoa gets you cocoa poisoning.</p><p><img src="https://i.redd.it/kalqko8nzn9a1.png" alt="End of Chapter 5 Arrow 2"></p><h1 id="arrow-3-4" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#arrow-3-4" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Arrow 3</h1><p><img src="https://i.redd.it/a3xxgqoszn9a1.png" alt="Chapter 5 Arrow 3"></p><p><img src="https://i.redd.it/8ckezaetzn9a1.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Mashu:</strong></p><blockquote><p>Alright, give me 10 for each set!

Tepeu would strategize for each opponent the team went up against. After Tepeu left, the team had to rely on penalties and when the Crypter came, rules had to be revised so that it became only three penalties. Accidents occurred towards the team which made the team have 11 members to 7.</p><p>The reason why they still play xoqqer is because it is simply fun for them.

So I thought about it.</p><p>I stopped my brothers from calling out Master Tepeu.</p><p>Tepeu likes to be alone. He doesn’t do well in crowds. But—</p><p>I was wrong about him.

Vucub suggests that they’d be considered as villains and tells him to not overlook this. The Dinosaur King agrees that they are here to the end of Mictlan, so it&#39;d be simple to just kill them, but…</p><p><strong>Dinosaur King:</strong></p><blockquote><p>Hey, you.

Rasputin states that it was unfortunate that Izcalli came in and striked when Chaldea were at their lowest point. Tepeu states that he should’ve been the one to die instead of Nemo Marine. Rasputin states that Tepeu’s fighting capabilities are equivalent to a Servant while Nemo Marine didn’t have anything to defend himself with. In war, it is an effective tactic to strike combat supporters who have low combat power.</p><p><img src="https://i.redd.it/oefa3848n3ba1.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Nemo Marine A:</strong></p><blockquote><p>Ah!

Does that mean everyone’s safe?</p></blockquote><p>Goredolf explains that this horrifying scene is just magecraft camouflage. They were about to be shot to death, but thanks to their luck, wit and virtue. The rest of them hid themselves in the hanger. Everyday, Ocelotl would attack them until Marine heard the lightning, came out and saw it was the group.</p><p>Fujimaru and Mashu express their relief and worry for the remaining staff that were here.</p><p><strong>???:</strong></p><blockquote><p>Of course, this is someone who saved everyone from being surrounded by Ocelotl.</p><p>An unknown beautiful woman who solely saw the crisis of the Human Order and manifested in this Lostbelt, ran through the jungle with her prideful motorcycle and defeated the Ocelotl in one sweep with a special service of unique quality bullets—---</p></blockquote><p><img src="https://i.redd.it/v3thpenbn3ba1.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong></p><blockquote><p>Indeed.

Izcalli likes Goredolf purely because Goredolf still wants to do something after everything has been taken from him. Goredolf wants to negotiate without being at gunpoint.</p><p><strong>Izcalli:</strong></p><blockquote><p>Yet, a blond haired foreigner arrived from the outside. Die without knowing Mictlan (our world).</p></blockquote><p>Just as Goredolf is about to die, Koyanskaya saves him with her NFF services by defeating the Ocelotl.</p><p><img src="https://i.redd.it/a82x1v41p3ba1.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong></p><blockquote><p>Yes, it’s been awhile, your Excellency♡</p><p>Koyanskaya of Light, here to do business with the endangered Chaldea☆</p></blockquote><p><img src="https://i.redd.it/9k3wmiw6p3ba1.png" alt=""></p><p>Izcalli orders the Ocelotl to kill Goredolf and then Koyanskaya.

Koyanskaya recalls her statement, “No matter how trivial or small it may be, I will return the favor by helping you” and states that she didn’t become a Servant just to gain some cash for free.</p><p><img src="https://i.redd.it/30lc7x73p3ba1.png" alt=""></p><p>Koyanskaya reveals that the catalyst for her summoning was Goredolf’s concealed lipstick that he still had on around Lostbelt 3. Goredolf’s reasoning is that the lipstick would become an item that would make him nostalgic about the journey he went on.</p><p>Rasputin and U-Olga Marie reveal themselves to Goredolf. Goredolf is shocked by their appearance here, but he doesn’t know the context of the situation.</p><p><img src="https://i.redd.it/xcmyhripo3ba1.png" alt=""></p><p>A short while ago, in the Storm Border, specifically, in the hanger, Goredolf gets briefed on the situation that U-Olga Marie has amnesia and Rasputin merely followed along because of Marie’s orders. Back to the present, Goredolf gets informed of their journey to the Storm Border, but is too focused on not saying “Foreign God”.</p><p><img src="https://i.redd.it/1m9jvn3ro3ba1.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong></p><blockquote><p>Here’s the situation on our end.

U-Olga Marie also wants to know about Goredolf and his rebellion against her, but Goredolf slips up and tells her about the Storm Border. Marie is confused by this.</p><p><img src="https://i.redd.it/cvucbz8uo3ba1.png" alt=""></p><p>U-Olga Marie demands to know who destroyed the Storm Border, which makes Goredolf nervous on how to respond. Fortunately, Rasputin uses the excuse that Goredolf is wary of the people that we picked up on the way. Rasputin proposes that he and Olga Marie earn his trust.</p><p>Rasputin notices that there was a man (Muniere) in the Medical Room. Goredolf desperately asks if he can restore him, but Rasputin will only help if U-Olga Marie says so.</p><p><strong>U-Olga Marie:</strong></p><blockquote><p>.?

Mashu expresses her relief in seeing Muniere back alive. Muniere expresses that all of this life-threatening stuff is something that hasn’t changed and still happens on a daily basis. Muniere says that we shouldn’t worry about it. Muniere talks about the Human Order Incineration Incident where it all began and that the staff of Chaldea were driven to support Mashu and Fujimaru. From there and up till now, they were able to get along. Nemo Nurse tells Fujimaru and Mashu that Goredolf wants them in the Control Room.</p><p><img src="https://i.redd.it/2e7knuuor3ba1.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong></p><blockquote><p>Now, let us establish our next strategic objective!</p><p>After we broke into the Seventh Lostbelt, we had to make an unavoidable emergency landing due to an attack by an unknown light.</p><p>In the process, Fujimaru and Mashu fell out of the ship and were separated, but have now safely rendezvoused.</p><p>Good work.</p><p>However, during that time, we encountered the mysterious armed group, Ocelotl.</p><p>As well as Izcalli, the individual claiming to be the leader of the Ocelotl.</p><p>Izcalli called the unidentifiable arms dealer, Tezcatlipoca.</p><p>To be honest, it is currently unknown whether Tezcatlipoca hails from aztec mythology.</p><p>However!

Are you informed about Mictlan?</p></blockquote><p>If you choose the second option, Koyanskaya will tell you that she informed him about Mictlan as they were getting attacked.

Goredolf likes the fact that they are herbivores and intelligent beings. Rasputin asks about Nitocris’s condition, but Goredolf reports that Nitocris isn’t any fighting condition so he won’t let her follow Fujimaru. Goredolf states that Rasputin, Koyanskaya and U-Olga Marie are enough to compensate. Rasputin and Koyanskaya tease each other about whether they’re up for it or not.</p><p><img src="https://i.redd.it/7gg8lqlsr3ba1.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong></p><blockquote><p>My, how lovely♡ I’d rather die than receive your therapy♡</p></blockquote><p>Koyanskaya asks about Fou, but it seems that Fou’s nowhere to be seen.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong></p><blockquote><p>(...Ah, so that’s how it is.

Rasputin gives a lecture about the meaning of sacrifice in Aztec civilization. The notable and important points that Rasputin gives is that:</p><ol><li><strong>They had an interest in astronomy</strong> which stemmed from their ancestors being victims of a cosmic threat. This led to them taking in Central and South American memories that the world would be destroyed by a foreign cosmic object. In Aztec myth, the world was <strong>destroyed multiple times</strong>. Rasputin says <strong>four, but it’s five</strong> with the “present time” of Aztec mythology. <strong>This is the Aztec mythological version of the cycle of rebirth and extinction.</strong> People took Central America’s memories of rebirth and extinction as a lesson and were influenced by them.</li><li>The Aztec civilization believed that the world would be <strong>destroyed every 52 years</strong>. Once the radiance of the sun disappeared, the world would be engulfed in darkness which would commence the destruction of the Aztec world. <strong>This is why priests offered up living sacrifices to maintain the sun’s radiance.</strong></li><li>Tepeu asks why couldn’t the people realize that the sun operates independently. Rasputin explains that this was the reality for the Aztecs. The worldview of the sun and destruction was difficult for anyone to live. <strong>Rasputin believed that the Aztec fell due to magecraft, as they rejected human sacrifices,</strong> considering the world the Aztecs lived in at the time.</li><li>Quetzalcoatl denied human sacrifice while Tezcatlipoca did. The Spaniards came and considered Tezcatlipoca for supporting such sacrifices after they witnessed the highest aloft waterside city.</li><li>Moctezuma II invited Hernan Cortes because he believed that Hernan Cortes was Quetzalcoatl. But it is odd that someone would invite a person who didn’t like human sacrifice. The gods that were worshiped in Tenochtitlan were the Rain God, Tlaloc and the Tribal God, Huitzilopochtli. He considered that the Aztec would be destroyed by other tribes and wanted to stop human sacrifice. He considered Hernan Cortes to be the “reemergence of Quetzalcoatl”, a weapon he could use.</li><li>However, Hernan Cortes was oblivious to their culture until La Malinche taught him the language, culture and the Aztec Empire’s weakness. In the end, the Aztec Empire and the other tribes were defeated by the Spanish Empire. Though in truth, it was La Malinche.</li></ol><p>Rasputin focuses on the main objective which is tomorrow’s ceremony where they’ll use Chaldea staff as offerings.</p><p><strong>Rasputin:</strong></p><blockquote><p>Prisoners are kept in an underground prison in Tlaloc’s temple.</p></blockquote><p>Rasputin states that the plan to infiltrate the temple and break Chaldea out will be tomorrow during the ceremony. The plan is that as Ocelotl kneel and pray for the ritual’s success, the group will go in and get them.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong></p><blockquote><p>Very well.

Tlaloc comes to warm Izcalli to not be out on a sunless night. Izcalli answers that where they are is where only kings, gods and sacrifices are permitted to be.</p><p><strong>Izcalli:</strong></p><blockquote><p>Besides…what is that appearance? You look as if you’re a human from Pan-Human History…</p></blockquote><p><img src="https://i.redd.it/c30wawfgrpca1.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Tlaloc:</strong></p><blockquote><p>…Do not mind it. It is just to match with my brother.</p><p>“If you want to protect Mexico City, then make an effort to integrate into civilization.”</p><p>They dislike obsolete gods. He said that the Ocelotl would call me old-fashioned.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Izcalli:</strong></p><blockquote><p>No. I am content with Tlaloc’s usual appearance.</p><p>Mictlan deserves to witness the embodiment of blessed rain and death by flooding rivers.</p></blockquote><p><img src="https://i.redd.it/hs1g7jcjrpca1.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Tlaloc:</strong></p><blockquote><p>…Indeed. This is the Lostbelt of Mictlan.</p><p>Different from the weak Mictlan of Pan-Human History. A place where they allow the existence of warriors.</p><p>Are you aware of it, Izcalli? The definition of paradise in Aztec mythology.</p><p>It is those who go to Mictlan and “weren’t warriors”.</p><p>A world with no relation with good and evil, where humans died naturally and not in battle.</p><p>This Mictlan is the exact opposite. At the very least, that’s how it is for the Ocelotl.</p></blockquote><p>Izcalli explains that the Ocelotl are warriors and they are offerings to Tezcatlipoca when they die in battle. <strong>The Aztecs of Pan-Human History were mistaken because it is not just a ceremony of rebirth</strong> and not about sacrificing those who weren’t warriors for rain and the like.</p><p>Izcalli explains that this world is different because they only rip out powerful organs to revive a god.</p><p><img src="https://i.redd.it/kj4pwe4orpca1.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Izcalli:</strong></p><blockquote><p>And now we are close to the needed amount. That Chaldea staff and the great artificial human.</p><p>Their hearts are rarer than the deinos. The revival of the true Tezcatlipoca. The final step.</p></blockquote><p>Tlaloc asks Izcalli if he knows about the deepest layer of Mictlan.</p><p><strong>Izcalli:</strong></p><blockquote><p>Yes. There rests a “weapon” that can annihilate Pan-Human History.</p><p>A year ago, Tezcatlipoca ascended from the deepest layer to the fifth layer and bestowed weapons to us.</p><p>A year later, he went down to the deepest layer again to obtain another weapon to destroy Pan-Human History.</p><p>We will obey that will. We will exterminate the deinos, grasp the hegemony of Mictlan, and replace the foolish Pan-Human History with Mexico City taking over the “next” of humanity.</p></blockquote><p>Tlaloc tells him that he’s right. However, Tlaloc orders him to make tomorrow perfect or else his life will be forfeit. Izcalli swears to meet those expectations and fulfill his duty perfectly. Tlaloc sternly asks him if he is being arrogant by underestimating Pan-Human History even after what happened at the Storm Border (Marie using her thunder to knock out Izcalli).</p><p><img src="https://i.redd.it/n4yywuslrpca1.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Izcalli:</strong></p><blockquote><p>—I am belittling them. That does not mean I am dismissing them.</p><p>They are novices who break down after the death of their fellow brethren. As a warrior, I cannot comprehend their emotions.</p><p>They are intent on killing us as hostiles, yet aren’t prepared for even the death of their brethren—</p><p>I have never felt such detest. The humans of Pan-Human History are unsightly.</p><p>For me to be raised by Tezcatlipoca, their civilization is not worth acknowledging.</p></blockquote><p><img src="https://i.redd.it/u1i7q8sqrpca1.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Tlaloc:</strong></p><blockquote><p>…Right.

If you heard it, then think about what it means.</p></blockquote><p>Tlaloc starts walking away, Izcalli holds her up thinking that she still has headaches after Tezcatlipoca’s shot, but Tlaloc walks away saying that she’s fine.</p><p><img src="https://i.redd.it/gaw1s9ksrpca1.png" alt=""></p><p>Meanwhile, Kadoc and Sion are in a cell together.

Kadoc hears someone coming down and assumes that we’re there, but it’s Daybit.

Why? You’re the last Crypter left.</p><p>You haven’t rebelled against the “Foreign God” like Kirishtaria did.</p><p>You have no reason to keep someone like me who’s defected to Chaldea or their talented staff.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Daybit:</strong></p><blockquote><p>Tezcatlipoca was the one who captured you guys. Not me.</p><p>He has his own ideas and objectives. I had nothing to do with the snatching since I wasn’t there.</p><p>—Well, you could say that he took the initiative.</p><p>He’s the type to go out and never say anything about it.</p><p>He’ll suddenly return and nonchalantly say “ah, my bad, but I completely used up your bank account”.</p></blockquote><p><img src="https://i.redd.it/qgco6mmespca1.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Sion:</strong></p><blockquote><p>(Is this DV (domestic violence)?)</p></blockquote><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong></p><blockquote><p>Ha. So you aren’t on good terms with your Servant. Then you aren’t going to kill us because of your Servant…</p><p>You’re frightened of Tezcatlipoca, aren’t you?</p></blockquote><p><img src="https://i.redd.it/7k9p2gagspca1.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Daybit:</strong></p><blockquote><p>Yea. He’s a major Servant. He dominated extraterrestrial life on Mictlan and established Pan-Human History rules in one year.</p><p>In reality, Mexico City is his city.</p><p>He summoned temples, cultivated the Ocelotl, constructed this city, and chose the city’s king.</p><p>All I am is Tezcatlipoca’s summoner.</p><p>If Chaldea intends on fighting this Lostbelt, then the one who’ll destroy you will not be me, but Tezcatlipoca.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Sion:</strong></p><blockquote><p>Then, you have no interest in this Lostbelt, right, Mr. Daybit? Are you fine with Chaldea removing this Lostbelt?</p></blockquote><p><img src="https://i.redd.it/bxtkbsaispca1.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Daybit:</strong></p><blockquote><p>So you want to remove it. I won’t interfere if you do it in 10 days.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Sion:</strong></p><blockquote><p>I see, I see. Then if Chaldea can sever the Fantasy Tree, then doesn’t that mean your objectives will restart at square one?</p></blockquote><p><strong>Daybit:</strong></p><blockquote><p>That is, if you can do it. As an individual, I don’t care either way—</p><p>Since Wodime carried through till the very end, I will also fulfill my Order.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong></p><blockquote><p>…Don’t be absurd.

It’s about the will.</p><p>He didn’t move on his calculation that “my plan will absolutely succeed”.</p><p>What kept his body which was on the verge of death moving was his will.</p><p>He kept going till the very end. Even if he was annoyed, he had no regrets.</p><p>You could say he followed through. Yet the ideals he sought out for didn’t materialize.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong></p><blockquote><p>…Well. …I guess you’re right.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Daybit:</strong></p><blockquote><p>Let’s stop there. Let’s focus on something else. I don’t have time today.</p><p>I have a question, Kadoc. Why won’t you bring your Servant along?</p><p>You’re a Master. Use your Servant, you should be able to break out of this prison with ease.</p></blockquote><p><img src="https://i.redd.it/qkjj0w5sspca1.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong></p><blockquote><p>Well I obviously don’t have one. I’m no longer a Crypter and changed sides.</p><p>I don’t have authorization from Chaldea to summon a Servant, and I don’t wish for one either.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Daybit:</strong></p><blockquote><p>That’s not what I’m talking about. Why won’t you use what’s there.</p></blockquote><p><img src="https://i.redd.it/qfc1mv0uspca1.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong></p><blockquote><p>Huh?</p></blockquote><p><img src="https://i.redd.it/klnudt6wspca1.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Daybit:</strong></p><blockquote><p>…Good grief. You’re a lucky guy. I can see why Peperoncino never let you go.</p><p>You still have your Sirius Light.</p><p>It’s a spell that generates mana that’s ten times larger than a Command Seal. A detonator that instantly amplifies the caster’s mana circuits.</p><p>A Crypter using the Greater Command Seal would die. To simply put it, they implode.</p><p>The Greater Command Seal is a bomb. In the case that the Crypter failed their Rayshift, Marisbury prepared an insurance plan so that we can accomplish an Order <strong>by destroying the entire territory.</strong></p><p>Ophelia was lucky that was on the brink of death. She was a caster who’s already dead before their Greater Command Seal could be activated.</p><p>If Ophelia utilized her Greater Command Seal before receiving a fatal wound, then she would’ve eliminated the Shadow Border and all Chaldea survivors.</p></blockquote><p>Kadoc explains that he vaguely thought that was the case and the Beryl was there because he’d make sure their Greater Command Seal was used if any Crypter tried to escape from the Singularity. That’s why there were seven Crypters, one for each Singularity. He knew that Marisbury didn’t believe that the Crypter could fulfill the Human Order Restoration.</p><p>Kadoc states that what Daybit is saying is that Kadoc should use his Sirius Light to blow both him and Daybit up. Daybit says that he doesn’t care, but notes that Nemo and Da Vinci are in a separate jail.</p><p><img src="https://i.redd.it/lu4cp2h1tpca1.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Daybit:</strong></p><blockquote><p>The Greater Command Seal is a bomb, and also a Master’s wildcard.</p><p>The Greater Command Seal gives you a chance to give an abnormal order to your Servant.</p><p>I told you what happened with Ophelia. <strong>But if you suicide before you use it, then you won’t implode.</strong></p><p>In short, you either die, or achieve something before you die. It’s up to you what you want to do, Kadoc.</p></blockquote><p>Daybit leaves.</p><p><img src="https://i.redd.it/w6n2i443tpca1.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong></p><blockquote><p>…Is that all!? Why did you come here then!?</p></blockquote><p><strong>Daybit:</strong></p><blockquote><p>I told you already. To confirm enemy capabilities. It’s the least <strong>I can do</strong> since I can’t kill you all here and now.</p></blockquote><p>Sion is surprised by what she heard. She couldn’t understand what they were talking about even though it was right in front of her. She compares Daybit to an open void in the world. Kadoc sympathizes with her, but he states that Daybit is a caring, social and smart person. Daybit only says something if it’s necessary.</p><p>Kadoc:</p><blockquote><p>(...Like I said. There’s meaning in the information he told me about the Greater Command Seal. He’s telling me to think—about what to do with it and where to use it)</p></blockquote><p>Kadoc asks her to keep what just happened a secret. She agrees to keep the entire thing a secret which makes Kadoc relieved.</p><p><img src="https://i.redd.it/x912ium4tpca1.png" alt="End of Chapter 9 Arrow 3"></p><h1 id="arrow-4-8" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#arrow-4-8" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Arrow 4</h1><p><img src="https://i.redd.it/34p24bwstpca1.png" alt="Chapter 9 Arrow 4"></p><p><img src="https://i.redd.it/4o3bmv0wtpca1.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Fujimaru Ritsuka:</strong></p><blockquote><p>……………….</p><p>……………….</p><p>……………….</p></blockquote><p><img src="https://i.redd.it/sv6q48d5wpca1.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>U-Olga Marie:</strong></p><blockquote><p>HOW FOOLISH OF YOU TO NOT BE ABLE TO SLEEP, FUJIMARU!</p><p>Are you worried about tomorrow’s rescue operation!</p></blockquote><p><strong>Fujimaru Rituska:</strong></p><blockquote><p>O-of course not!</p><p>Be quiet, you’re going to wake the others up!</p></blockquote><p><strong>U-Olga Marie:</strong></p><blockquote><p>Alright.
