It seems there is no need for hospitalization.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Eh――――――Kotomine...?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...That is my line.</p><p>You and Rin were abandoned at the door.</p><p>I wanted to leave you two, since you made a rather ugly pair as abandoned children go, but you were also dead on your feet. Had I done nothing, there would have been two dead bodies in front of my church. A church cannot afford that image, so I had no choice but to treat you.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;――――――――&quot;</p><p>...I figure out the situation I&#39;m in.</p><p>This is the chapel.</p><p>There&#39;s nothing wrong with my body. The energy that was swallowed by Sakura&#39;s shadow has recovered.</p><p>I lost consciousness back in my yard.

You have been sleeping for about twelve hours since you were carried here.&quot;</p><p>&quot;――――Twelve hours!? That&#39;s half a day...!&quot;</p><p>I get up from the chair I was lying on.</p><p>I can&#39;t lie around like this...!</p><hr><p>&quot;Kotomine, where&#39;s Tohsaka!? She was there too, right!? Where is she!?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;I have Rin resting at her place.</p><p>You only had your energy taken away, but she had her magical energy taken away. It would normally take seven days to recover, but the land of Tohsaka is good for her.</p><p>If all goes well, she should regain consciousness by tomorrow afternoon.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;―――I see. So her life&#39;s not in danger?&quot;</p><p>&quot;No. The soil of that land is special. It is a ley line that is said to have been home to vampires. Rin is her family&#39;s heir, so she will be back to her impudent self if I keep her buried for a day.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;......&quot;</p><p>I think I heard something I&#39;m not used to hearing, but I decide not to ask about it.</p><p>Let&#39;s hope he doesn&#39;t literally mean &quot;bury&quot;.</p><hr><p>&quot;――――I see. Thanks for the care.&quot;</p><p>I leave the church.</p><hr><p>I know what I have to do.</p><p>Follow Sakura.</p><p>Bring back Illya. Bring back Sakura.</p><p>Protect the one I love.</p><p>So what if the fight&#39;s outcome is already determined?</p><p>I still have the power to fight.</p><p>So this is no time to be hesitating.</p><hr><p>&quot;――――――――&quot;</p><p>There&#39;s no time.</p><p>I can&#39;t waste time going back home to find a weapon.</p><p>...No, these people can&#39;t be fought with weapons from my house.</p><hr><p>Sakura and Saber.</p><p>Zouken and Assassin.</p><p>If Zouken is after Illya, I have to assume all my enemies are at my destination.</p><hr><p>&quot;So, where are you going, Emiya Shirou? I do not know the situation.&quot;</p><p>&quot;...? It&#39;s obvious. Illya went with Sakura to protect us. She said to go to the castle if Sakura wants her formal dress. I don&#39;t know what this formal dress is, but they&#39;re likely heading to her castle.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Formal dress...? No, never mind that. Matou Sakura has become your enemy? Then the victor of this Holy Grail War is decided.&quot;</p><p>&quot;............&quot;</p><p>It&#39;s irritating, but Kotomine&#39;s right.</p><hr><p>Zouken and Sakura.</p><p>Sakura is obviously the superior Master, but she can&#39;t disobey Zouken.</p><p>...I don&#39;t know what she&#39;s trying to do with Illya, but it&#39;ll end once she meets Zouken.</p><p>No matter how much Sakura refuses him, the crest worm in her body will control her.</p><hr><p>&quot;――――Hey, more importantly!</p><p>Why are you following me!?&quot;</p><p>&quot;It will be too much for you alone. If Illyasviel has been kidnapped, I cannot just watch quietly.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Wha――――&quot;</p><p>I stop at the unexpected reply.</p><p>What did he just say――――?</p><hr><p>&quot;Too much for me?

Sakura&#39;s Sakura. She&#39;s just possessed by the shadow, and she&#39;ll quickly....&quot;</p><p>&quot;She&#39;ll quickly be back to normal?</p><p>I explained that to you before. The only way to return her to normal is to separate her from the shadow.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;There are two ways to do so.</p><p>Eliminate the main body of the shadow, or wait until Matou Sakura materializes it.</p><p>You have no way to defeat the shadow right now. All you can do is protect Sakura&#39;s mind until the shadow is born.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;――――――――&quot;</p><p>But I don&#39;t know how to protect her mind.</p><p>...The Command Spell covering Sakura&#39;s body...</p><p>If that&#39;s what Kotomine means by Black Sakura, then isn&#39;t Sakura slowly turning into the shadow?</p><hr><p>&quot;...Kotomine. When you talk about materializing the shadow, do you mean Sakura turning into it?&quot;</p><p>&quot;No. I&#39;m sure there is some sympathy, but the main body of the shadow is in the Holy Grail.</p><p>What is transforming Matou Sakura is inside the Holy Grail, but that is still her shadow.</p><p>It cannot exist without her. The main body does not have form, so it exists in the material world by being her shadow.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;What&#39;s inside the Holy Grail will not come into this world unless there is an incomplete Holy Grail called Matou Sakura.</p><p>But once it is born, it will be a separate entity. Once it is separated from her, the curse tainting her should stop.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...Kotomine. You say born, but is that thing inside Sakura?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Of course not. If it were, the matter would be easily solved. We would simply need to extract it from her body.</p><p>The main body of the shadow is within the Holy Grail. Matou Sakura is merely a host that gives it energy and form.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;But Sakura&#39;s the Holy Grail, right? What does that mean?</p><p>Are there many Holy Grails?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Yes. I explained to you in the beginning. This land has a Holy Grail, and they summon the Holy Grail into the Holy Grail the people prepared.</p><p>The main Holy Grail―――the magecraft circle and the brain that governs the rules of the ritual called the Holy Grail War. That is the Holy Grail on this land that Einzbern, Tohsaka, and Makiri prepared.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;――――The Holy Grail in this land――――&quot;</p><p>All the laws... Summoning the Servants, making the Masters fight, and calling down the Holy Grail.</p><p>If the Holy Grail War is man-induced, then it&#39;s obvious that there&#39;s also a man-induced cause.</p><hr><p>Then―――if I find that large-scale magecraft circle and destroy it, I may be able to purge the shadow invading Sakura&#39;s body―――</p><hr><p>&quot;Do you know where that is, Kotomine?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I have a guess. Ask Rin if you would like to know the entrance.</p><p>The Tohsaka family are the supervisors of this land.</p><p>The Einzbern cooperated with them two hundred years ago to secure a land for the ritual. Rin, the successor, should know where the place is.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;But―――that is all after we save Illyasviel. If Zouken obtains Illyasviel, she and Matou Sakura will be disposed of as the Holy Grail.</p><p>Matou Zouken has no intention of using the main Holy Grail. For him, the two women are enough.</p><p>Your idea of destroying the main Holy Grail is meaningless.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;D-Don&#39;t be stupid! I&#39;m not thinking about such a thing!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Really? I think it is the most realistic solution for you. It&#39;s strange that you wouldn&#39;t go through with it.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;―――Shut up. So why didn&#39;t you tell me about it?</p><p>If you&#39;d told me at the beginning, I would....&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;You would have destroyed the magecraft circle? Nothing would go so smoothly. My goal is the completion of the magecraft circle, after all. I cannot let you destroy it.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;I told you that we will be enemies after we rescue Illyasviel. My goal is different from yours.</p><p>I am interested in what comes from Matou Sakura―――no, what is trying to become her. Unlike Zouken, I have no wish.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...Don&#39;t bullshit me. You&#39;re the same as Zouken. You&#39;re using Sakura to create something and make it yours.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Make it mine...? Of course not. I have no interest in it after it is born. In any case, no human will be able to control it.</p><p>What will appear is a phenomenon called hell. If Matou Sakura becomes that, I will die just like everybody else.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Wha――――――――&quot;</p><p>What is that?</p><p>Then his goal&#39;s just...</p><hr><p>&quot;―――Are you insane?</p><p>You want to turn Sakura into such a thing, knowing that you&#39;re going to be killed...!?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Yes. My role is to bless whatever is born.</p><p>That will not change, no matter what it is or what situation it is in.</p><p>There is a life and a will to be born. I cannot oppose that.</p><p>Emiya. If there is a pure wish in this world, it must be the desire to be born.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;But what&#39;s in Sakura is――――&quot;</p><p>&quot;It is not evil.</p><p>Humans can earn happiness just by existing.</p><p>As they grow, they will learn of new happiness, of more advanced and complex pleasures.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;But humans are not happy at the moment of birth.</p><p>An embryo does not have the knowledge to know what happiness is.</p><p>Humans start from zero, learn what is fun, and learn what is right.</p><p>The beginning is at zero.</p><p>There is no good or evil. There is only the fact that it is allowed to exist in this world.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;――――――――&quot;</p><p>&quot;Good or evil. The person&#39;s knowledge will decide that.</p><p>If there is any responsibility, it lies with the environment and the &#39;self&#39; that raised you.</p><p>There is no crime in receiving birth.</p><p>That is why I will bless even the birth of a devil.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;―――This is the way I have lived.</p><p>This way of living is mine.</p><p>Even if what Matou Sakura gives birth to is hell, it is hard to change my nature.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;――――――――&quot;</p><p>...I don&#39;t understand.</p><p>I know he&#39;s serious.</p><p>He knows he&#39;ll die, but he&#39;s still going bless the evil that will be born through Sakura.</p><p>...I&#39;ll never be able to approve of this man.</p><p>But it&#39;s true that he&#39;s trying to save Illya and release Sakura from Zouken&#39;s control.</p><hr><p>&quot;―――――――!&quot;</p><p>Thoughts that are in conflict.</p><p>Lives that cannot coexist.</p><p>But we have the same goal right now.</p><hr><p>&quot;―――I can trust you, right?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I said we will be cooperating.

Ah... ah... ah......!&quot;</p><hr><p>She tears at her throat.</p><p>She cannot breathe.</p><p>The air is poisonous.</p><p>Matou Sakura is turning into a deep-sea monster, so being on land is like being in a vacuum.</p><hr><p>&quot;Ah――――Ahhh, ahhhh......!!!!&quot;</p><hr><p>That&#39;s why she dances around like mad.</p><p>Her sanity broken, she takes out her anger on everything she sees.</p><p>She keeps appealing to the unconcerned world about her pain.</p><p>About her misfortune and her pain.</p><hr><p>&quot;――――Well. It is about time. She remained Matou Sakura for longer than I expected, but she will turn into the vessel with one more push.&quot;</p><p>Two shadows watch the spectacle.</p><p>An old magus, Matou Zouken, and his Servant, Assassin.</p><hr><p>&quot;...One more push? I am tired of hearing those words. The match is over. I am the only Servant you need. Have her take in the remaining two.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I know. But she does not try to kill the Servants she has absorbed. I do not know if it is her shallow wit or cowardice. Saber and Berserker are still trapped within her. She should kill them, but she keeps them alive.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...Interesting. So Saber is not the only one?&quot;</p><p>&quot;No. It is probably to keep me in check, but how thoughtless of her. The more Servants she controls, the more magical energy she must draw from the Holy Grail. It is a supply of magical energy the Holy Grail receives from the Great Holy Grail, but magical energy is not the only thing that flows into her.</p><p>She is accelerating her transfiguration by letting the Servants live. Her sanity will be lost and she will turn into an ideal tool even if I do nothing.&quot;</p><hr><p>The old magus laughs, watching the girl&#39;s suffering.</p><p>There&#39;s affection in his eyes.</p><p>He loves her.</p><p>What he originally considered a mere experiment grew beyond his expectation to grant him his dearest wish, immortality.</p><hr><p>It would be strange not to love her.</p><p>To the old magus, Matou Sakura looks like a beautiful bride.</p><p>No matter how much she fights, she will be his in the end.</p><p>It doesn&#39;t matter even if she obtains power, controls many Servants, and retains her sanity.</p><p>Their hierarchy was set eleven years ago.</p><p>The old magus can kill Matou Sakura merely by closing his eyes and opening them again.</p><hr><p>&quot;――――――――&quot;</p><p>...But the white skull is different.</p><p>He&#39;s the symbol of ill omen, the wind that brings death, so he&#39;s sensitive to those of his kind.</p><hr><p>&quot;―――The magus makes light of the matter, but―――&quot;</p><p>Will everything turn out well?</p><p>The situation will not change, even if the girl loses her sanity.</p><p>She reacts to people with hostility.</p><hr><p>In that regard, she&#39;s already acting the way she will once her mind is lost.</p><p>Matou Zouken is conceited.</p><p>Even if she goes mad, she will not obey his command.</p><hr><p>&quot;......Magus. There is a way to control her, yes? Her defensive instincts are excessive. Your voice will not reach her if she loses her sanity and can no longer tell ally from enemy.</p><p>If that happens, you cannot approach merely by hiding your hostility.</p><p>She is the kind that will eliminate her enemies by foreseeing the &#39;result&#39; called her death.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh, I see, that is promising. That makes it even better as the container.&quot;</p><p>The old magus laughs.</p><hr><p>&quot;――――――――&quot;</p><p>Falling silent, the masked figure stares at the crumbling hall.</p><p>...He cannot approve of the magus&#39;s plan.</p><p>He says his goal is immortality, but his method seems distorted.</p><p>No, he&#39;s a rotting human from the start.</p><p>It&#39;s natural that he&#39;s crazy, but the old man&#39;s procedure seems inconsistent――――</p><hr><p>&quot;Haha, did you hear that, Assassin!? She&#39;s begging me for help now! Good, good! It feels like we&#39;re eleven years in the past!</p><p>The pressure of being denied by the world itself must surely be painful, Sakura!</p><p>But endure it. Your body can endure it. Remember all the days of pain and solitude over the last eleven years!</p><p>For what did you bear the thousands of tortures!? What did you give your body to the tens of thousands of worms for!? That&#39;s right; pain of that degree is nothing to you! That&#39;s how I raised you! That&#39;s how I trained you!&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;.........&quot;</p><p>It seems the old magus can hear the girl&#39;s voice.</p><p>Assassin can only hear groans, but she must literally be begging for her life, begging for help.</p><hr><p>&quot;Yes, I will help you! You are my masterpiece! I shall see it through! But I can only save your body. Your mind did not follow me through the eleven years of training.</p><p>You escaped the pain by accepting it, so you should not be able to bear that resentment. But you can rest assured, as I will guarantee the strength of your flesh! You can bear it! Your flesh shall put on Avenger!&quot;</p><hr><p>The old magus continues to laugh.</p><p>Assassin looks at him emotionlessly and steps back.</p><hr><p>&quot;Hm? Where are you going, Assassin?</p><p>There is a slight possibility of danger. I need you here to protect me from her.&quot;</p><p>&quot;...I do not mind, but why are you concerned about the black Holy Grail and not the white? Why are you letting the legitimate Holy Grail we obtained roam freely?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh, that. Illyasviel is cooperative. She exists only to open the gate, as is her duty. She does not mind what we do as long as her goal is achieved.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;.........&quot;</p><p>&quot;Do not be so doubtful. The Holy Grail you desire is that girl. Keeping your name in history and becoming the original. Your wish to be eternal through record will be granted by Einzbern.</p><p>But I need her to keep her original form. Homunculi are outside my expertise. You can let her be until they prepare her formal dress.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;.........So you will not force them, you say?</p><p>But――――do we have such liberty?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Of course we do. We have no more enemies.</p><p>It was unexpected that Emiya&#39;s boy and Tohsaka&#39;s girl were alive, but they aren&#39;t important. Nobody is foolish enough to fight after being shown that much difference in power.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;We cannot take it back if we rush things out of needless worry and allow Illyasviel to die.</p><p>It is her role to open heaven&#39;s gate. We shall show compassion and let her carry out her duty――――Assassin?&quot;</p><p>&quot;―――Stop. It seems there is someone that foolish.&quot;</p><p>&quot;――――Hm?&quot;</p><hr><p>At that instant, the white skull disappears.</p><p>Assassin sensed the intruders and hurried out of the castle without hesitation.</p><p>The enemies are already running outside.</p><p>They have slipped through the unwary magus&#39;s guard and are about to exit the castle gate.</p><hr><p>&quot;――――Oh. So you are determined to die, boy?&quot;</p><p>But he hasn&#39;t been careless.</p><p>Illyasviel cannot run away.</p><p>Einzbern&#39;s longstanding desire is in her core.</p><p>The white girl will help him even if he doesn&#39;t force her.</p><p>It&#39;s foolish to run away with such a girl.</p><p>Even if they escape the forest with her, she will come to the land of the Holy Grail, the land of the origin.</p><hr><p>&quot;Hah. I have left her alone, but it cannot be helped now.</p><p>―――It is your turn, Sakura. You cannot be saved without Illyasviel. If you would like to be freed from that pain, go trample upon them without mercy.&quot;</p><p>With a loud laugh, the presence of the old magus recedes.</p><hr><p>...A shadow is cowering in the hall.</p><p>The shadow that shrouds the entire hall has become a black swamp, from which two dark figures emerge.</p><hr><p>&quot;.....................&quot;</p><hr><p>The girl no longer feels agony.</p><p>It&#39;s not that she&#39;s accustomed to the poison now.</p><p>It&#39;s merely that...</p><p>&quot;............I see. You came, Senpai......&quot;</p><hr><p>...Pleasure has surpassed her dark pain.</p><hr><p>&quot;...So that priest&#39;s with him. How stupid of him. He came to be eaten?&quot;</p><p>She raises a finger.</p><p>To the direction of the castle gate. The direction the trespassers have gone, where they are running even now.</p><hr><p>&quot;Go. You can kill anyone but Senpai. Kill anyone else, no matter who they may be.&quot;</p><hr><p>The black giant is released.</p><p>The unleashed hound roars and disappears with a sudden gust.</p><hr><p>&quot;But then―――you won&#39;t be able to tell who that is, though, Berserker.&quot;</p><hr><p>She smiles.</p><p>Slowly, she leaves the kingdom of rubble with the black swordsman.</p><hr><h2 id="scene-08-ilya-found" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#scene-08-ilya-found" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Scene 08 Ilya found</h2><p>We emerge into a clearing.</p><p>An empty, circular space within the vast forest.</p><p>The castle I saw through Illya&#39;s eyes is standing there, just like I remembered.</p><hr><p>There&#39;s no one around.</p><p>It&#39;s strange that there&#39;s no watch anywhere, but I can&#39;t back out even if this is a trap.</p><hr><p>&quot;Kotomine. Can we get up to the second floor from that tree?&quot;</p><p>Even if they don&#39;t know we&#39;re here, it&#39;ll be suicidal to go in from the front door.</p><p>It might be useless, but I have to do everything I can.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Right.</p><p>If we wish to sneak in, we should use an unused waterway, but they aren&#39;t the sort to fall for such time-consuming methods.</p><p>They will notice our intrusion once we enter the castle. I would like to go directly to where Illyasviel is held captive and escape immediately, but――――&quot;</p><hr><p>The priest looks up at the castle, pondering.</p><p>...He narrows his eyes as if trying to look through the wall, staring at each window in turn.</p><hr><p>&quot;―――What a surprise. It seems they really do think lightly of us, Emiya.&quot;</p><p>A happy voice.</p><p>&quot;What?&quot;</p><p>I&#39;ve never heard this tone from him before, so I doubt my ears for a second.</p><hr><p>&quot;W-What, Kotomine? Did you find something?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I did.</p><p>―――Let me ask. Do you have experience in mountain climbing, Emiya Shirou?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;............Don&#39;t tell me...&quot;</p><p>&quot;I mean free climbing, of course. It is vertical, but there is no overhang and there are enough holds. We can maintain a secure footing. It will be easy to climb this wall without tools. Compared to a wall of ice, this is like walking down the street.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Wai――――&quot;</p><p>Kotomine puts his hand on the wall before I can stop him.</p><hr><p>&quot;Wha――――&quot;</p><p>He presses himself against the wall and climbs up.</p><p>He&#39;s going slow, but I see how stable he is.</p><hr><p>&quot;What are you doing? If you cannot find the points, copy me. You should not be so weak that four stories are too much for you.</p><p>―――Oh, and leave the Black Key. We can pick it up on the way out.&quot;</p><p>The priest continues to climb as he speaks.</p><hr><p>&quot;―――He&#39;s serious.&quot;</p><p>I throw down the sword and get on the wall.</p><p>...He must have picked an easy section to climb. The rocks are pretty rough, so I can manage to get ahold of them.</p><hr><p>You don&#39;t just use your strength to climb up.</p><p>Knowing if the next hold is safe, knowing if the small hold can support your weight, knowing if there&#39;s another hold after you move...</p><p>A vertical climb is like a puzzle of improvisation.</p><p>Even if the goal is a meter away, you have to go back down and try a new route if you can&#39;t find the next hold.</p><hr><p>A route to the destination.</p><p>The technique of thinking two or three steps ahead only comes with experience.</p><p>That&#39;s experience I lack, so I have to copy exactly what Kotomine does.</p><p>I&#39;ll instantly fall if I miss the target by a few centimeters or grip the handle with the wrong force.</p><hr><p>&quot;――――I can&#39;t believe it. You let an amateur do something like this?&quot;</p><p>I grumble as I climb up.</p><p>...Well, it&#39;s ridiculous, but it&#39;s not totally reckless.</p><p>Normally, one climbs like this near the top of a mountain.</p><hr><p>The wall isn&#39;t the only thing a climber fights against.</p><p>Just as the deep sea is a sanctuary that humans cannot violate, high places are also a sacred place.</p><hr><p>There&#39;s not enough oxygen above the altitude of six thousand meters, and untrained people cannot stay there for more than a few hours.</p><p>Nausea, dizziness, brain edema from lack of oxygen, and finally, death.</p><p>This is a hell that gets worse the higher you go.</p><hr><p>And intense cold. Your bare skin would freeze, and even a slight scratch would turn into necrosis.</p><p>Climbing is done in such extreme environments.</p><p>Compared to that, merely climbing a wall is hardly impossible.</p><hr><p>&quot;――――But still――――&quot;</p><p>...It&#39;s still hard.</p><p>I can only use the tips of my fingers.</p><p>I have to put my weight there and support my body using a small foothold.</p><p>I can&#39;t keep up with him unless I&#39;ve trained every inch of my body...!</p><hr><p>&quot;Hm...? Hold on, she moved. I thought it was above, but it&#39;s actually below us.

How can I go inside!?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I don&#39;t care, break through it.&quot;</p><p>&quot;...! You fraud, if it was going to be like this...&quot;</p><p>It would&#39;ve been so much easier if we&#39;d just gone inside using that tree――――!</p><hr><p>&quot;......!&quot;</p><p>I jump into the castle.</p><p>I break the window and jump in using the same motion.</p><p>I grab the wall with both hands, swing my body at the window, and kick my way in.</p><hr><p>&quot;Ha――――ah......!&quot;</p><p>I roll across the expensive-looking carpet.</p><p>My body was falling when I swung my legs.</p><p>If I&#39;d kicked out a bit later, I would&#39;ve hit the wall and landed back-first on the ground.</p><hr><p>&quot;Damn, I&#39;d die if I fell on my head from the third floor...&quot;</p><p>It&#39;s dangerous to kick into a window and roll while scattering glass shards, but it&#39;s no worse than expected.</p><p>&quot;......Shirou?&quot;</p><p>―――The instant I raise my head...</p><p>All trifling matters escape my mind.</p><hr><p>&quot;――――Illya.&quot;</p><p>I forget I&#39;m in enemy territory.</p><p>I recall what happened in the yard.</p><p>Illya told me goodbye with a false smile.</p><hr><p>&quot;――――Unbelievable. Why did you come, Shirou? There&#39;s nothing you can do now. Are you going to waste your effort again?&quot;</p><p>A cold voice.</p><p>Illya puts on a cold face.</p><hr><p>&quot;――――――――&quot;</p><p>I&#39;m used to it.</p><p>I&#39;m used to seeing that face on her, but...</p><hr><p>&quot;You still don&#39;t understand? You can leave Sakura to me. This is my duty, so you can just go home and...&quot;</p><p>&quot;Idiot. Don&#39;t say dealing with the aftermath is your duty.&quot;</p><p>I slap her across the cheek, unable to forgive her.</p><hr><p>&quot;Wha―――― H-How dare you...!

I&#39;d be punching you if you were a guy, you bad girl...!&quot;</p><hr><p>I yell back at her.</p><p>I&#39;m happy to be able to see her, but I&#39;m really angry.</p><hr><p>&quot;W-What!? I didn&#39;t do anything to make you mad! I went with Sakura to fulfill my role! It was the best decision I could make, so you don&#39;t have the right to complain――――&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Shut up, I don&#39;t care about that...!</p><p>Look, I don&#39;t know about your role. I just came to bring back a bad girl who ran away selfishly.</p><p>I won&#39;t be tricked, no matter how much you bluff and pretend you&#39;re all right. I&#39;m going to take you home as long as you don&#39;t want to be here...!&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Wha―――― W-Who&#39;s bluffing!? I&#39;m not hating it. This body is made to be a Holy Grail. I don&#39;t like becoming the key for them, but if I can use the power of the Holy Grail, Sakura will...&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;That&#39;s called a bluff, you idiot!</p><p>......Look, I don&#39;t care about the Holy Grail. Illya is Illya. If you want to stay as yourself, just ignore all of this.

You kept him in this world, eh, Sakura?&quot;</p><p>―――That roar was definitely a signal fire for the hunt.</p><p>Telling us that the most fearsome hound has been unleashed.</p><p>It&#39;s like a death sentence placed upon a fleeing prisoner by an honorable, yet ruthless, lord.</p><hr><p>&quot;―――Berserker.&quot;</p><p>&quot;――――――――&quot;</p><p>My mind shifts into full alert.</p><p>Berserker.</p><p>I hear the name that embodies danger, and every last ounce of composure is squeezed from my body.</p><hr><p>&quot;Kotomine.&quot;</p><p>&quot;We&#39;ll retreat. We can do nothing even if we fight him. We will be killed once he catches up to us.&quot;</p><p>Kotomine leads the way to the castle gate.</p><hr><p>&quot;Don&#39;t look back, Illya...! Forget about him, Berserker isn&#39;t like before...!&quot;</p><hr><p>I take Illya&#39;s hand and start running.</p><p>―――We can&#39;t be holding back now.</p><p>If that mad warrior is after us, the only way for us to survive is to run with all our might for the whole three hours to the forest&#39;s edge...!</p><hr><p>―――It&#39;s hard to breathe.</p><p>A darkness I can&#39;t ignore no matter what is overtaking us.</p><hr><p>&quot;......!&quot;</p><p>I run through the forest.</p><p>I still don&#39;t see anything behind us.</p><p>All I hear is the sound of raging wind.</p><p>The pursuer is not a hound, but a huge monster.</p><p>As he cannot slip in between trees like us, he instead follows by knocking aside whatever blocks his path.</p><hr><p>...It feels like we&#39;re being chased by one of those heavy drills used for digging tunnels.</p><p>It&#39;s like there&#39;s a black wall bearing down to engulf us.</p><hr><p>&quot;Ah... haa, ha... no, I can&#39;t run that fast...!&quot;</p><p>&quot;...!&quot;</p><hr><p>I slow down to Illya&#39;s pace.</p><p>...This is bad.</p><p>The enemy&#39;s speed and ours are about the same.</p><p>He&#39;ll catch up to us in a minute if I try to run while carrying Illya――――!</p><hr><p>&quot;No...! I&#39;ll stay here, so escape by yourself, Shirou...!&quot;</p><p>&quot;He hasn&#39;t caught up to us yet...! Get on my back! One little girl&#39;s weight is nothing...!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Idiot, that&#39;s not true...!

His physical abilities are flowing into me now.</p><p>An overdose of strength-enhancing drugs.</p><p>The poison seeps into my body, letting me demonstrate abilities beyond my limits.</p><hr><p>――――That&#39;s fine.</p><p>Even if this may be contamination too great for a Geiger counter to measure, I appreciate it for now.</p><hr><p>But Kotomine&#39;s different.</p><p>I don&#39;t sense any usage of magecraft or leak of magical energy.</p><p>It&#39;s unbelievable, but he&#39;s running with Illya in his arms without any magical assistance...!</p><hr><p>&quot;Hey, are you really human...!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Not as much as you. But have you noticed? We can get away if we maintain this speed. It seems he cannot see through his eyes.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...!? He can&#39;t see?&quot;</p><p>&quot;That is the only reason I can think of.</p><p>He is faster. The trees in the forest are like pebbles beneath his feet. But he has yet to catch up to us, which must mean something is wrong with him.&quot;</p><hr><p>Kotomine plainly talks.</p><p>I don&#39;t know why he&#39;s talking about this with such disinterest, but...</p><hr><p>&quot;...We can manage to get away. So it all depends on our cardio!?&quot;</p><p>&quot;No. It seems things will not be that easy.&quot;</p><hr><p>A voice filled with hostility.</p><p>Before I&#39;m able to tell what he means...</p><p>&quot;――――Assassin――――!&quot;</p><p>My left arm writhes.</p><hr><p>&quot;......!&quot;</p><p>I see a white skull.</p><p>Assassin slips through the trees beside us, as if laughing at our attempts to escape...!</p><hr><p>&quot;Cra――――&quot;</p><p>By the time I realize how much trouble we&#39;re in, it&#39;s already too late.</p><p>On the other side of the trees is Assassin, raising his left arm over his head and――――</p><p>&quot;&quot;!?&quot;&quot;</p><p>Someone parries before it can pierce my skull.</p><hr><p>&quot;――――――――&quot;</p><p>I gasp.</p><p>There&#39;s only one person that can do such a thing.</p><p>Kotomine, still carrying Illya, parried the attack that was fired without any indication...!</p><hr><p>&quot;―――How annoying. He never appears when your hands are free, but he shows up as soon as you&#39;re preoccupied.&quot;</p><p>Kotomine slows down.</p><p>...The priest frowns and glares at the black assassin keeping pace with us.</p><hr><p>&quot;Kotomine?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I will leave Illya to you. I shall take care of him in turn.</p><p>I am a priest, after all. I have experience with exorcising evil spirits.&quot;</p><p>Kotomine stops and lets Illya down.</p><hr><p>&quot;Wha――――are you serious!?&quot;</p><p>I pull the bewildered girl towards me.</p><p>At the same time―――three daggers are fired like bullets...!</p><p>&quot;Kotomine――――!&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;――――It&#39;s sharp, but too direct. The course of the attacks is too easy to read for an assassin.&quot;</p><p>&quot;――――――――&quot;</p><p>I doubt my eyes.</p><p>Assassin fired three sword flashes.</p><p>The priest easily knocked them all aside――――!</p><hr><p>&quot;[wacky len=12]――――&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...!&quot;</p><p>Berserker...!</p><p>Damn, that was close! He&#39;ll catch up to us if we slow down here...!</p><hr><p>&quot;――――!&quot;</p><p>This is no time to be indecisive.</p><p>I have to go ahead with Illya...!</p><hr><p>&quot;It&#39;s fine, right...!? I&#39;m going, Kotomine...!&quot;</p><p>&quot;That is what I am telling you. You do not need to worry about me.&quot;</p><p>―――I hold Illya in my arms.</p><p>I can&#39;t run as fast as Kotomine, but this is still faster than having her run with me...!</p><hr><p>I turn my back to the priest.</p><p>The dark roar is coming from another part of the forest.</p><p>It&#39;s surely coming closer while destroying everything in its path.</p><hr><p>I have nothing to say to Kotomine.</p><p>Trusting him with my back and running with all speed will be my best reply.</p><p>―――And right when I&#39;m about to start off...</p><hr><p>&quot;―――Emiya. Do not kill the person if the one you saved is a woman.</p><p>Having her die in front of you hits you pretty hard.&quot;</p><p>The priest says something strange, his voice heavy with self-derision.</p><hr><p>&quot;......Eh?&quot;</p><p>&quot;It&#39;s just a meaningless warning. Hurry. If your only pursuer is Berserker, you should be able to escape. The rest of the fight is up to you, Emiya Shirou.&quot;</p><p>&quot;――――――――&quot;</p><p>I nod and start off.</p><hr><p>―――Their shadows recede into the distance.</p><p>His back is so far away.</p><p>...I have a bad feeling.</p><p>I think we will never see each other alive again.</p><hr><h2 id="scene-13-over-load" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#scene-13-over-load" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Scene 13 over load</h2><p>―――It&#39;s a bit abrupt.</p><p>But driving away evil spirits is not a priest&#39;s duty.</p><hr><p>A priest preaches about the teachings of God, but doesn&#39;t drive away evil spirits.</p><p>Their god is one and absolute.

Did you know he was just a collection of worms?&quot;</p><p>&quot;――――&quot;</p><p>He turns to the voice.</p><p>Assassin is no longer there.</p><p>The only things on the tree are the Black Keys and a small trace of blood.</p><hr><p>&quot;...I&#39;ve known him for a long time. I knew he was a spirit that used worms to tamper with this world. It would do no good to rip his body to pieces. If one were to kill him, one would have to completely eliminate his body, or...&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Attack the spirit itself, as you did, eh?</p><p>I see. The magus had a strong binding to the world, but he&#39;s vulnerable to the holy words of the Bible.</p><p>Exorcist, eh? One might say you were Matou Zouken&#39;s natural enemy.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;――――――――&quot;</p><p>The priest doesn&#39;t answer, but checks on his wounded body.</p><p>The bleeding has stopped.</p><p>He&#39;s out of weapons, but he suffered no fatal wounds, and his strength should return once he rests for a few minutes.</p><hr><p>&quot;So, what are you going to do, Assassin? Your Master is gone. My holy words should have an effect on you now that your source of magical energy is gone.&quot;</p><p>&quot;...I would assume so. My body will soon disappear. Without a Master, I am no different from the wandering spirits in this forest. My body will degrade to that of a lowly spirit within a day, and I shall disappear from this world.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Correct. I can harm Servants without Masters.</p><p>So, what will you do? Will you avenge your Master?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I am not so foolish as that. He suffered defeat because of his own arrogance. It is not my fault.</p><p>But still, something does not make sense, and that I must ask of you.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;You must mean how your Zabaniya failed.</p><p>I believe you obtained your arm from Shaytaan, but it will have no effect on me as long as it bears the name of the fallen angel.</p><p>That arm punishes humans, so it cannot curse one of its own kind. As my heart is not human, it is strong against such a curse.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;――――I thought so. Your heart was the same as that girl&#39;s.</p><p>You must already be tainted.&quot;</p><p>The priest doesn&#39;t answer.</p><p>He merely smiles ironically.</p><hr><p>&quot;...But how did you know? You could not act as you did unless you knew my arm would have no effect on you.</p><p>Your intention was to have me use my Noble Phantasm, correct?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes. I already knew about your arm, Assassin.</p><p>A cursed arm that creates an image of the target&#39;s heart and swaps it with the real heart.</p><p>That&#39;s how you killed my Servant.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;――――! Then you...&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes, I watched it until he died.</p><p>It&#39;s natural that I knew about your arm. Your blunder was made the instant you killed Lancer.&quot;</p><p>&quot;――――Damn, that was indeed a blunder.&quot;</p><p>Assassin tut-tuts in self-deprecation.</p><p>His hostility disappears at the same time.</p><p>He must be satisfied with the answer, as he quickly retreats.</p><hr><p>&quot;...So he went to look for another Master.</p><p>I&#39;d assume his next Master would be Matou Sakura―――&quot;</p><p>That&#39;s not a problem for the priest.</p><p>It&#39;s fine as long as Matou Zouken doesn&#39;t kill Matou Sakura.</p><hr><p>Zouken&#39;s wish is immortality.</p><p>He can achieve his wish by having Sakura&#39;s body turn into the Holy Grail.</p><p>The curse in the Holy Grail will not hatch if the old man is alive.</p><p>It&#39;s meaningless if Sakura becomes his tool.</p><p>She needs to remain a Master.</p><p>Because...</p><hr><p>&#39;――――You will never find it.</p><p>You were defective from birth―――&#39;</p><hr><p>&quot;――――――――&quot;</p><p>He gets dizzy.</p><p>It must be because of the fatigue and loss of blood.</p><p>The priest leans against the wall and closes his eyes.</p><hr><p>It all happened ten years ago.</p><hr><p>&#39;Defective from birth――――&#39;</p><hr><p>The man did everything he could after accepting the fact.</p><p>He couldn&#39;t understand morals, but had common sense. So his teenage years were spent trying to overcome his defect.</p><p>But it never happened.</p><p>The man&#39;s purgatories and sufferings were entirely useless.</p><p>And his final attempt was a woman.</p><hr><p>It&#39;s a simple story.</p><p>Every human wishes to love one of the opposite sex, have a family, and die peacefully.</p><p>Even if one may detest the peace, one can only dream about it.</p><p>This man is no exception.</p><p>He wished for such a thing, even though he felt no fascination in it.</p><p>He loved a woman, trying to earn ordinary happiness.</p><hr><p>The man chose a woman with no future.</p><p>She was terminally ill, only expected to live for a few years.</p><p>Did he choose her because of that, or was that his only choice?</p><p>He still doesn&#39;t know.</p><hr><p>Their life together lasted for about two years.</p><p>The man tried to love the woman.</p><p>The woman tried to love the man, did love him, and even had his child.</p><p>But the result didn&#39;t change.</p><p>It was because the man derived his happiness from the woman&#39;s suffering and his child&#39;s despair.</p><p>The more he tried to love, the more their suffering saved him.</p><hr><p>The contradiction didn&#39;t make the man suffer. He doesn&#39;t even know if he suffered.</p><p>But the more the woman tried to cure him, the more he wanted to see her grieve.</p><hr><p>The woman was a saint. She was sickly, but she was still a saint for him.</p><p>It need not be said how faithful she was or how deeply she understood his anger.</p><p>That&#39;s why the man was in despair.</p><p>No human will ever understand him and try to heal him to her degree. And this woman still could not fill the void within him.</p><hr><p>Then――――there was no need to live and question right and wrong.</p><p>He was born defective.</p><p>His birth was some kind of mistake.</p><p>He concluded that if his existence was a mistake, it was best to disappear. And he went to bid goodbye to the woman before he died.</p><p>He made her his wife as an experiment, so it&#39;s his natural duty to go tell her of his end.</p><hr><p>The woman loved Kotomine.</p><p>Kotomine tried to love the woman.</p><p>That&#39;s all there is to this story.</p><hr><p>The end came relatively quickly.</p><p>&quot;I could not love you.&quot;</p><p>That&#39;s all the man said in the room made of stone.</p><p>The dying woman smiled. She was unable to stand up, because her body was now composed of just skin and bone.</p><p>&quot;―――No. I love you.&quot;</p><p>With a smile, she took her own life.</p><hr><p>There was no way to stop her, and stopping her was meaningless.</p><p>The woman had a fatal disease. She would eventually die. He knew that when he chose her.</p><hr><p>The woman, covered in blood, looked up at the man and smiled.</p><p>&quot;See. You&#39;re crying.&quot;</p><p>He wasn&#39;t crying, of course.</p><p>It&#39;s just that the woman saw it that way.</p><p>The woman used her death to prove to him that he could love, and that he deserved to live.</p><p>The man silently left the room and broke away from the teachings of God.</p><hr><p>―――Yes.</p><p>He certainly felt sad.</p><p>But not because she died.</p><p>The man, at that time, thought...</p><p>&#39;How terrible. If she was going to die, I wanted to kill her myself.&#39;</p><hr><p>He grieved over losing the chance to enjoy her death.</p><hr><p>――――It happened long ago.</p><p>He can&#39;t remember her voice or her face.</p><p>But sometimes he thinks,</p><p>&#39;I wanted to kill her.&#39;</p><p>Is that for his pleasure, or―――</p><p>Is it grief over wanting to kill the one he loved with his own hands?</p><hr><p>He cuts off his thought process whenever the answer flickers in his head.</p><p>It&#39;s something that should be hidden forever.</p><p>The woman&#39;s death was meaningless.</p><p>Her devotion couldn&#39;t change him.</p><p>But the man didn&#39;t want to consider her death to be worthless.</p><p>―――So he stopped searching for answers.</p><hr><p>...It all happened long ago.</p><p>The memory of the man who feeds on others&#39; misfortunes.</p><p>The man later meets his nemesis.</p><p>Emiya Kiritsugu.</p><p>A magus that cast away what the man might have wanted――――</p><hr><p>&quot;――――――――&quot;</p><p>He opens his eyes.</p><p>It seems he fell asleep.</p><p>He checks his condition, starts to walk to catch up to Emiya Shirou, and...</p><hr><p>&quot;――――No, you can&#39;t go anywhere.</p><p>Because you die here.&quot;</p><hr><p>...Is interrupted by a girl.</p><hr><p>She has completely changed.</p><p>Her black outfit is her shadow.</p><p>She&#39;s covering her body with her own dark magical energy.</p><p>―――The amount and the presence of her magical energy is beyond human capabilities.</p><p>She&#39;s at the same level as pure heroic spirits, the Counter Guardians.</p><hr><p>&quot;...You are completely tainted, Matou Sakura.</p><p>You cannot change to that degree unless your mind is attuned to the curse.</p><p>―――So you&#39;ve accepted the fact that you&#39;re a human-eating monster.&quot;</p><p>Even though the priest wished for it, he still criticizes the girl.</p><p>As if to blame her for being intoxicated with her power.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Hah. But is it wrong to be drunk with your power?</p><p>It can&#39;t be helped.</p><p>Everyone picked on me too much. I think I would&#39;ve endured it longer if everyone was nicer to me.&quot;</p><p>&quot;――――Oh. Endure what?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Myself, priest-san.</p><p>I finally understand now. I hate this world.</p><p>The Tohsaka family that threw me away. Nee-san, who lived without any troubles. My scary grandfather and my pitiful brother. The people living peacefully without knowing about my pain.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;I can&#39;t allow such things now.</p><p>...I know I&#39;m just taking my anger out on others. I know it&#39;s wrong, but I still think this way.</p><p>―――Yes.</p><p>I wonder what kind of face the people who haven&#39;t helped me will make when they realize I exist.&quot;</p><hr><p>The girl smiles, as if it&#39;s a sacred pleasure.</p><p>The priest doesn&#39;t change his expression.</p><p>He keeps staring at the girl as if regarding something foul.</p><hr><p>&quot;You have changed, Matou Sakura. I see, your darkness was one of the qualities to adapt.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes, I&#39;ve changed. I&#39;m not the old Matou Sakura. That weak girl doesn&#39;t exist anymore.</p><p>...Yes. Everyone tormented me until now. So I&#39;m just getting back at them. The me who sat there and endured is gone.&quot;</p><hr><p>She laughs.</p><p>Double personality.</p><p>The original Matou Sakura disappeared, and the other personality surfaced.</p><p>That&#39;s the only logical reason for her change.</p><p>But...</p><p>&quot;―――What are you talking about? You don&#39;t need to hide it, Matou Sakura.&quot;</p><p>The priest quickly denies it.</p><hr><p>&quot;W――――What do you mean?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I said there&#39;s no need to hide it.</p><p>You are not another personality. You were swallowed by the mud and have become addicted to violence, but you are still Matou Sakura. You don&#39;t need to prepare another personality to excuse yourself.&quot;</p><p>Her face stiffens.</p><p>He&#39;s absolutely right.</p><p>The girl grits her teeth and glares back at the priest.</p><hr><p>&quot;What are you saying!? You&#39;re the one who made me like this...!&quot;</p><p>The girl&#39;s shadow reacts to her hateful voice.</p><p>―――A blazing infringement.</p><p>The shadow covers the ground in an instant.</p><hr><p>&quot;I won&#39;t deny it. I kept you alive so that you would remain its Master. You measured up to my expectations, and you are about to give birth to Avenger.</p><p>You have easily accomplished what I could not.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;It wasn&#39;t easy at all...! You don&#39;t know how painful it was, how much pain I&#39;m going through right now...!&quot;</p><p>&quot;I don&#39;t know, and there&#39;s no need to know. I&#39;m not so mad as to listen to a girl&#39;s complaint.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;――――! ............I see.</p><p>You&#39;re right. I don&#39;t want you to know.</p><p>I won&#39;t let you feel compassion. I&#39;m in a position where I can make anyone realize whatever I want.&quot;</p><p>She smiles cruelly.</p><hr><p>&quot;――――――――&quot;</p><p>The priest retreats without any hesitation.</p><p>He quickly backs away, like when he captured Matou Zouken.</p><hr><p>―――The priest retreats with one jump.</p><p>She may have vast magical energy, but she&#39;s still inexperienced.</p><p>She has no experience with battle, and she&#39;s unskilled as a magus. It&#39;s easy for him to retreat.</p><hr><p>&quot;―――How foolish. Do you think you can get away from me?&quot;</p><hr><p>She smiles.</p><p>The priest falls to the ground at that instant.</p><hr><p>&quot;Guh――――gah......!&quot;</p><p>He rolls down.</p><p>He falls to the ground, coughing up blood.</p><p>&quot;Haa――――hm, guh......!&quot;</p><p>It doesn&#39;t stop.</p><p>He can&#39;t stop coughing up blood. Every time he tries to breathe, it wells up in his throat.</p><hr><p>&quot;How does it feel to have someone grab hold of your heart? Your life&#39;s under my control, no matter where you are.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Mm――――guh――――!&quot;</p><p>&quot;You died ten years ago. Emiya Kiritsugu shot your heart and you died. But you stayed alive because of one reason.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;You&#39;re that... hmm, who was it? It&#39;s the Servant I ate before, but I guess his name doesn&#39;t matter.</p><p>That gold person was showered with the contents of the Holy Grail, which connected him to it. But it couldn&#39;t taint that man, so it flowed into you, his Master. Right?</p><p>And you were resurrected.</p><p>Avenger. Your life was saved because Angra Manyu supplied you with magical energy.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Ha――――I see. Then this is...&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes. You&#39;re connected to Angra Manyu. But I&#39;m Angra Manyu.</p><p>――――So I squashed it. I destroyed the fake heart that kept you alive.</p><p>I can squash your organs too if you want.</p><p>I can pull out your insides, no matter where you are.&quot;</p><hr><p>She raises her hand.</p><p>How can she say &#39;if you want&#39;?</p><p>The girl has no intention of keeping him alive.</p><p>No matter how much he may beg for his life, she&#39;ll laugh as she kills him.</p><p>He&#39;ll give her back his fake life.</p><p>Because it&#39;s hers.</p><p>Even if it&#39;s just a speck next to her total magical energy, there&#39;s no reason for her to let the priest keep it.</p><hr><p>&quot;Goodbye. I appreciate the fact that you saved me.&quot;</p><p>She grasps her slender fingers together as if to twist apart an invisible doll.</p><p>A crushing sound.</p><p>The priest&#39;s body is squeezed like a rag.</p><p>One more twist.</p><p>The priest will die in the next second.</p><p>But right before that...</p><hr><p>&quot;――――! Ah, uh, ah――――!?&quot;</p><p>The girl doubles over in pain.</p><p>...She coughs up blood.</p><p>She scratches the ground, as if begging for help.</p><hr><p>&quot;Ku――――it hurts, no... don&#39;t... come in――――!&quot;</p><p>The shadow expands.</p><p>...What happened? The shadow on her body expands, then slowly shrinks back to the original size.</p><hr><p>&quot;......No way...... Berserker lost...?&quot;</p><p>There&#39;s no other explanation.</p><p>Berserker was defeated.</p><p>He died, dissolved into pure magical energy, and was consumed by her, the Holy Grail.</p><hr><p>&quot;――――Ah――――Ah――――&quot;</p><p>Her mind distorts.</p><p>The personality called Matou Sakura is pushed even further into a corner now.</p><p>...She can&#39;t move any farther, but the great soul pushes her against the wall.</p><hr><p>&quot;――――――――――――Ah.&quot;</p><p>...She&#39;ll disappear.</p><p>She&#39;ll disappear.</p><p>Matou Sakura will disappear.</p><p>&quot;――――――――Before that...&quot;</p><p>She thinks of killing the priest, looks up, and is annoyed by her failure to follow through.</p><hr><p>&quot;――――Fine. He&#39;s... going... to die... anyway.&quot;</p><p>There&#39;s no one at the ruin.</p><p>On the ground where Kotomine Kirei lay is his blood-soaked outfit.</p><hr><h2 id="scene-16-truth-antihero-angra-manyu" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#scene-16-truth-antihero-angra-manyu" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Scene 16 Truth-Antihero Angra Manyu</h2><p>We reach the forest&#39;s edge faster than I expected.</p><p>It&#39;s probably because I had Illya&#39;s guidance.</p><p>The car I arrived in is gone.</p><p>We started walking to town, stopped a car, and got a lift.</p><hr><p>We&#39;re both filthy after running through the forest, making us look really suspicious.</p><p>So I jumped out in front of a car to stop it, and Illya used suggestion on the driver to make him pick us up.</p><p>Man.</p><p>I never thought I&#39;d get a ride like this.</p><hr><p>&quot;We&#39;re home, Shirou. Let&#39;s go in.&quot;</p><p>&quot;――――Eh?&quot;</p><p>We&#39;re back at my place in an instant.</p><p>The sun&#39;s setting.</p><p>It seems I fell asleep on the way back.</p><hr><p>The sun has set by the time I make it to the living room.</p><p>It&#39;s past seven o&#39;clock already.</p><hr><p>&quot;―――――――――&quot;</p><p>Something&#39;s wrong.</p><p>Time&#39;s passing by too fast.</p><p>It was afternoon when I stepped into the house, so it&#39;s not possible for it to be night as soon as I step into the living room.</p><hr><p>&quot;Illya. Isn&#39;t time passing by too fast?&quot;</p><p>I talk to Illya, standing beside me.</p><hr><p>&quot;――――――――&quot;</p><p>But Illya isn&#39;t there.</p><p>Illya is...</p><p>&quot;Hm? The dinner was good, Shirou.&quot;</p><p>...Already in the living room, saying strange things.</p><hr><p>&quot;――――――――Dinner?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yeah. I was surprised you wanted to get energy before anything, but I&#39;m glad we did. You were so enthusiastic while you were cooking.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;――――――――&quot;</p><p>There are remnants of dinner on the table.</p><p>There are dishes in the sink.</p><p>Come to think of it, I feel pretty full.</p><p>It seems I really did make dinner.</p><hr><p>&quot;......That&#39;s strange. Did we have this in stock?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Nope. That&#39;s why we were dropped off at the shopping district to get some groceries.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;――――――――&quot;</p><p>I look through my memory.</p><p>......</p><p>............</p><p>..................</p><p>........................Well.</p><p>I guess that&#39;s what happened.</p><hr><p>&quot;I see. I guess I&#39;m talking nonsense. So we had dinner, huh?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yeah. All that&#39;s left is to rest.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Hm―――yeah, we have to rest. I&#39;m going to go change in my room. I need to talk, so please stay up. I&#39;ll be back right away.&quot;</p><p>Illya nods.</p><p>I raise my hand in apology and leave the living room.</p><hr><p>And the next thing I know, I&#39;m in my room.</p><p>The instant I step out of the living room, I&#39;m on the floor in my bedroom.</p><hr><p>&quot;Ah... Guh――――!&quot;</p><p>I wake up because of the piercing pain.</p><p>A sword&#39;s pierced in my chest.</p><p>That&#39;s the first thing I imagine because my chest is hot and numb, and it feels like my life is draining out from it.</p><hr><p>&quot;Guh――――&quot;</p><p>There&#39;s no sword, of course.</p><p>It&#39;s just an illusion.</p><p>The left side of my chest is simply rebelling against my left arm.</p><p>But I finally realize.</p><p>My sense of time.</p><p>The intermittent scenes are...</p><hr><p>&quot;...I see. It&#39;s not my sense of time that&#39;s odd.&quot;</p><p>It&#39;s just that my mind is screwed up.</p><p>It&#39;s not that I have no memory. I just can&#39;t record the events into my brain.</p><hr><p>I can&#39;t hold events in my mind unless I concentrate on them.</p><p>It&#39;s natural that I can&#39;t remember anything that happened after I left the forest.</p><p>I can&#39;t stay conscious unless I&#39;m in pain, like now.</p><hr><p>&quot;――――――This is bad.&quot;</p><p>I frantically grasp at my fading consciousness.</p><p>Unless I consciously focus my mind, Emiya Shirou will disappear.</p><p>Only pain or the utmost concentration can preserve my memories.</p><p>In short, I have to maintain the level of concentration I had when I was trying to insert the Magic Circuit into my spine.</p><hr><p>&quot;――――――――&quot;</p><p>...I&#39;m stumped.</p><p>I can&#39;t keep this up forever, and I don&#39;t know how long it&#39;ll work.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Wait. That means I shouldn&#39;t sleep.&quot;</p><p>Once I fall asleep, I won&#39;t be able to wake up.</p><p>Once I fall asleep, &quot;Emiya Shirou&quot; will never return.</p><p>Even if my body&#39;s unwounded, my mind would be scattered.</p><hr><p>&quot;――――――――――&quot;</p><p>I raise my body.</p><p>I search through my desk. I need a small blade. Something I can hide in my right hand that&#39;ll dig into my flesh if I make a fist.</p><p>I can&#39;t keep up the concentration I have during training.</p><p>I have to clench my fist every time I relax so that the pain will keep me conscious.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Oh. It&#39;s not a blade, but this might do.&quot;</p><p>I find the crystal from that day.</p><p>...The pendant I found beside me after I was killed by Lancer.</p><p>I don&#39;t know how much magical energy was originally in this, but now there&#39;s not even enough for one strengthening magecraft left in it.</p><hr><p>...That&#39;s right. Now, I can clearly think about who this pendant belongs to, and who could have saved me that night.</p><p>After all, she was the only other person at school at that time. I don&#39;t know why she saved me, but she wouldn&#39;t need a reason to save a life.</p><hr><p>&quot;Ah――――!&quot;</p><p>My consciousness starts to fade away.</p><p>I&#39;ll think about it later.</p><p>I&#39;ll fall unconscious if I think about happy things and relax.</p><hr><p>―――I check my condition.</p><p>I released the seal on my left arm.</p><p>I put the Shroud back on it, but it&#39;s only there to ease my mind.</p><p>According to Kotomine, the switch would be tripped if I used Archer&#39;s arm.</p><p>He said there&#39;d nothing I could do after that.</p><hr><p>&quot;――――――――&quot;</p><p>But I can still move my body.</p><p>The problem is my mind, but I can stay conscious as long as I stay awake.</p><p>As for projection... I can probably project three more times using Archer&#39;s arm.</p><hr><p>I know I can manage it once.</p><p>I&#39;m scared about the second time.</p><p>The third will be fatal. I think my body will self-destruct, even if my mind&#39;s still alive.</p><hr><p>&quot;............&quot;</p><p>I close my eyes and strain my ears.</p><p>...I hear creaking sounds along with my heartbeat.</p><hr><p>...The thing invading my body from Archer&#39;s arm.</p><p>It gets harder to suppress his Reality Marble the more I use his Blade Works. Eventually, an infinite number of blades will be created inside my body instead of outside.</p><p>...I don&#39;t even want to imagine what&#39;ll happen.</p><p>A thousand blades will pierce my body from within, killing me instantly.</p><hr><p>&quot;―――――Don&#39;t kid me. I won&#39;t kill myself.&quot;</p><p>I&#39;m in a hopeless condition.</p><p>I accept the whole situation.</p><p>But I reject the facts as they stand.</p><p>I won&#39;t die, and I won&#39;t self-destruct.</p><p>Not waking up after I fall asleep is just a product of my frightened imagination.</p><hr><p>―――I&#39;ll be saved.</p><p>I&#39;ll be saved once I do everything I need to.</p><p>It&#39;s meaningless otherwise.</p><p>I said I&#39;ll protect Sakura no matter what.</p><p>So I can&#39;t just die selfishly.</p><hr><p>&quot;―――That&#39;s right. I have to contact Tohsaka first.&quot;</p><p>I don&#39;t have time.</p><p>I&#39;ll go to her house.</p><p>I&#39;m worried about whether Kotomine&#39;s all right, but he&#39;s not my ally anymore now that we&#39;ve saved Illya.</p><p>I can&#39;t ask for his help again, but the promise to...</p><hr><p>It&#39;s past nine o&#39;clock.</p><p>I thought I came back right away, but it&#39;s been two hours already.</p><hr><p>&quot;―――Sorry to keep you waiting, Illya. I&#39;m going to Tohsaka&#39;s house, so let&#39;s go together.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Rin&#39;s house? I don&#39;t mind, but why?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Eh... why? We have to meet up with Tohsaka. And I&#39;m worried about how she&#39;s doing.</p><p>Kotomine said she&#39;d heal by tonight, but I can&#39;t really trust him. If she&#39;s not doing well, I&#39;ll need to look after her.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Okay. That&#39;s fine, but Shirou...&quot;</p><p>Illya points to the wall.</p><p>――――Then.</p><hr><p>&quot;I&#39;m glad to know you&#39;re worrying about me. As you can see, I&#39;m all right.</p><p>But if you were that worried about me, I wish you&#39;d have come by my house before heading off to the forest.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;T-Tohsaka...!? When did you get here...?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;I was here about an hour ago. I heard from Illya what happened at the forest.&quot;</p><hr><p>Tohsaka&#39;s in a bad mood... No, she&#39;s angry.</p><p>It seems she doesn&#39;t like the fact that I went to the forest without her.</p><hr><p>&quot;I can&#39;t help it. I thought I had to act as quickly as possible, and Illya was in serious danger.</p><p>...Right, Illya?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;......Yeah. I wasn&#39;t locked up anywhere, but I could&#39;ve been taken to the Great Holy Grail and had my heart taken out at any time.</p><p>Zouken wanted to open the gate as soon as he took control of Sakura. I would be dead right now if Shirou and Kotomine had come a bit later.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;―――See. I wouldn&#39;t have made it if I&#39;d waited for you.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Who knows? So it all depended on Sakura, right? Tell me the truth, Illya.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh, you can tell?</p><p>Yeah, there was a bit more time. Sakura&#39;s strong, so she won&#39;t easily break. I think there was about one more day to spare until she lost herself and fell under Zouken&#39;s control.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;I thought so. You shouldn&#39;t pamper Shirou too much. A little strictness is just right for him.&quot;</p><p>&quot;―――You&#39;re right. I&#39;ll be grateful if you see to that.&quot;</p><hr><p>The two criticize me.</p><p>But if the time limit was a day, I don&#39;t think we would&#39;ve made it if I&#39;d waited for Tohsaka.</p><p>I was faced with an important choice in the forest, but in exchange, I&#39;m able to regain the time the three of us can spend together.</p><hr><p>&quot;――――!&quot;</p><p>...I concentrate hard, since I&#39;m starting to relax.</p><p>It seems the tension faded away during the conversation.</p><hr><p>&quot;......Hm......? Hold on, Illya.</p><p>You said Sakura might last one more day. Then the remaining time we have is...&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Half a day at most. ...No, no matter how hard Sakura tries, Avenger is about to be born. Once that happens, she will change completely. Nobody can save Sakura, and nobody will be saved.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;&quot;――――Avenger...?&quot;&quot;</p><p>Tohsaka and I frown at the strange word.</p><hr><p>&quot;Yes, Avenger.</p><p>It&#39;s the eighth class in the Holy Grail War. It&#39;s a &#39;violation&#39; that the Einzberns summoned by breaking the rules.</p><p>That&#39;s what tainted the contents of the Great Holy Grail.</p><p>It&#39;s the main body that assimilated with Sakura, projecting the shadow because it couldn&#39;t go into the outside world.</p><p>It&#39;s something that should not exist, consuming human lives to take form.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;That&#39;s Avenger―――an anti-hero that the Einzbern Master summoned in the third ritual.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;You know about it, Illya...!? You know what that shadow is, and what Sakura&#39;s possessed by...!?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yeah. I got the information out of Sakura, so I understand what&#39;s going on.</p><p>What we have to do. What, exactly, you&#39;ve made into your enemy.&quot;</p><hr><p>Illya closes her eyes once.</p><p>...Is that resignation?</p><p>Illya sighs and then stares at us.</p><hr><p>&quot;What I&#39;m about to talk about is the heart of the matter, and it&#39;s nothing that concerns you two. You shouldn&#39;t be burdened with this.</p><p>Shirou, Rin. As you two are the last Masters in the Holy Grail War, I shall tell you the truth.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Illya――――?&quot;</p><p>Tohsaka looks at Illya in surprise.</p><p>I do likewise.</p><p>Illya shows calmness and emptiness as if she&#39;s someone else.</p><hr><p>&quot;Everything started two hundred years ago.</p><p>No, the journey of those who seek the Holy Grail began long before that. But two hundred years ago, the ritual was begun in this land.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;I&#39;ll start from there.</p><p>The Holy Grail grants any wish. Einzbern, Makiri, and Tohsaka cooperated to conduct a ritual to summon the Holy Grail.</p><p>That&#39;s how the Holy Grail War came to be. A murderous battle between seven summoned Servants to determine the ownership of the Holy Grail.</p><p>Magi who are chosen as Masters become the hosts of the Servants and kill each other until only one magus remains.</p><p>That&#39;s the ostensible reason for the Holy Grail War that you two know of.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;You don&#39;t look surprised, Rin. So you had some idea of it, huh?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...Somewhat. I knew all along that I was being used, but I didn&#39;t mind it too much.</p><p>I&#39;m reaping the benefits by using somebody else&#39;s system. We&#39;re both using each other.</p><p>I&#39;m not stupid enough to get angry over something so trivial.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Really? Then I don&#39;t have to explain that the order is reversed? How about you, Shirou? Did you already know that the process of making the Servants fight is unnecessary?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;――――――――&quot;</p><p>...Well, I did know.</p><hr><p>Servants are summoned by the Holy Grail.</p><p>The heroic spirits are summoned to determine whether the summoner deserves the Holy Grail.</p><p>Once summoned, they make a contract with a Master to stay in this world and obtain the Holy Grail. Then they go out to defeat the other Masters and Servants.</p><hr><p>...In and of itself, that&#39;s not a problem.</p><p>But once I found out the defeated heroic spirits are absorbed into the Holy Grail, something felt off.</p><p>Heroic spirits―――Servants are only a factor in determining which Master is suited for the Holy Grail.</p><p>So why are they taken into the Holy Grail after their purpose has been served?</p><hr><p>&quot;...So does that mean heroic spirits are needed for the Holy Grail War, and Masters are just a tool to summon them?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Right. In the ritual of the war, Masters are mere receptors to summon the Servants. Once they&#39;ve done that, they can die at any time.</p><p>The heroic spirits are the only ones needed to complete the Holy Grail.</p><p>Heroic spirits are pure souls separate from the time axis. Though they are outside of this world&#39;s logic, they can still influence it.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;That&#39;s the power they needed.</p><p>They tried to exit into the outer world using that power.</p><p>That&#39;s the real purpose of the Holy Grail in this land.</p><p>The Holy Grail Wars were waged to create a phenomenon, a miracle, that is still out of human reach.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;That&#39;s the great ritual to attain immortality that&#39;s said to have been lost by the Einzberns.</p><p>Not a heroic spirit or a holy spirit, but a soul of a mere human that&#39;s fated to disappear from this world. Bringing it about is an act of God.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;―――The name of the miracle is &#39;Heavens Feel&#39;.</p><p>It&#39;s the golden cup that&#39;s the third of the five existing True Magics.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;S――――True Magics!? You mean &#39;those&#39; True Magics...!?&quot;</p><p>&quot;――――――――&quot;</p><p>The air tenses up.</p><p>Illya says that the Holy Grail is a ritual to perform a True magecraft.</p><hr><p>True magecraft.</p><p>A divine mystery that cannot be reached with magecraft. An impossible phenomenon that cannot be achieved by modern people.</p><p>It&#39;s the ultimate goal of every magus, and those who achieve it are called &quot;sorcerers&quot; with envy and awe.</p><hr><p>There are five True Magics acknowledged by the magecraft Association.</p><p>As I&#39;m not even in the Association, I have no way to know, but I&#39;ve heard that there are five True Magics and that there are about four sorcerers.</p><hr><p>&quot;W-Wait...! So the Third True magecraft is the materialization of the soul!? But Servants are materialized souls too...!&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;No. The system does use a part of the Third True magecraft, but the heroic spirits are summoned.</p><p>Servants aren&#39;t alive as part of this world or time. It&#39;s too imperfect to be the Third True magecraft. And heroic spirits can take form in this world without the help of True magecraft as long as they have a host.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Heavens Feel is not a spell that duplicates a soul perceived in the past.</p><p>It&#39;s actually a spell to make an existence of a higher dimension that can take a spirit form and still influence the physical world.</p><p>It takes a soul and elevates it to the next level of life.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Next step――――that&#39;s certainly serious, but...</p><p>Even though the details are different, all True Magics are a way to reach the origin! What does it have to do with the Holy Grail?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;No. First of all, there&#39;s only one administrated land in Japan that can activate a True magecraft.</p><p>I know the ley line in Fuyuki is first-class, but there&#39;s not enough distortion to connect to the origin.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Right. It&#39;s not distorted enough to reach the origin. That&#39;s why you make a hole. If the path is obstructed, you have to destroy the wall yourself, right?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;The Holy Grail War is the process of destroying the wall.</p><p>The process accumulates enough magical energy to grant any wish. But that&#39;s just a secondary matter for the Einzbern family. And it was also an advertisement to call for the Masters, the sacrifices.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;The Einzberns only needed a giant magecraft circle that could store great amounts of magical energy without attracting the notice of the magecraft Association.</p><p>The head of the Tohsaka family at that time cooperated with them.</p><p>This country doesn&#39;t receive much attention from the Association, and there aren&#39;t many first-class lands that rank next to Aozaki&#39;s land.</p><p>Fuyuki City was almost the perfect test site, meeting all the requirements.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;You should be able to figure out the rest.</p><p>There are two kinds of Holy Grails that govern the Holy Grail War.</p><p>The Holy Grail in this land and the Holy Grail Einzbern prepares.</p><p>The former is a magecraft circle that uses the land administrated by Tohsaka.</p><p>This is called the Great Holy Grail.</p><p>The key that the Einzbern family prepares for each ritual is called the Holy Grail.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;The Great Holy Grail administers the system of the Holy Grail War. The Holy Grail collects the souls of the defeated heroic spirits and acts as the reactor core to activate the Great Holy Grail.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;And once the Holy Grail collects enough souls to activate the Great Holy Grail, it uses the heroic spirits&#39; souls to open a hole.</p><p>The Great Holy Grail fixes the small hole created when the heroic spirits return to their original place after their roles are fulfilled. This opens up the passage to the origin that humans cannot reach.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Of course, this is just the first step. Your wish isn&#39;t granted even if the hole is opened. The path to the origin is too far.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;But―――the one who obtains the Holy Grail gains access to unlimited magical energy.</p><p>The other side has large quantities of unused magical energy unlike anything seen on this side. For an ordinary magus, it&#39;s nothing short of a miracle.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;......I see. So the Great Holy Grail is the magecraft circle which serves as the foundation, and the Holy Grail is the key to activate it.</p><p>The Holy Grail Wars must occur on a sixty-year cycle to accumulate enough magical energy to summon the heroic spirits.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;There&#39;s no way you can carry out such a summoning with one person&#39;s magical energy.</p><p>The Great Holy Grail draws magical energy from the land slowly so as not to deplete it, and once it&#39;s full―――&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Yes, it summons the heroic spirits as Servants.</p><p>But you need an incentive to summon the heroic spirits. They won&#39;t heed your call unless you give them what they want.</p><p>That&#39;s why the Holy Grail was prepared to reward them.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...Well, that&#39;s a deception from the start.</p><p>The Einzberns just wanted the souls of the heroic spirits.</p><p>They didn&#39;t care about their rank. They just wanted strong souls.</p><p>To hide that fact, they created the Holy Grail War as a cover. They deceived the Servants and Masters and made them kill each other.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...Well, I guess that started from the second ritual.</p><p>The first was conducted in a foolishly honest manner and failed right away because the three families fought for its exclusive right.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;So the rule was made starting with the second ritual.</p><p>̠ Outsiders were called and made to fight for the Holy Grail.</p><p>Masters from outside the families were just an inconvenience after the Servants had been summoned, so it more efficient to have them killed in battle.</p><p>It was convenient for the three families because they could legitimately kill their collaborators.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Unbelievable. So the rule for Masters to kill each other exists because they couldn&#39;t decide who gets the ownership by talking and had to resort to violence?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Yup. But choosing the last magus standing proved to be an even better method than expected.</p><p>It&#39;s just like you. There were Servants and Masters that found out they were tricked, but it seems they didn&#39;t care. It&#39;s because you obtain the Holy Grail if you win.&quot;</p><hr><p>Tohsaka&#39;s convinced.</p><p>&quot;.........&quot;</p><p>...In short, the Holy Grail War is not a battle to obtain the Holy Grail, but a ritual to escape to the outside world.</p><hr><p>Attempts to reach the outside world.</p><p>According to hermeticism, there&#39;s a power that governs dimensional theory outside of this world.</p><p>It&#39;s called the &#39;swirl of the origin&#39;, and it&#39;s a coordinate that&#39;s considered to be the beginning of all things.</p><p>It&#39;s the start and the end of all creation. It&#39;s the seat of God, recording everything and able to create anything.</p><hr><p>&quot;.........&quot;</p><p>But I really don&#39;t care about that.</p><p>My father would&#39;ve understood what a big deal it is, but it doesn&#39;t concern me.</p><p>What&#39;s possessing Sakura is much more important to me than how it all started.</p><hr><p>&quot;Illya. I don&#39;t care about the real purpose of the war. It has nothing to do with us, just like you said.</p><p>More importantly, tell us about the thing you mentioned earlier.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;It has nothing to do with us!? We&#39;re talking about True magecraft here! And the Third True magecraft at that! It&#39;s the taboo out of all taboos that&#39;s been kept a secret even within the association!</p><p>If you&#39;re a magus, you can&#39;t ignore something like this――――&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;I can. ...Man, why do you have the wrong idea, Tohsaka?</p><p>This isn&#39;t the time to be talking about something that can&#39;t succeed anyway.&quot;</p><p>&quot;C-Can&#39;t succeed? What are you basing that on?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Hey now. I don&#39;t know why, but the Holy Grail War has never had a victor. That means there&#39;s something wrong with the ritual.</p><p>...First of all, how will you explain what&#39;s happening to Sakura? If the Holy Grail&#39;s a path to reach True magecraft, does that mean Sakura&#39;s like that because of True magecraft?&quot;</p><p>Maybe I convinced her, because she shuts her mouth.</p><hr><p>&quot;So, Illya. Why did the Holy Grail War turn out like this?</p><p>Kotomine said there&#39;s something in the Holy Grail.</p><p>So is this that Avenger thing? And he&#39;s not in the Holy Grail, Sakura or Illya, but in the magecraft circle you called the Great Holy Grail?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh, Kotomine would know, wouldn&#39;t he?</p><p>He&#39;s a magus tainted by Avenger, just like Sakura. He already knows what&#39;s inside the Holy Grail.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Eh...? Kotomine and Sakura are the same...?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;That&#39;s right. This concerns you two.</p><p>This is about what Zouken&#39;s trying to obtain, what&#39;s changing Sakura, what&#39;s hiding in the Holy Grail, and what&#39;s tainting the souls of the heroic spirits.</p><p>Its class name is Avenger.</p><p>The heroic spirit that&#39;s about to take a living form through the power of the Holy Grail, a successful example of the Third True magecraft.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...What? What was all that about True Magics not having to do with this? It does concern them.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;No. Avenger&#39;s materialization isn&#39;t True magecraft carried out by the Holy Grail. From the start, it is a heroic spirit with that specific attribute.</p><p>It can take form within the Holy Grail because it&#39;s Avenger.</p><p>The Holy Grail merely summoned an avenger that can use the Third True magecraft, so it doesn&#39;t mean that the Great Holy Grail used the Third True magecraft.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;......? So in short, it&#39;s a monster that can materialize?</p><p>It&#39;s someone who can embody the Third True magecraft even if the Great Holy Grail doesn&#39;t?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Yes. It all started during the third ritual.</p><p>The first one was a failure. Einzbern was defeated quickly in the second war, and in desperation, they summoned a spirit that specialized in killing.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;They used an old scripture, a foreign folklore they obtained, as catalyst to summon the worst evil possible.</p><p>They summoned what they shouldn&#39;t have summoned to kill all the other Masters, to activate the Great Holy Grail, and to keep all the achievement to themselves.</p><p>――――The spirit&#39;s name is Angra Manyu.</p><p>A murderous anti-hero that embodies every curse in this world.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;――――Angra... Manyu?&quot;</p><p>...Hold on.</p><p>Angra Manyu is the name of the ancient Persian devil.</p><p>It&#39;s the embodiment of evil, the greatest devil in Zoroastrianism. It fights a nine-thousand-year battle againts Ahura Mazda, protector of human goodness.</p><p>Zoroastrianism is a story mainly about the battle between these two gods. It&#39;s the first religion to come up with the doctrine of duality, the angels and the devil.</p><hr><p>But the story contains no hero named Angra Manyu.</p><p>First of all, how can someone crowned with the name of the king of devils become a heroic spirit?</p><hr><p>&quot;That&#39;s not possible, Illya. The Holy Grail can only call on heroic spirits, and you don&#39;t need the Holy Grail if you can reproduce phenomena on the divine spirit level.</p><p>No, first of all, there can&#39;t be a heroic spirit with the name Angra Manyu. Even if there was, it would be a nameless evil spirit that left no mark on history. Even if it were summoned, its soul wouldn&#39;t be compatible with the Holy Grail.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...Illya. What did the Einzberns&#39; Master summon?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;I said Angra Manyu, Rin.</p><p>...He was certainly nameless, and not a devil. But a hero with the name Angra Manyu did exist.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...Yes, the story takes place a long time ago. Insanely long ago, in a very small world.</p><p>It was a hero that lived in a small, nameless village that practiced Zoroastrianism.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;I don&#39;t know how distorted their doctrine was.</p><p>I don&#39;t know what led them to that idea.</p><p>But they lived cleanly and righteously in accordance with their precepts.</p><p>People are supposed to value goodness, protect the light, and live virtuous lives.</p><p>For these people, segregated from the rest of the world, this supplication was absolute. It was probably the only source of human pride that they knew.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;――――Yes.</p><p>The people in the village earnestly wished for everyone to live in peace.</p><p>So everyone could be free from malice and live pure, upright lives.</p><p>They renounced such human concerns as hunger, conflict, love, and hate. They were proud to be worthy of God&#39;s blessing.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;But it was impossible.</p><p>People can&#39;t be freed from malice just through clean, righteous living.</p><p>From the moment we are born, there is evil in us. You must take certain measures if you want to separate evil from yourself.</p><p>And――――those measures were taken.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;They came up with a way to save not just their small village, but the whole world.</p><p>It&#39;s hard to make everyone do good.</p><p>But you can prove everyone&#39;s goodness.</p><p>...You just need one person.</p><p>If one person embodies all the evils of the world, the rest of the people cannot be evil, no matter what.</p><p>They seriously believed in such a simple, child-like theory.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;And one young man was chosen as a sacrifice.</p><p>They captured him, carved every cursed word onto his body, forced every sin imaginable upon him, and held him responsible for all evils in the world.</p><p>That&#39;s all.</p><p>A small world. But an ultimate evil was born in this one complete world.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;The people cursed, scorned, feared, yet adored this man.</p><p>They believed they were pure and righteous, since all the world&#39;s evil was within him.</p><p>They seriously believed it&#39;d save everyone in the world and created a devil.</p><p>To demonstrate human goodness, they continuously tortured one man until he went insane. No, they would not allow him to die until he succumbed to old age.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...The name of the devil that corrupts men.</p><p>He was given the name Angra Manyu, and was irrationally hated by everyone in the world.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;I don&#39;t know if he really did turn into a devil during the process.</p><p>But everyone in his village believed him to be so, and they treated him accordingly. They hated and feared him, but he was the proof of their goodness. They revered him as the sign of their salvation.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;He was the object of everyone&#39;s hate, but he saved people.</p><p>His existence pardoned everyone of their evil deeds.</p><p>Though his method was unusual, he still saved people.</p><p>He became a hero for the villagers.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;And a hero was born.</p><p>Hated by people, losing his self... Someone who transformed into exactly what they wanted. A helpless sacrifice that came to represent all the world&#39;s evil.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;―――That&#39;s the anti-hero Angra Manyu.</p><p>An ordinary person without any special talent that was determined to be all evils of the world.</p><p>The king of devils that approves of all six billion evils in Zoroastrianism. He&#39;s a curse made by a concept of ancient people.&quot;</p><hr><p>Illya finishes her story with no sign of bitterness or contempt.</p><p>...Anti-hero.</p><p>Kotomine introduced me to the term when the war started.</p><hr><p>&quot;............&quot;</p><p>...But.</p><p>If Illya&#39;s story is true, the guy who turned into Angra Manyu is still burdened with all the sins.</p><p>It&#39;s because that&#39;s his reason of existence.</p><hr><p>A heroic spirit who&#39;s had six billion sins pushed onto him.</p><p>...If a guy like that is summoned, all that&#39;ll happen is a big massacre.</p><p>It&#39;d only be natural for him to hate people, and first of all, everyone around him established him to be evil.</p><hr><p>...Angra Manyu.</p><p>So the man is using Sakura to take revenge on the people... no, to carry out the role people pushed onto him?</p><hr><p>&quot;So I understand the story of Avenger... Angra Manyu.</p><p>But why is he in the Holy Grail? He&#39;s just an ordinary person, right? Even if he&#39;s given a devil&#39;s name and treated like one, he&#39;s still just a human.</p><p>That wouldn&#39;t turn him into a monster capable of eating the entire town.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...Yeah. Angra Manyu is human. He was just an ordinary man, but was forced to become a heroic spirit. So there wasn&#39;t any problem, originally.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...The Einzbern family summoned Angra Manyu in the third war.</p><p>But the summoned heroic spirit was weak.</p><p>The anti-hero was defeated in the early stage of the war, and the Holy Grail took him in. The Master of Einzbern grieved how this ordinary human could be a devil that destroys the human world.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...Yes. The heroic spirit was merely human.</p><p>A human that cursed the world.</p><p>A human who everyone wanted to represent their evil.</p><p>...So he had no power. He was merely constructed by the people around him.</p><p>But everything reversed the instant he was taken in by the Holy Grail.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;The Holy Grail grants wishes.</p><p>When defeated, Servants are reduced to raw magical energy and are taken in by the Holy Grail to await their release. They lose their individual personalities and stay in the Holy Grail as an omnipotent power.</p><p>But Angra Manyu was different. He was a heroic spirit that others wished for. He was intended to be evil, regardless of his personality.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;――――No way. Could he...&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes. The Holy Grail grants every wish.</p><p>He was a mere human, but wasn&#39;t treated as one. So he was an embodiment of people&#39;s wishes.</p><p>So―――the instant Angra Manyu was taken in by the Holy Grail, the Holy Grail accepted a wish.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;An existence that should not be.</p><p>The heroic spirit constructed from people&#39;s selfish wishes was finally given flesh within the wish-granting Holy Grail.</p><p>...Five hundred years under the Makiri and a thousand under the Einzbern are nothing.</p><p>After all, he&#39;s an ideal human that has been wished for since the age of gods, over two thousand years ago.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;That&#39;s what that shadow is. It finally obtained form as a heroic spirit.</p><p>Angra Manyu used Servants&#39; colorless magical energy to embody all evils of the world.</p><p>Wanting only to be evil.</p><p>It slowly matured with an ability to curse all six billion people.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;―――Then what? The contents of the Holy Grail have already been tainted by him? The wish the Holy Grail grants is already determined, and the fourth war took place only to store up the magical energy needed to give him form?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Yes. I don&#39;t know how much Kiritsugu knew about Angra Manyu.</p><p>But believing the shadow leaking from it to be dangerous, he destroyed the Holy Grail.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;And his course of action was right.</p><p>No matter what the previous Angra Manyu was, the Angra Manyu that formed inside the Holy Grail is real. It will become the greatest evil in the world, a devil that will kill every human being alive.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;But thanks to Kiritsugu&#39;s resolve, Angra Manyu was left unborn within the Great Holy Grail.</p><p>Kotomine and Sakura received parts of it.</p><p>Zouken must&#39;ve known that a Servant was about to be born in the Holy Grail.</p><p>That&#39;s why he implanted a piece of it in Sakura, creating a link between her and that Servant.</p><p>He made Sakura a Master so that she can control the Servant once it emerges.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;No matter what Avenger is, it&#39;s still a Servant. No Servant, no matter how strong, can disobey his Master.</p><p>That&#39;s Zouken&#39;s plan. He wants to use Sakura to obtain Angra Manyu.&quot;</p><hr><p>――――Hold on.</p><p>Does that mean Sakura has a contract with this Servant, Avenger?</p><hr><p>&quot;Are you serious? Even if Sakura controls Angra Manyu that way, she can&#39;t resist the taint of the magical energy.</p><p>She&#39;s already changed that much when Angra Manyu is still inside the Holy Grail, so her personality will disappear completely once it comes out. Then being a Master won&#39;t matter.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;That&#39;s fine. Zouken isn&#39;t worried about Sakura&#39;s personality. What matters to him is her body and its connection to Angra Manyu.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;He&#39;s planning to take over her empty body after her personality disappears.</p><p>...I don&#39;t think you know, but Zouken can take over anyone&#39;s body as long as the worm bearing his soul exists. That&#39;s how he stayed alive until now.</p><p>From the start, Sakura was just a body to eventually possess.&quot;</p><hr><p>――――Then what?</p><p>The thing possessing Sakura.</p><p>If what&#39;s changing her is a contract with a Servant――――</p><hr><p>&quot;Zouken kidnapped me, probably because he didn&#39;t want to let Sakura open the gate.</p><p>He wanted me to take the role of the Holy Grail, allowing him to take over Sakura&#39;s body once she became Angra Manyu&#39;s Master.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;I guess he plans to take over Angra Manyu in time, since a soul given flesh is a living example of the Third True magecraft. It&#39;s like speaking ill of a perfect God because you&#39;re a human with desires.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;......The definition of God&#39;s creation... It&#39;s something that&#39;s made from people&#39;s wishes, but not affected by people&#39;s intentions.</p><p>Well, I bet any god will turn into a devil if it reflects Zouken&#39;s personality. That must be why Kotomine considered him his enemy.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;I get it. That&#39;s enough, right, Shirou?&quot;</p><p>&quot;――――Huh?&quot;</p><p>Tohsaka&#39;s voice brings me back to the present.</p><hr><p>&quot;It&#39;s not &#39;huh&#39;. We know our enemy, and we know Zouken&#39;s intention. Then we don&#39;t even need to talk about the rest.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;――――――――&quot;</p><p>...We don&#39;t even need to talk about the rest, huh?</p><p>She&#39;s right.</p><p>What&#39;s in the Holy Grail.</p><p>The disaster from ten years ago will be repeated if he comes out.</p><hr><p>...No, that&#39;s an understatement.</p><p>He&#39;ll kill countless people if we let him be.</p><p>―――Yes.</p><p>Sakura&#39;s creation will take many lives.</p><hr><p>&quot;――――――――&quot;</p><p>I can&#39;t allow that.</p><p>Then I have to stop it.</p><p>I have to make whatever sacrifices I can to keep Sakura from being burdened with more deaths.</p><p>――――Stop Angra Manyu.</p><p>I have to end the war before he emerges from the Holy Grail.</p><hr><p>&quot;I guess you understand now. We have to fight and win.</p><p>And there are only two ways to do this.</p><p>Kill Sakura, Angra Manyu&#39;s Master, before he comes out. Or destroy the Great Holy Grail before he comes out.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...The former&#39;s the more certain method.</p><p>Sakura and Zouken will surely get in our way if we try to destroy the Great Holy Grail. We won&#39;t be able to do it without defeating them.</p><p>So it&#39;s easiest to defeat Sakura.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Yeah. Fight Sakura and separate her from Angra Manyu. That&#39;s the easiest way, and the plan&#39;s easy to understand.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh. You have no problem with going after her?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...That&#39;s the only thing we can manage right now. If Angra Manyu is what Illya says it is, it&#39;s not something humans can match. We lose the instant it comes out.</p><p>Then we have to take the quickest and surest route.</p><p>More importantly, Tohsaka. I don&#39;t mind fighting, but do you know where Sakura is?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;That&#39;s not a problem. If Illya&#39;s right, there&#39;s only one place the Great Holy Grail can be. Right, Illya?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...Yes, you&#39;re right, Rin.</p><p>Angra Manyu is about to be born, so Zouken is at the Great Holy Grail.</p><p>The degraded ley line. The origin that was chosen by the three families two hundred years ago. Angra Manyu is being conceived in the large cavern underneath the Ryuudou Temple.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;――――Under the Ryuudou Temple...&quot;</p><p>...That&#39;s where Sakura is.</p><p>That&#39;s where we&#39;ll be heading, the place where the Holy Grail War will end.</p><hr><p>&quot;.........&quot;</p><p>I take a deep breath and allow my tense mind to relax slightly.</p><p>The cold pendant in my hand settles my thoughts.</p><hr><p>&quot;――――――――&quot;</p><p>Fighting Sakura.</p><p>Tohsaka isn&#39;t lying.</p><p>It&#39;s just that our methods are different.</p><p>Tohsaka must intend to finish the war by killing Sakura.</p><p>But I&#39;ll end the war by saving Sakura&#39;s life―――</p><hr><p>&quot;.....!?&quot;</p><p>My body trembles.</p><p>The house is beset by pressure, making the air feel like water.</p><p>And...</p><p>&quot;Sakura――――!&quot;</p><p>The instant we realize the pressure&#39;s coming from the shadow, we run out into the yard.</p><hr><h2 id="scene-17-separation" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#scene-17-separation" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Scene 17 Separation</h2><p>――――We go out into the yard.</p><p>The whole world is covered by the shadow.</p><p>My entire body is numb with fear.</p><hr><p>...The black shadow is standing in front of us.</p><p>It can crush this house if it wants to.</p><p>The difference in our power is obvious.</p><p>It has transfigured to an existence that&#39;s unlike anything I&#39;ve ever seen.</p><hr><p>&quot;...............&quot;</p><p>...The black shadow does nothing.</p><p>It&#39;s not Sakura, but a shadow shaped like her.</p><p>The real Sakura is under the Ryuudou Temple.</p><p>The thing in front of us is a virtual image.</p><hr><p>&quot;――――Hmph. So you&#39;re sending the shadow instead of showing up yourself? You&#39;ve gotten arrogant during the short time you&#39;ve been away.&quot;</p><p>&quot;.........&quot;</p><p>Does she not hear Tohsaka&#39;s provocation, or does she not hear anything at all?</p><p>Wavering in the moonlight, her shadow looks lonely.</p><hr><p>&quot;.........&quot;</p><p>Her eyes look at me.</p><p>&#39;Senpai&#39;.</p><p>Weak, as if she&#39;ll reply like always if I just reach out.</p><hr><p>&quot;――――――――&quot;</p><p>But I don&#39;t.</p><p>What I must do is determined.</p><p>I can&#39;t say anything to her, as doing so would weaken my resolve.</p><hr><p>She looks away.</p><p>After hanging her head for a moment,</p><p>&quot;Did you hear the whole story from Illyasviel, Nee-san?&quot;</p><p>She confronts Tohsaka with a cold voice.</p><hr><p>&quot;Yeah. I heard about what&#39;s possessing you and the abilities of what&#39;s about to be born from the Holy Grail.</p><p>So, Sakura. Let me ask. Do you have any intention of cutting ties with Angra Manyu?&quot;</p><p>Tohsaka&#39;s voice is the same.</p><p>Completely cold, showing no concern for Sakura.</p><hr><p>&quot;No. I said the weak me disappeared, didn&#39;t I? I was able to obtain this power, so I don&#39;t intend to let it go. I couldn&#39;t even if I wanted to.</p><p>...This is how Matou Sakura has to live from now on.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;I see. Then one more thing.</p><p>How complete is the Servant you&#39;re boasting about? Illya said it&#39;s coming out soon, but what do you have to say as the mother? Is it already born?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...Of course not. When that happens, this town will be consumed in a second.</p><p>I can&#39;t allow that yet. Senpai&#39;s still here.</p><p>So I won&#39;t let him out as long as I still exist.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh, so there&#39;s no reason for us to hurry, huh? So you&#39;re going to keep Angra Manyu inside as long as Shirou&#39;s with me?</p><p>That&#39;s good, Shirou. Sakura seems well enough.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...Don&#39;t be ridiculous. You should know how much longer I&#39;m going to last.</p><p>Please run away with Senpai. I won&#39;t last long. I don&#39;t know when I&#39;ll disappear. I might only be able to hold out for one night.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;So I&#39;m warning you before that.</p><p>...Nee-san. Please take Senpai and run far away. Then I can be at peace and take his life with mine.&quot;</p><hr><p>Sakura says she&#39;s going to kill him using her life.</p><p>Tohsaka trembles a bit.</p><p>Is that because she believes her, or...</p><hr><p>&quot;...Humph. You don&#39;t know when you&#39;re going to disappear, huh?</p><p>You&#39;re wrong. You just don&#39;t know when you&#39;ll run out of patience.&quot;</p><p>&quot;――――Nee-san.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh well. I don&#39;t know how you&#39;re going to kill Angra Manyu, but you can kill yourself without hesitation if I run away with Shirou?</p><p>You&#39;ll kill the Servant within the Holy Grail along with you, right?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...Y-Yes. So please run away.</p><p>I-I don&#39;t want you to see me change. It&#39;s fine as long as Senpai gets away.</p><p>So――――please don&#39;t come after me anymore, Senpai.&quot;</p><hr><p>She&#39;s desperately begging us.</p><p>Sakura&#39;s shadow can kill us right now, but it asks for salvation by letting us go.</p><hr><p>&quot;――――――――&quot;</p><p>But I can&#39;t answer her wish.</p><p>I can&#39;t leave Sakura and run away, nor can I let her kill herself along with Angra Manyu.</p><p>And...</p><p>&quot;We&#39;ll go there. We&#39;ll go and kill you for sure.&quot;</p><p>Tohsaka breaks away from her sister.</p><hr><p>&quot;Wha―――――――&quot;</p><p>&quot;What did you expect? As Tohsaka&#39;s magus, I can&#39;t ignore you. And I can&#39;t believe you even if you say you&#39;ll kill yourself.</p><p>Don&#39;t you get it, Sakura? You&#39;re not making any sense. You want to kill, but you&#39;re telling me to run.</p><p>Geez, you&#39;re trying to act like a good girl because you&#39;re in front of Shirou.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...What?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh, you can make a good face. That&#39;s what you should&#39;ve done from the start.</p><p>So, is that all? Then get lost. You don&#39;t have to hurry since we&#39;ll go see you right away.</p><p>Look, Sakura. I&#39;ll kill you with my own hands.&quot;</p><hr><p>Tohsaka declares with voice that even contains kindness.</p><p>...The shadow wavers.</p><p>After freezing on the spot like a statue...</p><p>&quot;Yes――――I&#39;ll be waiting for you, Nee-san.&quot;</p><p>...It smiles violently and disappears.</p><hr><p>The shadow covering the house recedes.</p><p>Tohsaka and I are the only ones remaining in the yard.</p><hr><p>――――I get dizzy.</p><p>I thought I was concentrating, but it seems I was agitated after seeing Sakura&#39;s image.</p><p>...It seems Sakura&#39;s not the only one that&#39;s running out of time.</p><hr><p>&quot;――――Shirou.</p><p>You heard what Sakura said. But what&#39;re you going to do?</p><p>If you want to run, I won&#39;t stop you. But if you do, that&#39;ll be after you project the gem sword.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;You don&#39;t have to confirm with me. I won&#39;t run away, and I&#39;ll somehow project the gem sword.</p><p>We&#39;re cooperating, right? Then I&#39;ll follow up by doing things you can&#39;t do.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...I see. That&#39;s good, but do you understand, Shirou?</p><p>Coming with me means killing Sakura. The same goes for the gem sword. You&#39;re going to prepare a weapon that I will use to kill her.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...Yeah. The gem sword thing is contradictory. But Sakura&#39;s out of our control, and projecting the sword is a promise we made. If projecting the sword means we can match Sakura&#39;s shadow, then it&#39;s something we definitely need to do.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh. So...&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yeah, I&#39;m taking the opposite measure. I&#39;m going to end this war by saving Sakura. I&#39;ve decided to be Sakura&#39;s ally.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Even if letting Sakura live means killing everyone else?&quot;</p><p>&quot;We don&#39;t know that yet. There should be a way to save Sakura and not let there be any more victims.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...I don&#39;t know about that. Sakura&#39;s already killed many people. Is it justice for you to save such a person, Shirou?&quot;</p><p>――――Her inquiry is decisive.</p><p>A sin I can&#39;t talk myself out of.</p><p>She puts it into words, and I finally...</p><hr><p>&quot;―――That&#39;s right. I&#39;ll protect her even if she&#39;s not human. I&#39;m going to protect her from everything, including the part of her that wants to kill me.</p><p>That&#39;s all I want to do. That&#39;s what it means to be someone&#39;s ally, right?&quot;</p><p>...I&#39;m able to tell her what I think.</p><hr><p>&quot;......Geez. You really can just come out and say it.&quot;</p><p>I nod back, feeling no shame.</p><hr><p>&quot;......I see. Well, I knew there was no point in arguing with you, but I didn&#39;t think it&#39;d go this far. You beat me.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Huh? Where are you going, Tohsaka?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;I have to go prepare for the battle.</p><p>Sakura gave us that warning because she really doesn&#39;t have time to spare. So I have to get ready quickly.&quot;</p><p>&quot;That&#39;s true, but we were talking――――&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;We&#39;re done talking now. In short, you&#39;re going to save Sakura as long as you&#39;re still alive, right?</p><p>...Hmph. Fine, do as you want. I&#39;m not going to say anything now. Go struggle to your heart&#39;s content.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Hm...?&quot;</p><p>Where did her nervousness go? Tohsaka looks angry now.</p><hr><p>&quot;But don&#39;t get me wrong. This is in exchange for making the gem sword.</p><p>I&#39;ll leave you in charge of Sakura as long as you&#39;re trying. I won&#39;t do anything until you can&#39;t move anymore.</p><p>...That&#39;s good, right? You might be able to save Sakura, if you try hard enough.&quot;</p><hr><p>Tohsaka leaves with that.</p><p>&quot;.........&quot;</p><p>The uneasiness in my chest goes away.</p><p>We&#39;re thinking oppositely.</p><p>But Tohsaka still wants to save Sakura.</p><hr><p>Then I can entrust her with Sakura.</p><p>We both like her.</p><p>Then Tohsaka should be able to save Sakura.</p><hr><h2 id="scene-18-record-of-the-great-holy-grail" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#scene-18-record-of-the-great-holy-grail" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Scene 18 Record of the Great Holy Grail</h2><p>It&#39;s ten o&#39;clock.</p><p>Tohsaka said we&#39;ll prepare for battle and go to the Ryuudou Temple before the date changes.</p><hr><p>&quot;Well. I&#39;m going to have you project the gem sword, but how do you feel? Can you project it while suppressing Archer&#39;s arm?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh――――&quot;</p><p>...I see.</p><p>Illya hasn&#39;t told her how I took the Shroud off.</p><p>&quot;Well――――um, yeah...&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh, that&#39;s good to hear. Then the rest is up to Shirou and Illya.</p><p>The Azoth Sword, which is as close as we&#39;re going to get to the gem sword, Shirou&#39;s projection, and Illya&#39;s support. We may not be able to replicate it, but if all goes well, we should at least be able to reproduce half of its original ability.&quot;</p><p>Tohsaka hands me a dagger.</p><hr><p>&quot;.........&quot;</p><p>The dagger is a ritualistic equipment.</p><p>It might be something she favors, as it looks well-used.</p><p>Not only that. Even an amateur like me can feel how much magical energy is stored in this thing.</p><hr><p>...Well, this is nothing compared to the shadow, but it&#39;s still a hundred times more than my magical energy capacity.</p><hr><p>&quot;...This is amazing. You had something like this up your sleeve?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Of course it&#39;s amazing. I used all the jewels I had, which contained ten years worth of magical energy.&quot;</p><hr><p>Tohsaka sulks, like she didn&#39;t want to use them.</p><p>...She seems generous, but maybe she&#39;s really stingy when it comes to money.</p><p>Well, with that aside...</p><hr><p>&quot;Hmm, but is that really okay, Tohsaka? You don&#39;t have any left for yourself if you&#39;ve used everything you have, right? I know you&#39;re still not fully recovered, so can you still fight?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Well, I can manage to move around. But I haven&#39;t healed to the point where I can use magecraft again.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Wait――――then...&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;You don&#39;t need to worry. It&#39;s fine as long as you can project the gem sword. The sword has absurd powers said to have even stopped the &#39;falling moon&#39;.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...?&quot;</p><p>I don&#39;t get what she means, but Tohsaka has great confidence.</p><p>...Well, if she&#39;s so sure of herself, I won&#39;t worry either.</p><hr><p>&quot;Let&#39;s start, Shirou. It&#39;ll take a long time to project that sword, even for you. We have to get started or the date&#39;ll change.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;You&#39;re right. Then let&#39;s go back to your room. If we&#39;re not someplace where you can relax, our chances are lower.&quot;</p><p>Tohsaka heads back to the living room.</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh, hold on. I&#39;ll do the projection in the shed.</p><p>And I want to be alone with Illya while I do it, so can you wait in your room?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Why? I have to be there in case something happens, right?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;There&#39;s no need. It&#39;s a bother if you&#39;re here.</p><p>Shirou gets distracted easily, so we might fail if you fall and get his attention when it counts the most.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...Hey, that&#39;s rude, Illya.&quot;</p><p>Tohsaka complains with a sour look.</p><p>She&#39;s not arguing back, maybe because she can&#39;t deny the possibility that she&#39;ll screw up at a crucial moment.</p><hr><p>&quot;...All right. Then I&#39;ll wait outside the shed. Is that all right, Illya?&quot;</p><p>&quot;...I guess it can&#39;t be helped. That&#39;s the biggest compromise we can make.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Rin. Don&#39;t come in until I tell you to if you want us to reproduce the gem sword. I&#39;ll call for you if something&#39;s about to happen, so please stay outside until then no matter what.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;You&#39;re being persistent. I said I understand. I won&#39;t come in even if I hear Shirou scream.&quot;</p><p>&quot;.........&quot;</p><p>It doesn&#39;t really matter, but I wish she&#39;d picked a better example.</p><hr><p>&quot;Well, let&#39;s go, Shirou.&quot;</p><p>Illya goes into the shed.</p><p>I decide to ask Tohsaka something before I follow.</p><hr><p>&quot;Tohsaka. Can I have this sword?&quot;</p><p>&quot;...? You&#39;re going to be projecting using that. The Azoth Sword will go away once the gem sword&#39;s projected.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Yeah. You can have the gem sword, so can I have this in return?</p><p>See, this might break if I fail. I can&#39;t concentrate, thinking how you might get angry if I break this.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...Geez. Fine. You can have the Azoth Sword if that&#39;ll help you relax.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Thanks. Then I&#39;m going to go do my best.&quot;</p><hr><p>...I shut the door.</p><p>I can&#39;t let Tohsaka see this.</p><p>I&#39;m sure she won&#39;t stop me now, but she&#39;ll definitely feel responsible.</p><p>If I&#39;m to smooth this out, I have to tell her I used it after everything is over and get retroactive approval.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Are you ready, Shirou? You&#39;ve released Archer&#39;s arm already, so I don&#39;t need to explain the steps, right?&quot;</p><p>I nod.</p><p>Illya tells me to sit down, and I do so.</p><hr><p>&quot;But Illya. I can only project what I&#39;ve seen or what Archer made. I have no information on the gem sword. I can&#39;t project it even if we have a blueprint and a dagger that&#39;s just like it.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;I know. I&#39;ll first have you come inside my memory. I haven&#39;t seen it either, but the record of the gem sword is in me.</p><p>Tohsaka&#39;s great master was there when the Great Holy Grail was made.</p><p>I&#39;m sure the sword was there at that time.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Whoa, Illya――――&quot;</p><p>&quot;Just close your eyes. I&#39;ll keep your body here and send your mind somewhere else. We did this before. I&#39;ll send your vision into my memory, so analyze the gem sword there.</p><p>...I&#39;ll release your left arm once you&#39;re inside. You&#39;ll be hit by the pressure of two hundred years and the invasion from your arm at the same time. Brace yourself and try to finish the projection as fast as you can.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;――――――――&quot;</p><p>Illya&#39;s voice is trembling.</p><p>...Her arms are as well.</p><hr><p>&quot;...I&#39;ll take you to the gem sword, so you just need to hold your breath. Clear your mind and don&#39;t look at anything unnecessary. You just need to draw out his Zelretch――――&quot;</p><hr><p>――――Space splits.</p><p>Is it because all my senses are within her memory...</p><p>or is it because my left arm is released?</p><hr><p>There&#39;s no pain, the cognition of pain doesn&#39;t matter now, I&#39;m swallowed by my injury, I&#39;m falling into a swirling maelstrom of pain.</p><hr><p>I don&#39;t know where I am.</p><hr><p>I don&#39;t know who I am.</p><hr><p>I don&#39;t know what it means.</p><hr><p>It&#39;s a large circuit.</p><p>Multi-layered Crests are carved on a bare rock that&#39;s over fifty meters in radius.</p><p>It&#39;s like a large observatory, rotating by itself in the deserts of Arizona.</p><hr><p>The circuits cover the area in many layers.</p><p>The geometric figures turn in place.</p><p>A white girl stands in the center of the beautiful spider&#39;s nest.</p><hr><p>Her name is Lizleihi.</p><p>Lizleihi Justizia von Einzbern.</p><p>She&#39;s the magus that devised the Holy Grail War.</p><p>The great magus who was called the winter saint. A magus accompanied by Makiri Zouken and Tohsaka Nagato.</p><hr><p>The Great Holy Grail is activated.</p><p>Justizia becomes the key reenacting the ancient True magecraft.</p><p>Yes. The Holy Grail is just a Holy Grail without her.</p><p>Her will is needed for Heavens Feel.</p><p>The old man knows as well as Makiri and Tohsaka do that the Holy Grail is a mere wishbringer.</p><hr><p>――――My vision narrows.</p><p>The world expands.</p><p>I concentrated on something needless. I did, so my body was ripped in half.</p><hr><p>The world is too big for this small body.</p><p>I&#39;ll eventually see nothing.</p><p>The process behind this two-hundred-year-old ritual doesn&#39;t matter.</p><p>There&#39;s only one thing I need to look at.</p><p>I concentrate on the man standing in front of the Great Holy Grail. I concentrate on the dagger in his hand――――</p><hr><p>――――That&#39;s the original.</p><p>A ritual dagger with a jeweled blade.</p><p>The kaleidoscopic gleam sears through my eyes and into my brain.</p><hr><p>&quot;――――――――, ――――――――&quot;</p><hr><p>I understand the instant I see it.</p><p>I understand that I can&#39;t comprehend it.</p><p>All I can imitate is its shape.</p><p>I can&#39;t analyze its structure and project it.</p><hr><p>What kind of a magical theory was it constructed with?</p><p>The old man&#39;s dagger is still a mystery, even if I use Archer&#39;s arm and every last piece of knowledge in heroic spirit Emiya.</p><p>It&#39;s alien technology.</p><p>The old man is embodying general knowledge from a far future, beyond the reach of modern man――――</p><hr><p>&quot;――――. ――――......!!&quot;</p><hr><p>I&#39;m repelled.</p><p>I can&#39;t be repelled.</p><p>I can&#39;t reach it.</p><p>Not reaching it is unforgivable.</p><hr><p>I reach out.</p><p>I reach out.</p><p>I reach out.</p><p>My eyes are burned out, my brains are burned out.</p><p>I extend my left arm for dozens of meters, extend, extend, extend――――――――</p><hr><p>&quot;Stop! Come back, Shirou...!&quot;</p><hr><p>I hear Illya&#39;s voice.</p><p>But I&#39;m not there yet.</p><p>I don&#39;t even have my fingertips on it.</p><p>I can&#39;t back out now.</p><p>How can I back out after seeing that miracle, the ultimate one...!?</p><hr><p>&quot;Give up...! Do you want to disappear, Shirou!?&quot;</p><hr><p>Get there――――</p><hr><p>Get there―――――――――</p><hr><p>Get there――――――――――――</p><hr><p>Get there―――――――――――――</p><p>―――――――――――――――――――――――</p><p>――――――――――――――――――――――</p><hr><p>&quot;Haa, ah.......!!!!!!!!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Shirou――――!&quot;</p><p>Did I jump myself, or was I pushed back by something?</p><p>I&#39;m flying, and I land on my back.</p><hr><p>&quot;Ha――――ga, ah――――!&quot;</p><p>My left arm pain .</p><p>My tongue my fingers the trembling won&#39;t .</p><p>&quot;Ah――――uwa, ah, ah――――!&quot;</p><p>.</p><p>, .</p><hr><p>&quot;Stay ! I&#39;ll Shroud !&quot;</p><p>&quot;Haa, guh, ah..........!&quot;</p><p>A big knife stabs me from the side.</p><p>It&#39;s so uncomfortable that I repel the one wielding it――――</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh... Ouch――――&quot;</p><p>And I realize I just punched Illya.</p><p>&quot;......! I-I&#39;m sorry, Illya, I――――&quot;</p><p>She pats dust off herself and gets up.</p><p>...Good. She&#39;s not hurt.</p><hr><p>&quot;I told you not to look at unnecessary things, you idiot!</p><p>...Geez, I&#39;ll let you off the hook this time since it paid off, but I won&#39;t forgive you if you disobey me again!&quot;</p><hr><p>She points at my face as she scolds me.</p><p>...Wait.</p><p>Feeling something hard in my left hand, I look down.</p><hr><p>&quot;――――――――&quot;</p><p>......I managed to project it.</p><p>It&#39;s projected, but it doesn&#39;t seem like the one I saw.</p><p>First of all, I don&#39;t feel any magical energy in this thing.</p><p>Tohsaka&#39;s Azoth Sword is many times better than this, and this blade wouldn&#39;t cut paper.</p><hr><p>&quot;Yup. I have a lot to complain about, but thanks for your hard work, Shirou. Your projection was perfect. You showed me a flawless blade works.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Uh――――I don&#39;t know, but is this any good? It looks pretty crappy.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;That&#39;s fine as is. The sword is an extraordinary demonic sword that can only be used by Schweinorg&#39;s lineage.</p><p>Well, I guess it&#39;s fate. Sakura is receiving the protection of the third and Rin&#39;s going to try to use the second. It wouldn&#39;t end up as mere investigation if the Association were here. Every department would be running to put them on trial.&quot;</p><p>Illya laughs.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Wow. So this dagger is that amazing?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yeah. To be more accurate, it&#39;s a multi-dimensional refractory phenomenon, Gem Sword Kishua Zelretch Schweinorg.</p><p>It&#39;s called Gem Sword Zelretch, and it&#39;s the old magus&#39;s favored sword and Tohsaka&#39;s heirloom.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;But the sword wasn&#39;t passed down the Tohsaka line, just the blueprint.</p><p>It&#39;s an assignment from the sorcerer that the Tohsaka magi must pursue for a long, long time.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Assignment from a sorcerer... Wait, the great master Tohsaka was talking about is a sorcerer...!?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Yeah. But Zelretch is an oddball among the sorcerers in that he still associates himself with this world, so I&#39;m sure he has other apprentices.</p><p>I don&#39;t think Zelretch is in this world, but he might show up once Rin&#39;s capable of making the gem sword by herself.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Hmm......?&quot;</p><p>He&#39;s not in this world, but might appear all of a sudden? Isn&#39;t he just a wanderer that likes to travel?</p><hr><p>&quot;――――――――&quot;</p><p>――――Whoa.</p><p>I let my guard down.</p><p>I get dizzy.</p><p>I clench my right fist, feel the pendant digging into my torn flesh, and keep my consciousness.</p><hr><p>&quot;――――, ――――&quot;</p><p>I steady my breathing so Illya doesn&#39;t notice.</p><p>My limbs――――I still feel my limbs.</p><hr><p>&quot;――――――――&quot;</p><p>......Good.</p><p>I thought I&#39;d lose something if I used projection, but I&#39;m not missing anything yet.</p><p>My head&#39;s still working.</p><p>The biggest proof is that I can check on my condition.</p><p>I should be able to use one more projection.</p><hr><p>―――No, I have to use it.</p><p>I have to save Sakura in a way different from Tohsaka.</p><p>Archer&#39;s arm will make it poss-</p><hr><p>&quot;So means. In short, the True magecraft parallel worlds. So his nickname Kaleidoscope &quot;</p><p>&quot;――――Tohsaka?&quot;</p><p>&quot; ? , ?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;――――――――&quot;</p><p>I can&#39;t understand her.</p><p>It&#39;s not that I can&#39;t hear her. She&#39;s just speaking in a language I don&#39;t understand.</p><p>She&#39;s talking in some strange language and holding something dangerous in her left hand.</p><hr><p>...Tohsaka&#39;s holding a sword I&#39;ve never seen before.</p><p>Never seen before?</p><p>That can&#39;t be.</p><p>I projected (I think) that sword just now, and my left hand is empty, so it must mean I handed it to Tohsaka.</p><hr><p>&quot;Shirou? from .</p><p>Was the projection ?&quot;</p><p>&quot;――――――――&quot;</p><hr><p>I get a chill.</p><p>My memory&#39;s vague.</p><p>I can&#39;t recall anything.</p><p>My understanding and the details don&#39;t match up.</p><hr><p>&quot;Guh――――, ..........!&quot;</p><p>I clench my right hand.</p><p>My eyes finally focus in exchange for dripping blood.</p><hr><p>&quot;――――Um, Tohsaka.&quot;</p><p>I get up.</p><p>My limbs are light compared to my disconnected head.</p><p>They&#39;re so light that I think they may be empty inside.</p><hr><p>&quot;It&#39;s not &#39;Tohsaka&#39;. Illya and I will go test it out, so you should rest―――wait, what&#39;s with your hand...!&quot;</p><hr><p>Tohsaka grabs me.</p><p>Her speed is surprisingly slow, but...</p><p>&quot;Eh......? Why do you have this...?&quot;</p><p>My mind isn&#39;t working, and she has ahold of my hand before I know it.</p><hr><p>Tohsaka&#39;s looking at the pendant in my palm with astonishment.</p><p>I don&#39;t know why she&#39;s surprised.</p><p>But I have this because...</p><hr><p>&quot;Shirou. Why do you have this? And are you crazy, holding it this tight?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Why? I just have it as a charm. This is...&quot;</p><hr><p>...Something I picked up.</p><p>Why did I pick it up?</p><p>It&#39;s something I shouldn&#39;t forget, but I can&#39;t remember.</p><p>But the stranger in my left arm knows what it is better than I do.</p><hr><p>&quot;......Um, it&#39;s something important. I have to have it on me until the end.&quot;</p><hr><p>Words that are not mine come out of my mouth.</p><p>&quot;.........</p><p>Shirou. I also have that pendant.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Eh?&quot;</p><p>Tohsaka takes out a pendant from her pocket.</p><p>It&#39;s certainly the same.</p><p>It&#39;s a simple design for a jewel user like Tohsaka, but I think something simple like this brings out her beauty.</p><hr><p>&quot;Wow, they&#39;re the same.&quot;</p><p>I nod back.</p><hr><p>&quot;No. Mine&#39;s empty, but there&#39;s still a bit left in yours. It&#39;s not significant, but I&#39;m sure there&#39;s a meaning behind the usage of it.&quot;</p><p>&quot;...?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Keep that. It might come in handy.&quot;</p><p>Tohsaka puts her pendant away and walks off with Illya.</p><hr><p>&quot;Hey, Tohsaka. Where are you going?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I need to talk to Illya. I&#39;ll let you rest for an hour, so stay in your room.</p><p>And I&#39;ll get seriously mad if you don&#39;t treat your hand right away.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;――――――――&quot;</p><p>Tohsaka&#39;s bad temper borders on outright hostility.</p><p>She takes Illya, who follows her without a word.</p><hr><h2 id="scene-19-confrontation-with-rider" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#scene-19-confrontation-with-rider" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Scene 19 Confrontation with Rider</h2><p>&quot;.........Oh well.

The only other thing I&#39;m taking is the pendant.</p><hr><p>&quot;Shirou, Rin&#39;s calling for you. She&#39;s waiting outside, so she wants to meet up there as soon as you&#39;re ready.&quot;</p><p>Illya&#39;s going to stay here.</p><p>It&#39;s partly because Zouken&#39;s after her, but I&#39;m also having her stay here because she&#39;s my hope.</p><hr><p>&quot;I see. So she&#39;s out there, huh?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yeah. She looked like she wanted you to come quickly, so she&#39;ll probably scold you again if you don&#39;t hurry.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;――――――――&quot;</p><p>I nod and get up.</p><p>There&#39;s no pain in my left arm now.</p><p>It&#39;s just that my human functionality is eroding.</p><hr><p>I can&#39;t tell what I&#39;m doing if I stand still.</p><p>&quot;Then I&#39;m going. Be careful, Illya.&quot;</p><p>&quot;See you, Shirou. Please come home with Sakura and Rin before the day breaks.&quot;</p><p>I wave goodbye to her and leave.</p><hr><p>―――The air&#39;s rumbling.</p><p>Pressure that crushes the spirit of anyone who comes here.</p><p>Wind must be blowing far above me.</p><p>If I strain my ears, I can hear it howling.</p><hr><p>&quot;............&quot;</p><p>...I know this atmosphere.</p><p>It&#39;s the reenactment of the event ten years ago.</p><p>The air is thick with curses. Even people who are not magi should feel the ominous air of this place.</p><hr><p>&quot;This feeling... Is Sakura at the Ryuudou Temple?&quot;</p><p>&quot;No, we have no business at the Ryuudou Temple. The gate above must be the ostensible gate for the Masters that want the Holy Grail.</p><p>...If we want the Great Holy Grail, we have to go down instead of up.&quot;</p><hr><p>...The forest&#39;s dark.</p><p>We climb the mountain using the moonlight that filters through the clouds.</p><hr><p>We push our way through the tree branches.</p><p>There&#39;s not even an animal trail in this place, so we even have to climb down rock walls.</p><hr><p>&quot;Hm―――it should be around here, according to Illya... Do you see anything like an entrance, Shirou?&quot;</p><p>&quot;What do you mean, &#39;like&#39;?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Like a crack in a rock that we can slip through, or a suspicious-looking shrine. It&#39;s an entrance, so I don&#39;t think it&#39;d just be a pit.&quot;</p><p>&quot;...Don&#39;t be ridiculous. The stars are out, but I can&#39;t see anything in a forest at night――――&quot;</p><hr><p>...Oh, I can.</p><p>We must be behind the temple, because I see many dead trees.</p><p>There&#39;s no sign of human influence. There&#39;s nothing here but dead trees and a small stream.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Small stream?&quot;</p><p>Hold on.</p><p>That means the water&#39;s coming from somewhere.</p><hr><p>&quot;Stop. ...Wait a second. I&#39;ll take a better look.&quot;</p><p>Following the sound of water, I figure out which direction to search.</p><p>...The stream isn&#39;t coming from the mountaintop, but from a rocky outcropping.</p><hr><p>I can&#39;t see all that well in the darkness, but the rocks are large.</p><p>The formation looks like a natural gate, and the water&#39;s coming from behind them...</p><hr><p>&quot;...It looks like a cave. ...It might be a dead end, but...&quot;</p><p>&quot;What? Did you find something?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yeah, let&#39;s go check. It&#39;s this way, Tohsaka. Watch your footing.&quot;</p><hr><p>We pick our way down to the stream.</p><p>...It&#39;s more like a spring flowing out from the rocks.</p><hr><p>The stones are piled atop one another where it starts. There&#39;s a crack big enough for one person to fit through.</p><p>It&#39;s like a snow hut made from rocks.</p><p>You can see that a huge boulder is blocking the entrance, so nobody would even try to go in it.</p><hr><p>&quot;It&#39;s a small cave... But it&#39;s a dead end. The water seems to be coming from the rocks.&quot;</p><p>&quot;No, this is the place, Shirou. Try touching the rock in the back. Your hand will go right through it.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Eh......?&quot;</p><p>I try placing my hand on the rock.</p><p>&quot;Oh.&quot;</p><p>I don&#39;t feel the rock, and my hand goes through the space instead.</p><hr><p>&quot;Wow. Is this some kind of illusion?&quot;</p><p>&quot;It&#39;s a kind of a boundary field. ―――Let&#39;s go.&quot;</p><p>Tohsaka goes into the darkness without turning back.</p><hr><p>&quot;―――――&quot;</p><p>Once we go into the enemy&#39;s lair, there&#39;s no backing out.</p><p>I take a deep breath and follow after her.</p><hr><p>The sound of scraping on a hard surface.</p><p>I progress down the wet rocks using my hands.</p><p>The ground slopes steeply downward.</p><hr><p>...The weight of the darkness is stifling.</p><p>Unless I keep my back to the ground as I move, I might fall into the endless dark.</p><hr><p>&quot;.........&quot;</p><p>I lay flat on my back as I slowly descend.</p><p>......It&#39;s dark, and I can&#39;t tell how far down this path goes.</p><p>My breathing echoes in my ears.</p><hr><p>&quot;Shirou. I&#39;m going to ask you now.&quot;</p><p>...Then.</p><p>Tohsaka, the one leading the way, suddenly speaks up.</p><hr><p>&quot;What?&quot;</p><p>&quot;The gem sword. Why did you make it for me?&quot;</p><p>She sounds blunt, as if she&#39;s just asking to kill time while we&#39;re descending.</p><hr><p>&quot;Why ask?&quot;</p><p>&quot;―――I&#39;ve told you I&#39;m planning to kill Sakura.</p><p>Can you really give me a weapon, knowing that?&quot;</p><p>&quot;―――――――&quot;</p><p>I nod in agreement.</p><p>Well, Tohsaka certainly has a point.</p><hr><p>&quot;I&#39;m not okay with that. But I can&#39;t save Sakura without you. It&#39;s better to have two people instead of one.</p><p>And projecting the sword was a promise.</p><p>I couldn&#39;t keep one of my promises with you, so I wanted to keep the other.&quot;</p><hr><p>It happened a long time ago.</p><p>I asked for Tohsaka&#39;s help after I lost Saber.</p><p>Tohsaka responded to my call for help, and I made a promise with her.</p><hr><p>To let her win.</p><p>I promised to make her the victor.</p><hr><p>...I can&#39;t keep that promise anymore.</p><p>So I have to keep the other promise with her.</p><p>For the girl I used to admire...</p><p>For Tohsaka Rin, who believed in someone who had nothing at the time.</p><hr><p>&quot;I see. You&#39;re pretty faithful.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yeah, but not as much as you.&quot;</p><p>Silence returns to the darkness.</p><p>The conversation ends.</p><p>We continue our descent without looking at each other.</p><hr><p>A long path that seems to lead to hell.</p><p>The path spirals downward, and just as I&#39;m thinking we&#39;re over a hundred meters underground...</p><p>The dark cave changes completely, accepting us.</p><hr><p>The path that could only accomodate one person widens up and leads on.</p><p>There&#39;s no need for light.</p><p>The cave is illuminated by a dim green glow, probably from some kind of luminous moss.</p><hr><p>The path is saturated with life force.</p><p>It feels too lively.</p><p>An air of birth, filled with vigor and the joy of life.</p><p>An immense amount of odo, and magical energy so strong that it&#39;s almost visible.</p><hr><p>&quot;――――――――&quot;</p><p>It makes me want to vomit.</p><p>The warmth of life should be dazzling, but instead it&#39;s something rotten, making me want to look away.</p><hr><p>&quot;............&quot;</p><p>&quot;――――――――&quot;</p><p>I have no words to say to her.</p><p>This is a land of death.</p><p>Talking to each other to soften the tension would only cost us our lives.</p><hr><p>&quot;―――Let&#39;s go. From now on, look out for your own safety first.&quot;</p><p>...Tohsaka heads down the path, to the source of the black air.</p><hr><p>&quot;......?&quot;</p><p>I see something red on the ground.</p><p>It&#39;s a trace of blood.</p><p>The blood is leading to the back.</p><hr><p>&quot;――――――――&quot;</p><p>Did someone come here before us?</p><p>And someone wounded badly enough to leave behind a trail of blood?</p><hr><p>&quot;Shirou.&quot;</p><p>&quot;...Sorry. I&#39;ll be right there.&quot;</p><p>I shake off that train of thought and head on.</p><p>I can&#39;t be worrying about others.</p><hr><p>&quot;―――――――!&quot;</p><p>My consciousness fades away if I let my guard down.</p><p>I&#39;ll disappear if I worry about needless things.</p><p>&quot;.........&quot;</p><p>I tighten my grip on the pendant.</p><p>Letting the pain clear my head, I step into the green darkness.</p><hr><p>―――A warm wind hits my cheeks.</p><hr><p>At its end, the path opens into a cavern.</p><p>It&#39;s about as big as the schoolground.</p><p>It&#39;s too dark to make out the ceiling, but it must be about ten meters up.</p><hr><p>I don&#39;t detect any signs of life.</p><p>An unforgettable underground space that looks like the moonscape that I read about a long time ago.</p><p>And there...</p><p>Waits Saber, filled with absolute hostility.</p><hr><p>She&#39;s the only one here.</p><p>I don&#39;t see Sakura, Zouken, or Assassin.</p><p>The only one blocking the way here is the girl who has turned black.</p><hr><p>&quot;――――――Saber.&quot;</p><p>&quot;――――――――――&quot;</p><p>There&#39;s no reply.</p><hr><p>...Of course.</p><p>Saber&#39;s duty is to eliminate any intruders.</p><p>She&#39;s the gatekeeper and the executioner.</p><p>Saber&#39;s the strongest Servant Sakura has, so she can fight us by herself.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Hmph. It doesn&#39;t look like we can talk her into letting us through.&quot;</p><p>Tohsaka lowers her stance and reaches for the gem sword she&#39;s hiding behind her back.</p><hr><p>―――She must intend to fight her head-on.</p><p>I don&#39;t know what kind of ability the sword has, but she&#39;s going to fight Saber.</p><hr><p>But that&#39;s not a good idea.</p><p>We still have a countermeasure, since we know Saber&#39;s powers. We can&#39;t use our only secret weapon when Zouken and Assassin are still waiting for us――――</p><hr><p>&quot;Wait, Tohsaka...! Saber&#39;s――――&quot;</p><p>&quot;Rin. I have no reason to fight you. Please do not attack me. I will go against Sakura&#39;s orders if I kill you here.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;......!&quot;</p><p>Speaking in the same quiet tones as before, Saber stops Tohsaka in her tracks.</p><p>We comprehend what she means right away.</p><hr><p>&quot;...What are you doing? You&#39;re keeping watch here, right?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes. I am to eliminate anyone that passes by here.</p><p>That is Sakura&#39;s order. But―――&quot;</p><p>&quot;I&#39;m an exception. Sakura wants to see me, huh?&quot;</p><p>Saber nods.</p><hr><p>&quot;......I see. She must be serious.&quot;</p><p>She mutters.</p><p>...After taking a deep breath, Tohsaka walks over to Saber.</p><hr><p>&quot;Tohsaka.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Sorry. I guess that&#39;s how it is, so I&#39;m going ahead.&quot;</p><p>Tohsaka walks on without hesitation and passes by Saber.</p><p>And right before she disappears...</p><hr><p>&quot;Shirou. I don&#39;t know what&#39;ll happen to you, but I believe in you. So you&#39;d better live up to my expectations.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Huh?&quot;</p><p>...Wait.</p><p>I can&#39;t understand if you complain to me without telling me what I should be doing.</p><hr><p>&quot;I-I&#39;m saying it&#39;ll just be a pain if you come complaining after everything&#39;s over! ...Um, make sure you&#39;re not too late if you want to save Sakura.&quot;</p><p>Tohsaka disappears, her hair fluttering behind her.</p><hr><p>&quot;――――――――&quot;</p><p>...Thanks, Tohsaka.</p><p>That gave me strength.</p><p>In short, she told me to come help her while she keeps Sakura at bay.</p><hr><p>&quot;That is impossible. You will die here, Shirou.&quot;</p><p>&quot;......!&quot;</p><hr><p>Her hostility expands.</p><p>Tohsaka left, leaving me alone.</p><p>So she doesn&#39;t have to hold back anymore, huh?</p><hr><p>&quot;...Oh. Isn&#39;t your job to kill anyone that goes on from here? But I haven&#39;t even taken a step forward.&quot;</p><p>&quot;―――It is only a matter of time. You would never simply turn and leave.&quot;</p><hr><p>Saber&#39;s right.</p><p>Retreat isn&#39;t an option. I have to keep going forward, even if she&#39;s in my way.</p><hr><p>&quot;―――Heh. That&#39;s right. You sure know me well.</p><p>I was always troubling you because I wouldn&#39;t listen. I guess you still remember I&#39;m stupid.&quot;</p><hr><p>I move my dry tongue.</p><p>I don&#39;t feel alive at all.</p><p>I couldn&#39;t even hit Saber once when we sparred in the dojo, and she wasn&#39;t even using a tenth of her powers.</p><p>There&#39;s no way I can beat her.</p><p>My neck will be cut the instant I cross blades with her.</p><hr><p>So I have find an opening.</p><p>If there&#39;s no opening, I&#39;ll make one.</p><p>I have to get her attention, even if it means talking with her or appealing to compassion.</p><hr><p>...The start of the battle isn&#39;t when the blades first meet.</p><p>I have to use everything I can to find a way to beat her.</p><hr><p>&quot;You talk too much, Shirou. Do you crave death so badly?&quot;</p><p>&quot;That&#39;s scary, Saber. ...But you have your sword sheathed. You&#39;re saying you&#39;ll kill me, but you still haven&#39;t tried to attack.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...That is the rule. I shall spare you until you step forward.</p><p>But that will not last. You need to go to Sakura. I do not need to move, as you will come to me once you lose patience.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;――――!&quot;</p><p>I&#39;ve failed already.</p><p>Saber has no openings for me to exploit.</p><p>She&#39;s content to stand still and wait for me to act.</p><hr><p>&quot;......Damn. I guess I have to fight you head-on.&quot;</p><p>I breathe out the air in my lungs.</p><p>There&#39;s only one possible way out of this.</p><p>Archer&#39;s arm.</p><p>I have to use projection to defeat Saber, just like when I fought Berserker.</p><hr><p>...But...</p><p>I already know I can&#39;t beat her that way.</p><hr><p>&quot;Haa―――――&quot;</p><p>My mind is .</p><p>cut limbs protect the senses from the headwind―――!</p><hr><p>&quot;―――Trace, on.&quot;</p><p>I create the weapon.</p><p>The swords that have the least burden on me out of all the projections.</p><p>The symbol that Archer wielded for all his life: twin steel blades.</p><hr><p>Yang-sword Kanshou, yin-sword Bakuya.</p><p>They don&#39;t have any special abilities, but they&#39;re strong swords.</p><p>They won&#39;t shatter from one or two blows, even against Saber.</p><hr><p>&quot;―――Archer&#39;s swords. You choose not to imitate my own, Shirou?&quot;</p><p>&quot;――――――――&quot;</p><p>...With an effort, I gather together the shards of my consciousness.</p><p>...What did Saber just say?</p><p>Did she ask me why I won&#39;t project her sword?</p><hr><p>...I can&#39;t waste my energy like that.</p><p>...It takes too long to project such a powerful Noble Phantasm, and I can&#39;t handle that holy blade in any case.</p><p>I should be able to imitate it if my enemy&#39;s not moving, but I won&#39;t have time to use the sword&#39;s true name against her.</p><hr><p>&quot;...No, that does not concern me. The only thing that matters is that you armed yourself.</p><p>Insignificant though it may be, I will regard it as a hostile action.&quot;</p><hr><p>Saber&#39;s body wavers.</p><p>She holds the black holy sword.</p><p>&quot;Come. A body such as yours will last only a few minutes.&quot;</p><p>She offers my dying body a quiet invitation.</p><p>―――I take a step forward.</p><p>My first move, predicting Saber&#39;s counterattack, how to avoid it... I throw everything away and kick the ground.</p><p>I swing the yang-sword Kanshou.</p><p>In a heartbeat, I close the ten meters between us, concentrate everything I have in my left arm, and swing down with all my might.</p><hr><p>―――My attack&#39;s parried.</p><p>Ignoring it, I swing the yin-sword Bakuya.</p><p>But it does no good.</p><p>Saber wards off my attacks harmlessly, and her invisible sword lunges to pierce my throat――――!</p><hr><p>&quot;......!?&quot;</p><p>Which one of us is surprised?</p><p>―――I don&#39;t care.</p><p>What kind of miracle is it that&#39;s executing the attacks Emiya Shirou cannot execute and blocking the attacks Emiya Shirou cannot block?</p><p>―――I don&#39;t care.</p><p>What&#39;s the flashing light, the force that renews itself every second?</p><p>―――I really don&#39;t care about it.</p><hr><p>―――It&#39;s an overdrive that leads to death, as well as a calm sleep.</p><p>My body moves like a superhuman.</p><p>My blades move like lightning.</p><p>My mind reads ten steps ahead, ensuring five more seconds of survival for each attack I parry.</p><hr><p>&quot;Haa――――&quot;</p><p>I can only manage to defend.</p><p>The only attack allowed for me was the first; the rest of the time is spent fending off her attacks.</p><p>I&#39;ve already blocked thirty attacks that could&#39;ve killed me.</p><hr><p>&quot;Haa――――ah, guh――――&quot;</p><p>Time stops.</p><p>My body can&#39;t keep up with my mind.</p><p>My limbs can&#39;t keep up with the extracted experience.</p><p>―――This is why I chose Kanshou and Bakuya.</p><p>I didn&#39;t only project the weapon.</p><p>I reproduced Archer&#39;s battle experience along with the swords.</p><p>It&#39;s not perfect, but my abilities are now close to his.</p><hr><p>&quot;Haa, haa――――haa――――&quot;</p><p>That&#39;s why I can manage.</p><p>My vision wavers with each blow I deflect, but I can bear it.</p><hr><p>My mind and flesh are scraping off, and my existence is fading.</p><p>My body screams with each of her attacks, and I&#39;m beginning to see my death, a mere thirty steps ahead.</p><p>There&#39;s no fear.</p><p>All I have is...</p><hr><p>&quot;Ha, ha―――haa, haa, haha, hahaha...!&quot;</p><p>...The joy of being able to keep up with her.</p><p>I can fight.</p><p>I&#39;m fighting her.</p><p>I don&#39;t care if this is borrowed knowledge and borrowed techniques.</p><p>I&#39;m exchanging blows with Saber――――!</p><hr><p>―――There might be a chance of victory.</p><p>Saber won&#39;t use her holy sword.</p><p>Maybe because it&#39;ll break the ceiling if she uses it, or maybe it&#39;s some other reason. Either way, Saber&#39;s fighting me using only her sword technique.</p><hr><p>If that&#39;s the case, I can still manage.</p><p>There should be an opening since Saber isn&#39;t using her holy sword...!</p><hr><p>&quot;Haa――――ha, ah――――!!!!!&quot;</p><p>I move faster.</p><p>I shift into high gear and step on the gas.</p><p>The Shroud on my arm is irritating.</p><p>I hate myself for only being able to project one more time.</p><hr><p>――――Extract it.</p><p>Deeper, wider, closer to the limit.</p><p>I can keep fighting Saber if I can extract it.</p><hr><p>&quot;Kuh――――!&quot;</p><p>&quot;......!&quot;</p><p>My body jumps back.</p><p>Saber&#39;s attack pushed me away, so I jumped back to regroup.</p><hr><p>&quot;Haa―――.........

I&#39;m keeping up with you.&quot;</p><p>&quot;How can you say that, knowing your condition? ......No, you are charging ahead with this reckless plan because of your state. Your body is at its limit, even thought you do not bleed and your flesh is turning into swords.

I will return to Sakura after I defeat you.</p><p>Do you understand? Rin will have to face Sakura and me together.&quot;</p><p>&quot;――――――――&quot;</p><p>That&#39;s impossible.</p><p>Tohsaka won&#39;t be able to fight the two of them at the same time.</p><p>But conversely―――if Sakura&#39;s alone, Tohsaka will――――</p><hr><p>&quot;Yes.

Can you still use your Noble Phantasm?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes. Sakura still supplies me with magical energy.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Right, next question. Are Servants still spirits even if they take physical form? So you can&#39;t hurt them with normal weapons?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...Let&#39;s see.
