shines in through the window.</p><hr><p>&quot;Mm――――all right.&quot;</p><p>I sit up and stretch.</p><p>I feel great.</p><p>My limbs move fine, and I don&#39;t have a headache.</p><p>My body is in perfect condition, as if the fever yesterday never happened.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Then that must mean it was just heartburn.&quot;</p><p>I sigh and think it over.</p><p>...I need more training if I&#39;m losing consciousness just by recalling the events ten years ago.</p><p>My memory is vague, but I do remember Saber helping me walk home and putting me to sleep.</p><hr><p>&quot;――――I see. I have to go thank her.&quot;</p><p>I get out of my futon and change into my uniform.</p><hr><p>I bet she&#39;s still sleeping, so I&#39;ll thank her during breakfast.</p><p>It&#39;s seven o&#39;clock already, so I&#39;ll go greet Sakura in the living room.</p><hr><p>&quot;S-Senpai.&quot;</p><p>Sakura has her bag.</p><p>Breakfast is ready as well.</p><p>The table is wiped clean, ready for us to eat at any time.</p><hr><p>&quot;Huh? Breakfast&#39;s already prepared?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh, yes. I made some for you and Saber-san, since I had the time.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...? For me and Saber? What about you?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh... um, I&#39;m fine. I&#39;m going to school, so please have breakfast with just the two of you.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;......&quot;</p><p>What&#39;s wrong, Sakura? It&#39;s weird for you not to eat when you&#39;ve made some for us. ...Did something happen yesterday?&quot;</p><hr><p>...It seems like I guessed right.</p><p>But nothing happened yesterday.</p><p>Sakura went to her room after dinner, and that&#39;s all.</p><p>I think something happened after that, but I don&#39;t remember too well because of my nausea.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Oh. I think you and Saber were talking here. I didn&#39;t hear it too well, but did something happen then?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...I said something awful. I got angry because of the terrible condition you were in.&quot;</p><p>&quot;You said something awful to Saber...?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...Yes. But I was in no position to tell her such a thing. But I treated Saber-san as if she was the only one at fault.</p><p>...I can&#39;t face her today, so...&quot;</p><p>That&#39;s why she made breakfast and wants to leave before Saber wakes up?</p><hr><p>&quot;...I&#39;m sorry, Senpai. I realized my foolishness right away and apologized to her. But Saber-san apologized to me instead. Even though I&#39;m at fault, she said it&#39;s because of her carelessness.&quot;</p><hr><p>She hangs her head.</p><p>...I see.</p><p>She must feel more self-hatred because Saber apologized to her when she should be the one apologizing.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Man, you two are stupid. It&#39;s my fault since I&#39;m the one who got hurt. You two shouldn&#39;t have fought over such a thing.&quot;</p><p>&quot;But, Senpai, I...&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;It&#39;s fine. Look, she doesn&#39;t give in if the other person is at fault. She&#39;ll yell back at you if you&#39;re being unreasonable. If she&#39;s apologizing, it means she sees your point.</p><p>I&#39;m sure Saber won&#39;t say it, but she likes you. She cares for anyone that tries hard.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;―――Yes. But I should reserve myself all the more.</p><p>Since Saber-san didn&#39;t scold me, I have to scold myself or I&#39;ll get carried away.&quot;</p><p>Sakura bows to hide her embarrassment.</p><p>It seems she&#39;s going to school early no matter what.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Man. I won&#39;t stop you if you say so, but what are you going to do at school so early? Morning practice is suspended right now.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;It&#39;s fine. I&#39;m going to clean the dojo. I said such an awful thing to Saber-san, so I&#39;m going to scrub the floor as punishment.&quot;</p><p>Sakura leaves with a goodbye.</p><hr><p>&quot;Cleaning the dojo? But that&#39;s pretty hard on you to scrub the floor during wintertime.&quot;</p><p>...Well, I suppose that&#39;s the point.</p><p>What did she say to Saber to make her go so far?</p><hr><h2 id="scene-01-challenging-the-shadow" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#scene-01-challenging-the-shadow" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Scene 01 Challenging the shadow</h2><p>&quot;What? A quarrel between Sakura and me?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Huh? Didn&#39;t you two argue? Sakura was apologizing.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...Now that you mention it, it may have seemed that way. But Sakura was correct, and she merely pointed out my lack of consideration...&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;――――&quot;</p><p>Wow.</p><p>Saber is deep in thought.</p><p>Not only that, she&#39;s pondering so much that she&#39;s eating at incredible speed.</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh, I&#39;m sorry if I said something weird. Sakura seemed so worried about it that I ended up worried too. If it&#39;s not a big deal, just forget about it.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...Geez. You and Sakura are saying the same thing. Do not tell me you two are playing a prank on me.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Hey, we wouldn&#39;t play such an elaborate prank on you! What good would that be for us?&quot;</p><p>I don&#39;t even want to think of what&#39;d happen if I did play a joke on her and she found out about it.</p><hr><p>&quot;That is true. Then you must simply have been concerned for each other.&quot;</p><p>Nodding to herself, Saber digs into another omelet.</p><p>It&#39;s good to be able to eat a lot in the morning.</p><hr><p>&quot;But what did Sakura say? It takes a lot to get her that depressed. Is it all right if I ask?&quot;</p><p>&quot;U-Um. She merely pointed out my inadequacy as a Servant. In short, she told me I could not protect you because I did not have the skill.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...You&#39;re doing more than I can ask.</p><p>What happened last night was my own fault. You can&#39;t blame yourself for it.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;That is true, but... Sakura&#39;s criticism is correct. The problem is me, because I cannot assent.</p><p>I will continue taking you into battle, no matter what she tells me.&quot;</p><hr><p>She looks away awkwardly.</p><p>&quot;...?&quot;</p><p>Something is strange.</p><p>Why is Saber so preoccupied with something that they&#39;ve agreed on?</p><hr><p>&quot;...The residents grew suspicious and requested that the area be investigated――――&quot;</p><hr><p>The news is on.</p><p>I turned on the TV and found it broadcasting about an incident last night.</p><hr><p>&quot;...They found over thirty unconscious people, who were immediately taken to the hospital.</p><p>This is the seventh such incident this month, and the medical examination still believes the cause to be similar to food poisoning――――&quot;</p><hr><p>I finish breakfast and get ready for school.</p><p>I&#39;m going to go see Tohsaka.</p><p>I have to talk to her about what happened last night―――about Matou Zouken and that black shadow.</p><hr><p>&quot;...As the incident has spread to South Miyama 4th Avenue, the police believe the cause may be a spreading chemical spill――――&quot;</p><hr><p>South Miyama 4th Avenue.</p><p>That&#39;s the direction Tohsaka was staring at yesterday.</p><p>...Archer said the shadow is the cause of the incidents.</p><hr><p>...Over thirty people are in comas.</p><p>I&#39;ve experienced what they&#39;re going through firsthand.</p><p>That shadow is sucking magical energy from the people in this town, just like Caster.</p><hr><p>&quot;――――――――&quot;</p><p>No, it&#39;s worse than that.</p><p>Caster was gentle and considerate compared to that thing.</p><p>Caster took care not to harm her victims, so that she could continue to drain them.</p><p>It&#39;s like collecting blood with a syringe.</p><hr><p>...But that thing is different.</p><p>That thing was not collecting blood like Caster. That thing was &quot;eating&quot;.</p><p>The black shadow was mercilessly feeding on magical energy along with people&#39;s minds.</p><hr><p>&quot;―――Saber. I want to talk to you before I go to school.&quot;</p><p>&quot;What is it, Shirou?&quot;</p><hr><p>Saber is watching the news as well.</p><p>Saber quietly questions me like always, even though she should know what I want to talk about.</p><hr><p>&quot;It&#39;s about our future plan of action. You saw that thing too, right?&quot;</p><p>&quot;――――Yes. I have never seen its like, not resembling any of the fantasy race.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...Right. I don&#39;t know what that thing is.</p><p>But it&#39;s our enemy. It didn&#39;t look like a Master or a Servant, but it attacked me and Tohsaka, and now it&#39;s sucking magical energy out of the people in town.</p><p>Then――――&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...So our current priority is searching for that shadow?</p><p>We are to fight something that is neither a Master nor a Servant?&quot;</p><hr><p>Saber&#39;s stare is painful.</p><p>...Her goal is to obtain the Holy Grail.</p><p>But I&#39;m asking her to get involved in something completely unrelated.</p><p>It&#39;s natural for her to protest.</p><p>But still―――</p><hr><p>&quot;Yes. I can&#39;t ignore that shadow. I think this is more important than the Holy Grail War.&quot;</p><p>&quot;――――――――&quot;</p><p>Saber silently stares at me.</p><p>And when I start to think I can&#39;t bear it any longer...</p><hr><p>&quot;...Geez. I knew this was going to happen. I do not want to concern myself with that shadow, but...&quot;</p><p>&quot;Eh, Saber...? Um, is it all right...?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;My opinion does not matter, because you will try to do something by yourself even if I refuse.</p><p>I will be putting the cart before the horse. I cannot stay in this world if you die.</p><p>I can only obey, even if I am against your proposal.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Uh, you&#39;re right, but...&quot;</p><p>&quot;And I do not know how many more times you will be reckless if I leave you by yourself. It was the second time last night, so the third will certainly happen. I will have to apologize to Sakura again if that happens.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Then...&quot;</p><p>&quot;I am very reluctant, but Servants obey their Masters. I will lend you my sword if that is your decision.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;――――Saber.&quot;</p><p>&quot;But Shirou, that shadow is no ordinary opponent. It would be easier to fight Berserker than it.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Ugh... Yeah, I felt that too.</p><p>It&#39;s not a matter of it being strong or not. That thing is just ominous. I don&#39;t think we can beat it merely by striking it.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;If you understand, then there is nothing else to say.</p><p>...But Shirou. To oppose that thing is to go down the most difficult path. Please keep that in mind.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;......? Well, of course I&#39;ll be careful. But why are you saying such a thing? Do you know what that shadow is, like Archer does?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...No. Like you, I know nothing about it.&quot;</p><hr><p>Saber looks away.</p><p>And Saber says...</p><hr><p>&quot;I vaguely feel that it is the ill star itself. It is like an inescapable curse that destroys everything.&quot;</p><p>...As if to express her ominous premonition.</p><hr><h2 id="scene-02-foreseeing-the-future" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#scene-02-foreseeing-the-future" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Scene 02 Foreseeing the future</h2><p>&quot;Let&#39;s start homeroom.</p><p>Go ahead, day duty... Wait, Aikawa-kun&#39;s absent, and Aimono-san&#39;s absent too? All right, I guess I&#39;ll go ahead. Stand up, every one.&quot;</p><hr><p>...Homeroom starts.</p><p>There are more absent people, giving the room a listless feel.</p><p>Well, I think the whole school is probably like this.</p><p>Fuji-Nee lightly continues homeroom, but I don&#39;t see her usual spirit either.</p><hr><p>&quot;So, you can&#39;t have any club practices after school.</p><p>That&#39;s all I have to tell you. Oh, your first period teacher, Kuzuki-Sensei, is absent, so you have self-study. I brought you all a handout, so work on that, everyone.&quot;</p><hr><p>Everyone unanimously cheers and starts moving their desks.</p><p>Fuji-Nee doesn&#39;t care if people work on the handout or not, so everyone&#39;s free to do anything as long as they don&#39;t go out of the classroom. But――――</p><hr><p>&quot;Shirou.&quot;</p><p>...So why is she beckoning me to come see her in the hallway in such a suspicious manner?</p><hr><p>&quot;What, Fuji-Nee? It&#39;s class time, you know?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yeah, but I couldn&#39;t go see you this morning, right? So I got really worried and was wondering if you&#39;re all right.&quot;</p><p>&quot;...? What is it all of a sudden? What are you uneasy about?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Hmm, I don&#39;t really know. I just have this hunch.</p><p>Any time I get this hunch, you could get run over by a car or fall off a bridge. So I&#39;m wondering if you&#39;re all right.&quot;</p><p>&quot;――――Man. That&#39;s normal. If you call that dangerous, I&#39;ve been in danger all my life.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Yeah, but I&#39;m just worried.</p><p>It feels like there&#39;s a train we have to get on together, but you&#39;re still at the platform and I&#39;m waving goodbye to you.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Hmm. That&#39;s pretty concrete... So you woke up after that?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh, you can tell? I woke up late because of that.&quot;</p><p>&quot;......&quot;</p><hr><p>I&#39;m speechless.</p><p>So she didn&#39;t come to my house because she just woke up late?</p><p>...Well, I&#39;ll forgive her, since that&#39;s what I expect from Fuji-Nee.</p><hr><p>&quot;Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;m like always. You&#39;ve got dark circles under your eyes, Fuji-Nee. You need more sleep.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Huh? ...Well, yeah. It was busy yesterday, and it looks like it&#39;ll be busy today as well. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll be able to go over to your place, since I&#39;ll be working overtime for a while. Much as I hate to say it, you don&#39;t have to make meals for me.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;What...?&quot;</p><p>&quot;That&#39;s all. Go and work on the handout. You&#39;re not doing too well in social studies, so you might fail if you don&#39;t go study hard.&quot;</p><hr><p>Fuji-Nee cheerfully waves goodbye and leaves.</p><hr><p>&quot;...I don&#39;t have to cook for her? Well, that makes it easier, but...&quot;</p><p>It&#39;s disappointing as well.</p><p>I feel empty as if my normal everyday life has disappeared.</p><hr><h2 id="scene-03-rin-s-advice" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#scene-03-rin-s-advice" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Scene 03 Rin&#39;s advice</h2><p>&quot;Yeah. I agree with you.</p><p>I can&#39;t ignore that shadow either. I don&#39;t know the magus behind it, but I can&#39;t let him run freely on my land.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Then can we still keep our peace?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Of course. We don&#39;t have much of an option until we eliminate the shadow.&quot;</p><hr><p>―――Our conversation ends really quickly.</p><p>I went to Tohsaka&#39;s classroom, class 2-A, during lunchtime to go get her.</p><p>I told her I want to do something about that &quot;black shadow&quot;, and her answer was simple.</p><hr><p>&quot;What do you want to do? Should we patrol together starting tonight or do things separately?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Let&#39;s see... I agree, we should divide the workload.</p><p>You can keep doing your nightly patrols. Investigate any place that you or Saber think is strange.</p><p>And I&#39;ll go after Zouken while you move around in the open.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...Matou Zouken? Does he have something to do with the shadow?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Who knows? It doesn&#39;t seem likely, since Zouken was more terrified than any of us, but something&#39;s bugging me.</p><p>...Well, we can&#39;t let him be, regardless. He&#39;s acting suspicious, controlling Caster&#39;s corpse and making a non-magus like Shinji into a Master.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;―――I see. You&#39;re right. Come to think of it, we joined hands against Caster. So we can&#39;t ignore that old man.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Right. Let&#39;s fight that shadow after everything else is taken care of. Even if you find it, don&#39;t fight and just investigate it. We have to prepare before we go for the kill.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Okay, but what are you going to do? You say you&#39;re going to follow Zouken, but do you know where he is?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Huh...? Oh, I don&#39;t know where he is, but I&#39;m going to go to the Matou household. My family is connected to them, so I&#39;m more qualified.&quot;</p><p>Tohsaka states it simply.</p><p>But her plan isn&#39;t that simple.</p><hr><p>&quot;G-Go to the Matou household!? That means you&#39;re going into the enemy base!&quot;</p><p>&quot;I know. What are you so surprised about? I&#39;m not going there to fight. I&#39;m just going to investigate.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;What―――are you stupid!? What if Zouken ambushes you!?</p><p>I can&#39;t let you go alone. I&#39;ll go too, so don&#39;t be so reckless!&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Hey, you&#39;re the one being rash here.</p><p>I told you, I know the Matou family. I know their magecraft, and I can tell how strong Zouken is from yesterday&#39;s battle. He&#39;s no match for me.</p><p>That old magus is using most of his magical energy to maintain his body, so he doesn&#39;t have a direct way to attack me.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;It&#39;d actually be convenient if he came at me head-on. And Shinji&#39;s harmless because he&#39;s not a Master anymore.</p><p>You can leave the stale fight between magi to me. You go ahead and collect information.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;―――――――Mm.&quot;</p><p>I can&#39;t talk back if she can declare it like that.</p><p>...Archer will be with her, so I shouldn&#39;t worry that much.</p><hr><p>&quot;...All right. I&#39;ll leave Matou Zouken to you. Saber and I will look for the shadow.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes, please do. ...And Emiya-kun. Sakura is at your house, right?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...? Yeah, she&#39;s staying over. What about it?&quot;</p><p>&quot;No, it&#39;s nothing. I&#39;m just relieved to hear that.</p><p>It wouldn&#39;t be good if she happened to be at the mansion when I go, right?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh, you&#39;re right. ......I&#39;m surprised. You&#39;re really thoughtful.&quot;</p><p>&quot;H-Hey, why are you looking so surprised? What kind of a person did you think I was?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Well, um...&quot;</p><p>I thought she was like a storm, coming and going in a flash.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Humph. I don&#39;t care what you think of me.</p><p>Anyway, I&#39;m going to take care of Matou, so you stay quiet in your house until nightfall.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;All right. I&#39;ll leave it to you and go train with Saber. There&#39;s still some time until the sun sets.&quot;</p><p>I get up and head to the door.</p><p>Lunch break is almost over, so I should go back soon.</p><hr><p>&quot;Bye, Tohsaka.

I meant you should let Saber get some rest. That&#39;s unexpected. Sakura&#39;s the first one to come to your mind when I mention the word &#39;girl&#39;?&quot;</p><p>She grins.</p><hr><p>&quot;Ah――――, um, ugh――――&quot;</p><p>I can feel my face burning.</p><p>I feel like my brain is boiling. I half-expect steam to come shooting out of my ears.</p><hr><p>&quot;I&#39;m just joking. I&#39;m just getting back at you. Did you like that?&quot;</p><p>&quot;......Hey now. I would doubt your sanity if you liked such a thing.&quot;</p><hr><p>Strength escapes my body.</p><p>I feel like a marionette whose strings have been cut.</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh, right. That&#39;s your weak spot. I guess it was an ill-natured joke.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Heh, you&#39;re the one that&#39;s ill-natured. I&#39;m going ahead!&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Yes, please go right ahead.

There&#39;s no telling what she will do if he keeps quiet.</p><p>―――In the worst case...</p><p>She might simply kill him out of rage.</p><hr><p>&quot;Because?&quot;</p><p>&quot;――――Because...&quot;</p><p>But he can&#39;t say it.</p><p>Telling her why he became a Master is like asking for death.</p><hr><p>Even if...</p><hr><p>&quot;Then I&#39;ll say it for you. You just wanted to act like a magus. You&#39;re a failure and can&#39;t be a magus, so you wanted the Holy Grail to make you one.</p><p>You have no other goal. You&#39;re a coward that wanted proof to hide your powerlessness.&quot;</p><hr><p>...It&#39;s something trivial for others.</p><hr><p>&quot;......! Tohsaka, you...!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Am I wrong? You didn&#39;t have a Magic Circuit even though you were born to the Matou family. But that&#39;s not your fault. The Matou blood was fading away anyway. The duty of the Matou family as the seeker was fading away from the time you people came here.</p><p>But you persisted.</p><p>You thought it was special to be special, and you demanded something you didn&#39;t need. You can&#39;t be a magus even if you obtained a Magic Circuit like that, but you clung to the special right that should&#39;ve been given to you.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;D-Don&#39;t talk like you know everything...! Don&#39;t talk bullshit! I can&#39;t be a magus...!? How do you know that――――!?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I can tell. I can say with certainty that you will never be a magus, even if you obtain the Holy Grail.</p><p>You just don&#39;t have the talent. That&#39;s the difference between you and Emiya-kun.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;What...?&quot;</p><p>His jaw drops.</p><p>That name is unexpected for Matou Shinji.</p><p>It&#39;s fine if Tohsaka Rin opposes him as a Master. He expected that.</p><hr><p>But it cannot be possible for Emiya Shirou&#39;s name to come from her lips.</p><p>He is just an amateur.</p><p>He isn&#39;t from a family of magi, nor is he suited to be a Master.</p><p>It&#39;s too much for him to have Saber, so why is his name coming out of Tohsaka Rin&#39;s mouth――――!?</p><hr><p>&quot;Ha――――Hah. What? Stop that, Tohsaka. Why are you talking about Emiya!?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Because he&#39;s stronger than you. And he has the right qualities to be a magus. Emiya Shirou has something Matou Shinji does not.</p><p>...Yes, he doesn&#39;t have the talent, just like you. But he has the quality to be a magus. He is the best at it, and it&#39;s something he won&#39;t lose in.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;He&#39;s the best!? Him!? Hah, don&#39;t make me laugh, Tohsaka...!</p><p>There&#39;s nothing he has that I don&#39;t have! He&#39;s the one who&#39;s got nothing! He&#39;s just a lucky bastard that made a contract with Saber...!&quot;</p><hr><p>Shinji&#39;s hatred for Shirou must have blown his fears away, as he now faces Rin straight on.</p><p>The girl sighs and shrugs her shoulders.</p><hr><p>&quot;......I see. I guess you really are beyond help if you don&#39;t understand after all this. I thought I&#39;d hold you responsible, but you&#39;re not even worth it. I&#39;ll let you go, so go run to the church before Emiya-kun beats you.&quot;</p><hr><p>She turns her back on him.</p><p>Telling him she has no business here.</p><p>She heads for the door, not even bothering to treat Shinji as an enemy.</p><hr><p>&quot;I――――I&#39;m inferior to Emiya...?&quot;</p><p>His voice burns with hatred.</p><p>But he can do nothing but watch her go.</p><p>He&#39;ll surely be killed if he attacks her here.</p><p>Even Matou Shinji can see the difference in their powers.</p><hr><p>&quot;Tohsaka――――you, you......!&quot;</p><p>A voice filled with deep resentment.</p><p>&quot;――――――Geez, I guess it can&#39;t be helped.&quot;</p><p>She stops, and says goodbye to the boy that used to be the successor.</p><hr><p>&quot;Fine, this is the end, so I&#39;ll tell you.</p><p>Those who aim farther for others&#39; sake. Those who think of others before themselves. ...And those who hate themselves more than anyone.</p><p>These are the qualities of a magus. There is a place you can&#39;t reach, no matter how much talent you have.</p><p>...Humph. I never thought anyone would meet this condition. This is a contradiction you can only have if you&#39;re born broken.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Shinji. You&#39;re a good example of someone who nurtures a needless inferiority complex by despising others. You love yourself so much that you believe everyone else is below you, even when they are superior in every way.</p><p>...You&#39;re empty inside. The only one who thinks you&#39;re full is you, and you&#39;re just like a balloon. Your destination changes depending on the wind.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Uh――――――guh.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Do you understand? One such as you is unfit to be a magus. A Servant would never obey such a person.</p><p>This world is unrelated to you. No matter how much you consider yourself to be a Master, you can never be a Master.&quot;</p><hr><p>―――The sound of retreating footsteps.</p><p>Tohsaka Rin leaves Matou Shinji alone in the dark room.</p><hr><p>&quot;――――Ha. Haha, hahaha.&quot;</p><p>He drops down the wall.</p><p>Matou Shinji crumples down like a puppet with its strings cut and keeps laughing.</p><hr><p>&quot;I see. So that&#39;s how it is?&quot;</p><p>His tongue licks over dry lips.</p><p>A dull sound.</p><p>The boy smacks his head hard against the wall behind him, as if trying to break his skull.</p><p>&quot;――――In short...</p><p>He just has to disappear, right, Tohsaka?&quot;</p><p>His laughter continues.</p><hr><h2 id="scene-08-peaceful-day" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#scene-08-peaceful-day" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Scene 08 Peaceful day</h2><p>&quot;All right, Sakura.

Yet a dragon&#39;s fury will soon be unleashed... well, this is a dilemma.&quot;</p><hr><p>The skull mask crawls on the ground.</p><p>It looks like a spider on a wall.</p><p>The compressed wind becomes a swirl of vacuum, about to be released at Assassin.</p><p>He must be insane.</p><p>Does he think he can survive the fatal whirlwind simply by lying on the ground?</p><hr><p>&quot;Well. This should be the end no matter what. Let me talk before that.</p><p>―――You said you can beat me one-on-one, correct?&quot;</p><p>Saber raises her sword.</p><p>He cannot withdraw even when he is talking.</p><p>Saber is staring at Assassin.</p><p>Even if Assassin were to teleport, she would kill him before it even took place.</p><hr><p>&quot;That is why you drew me away from your Master. You were correct to protect him from me.&quot;</p><p>Her sword is raised above her head.</p><p>With the attack poised to strike, Assassin crawls even lower.</p><hr><p>&quot;But did that decision include protecting yourself?&quot;</p><p>An inquiring voice.</p><p>To that...</p><p>&quot;―――I am in a hurry. Farewell, Assassin.&quot;</p><p>...Saber replies with a single attack.</p><hr><p>The match is decided.</p><p>The windstorm is like a heavenly dragon, its serpentine body winding about to devour its prey.</p><hr><p>There is no chance of defense or evasion.</p><p>This is like Lancer&#39;s lance. This is a blow that cannot be blocked unless one has more magical energy than Invisible Air.</p><p>Assassin&#39;s magical energy is far short of Saber&#39;s.</p><p>The only way for him to survive the attack was to prevent Saber from releasing it.</p><hr><p>But that is too late, and the whirlwind has been released.</p><p>His black cloak will be torn to shreds a mere second after the blade descends.</p><p>The dislocation of death closes in with a swirl.</p><p>With that in front of him...</p><p>&quot;[wacky len=12]!&quot;</p><p>...Assassin charges at the wave of vacuum with a yell of delight.</p><hr><p>&quot;――――Guh......!&quot;</p><p>An attack aimed for the neck.</p><p>Saber repels it at once, and the black figure vaults overhead to land behind her.</p><hr><p>&quot;You――――!&quot;</p><p>In a flash, she turns and slashes behind her.</p><p>But Assassin has already jumped out of range.</p><hr><p>At the same time,</p><p>&quot;――――――――What?&quot;</p><p>The &quot;ominous presence&quot; she has been feeling has covered the ground beneath her.</p><hr><p>&quot;―――Well. You were unfortunate in two ways, Saber.&quot;</p><p>The shadow expands.</p><p>The mud-like pollution invades on her silver.</p><hr><p>&quot;One is affinity. A curse to ward off storms is a necessity for travelers in the desert. The only magecraft I know is the warding of wind. And――――&quot;</p><p>Darkness swallows the pathway.</p><p>A shadow that does not even reveal itself in spite of the white moonlight.</p><p>And――――</p><p>She sees it dimly, through the haze of her fading consciousness.</p><hr><p>&quot;Assassin――――you――――&quot;</p><p>&quot;That&#39;s right, Saber. The other is that you chose this place as the battlefield. You should have known something ominous inhabited this place.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;――――, ――――Ah.&quot;</p><p>She cannot even hear Assassin&#39;s words.</p><p>She would disappear in a matter of seconds.</p><p>This shadow swallows Servants.</p><p>Her body detests it before her fading mind.</p><hr><p>&quot;Ha――――ah, ahhhhhhh――――!&quot;</p><p>She does not care how.</p><p>She has to escape, even if she has to use all her magical energy.</p><p>―――Only her feet have been engulfed.</p><p>If she fights with all her power, she can still break free.</p><p>Even if she may lose most of her magical energy and both her feet, escaping this shadow is the top priority now.</p><hr><p>But.</p><hr><p>&quot;―――No. You will disappear here, Saber.&quot;</p><p>The shadow is not her only enemy.</p><p>The skull, watching Saber get swallowed, is Death that finishes her off.</p><hr><p>&quot;So――――from the start...&quot;</p><p>&quot;You said you could beat me one-on-one. Yes, that was your mistake. You are alone, but there are two on my side. I merely had to distract you.&quot;</p><p>The shadow keeps invading.</p><hr><p>&quot;......! Ah―――guh, ah――――&quot;</p><p>Her existence rots from her feet.</p><p>She cannot feel her toes or her feet.</p><p>Her legs are already something that does not exist in this world.</p><hr><p>&quot;Servants cannot oppose al-layl, the true night. All the more if you are a proper heroic spirit. Even I, one who is close to it, get my magical energy drained if I touch it. A genuine like you should lose consciousness just by touching it.</p><p>...But that would be a shameful waste. My goal cannot be accomplished if I let you disappear. I shall take your heart.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;What――――you will?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Is it strange? I have run out of daggers, and I cannot go near the shadow. Do you think it&#39;s impossible for me to kill you?&quot;</p><hr><p>Murderous intent lights up in the skull.</p><p>Faint traces of magical energy gather in his right arm.</p><hr><p>...Assassin&#39;s right arm is a stick.</p><p>A deformed arm without a hand cannot be used as an arm.</p><p>It cannot hold a dagger, nor can it be used to strike someone.</p><p>But now, that arm bends.</p><p>With the snap of breaking bones, it flaps like a tattered wing.</p><hr><p>It is an abomination.</p><p>What a long arm.</p><p>The clubbed stump at its end was actually the elbow.</p><p>The arm was folded back at the elbow, with the hand stitched to Assassin&#39;s shoulder.</p><hr><p>&quot;――――――――&quot;</p><p>Saber&#39;s mind freezes.</p><p>It will reach.</p><p>That arm can reach her.</p><p>It will reach her and rip out her heart.</p><p>His arm flaps, sending a shudder through her body, and――――</p><hr><p>The cursed arm is thrust like a lance.</p><p>A sound of cutting meat and gushing blood.</p><p>Her blood drips onto the floor, staining the shadow in crimson.</p><hr><p>&quot;――――――――Ki.&quot;</p><p>Madness leaks out from the skull mask.</p><p>The outstretched arm is stained red.</p><p>After finishing its job, the arm folds back to Assassin...</p><hr><p>&quot;Ki, kikikikikikiki――――!!!!&quot;</p><p>...And is severed at the elbow.</p><hr><p>&quot;Y-You, how dare you do that with that dying body of yours――――!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Haa――――Haa――――&quot;</p><p>...Her upraised sword falls to the ground.</p><p>Assassin&#39;s cursed arm did not reach Saber.</p><p>Saber&#39;s sword has cut the cursed arm before it could gouge out the reflected image of her heart.</p><hr><p>No matter how cornered she may be, Assassin&#39;s Noble Phantasm is not enough to kill Saber.</p><p>No.</p><p>As she has blocked Lancer&#39;s lance, which reverses cause and effect, she cannot allow herself to be defeated by this cursed arm.</p><hr><p>&quot;Ah――――guh.&quot;</p><p>But that is her last act of resistance.</p><p>She has put the power to escape into the attack.</p><hr><p>She has no power to escape now, and even if she did, it is too late.</p><p>The ominous presence now emanates from within herself.</p><p>The shadow has invaded her legs and is now up to her waist.</p><p>She is becoming a part of this darkness, which swallows up even the moonlight.</p><p>Then――――everything is too late.</p><hr><p>...The shadow creeps up.</p><p>As her vision fades, the silver swordsman...</p><p>&quot;Forgive me――――Shirou.&quot;</p><p>...Manages one last, apologetic gasp before sinking into the deep mud.</p><hr><h2 id="scene-14-the-battle-at-ryudou-temple" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#scene-14-the-battle-at-ryudou-temple" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Scene 14 The battle at Ryudou Temple</h2><p>...Matou Zouken is standing there, his figure just like before.</p><p>His body, which Archer sliced in two before my eyes, is whole once more.</p><p>The old magus that could only wait for death is laughing, as if that event was an illusion.</p><hr><p>I don&#39;t know how he did it, but if he really did recover from that state, it&#39;s more on a level of restoration than recovery.</p><p>It&#39;s not just healing a wound.</p><p>It takes great magecraft to restore a piece of one&#39;s body that has been lost.</p><p>Then―――isn&#39;t this called immortality?</p><hr><p>&quot;Well.

I think that&#39;s enough disinfectant. Just wipe the wound and put gauze on it.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;No! We have to disinfect it properly because your back is all red! And it&#39;s natural that it hurts. You came home with such a big wound, so please bear it.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Ouch!&quot;</p><p>...Is it because of the archery club or Fuji-Nee that she&#39;s merciless toward injured people?</p><hr><p>&quot;Does it hurt anywhere else, Senpai?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Mm...? No, I only hurt my stomach and back. Everything else is fine.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;I see. Then all that&#39;s left is to put some gauze on and tape it up.&quot;</p><p>Sakura handles the first-aid kit with practiced ease.</p><p>She looks so intent on it that I don&#39;t want to interrupt.</p><hr><p>&quot;――――――――Phew.&quot;</p><p>Well.</p><p>Let&#39;s explain why this is happening.

I can treat myself, so you don&#39;t have to push yourself. Besides, my back is even worse.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I-It&#39;s all right! I&#39;ll do it! Please let me do it!&quot;</p><p>She was so flustered that I half-expected her to faint when she saw the wound on my back.</p><hr><p>&quot;S-S-Senpai, please take off your shirt.&quot;</p><p>I didn&#39;t want to stop Sakura, since I couldn&#39;t treat my own back.</p><p>I did as I was told and let her treat me.</p><hr><p>Still, it was so bad that she couldn&#39;t do anything for a while.</p><p>She stared at it for a few minutes and started treating me after a gulp.</p><hr><p>&quot;――――――――&quot;</p><p>That was twenty minutes ago.</p><p>It&#39;s past two o&#39;clock now.</p><p>Sakura&#39;s careful treatment is about to end.</p><hr><p>&quot;―――Okay, it&#39;s all done now. Here&#39;s a new shirt, so please put this on.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Huh...? It&#39;s done already? Thanks, Sakura.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;You&#39;re welcome. Thanks for your patience.&quot;</p><p>I put on the new shirt and take a deep breath.</p><p>...There&#39;s nothing to be done about my stomach, but my back feels much better.</p><p>I&#39;ll sleep face-down tonight, and hopefully it&#39;ll be better tomorrow.</p><hr><p>&quot;Well. Let&#39;s get some sleep. I&#39;m sorry I kept you up so late, Sakura.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Eh―――no, that&#39;s fine, but...&quot;</p><p>Sakura hangs her head.</p><p>It seems like she wants to say something, but can&#39;t.</p><hr><p>&quot;Sakura? Did something happen while I was gone?&quot;</p><p>&quot;......No, um... Senpai, did Saber-san go home?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;――――――――&quot;</p><p>I get dizzy for a second.</p><p>&#39;Did Saber-san go home?&#39;</p><hr><p>When I hear the words from someone else, the reality of it finally sinks in.</p><hr><p>&quot;――――Yeah. I know it was sudden, but she went home. She&#39;s not coming back.&quot;</p><hr><p>I endure my dizziness and answer calmly.</p><p>...It&#39;s not like it&#39;s a stupid question.</p><p>Of course she would think something happened if Saber, who was here four hours ago, is gone.</p><p>But I have to put on a strong face and act like nothing&#39;s wrong.</p><hr><p>&quot;Saber was talking about you before she went away. She said you should take it easy because you&#39;re the type that thinks too hard.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...I see. I wish I could&#39;ve told her goodbye, since we just made up.&quot;</p><p>―――I can&#39;t even nod to that.</p><p>Saber disappeared before I could even say goodbye.</p><hr><p>...The fact makes my heart feel so heavy that I want to vomit.</p><p>A collaborator for only six days.</p><p>My partner for only six days.</p><p>How can I repay her―――the one who was my sword for only six days?</p><hr><p>&quot;But I&#39;m glad. Ever since she came, you&#39;ve been getting injured all the time. Now everything&#39;s back to normal.&quot;</p><p>&quot;What?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Isn&#39;t that right? I won&#39;t ask you what you were doing, but you were going out to help Saber-san, right?</p><p>Now that she&#39;s gone, you&#39;re not going to be exposed to danger anymore.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;You&#39;re wrong. I&#39;m going to keep going out at night, even though Saber&#39;s gone. ...Um, it&#39;s not that I was helping Saber. Saber was helping me.&quot;</p><hr><p>I stand up.</p><p>My tension is gone now that the treatment is over.</p><p>I&#39;m getting really sleepy.</p><hr><p>&quot;Eh――――Senpai?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Good night, Sakura.</p><p>And while we&#39;re on the topic... I&#39;ll be leaving my house a lot more often starting tomorrow, but you can keep using this place like you&#39;ve been.</p><p>I&#39;ll come home late, like tonight, but I don&#39;t want you to worry and go to sleep. Please don&#39;t wait by the door for me like you did tonight.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;............Okay.

Senpai, Senpai, Senpai...!&quot;</p><p>...Her fingers start to move wildly as if to match her breathing.</p><p>The wet sound slowly gets louder into something indecent.</p><hr><p>&quot;Ah―――hm... No―――I... shouldn&#39;t... be doing... this――――&quot;</p><p>The feeling of guilt excites her even more.</p><p>His wounded body. Thinking about the blood on his back makes her dizzy.</p><p>The girl who won&#39;t be coming back. The realization that, once again, he is all hers. Many lies.</p><p>The dark emotions, unthinkable for her usual self, draw her down into a darker passion.</p><hr><p>&quot;Hah, haa, ha, mm...! Sen... pai... Ah, I, I―――ah... Hm... no...!&quot;</p><p>But those are trivial matters.</p><p>What she&#39;s truly glad about is that the boy has come back to her.</p><hr><p>&quot;Nhaa...! Ha, haa, ah, Senpai&#39;s, fingers―――more―――no, having him back... is enough...!&quot;</p><p>...But it&#39;s not enough.</p><p>Tonight made that clear.</p><p>He cares for her, but he tries to protect her by keeping her away.</p><hr><p>&quot;Ah, nha, hah, ah...! No, Senpai, I――――I want, you to be, next to me...!&quot;</p><p>She knows it&#39;s a greedy wish.</p><p>Her passion gets worse because it is a wish she should never speak of, a wish that will never come true.</p><hr><p>&quot;Mm―――uha, ah, hm...! I&#39;m sorry―――I&#39;m sorry, Senpai, I&#39;m... sorry...!&quot;</p><p>―――A heated masturbation.</p><p>The repeated repentance cools off the</p><hr><p>girl&#39;s temporary madness.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Mm... Ah...... Haa... ah――――&quot;</p><p>She stares at the ceiling absent-mindedly.</p><p>The overwhelming self-hatred after the climax is familiar to her.</p><p>But a heavier agony assails her tonight.</p><hr><p>...The wounded body.</p><p>He said he intends to continue fighting, even after receiving such wounds.</p><hr><p>&quot;......What should I do? Senpai&#39;s going to get hurt even more like this...&quot;</p><p>She thinks as her body sweats.</p><p>It&#39;s a worry without an answer, a problem the girl cannot solve.</p><p>She cannot come up with a way to stop him, even if she thinks all night.</p><p>But...</p><hr><p>&quot;――――I see. I just have to keep him from going outside.&quot;</p><p>She reaches a simple answer with a calm voice.</p><p>Delighted by her sudden insight, she smiles and...</p><p>&quot;Right. You won&#39;t get in any more danger if you&#39;re hurt so badly that you can&#39;t walk――――&quot;</p><p>Whispers to herself with a sigh of relief.</p><hr><h2 id="scene-23-intermission-report" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#scene-23-intermission-report" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Scene 23 Intermission Report</h2><p>It is a room that smells of stone.</p><p>The light is not artificial but natural.</p><p>The lamp&#39;s flame shines on the man&#39;s back and illuminates the parchment in his hand.</p><hr><p>&quot;―――Is that a report for the Association? You certainly are a busy man, Kotomine.&quot;</p><p>The voice comes from behind him without revealing its source.</p><p>The man on the chair, Kotomine Kirei, moves on to his next task without the slightest reaction.</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh, so this is about that usurper.</p><p>Hm, 57 victims with five dead. Is this a lot from the supervisor&#39;s perspective, Kotomine?&quot;</p><p>&quot;―――I can&#39;t say much as of this moment. This is the first instance of large-scale unconsciousness, but there&#39;s no problem if it stays this way. Either association is aware of the necessary clean-up measures.</p><p>But――――&quot;</p><p>&quot;If it continues at this pace, huh? ...Heh, I do not know who is doing this, but they&#39;re being quite brazen.</p><p>...Have you realized, Kotomine? If nothing is done, this town will become barren of life.&quot;</p><hr><p>Kotomine does not answer.</p><p>He knows what the man wants to say.</p><hr><p>The strange shadow that appeared in this town.</p><p>It&#39;s only sucking up life force right now, but the amount is increasing by day.</p><p>The abnormality that first surfaced two days ago will exceed the regulated allowances in a few days.</p><p>For the moment, it only causes dyspnea, but it should soon be enough to kill even a healthy adult male in one night.</p><hr><p>&quot;But that is needless worry. It should not be an amateur, so it should know its limits.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Is that so? That worm-user does not seem like it, but such a person will become a curse if you do not take care of it quickly. It is not my style to watch people in this town die.&quot;</p><hr><p>This statement takes Kotomine by surprise.</p><p>This man, who does not care about anyone else, is concerned for the people.</p><hr><p>&quot;I&#39;m surprised. What is going on, Gilgamesh?&quot;</p><p>&quot;It should not be surprising. I do not like it when people are killed by someone besides me. People will lose their way with boring crime and punishment. Such pain is not entertaining at all.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...I see. Then you are indeed a heroic spirit.</p><p>You use death to save people from the agony of life. Then your wish is death?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Of course. This age is filled with meaningless, worthless people. Exterminating them will be doing them a service.&quot;</p><hr><p>His scorning voice is filled with absolute dominance and dignity.</p><p>The priest does not stop his work as he listens.</p><hr><p>&quot;―――I see.</p><p>You can use the Holy Grail, if that is what you wish. It will be yours unless someone who can defeat you appears.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Hm? You do not have a wish, Kotomine?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I don&#39;t have a clear wish. The only thing I have is the desire for clear pleasure.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Ha―――Hahaha, I see, so you only have pleasure――――!&quot;</p><hr><p>The man starts laughing at the simple answer.</p><p>It&#39;s as if he&#39;s delighted and proud of his partner.</p><hr><p>&quot;All right. I shall kill because they are disgusting, and you shall kill because it is fun. Our motives are different, but we seek the same thing from the Holy Grail. That must be why you have kept me!&quot;</p><p>&quot;――――――――&quot;</p><p>The priest does not answer.</p><p>He merely continues his work.</p><hr><p>&quot;Hah―――I do not care even if you do nothing. I shall do as I please.&quot;</p><p>The man&#39;s presence disappears.</p><p>The priest glances at the exit of the silent stone room.</p><hr><p>&quot;He seems insane, but he is sane at the core. It seems the mud was unable to pollute his soul.&quot;</p><p>King of heroes, Gilgamesh.</p><p>The golden Servant is the most powerful being at this point in time.</p><p>The fact is accepted as truth by all. Even Kotomine, the game master himself, does not doubt it.</p><p>But――――</p><hr><p>&quot;There are worthless things, but there are no meaningless things.</p><p>...Beware, king of heroes. If there is something that will bring you defeat, it will be just that.&quot;</p><p>His monologue does not reach anyone.</p><p>Lit by the dim light, the priest resembles a prophet seeing into the future.</p><hr></div><!--[--><!--]--></div><footer class="page-meta"><div class="meta-item edit-link"><a class="external-link meta-item-label" href="https://github.com/r-grandorder/tri-hermes/edit/main/src/Novels/FSN/HF/Day08.md" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" aria-label="Help us improve this page!"><!--[--><!--]--> Help us improve this page! <span><svg class="external-link-icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewbox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path><polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg><span class="external-link-icon-sr-only">open in new window</span></span><!--[--><!--]--></a></div><div class="meta-item last-updated"><span class="meta-item-label">Last Updated: </span><!----></div><div class="meta-item contributors"><span class="meta-item-label">Contributors: </span><span class="meta-item-info"><!--[--><!--[--><span class="contributor" title="email: 59034871+Fgrandorder@users.noreply.github.com">Lib</span><!----><!--]--><!--]--></span></div></footer><!----><!--[--><!--]--></main><!--]--></div><!----><!--]--></div>
