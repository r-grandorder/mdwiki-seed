id="scene-00" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#scene-00" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Scene 00</h2><p>Well.</p><p>Now we&#39;re drinking tea after dinner.</p><hr><p>&quot;So, projection has its limitations.</p><p>Its power seems unlimited since it makes your imagination real, but projection has its own set of rules.</p><p>The simplest is about the projected object&#39;s durability. The strength of its existence.&quot;[l]</p><p>Tohsaka puts up a finger as she drinks her tea.</p><hr><p>&quot;Strength of its existence...? What? You mean its flimsiness in being unable to bear the existence of the illusion?&quot;</p><p>I sip the tea and tilt my head in wonder.</p><hr><p>&quot;...You seem like you don&#39;t know anything, but you know some interesting terms. ...Well, you&#39;re not right, but not wrong.</p><p>Projection uses your mental image to completely reproduce the genuine object. There is no exception to this.</p><p>You can&#39;t project it if it&#39;s not perfect inside of you. As it is a shadow of the true object, the projection magecraft requires that there be no mistake.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;So―――basically, the projected object has the strength as you imagine it. An illusion is perfect in this regard.</p><p>The closer the knowledge and the image are to the true object, the more perfect the projected object is in real life.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...Hm? Wait, that&#39;s strange.</p><p>I projected Archer&#39;s swords. But Kuzuki destroyed them.</p><p>I know Caster strengthened Kuzuki&#39;s fists, but they aren&#39;t strong enough to destroy a Noble Phantasm.</p><p>Doesn&#39;t that mean the Kanshou and Bakuya I projected are inferior to the originals?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Yes, you realized a very good point, Emiya-kun.</p><p>That&#39;s the limit of projection, the strength of the object&#39;s existence.</p><p>Projection is just a projection. It&#39;s not creation. What makes the projection is the image in the caster&#39;s mind. So when a flaw is created in the image, the projected object vanishes even if it has the same ability as the original.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...? When a flaw is created in the image...? Isn&#39;t that also strange? You can&#39;t project it if the image is incorrect, right?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Right. So the flaw would be created after it is projected.</p><p>...Let&#39;s see. Let&#39;s say you project a &#39;sword that will not break&#39;.&quot;</p><p>I nod.</p><p>Tohsaka nods in satisfaction.</p><hr><p>&quot;But a sword that will not break doesn&#39;t exist.</p><p>It&#39;s just that the sword is famed or called &#39;unbreakable&#39;, so it can break if it comes across an illusion greater than itself.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...? Doesn&#39;t it mean my image was wrong once it breaks? I made a sword that won&#39;t break, right?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;That&#39;s wrong.</p><p>It&#39;s perfect the moment you project it. First of all, a &#39;sword that will not break&#39; is just a name. There isn&#39;t an actual sword that won&#39;t break.</p><p>But what you imagined is a &#39;sword that won&#39;t break&#39;, right? If this sword breaks in real life, what is projected becomes a lie.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;This isn&#39;t because the &#39;sword broke&#39;.</p><p>What you imagined is a &#39;sword that will not break&#39;.</p><p>So when it breaks, the &#39;sword that broke&#39; and the &#39;sword that will not break&#39; in your imagination become two separate things.</p><p>―――It&#39;s because the scales between you and reality tip.&quot;</p><hr><p>...?</p><p>So, if I sum it up...</p><hr><p>&quot;―――All right.</p><p>So, I imagined a sword that would not break and projected it. But the projected sword broke during battle.</p><p>When that happened, I denied the sword, saying &#39;Hey, this sword broke.&#39; As a result, the projected sword disappeared.</p><p>And that&#39;s because there was an inconsistency between reality and the image, right?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;You&#39;re pretty bright. Yes, you&#39;re right.</p><p>You projected Archer&#39;s swords.</p><p>I don&#39;t know how you ranked Archer&#39;s swords, but you did not imagine swords that would break from Kuzuki&#39;s attacks.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;But the swords were destroyed.</p><p>At that time, you thought, &#39;these aren&#39;t Archer&#39;s swords&#39;.</p><p>The projected swords were denied by the maker, so they lost their strength of existence and became a fantasy once again.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;――――――――&quot;</p><p>...I see.</p><p>Even projected weapons can break.</p><p>But it&#39;s not the enemy, but you, who make them disappear from this world.</p><p>When the difference between the reality and the image becomes too large to be reconciled, the projected weapon disappears.</p><p>It is because the one who projected the weapon stops believing in the image.</p><hr><p>&quot;Do you get it now? So projection starts from the blueprint. You should consider material, properties, and even its history. If you have those down, I don&#39;t think the projected object will disappear right away even if it&#39;s a bit different.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Huh? Wouldn&#39;t you start from how it was considered to be made?</p><p>Materials and techniques aren&#39;t enough.</p><p>Let&#39;s take today&#39;s dinner as example. It started when you said you wanted to eat Japanese food, right? So you have to start from the very beginning of the creation.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;――――――――&quot;</p><p>Oh.</p><p>Tohsaka&#39;s stunned.</p><hr><p>&quot;............&quot;</p><p>Tohsaka stares at me.</p><p>I drink tea and tilt my head in wonder.</p><hr><p>&quot;Hey, how did we start talking about this in the first place?&quot;</p><p>&quot;...You&#39;re right. I thought we were talking about what our future course of action should be...&quot;</p><hr><p>Oh yeah.</p><p>We were talking about what our course of action should be...</p><p>&quot;Shirou. Do you want to seriously practice projection magecraft?&quot;</p><p>...When Tohsaka derailed the conversation.</p><hr><p>&quot;...I remember now. We were so stumped that we started placing hope on uncertain factors.&quot;</p><p>&quot;―――Yeah.</p><p>First of all, all I can manage to project are swords. That hasn&#39;t helped me too much, so it&#39;s probably not much use.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;............&quot;</p><p>Oh, she&#39;s looking at me with those eyes again.</p><p>...I wonder why. She always makes that face when we talk about projection magecraft.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Oh well. Let&#39;s confirm our current situation.</p><p>For now, our enemy is Caster. She isn&#39;t too bad by herself, but we can&#39;t do anything as long as she&#39;s protected by Kuzuki and Archer.</p><p>Plus, it&#39;s only a matter of time before Saber is controlled. The situation is getting worse by the second――――&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...Yeah. But Saber isn&#39;t under Caster&#39;s complete control.</p><p>That gives us a chance of victory.</p><p>There&#39;s no chance of victory once Saber gives in.&quot;</p><hr><p>I can&#39;t let that happen.</p><p>She told me to run.</p><p>She told me as she cried. So for Saber&#39;s sake, I can&#39;t let Caster do as she wishes.</p><hr><p>&quot;――――That&#39;s right.</p><p>So, raise your hand if you have an idea. Shirou, do you have any good ideas?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Hm――――&quot;</p><p>An idea that will break the current deadlock.</p><p>If there is a way to oppose Caster, it is――――</p><hr><h2 id="scene-01" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#scene-01" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Scene 01</h2><p>&quot;―――There aren&#39;t any more plans to consider.</p><p>We won&#39;t use any tricks and just fight them head on.&quot;</p><p>I stare at Tohsaka straight in the face.</p><hr><p>&quot;......So.</p><p>Let me ask you just in case. Are you serious?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;――――――――Ugh.&quot;</p><p>...This is intense.</p><p>Tohsaka isn&#39;t stunned, but really angry.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Sorry, I just said it on a whim. I&#39;m sorry I wasn&#39;t thinking at all.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yeah. For a second, I thought about breaking my alliance with you, you idiot.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Yeah, yeah, I know I&#39;m stupid.</p><p>...So what about you? Do you have a plan?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Huh? ...Well, I do have one, but can I say it?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...? What&#39;s wrong? You&#39;re timid for once. Just say it if you have a plan.</p><p>I&#39;ll listen to whatever you have to say. Well, I&#39;ll object if it sounds unrealistic.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Then I&#39;ll tell you.</p><p>It&#39;s obvious that we can&#39;t beat Caster by ourselves, right?</p><p>So we have to increase our force.</p><p>They have three Servants, so we should have at least one.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Increase our force...? Then we&#39;re going to go ask other Masters for help?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;No, it&#39;s more like cooperation. Caster is a powerful force now, so other Masters can&#39;t just keep watching, right?</p><p>If they want the Holy Grail, we have to collaborate to defeat the most powerful force. We can break the collaboration after that.</p><p>This is a basic tactic in battle royal, right?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;――――――――&quot;</p><p>So we&#39;ll make an alliance of the remaining Masters since Caster is so strong now, huh?</p><hr><p>&quot;...I see. We might be able to cooperate depending on how the negotiations turn out.[l]</p><p>Then...&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Yes, there are two remaining Masters now. Lancer&#39;s Master and Berserker&#39;s Master.</p><p>There&#39;s no way to negotiate with Lancer&#39;s Master because his identity is unknown. But we might have a chance with Berserker&#39;s Master, Illyasviel.&quot;</p><hr><p>Berserker&#39;s Master.</p><p>The white girl and the statue-like giant I met on the night when it all began.</p><p>She sounded dangerous, but I don&#39;t think she&#39;s cruel.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Yeah. I think she would at least listen to us. I don&#39;t think she&#39;ll ask for much in return, either.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;―――You idiot. She&#39;s the most dangerous for you.</p><p>She was only looking at you, Shirou. I don&#39;t know what she&#39;ll do to you.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;W-What do you mean? I&#39;ve only met her once, so that can&#39;t be possible. Quit scaring me like that, Tohsaka.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;......Humph. We&#39;ll stop the negotiation right then if that does happen.&quot;</p><p>Then...</p><p>Tohsaka averts her gaze and gulps down her tea.</p><hr><p>&quot;...But we can only bet on Illyasviel for now. If Archer is right about Caster&#39;s identity, Berserker would be her natural enemy.</p><p>They knew each other when they were alive, so he should know Caster&#39;s tricks. Berserker can handle Caster and Archer by himself. We can take care of Kuzuki while he does so.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;That&#39;s an optimistic thought. But does Berserker really know Caster?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Yes, Archer told me that Berserker&#39;s true identity is Hercules.</p><p>If Caster really is that witch, Berserker might know her through the Argo Expedition.</p><p>It&#39;s just like how I don&#39;t get along with Kirei.

Oh, I see.</p><p>I&#39;m sorry, but there aren&#39;t any secret passages in that church. That was the first time I&#39;ve seen the underground temple.

There aren&#39;t many people here that know about Gilgamesh.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;―――That&#39;s true, but the change in power from popularity isn&#39;t that big.</p><p>It seemed to me like that goldie had an unfair advantage...&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...?&quot;</p><p>Tohsaka calls him by a strange name.</p><p>Well, with that aside.</p><hr><p>&quot;He did. All the Noble Phantasms he has are real. ...No, they are all originals of the real ones.</p><p>Gilgamesh is a hero in the oldest myth, and he was a king that indulged in every possible luxury. Then it shouldn&#39;t be strange for him to own all the originals of the legendary weapons.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh―――then what? The Noble Phantasms he used weren&#39;t Noble Phantasms, but just weapons...?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;I&#39;d assume so. I bet his Noble Phantasm is his &#39;treasury&#39;.</p><p>I think his Noble Phantasm is the &#39;treasury&#39; where he kept all the weapons he collected during his life.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...I see. Then it&#39;s natural that Berserker couldn&#39;t beat him. Every heroic spirit has a weak point. If he has the originals of every Noble Phantasm, he just needs to take out the one that is the most effective against his enemy.&quot;</p><hr><p>...That&#39;s right.</p><p>If there is a chance of victory, it is that he is not a master of these weapons.</p><p>He is not a &quot;wielder&quot; that has mastered his weapon to the limit, so I think there is still a way to beat him.</p><p>But with all that aside...</p><hr><p>&quot;Hey, Tohsaka. This has nothing to do with this, but why did you call him goldie?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Huh...!? Um, I guess... um, he had golden hair.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;What are you saying? You should have called Saber that if that&#39;s the case. It seemed like you said it with a lot of meaning behind it. I think you noticed something, right?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Huh――――?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Don&#39;t hide it now. You noticed something, right?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Y-You&#39;re wrong. It&#39;s nothing serious like you&#39;re thinking, so don&#39;t worry too much about it.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Don&#39;t lie. You wouldn&#39;t call him goldie for nothing. Come on, Tohsaka. I want as much information as possible right now.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Uh――――Uh.&quot;</p><p>I stare at Tohsaka.</p><p>After a few seconds...</p><p>She sighs as if she&#39;s given up.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Well... he had many valuable looking things, right? So I just thought he&#39;s really rich.</p><p>...That&#39;s why I called him goldie. He looks like he&#39;s living a luxurious life, right?&quot;</p><hr><p>Tohsaka scratches her cheek while looking away.</p><p>How scary.</p><p>It seems anyone who&#39;s rich is called goldie by Tohsaka.</p><p>What&#39;s more scary is that Tohsaka figured out the Servant&#39;s true nature just because he &quot;seemed rich&quot;.</p><hr><p>&quot;―――Anyways, that&#39;s another troublesome guy. There&#39;s not supposed to be an eighth Servant, so he would be the Joker.</p><p>...I want to question Kirei as the supervisor, but I don&#39;t know his whereabouts.</p><p>Well, we have to postpone that since Caster is more important right now.&quot;</p><hr><p>...That&#39;s right.</p><p>Caster is obtaining more power as we speak.</p><p>Saber should not be able to oppose Caster&#39;s control much longer.</p><p>No.</p><p>In the worst case, Saber could already be under her control.</p><hr><p>&quot;―――Yeah.</p><p>We couldn&#39;t get Illyasviel&#39;s help, but that doesn&#39;t mean we can let them be. We&#39;ll just have to think of a way to beat Caster with the two of us.&quot;</p><p>&quot;...Yeah. We don&#39;t have any ideas, but we&#39;ll have to.&quot;</p><hr><p>She sighs and sits on the rubble.</p><p>&quot;...Phew. I never thought we&#39;d have a strategic meeting in a castle.&quot;</p><p>I follow Tohsaka&#39;s lead and sit down.</p><hr><p>...Well, we&#39;ll have a bed to sleep in here.</p><p>If we&#39;re lucky, we might even find some magical item of Illyasviel&#39;s.</p><hr><p>And the moment we let our guard down...</p><p>&quot;Get real. You&#39;re going to defeat them just by yourselves?</p><p>That&#39;s impossible, you idiots.&quot;</p><p>A stunned voice comes from the front entrance.</p><hr><p>&quot;!?&quot;</p><p>We jump up and turn to face the speaker.</p><hr><p>&quot;Since that night, huh? It&#39;s great you two are still hanging in there.&quot;</p><p>&quot;L―――Lancer...!?&quot;</p><hr><p>I quickly concentrate and connect my Magic Circuit.</p><p>He is certainly Lancer.</p><p>...He speared my heart on that night ten days ago.</p><p>I can&#39;t let it happen again.</p><p>I have to let Tohsaka escape before he attacks―――!</p><hr><p>&quot;Get away, Shirou...! I&#39;ll keep him busy, so you run to the second floor...!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Run, Tohsaka...! I&#39;ll hold him back, so you run outside――――!&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;――――Hold on.</p><p>It seems you weren&#39;t listening to me at all when I told you to value your life.&quot;</p><p>She lowers the hand she pointed at Lancer and points at me.</p><p>But I have objections as well!</p><hr><p>&quot;Don&#39;t be stupid. I told you I won&#39;t heed your warning. It&#39;s a guy&#39;s role to fight hand-to-hand. This is the second time I&#39;m fighting him, and I&#39;m more suited for it.&quot;</p><p>&quot;That can&#39;t be true! He&#39;s a foot soldier. How can I, the ranged attacker, run away from an enemy with no ranged weapons!?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;That&#39;s why! Can&#39;t you tell you&#39;ll die if he closes in on you!? You can just back me up from a distance!&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;You idiot! I can&#39;t back you up! I don&#39;t know any magecraft that&#39;s that precise! I bet I&#39;ll blow you away along with him!&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;――――! Don&#39;t come out with your destructive personality!</p><p>First of all, why do you always try to be flashy!? Try doing something modest for a change! I can understand Caster not wanting you now.&quot;</p><p>&quot;W-What――――!?&quot;</p><hr><p>...And we argue for a few minutes.</p><p>When we begin to tire and wonder how this got started...</p><p>I notice that Lancer is watching us with a smile.</p><hr><p>&quot;―――Oh, you&#39;re done? I&#39;m in no hurry, so finish it off. It&#39;s good to let out everything you have.&quot;</p><p>&quot;――――――――&quot;</p><p>&quot;――――――――&quot;</p><p>I cough and glare back at Lancer.</p><p>I take half a step forward, and Tohsaka is right behind me.</p><p>...Man, we should have done so from the start.</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh, hold on. I&#39;m sorry to say this after you&#39;ve reached a compromise, but I don&#39;t intend to fight. I was just unable to ignore you guys. I&#39;m butting in so that I can help you guys a bit.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Wh――――at?&quot;</p><p>Hold on.</p><p>What did he just say――――!?</p><hr><p>&quot;...Did I mishear you? I think I heard that you&#39;re helping us.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh, is it hard to understand my point? I guess I&#39;ll rephrase it. You two are no match for Caster. So I will lend you guys a hand.&quot;</p><p>&quot;――――――――&quot;</p><p>I&#39;m stunned.</p><p>But Tohsaka quickly grasps the situation.</p><hr><p>&quot;I see. You really are butting in. Is that really your idea?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;No, it&#39;s an order from my Master. He wants to cooperate against Caster since he&#39;s alone. Well, we&#39;re just making a quick alliance until we defeat Caster.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;That&#39;s a sound reason. But I think there&#39;s a more reliable guy to go talk to.&quot;</p><hr><p>...Is she talking about Shinji and Gilgamesh?</p><p>It seems Tohsaka is trying to figure out if Lancer knows about them――――</p><hr><p>&quot;No, they won&#39;t do. I don&#39;t want to ally with them.</p><p>I have no complaints about his power, but it&#39;s too troublesome to worry about my back when I&#39;m fighting.&quot;</p><p>&quot;...Oh. That&#39;s the correct choice, Lancer. Is that an order from your Master as well?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;That&#39;s wrong as well. I chose you two out of personal interest. You guys are easier to talk to since we&#39;re acquaintances, right?&quot;</p><p>He speaks plainly.</p><p>It seems that fighting Archer and driving his lance through my heart are the same as becoming acquaintances in his mind.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Hold on, Lancer. I was almost killed twice by you. And you think I&#39;m going to believe you?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;I do believe so. Your commander-in-chief is a good frank woman. Such a good woman is helping you out, so you must be good-natured as well, right?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Hm</p><p>&quot;</p><p>I frown.</p><p>...I&#39;m troubled that Tohsaka is nodding at our enemy&#39;s words.</p><hr><p>&quot;So that&#39;s it. That&#39;s why I thought we might be able to cooperate.</p><p>―――Oh, but let me tell you. It&#39;s not &#39;you guys&#39;. &#39;I&#39;m&#39; the one who thought that you guys would make good allies.&quot;</p><p>&quot;......?&quot;</p><p>I can&#39;t understand the difference.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Aren&#39;t you the cocky one? You brought on the proposal, but you&#39;re the one that&#39;s going to choose?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yeah. I&#39;ve liked you since the first time I saw you.</p><p>You&#39;re beautiful, stubborn, and courageous. If I&#39;m to have a female Master, I want someone like you.&quot;</p><hr><p>Lancer looks at Tohsaka with cool eyes.</p><p>&quot;...Humph.&quot;</p><p>...I don&#39;t like him for some reason.</p><hr><p>&quot;―――Fine. I&#39;m up for it. But it&#39;s not decided yet.</p><p>If Emiya-kun can&#39;t trust you, we have to break off negotiations.&quot;</p><p>&quot;So, that&#39;s what she&#39;s saying. What will you do, kid? Your character is being tested.&quot;</p><p>Lancer looks at me, trying to suppress his laughter.</p><hr><p>&quot;――――――――&quot;</p><p>My answer is―――</p><hr><h2 id="scene-06" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#scene-06" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Scene 06</h2><p>&quot;――――――――――――――――&quot;</p><p>I restrain my body that wants to go out.</p><p>I see Tohsaka biting her lips.</p><hr><p>...I know.</p><p>Tohsaka wants to stop him as well.</p><p>But we&#39;ll be the ones to be killed if we do so.</p><p>We can&#39;t stop him.</p><hr><p>The man&#39;s arm reaches out for the girl.</p><hr><p>&quot;――――, ――――, ――――&quot;</p><p>I can&#39;t breathe.</p><p>My feet are on fire from wanting to jump out.</p><p>My arms want to go over the terrace.</p><p>My body is shaking as if it broke down and it tries to go against my brain.</p><hr><p>―――It&#39;s as if I&#39;ve gone crazy.</p><hr><p>&quot;――――, ――――, ――――&quot;</p><p>I kill my voice and kill my mind.</p><p>I kill the girl below me as if to kill myself.</p><hr><p>&quot;――――――――&quot;</p><p>And it ends.</p><p>The man pulls something out of the girl with a smile.</p><p>A red object that looks like a poisonous fruit.</p><p>The thing in the man&#39;s hand is the girl&#39;s heart.</p><hr><p>&quot;――――――――&quot;</p><p>My mind burns down.</p><p>My brain that has gone white shakes with violent anger.</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh? I smelled something bad, but I see, there was a fool that has been watching this spectacle, huh?&quot;</p><p>With the girl&#39;s heart in his right hand...</p><p>&quot;How insolent of you. A mere lowlife should not look directly at me...!&quot;</p><p>He shoots off one of his numerous Noble Phantasms at me.</p><hr><h2 id="scene-07" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#scene-07" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Scene 07</h2><p>&quot;――――――――&quot;</p><p>...We have to accept his offer.</p><p>Even if he&#39;s an enemy, he&#39;s still right.</p><p>Tohsaka and I can&#39;t beat Caster.</p><p>But we might have a chance if Lancer&#39;s with us.</p><hr><p>&quot;......All right. I&#39;m also up for the alliance.&quot;</p><p>I turn off the Magic Circuit and relax.</p><p>―――That&#39;s the best sign of goodwill I can show him.</p><p>I won&#39;t be fighting him.</p><p>I&#39;m showing him that I&#39;ll be trusting him with my back if we&#39;re fighting together.</p><hr><p>&quot;―――I see, this is seriously bad. No wonder you&#39;re going through so much trouble, young lady.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh, you can tell? That&#39;s great. There&#39;s finally someone who understands. I was worried that things would stay like this to the very end.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;I feel for you. Still, he&#39;s not bad, as guys go.</p><p>You can be stupid and foolish when you&#39;re a kid.</p><p>You can learn stuff and get twisted after that.&quot;</p><hr><p>With that, Lancer walks to us.</p><p>His red lance isn&#39;t in his hand.</p><p>Lancer has let his guard down, just like I did.</p><hr><h2 id="scene-08" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#scene-08" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Scene 08</h2><p>&quot;――――――――&quot;</p><p>...We have to accept his offer.</p><p>Even if he&#39;s an enemy, he&#39;s still right.</p><p>Tohsaka and I can&#39;t beat Caster.</p><p>But we might have a chance if Lancer&#39;s with us.</p><p>But―――</p><hr><p>&quot;...All right.

You want me to tell you who my Master is?&quot;</p><p>&quot;No. Even though we&#39;re cooperating, stay away from Tohsaka.&quot;</p><hr><p>―――The air freezes.</p><p>Lancer is speechless, like he&#39;s been sucker-punched.</p><hr><p>&quot;Hah, I see, I see! Yeah, that&#39;s so much more important than who my Master is! You&#39;re right, kid!&quot;</p><p>He starts laughing heartily.</p><hr><p>&quot;Is that bad? I&#39;m telling you that you can&#39;t have Tohsaka.&quot;</p><p>&quot;That&#39;s not bad at all. Rather, I have a better opinion of you now.</p><p>Wow, that&#39;s great, young lady. This kid&#39;s completely fallen for you!&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;――――! W-W-W-What are you saying!? We&#39;re not like that! Um... yes, we&#39;re just cooperating...!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Reeeally?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...! You&#39;re irritating. What&#39;s with that know-it-all face...!?</p><p>Come on, say something, Shirou! Tell him we&#39;re just cooperating!&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;――――――――&quot;</p><p>..................</p><hr><p>&quot;Hey, say something, you idiot...!</p><p>T-This is as if we really do love each other...!&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Hey, it&#39;s not &#39;as if&#39;. You two are already in love. Even I can tell, and I&#39;m only watching it from the side. But she&#39;s actually denying it? This is troublesome, kid.&quot;</p><p>Lancer makes a sympathetic gesture.</p><hr><p>&quot;......Well. I already know Tohsaka&#39;s troublesome.&quot;</p><p>I dismiss his sympathy with a sour look.</p><hr><p>&quot;Wha-&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh, how reassuring. Then I shall take care when I socialize with her.</p><p>But she&#39;s fun to tease, so I&#39;m going to entertain myself while we&#39;re together. You don&#39;t mind that condition, right?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...All right. We&#39;ll go with that. We&#39;ll have your help until we beat Caster.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Then it&#39;s decided. Well, let&#39;s shake hands.&quot;</p><hr><p>Lancer walks to me unarmed and shakes my hand.</p><p>―――There are worrying factors, but we&#39;re able to obtain a reliable ally.</p><p>All that&#39;s left is...</p><hr><p>&quot;I&#39;m so mad!!!</p><p>Fine, I&#39;m breaking my ties with you guys!!!

I can&#39;t trust you.&quot;</p><p>It&#39;s not only Lancer.</p><p>I don&#39;t want to go along with Lancer&#39;s Master, who is still unknown.</p><hr><p>&quot;I see. Your partner is saying so, but what about you, young lady? You said you&#39;d go along with his choice.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;―――I won&#39;t take back my words. It&#39;s meaningless to cooperate with you if Emiya-kun can&#39;t trust you.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I see, you&#39;re right... This is disappointing. You really were my type.&quot;</p><hr><p>Lancer turns.</p><p>The blue figure does not look back and disappears in a flash.</p><hr><h2 id="scene-11" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#scene-11" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Scene 11</h2><p>We&#39;re back at my place.</p><p>I never thought I would make it back alive, so I relax once I get into the living room.</p><p>&quot;――――Whoa.&quot;</p><p>I feel a bit dizzy and lean against the wall.</p><hr><p>&quot;See. You can&#39;t even stand up, you idiot.&quot;</p><p>&quot;......Hm.&quot;</p><hr><p>...She&#39;s right, but I think her last comment was unnecessary.</p><p>How many times did she call me an idiot today? I bet she set a new record already.</p><hr><p>&quot;Come over here. We have to replace those bandages at the very least.&quot;</p><p>&quot;――――&quot;</p><p>I nod and move by Tohsaka.</p><hr><p>&quot;I can use this first aid kit, right? Oh, as expected from a house with a dojo.</p><p>It&#39;s rare to see a first aid kit with needles and threads along with scissors... Hey, come on. Take off your shirt and show me your wound.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Eh―――I have to take my clothes off? Oh, no, I can do it myself. I treated myself this morning, so it shouldn&#39;t be a problem.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...Come on. I don&#39;t know why you&#39;re so reserved, but who do you think treated that wound in the first place?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;――――Ugh. But that was, um...&quot;</p><p>I was unconscious and I was only causing trouble for Tohsaka at that time.</p><hr><p>&quot;Stop your whining and hurry up. Your wound is special, so we have to treat it right for it to heal up.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;......&quot;</p><p>How unfair.</p><p>I can&#39;t complain if she tells me with a face like that.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Okay, I&#39;ll leave it to you. To be honest, it&#39;s burning right now.&quot;</p><p>I give up and sit down.</p><p>Seeing that the shirt is stained with blood, Tohsaka gives up taking it off and starts cutting it right away. She then quickly but carefully takes off the bandages.</p><hr><p>&quot;――――――――&quot;</p><p>...Is it that bad? Tohsaka gasps when she sees it.</p><hr><p>&quot;......&quot;</p><p>...But I&#39;m troubled as well.</p><p>It&#39;s so embarrassing having her stare at my body so closely.</p><hr><p>&quot;You really did push yourself. It was healing up, but the wound opened up again.</p><p>...Geez, I can&#39;t get mad at you if I see a wound like this.&quot;</p><p>She talks like that, but gently touches the wound.</p><hr><p>&quot;――――――――&quot;</p><p>...Crap, I&#39;m getting dizzy for a different reason.</p><p>I was able to stay calm even if she was near me, but my heart&#39;s beating fast now and I&#39;m having trouble determining where to look.</p><hr><p>&quot;......Man.&quot;</p><p>I criticize myself mentally, but it does no good.</p><p>The temperature inside my head will keep increasing as long as we&#39;re like this.</p><p>Because the dizziness isn&#39;t caused by my wound.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Tohsaka? It&#39;s fine now, right? Just use styptic and roll up the bandage.&quot;</p><p>&quot;That&#39;s not called treating. ...I take it back. I&#39;m angry. You went outside with a hackjob like this?&quot;</p><hr><p>A slapping sound.</p><p>&quot;Gii......!&quot;</p><p>W-What was that for...!?</p><p>Tohsaka just slapped me on my wound!!</p><hr><p>&quot;Guh, you...! Do you have some grudge against me!?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Humph. You have no idea. You should thank me for going easy on you.&quot;</p><p>Saying so, Tohsaka takes out something that looks like ointment.</p><hr><p>&quot;That hurts, right? I healed the dead nerves, so it should hurt for a while. There&#39;s painkiller in this ointment, but it&#39;s mainly to replace your flesh.</p><p>It&#39;ll hurt until it familiarizes with your body, so don&#39;t do anything reckless until the pain goes away.&quot;</p><hr><p>She takes the jelly-like substance and applies it to my wound.</p><p>&quot;――――――――&quot;</p><p>It looks really suspicious, but I stay quiet since I know Tohsaka is seriously treating my wound.</p><hr><p>&quot;That&#39;s it. You should feel much better tomorrow if you wrap some bandages around it and get a good night&#39;s sleep.&quot;</p><hr><p>She skillfully wraps the bandages around the wound.</p><p>...I&#39;m not praising her or anything, but she does a much better job than I do.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Yeah. Um, thanks, Tohsaka. I feel much better.&quot;</p><p>I thank her while averting my gaze.</p><p>&quot;Eh―――w-well, that&#39;s good. I&#39;m glad I treated you if you say so.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Yeah, it&#39;s even more helpful because I thought it wouldn&#39;t heal up.</p><p>Thanks for treating the wound.&quot;</p><p>&quot;――――H-Heh. That&#39;s only natural. It&#39;ll heal as long as I treat it.&quot;</p><hr><p>Finishing the treatment, Tohsaka gets up.</p><p>...Then.</p><p>I don&#39;t know why, but she heads to the kitchen.</p><hr><p>&quot;Tohsaka?&quot;</p><p>Am I seeing things?</p><p>She&#39;s checking what&#39;s inside the refrigerator and the rice cooker.</p><hr><p>&quot;Hey, what are you doing?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I&#39;m preparing dinner. You haven&#39;t eaten yet, right? I haven&#39;t eaten either, so we&#39;re going to eat dinner.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...Yeah, I can tell. But why cook dinner in this situation?&quot;</p><p>&quot;It&#39;s natural, right? People can&#39;t come up with good ideas on an empty stomach.&quot;</p><hr><p>Tohsaka speaks while staring inside the refrigerator.</p><hr><p>The sound of our utensils echoes inside the room.</p><p>It&#39;s past ten o&#39;clock.</p><p>I don&#39;t know how it ended up like this, but Tohsaka and I are eating a late dinner together.</p><hr><p>By the way, the dinner was made by both of us.</p><p>Tohsaka wanted to eat Japanese food, but she didn&#39;t even know how to make miso soup.</p><p>It really makes me wonder what they&#39;re teaching in the cooking class at school.</p><hr><p>Tohsaka is concentrating on her meal.</p><p>She must be hungry, as her plate is almost empty.</p><hr><p>&quot;――――――――&quot;</p><p>But I don&#39;t have much of an appetite right now.</p><p>It&#39;s partly because this isn&#39;t the time to be eating, but more so because I haven&#39;t replied to Tohsaka.</p><hr><p>&#39;――――You can forfeit here, Shirou.&#39;</p><p>I haven&#39;t told her my reply to those words.</p><hr><p>&quot;――――Tohsaka. I have something to talk about.&quot;</p><p>I put my chopsticks down and stare at Tohsaka.</p><hr><p>&quot;What?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I&#39;ve been thinking. About my reason for joining this battle.</p><p>And what I wanted to do.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Yeah, and?&quot;</p><p>She urges me to go on as she sips on the miso soup.</p><p>...She&#39;s putting my spirit down, but I try to get myself together.</p><hr><p>&quot;At first, it was because I was dragged into this. And I wanted to do something about this war.</p><p>―――But it has nothing to do with how I became a Master or how I got dragged into this.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;――――――――&quot;</p><p>&quot;I like superheroes. That&#39;s why I have to protect everyone. I don&#39;t care about this Master thing. It makes no difference that I&#39;m not a Master or that I&#39;ve lost Saber.&quot;</p><hr><p>I say so, ready for Tohsaka&#39;s rebuttal.</p><p>...But...</p><p>&quot;Oh, I see.&quot;</p><p>She makes an absentminded response and finishes her rice.</p><hr><p>&quot;Hey now, Tohsaka. I&#39;m talking seriously, so―――&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;I am listening. You&#39;ll fight by yourself, right? The fact that people are dying bothers you more than the fact that you might die.</p><p>That&#39;s why you decided to fight no matter how weak you are.&quot;</p><hr><p>She looks straight at me.</p><p>It&#39;s as if she sees through the part of me that I don&#39;t even know about―――and most of all, she approves that I am fighting.</p><hr><p>&quot;Eh―――oh, yeah. That&#39;s right.&quot;</p><p>&quot;What&#39;s with that face? You look like a squirrel that has licked sugar.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Well. I thought you would object.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;I am. But I can&#39;t complain to you when you&#39;ve saved me like that.</p><p>...And I understand that you&#39;re like that no matter how much I try to stop you.&quot;</p><hr><p>Tohsaka averts her gaze a bit.</p><p>&quot;?&quot;</p><p>I don&#39;t know why, but――――</p><hr><p>&quot;Then we&#39;re still cooperating...!?&quot;</p><p>&quot;―――Yeah. I can&#39;t help it, so I&#39;ll go along with you. First of all, I&#39;ll be so worried that I won&#39;t be able to sleep soundly if I let you be by yourself. And...&quot;</p><p>She takes a huge breath.</p><p>After getting ready for some reason...</p><hr><p>&quot;To put it in your words, I don&#39;t hate you, Shirou.</p><p>...So it&#39;s fine if we stay together, right?&quot;</p><hr><p>She hands me the bowl with a red face.</p><p>How long did it take me to realize that she&#39;s asking for seconds?</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh―――of course...!

They would either call the police or pretend they hadn&#39;t seen it.</p><p>...It did not matter to her, as she could no longer move.</p><hr><p>That caused the last of her spirit to give out.</p><p>Her last moment was cold and lonely, just as it was at the end of her true lifetime.</p><p>―――Or so she thought.</p><hr><p>When she regained consciousness, she was in that place.</p><p>In front of her is that man――――the man who she met in the woods.</p><hr><p>&quot;So you&#39;ve awakened.

If you wish for me to forget about this, I shall do so.&quot;</p><p>...The tone of his voice never changed.</p><hr><p>...That was her first encounter with her Master, Kuzuki Souichirou.</p><p>Kuzuki was a strange man.</p><p>Should he be called a ghost?</p><p>He had no reason to live, but had no reason to die.</p><p>He was just there, and since he existed, he followed whatever whim took him.</p><hr><p>He has no self.</p><p>That was her first impression of him, and she thought it would be easy to turn him into a puppet.</p><p>―――She grew to realize that the thought was a mistake.</p><p>Kuzuki Souichirou does not have a past.</p><p>He has no self because he has no past, but it does not mean Kuzuki Souichirou is empty.</p><hr><p>Kuzuki was a sincere man.</p><p>He easily accepted her when she told him that she wanted him to be her Master and when she told him about her true identity.</p><hr><p>When she asked him, &quot;Do you believe such a story?&quot;</p><p>He replied, &quot;Was that a lie?&quot;</p><p>He accepted it after she told him it was the truth.</p><hr><p>And the most amazing part was the night they met.</p><p>As she was about to disappear, she told Kuzuki to lay with her.</p><p>After making a difficult expression...</p><p>&quot;Let me ask. Do you want it rough or gentle?&quot;</p><p>After that, he made love to her without waiting for her reply.</p><hr><p>To put it his way, they had sex before the Buddha.</p><p>It seemed rough like Asura, but it also seemed gentle like Bodhisattva.</p><p>...Either way, the contract was completed.</p><p>She obtained a new Master, was able to stay in this world, and returned to her role of being a witch.</p><hr><p>...She still considers it to be a miracle.</p><p>She would have disappeared before she woke up if she wasn&#39;t taken to the Ryuudou Temple.</p><p>The Ryuudou Temple is a demonic place for Servants, but it is a perfect summoning place once inside.</p><p>As the Ryuudou Temple is surrounded by a boundary field, it is suited for keeping anything inhuman.</p><hr><p>She was able to remain without disappearing because she was brought to the Ryuudou Temple. Had it been anyplace else, she would have vanished after being taken there.</p><p>As a result, she obtained the best ley line and the best protection.</p><p>She easily occupied the Ryuudou Temple, figured out the mechanism of the Holy Grail, and summoned Assassin as the fifth Servant.</p><hr><p>But such things are trivial matters.</p><p>She was certainly lucky on that night.</p><p>Many miracles saved her, and she is now on the verge of victory.</p><p>But they do not deserve thanks. She would have been fine with it even if those miracles had not occurred.</p><hr><p>―――There is only one important fact.</p><p>A very small matter that is trivial for anyone else.</p><p>For her, the fact that she was able to meet Kuzuki Souichirou is a miracle beyond belief.</p><hr><p>&quot;――――――――&quot;</p><p>But it&#39;s not going well.</p><p>No, she feels that everything she does is not going well.</p><hr><p>Her Master will not be delighted with what she did.</p><p>He has never had an interest in the Holy Grail.</p><p>She would do her best to grant any wish of his, but Kuzuki Souichirou has none.</p><hr><p>A one-sided relationship.</p><p>They do not get along well.</p><p>It is not going well at all.</p><hr><p>&quot;―――So the mummy hunter became the mummy? Even the rare witch is fragile, huh?&quot;</p><p>&quot;――――!&quot;</p><p>She turns to the intruder.</p><p>It is not her Master that is standing there.</p><p>It is the knight in red, Archer, with his true identity still unknown.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Archer. I thought I ordered you to keep watch outside.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yeah, but I didn&#39;t see any enemies around here. I got bored, so I came to check what was going on in here.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...Heh, I would assume so. The only enemy we have is Berserker. Even with him, we will go attack them ourselves once Saber is fully controlled. We have had nothing to fear since you joined us.</p><p>―――Isn&#39;t that why you came to my side?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Who knows. Don&#39;t you think I only wanted to break my contract with that Master? Don&#39;t you think I didn&#39;t care who my new Master was?&quot;</p><p>There is some truth in Archer&#39;s words.</p><p>...But what does it mean?</p><p>Archer had no intention of betraying, but betrayed his Master only because he wanted to break his contract with Tohsaka Rin?</p><hr><p>&quot;...I see. So you did not like looking after that little girl? Well, it is true that Servants are dissatisfied with their Masters. It is natural for you to run out of patience with yours.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;No, she was perfect as a summoner. But some miscalculations occurred.</p><p>And Caster, let me warn you. Do not consider all Servants to be like you.</p><p>At the very least, Saber and Berserker were satisfied with their Masters. A righteous hero can only be summoned by righteous people.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...Heh, why tell me that now? A twisted Master calls for twisted heroic spirits. You do not need to tell me that.&quot;</p><p>...That is right. Servants are determined by their summoners.</p><p>Summoners with dark shadows in their mind cannot summon heroic spirits who are on the light side.</p><hr><p>In that regard, she and Rider are not heroic spirits.</p><p>A twisted Master calls for twisted heroic spirits.</p><p>As Rider was &quot;one that was beautiful&quot;, she was also &quot;one that was pure&quot;.</p><p>It is ironic how the Servant Caster summoned is a fictional hero.</p><hr><p>&quot;But it is indeed strange once I think about it. You and Rider are ones that oppose the heroic spirits. But you two are still summoned as Servants.</p><p>...Well, the Holy Grail does not differentiate between good and evil. So I guess it will summon anyone with powers, huh?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;―――Originally, a mixed spirit that had a heroic side would not have been called upon.</p><p>Things went out of order starting with the third war. Heroic spirits like Rider and I were not summoned before that.&quot;</p><hr><p>...That does not concern her now.</p><p>She is not concerned about the true identity of the Holy Grail.</p><p>Servant Caster&#39;s mission is to win this war.</p><p>She is not interested in what comes after.</p><p>No, to be honest, that is not the end she wishes for.</p><hr><p>&quot;――――Enough with the meaningless talk.</p><p>Get back to your station. I don&#39;t care what you&#39;re thinking. You are my Servant now. Your life is in my hands. Put that into consideration when you talk to me.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Understood. Then I shall live up to my Master&#39;s expectation like an obedient Servant.&quot;</p><p>The knight in red goes up the stairs.</p><p>&quot;――――――――&quot;</p><p>Seeing him off silently, Caster lets out a long sigh.</p><hr><p>―――One more day until Saber surrenders.</p><p>She does not have the Holy Grail yet, but she will approach the end once Saber falls.</p><p>...What will happen when the war ends?</p><p>Caster will make every wish come true with her powers.</p><p>It is not bad to live as a witch, like she swore before dying.</p><hr><p>But―――the reason will go away once the war ends.</p><p>Even if she still has the will, her master will lose the reason to stay as her Master.</p><p>&quot;―――――I will obtain the Holy Grail soon.&quot;</p><p>Caster gracefully reaches out into empty space.</p><p>Her hard work is about to be rewarded, but her expression is like that of a criminal about to be executed.</p><hr><h2 id="scene-14" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#scene-14" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Scene 14</h2><p>―――I saw many corpses.</p><p>I died at that time and was reborn.</p><hr><p>I do not have any regrets.</p><p>My eyes lost hatred there.</p><p>My hands lost anger there.</p><p>My legs lost hope there.</p><p>My self lost its self there.</p><hr><p>Everything went away.</p><p>It is not because I gave up that I believed nothing would save me.</p><p>I just found out that it&#39;s natural.</p><p>It&#39;s just that dying people will die and survivors will survive.</p><p>I laid down on the rubble and stared at the burning field.</p><p>I understood everything then.</p><p>I thought I understood everything.</p><hr><p>――――But I still considered it...</p><p>How wonderful it would be...</p><p>If I was able to save everything here.</p><hr><p>That&#39;s what I admired.</p><p>I just wished nobody would have to suffer.</p><p>That&#39;s why I tried to become a superhero.</p><p>It was simple, and it seemed like an ideal existence.</p><hr><p>That was why I aimed for it.</p><p>I knew where I had to be, but there were many ways to get there.</p><p>I kept on running, wanting to get as close to it as possible, even though I did not know what was right or wrong.</p><hr><p>Many paths I took were crooked, and my destination was only getting farther away.</p><p>I&#39;m taking the long way.</p><p>I&#39;ve been repeating this for ten years since I got saved by Kiritsugu.</p><hr><p>But I won&#39;t regret it.</p><p>I&#39;m not as skillful as Tohsaka.</p><p>I will take the wrong path and lose a lot of things at times.</p><p>But I cannot discard them as meaningless.</p><p>I have to present meanings for everything I&#39;ve trampled upon and everything that cannot be returned.</p><hr><p>So I cannot lose.</p><p>It can&#39;t be helped if I lose against someone else.</p><p>But I can win against myself.

You know how there are a few people every year that get lost in there for going in without any preparations, right?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;――――――――&quot;</p><p>I nod silently.</p><p>Our destination is the Einzbern villa that is said to be somewhere in that forest.</p><p>Our fate will be sealed the instant our negotiations fail and we end up fighting.</p><p>We won&#39;t be able to call for help, and it will be difficult to run away.</p><p>We cannot escape that forest unless we defeat that giant―――Berserker.</p><hr><p>&quot;Then let&#39;s get going.</p><p>I stayed up all night figuring out where it could be, so we should be able to find it within half a day if we&#39;re lucky.</p><p>We&#39;ll take a cab as far as the highway, so get some money ready.&quot;</p><hr><p>She starts walking with a big bag in her hand.</p><hr><p>&quot;――――Hm.&quot;</p><p>I follow her with the usual shinai bag in mine.</p><p>...But Tohsaka.</p><p>Money for the cab is fine, but does that mean we&#39;ll be walking back on the way home?</p><hr><p>―――We rode the taxi for an hour from the town.</p><p>We drove on the highway, passed many mountains, and reached the entrance to the forest.</p><p>Of course, the forest does not have any paved roads.</p><p>We finally reach the entrance to the forest after walking about a kilometer from the highway.</p><hr><p>&quot;――――――――&quot;</p><p>I knew it wasn&#39;t going to be easy, but I get nervous once I actually face it.</p><p>The forest is dark even though it&#39;s daytime.</p><p>The tall branches block off the sunlight, and it&#39;s hard to see more than a few meters ahead, let alone to the end.</p><hr><p>&quot;Shirou. Can you walk ahead for a bit?&quot;</p><p>&quot;...? Fine, but you&#39;re the one who knows where she could be, right? I think it&#39;ll do no good if I go ahead.&quot;</p><p>I complain as I enter the forest.</p><p>―――Then.</p><hr><p>&quot;――――What was that!? I felt a shock...!&quot;</p><p>I pull back my foot.</p><p>I only felt the shock for an instant.</p><p>It&#39;s not that strong, so it&#39;d hurt more if I hit my foot on the corner of a dresser.</p><p>...Well, in short, it was like static electricity.</p><hr><p>&quot;―――I thought so. I&#39;m sure it&#39;s only for identification, but it seems she has the whole forest under her surveillance.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Eh―――hold on. Isn&#39;t that bad?</p><p>That means we got caught in an alarm, right?</p><p>Then――――&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;I don&#39;t think it&#39;ll be a problem. We didn&#39;t come here for a surprise attack. We came to talk, so it would be in our favor to let them know we&#39;re coming.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh. Be careful though. It&#39;ll shock you a bit.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I know, I know. I can tell how bad it is by looking at you――――&quot;</p><p>She waves her hand and steps into the forest.</p><p>Then.</p><hr><p>&quot;UKYAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!&quot;</p><p>Tohsaka jumps back with a funny scream.</p><hr><p>&quot;Wow...&quot;</p><p>I hear fire hissing.</p><p>I want to believe it&#39;s my imagination that the leaves under Tohsaka&#39;s feet are scorched.</p><hr><p>&quot;...I guess there&#39;s personal differences on the alarm. It was light in my case.&quot;</p><p>I calmly analyze the situation.</p><p>&quot;Kuh――――kuku, kukuku――――&quot;</p><p>But it doesn&#39;t seem like Tohsaka is listening to me.</p><hr><p>&quot;That does it, kid...! I heard you laughing...!&quot;</p><hr><p>Tohsaka yells into the empty sky.</p><p>She&#39;s so angry that she might go to fight instead of talk.</p><hr><p>...Well, anyway.</p><p>It seems talking bad about Tohsaka is fatal no matter how far away you are from her, so I guess I&#39;ll refrain from doing so.</p><hr><h2 id="scene-15" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#scene-15" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Scene 15</h2><p>My frozen body bursts.</p><p>My feet lift me up and my arms grab the railing at the same time.</p><p>I see Tohsaka as I do so.</p><p>She is biting her lips in anger while watching the tragedy below us.</p><hr><p>...I know.</p><p>Tohsaka wants to stop him as well.</p><p>But we&#39;ll be the ones to be killed if we do so.

So you do know who&#39;s the most powerful here.&quot;</p><p>&quot;――――――――&quot;</p><p>I gasp.</p><p>It&#39;s not because of what he said. It&#39;s unexpected that he is saying so from the bottom of his heart.</p><hr><p>&quot;That&#39;s right. So you know, right, Emiya? You&#39;ll die now.&quot;</p><hr><p>...How out-of-place.</p><p>Why say something that&#39;s so obvious?</p><hr><p>&quot;Sorry I didn&#39;t introduce him to you yet, but he&#39;s my new Servant.

Fine, then you can die.&quot;</p><p>Shinji jumps back.</p><hr><p>The man, still with a cold expression, finally brings his sword do――――</p><p>&quot;Hold on. I won&#39;t guarantee your Master&#39;s life if you move an inch.&quot;</p><p>――――And the man stops his sword once again.</p><hr><p>Everyone looks up.</p><p>Everyone down in the hall turns his attention to the girl on the terrace.</p><hr><p>Tohsaka&#39;s hand is aimed at Shinji.</p><p>Even though Shinji is not a magus, he should know what that means.</p><p>Tohsaka&#39;s serious.</p><p>If the man brings down his sword, she will kill Shinji as retaliation.</p><hr><p>&quot;T-Tohsaka...!

The right to kill and be killed are the same. You should know that with your human instincts even if you&#39;re not a magus.&quot;</p><p>&quot;――――!&quot;</p><p>Shinji retreats weakly, being stared down by Tohsaka.</p><hr><p>And...</p><p>&quot;――――Hm.&quot;</p><p>...The man just watches it in delight.</p><hr><p>He looks at Tohsaka.</p><p>&quot;......?&quot;</p><p>...Then.</p><p>I think there was a strange shaking for an instant.</p><hr><p>&quot;I see. You know you will not be able to kill me, so you went after the Master instead. You brought on the negotiation because you know I would not stop even if you killed my Master.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...That&#39;s right. You wouldn&#39;t stop even if I killed Shinji. But you can consider it in this situation, right?</p><p>You can save Shinji right now. If you&#39;re a Servant, it should be a hard blow for you to lose your Master.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Hah. I see, you are pretty clever. That is your only option if you want to save that scum.&quot;</p><p>His sword disappears.</p><p>He turns his back to me as if he&#39;s lost interest.</p><hr><p>&quot;...! What are you doing!? Who told you to stop...!?&quot;</p><p>&quot;No―――the situation has changed, Shinji. She will be perfect as the vessel.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Huh――――?&quot;</p><hr><p>Shinji stops breathing.</p><p>His face filled with irritation suddenly turns into a dirty smile.</p><p>&quot;I see―――wow, I&#39;m glad you&#39;re still alive, Tohsaka.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;I see. I&#39;m relieved as well. I&#39;ve known you for a long time even though you&#39;re like that. It&#39;d be discouraging to have you dead already.&quot;</p><hr><p>Laughing, Shinji claps his hands.</p><p>...It&#39;s so strange.</p><p>Shinji shows no fear even though Tohsaka can end his life.</p><p>It seems an overwhelming joy is numbing his emotions.</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh well. With that aside, how about it, Tohsaka? Do you want to forget about Emiya and team up with us?&quot;</p><p>&quot;―――&#39;Us&#39;?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;That&#39;s right. You should know that Caster is stocking up power. The Ryuudou Temple is the altar this time. It&#39;s a bit unfavorable for us if she&#39;s taking position there and stocking up magical energy.&quot;</p><hr><p>Shinji says this with both his hands raised.</p><p>That&#39;s an obvious fact.</p><p>If I have to add, it seems Shinji doesn&#39;t know Caster obtained Saber and Archer.</p><hr><p>&quot;You can tell, right? There&#39;s not much chance of victory by myself.</p><p>I beat Berserker&#39;s Master, but this isn&#39;t enough. We can make one that will even beat Caster if you join us.&quot;</p><p>Shinji invites her with confidence.</p><p>To that...</p><hr><p>&quot;I refuse, Shinji. I don&#39;t know who you&#39;re connected with, but there&#39;s no way I would follow a guy that is being used.&quot;</p><p>Tohsaka refuses him without twitching a brow.</p><hr><p>&quot;W――――What...?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Can&#39;t you tell? I&#39;m warning you since I&#39;ve known you for a long time. You should get some intelligence to observe what&#39;s going on around you.</p><p>You&#39;re the only one who considers Matou Shinji to be a Master. Don&#39;t you realize by now that you don&#39;t have talent as a magus?&quot;</p><p>&quot;You――――――!&quot;</p><hr><p>Shinji&#39;s face stiffens up.</p><p>The harsh words must have caused him to forget that his life is in Tohsaka&#39;s hands.</p><p>&quot;Do it, Gilgamesh! Kill Emiya and Tohsaka...!&quot;</p><p>Shinji orders his Servant.</p><hr><p>&quot;――――――――&quot;</p><p>&quot;W-What, I told you to kill them...! It should be easy for you to kill them before I get killed...!&quot;</p><p>&quot;―――No, this is too bad, but we are out of time.

I stopped him because I just wanted to save her.&quot;</p><p>There&#39;s no other way to explain it.</p><p>After glaring at me...</p><hr><p>&quot;...I see. I thought you were abnormal before, but I&#39;m sure now.</p><p>Shirou. Your way of life is really distorted.&quot;[l]</p><p>...She tries to open a lid that I&#39;ve kept closed for so long.</p><hr><p>&quot;Distorted...?&quot;</p><p>&quot;That&#39;s right. It&#39;s wrong to live thinking that others are more important than you.</p><p>Look, I&#39;m not talking about the common opinion that we save others so we can be loved.</p><p>With such hypocrisy aside, we have to put ourselves first.</p><hr><p>Well, there are people with others as their priority.</p><p>But you&#39;re something &#39;special&#39; that you can&#39;t put on the scale. It&#39;s like the scale itself. So why do you try to destroy that scale to save someone you don&#39;t even know?</p><hr><p>...Yes, if you truly were a person who was merely alive, such self-denial would be fine.</p><p>But you can&#39;t do that.</p><p>You can&#39;t pretend you are not living for yourself when you have such a strong sense of personal conviction and self-awareness.</p><p>―――If you continue something like this, you&#39;ll eventually break down.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;――――――――&quot;</p><p>No way.</p><p>I can&#39;t break down.</p><p>I&#39;m doing this so that I won&#39;t break down.</p><p>I&#39;m trying to save people that I could not save so that I can hold my head high――――</p><hr><p>&quot;No. You&#39;re broken already.</p><p>...So tell me. I don&#39;t know what happened to you ten years ago, but that must be why you&#39;re so screwed up...!&quot;</p><hr><p>Tohsaka looks like she&#39;s crying.</p><p>Why does she have to make a face like that?</p><p>It&#39;s as if...</p><p>...She knows I&#39;ll live a thankless life, so she&#39;s trying to stop me.</p><hr><p>&quot;...You were like this at school. You were so calm in front of all those bodies. ...Even I mistook them for corpses, but you knew right away that they were alive.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;I always thought that it was strange.</p><p>You never had proper training as a magus, but you got calm every time you got into a fight to the death.</p><p>You would get enraged by seeing corpses, but you didn&#39;t feel any shock or disgust.</p><p>It&#39;s probably because―――corpses are something you got used to seeing. You saw something gruesome ten years ago, right?&quot;</p><hr><p>I got used to seeing them...?</p><p>Well, it&#39;s true that it wasn&#39;t my first time seeing a corpse.</p><p>The students at school, Rider who got her neck twisted off, and even this girl sleeping in front of me now... I think they&#39;ve died a natural death compared to that time.</p><hr><p>&quot;――――――――&quot;</p><p>But she&#39;s wrong.</p><p>The fire ten years ago saved Emiya Shirou.</p><p>That cannot be the main reason why Tohsaka is criticising me now.</p><hr><p>&quot;That&#39;s wrong, Tohsaka. I was saved, that&#39;s all.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;&#39;Saved&#39;...? So you were saved from the fire ten years ago? And that was by Emiya Kiritsugu?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Yes. But that&#39;s it. That isn&#39;t the reason for anything.&quot;</p><p>My heart aches when I answer.</p><p>My body is telling me that it&#39;s a lie.</p><hr><p>&quot;Then was there something else? Something you&#39;re always regretting or something Emiya Kiritsugu took from you as compensation for saving you?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;―――There&#39;s no such thing. Kiritsugu merely saved me. And you talk about taking something from me, but at that time...&quot;</p><p>...I had nothing to give.</p><hr><p>―――I saw many corpses.</p><p>I died at that time and was reborn.</p><hr><p>――――I do not have any regrets.</p><p>My eyes lost hatred there.</p><p>My hands lost anger there.</p><p>My legs lost hope there.</p><p>My self lost its self there.</p><p>...So why?</p><p>Why do I have this self-consciousness that Tohsaka speaks of?</p><hr><p>&quot;――――――――, That&#39;s...&quot;</p><p>I have accepted death.</p><p>I knew I was going to die.</p><p>Even if my body was saved in that situation, there&#39;s no way my mind could have been saved as well.</p><hr><p>At that time...</p><p>I was empty, and I just admired something sacred...</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh――――that&#39;s... right.&quot;</p><p>I remember now.</p><p>No, I didn&#39;t even put it into my memory.</p><p>So I didn&#39;t realize until now that it&#39;s what really saved me.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Shirou? Did he make you establish a contract or something?&quot;</p><p>&quot;No. He didn&#39;t take anything away. I only received.&quot;</p><hr><p>A world like hell.</p><p>In the place where everyone but me died, I was saved.</p><p>Nobody saved me, and I wasn&#39;t able to save anybody.</p><p>And at the very end, he granted something that I thought was a miracle.</p><hr><p>&quot;―――I remember. Those eyes that looked down at me and the voice pleading for me to live.</p><p>At that time, I thought not about the fact that I was saved, but the fact that someone&#39;s there to save me... The fact itself is...&quot;</p><hr><p>It&#39;s so wonderful, and it&#39;s such a miraculous thing.</p><p>That&#39;s why I admired it.</p><p>I had nothing, and there was nothing remaining in me, I admired the first thing that came into my sight.</p><hr><p>&quot;So I――――&quot;</p><hr><p>―――That&#39;s the only thing I had.</p><p>That&#39;s the only emotion I felt after I was saved.</p><p>I was happy.</p><p>I cried.</p><p>That&#39;s all I could think about.</p><p>So――that&#39;s all the emotion I could create――</p><hr><p>&quot;――――Yeah. You&#39;re probably right.&quot;</p><p>It&#39;s distorted for me to put priority on others before me.</p><p>There is something seriously wrong with the procedure.</p><hr><p>&quot;But I was the only one who got saved. I thought about it at that time.</p><p>―――That if such a thing happened again, I would save everyone in place of all those I could not save then.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;I&#39;m telling you that&#39;s crazy...!</p><p>Look, if you were saved, take care of yourself! I&#39;m sorry for the people who got killed, but it&#39;s only by chance that you were saved!</p><p>Then you should take full advantage of your good fortune. You suffered such a hell, so it&#39;ll be a waste if you don&#39;t have fun!&quot;</p><hr><p>Tohsaka is seriously angry.</p><p>&quot;――――――――&quot;</p><p>Yeah, that makes me happy.</p><p>I finally realize now, because Tohsaka is that kind of person.</p><hr><p>The question I&#39;ve been wondering about all by myself.</p><p>I wanted to be a superhero, and I always tried to help others.</p><p>I knew there was something wrong with the method, but I did not understand what.</p><hr><p>―――But it&#39;s so clear now.</p><p>It&#39;s because of this person that is seriously angry for my sake.</p><hr><p>&quot;W-What? You still don&#39;t understand after I&#39;ve told you this much?</p><p>You really make me mad. If you&#39;re really that stupid, I&#39;ll break my allian――――&quot;</p><p>&quot;I know. I told you you&#39;re right, didn&#39;t I?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Then――――&quot;</p><p>&quot;But I can&#39;t listen to your warning.</p><p>I realize there&#39;s something wrong with me. But it&#39;s all right.</p><p>Because there&#39;s no way that wanting to help people can be a mistake.&quot;</p><hr><p>So...</p><p>I answer her with as much gratitude as I can possibly put in.</p><hr><p>&quot;――――――!</p><p>...Geez, I can&#39;t say anything if you make a face like that.&quot;</p><p>Maybe it got awkward, as Tohsaka turns and walks away.</p><hr><p>And then...</p><p>&quot;―――Well, I guess it can&#39;t be helped. I guess I&#39;ll do something about it.&quot;</p><p>She sighs as she says this.</p><hr><h2 id="scene-19" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#scene-19" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Scene 19</h2><p>The sun sets and the hall is filled with darkness.</p><p>...We came here to look for an ally, but the only thing remaining here after turns of events is this empty castle.</p><hr><p>&quot;So, what will we do?

If we fix the walls, we can probably manage to protect ourselves inside the castle.</p><hr><p>&quot;――――――――&quot;</p><p>That&#39;s the best thing we can do if we want to protect ourselves.</p><p>But we chose the path to &quot;fight&quot; because we couldn&#39;t do so.</p><hr><p>&quot;...No, it&#39;s meaningless even if we fortify.</p><p>Any defense will be penetrated once Caster completely controls Saber.</p><p>...And even if we do survive here, it doesn&#39;t matter if Caster obtains the Holy Grail.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Not only us, but the people in town will suffer as well.</p><p>...Then there&#39;s only one thing to do.

I know your personality. I knew you would be back with some sort of a plan.&quot;</p><p>He stares at her with cool eyes.</p><hr><p>&quot;I&#39;m sorry, Archer. I can&#39;t live up to your expectations.</p><p>We have nothing to start out with.

Caster and Emiya Shirou. The scales tipped to Caster, huh?&quot;</p><p>Archer&#39;s question is a loaded one.</p><hr><p>&quot;Yes. I hate my own personality, but I guess I can&#39;t change it since I&#39;m born with it. I&#39;m inhuman at the very end.&quot;</p><p>Saying so with an emotionless voice, Tohsaka steps forward.</p><hr><p>&quot;―――Shirou. Archer will only attack you. I won&#39;t back you up. I&#39;ll try to fight Caster while you get killed.&quot;</p><p>Tohsaka apologizes with her back turned...</p><p>Confessing that she intended to use me as a sacrifice from the start.</p><hr><p>&quot;――――――――&quot;</p><p>How stupid of her.</p><p>She didn&#39;t have to say such a thing.</p><hr><p>&quot;Don&#39;t worry about it, you idiot.

You have your own Master, right? Then you should stay quiet.</p><p>We&#39;re going to be enemies after we beat Caster, so it does no good to be talking. Anything other than planning is unnecessary.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;What, we can&#39;t talk because we&#39;re going to be enemies? You have less composure than you look like you have, huh?

If we don&#39;t think things all the way through, it&#39;s rude to the other party.&quot;</p><p>&quot;...Wow. It sure became a boring world.&quot;</p><hr><p>...Lancer does not learn his lesson.</p><p>I think they&#39;ve been repeating the same kind of conversation for a while now.</p><hr><p>&quot;More importantly, Lancer. You know what your role is, right?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Huh? Yeah, leave it to me. You two are going to fight Caster and her Master, right?</p><p>My role is to fight Archer.</p><p>I&#39;ll have to fight Saber as well in the worst case, but it won&#39;t be a problem if all I have to do is keep them busy.&quot;</p><hr><p>He speaks objectively.</p><p>He isn&#39;t even scared of fighting Saber and Archer at the same time.</p><hr><p>&quot;――――――――&quot;</p><p>Oh yeah, Saber commented on him when we were training in the dojo.</p><p>She said Lancer is the best when it comes to &quot;surviving&quot;.</p><hr><p>She praised him, saying that with his excellent agility and great experience, Lancer would be an impregnable wall if he went into defense.</p><p>...He must have fought many battles from disadvantageous positions when he was alive.</p><p>This man ran through fatal battles like a panther and lived on.</p><hr><p>&quot;...That&#39;s fine. But our enemy isn&#39;t just Archer and Saber. Caster also has Assassin. In the worst case, you&#39;d have to fight three.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh, that&#39;s bad. I don&#39;t like that guy. I don&#39;t even want to fight him one-on-one if I can help it. It&#39;s best to kill such a guy from a distance―――but there&#39;s no point in worrying.</p><p>Assassin won&#39;t be at the church.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...? How can you say so? If Caster won&#39;t go back to the Ryuudou Temple, wouldn&#39;t she call for her guard, Assassin?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;No. Assassin is a Servant that Caster summoned, but he has his limitations because of that. He is a heroic spirit summoned to that place. He can&#39;t leave the Ryuudou Temple, and in any case, Caster won&#39;t call for him.</p><p>He is a Servant that Caster summoned without letting her Master know.</p><p>She will try to hide Assassin as long as they&#39;re at the church, and I&#39;m sure she won&#39;t let go of the Ryuudou Temple either.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;She won&#39;t let go of the Ryuudou Temple...? Does that mean...&quot;</p><p>&quot;It&#39;s because that mountain is the summoning place of the Holy Grail. Do you know? This is the fifth Holy Grail War, but there are only four possible places for the Holy Grail to be summoned into. Two of the places are the Ryuudou Temple and the church.</p><p>By the way, it was summoned at the church in the third war. The fourth one was summoned in a plain somewhere.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;―――Oh. I thought you didn&#39;t think at all, but you&#39;re pretty well-informed.&quot;</p><p>&quot;It&#39;s just that my Master is fastidious.

Don&#39;t talk about the 24th one!</p><p>I have no business with a weakling that will die that way!</p><p>O-Osu!</p><p>I don&#39;t quite get it, but this is the last Tiger Dojo of part II!?</p><p>Yup.</p><p>There was a rumor on part I&#39;s final Tiger Dojo that this corner would be powered up, but I won&#39;t fall for something like that this time.</p><p>We will remain here alone and preserve this modest paradise.</p><p>.........Heh.</p><p>Ugh, I feel something rebellious.</p><p>Could this devil child be plotting something again?</p><p>Oh, that&#39;s a misunderstanding.</p><p>I&#39;m just thinking that I might make you feel lonely because I can&#39;t be here often during part III.</p><p>Hm...!? You can&#39;t come to the dojo!? Could it be, Illya-chan...!?</p><p>Yup. I&#39;ll be busy taking part in the main storyline.</p><p>It ended up like this in the Rin route, but part III is when my true worth comes out.</p><p>It seems you will be taking fewer parts in the main story.</p><p>My condolences to you. This is the difference between a heroine candidate and one who was not even considered to be a candidate.</p><p>Well, you can rest assured that I&#39;ll still be your friend even after I become a heroine. Let&#39;s see... When I take over the storyline, I can make you my servant...</p><p>......Hiya.</p><p>What are you doing!? I&#39;m saying this out of good faith!</p><p>I don&#39;t need it! I don&#39;t need love if it&#39;s this painful!</p><p>Actually, you&#39;re disqualified to be my student! You will be too bright in my eyes if you become a heroine!</p><p>Get out! Get out-uwaaan!</p><p>Heh, I&#39;m quitting as well!</p><p>You stupid Taiga! I won&#39;t forgive you even if you apologize!</p><p>...She&#39;s gone.</p><p>Well, this is fate. If my cute student will become a heroine, it is my role as her master to be hated.</p><p>Fight, Illya-chan! Go after Sakura-chan and take her spot as the heroine!</p><p>Don&#39;t come back here! Because you&#39;ll take away some of my roles!</p><p>...Uhh. But it&#39;s kind of lonely that I have to do the last Tiger Dojo of part II by myself.</p><p>I&#39;m lonely, but I&#39;ll do my best. Fight alone, me.</p><p>Well, this dead end is a bit special.</p><p>It&#39;s too reckless to enter battle with just Shirou and Tohsaka-san. There&#39;s no way you can win.</p><p>I know you might have something against him, but go ahead and shake hands with the &quot;cooperator&quot; that appeared.</p><p>For those of you for whom the cooperator didn&#39;t even appear!</p><p>You&#39;re a failure as a main character! How can you not save a girl that&#39;s about to die in front of you!?</p><p>The event at the castle is an important part of the story that reveals &quot;a cause&quot; that has been hidden up to now! You have to see it.</p><p>Tohsaka-san&#39;s route is also the main character&#39;s route. So go ahead and solve the problem.</p><p>―――Well, this is it.</p><p>Tohsaka-san&#39;s route is entering its climax.</p><p>There will be a series of fast events without a dead end after this, but let me give you one piece of good news.</p><p>Tohsaka-san&#39;s route has a &quot;true end&quot; and a &quot;good end&quot;.</p><p>I can&#39;t tell what each of those is about, but the condition for seeing them is how faithful you were. It&#39;s either &quot;only one&quot; or &quot;flowers on both hands&quot;. You get to find out after the battle.</p><p>All right, everyone, I&#39;ll be waiting in the part III Tiger Dojo.</p></div><!--[--><!--]--></div><footer class="page-meta"><div class="meta-item edit-link"><a class="external-link meta-item-label" href="https://github.com/r-grandorder/tri-hermes/edit/main/src/Novels/FSN/UBW/Day13.md" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" aria-label="Help us improve this page!"><!--[--><!--]--> Help us improve this page! <span><svg class="external-link-icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewbox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path><polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg><span class="external-link-icon-sr-only">open in new window</span></span><!--[--><!--]--></a></div><div class="meta-item last-updated"><span class="meta-item-label">Last Updated: </span><!----></div><div class="meta-item contributors"><span class="meta-item-label">Contributors: </span><span class="meta-item-info"><!--[--><!--[--><span class="contributor" title="email: 59034871+Fgrandorder@users.noreply.github.com">Lib</span><!----><!--]--><!--]--></span></div></footer><!----><!--[--><!--]--></main><!--]--></div><!----><!--]--></div>
