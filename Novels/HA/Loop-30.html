usual.</p><hr><p>“Hey, Rider, I...”</p><p>“..................”</p><hr><p>Oh, great timing.</p><p>Are you free right now? ...Just as I&#39;m about to ask her that,</p><hr><p>“Huh...?”</p><p>As if she has something to do, she walks by rapidly.</p><p>Oh well, so much for that. Maybe I&#39;ll just drink some tea by myself.</p><hr><p>“Yes... it&#39;s about today&#39;s appointment... no.”</p><hr><p>...I&#39;ve run into Rider again.</p><p>I&#39;ll make some tea for her too, just in case.</p><p>Since the teapot&#39;s still full of hot water, I quickly brew some roasted green tea.</p><hr><p>“Yes, is there an opening this afternoon?</p><p>As to the stylist... yes, please tell her I am in her debt.</p><p>Then, 3 o&#39;clock it is. Thank you.”</p><hr><p>Stylist?</p><p>...I bring the tea into the living room and offer some to Rider.</p><hr><p>“Rider, were you on the phone?”</p><p>“Yes. With the beauty salon.”</p><hr><p>“――――――”</p><p>I&#39;m not sure what I&#39;m so surprised about, but the revelation does drive me into a temporary stupor.</p><p>...Well, Rider is a woman in her prime, after all; it&#39;s no surprise she&#39;d go to a salon, but... for a beauty like her to go to the same place in Miyama frequented by Homurabara students...?</p><hr><p>“Salon? You mean the one in Miyama?”</p><p>“Yes. The length of my hair makes it very difficult for me to care for it by myself.</p><p>I get it done about twice a week.”</p><hr><p>“..................”</p><p>...Rider&#39;s hair...</p><p>Now that I think about it, I suddenly feel like touching her ever waving, smooth strands of hair.</p><p>...It would be so nice to run my hands through them, just once... No, down, boy. That&#39;s a good way to get yourself killed.</p><hr><p>“Mmm? So your hair grows?”</p><p>“No, but it does become disheveled... And...”</p><hr><p>Rider sips at her tea.</p><hr><p>“When I turn back into my physical form, my hair goes back to its original state.”</p><p>“Then, I guess you just need to――”</p><hr><p>“I do not wish to bother Sakura with something as trivial as hair.</p><p>...So, even if it is truly bothersome, I must take care of my hair myself.</p><p>Frankly, having it disorganized also puts me in a bad mood.”</p><hr><p>“It sounds like a problem in more ways than one. Being a woman, that is.”</p><p>“Thank you for your concern, Shirou.</p><p>However, I would like you to put Sakura&#39;s well-being ahead of mine. I am merely her Servant and nothing more.”</p><hr><p>“Sakura is happy to have your attention.</p><p>And I am happy to see you two together.”</p><p>“Uh... I-I see... I&#39;ll do my best.”</p><hr><p>“Yes... I realize it may be even harder than fighting in a battle, but please try your best... On a trivial side note, that is the side of you that I enjoy watching myself, as well.”</p><p>“Uh.”</p><p>Something scary hits me.</p><hr><p>“U-Um, I&#39;ll take that as extra consideration towards Sakura.</p><p>What about Tohsaka? I wonder if she also visits a salon?”</p><p>“I believe it would be rather unnecessary for her.”</p><p>That was quick.</p><hr><p>“...Please don&#39;t take it the wrong way.</p><p>Rin is the type of person who does not like to have her effort seen. Having her beauty-related issues exposed to you, Shirou, would certainly hurt her pride.”</p><p>“Aaah... I see.”</p><p>A swan&#39;s feet... is what they say.</p><p>As for the remaining members of the women&#39;s squad――</p><hr><p>“Then what about Saber?”</p><p>“That&#39;s difficult. If I were to go tell her, a fight would surely ensue, but she would probably be a lot more open to the suggestion coming from you.”</p><p>It is indeed quite difficult to predict how it would unfold.</p><p>She&#39;ll probably say something like... &quot;I like this hairstyle,&quot; or, possibly, &quot;Other hairstyles do not fit me.&quot;</p><hr><p>“Then how about Fuji-Nee...? Haha.”</p><p>Really, what would it be like?</p><p>“She might enjoy it.”</p><p>“Huh?”</p><hr><p>“She might actually enjoy it.</p><p>She does not appear to be the kind of person to use much makeup, but she does not seem to dislike it, either.</p><p>If you wanted to go to the hair salon, I think she would tag along without hesitation.”</p><hr><p>“............”</p><p>Wait.</p><p>Doesn&#39;t that imply that I would be the one going for a makeover, and not Fuji-Nee?</p><hr><p>“Let&#39;s... end our suppositions here.</p><p>So, Rider, what will you do now?”</p><p>“Due to other appointments, the salon will be only be available in the afternoon. I&#39;ll be staying here, idling away until then.”</p><p>And so she proceeds to set camp in front of the TV.</p><hr><p>“Although... I am not particularly fond of it.”</p><p>She says softly.</p><p>“Wuh?”</p><p>She doesn&#39;t like the beauty salon?</p><hr><p>“Why&#39;s that? It looks like you&#39;re used to going there.”</p><p>“...Yes, but... there are mirrors there.”</p><p>“Ah.”</p><p>There are indeed a lot of mirrors in a hair salon.</p><p>Rider&#39;s true name is Medusa. Her tale includes a defeat with a mirror-like shield.</p><hr><p>“...The legendary shield of mirror, is it?</p><p>The one that is said to have reflected the petrifying glare.”</p><p>According to the Greek mythology, Medusa had her Mystic Eyes blocked by Perseus&#39; shield, and was defeated by having her head cut off, or something like that.</p><p>...?</p><p>Speaking of which...</p><hr><p>“Rider, don&#39;t you take off your glasses when you get your hair cut?</p><p>Meaning, you would be looking in the mirror... and wouldn&#39;t you be petrified?”</p><p>“No. I do not get petrified simply by looking in a mirror.</p><p>That man relied on the reflection to fight me, to avoid looking directly in my eyes.”</p><hr><p>“Ah, I see.”</p><p>Perseus&#39; shield did not reflect the Mystic Eyes.</p><p>He merely made them ineffective by avoiding eye contact.</p><hr><p>“Huh...? Then why do you find mirrors loathsome?</p><p>You weren&#39;t specifically beaten by a mirror. I can understand you might sometimes avoid them, but disliking them? Isn&#39;t that a bit much?”</p><p>“...Well, that&#39;s not necessarily true, either.</p><p>Although the goddess&#39; shield could not seal my Mystic Eyes, the thing that defeated me definitely was the &quot;mirror.&quot;”</p><hr><p>“???”</p><p>It&#39;s a mystery.</p><p>It looks like there are some plot holes in the mythology regarding Medusa.</p><hr><p>“..................Would you like to hear the story, Shirou?”</p><p>“Eh? Ah, no... it does sound interesting, but...”</p><p>“Do you insist on it?”</p><p>“No, if you ask that way, then―――”</p><hr><p>After all, it&#39;s a story concerning Medusa&#39;s... no, Rider&#39;s fall...</p><p>I feel as if I shouldn&#39;t insist on it...</p><p>“...Ah, no.</p><p>But I&#39;ll definitely listen if you&#39;re up for it.”</p><hr><p>“Understood.</p><p>I prefer not to reminisce about such things, but if you want to hear about it, then I will tell you.</p><p>It goes back to when this body matured into a monster.</p><p>A story of the last days of a monster that is different from the current me―――”</p><hr><p>The peaceful morning air somehow feels a lot more ominous and oppressive.</p><p>I&#39;m not sure if she is enjoying my frightened reaction, or if it&#39;s just a foreshadowing technique.</p><p>Rider quietly begins the story of her past self&#39;s final moments.</p><hr><p>&quot;―――...If that is so...</p><p>Then I shall bring back the head of the legendary monster, Gorgon―――&quot;</p><hr><p>The soon-to-be king of Tiryns,</p><p>The future king of Mycenae, Perseus, said this at a banquet.</p><p>The warrior most favored by the gods in the Greek world.</p><p>Perseus, the son of Zeus, the King of the Gods. On the day of the banquet, to prove his bravery and save his mother, he vowed to defeat the monster.</p><hr><p>...The faraway, solitary island was one of the places where those exiled by the gods lived.</p><p>A hideous monster lurking at the end of the world.</p><p>According to the rumors, it resided in the Titans&#39; ruins, resembling the cunning evil of the Sirens, and the chaotic disorder of the Chimeras.</p><p>Once a glorious palace of the gods, there was not a trace of the former beauty left on the island; it was now a demonic realm the likes of which cannot be found elsewhere.</p><p>The name of the place was the &quot;Shapeless Isle.&quot;</p><p>A place not even birds visit. A hell on Earth.</p><hr><p>Five Noble Phantasms were given to Perseus.</p><p>A pair of winged sandals so he could fly through the air,</p><p>a helmet that granted invisibility to its wearer,</p><p>a bronze shield, polished like a mirror, the gift of the goddess Athena,</p><p>a snake hunter&#39;s curved sword - Harpe,</p><p>and, finally, a bag to contain the monster&#39;s head, Kibisis.</p><hr><p>No warrior in the history of Greece had ever been given this many Noble Phantasms.</p><p>Perseus equipped himself to win, and gathered much information to aid him.</p><p>A wealth of trustworthy weapons, and a strategy to utilize them.</p><p>Although he had neither seen the foe nor ever set foot in a demons&#39; lair, he had not a speck of fear.</p><p>Until the day of the battle.</p><p>Until the moment he descended to the dark palace.</p><hr><p>...The island was drastically different from what he had heard before.</p><p>The sun did not shine, the air was stale and all living things melted away.</p><p>A hell that did not permit the very existence of life, a dark palace stained with blood.</p><p>A place that would trick one into thinking that his time had come and he had fallen into the afterlife.</p><p>Although favored by the gods, Perseus, who had yet to prove himself as a hero, could not maintain his certainty of victory.</p><hr><p>Perseus ran deeper into the palace as if he were escaping.</p><p>His dreams of slaying the monster gloriously were long gone.</p><p>His mind was filled with something more urgent than his search for fame.</p><p>He only wanted one thing: find the monster, take its head, and escape from the island - as quickly as possible.</p><hr><p>The stale air was burning his skin, and where his feet had touched the ground, they were slowly melting away.</p><p>Simply stopping would spell certain defeat.</p><p>The foolish challenger would perish as the monster slept quietly inside the palace.</p><hr><p>Holding his breath, suppressing the scream rising in his throat, Perseus hid in the shadows as he advanced.</p><p>The palace was enormous.</p><p>No, it was excessively huge.</p><p>Seemingly enchanted, it had no beginning and no end.</p><p>This terrifying palace only revealed Perseus&#39; own insignificance.</p><p>Yes―――it was not that the palace was grand.</p><p>It was just that Perseus, shivering and alone, was like a tiny insect next to it.</p><hr><p>And so...</p><p>A few minutes, no, hours later, the mirrored shield warned Perseus.</p><p>The shield reflected the surroundings on its mirror-like surface.</p><p>A detector of sorts, the shield shows the dark palace&#39;s layout, as well as Perseus&#39; own heartbeat.</p><p>...And the heartbeat of a nearby monster, fast approaching...</p><hr><p>...The view distorts.</p><p>A grotesque creature emerges from the darkness.</p><p>Yet one cannot stare at it directly.</p><p>Perseus forces himself to look at nothing but the shield until the very end, guided by its clues.</p><hr><p>It is already too late to back away.

So that&#39;s how the story of Medusa&#39;s slaying actually went.”</p><p>“Yes. From then on, seeing my own reflection was a somewhat traumatic experience. I would not describe it as a hate of mirrors in general, however.”</p><p>“...Ah... so you don&#39;t really take physical damage, but it&#39;s mentally difficult, right?”</p><hr><p>“That is correct.</p><p>In addition, having my head used so frivolously by such an... adolescent... angers me greatly. It disconcerts me. Mirrors are my sworn enemy, you could say.”</p><p>She mutters about having an urge to break every mirror she sees.</p><p>...&quot;Such an adolescent&quot; is an unusually emotional choice of words for Rider, however.</p><hr><p>“The adolescent... you mean Perseus, right...?</p><p>Judging from your story... well, I can&#39;t call him a &quot;victim,&quot; but it does sound like he got tricked into it, no?”</p><hr><p>“...Yes, I suppose so. He was also fooled by the gods. In any case, he was a mere mosquito in my eyes at that time.</p><p>I don&#39;t feel sympathy for him, either, but...”</p><hr><p>“But?”</p><p>“Personally, there is no way I could bring myself to like him.</p><p>Nevertheless, he did become a fine character afterwards.”</p><p>“Hmm... What sort of a person was he?”</p><hr><p>“Right... to sum it up briefly...”</p><p>Rider thinks intently, as if digging up his image from the depths of her memories.</p><p>And not long after, she raises her head, seemingly surprised at the answer she came up with herself.</p><hr><p>“To sum it up, he was a successful Shinji.”</p><p>“..................”</p><p>Ah... that conjures up an extremely clear image in my head.</p><p>“That... really is disturbing.</p><p>Then, if there were no Kibisis...”</p><hr><p>Having had the barrier turned inside out by Kibisis, Rider ended up sealed in her own Temple of Darkness.</p><p>Anyone caught in the Temple of Darkness is said to experience a nightmare that has taboo and delight both mixed in it.</p><p>...However.</p><p>I wonder what kind of a vision was it that left her with a trauma this deep...?</p><hr><p>“...Say. What did you see, Rider?”</p><p>“――――――”</p><p>“Ah, no, I&#39;m sorry.</p><p>A nightmare isn&#39;t something you&#39;d like to recall, much less talk about it. Sorry for asking something weird.”</p><hr><p>“..................No.</p><p>As far as dreams are concerned, I do owe you the full story. It would not be fair for me to refuse.”</p><p>Rider straightens her posture once again.</p><p>But she still remains hunched over ever so slightly.</p><p>...Ack. It must be an ever greater challenge to endure than the story of being beheaded.</p><p>“...Well, that nightmare...”</p><hr><p>““MeMedudusa. sa. GGeett oovveerr hheerre, e, MeMedudusa!”sa!”</p><hr><p>“...Y-Yes, here I am.</p><p>What is it, elder Nee-sama, younger Nee-sama?”</p><p>“&quot;What is it,&quot; she says.</p><p>You are aware that the two of us shall be attending Poseidon-sama&#39;s banquet this evening, are you not?”</p><p>“...Yes. I am aware that Nee-sama and Nee-sama had been invited by the Sea King, but... what of it?”</p><p>“Uht...! Did you hear that, the other me!?</p><p>This is supposed to be our sister, this useless behemoth!”</p><p>“Yes, it is quite bothersome, to have such a brainless person as family.”</p><p>“Medusa, perhaps you&#39;re a dinosaur?</p><p>I do wonder if your brain&#39;s as big as our hands.”</p><p>“...Ah, eh... Nee-sama?</p><p>Um, if it&#39;s about the dinner preparations, I am getting to it just now, but...”</p><p>“Aah, really! I&#39;ve had it now!</p><p>I was asking if our attires were ready!”</p><hr><p>“Eh, ah... yes, I&#39;ll, g-g-get them prepared!”</p><p>“You&#39;ll get them prepared? They aren&#39;t already?”</p><p>“I&#39;m sure she&#39;s planning on making us look bad with ill preparations.”</p><hr><p>“No, that&#39;s not it!</p><p>I, I...!”</p><p>“Oh? This girl is looking rather defiant, don&#39;t you agree, the other me? How clumsy and un-ladylike.”</p><p>“Indeed. It is a pity, but she will have to be punished, I suppose.”</p><p>“It&#39;s all for the sake of our own beloved sister. It might appear a little overdone from the side, but we must steel our hearts and set her straight once again.”</p><p>“Ah, eh...!</p><p>E-Elder Nee-sama, I am repenting, I am repenting...!”</p><hr><p>“I will do my best tomorrow, so please forgive me todayyyy...!”</p><p>“...Hehe, that&#39;s right. You should know your place.”</p><hr><p>“All right. We will soon be enjoying ourselves at the party, so we shall forgive you. Now, Medusa, our dresses...”</p><p>“Ah... w-what is it, younger Nee-sama?”</p><p>“What is this!?</p><p>I can&#39;t believe my eyes! It looks like there are three sets of dresses to me!”</p><p>“Eh... ehehehe.</p><p>I kept it a secret, but I got an invitation, too, Nee-sama.”</p><p>“Impossible!!!</p><p>Hm*ph, take this!”</p><hr><p>“Hiiiiiiyaaaa!?”</p><p>“N-N-Nee-sama! Why are you ripping off the scale decorations on my new frilly dress?!”</p><p>“Fufufu, merciless, I really am.”</p><p>“What a pity. Now it looks like Medusa can&#39;t go to the party.”</p><p>“Ah, ah, ah... h-how horrible! ...Why would you do that, Nee-sama!?”</p><p>“Hah, you are a thousand years too young.”</p><p>“Do you understand, Medusa? Someone of your standing should not even hope to attend a party.”</p><p>“You mean, I need to gather a large fan club first?”</p><p>“Well, that&#39;s a little too much.</p><p>If that were the case, then you&#39;d never be able to debut in the social world.”</p><p>“...Elder Nee-sama, what are you...”</p><p>“Did you not understand what Euryale said?</p><p>There isn&#39;t a single blockhead that could possibly be attracted to a hulk like you!”</p><hr><p>“Or, rather, there is no way that we would permit it.</p><p>There can&#39;t be many who could accompany your stature in the first place!”</p><p>“Indeed. It&#39;s a shame, but males who will look good by your side are extremely few in number.”</p><p>“Even a kiss won&#39;t be romantic.</p><p>To make the male go on his tiptoes... it&#39;s nothing short of fatal!”</p><p>“N-No way... I-It&#39;s not like I chose to be...”</p><p>“...Or, I don&#39;t even think... I&#39;m that... tall...”</p><p>“Ahahaha! You&#39;re still that big even after scrunching up! If that makes you angry, try to be more like us!”</p><p>“The two of us can be held lovably in others&#39; arms, but the one who could lift you would be... maybe Atlas and probably no one else.”</p><p>“Yes, that is true, but he will surely hurt his back.”</p><p>“Do you understand? Slim and compact are in style now. Things a farm horse like you are not.”</p><p>“Ah, ugh... how cruel! You didn&#39;t have to put it that way!”</p><p>“Keke, even your crying is no good!</p><p>Your tears would feel like a flood to your male partner, surely.”</p><p>“Oh my, have some pity, other me.</p><p>Did you know? Medusa sighs every time she looks in a mirror.”</p><p>“This pathetic effort is just like her, don&#39;t you think?”</p><hr><p>“So, I was hoping to get a concave mirror from Poseidon-sama at the party tonight.”</p><p>“Puh, so that she can look small and lovable?”</p><hr><p>“Ahahah, perfect! Let us ask Poseidon-sama for an extraordinarily huge mirror!”</p><hr><p>“Of course, we&#39;ll have our reply to him ready, should he ask.”</p><hr><p>“&quot;It&#39;s rather embarrassing, but our little sister has a problem looking at normal-sized mirrors, a kind of a mental affliction.&quot;”</p><p>“Splendid.</p><p>Aah, really, we care too much for our little sister, don&#39;t you think so, Medusa?&quot;</p><p>“Uuuuuh, Nee-sama... WAAAAAAAAAH!!!”</p><hr><p>―――And so...</p><p>Several minutes passed since Rider closed her eyes.</p><hr><p>“...Uh, Rider?</p><p>About the nightmare...”</p><p>“―――I&#39;ve changed my mind. Let us leave old stories here for now.</p><p>Also, it&#39;ll soon be time for the appointment.”</p><hr><p>Rider gets up from her seat.</p><p>It really was an insensible request.</p><hr><p>“Then, do excuse me.</p><p>....And, to clarify a potential misunderstanding, the Kibisis-induced nightmare was far from evil.</p><p>It was not excruciating pain that paralyzed me―――it was the joy of seeing the people I never thought I&#39;d meet again.”</p><hr><p>“Huh...?”</p><p>“It is not unlike the situation you are in.</p><p>I was being whipped around by everyone, but those were still the best days of my life... It might, in fact, be the fear of reminiscing about those times that brings about my hatred of mirrors.”</p><hr><p>She leaves with a kind smile.</p><p>“......Hm.”</p><p>It makes me happy to see such a smiling face.</p><p>Makes me happy, but...</p><hr><p>“I&#39;m not really getting whipped about, Rider...”</p><p>...No, but...</p><p>What&#39;s with this surging feeling of companionship for Rider?</p><hr><h3 id="town・day-1-wabi-sabi-tsumami" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#town・day-1-wabi-sabi-tsumami" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Town・Day 1 Wabi-sabi-tsumami</h3><hr><p>I walk along the street, pushing bike Number Two - a boring front basket-equipped mamachari - alongside me.</p><p>Rider made off with Number One - which, incidentally, is not supposed to be used by anyone other than me - when I wasn&#39;t looking.</p><hr><p>“Now then, the shopping is about done... ah, right.”</p><p>We need to restock the teacakes, don&#39;t we.</p><p>With Fuji-Nee devouring our entire stockpile of sweets, Rider stealing my bike... well, leaving that alone, even my body&#39;s feeling dull and heavy today. Bad news just keeps on coming.</p><hr><p>“Fuji-Nee said she&#39;d get more sweets, but I don&#39;t know when she plans to do that. Hmm... Alright.”</p><p>I double-check the contents of my wallet.</p><p>Today, I was wise enough to shop during a timed sale, so there&#39;s still a bit of cash left. I guess I can head over to Edomaeya for this one.</p><hr><p>And, sure enough, Edomaeya is―――huh?</p><hr><p>“Ha, ih it ihn&#39;t Hirou.”</p><p>“...Saber, calm down and swallow what you&#39;re chewing first.”</p><hr><p>...Now this is rare.</p><p>Saber, who naturally attracts attention, seldom goes out to eat sweets.</p><hr><p>“Munchmunch... Mm. Shirou, are you shopping for dinner?”</p><p>“Yep. Unusual seeing you here, all by yourself in the shopping district.”</p><hr><p>When Saber goes shopping, I give her the wallet, but I&#39;m pretty sure that was not the case today.</p><p>Hmm, where did she get the cash...?</p><hr><p>“Ah... about this...”</p><p>“For now, I have some shopping to do in Edomaeya. Finish eating that while it&#39;s still warm.”</p><p>I get some obanyaki at the counter, one for everyone at the household.</p><hr><p>“...Excuse me for eating it first, all by myself.”</p><p>“Well, that one&#39;s yours, I guess... so, I haven&#39;t given you the wallet, how did you end up paying for it?”</p><hr><p>“Taiga gave me money.”</p><p>“Fuji-Nee did? She sure must have a lot of spending money.”</p><p>...Wasn&#39;t the last payday quite a long time ago?</p><p>“Yes. When I met Taiga at the house, she was in an unusually good mood.</p><p>And so she said, &quot;Here, go and have an afternoon snack&quot;―――”</p><hr><p>Ah, so that&#39;s... how it was?</p><p>“...Shirou, you are looking a bit pale. Is something wrong?”</p><p>“No... Nevermind. Right, Fuji-Nee...”</p><hr><p>In other words, here&#39;s what probably transpired.</p><p>First, Fuji-Nee discovered our secret rainy-day stash of snacks, descending upon it like a hungry wolf on a flock of sheep.</p><p>Then, her spirits improving significantly due to her full stomach, she decides to give Saber some spending cash to spread the love.</p><hr><p>Finally, Saber would be completely baffled when me and Sakura try to wring it from Fuji-Nee.</p><p>Noticing the worried look I&#39;m getting from my side, I wave my hand to dismiss her concerns.</p><hr><p>“What about Taiga?”</p><p>“Oh, nothing, it&#39;s just Fuji-Nee being her usual self.</p><p>Still... Now that I think about it, she&#39;s never given ME any pocket money...”</p><hr><p>I think back to those times.</p><p>The old man was stubbornly attached to me as a kid, and Fuji-Nee got attached to the two of us.</p><p>We played together... or rather, she played with me, the same way she would with a toy. But I never got any spending money out of it.</p><hr><p>“...Is that so?”</p><p>“Fuji-Nee&#39;s been perpetually broke since back in the day.</p><p>That hasn&#39;t really changed even after she started work...ing?”</p><hr><p>Saber suddenly freezes.</p><p>I turn to see what she&#39;s looking at―――</p><p>《Soon it&#39;ll be Chinese steamed bun season.》</p><p>The escaping steam and the aroma of the meat-filling buns make me think &quot;ah, it really is that time, isn&#39;t it?&quot;</p><hr><p>Saber reaches into her pocket.</p><p>I can hear the coins clinking around.</p><hr><p>“...Muh, just a little short.</p><p>No, let us be satisfied with just obanyaki today.</p><p>I shall look forward to the steamed buns another day... instant impulse gratification weakens the body, that&#39;s right.”</p><hr><p>I can hear her muttering.</p><p>There&#39;s no need to get anxious about it. You could just ask me.</p><hr><p>“You&#39;ve got steamed buns on your mind, Saber?”</p><p>“...No, that, that is not it at all!</p><p>If I snack any more it will ruin my appetite at dinnertime.”</p><p>“It&#39;s okay, if you can&#39;t eat any more I&#39;ll take half. I&#39;ve got a bit of cash left over, so don&#39;t worry about it.”</p><hr><p>My wallet won&#39;t complain just because of one or two buns.</p><p>I have Saber hold the bike while I get in line―――</p><hr><p>“Ahh, so this is a meat-filled steamed bun, Shirou.”</p><p>Saber&#39;s holding the bun, blowing off the steam.</p><p>“...I&#39;ll need to thank Fuji-Nee...”</p><p>I wouldn&#39;t have gotten to see Saber like this if Fuji-Nee wasn&#39;t so capricious.</p><hr><p>“The meat flavor locked into the steamed dough... mmm.”</p><p>Stuffing her cheeks with food, Saber nods with satisfaction.</p><p>I can&#39;t make this at home, after all.</p><p>You need some kind of steamer for that, and a knack for kneading that kind of dough.</p><hr><p>“Well, let&#39;s head back, Saber.”</p><p>“......Um, how shall I put this...”</p><p>Saber fidgets while standing there.</p><p>She&#39;s still looking at the steamer.</p><hr><p>“I noticed that bean-filled steamed bun over there, I wonder how does it taste?”</p><p>“......Okay, if you want to try it I&#39;ll go with you.”</p><hr><p>My wallet can still withstand two or three steamed buns.</p><p>...Is what I&#39;d like to believe, but with all the original, pizza, curry, and special shark fin varieties, if Saber starts getting carried away, I&#39;ll have to reconsider.</p><hr><p>“It&#39;s great that the two of you are here.”</p><p>“Rider!?”</p><p>Rider suddenly appears, turning around on the Emiya residence&#39;s bike Number One.</p><p>She manages to drift, locking up the brakes.</p><p>Muh... She did hijack the bike, but seeing how much she&#39;s getting out of it... I might have lost the motivation to complain.</p><hr><p>“Munch... Hm, what is it, Rider?”</p><p>Ahh, Saber, near your mouth...</p><p>Rider has to be staring at it, that&#39;s definitely not majestic.</p><hr><p>“...You ate some meat-filled steamed buns, didn&#39;t you? There is still a bit on your face.”</p><p>“Kuh...</p><p>No, leaving that aside, why did you suddenly stop us?”</p><hr><p>Having been caught in an embarrassing situation, Saber&#39;s response is to pick a fight.</p><p>...This might be bad.</p><p>Rider&#39;s coming over to respond to the challenge...</p><hr><p>“You disturb the shopping district&#39;s peace, recklessly riding around and doing as you please. I am shocked by your selfishness.</p><p>It appears the Rider class has degraded to the level of a noisy wild bronco.”</p><hr><p>“Oh, hearing it from Saber herself upsets me greatly. But I do wonder if you will repeat it once you see this?”</p><p>Saying that, Rider takes something out of her bag―――</p><hr><p>“Wha――――――”</p><p>“..................huff.”</p><p>Obanyaki from Verde&#39;s underground food court.</p><hr><p>“R-R-R-Rider, what is t-t-that...?”</p><p>“Can you not tell just by looking?</p><p>Your favorite, obanyaki, and the ones with whole red bean filling at that. Not to mention the custard, cheese, and chocolate ones - none of which are included in Edomaeya&#39;s repertoire.”</p><hr><p>“.....................”</p><p>“...............kuh.”</p><p>Saber looks troubled.</p><p>She has to choose between submitting to General Rider and receiving obanyaki, or sticking to her original decision and remaining content with just bean paste-filled buns.</p><hr><p>“...If you would be so kind as to share some, I will gladly....</p><p>What are your conditions, Rider?”</p><p>Saber folds quickly.</p><p>...Feeling no shame as a King of Knights, her decision is swift.</p><hr><p>The obanyaki is handed over.</p><p>So, what is Rider going to make Saber do as payment?</p><hr><p>“No conditions.”</p><p>“Hwha!?”</p><hr><p>“Huh, hwha ih he heahinh oh his!?”</p><p>“...Saber? You don&#39;t need to stuff them in your mouth like that, they will not run away.”</p><hr><p>...She starts eating them immediately.</p><p>Maybe she really wanted to try the chocolate and custard flavors―――?</p><hr><p>“Saber, even though we live under the same roof, we constantly pick fights the moment we see each other. I do not think that is a good thing.</p><p>Thus, I thought I would make this peace offering, instead of a simple greeting.”</p><hr><p>“...........................”</p><p>&quot;Agreed,&quot; Saber tells Rider with her nod.</p><p>How do I put it... it&#39;s the kind of thing you&#39;d expect from a mature older sister.</p><hr><p>“..................kuh.”</p><p>On the other hand, Saber seems ashamed of herself.</p><p>She has already surrendered to the obanyaki&#39;s flavor―――I mean, having been shown the true meaning of &quot;tolerance,&quot; she is reflecting on her actions.</p><hr><p>“―――Shirou, are you laughing at me?”</p><p>“Huh?”</p><p>“I have been lacking in prudence.</p><p>Rider has only wished for a peaceful everyday life, but up to now I&#39;ve been... I have been so foolish for so long...”</p><hr><p>“If you do not eat quickly, they will get cold, Saber.”</p><p>“Ah, right, munchmunch...”</p><p>―――Rider is completely filling Saber up.</p><p>Mmm... Today is a very unusual day.</p><p>And now Rider turns to face me, with a smile.</p><hr><p>“That&#39;s right, there&#39;s something I would like you to have, Shirou.”</p><p>“...I&#39;m not particularly hungry or anything.”</p><p>Rider is randomly sensitive and lavish today.</p><p>Maybe―――</p><hr><p>“Did you get spending money from Fuji-Nee, too?”</p><p>“No, I paid for this myself.</p><p>I want to express my gratitude for all you&#39;ve done, and the trouble you go through for our sake. So, by all means...”</p><hr><p>“―――Here, Shirou.”</p><p>“Ah... Thank you... uh?”</p><p>“I thought you could use this today.”</p><hr><p>Turning over the label on the small bottle that she gave me―――</p><p>『Reinforced Garlic/Yohimbine/Maka DX』</p><p>...What kind of association game is this?</p><hr><p>“You seem to be particularly tired today, so I would humbly ask that... no, I absolutely insist that you drink this.”</p><p>“...Ah, uh.”</p><p>The poisonous-looking label makes my cheek twitch.</p><p>More than an energy drink, this looks like a tonic... So, given that it&#39;s Rider we&#39;re talking about, can I hope it didn&#39;t come from anything like a mamushi or an erabu snake?</p><hr><p>“I do realize it may smell rather unusual and be difficult to drink the first time―――”</p><p>“Um, Rider?”</p><p>“Perhaps beer yeast would have been better, wouldn&#39;t it?”</p><p>“I&#39;m not talking about that...”</p><p>I beckon Rider to come over.</p><hr><p>“...Hey. What&#39;s going on today?”</p><p>“...Oh, nothing, I just gave some thought to various matters.”</p><p>“...That&#39;s right... I kind of thought either Fuji-Nee or Sakura might have told you to go and make friends with Saber.”</p><p>“...Well, not really?”</p><hr><p>“...I&#39;m understanding less and less.</p><p>First Saber, then me.... Ah, so did you buy something for Sakura, too?”</p><p>“Yes, Sakura is the most essential one, after all...”</p><p>“Essential? Not just important or valuable?</p><p><em>sigh</em>... Are you hiding something from Sakura?”</p><hr><p>“...............――――――What could I possibly be hiding?”</p><p>This is highly suspicious. Something is clearly going on here.</p><hr><p>“That is, Shirou, I―――”</p><hr><p>“..............................”</p><hr><p>“Stealing food!? Senpai!”</p><p>“!!!!”</p><hr><p>“.....................”</p><hr><p>“Y-You two don&#39;t need to get so angry about it!”</p><p>“Fuji-Nee, is that what you say after you wolfed down everything?</p><p>Reflect on what you did, now!”</p><p>“That&#39;s right. If you wanted a snack, you could have just asked.</p><p>Please reflect on what you did!”</p><hr><p>“Aww, but having to worry about manners in Shirou&#39;s house sucks, I wanted to eat by myself, and Shirou&#39;s things are my things, grumble-grumble.”</p><hr><p>“..............................”</p><hr><p>“That&#39;s why I&#39;ve been saying that you mustn&#39;t steal! How many times do I need to say it before you understand?”</p><hr><p>“!”</p><hr><p>“Eek! Sakura-chan is scary!”</p><p>“...Ah, there was that limited cake special at La Fleur that Sakura had been looking forward to a whole month... If you&#39;d just kept your hands off that I&#39;d have...”</p><p>“Senpai! You are too easy on her! As a caretaker of the house, please keep your personal feelings separate from your duties!”</p><p>“That&#39;s right, I&#39;ll be serious, Fuji-Nee.</p><p>Reflect on what you did. Sakura is really scary.”</p><hr><p>“...........................”</p><hr><p>“How many times do I need to tell you not to steal food before you understand?!”*</p><hr><p>“........................”</p><hr><p>“Fufufufu...... Rider?</p><p>You were stealing Senpai&#39;s blood, weren&#39;t you?”</p><p>“......................”</p><hr><p>“Oh, you think I won&#39;t know if you stay silent?</p><p>I might even overlook Fujimura-sensei stealing snacks, but you stealing drinks of Senpai&#39;s blood........ fufufu.”</p><p>“.....................”</p><hr><p>“I&#39;ll have to punish you... won&#39;t I, Rider?”</p><p>“.....................”</p><hr><p>“..............................”</p><hr><p>“I told you two, I&#39;m reflecting on it, Sakura-chan, Shirou...”</p><p>“See, she says she regrets it, Sakura.”</p><p>“Hm. I did not mean to eat it all, but something just came over me, and now I regret it.”</p><p>“That sounds like the insincere apology of a juvenile offender, but it also sounds like Fujimura-sensei... um?”</p><hr><p>“Understood! I, the woman known as Fujimura, beg everyone&#39;s pardon for causing trouble, and humbly request that I be given an opportunity to provide a proper apology!</p><p>A lowlife that knows no gratitude for lodging and meals she&#39;s been provided, I cannot face grandfather like this.”</p><hr><p>“!”</p><hr><p>“Apology, huh... Just stop bringing persimmons already, we&#39;re rapidly running out of room to store them.”</p><p>“But we must still accept Fujimura-sensei&#39;s apology, right, Senpai?”</p><p>“...Well, yeah.”</p><hr><p>“Since we are all generous people here, we will forgive you if you give a heartfelt apology.”</p><p>“Ahh, Sakura-chan is such a good girl, can we switch her with that hateful loli?”</p><p>“N-o-w-a-y!”</p><hr><p>“.....................I see.</p><p>Apology... is it.</p><p>Everyone will forgive you if you just apologize, won&#39;t they?―――”</p><hr><p>“――――――Who knows?</p><p>I&#39;m not hiding anything.”</p><p>“...Well, if you say so.”</p><p>Rider looks to be lost deep in thought... Just what happened, exactly?</p><hr><p>“In any case, I&#39;ll take your offer and drink this.”</p><p>“Yes, please take it for when you&#39;re feeling anemic or just low on energy.</p><p>Since I still have to give Sakura what I bought for her, I will be heading home first. Do excuse me.”</p><p>Nimbly jumping on Number One, Rider―――</p><hr><p>“...hee you ah hohe.”</p><p>“Swallow before you speak... Ah, there she goes with Number One again.”</p><hr><p>“Mm... gulp. Is something the matter?</p><p>Just what is she... Ah, it is amazing how the light taste of this custard obanyaki just fills your mouth with sweetness...”</p><hr><p>Saber is still caught up in the aftertaste of her obanyaki.</p><p>...Oh well.</p><p>I doubt anything good will come out of my clumsy attempts to uncover the truth.</p><hr><p>“Well then, I&#39;m done with shopping, so shall we go home?”</p><p>“―――Please wait, Shirou.”</p><p>No sooner than I raise my heel, she stops me.</p><hr><p>“...What&#39;s up, Saber?”</p><p>“I still have not had the bean-filled bu――――――!?!”</p><p>Rider!? Didn&#39;t you leave?</p><hr><p>“How callous, Saber, if you wanted bean-filled buns, you should have just asked me...”</p><p>Rider talks with a big smile on her face.</p><p>She caught Saber totally off guard this time.</p><p>If Saber had a tail, she&#39;d be wagging it vigorously about now.</p><hr><p>“R-Really?”</p><p>“Yes, we&#39;re good friends, aren&#39;t we, Saber?”</p><p>“Ah... up to now, I thought of you as of someone with complete lack of consideration for others. I am ashamed of myself... I gladly accept your offer.”</p><p>...She&#39;s totally feeding her, isn&#39;t she?</p><hr><p>“Then, while it is still warm, I shall join in...”</p><p>“Of course, of course... munchmunchmunch.”</p><hr><p>They really look like close sisters now.</p><p>They&#39;ve stopped quarreling, if only for today.</p><p>...It&#39;d make my life a whole lot easier if they were to just stay like this.</p><hr><p>“Would you like some as well, Shirou?”</p><p>“...I&#39;d rather make sure Saber&#39;s satisfied. Oh, it needs not be said, but you can&#39;t leave any leftovers come dinnertime.”</p><hr><p>“Of course, Shirou. There&#39;s always room for the main meal.”</p><p>“..................”</p><p>Our eyes meet unintentionally.</p><p>Um, shouldn&#39;t it be the other way around...?</p><hr><h3 id="emiya-residence・start-of-night-things-to-do" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#emiya-residence・start-of-night-things-to-do" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Emiya Residence・Start of Night Things to do</h3><h3 id="emiya-residence・night-map-hero-of-the-bath" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#emiya-residence・night-map-hero-of-the-bath" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Emiya Residence・Night Map Hero of the bath</h3><hr><p>―――All right.</p><p>There&#39;s a lot going on, but even so, let&#39;s take a bath!</p><hr><p>“Whew, finally a break―――”</p><p>It&#39;s good to rest a tired body at the end of the day.</p><p>It&#39;s already been half a year since the number of female occupants in my home dramatically increased.</p><p>Everyday&#39;s been really lively and fun, but there are times when I just want to unwind and relax by myself as well.</p><hr><p>“Oh, Shirou?”</p><p>“――――Eh?”</p><hr><p>“S-Sorry!”</p><p>I-I-I-I wasn&#39;t paying attention...!</p><p>Even though I&#39;m usually careful about this, I&#39;m repeating the same mistakes!</p><hr><p>“...I apologize.</p><p>I&#39;m not sure what we are apologizing for, but as you can see, I am occupied right now.”</p><p>“No, I didn&#39;t see anything! I can&#39;t see anything other than the outline of your body because of the bubbles, so it&#39;s still entirely, totally, completely safe!”</p><hr><p>“Of course, that&#39;s why if your business with me isn&#39;t urgent, it would be preferable for it to wait until after I am finished.”</p><p>“Right! What I mean is, this was not on purpose!”</p><p>“Is that so?”</p><p>“It is! Thank god you understand...!”</p><hr><p>I shout out in joy.</p><p>Thank god, if my follow-up had been a second later, I would have gone straight for a dead end...!</p><hr><p>“...I am sorry that I did not understand well.”</p><p>“No, no, it&#39;s just that I didn&#39;t know that you&#39;d gone in first.”</p><p>“If you simply observe the hamper, I believe it should be immediately clear, though.”</p><p>“...uwaah.”</p><hr><p>Even though we&#39;re both naked, she&#39;s still so calm at a time like this.</p><p>I&#39;m still dealing with the shock on various levels.</p><hr><p>“S-Sorry for not checking. I&#39;ll leave now.”</p><p>I&#39;m just lucky it wasn&#39;t Sakura or Tohsaka.</p><p>If that was the case, it would probably turn into utter chaos, with loud screaming and lightning shooting everywhere.</p><hr><p>“W-Well then, I&#39;ll apologize properly later.”</p><p>I awkwardly turn back.</p><p>“...kh!?”</p><p>Only my upper body moved.</p><p>For some reason, my legs didn&#39;t follow.</p><hr><p>“Shirou?”</p><p>Feeling my balance collapse, my body instinctively stiffens at the incoming shock from impact on the hard tiles.</p><p>However I didn&#39;t fall over, as if my feet were stuck to the tiles―――</p><hr><p>“No... way...”</p><p>No, they really were stuck.</p><p>I couldn&#39;t feel my body from the waist down. It felt as if my body was part of the ground.</p><hr><p>“Shirou, what is the matter?”</p><hr><p>“Rider...... where are your glasses?”</p><p>“Ah, you mean the Mystic Eye Killers?”</p><p>“Right, those.”</p><p>“They fog up from the steam, so I left them outside.”</p><hr><p>“Yeah... that&#39;s only natural.</p><p>It&#39;s not like she&#39;s nearsighted, and there really isn&#39;t anyone who would wear glasses in the bath.”</p><hr><p>“Right, and there&#39;s no one here to see my Mystic Eyes either. So there&#39;s no need to worry about an accident even if I release them here.”</p><p>Hahaha. Well, that&#39;s only if there aren&#39;t any idiot intruders like me.</p><hr><p>“...uuugh. So I wasn&#39;t the only one who wanted to relax in the bath?”</p><p>“Mystic Eyes...... Ah, Shirou!?”</p><p>The calm woman widens her eyes in a rare loss of composure.</p><p>“Idi... gh! Just wait a little, don&#39;t look, Rider!”</p><hr><p>There was no point in closing my eyes.</p><p>Because I had already received the curse of petrification from seeing Rider just now.</p><hr><p>“―――No, it&#39;s too late.</p><p>When it&#39;s gone this far, the petrified part won&#39;t return to normal even if I close my eyes.”</p><p>“No way...!”</p><p>“...I&#39;d prefer it if you didn&#39;t raise your voice too much.</p><p>If Sakura were to come in, there would surely be a misunderstanding.”</p><hr><p>“Ah, I see... what the, it&#39;s already up to my waist!</p><p>Even the towel I had on before is turning to stone... Just what kind of logic is this supposed to follow?”</p><p>“Do not worry, although there are individual differences, that kind of change is a normal phenomenon that happens to everyone.</p><p>Not knowing the mechanism behind it probably makes you feel uneasy. But since this is a natural phenomenon, there is no need to be embarrassed or worried even if you are teased.”</p><hr><p>“What are you talking about!? Anyway, help me out here, please!”</p><p>“I see, then there is no other choice.”</p><p>Rider shook her head, making her hair flow like a river of purple, and turned to face the mirror on the wall.</p><hr><p>“I&#39;m a bit reluctant to do this, since I don&#39;t like mirrors, but...”</p><p>The eyes reflected in the mirror were stained crimson, as if bloodshot.</p><p>And then, the vine-like encroachment climbing up my body stopped as though it had been cut off at the root.</p><hr><p>“Whew... you saved me, Rider.”</p><p>“It&#39;s still in it&#39;s initial stages, so it should clear away soon with your body&#39;s magic resistance. If it had reached your heart it would&#39;ve been dangerous―――Shirou?”</p><p>Rider restlessly surveyed her surroundings and stood up nervously.</p><hr><p>“What&#39;s wrong?”</p><p>“...It is nothing to worry about. I&#39;ll be getting out fir―――”</p><p>“...gh!”</p><p>“Woah, be carefu...!”</p><p>Her soap-covered foot stepped on a bucket―――and so a fully naked Rider fell against me.</p><hr><p>“...ah.”</p><p>Flushed and dizzy, Rider clings herself to the upper part of my body which had not been petrified and retained sensation.</p><p>Her bountiful chest, much like water balloons packed to their limits with hot water, were squished and distorted in the space between our bodies.</p><hr><p>“ghh...”</p><p>My heart was about to burst from the excitement, and the blood pushed back from my petrified lower half rushed through my head twice as fast.</p><hr><p>“Pardon me, Shirou.”</p><p>“Th... That&#39;s a mirror! What you&#39;re leaning on is me!”</p><p>“Your petrified body has collapsed... hmm, the texture is unusual.”</p><p>“Th-That&#39;s the bathtub. More importantly your chest is, uwawah!”</p><p>“Yes, I am aware of that. You should really calm down, Shirou.”</p><p>“That was clearly...... not on purpose?”</p><hr><p>Being careful not to look at her defenseless naked body, I grasp her thin hand.</p><p>Rider squinted her eyes at me, but the direction she was looking was a bit off.</p><hr><p>“Rider, how many fingers am I holding up?”</p><p>“...Two... Five...?”</p><p>“As I thought, you can&#39;t see?”</p><hr><p>“...Yes. I sealed off my magical energy with Breaker Gorgon in order to suppress my Mystic Eyes, however, losing my eyesight as well was a miscalculation.”</p><p>“I see, it&#39;s because of me.”</p><hr><p>“There is no need to worry. When I release Breaker Gorgon, my eyesight will be restored.</p><p>Shirou, I&#39;m sorry to trouble you, but could you guide me to the dressing room?”</p><p>“You can&#39;t tell, even though the bathroom&#39;s so small?”</p><p>Seeing her like this, lacking any sense of direction, makes the way she moved around in her Servant outfit while wearing that blindfold seem like a lie.</p><hr><p>“No, wait. Don&#39;t you still have shampoo in your hair?</p><p>You got in first, so you should finish your bath properly. I can shut my eyes.”</p><p>“I thank you for your offer, but I cannot wash my hair while my eyes are unable to see.”</p><p>......Rider, if you&#39;re that clumsy then how have you been able to... no, that&#39;s not important right now.</p><hr><p>“However, Shirou, as long as you&#39;re unable to leave here under your own strength, there is no other choice but for me to leave.”</p><p>“...No. I was the one who interrupted you.</p><p>This isn&#39;t an apology for before, but since you were in the middle of washing, I&#39;ll wash your hair for you.”</p><hr><p>“You would.... do that for me?”</p><p>&quot;Yeah,&quot; I nod.</p><p>I can&#39;t move my lower half, but I can still use both my arms perfectly well.</p><hr><p>“...That&#39;s true, washing this hair by myself is quite time consuming. Then, can I ask you to assist me?”</p><p>“Great. Then Rider, come sit here. And make sure to have your back to me.”</p><p>“Nnnー...... ah, there&#39;s a chair here.”</p><hr><p>“No, wait, that&#39;s a washbasin... You&#39;re stuck!?”</p><p>“...khh! How misleading.”</p><p>“If you use too much force you&#39;ll break it.”</p><hr><p>“Well, then I shall use my nails to tear the flesh from my bottom out of it.”</p><p>“Why!?”</p><p>“There is no other way.”</p><p>“S-S-S-S-Stop that, think it over more!</p><p>R-Right! You can use soap to slide out!”</p><hr><p>“Wouldn&#39;t it be faster to cut myself?”</p><p>“You can&#39;t cut your neck or your butt! Cutting yourself isn&#39;t cool!”</p><p>“Whew.”</p><p>“Is your butt okay, Rider?”</p><hr><p>“Thanks to your quick thinking, it&#39;s okay.</p><p>...ah, this shape, this is definitely a chair this time.”</p><p>“That&#39;s right... wait, Wah! Don&#39;t turn this way! Don&#39;t open your legs! Back, back! Other way!”</p><hr><p>“Sure, though I don&#39;t mind either way.”</p><p>“I mind! ...Just turn your back this way.</p><p>Okay then...... ummm?”</p><hr><p>Her hand wanders above the forest of bottles.</p><p>Saber, Tohsaka, and Sakura each have their own shampoo. And even Illya and Fuji-Nee, who aren&#39;t even living here, have their own bottles in this confusing mess.</p><hr><p>“Mine is the beige one.”</p><p>“The one that&#39;s third from the right?”</p><p>“Is this... it?”</p><p>“No, further left, over two more, is that it...?”</p><p>“Hm, it feels like this is it... here.”</p><p>Somehow, it kinda feels like steering by remote control.</p><hr><p>“Alright then... I&#39;m a bit nervous.”</p><p>As I add water to her silky smooth hair, it sparkles like silver threads weaved together.</p><hr><p>They say a woman&#39;s hair is her life. In that case, isn&#39;t it only natural to obsess over the best shampoo to make it shine?</p><p>Fussing over things like scalp care, water retention, 100% all natural or drug-free coating.</p><p>Probably all the more so for Rider, since her hair is so long and pretty.</p><hr><p>“Is something the matter, Shirou?”</p><p>“Ugh, stupid, stupid, don&#39;t get self-conscious... hm, isn&#39;t this body soap?”</p><p>“Yes, I use that one for everything.”</p><p>...That&#39;s crazily sports-minded.</p><hr><p>“What are you using to wash your hair!?”</p><p>“I believe that it should be sufficient for being around the house, but... is there something wrong with that?”</p><p>There should be a limit to how roughly you treat yourself.</p><p>Her hair is already so nice, it&#39;s a waste to treat it like this!</p><hr><p>“...For goodness&#39; sake.</p><p>Rider, can you grab the third and fourth bottles from the left?”</p><p>“Doesn&#39;t this belong to Rin?”</p><p>“As landlord, I will permit you to borrow it for today.”</p><p>For just this one time, I will thoroughly wash Rider&#39;s hair using Tohsaka&#39;s expensive looking shampoo.</p><hr><p>I squirt the liquid into my palm.</p><p>Considering that she has such long hair, I wonder how much shampoo I should use―――</p><p>Well, using too much shouldn&#39;t be a problem.</p><hr><p>“Alright, I&#39;m gonna start from the scalp.”</p><p>“I&#39;ll leave it to you...... nnh.”</p><p>Rider stiffens her body. Did the feeling of the cool shampoo startle her?</p><p>The shampoo spreads out as it permeated into her hair and began to foam at my fingers.</p><hr><p>“When I see it in my hands like this, you really do have an amazing amount of hair.”</p><p>“Indeed, and the weight increases as it absorbs water.</p><p>Would it be easier to understand if I said it was like having another person clinging to your head?”</p><hr><p>“Wow, that&#39;s surreal. Washing this by yourself would take a while right?”</p><p>“Well yes... I don&#39;t mind if you are a bit rougher, by the way.</p><p>You can also stop midway if your hands get tired. Since you have to wait for the petrification to wear off.”</p><hr><p>“Idiot. If I did that we&#39;d both catch colds.”</p><p>“I won&#39;t catch a cold. As you can see, this body is made differently from a normal human&#39;s.”</p><hr><p>“Uwhaaaa!?”</p><p>“That was a joke, my body&#39;s outward appearance is no different from that of a human.”</p><p>“I-I get it, you don&#39;t have to show me.”</p><hr><p>“...................</p><p>Is my body really so unsightly?”</p><p>“Huh?”</p><p>“No, it&#39;s nothing.</p><p>I just thought as an apology, I&#39;d do something to please you.”</p><hr><p>“You don&#39;t have to worry so much about it.</p><p>Since this is my fault to begin with, it feels weird to receive an apology.”</p><p>“But...”</p><p>“Besides, washing your hair is pretty fun for me.”</p><p>“Washing my hair?―――nngh.”</p><p>This is my first time washing someone else&#39;s hair, and washing this much hair has merit in and of itself.</p><hr><p>“Rider, what about you?”</p><p>“Eh?”</p><p>“Doesn&#39;t it feel good to have someone else wash your hair?”</p><p>“That&#39;s... ugh... mmm...”</p><hr><p>While listening to Riders voice leak out close by, I gently rub her scalp with the pads of my fingers.</p><p>I change the tempo of my fingers as if petting a cat, feeling amused with Rider&#39;s reactions.</p><hr><p>“Indeed... having my hair washed by you feels good.”</p><p>“I see, that&#39;s good then.”</p><p>“Mm... fufufu...”</p><hr><p>Twisting my upper body, I scoop up the hair that&#39;s flowing onto the floor.</p><p>Hanging her hair on my left arm, I worked up a lather by combing it out repeatedly with my fingers.</p><p>Like handling a loom, I kept weaving the magical satin threads.</p><hr><p>Since the foam was soaked up quickly, I would add more shampoo from time to time.</p><p>I feel like I&#39;ve used quite a bit of Tohsaka&#39;s shampoo, but since there&#39;s so much hair it can&#39;t be helped.</p><hr><p>“Are there any places that itch, madam?”</p><p>“No, not in particular... Fufu, you&#39;re like a beautician.”</p><p>“Yeah. I&#39;ve managed to get the hang of this.”</p><p>“What about you Shirou, doesn&#39;t your waist hurt with such a posture?”</p><p>“It&#39;s fine, my bottom half is firmly rooted in place. It&#39;s kind of like I&#39;m just sitting down.”</p><p>“Is that so...? Fua...mm...”</p><hr><p>“Mm... fu... fufu...”</p><p>Before I knew it, the weaving loom suddenly changes into a music box.</p><p>Rider&#39;s hair seemed to stretch on forever, and the music seemed to last just as long.</p><hr><p>“Hm?”</p><p>Something tickles the palm of my hand.</p><p>The foam-covered hair slipped from my fingers, and I saw unexpected movement.</p><hr><p>“...Huh?”</p><p>Following some kind of rhythm, the hair finally flows off from my arms.</p><p>Reluctantly, I stopped the performance and stretched out my hands as if to gather the sounds that fell.</p><hr><p>“Eh? Oh―――”</p><p>However, the hair continued to squirm away as if it had suddenly come to life.</p><p>I chase after the hair as it moves from right to left and back again.</p><hr><p>―――Then I noticed, it wasn&#39;t just the one bundle of hair.</p><p>Around me, all of the hair was dancing.</p><hr><p>“Kufufu, that tickles. Shirou, I can wash my own body.”</p><p>“Huh?”</p><p>“Mm... haah, you&#39;re pretty bold to touch even there.”</p><p>“W-W-Whaaa!?</p><p>I-I&#39;m not! Aah, just where is this perverted hair going!?”</p><hr><p>It&#39;s like trying to grab eels.</p><p>No matter how much I grab it, her hair always wriggles free.</p><p>Ah, wasn&#39;t Medusa&#39;s hair...</p><hr><p>“Ah... so it&#39;s startled because of the shampoo?”</p><p>“Eh? What the, aaah, oooh......?”</p><p>“No, perhaps they&#39;re embarrassed to have Shirou touching them so tenderly?”</p><hr><p>Rider smiles and giggles in a good mood.</p><p>I, on the other hand, was busy grabbing at the slithering hair with both hands not having a clue of what to do here, I was literally eating foam.</p><hr><p>“<em>gurgle</em> Rider?</p><p>Sorry, but this is a little―――”</p><p>“Well, what should I do? After all, I can&#39;t see anything.”</p><p>“Aren&#39;t you the one controlling all this, Rider?”</p><hr><p>“No, of course not.</p><p>In truth, Shirou, aren&#39;t you just using my hair as an excuse to touch me?”</p><p>“Wha...aa!?”</p><p>Even though I understand, that&#39;s still so cruel.</p><hr><p>“Well whatever, muh, huf, hah...”</p><p>I&#39;m slowly getting the hang of it.</p><p>I extend my arm in the direction her hair escapes to, but instead of grabbing, I lift it. And then, when it is just about to slip away, I quickly grab it and lift it once more with my entire arm.</p><p>Basically, it&#39;s like handling snakes.</p><hr><p>“Humph, umph, ooh, there... how&#39;s that?”</p><p>As my arms are insufficient, I provide my back as a destination for the hair as well.</p><p>Whenever the hair stops moving, I stop as well.</p><p>I dubiously twist my body like a snake-charmer and do my best to get used to the sensation of touching it.</p><p>...But how am I supposed to start washing her hair again like this?</p><hr><p>“Fufufu...”</p><p>Perhaps from finally realizing the struggles I was facing, Rider&#39;s body shakes from the laughter she is restraining.</p><hr><p>“Can you really not see anything?”</p><p>“Yes, that&#39;s why I won&#39;t notice no matter which part of me you look at.”</p><p>“Idi...! I-I&#39;m telling you I&#39;m not looking!”</p><p>“Heh, I know.”</p><hr><p>The hair escaped from my fingers and changed direction, this time aiming for my shoulders.</p><hr><p>“Ugh―――ah.”</p><p>The hair covered in shampoo felt less like snakes, and more like long tentacles as they lick against my skin.</p><p>Before I knew it, my whole arm was wrapped by hair.</p><hr><p>“Rider, I can&#39;t wash your hair like this.”</p><p>The waterlogged hair was heavy, it couldn&#39;t move up my arm very far.</p><p>Instead, it has been twining and coiling around my abdomen and chest.</p><hr><p>“gh...!”</p><p>My body involuntarily bends back.</p><p>Suddenly, an indescribably pleasant feeling bursts forth from the center of my body.</p><p>Rider&#39;s hair was softly dashing against me, licking along my spine.</p><hr><p>“Fuu, that&#39;s odd... I feel as though I&#39;m drunk.”</p><p>“Ehh?”</p><p>While I&#39;m unable to move with my top half sealed by hair and the bottom by stone, Rider leans her back against me.</p><hr><p>“I shouldn&#39;t become tipsy or drunk no matter how much alcohol I drink though...”</p><p>“I see... maybe it&#39;s because of Tohsaka?”</p><p>“Um, did Rin do something?”</p><hr><p>“I used Tohsaka&#39;s shampoo in your hair.</p><p>She once told me that the hair of a female magus is their final trump card.”</p><p>And also that the ribbons she uses to tie it with are suitable magical artifacts.</p><hr><p>“So, Tohsaka&#39;s shampoo might have something special in... Wawaah.”</p><p>The ends of Rider&#39;s hair start to peck in the recess of my armpits and nip at my sides.</p><p>They were slimy and ticklish, it feels so good that I&#39;m getting excited.</p><p>I&#39;m relieved that it didn&#39;t cause any embarrassing physiological phenomenon, thanks to the fact that my lower half had been turned to stone.</p><hr><p>“I see～, that&#39;s... a good idea.”</p><p>“Uuah... what is?”</p><p>“Instead of doing nothing... while you&#39;re washing my hair... I&#39;ll wash your body... It&#39;s two birds with one stone.”</p><p>That&#39;s crazily sports-minded... or maybe not.</p><p>“Wait, that&#39;s too... Aah!”</p><hr><p>The tightly packed flesh-like hair was stuffing it&#39;s cheeks with my fingers, licking between them, swallowing them deeply and spitting them out.</p><p>...This is bad. I feel like something forbidden is occurring here...</p><hr><p>“Fufu... Please let me hear more, Shirou.”</p><p>The music box and cylinder exchange roles.</p><hr><p>“Uwa... aah...”</p><p>The gears keep moving.</p><p>My entire body is covered by comb teeth, with a caress that fully stimulated the tips of my senses scattered throughout, drawing out immodest sounds from me.</p><hr><p>“This is so... ugh... nngh...”</p><p>The gears keep moving.</p><p>In this bathroom shrouded in steam, I discover sounds from a place inside me I had never known, and my mind goes blank from the shame and excitement.</p><hr><p>“Fuu, not yet, just your voice is not enough...</p><p>Show me more of your face... Shirou.”</p><p>Is Rider also feeling more drunk from improved blood circulation?</p><p>My eyes narrow comfortably as my head falls against Rider.</p><hr><p>“Mmm... fua... Shirou, that&#39;s... my...”</p><p>I reach out my hand to support myself as I start losing consciousness, but my fingers unintentionally arrive at something soft.</p><p>Reaching out to anything I could, my unstable fingers dig into that soft something.</p><hr><p>“Shirou... Shirou―――”</p><p>Is Rider looking for an anchor to tether her consciousness to as well? She rubs my head, shaking it from side to side.</p><p>Dyed faintly pink, her white throat bends back defenselessly, exposing the undulation of the skin there as if lusting after even the smallest amount of air.</p><hr><p>My reasoning blanks out completely.</p><p>If this continues―――</p><hr><p>“Fufu―――mmm.”</p><p>Rider takes over and starts applying the shampoo herself.</p><p>Lubricated, the snakes now seductively writhe with even more sensuality.</p><hr><p>“―――ugh, ah... uh, uh... gh!”</p><p>Although so soft, the pleasure is so intense it feels as though they could tear my entire body apart.</p><p>All my body&#39;s senses sharpen, to the extent that I even feel her hair rubbing my inner thigh, despite that I should have no feeling there due to the petrification.</p><hr><p>“kh, ugh―――!”</p><p>I grit my teeth to the point of grinding them down.</p><p>My mind continues to blank out, and as though being boiled, my brain feels like it&#39;s evaporating. At this rate―――</p><p>Abruptly, and shamefully, I lose consciousness.</p><hr><p>“...ugh.”</p><p>Awakened by the sound of the water, I realize that I had fallen to the floor.</p><p>I had been freed from the clutches of her hair at some point without realizing it.</p><hr><p>“Have you regained consciousness, Shirou?”</p><p>“Eh...?”</p><p>“My eyesight has recovered.”</p><p>“I see... so, will my petrification continue too?”</p><hr><p>“No, Breaker Gorgon is still active. My loss of eyesight was only temporary.</p><p>You should recover from your state of petrification soon as well.”</p><hr><p>Just as Rider says, I can feel my senses returning around my knees.</p><p>I still can&#39;t move them, but at this rate I should be able to walk soon.</p><hr><p>“Aah... Sorry, I stopped while washing your hair halfway.”</p><p>“It&#39;s fine. I took the joke too far as well... but, umm, Shirou?”</p><p>Rider averts her eyes in embarrassment.</p><p>I look down, and the lower part of my body which has returned to normal is now―――</p><hr><p>“UWAAAAAAah!”</p><p>I quickly cover myself with a nearby pail.</p><hr><p>“――――――!”</p><p>But the pail was filled with cold water.</p><p>The strain of the thermal contraction covered me in fissures all the way to my brain, and everything in front of me turns pure white at the sudden sensation of recovery.</p><p>I sure have been acting pathetically this whole time.</p><hr><p>“―――No, that&#39;s not it!”</p><p>“Um...?”</p><p>“This, umm, this part of mine becomes like that just by being touched!”</p><p>“Okay...”</p><hr><p>“So, it&#39;s not that I&#39;m responding specifically to you, okay?”</p><p>“Umm... it&#39;s troubling for me if you keep staring at my body like that.”</p><p>“Uwawaa, s-sorry!”</p><p>“No, it&#39;s fine...”</p><hr><p>“Hm, but Rider, you don&#39;t seem to mind even if I see you...”</p><p>“―――No, whether human or a Heroic Spirit, in the end, as long as I am trapped in the body of a woman it is difficult to overcome the nature and honor of my karma.”</p><p>“Huh?”</p><p>“Because you treated me so well, I recalled something like that.”</p><hr><p>“―――Eh, that&#39;s...”</p><p>“..............................................”</p><p>“What kind of, thing?”</p><p>“..............................................”</p><hr><p>“........................Shirou, you perv.”</p><p>“――――――ugh!?”</p><p>My mouth hangs agape at her unexpected reply.</p><hr><p>“―――Thanks for everything today. If there&#39;s a chance in the future, let&#39;s do this again.”</p><p>After drying her hair, Rider quickly stands up.</p><p>She smoothly passes by me with her magnificently balanced limbs swishing back and forth like snakes, while I watch her with dumbstruck eyes.</p><p>“―――!”</p><p>Her long and wet hair following behind her brushed my shoulders in farewell.</p><hr><p>―――A few minutes later, I recover completely from the petrification.</p><p>“Hmm... that&#39;s strange.”</p><p>Maybe because Rider&#39;s hair caressed my entire body, or possibly because of Tohsaka&#39;s shampoo, somehow there&#39;s a strange itchy sensation lingering on my body.</p><p>The mere touch of my shirt on my skin gives me an odd sensation.</p><hr><p>“Ah, Senpai. Have you finished your bath?”</p><p>“Ahyaaaugh!”</p><p>Just by lightly grazing my shoulder, it felt like countless ants ran through my body from that spot.</p><hr><p>“...khh!?”</p><p>I involuntarily squat down and hug my body to restrain the innumerable legs wriggling under my skin.</p><hr><p>“Senpai...?”</p><p>“uHiaOUOUuuu!?”</p><p>Sakura places the palm of her hand on my back, and I feel an electric shock so strong my spine was about to break out into a dance.</p><p>I instantly swerved my body back like a toy with a spring coil.</p><hr><p>“............”</p><p>“Haa, Haa...gh!?”</p><p>Sakura slid her finger along the top of my chest―――</p><p>“Uahyaaaa! Shakuryaaa!”</p><p>A hysteric scream is squeezed out unconsciously from my throat by the itchiness that was gradually tearing my body in half.</p><hr><p>“Haa, haa, Sakura, don&#39;t touch me yet.”</p><p>“O-Okay...”</p><p>“Hiie, hiie, my skin is super-sensitive...”</p><p>“S-Sorry about that.”</p><p>“Haa, fuu, no it&#39;s alright, fuu.”</p><hr><p>“Umm... can I ask what happened?”</p><p>“Haa, um... yeah, I guess skin didn&#39;t mix well with the new soap I bought? Something like that.”</p><p>“...I see.”</p><p>“Haa... if I just rest a bit more, haa...”</p><p>“Senpai...”</p><p>“Haa, haa, hm?”</p><hr><p>“Senpai... no way... how interesting.”</p><p>I catch a glimpse of something like a wicked expression on Sakura.</p><hr><p>“Uwah... g-good night, Sakura!”</p><p>“Senpaii―――!?”</p><hr><p>“<em>sniff</em> <em>sniff</em> What a nice smell. It really stirs up my sadistic side.</p><p>It makes me remember the dream from that day when Grandfather, on his deathbed, left me a strange bequest to &quot;lead the world around by its nose!&quot;”</p><hr><p>“Bing! Wheeewww, I caught Shirou&#39;s screams on my radar like the sound of tearing silk. What happened, what happened?”</p><p>“What&#39;s with this uneven combination!? Ahyah!”</p><hr><p>“Eh, what?</p><p>―――Ahaha! Shirou! Catch me!”</p><p>“Illya! S-Sto-aaaaah!”</p><hr><p>“W-What was that, Shirou!</p><p>Your big sis has no memories of raising you to be that kind of kid!”</p><p>“Uhyauh! Fuj-ngaarh!?”</p><hr><p>“Aah, Senpai!?”</p><p>“Ahya, Sakura, kufu, these two...”</p><p>“Unfair, me too!”</p><p>“Whyyyy!?”</p><hr><p>“..................”</p><p>“Rider! Rider! Help!”</p><p>“...I have nothing to do with this.”</p><p>“Aaah, my lifeguard is...!”</p><hr><p>“Huhu, you won&#39;t get away, Shirou. Get ready to fireee!!”</p><p>“You mean that, Taiga? Alrighty!”</p><hr><p>“The killing technique of the archery club! Top Einzbern!”</p><p>“Yahooo! Oniiii-chaaan---!”</p><p>After Fuji-Nee grabs Illya&#39;s ankles, she spins her around and releases her like shot from a hammer throw.</p><p>―――That has nothing to do with archeryyy!</p><hr><p>“Ahyahyahahahaahoooo---!”</p><p>“I got Shirou! Look! Look!”</p><p>“Ahyahyahya, stop, hyahyahya, already...”</p><hr><p>“Why?”</p><p>“Why!”</p><p>“Don&#39;t imitate meeee! AhyahyahyahyahyahyahyaAAAAAaaa--!”</p><p>Carried away, Illya mounts me like a horse, and Tickle! Tickle!―――I can&#39;t take any more!</p><hr><p>“Ah... Senpai isn&#39;t moving anymore.”</p><p>“Oohh, Shirou, KO by fainting! How shameful!”</p><hr><h3 id="emiya-residence・start-of-night・good-night" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#emiya-residence・start-of-night・good-night" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Emiya Residence・Start of Night・Good Night</h3><h2 id="day-2" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#day-2" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Day 2</h2><h3 id="town・special-sisters-summer-apple" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#town・special-sisters-summer-apple" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Town・Special Sisters&#39; summer (apple)</h3><hr><p>Tohsaka and I made a promise to go to the pool together.</p><p>It&#39;s true that my aim is now to see her in her swimsuit rather than play in the water, but that doesn&#39;t change the fact that we&#39;re going to the pool.</p><p>It&#39;s a nice day out, and it&#39;s not like I&#39;ve got anything to lose, so here goes.</p><hr><p>“Tohsaka, got a minute?”</p><p>“Emiya-kun? Sure, what is it?”</p><hr><p>Tohsaka&#39;s room is as disorganized as ever.</p><p>...I just started talking to her without setting the mood or anything, but with Tohsaka it&#39;s better to be straightforward.</p><p>If I&#39;m roundabout in asking her, she&#39;ll probably make unreasonable demands on me again.</p><hr><p>“I came to ask you something.</p><p>―――Tohsaka, you remember that promise to go to the pool?”</p><p>“? You mean Waku Waku Splash in Shinto? Ah...”</p><hr><p>She goes speechless for about five seconds.</p><p>It seems like she&#39;s recalling all the things we talked about that time.</p><hr><p>“Y-Yeah.</p><p>...Since you brought it up yourself, Emiya-kun, I wonder if you&#39;re prepared for what that means?”</p><p>“Prepared? Well, you could say that.”</p><p>Seeing as it has come to this, I know I won&#39;t be able to face her at the pool with only half-hearted determination.</p><p>Of course, the desire to see Tohsaka half-naked is an ample source of resolve.</p><hr><p>“...Fine, then.</p><p>So, Emiya-kun, did you bring a swimsuit? Don&#39;t you think it would be a little lame if both of us were wearing our school competition swimsuits?”</p><p>“Of course I have my own. Tohsaka, you&#39;re really nagging me like you&#39;re my wife.”</p><hr><p>“Is that not good enough for you?”</p><p>“Nah, it&#39;s not that I have a problem with it, but I thought you would. Well, it&#39;s hard to say...”</p><hr><p>A school swimsuit would be no fun at all.</p><p>Uh, I mean that in itself is fine, since it does bring out the body&#39;s curves splendidly, but wouldn&#39;t one wear something more brilliant and showy for water leisure- wait! But that navy blue certainly has its charms! After all, simple is best, like the beauty of an unspoiled wildflower, right...!?</p><hr><p>“......I see.</p><p>If that&#39;s how it is, I don&#39;t mind.”</p><p>If Tohsaka&#39;s fine with it, then there&#39;s nothing wrong with the school swimsuit.</p><hr><p>“......Sorry. I was kidding just now.</p><p>What&#39;s wrong, Emiya-kun? Normally you&#39;d get all flustered and tell me to quit it just about now, but it looks like you&#39;ve got something else in mind.</p><p>Speaking of which, you&#39;ve been acting weird for a while. Really weird. Like you&#39;re suddenly anxious right when I think you&#39;re calm.”</p><hr><p>“Mrgh―――”</p><p>...Maybe so.</p><p>I&#39;m going to the pool with Tohsaka.</p><p>I prepared myself for this, but there&#39;s no way I wouldn&#39;t be nervous at all. And now I&#39;m thinking of what she&#39;d look like in a swimsuit even while I&#39;m talking to her―――</p><hr><p>“...............”</p><p>Not good. I&#39;m getting anxious over nothing.</p><p>Calm down.</p><p>We&#39;re just going to a local indoor swimming pool. It&#39;s not as if it&#39;s a fight to the death...!</p><hr><p>“......Okay, I managed to relax.</p><p>Anyway, it looks like we&#39;ve both got swimsuits ready, right?</p><p>Then there&#39;s no sense waiting. Let&#39;s go to the pool today. And as promised, I&#39;ll have you wear your swimsuit for me.”</p><p>I mention it again.</p><p>For some reason, Tohsaka gulps and says,</p><hr><p>“Fine, as you wish. It&#39;ll be a blight on the Tohsaka name if I don&#39;t meet your challenge.</p><p>But―――”</p><p>“But what?”</p><hr><p>“Do you remember exactly what I said, Emiya-kun?</p><p>This date is about equivalent exchange. In return for showing you my swimsuit, you have to listen to everything I say, right?</p><p>S-So, do you still want to see my swimsuit that badly?”</p><hr><p>“I sure do. I invited you with that in mind.”</p><p>Aren&#39;t you the one who asked me if I was &quot;prepared&quot; in the first place?</p><p>“I-I know that. I was just making sure!</p><p>...Fine, a promise is a promise. I-I don&#39;t want to hear any complaints from you after this!”</p><hr><p>And with that she chases me from the room.</p><p>Tohsaka needs to get ready, so we&#39;ll meet by the doorway in half an hour.</p><p>And that&#39;s how I set that promise into motion.</p><p>...You never know what might happen, after all. Better sooner than later.</p><hr><p>“Well, we&#39;re heading out. Take care of the house for me.”</p><p>“Look forward to some souvenirs, everyone!”</p><p>“Uh, we&#39;re only going to Shinto. I don&#39;t think we&#39;ll find any especially cool gifts.”</p><p>“I know, I was kidding. Just felt like saying it.”</p><hr><p>―――And so...</p><p>That pent-up cheerfulness gradually simmered down to a self-conscious silence.</p><p>I expected nothing more from myself, but I didn&#39;t think Tohsaka would be so quiet.</p><hr><p>“T-Then, shall we?</p><p>Oh, about the tickets, I got some for free.”</p><p>“Really? T-That&#39;s nice.”</p><p>...What&#39;s this?</p><p>Something&#39;s off. Tohsaka&#39;s being unusually meek.</p><hr><p>“...Mmhm. There&#39;s Waku Waku Splash now.</p><p>...I&#39;m so pathetic. Getting nervous now of all times...”</p><p>“Hm? Did you say something, Tohsaka?”</p><p>“N-Not really. It&#39;s my first time going, so I&#39;m hoping to be impressed.</p><p>A-And Emiya-kun, you sure look happy.”</p><p>I guess Tohsaka isn&#39;t interested in Waku Waku Splash at all right now.</p><p>But then she seems to mull it over for a second, turns back to face me, and gets fired up.</p><hr><p>“Okay, let&#39;s go!</p><p>Shirou, I hope you&#39;re ready for this!”</p><p>“Sure. Right from the start, I told you.”</p><p>“Ergh... w-well, time to go!</p><p>Change, say your prayers, and wait for me!”</p><hr><p>With that, Tohsaka marches into Waku Waku Splash.</p><p>Her bravado makes me feel like I&#39;m watching a tank rolling off to battle.</p><p>So that makes me the combat medic, following behind leisurely.</p><hr><p>“Now, meet me by the poolside in fifteen minutes!”</p><p>I split up with Tohsaka at the locker rooms, get changed quickly, and check myself in the mirror before heading through the gate.</p><p>You couldn&#39;t possibly expect the hot August sun in the middle of Autumn.</p><hr><p>“Ooh...!”</p><p>A blazing, blinding light greets the attending couples...!</p><hr><p>“Wow. They really made this.”</p><p>Artificial summer sunlight.</p><p>Azure sparkling as far as the eye can see.</p><p>As far as I could tell, the ad looked fake, but now I&#39;m honestly impressed.</p><hr><p>“I&#39;ll concede, people would definitely come here even in October.”</p><p>After all, it&#39;s like a tropical dome here.</p><p>If they went this far to recreate the atmosphere of fun in the sun, I think anyone would want to relive their summer memories here.</p><hr><p>“―――Okay.”</p><p>I pull out a beach chair to wait for Tohsaka.</p><p>Compared to guys, girls take a long time to change.</p><hr><p>―――Tohsaka&#39;s swimsuit, huh...?</p><p>I really want to see it... but maybe I should think about what absurd conditions she&#39;s going to lay on me.</p><hr><p>“..................”</p><p>I can&#39;t get careless. On top of the amusement she gets out of humiliating me, her years of experience also give her an advantage.</p><p>Well, whatever.</p><p>No need to over-think things. For now I&#39;ll just wait for her to come out.</p><hr><p>With her style and figure, Tohsaka would definitely draw attention in public.</p><p>With that much commotion, there&#39;s no way she could sneak up on...</p><p>“...............”</p><p>...Just now, I think I glimpsed a teruterubozu doll in the corner of my eye.</p><hr><p>“――――Oh yeah.”</p><p>There&#39;s no mistake.</p><p>That white figure fluttering over there is Tohsaka.</p><p>It&#39;s... rather odd for a swimsuit.</p><hr><p>“Heeey, Tohsaka... wait! Don&#39;t run away!”</p><p>Tohsaka stops at my call and reluctantly shuffles over.</p><hr><p>“S-Stop yelling! What if we run into someone I know!?”</p><p>“What are you talking about? Anyone can tell who you are from a distance.</p><p>And what is that supposed to be?”</p><hr><p>Tohsaka is standing in front of me, covered in a white bath towel.</p><p>It&#39;s like she&#39;s wearing a poncho.</p><p>...Don&#39;t tell me THAT&#39;S her swimsuit?</p><hr><p>“...C-Can&#39;t you tell?”</p><p>“I can. That&#39;s definitely one of our bath towels.”</p><p>“Oh. Yeah, I borrowed this.”</p><hr><p>Of course you did.</p><p>But it&#39;s not where the towel came from that I&#39;m wondering about.</p><p>I wanna know what&#39;s under it.</p><hr><p>“Tohsaka. You promised me you would let me see you in a swimsuit today.”</p><p>“......I plan to.</p><p>But hey, Shirou? Why don&#39;t we do this fairly?”</p><hr><p>&quot;Fairly&quot;... Hiding behind a towel isn&#39;t fair to begin with.</p><p>She likes using that word. I do not think it means what she thinks it means.</p><hr><p>“...What&#39;s &quot;fair&quot; supposed to mean here?”</p><p>“W-Well, if you suddenly see my swimsuit, you&#39;d have no choice but to accept my conditions, right?</p><p>S-So it would only be fair to let you have an opportunity to refuse, as well.”</p><p>“――――I see. So that&#39;s it.”</p><hr><p>Maybe that&#39;s Tohsaka&#39;s way of being nice.</p><p>I thought she was just being random, but turns out she&#39;s actually giving me one last chance to back out.</p><hr><p>“...Hmm. And what if I do refuse, Tohsaka?”</p><p>“That&#39;s something you don&#39;t need to worry about.</p><p>W-Well then, let&#39;s start the contract. M-My conditions for you are―――”</p><hr><p>I hold my breath, listening intently.</p><p>“...For today, you have to obey everything I say!”</p><p>Oh. Wait, that&#39;s it?</p><hr><p>“Sure. That&#39;s actually pretty easy.”</p><p>“Wha... Hey, this is absolute obedience! Absolute!</p><p>Like a Servant or a butler or a footman! Do you really understand!?”</p><p>“Yeah, I do. Isn&#39;t that how it&#39;s been all the way until now?”</p><hr><p>It&#39;s not much of a bargaining point if you ask me, but if that&#39;s all she wants I&#39;ll gladly take it.</p><p>And here I was afraid she was going to make impossible requests, or otherwise trap me in those evil genius schemes I know her all too well for.</p><p>...Nope, sometimes it&#39;s nice to be wrong.</p><hr><p>“―――N-Now that you mention it, you&#39;re right. Since it is my swimsuit we&#39;re talking about here, maybe I should add a twist...”</p><p>“No no, I think this is best.</p><p>So, what now? If you&#39;re worried about me holding up my side I can swear an oath or get it down on paper.”</p><hr><p>“...There&#39;s no need to go that far. I know you don&#39;t break your promises.”</p><p>She knows me well.</p><p>Now it&#39;s a fair exchange.</p><p>Which means it&#39;s Tohsaka&#39;s turn.</p><hr><p>“..................”</p><p>“――――――”</p><p>This is awkward.</p><p>I feel like I&#39;m on the verge of realizing a great accomplishment, but I can&#39;t make that last step.</p><hr><p>“...gh.”</p><p>But at this rate Tohsaka will definitely get angry.</p><p>I can&#39;t prove it, but I trust my instincts on this.</p><p>“...Ahem.”</p><p>I clear my throat once.</p><p>She&#39;s being uncharacteristically timid and you could cut the tension with a knife, but I have to say something!</p><hr><p>“W-Well! So the contract is now made.</p><p>...Umm, how should I put this? I... really want to see you in your swimsuit.”</p><hr><p>;</p><p>My throat goes dry, like I&#39;ve just swallowed dry ice.</p><p>Wait, that would kill me.</p><p>As if it were actually summer, the sounds of splashing waves are unbelievably loud.</p><hr><p>“..................Stupid.”</p><p>And...</p><p>The white towel falls away.</p><hr><p>Dazzling bright red.</p><p>A supple body wrapped in crimson.</p><p>...Like lemon in tea, like birds in the sky, like salt and pepper near a frying pan.</p><p>The swimsuit hugs Tohsaka Rin like they were meant to be.</p><hr><p>“――――――――”</p><p>...Crap. I&#39;m blushing from all the stimulation.</p><p>To be honest, I&#39;ve always suspected that people like me are less interested in the opposite sex than they should be.</p><p>But let me just say I&#39;ve been proven wrong about all that right here...!</p><hr><p>“......So? Are you satisfied, Shirou?”</p><hr><p>―――Loading comments.</p><p>I-I need to hurry and regain my senses and lock up the animal within me...!</p><hr><p>“Say something, moron! Seriously.”</p><p>“Gah... Uh, no, that, wait, sorry?”</p><p>“Now you&#39;re apologizing?</p><p>What&#39;s wrong, Shirou?”</p><hr><p>“N-Nothing&#39;s wrong! All I&#39;m saying is that tasty things are tasty, no, wait, dammit, this is hard to say but it looks good on you! You look so good I feel like it&#39;s a waste!”</p><p>“Well, that&#39;s interesting. Are you saying I&#39;m wasted on the swimsuit? Or that the bikini is wasted on me?”</p><p>“D-D-D-Don&#39;t be stupid! I mean I&#39;m not worthy to see it!”</p><hr><p>“Thank you. But you know what, Emiya-kun? You&#39;re definitely worth it.</p><p>You know, if I were to judge you as a girl, maybe I&#39;d say you have a pretty hot build yourself.”</p><p>She giggles happily.</p><p>W-Wait, what&#39;s a &quot;hot build&quot;...?</p><hr><p>“W-Well, I do work out.</p><p>...If we&#39;re together, I&#39;d rather be taller than more muscular.”</p><p>If I was just 5 cm taller, then Tohsaka probably wouldn&#39;t be embarrassed to be seen with me.</p><hr><p>“It&#39;s okay, I know you&#39;ll keep growing... Thanks, Shirou.”</p><p>“? For what?”</p><p>“It&#39;s a secret.</p><p>Anyway, negotiations are officially over! Get ready, because now the fun really starts!”</p><hr><p>―――And so...</p><p>We went back to treating her like a princess, as usual.</p><hr><p>...</p><p>It&#39;s summer.</p><p>It might be October, but there&#39;s no doubt that this world is soaking in summertime.</p><p>The setup in this all-weather indoor resort isn&#39;t enough to describe it. This room, this atmosphere... is the essence of summer.</p><p>I&#39;m carrying a tray with tropical drinks.</p><p>As for Tohsaka―――</p><hr><p>“Heheh, this feels a little like Paradise.”</p><p>She floats happily, without a care in the world.</p><hr><p>“What&#39;s wrong, Emiya-kun? You look like something&#39;s bothering you.”</p><p>“...Nothing. A promise is a promise, right?”</p><hr><p>While Tohsaka relaxes, I&#39;m playing butler.</p><p>Standing there, patiently holding a tray in one hand must look particularly odd against the leisurely surroundings.</p><p>As far as absolute obedience goes, this is well within my limits, but... once I come to my senses, it&#39;s not like I&#39;ll have no regrets doing this at a neighborhood pool.</p><hr><p>“Hmmm, this is great... I was just about fed up with that place. It&#39;s so depressing.”</p><p>“You mean England?”</p><p>“Yup, foggy London... sure, it sounds romantic, but it&#39;s really just cold and damp all the time.</p><p>If I had to vacation there, I&#39;d rather pick the City of Flowers. And if not Paris, then anywhere with a hot spring nearby would do.”</p><hr><p>“Are you serious? Paris aside, I don&#39;t think the Beppu or Kusatsu hot spring resorts would appreciate being known for having a magus around.”</p><p>“We were mingling with the scholars in Kamakura, you know? That was back in my grandfather&#39;s time though.”</p><hr><p>Kamakura scholars? What century are we in again?</p><p>Aside from Kiritsugu, Tohsaka, and the Matou, I don&#39;t know much about the other magi in this country. It&#39;s the first I&#39;ve heard of them.</p><hr><p>“Anyway, after being deprived of the sun for so long, I need a vacation.</p><p>Mmmm, I love summer. I wish I could just relax like this all the time.”</p><hr><p>She slowly floats up and down――</p><p>Tohsaka seems to enjoy floating in the pool.</p><p>The water&#39;s warm, and the rhythm of the waves is soothing.</p><p>Of course, I&#39;m just standing in it.</p><hr><p>“<em>yawn</em>...... Hmm, Shirou?”</p><p>“What? Want me to push you out further?”</p><p>“No... I was wondering if you wanted to go back with me.”</p><hr><p>“It&#39;s nice to come home for the holidays, but why don&#39;t we go to the beach over there?”</p><p>“The beach, huh... they have those in England?”</p><p>“Yeah, but just sunbathing in the sand is no fun.</p><p>If we go, we might as well visit southern France, like Côte d&#39;Azur or the Aegean Sea. The Mediterranean is supposed to be just gorgeous!”</p><hr><p>Tohsaka banters on.</p><p>...A vacation in the Mediterranean, huh...? As lame as it is, I can&#39;t think of anything besides a blue ocean and a white beach.</p><p>And being alone with Tohsaka... Crap, I shouldn&#39;t imagine any further.</p><hr><p>“That&#39;s pretty out there... What&#39;s the Mediterranean like?”</p><p>“It&#39;s like a paradise on Earth, I&#39;m sure.”</p><p>“A paradise, is it?―――The untouched beauty of the past.</p><p>I am also familiar with that area. Milos, Crete, Paros and Naxos, right?”</p><p>Wait. What was that, that strange answer filled with emotion.</p><hr><p>“Uwaa! What the!”</p><p>An amazingly beautiful woman, one that would turn heads.</p><p>She&#39;s wearing a swimsuit and not wearing glasses, but she&#39;s―――</p><hr><p>“...Rider!?”</p><p>“Hello, Shirou, Rin.</p><p>How unexpected to see you here.”</p><hr><p>A laughing and smiling Rider in a swimsuit... Am I dreaming?</p><p>I can even see her eyes. And I am not turning into a chunk of rock.</p><hr><p>“Rider, your glasses... no, why are you here?”</p><p>“Well, I just came to relax and play here. Just like you and Rin.”</p><hr><p>Oh. Whenever she has free time, Rider always seems to be engrossed in reading, so having her come to the pool is a bit unexpected.</p><hr><p>“...I did not mean to interfere with your day, but since you brought up my former home, I couldn&#39;t help but join in.”</p><p>“No, well, I guess... no, wait.”</p><hr><p>I observe Rider&#39;s swimsuit as stealthily as I can. Seeing Tohsaka was enough to make my head blank already, and Rider&#39;s no less competitive in that regard.</p><p>Or rather, the effect is different.</p><p>Hiding an ideal adult female figure with such little material should be considered criminal.</p><hr><p>“Is there something odd about me?”</p><p>“No, not at all, you&#39;re perfect, PERFECT.”</p><p>Translated into punch-force equivalent, this one&#39;s coming in at around one ton.</p><hr><p>“Is that so. Being praised by you raises my confidence a bit.”</p><p>“――――――”</p><p>Even if you ignore the swimsuit, having Rider smile like this is rare.</p><p>Being taken in by this sight is also a given―――</p><hr><p>“Uh, but what I meant to ask...</p><p>Rider, are you by yourself today?”</p><p>“Yes, I am simply taking some time off.</p><p>I came here to tail you and Rin―――is what I would like to say, but, unfortunately, this time was just a coincidence.”</p><hr><p>To tail us―――I can think of only one person who would ask that of Rider.</p><hr><p>“Well, I am probably bothering you, so I shall go for a swim over there.</p><p>Please take your time, the two of you―――Later. If you would like to know more about the Aegean, do not hesitate to ask.”</p><hr><p>And, without causing a single ripple, she disappears into the water, swimming away quickly... Her style is vaguely non-human-like, but also fitting.</p><p>As I keep looking in her direction... Ah, she&#39;s not coming up. Rider swims like a water serpent, vanishing swiftly into the water.</p><hr><p>“...Hey, Emiya-kun?”</p><p>?</p><p>Floating in her swim ring, Tohsaka does not look happy.</p><hr><p>“Ah, Rider was just here...”</p><p>“I know, I was also surprised. I didn&#39;t think we&#39;d actually meet someone we know.”</p><p>“Yeah, Rider was amazing. I wonder what happened to her Mystic Eyes? She wasn&#39;t wearing her glasses.”</p><hr><p>“Ah, don&#39;t worry.</p><p>She had hard contact lenses made to suit her outfit... wait, that&#39;s not what I&#39;m talking about!”</p><hr><p>“Emiya-kun? You were looking at Rider rather intensely, weren&#39;t you?”</p><p>“―――Ack.”</p><p>Those sharp eyes of hers... I have to tread carefully.</p><p>Looks like she&#39;s well aware of what her butler&#39;s doing even if he&#39;s behind her back.</p><hr><p>“I know, you&#39;re not the only one who thinks Rider&#39;s amazing. I&#39;m not even sure if I feel jealous or just shocked anymore.”</p><p>“...Oui. I am delighted to have your understanding.”</p><p>Still in &quot;absolute obedience&quot; mode, I reply butler-like.</p><hr><p>“Interesting... Then, what part of Rider did you see first?”</p><p>“........................Where, may you ask?”</p><hr><p>I&#39;m losing my composure under the pressure of my master&#39;s... I mean, Tohsaka&#39;s relentless interrogation.</p><p>The spot I looked at first is meant to be the part I was most fascinated with, in all likelihood.</p><p>......It&#39;s really a difficult question.</p><hr><p>“Oh, I just wanted to know if we looked at the same thing, honest～”</p><p>“...Well, but of course.”</p><p>If I lie, she&#39;ll definitely find out.</p><p>It&#39;s only natural for a guy.</p><p>Indeed, the very first thing I saw was...</p><hr><p>“...Your face is red? Oh you, Emiya-kun.”</p><p>“Yeah, I&#39;m blushing. Who wouldn&#39;t?”</p><p>A pool is that sort of place.</p><p>It is rude not to be fascinated by a woman&#39;s body!</p><hr><p>“Oh, you answered honestly. Good boy!”</p><p>“I humbly accept your praise... wait, where did you look, Tohsaka?”</p><p>“...The same as you, I guess.”</p><p>She splashes and kicks her feet.</p><p>I wonder... is she sulking?</p><hr><p>“Seeing such perfection, I can&#39;t help but feel inadequate myself. And then she has that body thing going on, you know?”</p><p>The parts that should be out, go out; the parts that should be in, go in; and the parts that should be long, stretch out longer. A truly perfect body... Ahh, I guess it&#39;s sort of how I feel about Archer or Lancer&#39;s height.</p><hr><p>“And here I was all worked up about finally having a chance to surprise you, Emiya-kun.</p><p>Well, it&#39;s Rider, it can&#39;t be helped. Things go wrong at just the critical moment, as always.”</p><p>She sighs.</p><hr><p>“Is that so? If you ask me who&#39;s better, I&#39;d say you are the cuter one, Tohsaka.”</p><p>I try to get her to acknowledge the fact herself.</p><hr><p>“――――――”</p><p>...D-Damn.</p><p>I said it without thinking, and now I&#39;m blushing at my own frankness.</p><hr><p>“...Ahh... hey, Tohsaka.”</p><p>I call out to break the unbearable silence.</p><p>L-Lending a hand when their master is at a loss is the duty of a butler...!</p><hr><p>“Sure, Rider is pretty, but not as much as you were, Tohsaka, when I saw you in your swimsuit.”</p><p>“...That kind of flattery is unlike you.”</p><p>“It&#39;s not flattery. Could I ever pull off something so convenient!?”</p><p>That&#39;s right. Clumsiness, in its own way, knows when it&#39;s time to set things right.</p><hr><p>“Listen, no matter how pretty Rider is in her swimsuit, I don&#39;t feel anything welling up inside me. All I can do is admire her.</p><p>...I mean, look. It&#39;s kind of bad to say about Rider, but it&#39;s the feeling you get when you look at Mt. Fuji or Niagara Falls.”</p><hr><p>“...Okay. Somehow, I get what you&#39;re trying to say.”</p><p>“Right. But when I saw you, Tohsaka, I was simply happy.</p><p>It&#39;s not that you win or lose in chest or figure, but you were very Tohsaka-like. I just don&#39;t know a way to put it in words...”</p><p>I nervously stir the water around my waist.</p><p>Tohsaka is also watching me attentively as she floats.</p><hr><p>“...To put it rudely: seeing you, Tohsaka, actually made me excited.”</p><p>“―――W-What are you saying in this kind of place? Geez...!”</p><p>I-It&#39;s just as embarrassing for me, so can&#39;t you put up with it for a bit? Wait, why am I seriously elaborating this!?</p><hr><p>“I-I don&#39;t mean it in the direct way, okay?</p><p>Anyway, you have plenty of charm. My heart&#39;s throbbing even now, and there&#39;s no need to worry about Rider at all!</p><p>Also, time is passing way too fast! It&#39;s already afternoon!”</p><p>“........................”</p><hr><p>Errgh, I can&#39;t stop by myself!</p><p>I&#39;m too embarrassed, I want to take this float and carry Tohsaka away with it somewhere...!</p><p>“Tch, wait, calm down, calm down now.”</p><p>That is improper for a butler.</p><p>&quot;Haa, hoo,&quot; I take two deep breaths.</p><hr><p>“......And that was a glimpse into the depth of your butler&#39;s mind.</p><p>That&#39;s how I feel. I have no objections against you forcing me into complete obedience, and I even manage to enjoy it, in a way.”</p><hr><p>Serving someone I actually desire.</p><p>There&#39;s a warm and fuzzy feeling of something like dominance emanating from it.</p><p>I feel I have a lot to be embarrassed by in what I just said, but for now, I just clear my throat and assume my waiting position once again.</p><hr><p>“Tohsaka...?”</p><p>“―――Geez. It&#39;s not like I can just ditch you and go off somewhere myself, either.”</p><p>Murmuring something odd, Tohsaka gets out of the float ring.</p><hr><p>“I did say that my hands are still burning.</p><p>...Well, I was the one to blame, though.”</p><hr><p>Tohsaka shrugs with indifference.</p><p>That seemed to be a reflection not on me, but on Tohsaka herself.</p><p>...And then.</p><p>“T-Tohsaka!?”</p><p>“It&#39;s fine. We&#39;re in a pool, this much is nothing out of ordinary.”</p><hr><p>“Kh―――!”</p><p>W-Was this girl listening?! I just confessed that I am still excited, didn&#39;t I?!</p><hr><p>“Oh, your heart&#39;s racing. You really were holding it in, weren&#39;t you, Emiya-kun.”</p><p>“T-That&#39;s what I was saying! So give me a little space here.”</p><hr><p>“No way～. And also, I just realized something.</p><p>Right, because you&#39;re still such a novice, it&#39;s my job to be the busybody, no matter what.</p><p>This is a duty that not even Rider nor Saber can get in the way of.”</p><hr><p>She smiles sweetly.</p><p>“............”</p><p>...Honestly, that smile alone fascinated me from the bottom of my heart.</p><hr><p>“...Keh. My apologies for being such a novice.”</p><p>I grumble in a butler voice.</p><p>“Sure. If you&#39;re frustrated by it, then become a man that can sweep me off my feet. I&#39;ll be looking forward to that day, alright, Mr. Butler?”</p><hr><p>So that is also a part of the right of absolute obedience.</p><p>...To think that a full-fledged magus also ought to be a gentleman... I had no idea. This might be a really valuable pool date.</p><hr><p>“Well then, talk about the future is over. Shall we enjoy today&#39;s pool now?</p><p>Come, they have a waterslide here, don&#39;t they? We&#39;ll be riding that first, then... Wow, they even have beach volleyball! Let&#39;s get Rider and play volleyball!”</p><hr><p>&quot;Yoo-hoo!&quot; she runs off merrily.</p><p>“Yes, yes. I shall accompany you, of course.”</p><p>As a butler, the option of disobedience does not cross my mind.</p><p>I too shall enjoy this to my heart&#39;s content.</p><p>After all, there is less than five hours to go until closing time.</p><p>I&#39;m sure the afternoon will go by in the blink of an eye, just like the morning did.</p><hr><p>“Aah, I had so much fun.”</p><p>“..................Are you satisfied, Tohsaka?”</p><hr><p>I managed to keep up with Tohsaka&#39;s over the top nonsense.</p><p>In the end, we played beach volleyball with some oddly familiar-looking tough guys.</p><p>I was told to &quot;make us win, Shirou&quot;... Even though I&#39;m pretty sure our opponents weren&#39;t human to begin with.</p><hr><p>“...You put up a pretty determined fight there, Tohsaka.”</p><p>“That&#39;s because my family tells me to never let up, no matter the competition. But we just weren&#39;t tall enough, were we.”</p><hr><p>...To beat those in two in height would take someone like Kuzuki-sensei or the late priest, Kotomine.</p><p>And with Tohsaka trying to match their momentum while wearing a bikini, the onlookers got very excited.</p><p>To sum it up, we may have lost the game, but we won in style instead.</p><hr><p>“Whew... Oh yeah, Tohsaka.”</p><p>“What&#39;s wrong? Do you need to head down to the shopping district for something?”</p><p>“No, not that. Our &quot;absolute obedience&quot; deal, when does it expire?”</p><hr><p>The deal I made with Tohsaka was for all of today.</p><p>Returning from the pool, Tohsaka has long since changed back into her regular clothes.</p><p>Seeing as we have left the place already, it wouldn&#39;t be at all odd for the time limit to have passed already.</p><hr><p>“......Do you want to continue?”</p><p>Absolute obedience, for all of today.</p><p>Taken literally, it could continue until midnight.</p><p>Besides, I feel like I don&#39;t want it to ever end.</p><hr><p>“Then, the contract is over. Is that okay?”</p><p>As if to sever any regrets, Tohsaka states that definitively.</p><p>As you say, yeah. I agree.</p><hr><p>“Right, then I&#39;ll make sure to be as defiant as possible, while I still can.”</p><p>“Oh, you&#39;re at that age already, aren&#39;t you. No worries, your teacher will always be here to listen to her students&#39; problems.”</p><p>“Nothing has changed, after all... As I thought.”</p><hr><p>“We&#39;re back.”</p><p>“I&#39;m back now, man I&#39;m tired...”</p><p>“Ah, we forgot about souvenirs. They even had Macadamia nuts and Hawaiian manjuu...”</p><p>“I see. Well then, let&#39;s get them next time.”</p><hr><h2 id="day-3" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#day-3" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Day 3</h2><h3 id="emiya-s・day-3-rin-and-high-tech" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#emiya-s・day-3-rin-and-high-tech" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Emiya&#39;s・Day 3 Rin and high tech</h3><hr><p>“...Phew.”</p><p>I loiter in the storehouse, surrounded by all the items I&#39;ve picked up.</p><p>It&#39;s nice and cool, and the scent of oil and rusted metal fills the air. It calms me down.</p><p>“Ah, the VCR. That&#39;ll be the next thing...”</p><p>Suddenly, as I&#39;m rummaging around,</p><hr><p>“----aaaaah---------!”</p><p>I hear a loud scream in the distance.</p><p>...The scream came from the other building.</p><p>It doesn&#39;t sound like Sakura. Then, is it Fuji-Nee, Saber, Rider, or maybe...? Well, it&#39;s probably okay.</p><hr><p>“Now then... As I thought, this looks impossible.”</p><p>Taking off the cover, I brush off the dust.</p><p>Even with a service manual, this is far beyond my abilities.</p><p>Furthermore, with appliances getting more and more modularized, it&#39;s getting very difficult for amateurs to even get inside them.</p><hr><p>“For now, they do say that these things often get thrown out as soon as the loader breaks.”</p><p>Spreading out my tools, I line them up on the sheet next to me, since it seems like I&#39;m in for a long haul.</p><p>All right then, let&#39;s take another look inside―――and...</p><p>“...............”</p><hr><p>I feel a storm brewing.</p><p>It feels like the pressure&#39;s dropping, clouds are forming and the wind&#39;s picking up.</p><p>Rapid footsteps stomp firmly on the ground―――</p><p>“..................”</p><hr><p>They&#39;re heading straight to the storehouse.</p><p>My eyes tell me it&#39;s Tohsaka, but in reality, it&#39;s a living typhoon of magical energy.</p><hr><p>“Yo, Tohsaka.”</p><p>I raise my hand to greet her.</p><p>“――――――――”</p><p>I feel greatly endangered, as if seeing my parents&#39; mortal enemy.</p><p>What the heck happened?</p><p>At this rate, next she&#39;ll fire a Gandr, and that would be the start of the Emiya Residence Storehouse Murder Case.</p><hr><p>“...Bathroom. You have one.”</p><p>“Which one? The one in the main building?”</p><p>“The outer building.”</p><p>Needless to say, this house is huge.</p><p>The outer building and the main building both have a restroom.</p><hr><p>“Water came out.”</p><p>“There&#39;s a leak? That&#39;s not good.”</p><p>There will be lots of damage if I leave plumbing problems unfixed.</p><p>Let&#39;s go repair it. I have some gaskets here, so―――</p><hr><p>“Not that.”</p><p>“Didn&#39;t it break?”</p><p>The way Tohsaka&#39;s talking in monosyllables is disquieting.</p><p>It&#39;s like looking at a dam on the brink of collapse.</p><hr><p>“...So what IS that? Shirou.”</p><p>“That...? Do you mean...”</p><p>Come to think of it, the Western-style bathroom in the outer building is the one that I took some effort renovating.</p><p>And while Tohsaka was gone, there have been several new state-of-the-art home electric appliances introduced in our household―――</p><hr><p>“Are you talking about the bidet?”</p><p>“Why didn&#39;t you tell me!?”*</p><p>Ah, the dam finally broke.</p><p>I&#39;m just standing there, dumbfounded, as a muddy stream of water surges towards me―――</p><hr><p>“You should have told me about that thing from the start! It&#39;s not like it&#39;s just an air freshener!”</p><p>“My bad, I forgot.</p><p>I don&#39;t use the bathroom over there―――”</p><hr><p>“All the more reason to say something! I nearly had a heart attack!”</p><p>...So that&#39;s where the scream came from...</p><hr><p>“...Yeah, the first time I used one, I somehow thought of a dentist. No, not that I had to visit one, I mean how you just have to clench your teeth and deal with it.</p><p>But Tohsaka, it&#39;s one of those things that you get used to, and then can&#39;t help but wonder at the convenience of modern civilization―――”</p><p>&quot;Amazing, I&#39;m surprised,&quot; Sakura also said. It really was a surprise. Anyone who experiences it can&#39;t help but tell the tale.</p><hr><p>“No one asked for your impressions, Shirou!”</p><p>“Tohsaka, was that your first time?”</p><hr><p>“Of course! I never even thought of doing anything like that!</p><p>I can&#39;t believe it. Who in the world, where in the world, what race of people could possibly think to invent such a satanic device!</p><p>Tch, the modern engineers are not to be taken lightly. That creativity, that effectiveness, truly, it&#39;s the work of a god, or a devil, or...!”</p><hr><p>“――――――”</p><p>She&#39;s getting carried away with that comparison.</p><p>Tohsaka seems completely astonished.</p><p>...Still. Her residence doesn&#39;t look like it&#39;d have a bidet, and with Tohsaka being so hopeless with any kind of appliances, I&#39;m rather worried about the mess she could have made.</p><hr><p>“By the way, which button did you press first?”</p><p>“Wha―――how could you ask such an embarrassing question!? And while laughing, too!?”</p><hr><p>“What I want to say is, hiding that thing, and then using it to make fun of people really gets on my nerves!”</p><p>No, I honestly regret it, ma&#39;am.</p><p>I definitely didn&#39;t mean it that way, but in the end, yeah, that&#39;s how it ended up being.</p><hr><p>“Ha, ha, ha.</p><p>In any case, it&#39;s rather convenient, so please make full use of it. Unfortunately, there isn&#39;t one for the Japanese-style washroom in the main building.”</p><hr><p>“Just who is it that goes to the washroom to enjoy themselves―――</p><p>Oh, so just in the outer building?”</p><hr><p>I nod.</p><p>I&#39;ve seen a Japanese-style bidet on the TV.
