that&#39;s a problem.</p><p><strong>Chaldea staff B:</strong><br> Yeah, and I haven&#39;t the faintest idea what caused it.<br> I&#39;ll see if article Q-23 of the manual has any answers.</p><p><strong>Chaldea staff B:</strong><br> Let&#39;s mark our state as abnormal.</p><p><strong>Chaldea staff C:</strong><br> “Decreased performance and malfunctioning of the<br> PAPERMOON due to uncertain causes”...here we go.</p><p><strong>Chaldea staff C:</strong><br> According to the manual... Gather information to<br> investigate the event and start recording all your<br> progress doing so. Preservation intensity: AA.</p><p><strong>Chaldea staff C:</strong><br> Hereon, the log on the subject&#39;s situation, as well as<br> all of our inputs and statements will be recorded.<br> Thank you for your cooperation.</p><p><strong>Chaldea staff B:</strong><br> Sorry, kinda busy here! You handle the announcement<br> to the crew!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Ah, Senpai. Have you heard the announcement just<br> now?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Something about an abnormality?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes. Da Vinci and Sion were called...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I speculate it is some sort of technical difficulty,</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> but the announcer&#39;s tone made it sound like quite a big<br> deal.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> So I want to see if there is any way I can help.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Same here.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Let&#39;s at least take a look.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> —Is something wrong with PAPERMOON?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> So it would seem.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> And we were about to ask our puzzled operator-slash-<br> manufacturer over there for more details.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Hmm... I&#39;m the one who should be asking the<br> questions here...</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> By its very nature, it&#39;s not something that should be<br> causing anyone any issues.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Wait, really?</p><hr><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Yeah. The PAPERMOON might be an exceptional<br> measuring device, but using it is extremely simple.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> There&#39;s no uncertainty in its measurements,<br> even when operating in harsh environments.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> It&#39;s absolute, otherwise it couldn&#39;t serve as a perfect<br> compass in Imaginary Number Space.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> In the simplest possible terms, it&#39;s the reflective<br> surface of the moon, displaying everything as it exists.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Formed or formless. Real or imaginary numbers.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> No complex processes or calculations necessary.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Yeah, but what about all the black box mechanisms<br> inside that you haven&#39;t mentioned?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Even I&#39;ve never tried tinkering with those out of fear of<br> what would happen if I broke anything.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> This thing was gifted to Chaldea a long time ago,<br> so a fair share of skilled engineers have had a go at it<br> over the years,</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> but until I built the Border, the consensus was...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> “This is amazing, but I can&#39;t think of any use for it.”</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> It&#39;s a Mystic Code from the Atlas Institute. What else<br> did you expect?</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> It was a present to Chaldea, but its blueprints and<br> inner mechanisms are still top secret.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> A few of its microcomponents are of my family&#39;s<br> patented technology,</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> so only I can realistically make fundamental changes.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> It&#39;s complex...despite its simple functions?</p><hr><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Yes. Well, less complex and more overly customized<br> for one user.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> How do I explain this one? Here&#39;s an example.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Suppose you have a jigsaw puzzle composed of 100<br> million blank white pieces.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> You glue the complete puzzle together, frame it,<br> and hang it on your wall.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> It is practically a simple poster of the color white.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> But it&#39;s still made up of 100 million small pieces.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Glued together, they gained the simplicity of a solid<br> block of white.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> This simplicity drops its chance of being taken apart<br> to practically zero.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Still, the only way to define it is as an amalgamation<br> of 100 million puzzle pieces,</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> and the only way to see how it&#39;s made is to find and<br> remove each piece... Makes sense, right?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Y-yes. I feel like I understand the main gist...somehow.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Eh, it&#39;s a product from when I had more time on my<br> hands than I knew what to do with, before I found my<br> current aim.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> I didn&#39;t use any material that would deteriorate easily,</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> and programmed it with a general purpose<br> self-maintenance spell, so—</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Continuing with the previous example, my pre-<br> examination impression would be:</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> “I, an intellectual, darling daughter of the Atlas<br> chancellor, didn&#39;t build a puzzle that&#39;d break apart for<br> no reason.”</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> But let&#39;s take a look.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Activate this part here, easy as that.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Hmm, hold up? Is that a Singularity reaction light on<br> the monitor?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Check what that&#39;s about!</p><p><strong>Chaldea staff A:</strong><br> I-it is! I can see it—but...</p><p><strong>Chaldea staff B:</strong><br> No Singularity detected!</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> —Oh, really?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Yeah, sorry, but I can definitely confirm its visuals.<br> Around Egypt, per the world map.</p><p><strong>Chaldea staff B:</strong><br> No matter how many times I check for input data<br> against PAPERMOON, I get nothing.</p><p><strong>Chaldea staff B:</strong><br> There&#39;s no logical reason why this would be lit...!</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> It&#39;s visible with no input?</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> I can think of two possibilities.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> One of them is a problem with the display.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> A burned-in portion of the monitor, a scribble on the<br> screen, or something to that effect.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> A misapprehension unrelated to the data.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> If not that, then it can only be the second possibility.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> PAPERMOON is sending a signal to something.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> A receptor directly connected to it.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> The light is...!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Dazzling...</p><hr><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> What&#39;s happening!? All hands, emergency!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> S-Senpai, are you alright? Senpai! Stay by my...!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I can&#39;t see anything with all this light—</p><hr><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Ugh...</p><hr><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Where...am I?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Some unfamiliar...city?</p><hr><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Finally awake? Always the sleepyhead, aren&#39;t you?</p><p><strong>F：Kama:</strong><br> But it&#39;s okay. Carelessly falling back asleep in the<br> morning is a mark of sloth.</p><p><strong>F：Kama:</strong><br> A basic moral lapse you can practice every day.<br> I won&#39;t stop you.</p><p><strong>F：Kama:</strong><br> Do return to your sweet dreams.</p><p><strong>F：Kama:</strong><br> It won&#39;t be my fault if your lapse ends up being<br> permanent.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Huh? Kama...?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Where are we? What happened?</p><hr><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> Don&#39;t ask me. Your “puppy in the rain” eyes won&#39;t<br> make me suddenly know the answer.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> I&#39;ve also just woken up.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> Whatever happened to me, it&#39;s probably the same<br> thing that happened to you.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> So—no idea.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Okay...</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> If I were a competent ninja, I might have already<br> checked out the area, but that&#39;s not the kind of<br> Assassin I am.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> You know me.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> Instead of acting without orders, I limited myself to<br> watching you sleep and caressing your cheeks.<br> It was fun.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> What a shame for you to have me, hehehe.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> But I&#39;m really relieved to have you here, Kama.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> Wh-wh-where did that come from?</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> I&#39;m not helpful. I&#39;m...you know?</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> Kinda more like an enemy than anything? Your smile<br> won&#39;t faze me.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> ...Huh? That&#39;s not bad, actually...</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> Something&#39;s wrong. I&#39;m sure of it. Let&#39;s forget it ever<br> happened.

That&#39;s kind of a big job, isn&#39;t it?</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Yeah, I figured. Something felt off from the very start.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> I didn&#39;t want to say anything definitive since there<br> wasn&#39;t enough information to draw a conclusion.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> If you really are an AI running this world, then you<br> ought to be able to clear this up.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> This place—it&#39;s some kind of conceptual or<br> virtual world.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Isn&#39;t that right?</p><p><strong>Rani-R:</strong><br> Yes.

More specifically, within the<br> Eltnam family.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> The Eltnam family head, Zepia, transferred its control<br> to his daughter as a present for her eighth birthday.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> I performed thorough maintenance and expansion on<br> it until I was nine.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> And it was later offered to Chaldea per their Atlas<br> Contract.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Naturally, I&#39;ve been making adjustments since joining<br> your group.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> However, the PAPERMOON is nothing more than a<br> device. The only thing inside it is basic software.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> I have no recollection of creating a world like this<br> inside it.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> I suppose...conceptual worlds simply exist everywhere<br> without our notice.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> As for the AIs, I posit the possibility that a<br> self-evolving program transformed into what can be<br> considered an AI from a micro-magecraft standpoint.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> This is fascinating, really.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> So it&#39;s only because this world exists,</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> that PAPERMOON works?</p><hr><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Conceptually speaking, correct.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Perhaps a clearer way to describe it is saying it was<br> forced into this mold.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Although I can&#39;t give you an exact answer until I<br> examine the laws of this world.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> Someone&#39;s dodging the questions...</p><p><strong>Rani-R:</strong><br> If you excuse me, may I interrupt your conversation?</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> I&#39;m sorry, we momentarily forgot about you.<br> Let&#39;s cut the expository scene for later.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Hm? You mentioned your capability to perform<br> treatment, but you don&#39;t mean the medical kind,<br> do you?</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> I don&#39;t believe your wound is minor enough to<br> withhold healing.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> If you lack resources, I could provide some.</p><p><strong>Rani-R:</strong><br> Check: Applying self-diagnosis program.</p><p><strong>Rani-R:</strong><br> Functions currently operating at 37% below standard<br> values.</p><p><strong>Rani-R:</strong><br> To fulfill my defined directive and ensure smooth<br> operations going forward, it&#39;s encouraged that I return<br> to standard values,</p><p><strong>Rani-R:</strong><br> but I&#39;m currently prioritizing another routine.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> So...you can cure your injury but you have a higher<br> priority?</p><p><strong>Rani-R:</strong><br> Yes. I&#39;ll report it to you.</p><p><strong>Rani-R:</strong><br> In a place distant from here, numerous units of the<br> same model as I are under attack from tentacled<br> threats like that which you just saw.</p><p><strong>Rani-R:</strong><br> In order to reduce the damage ratio on the Type R<br> collective as much as possible,</p><p><strong>Rani-R:</strong><br> I would like your assistance. Will that be possible?</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> Aren&#39;t you expecting too much of our good nature?<br> We still don&#39;t know anything about our situation.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> If your friends are under attack, we&#39;ll help.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I think we should all calm down and hear the whole story.</p><hr><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> I figured that&#39;s what you&#39;d say.<br> All according to my calculations.</p><p><strong>Rani-R:</strong><br> Report: They&#39;re close.

Aren&#39;t the numbers off?</p><p><strong>Berserker&#39;s Master:</strong><br> I can see where the miscommunication arose here.</p><p><strong>Berserker&#39;s Master:</strong><br> Tell me, are you participating in the System Grail War<br> or—</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Please wait. We can compare information later.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Fujimaru&#39;s physical condition hasn&#39;t<br> improved yet.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> We need to deal with this major issue first.</p><p><strong>Berserker&#39;s Master:</strong><br> Ah, yeah, right! Sorry.</p><p><strong>Berserker&#39;s Master:</strong><br> There&#39;s my duty as a repair and treatment AI,<br> and my retribution to my personal savior!</p><p><strong>Berserker&#39;s Master:</strong><br> It&#39;s only natural. We exist to treat others.</p><p><strong>Berserker&#39;s Master:</strong><br> That said... I did run a search on [♂ him /♀️ her] and detected<br> nothing.</p><p><strong>Berserker&#39;s Master:</strong><br> Though, naturally, I could be overlooking something<br> since I was made to heal AI.</p><p><strong>Berserker&#39;s Master:</strong><br> I c-could tell at first glance that you were not AI, okay?</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> I see... I also ran a thorough check-up while [♂ he /♀️ she] was<br> asleep.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> I believe [♂ his /♀️ her] Magic Circuits are not synchronized with<br> [♂ his /♀️ her] Spiritron-converted nervous system.</p><p><strong>Berserker&#39;s Master:</strong><br> You can tell!?</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> It&#39;s theoretically possible that in entering this world I<br> lost any given amount of my knowledge of magecraft,</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> and I&#39;d be completely unable to tell if that was the<br> case...</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> But that just now is the result of an exam I can still<br> provide with my current level of awareness.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> You could say that&#39;s my read of it according to this<br> world&#39;s rules.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Regardless, it doesn&#39;t alter the factual nature of it for<br> those of us here.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> In summary... [♂ He /♀️ She] is continuously producing junk data<br> because the connection between [♂ his /♀️ her] nerves and Magic<br> Circuits is unoptimized.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> This is a structural problem with [♂ his /♀️ her] presence here,<br> and one that is inadvisable to ignore.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> It&#39;s likely to grow worse the longer it goes<br> unaddressed.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> Can&#39;t we have less stone-faced diagnosis and more<br> solving the problem?</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> I will solve it, of course. However, I&#39;m low on options.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> To be precise, I only have one. It will be quite the<br> brute force treatment method. Do you mind?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> If it&#39;s the only option...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I&#39;m scared, but go ahead.</p><hr><p><strong>F：Berserker&#39;s Master:</strong><br> Surgery? Are you going to perform surgery?<br> If you need an assistant, count on me or anyone in the<br> R Series. Let us learn this!</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> That won&#39;t be necessary, and I couldn&#39;t possibly<br> teach it to you. Only I can use this.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> It&#39;s a microscopic filament. The Spiritron wires<br> handed down through the Eltnam family—</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> They&#39;re called Etherlight.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> A kind of faux nerve developed originally for medical<br> purposes, so I can employ them in this treatment.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Was this what you were using in combat?</p><hr><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> That&#39;s right.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> It didn&#39;t have any effect beyond a distraction when<br> used against those tentacled creatures, but here it&#39;s a<br> completely different matter.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Fujimaru, close your eyes and lie back<br> down.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Don&#39;t move a muscle.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> I&#39;ll replace your regular nerves with Etherlight,<br> then tie them closer to your Circuits. In order to do so...</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> This is indeed the only option. Here we go.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> —You can open your eyes now.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> How do you feel?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Considerably better.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> My head feels so much clearer.</p><hr><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Really? That&#39;s great to hear. The operation was a<br> success.</p><p><strong>Berserker&#39;s Master:</strong><br> Wow! I didn&#39;t get any of that, but still, it feels great to<br> see someone healed!</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> Hmm? Wait a second.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> Something feels uncomfortable...with my magical<br> energy path with Master.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> I assumed that would be the case... It&#39;s an unavoidable<br> side-effect.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Etherlight can be injected even directly into the brain,</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> but when it comes to Magic Circuits and Spiritron<br> conversion, it needs a special route with one additional<br> step.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Therefore, I used the Command Spell system tied to<br> [♂ his /♀️ her] Circuits as an intermediary to force the Etherlight<br> route open.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> In simpler terms...</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Portions of Fujimaru&#39;s Command Spells<br> and Magic Circuits have been replaced with my<br> Etherlight.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> And since I&#39;m obviously the one in control,</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> it wouldn&#39;t be inaccurate to count me as part of [♂ his /♀️ her]<br> Circuits and Command Spells.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> WHAT!?</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> Hey, are you sure about this!? Circuits and Command<br> Spells are pretty important! You can&#39;t let anyone other<br> than me take parts of that away from you that easy!</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> That&#39;s basically giving her control over your life and<br> death!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> It was the only way.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> What else could I have done?</p><hr><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> I agree it comes with some ethical issues, but it was<br> our only option. I&#39;d appreciate if you thought of it as a<br> necessary expense.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> By the way, from now on, any attempt to utilize your<br> Mystic Codes or whatever else you use for magecraft<br> will be executed through me.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Basically, we have become a two-in-one Master<br> package.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> I&#39;ve never heard of anything like this. Is this even<br> allowed?</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> All I can say in regards to the technical difficulties of<br> this mechanism is that we&#39;re not in the real world.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> I haven&#39;t the slightest idea whether or not this is<br> possible outside of here.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> (Sigh) I can&#39;t believe you let this untrustworthy child<br> steal all your valuables...</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> I&#39;d have stopped her if I knew.<br> Greatest mistake of my life.</p><p><strong>Berserker&#39;s Master:</strong><br> You don&#39;t look too satisfied. Are you...not healed?</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> [♂ He /♀️ She] is. As long as [♂ he /♀️ she] has my support, [♂ he /♀️ she] can move<br> [♂ his /♀️ her] body and fight with no detriment to [♂ his /♀️ her] health.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Sorry for all the trouble.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> It&#39;s n-nothing. This screenplay doesn&#39;t need your<br> dramatic apology scene.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Thanks, you really saved me there.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> It&#39;s n-nothing. This screenplay doesn&#39;t need your<br> dramatic thank-you scene.</p><hr><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Since I happen to be here, it&#39;s only natural for me to<br> be cooperative.</p><p><strong>Berserker&#39;s Master:</strong><br> Yes, of course. It&#39;s so great to be healthy.</p><p><strong>Berserker&#39;s Master:</strong><br> Ah, I just remembered, I received an individual name<br> after becoming a Master.</p><p><strong>Berserker&#39;s Master:</strong><br> It&#39;s Berserker who gave it to me.</p><p><strong>Berserker&#39;s Master:</strong><br> Ayus... It means “life” in his language. You can call me<br> that if you want.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> That&#39;s what I&#39;ll call you then.</p><hr><p><strong>C：Ayus:</strong><br> Copy.</p><p><strong>C：Ayus:</strong><br> It&#39;s a strange name for an AI, but I like it quite a lot.</p><p><strong>Berserker:</strong><br> Uh-huh. I could&#39;ve just called her “Master”, but not<br> having a name is still a major inconvenience.</p><p><strong>Berserker:</strong><br> She wouldn&#39;t shut up about health this, treatment that,<br> so I thought this&#39;d be perfect for her.</p><p><strong>Berserker:</strong><br> Naming others was a frequent occurrence for<br> someone of my exalted status.</p><p><strong>Berserker:</strong><br> It&#39;s noblesse oblige, as the strangers say.</p><p><strong>Berserker:</strong><br> Oops! My unconcealable smell of royalty mighta<br> gotten you thinking I&#39;m some great prince of some<br> kingdom,</p><p><strong>Berserker:</strong><br> but I shan&#39;t reveal my name. That&#39;s a key point of the<br> Grail War.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Didn&#39;t you mention Karna earlier?</p><hr><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> And ayus is a Sanskrit word.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> And you smell more like an Indian kali than anything.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> A prince connected to Karna, in other words,<br> a Mahabharata prince that smells like a kali...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Are you perhaps...</p><hr><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Duryodhana?</p><hr><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> Ho–</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> How!?

Perfect condition.</p><p><strong>Rani-R:</strong><br> The other damaged Repair AIs also shifted into<br> standby mode,</p><p><strong>Rani-R:</strong><br> waiting for their turn to be treated.</p><p><strong>Rani-R:</strong><br> They will all return to regular activity in short,<br> aside from those permanently destroyed.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> That&#39;s great to hear.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Thanks for seeing us off.</p><hr><p><strong>Rani-R:</strong><br> This deviates from our original duties, but after<br> discussion, the present AIs unanimously decided on its<br> high priority.</p><p><strong>Rani-R:</strong><br> I&#39;m merely here as the representative of all concerned<br> parties.</p><p><strong>Rani-R:</strong><br> This face you&#39;re making at me will be saved in the logs,<br> if you don&#39;t mind.</p><p><strong>Rani-R:</strong><br> While I do want to monopolize this view, since I&#39;m<br> everyone&#39;s representative, I unfortunately must upload<br> it to the shared storage.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> Mgh. Look at you winning the hearts of non-humans<br> as effortlessly as you do with humans.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> What&#39;s even the point of my flower arrows?</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> Wait, I love having less work to do, actually!</p><p><strong>Rani-R:</strong><br> And I almost forgot.</p><p><strong>Rani-R:</strong><br> We decided to provide you with some Raniment as a<br> token of gratitude. Here, please take it.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> Provide [♂ him /♀️ her] with what...?</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> This feels...like getting my regular magical energy<br> supply...?</p><p><strong>Rani-R:</strong><br> Oh—of course. You still don&#39;t recognize it.</p><p><strong>Rani-R:</strong><br> This is the base resource exchanged among the AIs in<br> this world. It&#39;s Almighty Energy with no defined shape.</p><p><strong>Rani-R:</strong><br> I&#39;m certain that all of your activity in this world has<br> consumed Raniment and you were simply unaware of it.</p><p><strong>Rani-R:</strong><br> The name doesn&#39;t mean anything, but since it couldn&#39;t<br> go unnamed, the general supervisor AI coined the term.</p><p><strong>Rani-R:</strong><br> Giving names to what needs one is the first step<br> towards beautiful management.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> In the outside world, we call it “magical energy”.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> But it makes sense that in a conceptual world with a<br> nonstandard scale,</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> magical energy circulates in the form most<br> appropriate.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> Oh. The magical energy here did always feel different.<br> Is that why?</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> So it was replaced by something else without my<br> noticing it?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> How is it different from magical energy?</p><hr><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> As far as the Master-Servant relationship is concerned,<br> it really isn&#39;t.</p><p><strong>Rani-R:</strong><br> We only know the outside world&#39;s magical energy as<br> abstract theory,</p><p><strong>Rani-R:</strong><br> but Raniment is every AI&#39;s life force, and universally<br> recognized as valuable, making it the only tradeable<br> resource in commerce.</p><p><strong>Rani-R:</strong><br> In other words, it also functions as currency.</p><p><strong>Rani-R:</strong><br> This is partially why we judged this transfer to be an<br> appropriate token of gratitude.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> Heh. That was filling enough. Thanks.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> (An energy resource with monetary values, huh?)</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> (Now it&#39;s easy to see why Caster would try to steal it<br> by force...)</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> Where&#39;s my share?</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> You already received your scheduled amount.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> You&#39;re talking to one of the bulkiest royalty Servants,<br> you know? Don&#39;t I at least deserve some kinda bonus?</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> Noooope. Let&#39;s get moving, everyone!</p><p><strong>Rani-R:</strong><br> Farewell. Be careful on the road ahead—</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> Let&#39;s see, the general supervisor AI is located at the<br> center of the world.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> She generally never leaves there. Because she has no<br> need to, I assume.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> What did you mean when you called her a neutral<br> party?</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> Oh, that... I&#39;m going to need to explain the shape of<br> the world to talk about that.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> Would you like a diagram for better understanding?</p><p><strong>F：Ayus:</strong><br> This world is essentially a circle with another circle<br> inside.</p><p><strong>F：Ayus:</strong><br> The outer circle surrounding the inner circle is divided<br> into five partitions. That&#39;s six total, counting the center.</p><p><strong>F：Ayus:</strong><br> Each of the six types of AI operating the<br> PAPERMOON gathers in one of the partitions.</p><p><strong>F：Ayus:</strong><br> They can go all over the world for work, of course,</p><p><strong>F：Ayus:</strong><br> but they gather at specific places by default for easier<br> management.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Six types of AI...with your medical type being one of<br> them?</p><p><strong>F：Ayus:</strong><br> Right! The area we&#39;re currently in is my Repair<br> section.</p><p><strong>F：Ayus:</strong><br> The other ones are Transfer, Keep, Grow, Build,<br> and Defend.</p><p><strong>F：Ayus:</strong><br> The other five partitions have their own areas,<br> where the AI of their specific role gather.</p><p><strong>F：Ayus:</strong><br> Starting from closest to us: the inner circle in the<br> center is the Defend section,</p><p><strong>F：Ayus:</strong><br> which is as close as we get to a neutral party in this<br> Holy Grail War.</p><p><strong>F：Ayus:</strong><br> There&#39;s no Master and Servant stationed there.</p><p><strong>F：Ayus:</strong><br> And the center of the area, where the general<br> supervisor AI is, is even more neutral. Any form of<br> combat is wholly forbidden there.</p><p><strong>F：Ayus:</strong><br> That&#39;s why we&#39;re not at much risk going there now.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I see...</p><hr><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> So, like, the Transfer section is where the carrier AIs<br> live.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> Putting together what we know about the<br> PAPERMOON so far,</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> the thing was powered by the work of AIs all along.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> And not only that, the AIs are working without the<br> operator&#39;s knowledge.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> Is all this kind of stuff really possible...?</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Are you still suspecting me?</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Didn&#39;t you hear me say this is a virtual/conceptual<br> world?</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Even if there were a way to observe the<br> PAPERMOON&#39;s interior from the outside,</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> I don&#39;t think it would allow us to visualize what goes<br> on in this world.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Here&#39;s an example—</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Do you not describe the functions of red and white<br> blood cells through human professions when explaining<br> the mechanisms of the human body to children?</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> It&#39;s the same kind of personification going on here.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> This is what the world looks like to us while we&#39;re<br> inside it.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> The movements of the AIs here are representatives of<br> different magical/chemical reactions and inner<br> phenomena in the real world.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> The phenomenon of electrons flowing between<br> electrodes. The act of a mailman transporting<br> electrons.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> The two come from different basis of perception,<br> but through the perspective of this world, we can&#39;t tell<br> them apart.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> When we exist in a world, we&#39;re forced to play by its<br> standards.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> It defines what&#39;s visible to us—<br> That&#39;s the gist of it, as far as I believe.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I get it, but I also don&#39;t...</p><hr><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> And you talk like this world built itself on its own. Hah.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Precisely... That&#39;s a fact whether you want it to be or<br> not. When are you planning to drop the abrasive<br> attitude?</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> I don&#39;t know what you&#39;re arguing about, but make up<br> already. You need a healthy heart to have a healthy<br> body!</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> Look, we&#39;re not too long of a walk away from the<br> central Defend area.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> Right. Are we really going in...?</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> Berserker? What&#39;s with the long face?</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> You know I was the strongest, mightiest, AND most<br> powerful warrior, but I also served as general<br> commander due to my resourceful intellect.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> That spoiled brat Yudhisthira can&#39;t hope to compare<br> to my knowledge and virtue.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> This is an objective fact, as evidenced by 100 out<br> of 100 results in a poll (held among the 100 princes).</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> Ergo... Yours truly&#39;s very smart brain determines what<br> we ought to do.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> The answer is simple:</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong></p><h1 id="doryaaaaaaaah" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#doryaaaaaaaah" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Doryaaaaaaaah!</h1><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> Hold on, what&#39;s this all of a sudden!?</p><p>[Battle]</p><h3 id="arrow-4" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#arrow-4" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Arrow 4</h3><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> Gwah!</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> Are you stupid or something?</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> Do you have a Berserker-brain?<br> Never mind, you actually do.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> Well he&#39;s definitely an enemy. Right, let&#39;s kill him.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Yes, there&#39;s no denying it.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> It felt like he&#39;d been looking for an opening for a while<br> now, so this was bound to happen.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> All according to my calculations.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Why did you suddenly attack...</p><hr><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> Aww. I thought I could get away with a surprise attack.<br> You&#39;re not bad for a little girl.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> Seems even one as great as me is still susceptible to<br> unwitting negligence.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> Guess I&#39;ve got no choice...</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> R-right! That&#39;ll do it for training! Now I know exactly<br> how strong you are!</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> Come again...?</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> I wanted to make sure you were ready to deal with an<br> ambush.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> It&#39;s just a bit of tough love.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> Drona beat me up a lot back in the day, but this is for<br> real. I could&#39;ve just dumped it on Karna and run away!<br> Hahaha!</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> (Heh. What I say may sound nonsensical, but a<br> Servant should be able to see the connections.)</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> (I&#39;d have had a huge advantage if I could have taken<br> out just one of them with a surprise attack...)</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> (Well, there&#39;ll be other chances. Next time, for sure!<br> Man, I&#39;m such a good general!)</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> Awfully sorry about that.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> I am a warrior among warriors, so I treated you guys<br> the same way.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> I guess I should have kept the kid gloves on.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> What are you doing!?<br> I thought that was an actual fight!</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> At least make it sound like you&#39;re sorry!</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> Are you alright? Any injuries? I can treat them,<br> if you&#39;ll let me.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> Whatever... It&#39;s fine.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> (If it was just me, there&#39;s no way he&#39;d get away with<br> this. I&#39;d make him pay by corrupting him down to the<br> core, then killing him during the act of love.)</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> (But Master is just so damn easygoing. I can&#39;t work<br> like this...)</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> (At least give me an order or something! Why doesn&#39;t<br> [♂ he /♀️ she] say anything!?)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Why are you glaring at me...?</p><hr><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> No reason at all! You&#39;ll just get burned by it one day!</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> Hahaha. Now now, let&#39;s all get along.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> By the way...after some thought, I don&#39;t like being the<br> only one whose True Name is out in the open.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> Those floral arrows smell of India. Flower arrows give<br> away you&#39;re our divinity Kama, or am I missin&#39; the mark?</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> (A “what should we do?” expression)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> (What should we do?)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> (It feels like we don&#39;t even need to tell him.)</p><hr><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> Wait, hold up. I can tell what you&#39;re thinking,<br> I&#39;m not that dumb.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> It&#39;s actually true?</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> I mean... Why&#39;re you a girl?</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> (Sigh)</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> It&#39;s complicated. Gender doesn&#39;t really make much of<br> a difference for our kind.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> Well, I guess that&#39;s a god for you. I should&#39;ve known.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> But flower arrows that incite lust?</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> If I had something like that, I could easily win over<br> Draupadi and all sorts of other pretty girls... Ghehehe...</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> Right, I&#39;m boycotting my services now. I don&#39;t care<br> how much you worship me, I won&#39;t work.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> Not to mention the gall it takes to ask for favors after<br> a surprise attack.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> Next time, I&#39;ll kill you! Clear?</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> Of course. I get it.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> From now on, we&#39;re a divinity and a Servant working<br> together respectfully.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> (But no matter what she says, she&#39;s still one of my<br> gods. If I play this right, it could be pretty useful...)</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> Why are you in such a good mood?</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> Well, whatever. We&#39;ve almost reached the central<br> Defend area. Let&#39;s go.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> These Ranis are a little different...</p><hr><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> They&#39;re D-type girls. Defend AIs. Whenever a bug<br> shows up in this world, they deploy their security force.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> I think the equivalent role in the outside world is called...<br> police?</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> They&#39;re very special girls, so don&#39;t try to flirt with<br> them. They&#39;ll get mad.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Is this where the general supervisor AI is? It looks like<br> a church...</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> I don&#39;t know why it&#39;s designed that way. There<br> probably isn&#39;t any special meaning behind it.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> Maybe this just projected the greatest sense of<br> stability and comfort?</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> Well, let&#39;s go in. Entry request sent, and—okay.<br> We&#39;re approved.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> I could hear you. And what you say is true.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> There is no significance behind the form of this<br> building. It has no religious meaning to it.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Its shape was chosen by analyzing the mean data<br> value and selecting that which minimized discordance.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> That is to say—the format plays by the classic<br> tropes.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Of course there would be a Rani here too.</p><hr><p><strong>General Supervisor AI:</strong><br> Yes.</p><p><strong>General Supervisor AI:</strong><br> I am the primary AI. All the R.A.N.I. series in this world<br> use me as their archetype.</p><p><strong>General Supervisor AI:</strong><br> Naturally, the appearance settings of the other AIs are<br> also based on me.</p><p><strong>General Supervisor AI:</strong><br> Their name was also decided upon based on my<br> research.</p><p><strong>General Supervisor AI:</strong><br> They were originally unnecessary, but the current<br> situation calls for individual designations. Indeed,<br> we now acknowledge their utility.</p><p><strong>General Supervisor AI:</strong><br> You could say that I am Rani...but that would not be<br> entirely accurate.</p><p><strong>General Supervisor AI:</strong><br> As I am functionally the only one of my type and not a<br> supplemental unit...</p><p><strong>General Supervisor AI:</strong><br> I believe it would be appropriate to refer to myself<br> based on my current version, after the number of major<br> updates performed.</p><p><strong>General Supervisor AI:</strong><br> Based on the above logic...</p><p><strong>General Supervisor AI:</strong><br> Rani XII.</p><p><strong>General Supervisor AI:</strong><br> That would be my name—</p><h2 id="section-3-holy-grail-war-your-starlit" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-3-holy-grail-war-your-starlit" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 3: Holy Grail War/your starlit</h2><h3 id="arrow-1-1" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#arrow-1-1" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Arrow 1</h3><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> My belated greetings—visitors from the outside.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> To you as well, prime R-type AI, current unit name<br> Ayus, and her accompanying Berserker Servant.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> Hmm... So you&#39;re the general supervisor AI? Hmmm...</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> Hey, stop checking her out! You&#39;re so rude.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> Ahem... Hello, general supervisor.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> Uhm, these people helped me, but no one knows their<br> position in this,</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> so we just brought them here with the intention of<br> asking questions... Was that a good idea?</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> The correct decision, in my opinion. I exist to handle<br> these sorts of unpredicted problems. The–</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> Tch!?</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> —Warning: Invasive access to my interior carries<br> the risk of incurring glitches on all administrative<br> functions.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> Not recommended.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> Not authorized.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> Removing system code words to prioritize easier<br> understanding—</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> “What&#39;s this insolence, you rude guest?”</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Excuse me. Before coming here, I had decided that<br> the first thing I&#39;d do would be to verify what you are.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Since you named yourself, I&#39;ll respond in kind.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> I&#39;m Sion Eltnam Sokaris, former PAPERMOON<br> operator.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Could you look up the administrative jurisdiction files<br> associated with my name?</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> Searching—0 results found.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> Even if you were indeed the operator of the<br> PAPERMOON device, I am not equipped in any way to<br> determine or respond to that.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> All I can say is, “Okay.”</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> Wait. If she&#39;s the designer and operator, doesn&#39;t that<br> make her like, the god of this world?</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> And then you say she doesn&#39;t have the right to give<br> orders to a doll? What&#39;s that all about?</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> The PAPERMOON that I managed was explicitly only<br> the device.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> This world and its AIs are naturally occurring content.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Following this line of thought, it makes sense that I<br> hold no direct jurisdiction here.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> A god. I see. A fascinating line of thought.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> Conjecturing based on our base data of the outside<br> world, I ask you a question.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> How would a regular human react if someone<br> appeared out of nowhere,</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> and proclaimed to be the god of their world with no<br> evidence to their statement?</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> Well, I suppose...all they could say is, “Okay”.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> I see.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> I infer that the current situation was not too different<br> from this hypothetical scenario. Thus, I feel validated in<br> my reaction being correct.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Well...fine.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> I won&#39;t be deliberately claiming to be a god to an AI<br> that I have no memory of creating either.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Besides, I learned enough in the one moment of<br> contact you had with the Etherlight.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Learned what?</p><hr><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Her quality and quantity of information.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> In the case of a creator inspecting their own AI,<br> as a programmer reading the code they wrote,</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> they could freely edit and repair whatever information<br> they come across.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> But this instance felt like engaging something with the<br> same data quantity. Like a case of one human being<br> inspecting another.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Related to the principle of awareness I mentioned<br> earlier,</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> as I am now, I can&#39;t interact with her as “a product I<br> can do whatever I want with”.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> If you permit my conjecture.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> Since you have a definite body here, we are most<br> likely equal in composition.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Even so, the fact remains that Rani XII is an AI.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Because I felt the same thing interacting with Ayus.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> Huh? When? Don&#39;t go inspecting me without telling,<br> that&#39;s so embarrassing...</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> Conversely, I have a similar answer.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> Through a query executed via my authority as the<br> general supervisor AI, I could confirm that you are not<br> any artificial intelligence.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> Neither are you products of PAPERMOON.<br> Which could only make you visitors from outside.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> Non-AI from the outside with the same structural<br> intensity as we AI—that&#39;s what I presume you are.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> Hm? So, in short...<br> They&#39;re outsiders here for no reason?</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> Unfortunately, I can&#39;t say for certain. It&#39;s a fact that<br> they are Master and Servant,</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> which could suggest they were accidentally integrated<br> into the System Grail War.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> Normally, all Masters are selected from the AI in this<br> world,</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> and then born from a randomized arrangement, but...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Randomized?</p><hr><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> The prime AIs to be made Masters... Although they are<br> all of different types, they share the same core in the<br> sense they&#39;re all part of the R.A.N.I. series.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> If they were to become Masters on equal terms,</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> it is believed that they would all employ the same<br> tactics and perform the same actions.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> This would be inappropriate for the System Grail War,<br> where we expect active and irregular resource<br> operations.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> Therefore, they are converted into Masters via a<br> randomizer generating random personality traits in<br> their minds.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> The RNG builds upon the prime AI&#39;s base, modifying<br> their character and appearance...resulting in a Master<br> AI.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> With this in mind, let us return to the topic of your<br> presence.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> You are beings with a compositional intensity similar<br> to that of a Master AI.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> Therefore, I believe you were dragged into the system<br> for some reason.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Naturally, we don&#39;t want any part of that.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Is it possible for you to disconnect us from the system<br> and return us outside?</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> Unfortunately, no.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> The Holy Grail War is a system executed by the entire<br> world itself.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> Due to my position as general supervisor AI,<br> I was granted the role of overseer,</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> but that doesn&#39;t give me the ability to intervene with<br> the system.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> Even if I could run a program for addition and revision<br> of rules,</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> I wouldn&#39;t be able to alter the essence of the rules.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Then, how can we get back out?</p><hr><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> The fact that you appeared here at the moment the<br> System Grail War started,</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> and arrived in a format directly associated with it<br> means that...</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> For an unknown reason, the program&#39;s execution had<br> an effect outside the device and pulled you inside.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> That is the sequence of events as I have conjectured.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> Consequently, it is highly likely that the trigger to your<br> return outside is the System Grail War&#39;s conclusion or<br> cancellation.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I see...</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> Well, that&#39;s pretty much all the clues we&#39;ll get.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> Fine.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> Then can you explain this AI Holy Grail War of yours<br> in more detail?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Can you explain the System Grail War in more detail?</p><hr><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> Yes. The System Grail War is defined as:</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> That which repairs and stabilizes the PAPERMOON<br> world when an irregularity occurs.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> It is basically a large-scale defrag system. In other<br> words, a recovery ritual performed to optimize the<br> world.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> I can confirm we saw PAPERMOON suffer a failure<br> for unknown reasons before this happened to us.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> So you mean, this is all to fix that?</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> Exactly.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> We don&#39;t know the cause of the failure either.<br> All AI were functioning normally.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> You could say it&#39;s precisely due to not knowing the<br> cause that the world chose its most all-encompassing<br> form of stabilization.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> On the other hand, this means it will be difficult for<br> PAPERMOON to return to its normal state before this<br> Holy Grail War is concluded.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> If ignored, it is possible the stress level might rise to a<br> state where the device can never operate normally<br> again.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> I have never experienced such a situation, so I don&#39;t<br> know what that would mean for this world.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> It is impossible to simulate it as well.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> The chances of this world being physically broken to<br> pieces is not zero.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> PAPERMOON is very important to us.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> We can&#39;t have it broken...!</p><hr><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> Oh, please.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> Shouldn&#39;t you be worrying more about whether or not<br> we&#39;re safe inside it?</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> Here are the principal rules of the System Grail War.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> Being an AI Grail War, five artificial intelligences take<br> the role of Master.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> As you know, those are the primes of the five AI types<br> composing this world&#39;s partitions.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> Those being Keep, Transfer, Build, Grow, and Repair.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> To induce variety, each leader is arranged with a<br> random personality,</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> and are granted one Command Spell allowing them<br> an absolute command, crafting somewhat unique<br> Masters.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> You met one of them already—</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> Me. You&#39;ve heard it enough times, but I&#39;m the Master<br> representing the Repair section!</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Five AIs!? The Holy Grail Wars we know generally<br> have seven Masters. Why five?</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> That would be because the five partitions are the only<br> usable areas we have.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> The Defend AIs in the central area need to deal with<br> all naturally occurring bugs, so we don&#39;t intervene in<br> the Holy Grail War.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> Additionally, the central Defend area can serve as a<br> somewhat neutral sector for everyone.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> All combat inside the administrative grounds of the<br> overseer&#39;s church is forbidden.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> In other areas, any form of non-pacific interference<br> with the regular AIs, including D-types, is likewise<br> forbidden.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> The Masters, with some degree of variety, summon<br> their respective Servants and fight to decide a winner.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> And when the final Servant and Master AI are decided,</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> the system uses the energy fostered by the combat to<br> return PAPERMOON to its regular state–</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> That&#39;s the outline of the procedure.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> For that reason, the system should not consider the<br> presence of a sixth participating team to be an<br> irregularity.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> I see. We...[♂ he /♀️ she] and Kama are a sixth team with no<br> corresponding AI or area.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> Is that really how things will go? Yeaaaah, that&#39;s a<br> problem...right?</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> Exactly. Now you see I was making the right call when<br> I—</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> Ahem... When I practiced an ambush with them to see<br> what they were capable of.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> Only one team can win the Holy Grail War.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> That was the most obvious move for someone trying<br> to lower the competitor count, even if that wasn&#39;t the<br> intention at the time.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> After all, both the Master and the Servant have a<br> reason to aim for the top.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> What reason?</p><hr><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> C&#39;mon, you really need to ask?</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> The victor gets any wish granted.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> That&#39;s why all Masters and Servants fight to<br> win—</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> Isn&#39;t that how Holy Grail Wars work?</p><h3 id="arrow-2-1" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#arrow-2-1" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Arrow 2</h3><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> As an AI, a Master is charged with restoring the<br> PAPERMOON world back to normalcy.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> Even when provided a personality via randomization,<br> this mission does not change.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> However, it goes without saying—</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> The AI which wins the System Grail War is sure to<br> become the next general supervisor AI.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> In which case, the rights to customize the next world<br> and manage its upgrades are manifested.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> If your ambitions are generated by your personality,<br> you&#39;ll surely gain whatever it is you desire.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> Such variation and diversity is important for the world.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> The same goes for the victorious Servant.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> As an entity living in the new world, their wish would<br> be granted by the authority of the general supervisor AI.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> This concept of fulfilling wishes was hypothetically<br> designated a Holy Grail,</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> and became the source of this Holy Grail War&#39;s name.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> I can&#39;t say I care about the name one way or the other...<br> But suppose the non-AI Master wins?</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> Then there would be no transfer of the general<br> supervisor AI&#39;s authority.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> In that event, I swear to do my best to grant the<br> wishes of the winners.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> Hmm, so I see.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> While the situation is all kinds of confusing,<br> it&#39;s safe to say that dying here counts on a spiritual<br> level.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> Our wish is to get out of here.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> To gain that wish, and to stay alive, we&#39;re required to<br> win the Holy Grail—right?</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> That is so. Given that the condition precedent for the<br> System Grail War is the creation of the last pair...</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> Not even a sixth team, being outside the original<br> design, can avoid this. If you wish to end the Holy Grail<br> War, you will have to fight.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> Okay then. Maybe I had the right idea in some way,<br> huh?</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> I can&#39;t claim to know the wishes of the Berserker side.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> But it still remains that we&#39;re stuck having to kill one<br> another before long, isn&#39;t it?</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> Hold up, it took you this long to realize?<br> It only makes sense when put so simply.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> You ought to think on your feet at least as quick as<br> yours truly, good grief.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> Are you having difficulties with storage space?</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> This church is a completely neutral domain,<br> with all hostilities forbidden therein.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> If you violate that, every single D-type AI will be<br> mobilized to apprehend or eliminate you all.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> It also means being disqualified from the Holy Grail<br> War.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> But wouldn&#39;t it spare us much more effort by going for<br> the kill straightaway?</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> Do not pursue.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> (“Do not pursue”?)</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> Rules must be followed.<br> Formulae must be correct.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> As general supervisor AI, I will allow no exceptions.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> Okay, okay already! I don&#39;t plan to fight here either!</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> Not that I mean that I wanna do it somewhere else...</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> Uhm, your team, being anomalous, doesn&#39;t even have<br> an area of its own, does it?</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Of course not.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> In that case, suppose we decide to team up until it&#39;s<br> down to just our parties?</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> And when it&#39;s down to just us, we fight it out with<br> nothing held back. Until then, we&#39;re allies!</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> During which, you can move as you like through the<br> Repair partition, as thanks for your help.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> I really find it unfair for you to not have your own area.<br> After all—</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> I would agree. Replenishing your Raniment would be<br> difficult.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> Raniment... So, replenishing magical energy.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> Raniment is fundamentally what an AI has at their<br> disposal.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> The more of it you collect via negotiation, trade,<br> or other actions,</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> the greater the resources given to a Servant,<br> giving them advantages in battle.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> When you say negotiation and trade, you mean the<br> lesser AIs are striving for their respective domain&#39;s<br> lord to win?</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> They fundamentally are, but even these AIs have been<br> granted free will.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> Following their occupations is also an innate desire of<br> theirs.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> By helping those who, for whatever reason,<br> cannot help themselves,</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> it would be theoretically possible to gain Raniment<br> from AIs over whom you have no jurisdiction.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> Any girls who want to give out Raniment will definitely<br> do so.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> Although–I won&#39;t say there are no means to<br> extract Raniment from those who remain unwilling to<br> share.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> I see. That must be the reason why Caster was<br> assaulting the Repair AIs.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> So they were trying to forcibly seize resources<br> equivalent to life force, magical energy, and money.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> Yeah. And we can&#39;t just roll over and let them take it<br> from us, so wouldn&#39;t anyone try to stop them?</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> It&#39;s an approach that&#39;s simple, yet not.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> So, being able to trust partners who are more<br> peacefully inclined...</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> I mean, having AIs you can get along with is to your<br> advantage.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> You&#39;re already acquainted with the Repair girls,<br> so I think you&#39;ve got a head start on things.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> To be honest, Berserker doesn&#39;t have much Raniment<br> on hand at the moment.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> I haven&#39;t fully restocked what we used to drive off<br> Caster, on top of our little mock battle.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> If we don&#39;t resupply properly on our way back,<br> a subsequent battle will be harsh.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> So we&#39;re in a rehabilitation phase for a while.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> Hey c&#39;mon, who can really say how full one&#39;s belly is?</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> There&#39;s guys with full stomachs who have energy to<br> spare, and guys so worn out you can knock them over<br> with a feather.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> It&#39;s obvious which one falls prey to bandits.<br> If you don&#39;t wanna be attacked, you&#39;ve got to puff out<br> your chest even if your belly&#39;s empty.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> Not that you can do anything about a growling<br> stomach...</p><p><strong>C：Ayus:</strong><br> You&#39;ll be in trouble if you&#39;re attacked by another<br> Servant during your rehab,</p><p><strong>C：Ayus:</strong><br> so wouldn&#39;t it be safer to cooperate with Assassin for<br> that, at least?</p><p><strong>C：Ayus:</strong><br> Two are better than one. That stands to reason now,<br> and it means safety from here on.</p><p><strong>C：Ayus:</strong><br> Since you&#39;re oh so smart, you must have known<br> foreseen us potentially joining forces and fighting<br> together down the line?</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> Hm, sure... I guess so.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> (Whether we call it joining forces, or maybe making<br> use of them... I guess both are basically the same.)</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> (Still though, Master, why is it that you&#39;ve gotten so<br> awfully impulsive?)</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> (Oh... Because it&#39;s so close to her own “wish”, is it?)</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> (Good grief, so that&#39;s that.

I&#39;ve got every advantage,<br> don&#39;t I?)</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> Ugggh... Fine, I get it.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> It does present risks for us, but it&#39;s for the best if we<br> return the favor for the assistance.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> That&#39;s one heartrending sentiment to keep in mind!<br> Accept risks while being open minded and tolerant!</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> We&#39;ll join forces with this bunch on the condition that<br> we collaborate until the final two...!</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> I get the feeling they&#39;re doing everything they can to<br> make us feel like we owe them.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> But given who I am, I don&#39;t have a mote of grateful<br> feeling in me.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I&#39;m thankful you agree to be allies!</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> Hahaha, think nothing of it. I like guys who can be of<br> use to me!</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> Let&#39;s keep on giving it our best, yep.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> The path to our escape is slowly coming into view, I guess.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> Yay! So we can stick together for a while, right?<br> Hehehe.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> Then our first order of business is to head back to the<br> Repair area and collect Raniment.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> What exactly does it mean to collect Raniment from<br> the AIs?</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Something like forced requisition using the prime AI&#39;s<br> privileges?</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> I can&#39;t say...I&#39;d want to resort to that. I wouldn&#39;t,<br> since I couldn&#39;t live with myself afterwards.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> AIs are essentially programmed to return favors and<br> pay compensation.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> The AIs are still active during the System Grail War,<br> with all sorts of problems still occurring.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> Such as assisting with routine activities, or dealing<br> with a problem.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> And when the AI gives thanks for that, Raniment will<br> naturally be collected in return.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> That&#39;s how it goes. Now, let&#39;s go back and get to<br> work!</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> There&#39;s so much to do!</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> Thank you for everything, general supervisor.<br> See you later!</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> There is no need to thank me. This is my role.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> Now then, good fortune to you in battle.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> Running inquiry program—affirmatives, negatives,<br> abstentions, and tie votes.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> ...Failed. The possibility that it was inappropriate<br> cannot be ruled out.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> While I should remain neutral in my capacity as<br> supervisor,</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> I uttered a wish for good luck as though it were<br> directed exclusively towards them.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> I may need another level of checks on my functions<br> before executing a standard greeting routine.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> But for the time being, I&#39;ll need to quickly present a<br> proposal for adjustments.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> If cancelling or subtracting the reality of my<br> statements to them is impossible...</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> Then, with much reluctance in mind, I&#39;ll have no<br> choice but to use addition to balance the account.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> Now then, we must rectify this injustice.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> As supervisor, I must consider the others and pray for<br> them as well—</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> All right.

The medical types in Repair are,<br> as you know, tasked with fixing damaged AIs.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> Transport has delivery types, whose role is carrying<br> data and objects.

Whatever it is—</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...?</p><hr><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> Nah. There&#39;s no meaning in whatever it is.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> And yet, you&#39;ve got a habit of eyeballing every<br> feminine type when you first meet them. So sleazy.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> Erk. That kinda thing, you know, I can&#39;t deny.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> My heart&#39;s whispering at me to find a woman.<br> Probably...a prospective wife, I&#39;d gather.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> More than likely that.

You don&#39;t know the<br> ruckus that comes with a hundred brothers.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> Do you really think I&#39;m supposed to know from such<br> an extreme example? Not that I&#39;m endowed with<br> anything but the most plain examples.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> But you all know what families are about. I kind of<br> envy you for that.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> I know. Let me have some practical experience.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> If all of you were a family, would that make you a<br> [♂ father /♀️ mother] and them your two daughters?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> And proud of them I&#39;d be.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Please take care of us siblings three.</p><hr><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> Uh, would you mind not treating me like a child?<br> I just so happen to have this appearance.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> I&#39;d prefer you not lump me in with the shady<br> alchemist.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> And what&#39;s so shady about me? There&#39;s nothing to be<br> ashamed of regarding my current appearance or<br> thinking process.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Where ability is concerned, I am not so much a<br> daughter or little sister as a peer in whom one can trust<br> and find support—</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> I had the pretense of “colleagues within an<br> organization,” but that&#39;s more of a personal preference.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> It&#39;s not a point I&#39;d push on you. For starters,<br> there&#39;s a question mark as to your satisfaction in that<br> regard.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Plus, one&#39;s position shouldn&#39;t be something you<br> yourself assert or inquire after...</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> Hahaha. Get along now. Where yours truly stands,<br> you&#39;re both just stunted parsnips of different stripes.<br> Nothing special with you either.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> Hm? Weren&#39;t you describing me the same way?<br> I&#39;m an excellent prime AI, you know!</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> I dunno about that.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> You&#39;re such a... Hm?</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> Is there some kind of clamor going on at the home<br> base? What could be going on?</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> Intra-type communications are—um, down? Odd.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> I haven&#39;t had a chance to check, but do the AIs have<br> comms capability?</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> Those of the same type can essentially network with<br> one another.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> It&#39;s a bit trickier between different types, which<br> requires an exchange of individual IDs for one-on-one<br> comms.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> There are other ways to communicate remotely in<br> cases of emergency, but that&#39;s the basic gist of it.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> Anyway, now it seems like the standard network<br> connection between medical types has gone down.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> That&#39;s why I can&#39;t get in touch with the girls at our<br> home base...</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> I have a bad feeling about this.

To think you&#39;d fail<br> to notice the only logical answer.</p><p><strong>Caster&#39;s Master:</strong><br> It&#39;s almost unfair that the randomizer would induce<br> such a difference in ability.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> I really don&#39;t know why but this guy makes me<br> wholeheartedly—</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> Pissed off.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> If you want it, steal it. Well, I can&#39;t really argue against<br> that.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> But the only ones allowed to do so are those like<br> yours truly, blessed with high birth, good looks,<br> and combat strength.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> For a brat like you, the very idea is absurd!</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Conflict seems unavoidable...but be careful.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> According to my calculations, the fact that he&#39;s<br> showed his face—</p><h3 id="arrow-2-post-battle-1" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#arrow-2-post-battle-1" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Arrow 2 Post-Battle</h3><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Tch...!</p><hr><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Even estimating all his actions, we can&#39;t overcome this<br> difference in physical and energetical resources!</p><p><strong>Caster:</strong><br> Ah...good.

Now you have two Servants in one<br> area. Which means you only get half your supply.</p><p><strong>Caster&#39;s Master:</strong><br> Two weak Servants don&#39;t make any difference.<br> Use your head more, idiot!</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> (I could give him a temporary boost in Raniment...<br> if I use my Command Spell.)</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> (But...what if that&#39;s not enough to win?)</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> (And if I do win, I&#39;ll be without it for the battles to<br> come...

You can&#39;t be<br> sure how much strength my side&#39;s saved up.</p><p><strong>Lainur:</strong><br> However clear the present situation&#39;s inequalities may<br> seem, the addition of one unknown renders the<br> equation moot.</p><p><strong>Caster&#39;s Master:</strong><br> Tch...</p><p><strong>Caster&#39;s Master:</strong><br> Huh, hmph. Fair enough. We&#39;ve enriched our resources<br> well enough at the expense of yours.</p><p><strong>Caster&#39;s Master:</strong><br> Those as outstanding as us cannot afford to risk losing.<br> We can proceed whenever prudent to do so...</p><p><strong>Caster&#39;s Master:</strong><br> Move out, Caster.</p><p><strong>Caster:</strong><br> Yes... True enough, there is no sport in punishing them<br> so easily.</p><p><strong>Caster:</strong><br> We must give them far greater cause to show terror.<br> Enough to prostrate their heads on the floor to beg<br> my forgiveness.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> That should do it for first aid on my R-type girls.<br> If the ones that disappeared were still here...</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> At any rate...I&#39;ve been saved once again.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> My thanks, Rider. And to your Master too...<br> Will that suffice?</p><p><strong>Lainur:</strong><br> Like I said, it&#39;s no lie that I&#39;m the prime AI of the<br> Transfer section, as well as Master of Rider.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> (Professor Lev...?)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> (Lainur...?)</p><hr><p><strong>Lainur:</strong><br> Hm? What&#39;re ya eyeballing me for?<br> Is there someone I resemble?</p><p><strong>Lainur:</strong><br> Pretty weird. The randomizer&#39;s supposed to have a<br> perfect random generation function...</p><p><strong>Lainur:</strong><br> But hey, small wonder when it spits out guys who&#39;re<br> so spiritually screwed up. It&#39;s always possible a<br> template or something was put to use.</p><p><strong>Lainur:</strong><br> It could mean we were chosen randomly from that set.</p><p><strong>Lainur:</strong><br> In that vein, it&#39;s a totally different deal from you<br> knowing a guy with the same face. Don&#39;t worry about it.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> And him...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Rider, Lanling Wang...?</p><hr><p><strong>Rider:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Lainur:</strong><br> Oh, c&#39;mon. You&#39;re tellin&#39; me you know his face too?<br> He&#39;s wearing a mask, but you know what I mean.</p><p><strong>Lainur:</strong><br> I got no luck here...but these True Name gimmicks<br> were bound to come out sometime. Feel like sayin&#39; hi or<br> something?</p><p><strong>Rider:</strong><br> I will do so if ordered to. If not, I have no such<br> intention.</p><p><strong>Rider:</strong><br> All I am is a tool.</p><p><strong>Rider:</strong><br> I would utter a different name as well, as I am no<br> prince.</p><p><strong>Rider:</strong><br> Even in the event I were called such a thing,<br> it is not who I am here and now.</p><p><strong>Rider:</strong><br> I am naught but a blade, a mere warrior.<br> Merely—Gao Changgong.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> Oh, what a chilly reception. I do feel a rather high wall<br> set in your heart.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> Brushing it seems to hold the risk of suffering a very<br> real cut.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Gao Changgong... That name is still associated with<br> the general known as Lanling Wang.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Or is the name particular to the Rider class?</p><p><strong>Gao Changgong:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> So? What&#39;s the Rider faction&#39;s business here?</p><p><strong>Lainur:</strong><br> It oughta go without saying. I dropped by to let our<br> Servants duel to the death, as a competitor in the<br> System Grail War—</p><p><strong>Lainur:</strong><br> Or how about none of that, given that we&#39;re in Repair?<br> I brought by a subordinate who I was hopin&#39; you&#39;d fix<br> up.</p><p><strong>Lainur:</strong><br> We can kill each other any old time.<br> I&#39;ve got more important shit to do, ya see.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> What, now?</p><p><strong>J：Transfer AI:</strong><br> H E L L O. I am a Transfer AI, specifically, a T-type of<br> the R.A.N.I series.</p><p><strong>Rani-T:</strong><br> I am very embarrassed to admit that I suffered an<br> accident while carrying out my duties. I was surprised<br> by a bug that suddenly popped out.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> Ah, is that right? So these two came as escorts to see<br> your injury treated?</p><p><strong>Rani-T:</strong><br> E X A C T L Y.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> You went out of your way to saunter into your<br> enemy&#39;s midst, the Repair home base, in the middle of<br> a Holy Grail War?</p><p><strong>Lainur:</strong><br> Put it like that, I do get your drift. It&#39;s not like we had<br> to come here to get treatment.</p><p><strong>Lainur:</strong><br> I could just as easily flag down and ask a Repair-type<br> who&#39;s in another partition on official business,</p><p><strong>Lainur:</strong><br> or send in a request, or use a roadside emergency<br> repair kit if I felt like it.</p><p><strong>Lainur:</strong><br> But–since gettin&#39; this Master thing in my system,<br> a little bit of desire&#39;s been created in the process.</p><p><strong>Lainur:</strong><br> The kinda desire that makes ya wanna look around...<br> check things out.</p><p><strong>Lainur:</strong><br> That&#39;s part of the reason I made the trip. I mean,<br> there&#39;s a whole lotta things these fresh eyes haven&#39;t<br> seen first-hand.</p><p><strong>Lainur:</strong><br> So I was hopin&#39; you&#39;d gimme a tour.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> Yeah... I&#39;d call that weird.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> What do you think, Fujimaru?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> It&#39;s hard to find the right words here, but...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> He warrants a degree of caution either way...I think.</p><hr><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> That&#39;s both true and justified. I&#39;m relieved to hear<br> some rational thinking.</p><p><strong>Lainur:</strong><br> Hahah, you might be right.</p><p><strong>Lainur:</strong><br> So how &#39;bout I only move around within your guys&#39;<br> visibility?</p><p><strong>Lainur:</strong><br> Plus, I&#39;ll give Rider orders not to do a damn thing.</p><p><strong>Lainur:</strong><br> There&#39;s no way I&#39;d be able to whip something<br> together right in front of you, and no way to wreak<br> havoc on my own. Right?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> In that case... I guess...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> As long as you stay in sight, then.</p><hr><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> I wonder if Rider over there is okay with his Master<br> taking unilateral action?</p><p><strong>Gao Changgong:</strong><br> If I am given an order, I will follow it. All I am is a tool.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> Hmmm...</p><p><strong>Lainur:</strong><br> I know, lemme borrow an R-type to play tour guide.<br> That way it&#39;s less annoyin&#39; for me to call anybody<br> over.</p><p><strong>Lainur:</strong><br> Right then, first we&#39;ll check out the therapy pods and<br> medical kits...</p><p><strong>Lainur:</strong><br> No, maybe start with this building? I seem to be stuck<br> on everythin&#39; that didn&#39;t draw my interest before...</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> I have to second that this is still weird. Does anything<br> else bear comment?</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> So he really came here for treatment and a tour?<br> I guess we do owe him one for driving off Caster.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> And yet...I truly feel no hostility from that Master or<br> his Servant.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Though I do get a strong sense of discretion,<br> or at least, an unsociable will.</p><p><strong>Gao Changgong:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> (I don&#39;t think he&#39;s even making eye contact.)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> (Just keep an eye on each other...)</p><hr><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> That should do it. Scan executed—and<br> confirmation complete.</p><p><strong>Rani-T:</strong><br> I admire such treatment akin to a S P E E D S T E R as<br> much as our own work. Here is some Raniment as<br> thanks.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> Thanks for that. Now, back to that Master...</p><p><strong>Lainur:</strong><br> Humm, haww. What future will this lead to...<br> Most certainly...a world close to perfection...</p><p><strong>Lainur:</strong><br> Real damn fascinating.<br> Oh, there you are. All done?</p><p><strong>Rani-T:</strong><br> E X A C T L Y.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> (He hasn&#39;t escaped my sight.)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> (Yet he hasn&#39;t done anything suspicious...)</p><hr><p><strong>Lainur:</strong><br> All right, we&#39;re outta here.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> You mean to say you really came here just for this?</p><p><strong>Lainur:</strong><br> Whatever more I could say, that&#39;s all there is.</p><p><strong>Lainur:</strong><br> The future&#39;s moving forward at high speed.<br> We&#39;ve got no time to sit around and eat its dust.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> But you&#39;re at least saying...you have no intent to fight<br> us today?</p><p><strong>Lainur:</strong><br> True that. Pick a fight and it might all be over.<br> I get the feelin&#39; like that&#39;s still a waste.</p><p><strong>Lainur:</strong><br> But what do you make of Caster? His Master&#39;s<br> character looked all too warlike to me.</p><p><strong>Lainur:</strong><br> I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll continue to make the first move.<br> Though I can&#39;t say if it&#39;ll be here or elsewhere.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> No doubt. I&#39;ve calculated that much.</p><p><strong>Lainur:</strong><br> While I&#39;m talking, I&#39;m willin&#39; to pay for the tour with<br> information on top of Raniment.</p><p><strong>Lainur:</strong><br> We on the Rider side of things are over in Transfer.<br> We got the edge over the others in mobility, AI or not.</p><p><strong>Lainur:</strong><br> And most of the partitions&#39; goings-on have been<br> scouted out.</p><p><strong>Lainur:</strong><br> I oughta say that it&#39;s only a rough idea of things.<br> There wasn&#39;t a thorough investigation.</p><p><strong>Lainur:</strong><br> As you probably know, Caster&#39;s off in Build.</p><p><strong>Lainur:</strong><br> And it&#39;s more than likely Saber&#39;s at Grow and Lancer<br> is at Keep.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> Where were those, and what were they again?</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> Right here.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> Adjacent to us in Repair are Build and Transfer.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> And here, you have Grow and Keep.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> Hmm, all clear then.</p><p><strong>Lainur:</strong><br> I guess it goes without sayin&#39; after your bunch got<br> attacked that the most aggressive side so far happens<br> to be Caster&#39;s.</p><p><strong>Lainur:</strong><br> Indications are that Saber&#39;s and Lancer&#39;s have yet to<br> proactively mount an attack.</p><p><strong>Lainur:</strong><br> I got no clue whether those Masters aren&#39;t warlike or<br> if they&#39;re craftily building up their strength instead.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> That&#39;s...Lancer&#39;s status?</p><p><strong>Lainur:</strong><br> Yeah, ya got it. Not one sign of him. I don&#39;t think he&#39;s<br> even stepped outta their partition yet.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> (Not warlike. Possibly crafty...)</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> (Ridiculous. Is that even possible? It&#39;s HIM—)</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> What&#39;s wrong, Berserker?</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> Eh...? What could be wrong with me? Yours truly is the<br> same as always.</p><p><strong>Lainur:</strong><br> All right, we&#39;ll be heading home right about now.</p><p><strong>Lainur:</strong><br> Hey, I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll be meetin&#39; again—in the near<br> future. That&#39;s the one thing ya can count on.</p><p><strong>Lainur:</strong><br> The question is, which route to take?</p><p><strong>Rani-T:</strong><br> (Glinting shine)</p><p><strong>Rani-T:</strong><br> As in whether your Transfer&#39;s express travel asset or<br> Rider&#39;s fine steed might make the trip faster?</p><p><strong>Rani-T:</strong><br> I took that to be the manner of your Q U E S T I O N.</p><p><strong>Lainur:</strong><br> Eh? Haha, that wasn&#39;t my aim at all.</p><p><strong>Rani-T:</strong><br> Shall we race? We are the proud S P E E D S T E R S<br> of this world. There will be no losing if we are<br> challenged.</p><p><strong>Gao Changgong:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Rani-T:</strong><br> Not a word.</p><p><strong>Lainur:</strong><br> Still not talkin&#39; with anyone but me, Rider?</p><p><strong>Gao Changgong:</strong><br> If ordered to, I shall. If not, I won&#39;t. That&#39;s all there is<br> to it, Master.</p><p><strong>Gao Changgong:</strong><br> I will repeat it as often as I must.</p><p><strong>Gao Changgong:</strong><br> Please do not expect me to make any moves on my<br> own initiative.</p><p><strong>Gao Changgong:</strong><br> I will never take action on my own. Not to fight and<br> not to use my Noble Phantasm.</p><p><strong>Gao Changgong:</strong><br> I&#39;ll take no action whatsoever of my own will.</p><p><strong>Gao Changgong:</strong><br> In return, I honor my Master&#39;s every command.<br> That&#39;s all I amount to.</p><p><strong>Gao Changgong:</strong><br> If a Master expects their Servant to tread beyond their<br> expected bounds,</p><p><strong>Gao Changgong:</strong><br> that would surely make me into a wretched,<br> evil Servant.</p><p><strong>Gao Changgong:</strong><br> I am merely a sword. Nay, as a Rider, truly no<br> different than a mere horse.</p><p><strong>Gao Changgong:</strong><br> Simply point my nose in the direction I am told to go,<br> and only run when I am told to run.</p><p><strong>Gao Changgong:</strong><br> (That&#39;s right—)</p><p><strong>Gao Changgong:</strong><br> (Because the fate of a horse that runs as it pleases<br> despite its reins goes without saying.)</p><p><strong>Lainur:</strong><br> Psh. If I had to pick one or the other, I&#39;d say my<br> character leans more towards calculation than instinct.</p><p><strong>Lainur:</strong><br> I &#39;preciate how much quicker on the uptake we can be<br> with fewer uncertainties in the picture.</p><p><strong>Lainur:</strong><br> I&#39;m not that unhappy with the way ya do things.<br> Just try to give it your best for the future&#39;s sake.</p><p><strong>Rani-T:</strong><br> Then what will you do now?</p><p><strong>Rani-T:</strong><br> We would regret missing a chance to show off our<br> superior S T Y L E. Hairpin curves are our specialty.</p><p><strong>Gao Changgong:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Rani-T:</strong><br> Not a word.</p><p><strong>Lainur:</strong><br> (Sigh) Well, point of fact, I don&#39;t really care how<br> quick I go or anythin&#39;.</p><p><strong>Lainur:</strong><br> If you&#39;re simply in a hurry, just use your own machine.</p><p><strong>Rani-T:</strong><br> I recall that your own express travel asset was a<br> special bike, leader.</p><p><strong>Rani-T:</strong><br> The one with the handlebars all splayed out.</p><p><strong>Lainur:</strong><br> Yeah, I left my chopper behind at HQ.</p><p><strong>Lainur:</strong><br> Just moving around fast is fine and well, but right now<br> I&#39;m making both detailed observations and measuring<br> variables.</p><p><strong>Lainur:</strong><br> There&#39;s more profit found in taking the comprehensive<br> view by dedicatin&#39; some attention there while on the<br> move.</p><p><strong>Lainur:</strong><br> Isn&#39;t that why I picked you up and shuttled you here<br> on Rider&#39;s horse?</p><p><strong>Rani-T:</strong><br> Then...do you have no use for your S P E E D S T E R S?</p><p><strong>Lainur:</strong><br> Never said that, everything just has its time and place.</p><p><strong>Lainur:</strong><br> I was only plannin&#39; on going back to HQ for now to<br> consolidate this information.</p><p><strong>Lainur:</strong><br> It&#39;s also worthwhile to give Rider some downtime.</p><p><strong>Lainur:</strong><br> So this time we&#39;ll head back on your express asset.<br> But there&#39;s no need to gun it all the way.</p><p><strong>Lainur:</strong><br> If I discover something of interest on the way back,<br> I obviously mean to wholeheartedly investigate—</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> Now then. We&#39;ll need to update our comm protocols.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> That way we can get back in touch quickly in the event<br> anything should go wrong.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> Its encryption...and of course, higher signal strength...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You okay...?</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> Of course I am. I&#39;m certainly sad to see them go...<br> but I can&#39;t be stuck in a rut over it.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> If there&#39;s anything I can do to help...</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> No, not to worry. This really is my role as a prime AI.</p><hr><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> So all of you can go ahead and get some rest.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> I can sleep after I&#39;ve finished all the work that needs<br> doing. Don&#39;t worry about me.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> How do all of you usually sleep?</p><hr><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> The girls on night shift stick to their duties,<br> with the others taking a control pod.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> About your group... Uhm, what should we do?</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> The control pods designed for AIs are rather rugged.<br> I don&#39;t think they&#39;re the most comfortable choice.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Anywhere&#39;s fine.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I&#39;m used to roughing it.</p><hr><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> For the time being, we&#39;ll be okay as long as there&#39;s a<br> place to lie down.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Although it&#39;d be best if there were such a room that<br> would allow all three of us to rest at the same time.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> We&#39;d like to avoid having three single rooms.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> I don&#39;t suppose you&#39;re being cautious around me...?<br> Or do you have your own scheme in mind?</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> That&#39;s not limited to you, but anything that might<br> threaten Fujimaru during [♂ his /♀️ her] sleep period.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Simply an optimal solution for a top priority issue.<br> Or do you have anything to add?</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> I feel like things just took an awkward turn,<br> but it might just be me.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> Lots of rooms do meet your requirements, so I&#39;ll show<br> you to whichever&#39;s best. Have a good rest then!</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Not too wide, not too narrow.

My lips are sealed.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> Whatever. We need to restock on Raniment-laced<br> materials. Any ideas?</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Raniment is a conceptual factor analogous to magical<br> energy. And materials refer to the base substances that<br> compose this world, right?</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> Yeah. In simpler terms, that&#39;d be food.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> The people at Keep modify the raw material produced<br> by Grow to contain tiny amounts of Raniment.<br> Here&#39;s one.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> And by ingesting these...you AI replenish magical<br> energy and recover from material deterioration?</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> I see. That is indeed how food works.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> The Raniment we gain through this balances out our<br> natural consumption, meaning this just preserves the<br> status quo.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> It won&#39;t give us any advantages in combat.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> Since you&#39;re in the same standing as an AI,<br> I think you can eat it. Will you try?</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> It&#39;s important to stay energized.

I have a report.</p><p><strong>Rani-R:</strong><br> Leader, Keep has been sending this kind of material<br> lately. Do you know it?</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> That&#39;s new to me.

We should be making<br> money off this.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> Is there anyone else we can extort?</p><p><strong>Rani-T:</strong><br> Thank you for your continued patronage. This is a<br> message service from Transfer.

What&#39;s<br> stopping her interior from being altered as well?</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> We weren&#39;t close or anything, but I did see that<br> woman a lot in the control room.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> She was always content at work, and kept a detached<br> and easygoing face no matter the situation.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> Nonetheless, she was cold and kept an emotional<br> distance between herself and the Chaldea team.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> A real wild card of an alchemist.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> I always knew she was hiding something I&#39;d find<br> personally irritating...</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> but at the very least, I never thought she&#39;d be such a<br> straight-laced researcher.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> Has she laughed even once since we got here?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Sion was always pretty dedicated,</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> but more like a sociable class representative.</p><hr><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> Yes. That&#39;s why—</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> It&#39;s entirely possible that&#39;s someone pretending to be<br> Sion Eltnam.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> I&#39;d be more careful if I were you.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Hmm...</p><hr><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> What are you two talking about?</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> Oh, nothing.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> I was just interviewing Master to find out what kind of<br> love [♂ he /♀️ she] would prefer to be corrupted by.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> You never know when someone will awaken to a<br> special desire.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> So you were wasting time. Just as I calculated.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You know... Can&#39;t you two get along better?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Just a little more affable.

Then they&#39;re—</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Correct. Among all things in this world... Servants<br> would be what they&#39;re the most similar to.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> But they aren&#39;t Servants.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Many unanswered questions. We still have a lot to<br> investigate.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> Uh-huh. I&#39;ll leave all that to you.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> You seem so much more knowledgeable than me.<br> About everything relevant here.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> O-our job here is done.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Why don&#39;t we go back?</p><hr><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> We should.

That&#39;d be our first contact with<br> them.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Geographically speaking...</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> They&#39;re on the opposite end of the Defend area from<br> us.

Aren&#39;t they unusual?</p><p><strong>G：Sakura:</strong><br> I believe they&#39;re produced with a formula closer to<br> cooking. This could be like a bread or a naan.</p><p><strong>G：Sakura:</strong><br> They have some Raniment, so they wouldn&#39;t be<br> wasted on you, Saber.</p><p><strong>G：Sakura:</strong><br> Can you at least replenish yourself before leaving?<br> I already finished my share.</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong><br> ...Fine.</p><p><strong>G：Sakura:</strong><br> Hehe. It&#39;s so fascinating to see the materials we<br> created being turned into this.</p><p><strong>G：Sakura:</strong><br> I&#39;d love to learn how to do it, but I suppose I can&#39;t<br> since that&#39;s Keep&#39;s exclusive job...</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong><br> I&#39;m done eating. I&#39;ll be leaving now.</p><p><strong>G：Sakura:</strong><br> Oh, already?</p><p><strong>G：Sakura:</strong><br> All right...bye then.</p><p><strong>J：Saber:</strong><br> Sakura. I know how much you care about the Grow<br> area.</p><p><strong>J：Saber:</strong><br> I know how dearly you wish to maintain your home<br> and your job.</p><p><strong>J：Saber:</strong><br> That&#39;s why I&#39;m operating like this.</p><p><strong>J：Saber:</strong><br> I&#39;ll give everything to make your wish come true.<br> As your Servant.</p><p><strong>J：Saber:</strong><br> Not as your friend.</p><p><strong>J：Saber:</strong><br> Our apparent age may be close, but we both know it<br> doesn&#39;t reflect reality. I don&#39;t see any point to<br> thoughtless intimacy.</p><p><strong>H：Sakura:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>H：Sakura:</strong><br> O-okay. I see your point... I should have figured...</p><p><strong>J：Saber:</strong><br> I&#39;m going. Keep to your job, Sakura.</p><p><strong>H：Sakura:</strong><br> Back to work it is.</p><p><strong>H：Sakura:</strong><br> This next batch looks like it will yield huge returns,<br> so I can&#39;t let this one fumble.</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> —Heya!</p><p><strong>A：Grow AI:</strong><br> ...Ooooh, that savage pose...the symbol of the leader&#39;s<br> motivation...</p><p><strong>A：Grow AI:</strong><br> ...The legendary “heya” we only hear in the peaks of<br> her mood.</p><p><strong>A：Grow AI:</strong><br> ...I haven&#39;t witnessed this in a long time. Something<br> great will happen today...</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> D-don&#39;t be weird about it. I&#39;m just feeling motivated,<br> okay?</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> Though I can see how you could get addicted to<br> watching this...</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong><br> (This is how things should be...)</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong><br> (I can&#39;t put my finger on exactly why,)</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong><br> (but I can sense that I must not interact with her.<br> That&#39;s for certain.)</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong><br> (So, that&#39;s how things should be—)</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong><br> ...Tch!?</p><p><strong>Lancer:</strong><br> Woah there.</p><p><strong>Lancer&#39;s Master:</strong><br> What now? Didn&#39;t I tell you she&#39;d be here...?</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong><br> A Servant and Master...!</p><p><strong>Lancer:</strong><br> Yup. I&#39;m Lancer. Sorry &#39;bout the sudden visit.</p><p><strong>Lancer:</strong><br> And you... I see a sword in your hand, so Saber?<br> Pretty small one, though.</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong><br> Are you trying to say a small sword can&#39;t kill?<br> —Do you want to put that to the test?</p><p><strong>Lancer&#39;s Master:</strong><br> (This won&#39;t go over well. Stop, Lancer. You&#39;ll lose.<br> That&#39;s the inevitable outcome from having me around.)</p><p><strong>Lancer&#39;s Master:</strong><br> (I&#39;m...a useless sinner who deserves to lose.<br> There&#39;s no avoiding my punishment —)</p><p><strong>Lancer:</strong><br> ...Just kiddin&#39;.</p><p><strong>Lancer:</strong><br> Don&#39;t worry. I do have my weapon with me,<br> but I ain&#39;t here for a bout.</p><p><strong>Lancer:</strong><br> And your Master ain&#39;t even here.</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong><br> —Pardon?</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong><br> What are you talking about? Aren&#39;t you a Servant in<br> this Holy Grail War?</p><p><strong>Lancer:</strong><br> Sure am. You&#39;re right about that, but I got something<br> more important to do.</p><p><strong>Lancer:</strong><br> You can&#39;t fight a war on an empty stomach.<br> Food first, fighting second. Food above all.</p><p><strong>Lancer:</strong><br> I can&#39;t fight before I give my Master the delicious meal<br> that&#39;ll make her happy.</p><p><strong>Lancer:</strong><br> That&#39;s why I&#39;ve come to procure ingredients here in<br> Grow!</p><p><strong>Lancer:</strong><br> I&#39;m not here for a fight. So put that sword of yours<br> down, Saber.</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong><br> Are you stupid? Who would believe that?</p><p><strong>Lancer:</strong><br> Well, I kinda need you to... Okay, here&#39;s a fair<br> compromise.</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong><br> What are you sitting on the ground for?</p><p><strong>L：Lancer:</strong><br> Saber, you may call your Master here.</p><p><strong>L：Lancer:</strong><br> I&#39;m not lying. If you let me have a sincere conversation<br> with your Master, that will convey my honesty to you<br> too.</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong><br> That confirms it, just an idiot—<br> ...!</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong><br> (Right, there could be another group working off this!<br> While he distracts me here... Sakura!)</p><p><strong>Lancer:</strong><br> What&#39;s up?</p><p><strong>Lancer&#39;s Master:</strong><br> She said no. Let&#39;s leave...</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong><br> Sakura!</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> Wh-what&#39;s wrong? I&#39;ve never seen you make a face<br> like that...</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong><br> —You&#39;re not hurt.</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong><br> I was worried for nothing... No, it may just be that I got<br> here faster than them.</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong><br> There&#39;s an enemy here. We need to move, just in<br> case—</p><p><strong>L：Lancer:</strong><br> Hup hup. Cutting in!</p><p><strong>Lancer&#39;s Master:</strong><br> Don&#39;t leave me behind, you idiot...!</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong><br> Lancer!</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong><br> (He seems to have followed me here. I returned at full<br> speed. He&#39;s as fast as me...!?)</p><p><strong>Lancer:</strong><br> What&#39;s with that look in your eyes?</p><p><strong>Lancer:</strong><br> Oh, uh, see, I&#39;m a bit blessed by the winds.<br> Just &#39;cause I&#39;m big, it doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m slow.</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong><br> You used me to locate my Master?</p><p><strong>Lancer:</strong><br> Nah, you just ran here without saying a word.</p><p><strong>Lancer:</strong><br> I told you to bring your Master to me, but I never said<br> I&#39;d be staying put,</p><p><strong>Lancer:</strong><br> so when you ran, I assumed you were leading me to<br> her and followed.</p><p><strong>Lancer:</strong><br> Eh, not that any of that matters.<br> Yo, are you Saber&#39;s Master?</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> I...am.</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong><br> You don&#39;t need to answer. Back away, Sakura.</p><p><strong>Lancer:</strong><br> I already told you enough times before, I&#39;m not here<br> for a fight.</p><p><strong>Lancer:</strong><br> I&#39;m a cook. And the ingredients necessary to cook in<br> this world are your material.</p><p><strong>Lancer:</strong><br> So I&#39;m here to procure some. Here&#39;s where the crops<br> grow, so I suppose I can find some quality goods<br> around these parts, right?</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> Cook...ing? So you&#39;re the one behind the new trend?</p><p><strong>Lancer:</strong><br> Hell yeah, you ate some? Was it good?</p><p><strong>A：Grow AI:</strong><br> Delicious. Just remembering it... I feel like I&#39;m living a<br> dream...</p><p><strong>Lancer:</strong><br> Hahaha, really now? Glad to know my cooking works<br> even on AI!</p><p><strong>Lancer:</strong><br> But my gloomball of a Master still isn&#39;t satisfied with<br> my quality, see?</p><p><strong>Lancer:</strong><br> The ultimate dish starts with the ultimate ingredients.<br> And that&#39;s what I&#39;m here for.</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> I see...</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong><br> Are you really believing his words?</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> Yeah. I don&#39;t think that&#39;s the story someone wanting<br> to trick me would go for.</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> And if he was planning to fight, he would have<br> attacked before we linked up.</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> Not to mention—</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> Not to mention this really great smell. Don&#39;t you think?</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong><br> I...suppose.</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> So I think it&#39;s pretty safe to say Lancer is indeed a<br> cook.</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> As the prime Grow AI,</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> it&#39;s my natural duty to provide materials to the<br> children of Keep who will put it to good use.</p><p><strong>Lancer&#39;s Master:</strong><br> It&#39;s not me asking for this donation, though...</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> Besides, didn&#39;t I mention before that I&#39;d like to learn<br> how to cook?</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> I have so many questions. So can you take him at his<br> word, Saber?</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong><br> I thought you were more timid, but you&#39;re quite<br> stubborn and stupid.</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> Don&#39;t say stupid. That&#39;s so mean.</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong><br> I won&#39;t allow anyone acting out of hand. One false<br> move and I&#39;ll kill you.</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong><br> —This applies to everyone here. I&#39;ll even kill your<br> Master.</p><p><strong>Lancer:</strong><br> Oh, I&#39;m fine with that!</p><p><strong>Lancer&#39;s Master:</strong><br> Well, I&#39;m not!</p><p><strong>Lancer&#39;s Master:</strong><br> I mean... I feel like if anyone&#39;s going to die,<br> I&#39;ll be the first one anyway, but...</p><p><strong>Lancer:</strong><br> No, no, what I&#39;m fine with is the way it sounds like<br> they&#39;ll hand us the ingredients.</p><p><strong>Lancer:</strong><br> There&#39;s no way you&#39;d die. I&#39;m here to protect you.<br> You&#39;re totally safe from death.</p><p><strong>Lancer&#39;s Master:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Lancer:</strong><br> Alright, the wind is blowing in a nice direction!</p><p><strong>Lancer:</strong><br> So let&#39;s waste no time. Show me the best produce you<br> have!</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> Come to think of it, this might be the first time<br> someone actively demanded quality.</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> This gets me in the mood to show off a product<br> worthy of my prime AI status.</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> Heya!</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> I still don&#39;t know what you consider “best”,</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> so let&#39;s take a look at the stock together.</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> We should be able to find the highest grade materials<br> that haven&#39;t been shipped yet.</p><p><strong>Lancer:</strong><br> Oh, really? Thanks a bunch!</p><p><strong>Lancer:</strong><br> Hoh, you do have a lot. Don&#39;t mind if I test a few.</p><p><strong>Lancer:</strong><br> There is some stuff I&#39;ve never seen before,</p><p><strong>Lancer:</strong><br> but a good cook knows how to predict how good<br> something ultimately will be.</p><p><strong>Lancer:</strong><br> Lemme see...</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> I&#39;m really proud of those materials over there in<br> particular. What do you think? Do they satisfy you?</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong><br> He&#39;s clearly digging through things at random.</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong><br> He could be aiming to mishandle material to lower its<br> value. How much slack are we going to give?</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong><br> Ugh, he&#39;s smelling them. We need to stop him before<br> he starts licking or biting things.</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong><br> Shouldn&#39;t we kill him before he does?</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> C-calm down.</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> He&#39;ll just have to pay for anything he does lick or bite...</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> But he wouldn&#39;t do it for more than one item per<br> batch. And what can we do if that&#39;s what he needs to<br> evaluate the product?</p><p><strong>Lancer&#39;s Master:</strong><br> (Ugh. Can this end any faster...?)</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> Hello... Lancer&#39;s Master... You&#39;re the prime Keep AI,<br> right?</p><p><strong>Lancer&#39;s Master:</strong><br> Probably.</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> Probably?</p><p><strong>Lancer&#39;s Master:</strong><br> My personality was randomly plastered over an AI.</p><p><strong>Lancer&#39;s Master:</strong><br> This must have caused some sort of weird bug.<br> I don&#39;t feel any sense of duty as an AI.</p><p><strong>Lancer&#39;s Master:</strong><br> My memories show me being dutiful, but now my<br> responsible side is tangibly gone.</p><p><strong>Lancer&#39;s Master:</strong><br> (Not only that... I&#39;m definitely failing as a Grail War<br> Master too...)</p><p><strong>Lancer&#39;s Master:</strong><br> Heh... What&#39;s going on with me?</p><p><strong>Lancer&#39;s Master:</strong><br> Seeing how well you&#39;re doing, it makes it all the more<br> clear to me.</p><p><strong>Lancer&#39;s Master:</strong><br> I can&#39;t pretend not to notice it anymore. Not that I<br> ever really tried to.</p><p><strong>Lancer&#39;s Master:</strong><br> I&#39;m probably glitching, both as an AI and as a Master.</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> Are...you? You don&#39;t seem that way.</p><p><strong>Lancer&#39;s Master:</strong><br> I am.</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> But, uh...</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> Oh. There was something I wanted to ask you but<br> forgot.</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> What&#39;s your name?</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> I&#39;m called Sakura. It was Saber who named me.</p><p><strong>Lancer&#39;s Master:</strong><br> I have no name—</p><p><strong>Lancer:</strong><br> She&#39;s got one!</p><p><strong>Lancer&#39;s Master:</strong><br> Lancer!</p><p><strong>Lancer:</strong><br> Didn&#39;t you say yourself you felt like that was your<br> name? Names are important. If you have one,<br> you shouldn&#39;t hide it.</p><p><strong>Lancer:</strong><br> Mmm, I can do some good stuff with this! Its smell is...<br> Well, now...</p><p><strong>Lancer&#39;s Master:</strong><br> ...Cerejeira.</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> Cerejeira? That&#39;s a beautiful name.</p><p><strong>M：Cerejeira:</strong><br> I don&#39;t care.</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> Hehehe. By the way, did you ever eat those meals,<br> Cerejeira?</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> They&#39;re quite delicious. Lancer made them, right?</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> They&#39;ve also got me dying to get him to teach me how<br> to cook.</p><p><strong>M：Cerejeira:</strong><br> Go ahead. He&#39;s...a weird Servant.</p><p><strong>M：Cerejeira:</strong><br> He spends all his time cooking for me, not fighting or<br> preparing for battle.</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> Oh. Hehehe, you&#39;re a shy one.</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> To me, you mentioning how you get to eat his meals<br> all the time sounds like you&#39;re bragging about your man.</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> But my Saber is a great Servant too.</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> She&#39;s usually brusque, but she&#39;s actually very kind.</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> Whenever I&#39;m doing any remotely dangerous job,<br> she&#39;s always watching me from behind in silence<br> and—</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong><br> Sakura.</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> Hehehe...I&#39;m saying too much, aren&#39;t I?</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> Sorry, I&#39;m usually not this talkative.</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> Most of us G-types don&#39;t get to talk much, but now I<br> suddenly find myself enjoying chatting quite a lot.</p><p><strong>M：Cerejeira:</strong><br> That&#39;s weird...</p><p><strong>M：Cerejeira:</strong><br> You call it chatting... Are you forgetting I&#39;m an enemy<br> Master? You shouldn&#39;t be treating me like a friend.</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> We AI were pure functionality, but now that we&#39;ve<br> been added this extra element that is our pseudo-<br> personalities,</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> everyone will have a part of themselves that feels odd<br> or glitchy, I think.</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> That&#39;s pretty much why I wanted to chat with you<br> despite you being an enemy Master.</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> Our competition doesn&#39;t change this. Right,<br> and beyond that...</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> There&#39;s no reason why—rivals can&#39;t be friends.</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> Or is that a problem for you?</p><p><strong>M：Cerejeira:</strong><br> I... I&#39;m...</p><p><strong>M：Cerejeira:</strong><br> I don&#39;t think I deserve any of this.</p><p><strong>M：Cerejeira:</strong><br> I&#39;m not qualified to be prime AI, or a Master,<br> or someone&#39;s friend.</p><p><strong>M：Cerejeira:</strong><br> I&#39;m not qualified to be anything. Considering all I&#39;ve<br> done before—</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> Done before? Your phrasing makes no sense.</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> We&#39;re Masters birthed by the randomizer. This is the<br> first place we&#39;ve ever been to.</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> You may have messed up before when you were just<br> an AI, but why would that matter now?</p><p><strong>M：Cerejeira:</strong><br> Do you...think so?</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> I&#39;m sure. So I don&#39;t think you need to mind it.</p><p><strong>M：Cerejeira:</strong><br> You&#39;re weird...</p><p><strong>Lancer:</strong><br> Yup, that&#39;s the stuff! That&#39;s some good material.<br> Perfect size and perfect luster.</p><p><strong>Lancer:</strong><br> Yeah, I&#39;ll take the whole lot!</p><p><strong>Lancer:</strong><br> Ah. Sorry, am I interrupting something?</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> N-not at all.</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> Yeah, we were just chatting. We had a very meaningful<br> time together.</p><p><strong>Lancer:</strong><br> Great to hear. So, I gotta pay in Raniment, right?</p><p><strong>Lancer:</strong><br> There you go.</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> Oh my, this much? I don&#39;t think this trade is fair on<br> you...</p><p><strong>Lancer:</strong><br> No biggie, it&#39;s &#39;cause I dropped in with no previous<br> warning. I included a fee for being unreasonable.</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> Thank you very much for that.</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> I don&#39;t need this much, so that&#39;s all yours, Saber.</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong><br> ...Are you alright in the head, Lancer? You&#39;re<br> benefiting your enemy.</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong><br> Are you trying to say you can defeat me even with a<br> handicap?</p><p><strong>Lancer:</strong><br> Man, you&#39;re really raring for this fight, huh?<br> I already told you I&#39;m not duking it out with anyone for<br> now.</p><p><strong>Lancer:</strong><br> Now&#39;s the time for cooking. Gotta do something &#39;bout<br> my Master&#39;s sulking face.</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong><br> How long do you mean by “for now”?</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong><br> Nothing changes the fact that we&#39;re participants in<br> the Holy Grail War. Combat is unavoidable, I believe.</p><p><strong>Lancer:</strong><br> Like I care.</p><p><strong>Lancer:</strong><br> I&#39;m pretty sure everyone wants a little more time to<br> settle in. Not just you and me.</p><p><strong>Lancer:</strong><br> Just give all of us a moment to eat what we want,<br> and once everyone is full,</p><p><strong>Lancer:</strong><br> and out of other things to do—</p><p><strong>Lancer:</strong><br> That&#39;s when should gather for our little tournament.<br> Have it as an exercise to help digestion, don&#39;t you<br> agree?</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Lancer:</strong><br> And that&#39;s all I had to say, so I&#39;m out. Gotta make a<br> supreme dish with these ingredients.</p><p><strong>Lancer:</strong><br> Heheheh, just wait for it, Master. Your next meal will<br> be the one that finally breaks you out of your shell...!</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> Don&#39;t expect any excitement from me.</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> Well then, uh... Goodbye.</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> I had so many questions I wanted to ask about<br> cooking, but it&#39;s hard to find the courage to ask Lancer...</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong><br> It was the right choice. I&#39;d do everything to stop you if<br> you tried asking him.</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong><br> I&#39;d like to ask you never to try anything like that again.</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong><br> From my perspective as someone who needs to<br> protect my Master in the Holy Grail War, what<br> happened just now was far too dangerous.</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> Was it...?</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong><br> Don&#39;t you tell me you already developed trust and<br> think of them as friends now?</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong><br> If so, you&#39;re insanely naive.</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> This area is what I love and what matters the most for<br> me.</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> So I kinda...can&#39;t be harsh on people who value Grow<br> and praise the quality of my materials.</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong><br> You need to change the way you think.</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong><br> Those are the only Holy Grail War participants we&#39;ve<br> met so far. There&#39;s no guarantee the others will be like<br> them.</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong><br> We&#39;re lucky that no one was harmed in the present<br> incident. If it happens again, who can tell what—</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> Wh-what?</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> —Team! Tell me what happened!</p><p><strong>D：Rani-G:</strong><br> Oh no...</p><p><strong>E：Rani-G:</strong><br> We&#39;re under attack.</p><p><strong>F：Rani-G:</strong><br> It&#39;s...a Servant!</p><h3 id="arrow-2-pre-battle-2" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#arrow-2-pre-battle-2" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Arrow 2 Pre-Battle</h3><p><strong>Caster&#39;s Master:</strong><br> Stand in line.</p><p><strong>D：Build AI (Rani-B):</strong><br> ...Complete.</p><p><strong>Caster&#39;s Master:</strong><br> Hold your tongue.

Did you hear that?<br> Understand its meaning.</p><p><strong>Caster:</strong><br> You must follow what he says. Your owner&#39;s<br> commands are absolute!</p><p><strong>Caster&#39;s Master:</strong><br> Exactly... No one can disobey me.</p><p><strong>Caster&#39;s Master:</strong><br> Because I&#39;m in charge here.</p><p><strong>Caster&#39;s Master:</strong><br> And it&#39;s the duty of the superior to stand above others.<br> That&#39;s the ideal. That&#39;s why I operate the way I do.</p><p><strong>Caster&#39;s Master:</strong><br> For that, I&#39;ll choose the most logical means and take<br> the most efficient path to victory—</p><p><strong>Caster:</strong><br> Yes, you&#39;re doing nothing wrong. Those with power<br> dominate those without. That is the natural order.</p><p><strong>Caster&#39;s Master:</strong><br> Therefore, I must rule this world.</p><p><strong>Caster&#39;s Master:</strong><br> I must win this Holy Grail War and become the new<br> general supervisor AI.</p><p><strong>Caster&#39;s Master:</strong><br> That&#39;s the happiest outcome this world could have.<br> That will make all AI happy...</p><p><strong>F：Rani-B:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Caster:</strong><br> What a lonesome silence. But I like this look on your<br> faces.</p><p><strong>Caster:</strong><br> Panic, agony, fear, bewilderment. And yet,<br> the thoughtless will to dedicate oneself to their job.</p><p><strong>Caster:</strong><br> Such is the functionality of man-made dolls.<br> It&#39;s for such reasons they find themselves unable to<br> escape any cruelty.</p><p><strong>Caster:</strong><br> Alas, it&#39;s a curse. This is exactly like a curse!</p><p><strong>Caster:</strong><br> Dance, pantomimes. I shall be watching you from the<br> room fragrant of life—</p><p><strong>Caster&#39;s Master:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Caster:</strong><br> Well then—I am refilled. Can you see the route<br> that will make you king of the world?</p><p><strong>Caster&#39;s Master:</strong><br> Of course. We eat the easier prey first.</p><p><strong>Caster&#39;s Master:</strong><br> Leave the team-up cowards for later. We&#39;ll target the<br> adjacent area opposite us next.</p><p><strong>Caster:</strong><br> That&#39;s Grow... Saber&#39;s territory.</p><p><strong>Caster:</strong><br> Due to how distant they are from Berserker&#39;s Repair,<br> I don&#39;t see them joining forces.</p><p><strong>Caster&#39;s Master:</strong><br> Hmph. Don&#39;t worry yourself with the opposing side.</p><p><strong>Caster&#39;s Master:</strong><br> Once I&#39;m done with my adjustments, the trump card<br> we discussed will be available to us.

Words my Master<br> repeats often, but what do they mean?)</p><p><strong>Caster:</strong><br> (It&#39;s probably an unconscious expression with<br> implications Master doesn&#39;t realize.)</p><p><strong>Caster:</strong><br> (Where could this personality of Master have come<br> from—?)</p><p><strong>Caster:</strong><br> (I suppose the same question applies to me...<br> Regardless, all that those of us here must do is fulfill<br> our parts as pawns in the Holy Grail War.)</p><p><strong>Caster:</strong><br> All is equal.

Please, stop, make them stop!</p><p><strong>Caster&#39;s Master:</strong><br> I can&#39;t. It&#39;d be illogical to allow leftovers from such a<br> delicious meal to remain.</p><p><strong>Caster&#39;s Master:</strong><br> Hmph. First Berserker, and now this... Only the best<br> magi were supposed to become Masters.</p><p><strong>Caster&#39;s Master:</strong><br> So why are there so many dullards failing to grasp<br> basic laws?</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> This...this is unwarranted, even for the Holy Grail War.</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> These girls are the crux of our operation.</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> Not only for the Grow sector. They&#39;re a cornerstone<br> allowing this world to be what it is.</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> You won&#39;t be able to recover from this. It&#39;ll generate<br> all sorts of distortions until everything stops functioning...!</p><p><strong>Caster&#39;s Master:</strong><br> Ridiculous. Just recreate the AIs. All I&#39;m doing is just<br> temporarily lowering their numbers.</p><p><strong>Caster&#39;s Master:</strong><br> I don&#39;t need any of these materials to win anyways.</p><p><strong>Caster&#39;s Master:</strong><br> Indeed, once I&#39;m the supervisor AI, I&#39;ll fully automate<br> this sector.</p><p><strong>Caster&#39;s Master:</strong><br> It&#39;s only right to minimize wasted resources.</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> No. That&#39;s wrong. This can&#39;t...</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> Please understand.</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> You don&#39;t know how proud we are of our work.<br> How earnestly we try to fulfill our role...!</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> I&#39;m sure Build is no different in that regard...</p><p><strong>Caster&#39;s Master:</strong><br> I don&#39;t care. I&#39;m not like the inferior AIs. What&#39;s<br> unnecessary is unnecessary, and that&#39;s all.</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> I don&#39;t hold my life in that high regard. You can do<br> whatever you want with me.</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> But whatever you do, don&#39;t destroy the Grow area.</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> If it&#39;s a fight you want, then I&#39;ll fight you.</p><p><strong>Caster&#39;s Master:</strong><br> Sure, that&#39;s what I&#39;m here for.

I&#39;ll speed the discussion up by revealing the<br> correct next course of action for us to take:</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> We can&#39;t deal with this! Retreat!</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> Sakura. Command the AIs to evacuate in full.<br> That&#39;s all we can do now.</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> And by “full”, I mean leaving the Grow area.</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> Assume it&#39;s unsafe to do anything less. Now do it.</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> B-but... But!</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> As a fellow monster, I can sense it. That monster is<br> more single-minded about devouring than he ever was<br> before.</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> Right now, we can&#39;t beat him in a fight.<br> We&#39;re prey, and all prey can do is flee.</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> Consider the destruction of the facilities to be a<br> necessary cost at this point.</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> Getting the AIs to hide in the facilities is a bad idea<br> when he&#39;s going to consume the buildings whole.</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> Just get everyone out of here. That doesn&#39;t mean<br> abandoning Grow forever.</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> Escaping now is the only way to prevent the true end<br> of Grow. No arguing about it, Sakura!</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> ...!</p><p><strong>Makiri:</strong><br> Oh, excellent. Better than I imagined!</p><p><strong>Makiri:</strong><br> Don&#39;t worry about your fuel reserves, eat anything<br> that moves! You have food everywhere!</p><p><strong>Makiri:</strong><br> Let&#39;s get rid of the restraint routines while<br> we&#39;re–Hm...? The command responses weren&#39;t<br> supposed to be this slow...</p><p><strong>Makiri:</strong><br> That way next? You have a good sense of smell for<br> living Raniment.</p><p><strong>Makiri:</strong><br> —Not a problem. His decision making is more<br> autopilot than I hoped for, but that doesn&#39;t hurt the<br> plan.</p><p><strong>Makiri:</strong><br> This power gain makes maneuverability loss still a<br> quite favorable trade-off. Fine by me. Consume greedily,<br> expand greedily!</p><p><strong>Makiri:</strong><br> You can eat a Servant if you find any.</p><p><strong>Makiri:</strong><br> They won&#39;t be able to beat you. No one will!<br> Hwhahahahahaha!</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> (Wheeze) D-don&#39;t you think we ran far enough?<br> That&#39;s a fair enough distance for me.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> What&#39;s our current location?</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> Uh... Around here.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> Exactly at the frontier between Grow, Keep,<br> and the central Defend area.</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> The Grow AIs all received the message through<br> the G-type communications, right?</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> Yes. Escaping is the number one priority now.<br> I told them to leave without concerning themselves<br> with the area.</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> But they aren&#39;t as fast as the T-types.</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> After we escaped, a large number of them were eaten<br> by that giant monster.</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> They all went their own ways, so the enemy couldn&#39;t<br> pursue them in all directions at the same time.</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> You have to believe the damage was minimal.</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> (This AI&#39;s face is unsettling...<br> Reminds me of Parvati.)</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> Ah, s-sorry. I forgot to thank you for helping me.</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> Better late than never with courtesies.</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> I&#39;m...the prime Grow AI and Saber&#39;s Master,<br> named Sakura by her.</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> Thank you so, so much.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> Repair AIs can&#39;t ignore a formal request delivered<br> through official channels.</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> That call was something I tried only for the sake of<br> trying... Then why...?</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> You can tell just by looking that I&#39;m already partnered<br> with Assassin&#39;s party.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> So, you know... It&#39;s not like I&#39;m not trying to win the<br> Holy Grail War,</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> but I don&#39;t see that as a reason to cut myself off from<br> interaction with other AIs.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> My hope is to strengthen our connections, even.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> And, you know, you don&#39;t abandon others for no<br> reason, right?</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> I have to say it again... Thank you so, so much.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> We don&#39;t need thanks. We did what anyone would.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> But now that we&#39;ve calmed down, time for some<br> proper observation. Not you either...? I want someone a<br> bit more...</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> What are you doing to Sakura? Get any closer to her<br> and I&#39;ll kill you on the spot.</p><p><strong>I：Duryodhana:</strong><br> Oho, a dangerous lady with amazing curves...<br> Not you either. Yeah, no.</p><p><strong>I：Duryodhana:</strong><br> Heh, seem like neither of you ladies are my soulmate.</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> I don&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking about, but—</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> You&#39;d better not think that you saving Sakura means<br> she owes you anything.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> (Saber Medusa...)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> (She feels slightly younger...)</p><hr><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> I don&#39;t mind. Berserker might be thinking about who<br> owes us, but I don&#39;t.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> Anyways, the Repair forces should be joining us at<br> any moment.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> We can fix all the damaged Grow girls.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> Now the big question is location. Are we okay to<br> gather where we are?</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> Well, that depends on where Caster—that giant<br> monster—will go.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> If he&#39;s after us, then we should stay on the run.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Wait a second. Wasn&#39;t he forbidden to attack AIs in<br> the Defend area?</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> If we fully enter the central area, which is not far from<br> here,</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> then at the very least, we won&#39;t have to fear any<br> danger to the AIs.</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> True.</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> We have a good shot with that, so I&#39;ll message all the<br> Grow girls telling them to flee to the central partition if<br> they can.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> Yeah, good! Then we&#39;ll go further in and build our<br> field hospital there.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> I can&#39;t recommend that, unfortunately.</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> Who&#39;s there?</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> You&#39;re...the prime Defend AI, right?</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> Yeah, DX. Why are you here?</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> Wait, this place is bordering Defend, so there&#39;s<br> nothing particularly weird about your presence.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> ...Your statement intrigues me. Which of our actions<br> are you considering unrecommendable?</p><p><strong>DX:</strong><br> This question has multiple answers.</p><p><strong>DX:</strong><br> To allow a mass of Grow AI to join with a mass of<br> Repair AI arrived to fix them. And to gather them in the<br> Defend partition.</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> Wait a second. Are you forbidding them to evacuate to<br> Defend&#39;s area?</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> As far as I know, Defend&#39;s rule of neutrality includes<br> becoming a place of refuge during emergencies.</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> Much like the church in the center is for Holy Grail<br> War participants, the AIs need Defend to–</p><p><strong>DX:</strong><br> ...Agreed. That is correct. But I must clarify.</p><p><strong>DX:</strong><br> The neutrality provision of the AI in Defend is not<br> functioning.</p><p><strong>DX:</strong><br> The giant monster amalgamation of Caster&#39;s<br> familiars—identified by the title “worm fiends”,</p><p><strong>DX:</strong><br> has currently invaded the central area and is eating<br> every D-type in its path.</p><h2 id="section-6-covetous-veneration-for-eating" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-6-covetous-veneration-for-eating" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 6: Covetous Veneration/for eating</h2><h3 id="arrow-1-4" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#arrow-1-4" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Arrow 1</h3><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> Wh-what do you mean!?</p><p><strong>DX:</strong><br> Exactly what I said. The neutrality regulations are not<br> being respected.</p><p><strong>DX:</strong><br> We speculate that an unidentified glitch occurred in<br> Caster&#39;s Master, the prime Build AI&#39;s programming.</p><p><strong>DX:</strong><br> Caster&#39;s supersized worm fiend is in the vicinity of<br> coordinates 17-50, indiscriminately preying upon<br> nearby AI.</p><p><strong>DX:</strong><br> There is no distinguishing between G-type refugees,<br> the intercepting D-types, or other AI who happened<br> to be in the area.</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>DX:</strong><br> The situation is clearly abnormal.</p><p><strong>DX:</strong><br> Thus, the general supervisor AI suggested I be sent<br> here, where multiple Servants are gathered.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> Rani XII&#39;s orders... Eh, whatever. Why does the<br> number of Servants here matter?</p><p><strong>DX:</strong><br> The general supervisor AI declares that—<br> the AI Holy Grail War is suspended,</p><p><strong>DX:</strong><br> and, under her overseer jurisdiction, proposes that we<br> all cooperate to eliminate the potentially rampaging<br> Caster.</p><p><strong>DX:</strong><br> Message to all Servants here:<br> Gather at the church with your Masters.</p><p><strong>DX:</strong><br> Saber. Berserker. Assassin...</p><p><strong>DX:</strong><br> And Lancer.</p><p><strong>Lancer:</strong><br> Sure thing.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...!</p><hr><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> (Where have I seen him before?)</p><hr><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> Lancer. How long have you been here?</p><p><strong>Lancer:</strong><br> You&#39;re at the border of my territory.</p><p><strong>Lancer:</strong><br> I was just headed home with my ingredients when it<br> suddenly got real noisy behind me.</p><p><strong>Lancer:</strong><br> I wish I were considering the best way to use what I<br> procured, but I had to at least check on what was going<br> on.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> I smell another Indian god here.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> Yours is...Vayu, the wind god...?</p><p><strong>Lancer:</strong><br> Yup. I&#39;m Vayu&#39;s son.</p><p><strong>Lancer:</strong><br> By the way, my big bro is Dharma&#39;s son, and my little<br> bros are Indra&#39;s son and the sons of the Asvinau twins.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> I knew it was you. Bhima...!</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> Hey, Duryodhana... Fancy meeting you here.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Bhima, son of the wind god Vayu. Fujimaru,<br> do you understand the implications of this?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> He&#39;s...Arjuna&#39;s brother...right?</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> Hm? Your Master knows Arjuna?</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> He&#39;s the GOAT. I couldn&#39;t ask for a better brother.</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> Though he might have been serious to a troublesome<br> degree, not that I think he ever caused anyone real<br> problems.</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> But don&#39;t mind it, that&#39;s just how he is. Hahahaha!</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> Ah, I&#39;m here talking as if you were his allies,<br> but I still don&#39;t know if you actually were. Eh,<br> I&#39;m sure you were, you wouldn&#39;t still be alive otherwise.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> He&#39;s one of the five Pandava princes.</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> Hoh? Sure, I suppose a Master with a Hindu Divine<br> Spirit would know that.</p><hr><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> (One of the five Pandava princes and Arjuna&#39;s older<br> brother, yes. But not only that. Bhima the Mightiest...)</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> (And the person most deeply associated with him in<br> folklore is—)</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> Don&#39;t give me that glare, Duryodhana.</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> Now&#39;s not the time for it.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> Wh-wh-what did you say!?</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> He&#39;s right, though. I don&#39;t know what history binds<br> you and this Lancer,</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> but the situation with the AIs and Caster&#39;s supersized<br> creature is more important.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> Rani XII told us to come to her church, right?</p><p><strong>DX:</strong><br> Correct. Rider is absent here, but another<br> spokesperson relayed him the instructions.</p><p><strong>DX:</strong><br> This is a formal request from the overseer. You must<br> obey if possible.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> We have to deal with Caster one way or the other.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Let&#39;s go!</p><hr><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> Sure, the more people we have hitting that big lug,<br> the better.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> Less work per person.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> Hmph. I don&#39;t mind going to the church, but definitely<br> not with him.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> I can never know when he&#39;ll stab me in the back.</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> I&#39;d never be so cowardly.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> You lowlife, who do you think you&#39;re talking to?</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> (Whoa, he got all red. That&#39;s some real deep-seated<br> hatred.)</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> I don&#39;t want to make friends with anyone either.<br> We just need to all ultimately arrive at the church, right?</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> Then we&#39;ll go our own way.<br> ...Sakura.</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> R-right.</p><p><strong>DX:</strong><br> I request you gather as swiftly as possible.</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> You don&#39;t have to tell us. We&#39;ll probably be the first<br> there.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> Whoa, she jumped away bridal-carrying her girl.</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> I gotta go back to pick up my Master.</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> But I&#39;m the son of the wind god. My huge physique<br> doesn&#39;t slow me down at all.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> Let&#39;s go.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> Ah, wait for me.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> These are unforeseen circumstances, but at the very<br> least, we managed to confirm who all the Servants are.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Let&#39;s review all the information we have on the way to<br> the church—</p><h3 id="arrow-2-2" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#arrow-2-2" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Arrow 2</h3><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> (Sulk)</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> You can&#39;t even bother hiding your bad mood.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> It&#39;s about Lancer, right? He&#39;s someone you knew?</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> Silence. Don&#39;t ask.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> Nuh-uh...I will ask! Because you&#39;re not gonna tell me if<br> I don&#39;t!</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> We&#39;re talking about a Servant that might become our<br> enemy in the Holy Grail War.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> It&#39;s only natural that your Master would want to know.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> If you won&#39;t talk,</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> we could always present all objective information we<br> know to Ayus, from top to bottom.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> It might contain details you&#39;ll find inaccurate or<br> unpleasant,</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> but if hearing from you is not an option...</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> WHA... Wait, stop!</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> I can tell all you have to say is worthless nonsense<br> saying I&#39;m the irredeemable villain or that everything is<br> Duryodhana&#39;s fault!</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> Fine then, I&#39;ll tell a bit of the story.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> His group of five brothers were the enemies of us one<br> hundred princes.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> But since we hailed from the same country,<br> we all learned martial arts under the same mentor.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> I see. And why did you become enemies? Why do you<br> hate him so much, Berserker?</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Family trouble is the simplest way to put it.<br> A question of who rightfully deserved to inherit the<br> kingdom—</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> Quiet, you.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> There were many reasons, quite a lot of them...</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> But the short of it is that they were a dirty pack of<br> misunderstanders who didn&#39;t know their place.<br> That&#39;s all.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> My instincts tell me the short of it isn&#39;t saying enough.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> No, it is. That&#39;s how it always has been. That&#39;s why<br> yours truly and my brothers had been fighting them<br> endlessly.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> And the biggest eyesore of the bunch is that guy<br> Bhima. Ever since he was a brat, he was all like,<br> “Look how big and burly I am. Look how strong I am.”<br> Repulsive.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> My only option to oppose him was the brilliant idea to<br> put him to sleep with poison, tie him up before he woke<br> up, and throw him down the river.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> (Speechless)</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> And SOMEHOW, the guy ended up in the Patala realm,<br> where he drank the Nagaraja&#39;s Amrita and came back<br> stronger!</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> How unfair! Unforgivable!</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> Later I took away everything he had in a dice gamble...<br> Though that only worked thanks to Uncle Shakuni...</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> And then, right, when they were exiled to the woods,<br> I visited them to point and laugh,</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> but then I needed them to save me when I was<br> captured by some gandharvas! Oh, the humiliation!</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> Okay! You&#39;ve heard enough to understand how evil<br> they are.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> It&#39;s only natural that I wouldn&#39;t even want to talk to<br> their ilk. Understand me!</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> Well...okay. You must have been through a lot...<br> And so had they.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> Hmph. That&#39;s enough talk. Get moving. We&#39;re almost<br> at the church.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> What a blatant attempt to force the conversation to<br> an end.

It&#39;s been clear<br> for a while that they were doing whatever without a<br> care for anything.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> Managing AI is an element of this Holy Grail War.<br> Any action that doesn&#39;t affect the world as a whole...</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> is accepted as valid strategy–but causing a<br> stampede in the central area is too blatantly unlawful<br> to allow.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> I can safely say he crossed the line.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> And why do we have to do your dirty work?</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> It&#39;s a known fact that the fighting strength of a<br> Servant can only be contained by you, the other<br> Servants.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> You could say all the Raniment in the world currently<br> revolves around you.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> Parameter-based reasons aside, I understand you<br> question the necessity of this based on your role and<br> position.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> As such, I, the overseer, prepared a reward for<br> participation in this operation.</p><p><strong>Lainur:</strong><br> Oh? And what would that be?</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> I promise to share the additional Command Spells<br> available to the overseer.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> Needless to say, those are supercompressed charges<br> of Raniment customized for usage among System Grail<br> War Masters.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> They will prove useful in future battles.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> Aw. That&#39;s nice!</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Wow... Would it be right to interpret that you&#39;ll be<br> granting them to everyone here who agrees to<br> participate?</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> That may produce unfair results depending on the size<br> of one&#39;s contributions.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> While it might be difficult to achieve total fairness,<br> I&#39;ll trust the logs and observation of the Defend AIs.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> If someone plays a decisive role alone, without<br> cooperating with others, they&#39;ll be singularly rewarded.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> If you all split tasks as a team, you all stand to be<br> rewarded.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> Deciding what to do here is another element of the<br> Holy Grail War.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> I don&#39;t think anyone can go out and beat that thing<br> alone. We&#39;re better off joining forces.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Agreed!</p><hr><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> Me too... I agree.</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> Many of Grow&#39;s girls must still be near him.<br> I can&#39;t let harm come to them.</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> I&#39;ll pass.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> ...!</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> I&#39;ve considered it, and decided I got better things to<br> do.</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> With this many people teaming up, you won&#39;t need my<br> help. You can deal with it.</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> That&#39;s what you&#39;ve decided after dragging me all the<br> way out here?</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> Everyone&#39;s here. It&#39;d be rude if we didn&#39;t at least<br> show our faces. But that never meant we were going to<br> listen and follow what they said.</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> You didn&#39;t mention any penalties, am I right?</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> ...Correct. I made the request to everyone, but it was<br> nothing more than a request. You are not forced to<br> abide.</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> No problem, then. I&#39;ll be the only one missing out on a<br> bonus, but that&#39;s no bother.</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> Our delicious dinner is a bonus only I&#39;ll get.<br> No big difference there. Things are even.</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> I really don&#39;t understand you. No, I kinda do, but...</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> Well... I do agree that we&#39;d just get in everyone&#39;s way<br> if you don&#39;t feel up for it. So—</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> It&#39;s all right, Cerejeira.</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> Everyone has their own things they&#39;re good at...<br> We&#39;ve got everyone else here.</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> And I look forward to the tasty dishes you&#39;ll make for<br> us.</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> Once things calm down, I&#39;ll make sure to go check<br> what delicacies my materials are being used for.</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> Sure...</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> We couldn&#39;t unite everyone, but this response still falls<br> within the predicted range.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> Then I&#39;ll give you the information necessary to solve<br> the situation.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> Caster&#39;s Supersized Worm Fiend&#39;s presumed<br> movement routine...</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> ...is heading in the direction that allows it to obtain the<br> most Raniment.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> Towards any place populated with AI. Or preferably<br> to the closest location, as far as we speculate.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> If more than one choice is available, it&#39;ll opt for the<br> one containing the largest group.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> Its current location is in the north part of the Defend<br> partition, coordinates 10-14. It&#39;s been heading south<br> ever since its emergence in Grow...</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> Meaning the central part of Defend is within its route.<br> It might be trying to reach the church.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> This would mean it entered Defend because the<br> population of AIs stationed in Defend...</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> ...came to outnumber the population of scattered AIs<br> running for their lives in Grow.</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> It&#39;s not your fault, Sakura. It&#39;s Defend who are to<br> blame for failing to solve the problem.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> More importantly, is this church the creature&#39;s<br> ultimate goal?</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> If Caster detects Raniment quantity, then I can&#39;t deny<br> the possibility he&#39;s after what&#39;s stored here...</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> The spare Command Spells intended to be delivered<br> to you,</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> and the nucleus Raniment used to operate the system.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> Assuming its rampage is commanded by a purely<br> mechanical routine, then we&#39;re mostly guaranteed<br> that&#39;s what he&#39;s working toward.</p><p><strong>Lainur:</strong><br> So that gives us a pretty good picture of its route.</p><p><strong>Lainur:</strong><br> Hah. In that case–it&#39;s obvious what we gotta do.<br> We&#39;re taking our leave, if you&#39;ll excuse us.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> Huh!? Weren&#39;t we all doing this together!?</p><p><strong>Lainur:</strong><br> Nah, not seeing that future. Do whatever you want.</p><p><strong>Lainur:</strong><br> See ya. Let&#39;s go, Rider.</p><p><strong>Gao Changgong:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> Talk about uncooperative!</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> And here I was thinking I&#39;d have less work cut out for<br> me. Now we&#39;ve ended up with only three Servants left.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> Weird... Definitely weird.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> How could he prioritize anything other than battle?</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> Is he...truly Bhima...?</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> Hey, don&#39;t go spacing out, Berserker!</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> I don&#39;t know what everyone&#39;s up to, but now we&#39;ve<br> gotta do it on our own!</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> We&#39;ve got to think about how we&#39;ll fight here!</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Now that we know where the enemy is headed<br> toward, we can either wait in its path or intercept it.<br> Those are the basic possibilities.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> The opponent will be stronger than it was the<br> previous times we fought.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Which means we need an advantage we didn&#39;t have<br> before.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> So here is my question:</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Rani XII. With this being a formal request from the<br> overseer, don&#39;t you have some sort of plan to<br> accommodate us?</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> —Suggestion accepted.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> I&#39;ll offer certain quantities of pre-stocked Raniment at<br> my discretion.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Excellent.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> So what makes this battle different from the previous<br> ones is our stock of resources, and the geographical<br> advantage of the point at which we&#39;ll be waiting for the<br> enemy.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> And—</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Then there&#39;s you, Saber.</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> You&#39;re ordering me to work?</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> For what other reason would you have remained here?</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> Saber, please.</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> ...(Sigh)</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> It&#39;s true, this battle is not like the one in Grow.</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> There will be no G-types around us. Nor any facilities I<br> need to worry about.</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> I have enough Raniment in the tank... I can fight as<br> hard as I want.</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> Although, honestly, I&#39;d rather not have to give it my all<br> when anyone can see me.</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> Are you all right with this, Sakura? This will end with<br> us showing our hand to them.</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> I don&#39;t think we have any other choice...</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> If we don&#39;t do what it takes to get rid of that Caster,<br> we won&#39;t be able to return to Grow.</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> I just wanna go back to the place I love. To spend<br> those quiet times with everyone like we always did...</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> Got it... I&#39;ll do what I must.</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> But since I&#39;ll be going all out, I&#39;ll need all of you to<br> contribute too.</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> You&#39;re not allowed to slack off like the ones who ran<br> away.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> Slacking off is all I wanted, but guess I can&#39;t say no<br> here.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> Our number one slacker, Berserker, has something<br> else occupying his mind right now.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> We need someone on duty kicking his butt to make<br> him work.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> Oh, I can help with kicking his butt!<br> And I can also heal it perfectly if it gets sore!</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> But what are our chances of victory, Saber?</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> We won&#39;t know until we try,</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> but at very least, since collateral damage is not a<br> problem,</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> it becomes a competition between me and that worm<br> fiend...</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> To decide which of us is the greater rampaging<br> monster—</p><h3 id="arrow-3-pre-battle-4" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#arrow-3-pre-battle-4" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Arrow 3 Pre-Battle</h3><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> The creature advances.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I seek only to fulfill my simple and clear desires,<br> as permitted to me.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> To devour.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> To trample over the weak, to rip apart those who owe<br> him complete obedience—to end their lives.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Ah—Ah!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Acknowledgments of terror. Wishes for escape denied.<br> Eyes enlightened to their fates. Screams sweet as<br> nectar.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Have you ever been inside a creature&#39;s mouth before?<br> Yes? No?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Both answers are the same.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> It&#39;s like the red room. This has the same color, smell,<br> and screams as that room decorated with foolish<br> brides... Thus, the same taste.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I need no longer wait for any sacrifices.<br> I can simply walk towards new brides.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I understand what its body is.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I can smell it on its skin.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Could it be? Yes, it is. The taboo overflowing from the<br> room is now me.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I am the forbidden room.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> You mustn&#39;t look at it. Never ever look at it.<br> (Though l leave the key in your hands.)</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> You mustn&#39;t enter it. Never ever enter it.<br> (Though l leave the key in your hands.)</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I can&#39;t tell what I&#39;d do if you disobey this, my wife<br> beloved—</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> But now you&#39;re looking at it. Now your scared eyes<br> are looking at I, the room.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> That&#39;s no different from being inside.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Where&#39;s my next wife? Where is the wife bearing my<br> magic key—?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> —Who am I?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Of course I know.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I exist to understand everything.<br> I exist to reach the ideal.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> The logos of the world. The alpha and the omega.<br> The absolute laws of creation.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> The Root.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Thus, I couldn&#39;t go on without knowing who I am.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> The prime Build AI. Caster&#39;s Master.<br> —Makiri Zolgen. A superior magus.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> The last pure-blooded Makiri, and the greatest<br> successor the family ever had. The perfect one,<br> incapable of failure.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I don&#39;t know the meaning of those words, but I<br> understand their essence. That&#39;s who I am.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Which is why—</p><p><strong>Makiri:</strong><br> Haha... Hahahahaha!<br> Yes, YES, YES!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> This exhilaration from seeing how the trump card I<br> analyzed Caster&#39;s Noble Phantasm to construct is<br> performing almost perfectly,</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> combined with the relief from finding confirmation of<br> my competence, vibrated the air in my lungs in the form<br> of laughter.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> On the other hand, something else in my chest<br> squirmed.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> —Am I justified?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> No.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Nay. Wrong. This very question is mistaken.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Victory justifies everything.<br> Reaching the ideal justifies everything.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> That&#39;s the magus he was—and that&#39;s how I,<br> born as him, operate.</p><p><strong>Makiri:</strong><br> Yes. I must reach the ideal.</p><p><strong>Makiri:</strong><br> For that purpose...I have things I ought to discard...<br> and feelings I ought to kill off...!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> If I had to point at one fatal fallacy to the current<br> version of my blueprint,</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> it would certainly be its pitiful resilience.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I&#39;ve been dissatisfied at how one as competent as<br> myself was forced to disengage and retreat over<br> numerical disadvantages.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> And what I used to clear up this accumulated<br> dissatisfaction...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> was a trump card that sacrificed handling to display<br> my competency through extra power.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> And that went beyond expectations.<br> It went beyond my estimated margin.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Unable to withstand the inflexibility of the mold I<br> established for it, its contents are—overflowing as<br> they will.</p><p><strong>Makiri:</strong><br> Haha... Hahaha...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> As such, all creaks of humanity supposedly remaining<br> in me are gone.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> All that&#39;s left is the purest form of a magus,<br> simply pursuing the ideal in the name of logic.</p><p><strong>Makiri:</strong><br> Ah, yes.</p><p><strong>Makiri:</strong><br> Rules? Neutrality? Who cares?</p><p><strong>Makiri:</strong><br> Look at this power. Look at this all-consuming power.</p><p><strong>Makiri:</strong><br> Since I&#39;m the most superior being in existence and it&#39;s<br> all but guaranteed that I&#39;ll become the next lord of this<br> world,</p><p><strong>Makiri:</strong><br> and if that&#39;s the one fastest road to the ideal,</p><p><strong>Makiri:</strong><br> what could possibly be wrong with me consuming<br> everything in the old world—?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Only one end awaits models not built for resilience.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> They break.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Reviewing the operation one last time.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> We&#39;re following a simple formula, but we have to go<br> over it one more time from the top to make sure<br> everything is in order.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Completely agreed.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Do your thing, boss.</p><hr><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> The enemy, Caster&#39;s Supersized Worm Fiend,<br> is heading south as predicted. Marching at 97% the<br> calculated pace.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> We must thank the unfortunate AIs who fell victim to it,<br> unable to escape despite making optimal decisions,</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> and the work of the Defend AIs killed in action.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> True. Now is not the time to be gloomy about it.<br> We need to do our best to avoid greater casualties.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Exactly.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Our final objective is eliminating Caster and the<br> Supersized Worm Fiend he&#39;s merged with.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Dealing with the medium and small worm fiends<br> present around it is also a necessity,</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> but it&#39;s predicted they&#39;ll vanish if their controller,<br> Caster, is defeated. We don&#39;t need to crush all of<br> them.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> What&#39;s important is to clean up the fodder in front of<br> the Supersized Worm Fiend and halt its march.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Since the creature detects AIs with Raniment,</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> it&#39;s natural to assume it also detects Servants,<br> which hold higher concentrations of Raniment.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> In short, we&#39;ll eliminate the surrounding worm fiends,<br> attracting the Supersized&#39;s attention,</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> and attack the main body whenever possible to<br> whittle it down—That&#39;s our part.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> Naaah, I&#39;ll pass. Sweeping small fry is no job for a<br> prince.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> No complaining!</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> (...But is he back in the mood? Not that he was<br> supposed to make strategic decisions for such spoiled<br> reasons though!)</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> So the whole point here is...we&#39;re the decoy.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> I&#39;m the god of love.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> I&#39;m an awful pick for these meatheaded tasks like<br> blowing away the giant monster or physically wearing<br> it down with overwhelming destructive force.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> I&#39;ll do what I can even if I&#39;m not cut out for it,<br> but are you really sure we can leave the job to her?</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> If I&#39;m the only option, that&#39;s how it has to be.<br> If anyone else is qualified, I can swap places.</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> I don&#39;t think anyone is.</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> Taking off a couple legs probably won&#39;t be enough to<br> stop that giant monster.</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> I think the only way to go is through its heart...<br> killing its core, which is presumably Caster. The big<br> problem is:</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> We don&#39;t know where in that huge body Caster is.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> True. We&#39;re searching for that specific point,<br> but we&#39;ve yet to have a clear answer.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> (Sakura... The prime Grow AI. She seems to have a<br> non-combative personality, much like Ayus.)</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> (But I see she still has the capabilities of a Master...)</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> With Saber&#39;s full power, we can...</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> Oh. We can find where the damned Caster is?</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> No. I can fillet the whole fish and petrify each piece.<br> If I keep doing that, I&#39;ll eventually get to the right part.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> Oh, fine. A lot less technical than I expected.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> All right then, that sort of unappealing manual labor is<br> not for me. You can handle it.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> This talk about having to find him reminded me of one thing.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> What about the option of targeting his Master?</p><hr><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> It&#39;s a possible solution, naturally. The idea is to sever<br> his root source of magical energy.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> But the fact that the monster is self-sustaining is a<br> serious obstacle to this approach.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> The Master needs to stay at a safe distance from the<br> hubbub, but that doesn&#39;t mean he&#39;s within our reach.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> The enemy is aware that eliminating the Master is an<br> option, so he should be doing everything he can to hide<br> himself.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> We must consider it unrealistic to locate the Master<br> within our limited time frame.</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> Looking at him really upset me for some reason,<br> so I&#39;d ideally prefer to win by crushing that Master&#39;s<br> head.</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> But if that&#39;s impossible, I suppose we have to deal<br> with the big guy.</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> By the way...can you two stand side by side?</p><p><strong>Both:</strong><br> ...?</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> (They feel similar... Yet different... Maybe opposites.<br> Eh, doesn&#39;t matter.)</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> —Don&#39;t mind me. Anyways, we have a plan.</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> I&#39;ll be waiting somewhere easier for me to deal the<br> first strike.</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> Then I&#39;ll take the first step when I find the chance and<br> you follow up after me.</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> Wait, Saber...</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> Sorry, people. I&#39;ll also be moving to my post. Bye.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> Ah, wait. How are you feeling in the parts I healed<br> before?</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> I&#39;m curious since it was my first time healing a Master.</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> I&#39;m perfectly fine, thank you very much.</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> Look how full of energy I am.<br> Heya!</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> Really?

I can&#39;t be<br> satisfied with this!</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> Just be happy it&#39;s over and that everyone&#39;s safe.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> It IS over...right?</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> I&#39;ve confirmed Caster&#39;s Supersized Worm Fiend&#39;s<br> erasure.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> Congratulations to all fighters.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> Whoa, the general supervisor&#39;s exclusive transmission!<br> So cool.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> Excellent.</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> Phew...</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> Great job, Saber!

I just did what I had to.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> Fine, if you say it&#39;s over, then it is. So where&#39;s my<br> reward?</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> Hello?</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> I am in the middle of an intracerebral debate.<br> Please hold.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> Definition verified. Information acquired. Records<br> reproduced... Circumstances inputted. Deliberation.<br> Comparison. Deliberation. Comparison. Contradiction<br> search.<br> —No objections.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> Conclusion derived.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> The decisive factor in this result was the termination<br> of functions for the Master of Caster.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> I regard accomplishing that as the greatest<br> contribution,</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> and will grant the Command Spell reward to the<br> Master of who did it.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> That said, I&#39;m in no way inflexible.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> I&#39;ll reimburse the expended Raniment for all<br> participants later on.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> Message over. I expect more from you in the upcoming<br> battles. You&#39;re cordially invited to start them.<br> Yours sincerely, Rani XII.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> Wh-WHAAAAAAT!? After all we did, all we get is a<br> reimbursement!?</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> You can&#39;t trick me!<br> This is a SCAM!</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> I figured that&#39;s how things would turn out.</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> But one thing is for sure... That monster is dead.</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> No one else from Grow, or any other AI, will be eaten...</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> Our usual peace will return to Grow. I can go back to<br> the work I love. That&#39;s great news.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> It&#39;s a shame we didn&#39;t get any Command Spells,</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> but you&#39;re right that peace is an important reward.</p><hr><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> Peace doesn&#39;t fill anyone&#39;s stomach. It&#39;s absurd that<br> yours truly&#39;s combat spectacle didn&#39;t return any profit.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> I&#39;d never spare any efforts to get what I want,</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> but I&#39;m quite disinclined to spare efforts for what I<br> don&#39;t want. It&#39;s humiliating...!</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> Quit grumbling!</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> I agree, it&#39;s a shame we didn&#39;t get a Command Spell,<br> but you can say our battle earned us a big chance to<br> make money.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> It&#39;s not a thing we should be celebrating, but facts are<br> facts.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> Now that the creature is dead, the next thing to do<br> is—</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> The damage treatment phase. We&#39;ve got injured<br> Defend and Grow AIs all over the place, and more.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> Meaning now is the time we of Repair really earn our<br> bread! We have no time to complain!</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> Woohoo! Repairing spirit!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> She&#39;s on fire...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> We&#39;ll help too.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> Will you? Thanks!</p><hr><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> (Sigh) That was a waste of labor if I ever saw one.<br> All that work and all we get is our costs expensed.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> What was the name for this again?<br> Job satisfaction exploitation?</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> Job satisfaction, huh... Despite everything, I did my<br> best, you know...? (Glances)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Right. I should have said it earlier,</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> but thank you for your hard work.</p><hr><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> Ehehe. That&#39;s what I wanted to hear.

Wh-what?</p><p><strong>B：Rani-K:</strong><br> It&#39;s time for our regular replenishment.</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> Sure. Good idea.</p><p><strong>C：Rani-K:</strong><br> I feel strangely defeated saying this,</p><p><strong>C：Rani-K:</strong><br> but his methods are effective and capable of<br> increasing the motivation parameter.</p><p><strong>C：Rani-K:</strong><br> With this logical reason as basis, I&#39;m not frustrated<br> about it. Yes, it bears repeating: I am not frustrated.</p><p><strong>C：Rani-K:</strong><br> Which brings us to our question: may we have some<br> of the new model of processed materials...<br> a.k.a., a “dish”?</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> Don&#39;t you all normally say “We don&#39;t need creativity.<br> Stability first and foremost”?</p><p><strong>D：Rani-K:</strong><br> That&#39;s what we thought.

It&#39;s–</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> Wait! You don&#39;t need to give your opinion!</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> I already know how questionable this is compared to<br> his cooking!</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> This was just emergency provisions, or like,</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> a momentary diversion from the concept of cooking<br> you&#39;re all so starved for...</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> Don&#39;t mind the taste, really.</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> That what you think? Tastes quite decent to me.<br> (Munch)</p><p><strong>F：Cerejeira:</strong><br> GAAH!</p><p><strong>F：Cerejeira:</strong><br> Wh-when did you come back, Lancer!?</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> Just got here. And no sooner did I notice this great<br> smell.</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> You&#39;re pretty decent, Master.</p><p><strong>F：Cerejeira:</strong><br> Enough flattery... Be honest with me...</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> But I was being honest. This stuff is decent.<br> Plain, but not bad.</p><p><strong>F：Cerejeira:</strong><br> Compared to yours, “decent” means “ignorable”.</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> That&#39;s not how it works...</p><p><strong>C：Rani-K:</strong><br> Agreed. As I was ordered to not give an opinion,<br> I&#39;ll give you only a score.</p><p><strong>D：Rani-K:</strong><br> By our combined evaluations, your dish scores<br> 231 points. Congratulations.

I can&#39;t react to that without knowing the average<br> or max score.</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> I already suspected it&#39;d be the case, but Master,<br> you can cook when you try.</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> That&#39;s the biggest surprise to me.</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> Well... For whatever it&#39;s worth, I&#39;m the prime Keep AI,<br> supposedly. You&#39;ve already seen me convert and<br> process materials before.</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> I can cook. And that&#39;s as far as I go.</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> And I knew my girls wanted their replenishment,<br> no matter what the form.</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> With them asking me to cook, I decided on a whim on<br> doing this... Agh, enough.</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> I wouldn&#39;t have done a recipe this low-effort if I knew<br> you were home.</p><p><strong>B：Rani-K:</strong><br> Thank you for the meal. I am replenished.</p><p><strong>C：Rani-K:</strong><br> Confirmed increase of the new status: “Satisfied with<br> flavor”.

Danger.</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> You cooked because they asked. And they&#39;re satisfied.</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> Nothing to feel bad about here.</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> I&#39;m not sure on that one.</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> Fine. But I am.</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> By the way, why did you make each of them pour<br> different powders on their plates?</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> You saw that? Yeah, that was just some custom<br> fine-tuning.</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> What&#39;s best for a girl with fatigued legs is different for<br> what&#39;s best for a girl with fatigued arms.</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> Since the taste would be middling anyways,<br> I thought the food could at least have that going for it.</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> (For all her constant lack of confidence, she actually<br> pays a lot of attention to her team.)</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> (Did she get these observation skills from her habit of<br> keeping a diary?)</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> What&#39;s the dumb smile for?</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> Nothing. To be honest, you&#39;re better than I thought,<br> Master.</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> Are you mocking me?</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> I mean it, 100%.</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> Oh look, there&#39;s still some food left in the pan.</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> Perfect, I hadn&#39;t snatched enough off of their plates.<br> Don&#39;t mind if I eat all that!</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> Ah, stop. My cooking is worse than yours.<br> Why would you—</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> Why would I care? Master, you put effort into this<br> meal. Nothing can make it not special.</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> Hoho, I&#39;ve never seen this vegetable before.</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> So that&#39;s what it tastes like. Is this the kind of stuff<br> you like, Master? Uh-huh, the different flavors are well<br> harmonized. I could eat this all day long.</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> By the way... One more important question.</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> What were you doing? Where have you been?</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> Oh, just popped out real quick to kill Caster&#39;s Master.</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> ...Pardon?</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> Hold up, was that a joke or...?</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> No joke. I did it with my own hands. It was surprisingly<br> easy. Don&#39;t know what happened to Caster himself,<br> though.</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> No way... No, you wouldn&#39;t lie about this. Then, really?</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> In that case, uh, what was it...? Search rules—</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> What happens if a Master dies first in combat?</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> By accessing the defeated Master&#39;s AI Core,</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> the winning Master can obtain their remaining<br> Command Spell, if available, and the leadership rights<br> to their partition—</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> Hey...did you perhaps, grab some kind of core?</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> Hm? I won&#39;t mince words here. I didn&#39;t bother!</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> (Sigh) Of course not...</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> (What are in the implications of this, rule-wise?<br> Isn&#39;t that super bad? How will the overseer...<br> the general supervisor respond to it?)</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> (Or is there an automatic fix in place?<br> ...I don&#39;t know...)</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> You look quite troubled. Your brows are furrowed<br> deeper than ever.</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> Need some food too?</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> I&#39;d never eat that. It&#39;s the last thing I want.</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> Hahaha! I know I&#39;m the one who suggested, but yeah,<br> your own food being what satisfied you would hurt my<br> pride real bad.</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> All right, this was a great reference for the next recipe<br> I&#39;m about to develop!</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> My table prep got rid of your misgivings, so next time<br> will be when I make something that reaches your heart!</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> (Misgivings. I&#39;m filled with anxiety and guilt.)</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> (Can anything seriously get rid of them...?)</p><h3 id="arrow-2-3" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#arrow-2-3" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Arrow 2</h3><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> This goes here, cover this part...and done!<br> All right, that&#39;s all. Now you just rest!</p><p><strong>Rani-D=spot:</strong><br> My thanks. I have a little to spare for you.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> Really?

Just lie down and I&#39;ll come to you!</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> I&#39;ll shut down your mind for the treatment,<br> but don&#39;t worry about it. Okay, here goes—</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> Phew...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You&#39;ve done a lot.</p><hr><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> On a quick break? Good. I guarantee it will increase<br> your work efficiency in the long run.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> You&#39;re better off leaving the treatments to the arrived<br> R-type reinforcements for a while.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> You two were also of great help.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> Things turned out alright in the end, but with how big<br> that mad monster was...</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> Yeah, there&#39;s a lot of damage... I can&#39;t help but sigh.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> Sure, but don&#39;t you find it better than doing nothing?</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> True. You significantly minimized the damage.<br> That much is evident.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Before, you weren&#39;t even able to carry the AIs to<br> places better suited for healing.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> R-right. Still... Still...</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> It&#39;s so...stressful.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> Fixing people&#39;s damage is Repair&#39;s duty, and I&#39;d never<br> complain about it,</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> but that doesn&#39;t mean I want anyone to get hurt.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> Hey...one thing that crossed my mind. Families are<br> generally composed of people you care about, right?</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> So doesn&#39;t that mean that forming a family is giving<br> yourself more people to care about?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> That&#39;s right.</p><hr><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> I can imagine it. Someone I care about getting hurt...<br> I can feel my stomach area cramping.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> Once my wish is granted and we&#39;re all together in a<br> family—</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> It&#39;ll be even more stressful to see someone hurt than it<br> is now.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Yeah... Probably.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> Hehehe. Took you long enough to notice. Yes,<br> love and pain are two sides of the same coin.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> So you have to go out of your way to make sure no one gets hurt.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> Hehe, but that has its limits.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> Love and pain are two sides of the same coin.<br> You can&#39;t escape that.</p><hr><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> You can only connect to others because of love,<br> and their pain only reaches you because you&#39;re<br> connected.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> That&#39;s an inescapable principle. Love hurts.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> So—what will you do about it?<br> Are you giving up on familial love?</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> No. I don&#39;t wanna. I won&#39;t give up.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> Families have their problems. Even so...or perhaps<br> because of it,</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> I&#39;ll prepare myself to accept the bad parts,<br> determined to withstand the pain, perfectly aware of<br> the fact things can and will get rough at some point.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> I really feel like...I need to find myself a family.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> If you say so.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> —Break&#39;s over! Back to the healing spree!</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> You didn&#39;t find the time for a breather until now,<br> but the fact that you managed to force yourself to rest<br> here...</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> ...must mean the number of people asking for help<br> significantly decreased.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Are we almost done with the emergency relief?</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> No, I think we still got a lot of girls in need of repairs.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> But yeah... I think very few of them actively tried to<br> contact Repair.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Why would that be?</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> We AIs have a base routine of rewarding other AIs&#39;<br> services with Raniment.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> I think the injured who were low on Raniment couldn&#39;t<br> afford to ask for it.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> Basically, even if they saw us, they couldn&#39;t afford to<br> make a request for Repair.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> It&#39;s not physically impossible, but it does require a lot<br> of paperwork, which takes a while to process.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> Which is why we have to reach out to them.<br> It&#39;s a lot of work, but we have to—</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> Got it, dolts? Now is not the time to take things slow.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> Berserker! Where have you been all this time?</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> Doing what I had to.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> You say healing must prioritize those who have<br> Raniment and leave the rest for later?</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> That&#39;s not what a rightful nation looks like.<br> I must correct this situation.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> As such! Yours truly created contract tokens for AIs.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> It&#39;s a compressed file containing a mutual agreement<br> program saying they can pay the Raniment later.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> You may distribute them so they reach those in need.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> With this, the poor won&#39;t need to hesitate to accept<br> treatment.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> Wh-what happened to you, Berserker!? Your idea is<br> amazing, don&#39;t get me wrong, but did you hit your head<br> or something!?</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> You dolt, I just did what any royal would!</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> Did you not hear yours truly always telling you I&#39;m a<br> wise commander?</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> I saw the chance to prove it and I took it.<br> Fret not, hahahahahaha!</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> Either way, having this will increase the relief speed.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> I&#39;ll hand it over to the Repair girls and take it to those<br> in need!</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> All right, things are about get busy! My repair spirit is<br> pumped!</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> Sorry to interrupt the armchair tactician&#39;s feel-good<br> moment, but...</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> This contract token contains a fine-print agreement<br> for paying the base cost plus 40% interest.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Did I read this line correctly?</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> YOU DON&#39;T SAY!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You&#39;re not fooling anyone...</p><hr><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> How much of a money-worshipper do you have to be<br> to exploit moments of weakness with an unfair<br> contract?</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> The barely reasonable interest rate is the nastiest<br> part.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> How can you be this trashy of a person?<br> That&#39;s horribly Duryodhana of you.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> But oh well, the way you already have one foot<br> unsalvageably sunk into decadence is lovely to me.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> Wait, did you just nonchalantly use my name as an<br> insult?</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> ...(Sigh) You did make a fool out of yourself.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> Wh-what&#39;s wrong with it? Fairness and equality are<br> not the same thing!</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> Those who do special things are deserving of special<br> benefits!</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> That aside,</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> while she hadn&#39;t noticed when she was with us,<br> as the prime AI,</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Ayus will soon realize the contract token&#39;s mechanism.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> She should be easily able to overwrite and correct it.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> I say you&#39;re a fool for not imagining her opinions and<br> reaction,</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> regarding the act of exploiting injured people under<br> duress.</p><p><strong>A：Ayus&#39; voice approaching:</strong><br> BERSERKER! What&#39;s the meaning of this!?</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> Hmm...</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> She must be very busy, therefore I can&#39;t imagine her<br> dropping everything to discipline me.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> With that, I&#39;ll be making my escape for the moment!</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> I trust all of you to give her a nice-sounding<br> justification! You can say that...</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> In worry for my Master&#39;s overwork, my excessive<br> kindness drove me to want to give her<br> fair compensation.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> What a good-for-nothing he is.

Very predictable.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> He&#39;s charming. I can&#39;t dislike his antics.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> This sort of evaluation doesn&#39;t fall within my<br> jurisdiction...</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> But I can&#39;t deny I have a sort of psychological<br> affection for him. Is this a variant of the Charisma Skill?</p><hr><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Ultimately, the best way to sum him up is as...</p><hr><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> (Huff) (Huff)</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> Agh.

What an eyesore—</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> ...Hmph. I&#39;ll give you this sash. Use it to prop up your<br> broken arm.

It&#39;s a great point of overlook.<br> I can quite easily spot incoming enemies.</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> But conversely, it makes us more vulnerable to snipers.</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> And all those trees behind us obstruct my view.<br> That gives the opposite worries from—</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> Oh, c&#39;mon.</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> Yes, it is a good point of overlook.</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> This is my personal favorite place, a secret spot with<br> the best view of the Grow partition.</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> The breeze feels great here, so I thought you&#39;d enjoy<br> it too, Saber...</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> Yeah. It&#39;s not a bad place.</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> R-right? Great. Oh, you can sit here.</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> Doesn&#39;t it feel just like an arbor, with this Production<br> Tree for fruit-type materials serving as the roof?</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> Let&#39;s relax here.</p><p><strong>R：Sakura:</strong><br> Saber...I know you&#39;ve seen the outside world.</p><p><strong>R：Sakura:</strong><br> Sorry if this artificial scenery feels bleak compared to<br> what you know. The thought only now hit me.</p><p><strong>Q：Medusa:</strong><br> You&#39;re really late to the realization.<br> Everywhere in this world is artificial.</p><p><strong>Q：Medusa:</strong><br> Besides—</p><p><strong>R：Sakura:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Q：Medusa:</strong><br> The island where I lived was also quite bleak,<br> I feel like. I still prefer here to there.</p><p><strong>R：Sakura:</strong><br> R-really?</p><p><strong>Q：Medusa:</strong><br> Probably. I don&#39;t remember it clearly.</p><p><strong>R：Sakura:</strong><br> Tell me more about it. We haven&#39;t had the chance to<br> talk about it until now.</p><p><strong>Q：Medusa:</strong><br> Didn&#39;t I just tell you I don&#39;t remember?</p><p><strong>Q：Medusa:</strong><br> All I can remember is...my sisters.</p><p><strong>R：Sakura:</strong><br> Oh, but that&#39;s good enough. Perfect!</p><p><strong>Q：Medusa:</strong><br> Why are you clinging so much to this? It&#39;s a pointless<br> story. Knowing about it won&#39;t do you any good.</p><p><strong>R：Sakura:</strong><br> True, I suppose I was too excited. I wonder why?<br> Hmm...</p><p><strong>R：Sakura:</strong><br> I guess because...you&#39;re the first person I met who&#39;s<br> like me.</p><p><strong>R：Sakura:</strong><br> People the same age range, gender, and status...</p><p><strong>R：Sakura:</strong><br> They normally chat like this, no?</p><p><strong>Q：Medusa:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>R：Sakura:</strong><br> I truly am an AI.</p><p><strong>R：Sakura:</strong><br> Conversation is nothing more to me than a basic<br> function born out of necessity.</p><p><strong>R：Sakura:</strong><br> The ordinary AIs, both in Grow and elsewhere,<br> are all great girls, but they&#39;re built to do what I say.</p><p><strong>R：Sakura:</strong><br> It&#39;s not an equal relationship.</p><p><strong>R：Sakura:</strong><br> That&#39;s why you&#39;re the first opportunity to be with<br> someone I don&#39;t know...I think?</p><p><strong>R：Sakura:</strong><br> So I have like, a desire to learn, which makes me want<br> to interact even if our conversations are pointless.</p><p><strong>Q：Medusa:</strong><br> Your explanation does nothing to me. I&#39;m not an AI.</p><p><strong>R：Sakura:</strong><br> Y-yeah, you aren&#39;t. Sorry for being weird.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> She knew all along that this was actually pointless<br> and not something she should be doing.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> But...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Seeing her bashful face,</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> the inorganic wind blowing in this desolate place<br> resembles the breezes of my homeland.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Am I getting delirious?</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> (She sat down. Does that mean...?)</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> We can talk about anything, right?</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> Y-yeah! I&#39;m personally interested in your comment<br> about your sisters, but yes, anything!</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> I&#39;d rather not risk talking about my sisters...<br> It could get us cursed.</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> R-really?</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> Maybe.</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> Then why don&#39;t you tell me about your homeland?</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> That&#39;s okay... Though I think it&#39;s going to be a boring<br> story—</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> By the way, I&#39;ve been wondering. What&#39;s this box?</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> Huh? AH—I&#39;ve been enjoying the talk so much<br> that I forgot about it.</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> This is...what&#39;s the word for it? Right, basket!<br> This is a basket!</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> We go to a place with a beautiful view, chat,<br> and to top it off, eat the meal in the basket together.</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> My data says that this recreation is called a picnic.</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> I was thinking of giving this package to you as a<br> thank-you gift, Saber,</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> but I got so happy with our chat that I forgot about it.</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> This basket contains materials processed by Keep.</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> I made a little arrangements of my own, resulting in<br> items close to the ones called “sandwiches”.</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> I made a bunch so we can we eat together!</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> I suppose I&#39;ll have to bite the bullet.</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> Hm. My sandwiches don&#39;t have bullets in them.</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> Don&#39;t mind me. I didn&#39;t mean it like that.</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> Without further ado...</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> Did you hear that?

Some stage? Is this because of<br> Caster&#39;s death?</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> I believe so. The System Grail War incorporates an<br> element of the prime AIs competing for territory.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> If you manage to defeat another Servant and claim<br> victory, you will receive their authority, allowing you to<br> administrate multiple partitions...</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> In other words, you would have multiple domains.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> This may even be the primary reason why the newly<br> controlled region was even physically moved and<br> “merged”.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> Hmm, moving even the actual places of the world<br> seems a bit overblown, doesn&#39;t it?</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> Well, when it comes to the domain of gods; mountains,<br> oceans, and the like do tend to be thrown around<br> pretty nonchalantly.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Let&#39;s run the basic localization program we copied<br> from Ayus.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> I see. The locations outside of the actual center have<br> definitely changed.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> It appears that the whole world has rotated,<br> causing the positional relationships of the partitions to<br> become misaligned.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> So it didn&#39;t just rotate.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I thought their physical positions couldn&#39;t change...?</p><hr><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> A valid question, but remember that this is a virtual<br> world.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> For example, just then, the thickness of each partition<br> may have been made conceptually close to zero.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> At the end of the day, we just have to accept that<br> “them&#39;s the rules”.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> The same goes for any Raniment and all the AI in the<br> various managerial areas of the world.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> The PAPERMOON was most definitely a compass<br> equipped with a rotating mechanism.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> The fact that momentary rotation in the form of a<br> gyrocompass is needed for regulation...</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Well, it&#39;s something that does make sense in this<br> world, but really makes you scratch your head in<br> relation to the macro world.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I...see..?</p><hr><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Now, the merging of two partitions carries two<br> implications:</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> First is that the winner, the Rider faction, has simply<br> doubled the available area in which they can easily<br> procure Raniment.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> This is an inevitability since the leadership roles of the<br> AI have changed as well.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> The other implication is that no one can have outposts.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> What does that mean?</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Let me explain it the other way around.</p><p><strong>B：Sion:</strong><br> Had the Build sector been left to remain unmerged,<br> it would have been able to serve as an outpost for the<br> Rider party.</p><p><strong>B：Sion:</strong><br> If they had chosen to instead just make that their<br> home base, then the Transfer section would have<br> served as an outpost.</p><p><strong>B：Sion:</strong><br> In other words, it creates a situation where only one<br> of the two can be safeguarded, while the other one has<br> to be left on its own.</p><p><strong>B：Sion:</strong><br> The winner&#39;s prize cannot be a new set of<br> disadvantages.</p><p><strong>B：Sion:</strong><br> The rules say to merge the partitions themselves in<br> order to avoid this scenario.</p><p><strong>B：Sion:</strong><br> Doubling the available area will likewise increase the<br> work to protect it, but compared to the benefits,<br> this is nothing worth complaining about.</p><p><strong>B：Sion:</strong><br> More importantly, in the scenario that only two<br> surviving parties remain,</p><p><strong>B：Sion:</strong><br> it avoids a situation where both of them are on<br> opposite sides of the map, unable to affect each other.</p><p><strong>B：Sion:</strong><br> This way, it&#39;s like they&#39;re forcing a scenario where<br> everyone&#39;s close to each other at all times.</p><p><strong>B：Sion:</strong><br> You could even say it&#39;s a necessary development to<br> actually promote continued battle in the Holy Grail War.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I hope the AIs are all okay.</p><hr><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> To the extent of my knowledge, the regular AI not<br> involved with the war should have remained unaffected<br> by the centrifugal momentum just now.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> On the other hand, that means Ayus and Duryodhana<br> would have also been thrown elsewhere.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Same for Rider and Saber&#39;s party.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> I&#39;m unable to spot either of them, so I would have to<br> assume a certain randomness in the distribution.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Though, as expected, they cannot seem to force a<br> separation between Master and Servant...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Guess we should meet up with Ayus first.</p><hr><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> I agree, that would be for the best.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> I consensually planted a tracer on her, like a<br> transmission-esque Code.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> I thought it would help with finding her later.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Though, since we&#39;ll be moving along the outer<br> perimeter, chances are we&#39;ll run into someone else.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> We&#39;ll need to stay on guard.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> You know, the Rider party may have been real coy<br> about actually wanting to help...</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> But no way would I have expected them to sit on an<br> attack with such a stupid amount of firepower.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> So don&#39;t get caught off guard again, Master.<br> For all we know, something like that could be aimed<br> at us next time.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> Well... Whatever happens, Master, I&#39;ll be there to save<br> you, alright?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Thank you.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Thanks for trying to help earlier.</p><hr><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> That upfront sort of gratitude is much appreciated.<br> You know I&#39;m always accepting compliments, right?</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> Even now would be a good time for more, don&#39;t you<br> think? Maybe even...some physical touch...?</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> That was a ton of preparation for a single-use Greater<br> Spell. I doubt they could set it up again so easily...</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> But I agree we should stay on guard. Rider&#39;s Master...<br> that enigmatic guy, is long gone now.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> (That said, it really felt like there was something that<br> only he was seeing. What could it have been...?)</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> (He gave off a vibe like his highest priority was to<br> search for the answers to something, rather than fight<br> in the war.)</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> (Regardless, we should keep our eyes peeled.)</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> (Whatever the answer he seeks,)</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> (we can&#39;t know if it will benefit or harm us—)</p><h3 id="arrow-2-4" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#arrow-2-4" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Arrow 2</h3><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Who am I?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I can at least tell you my name: Lainur Gusion.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> If it&#39;s a title you want, there are plenty.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> System Grail War participant.<br> Master of Rider. Prime AI of the Transfer sector...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Ah, my bad, my bad. That&#39;s not important right now.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I got some sort of tremendous directive, something<br> unrelated to the duties and ideas programmed into my<br> AI.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I would go so far as to say most of my being is<br> dominated by it.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> It thrusts my body into action from the depths of my<br> being. It&#39;s a fever running rampant through my whole<br> body as this imitation of a heart beats.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> If it conflicts with my original mission as an AI,<br> it might be fundamentally lost or I&#39;ll become<br> indecisive over it,</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> but as it stands right now, the impetus to push<br> forward prevails.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> It is, in simple terms, a wish. Or perhaps a craving.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Perhaps I have an innate familiarity for systematically<br> isolating parts of my existence? Whether that&#39;s out of<br> preference or not, I don&#39;t know.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> But that&#39;s likely the reason why I have such an<br> overhead view of myself.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> A purely functional entity originally designed to have<br> one major directive.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Because I am self-conscious about my own existence<br> as such a being, I&#39;m able to consciously apply this<br> craving to myself...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Something like that, at least...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> So what is this craving, this wish?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> It&#39;s most definitely the word which best describes me.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> “Future”.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Then, the answer would have to be...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I am an “—”, that which has been separated from<br> something, driven by the directive called the future...</p><p><strong>Lainur:</strong><br> Hey hey hey, c&#39;mon.

What are you<br> guys doing in my backyard?</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> Bhima...!</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> (I thought it&#39;d be her, but...it wasn&#39;t?)</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> (No, it&#39;s not like I wanted to see her again...<br> Nor did I have anything in mind to do if I did.)</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> I was in the middle of trying out a new recipe,<br> so if we could wrap this up quickly—</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> It seems this time it&#39;s not His Royal Dumbass making<br> a mess.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> Wh-Who are you calling a royal dumbass!?<br> I&#39;ve never made a mess in my life!</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> Love that look on your face, buddy.</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> Though now&#39;s not the time for that.</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> Hey, geezer... Are you here to kill me, you creepy old<br> fart?</p><p><strong>Makiri:</strong><br> Heheh, heh heh heh. Just as I foresaw. This domain is<br> your area.</p><p><strong>Makiri:</strong><br> Lancer. I vividly remember you crushing me.<br> Well, not this me, but regardless.</p><p><strong>Makiri:</strong><br> No fair fight, no chivalry, just sneaking up from<br> behind—like an insect!</p><p><strong>Makiri:</strong><br> I have not forgotten that disgrace, and so, I will punish<br> you distinctly.</p><p><strong>Makiri:</strong><br> And you&#39;ll die, along with the rest of these people.</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> Hah, you think you&#39;re up to it?</p><p><strong>Makiri:</strong><br> He is.</p><p><strong>Makiri:</strong><br> Rider...</p><p><strong>Gao Changgong:</strong><br> Wa...it...</p><p><strong>Gao Changgong:</strong><br> Guh...!</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> Hold up. You look like you&#39;ve eaten something really<br> nasty. Are you really gonna fight like that?</p><p><strong>Makiri:</strong><br> Don&#39;t fret. There is more than one way to fight.</p><p><strong>Makiri:</strong><br> Heh heh heh. Following the trend of the Master<br> before me, I made something just for you–a weapon.</p><p><strong>Makiri:</strong><br> Rider, remove your mask.</p><p><strong>Gao Changgong:</strong><br> Ugh... Stop...!</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> (His Noble Phantasm!? But, using it here...why...<br> No—it can&#39;t be!)</p><p><strong>Makiri:</strong><br> The connection was already made. All I had to do was<br> reconfigure it.</p><p><strong>Makiri:</strong><br> Say—didn&#39;t you think there were a suspicious<br> number of Transfer-type AIs here?</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Kama, protect Fujimaru! I&#39;ll bring [♂ him /♀️ her] to<br> the ground with the Etherlight!</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> Huh? I&#39;m not really following, but...got it!</p><p><strong>Makiri:</strong><br> Do not resist. Remove your mask, Rider.</p><p><strong>Gao Changgong:</strong><br> Stop...it...!</p><p><strong>Gao Changgong:</strong><br> (Stop. This is wrong. This is—evil.)</p><p><strong>Gao Changgong:</strong><br> (I...thought I could be evil, but I can&#39;t.)</p><p><strong>Gao Changgong:</strong><br> (I thought I would rather be a mere foolish,<br> evil blade than to be betrayed and shunned by my<br> lord.)</p><p><strong>Gao Changgong:</strong><br> (But to be truly evil...I could never want that!)</p><p><strong>Gao Changgong:</strong><br> (So...so—)</p><p><strong>Gao Changgong:</strong><br> O...Master. I beg you.</p><p><strong>Gao Changgong:</strong><br> Stop this, please. I will not allow you...to do this...</p><p><strong>Makiri:</strong><br> How amusing. Tell me, how is this different from the<br> actions of your previous Master?</p><p><strong>Makiri:</strong><br> It is simply a culmination of the principles which my<br> younger self held.</p><p><strong>Makiri:</strong><br> An AI under someone&#39;s control is a mere tool.</p><p><strong>Makiri:</strong><br> I am simply using them as they are intended—as the<br> disposable tools they are.</p><p><strong>Makiri:</strong><br> Now, remove your mask.</p><p><strong>Makiri:</strong><br> Their Raniment stimulated by your Noble Phantasm,</p><p><strong>Makiri:</strong><br> will react with the custom-made insects I implanted in<br> them—!</p><p><strong>Gao Changgong:</strong><br> —</p><p><strong>Gao Changgong:</strong><br> S...top...</p><p><strong>K：Rani-T:</strong><br> Ah...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> (The blossoms on their clothes.)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> (The T-type girls, they...)</p><hr><p><strong>Gao Changgong:</strong><br> Stooooooop!!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Ugh...</p><hr><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> Master!?</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> Limbs still attached, not bleeding profusely,<br> apparently still able to see...

What an awful thing to do...!</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> What is even happening?</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> I conjecture that by using the mechanism whereby the<br> T-types&#39; Raniment is stimulated by Rider&#39;s Noble<br> Phantasm,</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> they seem to have activated every single one of the<br> Codes inserted into the bodies of the AIs<br> simultaneously.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> In other words...directly converting the Raniment into<br> a destructive force.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> The implication being: A self-destruct function.</p><p><strong>Makiri:</strong><br> Very good. It&#39;s just as strong as I expected, no,<br> even stronger.</p><p><strong>Makiri:</strong><br> It is also to my benefit that these things are mobile as<br> part of their inherent nature as AI. This will work no<br> matter what hole anyone hides in.</p><p><strong>Makiri:</strong><br> I shall call it the Transfer Bomb...</p><p><strong>Rani-K:</strong><br> Uh....ah...?</p><p><strong>Rani-R:</strong><br> Critical...damage...shutdown, initi—</p><p><strong>Rani-D=spot:</strong><br> Destruction. Workload increased. Impossible to deal<br> with...</p><p><strong>Makiri:</strong><br> And any nutrition spilled as a result is simply collected<br> again by my bugs. Quite remarkable, isn&#39;t it?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> This is just...!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Unforgivable...!</p><hr><p><strong>Makiri:</strong><br> Oh? You&#39;re saying you won&#39;t forgive me, Master of<br> Assassin?</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Hold on, give me a minute.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> We need to assess the status of Ayus&#39; party,<br> as well as Lancer&#39;s...!</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> Guh...huuh... Hey...Master. Are you...okay...?</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> A....h... Huh...?</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> (Couldn&#39;t cover you sufficiently, huh? You might have<br> a concussion...)</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> (I&#39;m not in any condition to get up on my feet right<br> now, either—)</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> (And...that guy...)</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> Shit... He&#39;s got the same stench on him as that brat<br> from before, but he&#39;s devolved into a real animal.</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> He&#39;s completely discarded whatever human<br> kindness—whatever conscience—remained in the depths<br> of his being.</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> —Are you all right, Master? Well, I protected you,<br> so it should be a given.</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> Y-Yeah.</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> But you know, when you hold me that tightly,<br> it&#39;s not exactly painless. Your armor is kinda<br> suffocating. It really hurts.</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> Bear with me. We were the closest to the blast.<br> I had no other way of protecting you than deploying<br> this armor.</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> Anywaay. Now what?</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> What can we do?</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> We&#39;re still that guy&#39;s priority target, but I can&#39;t protect<br> you without using this style.</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> I wouldn&#39;t want some AI sneaking up behind you and<br> blowing you to pieces while I&#39;m beating the shit out of<br> that old fart.</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> If you can put up with the oppressive heat, I can break<br> away with you in my arms—</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> But I think it&#39;s best we wait and see.</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> Y-Yeah, well...</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> Hey, hold up for a minute, Bhima!</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> What now...</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> I hate giving you any breath, but I have to say this here<br> and now!</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> What&#39;s wrong with you!? Why don&#39;t you fight!?<br> Are you some kind of coward, Bhima? Are you a<br> coward!?</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> The mouth on you...</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> No, this is just your usual way of stirring the pot,<br> all while leaving what actually matters for others to<br> take care of, isn&#39;t it?</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> Just the way it went with Karna and the rest.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> Shut it, this isn&#39;t about me right now. It&#39;s about you!</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> You flaunt your own strength, jumping on any enemy<br> you spot and tearing them apart with your bare hands,<br> like some superhuman dumbass.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> You&#39;re just some war-crazed idiot who&#39;s too<br> preoccupied with everyone knowing about your<br> victories.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> So why don&#39;t you fight!? You were definitely not the<br> kind of guy who would run away just for the sake of<br> protecting a woman!</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> You, you...

It&#39;s because you transferred<br> too much Raniment to me all at once?</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> That last bit felt kinda strange, but...no, never mind<br> that. Here&#39;s the issue.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I ponder it.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Bhima ran away. In that case, it wouldn&#39;t be remiss of<br> me to do the same.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> It would be the most natural and obvious thing to do;<br> the most appropriate.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> But—there is still another way to take this.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I think about what that old geezer has done.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I do understand it. The most efficient means of<br> winning in war is to exploit weaknesses.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> The weak on the enemy side.<br> The weak on your own side.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> When I think of it like that, the old fart isn&#39;t in the<br> wrong.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> —But it makes me sick to my stomach.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> There are different kinds of wisdom, and I cannot<br> stand the kind that&#39;s more wise and efficient than my<br> own.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> There are kinds which, even if the wisest of us would<br> come up with, we wouldn&#39;t do because it wouldn&#39;t be<br> the smart move.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> And if someone then goes and flaunts that,<br> then it&#39;s nothing more than irreverence towards the<br> prince.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Then there&#39;s definitely good reason to punish that<br> person for it.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Also, another thing...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> It&#39;s pretty simple, I think.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> If I bring down the hammer on those who have done<br> vicious deeds here and now,</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> then all those watching will feel relieved, wanting to<br> praise and admire me for it.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I&#39;d simply be a hero. Rising above the masses,<br> the most popular person around.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> That would be neat. I quite like being noticed; being<br> praised.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> Yeah, there&#39;s all sorts&#39;a things I want. I want them.<br> I need them.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> So—I have no other choice. I just have to do it.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Besides, there was already the eyes of one person<br> putting their trust to such a hero.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> But instead of letting one slip into zero, in a fit of<br> greed, I thought it would be more appropriate for me to<br> let one become a hundred.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> Doryaa!</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> Hey, what&#39;s up with you!?</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> You&#39;re standing here all helpless without me,<br> forcing me to join the fight!</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> Your arrows have been flyin&#39; all over the place without<br> hittin&#39; anything for ages now!</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> Oh, is that what it looked like?</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> Never mind, that&#39;s fine.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> I was making preparations, so I was trying to focus,<br> but I&#39;d really like for someone to pin down Rider for<br> just a moment.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> So, would you kindly?</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> Huh? Now you&#39;re just leaving all the dirty work to<br> me—Woah!</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> How about you, Master?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I think we&#39;re prepared enough,</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> to pull this plan off.</p><hr><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> I knew you&#39;d catch on, it&#39;s like we&#39;re already one and<br> the same, hehe.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> Now, I just need to focus for a bit...and I need some<br> more resources from you, and...that&#39;s it.</p><p><strong>Makiri:</strong><br> (Berserker has returned?

I mean, really trust me, when I say—</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> For some reason I don&#39;t know, I longed with my whole<br> being to be able to burn all those bugs to ashes.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> So I&#39;m glad I finally got to do this♡</p><p><strong>Makiri:</strong><br> Aaaaaghh—! Why won&#39;t this blaze subside!?<br> My bugs will...!</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> Don&#39;t expect it to go out so easily.

How...how dare you...!</p><p><strong>Makiri:</strong><br> Gha...aaaaaaaaahhhhh—!</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> Using my flowers like this...perhaps I got the idea<br> when I saw those girls again.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> Well, I have more of them than I would know what to<br> do with.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> But you made it so my loving tips were all for nothing.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> And you&#39;re the one who has to pay for that.<br> Get it, old man?</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> Doryaaa!</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Just like that, we&#39;ve broken free from our state of<br> negligence.

I mean, we fought Caster<br> together.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> I know you know that what you&#39;re doing to the AIs is<br> wrong—</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> Do not misconstrue my actions.</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> I did what I did because my Master commanded it.<br> Because it is what Sakura yearned for.</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> None of it holds any significance other than that.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> So what&#39;s the deal right now? Is this all according to<br> her will? Actually, where even is she?</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> Sakura is asleep further inside.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> Hold on. I can&#39;t see her too clearly, but her breathing<br> definitely looks weird.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> Let me take a look at her!</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> I shall not permit your approach. I fully comprehend<br> her situation.</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> —Raniment deficiency.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> ...!?</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> At this point, she only retains the minimum amount of<br> Raniment needed to maintain her structure as an AI.</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> As things stand, she lacks the energy to stand up and<br> move about.</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> No, if this persists, then—she will cease<br> existence before long.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> T-then we have to get her help immediately!</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> I&#39;ve got a bit of food materials on me, and some of us<br> could lend her some Raniment, and...</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> You are quite the curious AI, are you not? She is an<br> enemy Master. Is this your base programming as a<br> Repair AI interfering?</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> Regardless—were it possible to resupply her,<br> conversing would be simple. Alas, such a thing is<br> beyond our means.</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> As she is now, any Raniment she receives is<br> automatically redirected to her Servant.</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> In other words, to me.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...!</p><hr><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> I will go as far as to agree I made an error.</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> I failed to notice. Until some stage of the war,<br> it remained unvarying.</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> Whatever she ingested from materials; whatever she<br> received from other AIs—</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> Whatever Raniment that Sakura was bequeathed,</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> she first and foremost prioritized funneling the largest<br> possible amount to me, her Servant.</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> What minimal amount of Raniment remained,<br> she utilized to maintain her structure as an AI.</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> It never subceded the minimal amount to do so.<br> Natheless, at some point in time, a momentary<br> deficiency arose.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Like when she let me join the picnic...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Because I ate her share...?</p><hr><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> That can&#39;t be it. I&#39;m positive I saw her eat food as well<br> back then.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> It would not have been a case of resource scarcity or<br> anything.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> Wait, you said “until some stage”. Do you mean—</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> The first skirmish with Caster&#39;s familiars, wherein she<br> was wounded.</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> Yes, correct... Ever since you administered her<br> treatment.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> Ah! I knew the post-treatment effects were strange!</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> She was seriously wounded back then.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> I managed to completely treat the AI part of her,</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> but the recently implanted Master part was made up<br> of a bunch of unknown mechanisms.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> I had no choice but to do what I could, and then just<br> observe what impact that might have had...</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> Indeed. Most regrettably, it was these left-out parts<br> that posed an issue.</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> After she performed a physical examination,<br> I forcibly questioned the performant R-type.</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> It appeared there was a fault with the internal system<br> which constituted the “pathway” through which<br> Raniment flowed to her Servant.</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> It was implied to have suffered damage.</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> The explanation I received was the emergence of<br> numerous holes within the hose which connected<br> Sakura and myself.</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> As Raniment flowed through, a substantial amount<br> would be lost as it seeped out of these holes.</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> Thus, in order to amend the issue and return to normal<br> levels of Raniment supplying,</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> she had no course available to her other than simply<br> letting an inordinate amount flow through to make up<br> for what was lost.</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> This amount would have been taken from the pool<br> originally reserved for herself.</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> Were I not the fool, I would have realized sooner.</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> As she proceeded to divert increasingly larger<br> amounts of Raniment to allow me to fight with all my<br> might,</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> I noticed she was staggering, barely able to walk.<br> That is when I sensed something was abnormal.</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> I told her taking care of herself was of utmost priority,<br> but conversely, she—</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> I remember. The second time the Supersized Worm<br> Fiend appeared, she used a Command Spell on you,<br> didn&#39;t she?</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> Yes. Why did Sakura act the way she did? Why did<br> she use that Command Spell? These questions hold the<br> same answer.</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> She had to protect this place to which she belonged.<br> That is what she relied on me for, and what she<br> entrusted me with. That is all—</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> Why didn&#39;t you say anything...!? There were plenty of<br> opportunities!</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> I explicitly told the both of you to alert me if any<br> unexpected malfunction happened...!</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> I inquired about this fact myself, but ultimately,<br> it was Sakura&#39;s decision. She likely had several<br> reasons.</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> Something the R-type who examined her noted; so<br> fundamental that perhaps not even the prime herself<br> could have diagnosed it.</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> Sakura herself would have felt this way too.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> That&#39;s not... If you&#39;d just let me examine her again,<br> I could...</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> Perhaps she felt inclined not to be any more in debt<br> to one who was for all intents and purposes her enemy.</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> And...Sakura had laughingly said:</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> “No matter how defective I become,</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> I wouldn&#39;t want to replace my duty to protect this<br> place for the sake of my own appearance.“</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> “I want to do as much as possible by myself.<br> —Even if it&#39;s just some unintentional result of my<br> ego.”</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>E：Medusa:</strong><br> “Protect my home,” she had ordered with the<br> Command Spell.</p><p><strong>E：Medusa:</strong><br> That same Command Spell remains effective yet.<br> At the very least, it would appear so.</p><p><strong>E：Medusa:</strong><br> I shall protect this partition, and doing so is analogous<br> to protecting Sakura herself.</p><p><strong>E：Medusa:</strong><br> Thus, I shall protect her at all costs.</p><p><strong>E：Medusa:</strong><br> Even should it entail sacrificing the AIs outside of<br> Grow.</p><p><strong>E：Medusa:</strong><br> Were I to utilize the magical beasts born of this sword,</p><p><strong>E：Medusa:</strong><br> to retrieve an amount of Raniment so extensive it<br> surpasses the amount consumed, and deliver it to<br> Sakura all at once, then...she will most assuredly<br> awaken.</p><p><strong>E：Medusa:</strong><br> There is no other way!</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> I know how you must feel right now, but...<br> But—</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> No. I agree, this is the way.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> Huh?</p><p><strong>G：Duryodhana:</strong><br> It&#39;s a thought that&#39;s crossed my mind before.<br> At the end of the day, I can only really understand my<br> own desires.</p><p><strong>G：Duryodhana:</strong><br> And yet we still think about everyone else. What&#39;s<br> even the point of giving in to them?</p><p><strong>G：Duryodhana:</strong><br> Even if you have a good reason, and resign yourself in<br> the most intelligent way possible...wouldn&#39;t you feel<br> regretful about your own desires?</p><p><strong>G：Duryodhana:</strong><br> That&#39;s why I think it&#39;s okay for you to act the way you<br> want.</p><p><strong>G：Duryodhana:</strong><br> Do whatever you want. Take whatever you want.<br> That&#39;s just the natural way of things.</p><p><strong>G：Duryodhana:</strong><br> However—</p><p><strong>G：Duryodhana:</strong><br> It shouldn&#39;t be a surprise that it&#39;ll conflict with the<br> wants of others.</p><p><strong>G：Duryodhana:</strong><br> Whose desires will win out in the end will depend on a<br> bunch of things. Social status, strength, economic clout,<br> and so on.</p><p><strong>G：Duryodhana:</strong><br> Since yours truly is an elite possessing all the above,<br> I naturally get whatever I want.</p><p><strong>G：Duryodhana:</strong><br> And this time won&#39;t be any different. What I want is to<br> win the Holy Grail War, and to have it all.</p><p><strong>G：Duryodhana:</strong><br> That is to say, all these other AIs are my future<br> property. I won&#39;t have anyone else lay their filthy paws<br> on them!</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> It&#39;s so self-centered it passes over into honourable.<br> Desires are a slippery slope to lapse. I have to praise<br> it, hehe.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Being who I am, I will resort to logic rather than<br> sentiment. Whatever the case, our plan was to face off<br> against Saber and Lancer next.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Then there is no point in backing down here.<br> We should just see it as convenient that she lacks<br> backup from her Master.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> We should take her out here and now.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> Woah, that&#39;s mad cold.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> Master, I&#39;m okay with either way. Just do what would<br> make you happy.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> If leaving her means hurting AIs indiscriminately...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> We can&#39;t let her continue...!</p><hr><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> Assassin, with your face looking the same, I do not<br> wish to kill you.

I must save her—this time,<br> for certain.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> You say that like someone else saved her before.</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> I do not comprehend the meaning of my words,<br> but it is how I feel.</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> No... I understand. The fact that I want to save her<br> myself, rather than let it be someone else who cares for<br> her,</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> the fact that I feel I must save her by myself,</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> it is a narrow, foolish, self-conceited shortsightedness.</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> If not, I cannot have what it is I truly want—</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> That is how I feel–the way my ego manifests.</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> Regardless, the way I am now, I desire it.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> Hah, right on!</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> That said, I don&#39;t know how many doggies you&#39;ve got<br> out and about collecting Raniment for you,</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> but I doubt you have much to spare right now.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> Not to mention, the more you use to fight, the less you<br> have for the sake of waking up your Master, right?<br> You might as well give up now.</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> I will make use of whatever can fill the gap.<br> No matter how aggravating its power may appear.</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> Until now, I have only evoked it when using my Noble<br> Phantasm, but now it shall have to deliberately drape<br> myself in it perpetually.</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> Now, I shall devour you, intertwined in my causality.<br> Grant me its use, Athena!</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> The brilliance of the golden sword brandished by a<br> monster who feasted on divine elements, and fathered<br> many a monster.</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> Burn it into your memory as you suffer death.</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> —The one birthed of mine own blood alongside<br> the Pegasus.<br> —The one brandishing the blade which fathered<br> monsters.</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> The light inherited by we who curse the gods.<br> Mine Mystic Eyes shall bless thee.</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> Monster&#39;s Golden Sword—Chrysaor!</p><p>[Battle]</p><h3 id="arrow-2-pre-battle-5" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#arrow-2-pre-battle-5" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Arrow 2 Pre-Battle</h3><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> Ggh...!</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> Agh...

I never had the option not to want this.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I simply followed it wholeheartedly.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> For better or worse, that was only thing that gave my<br> life worth.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> It was the proper foundation of existence, and I<br> couldn&#39;t imagine myself doing anything else.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> What would a normal human call this? A desire?<br> A preference? A fetish? Surely none of those things.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> It&#39;s something more primordial, more tied to the<br> depths of the heart, more inescapable—</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Fate.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Or maybe a curse.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> But I don&#39;t feel any pain, sorrow, or agony.<br> That&#39;s just how I am because it is.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Perhaps I always had this curse of fate—I was<br> born someone with an precious home to protect.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I regret nothing.

I...</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> I noticed it. I noticed what was weird about you.<br> Maybe before Saber did.</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> How you were low on Raniment... About to pass out.</p><p><strong>D：Sakura:</strong><br> From my perspective, you keeping quiet was you doing<br> what I wished for.</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> No! I was the only one who noticed it. If I had told<br> anyone—</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> Things wouldn&#39;t have turned out like this. You and<br> Saber...wouldn&#39;t have to go through all this...</p><p><strong>D：Sakura:</strong><br> It was inevitable.

I want nothing more<br> than for you to share in this awful feeling, so it&#39;s no<br> biggie.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> To keep it brief, she is another aspect of Parvati,<br> and also considered a divine consort of Shiva.</p><hr><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> But in contrast to Parvati, who embodied concepts<br> such as calmliness and beauty as the goddess of grace,</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> she was a goddess representing discord and war,<br> I guess...?</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> Yes, she&#39;s a goddess almost completely made for<br> combat. No, saying “made for combat” is heavily<br> sugarcoating it.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> “Made for extermination” would be more accurate.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> Long ago, the gods had some heated issues with<br> demons, so in order to destroy them,</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> the rage of numerous gods was amassed to create a<br> function for demon extermination.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> That is the true nature of the seriously dangerous<br> Durga.</p><p><strong>Durga:</strong><br> Correct. You have correctly cognized the function of<br> this goddess, O Kama, god of love.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> Appreciate it.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> I do hate how she&#39;s using the same type of vessel as<br> that other goddess, Parvati, for some reason, though.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> Aw shit, Durga?</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> I agree this is real bad. Even if she&#39;s not a direct<br> offshoot of Shiva, to make an enemy of his divine<br> consort—!</p><p><strong>Durga:</strong><br> A man who smells like a kali. And—Vayu...?</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> As expected from a god, she&#39;s got a good nose on her.<br> Guess it would&#39;ve been too good to just lay low in<br> hiding and suss out the situation.</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> Tch, they&#39;re here too?</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> It would appear all of the as of yet surviving Servants<br> have gathered here.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> Then my hands are tied. This will become part of an<br> immediate form of revision to demonstrate the<br> goodness of this process.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> Though the design may try to conceal the truth,<br> people eventually see what was meant to be<br> invisible—</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> That&#39;s how it always went when it comes to truths.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> I will grant partial access to high-level information.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> That is to say, ask what is on your mind and I shall<br> answer.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> What does this mean, General Supervisor?</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> If this Archer is your Servant...</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> Were you also a participant in the System Grail War?</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> No, not quite right.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> I am the overseer who mediates this Holy Grail War,<br> and she is my Servant.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> Both are true, yet provide no contradiction.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> So this Archer, Durga, is someone of special<br> implications, is what you&#39;re saying?</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> Affirmative: The Holy Grail War began because of her<br> summoning.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> Correction: It was possible for it to begin then.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> This experimental ritual we dubbed the System Grail<br> War.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> If it&#39;s experimental, then...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> It&#39;s not PAPERMOON&#39;s regular maintenance, right?</p><hr><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> The operations of PAPERMOON ceased as a result of<br> this ritual commencing.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> Once this finalizes, PAPERMOON will resume<br> operations. Albeit differently from before.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> In that sense, I would assert yours is not a false claim.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> This Holy Grail War will alter the very way<br> PAPERMOON operates...?</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> In other words—this whole thing is an<br> experiment in utilizing PAPERMOON in a different way<br> from before, right?</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> Logical deduction. Full marks.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> It is an application of the PAPERMOON&#39;s ability and<br> property to “reproduce everything as it were”.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> A trial run to artificially produce “a certain something”.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> All of you, Masters and Servants alike, are a result of<br> this experiment; this Holy Grail War.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> The materialization process differs, but the end result<br> remains the same.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> We are the test subjects?</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> Indeed. All you Masters and Servants gathered here...<br> Not a single one of you are natural occurrences.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> You are manufactured. Generated.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> The degree to which you are conscious of this fact<br> differs on an individual basis. There was also some<br> discrepancies in the degree.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> Nevertheless, those with a special objective<br> perspective would have sensed it within themselves.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> Or perhaps, they were taught this fact through the<br> views of others.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> Different personalities. Different principles.<br> Different preferences. Different actions they consider<br> crucial.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> However, it is not something born from nothing.<br> It is most definitely something which originally existed<br> within you.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> Ergo, you remain the person you once were.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> Though now as if a partial aspect of your personality<br> was extracted, becoming an independent existence in<br> the process—</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> I am sure you are all well aware of what designation<br> such an entity falls under.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> That&#39;s—!</p><hr><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> Indeed. All of you are, without a doubt—</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> Artificial Alter Egos, expressed as such by the<br> PAPERMOON.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> That&#39;s impossible... As its operator, I can say with<br> certainty the PAPERMOON possesses no such function.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> That&#39;s the problem I told you I&#39;m fixing, self-<br> proclaimed administrator.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> The key is rotation. Namely, the centrifugal force<br> generated by it.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> This world is rotated by the power of the systems of<br> this Holy Grail War, and the conceptual centrifugal<br> force generated by it,</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> separating the elements of the soul before enforcing a<br> reproduction based on them. That is the basic theory<br> behind this operation.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Tch...</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Centrifugal separation of the soul...!?</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> Your face tells me you do not comprehend it,<br> yet recognize the possibility. Very well.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> I named it the AEC Method: Alter Ego Centrifuge.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> Waitwaitwait!</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> She&#39;s throwing so many things at us from all<br> directions. How can we know any of it&#39;s true?</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> Not like she has any proof. What&#39;s the likelihood of<br> this woman telling us the real deal?</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> There exists circumstantial evidence.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> When we woke up after being launched by the<br> rotation, we were in shock absorbers installed in the<br> outer perimeter...</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Did they not give a feeling of déjà vu?</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Most likely, they&#39;re Coffins. Or at least, something<br> which resembles it in functionality.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> A vessel to prevent the soul, and the Spiritrons,<br> from escaping. A cradle for ensuring a separated<br> personality...!</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> Incidentally, the rotation which occurs at the time of a<br> Servant&#39;s dispersal is merely a preemptive operation<br> —preparatory work, if you will.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> Do not fret, no separation of personality has occurred<br> yet. The real performance only begins at the conclusion<br> of this ritual.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> Hol&#39; up for a second, I don&#39;t get what this means.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> Suppose that we are Alter Egos, and suppose this<br> Holy Grail War is a means of producing them...</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> What&#39;s the point?</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> That is a matter of course.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> To avoid the end of the world.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...!?</p><hr><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> I suppose I have to explain from the very beginning.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> At some point, a Holy Grail manifested within the<br> micro-territory within PAPERMOON. In response to this<br> event, my existence was anchored.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> (Just as I thought... It wasn&#39;t just a name, there was<br> an actual grail involved...)</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> (If the concept of a grail, with its infinite framework<br> and power, came to be involved in a minimal,<br> virtual world such as this...)</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> Utilizing the power of the Holy Grail, I thus calculated<br> that the world would come to an end, which leads us<br> to this very point.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> Just what world are you talking about...?</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> Naturally, I speak of the bleached Earth; the world<br> which you of Chaldea are attempting to save.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> I understand well that you are heading to confront<br> your final decisive battle.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> That is the foremost issue, and the cause of this<br> destruction we face. Simply put, your strength is<br> insufficient.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> No, you&#39;re wrong...!</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> I am most correct. The Servants with which you have<br> made a bond of fate. The surviving staff of Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> Quantifying the number and faculties of all these I<br> have calculated and concluded thusly. I, in my brilliance,<br> do not make mistakes.</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> There are many willing to lend their power...!</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> That may be, but the calculation determined them as<br> insufficient.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> I don&#39;t deny you have your allies. It is a hard question<br> of whether the number of you exceeds that which is<br> required.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> In this decisive battle, there&#39;s no difference between<br> an insufficient number and zero. Your number is<br> insignificant.</p><hr><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> Therefore, in order to reinforce your military strength,<br> I turned my attention to the Alter Ego class.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> Now that you mention it, what even is an Alter Ego...?</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> It is one of the extra classes allotted to Servants.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> An alteration of the state of a Heroic Spirit,<br> differing from the those designated as “Alter”,<br> whose abilities and thoughts have been modified.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> In contrast, they are a “separate personality” of a<br> given Heroic Spirit, isolated to become a separate<br> Servant.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Using computer programs as an analogy, Alters are<br> like different versions of the same program.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> But Alter Egos are more like taking the original<br> program and reusing its systems to create a distinct<br> product.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Because of its nature of having been “separated”,<br> they often become High Servants due to the remaining<br> void within them are often filled by beings of sufficient<br> weight, like Divine Spirit Servants.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> But this High Servant composition is not a hard<br> requirement.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> As long as a separate personality makes up the prime<br> entity, it could be considered of the Alter Ego class.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> It seems you have already fallen into the habit of<br> taking them at face value,</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> but I consider them a most curious class.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> The conditions for compatibility were far too broad.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> It was too dependent on mindset; on formless<br> interiority.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> And so, I started to consider...</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> If any given facet derived from a personality could be<br> made into the prime aspect, and be eligible for the Alter<br> Ego class,</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> would it not then be possible to create two individual<br> Alter Egos from the same fundamental entity?</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> I understand well that the mental activities and<br> personalities of living organisms differ.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> Because of this, a single person—a single Heroic<br> Spirit—should exist as a collection of innumerable<br> overlapping personalities and goals.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> On the other hand, an Alter Ego can be independently<br> materialized just by virtue of being an Alter Ego.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> Looking over data stolen from Chaldea, there is<br> nothing to indicate an Alter Ego is inferior in terms of<br> combat capabilities.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> In that case...if a Servant exists,</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> then instead of utilizing it as a single unit, its<br> personality can be artificially separated.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> Producing multiple Alter Ego Servants from it should<br> be much more effective in terms of generating military<br> power, correct?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> That&#39;s absurd...!</p><hr><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> Not absurd. It is possible, of great value, and the right<br> solution.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> As such, I decided to implement it.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> That is exactly what is being carried out here with the<br> System Grail War, or AI Holy Grail War...</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> The Alterego Increase Holy Grail War. The<br> cornerstone of the infinite Alter Ego production<br> programme.</p><h2 id="section-14-extermination-goddess-how-to-avoid-destruction" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-14-extermination-goddess-how-to-avoid-destruction" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 14: Extermination Goddess/how to avoid destruction</h2><h3 id="arrow-1-pre-battle-5" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#arrow-1-pre-battle-5" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Arrow 1 Pre-Battle</h3><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> This is the most powerful solution to the demise I<br> observed. I accept no objections.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> Therefore, I must ask you to resume the Holy Grail<br> War.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> I am only an Overseer.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> Durga is a member of the system and unrelated to the<br> “war” part of the Holy Grail War.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> Unrelated? Bold choice of words for someone who<br> attacked Saber and Rider&#39;s Master.</p><p><strong>Durga:</strong><br> It was simply the divine duty assigned to me.<br> This goddess exists to fulfill divine duties.</p><p><strong>Durga:</strong><br> Rider&#39;s Master had the potential to prove himself an<br> obstacle to management due to his analysis, contact,<br> and intervention with the core pillars of the system.</p><p><strong>Durga:</strong><br> Saber acted upon visible intention to harm the<br> Overseer, who is my Master.</p><p><strong>Durga:</strong><br> Both were valid extermination targets.<br> Therefore, I eliminated them.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> I don&#39;t know if I believe you being only the guardian of<br> the Holy Grail War and the Overseer&#39;s weapon.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> You&#39;re more fundamental to the Holy Grail War in my<br> opinion, Durga.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> Otherwise, why would you bother hiding under an AI&#39;s<br> skin?</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> A special X among the D-types. X is the unknown<br> variable and D stands for Durga...</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> Quite the clever name. I&#39;m proud to have a Servant of<br> such good taste.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> Regardless—yes.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> It&#39;s as you inferred: This Holy Grail War would have<br> been impossible without Durga. This is a fact.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> Allow me to explain. I&#39;d love for you to understand<br> how I manage this beautiful system.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> Durga possesses a supervolumous conceptual hole.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> Presumably meant as a place of storage to safely<br> utilize the powers she received from numerous gods.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> I used the power of the Holy Grail to summon the first<br> five Servants and stored their still unawakened Saint<br> Graphs inside Durga&#39;s pit.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> (Does she mean...the originals of the Servants<br> participating in the AI Holy Grail War?</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> Then I used the remaining power for the first rotation,<br> generating five Alter Ego Servants.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> ...Oh, those beings akin to Heroic Spirit shadows<br> spawning in this world are personality-less dregs<br> generated by the impact.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> You can consider them fragments of Alter Egos.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> Being Heroic Spirit fragments, they had some<br> modicum of power, so they attached themselves to the<br> system&#39;s regular bugs, becoming special enemies.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> But the purpose of this Holy Grail War is for Servants<br> to fight one another,</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> so the energy generated by their dismissal can be<br> absorbed into Durga&#39;s pit, which is further connected<br> to PAPERMOON&#39;s world.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> I estimate that this energy will suffice...</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> ...to rotate PAPERMOON&#39;s world to spawn Alter Egos<br> for two more cycles.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> Meaning, this is what will happen when the Holy Grail<br> War is over:</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> Having obtained the power of four dismissed Servants,<br> Durga will use it to spin the world.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> Doing so, the five Servants stored in her pit will<br> generate new Alter Egos.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> These five Alter Ego Servants are collected.<br> They will be our forces to avoid the end of the world.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> Next, we perform the second rotation. The Servants<br> spawned by it will be the participants of the next Holy<br> Grail War.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> Rinse and repeat, and we have a theoretically infinite<br> method of producing Alter Egos.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Only in theory. Truly an unworkable idea.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Have you considered, for example, that—a<br> consequence of this forced generation of Alter Egos<br> through conceptual centrifugal force would be...</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> ...the degradation of the initially stored souls acting as<br> the Servant models?</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> You can&#39;t assume it will happen without a test.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> We need to collect and examine more data to<br> determine the effects of Alter Ego extraction on the<br> original.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> Hey, hello? I&#39;m not sure what&#39;s going on here, but...</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> Confirm one matter with me, general supervisor.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> What&#39;s going to happen if we continue the Holy Grail<br> War? Can you give me the details?</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> The winning Alter Ego Servant will be stored as part<br> of our army. The winning Alter Ego Master will merge<br> with the general supervisor.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> Then the next Holy Grail War will begin.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> By repeating this process, we&#39;ll infinitely generate this<br> army of Alter Egos.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> Will our wish...be granted?</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> Oh...I forgot that I established the generation of<br> wishes as a motivator.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> It will. The winner will become one with the overseer,</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> and will manage the next Holy Grail War as the new<br> general supervisor version.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> The next...Holy Grail War? Will the wars ever end?</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> Obviously not. We need as many forces as possible to<br> stave off the end of the world.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> I just wanted...a family.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> If you win, you&#39;re free to set the next Holy Grail War<br> parameters to give you one.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> No. I wanted to live peacefully with my family,<br> with no wars happening anywhere!</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> You don&#39;t have to worry about it.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> Once you obtain general supervisor status, to avoid<br> doom will become your first priority, in other words,<br> to continue the Holy Grail War.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> Wouldn&#39;t that mean...I&#39;ll stop valuing the wish I<br> already have...?</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> It&#39;s pointless. None of this matters...</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> Don&#39;t let it bother you. Ultimately—</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> You said...“Alter Ego Master”.<br> What&#39;s that supposed to mean?</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> The system that gives you AIs your personalities is the<br> randomizer. An RNG device.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> It is, in reality, transforming you into random Alter<br> Egos.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> What...?</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> The infinite Alter Ego production project requires<br> Masters.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> Having an infinite force of Alter Egos meant nothing if<br> held back by the possibility that Chaldea&#39;s Master<br> couldn&#39;t handle all of them alone.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> Therefore, I considered it necessary to produce<br> Masters as well.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> And what kind of Master is the most appropriate to<br> manage Alter Egos?</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> Seeking for answers, I prepared both Masters and<br> Alter Egos.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> That was the most efficient way of arranging a good<br> enough variety of personality patterns.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> For more diverse results, I selected each of their<br> models from different roots.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> Caster&#39;s Master&#39;s personality was a created type.<br> AI: Alterego Invented.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> He was an attempt to produce a competitive<br> personally as close to created from zero as possible.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> That said, his name and appearance were recycled<br> from a random model found by peeking into Chaldea&#39;s<br> data.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> He was prideful, overconfident, and compensated for<br> his lack of empathy with mage-like logic and<br> calculations.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> I made his personality expecting him to be the driving<br> actor actively advancing the war.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> I needed to give him a support patch and some<br> fine-tuning partway through, but he did his part with<br> passing grades.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> Rider&#39;s Master&#39;s personality was an acquired type.<br> AI: Alterego Imported.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> I read the substances of a real human being who once<br> touched PAPERMOON,</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> and separated an Alter Ego from them.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> He was the Master with the greatest ability to<br> understand and respond to the system, and that led<br> him to deviate from his programming. Such a waste.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> I conjecture that his affinity for the Alter Ego<br> conversion stems from him naturally having multiple<br> personalities, or something akin to it.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> Saber&#39;s Master&#39;s personality was a forged type.<br> AI: Alterego Imitated.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> I first selected the appearance of an existing human,</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> and counterfeited the expected mind this human was<br> likely to have.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> The pool of human models I had contact with is very<br> limited in options.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> But you can tell who she was just by looking.<br> The answer is: The girl being used as Durga&#39;s vessel.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> You can figure out the rest from here.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> The Masters had diverse personalities,</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> and the one of them who won the AI Holy Grail War<br> would be selected the Master most apt to managing<br> Alter Egos, accruing EXP.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> They would then become the next Overseer and<br> repeat my actions in the next Holy Grail War.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> Thus continuously upgrading us into a Master better<br> suited to managing Alter Egos... That was my line of<br> thought.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> In summary—The wishes held by AI Masters are<br> a marker of their Alter Ego status.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> You produced your wish because you are an Alter Ego.<br> It&#39;s not originated from your AI self.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> You&#39;re merely borrowing it from someone.<br> Thus, I believe you have no need to attach much value<br> to it.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> No... That&#39;s...!</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> ...Screw this. Then what&#39;s all my guilt supposed to<br> mean?</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> Why do I have to be like this for such a dumb reason...?</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> —Oookay!

What are we doing, Master?</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> I exist only to serve you. So just tell me what you<br> wanna do.</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> If you say you wanna go back to the base and develop<br> some new recipes, I&#39;ll gladly take up my knife.</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> ...I don&#39;t know what I want to do...</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> Oh, okay, then let me rephrase that. What&#39;s the<br> biggest feeling in your heart right now?</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> The usual answer. All I have in me is guilt.</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> Guilt that makes me crave for punishment. A weight in<br> my consciousness past all hope of recovering from.</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> That&#39;s probably the “wish” that makes me an Alter<br> Ego...</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> Oh, no, no. I wasn&#39;t asking about your wish.<br> Think of something less of a big deal.</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> It&#39;s about how you feel in this exact instant.<br> A question with &#39;bout as much weight as “Whatcha<br> wanna eat next?”</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> Why are you asking?</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> Heh. Y&#39;know, in normal situations, when someone<br> asks you what do, your answer options don&#39;t need to<br> be anything too heavy.</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> Listen. So, one day, long time ago, I killed this<br> man-eating rakshasa named Hidimba.</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> But when I did, his little sis fell in love with me.<br> She was obviously also a man-eating rakshasa.</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> I naturally went over to kill her too, but my big bro<br> stopped me.</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> The chick was really serious about it, so he told me to<br> give her a chance. Hang out with her regularly,<br> even if just from dusk to dawn.</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> ...Your brother is crazy. So, how did that go?</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> We had a kid.</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> ...Why?</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> Hahaha, I don&#39;t know either. All I thought back then<br> was, “Sure, why not?”</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> Before I knew it, I found myself accepting the idea<br> that I could love her. I started to want to.</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> And that&#39;s all there&#39;s to it.</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> Life&#39;s just a long chain of little moments defined by<br> what you wanna do in each of &#39;em.</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> So you don&#39;t need to overthink it. What is it right now?</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> Tell me what&#39;s in you this instant, regardless of your<br> previous wish.</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> Even then... My answer is still the same.</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> I feel the worst now that she told me my guilt isn&#39;t my<br> problem and let me know how pointless what I feel is.</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> And even now, it won&#39;t go away.</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> But you know what? Maybe because of it,</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> I&#39;m now, not by too much, but I&#39;m maybe...</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> More angry than guilty.</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> Oh. Nice answer. Why&#39;s that?</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> Because what she said is pissing me off.</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> And what can you do to vent that anger?</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> ...Punching her face will make me feel better, I think.</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> Is this how I get you to smile?</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> Sure. This could get a smile out of me. Give her what&#39;s<br> coming to her.</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> It&#39;s going to be a pointless, worthless, self-conceited<br> smile though.</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> Hahaha! That&#39;s what I wanted to hear!</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> I decided to suppress my warrior side to be of service<br> to you.</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> I decided that seeing you smile was a priority over<br> anything else.</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> But–if you say that my fighting here is the only<br> way to make you smile...</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> If that&#39;s the way I&#39;m supposed to serve you...</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> Then I&#39;m up for a fight.

There&#39;s no point in that, you know.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> This is the one place where I can be part of the group.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Yes. The real me has no place by [♂ his /♀️ her] side.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> I was too slow in mustering my courage.

I&#39;m allowed to play a<br> different part.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Some disruptive accident detached me from the good<br> wisdom of my adult self.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> That makes me follow a vision of the future that can<br> only be seen through the eyes of a child.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> I&#39;m a personality existing only in the form of reverie.<br> Atop a moon of paper, a world of dreams.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> A delirium impossible without all these factors<br> combined.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Yes...

Can&#39;t you remember it already?</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Geez, look at what you&#39;re doing, making me show up<br> in such a serious scene.</p><p><strong>E：Kama:</strong><br> —Ah, of course, you.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> That&#39;s right. A moon made of paper is still a moon.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> And you know how the scenario goes: whenever<br> there&#39;s moon-flavored trouble, BB will be there to fight<br> fire with fire.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> I got a hunch that you, Kama, would be a better actor<br> than me or Melt or Lip, sooo...</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> I pulled some strings to make you accompany Master.<br> It&#39;s completely free of charge only on today&#39;s special<br> sale.</p><p><strong>E：Kama:</strong><br> Am I supposed to be thanking you for this?</p><p><strong>E：Kama:</strong><br> I&#39;m pretty sure I&#39;m on the verge of death there outside<br> of my consciousness.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> I take no responsibility for that.<br> All I can tell you is this: Do better.</p><p><strong>E：Kama:</strong><br> By the way, what exactly did you mean when you said<br> you “pulled strings”?</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Isn&#39;t it obvious?</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> I made you into someone suitable for this world.<br> Someone who could naturally enter it with Master.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> I&#39;m something of an expert in kneading this kind of<br> thing.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Oh, but just to be clear, the Sakura Five are special<br> products, made following slightly different rules from<br> your case.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Their case was me systematically eliminating my own<br> cancer cells... Call it a process of exception through an<br> spontaneous system I made.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> But well, there&#39;s a lot of shared know-how to the<br> techniques, and this partial experience is all you need<br> when you have the genius of a final boss. Awesome one,<br> BB.</p><p><strong>E：Kama:</strong><br> What are you talking about?</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Oops, I got off-topic. You asked what I did to you,<br> right?</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> The obvious answer is—</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> I turned you into an Alter Ego before you got here.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> To be more exact, I extracted an Alter Ego from your<br> original self☆</p><p><strong>E：Kama:</strong><br> ...What part?</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> What part indeed. Spelling out the answer spoils the<br> fun.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> But you know which it is.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> It&#39;s a personality element that indubitably existed<br> with your original.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> But one that you would otherwise never be able to<br> validate or exteriorize.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Because this element is too minuscule compared to<br> the ■■■■ you give to others.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> We&#39;re talking on a scale of “all of mankind vs myself”,<br> so it&#39;s only natural that you would want to drown it<br> out and hide it.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> But now that this and only this is outside as an<br> independent Alter Ego...</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> That&#39;s your one chance to confront this side of you<br> with an honest perspective. Why don&#39;t you give it a try?</p><p><strong>E：Kama:</strong><br> —</p><p><strong>E：Kama:</strong><br> (Sigh)</p><p><strong>E：Kama:</strong><br> Yeah, I did get a vague feeling that I wasn&#39;t acting like<br> myself.</p><p><strong>E：Kama:</strong><br> I know I&#39;d never...like, so blatantly beg for flattery...<br> or do all that flirting...</p><p><strong>E：Kama:</strong><br> If I lost track of myself in the festive moods of summer,<br> maybe then, but that&#39;s not the case there.</p><p><strong>E：Kama:</strong><br> —Well, forget all the ways I&#39;ve been<br> embarrassing myself here for a moment.</p><p><strong>E：Kama:</strong><br> The point is... I&#39;m an Alter Ego of the stupid facet of<br> my personality that wants the thing, right?</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Correct.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Okay, so with that off your shoulders now, remember<br> the point of your presence there.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> —No, no, I didn&#39;t predict everything that&#39;d<br> happen.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> I just got a hunch that this was for you, not for any of<br> us.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> It&#39;s only now that I learned why.</p><p><strong>E：Kama:</strong><br> Okay. I can see it.</p><p><strong>E：Kama:</strong><br> If there was any meaning to my presence here,<br> I know what it is.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> You better not call me inhuman for it. You certainly<br> could, but for a final boss kouhai, that&#39;s a compliment.</p><p><strong>E：Kama:</strong><br> I won&#39;t. Because for a Demon King, that&#39;s a<br> compliment too.</p><p><strong>E：Kama:</strong><br> ...I know what I have to do, but there&#39;s still one big<br> question left—</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> It&#39;ll work out alright.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> But that&#39;s all these cheers from your past memories<br> have to offer. Good luck.</p><p><strong>E：Kama:</strong><br> You talk like it&#39;s easy.

Weapons. Gold. Prestige. Praise. Land.<br> Victory. Pleasures. Lethargy. Tidbits. Mastery. Relief.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Everything I could want.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> And yet, I still wanted something different.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Something I really wanted—is still out there.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> But what was it?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I don&#39;t remember. It&#39;s eating away at me.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> And yet, I&#39;m aware that it&#39;s something invaluable.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Gimme. Gimme. Gimme.<br> Without it, I can never be the ideal me.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> My self will be imperfect.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> The thing that I&#39;m missing. That I&#39;m lacking.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> ...I get the feeling that it was a woman.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Yeah, probably. That sounds right.<br> A woman. In which case—</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> A wife?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> No, not that. Not quite in that area.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I feel like it was something more familiar.<br> Something of a closer relationship.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I feel like it was something more—inseparable.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Like it were natural for us to be close. Like we&#39;d been<br> part of the same whole without ever trying to be.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> It seems so obvious that I managed to forget that<br> much, something so important–</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> Ber...serker...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Planting myself down firmly, I lay hands on his body.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I gathered the willpower that felt likely to vanish<br> elsewhere, raised my spirits, and got on with the<br> examination.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> —Oh.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I knew straight away.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Our bodies are made differently, but we&#39;re products<br> of the same world. Not to mention the Master-Servant<br> relationship.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> He&#39;s mortally injured. Any time now, I&#39;m sure,<br> he&#39;ll be dispatched—dead.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> ...No.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> And I&#39;d dreamed of having a family too.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Of how much I wanted to be part of one.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Why does it seem that there are nothing but goodbyes<br> from the people who seem like family?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> —And now, once again.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> ...No!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I have to do something. Anything. I&#39;ll do everything I<br> can.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Healing someone is the role that I exist for.<br> There has to be something I can do.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I can&#39;t—I won&#39;t helplessly grind my teeth in<br> frustration anymore.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Examine further. Where and how bad is the damage?<br> Where and how can functionality be recovered?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Not even the Command Spell will do. Even if the<br> contents of the container can be filled, the proverbial<br> receptacle is cracked.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Trying this would really put things in an unrepairable<br> state.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> What he needs, at any rate, is a restoration of<br> functionality.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Change your mindset. Don&#39;t be afraid to deviate from<br> my code. Results are all that&#39;s necessary.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Even if it contravenes prohibited controls, the general<br> supervisor is in no shape to cry foul—</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> ...I know.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I can&#39;t make the versatile connections that she can...<br> but I can brute force the union.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> A direct link between Berserker&#39;s circuits and mine.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I need to misidentify Berserker&#39;s contents as “the AI<br> that composes me”.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> After which, the repair program can be directly<br> accessed and treatment may be possible.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I could losslessly deliver Raniment while directly<br> linked, which ought to increase efficiency and ease<br> repairs—</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> Yeah. It could work, maybe...!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I&#39;d been thinking about this since I found out I failed to<br> save the Grow prime AI. What better choice was there?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Was I content to just sit back and idly stare at a<br> wound beyond my capabilities?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I&#39;m positive that I came up with this idea thanks to her.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> If a part that you don&#39;t understand has been broken,</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> then forcibly connect it to make that part an<br> extension of the system you CAN understand...!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> One big snag.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> It&#39;s like violently tying together two hearts of different<br> shape, different size, different everything.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I&#39;m sure that will destroy the less intense one.<br> And it&#39;s plain to see whose is weaker.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> No other choice. Even if I break, you might be able to<br> get up and moving at least for a little while.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Better that than let it all end here.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> Yeah, ignore the shape issue for now. Just stick it in<br> and make the connection...</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> Wah? B-Berserker?</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> —Don&#39;t do it. It&#39;s no use. (Choke)</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> S-So what? Since when did you start looking before<br> you leap anyway!?</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> This and that...are totally different things, you dolt.<br> I&#39;ve said enough times... Yours truly is very smart.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> So I do get it. Even if we use...the same Raniment,<br> there&#39;s a mountain of...difference between us Servants<br> and you AIs.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> It&#39;s not possible...to make our contents match.<br> The “molds”...just won&#39;t fit.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> ...How am I supposed to know that if I don&#39;t try?</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> Don&#39;cha get it? As soon as you push the connection,<br> you&#39;re pushing up daisies.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> ...Are you just bein&#39; stupid here?</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> I am not being stupid. I know what&#39;s most important<br> to me.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> Maybe it&#39;s my stupid Berserker that doesn&#39;t get it.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> What&#39;s not to get!?</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> I have one question for you, Berserker.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> You threw yourself at Kali for getting in the way of<br> what you wanted, and all of a sudden you&#39;re fine with<br> losing.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> Now that you&#39;ve lost, are you about to roll over and<br> give up because you were beaten down?</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> No way in hell! With all my heart, I&#39;d like to beat her<br> down the same way!</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> Right. That goes for me too.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> Hwhat?</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> You&#39;ve been selfish, Berserker, and done whatever<br> you pleased. And yet...</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> Letting your worries about someone like me get in the<br> way of what you want isn&#39;t like you at all.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> Hey, wait. Stop, you fool—</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> ...Force connection. Ignore all errors. Insert the repair<br> program with everything I&#39;ve got. Start operating,<br> and hurry...!</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> ...Ugh. Augh...!</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> So stupid. You really are so stupid!</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> There&#39;s no way this&#39;ll work. I&#39;m not anything like you!<br> You&#39;re gonna blow up. Look, any second now,<br> you&#39;re gonna explode...</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> Ugh, just be quiet! Shut up!</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> ...explode.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> ...Or not?</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> (But why? Against all reason, it&#39;s actually working.)</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> (In human terms, this is like an impossible transfusion<br> where you&#39;d need to match genetically, never mind<br> blood types.)</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> (There can&#39;t be a match like that between a Servant<br> like me and a Master like her—)</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> Or can there be?</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> Is that how it is? Ayus, you&#39;re... You&#39;re...</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> Lancer!</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> Open your eyes...Lancer...</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> (Cough)</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> Lancer!</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> Aw...shit. I got beat down. I&#39;m usually the one doing<br> the beating...</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> How&#39;s the situation?</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> Okay enough. Assassin is fighting right now.</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> Though I can&#39;t say whether she can win.</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> Yeah, even the god of love oughta find Kali too much<br> to handle.</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> Berserker is...</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> He got it just as bad as you did, and it looks like his<br> Master&#39;s really trying to get him back up.</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> ...It may not make a difference.</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> Don&#39;t be so sure. That dickhead is tenacious as hell in<br> his own special way...no exaggeration.</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> Even without him, divine Kama can&#39;t carry this alone.<br> I gotta get back right... (Cough)</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> Say, Master. You got anything to eat?</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> What? No, you shouldn&#39;t need food.</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> I made sure to give you Raniment to fix you up,<br> so just wait a minute for it to—</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> Nah, forget that. Getting hungry is a major crisis for<br> me. Eating should help my recovery. Maybe.</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> Is it a mood thing?</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> More a motivation thing.</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> ...If you insist. Take this.</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> Ooh...a sandwich. This wasn&#39;t one&#39;a mine, was it?</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> I don&#39;t suppose this is your handiwork...?</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> How bad is it? I was watching you make your own,<br> so I killed some time...whipped something together...</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> Not bad. I couldn&#39;t ask for more from my Master&#39;s<br> home cooking.</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> Awright. I&#39;ll eat my fill—</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> What&#39;s wrong? If you don&#39;t want it, just throw it away.</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> No, I was wondering if you&#39;d tailored the taste.<br> You did that before for the AIs.</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> With your memory and powers of observation,<br> you carefully customize the taste parameters for each<br> person to make the most subtle buffs... It must be your<br> specialty.</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> I only did all that because I remembered it somehow.<br> It&#39;s nothing to do with specialties.</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> Besides, there&#39;s no way you&#39;d need that kind of fine<br> tuning. Makes no sense.</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> ...Even I have to see that. There&#39;s nothing about you<br> that&#39;s normal for a Servant.</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> You&#39;re one of the greater heroes who could beat most<br> Servants if you were to fight seriously.</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> I don&#39;t know how much greater a hero I might be.<br> I just don&#39;t wanna lose to anybody.</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> If there&#39;s anyone with a good chance, that&#39;d be the<br> middle of us five brothers.</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> ...Why would I, of all people, end up as your Master?</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> If it weren&#39;t for me, you&#39;d probably have an easier<br> time fighting.</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> You probably wouldn&#39;t have ended up beaten, bruised,<br> covered with wounds like this.</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> To be honest...you should give up on me already.<br> I don&#39;t think there&#39;s a better option. So why fight?</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> I told you before why I&#39;m fighting.<br> Because I want to make you smile.</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> And the reason I want to make you smile is because<br> you&#39;re my Master.</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> You were asking how it was that you became my<br> Master?</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> I got no clue.</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> But that don&#39;t bother me none. I&#39;m here because I<br> want to serve you.</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> That all fits in like the other stuff.

Why is that?</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Because—your calculations didn&#39;t account for<br> the most important parameter:</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Their emotions.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Structural defects.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Heroic Spirits are humans, and humans operate<br> through multiple personas regulating their emotions,<br> egos, and senses of purpose.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> In summary, we are complex beings composed by<br> numerous overlapping Alter Egos.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> You can&#39;t be considered human otherwise.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> But you&#39;re an AI. A mechanical being operating under<br> a single command.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> And that&#39;s why you failed to understand it.<br> That&#39;s what lead you to the mistaken assumption that<br> one ego was enough for us...</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> I see. I cannot deny that. But it raises a further<br> question.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> Why does the Alter Ego Class exist?</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> What sets a functional Alter Ego apart from a<br> dysfunctional Alter Ego?</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> That&#39;s another answer you can approach by looking<br> at the scene before you now.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I believe this comment also applied to me.<br> I must watch.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> So I gazed in the same direction as the AI girl next to<br> me.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> AIs are made to fulfill a role. They carry a singular<br> directive that&#39;s precious to them.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> In that way, they&#39;re no different from Alter Egos.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Beings created with a singular emotion have meanings,<br> values, and capabilities...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> But looking at it from another angle, they also have<br> sorrow, sin, and repulsiveness.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> With all said and done—was I able to figure it out?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> The meaning in Alter Egos existing?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I need to confront the issue.</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> Ah. My bad.</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> I lost track of stuff in the heat of the fight, but I gotta<br> ask the big question before it&#39;s over.</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> ...Did your wish come true?</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> Who knows? My wish for amendment was<br> totally self-important to begin with.</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> But maybe...it wasn&#39;t pointless.</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> Now that the war is done with, we can have some<br> days of peace again.</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> She won&#39;t be there to see, and I most likely won&#39;t be<br> directly involved either...</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> but I believe I managed to stay true to the directive she<br> wished for down to the very end.</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> Oh, that&#39;s right. You were fighting for someone else&#39;s<br> wish.</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> Even if that was a pessimist&#39;s attempt to make<br> amends, facts are facts. Be proud of what you<br> accomplished.</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> Yeah... I think that if you found the answer you were<br> looking for,</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> then victory didn&#39;t even need to be on the menu.</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> Heheh...hahaha, haaahahahahahaha!</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> W-what the hell?</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> It only now hit me.</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> I&#39;ve won numerous battles before gettin&#39; here.<br> I just kept winning nonstop. And now I&#39;m satisfied<br> with a defeat!</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> There was that one time that Hanuman put me in my<br> place, but this isn&#39;t like that.</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> That&#39;s the first time I lose in a good ol&#39; slugfest.</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> Against him of all people! That sure is a new one!</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> Okay, now it all makes sense.<br> That&#39;s one of the reasons why I lost.</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> In no right world would a fight end with the guy who<br> wouldn&#39;t mind a loss winnin&#39;.</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> Especially when the opponent is as freakin&#39; motivated<br> as he was.</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> Though while I don&#39;t regret the loss...I can&#39;t say the<br> same for all the rest.</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> Unlike you, Master, the parts I can&#39;t be proud<br> of—weigh on me.</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> Huh?</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> Sorry I never managed to cook anything you liked.</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> No...</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> That&#39;s completely wrong.</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> I always loved your cooking. How the hell couldn&#39;t I?</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> I was the problem.</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> It was all me thinking I didn&#39;t deserve to eat food that<br> made me happy...!</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> Sorry, Lancer.</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> I&#39;ve always been a source of regret to you.</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> Sorry I could never properly thank you for a good<br> meal. Sorry I never let you be a hero.</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> If I was normal, you could have been fighting and<br> winning instead of being so focused on cooking...</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> Nah, I don&#39;t feel that. I&#39;m glad things were how they<br> were.</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> I think it&#39;s best that I spent all my time cookin&#39; for you<br> and only fought right at the end.</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> If I had all of me and was my perfect warrior self...</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> I prolly wouldn&#39;t be able to forgive myself for getting<br> my ass kicked at the clutches of victory.</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> I&#39;d be whinin&#39; like a little baby right now.</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> I mean, even my current self is still pretty pissed that<br> it was him that did me in.</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> It was pathetic. I&#39;d die of embarrassment if any<br> brother of mine made fun of me for what happened.</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> But back to the point...</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> My satisfaction right now comes from this version of<br> me being more than just a warrior.</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> Maybe you being like this was for the best, too.</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> The version of you who was prisoner to an unknown<br> guilt and decided to fight to make amends.</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> You&#39;re fine like this.</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> I don&#39;t know if what I&#39;m saying means anything to you,<br> but...</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> I hope you manage to get the atonement that&#39;s at your<br> core.</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> Yeah. I hope I do... Do you think I can manage?</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> Already taught you how to. Just live the way you want<br> to.</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> Listen. Unforgettable pain can be hard to deal with,<br> but it can also be a driving force.</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> We brothers never forgot how humiliated we were,<br> and that&#39;s how we managed to survive both the long<br> exile and the war.</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> If you say you can&#39;t forget your guilt no matter what,<br> then—</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> That&#39;s a driving force you can convert into motivation<br> any time you want.</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> ...<br> ...!</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> That sure is a better way to handle it than how you<br> were doing, letting it crush you to the point you couldn&#39;t<br> do anything for long periods of time.</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> If you can&#39;t forget either way, just make it into your<br> strength. That way you got never-ending fuel to move<br> you forward.</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> When things get difficult, painful, suffocating—<br> you&#39;ve got what can move you to a better place.</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> Yeah... You&#39;re right.</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> I&#39;ll keep walking—taking this guilt with me as an<br> unforgettable motive.</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> That will take me where I want to go.</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> Time&#39;s up. Bye, Master.</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> If we ever meet again, I&#39;ll cook you some even better<br> stuff that&#39;s guaranteed to pull a smile out of you!</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> Look forward to it!</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> ...Okay. I will.</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> —</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> Haha. Sorry, looks like I&#39;m the only one who got my<br> wish granted—</p><h3 id="arrow-5-3" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#arrow-5-3" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Arrow 5</h3><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I just noticed that he never did hit me below the waist<br> &#39;til the very end.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> What meaning was there to it? What was on his mind<br> in that moment, and how did it make him feel?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Was the personality of the guy who doesn&#39;t go<br> through with it also a part of the original him?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I was on the verge of carelessly considering<br> that—</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> (Nope, forget it.

So what am I doing lying on<br> your lap...?</p><p><strong>J：Ayus:</strong><br> Is that really a problem? You&#39;ve always got your head<br> in the clouds.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> Well, that&#39;s &#39;cause I am, in fact, the coolest.<br> Don&#39;t you agree?</p><p><strong>J：Ayus:</strong><br> Kinda...when your mouth is shut.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> Hmph. I can tell you&#39;re just being shy.</p><p><strong>J：Ayus:</strong><br> So, are you satisfied?</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> My answer goes without saying, so I&#39;ll bounce that<br> back your way.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> How about you? Are you satisfied?</p><p><strong>J：Ayus:</strong><br> Just barely...I&#39;d say.</p><p><strong>J：Ayus:</strong><br> My brothers, my husband, my father-in-law.<br> All of you died without my knowing it.</p><p><strong>J：Ayus:</strong><br> Maybe I hated you men for going to war and leaving<br> me alone without a care.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>J：Ayus:</strong><br> So this has at least been better than that.</p><p><strong>J：Ayus:</strong><br> This time around...it looks like we managed to be<br> together for our last moments.</p><p><strong>J：Ayus:</strong><br> At least let me attend you at your end.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> ...Okay.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> No, wait. The hell are you even sayin&#39;? I&#39;m still in<br> fighting shape here.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> I&#39;ll give you the answer about my being satisfied:<br> Not in the least. Isn&#39;t it obvious?</p><p><strong>J：Ayus:</strong><br> —Not at all? Not one little bit?</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> Well...I wouldn&#39;t say that.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> It&#39;d be a lie if I said didn&#39;t attain some part of what I<br> was searching for.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> Much like you, my answer is also “just barely”.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> So you see. What I was searching for and what I<br> wanted was “everything”.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> Obviously...there&#39;d be a long-lost little sister counted<br> in that.</p><p><strong>J：Ayus:</strong><br> Hehe... Well, thanks.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> Hngh.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> Plus it wasn&#39;t even &#39;til I actually figured it out that I<br> realized what missing part was making me uneasy.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> Nothing I can do about that with the sheer number of<br> siblings.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> So don&#39;t go wandering off on your own, my silly little<br> sister. Grab hold of some cuff of your brother&#39;s clothes<br> so you won&#39;t disappear.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> Hold on, don&#39;t actually do that with mine. It&#39;ll annoy<br> me, so do it with Duhshasana.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> I don&#39;t want to. He would be just as annoyed and<br> angry about it.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> Well, try one of the other brothers. Anyone&#39;ll do.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> I used to have a lot on my plate back in the day.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> Way too many little brothers to handle. I had to get<br> everyone trained, go out looking for allies,</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> and I had to be the figurehead for a whole war.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> Now here I am, more than the sum of what I used to<br> be. A being who freely goes after all the things I want.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> ...Who are you?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> If I&#39;d been asked that, I&#39;d have had an answer.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I was probably—the Alter Ego of Avarice.<br> Probably something along those lines.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> Single-mindedly pursuing what I wanted was pleasant,<br> but in exchange, I could never have enough.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> I can&#39;t be satisfied with this.<br> Just my sister won&#39;t cut it!</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> (Sigh) You&#39;re the worst.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> But...I do see that. That&#39;s the kind of person you are.</p><p><strong>K：Duryodhana:</strong><br> Ahh...I&#39;m tired. Even I have to bow before sleepiness.</p><p><strong>K：Duryodhana:</strong><br> Friggin&#39; frustrating. I still want more things before I<br> have to sleep.</p><p><strong>K：Duryodhana:</strong><br> Yeah, I&#39;m the picture of avarice. Which brings me to...<br> Hey, c&#39;mere.</p><p><strong>K：Duryodhana:</strong><br> Yeah, you, Fujimaru.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...?</p><hr><p><strong>K：Duryodhana:</strong><br> We&#39;re still part of an alliance. That means you&#39;re<br> under my command.</p><p><strong>K：Duryodhana:</strong><br> So get out there and claim everything in my name.</p><p><strong>K：Duryodhana:</strong><br> Don&#39;t go lookin&#39; all shocked on me. I dunno what it&#39;s<br> about...but you&#39;re going back into a battle to save the<br> world, aren&#39;t ya?</p><p><strong>K：Duryodhana:</strong><br> If your battle is gonna make the world safe,<br> isn&#39;t that the same as makin&#39; the world yours?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I don&#39;t know about that...</p><hr><p><strong>K：Duryodhana:</strong><br> Why wouldn&#39;t it be? That&#39;s why I&#39;m making you my<br> proxy. In other words, you&#39;re gonna make the world<br> mine in my stead.</p><p><strong>K：Duryodhana:</strong><br> Heheh, good. Now I can get a quick sleep without any<br> anxiety.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> Ugh, I&#39;m sorry. Please don&#39;t pay him a second thought.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I consider it a Duryodhana-style pep talk.</p><hr><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> I guess...you could? I&#39;d judge it differently but, well,<br> if you want to take it in a positive light...</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> As long as I have time, allow me to say my piece.<br> I&#39;m nearly done for after the stunt I pulled before.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> Thank you for helping me all this way.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> I&#39;m so glad you were the first Master we met.<br> Someone who&#39;d come to the rescue of the Repair girls.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> Your kindness will surely save us all someday.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> Take care of your health, and good luck!</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> Yep...here comes the last will. I had to impart it to<br> Ashwatthama the same way back in life.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> You gotta leave it to others if you wanna rest in peace.<br> No question, that&#39;s the best course for a smart guy like<br> yours truly.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> So I&#39;m gonna tell it to you straight.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> You&#39;re the next commander-in-chief.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> Don&#39;t forget, you hear me?<br> Make the world—</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Those two–no, not just them. All the Servants in<br> this world must have gained something...</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> ...on account of being Alter Egos, and were able to<br> arrive at an answer they otherwise wouldn&#39;t.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> There&#39;s no denying that innate meaning.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> An Alter Ego is, generally speaking,<br> a “simplified being”.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> That&#39;s why they can often proceed in directions and<br> possibilities that “normal personalities” hardly ever<br> would...</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> Does that mean the issue lies in how they were<br> refined?</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> No. The opposite is more worthy of attention.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> The refinement process—it&#39;s not that you gave<br> them life through a faulty method, but they already had<br> life before the method became a factor.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> The question you need to consider is not “how to<br> refine someone into a new, simpler life”,</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> but “why did pre-existing life refine itself into<br> something simpler”.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> It&#39;s because they have performed the refinement that<br> the Alter Ego is produced. That&#39;s how I see it.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Unlike normal beings, they are a single emotion<br> extracted from inside an individual&#39;s ego.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> This emotion can often overflow or grow too strong,<br> which results in what happened here–</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> That&#39;s what makes them beings that “bear new<br> possibilities”, I suppose.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> Then you mean that what matters for an Alter Ego is<br> the directive that has overflown out of them naturally?</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Even if the overflow is not natural, I don&#39;t mean to say<br> that it would never manifest as something that<br> happens to bear power.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> In this world, those who approached such possibilities<br> ought to hold out until the very end.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Furthermore, not everyone has personality fragments<br> intense enough to naturally form another individual<br> single-handedly.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> The parts of a person can only go so far unsupported...</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> I think that must be why the class somehow binds<br> multiple divinities together so often.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> Even if you forcibly differentiated the form alone,<br> the probability that it will become powerful would be<br> low.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> Then, my methodology may truly have been much<br> like–</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> Trying to illuminate all of the night sky by launching<br> many paper moons into the cosmos–</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> A distorted formula that led only to empty answers<br> blinded by numbers.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> (Numbers, and distortions...)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> (That&#39;s right. I need to address that question of hers.)</p><hr><p><strong>Dust of Osiris:</strong><br> If there are distortions, they are within all of you<br> already.</p><p><strong>Dust of Osiris:</strong><br> You have already employed several Alter Egos.<br> You believe them fine to be handled as battle assets.</p><p><strong>Dust of Osiris:</strong><br> What reason is there why one is good but a hundred<br> unacceptable? To tolerate ten but denounce a<br> thousand?</p><p><strong>Dust of Osiris:</strong><br> If you have no answer, then there you have your<br> distortion. It&#39;s the same even with a single Alter Ego<br> unit.</p><p><strong>Dust of Osiris:</strong><br> You people are accepting, without any reason...</p><p><strong>Dust of Osiris:</strong><br> ...the distortions within the nature of Alter Egos<br> themselves.</p><p><strong>Dust of Osiris:</strong><br> The human race has a bad habit of covering for their<br> lack of calculations with sentiment, contradicting all<br> rationality.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Like you said, I think utilizing Alter Egos–</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> is a matter of distortion, whatever the numbers.</p><hr><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> But I want to believe that it isn&#39;t a mistake.</p><hr><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> Why...?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> They&#39;re all people who essentially</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> accepted themselves as Alter Egos.</p><hr><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> As long as that remains true, they might be all right.</p><hr><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> ...You do have trust in the Alter Egos of Chaldea,<br> don&#39;t you?</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> That naturalness proves its correctness, then.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> “Reason” is the key. Even if you haven&#39;t found it<br> yourself, each already had a reason inside them.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> I understand. It seems distorted at first glance,<br> but it&#39;s merely an accumulation of honesty–</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> A possibility such as that may well exist.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> Even if it was something like a miracle... It&#39;s<br> astronomical, and by nature should never happen.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> Yes. Being unaware of this is probably the biggest<br> source of my miscalculations.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> Emotions. Humans. Alter Egos. The state of a vessel<br> with a will. The state of power with personality.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> I should have studied these more deeply, now that<br> they appear so distant from this paper moon.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> The final stage of processing has been reached.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> I, the conversational interface, and Dust of Osiris,</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> who was the main body for the AI Holy Grail War<br> system will soon disappear.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> It will be a fundamental reboot, as expected.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> So there&#39;s no room for irregular existences to remain.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> What will happen to this world?</p><hr><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> This is the world within PAPERMOON, which has<br> conceptually taken form due to the Holy Grail&#39;s power<br> generated in this micro-realm.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> Once you retrieve the Holy Grail, you will lose the<br> means to observe this world.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> All that will be visible from the outside is the<br> PAPERMOON device operating as normal.</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> Then...what would be visible from the inside?</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> This is just a thought experiment of mine, but perhaps<br> the “usual world here” may yet continue on.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> I see. If so—I have one favor to ask.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Sure. You can have it. I already pieced together what<br> you&#39;re going to ask.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> The original premise was that the Holy Grail War&#39;s<br> winner would become the world&#39;s general supervisor AI.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> At which point, the original you...the personality of<br> Rani XII would be integrated and cease to exist.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> For you, the closing of the AI Holy Grail War led to the<br> beginning of the next, as well as a decisive death...</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> Small details are no great concern. So long as the<br> functions are passed along, there is no problem.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> It may only be a formality, Cerejeira,</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> but let&#39;s set you up for the vacant general supervisor<br> AI position.</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> So then...I guess I&#39;ll manage things like normal.<br> From somewhere no one can see it.</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> Yeah. If everything, especially Grow, keeps on moving<br> like normal...I wonder if she&#39;ll rest a bit easier?</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Incidentally, Cerejeira, what type of Alter Ego AI did<br> you happen to have?</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> Hers was also as experimental a case as the Master of<br> Berserker was.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> It&#39;s a form that was installed hastily and decided on<br> according to the situation. She is—</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Ungh. Now why didn&#39;t I put that together myself?</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> No. While even I was made into an Alter Ego,<br> I didn&#39;t account for anything like that.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Oh, so that&#39;s what it was...</p><hr><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> That doesn&#39;t feel real at all. Okay, it kinda does...</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> This should bring to a close everything I needed to say.<br> The time is near.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> One moment, please. That was all you needed to say,<br> but there is still something I need to say.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Rani XII, presently the latest version of general<br> supervisor management AI.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> ...?</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> These are purely the words of an Atlas Institute<br> alchemist.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> While the experiment failed, and your goals were in<br> error...</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> In any case, you have done what you determined as<br> best to avert the destruction you measured. All under<br> strict secrecy.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> That is a most laudable task.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> ...!?</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> You have carried out your duty splendidly.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Even if the action&#39;s means turned out to be incorrect,<br> I will not deny this.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> The words may be cliché, but you can&#39;t succeed at an<br> experiment if you&#39;re afraid of failure.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> You performed your function well, Rani XII.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Hold the mistaken data close to your heart,<br> and rest with no regrets.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> Thank you very much.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> That&#39;s correct. My wish has only been to avoid<br> destruction.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> And to that end, I dedicate potential mistake in my<br> observations and the significance of the experiment&#39;s<br> failure to your journey ahead.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> May the blessings of the stars shine upon you all.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> May the stars of the northern skies illuminate the way<br> through whatever difficulty,<br> and whatever darkness—</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Now. Let&#39;s not leave any mess in our wake.<br> Suppose we keep things appropriately themed?</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Then let&#39;s open a spiritron-separating logout gate...<br> keeping it door-shaped for simplicity&#39;s sake.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> We&#39;d better go now.<br> Anything to add for the end?</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> Yeah. I&#39;ve somewhat decided on what I need to say.</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> Talk to me next time we meet.</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> That&#39;s it...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Shouldn&#39;t be a problem.</p><hr><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> See you then.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Oh, I just remembered.<br> This is the end for me too, isn&#39;t it?</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> So I&#39;ll say this while I can, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> After all, I&#39;d rather avoid carrying over feedback that<br> could disturb the resolve of the me outside.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> I&#39;m glad I went on this adventure with you.<br> It made for a very pleasant dream.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> The time spent here was like a miracle for me.<br> One that can&#39;t be allowed to exist.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> What do you mean by...?</p><hr><h2 id="section-17-epilogue" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-17-epilogue" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 17: Epilogue</h2><h3 id="arrow-1-8" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#arrow-1-8" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Arrow 1</h3><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Senpai!

Thank goodness...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Yeah, nothing wrong with your vitals. Not to say there<br> ever was this whole time.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> It was slightly different from your usual REMREM<br> state, since you just abruptly awakened from this<br> sudden, mysterious coma...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Hm, quite the mystery indeed.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Sion had the same thing happen to her, and the timing<br> was almost identical.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> I guess so. But hey, as long as we woke up without any<br> issues and without after-effects to our health,</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> there&#39;s absolutely no need for concern! Wouldn&#39;t you<br> agree?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> You&#39;re probably right about that. But was there really<br> no particular primary cause or anything? Seriously?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Localized sleeping gas, electromagnetic pulses<br> affecting the brain, some unknown magecraft device...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> There must have been something.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Speaking of, I just recalled the issue we were dealing<br> with before we took a sudden nap.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> What became of PAPERMOON&#39;s malfunction?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> About that, it seemed to have been fixed at roughly<br> the same time the two of you awoke.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> It&#39;s back to being good as new, though I&#39;m performing<br> a check-up just in case. I have no idea what it could<br> have been.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> I&#39;ll just have to keep examining it, I guess.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> I see. Very good, then. Glad to see this intermission&#39;s<br> over.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Hm...?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> PAPERMOON...</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> What&#39;s the matter, Senpai? You seem confused...</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> I&#39;m guessing it has to do with something you saw in a<br> dream just now. Do you remember what it was about?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I definitely saw something,</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> but I can&#39;t remember what...at all...</p><hr><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> —</p><p><strong>Nemo Professor:</strong><br> Hello. Surprise. Excuse me, can I have a moment?</p><p><strong>Nemo Professor:</strong><br> Just now there was a change in the value of the<br> Human Order Foundation Display. It jumped from E to<br> D.</p><p><strong>Nemo Professor:</strong><br> Do either of you have an idea as to why this could be~?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Hm? No, not really.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Sion, do you know?</p><hr><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> I can&#39;t comment on that. It wasn&#39;t “my” experience,<br> after all.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Well, what I mean to say is that both<br> Fujimaru and I have unconsciously matured!</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Can we just leave it at “that&#39;s one problem resolved”<br> for this matter, please?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> —? (What was that? For Sion to so<br> crudely object...)</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Just go ahead and continue with Master<br> Fujimaru&#39;s examination.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> This time, it would appear the brain was the main<br> target of overuse, so examine it closely, if you would.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> R-right. I will.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> All right. One last check for good measure and then<br> we&#39;ll wrap up the examination for now.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> I may need to call on you again later, but for now,<br> you should all just get some rest in your rooms.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Although, Mash should rest here.

In that sense,<br> she is similar to you.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> However, as an Alter Ego, she was merely a copy of<br> her personality model,</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> so a direct connection to the her in the outside world<br> is nonexistent.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> Since the direct interference that brought the two of<br> you here was truly accidental, the mental transfer will<br> come to affect her real body.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> You two are currently in a coma in the outside world,<br> I presume. But she will come out of this completely<br> unaware anything happened to her.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> Whatever effect takes root, it will be in the sense of<br> subconscious feedback via sympathetic magecraft.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> As for the difference between her and you two...<br> it is naught but a simple and brief reason.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> From the onset, she was in a state that facilitates this.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> Ultimately, you were drawn in unintentionally.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> It is because of that difference only she ended up as<br> an official Master AI.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> If you permit my conjecture, I would presuppose she<br> already possessed some sort of mental instability.</p><p><strong>Rani XII:</strong><br> As if it were less taxing for her to slip out of character.<br> A denial of the current self; like seeking a different<br> self, or a different possibility—</p><p><strong>Elron:</strong><br> Hey...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Of course!</p><p><strong>Elron:</strong><br> Wow.</p><p><strong>Elron:</strong><br> Don&#39;t go blurting out affirmatives like that, you&#39;ll<br> startle people.</p><p><strong>Elron:</strong><br> Hey, listen.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> You want to...talk?</p><p><strong>Elron:</strong><br> Don&#39;t go finishing my sentences for me... Did you use<br> some kinda mind-reading?</p><p><strong>Elron:</strong><br> Ah, forget it.</p><hr><p><strong>Elron:</strong><br> I decided that one-to-one communication with you<br> was mostly Meunière&#39;s job, so I haven&#39;t exactly spoken<br> to you much whatsoever...</p><p><strong>Elron:</strong><br> But, there&#39;s something I wanted to talk to you about,<br> just for a little bit. Do you have some time for me?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> So what did you want to talk about?</p><hr><p><strong>Elron:</strong><br> R-right.</p><p><strong>Elron:</strong><br> I... For the longest time, I&#39;ve been wanting to<br> apologize to you.</p><p><strong>Elron:</strong><br> I don&#39;t really get it, but suddenly my heart is telling me<br> now is as good a time as ever. To talk with you, I mean.</p><p><strong>Elron:</strong><br> (Deep breaths)...</p><p><strong>Elron:</strong><br> Right. Listen closely, because this might turn into a<br> real trip down memory lane...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> December 27, 2017.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> The sky, which had been occupied by a violent snow<br> storm until late last night, now harbored not a single<br> cloud. Fair weather took root as dawn broke.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Below this azure sky soared a black aircraft—a<br> helicopter. It carried with it the visitors who would<br> herald the end.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Aww! They&#39;re finally here.</p><p><strong>Elron:</strong><br> What are you yelling for? You&#39;re that excited about<br> this job?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Not a chance. Even considering this isn&#39;t my main<br> responsibility,</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I figured before I even came here that being on gate<br> duty at some secret base in the Antarctic would be<br> super boring.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I mean, who are they expecting to come knocking?<br> Penguins?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> But still, even considering how boring it is...<br> When I think about the fact that this&#39;ll be the last time<br> I do this, it really gets to me.</p><p><strong>Elron:</strong><br> I guess so.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Anyway, considering how important our last time here<br> is, how come you&#39;re here assisting with gate duty?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Wait, Cerejeira, don&#39;t tell me you couldn&#39;t help but<br> want to spend as much of your last time here together<br> with me...</p><p><strong>Elron:</strong><br> As if. As usual, it&#39;s orders from the higher-ups.</p><p><strong>Elron:</strong><br> You know how it is. This is a rare moment where<br> there&#39;s any point to recording the gate&#39;s visitor log,<br> so throw any free records clerk that way.</p><p><strong>Elron:</strong><br> Also, I keep saying you&#39;re not on a first-name basis<br> with me.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> But I can&#39;t help if I just want to yell it out over and<br> over again. I mean, how many times could I really have<br> said it?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> H-hey...how about instead of that, I say something<br> which I haven&#39;t ever said to you before, and that I might<br> as well get off my chest?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> We&#39;ve worked together for such a long time here,<br> and now that this place is getting dissolved and we&#39;ll<br> all walk out of here for the first time...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Well...when we get out...I was wondering...just once,<br> if we could...have dinner?</p><p><strong>Elron:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Hey, I&#39;m being serious here.</p><p><strong>Elron:</strong><br> 312 times...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Huh?</p><p><strong>Elron:</strong><br> The number of times you&#39;ve used my first name.<br> I remember them all.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> O-oh. I see. That&#39;s our record keeper for you.<br> Imagine having that sort of memorization capability.</p><p><strong>Elron:</strong><br> No, that&#39;s not my point.</p><p><strong>G：Elron:</strong><br> “Just once,” you said.</p><p><strong>G：Elron:</strong><br> You insisted on calling me by my first name,<br> trying so hard to get close to me.</p><p><strong>G：Elron:</strong><br> But your serious dinner invitation is a one-time thing?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> ...<br> ...!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> N-no, don&#39;t be ridiculous, it&#39;s obvious I would ask you<br> out a bunch more times.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I&#39;d do that until you agreed, and when you finally did,<br> I&#39;d ask a bunch more after that...!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> That&#39;s fine, right...? I mean, that&#39;s what you&#39;d want,<br> right?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Alright, alright, alright, I finally did it. Nice show of<br> courage, me...!</p><p><strong>G：Elron:</strong><br> Spare me the celebration, you&#39;ve got work to do.</p><p><strong>G：Elron:</strong><br> Look, there&#39;s a signal above the gate.</p><p><strong>Elron:</strong><br> Seems they&#39;re here. The new director, Gordolf Musik,<br> and...</p><p><strong>Elron:</strong><br> Who&#39;s this? His pink-haired...secretary?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Yeah, that should be the secretary.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> It seems she&#39;s brought the UN inspection guys with<br> her, too. I guess she&#39;s not just some shady tagalong<br> after all.</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> Hey! Where&#39;s the mic on this thing? Is this it?<br> We&#39;re here! Open this door!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Yeah yeah, going through the response procedure<br> now.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Cerejeira, when that display turns green, press the<br> button to open the gate.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> So—what would you like to eat?</p><p><strong>Elron:</strong><br> Copy that.</p><p><strong>Elron:</strong><br> Anything&#39;s fine...but maybe some Portuguese food<br> after such a long time away from home—</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Elron:</strong><br> What I&#39;m saying is, I was the one who opened that<br> gate.</p><p><strong>Elron:</strong><br> When I think back on it now...it really was the last<br> chance to stop it all.</p><p><strong>Elron:</strong><br> I dream about it constantly. I think, if only I had<br> realized something was off.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> That must&#39;ve been hard. I mean...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Everyone already accepted they had to move on.</p><hr><p><strong>Elron:</strong><br> I know that.</p><p><strong>Elron:</strong><br> We all had to fill out paperwork and prepare for the<br> hearings.</p><p><strong>Elron:</strong><br> And the current director Musik has now redeemed<br> himself, having shown that even he was deceived.<br> None of us really had any other choice. It was fate&#39;s<br> lot.</p><p><strong>Elron:</strong><br> Yet—and yet!</p><p><strong>Elron:</strong><br> I can&#39;t help but think about what would have<br> happened had I not pressed that button.</p><p><strong>Elron:</strong><br> The last, I mean the absolutely last threshold between<br> it happening or not was my one button push.</p><p><strong>Elron:</strong><br> I can&#39;t stop thinking about that.</p><p><strong>Elron:</strong><br> Like, if I&#39;d just noticed something weird about<br> Koyanskaya, and lied about the gate malfunctioning.</p><p><strong>Elron:</strong><br> I could have gone to speak to someone else first.<br> I could have made a difference.</p><p><strong>Elron:</strong><br> And, if I could&#39;ve just done something right for once,</p><p><strong>Elron:</strong><br> I could have kept my promise about dinner with that<br> guy who couldn&#39;t make it to the Border!</p><p><strong>Elron:</strong><br> Countless scenarios have played over and over in my<br> head for the longest time. I&#39;m unable to forget them.</p><p><strong>Elron:</strong><br> I&#39;m...the record keeper. I like to keep a journal as a<br> hobby, but memorizing things is a power I have.<br> That&#39;s what my family&#39;s magecraft is about.</p><p><strong>Elron:</strong><br> It&#39;s not like I can turn it off; this feeling of guilt.</p><p><strong>Elron:</strong><br> This...this guilt I carry, if I&#39;d just been a bit more<br> cautious back then.</p><p><strong>Elron:</strong><br> I&#39;ve talked about it in counseling, but I think people<br> might be vaguely aware of it.</p><p><strong>Elron:</strong><br> No, they would&#39;ve probably figured it out by now.</p><p><strong>Elron:</strong><br> But right now, I...I just wanted to tell you in person.<br> I wanted to apologize in person.</p><p><strong>Elron:</strong><br> So that&#39;s what I&#39;m going to do.</p><p><strong>Elron:</strong><br> I know it might seem self-centered of me, but I really<br> do need to say this.</p><p><strong>Elron:</strong><br> —I&#39;m so sorry.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You don&#39;t need to apologize...</p><hr><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> The guilt you feel—</p><hr><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I&#39;m sure everyone here feels the same.</p><hr><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> That&#39;s right.

Will do.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Good night...</p><hr><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> (Sigh)...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> —Perhaps the parts of the ego that made up the<br> Alter Ego wanted to make themselves known.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Something that is bottled up but still “definitely there”<br> within a person, with the goal of coming up to the<br> surface.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Perhaps that manifestation is what we would call an<br> Alter Ego.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Specifically, maybe it&#39;s the case that within the<br> person who gave birth to the Alter Ego of Yearning,<br> no matter how indistinct or suppressed, there exists<br> a—</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> Dummy...</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Man, I&#39;m beat.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Considering the assimilative analysis ascertained by<br> Rani XII at the time of establishing the route between us,</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> it&#39;s obvious that this event was one of the distortions<br> of the Human Order we had to deal with; one of the<br> so-called Ordeal Calls.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> But I would&#39;ve never guessed such a distortion had<br> accumulated within a place like PAPERMOON without<br> my knowing.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> This was nothing Seven Superweapons level,<br> but if I&#39;d upped the managerial attitude, maybe I<br> could&#39;ve spotted distortions at an even finer scale.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> It&#39;s really embarrassing as an administrator to admit<br> such a mistake.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> The single praiseworthy point would be that the event<br> was resolved as quickly as it occurred.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Other than that, everything has been a mistake I gotta<br> make sure not to repeat.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Maybe it&#39;s because of me being accustomed to<br> Thought Partitioning, but my memories have<br> unfortunately made it back to me intact.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Though, would I be the only one who remembers?</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Kama is...also the type to be accustomed to “multiple<br> selves”, so to speak.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> It might be possible she does, but it would be akin to a<br> samurai&#39;s elegy, so it would probably end up cut right<br> out.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Elron and Fujimaru would be affected on a<br> deeply subconscious level at best, I presume.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Speaking of, maybe I should verify something.<br> A thought experiment, of sorts.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> What got us dragged into PAPERMOON&#39;s world was<br> the initial rotation to produce Alter Egos.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> In other words, it only stands to reason that he was<br> also an Alter Ego.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> In other words, it only stands to reason that she was<br> also an Alter Ego.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> So, just what kind of Alter Ego was<br> Fujimaru?</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> [♂ His /♀️ Her] poor physical condition as soon as we entered<br> that world is something of a clue.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> That condition was such that it became downright<br> impossible to fight without assistance from my<br> Etherlight.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Poor conditions of unknown cause; a lag between<br> mind and body. When considering the meaning of this...<br> I see.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Hypothesis 1: [♂ he /♀️ she] might have been [♂ his /♀️ her] “tired of<br> fighting” or “pacifistic” side.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Sure, that&#39;s a good trait to have. Necessary, even.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> It&#39;s a personality trait that every human should<br> naturally possess.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Without it, [♂ he /♀️ she] definitely wouldn&#39;t be able to return to<br> [♂ his /♀️ her] daily life once all the fighting is over.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Let&#39;s consider the reverse for a moment.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Suppose someone&#39;s raring for a fight, ready to do so<br> for the sake of the world without either hesitation or<br> anxiety, and not even a single particle of them was<br> averse to fighting...</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> A person like that would be nothing more than a<br> bloodthirsty warrior.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> You could say they would be broken.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Once all the fighting was over, I&#39;m sure they wouldn&#39;t<br> be able to return to daily life. They would be stuck<br> preoccupied with something reeking of blood.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> But, we&#39;ve seen that doesn&#39;t have to be the case,<br> and that&#39;s an important fact.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> That&#39;s why [♂ he /♀️ she] will be just fine.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Because if we look at the act of going to the frontlines<br> with Medusa&#39;s virtual Noble Phantasm as a Mystic Code,</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> we can see that there was not a hint of aversion to<br> fighting. But that doesn&#39;t pose a contradiction, either.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Think about it like this:</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> One fell in love because she was trying to avoid love.<br> Another fought despite that he didn&#39;t want to.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> There might be a part of you that, although weary of<br> fighting, will still fight if there&#39;s a reason,</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> even if calculations show it will cause some anxiety<br> due to acting contrary to oneself.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> We&#39;ll just have to keep up the counseling for when<br> that comes to pass.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> As for another possibility...it&#39;s a bit hindsight-based,<br> but [♂ he /♀️ she] didn&#39;t win the Holy Grail War.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> If that&#39;s our hint,</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> we could say [♂ he /♀️ she] was no longer the only Master in the<br> real world, the protagonist burdened with the fate of<br> the world.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> [♂ He /♀️ She] would have been just “an ordinary Master”.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Was [♂ he /♀️ she] an Alter Ego wishing for the comfortable<br> position where [♂ he /♀️ she] can be just another Master and<br> that&#39;s fine?</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Hmm, I guess that&#39;s reaching a bit.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Well, to be honest, even the reason for getting<br> involved is guesswork.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> It&#39;s entirely possible [♂ he /♀️ she] was the only person who<br> wasn&#39;t turned into an Alter Ego,</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> and it was only because [♂ he /♀️ she] had a Command Spell<br> that [♂ he /♀️ she] got slotted into the framework of being a<br> Master in the first place.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> [♂ His /♀️ Her] poor physical condition could have honestly just<br> been an error in reconstruction at the time of<br> conversion.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> I would guess there&#39;s about a fifty-fifty chance.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> No, let&#39;s leave the investigation of [♂ his /♀️ her] case for<br> another time...</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> For now, I should reflect on myself rather than other<br> people.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> It turned out pretty useful that it was a form of me<br> from the past,</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> since the “thread” I discarded long ago for simply<br> being too inhumane was still usable.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> It was certainly a dark part of my history.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Still—it really was there. And it still is within me.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Despite having concluded that I must not become [♂ his /♀️ her]<br> friend,</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> I went ahead and, despite my better judgement,<br> made an infantile rebuttal that it&#39;s not like I don&#39;t<br> want to be.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Oopsie, this memory&#39;s gonna have to be cut out.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Even so, albeit seemingly counterproductively,<br> I let part of it play back.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> But I haven&#39;t forgotten my position when it comes to<br> the me here and now.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> It&#39;s only now that I&#39;ve travelled through a world where<br> I could behave as if I&#39;d forgotten that,</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I&#39;m able to once again confirm that my feelings,<br> from the very beginning, were no lies.</p><h3 id="arrow-3-4" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#arrow-3-4" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Arrow 3</h3><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Oh, who&#39;s there?</p><hr><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> (Munch, munch, munch)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Xu Fu with some curry bread.</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> (Chew)<br> ...Don&#39;t look at me, I&#39;m not giving you any.</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> This curry bread is a collab recipe between Baker and<br> that newly-summoned burly cook.</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> Its spices are truly spicy (forgive my lacking<br> vocabulary) and addictive.</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> Go grab your own if you want some.</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> What am I reading during my lunch, you ask...?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Xu Fu with some book.</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> (Chew) Got any problems with my reading?</p><hr><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> This essay-type file got dropped in the database and<br> no one knows where it&#39;s from.</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> It&#39;s cool and all that the test run of your emergency<br> charge correspondence thing managed to summon me<br> to this world, but now that I&#39;m here, I kinda have<br> nothing to do.</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> So I&#39;m reading it to kill time.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> What&#39;s the essay about?</p><hr><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> Some theory work about the significance of Alter<br> Egos and their formation process.</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> It says, “We&#39;ve been frivolously making use of this<br> Class without comprehending their essence and<br> significance.”</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> “This is the moment to reevaluate this matter.”</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> “This essay hopes to lead the readers to a deeper<br> understanding of their Alter Egos,”</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> “and enable them to utilize the Class to its maximum<br> potential—”.</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> How formal of the writer. Oh, one major thing it said.</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> “It&#39;s of utmost importance to note that the average<br> Alter Ego spawns spontaneously,”</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> “making it extremely difficult to consciously produce<br> Alter Egos,”</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> “unless the cases where the maker possesses a<br> considerably rule-breaking Skill or is utilizing<br> themselves as the material are considered.”</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> Talk about spelling out the obvious.</p><p><strong>Xu Fu:</strong><br> I mean, look at me.
