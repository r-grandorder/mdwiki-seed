A Noble Phantasm that belongs not to Goetia, but to the true King Solomon (Dr. Roman).<br> The exploits that he had fulfilled until now, the miracles that he had accomplished until now, the magic that he had achieved until now; it is a poem of parting that lets go of it all.<br> Upon the invocation of this Noble Phantasm, Solomon returns back to the heavens the graces that he had received from God, losing his eye that gazes at the world.<br> The result is the death of King Solomon. And conversely, the disintegration of the 72 demon gods.<br> It can be said to be the safety device that Solomon had prepared for the sake of destroying &quot;magic&quot;, should the time in a distant future comes when it becomes an evil for human.<br> ...When this Noble Phantasm is employed, Solomon would vanish from even the Throne of Heroes.</p><p>Solomon&#39;s complete evanescence implies not of erasure of all traces of Solomon, but rather that that everything that he must do now had been completed.<br> ...Each and every living existences have things they had left undone as their time is concluded and ended.

There is no emotion within him; he is inhuman, deprived of the autonomy to symphatize with the joy and sorrow of the people.</p><p>Only when he becomes Romani Archaman that he finally acquires his original human nature.<br> His root is that of a pessimist and realist. Even though he speaks of wishful thinking as a moodmaker, due to himself unable to think of that as more than pipe dreams, he is quite shameless in some respects.<br> He loves humans, but because he&#39;s a coward in nature who &quot;does not want to see sad things&quot;, he ends up limiting himself with superficial relationships. On the other hand, he is capable of being good terms with pretty much everybody. Your typical affable friendly guy.<br> When being faced with a dilemma, he has the bad habit of choosing to stay undecided and devoting himself to just observe, or just straight up runs away, so that the status quo is maintained.<br> Due to Roman himself is reflecting on that weakness of his, it only needs a few words, for someone in his surroundings to simply says &quot;hang in there&quot;, for him to somehow holds his ground and displays a resolution worthy of the King of Magic.</p><p>Incidentally, any Servants would end up having &quot;I don&#39;t know the reason but this guy&#39;s the one at fault here&quot; as their first impression for Roman; and due to that they will unconsciously complain about him.<br> The only ones who don&#39;t judge him negatively are those who aren&#39;t Servants, the contrarians, and the Berserkers that don&#39;t perceive evil as evil.</p><h2 id="attitude-towards-master" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#attitude-towards-master" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Attitude Towards Master</h2><p>He conceals the fact that he had been Solomon, collaborating with the protagonist as a human.<br> The first Heroic Spirit that Chaldea summoned. (Summoning Case No. 1)<br> He had had the premonition of the arrival of humankind&#39;s extinction, unknown in its nature, and had been hiding himself in Chaldea as a researcher.<br> The reason that he keeps his true colors hidden is because he is wary against the mastermind behind the incineration of human history, and at the same time due to him feeling responsible out of fear that somehow, he is the one to blame for this.<br> While he does think that it is unjustifiable to the protagonist, he himself is completely unapologetic about it.<br> &quot;I mean, there&#39;s just no helping it. You can hate me all you want, I don&#39;t mind. Actually, it would only be natural if you do. To begin with, I&#39;m just not someone worthy for other people to like.&quot;<br> Due to him undervaluing (self-torturing) himself like that, he thinks that it&#39;s only natural for people to detest him rather than like him.</p><p>&lt;&gt;</p><p>Winner of the Holy Grail War of the year 2004.<br> His wish upon the Grail is &quot;to live as a human&quot;.<br> In the midst of the Holy Grail War, Solomon thought of this.<br> &quot;Romance. Romance, is it! Such a pleasant word. A fresh concept, one yet to exist during my time.&quot;<br> A phrase that had yet to exist in his age.<br> A way of life where a single human freely embraces their dream.<br> For such a world that displays such a thing to exist.<br> It was because he felt, from the bottom of his heart, that it is such a magnificent thing, that Solomon decided to call himself &quot;Roman&quot;.<br> And after the Holy Grail War had concluded.<br> Receiving the name Romani Archaman, Roman then set out to begin his second life. Alas, he was unable to experience the fullness, the joy of being human that he had not acquire during his live.<br> For his freedom had been snatched away when he was shown a glimpse of the future, of the end of mankind, just as he had been made human.<br> Ever since then, just like an infant newly born to the world, he had to chase an enemy whose true nature he knew not of in reselessness, embarking on a lone man&#39;s struggle.<br> As he, in desperation, chased after knowledge, acquired technology, and ran as if weeping in the darkness, he made it in time for the fated moment (the 2015 rayshift experiment.)</p><p>During the final stage of the first part, Roman is struck with an inner conflict when he had fathomed that Goetia was the mastermind.<br> He has a way of defeating Goetia.<br> If he could reach the Time Temple, confront Goetia before he is aware of the existence of the &quot;last ring&quot;, and make use of Solomon&#39;s first Noble Phantasm, then he could make Goetia lost his invincibility.<br> But at the same time, it would mean his own obliteration.<br> The previous Solomon would just say &quot;That, too, is fine, I suppose&quot; and would simply be done with it. But the previous Solomon is not the current Solomon.<br> He is Dr. Roman now.<br> The king who had tasted his second life, who had been made known of the magnificence of life, is in anguish.<br> To resolve himself for death.<br> Could he overcome that fear, that remorse?</p><h2 id="historical-character-and-figure" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#historical-character-and-figure" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Historical Character and Figure</h2><p>A figure who lived between BC 1000 to BC 931.

Tell me of what you desire. Ask, and I shall give it to you.&quot;<br> Solomon desired not of gold or power; above all that, above anything, he wished for wisdom.<br> God was content with his answer, for Solomon&#39;s very answer was a sign that he possessed the qualifications to reach &quot;true wisdom&quot;.<br> Solomon&#39;s eye was then awakened, and he was granted ten rings on both of his hands.<br> It was the very mark of the wise man approved by God.
