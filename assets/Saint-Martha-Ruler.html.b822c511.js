However, since this resistance is just allowing her to divert (evade) the Magecraft, fundamentally only Martha will be saved in the case of a wide-range magic attack.</p><h2 id="personal-skills" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#personal-skills" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Personal Skills</h2><p><strong>Saint of the Waterside: [B+]</strong></p><p>Having drifted on board a boat and reined in the Tarasque by the Rh\xF4ne\u2019s riverbank, Martha has deep connections to water. That disposition was strengthened by changing into a swimsuit at this occasion. Upon perceiving a waterside, Martha\u2019s offensive power rises. She gets on board.</p><p><strong>Natural Body (Sea): [A+]</strong></p><p>Martha\u2019s body, which was undressed from holy garments, is perfect as a living being. It is amazing when undressed. It is a Skill that denotes the absoluteness of the body, but it also functions as a charm Skill towards others.</p><p><strong>Jacob\u2019s Limbs: [B]</strong></p><p>An old method of hand-to-hand combat that was continuously inherited from Jacob, to Moses, and finally to Martha. If reached to its limits, one can triumph even over an archangel. According to legends, a Saint who mastered this can surely beat to death an \u201Cangel of destruction\u201D that leads 12,000 angels. In addition, the reason why Martha can bring out \u201Cthat sort of behaviour\u201D at the time of her Noble Phantasm\u2019s True Name Release is surely because of this Skill.</p><p><strong>True Name Discernment: [C]</strong></p><p>Automatically grasps a Servant\u2019s True Name as well as their entire status information during a direct encounter. However, in regard to Servants who possess concealment abilities, a success of a Luck Check becomes a requirement to bypass those abilities.</p><p>\u201CIt is expected that I have it. It is a Skill one should be endowed with as a Ruler.\u201D</p><p><strong>Divine Ruling: [A]</strong></p><p>The supreme privilege of a Ruler. One can exercise two Command Spells for each Servant participating in a \u201CHoly Grail War\u201D, but in \u201CFate/Grand Order\u201D, this consists of different Skill effects. However, Martha fundamentally does not use this Skill in \u201CFate/Grand Order\u201D.</p><p>\u201CIt is expected that I have it, but\u2026 seeing that it is not a Holy Grail War, what I know is that even the role of a Ruler has come to be altered in due course, do you not think so?\u201D</p><h2 id="noble-phantasm-s" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#noble-phantasm-s" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Noble Phantasm(s)</h2><h1 id="tarasque-o-sad-drake-who-runs-wild" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#tarasque-o-sad-drake-who-runs-wild" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Tarasque: O\u2019 Sad Drake Who Runs Wild</h1><ul><li>Rank: A</li><li>Classifications: Anti-Personnel Noble Phantasm / Anti-Dragon Noble Phantasm</li><li>Range: 1~50</li><li>Maximum Number of Targets: 1 person</li></ul><p>Iron Fist Holy Judgement. A fearsome Anti-Personnel Noble Phantasm that looks like Tarasque\u2019s prayer taking form; say, a sort of prayer of not wanting to be only treated like before. While Tarasque comes flying in to crash onto the target, Martha gives further damage with a barrage of fists. Although it appears as if Tarasque is being struck by the barrage, because Martha is swinging her fists with the same striking method as a kind of \u201Csunkei\u201D[1] that \u201Cgoes through\u201D him, there is no damage being done to Tarasque, and all the damage appears to be delivered to the target underneath Tarasque\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014or so it seems.</p><p>Tarasque\u2019s voice: \u201CStop, it\u2019s quite painful!\u201D</p><h1 id="character" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#character" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Character</h1><h2 id="pronouns" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#pronouns" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Pronouns</h2><p>First Person Pronoun: watashi<br> Second Person Pronouns: anata / (sometimes) anta<br> Third Person Pronouns: kare / kanojo / (sometimes) aitsu / (sometimes) yatsu</p><h2 id="personality" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#personality" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Personality</h2><p>It should be as usual, but\u2026 as a matter of fact, Martha\u2019s state of being has become somewhat anxious given that she does not carry her cross. Because of that, it is possible to catch glimpses of the signs of \u201Cthose times\u201D from before she held the holy staff appearing and disappearing. When compared to her materialization as a Rider, these frequencies are somewhat higher. For Martha herself, who has manners like this, the way she loses her bearings is unconcealable, even though she has a feeling where she is not sure if this is the Lord\u2019s trial.</p><h2 id="attitude-towards-master" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#attitude-towards-master" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Attitude Towards Master</h2><p>Judging from appearances, Martha is her usual self. However, it is also a matter of time before she becomes serious in accepting everything from the Master as it cannot be helped that, since now that it has come to this, the Master begins to appear as her \u201Cyounger brother\u201D.</p><p>Even if things turn for the worse, Martha will not be wishing on the Holy Grail to return to her original Saint Graph. There is only one Holy Grail as far as Saint Martha is concerned, and even if her Saint Graph is altered, she will not be misled by a fake Holy Grail too. That is her foregoing thought.</p><h2 id="dialogue-examples" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#dialogue-examples" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Dialogue Examples</h2><p>\u201C\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014Martha.
