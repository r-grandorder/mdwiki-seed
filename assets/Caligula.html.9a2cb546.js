If the contact happens from a figure who is related to Rome, a plus modifier is appended to the check. That is to say, if Nero or Romulus approaches him for example, to start with, Caligula will reliably succeed in restraining himself. However, given that the matter of being restrained is just him \u201Cchanging into a standby status instead of rampaging around\u201D, one can conclude that coming to a complete mutual understanding with Caligula does not prove to be feasible.</p><h2 id="personal-skills" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#personal-skills" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Personal Skills</h2><p><strong>Imperial Privilege: [A]</strong></p><p>Skills that essentially cannot be possessed by oneself can be acquired for a short time.

Furthermore, because he fell into a state in which his self-restraint is ineffective due to the Madness Enhancement Skill, Caligula is unmanageable. Even if he speaks the human language, given that it is something like a beast\u2019s roar, coming to a mutual understanding with Caligula is impossible. However, even in such a state, he likes Rome.

Without waiting for deification by the statesmen of ancient Rome that one would succeed in acquiring after death, Caligula forced the people, with his tyranny and dissipation, to call himself a god while he was still living, having exhausted his wickedness and perversion to their limits. The people of Rome violently trembled from the sudden change of the Emperor, and unanimously whispered: \u201CThe wise ruler had already disappeared, and now, Emperor Gaius, no, Caligula, has fallen into madness.\u201D The reign of the young Emperor who had gone insane did not last long. He was assassinated, struck by the blade of rebellion from the many people who chose to center their influence around powers such as the Senate. That reign was only four years. However, that name was deeply left behind in the people\u2019s memories as numerous acts of atrocities.</p><p>According to the values of ancient Rome at that time, it is said that Caligula\u2019s insanity was namely considered the same as \u201Cbeing loved by the moon.\u201D That is\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014Caligula had received the affection of the Moon Goddess.</p><p>While he is an existence close to an Anti-Hero, the reason why Caligula materialized as a Heroic Spirit is unknown.
