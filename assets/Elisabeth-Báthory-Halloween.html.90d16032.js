Completely cutting off her anecdote of piercing torture Iron Maiden by treating it as \u201Ctotally have nothing to do with me\u201D, she changes her weapon from a spear to a fork. Due to her overflowing magic energy, she is able to perform magic even if she had never really learn it. She herself totally doesn\u2019t get how it works.

I don\u2019t have a 5 star Caster other than Tamamo, so everytime I need some firepower for a Caster assault it\u2019s always HalloEli. Due to that, I\u2019m seeing her a lot., so I\u2019m glad I got her clothes good. Please give more event Servants!!!!
