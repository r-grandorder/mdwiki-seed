There&#39;s not a lot of time, so I&#39;ll get straight to the point.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> There&#39;s an enemy attack. As we speak, Chaldea is under assault.</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> A-an enemy attack!? Wh-who is the assailant!?</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> First things first, prepare to counter-attack! Is the magical energy barrier holding up still!?</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> That&#39;s irrelevant. The attack is not coming from the outside.</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> What are you saying...?</p><p><strong>Da\xA0Vinci:</strong><br> An unexpected reaction of large amounts of magical energy has been detected within Chaldea! The magical energy contamination is spreading rapidly!</p><p><strong>Da\xA0Vinci:</strong><br> Furthermore, Sion...this Saint Graph pattern...!</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Both TRISMEGISTUS II and the Observation Lens SHEBA have come to the same conclusion.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Well, if I&#39;m being honest, it&#39;s a real doozy!</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> At present, a hostile existence is encroaching on Chaldea. Its true nature is\u2014</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Beast!?</p><hr><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Professor:</strong><br> Yuup! We&#39;ve tried all sorts of things, but we can&#39;t stop the encroachmeeent.</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Professor:</strong><br> This is pretty dang bad!</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Engineer:</strong><br> This is Engine speaking! Hey! The contamination has spread all the way here!</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Engineer:</strong><br> If this place goes, we&#39;re all toast! You get that, don&#39;t you!?</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Marine:</strong><br> Waah, make it stop! It&#39;s going to swallow us whole!</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Marine:</strong><br> Evacuate! Evacuate!</p><p><strong>Meuni\xE8re:</strong><br> Whoa, these guys are in serious trouble! What are we gonna do!?</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> With the way things are, we have no choice but to counter-attack.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Fujimaru, we need to strike at the source.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Roger!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> We&#39;d better go!</p><hr><p><strong>Da\xA0Vinci:</strong><br> Well put. No need to discuss it further. In that case, I have some more bad news.</p><p><strong>Da\xA0Vinci:</strong><br> While we took readings throughout the ship, severe magical energy contamination was detected inside the coffins as well.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> What!? That means...the Beast got its hands on the Rayshift system...!</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Tch...! This is reeaaally really bad!</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> We have no choice but to mount a counter-attack. But these are anything but good circumstances.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Da Vinci. I wish to determine the extent of the facility&#39;s contamination. If my conjecture is correct\u2014</p><p><strong>Da\xA0Vinci:</strong><br> Nothing sure gets by you. It&#39;s just as you fear, Holmes.</p><p><strong>Da\xA0Vinci:</strong><br> While checking for the same, severe magical energy contamination was detected inside the coffins as well.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> What!? That means...the Beast got its hands on the Rayshift system...!</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> As expected... Then our enemy is one familiar with Rayshifting?</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> The current whereabouts of the Beast have been determined from the range of contamination.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> It goes without saying that Rayshifting is vital to our operations here in Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> If you will, please repel the Beast. Whatever the cost!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> (Nodding furiously)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Fujimaru, heading out!</p><hr><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Foouu...!</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> Whoa!? What the blazes!?</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> You mean to say someone as surly as our hazardous Bacon Eater has anything to fear!?</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> This is no time to be rowdy! I&#39;ll share my emergency bacon with you if you just calm down!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I&#39;m sorry, Senpai, but it&#39;ll take some time to prepare the Ortenaus!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Until then, please...!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Leave it to me!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Worst case, I&#39;ll use a Command Spell!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes! Senpai, Kadoc, best of luck!</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> It&#39;s up ahead... Get ready!</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Our enemy is a Beast. Letting down your guard for even an instant could prove fatal...but I don&#39;t need to tell you that, do I?</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> After all, you&#39;re probably the magus who has by far fought the most Beasts in all of human history!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> We&#39;ll be fine!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I&#39;m counting on you!</p><hr><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> I never ever expected you to rely on me like that, but that&#39;s the kind of situation this is, I guess!</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> What the...!? Speak of the devil!</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Something&#39;s coming...!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes! Senpai, best of luck!</p><p><strong>Da\xA0Vinci:</strong><br> It&#39;s just up ahead! Be careful!</p><p><strong>Da\xA0Vinci:</strong><br> Your enemy is a Beast.

They might look very different, but the one in front of you now is\u2014</p><p><strong>M\uFF1A???:</strong><br> \u2014!</p><p><strong>Da\xA0Vinci:</strong><br> Tiamat\u2014the Divine Spirit manifested as a Beast in the Seventh Singularity!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Tiamat...!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> She&#39;s pretty small now, though...</p><hr><p><strong>O\uFF1AMeuni\xE8re:</strong><br> Why is a Beast we defeated back all of a sudden!? How&#39;s that even possible!?</p><p><strong>P\uFF1ASion:</strong><br> No, that&#39;s not quite it. She isn&#39;t a Beast!</p><p><strong>P\uFF1ASion:</strong><br> Tiamat&#39;s Class has now been identified. Her class is... Alter Ego!</p><p><strong>P\uFF1ASion:</strong><br> That means the Beast is still afoot!</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Wh\u2014</p><p><strong>O\uFF1AMeuni\xE8re:</strong><br> W-what are you even talking about!?</p><p><strong>Tiamat:</strong><br> Do not loiter about so absent-mindedly, children!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Did she just protect me?</p><hr><p><strong>Tiamat:</strong><br> Lift yourselves!

The sixth Beast\u2014Sodom&#39;s Beast\u2014 approaches!</p><p><strong>Da\xA0Vinci:</strong><br> Haa, what&#39;s this!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> A Demon God Pillar!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> But something&#39;s different?</p><hr><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> I&#39;ve only seen the records in Chaldea&#39;s database, but yeah, it does seem to have taken a different form here.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> So what&#39;s up with this thing? Is it really a Demon God Pillar?</p><p><strong>Da\xA0Vinci:</strong><br> Not quite, the Saint Graph pattern is totally different from a Demon God Pillar! That thing is mimicking the Pillars, but is something else entirely!</p><p><strong>Da\xA0Vinci:</strong><br> Not quite, the Saint Graph pattern is totally different from a Demon God Pillar! That thing is mimicking the Pillars, but is something else entirely!</p><p><strong>Tiamat:</strong><br> Oh no, you don&#39;t!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> She protected me again!</p><hr><p><strong>Tiamat:</strong><br> Listen well. I am an alter ego of the Beast which you once defeated.</p><p><strong>Tiamat:</strong><br> There is no way I would allow you, who defeated me, to be beaten by another Beast.</p><p><strong>Tiamat:</strong><br> Mother will not allow allow such slander as saying, \u201CThe second Beast is no match for the others\u201D.</p><p><strong>Tiamat:</strong><br> Another you elsewhere gained victory over Beast VI... but if you lose here, it will all have been in vain! Hmph!</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> I have no idea what you&#39;re talking about, but... are you saying you&#39;re on our side now?</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> No, that doesn&#39;t matter! Now&#39;s our chance, Fujimaru!</p><p><strong>Da\xA0Vinci:</strong><br> I don&#39;t really understand what she&#39;s trying to say, but regardless, it seems Tiamat isn&#39;t our enemy right now.</p><p><strong>Da\xA0Vinci:</strong><br> Mash is currently en route! Do your best until then!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> (Nodding)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I&#39;m counting on you all!</p><hr><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Tiamat:</strong><br> Know your place. A mother is very powerful.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> It&#39;s not nearly as strong as the Demon God Pillars in the records...</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Is it because it&#39;s a fake? Or\u2014is it weakened?</p><p><strong>Meuni\xE8re:</strong><br> That didn&#39;t seem as strong as the real Demon God Pillars, did it? Is it just because it&#39;s a fake?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Or perhaps\u2014it is weakened?</p><p><strong>Demon\xA0Pillar?:</strong><br> Ca..... En.....</p><p><strong>Tiamat:</strong><br> ...! Here it comes!</p><p><strong>Demon\xA0Pillar?:</strong><br> \u2014It caNnot enD now! Not hEre!</p><p><strong>Demon\xA0Pillar?:</strong><br> It cannot end here! It cannot end like this!</p><p><strong>Demon\xA0Pillar?:</strong><br> At the bottom of that lifeless place\u2014 with no one attending my deathbed!</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Tch...! What the hell is happening!?</p><p><strong>Da\xA0Vinci:</strong><br> The magical energy signature is increasing!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> There&#39;s a lot of Pillars!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> But they still look wrong!</p><hr><p><strong>Da\xA0Vinci:</strong><br> Oh, rather than a Demon God Pillar, they&#39;re more like... dragon heads\u2014</p><p><strong>Tiamat:</strong><br> \u2014Demon Beast Incarnadines! The underlings of Sodom&#39;s Beast!</p><p><strong>Tiamat:</strong><br> They have crossed over from the Testament World, into this Chaldea!</p><p><strong>Tiamat:</strong><br> They really don&#39;t know when to give up!</p><p><strong>Demon\xA0Pillar?:</strong><br> Fujimaru! If only... If we could only seize you...!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Oh hell...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> This won&#39;t end well!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> \u2014Senpai!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Mash!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Thanks, you saved me!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes, sorry for keeping you! Mash Kyrielight, initiating combat!</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> I&#39;ll pitch in with reinforcement magecraft. It might just provide peace of mind, but it&#39;s better than nothing!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Thank you, Kadoc! Moreover, the one over there...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Moreover, the one over there...</p><p><strong>Tiamat:</strong><br> Mother.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Huh?</p><p><strong>Tiamat:</strong><br> Mother.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Uhm...</p><p><strong>Tiamat:</strong><br> Long time no see, Mash. Mother has come to help Chaldea out of trouble.</p><p><strong>Tiamat:</strong><br> An old enemy turning into an ally must be quite the unexpected development, no? Bolstering your odds, I guess one could call it.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> It&#39;s pretty common, actually.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Happens all the time.</p><hr><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> (All the jokes aside, Tiamat is here to help Chaldea out of a crisis?)</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> (Going by the records of the Seventh Singularity, you&#39;d expect nothing less than her holding a grudge, to say the least...)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Uhm...</p><p><strong>Tiamat:</strong><br> Hmph. Typical Chaldea. Have you no concept of principle? You&#39;re too slovenly.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Is that...Tiamat? The Tiamat we fought in the seventh Singularity? That Tiamat...?</p><p><strong>Tiamat:</strong><br> Mash, watch yourself!</p><p><strong>Tiamat:</strong><br> There is much to talk about, but right now we must deal with the Demon Beast Incarnadines.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> S-sorry!

I&#39;ll immolate you!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Even Jeanne Alter...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> They&#39;re all here to defeat a Beast?</p><hr><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Guh...!?</p><hr><p><strong>Jeanne\xA0Alter?:</strong></p><p><strong>Draco:</strong><br> No point in trying. You cannot converse with them.</p><p><strong>Draco:</strong><br> They are mere shadows. A reenactment of a battle already passed\u2014a refrain.</p><p><strong>Draco:</strong><br> If it&#39;s for the sake of a dying Beast, shadows are more than sufficient. It is a case of bad taste without rival.</p><p><strong>Draco:</strong><br> Moreover, regard yourself. Should you not take this seriously, you will most likely simply...die.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> We&#39;re surrounded...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> So much bloodlust...!</p><hr><p><strong>Draco:</strong><br> They approach! Summon your Servants!</p><p><strong>Jeanne\xA0d&#39;Arc?:</strong><br> \u2014!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Draco:</strong><br> You have done well in making it thus far. Fine work, indeed.</p><p><strong>Draco:</strong><br> What? Your expression tells me you still do not realize why I have refrained from attacking you myself. How dull can you be?</p><p><strong>Draco:</strong><br> Look. Focus your senses. Truly feel it. Realize just what fate you are bound by.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ... (Focus your consciousness)</p><hr><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> This means...!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I&#39;m connected to Draco!</p><hr><p><strong>Draco:</strong><br> Ahahahaha! And so the last horse finally crosses the finish line! Well, you know how the classic line goes!</p><p><strong>Draco:</strong><br> \u2014I answer you. You are this Beast&#39;s Master.</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Draco:</strong><br> You and I were joined in a contract at the time of your abduction from Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Draco:</strong><br> And so, you are currently a Master with a Beast-class Servant at their disposal.</p><p><strong>Draco:</strong><br> To forge a contract with a Beast, even one reduced to a mere Alter Ego...</p><p><strong>Draco:</strong><br> You are quite something, are you not? Well, I guess humanity&#39;s final Master should be able to achieve as much! Hehe...ahahahahaha!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You just did that on your own!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> So why did you abduct me...?</p><hr><p><strong>Draco:</strong><br> Thanks to you, I was barely able to cling to life... Your magical energy was just enough to sustain me.</p><p><strong>Draco:</strong><br> However, it will not suffice. This is a temporary contract, so to speak.</p><p><strong>Draco:</strong><br> I require more energy from you. Should you indulge me, I can evict the Heroic Spirits gathering here.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Nobody asked for that...!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> And you think this helps me...?</p><hr><p><strong>Draco:</strong><br> You have no choice. As my contractor, they will hunt you, as well.</p><p><strong>Draco:</strong><br> What support you received from Chaldea has gone; your summons will only take you so far. Your only means of survival is to command this Beast of yours.</p><p><strong>Draco:</strong><br> Oh\u2014and attempting to kill me would prove pointless. You are the Master of a Beast, recognized as part of the Evils of Humanity by the Heroic Spirits.</p><p><strong>Draco:</strong><br> The ones gathered here act purely on instinct. Even should I vanish, they shall continue to fight until they strike down the root of evil\u2014you.</p><p><strong>Draco:</strong><br> Tch. We dawdled for too long, and now the second batch has turned up. Furthermore\u2014</p><p><strong>Boudica?:</strong><br> \u2014</p><p><strong>Draco:</strong><br> Boudica...</p><p><strong>Boudica?:</strong><br> Looks like it. I was your enemy once upon a time, but some things happened and, well, y&#39;know. Now, take a look.</p><p><strong>Boudica?:</strong><br> The greatest allied army in history awaits your command, and so do the generals leading it!</p><p><strong>Caesar?:</strong><br> Hah hah hah hah! Julius Caesar has come to conquer! Rejoice, all of you!</p><p><strong>Caligula?:</strong><br> Ooooooooh...!! Rome...immortal...Demon Beast Incarnadine...DESTROY...!</p><p><strong>Caligula?:</strong><br> DESTROOOOOOY!!</p><p><strong>Draco:</strong><br> Uncle... And Caesar, too.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Everyone from the Second Singularity...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Even the Roman Army!</p><hr><p><strong>Caesar?:</strong><br> And we are not alone! O Heroic Spirits who have devoted yourselves to the training of the Divine Ancestor!</p><p><strong>Caesar?:</strong><br> Come forth!</p><p><strong>Leonidas\xA0I?:</strong><br> Nwaaaaaaaaaah! My body is rejuvenated through the strength of your war cries!</p><p><strong>Leonidas\xA0I?:</strong><br> Lancer, Leonidas I! Reporting for duty!</p><p><strong>Draco:</strong><br> Guh...! My head is splitting... This is unbearable...!</p><p><strong>Draco:</strong><br> Alliance and Imperial soldiers alike are pouring in. Will you be able to survive on your own?</p><p><strong>Draco:</strong><br> I would prefer you managed to avoid death. We are in this together, after all...!</p><p><strong>Roman\xA0Army:</strong><br> UUUUUUUURAAAAAAH! HAIL THE DIVINE ANCESTOR! HAIL THE EMPEROR!</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> We just barely got away somehow...!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> But there&#39;s too many of them!</p><hr><p><strong>Draco:</strong><br> Barely, indeed... Needless to say, your fortune is not about to turn for the better.</p><p><strong>Draco:</strong><br> As I said, you have no choice but to have me fight. You must make a decision.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Seems like you&#39;re right, Draco...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> If this keeps up...</p><hr><p><strong>Draco:</strong><br> ...!? Fujimaru!</p><p><strong>Altera?:</strong><br> \u2014</p><p><strong>El-Melloi\xA0II?:</strong><br> This power is the same as the thing that caused my apprentice to lose control of her Holy Lance...</p><p><strong>El-Melloi\xA0II?:</strong><br> Certainly, you&#39;ve endured it well.</p><p><strong>Altera?:</strong><br> Rome has spoken. All of you are good civilization.</p><p><strong>Altera?:</strong><br> And <img src="https://i.imgur.com/XAqlQYL.png" alt="berserk1">. Emperor <img src="https://i.imgur.com/XAqlQYL.png" alt="berserk1">. You...</p><p><strong>Altera?:</strong><br> Because you were kind to me under that distant sky...</p><p><strong>Altera?:</strong><br> This time, I shall protect... The me here and now shall destroy the Demon Beast Incarnadine.</p><p><strong>Draco:</strong><br> Ggh...!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Draco!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> You protected me!?</p><hr><p><strong>Draco:</strong><br> Guh...! What...is the matter with you...!?</p><p><strong>Draco:</strong><br> You...are not someone who should meet their end here!</p><p><strong>Draco:</strong><br> Are you truly a Master of Chaldea, then\u2014take one of the Beasts as your mount.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...!</p><hr><p><strong>Draco:</strong><br> \u2014Fujimaru!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> \u2014By my Command Spell, I order you!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Rise, Draco!</p><hr><p><strong>Draco:</strong><br> Hehehe....! Hahahahahahahhahaha!</p><p><strong>Draco:</strong><br> That you would go so far as to exhaust a Command Spell! But lo and behold! Fujimaru!</p><p><strong>Draco:</strong><br> Come, a feast awaits! A terrible platter of rotten food, but I shall not demand extravagance here!</p><p><strong>Draco:</strong><br> The devourer of cities, Draco! I shall swallow it all!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Draco:</strong><br> Phew...my migraine has died down. I feel a little better now.</p><p><strong>Draco:</strong><br> Now then, let me introduce myself once more.</p><p><strong>Draco:</strong><br> My name is Draco, the Beast of Sodom. My class\u2014is Beast.</p><p><strong>Draco:</strong><br> For now, I am your Servant. Do take care of me\u2014Master?</p><p><strong>Draco:</strong><br> Heh heh. Don&#39;t look so upset. It&#39;s unbecoming.</p><p><strong>Draco:</strong><br> I may be a tyrant, but I am a magnanimous one. If you have something to say, I will listen.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> What exactly are you going to do...?</p><p><strong>Draco:</strong><br> Hmm. Well, that is the quandary. What should I do?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Thanks, I guess.</p><p><strong>Draco:</strong><br> Heh...there&#39;s no need for thanks. This is just how a Master and Servant work together, isn&#39;t it?</p><p><strong>Draco:</strong><br> But your consideration is commendable. I may be the Beast of Depravity, but I appreciate your honesty. Let us continue to work in good faith.</p><hr><p><strong>Draco:</strong><br> Thanks to you, I have recovered enough to be able to fight. But we&#39;re not out of danger yet.</p><p><strong>Draco:</strong><br> This body is still a larval one. And it&#39;s still a bit troublesome to deal with all the Heroic Spirits here while I&#39;m still recovering.</p><p><strong>Draco:</strong></p><p>...How cheap.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Draco:</strong><br> Do not stare at me so. That expression disgusts me.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> And you were acting so cocky...</p><p><strong>Draco:</strong><br> It&#39;s no boast...</p><p><strong>Draco:</strong><br> Had I the true form of the Beast, I would devour this entire area and everything in it.</p><p><strong>Draco:</strong><br> My defeat was by Chaldea&#39;s hands\u2014not to these mere shadows of history.</p><hr><p><strong>Draco:</strong><br> Anyway! Now we break through the enemy&#39;s encirclement. This is where the real work begins, so get ready.</p><p><strong>Draco:</strong><br> After all, life-or-death battles are your stock in trade, aren&#39;t they? I look forward to seeing what you can accomplish, contractor.</p><h2 id="section-2-you-are-the-beast-on-the-battlefield-1-2" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2-you-are-the-beast-on-the-battlefield-1-2" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 2: You are the Beast on the Battlefield (1/2)</h2><p><strong>Drake?:</strong><br> Gold! Riches! I can&#39;t very well ignore those now, can I?</p><p><strong>Drake?:</strong><br> In all ages and cultures, such straightforward treasures have always been pillaged.</p><p><strong>Drake?:</strong><br> In other words, this is our fort\xE9. You&#39;re gonna have to hand it all over, your life included, got it?</p><p><strong>Drake?:</strong><br> I am fully aware of how impudent I&#39;m being here, having just arrived and all. But it is what it is, no? After all, we&#39;re pirates!</p><p><strong>Blackbeard?:</strong><br> Alright, boyos! Keep pace with the hag\u2013 Drake&#39;s ship!</p><p><strong>Blackbeard?:</strong><br> Bold of you to steal a pirate&#39;s treasure! I don&#39;t care whether you&#39;re a demonic beast or a devil\u2013</p><p><strong>Blackbeard?:</strong><br> Go and regret in hell ever having laid hands on this great pirate Blackbeard&#39;s treasure!</p><p><strong>Drake?:</strong><br> Well, well, looks like that oaf&#39;s all fired up! Listen up, boys, don&#39;t you dare fall behind!</p><p><strong>Drake?:</strong><br> If we end up crashing and burning before him, you lot are gonna be scrubbing the head in hell for a lifetime!</p><p><strong>Drake?:</strong><br> Cannons on the ready, Golden Hind!</p><p><strong>Blackbeard?:</strong><br> Prep those cannons, Queen Anne&#39;s Revenge!</p><p><strong>Both:</strong><br> Fireeeeeeee\u2014!!!</p><p><strong>Draco:</strong><br> You dare fire on me!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> The false Demon God Pillar!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> What were they called? Demon Beast Incarnadines!</p><hr><p><strong>Draco:</strong><br> It merely appears that way! It&#39;s nothing but an imitation devoid of soul! But\u2014</p><p><strong>Draco:</strong><br> It still has solid substance! Hit it!</p><p><strong>Blackbeard?:</strong><br> Owieeee!</p><p><strong>Atalante?:</strong><br> Steer properly! We just rammed that pillar of flesh!</p><p><strong>Blackbeard?:</strong><br> Fine, fine! Cat-ears here has a rough way of treating her captain!</p><p><strong>Draco:</strong><br> We&#39;ll board them from here!</p><p><strong>Draco:</strong><br> Part of being a Beast is an insatiable hunger for riches. However, I am also a statesmen. Consequently...</p><p><strong>Draco:</strong><br> I will make an impromptu ruling. Piracy is to be punished with the hangman&#39;s noose!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Draco:</strong><br> The successive battles are taking their toll... Looks like you&#39;re getting winded.</p><p><strong>Draco:</strong><br> Fortunately, this is an open area with no shortage of places to hide. Recover what magical energy you can.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Still, if this continues, we&#39;re going to be in trouble...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> We&#39;ve broken through, but what do we do now?</p><hr><p><strong>Draco:</strong><br> We have to get out of this space somehow, but the exact method still eludes me.</p><p><strong>Draco:</strong><br> I was already beaten long ago. I struggled pathetically, and only made it this far by clinging to the thread of your existence.</p><p><strong>Draco:</strong><br> Ever since, I&#39;ve been ad-libbing without a script. For now, we just keep up this pointless struggle.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> If this is a Singularity, then there has to be a Grail.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> If we can get that, then</p><hr><p><strong>Draco:</strong><br> Are you referring to this? Well, that&#39;s too bad.</p><p><strong>Draco:</strong><br> Your understanding is not exactly wrong, but not correct either.</p><p><strong>Draco:</strong><br> This is a world I created. A Testament World imitating the Incineration of the Human Order by Beast I.</p><p><strong>Draco:</strong><br> In this space, I recreated the seven Singularities and drew in the Chaldeas of many parallel worlds.</p><p><strong>Draco:</strong><br> And as Sodom&#39;s Beast, I drunk deep from the Holy Grail brimming with their collected \u201Cwishes\u201D.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> The Chaldeas of parallel universes...</p><p><strong>Draco:</strong><br> Yes, that&#39;s right. My Authority is that of Nega-Messiah. The one who scorns, kills, and devours saviours.</p><p><strong>Draco:</strong><br> The Chaldea who defeated Beast I in this world. Its Master. The victors of many other worlds.</p><p><strong>Draco:</strong><br> The only \u201Cdesires\u201D potent enough to nurture my horns are the wishes to save the world.</p><p><strong>Draco:</strong><br> That is why this Singularity exists. That is the reason for this Holy Grail War. Your battles were most delectable.</p><p><strong>Draco:</strong><br> All Chaldeas and Masters fought splendidly, enough to sate my appetite. You should be proud.</p><p><strong>Draco:</strong><br> And finally, the last one falls into my maw. You bare your fangs, stepping over the husks of so many other Chaldeas.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Imitating the Incineration of the Human Order?</p><p><strong>Draco:</strong><br> Yes, that&#39;s right. My Authority is that of Nega-Messiah. The one who scorns, kills, and devours the Saviour.</p><p><strong>Draco:</strong><br> The only \u201Cdesires\u201D potent enough to nurture my horns are the wishes to save the world.</p><p><strong>Draco:</strong><br> Therefore, I imitated you, and your battle against Beast I.</p><p><strong>Draco:</strong><br> The countless Holy Grail Wars waged by versions of you \u201CChaldeans\u201D in this Testament World\u2014</p><p><strong>Draco:</strong><br> But this little arcade is wholly based on you and the Chaldea you come from. Be proud of that.</p><p><strong>Draco:</strong><br> Yet in the last scene of the climax, I was struck by the Deus ex Machina. Hence my current pathetic state.</p><hr><p><strong>Draco:</strong><br> I was laid low by Chaldea and lost my Authority as a Beast. Unfortunately, I no longer possess the Grail.</p><p><strong>Draco:</strong><br> The thing I hold in my hands will no longer grant wishes. It&#39;s nothing now but an empty chalice.</p><p><strong>Draco:</strong><br> This place is no longer a theatre or a dining hall. It is the twisted, distorted corpse of the Testament World.</p><p><strong>Draco:</strong><br> A garden where Heroic Spirits hunt down a Beast\u2014A square for a public execution.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> (Stare at Draco)</p><p><strong>Draco:</strong><br> I like the look in your eyes. Correct. I wholly deserve to be hunted.</p><p><strong>Draco:</strong><br> But it cannot end here. I will once again rebloom into the form of Sodom&#39;s Beast.</p><p><strong>Draco:</strong><br> And you will be at my side when I do\u2014but fear not. I will be sure to devour you whole.</p><p><strong>Draco:</strong><br> After all, I have to give due respect to the source material.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> (Brood over that)</p><p><strong>Draco:</strong><br> Does it make you think? Then allow me to offer a suggestion.</p><p><strong>Draco:</strong><br> Regarding the Grail\u2014this Testament World may be broken, but so long as it retains its form, it still serves as a source of magical energy.</p><p><strong>Draco:</strong><br> That holds true whether this is a Singularity or a Testament World. Therefore, someone besides me holds the Holy Grail.</p><p><strong>Draco:</strong><br> I suppose that&#39;s only natural. Perhaps it&#39;s one of the Heroic Spirits here to slay me. Either way the result is the same.</p><p><strong>Draco:</strong><br> You and I must make successive offerings of the Heroic Spirits, and take back the Holy Grail together. Hehe, I&#39;ll be relying on you.</p><p><strong>Draco:</strong><br> Do put your best foot forward for me. If you do well, I may see fit to grant you the Grail when this is over.</p><p><strong>Draco:</strong><br> My subjects are justly rewarded for their efforts, as I am a benevolent tyrant.</p><hr><p><strong>Draco:</strong><br> Does it anger you? Or perhaps I frighten you? Worry not, for I am your Servant. Your fangs.</p><p><strong>Draco:</strong><br> Whatever threats there may be, I vow to protect you from them. I may be a ferocious Beast, but I am also a noble one, no?</p><p><strong>Draco:</strong><br> Now let us go together, my Master\u2014until the time when I rebloom into an Evil of Humanity.</p><p><strong>Draco:</strong><br> Time to go. We should avoid any unnecessary combat, but we may have to force our way through. I will let you decide.</p><p><strong>Draco:</strong><br> At least if you have a hand to progress with... No, it&#39;s nothing. Let&#39;s go.</p><h2 id="section-2-you-are-the-beast-on-the-battlefield-2-2" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2-you-are-the-beast-on-the-battlefield-2-2" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 2: You are the Beast on the Battlefield (2/2)</h2><p><strong>Draco:</strong><br> Hah...hah...hah...

They probably won&#39;t be able to catch up with us for a time.</p><p><strong>Draco:</strong><br> We have to find a way up and out of this area while we still can\u2014</p><p><strong>B\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Nope, not happening. You&#39;re going down here.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> They&#39;ve caught up...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Doesn&#39;t he look kind of familiar?</p><hr><p><strong>Draco:</strong><br> You...</p><p><strong>B\uFF1A???:</strong><br> What...? That&#39;s harsh, I&#39;m not a kid, y&#39;know.</p><p><strong>B\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Welp, we&#39;re just doin&#39; our job.

You&#39;re not that much older, ya know!</p><p><strong>B\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Actually... You&#39;re a teenager, aren&#39;t you?</p><p><strong>B\uFF1A???:</strong><br> No, you feel a little older. What exactly is your age?</p><p><strong>Draco:</strong><br> Boy... Where did you come from? You&#39;re not one of the shades here.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Really?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> He definitely feels different from the others...</p><hr><p><strong>B\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Calling me a kid again...but you&#39;re right. Well, if you get that, then you should know the answer, eh?</p><p><strong>B\uFF1A???:</strong><br> I am Setanta! Servant of Chaldea!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You&#39;re from Chaldea?</p><p><strong>Setanta:</strong><br> Not yours, but a different one. Weren&#39;t you told that?</p><p><strong>Setanta:</strong><br> I&#39;m a Servant summoned by another Chaldea. Good to meet you, other Master!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Wait, wasn&#39;t Setanta...</p><p><strong>Setanta:</strong><br> Well, you probably know me better as C\xFA Chulainn...</p><p><strong>Setanta:</strong><br> Though it&#39;s a bit early for me to be the \u201CHound of Culann\u201D or \u201CThe great hero of Ulster\u201D.</p><p><strong>Setanta:</strong><br> So right now I&#39;m just plain old Setanta!</p><hr><p><strong>Draco:</strong><br> Setanta...the childhood name of C\xFA Chulainn, was it?</p><p><strong>Draco:</strong><br> There was indeed a Servant by that name in the past.</p><p><strong>Draco:</strong><br> But I do not understand. Your Chaldea has already bested my attempt to destroy the Human Order.</p><p><strong>Draco:</strong><br> This broken Testament World should have no connection to your Chaldea. How are you here?</p><p><strong>Setanta:</strong><br> Yeah, about that...</p><p><strong>Tiamat:</strong><br> You may be able to escape the children, but there is no escaping your mother!</p><p><strong>Tiamat:</strong><br> Beast II is here to punish Beast VI! Don&#39;t make a scene, now!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Alter Ego Tiamat!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> From back when Chaldea was attacked!</p><hr><p><strong>Tiamat:</strong><br> Fujimaru! Oh thank goodness you&#39;re safe. Mother is so relieved.</p><p><strong>Tiamat:</strong><br> Just be a little more patient. I will fix everything by defeating the evil Beast.</p><p><strong>Tiamat:</strong><br> Come, Setanta, my rambunctious child. Do your best with Mother.</p><p><strong>Setanta:</strong><br> I just got caught up in this! She forced me to come along!</p><p><strong>Tiamat:</strong><br> Aww, my child is all raring to go right, even against a Beast! Mother is so proud of you~.</p><p><strong>Setanta:</strong><br> I&#39;m mad at you! And I don&#39;t remember ever being brought up by you at all!</p><p><strong>Tiamat:</strong><br> Oh boo, he&#39;s at his rebellious age. But all children go through this, after all, so I won&#39;t get mad at you.</p><p><strong>Draco:</strong><br> You&#39;re a former Beast, but you just do whatever you want, don&#39;t you...?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Eh?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Are you really one to talk?</p><hr><p><strong>Draco:</strong><br> Of course.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> \u2013Beautiful eyes with no hesitation in them.</p><hr><p><strong>Setanta:</strong><br> I actually don&#39;t have a problem with it. She may be weakened, but your partner there is still a Beast.</p><p><strong>Setanta:</strong><br> It&#39;s a Heroic Spirit&#39;s duty to slay them. I&#39;m gonna have to take her head.</p><p><strong>Tiamat:</strong><br> Hurry up and come here, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Tiamat:</strong><br> Just leave everything to Mother.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> But I&#39;m contracted to Draco...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Taking Draco out won&#39;t fix things here.</p><hr><p><strong>Tiamat:</strong><br> It&#39;s true... This child does not carry the Grail.</p><p><strong>Tiamat:</strong><br> Defeating Beast VI now will not bring this world to its end. So long as the contractor lives, her resurrection is a possibility.</p><p><strong>Tiamat:</strong><br> Fujimaru will continue to be a target. Mmrgh...</p><p><strong>Tiamat:</strong><br> But don&#39;t worry.

It was actually pretty good training.</p><p><strong>B\uFF1ASetanta:</strong><br> I said I wasn&#39;t going to let the Beast get away from me.

If you want to save Master, then you have no choice but to assist me.</p><p><strong>I\uFF1ASetanta:</strong><br> ...You&#39;re still on about that?</p><p><strong>Draco:</strong><br> Just listen. You too, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Draco:</strong><br> As you are aware, Fujimaru and myself are currently bound by contract.</p><p><strong>Draco:</strong><br> So long as you are contracted to a Beast, the Heroic Spirits gathered in this Testament World will keep coming after you.</p><p><strong>Draco:</strong><br> But\u2014I am willing to break this contract.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> !?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> What do you mean?</p><hr><p><strong>I\uFF1ASetanta:</strong><br> You can do that? Then hurry up and get on with it!</p><p><strong>Draco:</strong><br> I told you to listen. Don&#39;t make me repeat myself... you&#39;re giving me a migraine.</p><p><strong>Draco:</strong><br> This contract is a rather special one. If anything, it is closer to a curse. Right now, we are bound to each other.</p><p><strong>Draco:</strong><br> I cannot break it of my own volition\u2013at least, not if things remain as they are.</p><p><strong>I\uFF1ASetanta:</strong><br> What is that supposed to mean...?</p><p><strong>Draco:</strong><br> It would require a Beast&#39;s special trait of Independent Manifestation. After all, a Beast is essentially something that can manifest itself without support.</p><p><strong>Draco:</strong><br> I can sever our contract through use of this power. Not a bad idea, if I do say so myself.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> But in order to do that...</p><hr><p><strong>Draco:</strong><br> Indeed. I would have to regain my power as a Beast.</p><p><strong>I\uFF1ASetanta:</strong><br> So we&#39;re right back to square one!</p><p><strong>Draco:</strong><br> How can you say that? My objective is clear now. This is the most amount of progress so far.</p><p><strong>Draco:</strong><br> When I once again awaken as Sodom&#39;s Beast, there will be nothing more to bind us together.</p><p><strong>Draco:</strong><br> All that will be left is for the two of us to settle our differences. I planned to devour [\u2642 him /\u2640\uFE0F her] from the start anyway.</p><p><strong>I\uFF1ASetanta:</strong><br> This is a load of bull... You&#39;ve been manipulating us from the start, haven&#39;t you?</p><p><strong>I\uFF1ASetanta:</strong><br> Master...if you&#39;re all right with it, I can end this right here and now.</p><p><strong>Locusta:</strong><br> Haah? There&#39;s no way I&#39;ll let you do that.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Stand down, Setanta.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> We&#39;re not going to fight here.</p><hr><p><strong>I\uFF1ASetanta:</strong><br> ...You&#39;re really going to just go along with what a Beast says? There&#39;s no way we can be sure she won&#39;t stab us in the back.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Maybe, but...</p><hr><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I don&#39;t think Draco will break her word.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> She&#39;s got a strong sense of responsibility.</p><hr><p><strong>Draco:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Setanta:</strong><br> (I don&#39;t get it... She&#39;s definitely serious about keeping Master safe.)</p><p><strong>Setanta:</strong><br> (But shouldn&#39;t that be obvious, since she&#39;s getting all her magical energy from [\u2642 him /\u2640\uFE0F her] anyway...?)</p><p><strong>Setanta:</strong><br> (And yet...she&#39;s somehow acting like a respectable Servant\u2014)</p><p><strong>Setanta:</strong><br> (Sigh)</p><p><strong>Setanta:</strong><br> Trusting anyone you come across, hero or antihero... You really are just like that other Master.</p><p><strong>Setanta:</strong><br> You&#39;re gonna get burned by that one day.</p><p><strong>Setanta:</strong><br> Well, I&#39;ll follow your lead here, Master.</p><p><strong>Setanta:</strong><br> I may be from another Chaldea, but I&#39;m your Servant now.

My Class is Assassin. In life, I was a poisoner in the service of Emperor Nero!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> A poisoner...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> And in the service of Nero...</p><hr><p><strong>Draco:</strong><br> You can hardly imagine that from the Nero Claudius you know, yes. But she speaks the truth. The royal court is dyed in conspiracies.</p><p><strong>Draco:</strong><br> Many such enemies were killed.</p><p><strong>Draco:</strong><br> The splendorous life of the Emperor was, in fact, colored by blood and poison.</p><p><strong>Draco:</strong><br> Locusta served me well. I can hardly claim to know anyone who befits the image of a poisoner more than she.</p><p><strong>Locusta:</strong><br> Woo-hoo! The Princeps has praised me... I am awash with delight!</p><p><strong>Locusta:</strong><br> So as long as you remain the Master of Emperor Nero, I shall serve you with all my being! I look forward to doing so!</p><p><strong>Setanta:</strong><br> About that obsession with mushrooms, though...</p><p><strong>Draco:</strong><br> Oh...that would be because mushrooms are a favorite food of mine. I&#39;ll have you know they are a divine delicacy.</p><p><strong>Draco:</strong><br> Well, my foster father\u2014the late Emperor Claudius wasn&#39;t too fond of them. Haha.</p><p><strong>Locusta=spot:</strong><br> E-hee-hee-he...</p><p><strong>E\uFF1ASetanta:</strong><br> Wasn&#39;t too fond of &#39;em, huh... Give me a break, such wiles aren&#39;t really my thing.</p><p><strong>E\uFF1ASetanta:</strong><br> ...Never mind. More importantly, we should discuss what comes next.</p><p><strong>E\uFF1ASetanta=spot:</strong><br> You say you&#39;ll revert to your true form as a Beast, but how exactly are you planning on doing that?</p><p><strong>F\uFF1ADraco:</strong><br> Oh, that&#39;s what this journey is all about.</p><p><strong>F\uFF1ADraco=spot:</strong><br> We will traverse the seven Simulated Singularities piled up in a spiral\u2014this Spiral Testament World\u2014and recover the Demon Beast Incarnadines.</p><p><strong>E\uFF1ASetanta=spot:</strong><br> Demon Beast Incarnadines? Weren&#39;t you using them in battle?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> It was only appearing that way...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> That&#39;s what she said, along those lines.</p><hr><p><strong>F\uFF1ADraco:</strong><br> The Demon Beast Incarnadines I wield in battle now are merely husks lacking any essence.</p><p><strong>F\uFF1ADraco:</strong><br> The real Incarnadines were sealed within the seven Simulated Singularities, right after they snatched you from Chaldea.</p><p><strong>F\uFF1ADraco:</strong><br> The seven-headed, ten-horned beast described in the Apocalypse is none other than I. And the Incarnadines themselves are the heads of Sodom&#39;s Beast.</p><p><strong>F\uFF1ADraco:</strong><br> The release of the Demon Beast Incarnadines is necessary for me to rebloom into Sodom&#39;s Beast.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> And these Demon Beast Incarnadines are sealed?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Who the heck did that?</p><hr><p><strong>F\uFF1ADraco:</strong><br> Needless to say, it&#39;s the handiwork of the Heroic Spirits summoned to hunt me. However, they are no mere shadows like what we encountered earlier.</p><p><strong>F\uFF1ADraco:</strong><br> They are the Servants who guard the seals of the Demon Beast Incarnadines, the ones who lord over each floor of the Simulated Singularities.</p><p><strong>F\uFF1ADraco=spot:</strong><br> Well... I suppose we ought to call them Floor Guardians.</p><p><strong>E\uFF1ASetanta=spot:</strong><br> So you want us to beat them and free the Demon Beast Incarnadines? I&#39;m not really feeling it... but I guess we&#39;ve got no other choice.</p><p><strong>F\uFF1ADraco:</strong><br> Right now, the Ladder is pointing us to the Seventh Imitation Singularity.</p><p><strong>F\uFF1ADraco:</strong><br> From your perspective, Fujimaru, we&#39;d be travelling the seven Singularities in reverse.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> From the Seventh Singularity\u2014</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> So we&#39;re repeating the battle from Babylonia...</p><hr><p><strong>F\uFF1ADraco:</strong><br> The Seventh Imitation Singularity is different from the one you&#39;re familiar with. As if I&#39;d ever let another Beast manifest.</p><p><strong>F\uFF1ADraco:</strong><br> The Seventh Imitation Singularity is\u2014the Golden City of Babylon. A supercivilization that has reached the zenith of its splendour, one unlike any other in human history.</p><p><strong>F\uFF1ADraco:</strong><br> In which case, the Floor Guardian would be the King of Babylon\u2014Nebuchadnezzar II.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Nebuchadnezzar II?</p><p><strong>F\uFF1ADraco:</strong><br> He was the King of Babylon sometime around 7th century BC, and\u2014someone who does not exist in 27th century BC.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> He&#39;s the one from the Babylonian captivity, right?</p><p><strong>F\uFF1ADraco:</strong><br> So you DO know a little of him. Indeed, he was the King of Babylon during the 7th century BC.</p><p><strong>F\uFF1ADraco:</strong><br> He&#39;s someone who&#39;s not supposed to exist in the 27th century BC\u2014in the Seventh Singularity, that is.</p><hr><p><strong>F\uFF1ADraco:</strong><br> He is the result of Nebuchadnezzar II&#39;s soul being implanted into a clone of the King of Heroes, Gilgamesh.</p><p><strong>F\uFF1ADraco:</strong><br> He truly is the Super Babylonian Uruk. That&#39;s the true nature of Nebuchadnezzar II.</p><p><strong>F\uFF1ADraco:</strong><br> And he&#39;s also the consort of yours truly, Bewitching Queen Draco.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Super...Babylonian?</p><p><strong>F\uFF1ADraco:</strong><br> Needless to say, he&#39;s produced by yours truly. Babylon is a Singularity I built with my own hands.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Husband!?</p><p><strong>F\uFF1ADraco:</strong><br> Well, more of a sham marriage. The Seventh Singularity was one I produced with my own hands.</p><hr><p><strong>F\uFF1ADraco:</strong><br> And it was by Nebuchadnezzar II&#39;s hands that it turned into a golden city, overflowing with greed.</p><p><strong>F\uFF1ADraco:</strong><br> You would do well to enjoy it. This fruit worthy of a platter on my table, that is.</p><p><strong>F\uFF1ADraco:</strong><br> This city which stands peerless in human history at the zenith of its prosperity.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> The zenith of its prosperity...</p><p><strong>F\uFF1ADraco:</strong><br> That&#39;s right.

We&#39;ve still got a long way to go.</p><p><strong>Draco:</strong><br> The Sixth Imitation Singularity is our next destination. In which case, the sealed Demon Beast Incarnadine would be\u2014Ira.</p><p><strong>Draco:</strong><br> It&#39;s the Demon Beast Incarnadine that imitates the Gazing Death Star, Allocer.</p><p><strong>Draco:</strong><br> Take care now. The Seventh Singularity was... well, you witnessed it yourselves. But we&#39;re in for a harsh journey in the Sixth Singularity.</p><p><strong>Draco:</strong><br> The Sixth Imitation Singularity is a pilgrimage of death that leads to the Holy Land\u2014the lost Holy City that is now but a grave.</p><p><strong>Draco:</strong><br> \u2014Lost Jerusalem.</p><h2 id="section-6-festival-of-cravings-expedition-lost-jerusalem" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-6-festival-of-cravings-expedition-lost-jerusalem" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 6: Festival of Cravings Expedition: Lost Jerusalem</h2><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> That which was familiar and that which has become commonplace, lying side by side.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> The coldness of it makes one shudder.

They number a mountain of corpses.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> The mounds stacked repeatedly with untimely ends, deaths gone unattended, deaths, and even more deaths.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Mine is one of them. To have come so far and be put to death with no kind of resistance.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I fear the sizzling pain. I fear the feeling of being lost.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I fear becoming just another of those corpses. I fear dying a meaningless death.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> At the bottom of a desolate limbo\u2014 and in nobody&#39;s care.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> A dream...</p><hr><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> And again...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> my Command Spells are burning.</p><hr><p><strong>Draco:</strong><br> ...Are you awake?</p><p><strong>Draco:</strong><br> The Sixth Imitation Singularity is close.

Get your food oooon!</p><p><strong>Setanta:</strong><br> Ain&#39;t nothing but mushrooms... Yeah, save your breath. I know the gag.</p><p><strong>Draco:</strong><br> Frolick in moderation. We are soon to arrive at the Sixth Imitation Singularity.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> The Sixth Singularity\u2014</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Ruled by the Lion King, in my version.</p><hr><p><strong>Draco:</strong><br> In the Sixth Imitation Singularity, the Knights of the Round Table had no means to interfere.</p><p><strong>Draco:</strong><br> Instead, the Holy City is ruled by the last grand master of the Knights Templar\u2014Jacques de Molay.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Jacques de Molay is, um...?</p><p><strong>Draco:</strong><br> Yes, a man worth pitying. His disgrace unjustified and faith unrequited.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I think Black Magic figured in somewhere...</p><p><strong>Draco:</strong><br> Ah, you know him well. A pitiful man falsely charged with heresies and burnt at the stake for them.</p><hr><p><strong>Draco:</strong><br> The Knights Templar were a military order charged with the mission of protecting pilgrims to the Holy Land.</p><p><strong>Draco:</strong><br> Their influence spread throughout Europe while possessing wealth on par with a country. They must thusly have been subject to great envy.</p><p><strong>Draco:</strong><br> For what purpose was he defeated as a knight, besmirched as a priest, and deposed as a grand master?</p><p><strong>Draco:</strong><br> The hell that such a man produced in the Sixth Singularity had, I shall say, an adequate taste.</p><p><strong>Draco:</strong><br> I would not call the design by which he painted the blood-splattered pilgrim&#39;s road with reverent prayer inferior to the Lion King&#39;s Holy Selection.</p><p><strong>Draco:</strong><br> Have you anything to say? Are you reminded once again that I am a wicked Beast\u2013</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Wait, Molay was a man?</p><p><strong>Draco:</strong><br> What are you talking about...? Ah, wait. I see what it is you mean.</p><p><strong>Draco:</strong><br> The emperor Nero was told of to later generations as a man. It&#39;s said that famed King of Knights lied about her own gender during her life.</p><p><strong>Draco:</strong><br> I am sure many such Servants must be recorded in Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Draco:</strong><br> So it is understandable how that would catch your attention. But make no mistake, Jacques de Molay is a man.</p><p><strong>Draco:</strong><br> And he is most likely the Floor Guardian for the Sixth Imitation Singularity.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Molay is the Floor Guardian?</p><p><strong>Draco:</strong><br> That should be the safe assumption. And this time, he&#39;s likely to be swinging a holy sword to fell the beast.</p><p><strong>Draco:</strong><br> Whilst offering pure prayers bordering the pathetic. All in order to find atonement for having raised a false Holy Grail.</p><p><strong>Draco:</strong><br> And from hereon, you and I shall be trampling on such dignified faith. Ahahahaha!</p><hr><p><strong>Locusta:</strong><br> Ladies and gentlemen, our craft has now arrived at the Sixth Imitation Singularity. Please take care not to forget your belongings upon departure!</p><p><strong>Locusta:</strong><br> Thank you for flying today with Twilight Ladder Airlines!</p><p><strong>Setanta:</strong><br> Stay behind me as much as you can, Master.</p><p><strong>Setanta:</strong><br> Leaving aside the matter of the Seventh Singularity... Truth is, the other Chaldea had a harsh go of it.</p><p><strong>Setanta:</strong><br> If this is the same Sixth Singularity as theirs\u2014it&#39;ll be a scene of carnage.</p><p><strong>Setanta:</strong><br> Not to mention, the enemies will be on all sides. Music to my ears... However much warrior&#39;s luck I have to spend.</p><p><strong>Draco:</strong><br> The Testament World slipped through my fingers, turning the Singularity into a field for hunting beasts.</p><p><strong>Draco:</strong><br> What we need to do is plain. Find and defeat the Floor Guardian in order to free the Demon Beast Incarnadine.</p><p><strong>Draco:</strong><br> Now come with me, Master. The time to return to hell is finally here.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> This is some sandstorm...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> We can&#39;t see a thing.</p><hr><p><strong>Setanta:</strong><br> Stay by me, master.

You must be babbling.</p><p><strong>Draco:</strong><br> After all, I know nothing of this. So rare and so strange an event never occurred in the other Chaldea.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I see...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> It must be peaceful...</p><hr><p><strong>Setanta:</strong><br> What kind of crap&#39;s going on in your Chaldea...?</p><p><strong>Locusta:</strong><br> Okay, but...what&#39;s the Master&#39;s crazy festival doing being held again in the Sixth Singularity to our critical acclaim?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I suppose it&#39;s Jacques de Molay&#39;s doing.</p><hr><p><strong>Draco:</strong><br> As we saw in the seventh, the Floor Guardian has the power to distort their Singularity. It makes sense.</p><p><strong>Draco:</strong><br> But there&#39;s another reason to assert that, is there not?</p><p><strong>Setanta:</strong><br> That&#39;s enough chit-chat. The enemy&#39;s here.</p><p><strong>Draco:</strong><br> Not exactly...Knights of the Pilgrimage Road, however hard I squint.</p><p><strong>Setanta:</strong><br> So they&#39;re pumpkins, huh...</p><p><strong>Setanta:</strong><br> Contrary to their looks, they&#39;re honest about being hostile.

What is happening in this Testament World?</p><p><strong>Draco:</strong><br> Fujimaru, you say this is the handiwork of Jacques de Molay, no?</p><p><strong>Draco:</strong><br> Why do you think so? What do you know?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> The Molay here is probably\u2014</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Not the Molay you&#39;re familiar with, Draco.</p><hr><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Hehehehe. This was inevitable. It was inevitable, right?</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Since I&#39;ve been summoned in this Saint Graph, I had no choice but to become an Innocent Monster, right?</p><p><strong>Molay:</strong><br> Witches ought to be like witches. Demons ought to be like demons. I need to spread this curse all over the world.</p><p><strong>Molay:</strong><br> For the Human Order&#39;s sake? The Beast? To hell with them.</p><p><strong>Molay:</strong><br> But was I really summoned for the Human Order&#39;s sake...? Doesn&#39;t sound right to me.</p><p><strong>Molay:</strong><br> Bon, d&#39;accord! This time around, there&#39;s something more to my liking than the Holy Grail!</p><p><strong>Molay:</strong><br> Demon Beast Incarnadine\u2014The Beast of the Apocalypse. Now that befits a demon, no?</p><p><strong>Draco:</strong><br> So she&#39;s an Innocent Monster\u2014a Jacques de Molay that manifested as a demon-worshipping witch?</p><p><strong>Setanta:</strong><br> They&#39;re messing around like it&#39;s Halloween and all... Isn&#39;t that in bad taste?</p><p><strong>Draco:</strong><br> Foreigners, their very existence is like a bad joke.</p><p><strong>Draco:</strong><br> We shouldn&#39;t take them seriously. But foolish as it may be, this is poor form indeed.</p><p><strong>Draco:</strong><br> Why was such a being summoned?

A Demon Beast Incarnadine is, after all, simply a part of me.</p><p><strong>F\uFF1AJack?:</strong><br> \u2014That&#39;s exactly it, Nero.</p><p><strong>Draco:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>F\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Nero...you&#39;re a beloved, part of me, my doll...</p><p><strong>Locusta:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Draco:</strong><br> Begone...

Maybe yes, maybe no.</p><p><strong>Setanta:</strong><br> Agh. I hate the way magi talk. So annoying.</p><p><strong>Lady\xA0Avalon:</strong><br> Not the Mage of Flowers.

The city built atop Septem Montes. Your place, Draco.</p><p><strong>Draco:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Lady\xA0Avalon:</strong><br> And we can be sure an Incarnadine will be awaiting for you there. Deep within you.

You, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Draco:</strong><br> You are the one who needs to be ready.

That story is of no worth.</p><p><strong>Draco:</strong><br> I see.

Rather like sealing a bond, don&#39;t you agree?</p><p><strong>Draco:</strong><br> That&#39;s right. This is my resting place, where Nero Claudius stabbed herself in the throat.</p><p><strong>Locusta:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Draco:</strong><br> It was a disgraceful end.</p><p><strong>Draco:</strong><br> Hearing impossible sounds of applause and clinging to impossible hopes for salvation, she died miserably, covered in blood and tears.</p><p><strong>Draco:</strong><br> Therefore, this scenery has to be the place.</p><p><strong>Draco:</strong><br> Is the Demon Beast Incarnadine trying to get under my skin, much like in London...?</p><p><strong>Draco:</strong><br> An insufferable trick, but no longer effective.

It was grueling hard.</p><p><strong>Locusta:</strong><br> You Celt muscleheads are always so inconsiderate.</p><p><strong>Tiamat:</strong><br> With Mother by your side, there is no enemy you can&#39;t take on. Hehe!</p><p><strong>Draco:</strong><br> The Demon Beast Incarnadines are ultimately parts of me. They are too predictable to be a threat.</p><p><strong>Draco:</strong><br> There is nothing left holding us to this unpleasant place.</p><p><strong>Draco:</strong><br> Let us move ahead. The next Singularity is the last, Orleans.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> But the Ladder...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> isn&#39;t here yet.</p><hr><p><strong>Draco:</strong><br> ...!?
