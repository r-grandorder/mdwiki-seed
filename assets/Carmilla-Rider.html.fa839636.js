In other words, this car itself is the Iron Maiden, according to Swimsuit Carmilla.&quot;Testarossa&quot; means &quot;red head&quot; in Italian, and it has nothing to do with the luxury sports car of the same name.Probably.</p><p>The torture device originally was not so much a physical item she carried around, but rather an illusion, and so its general concept doesn&#39;t change even after it transforms into something else entirely. The illusion that she freely manipulates simply got an extreme face-lift. That it would make the faces of the virgins to whom she is attracted twist in horror, that it would make others scream, and that once you...take it for a spin, nobody can get out, conceptually, this all remains the same.</p><p>No matter how beautiful and famous the noblewoman may appear, young ladies really, REALLY shouldn&#39;t get in her car. Their bodies and souls will be taken, and they&#39;ll never get out...

However, this is largely done to scatter bait and &quot;Ensure tonight&#39;s job will be a success&quot;.</p><p>At a glance, one can\u2019t feel the dangerous elements that the true \u201CBlood Countess\u201D possesses, so the thought gradually dissipates. However, this persona only works on a surface level. If you were to probe at her further, it would be relatively easy to reveal her true colors.

Halloween? Brave? Mecha? And even a Japanese gothic form!? Why does SHE get so many different versions!?</p><p>Taking a good hard look at her actual self and her, she saw there was no discussing it. One was clearly &quot;A bloody countess&quot;, and the other, &quot;A past self, transformed by the moon or something weird&quot;.</p><p>Maybe it was from watching her appear time and time ago, leaving herself to say &quot;You, again&quot;, but she refused to give up.</p><p>Summer was her chance.
