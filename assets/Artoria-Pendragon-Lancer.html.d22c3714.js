It is the pillar at the Farthest Ends, shining and filled with the brilliance of the planet, even when its original power is still restricted according to the Thirteen Restraints\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>The \u201Cpillar of light\u201D that fastens the outer layer of the World onto the planet is viewed as the main body of the Holy Lance Rhongomyniad. It is because of the existence of the Thirteen Restraints, which are endowed with the same process as the \u201CSacred Sword of the Planet that saves the world\u201D, that it is barely in a state where it can succeed in taking form as a Noble Phantasm.</p><h1 id="character" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#character" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Character</h1><h2 id="pronouns" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#pronouns" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Pronouns</h2><p>First Person Pronoun: watashi<br> Second Person Pronouns: anata / sonata / kisama / kikou<br> Third Person Pronouns: kare / kanojo</p><h2 id="personality" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#personality" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Personality</h2><p>King Arthur, the legendary Knight King who governed over Britain. A what-if King Arthur who, after emerging as a king, made the Holy Lance his main armament instead of the Sacred Sword and reigned over Britain. Although she has the same appearance as the \u201CKnight King\u201D \u2013 aka \u201CGoddess Rhongomyniad\u201D \u2013 who reigned over the Holy City and had acted for the sake of leaving as many humans behind in the aftermath as the majority while the height of the great undertaking, the Human Order Incineration, was looming, she is essentially a different person.</p><p>Having lost her growth suspension caused by the Sacred Sword, Artoria grew to a physical age suitable for a king. She became an existence closer to a Divine Spirit because she is using the Holy Lance, but given that her usage period of the lance was merely about a decade, her mental/spiritual make-up has not changed in a big way. However, her body has changed in a big way.</p><h2 id="attitude-towards-master" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#attitude-towards-master" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Attitude Towards Master</h2><p>Artoria, who was summoned to Chaldea as a Servant, knows the beauty of the world. She will certainly fight together with the Master and wield all the power that she is able to hold, all for the sake of taking back the world that shines even if it is not at the Farthest Ends.</p><h2 id="character-in-fgo" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#character-in-fgo" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Character in FGO</h2><p>A Heroic Spirit of a \u201Cdifferent possibility\u201D that branched from the normal Artoria. Although she has the form of a human, this version of Artoria Pendragon can no longer be called a Heroic Spirit of the Man Attribute. Due to the properties hidden within the Holy Lance, she has changed/altered into an existence close to that of a Divine Spirit \u2013 a goddess if anything. While she has become more rational, and moreover, more composed than the Artoria of the Sacred Sword, her human nature has not been parted with. Rather, there exists placidity in the choices she makes in proportion to how much she has grown into an adult, attaining the ideal way a King ought to be.</p><p>This version of Artoria is a Heroic Spirit of the Heaven Attribute that personally returned her Holy Lance at Camlann Hill, before she returned to the earth. However, the Servant \u201CLion King\u201D, who has the same appearance as her, was not able to die when she was fated to die, and as a result, she became a wandering ghost while keeping onto the Holy Lance. Because the \u201CLion King\u201D held onto the Holy Lance and transformed into \u201CGoddess Rhongomyniad\u201D, completely changing into a Divine Spirit in the process, this version of Artoria is different in the inside compared to the &quot;Lion King&quot;.</p><h2 id="others" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#others" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Others</h2><p>There are various opinions about Artoria\u2019s physique as her body weight is not listed when she is a Lancer.

I felt like I kept in mind of an impression that Saber Artoria had legitimately evolved as I drew her. Afterwards, when the time came where it became necessary for a separate design for her role as the Lion King in Chapter 6, it resulted in us proceeding with a combination of all her Ascension states. As one would expect, if her breasts in her Final Ascension were exposed during Chapter 6: Camelot, it would have totally ruined the whole Holy Selection moment, right?
