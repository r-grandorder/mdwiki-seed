This flame won&#39;t disappear for another 10 or 20 years.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> The curse seeped into the very land itself.<br> This place is no longer fit for human habitation.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Seems so.<br> Apparently, there&#39;s a similar city in America.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> There are fires on the surface, and the ground bseneath is full of gas. It is expected to burn another 50 years.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Well, that was an accident caused by human urban development. This one is a disaster caused by magecraft.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> Disaster by magecraft...<br> What are your thoughts, Master?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> It&#39;s most likely the Holy Grail.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> You believe it&#39;s Holy Grail... As much as I don&#39;t want to admit it, it&#39;s seems undeniable.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> It&#39;s because it became a singularity.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> The Holy Grail was not the cause, rather, the very nature of the city was altered by becoming a singularity?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Excuse me. But it was you who protected this city&#39;s Holy Grail, Saber.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Or to be more precise, another aspect of you.<br> Do you have any memories of those events?</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> ...My apologies.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> Heroic Spirits who are summoned to be Servants are separated from their original selves in that moment.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> When released from our contract, we return to the Throne and all our experiences are stored as integrated memories.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> My current self is the &quot;me&quot; from when I conducted myself as the King of Knights, a Saber.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> Fujimaru, Mash, please think of that black armored version of me as an entirely different person.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Yes, that is both a plus and minus of the Heroic Spirit summoning system.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> A single Heroic Spirit can employ various facets of itself, but combat between the same Heroic Spirit is also possible.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> But rest assured, as long as my dark fallen self belongs to another class I will never change, no matter what happens.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> My sword serves only you and your goal.<br> It will never attack you even by mistake.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I&#39;m glad to hear that.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I trust you, of course.</p><hr><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> Right. Thank you Master,<br> for the time being I shall answer that trust.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That growl!<br> I sense a hostile presence, Senpai!</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> This should provide excellent combat experience.<br> Mash, follow me. I shall show you how to fight!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> Just as I thought, she has potential. Mash will become a fine warrior, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> ...Then again.<br> We still need to work on her fear on the battlefield.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...I&#39;m sorry.<br> Battles are scary, after all.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Aren&#39;t you scared, Saber? I mean, you&#39;re around the same age as me, and you&#39;re a girl too\u2014</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Yes, I&#39;m curious about that myself.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> It was a surprise to learn that the legendary King Arthur was a girl\u2014but what really surprised me was your strength.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I think the quality of Saber&#39;s... Altria&#39;s Spirit Origin is top-class even among Heroic Spirits.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Altria, King Arthur rather,<br> why are you so free of doubt?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> You went so far as to disguise yourself as a man to take the throne, unite a ravaged Britain, and drive off invaders.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> What were your reasons to go to such lengths, and what series of events forced you into that position.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> ...What reasons and events you say? Let me see.<br> I can explain the series of events, if not the reasons.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> I was born to eliminate the previous king, a foolish ruler...<br> Rather, I was created for it.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> I believe it&#39;s a type of magecraft called &quot;conceptual fertilization.&quot;</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> Mother was pregnant with the concept of the Red Dragon, guardian of Britain, and gave birth to me.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> The high quality of my Spirit Origin is likely a result of that. Afterwards, I drew the sword that selects kings.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> Having been chosen by the sword, I was saved by Merlin, my guardian as well as a weird mage.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> I was then entrusted with the sacred sword by the Lady of the Lake, and came to rule Britain.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> That is the long and short of my past.<br> Just like the legends.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> What may differ slightly from your preconceptions is my gender, I suppose.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> I mean. When it comes to ruling a country,<br> being a man made certain things easier.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Wasn&#39;t that hard on you?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Do you regret it?</p><hr><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> Of course. It was difficult, and I had many failures.<br> Like anyone, my life had its ups and downs.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> Nevertheless, I am satisfied with my life.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> I lost my way many times, but in the end, I finally understood.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> Although I have hurt many, and failed to recognize many, I protected that which I held most dear to until the very end.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> Oh dear, this is no place for long chats, is it?</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> Master, your commands. Let us lift some small part of the curse that infects this land!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> Thank you for accepting my wish to see Fuyuki.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> Let us return to Chaldea, Master. I&#39;m sure there are other matters we should be attending now.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Yes, of course.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Just a moment.<br> You haven&#39;t finished your story.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> ...Before we go, tell us one more thing.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> One more thing?</p><hr><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> Of course, I told you how I became a king, but I haven&#39;t told you why.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> My aspiration to be king despite being a woman.<br> ...And for what reasons did I fight?</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> However, it is a simple, trivial matter. I am sure it is the same as you, dear Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> I did not fight for ideals.<br> I fought for the future.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> One that everyone wishes for, everyone desires for. My hand reached for this sword to protect that.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> I am not sure if I did a good job.<br> But I did my best and laid down my life for that dream.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...You have no regrets for how your life ended as King Arthur?</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> I have some disappointments, but no regrets.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> My battle was not the correct salvation for everything\u2014But I am certain it wasn&#39;t a mistake.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> From this point forward it is your battle, Master.<br> I swear on my sword, I will be there to assist you.</p><h2 id="awakening-of-the-holy-sword" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#awakening-of-the-holy-sword" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Awakening of the Holy Sword</h2><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> ...Hm.<br> This area should serve our needs well.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> No one in sight, no buildings either. I don&#39;t think there will be casualties no matter what happens here.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> \u2014Aside from us participants, of course.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Um, Senpai ...Altria is sounding very ominous.<br> What do you think she plans to do this time?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I don&#39;t know.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> She brought us here without explanation...</p><hr><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> Now then, first I must thank you Master.<br> You listened to another unreasonable request from me.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Well, you did ask to go to a deserted wasteland out of the blue. What did you need Fujimaru for?</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> Yes. I thought I might carry out a plan that I have been considering for a while.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> As more Heroic Spirits are assisting Chaldea, our battles are also growing proportionally fiercer.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> To be honest, don&#39;t you feel we are currently ill-equipped? Since we don&#39;t know what we&#39;ll run into in the future.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Well...yes. As a defense specialist, it&#39;s not my place to say, but I&#39;m not sure we&#39;ll last with our current firepower.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> I thought so.<br> Which is why I think it&#39;s time for me to be serious.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> What!<br> You mean you weren&#39;t fighting seriously until now?</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> I have been fighting seriously, but with limitation.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> My sword is, shall we say, complicated in its workings.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> For example, it must not strike one pure of heart.<br> I also must not strike a fairy.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> Such are the multiple oaths of this sword. If any are violated, the power of my Mana Burst is reduced.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Something like a dress code, perhaps.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> So what you&#39;re saying is, your sword has never been fully unleashed?</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> Yes. A strike with all of its oaths released will probably be an once in a lifetime event.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> I&#39;m not even sure if we&#39;ll even get such a chance, but for now, I would like to release some of the oathes to raise its output.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> That&#39;s the reason I brought you to this place Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> &quot;Anyone who fights at my side must be courageous&quot;\u2014In order to fulfil this oath.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...In other words, if your Master is weak,<br> your sword won&#39;t be at its full potential?</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> In this case, it means strength of spirit, not body.<br> Does this person possess the courage to face someone stronger.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> The sacred sword scales to the strength of a Master&#39;s heart. With that being said\u2014</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Wh-What&#39;s with all this magical energy!<br> Saber, what are you doing?</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> I am summoning a demon that I once struck down and sealed away. Is there a problem?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Don&#39;t tell me!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Impossible!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> This amount of energy is on par with a Dragonkin...<br> Senpai and I can&#39;t possibly handle that now!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Why would you do that? I don&#39;t remember King Arthur being capable of spells like that!</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> Oh that, I discussed it with Ms. Leonardo and had her provide me with an instant scroll.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Da Vinnnnnci!</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> Now&#39;s the time to show our courage, Master!<br> Let&#39;s overcome this danger together!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The King ended up being a nutcase!<br> S-Senpai, what should we do?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Looks like our only option is to fight!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Ok, hit me with your best shot!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> How can this be?<br> My Master is the same kind of person as Saber!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Whew...<br> We managed...somehow...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Wow, what a spectacular victory you two... Wasn&#39;t that a bit more powerful than a weaker Demon God?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I&#39;m exhausted...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I thought we were goners...</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Still, one of the conditions has been cleared.<br> So I guess it was worth the effort?</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> Rest time is over.<br> What are you two doing? More enemies are coming.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> There&#39;s a second army? Just how crazy was the Britain under King Arthur&#39;s name!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Grr! I&#39;m at the end of my rope!<br> Saber, this is the last one right?</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> Yes, this is the last. Not to worry,<br> they aren&#39;t much different than the previous ones.</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Whew... Yikes, twin demons...<br> But this should be the...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Oh, come on!<br> Saber, are you serious?</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> Hm? Oh...My apologies, I wasn&#39;t clear enough.<br> What I meant was, those were the last &quot;demons.&quot;</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> This time for sure, these are the last enemies we must defeat. We just need to deal with the Dragonkin who serve the demons.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> \u2014Did you say...Dragonkin?</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> Come, Master and Mash, now is the time to demonstrate your knowledge and valor! Worry not, if anyone can overcome this it is you!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> U-Unwarranted trust can sometimes hit harder than a blow from a dragon, Senpai!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> \u2014</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I can&#39;t believe we had to fight a powerful Phantasmal in a wasteland like this for no particular reason.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Mash, Fujimaru, well done...<br> I can imagine how tired you must be...</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> What are you so depressed for?<br> Now is the time to raise a victory shout.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> By your own hand, you have proven that you are without limits.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> As the Servant who serves you, nothing could make me more proud.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Y-You really mean it?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> You&#39;re proud, Saber?</p><hr><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> Yes. We Servants are not...<br> interested in our own strength.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> (She said, &quot;very&quot; in a small voice, Senpai.)</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> Ahem. Mash, please keep that to yourself.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> In a sense, Heroic Spirits are beings who can see their end, their\u2014final form. We each know our own strength.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> That is not true of you. Where will the humans living in your era find themselves in the end?</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> How much will they grow? What heights will they reach?<br> To us Heroic Spirits, it is beyond our imagination.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> That is why I am proud that I met a Master such as you.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> ...It is odd, though.<br> I feel as if something like this has happened before.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> Perhaps I will meet &quot;someone&quot; like you at some point.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> ...I can be inspired by a Master I respect and love, even if they are inexperienced.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> However, this is not the time for that.<br> What I can do is to guide you to your final battle.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> Fujimaru, Master of Chaldea.<br> My sword has acknowledged your worth.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> I too, shall strive to serve you with more strength.<br> Let us continue to fight well together.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Saber...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> We got King Arthur&#39;s stamp of approval...<br> Plus, we got an upgrade on her Noble Phantasm...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Let&#39;s keep fighting the good fight, Saber.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> Yes, please use the increased strength of my Noble Phantasm as your secret weapon against powerful enemies.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Refrain from any crazy stuff next time, Saber.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> Y-You think so?<br> I thought that the ends justified the means.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> Judging from Mash&#39;s exhaustion, I see that perhaps I did go too far. Very well, I shall be more careful from now on!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> She doesn&#39;t get it...<br> This king just doesn&#39;t get it!</p><hr>', 195);
