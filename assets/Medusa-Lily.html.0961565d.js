(TLnote \u795E\u3005\u3057\u3055, not \u795E\u6027aka Divinity as a skill) Her presence is close to that of a normal Servant. However, as expected her disposition is no different from that of a human little girl. But even as her humane appearance is that of a very young one, generally there is a composure surrounding her.</p><p>During life, her grown up self had transformed into the monster Gorgon and had taken in both of her sisters. Due to memories of those, she instinctively fear growing up.<br> Her being negative in regards of leveling up and ascension is due to this.<br> Should she know that leveling up and ascension is not something that would lead her transforming herself into a monster, she would show a look of relief towards the Master.</p><h2 id="attitude-towards-master" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#attitude-towards-master" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Attitude Towards Master</h2><p>The Master is just another human, yet she does not show much vigilance.

Her character has also changed from her as a Rider.<br> However, she is different from her sisters, who are &quot;immortal maidens who can only live by accepting help from others&quot;. Already she is endowed with the strength to fight and the indications of a demon that would plunder away many lives.<br> Normally she cannot be summoned, a Servant of the divine spirit variety.<br> She manifested during the crisis of human history&#39;s demise, but...<br> Beyond being summoned at Chaldea, she seems to have at the very least 2 people she wants to meet. In the beginning she would barely approach them, unable to do much beyond staring from the distance in tears; let us carefully watch over her without rushing.</p><h2 id="standard-weapons" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#standard-weapons" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Standard Weapons</h2><p>Thrusting attack by means of a two handed weapon.

She is a Lancer now but in the beginning she was ****, is the cause. Her weapon was designed to be more lance-like, but a large scythe is like, much more cooler! Is the reason of why it&#39;s arranged like that. (As long as you don&#39;t touch stuffs that is obviously no good, there are lots of case where the self modded design got a pass) The staffs at battle sprite production always ended up going through hardship each time, but I have to say I really like the gimmick where they change her hairstyle on ascension. Braid, loosen, ponytail; making those small differences was quite an ordeal, but I&#39;m really glad I drew it in the end. Her sickle and chain action was so greaaaat.... It was not really Lancer-like (LOL) but now it reminds me, is swimsuit Kiyohime&#39;s hidden class strengthening not here yet...?
