From the anecdote of him having \u201Cpierced the flies perched on the wall without scratching the wall\u201D, one can guess that his precise movements are also not very different from when he fights bare-handed.</p><h1 id="character" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#character" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Character</h1><h2 id="pronouns" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#pronouns" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Pronouns</h2><p>First Person Pronoun: washi<br> Second Person Pronoun: onushi<br> Third Person Pronoun: ayatsu</p><h2 id="personality" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#personality" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Personality</h2><p>To put him in a few words, a blade that cuts sharply upon being touched. Li Shuwen has regained his youth; therefore, he is equipped with a condition where his rough nature is laid bare in the open. On the topic of one having attained their youth to some extent after becoming, more or less, heroes, there are many people who will have that sort of breezy feeling of feeling young again, but for Li Shuwen in particular, that nature is stronger within him.</p><p>At the time of having grown old, he was intimate with children as the \u201Cgrandpa who taught them boxing\u201D, but Li Shuwen as he is now swings his Evil Fist on his own accord, devoting everything he has to fight a formidable and tough enemy, as well as to being a martial artist with even some austere sense.</p><h2 id="attitude-towards-master" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#attitude-towards-master" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Attitude Towards Master</h2><p>Towards his Master, Li Shuwen basically treats them as a superior or an equal.</p><p>And, no matter what sort of unjust tactic it is, if it is \u201Cfor the sake of fighting with a formidable enemy\u201D, Li Shuwen will maintain a degree of generosity and close his eyes for his victims. As one would expect, he does not have a behaviour of attacking the weak on purpose, but he would especially not hesitate to attack them if he understands that it is necessary to do so. He does not kill without reason, but if there is some reason to kill, then one can conclude that he has no problem doing so.</p><p>Regarding the Holy Grail, Li Shuwen has no particular wish\u2026 but, if the opportunity of making a wish does come true, he is secretly intending on \u201CSomething like fighting against my aged self.\u201D</p><h2 id="dialogue-examples" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#dialogue-examples" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Dialogue Examples</h2><p>\u201CEven if I say so myself, it seems brutal to attain enlightenment with this body.

Whichever one it is, the fact is that both are me. Although, you will understand someday what I just mentioned.\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014Let us\u2026 have a fair\u2026 match!!\u201D&quot;</p><h2 id="historical-character-and-figure" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#historical-character-and-figure" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Historical Character and Figure</h2><p>Li Shuwen, originating from Cangzhou, Hebei, is a legendary martial artist who possessed so much talent, he was extolled to the point of being called \u201CThe God Spear\u201D from the closing years of the Qing Dynasty to the Republic of China era. Rather than mastering one thousand techniques, he placed an emphasis on polishing up a single technique, and it is said that the techniques he made use of were practically no more than the most basic of basics as well. To that degree, he also left behind a legend where his polished blows are so intense, his opponent died just from being given a feint. His Noble Phantasm has also been given another name, \u201CA Second Strike is Needless\u201D, and this is something that sublimated the episode of that time.</p><p>In his later years, although Li Shuwen displayed a side as a good-natured old man who taught boxing to the neighbouring children, around the time of his youth \u2013 like the occasion of him being summoned as he is now \u2013 he was at that moment the Demon Fist Master who wields his Evil Fist. The reason he shouts \u201Cseven wounds of gushing blood\u201D at the time of being summoned as an Assassin in \u201CFate/EXTRA\u201D was because of an anecdote where his opponent who received his blow had stopped breathing while spouting blood from both his eyes, mouth, nostrils and ears.</p><p>Furthermore, Servants in the Holy Grail War are fundamentally summoned in their golden age form, but limited to Li Shuwen, he can be exceptionally summoned in his elderly form. This is none other than because this single human being has entered his golden age twice with two different forms. It is a difference whether he is in his golden age with only his skill with the fist \u2013 wielding them to the utmost limit to achieve a state of oneness with the universe \u2013 or whether he is in his golden age during his season of old age where he possesses a fighting spirit that engulfs all his enemies. His youthful season where he exerts his wild fists, and his aged self where he exerts his rational fists that had arrived at a domain said to be beautiful. The directions of their strengths are different. This peculiarity is rarely seen by other Servants, and in a normal Holy Grail War as well, it is possible for even a showdown to occur between the same person summoned in different Classes.</p><h2 id="related-characters" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#related-characters" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Related Characters</h2><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach</strong></p><p>What resulted of the last bout in the Fifth Chapter? It is not clear because of the Human Order Correction.</p><p><strong>Wong Fei-hung</strong></p><p>In the history of Chinese martial arts, this person is the master standing at the highest peak. Imagining about that special move which leaves not even a shadow behind, Li Shuwen wonders how closely it can reach him, so he will not calm down unless he kills that hero, even if he is only dreaming of such a moment.</p><h2 id="comment-from-the-illustrator" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#comment-from-the-illustrator" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Comment from the Illustrator</h2><p>Braids!
