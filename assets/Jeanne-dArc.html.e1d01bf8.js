That was just my personal feeling.<br> I am entirely your Servant now, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> At any rate, let&#39;s gather some information in the town.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Excuse me.</p><p><strong>G\uFF1ACitizen:</strong><br> Yes?<br> What is it?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Actually\u2013</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> Pardon me.<br> May I have a moment?</p><p><strong>E\uFF1ACitizen:</strong><br> What do you need?</p><p><strong>G\uFF1ACitizen:</strong><br> Hello, there.<br> What would you like?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> There&#39;s something I&#39;d like to know...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Master!<br> This is terrible!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Did you find something?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> A surprising change after all!?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> No. Nothing has happened.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> ...Yes, that&#39;s right. The town is peaceful.<br> Only tiny squabbles that the law could easily resolve.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> But it seems in this world, England defeated Charles VII, and all of France came under his domain.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That means...</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> That&#39;s right.<br> I am afraid\u2013&quot;I do not exist&quot; in this world.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> There&#39;s really nowhere else left for us to investigate.<br> I guess we could check out the castle, but that&#39;s it.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> But...I find it hard to believe thatEnglish soldiers would allow us in.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes, you&#39;re right.<br> At any rate, let&#39;s get out of here.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> We weren&#39;t able to find any leads at all...<br> I&#39;m worried about tomorrow.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Tomorrow is...</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes, I know, tomorrow is another day.<br> Hehe.

But, it&#39;s peaceful.<br> There no longer is a heart-rending war.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> It&#39;s possible that I might even be in Domremy.<br> I could be living my life peacefully in that village.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> Common upbringing, common prayers, even a common romance.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Do you want to see?</p><hr><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> ...Just a little.<br> But, I feel it would bring me pain afterwards.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> I&#39;m sure that the me over there is happy.<br> So I want to pray for her, just a little bit more.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> Master, go and join Mash and Fou, all right?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Master, where&#39;s Jeanne?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...I see. This indeed is a world where Jeanne doesn&#39;t exist\u2013it is the epitome of peace.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> But there&#39;s something wrong about this.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> If Jeanne doesn&#39;t rise, and France is not a reality, there will be big implications on history to follow.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I have...a strange feeling about this...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> It&#39;s too peaceful.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes, that is absolutely right.<br> This world is almost too peaceful.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> There&#39;s no trace of disturbance anywhere in the town.<br> You&#39;d think there&#39;ll be more resistance for a land that was taken by force.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> There was absolutely nothing wrong in the town\u2013<br> To me, that&#39;s actually more odd.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Let&#39;s take Jeanne back to town with us and look again.<br> We need to dig deeper, I think.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> ...What&#39;s this...!?</p><p><strong>E\uFF1ACitizen:</strong><br> Hello there.<br> How are you?</p><p><strong>E\uFF1ACitizen:</strong><br> Oh, what&#39;s the matter?<br> What do you need?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...The current time is...1AM...right?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> In this era, it would be safe to assume most people would be asleep by now already...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> But the streets are just as busy as during the day.<br> ...I knew it, something is off!</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> \u2013Let&#39;s head for the castle. The only place we didn&#39;t investigate during the day was that castle.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Sure!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> This is...!</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> There&#39;s blood everywhere...and I am sensing a colossal amount of magical energy.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> The wandering ghosts...are...French soldiers...!?<br> No, there are Englishmen among them, too!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> They&#39;re attacking us!<br> Master, orders, please!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Take this!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It&#39;s finally...over.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> The spirits of those dead soldiers... Wandering this world with regrets. It&#39;s just too many of them.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> But in the town, there was not a single ghost.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> ...Wait, who is in charge of the town to begin with?If there are no soldiers here, then what are they\u2013?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I don&#39;t know. But one thing is for certain.<br> This door won&#39;t open any more.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Which means...they don&#39;t intend to let us get away.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> ...Let&#39;s move on.<br> I still sense something demonic deeper inside the castle.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I hear footsteps.<br> Several of them...</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> Remnants?...No, it doesn&#39;t appear so.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> Wait, these are...werebeasts?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Master, orders please!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> How did those monsters get here?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It makes no sense to me either.

Right you are!<br> Right you are!

That is an excellent answer!<br> I applaud you! A great round of applause, everyone!</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong><br> So, what of it?<br> How does that make you feel?</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> To be honest, It certainly makes me feel awful.<br> But in the end, this is all a fantasy.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> I have nothing to fear from a fantasy.</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong><br> However, what about a logical fantasy?</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong><br> This town is an actualization of the assumption,<br> &quot;what if you never existed.&quot;</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong><br> Jeanne d&#39;Arc!<br> O Holy Maiden of Salvation!</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong><br> You alone do not make the world go round!<br> Nay.

It really IS a ghost ship...</p><p><strong>Pirate A:</strong></p><p>...Ungh...booze...trea...sure...</p><p><strong>Pirate A:</strong></p><p>Wenches... Good-looking girls...<br> Amazons... Tanned... Abs...</p><p><strong>Pirate B:</strong></p><p>Pink hair... Ditzy...</p><p><strong>Pirate C:</strong></p><p>Braids... Glasses... Intellectual...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Just like the Beard-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Why are pirates all the same...?</p><hr><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> Even in death, they think almost exactly like Blackbeard, don&#39;t they...</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> Either way, I cannot allow them to remain.<br> The dead deserve a peaceful rest.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> ...Let&#39;s go!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Strange. Something weird slipped in.</p><hr><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> L-looks like we got everyone!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> The ship&#39;s starting to move...!?</p><hr><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> It appears the ship itself possesses magical energy. If we stop it prematurely, we will be stuck in the middle of the ocean.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> ...It doesn&#39;t seem to want to harm us.<br> Let&#39;s continue our course.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> In the end, man always seeks to make the impossible...possible.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> This is at once a diabolical power and a ray of hope, a desire to make the unknown...known.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> ...Yes. That is what being human means.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> That very fiendishness is precisely what led to so many discoveries in the Age of Exploration.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Conversely, the desire for righteousness and justice can make people commit acts of unspeakable cruelty\u2013like when I was burned at the stake.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Man&#39;s vices can be forgiven... But what of his virtues?</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> Master!<br> I see a ship up ahead!</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> Is it...drifting? Its sails are tattered.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Looks like there are people on board.</p><hr><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> They&#39;re waving at us.<br> The ship is coming closer, so I&#39;m going to talk to them.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> What&#39;s going on? Did something happen!?</p><p><strong>Crewman:</strong><br> Help!<br> We&#39;re about to sink!</p><p><strong>Crewman:</strong><br> Let us aboard!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Hey, we stopped...</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> Looks like everyone&#39;s coming aboard regardless of what we have to say about it...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Let&#39;s help them out.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> Of course.<br> Hehe. I&#39;m glad we&#39;re on the same page, Master.</p><hr><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> You there!<br> We&#39;ll extend the plank to your ship, so please hurry!</p><p><strong>Drifter:</strong><br> Thank you... Thank you!</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> Women and children first!<br> You still have time!</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> Strange... So few people on a ship that size shouldn&#39;t be enough to sink it...</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> Is that everyone!?</p><p><strong>Crewman:</strong><br> No, there&#39;s more!<br> There&#39;s still two on board!</p><p><strong>Crewman:</strong><br> Hey, you two!</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> Eh...? No...it can&#39;t be... Impossible...!</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> Wh-why, why are you here!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Jeanne...?</p><hr><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> Why are you here!?<br> Mother...!?</p><p><strong>Crewman:</strong><br> Oh come now. You don&#39;t even know the half of it yet!</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong><br> ...Hello, hello! Long time no see!<br> It&#39;s been, oh, a few days since we last met, I believe?</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong><br> Everybody stop!</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> Mephistopheles!<br> What the hell are you...!?</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong><br> Well, they&#39;re just background characters. I wouldn&#39;t want them to cause trouble, so just ignore them.</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong><br> ...Now then, Jeanne d&#39;Arc. Excluding me, there are two people left on board this ship.</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong><br> One is your own mother!</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong><br> Thank you so much for coming all the way from France!</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong><br> Just kidding! Keheeheehee!</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong><br> But wait, there&#39;s more! Our last guest of honor needs no introduction...but I&#39;m gonna do it anyway!</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong><br> He is...the filthy bishop who, under England&#39;s orders, led you to your execution at the stake!</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong><br> A real human dumpster fire... The man who was bribed for his judgment, who consigned your soul to the flames!</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong><br> The man who laughed and jeered while you were burning. Yes, you should know who it is by now!</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> Pierre Cauchon!</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong><br> Eeexaaactly! Now let&#39;s untie these two!</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong><br> This won&#39;t hurt one itty-bitty bit, okeydokey?</p><p><strong>Pierre Cauchon:</strong><br> ...P-p-please don&#39;t pull...<br> Ouch! Ow! Ow! Ow!</p><p><strong>Mother:</strong><br> ...Oh, Jeanne...</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong><br> Oh, but that ship of yours? It can only carry one more. Let more than that aboard...and it will surely founder!</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong><br> Now, Jeanne d&#39;Arc!<br> Make your decision!</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong><br> Who will you save? Your mother, who has loved you your entire life, or this old geezer who scorned you to the very end?</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong><br> Well? Well? WELL!? Whatcha gonna do!?</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> ...Oh. The answer is easy.</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong><br> Huh?</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> I will simply get off. They can have my place.</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong><br> ...There was not a bit of hesitation there.<br> Shoulda seen that coming!</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> ...Mother. You are probably an illusion...</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> But I&#39;m glad I could see you once more. Now, please, board our ship.</p><p><strong>Mother:</strong><br> B-but...</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> Bishop Cauchon.<br> ...You go too. Hurry.</p><p><strong>Pierre Cauchon:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Pierre Cauchon:</strong><br> I-I am not wrong.<br> You are a witch!</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> ...And that is fine.<br> What a stubborn man you are.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Come back!</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> No. This is the right thing to do.<br> I&#39;m very sorry, Master.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I&#39;m going with you!</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> Wh-what a surprise.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> I don&#39;t know what to say, Master... I&#39;m happy, but such an attitude will lead to an early death for you!</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> I&#39;m one to talk? Y-yes, that&#39;s true, but...!</p><hr><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong><br> ...How could you forgive a man like Pierre Cauchon?</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> My mother&#39;s sadness will fade one day, just as, in time, my distaste for the bishop will disappear too.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> It is the sole province of God to judge what is evil.<br> As humans, all we can do is fight against it.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> This man may never have my forgiveness, but salvation is a different matter.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> If it&#39;s possible, I shall save him.<br> However many times I must.</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong><br> But didn&#39;t you hear what his last words were?<br> There was not an ounce of remorse in them.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> It is not for me to demand remorse, regret, or repentance. After all, humans cannot be other than what they are.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> ...Mephistopheles. This ship is going to sink, correct?</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> You should move over to our ship one as well. You may be a Servant, but I&#39;m sure it would still be a problem for you if you were to be stranded out at sea.</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong><br> Oh my. You really are an interesting person...to your own detriment!</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong><br> But to the individual who had summoned me, I&#39;m sure this is such a buzzkill!</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong><br> I&#39;m sure they are positively apoplectic right now!</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong><br> So now I shall demonstrate that your choice was a mistake!</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> Eh...!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> A Noble Phantasm!?</p><hr><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> Wha...!?</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong><br> I did not want you to take this game so seriously!<br> This is merely an imitation! A sham!</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong><br> Ah, but then again, these things are imitations that are so very close to being real.</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong><br> At least, your real mother would probably have reacted the same way. And even Pierre Cauchon would definitely say what he said!</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> Mephistopheles...!!!</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong><br> ...Ehehehe! Very good!<br> I do so ADORE that look on your face!</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> Master! That ship is no longer safe!<br> Please jump over here!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> O-okay!</p><hr><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong><br> Aha. So Master&#39;s come too.<br> Well then... Come, my Shadow Servants!</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> Shadow Servants...!<br> Just who are you working for!?</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong><br> Oh, don&#39;t you worry your little head about that.<br> It&#39;s playtime!!!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong><br> Keeheeheehee! I lost again!</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> You were a strong opponent!</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong><br> Kahahahahahaha!<br> That&#39;s not how it was supposed to be, Jeanne d&#39;Arc!</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong><br> Our loss was determined the very moment you chose to sacrifice your own life without hesitation!</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong><br> Why? Don&#39;t you get it?<br> I am the great demon, Mephistopheles!</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong><br> If you don&#39;t fall from grace, the only other choice is for us to lose!</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong><br> Well, looks like I&#39;m still going to get overworked!<br> Thanks for playing!</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong><br> See you again! Byeee!!!</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> He disappeared again.<br> It doesn&#39;t seem like we defeated him, though...</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> Still, I&#39;m starting to understand what his intentions are.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> Let&#39;s do our\u2013</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> Master? Um, are you by chance...mad?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You shouldn&#39;t throw your life away recklessly.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> Errr... But at that moment, there were no other options...</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> Well I, um, thought that would be the best solution...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Please don&#39;t die.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> Um. Th-that line really gets to me...</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> But in that situation, the only choice I could have made was to do what\u2013</p><hr><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I know.</p><hr><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> I&#39;m glad you understand!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I&#39;m still mad.</p><hr><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> ...I-I-I&#39;m sorry!</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> I know! Chaldea!<br> When we get back to Chaldea, I&#39;ll treat you to anything!</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> Whether we go to Boudica or Emiya...<br> It&#39;ll be your choice!</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> My journey will continue.<br> But the end is also on the horizon.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> Even if that journey ends, I would like to continue traveling with you, Master. To fight as a Heroic Spirit.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> Protecting humanity.<br> Protecting virtue.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> That is what I wish for, and nothing more.</p><h2 id="my-god-is-with-me-iii" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#my-god-is-with-me-iii" aria-hidden="true">#</a> My God is with Me III</h2><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> ...I don&#39;t feel pain from being burned.<br> ...I don&#39;t feel grief from being cursed.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> The only thing I feel is immense, overwhelming heartbreak. It&#39;s not my body that&#39;s being consumed, but my soul.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Since I don&#39;t seek salvation in ascension,<br> the stake doesn&#39;t fill me with despair.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Instead, I find myself entranced by the flames.<br> The beautiful, magnificent flames.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Even as they reduce my flesh to ash,<br> I can feel the holy flames purifying my soul.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Thus began Jeanne d&#39;Arc the Servant.

Isn&#39;t that...</p><hr><p><strong>E\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Wake up, or you&#39;ll start to hear my shrillest laugh in surround sooound!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Are you trying to curse me!?</p><hr><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong><br> Theeere you are. Wakey wakey, eggs and bakey!<br> It&#39;s me, Mephistopheles!</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong><br> What an unexpected, but delightful,<br> surprise to find you here!</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong><br> May I ask what brings you out this way, Master?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...Can I go back to bed now?</p><hr><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong><br> No, no, no, nonono! We are long since past that!<br> Yes! Long since past!</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong><br> Sadly, our present situation is sliiightly less than ideal for sleepyheads!</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong><br> Why is that, your pleading eyes ask?<br> The answer is simple.</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong><br> Because the way things are going,<br> the world will soon be destroyed!</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong><br> ...All right, let&#39;s go over this world.</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong><br> As I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve already guessed,<br> this is a non-dream dream. You know, that old saw.</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong><br> There&#39;s no getting in touch with Chaldea here.<br> We may as well be cut off from the entire timeline.</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong><br> The only place this world connects to is itself.</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong><br> I believe it belongs to Jeanne d&#39;Arc.</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong><br> And your task here is to destroy it.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Okay...so what about you?</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong><br> Ooh, harsh! Well, you know,<br> I have my own reasons for being here.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> What are you doing here, Mephy?</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong><br> Maybe I&#39;m here because, of all the Servants in Chaldea, I&#39;m the closest there is to everyone&#39;s image of the Devil?</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong><br> Oh, and I also have my own connection to that Ruler, as you know.</p><hr><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong><br> Now, on that note, let&#39;s be on our way!<br> The final battlefield awaits!</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong><br> Oh, I do beg your pardon.</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong><br> Final battle or no, even I must admit that showing up dressed like the Devil would be in poor taste!</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong><br> So, without further ado...!</p><p><strong>E\uFF1AMephistopheles:</strong><br> What do you think?<br> Now I look just like any other soldier!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Wow, that&#39;s handy...!</p><hr><p><strong>E\uFF1AMephistopheles:</strong><br> Of course, it might be easier to just cast a perception inhibitor spell and be done with it, but this way is more fun.</p><p><strong>E\uFF1AMephistopheles:</strong><br> Now then, you there, soldier. It sounds like the whole town is abuzz. Pray tell, what might be going on?</p><p><strong>Soldier:</strong><br> Oh, they&#39;re about to hold an execution.</p><p><strong>E\uFF1AMephistopheles:</strong><br> An execution, you say?</p><p><strong>Soldier:</strong><br> Aye, they say Jeanne d&#39;Arc finally confessed to heresy.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Wha...!?</p><hr><p><strong>E\uFF1AMephistopheles:</strong><br> My, my, whatever are we going to do now?</p><p><strong>E\uFF1AMephistopheles:</strong><br> Historically, this is where she is meant to be burned at the stake.</p><p><strong>E\uFF1AMephistopheles:</strong><br> Even if, hypothetically speaking, we were to Rayshift in and save her at the last second...</p><p><strong>E\uFF1AMephistopheles:</strong><br> ...the end result would almost certainly be the same.</p><p><strong>E\uFF1AMephistopheles:</strong><br> Whether Jeanne is burned at the stake,<br> or ends up dying of old age...</p><p><strong>E\uFF1AMephistopheles:</strong><br> ...her role in history has come to an end,<br> and I doubt it would have any other effect.</p><p><strong>E\uFF1AMephistopheles:</strong><br> If she succeeded at avoiding the stake and tried to stand on history&#39;s stage once more, I imagine there would be secret efforts made to...you know.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Assassinate her...?</p><p><strong>E\uFF1AMephistopheles:</strong><br> Indeed. I imagine Charles VII, or perhaps someone else, would betray her, and she would meet a bloody end nonetheless.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Betray her?</p><p><strong>E\uFF1AMephistopheles:</strong><br> Indeed. I&#39;m guessing she would be betrayed again,<br> and end up getting murdered anyway.</p><hr><p><strong>E\uFF1AMephistopheles:</strong><br> Aaanyway, none of that matters in this world!</p><p><strong>E\uFF1AMephistopheles:</strong><br> There may be nothing to stop us from leaving her to her fate, but there is nothing stopping us from saving her, either!</p><p><strong>Citizen:</strong><br> It&#39;s Jeanne d&#39;Arc!<br> It&#39;s the witch!</p><p><strong>Citizen:</strong><br> Poor thing. I don&#39;t see why they have to execute her.</p><p><strong>Citizen:</strong><br> Hey, they say she&#39;s a witch.</p><p><strong>Citizen:</strong><br> Forget the cross! Give her a good stoning!</p><p><strong>Citizen:</strong><br> Is God going to punish all of us for this?<br> Or just the priests carrying it out?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Wait a second. That Jeanne is\u2013</p><hr><p><strong>E\uFF1AMephistopheles:</strong><br> Indeed, she is. Or isn&#39;t, rather.</p><p><strong>E\uFF1AMephistopheles:</strong><br> That&#39;s neither Jeanne the Rogue Servant,<br> nor the actual Jeanne from history.</p><p><strong>E\uFF1AMephistopheles:</strong><br> That&#39;s Jeanne d&#39;Arc...the Ruler.</p><p><strong>E\uFF1AMephistopheles:</strong><br> Which perhaps means that if she&#39;s burned at the stake now, she may just cease to be your Servant.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> What!? We&#39;ve got to do something!</p><hr><p><strong>Prosecutor:</strong><br> Order! We will now carry out the sentence of execution on Jeanne d&#39;Arc!</p><p><strong>Prosecutor:</strong><br> This girl claimed she was a saint! She claimed that she heard the voice of God! She defied the Church!</p><p><strong>Prosecutor:</strong><br> She had no compunctions about engaging in the worst kind of heresy. She is beyond redemption!</p><p><strong>E\uFF1AMephistopheles:</strong><br> My, oh my. This is true of all these sorts of witch trials, of course...</p><p><strong>E\uFF1AMephistopheles:</strong><br> ...but I do so enjoy this gloomy atmosphere!</p><p><strong>E\uFF1AMephistopheles:</strong><br> Hm? Why are you looking at me like that?<br> Do you think I&#39;m not normal or something?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> To put it lightly.<br><strong>E\uFF1AMephistopheles:</strong><br> Oh...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Yes, but then again, you are Mephy, after all.</p><p><strong>E\uFF1AMephistopheles:</strong><br> Hohoho, you know me so well! No wonder you&#39;ve been able to keep me on as a Servant!</p><hr><p><strong>Prosecutor:</strong><br> Do you have anything to say for yourself, Jeanne d&#39;Arc?</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Prosecutor:</strong><br> ...It would appear you do not.<br> Very well, light the fire!</p><p><strong>E\uFF1AMephistopheles:</strong><br> ...So, what are you going to do now, Master?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I&#39;m going to save her.</p><p><strong>E\uFF1AMephistopheles:</strong><br> Ahh, just as I thought!<br> In that case, I think I&#39;ll join you!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Are you coming with, Mephy?</p><p><strong>E\uFF1AMephistopheles:</strong><br> Oho. So your going to save her is a foregone conclusion, and the only question is whether I will be joining you, hm?</p><p><strong>E\uFF1AMephistopheles:</strong><br> Of course I will!</p><hr><p><strong>E\uFF1AMephistopheles:</strong><br> But first, another change of clothes...</p><p><strong>E\uFF1AMephistopheles:</strong><br> Ah tah ta tah\u266A<br> Let&#39;s go do this thiiing\u266A</p><p><strong>A\uFF1AProsecutor:</strong><br> Hm? You there, who are you!?<br> Soldiers, stop them!</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong><br> Annnd switch!</p><p><strong>Soldier:</strong><br> Y-yeowch!? That&#39;s hot!</p><p><strong>Soldier:</strong><br> What the hell was that!?<br> That man... Don&#39;t tell me he&#39;s...</p><p><strong>Soldier:</strong><br> The Devil!?</p><p><strong>Prosecutor:</strong><br> Settle down! Settle down!<br> Soldiers, kill that jester!</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong><br> Nobody&#39;s killing meee!</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> Ah...<br> You...!?</p><p><strong>Prosecutor:</strong><br> Khh...! Never mind that!<br> Just light the cursed fire!</p><p><strong>Prosecutor:</strong><br> So what if the Devil has come to save the witch!?<br> Kill them both and be done with it!</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> ...Please, stop this.<br> Don&#39;t...!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Sorry, but I can&#39;t leave you to burn!</p><hr><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> I mean it!<br> This is wrong...!</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> I...I&#39;m supposed to...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> That doesn&#39;t matter!</p><hr><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> Master...!</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> ...I...</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong><br> ...You wished for it, didn&#39;t you, Jeanne?</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> Huh...?</p><p><strong>Prosecutor:</strong><br> You said it, you said it, you said it!<br> We heard you, we heard you, we heard you!</p><p><strong>Prosecutor:</strong><br> You did all hear that, didn&#39;t you everyone?<br> [\u2642 He /\u2640\uFE0F She} said it plain as day, didn&#39;t [\u2642 he /\u2640\uFE0F she}?</p><p><strong>Prosecutor:</strong><br> Fujimaru said [\u2642 he /\u2640\uFE0F she} was going to save Jeanne d&#39;Arc! And what&#39;s more...she herself asked to be saved!</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong><br> That&#39;s right, Jeanne d&#39;Arc has wished to be saved!<br> Now, Jeanne. Darkness has awoken within you!</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong><br> That&#39;s enough of the jester act!<br> It&#39;s time to show who I really am.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> What the...!?<br> You&#39;re...!</p><p><strong>C\uFF1AMephistopheles (?):</strong><br> My, my, oh my, my, my. What can the humble prosecutor Mephistopheles do for you?</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong><br> What the? Another one of me? You know, I could swear something like this happened before.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> ...This must be the next part of that dream...<br> And that must mean you&#39;re here.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Figured it out, did you? Well, I guess it was getting kind of obvious by this point.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> A version of me dressed in black...! But I thought you disappeared after the Holy Grail was collected!?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> ...It did. Since I was the Holy Grail,<br> I was fated to disappear once it was collected.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> But it turns out that the Holy Grail was nothing more than my source of magical energy. I exist because that&#39;s what Gilles wished for.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Even after the Grail was recovered and that time period repaired, his wish remained.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Nor did the wish itself ever disappear.<br> In which case, why wouldn&#39;t I still exist?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> That said, I&#39;d lost almost all of my power. If I&#39;d been left to my own devices, I would have disappeared...</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> But then...you stopped me, Jeanne.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> You acknowledged my existence without even realizing the truth.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> You discovered your own dark side...one that was never meant to exist in the first place.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> But...I...</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> That&#39;s right. You didn&#39;t accept me.<br> You said I couldn&#39;t possibly exist.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> ...And you were right.<br> But I still had something to say about it.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong></p><p>I exist!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Whatever the circumstances of my creation,<br> I was still created!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> ...But even though I could advocate for my own existence, there was only so much else I could do.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Namely, create a small world, summon Mephistopheles, and poke whatever darkness you had inside.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> ...Sure, my last two attempts might have ended in failure.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> But this stake...that was immutable.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> This was the place where Jeanne d&#39;Arc&#39;s dreams came to an end.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Even if Jeanne herself had given up and decided to offer herself to the Lord...introducing a third party changes things considerably.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Especially one who wishes for nothing more than to save her, and is willing to act on that wish.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> In other words...</p><hr><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Now do you get it? That&#39;s right!<br> I&#39;m talking about you, Fujimaru!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> You&#39;ve gone and proven that Jeanne d&#39;Arc did have a secret desire to escape her fate!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> In her very last moments, she saw hope in you.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> And so she wanted to be saved!<br> She wished for it! Desperately!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> But she thought that wish was wrong,<br> was evidence of her own dark side!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Once she decided to abandon what was right and cling to her own life, that was the moment I took root inside her!</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong><br> My, my, you don&#39;t say.<br> Is that true, other me?</p><p><strong>C\uFF1AMephistopheles (?):</strong><br> Oh yes, quite true. Hmm, it&#39;s rather difficult to tell us apart, isn&#39;t it? Let me give myself another name.</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles (Enemy):</strong><br> I&#39;ll be Mephistopheles with \u201C(Enemy)\u201D after my name.</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles (Enemy):</strong><br> Jeanne d&#39;Arc&#39;s other half summoned me here.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Of course, just about everyone wants to stay alive,<br> and there&#39;s really nothing wrong with that.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> But for her and me...that wasn&#39;t true.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Right, Jeanne?</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> Ghh...!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Jeanne!</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> I was careless... I never expected to be forced to acknowledge her like this...!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Are you okay!?</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> ...Yes.<br> But, it looks like...I really did end up acknowledging her.</p><hr><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> But we can talk later.<br> Right now, we need to stall her!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> This is it, Mephistopheles!<br> The final showdown!</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles (Enemy):</strong><br> Indeed, indeed. Everyone, I would just like you to know that I&#39;m truly sorry about this. ...Release!</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> Khh...!</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong><br> My, my. What shall we do now, Master?</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong><br> I really must say that I think retreat remains an eminently viable option.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> ...Good point. I suppose I am in your debt.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> If you want to wake up now, that&#39;s fine with me.<br> Do that, and I&#39;ll let you go.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> It&#39;ll be just like you never had a Ruler at all.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> That&#39;ll take care of everything.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> But...if you&#39;re planning on defeating me,<br> not that you could...</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> ...Well, at that point you saving my life won&#39;t matter. You&#39;ll get no mercy from me.</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles (Enemy):</strong><br> I&#39;d get out of here if I were you.<br> Go on, other me, persuade them!</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong><br> Good point.<br> All right, here&#39;s my attempt at persuasion.</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong><br> Master, I&#39;d get out of here if I were you.</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong><br> That shock alone has already transferred over half of Jeanne&#39;s power to her Alter.</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong><br> Even if I joined you two,<br> we&#39;d all be hopelessly outmatched!</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong><br> You do remember what your obligations are as the Master destined to save humanity, don&#39;t you?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Yeah, I remember.</p><hr><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong><br> ...Then what&#39;s your answer?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I&#39;m going to save her!</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> I had a feeling you were going to say that!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I&#39;m going to fight, and I&#39;m going to win!</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong><br> I knew it!</p><hr><p><strong>Mephistopheles (Enemy):</strong><br> Oh, my, what happened, other me?<br> That wasn&#39;t very persuasive at all.</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong><br> Of course not!</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong><br> If you think this is enough to stop [\u2642 him /\u2640\uFE0F her},<br> you don&#39;t know Chaldea&#39;s Master at all!</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong><br> Wooo! That. Was. Awesooome!<br> I just wanted to say that, naturally!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Whatever you say.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Gah! My eyes!</p><hr><p><strong>Both:</strong><br> ?</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> Master, are you sure about this?</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> I&#39;m at less than half my full power right now.<br> We may both be Rulers, but she has the upper hand.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> I&#39;d bet the two Mephistopheles are evenly matched, too. There&#39;s no way we can win.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> Even knowing all that, are you sure you still want to fight?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> We&#39;ve both seen worse, right?</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> ...!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> ...!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> You didn&#39;t run.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> ...No, I didn&#39;t.</p><hr><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> That way of thinking isn&#39;t going to get you very far.<br> But, then again, that might be why I was summoned in the first place.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> Even if I am just a ghost who only happened to exist at one point...I think I can still help you.</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles (Enemy):</strong><br> So we&#39;re going to fight after all, are we?<br> What a shame.</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong><br> Indeed. I&#39;m a pacifist, I&#39;ll have you know!</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles (Enemy):</strong><br> But, I guess that&#39;s okay!</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong><br> After all, I&#39;m Mephistopheles.<br> I make fun of saints and demons alike!</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles (Enemy):</strong><br> You know it!</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles (Enemy):</strong><br> Okay, ghostly boys and girls, I hope you like playing with fire, &#39;cause the Dragon Witch is about to roast you alive!</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> ...Everything else aside, having two of him around is extremely confusing!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Couldn&#39;t agree more!</p><hr><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> ...Ugh, that clown is a real pain.<br> Well, at least I can fight jester with jester.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Now, what are we going to do about these scattered memories of yours?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Specifically, this group of ordinary,<br> decent folk whipped into a mob frenzy!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Look at the anger on their faces, just like monsters! Hmm... I think I&#39;ll go ahead and turn them into REAL monsters.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Well, Jeanne d&#39;Arc?<br> Think you can defeat me now!?</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> I don&#39;t know if I can defeat you,<br> but my pennant is telling me I have to try.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> Let&#39;s go, Master!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> The Lord forgives all sin and wickedness. He rescues the lives that crawl forth from the grave, grieves for them, and takes mercy upon them...</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles (Enemy):</strong><br> My, my, how impressive! It looks like ghosts just aren&#39;t enough to put up a decent fight anymore!</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles (Enemy):</strong><br> In that case, how about this?<br> Come on up, anonymous Servants!</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> Shadow Servants!</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong><br> What, them? Those are just a few shadows that happened to be hanging around.</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong><br> They&#39;re not even self-aware.<br> Trust me, we have nothing to worry about!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> Got you...!</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles (Enemy):</strong><br> My, my, so you did!<br> Well, Master? What&#39;s the plan now?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> ...Don&#39;t tell me you&#39;re worried I might lose?<br> You know they call me the Dragon Witch!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> I wield disaster as a weapon. I was made to sow despair wherever I so much as breathe.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> Oh no. Don&#39;t tell me...!</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong><br> Wooo! That&#39;s amazing! I haven&#39;t felt my eyes almost pop out of their sockets like that in a long time!</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> Faf...nir...!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> That&#39;s right! Fafnir, my adorable personal dragon. And this time...he&#39;s going to rid me of the righteous Holy Maiden once and for all.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> ...Even so, I am not going to lose!</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> It doesn&#39;t matter who you call to come fight on your behalf! We&#39;ll beat them all!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> What, because of God&#39;s blessing?</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> In part. The Lord is always by my side...always helping, even if only a little.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> But the other part is, of course,<br> thanks to my friends and my Master.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> They console me when I&#39;m powerless to do something,<br> and pick me up when I slump in defeat.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> That&#39;s all the salvation I need.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> I may not have been saved in history,<br> but I know their desire to help me is genuine.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> ...I see you&#39;re as much of a teacher&#39;s pet as ever.<br> God, you piss me off.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Fine, then. Let&#39;s settle this once and for all. We&#39;ll see who wins: me and my dragon, or you and your Master.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Let&#39;s have a nice pleasant duel to the death, Jeanne d&#39;Arc!</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> Just what I had in mind.<br> Come at me, Fafnir, Mephistopheles.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> Come at me...my other self who fell from grace.<br> The Alter I once so vehemently rejected!</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong><br> Wonderful. Then this will truly be the final showdown!<br> At last, her long and winding journey will come to an end!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I&#39;ll back you both up with all I&#39;ve got!</p><hr><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> No...way...</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles (Enemy):</strong><br> Welp, looks like we lost...</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles (Enemy):</strong><br> But then again, I suppose there was only so far I could go as a jester. What a shame. Maybe we should invite someone more fun to join our little party.</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles (Enemy):</strong><br> Then again, maybe the Counter Force went easy on us, pitting me against you?</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong><br> Not at all. If anything, I think it was a dreadfully cold-blooded decision. This Lord guy seems like a real sadist, if you ask me.</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong><br> After all, if I hadn&#39;t been here,<br> that woman you&#39;re with would never admit defeat.</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong><br> The fact that you and I are equally matched means that she has only herself to blame if she loses.</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles (Enemy):</strong><br> Ohhh.<br> Nooow I see!</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles (Enemy):</strong><br> Well, there you have it, Master.<br> I&#39;m so terribly sorry.</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles (Enemy):</strong><br> It may not have looked like it, but I really was doing my best out there, you know?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> How...?<br> It shouldn&#39;t have been possible for me to lose!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> You lost your power!<br> I was the one who took it!</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> I didn&#39;t defeat you alone.<br> We did it together.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> ...Yes, I did end up creating you.<br> But I didn&#39;t regret that at all.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> Instead...I was happy. Happy to know I was actually the sort of person who wanted to live on more than anything.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> Happy to know I was the sort of ordinary person who felt joy at seeing others come to her rescue.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> So I was genuinely happy to see that Master didn&#39;t think twice about saving me.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> I didn&#39;t fight as a Holy Maiden. I fought you as just another Servant, and I won. That&#39;s all there is to it.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> That isn&#39;t about faith,<br> however weak or strong it might be.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> ...What a disgrace.<br> Guess this is really it for me.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Nothing I did worked out, right to the end...</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> ...I don&#39;t know if I&#39;d say that. I did acknowledge you as the darkness that exists inside me.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> You&#39;re another side of my Heroic Spirit. You could end up getting registered as an Anti-Heroic Spirit.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> Who knows? Maybe there will come a time when your power will be exactly what is necessary to save the day.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> ...Is that supposed to be a joke? I&#39;d rather disappear forever than get dragged into something like that.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> But if I have no choice,<br> I hope I can at least change my class first.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> I&#39;m not cut out to be a Ruler.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> ...And that brings my story to a close.<br> Master...thank you for everything. Sincerely.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You know, thinking back on it now...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I kind of get the impression this was all my fault...</p><hr><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> Yes, it may well be.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> But isn&#39;t that how it is with friends and allies?<br> I know I&#39;ve made plenty of trouble for you.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> Besides...it&#39;s like I said earlier.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> This made me really happy.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> I was so happy I got to see you running in to save me.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> No other reward could possibly compare to that.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> That goes for you too, Mephistopheles.<br> I was so happy that you came to save me.</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong><br> Reeeally? I&#39;m not used to this sort of thing,<br> so I&#39;m not quite sure how to respond to that.</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong><br> But, as long as you enjoyed yourself, that&#39;s all that matters. Even better if it made you smile!</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong><br> Ahh, it really is fun being a Servant.</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong><br> This little adventure truly was like a dream come true, so to speak! Well, see you later!</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> Haha, whatever you might be, devil or otherwise...there&#39;s nothing more beautiful, or more fun, than joining forces and fighting together.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> All right, Master, what do you say we awaken from this dream?</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> Your journey to protect humanity is still far from over, after all...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> ...And so ends one of the stories of Jeanne d&#39;Arc.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Jeanne would go on to experience many things, and eventually, an Avenger of her would be born as well...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> But that...is a story for another time.</p>', 858);
