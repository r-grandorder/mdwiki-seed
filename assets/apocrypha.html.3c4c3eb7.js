I will recreate the miracle, and this time I will ascend to glory.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> In the end, that is all I can do, all I can become.<br> And so, I have no choice but to proceed.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...Oh.

Answer me...<br> Hear my call...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Hear my call, and answer me...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Who is this...?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> ...Hear me, O feeble mortal... Thou art the one who clears the path for destiny... Hear my call, and answer me.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I guess I&#39;m falling now? Or maybe just lost?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Either way, it definitely feels like I&#39;m falling from a huge height. I flail my arms and legs around...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> ...and end up sinking into a sea of darkness.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> ...Awaken, Master of Chaldea...<br> The great Master who answered my call...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Great?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Er, yeah. You\u2013I mean, you DID restore humanity, didn&#39;t you? That certainly seems great to me...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Call?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Yup, that&#39;s wh\u2013Er, rather...<br> Forsooth, great Master who hath answered my call...</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong><br> ...<br> ...Master of Chaldea...</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong><br> Has thou regained thy sense?<br> Canst thou see how many fingers I do hold before thee?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Welp, that settles it!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Oh, yeah, so I AM dreaming!</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong><br> Yea, thou art correct. This is but a dream.<br> However, it is also quite real.</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong><br> I summoned thee hither with this Holy Grail,<br> while thou yet slumbered...</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong><br> It is a complicated matter to explain, but perhaps it would be best if thou thought of thyself as a sort of mental projection of thine own form.</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong><br> Thy flesh and blood body...</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong><br> ...should yet slumber aboard the Shadow Border,<br> continuing thy journey.</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong><br> ...This world is in great peril, and to survive, it will need your\u2013er, thy help. It will need THY help. Forsooth.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> So you mean this is a job for Chaldea, huh?</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong><br> Thou dost seem perhaps TOO accustomed to this sort of thing.</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong><br> Of course, that must be exactly why it was thee,<br> among all, who was summoned here.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I&#39;m sorry, who are you again?</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong><br> ...My name is Fafnir. I am the evil dragon who once made off with the miracle of humankind.</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong><br> So, what sayest thou?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Uh, what if I say no?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I&#39;m guessing I can&#39;t leave until I solve this?</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong><br> Nay, shouldst thou choo\u2013ugh... Nope.<br> You can refuse if you want. If you do, that&#39;s that.</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong><br> ...Yeah...<br> I should&#39;ve known.</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong><br> It was incredibly arrogant of me to call you here out of nowhere and ask you to fight.</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong><br> Don&#39;t worry about it. I&#39;ll figure something else out.<br> I&#39;m terribly sorry to have bothered you like this.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> That&#39;s so considerate... Tell me what&#39;s going on.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I want to know everything that&#39;s happening here.</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong><br> ...I see.<br> Very well then, I shall start at the beginning.</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong><br> ...This is more complicated than I thought...<br> Hold on, let me just get everything straight...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> It&#39;s okay. I&#39;m not going anywhere.</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong><br> ...Uh, first off, let me explain where you are right now.</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong><br> This is the Reverse Side of the World. Hmm, or maybe a hidden place on \u201Cthe other side,\u201D so to speak, is more accurate?</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong><br> Basically, you can think of it as a mythical land and the home of magical beasts.</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong><br> Your world, the human world,<br> is built on human laws.</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong><br> ...This world, however,<br> is entirely removed from those laws.</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong><br> This may be difficult to understand, but your world came to exist once humanity had covered the entire planet, like a cloth.</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong><br> But before that could happen,<br> beings called Phantasmals fled here.</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong><br> Of course, I hear that Phantasmals have been showing up in your world again as well, now that humanity is in such disorder.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Sorry to interrupt, but...you mean like wyverns?</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong><br> Yes, that&#39;s right.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Phantasmals? Like what?</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong><br> Wyverns, bicorns, chimeras...<br> Creatures like that.</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong><br> They&#39;re supposed to live here, in this world, though. They shouldn&#39;t be visiting yours as though it were some sort of caf\xE9.</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong><br> Now, this land is in grave danger,<br> thanks to the Greater Grail I brought here.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Greater Grail...?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> As in, the one that was in Fuyuki...?</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong><br> You really DO know your stuff.</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong><br> I don&#39;t know what happened in your world, but in mine,<br> I had no choice but to bring the Greater Grail here to the Reverse Side.</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong><br> Otherwise it would have caused all kinds of problems, you see.</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong><br> There was a problem, though. A certain Noble Phantasm partially destroyed the Greater Grail.</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong><br> Even so, things were fine until now...</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong><br> ...but then, even though I didn&#39;t do anything,<br> it just kind of...broke. On its own.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Suuure it did.</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong><br> No, really, I didn&#39;t do anything.<br> I&#39;m sure I didn&#39;t...</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong><br> I may have a few gaps in my memory, but I&#39;m fairly certain nothing happened during those gaps.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> You expect me to believe that!?</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong><br> ...I mean...I don&#39;t think I did, anyway.<br> I&#39;ll admit my memory is a little hazy, but even so...</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong><br> A-at any rate, the real problem...</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong><br> ...is that a Holy Grail War is taking place inside the damaged Greater Grail.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Did you say...a Holy Grail War...?</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong><br> Yup.</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong><br> A miniature war between Servants is being waged inside the very Greater Grail they want to control.</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong><br> I haven&#39;t actually seen any of the battles myself, but I know how many there have been. Just looking at the numbers here, it&#39;s been over ten thousand now.</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong><br> At first there were only two Servants. By the 567th Holy Grail War, there were four, and by the 2313th, there were seven.</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong><br> ...That was when my control of the Greater Grail started to waver.</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong><br> That is to say, someone is trying to take over the Greater Grail and use it for themselves.</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong><br> If something isn&#39;t done, the Greater Grail will continue to spin out of control until it&#39;s completely destroyed.</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong><br> And that would be...a problem.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Problem?</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong><br> Yes, a big problem. You see, this Greater Grail isn&#39;t mine. I&#39;m just holding on to it.</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong><br> I don&#39;t have any right to use it myself,<br> and I can&#39;t let anyone else use it either.</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong><br> I have to take good care of it.</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong><br> If the Greater Grail went out of control, that would cause a great deal of trouble for all the Demonic Beasts who live here...</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong><br> It&#39;s even possible that an event like that, or its aftermath, could damage one of the anchors that holds the world together.</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong><br> If the cloth\u2013or texture, if you like\u2013is torn, the laws of physics will be turned on their heads, and the Age of Gods will end up mixing with modern times.</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong><br> And that...wouldn&#39;t end well for anybody. Humans and Demonic Beasts would only end up hurting each other.</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong><br> So I&#39;m asking you now:<br> Will you help me save this world?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...Okay, I&#39;ll give it a shot.</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong><br> Really...!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> If there&#39;s something I can do to help...</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong><br> ...!</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong><br> Thank you!!!</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong><br> [[File:berserkervoice1.png50px]][[File:berserkervoice2.png50px]]</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong><br> [[File:berserkervoice1.png50px]][[File:berserkervoice2.png50px]]</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong><br> ?<br> ???</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong><br> ...Are you okay?<br> Is something wrong?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> (Gesture at your ears)</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong><br> ...I&#39;m so sorry.</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong><br> It&#39;s been so long since I actually spoke that I&#39;ve forgotten how to do it at an appropriate volume.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> (Write on the ground)</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong><br> Oh, I see. I&#39;m sorry.<br> I guess I got a little carried away...</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong><br> Ahem. Very well then, Let me try that again:<br> I want you to ride on my back.</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong><br> We&#39;ll need to dive into the domain within the Greater Grail itself.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> So...I&#39;m gonna get to be a dragon rider!?</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong><br> Yes. You may be the first to do so since humanity began using the Gregorian calendar.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Oh man, I&#39;m gonna get to be a dragoon!</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong><br> Ah, that is a popular misconception. A \u201Cdragoon,\u201D<br> I am afraid, is not one who rides a dragon.</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong><br> Though I do admit,<br> it has a very nice ring to it.</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong><br> Anyway, just climb up and grab one of my scales. Now, hold on... This will be my first flight in over ten years!</p><h2 id="section-1-dive-inner-world" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1-dive-inner-world" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 1: Dive, Inner World</h2><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong><br> As I thought, Trifas has been recreated...along with the Assassin of Red&#39;s Hanging Gardens.</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong><br> I&#39;m surprised this world has been crafted with such detail, though... Who could have done this, and what could they be after?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Sorry, what&#39;s Trifas?</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong><br> A small city in Romania where a Great Holy Grail War took place. ...Hmm.

They disappear each morning.<br> ...Well, at six o&#39;clock in the morning, to be exact.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> We only realized this around the 734th Holy Grail War.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> Here you go.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Ooh, this is delicious.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> I&#39;m glad you think so.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> So, what did the Custodian tell you when you first arrived here?</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> I can fill in anything he may have left out.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> I see, I see...<br> Very well then, let me explain everything else.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> To begin, this is not like a typical Holy Grail War.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> It does not involve seven Masters trying to kill one another, nor even seven classes of Servants with which to do so.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> ...Ah, so you have no experience with that sort of Holy Grail War. Well, trust me when I say that that is usually how these things go.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> Now I hope you&#39;re paying attention;<br> this WILL be on the test.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> Now, this Great Holy Grail War uses the Greater Grail&#39;s emergency system from Fuyuki to wage war with fourteen Servants rather than the customary seven.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> That is to say, it is a battle between two teams of seven Servants.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> ...However, that war had in fact already concluded,<br> with Fafnir emerging as the apparent victor.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> That is how he came into possession of the Greater Grail.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> As for us, we are reproductions of the Servants who were summoned during that Great Holy Grail War.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Reproductions...?</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> In this world, the only two places that exist are the city of Trifas, and of course the Hanging Gardens.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> ...I suppose you could call this a sort of simulation.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> Aha. That seems to have helped you understand.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> Indeed, this is all one enormous simulation field designed to recreate that Great Holy Grail War.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> We were originally imitation life-forms, going through the motions of battle without thought or emotion.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> However, as this seemingly endless simulation repeated itself, something unexpected happened.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> Namely, we developed intelligence, reason,<br> and even regained our memories as Servants.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> That being said, we do not remember anything about the Great Holy Grail War.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> You might say that I&#39;m starting over from scratch.<br> At least as a Servant.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> It&#39;s only in this tiny world that we become something close to real Servants.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> Do you understand everything we&#39;ve covered so far?<br> If you have any questions, I&#39;ll be happy to answer them.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> What sort of enemy are we up against?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Who is that dragon, anyway?</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> They are reproductions, just as we are. Unlike us, though, they have nothing in the way of intellect or reason...</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> ...but what they do have are sheer numbers.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> Of the fourteen Servants who were originally summoned to the Great Holy Grail War, we now face twelve.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> That many!?</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> Yes, that many.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> As we are all starting from scratch, I&#39;m afraid I don&#39;t know any of their True Names other than the Rider on our side...</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> ...but I believe the evil dragon does.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Who is that dragon, anyway?</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> His name is Fafnir.<br> He seems to be this Greater Grail&#39;s Custodian.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> There is not a shred of doubt that he was the Great Holy Grail War&#39;s victor.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> Though I&#39;m afraid I have no idea how he secured his victory, or what he is doing in a place like this.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> What sort of enemy are we up against?</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> As the Custodian, he would like this Greater Grail to stop simulating this war.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> By rights, we should be helping him...but unfortunately, our enemies are just too strong.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> What&#39;s more, we have not a moment to waste.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> The other Servants have learned how to use their Noble Phantasms, despite still lacking consciousness.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> And that brings us to the final stage of the tens of thousands of battles to the death we fourteen Servants have fought.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> We have no choice but to repeat this battle.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> And yet, the more we fight,<br> the worse the situation becomes.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> How did you and Rider become conscious?</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> A good question.<br> We wondered about that ourselves for a time...</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> It is our belief now that the Custodian altered the simulation&#39;s parameters to make us into proper Servants.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> As the Greater Grail&#39;s Custodian, it should be well within his capabilities to recreate us in this world.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> ...Though it also seems he hesitated to do so until the very last moment.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> Had he not, we may have had a few more allies on our side.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> How about just not fighting?</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> I&#39;m afraid that would be difficult.<br> There is nowhere to seek refuge in this world.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> Though you were fortunate enough to survive tonight,<br> there is no telling what tomorrow may hold.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> They did not attack this fortress only because of the new, unexpected elements that you and Fafnir represent in the current situation.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> Most likely, that was simply a function of the battle simulation program, rather than any thought or strategy on their part.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> But the next time will be different.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> Next time, I expect they will account for Fafnir in their calculations, and mount an assault on this fortress.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Then, what can we possibly\u2013</p><p><strong>C\uFF1A???:</strong><br> We fight till the end.<br> What other choice is there?</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> So you&#39;ve returned, Rider.</p><p><strong>C\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Sure have, Teacher.</p><p><strong>C\uFF1A???:</strong><br> So, this is...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I&#39;m Fujimaru.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I&#39;m the Master of Chaldea.</p><p><strong>C\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Hmm...<br> Hmm, hmm, hmm.</p><p><strong>C\uFF1A???:</strong><br> I see, I see.<br> So you&#39;re one of those Master people!</p><p><strong>C\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Sorry to bring you here just when things couldn&#39;t get any worse.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Um, excuse me, but...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I didn&#39;t catch your name.</p><p><strong>C\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Oh, right, sorry &#39;bout that.<br> My True Name&#39;s Achilles.</p><p><strong>C\uFF1AAchilles:</strong><br> You know about the Achilles tendon in your heel, right?<br> That was named after me.</p><p><strong>C\uFF1AAchilles:</strong><br> I&#39;m the guy who was completely invincible, except for a spot on his heel. Then I freakin&#39; died when that bastard Paris shot me there with an arrow.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Oh, you mean this tendon?</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong><br> Yup, that&#39;s the one.</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong><br> Don&#39;t ever get stabbed there if you can help it.<br> Hurts like hell.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> Of course, what he didn&#39;t mention was that, after he was shot, he decided to go out in a blaze of glory, wiping out a whole squadron of enemy soldiers before finally taking his own life.</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong><br> Hell yeah! I was pretty badass back then,<br> if I do say so myself!</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong><br> I was like a writer suddenly getting a flash of inspiration the night before a big deadline.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> ...Are you something of a scatterbrain?</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong><br> What? No way!</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> Hahaha, I see you&#39;re an excellent judge of character, Master of Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> Right you are. He&#39;s surprisingly scatterbrained and quite absentminded.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> It&#39;s the one thing that hasn&#39;t changed a bit since he was alive.</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong><br> Aw, come on!</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> At any rate... Achilles, what became of Fafnir?<br> The Custodian?</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong><br> He&#39;s resting in the courtyard. Go check on him if you&#39;re worried about him, Master of Chaldea.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> It&#39;s beautiful here...</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong><br> Indeed...<br> Even if it is just an imitation of the real thing.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> How badly are you hurt?</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong><br> Quite badly, I&#39;m afraid.</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong><br> The last Noble Phantasm I took the brunt of belonged to Siegfried...the Dragon-Slayer.</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong><br> I&#39;m afraid that, being a dragon,<br> I am more vulnerable to that attack than most.</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong><br> I never thought these reproductions would ever learn how to use their originals&#39; Noble Phantasms...</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong><br> To make matters worse, we have only two Servants allied with us... Though at least they&#39;re two extremely powerful A-rank ones.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Did you make them into Servants?</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong><br> Yes, I did.</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong><br> The idea was to convert all fourteen reproductions into intelligent Servants and investigate who or what is making them fight...</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong><br> ...but that would have been a horrible decision.<br> Besides, creating intelligent beings on a whim...</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong><br> Such irresponsibility would have been too cruel.</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong><br> However, my hesitation has only ended up making the situation worse.</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong><br> I never thought they could use their Noble Phantasms despite lacking the capacity for thought...</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong><br> So in a spur-of-the-moment decision, the best I could do was turn those two reproductions into Servants.</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong><br> Even so, I&#39;m afraid that does nothing to lessen my own sins.</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong><br> I am too wounded to be able to move in this form for the time being.</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong><br> But I refuse to sit around doing nothing to help.<br> I&#39;m going to make a terminal so I can join you.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> A terminal...?</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong><br> Just a moment.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong><br> ...Mm, hmm.<br> Ahh, ahh, ahh.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong><br> ...There we go. It feels good to be back to this height,<br> and to have this voice back.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> So, you&#39;re the terminal?</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong><br> That&#39;s right.<br> This terminal&#39;s name is...Sieg.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong><br> I&#39;m afraid it can&#39;t do as much as my dragon body can, but at least this body can move.</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> So, what&#39;s going to happen to the dragon...?</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> He&#39;ll just have to go to sleep for a while.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> Well, I&#39;m not able to split my consciousness across multiple bodies...</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> Still, I can at least use my dragon body&#39;s power.<br> For brief moments, anyway.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> I&#39;m so sorry. Ever since I brought you here,<br> I&#39;ve caused you nothing but trouble.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...Well, uh, in that case...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Nice to meet you...again.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> ...Oh, right!<br> You want to shake hands. I remember now.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> I hope I didn&#39;t squeeze too hard.<br> I&#39;m still getting used to this body.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> Now then, I&#39;d like to meet with the other Servant before nightfall.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> The Archer of Black, Chiron,<br> is the wisest sage among the centaur.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> So if anyone can make a plan with the information I have, it&#39;s him.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> Maybe even one that could defeat all twelve of the other Servants, including his former allies.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> ...I&#39;ll be blunt:<br> there is no way we can win.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> I see...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I guess twelve Servants is just too tall an order...?</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> Correct. We are simply outmatched.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Even if all three of you team up?</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> I&#39;m afraid so.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> I&#39;m afraid that this was a conclusion I reached even taking you into account, Master of Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> Achilles, do you know anything about the Great Holy Grail War?</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong><br> Not really. All I know is I saw someone who looked a lot like Vlad III during the battle.</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong><br> Oh, I think I saw Atalante from the Calydonian Boar hunt too. Or at least, someone who matched my old man&#39;s description of her.</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong><br> But that&#39;s pretty much it.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> What about you, Sir Custodian?<br> Do you know anything about the other Servants?</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> ...Of course.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> All fourteen Servants are divided into two teams,<br> Black and Red.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> The Black team includes Siegfried, the Saber of Black...Vlad III, the Lancer of Black...</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> Astolfo, the Rider of Black...<br> Avicebron, the Caster of Black...</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> Frankenstein, the Berserker of Black...<br> and Jack the Ripper, the Assassin of Black.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> The Red team includes Mordred, the Saber of Red...<br> Atalante, the Archer of Red...</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> Karna, the Lancer of Red...<br> Shakespeare, the Caster of Red...</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> Spartacus, the Berserker of Red...<br> and Semiramis, the Assassin of Red.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> I see, I see. Thank you, Sir Custodian.<br> You have an excellent memory.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> ...Just call me Sieg.<br> I&#39;m not used to being called \u201CCustodian.\u201D</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> As you wish, Sir Sieg.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> Anyway, I guess you have a point... We can&#39;t possibly fight all twelve of those Servants at once.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> I guess I shouldn&#39;t have bothered trying to stop them from the outside...</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> Don&#39;t worry, Sir Sieg.<br> I am just getting started.</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong><br> Aw, crap. This is gonna be bad.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> Now, let&#39;s begin this class properly, shall we?</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> [\u2642 Sir /\u2640 Lady] Master of Chaldea,<br> would you do the honors?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Uhh... All rise!</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong><br> !</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> !</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Bow!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Be seated!</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong><br> Wait. Why are we just sitting on the floor in the throne room?</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> I&#39;m not actually certain myself, but...it seems to me this is more of a classroom right now.</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong><br> Oh. Okay. Great.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> Now then, our lesson for today will be...</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> \u201CHow to Defeat All Twelve Black and Red Enemy Servants.\u201D</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong><br> Wait, wait. I distinctly remember you saying that was impossible all of two minutes ago.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> And it is, were we to face all twelve together.<br> So, what should we do then?</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> ...Use our Noble Phantasms to take them all out at once? No, that wouldn&#39;t work.</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong><br> ...Take them out one at a time?</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> Yes, now you&#39;re getting warmer. But it would be a waste of resources to focus on only one at a time.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> That would be like swatting a fly with a sledgehammer.<br> Not to mention that the other eleven Servants are unlikely to simply wait patiently for their turn.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> So...about three at a time?</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> Well done, [\u2642 Sir /\u2640 Lady] Fujimaru.<br> A gold star for you.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> Achilles and I will team up to hold back nine of the Servants.</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong><br> Bwa?</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> In the meantime, the two of you will defeat the remaining three. Simple, right?</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> Are you kidding? That&#39;s absurd.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> I assure you, it is not absurd in the slightest.</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong><br> Whoa, whoa, whoa!</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong><br> Hold on a minute, Teacher.</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong><br> Having these two take out three Servants at once is absurd enough, but how are the two of us going to hold back the other nine while they do!?</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong><br> Did you forget they can use their Noble Phantasms now!?</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> Of course not. But based on what I saw last night, they are very obvious about when they are going to do so.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> A Noble Phantasm is, after all,<br> a weakness as much as a trump card.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> And right now, our enemies use them for no other reason than simply because they can.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> So you&#39;re saying you want us to anticipate when they&#39;re about to use their Noble Phantasms and...just dodge?</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> Correct. You may be a little green now, Sir Custodi\u2013Sir Sieg, but by nightfall, I will have trained you to see the signs of an imminent Noble Phantasm.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> ...I see.<br> By nightfall, you say? Then, that means...</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong><br> (Oh great. Here comes the crash course...<br> I just know it.)</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> Achilles... Achilles... I&#39;m told you wish to become a great hero, and that you want to do so as fast as you possibly can.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> To be a hero, you will need good judgment and proper analytical faculties.</p><p><strong>C\uFF1AEight-Year-Old Achilles:</strong><br> Yes, Teacher!</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> I promise that once you complete these trials,<br> you will be a full-fledged hero.</p><p><strong>C\uFF1AEight-Year-Old Achilles:</strong><br> Yay! That&#39;s what I want!</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> Then for the next twenty-four hours,<br> from this moment onward...</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> ...I want you to dodge every single one of my attacks.</p><p><strong>C\uFF1AEight-Year-Old Achilles:</strong><br> Bwa?</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong><br> (Next thing I knew, Chiron was shooting hundreds of arrows at me in that narrow cave. I still remember what he said...)</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong><br> (\u201CDon&#39;t worry! Once you can alter the trajectories of ten out of every hundred arrows, you&#39;ll be dodging all of them in no time!\u201D)</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong><br> (\u201CIt should be well within your capabilities thanks to that superhuman speed of yours!\u201D)</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong><br> (\u201CBesides, none of them have arrowheads, so they won&#39;t kill you. They will just sting quite a lot!\u201D)</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong><br> (\u201CWhat&#39;s that? You would actually prefer a more slow and steady approach instead? Hmm... I see...\u201D)</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong><br> (\u201CI think that would suit me better as well.<br> This is certainly not an ideal way to educate you.\u201D)</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong><br> (\u201CHowever, since we have precious little time, we should spend it polishing this method to the fullest.\u201D)</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong><br> Hey, Custod\u2013I mean, Sieg?</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> Hm?</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong><br> Just...don&#39;t die, okay?</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> ...Of course. I&#39;ll make sure I survive (both tonight and tomorrow night).</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong><br> Right on!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I get the feeling you two aren&#39;t quite on the same page...</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> Until now, the reproductions have simply come back to life whenever they are defeated.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> In a system like that,<br> there can be neither failure nor victory.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> But now that the Greater Grail&#39;s Custodian, Sir Sieg, and [\u2642 Sir /\u2640 Lady] Fujimaru, the observer, are here...</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> ...there is a very good chance that we can break this stalemate.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> [\u2642 Sir /\u2640 Lady] Fujimaru, why don&#39;t you get some sleep? You will need to be well rested for tonight&#39;s battle.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Okay, will do.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I&#39;m exhausted...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> So...sleepy...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> ...Again.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> ...Again.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> ...Again, again, again.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Come, let us battle to the death.<br> Let us fight, and grow purer.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Go forth and recreate that battle,<br> for it still has yet to be settled.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Recreate, recreate, recreate...and then,<br> I will obtain what I seek.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Still afternoon, huh...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> THAT was a weird dream...</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> (Huff, huff, huff...)</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> Oh, are you up already, Master?<br> We still have some time before the battle begins.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> Hmm. You still have a ways to go, Sir Sieg,<br> but I suppose we can take a short break.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> Thank...you...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Are you okay!?</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> More or less.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> Chiron was kind enough to stop before he actually killed me.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> In the meantime, Achilles and I will set about preparing our trap.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> What trap?</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> A Bounded Field, to make it easier to separate our enemies.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> Specifically, to cut off the nine Servants Achilles and I will be holding back from the three that you two will defeat.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> ...No doubt the enemy Casters will move to dispel the field, but I believe it will take them some time.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> I&#39;m fairly sure the Caster of Black, Avicebron,<br> is ill-equipped to deal with such things.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> And Shakespeare&#39;s...well...</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> Indeed, I cannot imagine that either of them has the skills needed to disable a Bounded Field.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> Very well then, we will return shortly.<br> Achilles, come and help me.</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong><br> Nine Servants... If I handle Karna and Semiramis,<br> and ignore all the other attacks...</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> Achilles!</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong><br> Gah!!!</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong><br> What is it, Teacher?<br> I was just thinking about how I&#39;m gonna fight them all!</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> I need your help to create the Bounded Field.</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong><br> Huh? But I&#39;m no good at that sort of thing.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> I know.<br> That&#39;s why I&#39;m asking you.</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong><br> A-ANOTHER lesson? Now!?</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> But of course. Planning your strategy before a battle is one of the most important steps toward victory. As such, you will continue to do so while you help me prepare the Bounded Field spell.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> We will be facing nine at once. A split-second decision will mean the difference between life and death.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> Getting accustomed to thinking about several different things at once now will aid your decision-making capabilities later. It is a part of your training.</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong><br> Okay, okay, I&#39;ll do it already!</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong><br> I swear, I can&#39;t let my guard down for a moment around you...</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> What&#39;s up?</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> Oh, it&#39;s nothing. I was just thinking how well that teacher and student complement one another.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> ...Chiron was the Archer of Black,<br> and Achilles the Rider of Red.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> They were, in fact, enemies during the Great Holy Grail War.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> As I recall, Achilles was born to a god... As such, he isn&#39;t easy to harm without possessing Divinity as well.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> And the only Servant on the Black side who did...was Chiron.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> Of course, Chiron isn&#39;t one to pull his punches,<br> even when facing one of his former pupils.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> I wasn&#39;t able to see it for myself,<br> but I&#39;m told theirs was an incredibly fearsome battle.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You really know your stuff.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> Well, I did survive the Great Holy Grail War myself, though not because I was particularly strong.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> ...I wasn&#39;t even a Master.<br> I just... How do I put this...</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> I suppose I was very lucky.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> I wasn&#39;t very skilled, nor did I have the sort of charisma needed to command a Servant.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Could you tell me more about what happened?</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> ...Yes, I suppose I should.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> I don&#39;t think it will be especially useful, but now that I&#39;ve summoned you here, the least I can do is answer your questions.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> I am an artificially created life-form called a homunculus.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> Huh? You thought homunculi were enemies that looked like snowmen?</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> ...I&#39;m afraid I don&#39;t know anything about that. I can only assume those homunculi were made some other way.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> They do say that we\u2013well, the Yggdmillennia production process was the work of a distinguished family of alchemists.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> As for me, an Yggdmillennia mage created me so that I could provide magical energy.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> ...It takes a vast amount of magical energy to keep a Servant materialized, to say nothing of using their Noble Phantasm.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> So there were a lot of other homunculi besides me who were all here at this fortress to provide the Servants with magical energy.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> Over half of them ended up wrung completely dry of magical energy and died...but I ran away.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> ...All because I didn&#39;t want to die.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...You say that like it&#39;s a bad thing.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> Ah...</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> I guess...I would be lying if I said I didn&#39;t feel guilty.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> Both about abandoning everyone so I could survive...and that I am still alive now...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Do you regret that?</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> ...That&#39;s a difficult question,<br> but...I don&#39;t think so.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> This Greater Grail is precious. Every Servant who fought in the war risked their lives for it.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> I can&#39;t let it fall into the wrong hands.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> ...Tonight&#39;s Great Holy Grail War is about to begin.<br> Are you ready, Achilles?</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong><br> Hell yeah I am!</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> We will hold off nine of the hostile Servants,<br> and you will defeat three of them.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> Sir Sieg, [\u2642 Sir /\u2640 Lady] Fujimaru, are you ready?</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> I am.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> All set!</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> Good.<br> I wish you luck.</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong><br> Don&#39;t worry. You can always shout for help if things go sideways!</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong><br> But hey, I&#39;m sure things&#39;ll work out somehow!</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> All right...let&#39;s go!</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> ...Screen spell, Asteri Amina.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> Good, they&#39;ve been separated.<br> Now it&#39;s time to lure them out.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> We shall do our utmost to ensure that [\u2642 Sir /\u2640 Lady] Fujimaru and Sir Sieg are able to defeat their targets without drawing attention to themselves.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> And of course, do take care not to destroy the wall.</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong><br> Man, that&#39;s a lotta stuff to keep track of. This is already tough, and you&#39;re not exactly making it easier!</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> Hahaha, don&#39;t worry. I have less practical experience in battle than you do.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> If anything, I will be counting on YOU to show ME the ropes.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> Okay, I see three of them.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> The Caster of Red, the Caster of Black,<br> and the Assassin of Black, huh?</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> They are not quite as strong as many of the others, but they are still quite formidable.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> ...Make sure to watch out for the Assassin,<br> Jack the Ripper, in particular.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Yeah, I, uh...I know.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> Good.<br> ...Let&#39;s go, Master!</p><h2 id="section-3-are-you-our-mommy" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-3-are-you-our-mommy" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 3: Are You Our Mommy?</h2><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> How do you like that!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...It&#39;s morning!</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> Sir Sieg!

It&#39;ll all work out.<br> That&#39;s what my gut says, and it hasn&#39;t failed me yet.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> ...I hope you&#39;re right...</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong><br> Man, Sieg, you&#39;re a bit of a downer, aren&#39;t you?<br> Why all the pessimism?</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> I can&#39;t help but be anxious. Not with the Greater Grail&#39;s fate resting on my shoulders.</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong><br> What&#39;s the big deal?<br> It&#39;s yours to do with as you want, right?</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong><br> If worse comes to worst,<br> couldn&#39;t you just smash it and call it a day?</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> No, I couldn&#39;t.<br> That...that&#39;s the one thing I can&#39;t do.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> Hmm.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> There must be something driving the Servant copies,<br> though I&#39;m afraid I don&#39;t know what it may be...</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> At any rate, why don&#39;t we take the rest of today off?</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> ...After we prepare another screen spell,<br> just in case they&#39;ll fall for the same trick.</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong><br> ...You mean I have to do all that AGAIN!?</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> Sir Sieg, would you be so kind as to accompany<br> [\u2642 Sir /\u2640 Lady] Fujimaru back to the fortress?</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> Of course.<br> Shall we, Fujimaru?</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> ...Now that I think about it, it seems rude to call you by your name. How should I address you?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You can call me whatever you want, really.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> I see...<br> Then I&#39;ll try to think of something that suits me.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> I&#39;m going to check up on my real body.<br> Go ahead and get some rest.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> I don&#39;t think you&#39;ll have to worry about getting hungry while you&#39;re here...</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> ...but if you feel like eating something, I&#39;d be happy to bring you some food from the communal kitchen.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I&#39;m fine, thank you.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> I see.<br> Then please get some rest.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> Sweet dreams.<br> ...That does have a nice ring to it.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> You know, I think I would like to grab a bite.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> Understood.<br> I&#39;ll bring it to you while you sleep.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> So sleepy again...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Mo...mmy...<br> Mommy.

Though perhaps Caster of Red would better suit me here?</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong><br> Oh, hello there!<br> I see, so you&#39;re the Greater Grail&#39;s Custodian.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong><br> And you must be the Master of Chaldea he summoned!</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong><br> ...I see, I see. So you have come to save the Custodian&#39;s bacon, as it were.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong><br> Hahahaha, how wonderful, how fantastic!<br> What an extraordinary life you must lead!</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong><br> Please allow me to mark this occasion by quoting a line from one of my many famou\u2013</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Do you ever shut up?</p><p><strong>Avicebron:</strong><br> So the only ones who came back to life were those of us you two fought last night?</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> Exactly.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> Now, I have a question for all of you:<br> Do you recall why you were summoned here?</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong><br> Not at all, no.</p><p><strong>Avicebron:</strong><br> Likewise.</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong><br> No idea. A Holy Grail War?<br> ...No, that&#39;s not it.</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong><br> We don&#39;t sense any bloodlust or animosity,<br> even though you&#39;re Servants.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> This is quite a surprise...</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> I did consider this possibility, but I never thought we would be joined by three more Servants all at once.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> This is certainly a welcome change in our situation.</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong><br> Hell yeah! Now this is more like it!</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> Sir Shakespeare.<br> Sir Avicebron.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> And...um...</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong><br> Us? We&#39;re Jack the Ripper.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong><br> You&#39;re whom!?</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong><br> The hell!?</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> Well now, it seems this is a day of surprises.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> ...That&#39;s true. When you think about it,<br> this really IS surprising.</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong><br> Mommyyy, everyone&#39;s looking at us funny...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Okay guys, no more staring.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> It&#39;s okay, Jack. Come here.</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong><br> &#39;kaaay.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> I didn&#39;t know she was so attached...</p><p><strong>Avicebron:</strong><br> Chiron, perhaps you can explain what&#39;s going on here in a way that all of us can understand?</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> Very well then, I shall do my best to be concise.</p><p><strong>Avicebron:</strong><br> Now...</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong><br> ...I...</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong><br> ...see.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> Sir Sieg. [\u2642 Sir /\u2640 Lady] Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> It seems that the other Servants will return to our side once you have defeated them.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> This should give us more than even odds against the remaining nine Servants.</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong><br> Yeah, I&#39;d say things are looking up now.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong><br> Teacher? May I say something?</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong><br> The difficulty here is that I am afraid Avicebron and I are simply not at all suited for combat.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> No need to worry about that, Sir Shakespeare.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> Master Fujimaru and Sir Sieg know very well what you can and cannot do, and are sure to provide expert guidance.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> Th-that&#39;s a pretty tall order...<br> But I&#39;ll do what I can.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> Are you up for this, Fujimaru?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> We&#39;ll figure something out...I think.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong><br> I see, I see. In that case, dear patrons, we gladly offer our services for you to employ as you see fit!</p><p><strong>Avicebron:</strong><br> Thank you for having us.</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong><br> What should we do, Mommy and Mr. Custodian?</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> Okay, well first let&#39;s figure out how we can best incorporate them into our plan for tonight.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I&#39;ll start by keeping an eye on Shakespeare.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Can&#39;t have a certain genius writer slacking off.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> Good point.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> Speaking for myself, though, I just want to make sure you don&#39;t do anything that would complicate the situation further.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong><br> I&#39;m glad to know you two trust me so implicitly!</p><p><strong>Avicebron:</strong><br> What in the world did you do?</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong><br> Hey! Mr. Custodian!</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> Y-yes?</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong><br> Are you avoiding us?</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> No, of course I&#39;m\u2013</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> No, I guess I am, aren&#39;t I?<br> I&#39;m sorry if I hurt your feelings.</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong><br> Did we try to kill each other or something?</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> Yes. I...I&#39;m afraid I saw what happened in your past.</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong><br> Hmm. Now we understand.<br> What did you think about it?</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> I thought...it was horrible.</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong><br> Yes, we guess it was.<br> But why does it bother you, Mr. Custodian?</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong><br> Why would other people&#39;s pasts or memories matter to you?</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> Well, I care...</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> I wanted to save all of you.</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong><br> Even though we&#39;re here now because you couldn&#39;t save us?</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> ...That&#39;s true. You&#39;re right about that.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> Hmm, what&#39;s the expression for this again?<br> I think it&#39;s...</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong><br> Feeling down?</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> Not exactly, but it&#39;s close...</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong><br> At a loss for words?</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> That&#39;s it.</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong><br> We see. So we lost.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> Well, technically speaking,<br> I wasn&#39;t the one who beat you...</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> ...but I WAS there when you fell.</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong><br> That&#39;s okay. We were fighting a Holy Grail\u2013a Great Holy Grail War, right?</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong><br> Everybody tries to kill everybody else in those.</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong><br> But, we were on the Black team, right?<br> So why were we fighting you?</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong><br> Didn&#39;t Mr. Chiron say you were on the Black team too?</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> ...It&#39;s kind of a long story.<br> Do you still want to hear it?</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong><br> Nuh-uh!</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> Got it.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> Why don&#39;t we talk about something else, then?<br> How does that sound?</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong><br> Sure!<br> As long as it&#39;s not about doctors or London!</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> All right then, let&#39;s see...<br> I know, what about food?</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> ...I didn&#39;t realize we&#39;d been talking for so long.</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong><br> Oh, it&#39;s Mommy! Hi, Mommy!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> We&#39;d better get going.</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong><br> It&#39;s gonna be night soon?<br> Okay, let&#39;s go!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> It&#39;s almost time for the next battle.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> Right.<br> Let&#39;s give it our all!</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong><br> Yeah!</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> All right, our plan for tonight is essentially the same as yesterday. We will lure three enemy Servants out and distract the others so they don&#39;t interfere.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> But tonight, I won&#39;t ask Sir Sieg and Master Fujimaru to handle the three Servants all on their own.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> Achilles, I want you to go with them while I handle the diversion.</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong><br> Really? You sure?</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> Avicebron, I want you to summon as many golems as you can and have them follow my lead.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> As for Shakespeare... Why don&#39;t you cast Enchant on whichever side you think would provide the most entertainment?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> That&#39;s your plan for him!?</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong><br> Most happily! In that case,<br> I shall go with Fujimaru, naturally!</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong><br> For [\u2642 his /\u2640 her] side looks to be entertaining indeed!</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> You see? It worked out nicely.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> ...Chiron&#39;s actually quite cunning...</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong><br> Of course, do be aware that I absolutely will not be taking part in the fighting myself!</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong><br> Teacher! Teacher!<br> We wanna fight with Mommy too!</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> I&#39;m sorry, Jack, but I&#39;m afraid that would leave a hole in our defenses.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> And that would only make trouble for your mother.</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong><br> Aww...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Please, Jack?</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong><br> Oh, all right, Mommy!<br> We&#39;ll go do our best to dismember them all!</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> I&#39;m surprised she&#39;s so obedient...</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong><br> All right then, Sieg and Master,<br> let&#39;s get this party started!</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong><br> Hm? Ah, it&#39;s no big deal. I can tell you&#39;re a good Master from the way you fought last night.</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong><br> So, y&#39;know, it just makes sense for me to take my orders from you!</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong><br> But hey, don&#39;t worry about me.<br> You don&#39;t need to change anything you&#39;re doing.</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong><br> Just keep following your own path,<br> and I&#39;ll clear the way for you.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Thank you.</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong><br> No problem!<br> Trust me, I got it covered!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Would you happen to know the Queen of the Amazons?</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong><br> Y-yes, I do.</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong><br> Wait. Don&#39;t tell me she&#39;s on the enemy side? She&#39;s not, right? Huh? She could be summoned to Chaldea at some point?</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong><br> N-no. That&#39;s fine. I&#39;m fine. This is fine...<br> Everything...everything is fine. Yes.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> ...This feels so strange.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> Hm? What do I mean? Well, during the Great Holy Grail War, I never directly interacted with Achilles.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> I never thought I&#39;d end up fighting alongside him.<br> This should make for some good memories.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Memories?</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> Well, yeah. It&#39;s nice having memories like this, isn&#39;t it? Far as I&#39;m concerned, you can never have too many.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> Especially in my case,<br> since I don&#39;t have all that many to begin with.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> All right, let&#39;s get to fighting. There&#39;s no way we can lose with this team, no matter who we&#39;re up against.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> ...At least, I hope so.</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong><br> Well that doesn&#39;t sound good.<br> What&#39;s up? You worried about something?</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> Honestly, I&#39;ve got a bad feeling about this.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> It&#39;s great that all three Servants we defeated came over to our side. That&#39;s certainly the best outcome we could&#39;ve wished for.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> But...that&#39;s also why I&#39;m worried.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> I can&#39;t see us having that kind of luck twice.</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong><br> ...Yeah, I guess you&#39;ve got a point there.<br> In fact, I&#39;ve been feeling the same thing.</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong><br> And I&#39;m sure that means we&#39;re going to be facing some tough opponents! We&#39;re counting on you, Master!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I-I&#39;ll do my best!</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> All right, tonight&#39;s Great Holy Grail War is about to begin. Good luck to you all!</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong><br> Very well then, my boon companions! Cry havoc and let slip the dogs of war!

But at least while we were fighting them,<br> it was clear they were enemies.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> And since it wasn&#39;t possible to talk with them,<br> fighting was the only choice we had.</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong><br> Still...don&#39;t you think it&#39;s strange?</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong><br> Normally, no one can so much as scratch me unless they&#39;ve got divine blood...</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong><br> ...but those guys practically beat me black and blue back there.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> Yes, I see what you mean.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> It&#39;s possible there&#39;s more to Atalante and Spartacus&#39;s legends than we know...</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> ...but there&#39;s absolutely no way Frankenstein could secretly have divine blood.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> Her origin is too modern, and the circumstances of her creation rule it out entirely.</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong><br> Maybe so, but I can still feel the spikes from that mace of hers when she smacked me with the thing!</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong><br> That would&#39;ve caved in anyone else&#39;s rib cage.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> Are you still alive, Achilles?</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong><br> Last I checked.<br> How &#39;bout you, Teacher?</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> I am, yes, as you see.<br> Though I am considerably worse for wear.</p><p><strong>Avicebron:</strong><br> I&#39;m afraid it was all my golems could do just to hold back one of the enemy Servants.</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong><br> Are you okay, Mommy?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> What about you, Jack?

You don&#39;t really think I&#39;ve been switched out for my evil doppelg\xE4nger, do you!?</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong><br> Hmm, then again, he was me in every sense, a perfect facsimile, so I may not be altogether credible here...</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong><br> That is, aside from the fact that he never said a word, and was shrouded in a most ominous aura...</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong><br> Still, were one to suggest I might become a more complete version of myself by defeating...myself, I could hardly gainsay them.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong><br> Uh-oh.

If they&#39;re even stronger next time...we might not be able to beat them.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Even so, our job hasn&#39;t changed.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> [\u2642 Sir /\u2640 Lady] Fujimaru is right.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> No matter what they may come at us with,<br> this is the only viable strategy we have.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> We will just have to have faith that our opponent&#39;s strength is not without limit.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> Very well then, [\u2642 Sir /\u2640 Lady] Fujimaru\u2013No,<br> on second thought, perhaps I should address you as...</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> ...our Master.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> We will be counting on you once again in the next battle as well.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Rider, it was fine with me.

You have my word on that.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> So please, just think of this as an unusually long dream.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> If things take a turn for the worse,<br> all you have to do is wake up.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Thank you.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> Don&#39;t thank me. I&#39;m the one who dragged you into all this, after all.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> But never mind that. I&#39;d love to hear more about your world. I&#39;m especially interested in what you were like before you became a Master.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You know, come to think of it...</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> Hm?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You don&#39;t talk like you do when you&#39;re a dragon.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> Oh, that? Well...</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> Nobody in my world had ever summoned a Master before, so...</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> ...I gave it some thought and figured I should try to act...appropriate for that form, I suppose?</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> In hindsight, I guess I might&#39;ve sounded kind of silly, though...</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> I mean, all that faux Old English and such...what was I thinking? It&#39;s embarrassing!</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> Please...just do me a favor and forget all that?</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> Ah!</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> Somebody&#39;s attacking me in the courtyard!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Let&#39;s go!</p><p><strong>Fran:</strong><br> Ughhh...

Sorry...</p><p><strong>Fran:</strong><br> Ugh...<br> Uhh...</p><p><strong>Spartacus:</strong><br> Hmm. So that means...<br> Yes, it would seem this dragon is an oppress\u2013</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> No! No oppressors here!</p><p><strong>Spartacus:</strong><br> Oppressor... Not an oppressor...<br> Hmm, that&#39;s a difficult question.</p><p><strong>Spartacus:</strong><br> After all, I came to this land to fight,<br> to overthrow my enemies.</p><p><strong>Spartacus:</strong><br> So would it not follow that the dragon IS a symbol of the oppressors here?</p><p><strong>Fran:</strong><br> Uhh...</p><p><strong>Spartacus:</strong><br> ...He&#39;s not an oppressor?<br> Very well, then I shall wait.</p><p><strong>Spartacus:</strong><br> The oppressors are sure to come. When they do, that is when I shall act, and my songs of triumph ring forth.</p><p><strong>Spartacus:</strong><br> In the meantime...I will wait here,<br> in this flower garden.</p><p><strong>Spartacus:</strong><br> Good night, sweet rebellion.</p><p><strong>Fran:</strong><br> Ugh!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> There, there.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Easy now.</p><p><strong>Spartacus:</strong><br> Zzz...</p><p><strong>Fran:</strong><br> Ugh... Uhh...</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> So they&#39;ve both fallen asleep, huh...<br> Oh well, they should wake up once night falls.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> Anyway, if they&#39;ve both been summoned,<br> then she must have been as well...</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong><br> Achilles, was it?<br> Do I have something on my face?</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong><br> Are you the same Atalante my old man told me about?</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong><br> ...Ah, I see. So you&#39;re Peleus&#39;s son.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong><br> I remember beating him in a wrestling match once.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong><br> That was a good match.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> Atalante, I&#39;m sorry to impose,<br> but would you help me build the trap for tonight?</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> Your skills as a huntress likely make you far better at placing a trap in a forest than I.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong><br> Very well.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong><br> ...I must ask, though:<br> Why was I resummoned?</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong><br> Actually, was I even properly summoned to begin with?</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong><br> If we are inside the Greater Grail now,<br> then what am I supposed to do?</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> I believe we are meant to fight in order to keep the Greater Grail safe. Even if we were indeed enemies in the original war.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong><br> ...Well, that is no matter. I have had plenty of other former enemies become allies before.</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong><br> You and I were both Red,<br> so I guess we were always allies.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong><br> So, the immortal Achilles is my ally now, huh?<br> Usually I would find that encouraging...</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong><br> ...but if all our opponents have Divinity,<br> that does not offer much of an advantage.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> Perhaps, but even without his invincibility,<br> he is far more powerful than any of them.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> ...Indeed, it is quite fortunate that Achilles is not on their side.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> Especially since we are the only ones on our side with divine blood at the moment.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong><br> I must say, it is an odd feeling to know that a copy of myself fights for our enemy...</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong><br> Achilles, be sure you do not drag my corpse around the fortress.</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong><br> I&#39;m not gonna do that!</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong><br> If I was ever going to do something like that,<br> it&#39;d be as a Berserker!</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong><br> Haha, I was just kidding.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong><br> ...Since I am based on the data from before the Great Holy Grail War began, my Spirit Origin has no recollection of this...</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong><br> ...but I imagine we must have exchanged similar quips before, given that we were both part of the Red camp.</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong><br> Yeah, we probably did.</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong><br> You know, I was hoping I&#39;d get to meet you someday.<br> My old man used to talk about you all the time.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong><br> ...Stop that. It is embarrassing.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> Ah, youth is such a splendid thing...</p><p><strong>Avicebron:</strong><br> I do not believe Servants are either truly old or young. ...Hmm.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> Is something wrong?</p><p><strong>Avicebron:</strong><br> No, there&#39;s just something nagging me about Shakespeare.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> Did you find some evidence that he is an imposter?</p><p><strong>Avicebron:</strong><br> No, nothing like that.</p><p><strong>Avicebron:</strong><br> What troubles me is that the enemy version of him decided to come to the fortress.</p><p><strong>Avicebron:</strong><br> If it had been any other Servant...</p><p><strong>Avicebron:</strong><br> ...we might have faced eradication.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> Hmm. I see.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> ...In that case, I&#39;ll speak to Master,<br> and see if we can&#39;t stay one step ahead.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> All right.<br> ...Let&#39;s go!</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong><br> Good luck! May fortune smile on you all!</p><p><strong>Avicebron:</strong><br> I doubt you&#39;ll need us on the front lines anymore,<br> so I&#39;ll stay here and await your return.</p><p><strong>Avicebron:</strong><br> Along with my golems, of course.</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong><br> Okay Mommy, let&#39;s gooo!</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> Atalante.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> We&#39;re counting on you!</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong><br> Right.<br> To the twin gods I offer this...</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong><br> Phoebus Catastrophe!</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong><br> ...Tch, a Noble Phantasm!</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> That must be Rider...Astolfo&#39;s Noble Phantasm.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> His hippogriff can pass through any kind of attack.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong><br> In that case, we just continue to attack until it rematerializes. Come, Chiron!</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> Right there with you!</p><p><strong>Spartacus:</strong><br> There you are, oppressors! So you&#39;ve decided to take cover in the night and strike at us from the shadows, have you!?</p><p><strong>Spartacus:</strong><br> That will not protect you from the destruction of my love!</p><p><strong>Spartacus:</strong><br> Good mooorniiing, rebellion!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Well, you&#39;ve certainly got greetings covered...</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong><br> ...All right, let&#39;s split &#39;em up like we always\u2013Huh!?</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> This...this is my Bounded Field!<br> So they DID learn how to separate us!</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> Sir Sieg! Master!</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> ...It seems Chiron was right about the enemy appearing within the fortress.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> Assassin...I mean, Jack the Ripper.</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong><br> Yes, yes! We&#39;re here, Mr. Custodian.<br> What is it?</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> Can you tell me what the enemies you saw looked like?</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong><br> Okay. Let&#39;s see...</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong><br> There were two Sabers with heavy armor,<br> and a Lancer who seemed kind of girly...</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong><br> Hmm. Maybe he was actually a Rider?</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> If he was short, then he couldn&#39;t have been either of the two Lancers.</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong><br> Then he must&#39;ve been the Rider of Black.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> ...I see.</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong><br> Oh, we also saw a few things that looked like Shadow Servants.</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong><br> We were there too, so we think...they&#39;re probably leftovers from last time or something?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> How strong were they?</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong><br> Not strong at all! They were easy!</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong><br> We can dismember all of them for you in no time!</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> All right, then we take out any enemies that make their way here, and continue to protect the Casters.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> Since we expected something like this might happen,<br> we shouldn&#39;t have anything to worry about.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> Fujimaru, go ahead and tell us what to do!</p><p><strong>Fran:</strong><br> Ugggh!</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong><br> We&#39;re counting on you, Mommy!<br> Okay, time to go ripping!</p><h2 id="section-5-chiron-the-sage-s-combat-exercise" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-5-chiron-the-sage-s-combat-exercise" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 5: Chiron the Sage&#39;s Combat Exercise</h2><p><strong>Jack:</strong><br> Dismembeeer!!!

I don&#39;t care if I&#39;m mistaken.<br> I don&#39;t care if I&#39;m deluded. I&#39;m fine with this.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> So don&#39;t worry about me.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> ...Captured.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Knight of the Round Table, traitor, the one who ended the reign of King Arthur, hero of red lightning, usurper of the throne, curse of the King of Knights.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Mordred.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Yeah! Good luck to you too!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> ...Captured.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> The legend of Charlemagne, troublemaker, absent of reason, devoted Samaritan, knight of miracles.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Astolfo.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Only three Servants left.<br> It won&#39;t be much longer now.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> ...It will be a bit of a wait, though.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I believe humans will make it here eventually, so I&#39;m willing to wait until they do. Even if it takes a hundred, a thousand, or ten thousand years.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Still, if I have any regrets...<br> Well, it would be nice to talk to someone.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Homunculus, human, Servant...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> As long as we could just talk about anything,<br> really, I wouldn&#39;t care who it was with.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> ...That wish already came true with astonishing ease.<br> I know so many things.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I know their memories from the Great Holy Grail War.<br> I know all their data. I even know how each of them met their ends.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Of course, there&#39;s no need to say any of that,<br> and I don&#39;t plan on doing so.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> It&#39;s just...none of the Servants who gathered here knew about the Great Holy Grail War.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I&#39;m guessing they don&#39;t have the data from it. They&#39;re the same as they were on the first day of the war.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Hiya, people I&#39;ve never met!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> ...That explains why he reacted that way.<br> It&#39;s still kind of sad, though.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> Nice to meet you.<br> You must be Astolfo.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> And you two must be...</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> ...Well? What&#39;s goin&#39; on here, Custodian?<br> Just give us the quick version, yeah?</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> Of course. I was just about to.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> I see. So that is why both the Black and Red camps have gathered here.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> Very well, I shall lend you my aid.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> Thank you.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> So this isn&#39;t the Great Holy Grail War?<br> Damn. What a drag.</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong><br> Go ahead and sit the rest out if you want.<br> Not like one more Saber&#39;s gonna make a difference.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> ...What was that? You wanna fight or something, punk?</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong><br> Hey, so you DO get it!</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong><br> Things are getting worse by the day around here.<br> It&#39;s all we can do just to keep our heads above water.</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong><br> If you&#39;re not gonna help us fight, then get lost.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> ...Now I get it. &#39;Course, it was pretty obvious just looking at you.</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong><br> Oh yeah?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> You&#39;re pissin&#39; me off. C&#39;mon. Let&#39;s go.<br> You and me. No weapons. Just fists.</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong><br> Now you&#39;re talking...!</p><p><strong>Fran:</strong><br> Uhhh!!!</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> Hey! What was that for, Frankenstein!?<br> That really hurt!</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> Huh?<br> ...Don&#39;t fight in the courtyard?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> It&#39;s small, and if we fight, we&#39;ll kill the flowers?</p><p><strong>Fran:</strong><br> Uh!</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> ...Tch.<br> Fine, whatever.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> You heard her.<br> If we&#39;re gonna do this, we gotta take it outside.</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong><br> ...Eh, pass. Moment&#39;s gone.<br> She took all the fun out of it.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> Oh yeah?</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> I&#39;m glad to see such esteemed heroes getting along so well.</p><p><strong>Both:</strong><br> The hell we are!</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> Not to worry. You&#39;ll get along fine once you start fighting side by side, whether you like it or not.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> And I will not take no for an answer.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong><br> Heh... It seems things worked out nicely.</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong><br> Gimme a break...</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> Took the words right outta my mouth.<br> Now then.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> Custodian, have you started losing ownership of the Greater Grail, or not?</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> I have, yes. I&#39;m steadily losing control.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Why didn&#39;t you say so sooner!?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> Then there&#39;s no point in fighting these guys off.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> I see. Then what do you suggest?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> Oh come the hell on. You&#39;re telling me the \u201CGreat Sage\u201D hasn&#39;t figured this out? The only thing still left is the Hanging Gardens.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> Yes, I suppose you&#39;re right. I&#39;d been putting it off because of how dangerous it is...</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> ...but now that we have this many capable fighters on our side, attacking it has become a viable option.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> However, I believe the Hanging Gardens is the Assassin of Red...Semiramis&#39;s Noble Phantasm. Correct, Sir Sieg?</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> Yes.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> As long as she&#39;s in that garden,<br> Semiramis is as powerful as a Ruler.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> Back when we were fighting her,<br> all she did was just bombard us from her garden.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> But, if we board the garden ourselves,<br> it will be a different matter.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> All twelve of us will have to focus on defending ourselves when we&#39;re there.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> Our chances of victory are...slim at best.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong><br> Why do we not simply attack now, before nightfall?</p><p><strong>Avicebron:</strong><br> I actually tried sending a flying golem in there yesterday, at Chiron&#39;s behest...</p><p><strong>Avicebron:</strong><br> ...but as soon as night fell,<br> it was teleported back to the surface.</p><p><strong>Avicebron:</strong><br> So we believe that our enemy has already taken measures against a daytime attack.</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong><br> Shoulda figured it wouldn&#39;t be that easy.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong><br> Yes, that WILL make this very difficult...</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong><br> I have only seen it from a distance at night,<br> but its defenses are obviously quite formidable.</p><p><strong>Avicebron:</strong><br> Were you able to make it up there, Custodian?</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> Well... During the Great Holy Grail War,<br> the Black Team&#39;s Master&#39;s used stolen airplanes...</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> And Rider\u2013Astolfo, that is... Well, he rode his hippogriff up to it, dodging its defenses all the way.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> On top of that, our Ruler used a defensive skill that protected us from more than half of the bombardment Semiramis unleashed from her garden.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> Right now, we have Achilles&#39;s chariot and Astolfo&#39;s hippogriff, but\u2013</p><p><strong>Avicebron:</strong><br> I&#39;m afraid it will be difficult to attack the garden with those alone.</p><p><strong>Avicebron:</strong><br> Convenient as it would be were she to simply open the garden&#39;s gates to us, I rather doubt she will be so accommodating. More likely, she will defend her garden quite fiercely.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> Hey, Chiron, got any brilliant ideas to get us in there?</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> Such things are always useful when there is a weakness to exploit, but I am afraid no amount of planning or brilliance can break those defenses.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> I&#39;m afraid we may have no choice but to charge through the front door. Sir Sieg, is your true body recovered enough to be able to move?</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> ...I&#39;ve had it resting the last few days to focus on healing up.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> If nothing else, it should be able to fly now.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> But even so, breaking in will be difficult. If I take another Noble Phantasm, I&#39;ll fall right out of the sky.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> Especially if it happens to be Siegfried&#39;s.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> His Noble Phantasm is especially dangerous to me,<br> given that it slew a dragon.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> Even the slightest scratch from it could send me crashing down.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> ...I&#39;m sorry I caused such trouble for you while I was on the opposing side.</p><p><strong>Fran:</strong><br> Ugh.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> ...?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> She says, \u201CDon&#39;t worry &#39;bout it.\u201D</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> Unfortunately, we have no choice but for you to fly if we are to assault the garden&#39;s front gates.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> It&#39;s not that I&#39;m scared...<br> Well, no, I guess I AM scared.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> I&#39;m scared I won&#39;t actually be able to do this\u2013that I won&#39;t be able to get you there safely.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> Oh? Apologies. It seems I was not clear. We will, of course, ALL be contributing to this frontal assault.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> You may be the Greater Grail&#39;s Custodian, but I would never put this entirely on your shoulders alone.</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong><br> In that case, Astolfo and I&#39;ll back you up,<br> since we can both fly too.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Damn skippy we will!</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Don&#39;t worry, I promise we&#39;ll keep you and Fujimaru safe up there!</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong><br> Then I&#39;ll stay here and watch the\u2013On second thought, I&#39;d better come along too. I&#39;d be no match for those Dragon Tooth Warriors on my own.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong><br> Well, I&#39;d better prepare a sonnet to sing the praises of you, our great heroes! That will surely make fortune smile upon you!</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong><br> Now then, I&#39;m off to write! Only a few hours left until deadline! Time to get that ink flowing, William!</p><p><strong>Avicebron:</strong><br> Hmm. In my case...I suppose I&#39;ll have some golems fly in front of the dragon, to act as his shield.</p><p><strong>Avicebron:</strong><br> If I make full use of the Millennia Fortress&#39;s walls for material, they should last at least a little while.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong><br> I suppose I could pick off any attackers with my bow...</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong><br> Do you know something, Custodian?</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> Atalante, you, uh...<br> You have another Noble Phantasm.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> I heard you used it to fly during the Great Holy Grail War.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong><br> ...The Calydonian Boar&#39;s pelt!</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong><br> I remember now. You are right.<br> There IS more than one way to use the boar&#39;s pelt.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong><br> Surprising that I would use it to try to win the war, though... I must have been quite desperate.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Can you still use it?</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong><br> I will figure something out.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong><br> I do not know that I will be able to stay in the air for overly long, but I should be able to defy gravity for at least a short while.</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong><br> Mommy, Mommy.<br> Can we use our mist?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Mist?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> You mean your second Noble Phantasm?</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong><br> Uh-huh.<br> It can...uh... What&#39;s the word again?</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong><br> You know, I can choose who it goes around.<br> Do you know what I mean, Mr. Horse Servant?</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> So you can freely select who your mist envelops...</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> That sounds like it can be directed, then.</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong><br> Yep! That&#39;s it.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> ...Aha, now I see.<br> So back then, that&#39;s how she\u2013</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong><br> We&#39;re gonna ride on Mr. Custodian&#39;s back along with Mommy!</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> Yes, good point.<br> Avicebron, Shakespeare.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> I&#39;d like you two to ride on Fafnir&#39;s back as well.</p><p><strong>Fran:</strong><br> Ugh...</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> Hey, Frankenstein...<br> I mean, Berserker?</p><p><strong>Fran:</strong><br> Uh?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> You and I are gonna team up,<br> so I want you staying put on the ground.</p><p><strong>Fran:</strong><br> Ugh?<br> Uh...?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> Ah, don&#39;t worry so much!<br> I got a brilliant plan, trust me!</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> Is there a legend about you flying that I was unaware of?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> Nah, nothing like that. Don&#39;t worry, though.<br> I&#39;ll figure something out!</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> Long as we get up there, it doesn&#39;t matter how, right?<br> I&#39;ll get us there! Just you watch!</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> We&#39;ll go shooting up there like a rocket!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> So...you&#39;re going to explode?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> Hell no!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> You mean you&#39;re gonna use your Ma</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> Shh.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> That&#39;s a damn secret, okay?</p><p><strong>Fran:</strong><br> Uh...?</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> What about you, Siegfried, Chiron, and Spartacus?<br> What will you guys do?</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> Good question...</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> I&#39;ll accompany Achilles in his chariot.<br> Assuming that&#39;s all right with you?</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong><br> Fine by me.</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong><br> Chariots aren&#39;t made for just one rider anyway.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Wanna ride on my hippogriff with me, Siegfried?<br> I&#39;m sure we can find room for one more!</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> ...It would seem that is my only option.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> I&#39;ll make sure to defend against the other me&#39;s Noble Phantasm.</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong><br> Guess that just leaves this guy.<br> Hey, Spartacus.</p><p><strong>Spartacus:</strong><br> I refuse.</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong><br> Why!?</p><p><strong>Spartacus:</strong><br> You bear the stink of oppressors.<br> Now that I know our destination, I will find my own way!</p><p><strong>Spartacus:</strong><br> Nothing is impossible for me.<br> The sky is but one more obstacle to be overcome.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> Please calm down.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> Spartacus, you may be a Servant, but I don&#39;t believe you have any skills or Noble Phantasms that would let you fly.</p><p><strong>Spartacus:</strong><br> Nothing is impossible in this world.</p><p><strong>Spartacus:</strong><br> If birds are capable of flight,<br> then humans must be as well.</p><p><strong>Spartacus:</strong><br> If I must become a bird to reach the garden,<br> then that is what I shall do.</p><p><strong>Spartacus:</strong><br> Yes, I shall be a small, elegant bird,<br> soaring gracefully across the sky...</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> A-a bird, you say...?</p><p><strong>Spartacus:</strong><br> Cock-a-doodle-doooooo!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Welp, you won&#39;t be soaring...</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong><br> ...Well, you cannot expect to become a bird overnight, Spartacus. If I were a bird, I would be insulted to hear you think it such a trivial thing to do.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong><br> Perhaps we could send a rope down for you? With muscles like that, you should have no trouble climbing up to the garden.</p><p><strong>Spartacus:</strong><br> ...<br> ...You are no oppressor...</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> What the hell does this lunkhead use to figure out what&#39;s an oppressor anyway?</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> Good.<br> Now we all have a plan to reach the garden.</p><p><strong>Spartacus:</strong><br> Indeed.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> ...Probably.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> We&#39;re fine... Yeah... Toootally fine...</p><p><strong>Spartacus:</strong><br> I will prove to you that my muscles are truly worthy of your absolute trust.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> All right, then. You three new Servants will officially join our battle lineup.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> Our next step is get you acclimated to working with [\u2642 Sir /\u2640 Lady] Fujimaru as a team.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Sounds good to me!</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> Understood.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> Aw, c&#39;mon. Really? Do I gotta?<br> I already know how to fight just fine.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> Indeed. I am certain a warrior of your skill can manage quite capably.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> But working with a team requires more than mere combat skill alone.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> Besides, there&#39;s nothing better than the feeling one gets after landing a beautiful team combo.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> All the more so when it happens in live combat,<br> rather than in practice.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> ...All right. I guess I could give it a shot.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> (She&#39;s like putty in his hands...!)</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> &#39;kay then, I&#39;ll go first!<br> Looking forward to fighting with ya, Custodian!</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> Thank you. The pleasure&#39;s all mine.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> Avicebron, would you mind creating some training golems?</p><p><strong>Avicebron:</strong><br> Very well.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> All right, Astolfo, focus on teamwork,<br> and do not run off on your own.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Aye, aye, sir!</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> I will offer advice, but nothing more.<br> Good luck, you two.</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Wooowie! I&#39;m all tuckered out!<br> Bleeeah.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> Teamwork is an excellent way to compensate for one&#39;s weaknesses, but it can also greatly enhance your strengths as well.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> Try to keep that in mind once the fighting begins in earnest.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> &#39;kaaay!</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> Siegfried, you&#39;re up next.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> Right.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> Most of your opponents&#39; attacks will be focused on you, Siegfried.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> You may block them, heal from them, evade them, trade places with another... You are, in short, free to handle this however you see fit.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> Well then, here we go!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> Now I see.<br> This is nice.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Something wrong?</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> Oh, no, everything&#39;s fine.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> I guess I just got caught up in the moment...<br> Let&#39;s keep going.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> Last, but certainly not least: Mordred.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> Yeah, yeah, fine. This teamwork stuff&#39;s a pain in the ass. I&#39;m just gonna go nuts.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> That&#39;s perfectly fine.<br> We will simply follow your lead.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> Wait, really? You will?</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> Of course. Rampaging about like a Berserker seems to suit you rather well.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> Well, hey, how &#39;bout that. Guess I don&#39;t gotta worry about you clowns. I like that!</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> Okay, Master, what do you say we get this party started!?</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> Are you two ready?</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> Mordred appears to be well suited to quick, decisive battles, so let&#39;s try to hit the opponent as hard and fast as we possibly can.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> Your goal will be to take out the heavy golems before they can become a threat. All right, begin!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> ...Damn, that was close!<br> These golems are way tougher than I thought!</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> But I&#39;ll finish these jerks off!</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> Brilliant work.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> Aw yeah, piece of cake!</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> Have you got a handle on how all three teams operate now?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Definitely.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> Great. Then let&#39;s take a break.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> We still have some time until the sun sets and the Hanging Gardens shows itself.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I could still use a little more time.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> I see... Then let&#39;s discuss our teamwork a little more, shall we?</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> We should still have enough time for that.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> I&#39;m afraid we will need to leave this fortress behind. If you have any unfinished business here, now is the time to take care of it.</p><p><strong>Fran:</strong><br> Uh...</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> I&#39;m sorry, Frankenstein. Well...you could pick some flowers to take with you, right?</p><p><strong>Fran:</strong><br> Uh!</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> Aw, look at her, all excited...</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> You two really are good friends.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> Who, us? Eh, it&#39;s pretty simple.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> We&#39;re a lot alike.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> You are...?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> Forget it.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> Anyway, what about you and the Saber of Black?<br> You got some kinda problem with Siegfried?</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> No, nothing like that.<br> At least, not as he is now.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> Aw, really? And here I was thinking he must&#39;ve handed you your ass back during the other war or something.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> That&#39;s...</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> Sir Custodian, may I have a word with you?</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> With me...?</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> Okay.<br> What&#39;s this about?</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> It seems none of us has any memory of the Great Holy Grail War we once fought here...</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> That&#39;s right. I think you&#39;ve all been summoned from the records leading up to it.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> Usually, your memories would be engraved in the Throne of Heroes, but the versions of you here right now are not actually complete.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> Alternatively, someone might have sealed them away on purpose. Perhaps whoever is orchestrating all this.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> I&#39;m told you still have your memories of the war, Sir Custodian. If that&#39;s true, I have a question for you...</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> Of course.<br> ...Anything.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> Did I stay true to myself?</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> I... I&#39;m afraid I can&#39;t answer that.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> I see. That&#39;s all right. I was just curious.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> No need to give it further thought.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> Now that I&#39;ve been summoned here, whatever grudges I may have held in the past are of no importance.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> I will simply fight to the best of my ability.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> Thank you.<br> That will be a huge help.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> That said, I still find it hard to believe that you are this evil dragon, Sir Custodian...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I think you bathed in this dragon&#39;s blood once, right?</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> I did. ...I only hope I need never fight such a battle again.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> It is too terrible to recall...but the feeling of it is forever etched into my soul.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I&#39;m, uh... I&#39;m sorry...</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> ?</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> What is it, Master of Chaldea?<br> You look terribly embarrassed.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> An apology?</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> Hmm, I don&#39;t know what it is you are sorry for...<br> But I promise you, I&#39;m fine. You needn&#39;t worry about me.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> You are a Master, a crystallization of the future.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> If you deem my aid necessary,<br> I would be glad to lend it to you.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> I, uh, I see.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> So Siegfried fought a different Fafnir in Orleans...</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> ...Don&#39;t worry, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> I&#39;m sure he meant it when he said he never wanted to fight a battle like that again...</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> ...but I doubt a hero like him would let something like that stop him from stepping up when he&#39;s needed.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> I&#39;m sure he&#39;ll do whatever he has to.<br> All the more so if the fate of humanity is at stake.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> After all, he&#39;s the sort of man who would risk his life just to save a homunculus like me...</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> He even put me ahead of his own desires,<br> and those of the person he had pledged to fight.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> He ended up throwing all that away, because of me.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> I don&#39;t regret doing what I had to do to survive.<br> But, I guess...</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> ...Hmm, it&#39;s hard to explain.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> I wanted to survive, and I want Siegfried to continue fighting.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> I feel like those two desires contradict each other,<br> but then again, maybe they don&#39;t...?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Do you feel guilty or something?</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> ...Yes, I suppose I do.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> After I became the Greater Grail&#39;s Custodian, I learned a lot of things I would have been happier not knowing.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> Among them were things that happened without me having been aware at the time.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> ...The last Servant Atalante fought was Achilles.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> Frankenstein was forced to use her Noble Phantasm&#39;s full power when she fought with Mordred, even though she knew doing so would be suicide.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> And...a great hero like Siegfried gave up his heart, all to save my life.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> They fought long and hard to acquire the Holy Grail.<br> All of their wishes were pure and righteous.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> But in the end, I was the one who ended up with the Greater Grail.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> ...Ever since then, I&#39;ve been wondering whether I did the right thing or not.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> What would you have done? Would you have been able to accept a wish like that, and allowed the Greater Grail to grant it?</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> Or would you have made the same choice I did?</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> Or...would you have taken another option?<br> One I didn&#39;t see at the time...?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I&#39;d have had to be there myself.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> That&#39;s really hard to say.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> Right. That makes sense.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> ...<br> ...Hm?</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> That&#39;s weird. It&#39;s not as though my problem has been resolved, but...</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> ...for some reason, I feel a bit better now.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Maybe you just needed to talk about it?</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> ...That could be it.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> It&#39;s hard to repress the urge to talk. Maybe that&#39;s not so surprising, since I&#39;ve manifested as a terminal.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> We still have some time before we leave for the Hanging Gardens. Would it be okay if we talk a little more?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Of course!</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> Thank you.<br> In that case...</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> ...I&#39;d love to hear about the Servants you know. Without violating their privacy, of course.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> ...I see.<br> So you know a ninja, huh?</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> Mechanical?<br> But...she&#39;s not a robot, then?</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> I had no idea they had the technology back then to create a machine capable of becoming a Heroic Spirit.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> I guess ninja really are something else.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> So Divine Spirits have materialized in your world? I see. I guess that makes sense, given the crisis humanity is facing.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> Huh? The goddess of virginity and the moon that Atalante worships is actually a besotted romantic?</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> And Orion...is a tiny teddy bear?<br> ...Are they even strong?</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> ...I would think that being loved by so many people is a good thing.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> So why do you look so exhausted?</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> It&#39;s a heavy weight to carry?<br> I wasn&#39;t aware love had mass.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> I guess I still have a lot to learn...</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> Blackbeard.<br> The pirate.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> I see. I understand now.<br> That one is beyond understanding.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> Thank you for sharing all that.<br> Chaldea...sounds like a lot of fun.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Can&#39;t you come to visit?</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> I&#39;m afraid not.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> It might be possible, but even if it was, I&#39;m obligated to stay here and take care of the Greater Grail.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> Once this battle is over, I&#39;m going to stay here. I&#39;m...waiting for someone to show up.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> That&#39;s the one decision I can&#39;t change.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I see. That&#39;s too bad...</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> If it was difficult or painful to do that,<br> I might not be able to handle it.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> But it&#39;s just a long wait, so it&#39;s no trouble at all.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> Still...it&#39;s nice of you to be concerned about me.<br> I appreciate that.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> I was worried I might have upset you, summoning you out here all of a sudden like this.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> ...The next battle is going to be for the Hanging Gardens.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> Avicebron said he would make a saddle for you,<br> so make sure you hold on tight to that.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> But even if you fall,<br> I&#39;m sure one of the heroes will save you.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> It could be Astolfo, Achilles,<br> Atalante, or Avicebron...</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> ...but whoever it is,<br> I&#39;m certain one of them will save you if you need it.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> Anyway, we&#39;d better get back.<br> We need to get ready to leave too.</p><h2 id="section-6-a-dreamlike-moment" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-6-a-dreamlike-moment" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 6: A Dreamlike Moment</h2><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Guess I won&#39;t be seeing THIS room again...</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> No, probably not.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> ...Would you like one last thing to eat before we go?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> No, that&#39;s all right.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> Okay. In that case, we might as well clean the place up a bit.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> ...Hm? I think I hear the Servants calling me.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> Hang on, I&#39;ll be right back.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Sure, that sounds good.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> Okay, just sit tight.<br> I&#39;ll be back with some food soon.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> What&#39;s keeping him...?</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Whooo&#39;s ready for a picnic!?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> Not a damn picnic!</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> Aw, crap.<br> He&#39;s stronger than he looks...!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Wh-what&#39;s this all about?</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> Rider\u2013Astolfo said he wanted to have a picnic in the courtyard.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> That it was worth celebrating so many Servants getting together like this, even if we&#39;re still missing three.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> What I REALLY said was, \u201CWhat&#39;s the harm?<br> You ARE hungry, right? Come on, let&#39;s do it!\u201D</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> And the rest is history.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> What...No it isn&#39;t!<br> What are you talking about!?</p><p><strong>Fran:</strong><br> Ugh!</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Right!?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> Hey! Don&#39;t you go turning Fran against me!</p><p><strong>Fran:</strong><br> Ugh, ugh!</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> ...Well... Here we all are, out in the courtyard,<br> having sandwiches together...</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> Having everyone here together is...a bit of a surprise, really.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You said it.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> Hey, gimme that one. I&#39;m not eating any of that egg salad shit! I want some MEAT!</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> But you&#39;re eating it already! AND you tried to steal my sandwich without even asking!</p><p><strong>Fran:</strong><br> Uh, uh\u266A</p><p><strong>Spartacus:</strong><br> Sandwiches...trap meat and other food...<br> Does this mean...bread is an oppressor...?</p><p><strong>Avicebron:</strong><br> Even if it were, you can&#39;t just eat the sandwich&#39;s insides. Then you&#39;d be oppressing the bread.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong><br> Hmm.<br> Strawberry custard...</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong><br> This is very sweet.<br> Children would love this.</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong><br> Mmm, yummy!</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong><br> As I thought.</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong><br> Strawberries taste like blood!<br> Both&#39;re really sweet!</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong><br> I, um...do not think that is true...?<br> In fact, they are...ah...really quite different.</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong><br> You sure?</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> Hmm. These would make perfect battlefield rations.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> You can eat them in one bite,<br> and they provide excellent, balanced nutrition.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> ...Not that we require nutrition as Servants,<br> but old habits die hard.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> Nothing wrong with thinking that way!</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> My king never batted an eye at whatever she ate,<br> no matter how bad it tasted.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> It was like she didn&#39;t care one damn bit about flavor, just the nutrients! I&#39;ll take your approach over cold efficiency any day!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Maybe she was actually something of a gourmand?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> My father?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> That inhuman old fool? Hah! Gimme a break!</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> If she turns out to be a gourmand,<br> then I&#39;ll eat every one of Gawain&#39;s \u201Cdishes\u201D myself!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> You sure she didn&#39;t actually want to eat good food?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> Hell no.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> It didn&#39;t matter HOW good the food was!<br> She&#39;d always just give that same disinterested, \u201CMmm...\u201D</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> If she actually did give a shit about food, I&#39;ll eat every one of Gawain&#39;s mashed \u201Cspecials\u201D myself!</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> (Ooh, I think I just heard a branch opening up!)</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> ...Mmm. These came out rather well,<br> if I do say so myself.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You made these, Teacher?</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> I did, yes, though Sieg was kind enough to procure the ingredients for me.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> I could never make something this good on my own.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> ...Dammit, these ARE good.<br> Ugh, is there anything this guy CAN&#39;T do?</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong><br> Hell no there isn&#39;t.<br> My teacher&#39;s not a great sage for nothing!</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> ...Can he hold a crucifix for an hour straight?</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong><br> You bet. He can do one-finger push-ups without breaking a sweat, too.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong><br> Can he shoot an apple off the head of an evil chancellor?</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong><br> In his sleep. He could shoot the chancellor too, while he was at it.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Can he shoot vacuum blades just by cracking his knuckles?</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong><br> Easily. They&#39;ll go through anything like a hot knife through butter.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> How long can he hold his breath while still acting at full strength?</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong><br> As long as it takes for his opponent to keel over!</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong><br> Is he a mommy?</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong><br> Raising kids is what he does best!</p><p><strong>Fran:</strong><br> Ugh?<br> (Can he come back to life with lightning?)</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong><br> I&#39;m not sure, but I bet he&#39;d find a way!</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> ...You really mustn&#39;t go around making such outlandish claims, Achilles. Though I suppose it bears mentioning that I could indeed manage some of those.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> Oh, you can, huh...<br> Well, you certainly look like you could.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> I admit that I can do most things better than the average person, but I cannot be the best.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> I could not win against Achilles or Atalante in a footrace, nor could I defeat Spartacus in a contest of strength.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> Indeed, I doubt I could defeat any of you in the areas of your respective specialties.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> Archery may be my specialty, but even there I could never defeat, say, the likes of Arash Kamangir, who split the earth itself.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> I am a teacher, not a hero.<br> I am not meant to stand above others.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> In that sense, Achilles is not my only pupil here.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> Sir Sieg, [\u2642 Sir /\u2640 Lady] Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> I consider both of you to be my pupils as well.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> I only wish we had more time together.<br> There are so many other things I wish I could teach you...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Come to Chaldea!</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> Hahaha, I&#39;ll have to think about that.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I know a girl who&#39;d love to learn from you, too.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> Oho.<br> Mash Kyrielight, hm?</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> I see, I see. It sounds like I already have quite the formidable rival teacher.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> At any rate, if we are ever summoned to Chaldea,<br> it will be as our true selves.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> I expect, should that come to pass, that I will have learned all manner of new things, and may even be able to teach you more as well.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> Are you freakin&#39; kidding me with this shit?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> There&#39;s no point continuing to study and stuff once you&#39;re a Servant, right?</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> ...Not the way I see it.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> After all, I know someone who kept learning even after they became a Servant.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> Oh really? Who?</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> ...I&#39;m afraid I can&#39;t tell you.<br> I wasn&#39;t actually there, you see.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> But I do know that hero never stopped moving forward.<br> That much, I can say for absolute certain.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> ...All right, it&#39;s going to be night soon.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> I hate to say it, but it&#39;s time to bring this picnic to a close.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Thank you for the wonderful meal.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> Of course.<br> I&#39;m glad you enjoyed it.</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong><br> I guess it&#39;s three minutes until we storm the gardens.<br> Is everyone ready!?</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> No issues here.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong><br> ...This outfit seems a bit...much, no?<br> It feels more like a swimsuit than a suit of armor.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong><br> Personally, I much prefer my normal attire...</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong><br> I think you look great!<br> I don&#39;t see a problem at all!</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong><br> I was not asking you.<br> ...Still, I suppose I can make do, since it allows me to fly.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Wahahahaha!<br> I wish someone could take a picture of this!</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> Indeed. ...How you doing there, Hippogriff?<br> I hope I&#39;m not too heavy for you.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> He says you&#39;re very heavy.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> That figures!</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong><br> Man, looking at this thing up close,<br> it&#39;s absurdly freaking large!</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong><br> We&#39;ll soon be entering the garden&#39;s firing range. Everyone, make sure to evade or block the Tiamtum \u016Amu like your life depends on it!</p><p><strong>Avicebron:</strong><br> All right, now seems a good time to make my golem shield.<br> My body is a red shield...Gevurah Armadura!</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Hippogriff...dimension evade!</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong><br> All right, we&#39;d better\u2013</p><p><strong>A\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Oh, I just had a revelation.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> Oh?<br> Who was that...?</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong><br> Xanthos.<br> What do you want?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Is that horse talking...!?</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong><br> Ah yes, that is Xanthos. One of the divine steeds that Poseidon himself gave to Achilles.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong><br> I believe it is also the only one of the three that can talk.</p><p><strong>A\uFF1AXanthus:</strong><br> I was just thinking.</p><p><strong>A\uFF1AXanthus:</strong><br> How come you and Lord Chiron are the only ones not on the enemy side, Lord Achilles?</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong><br> ...Is that really important right now?</p><p><strong>A\uFF1AXanthus:</strong><br> It is, yes.</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong><br> All right then, let&#39;s hear it.</p><p><strong>A\uFF1AXanthus:</strong><br> ...I think you two must have been quite expensive.</p><p><strong>A\uFF1AXanthus:</strong><br> That&#39;s not to say Lady Mordred, Lord Siegfried,<br> and Lord Karna weren&#39;t expensive as well, of course.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> What do you mean by expensive?</p><p><strong>A\uFF1AXanthus:</strong><br> You know, like in a strategy game.</p><p><strong>A\uFF1AXanthus:</strong><br> In games like that,<br> it is very expensive to create powerful units.</p><p><strong>A\uFF1AXanthus:</strong><br> First you have to work your way up the tech tree,<br> and that takes a long time on its own.</p><p><strong>A\uFF1AXanthus:</strong><br> And all this time, our opponent in this game,<br> this Great Holy Grail War within the Greater Grail...</p><p><strong>A\uFF1AXanthus:</strong><br> ...has been laying the groundwork to produce the most powerful units possible.</p><p><strong>A\uFF1AXanthus:</strong><br> No doubt whoever it is put in a lot of hard work.<br> So, if this opponent is in the Hanging Gardens now...</p><p><strong>A\uFF1AXanthus:</strong><br> ...then of course, they&#39;ll be waiting for the right time to use their new units. This just occurred to me.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> ...Setting aside how you even know what a strategy game is...</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> ...I must admit that is a strong possibility.<br> In which case, our first move will have to be...</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> Achilles.</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong><br> Y-yeah?<br> What is it, Teacher?</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> I want you to neutralize the other side&#39;s Achilles.<br> I&#39;ll do the same with their Chiron.</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong><br> ...Aw, c&#39;mon, Teacher.<br> Xanthos has a history of blowing smoke up your\u2013</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong><br> ...Okay, yep.<br> That was me, all right...</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> It would seem he was right on the money.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> Everyone? Your attention, if I may?</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> My Noble Phantasm has no telegraph or tell of any kind. If the enemy Chiron uses it on you, I&#39;m afraid you&#39;ll just have to trust in your luck.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong><br> You may as well tell us to roll over and die!<br> (\u2191 Luck rank: E)</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong><br> Yeah.<br> That is hardly encouraging advice.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong><br> My, my. At long last,<br> the battle with all fourteen Servants will begin!</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong><br> Though we yet lack the Assyrian empress AND the great hero of India!</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong><br> To say nothing of the enemy having the Hanging Gardens to serve as their airborne fortress!</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong><br> ...Do we really have a hope of winning this?</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong><br> You&#39;re the great writer!<br> Figure something out!</p><p><strong>Avicebron:</strong><br> ...Their assault is relentless!</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Hang on. Where the hell are Mordred and Fran!?<br> Oh, and Spartacus, I guess.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> All right then.</p><p><strong>Fran:</strong><br> Uh?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> Huh? You wanna know my plan to get us up there?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> It&#39;s simple.<br> I&#39;m gonna blast up there with my Mana Burst.</p><p><strong>Fran:</strong><br> Ugh?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> Then there was no point in you staying behind?<br> &#39;Course there was!</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> See, even with my Mana Burst,<br> it&#39;s gonna be tough getting all the way up there myself.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> But not with you here.</p><p><strong>Fran:</strong><br> Ugh!?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> You got it.<br> Your Noble Phantasm&#39;s all about lightning too, right?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> So if we both power each other up, then boom!<br> We&#39;re in business!</p><p><strong>Fran:</strong><br> Ugh...</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> Don&#39;t worry, it&#39;ll be fine! If we don&#39;t make it up there, all that&#39;ll happen is we&#39;ll crash right back down to the ground.</p><p><strong>Fran:</strong><br> Uh...</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> Oh, right.<br> Can&#39;t have this armor weighing me down.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> There we go.<br> Now, let&#39;s do this thing!</p><p><strong>Fran:</strong><br> Uh...</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> One, two...THREE!</p><p><strong>Avicebron:</strong><br> Hmm.

Under normal circumstances, this system would not even grant the likes of you an audience.</p><p><strong>Semiramis:</strong><br> It matters not how many years it was in your possession.

From mankind itself!</p><p><strong>Darnic:</strong><br> Khh... Ahh, the pain.<br> I can feel my psyche slipping away.</p><p><strong>Darnic:</strong><br> But that doesn&#39;t matter anymore,<br> as the reproduction is perfect.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> ...So you still desire the Greater Grail,<br> even though your soul is practically falling apart?</p><p><strong>Darnic:</strong><br> A tool, a THING like you could never understand.</p><p><strong>Darnic:</strong><br> No, none of you heroes could ever understand.<br> You&#39;ve always had power to fall back on.</p><p><strong>Darnic:</strong><br> Not me. I worked myself to the bone. I racked my brain studying magecraft so intensely it nearly killed me!</p><p><strong>Darnic:</strong><br> I extended my life even as I lived in fear. I threw myself into a Holy Grail War! I commanded armies! Betrayed my allies!</p><p><strong>Darnic:</strong><br> I&#39;m not like the three families who let their own indolence guide them until they lost sight of the goal!</p><p><strong>Darnic:</strong><br> I&#39;M the one who wanted this Greater Grail more than anyone! I&#39;M the one who desired it most!</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> ...Whether or not that is true,<br> Darnic has been dead for a long time now.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> The thing speaking now is nothing more than the lingering desires left behind after his death.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> The desire...left behind...</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> Yes.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> ...As I said earlier, he betrayed Vlad III,<br> right before he died.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> He used a Command Spell to force Vlad III to transform into a vampire and then merged with him.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> the result was a horrid monster, neither human nor vampire.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> But even that did not gain him the Greater Grail. A priest who was a Master for the Red team defeated him, you see.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> That should have been the end of it.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> When a Servant dies, they dissolve into purified magical energy, and are absorbed by the Greater Grail.</p><p><strong>Semiramis:</strong><br> ...But that did not happen with him.</p><p><strong>Semiramis:</strong><br> Most likely because he was still...human.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> Yes, that&#39;s part of it...</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> ...but it&#39;s also because Darnic consumed the souls of infants to extend his life.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> Now, he is neither human, nor Servant.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> He is just a...thing. One driven solely by the desire to win the Holy Grail for itself.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> That is all this \u201CDarnic\u201D is.</p><p><strong>Fran:</strong><br> Uh...</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> Damn... Sounds more like putting down a rabid dog than kicking ass!</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> The Greater Grail is close to falling apart. You won&#39;t even be able to activate the Third Magic, let alone reach the Root.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> ...Give it up.<br> Your dream ended long ago.</p><p><strong>Darnic:</strong><br> Oh no it didn&#39;t! Not yet!</p><p><strong>Darnic:</strong><br> Have you forgotten what I told you earlier?</p><p><strong>Darnic:</strong><br> I now control eighty-seven percent of the Greater Grail&#39;s system.</p><p><strong>Darnic:</strong><br> I will make far better use of it than you ever would!</p><p><strong>Darnic:</strong><br> All you&#39;ve ever done with its power is sit around waiting for someone who will never come!</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Avicebron:</strong><br> What an odd thing to say. How can you make use of the Greater Grail&#39;s power when you&#39;re dead...?</p><p><strong>Darnic:</strong><br> Dead, alive, it doesn&#39;t matter.<br> I will always seek to control the Greater Grail!</p><p><strong>Darnic:</strong><br> Once I have it, my wish will finally be granted...!</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> ...I see.<br> So now you are little more than a vengeful spirit.</p><p><strong>Darnic:</strong><br> But this would benefit all of you very much as well.</p><p><strong>Darnic:</strong><br> As long as I control the Greater Grail,<br> none of you will ever die again.</p><p><strong>Darnic:</strong><br> You would have a second\u2013no,<br> a third lease on life!</p><p><strong>Darnic:</strong><br> But, if I am defeated, and this Great Holy Grail War comes to an end...</p><p><strong>Darnic:</strong><br> ...all of you will disappear as well.</p><p><strong>Darnic:</strong><br> ...Now, Custodian, which is the better choice?<br> In fact, let me make it simpler.</p><p><strong>Darnic:</strong><br> Would you rather have a third chance at life,<br> or just vanish with no one to remember you!</p><p><strong>Darnic:</strong><br> I swear to you all now,<br> on my honor as a Yggdmillennia...</p><p><strong>Darnic:</strong><br> ...I will ensure that you all leave this Greater Grail, and are incarnated in the real world!</p><p><strong>Darnic:</strong><br> You will be free to do as you wish. You may make your own dreams come true, or simply wander as you please.</p><p><strong>Darnic:</strong><br> I have no intention of commanding you as my Servants.<br> Whatever you decide will be your business, not mine.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> What&#39;re you gonna do...!?</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> I...I have no right to compel them one way or the other.<br> I am the Custodian. Nothing more.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> Even if they are just reproductions, they&#39;re still conscious beings with their own unique personalities.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> ...I can&#39;t order them to their deaths.</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong><br> ...Man, Sieg, you&#39;re way beyond being a downer, you know that? You can be completely exhausting sometimes.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> Huh?</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong><br> Hey, Darnic Prestone Yggdmillennia.</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong><br> Hate to break it to you,<br> but I&#39;m gonna have to pass.</p><p><strong>Darnic:</strong><br> Oh? And why is that?</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong><br> Easy. &#39;Cause I wouldn&#39;t really be a hero if I went along with you now, would I?</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong><br> We&#39;re meant to live life to the fullest. Even if you trip up along the way, that doesn&#39;t invalidate what happened before the fall, or after.</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong><br> And reproduction or not, Servant or not,<br> as long as I&#39;m still me...</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong><br> ...I&#39;m not doing anything that a real hero wouldn&#39;t do.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> ...<br> ...Tch.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> For once, you carrot-looking weirdo,<br> we&#39;re on the same page!</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong><br> Carrot-looking weirdo!?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> I can&#39;t really say I got the cleanest hands around here...but that sure as hell doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;ll be siding with you!</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> Even I&#39;d feel pretty gross going along with your plan.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> How &#39;bout you, empress lady?<br> You gonna side with this ass?</p><p><strong>Semiramis:</strong><br> Don&#39;t be a fool.</p><p><strong>Semiramis:</strong><br> The most generous offer I make to those who challenge me is a swift death.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> ...Indeed.<br> I cannot consent to your proposal.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> I share Achilles&#39;s view.<br> I will not dishonor the life I led before.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> And I am certain Karna agrees with me.</p><p><strong>Karna:</strong><br> You can certainly try to prolong your own life if you wish, but I&#39;m afraid I have no interest in that myself.</p><p><strong>Karna:</strong><br> I went to my death knowing I had done what I had to. Now, my only obligation is to lend my strength to those with goals to achieve.</p><p><strong>Avicebron:</strong><br> Likewise.</p><p><strong>Avicebron:</strong><br> I can only carry out my work when I have been summoned properly.

N-no answering questions with questions!</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Now I get it. You were just shy!</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> ...Yes, I suppose I was.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> It&#39;s sort of awkward to meet someone again after you&#39;ve already said goodbye, even if they don&#39;t remember having done so.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> ...Gotcha.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> But hey! The me you knew was still meee, right?</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> Of course.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> You helped me out so many times.<br> I was proud to have you as my Servant.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> ...Thanks.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Well, see you again sometime!</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> All right, I suppose I&#39;d better be on my way as well.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> Sir Custodian...had you been the evil dragon I faced, perhaps we could have resolved our differences peacefully.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> That way, I would never have had to bathe in the blood of a dragon.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> But\u2013</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> I know.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> If I hadn&#39;t been immortal, I might have died in a ditch somewhere, without anyone ever knowing my name.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> No, I don&#39;t think so...</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> Even if you never bathed in dragon&#39;s blood,<br> or came into possession of Balmung...</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> ...I&#39;m certain you would still have been a hero.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> ...Thank you, Custodian.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> Thank you for thinking so well of me,<br> and for fighting alongside me.</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong><br> Welp, guess we&#39;d better hit the road too, Teacher.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> Indeed. For a while, I was rather uncertain how this would all turn out...</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> ...but it ended up being much more fun than I anticipated.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> This battle lasted but a few days, and is unlikely to become part of history in any real sense.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> So I hope that, if nothing else, it will remain in your memories, [\u2642 Sir /\u2640 Lady] Fujimaru.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Of course. I&#39;ll never forget it.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> It will. And I&#39;ll remember all of you, too. I promise.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> We have a connection now.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> Once I have been summoned, I will spend every free moment I have holding classes on\u2013</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> Hm? You already have a great many teachers?</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> Hmm, interesting. In that case, I would love to pit our different teaching styles against one another!</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong><br> ...So, we really won this, huh?</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong><br> Back when I was alive, even though my life was one battle after another...or maybe even because of it...</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong><br> ...I couldn&#39;t ever really relax after winning,<br> &#39;cause I knew the next battle was never far off.</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong><br> But now...I guess I don&#39;t have to worry about that anymore.</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong><br> ...That&#39;s actually kinda nice, in its own way.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> It is?</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong><br> Yeah. I&#39;m...satisfied.</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong><br> I don&#39;t have any grudges, and no civilians around means there were no massacres or other atrocities.</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong><br> Oh, and it&#39;s nice that Hektor&#39;s not here either.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> So you really do hate him?</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong><br> Nah, not...exactly.</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong><br> If you ever end up summoning me,<br> I&#39;ll figure out a way to get along with him.</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong><br> ...Yeah, it&#39;ll work out.<br> Just gotta think positive.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I take it you don&#39;t get along?</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong><br> Hmm... Well, let&#39;s just say we went through a lot together, and most of it was less than friendly.</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong><br> That said, I&#39;m a Servant now. I&#39;m sure if I got summoned,<br> I&#39;d forget any problems I had with him.</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong><br> ...But that&#39;s not what I&#39;m really trying to say.</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong><br> What I really want to say is that I bet I could have a lot of fun fighting alongside you guys again.</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong><br> So if you ever find yourself in a tight spot in Greece, just gimme a call.</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong><br> I&#39;ll come running, no matter when or where you are.<br> Promise.</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong><br> Thanks for everything.<br> ...This was a really good battle.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> Now that the Greater Grail is stable again,<br> this world is about to disappear.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> Give me your hand.<br> It&#39;s time we returned to the real world.</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong><br> Here we are. Now, at last...I can wait here, secure in the knowledge that the Greater Grail will be safe.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You know, I really have to ask...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Who are you waiting for, anyway?</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong><br> ...I&#39;m afraid I can&#39;t tell you that.<br> It&#39;s a secret.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Gotcha.</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong><br> I know I shouldn&#39;t be keeping anything from you, but...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> It&#39;s fine. I get it.</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong><br> Are you sure?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Some things aren&#39;t for anyone else to know. Not even friends.</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong><br> I&#39;m sorry, could you repeat that?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Yes, but in exchange, I want you to be my friend.</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong><br> ...Me... Your friend?</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong><br> ...I see.</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong><br> All this time, I thought that you and I...</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong><br> ...were more like an oppressor and his victim than anything else.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> What!? No! Not even close!</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong><br> So, you would call me your friend?</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong><br> ...Thank you. I will always cherish this memory.<br> But, there&#39;s something else I need to say.</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong><br> There is nothing I can do for you,<br> nothing I can give you after all you did for me.</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong><br> All I could do was stand around...even with all those heroes willing to risk their lives helping.</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong><br> I can&#39;t tell you how sorry I am about that.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> It&#39;s fine. Really.</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong><br> ...That only makes me feel worse.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Don&#39;t worry. This was fun.</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong><br> Fun, huh?</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong><br> You&#39;re a very positive person,<br> aren&#39;t you, Fujimaru? I&#39;m afraid I...</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong><br> ...Hm?<br> You know, now that I think of it, I had fun too.</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong><br> Even though I genuinely feared for my life back when we were fighting... Strange.</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong><br> ...Anyway, I&#39;m sure you still have a long, difficult road ahead.</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong><br> It may not be much\u2013hell, it may not even be welcome\u2013but, I&#39;d like to help you on it, if I can.</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong><br> So...since I am the Greater Grail&#39;s Custodian,<br> I&#39;m going to repurpose the terminal I made earlier.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> So, does that mean...?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Sieg?</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> I can still function as a terminal, but since my connection to my true body will be cut off...</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> ...I&#39;ll only be able to use my dragon power for a fraction of an instant.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> ...But, if that&#39;s okay with you...I&#39;d still like to do whatever I can to help you out.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> It&#39;s the least I can do for someone who considers me a friend.</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong><br> There. Now I really can rest easy.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> So you&#39;re going to stay here until this person shows up?</p><p><strong>Evil Dragon:</strong><br> Yes.
