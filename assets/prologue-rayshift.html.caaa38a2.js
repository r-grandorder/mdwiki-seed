Would you like hear the report, Commander Gordolf?</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> R-Right, we did have that question remaining as well! The amount of incomprehensible facts increasing even further does bother me, but...</p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/kTkfWiy.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> Things won&#39;t get better by refusing to listen! You are permitted to deliver your report! But make it quick!</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> First, I&#39;ll start with the information we were able to analyze.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> We&#39;ve now learned that the mysterious facility that our investigation team of Fujimaru, Mash, and Kadoc entered is...</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> ...actually a research facility that exists in our world as well.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Its purpose was to research some kind of outer space-originating object that had been secretly brought into Area 51, Nevada.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> We weren&#39;t able to examine the more intricate equipment, but according to the information recorded by Mash&#39;s Ortenaus...</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> The place is a 99% match with what TRISMEGISTUS calculates to be an Area 51 research facility.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Which is to say that the facility in which Subject: E was located is a place which has its origins in Pan-Human History.</p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/6kSHo3E.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Yeah... I guess that adds up.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> That building felt really out-of-place for a location in the large-scale Singularity.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> It wouldn&#39;t be odd to assume that the Singularity came into being with that operating room as its epicenter.</p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/vQW2Ld9.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Yep. I&#39;m of the same opinion. It ties into the question of what kind of person the Master was,</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> given the massive number of Servants that were summoned in the Singularity.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> In my opinion, it was only that operating room that was from Pan-Human History. Or rather, was from a planet exceedingly close to that of Pan-Human History.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> A facility located at the Nevada within CHALDEAS... Or maybe I&#39;m pushing this conclusion too far?</p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/TRUjIxt.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Wait... if only that facility was part of CHALDEAS...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Then, does that mean the cosmic-looking corridor was actually moving us between the different worlds?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Most likely, yes. There&#39;s this thing known as Substitution Magecraft in the world of magecraft.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> For instance, let&#39;s say we have a Gordolf A and a Gordolf B here.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> In the case that they have the exact same makeup and information load, they could \u201Cswap\u201D places no matter how distant they are to one another.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> And how come? Well, obviously because from a third party&#39;s point of view, they aren&#39;t different in the slightest.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Only the substituted people will know that they&#39;ve been swapped. Actually, depending on the circumstances, not even they would know.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Magecraft works best when something supernatural happens but the world can&#39;t notice the difference.</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> Mm. It&#39;s magecraft that&#39;s thought to be theoretically possible, at least. The larger the object, the more difficult it is, however.</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> I&#39;m fairly certain I&#39;ve heard it was being researched by some old lineage that doesn&#39;t affiliate with the Clock Tower.</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> Also, I&#39;d appreciate if you didn&#39;t use me as the example there.</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> If an A or a B got attached to the end of my name all of a sudden, I wouldn&#39;t be able to sleep at night anymore.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Substitution... swapping...</p><hr><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> So the reason Earth was suddenly bleached could&#39;ve been...</p><hr><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Because the surface of Earth and the surface of CHALDEAS were swapped?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> After all, miniature or not, CHALDEAS is indeed an identical entity to that of Earth, created by copying its soul, right.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> The difference in size isn&#39;t a big issue. As long as the information content and makeup of their souls are the same, swapping them is possible.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Honestly, more so than the nature of the Bleached Earth, the way it was carried out was always the more mysterious part.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Because it&#39;s impossible to destroy the entirety of Earth&#39;s civilization in an instant without harming the planet itself.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> But if instead, it was swapped out for something that had already been bleached, then you wouldn&#39;t have to hurt it...?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Right, which tells us that for CHALDEAS, our world, Earth, is still completely unhurt.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Meaning that as long as we restore the relationship between CHALDEAS and Earth to normal, your future will once again proceed as normal.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Everything will go back to normal, huh...</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> When the Earth was bleached, human history stopped at 2017. So it would just go back to operation normally as it was before.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> But, wait... CHALDEAS simulates the Earth as it is 100 years in the future.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> In that case, the facility would be one from 2117. But when you think about it from that perspective, like...</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> You&#39;re wondering why the facility was built using the same technology as found in 2017... basically, wouldn&#39;t that be too old?</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> That bothered me as well.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> I immediately realized that the room was part of CHALDEAS&#39; interior, but...</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> You couldn&#39;t have taken it as using cutting-edge technology from 2117. However, according to the data, Subject: E&#39;s time of death was just a few days prior.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> If that room was CHALDEAS, then Subject: E is a being that died in 2117.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> And yet, the level of the technology there was the same as ours in 2017.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> I was afraid I&#39;d be unable to explain anything if I didn&#39;t solve that contradiction, but...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Could it simply be that...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> The equipment couldn&#39;t be upgraded...?</p><hr><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Spot-on! It seems false, or even planned like complete nonsense, but that&#39;s correct!</p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/MFALK1i.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> The fact that there&#39;s a 100-year disparity remains, and so, we have no choice but to assume that the equipment couldn&#39;t be upgraded.</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> Uh-huh? Is that really so likely?</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Let&#39;s just assume that there were some circumstances that forced it to be like that.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Such as a lack of budget or personnel.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> In Pan-Human History, the top secret facility of Area 51 had been long-since closed down, since around 2001.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> The research budget they received from the government was cut off.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> In a similar fashion, the facility on the Earth of CHALDEAS must&#39;ve most likely ran into some kind of problem.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Well... I won&#39;t deny the possibility...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> After all, securing a budget is the top priority and yet also the most difficult task for researchers.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> However, there&#39;s a massive distinction to be made between the facility found on Earth, and the one in CHALDEAS.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> I&#39;m obviously talking about Subject: E. Given that this lifeform actually existed there...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> The facility on the Earth of CHALDEAS must&#39;ve accomplished something the one in Pan-Human History did not.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> In which case, it&#39;d be logical to think the opposite happened, and it was injected with enough funding to run a country.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> As I said, it \u201Cran into some kind of problem\u201D. The reason itself isn&#39;t important, so let&#39;s keep going, okay?</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> The remains we discovered in the operating room had the exact same biological composition as that of us humans.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> And despite that, TRISMEGISTUS II did not deem those remains to be that of an \u201CEarthling\u201D.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Not because it wasn&#39;t, but because it couldn&#39;t. His values were identical, yet different all the same\u2014</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Because of this logic error, TRISMEGISTUS II could not give a conclusive answer to what Subject: E was.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> At the very last stage of its calculations, it managed to apply the label of \u201Chuman\u201D to it, before freezing.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> As such, I put that conclusion on hold, and asked it to just analyze the situation.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> And when I did, the information lined up immediately.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> 1st Finding: Subject: E was a human from the Earth of CHALDEAS.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> 2nd Finding: If the Bleached Earth is CHALDEAS&#39; surface, then the mankind of CHALDEAS have already perished.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> 3rd Finding: The equipment used in the research facility of CHALDEAS&#39; Earth were antiques, therefore....</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> All technology developed in the 100-year span of 2017 to 2117 has become malfunctional.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> This is something that can be deduced from the structures that still remain on the Bleached Earth.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> If there are machines that could operate on the Bleached Earth, they would be antiques from 100 years prior.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Something like a motorcycle, or some such, that uses a simple combustion engine, perhaps.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> That is all which can be theorized from Subject: E. With that in mind...</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> If we want to ask ourselves why Subject: E become a Master...</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Why he summoned that many Servants, and why the large-scale Singularity came into being, then it could only be\u2014</p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/vGxAxus.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Revenge... The Earth of CHALDEAS was bleached.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Who knows how exactly, but we know the reason why.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> It was bleached in order to prepare for the swap between the our Earth and that of CHALDEAS.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Subject: E knew this, and that&#39;s why he applied the impulse for revenge on his Servants.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Basically, retribution against those who brought his world to ruin... Retribution against Pan-Human History.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Subject: E was fully aware that he was the last of all mankind.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Being the last person left in CHALDEAS&#39;s Earth essentially made him their Representative of Mankind.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> In fact... it&#39;d be impossible if that wasn&#39;t the case, considering the number of Servants involved.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Summoning that many Servants is impossible for a single individual.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> The will of the dead people of CHALDEAS&#39; Earth made it possible to summon such a massive number of Servants.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> The bizarre number of Command Spells makes perfect sense then.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Those were probably the Command Spells of the people from the Earth of CHALDEAS who had the potential to be a Master.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> And that corpse...</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> It must&#39;ve been someone like you; a nameless nobody who was saddled with mankind&#39;s future.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> ...(Wait, but that&#39;s...)</p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/lbDWTpw.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> You&#39;ve obtained the information on Subject: E.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> It&#39;s Chaldea&#39;s own job to analyze what Subject: E is... but I can kick in a freebie or two.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> That is no life form native to the Earth.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> It&#39;s the remains of a creature who spent a century in that laboratory concealed, examined, and experimented on.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> I believe that its death throes called its kin, the Alien God...</p><hr><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> Wait, wait, wait!</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> Whatever happened on the Earth of CHALDEAS is unfortunate, but it&#39;s not something we can do anything about!</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> There&#39;s no need for us to feel any guilt over it! Right now, we need to establish a proper timeline!</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> If I remember correctly, there was documentation that by the time of 2015 when our Fujimaru here arrived at Chaldea...</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> CHALDEAS had already entered a state where the future of mankind could not be observed.</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> Had CHALDEAS already been bleached by this point? How does that work!?</p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/7oO2zr3.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Meuni\xE8re:</strong><br> No, it hadn&#39;t. Sure, Singularity F happened, and the light of civilization had faded here and there,</p><p><strong>Meuni\xE8re:</strong><br> But the surface of CHALDEAS was the same as that of Earth&#39;s.</p><p><strong>Meuni\xE8re:</strong><br> It was SHEBA which announced that the security of human history couldn&#39;t be observed beyond 2016.</p><p><strong>Meuni\xE8re:</strong><br> That&#39;s something we can all vouch for.</p><p><strong>Meuni\xE8re:</strong><br> And given what would come after, SHEBA was right. Whether it was the Incineration of the Human Order, or the Bleaching, there was no future.</p><p><strong>Meuni\xE8re:</strong><br> The Earth of CHALDEAS was probably bleached after the Incineration had been resolved.</p><p><strong>Meuni\xE8re:</strong><br> Though it does mean we were tricked by CHALDEAS when we were in the middle of dealing with the special circumstances of 2017.</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> \u2014Hmm... So basically, CHALDEAS was in perfect order before the Rayshift experiment of 2015.</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> Or rather, it had yet to reveal its malicious true colors.</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> Which means it&#39;s possible to assume that Solomon&#39;s Human Order Incineration was unexpected, and that if that hadn&#39;t happened...</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> CHALDEAS was arranged to cause this current state of affairs at the end of 2016.</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> Solomon, or more accurately, Goetia, happened to throw a wrench into Marisbury&#39;s plans by accident.</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> So perhaps the plan to swap CHALDEAS and Earth was delayed by the emergence of Singularity F?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Oh, I see. The explosion in the control room wasn&#39;t part of Former Director Marisbury&#39;s plan, after all.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> As such, it helped create the strange situation that came about afterward, the one we currently have on our hands.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> It&#39;s Olga Marie. When Lev Lainur threw her into CHALDEAS, something must&#39;ve surely gone wrong somewhere.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> That is all for the information I can disclose about Subject: E.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Through this theorizing, we&#39;ve uncovered about 80% of what the purpose behind CHALDEAS&#39; creation is.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> It&#39;s to swap out Earth, or more accurately, mankind\u2014</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> The objective of the person who created CHALDEAS, Former Director Marisbury Animusphere, was to turn Earth into what we see before us.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> So then the next thing we then need to think about is what exactly he would have gained by doing that.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Yeah... Bleaching the Earth...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Who would benefit from it, and how?</p><hr><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/anRFNfo.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Sure is a thinker, that one... Neither me nor TRISMEGISTUS II have been able to come up with an answer to this question.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Goetia wished for life without death; a planet without death. Kirschtaria wished for the advancement of mankind.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> And Daybit tried to destroy the entire Earth together with CHALDEAS for the sake of, in his own words, \u201Cthe good name of the Earthlings\u201D.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Even if we couldn&#39;t sympathize with them, they all had understandable motives.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> The Bleaching of the Earth, on the other hand, just doesn&#39;t make sense. I can&#39;t see what the ultimate goal here is.</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> Did he just give up on mankind, perhaps? You know, wipe out mankind and purify Earth.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Marisbury...wasn&#39;t that kind of person. He wasn&#39;t a nihilist or a pessimist.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> He was a genuine magus, one who delighted in mankind&#39;s prosperity and desired the advancement of learning.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Makes sense. If he hadn&#39;t been that kind of person...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Then King Solomon wouldn&#39;t have answered his summons and cooperated with him during the Holy Grail War in Fuyuki.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Marisbury was most certainly an honest and respectable magus. However...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Honest and respectable comes in all sorts and kinds. Much in the same fashion as Daybit...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Marisbury&#39;s objective must be something where the logic is so extreme we cannot conceive of it as \u201Chonest and respectable\u201D.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Maybe so... He was a Lord from the Clock Tower, after all.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> His standard of what constitutes \u201Cprosperity\u201D must be far different from how we imagine it.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Yep. We&#39;ve now been able to establish only that our Earth is fine, and what the condition of CHALDEAS is like.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Everything will become clear to us at the Antarctic.

Technical Advisor, opinions, please!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> That&#39;s the thing! There is no activity coming from the Antarctic! This barrier has nothing to do with it!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> No, listen everyone. That is in all likelihood... the Wall of Human Order.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I know about this kind of protection. It&#39;s like Heroic Spirit Galahad&#39;s Noble Phantasm, Lord Camelot.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It&#39;s the same force powering this wall.

This is the first time I&#39;ve run into such an obnoxious barrier.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Its lack of physical form means it cannot be destroyed either. Trying to use special kinds of navigation gets them cancelled.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> I don&#39;t have the slightest clue what the logic behind this thing is.</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> How frustrating!

The accusation made by the mysterious stranger appears to have hit the mark.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> \u201CThe barrier surrounding the Antarctic is close to a self-purification function, and the cause of it lies within ourselves.\u201D</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> As much as it pains me to say, from the Human Order&#39;s perspective, we are basically like a pack of outlaws right now.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> We ourselves are denying our entry into the pure lands of the Antarctic, or something like that.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I had suspected it was something like that. It wasn&#39;t an attack, but a warning.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Normally, the Extra Classes are something which are beyond human control. So abusing them would obviously exclude us from the Human Order.</p><p><strong>Meuni\xE8re:</strong><br> It&#39;s sort of like we&#39;ve been using weapons outlawed by international humanitarian law with reckless abandon.</p><p><strong>Meuni\xE8re:</strong><br> Guilty as can be, aren&#39;t we... Oh.</p><p><strong>Meuni\xE8re:</strong><br> Sorry... Should&#39;ve chosen my words carefully. It was just an metaphor, nothing more...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I know. Thank you for clarifying, Meuni\xE8re.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> However, fact is fact. If CHALDEAS was created with an evil purpose in mind, then...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It is only right that the Demi-Servant experiment is to be suspected of being something similarly wicked.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> In light of that, it will be up to my own deeds to demonstrate the ethics of my own being.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> There are plenty of futures to choose, even for someone born out of injustice.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Fortunately, I have been granted the power of protection. In no way, shape, or form could such a power be something wicked.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> \u2014Yeah, you&#39;re right.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> You always knew that, didn&#39;t you, Mash?</p><hr><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> ... (Well said, Mash Kyrielight.)</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> (However, once outsiders come to learn of this incident, it&#39;s obvious you&#39;ll all be criticized for your actions.)</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> (As for what I can do for them... I&#39;m not sure. But there must be something I can do so this pack of fools end up being rewarded.)</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> \u2014Yeah. The Chaldea that Marisbury established was truly one of evil.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> However, what came afterward was undeniably one of good.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> After the course of events during the Rayshift experiment of 2015, the Chaldea of Director Marisbury came to an end.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Spiritually, and physically.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> The only staff remaining were a dozen or so normal people who didn&#39;t know of Marisbury&#39;s true intentions...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> As well as Romani Archaman, spurned on by his duty to prevent the Incineration of the Human Order.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> From then on, Chaldea was a different organization.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Rather than one meant to secure the future that the Animusphere had thought up and obsessed with, it was one meant to secure the manifold futures that humans dream of.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> And that won&#39;t be changing anytime soon.</p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/CkPlQbf.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> No worries, if there&#39;s some sort of problem with us, we&#39;ll just have to solve it with pluck and smarts like we always do\u2606</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> That person from before said there were \u201Cdistortions\u201D.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> So some Singularity-like aberrations must have formed elsewhere while we were hindered by this defect.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> We need to prove our own innocence by discovering these. We&#39;ll take care of the Antarctic afterward.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> You mean we&#39;re bringing the ship about, got it. I have no objections to that as captain.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> I was just thinking we should go back to the regions with still buildings standing to resupply anyway.</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> \u2014Very well. It&#39;s not like I thought things would go so smoothly regardless.</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> I suppose I&#39;ll just have to keep you all company a bit longer. Let&#39;s go all out, why don&#39;t we?</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Given that I&#39;m an alchemist from the Atlas Institute, being treated as a criminal due to the abuse of weaponry does hit quite the sore spot.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> I mean, isn&#39;t like half of this... or maybe at least a third of it, kinda my fault?</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> So, of course, I have no objections.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> I&#39;ll support you all in your search, together with TRISMEGISTUS II, of course.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> That&#39;s the situation... How do you feel about it, Fujimaru?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> It does mean the goal at the end of our journey will have to wait a bit, though.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> \u2014Of course! It&#39;d be my pleasure!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I appreciate everyone helping us out!</p><hr><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Great! Then let us begin the Storm Border&#39;s worldwide search!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> You could think of it as a warmup before we come face-to-face with CHALDEAS. Since we&#39;ll get the opportunity to resupply, it&#39;s practically all we could ask for.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> That said, this is no doubt an unprecedented search into the unknown.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> The distortions accumulated throughout our battles so far... The abuses of the Human Order we have to confront.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> It doesn&#39;t sit right with me to borrow the words of that person from before, but it&#39;s easy to understand, so let&#39;s go with it.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Operation \u201COrdeal Call\u201D! Once we have overcome these trials, our final destination awaits!</p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/i143clP.png" alt=""></p><h2 id="ordeal-call-0" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#ordeal-call-0" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Ordeal Call 0</h2><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/HOfzl0a.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Good, everyone&#39;s here. Sorry for calling on you all out of the blue.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> \u201CThe distortions accumulated throughout our battles so far... The abuses of the Human Order we have to confront.\u201D</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> \u201COperation &#39;Ordeal Call&#39;! Once we have overcome these trials, our final destination awaits!\u201D</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Despite all our declarations like this, the operations department had been wholly unable to come up with a strategy or course of action.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> But that disgrace ends today! Indeed, the reason I gathered you all here today is for one simple reason:</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> A proof of innocence to grant us entry to Antarctica.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> I will unveil to you the details to rectify the \u201Cdistortions\u201D which we have accumulated!</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> Oh, how very good!</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> Loitering around the bleached Earth with nothing to go on was only serving to make me depressed!</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> So what is it then? What is the weak point which we will target?</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> When you say \u201Cdistortion\u201D, I presume you mean Singularity, of which we who have surmounted seven Lostbelts no longer have anything to fear.</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> Come then, let&#39;s restore it and set sail for Antarctica right away, why don&#39;t we? What do you say, Fujimaru?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Singularities are always dangerous. Even now.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> You&#39;re probably right... Lostbelts represent a single history, so although their scale is much greater, the hostility of them is scarce.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Singularities, on the other hand, no matter how much smaller they may be in scale, do pose a threat to Pan-Human History.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> It&#39;s not really fair to make a comparison as to which is easier in the first place. Besides...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The Paper Moon shows nothing out of the ordinary. No Singularities seem to have been located as of now...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> But the Paper Moon shows nothing out of the ordinary...</p><hr><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Precisely. There have been no Singularities discovered for us to engage with.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> The words spoken by \u201CRomani Archaman\u201D could be summed up as \u201CSolve for x\u201D,</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> but we haven&#39;t been able to find any places of abnormality on the bleached Earth. In other words, a \u201Cquestion sheet\u201D doesn&#39;t even exist.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Right, if there&#39;s no enemy on the radar, there&#39;s nothing to torpedo in the first place. I feel like an orca in a sea devoid of whales.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> It&#39;s been several weeks now that we&#39;ve been flying around, looking for a Singularity, but we&#39;ve come up empty-handed, as you&#39;re well aware.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> There are neither charts nor compass to navigate by here.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> I even blurted out one time that it even being a Lostbelt would have been so much better.</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> Mm. Rather than smooth sailing, it would be more appropriate to say that there has been nothing but a perfect lull... It&#39;s no wonder I&#39;ve been putting on weight...</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> So what do we do, then? If there is nothing to find on the surface, then perhaps the sky...</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> Yes, what about the altitudes reaching into the stratosphere?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> That&#39;s a last resort. The Storm Border isn&#39;t a spaceship, so I would prefer to avoid having to use it as one.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Rather, what&#39;s actually the case is that we were mistaken from the start. The idea of \u201CFind the solution\u201D was erroneous.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> After all, the enemy this time is not \u201Cexternal\u201D, but \u201Cinternal\u201D\u2014inside Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> If you were repelling abnormalities as the Human Order Security encapsulating Antarctica, what&#39;s the first thing you&#39;d scrutinize?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Do you have any idea, Fujimaru?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Enforce the dress code?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Ensure nobody drunk gets by?</p><hr><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Just so. In order to make that happen, we first have to understand what \u201Cstate we&#39;re in right now\u201D.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> And for that purpose\u2014</p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/DkumMrt.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Nemo Professor:</strong><br> Finally, I was so tired of waiting~. I&#39;m so happy it&#39;s finally my turn to speeaaak~.</p><p><strong>Nemo Professor:</strong><br> Now then, eyes up front, please.</p><p><strong>Nemo Professor:</strong><br> This new device was created at the request of Da Vinci, produced in collaboration with Sion...</p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/5F59AmS.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Nemo Professor:</strong><br> It&#39;s name is the \u201CHuman Order Foundation Display\u201D~.</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> Oh? A Human Order Foundation Display. So it&#39;s\u2014 what is it?</p><p><strong>Nemo Professor:</strong><br> It&#39;s exactly what it sounds like~. We put emphasis on clarity this time, see?</p><p><strong>Nemo Professor:</strong><br> It&#39;s different from the Human Order Foundation Value measurement, as it doesn&#39;t analyze the Human Order Foundation of an entire human history.</p><p><strong>Nemo Professor:</strong><br> Rather, it measures that of the Storm Border itself. An \u201Cevent discrepancy measurement/tuning meter\u201D, in other words.</p><p><strong>Nemo Professor:</strong><br> Sion, would you elaborate~?</p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/b2OTIZA.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> It&#39;s simple enough. No different than having your baggage checked when entering a country.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> The value on the display shows Chaldea&#39;s\u2014or everyone&#39;s, I should say\u2014current \u201Cdistortion\u201D.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> At present, it&#39;s at E. That&#39;s the worst possible rank.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> TRISMEGISTUS II declared that when we manage to get it back to A, we will be able to cross over the \u201CWall of the Human Order\u201D in Antarctica.</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> Oh... That&#39;s rather dreadful. Are we really at the lowest rank?</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> We are. One really has to wonder how we managed to take it this far without noticing anything. What do you think, Fou?</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou, foufou. Fou.</p><p><strong>Meuni\xE8re:</strong><br> But how are you proposing that we restore our Human Order Foundation?</p><p><strong>Meuni\xE8re:</strong><br> We haven&#39;t been able to find any Singularities, right? So are we just supposed to keep sitting here on our hands?</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> We are. At least for now. It is the best, and arguably the only correct thing we can do.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> I&#39;ve already discussed this with Da Vinci, but Romani Archaman used the word \u201Ccall\u201D.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> I don&#39;t think the implication is for us to be \u201Ccalled in\u201D, but rather that \u201Cwe will call\u201D for something.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> As soon as I started thinking about it like this, I started to understand.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> The \u201CHuman Order Foundation Display\u201D is not just a measuring device, but also something to help make things clear.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> It was devised as an internal/external alarm, basically screaming \u201CHey look, there are serial rule violators here!\u201D,</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> and a signal to call the countless past ordeals of order restoration back to us.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Calling out...ordeals...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> In hindsight, that seems correct. A distortion of the body is something to be mended by one&#39;s own hands.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> There isn&#39;t actually anything wrong with the world itself.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I see.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Then...it&#39;s finally time for</p><hr><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Indeed. We finally stand at the precipice of these ordeals. We have sounded the Ordeal Call.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> What is our offense against the Human Order? What must we do to atone?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> When given those questions, TRISMEGISTUS II replied:</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> \u201CYour wrongdoing is a lack of awareness. Rather than utilizing them thoughtlessly, you must understand for what reason each of them exist.\u201D</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> \u201CAssertation. Comprehension. Separation.\u201D \u201CPossibly also consignment. An oath.\u201D</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> \u201CYou must answer these questions. Each time you do, a distortion will be rectified.\u201D</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Well, as things are right now, I really have no idea what it&#39;s trying to say.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> (Rather than utilizing them thoughtlessly\u2014)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> (Understand the meaning of each existence)</p><hr><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/TFibsrK.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> It&#39;s fine, there&#39;s no need to overthink it right now, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> After all, we&#39;re not sailing toward the ordeals. They will come our way.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> We just have to prepare ourselves. When the time comes, we simply have to give it all we got.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> \u2014Alright. Now then, this is our strategy!</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> The ship will continue investigating the bleached Earth, while we strengthen ourselves in preparation for the approaching final battle.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> To be more specific\u2014we are now able to enhance servant classes!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Class enhancement...?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> You&#39;re kidding... (Is this new?)</p><hr><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Not kidding at all. It&#39;s something that&#39;s been under development for quite some time now.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Our \u201CHuman Order Foundation Value\u201D has decreased significantly.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> With the seven Lostbelts excised, the base foundations of human history have greatly improved.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Meaning that the summon spells that utilize human history as the information source to call upon Heroic Spirits have gained a much firmer platform.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Da Vinci and Sion have called this a \u201CClass Score\u201D.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Class Score enhancement does not apply to any individual Heroic Spirit, but to an entire class. All servants within that class will be strengthened.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Strengthening your score will aid you in the fight ahead,</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> and TRISMEGISTUS II predicts that it will be our ace in the hole in the final fight against the Alien God.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> If you want to learn more, please ask Professor later.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> That concludes my report from the ship. Now then\u2014</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> I want you to remain cautious, and work hard to hone your self-discipline. I expect great things from each and every one of you!</p>', 430);
