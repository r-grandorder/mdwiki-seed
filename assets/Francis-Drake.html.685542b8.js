Although it&#39;s like our voyage with Captain Drake never happened, we still remember it clearly.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> I don&#39;t remember it at all. When Mash says &quot;I&#39;m happy to see you again,&quot; I have no idea what she means.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> But still, I get all weepy thinking &quot;yeah, there was that,&quot;<br> so you must be telling the truth.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou...</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Aww, enough with the mushy stuff.<br> I came here to talk about something fun!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Something fun?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Making money?</p><hr><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> That&#39;s right! I may be out of the pirate business,<br> but I&#39;ve still got my sea legs, Captain!</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> I heard something interesting.<br> A story about an island with buried treasure.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> How about it? Want to go have some fun?<br> The more of these, the better, right?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> These? Senpai, why is Captain Drake doing this thing with her index finger and thumb?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Haha! Don&#39;t worry about it, Mash. I like the sound of the word treasure island! Adventure awaits!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Fujimaru, let&#39;s take Captain Drake up on her kind offer.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> So, Captain,<br> which sea in particular is this treasure island?</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Hmm? Um, let me see...<br> The Bermuda... Something? Triangle, maybe?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> \u2014What did you say?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> T-That was... Awful...<br> I&#39;ve never seen a storm like that...</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Yeah? That was nothing bad...<br> The ship only flew up in the air twice, right?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Ships aren&#39;t supposed to fly up in the air, Captain...<br> I got seasick watching it on the monitor. How bad is it...</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Does it matter? We made it to the island.<br> And we&#39;re the first ones here.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> But well...<br> It looks like we&#39;ve got a welcoming committee.</p><p><strong>Monster:</strong><br> FUoooooooOOOOOOo!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> !!! These look like the monsters that live on this island!<br> Master, your orders!</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Now this is what I call an adventure! I got nothing against you, but if you&#39;re in my way, I&#39;ll take you on!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Get out of my way if you want to survive!</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> If you win, we&#39;re your dinner!<br> If we win, you&#39;re finished!</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> If you&#39;re okay with that, then come at me!<br> I&#39;ll strip you to the bone, and sell your meat and pelts!</p><p><strong>Monster:</strong><br> GUeeeeeeeeee!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...It was very nice of you to let the monsters run away like that, Captain.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Huh? I didn&#39;t save them. I just didn&#39;t want to kill too many and hurt this island&#39;s ecosystem.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> We&#39;ll be rich if these pelts go for a high price back on land. Then, it&#39;ll be our loss if none of them are left, right?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I-I see... Ahaha...<br> That&#39;s right, this is the kind of person Captain Drake is...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Everybody, I think there&#39;s a cave over there. But I&#39;m picking up a weird reading. Be careful if you go in.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> It&#39;s nice to have a scout.<br> Okay, let&#39;s be careful on our way in then.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Man, we hit the jackpot.<br> A typical little treasure room.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> It probably belonged to pirates who lived in this area.<br> The treasure&#39;s still here, so of course\u2014</p><p><strong>Monster:</strong><br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/XAqlQYL.png" alt="berserk1">\u2014!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> There&#39;s a guard.<br> Captain Drake, can we defeat it?</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Go ahead. I don&#39;t see traps that&#39;ll blow up the treasure.<br> Have fun!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Roger.<br> Master, let&#39;s rip this thing apart!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Is that the last of the guards?<br> Then let&#39;s get that treasure\u2014</p><p><strong>Teach:</strong><br> Yar! I see the old hag&#39;s here too!<br> I see ya still got those needlessly huge knockers! Bwaha!</p><p><strong>Both:</strong><br> \u2014Geh<br> \u2014Geh</p><p><strong>Teach:</strong><br> Arrr! But that cutie next to ya is just my type!<br> Must be fate that brought us together here\u2014</p><p><strong>Teach:</strong><br> I guess the goddess loves this boy after all!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Senpai, no, Master Fujimaru. Give me your orders, now.<br> Give me permission to blast the enemy to ash.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> What is that thing? WHAT IS THAT THING!?<br> I&#39;ve never seen anything so creepy!</p><p><strong>Teach:</strong><br> Bwahahahaah!<br> The old hag&#39;s blushin&#39; again, ain&#39;t she!?</p><p><strong>Teach:</strong><br> I understand your shock, see.<br> I ain&#39;t no ordinary Teach right now.</p><p><strong>Teach:</strong><br> A phantom of the love hunter, brought here by the space-time scrambling in this area... I&#39;m a copy of him.</p><p><strong>Teach:</strong><br> I have double the power, double the power, AND double the power I normally got! I&#39;m a Super Servant!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> So basically you&#39;re just twice as strong as usual.</p><p><strong>Teach:</strong><br> Ho-ho-ho! Your words hurt me! But it feels so good!</p><p><strong>Teach:</strong><br> Come on, old hag!<br> This time, those cups of yers are mine!</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Cups!? I don&#39;t have any cups!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Captain, there&#39;s no need to listen to him!<br> The only thing you need to do is attack!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Teach:</strong><br> I lost... Again...<br> LOL Can&#39;t help it, can I? I&#39;m just a ghost...</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> What on Earth was that?</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> \u2014Okay, I&#39;m forgetting it.<br> The best thing to do is just forget it.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Anyway, onto the treasure...<br> Oh, this looks great!</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Ores, jewels, antiques!<br> Stuff that&#39;s easy to sell, and holds its value!</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> You grab some stuff too, Fujimaru!<br> Let&#39;s enjoy these spoils together!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...If you say so...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> ...I-I only need one!</p><hr><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Okay, that&#39;s all the good stuff.<br> Let&#39;s go.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> \u2013? Captain, there&#39;s still more antiques left.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Leave&#39;em. We don&#39;t have a lot of people,<br> and there&#39;s no point in being greedy.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> But I did forget one thing.<br> ...Okay, there we go.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> You made a mark on the inside the chest?<br> Captain Drake, what was that for?</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> I drew a golden deer.<br> To show I was here first.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Any dumb pirate who opens this up after me will say,<br> &quot;Curse ye, Golden Hind!&quot;</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> And my reputation will keep spreading.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> A deer... A golden deer?</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Come on, let&#39;s go Fujimaru.<br> Let&#39;s get back to land and throw a big party!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Y-Yeah, if you say so, Captain.<br> Come on, let&#39;s go Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> You&#39;re right, there&#39;s no point in staying.<br> Who knows when another pirate will come.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Let&#39;s just enjoy what the Captain got for us this time.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Right. Let&#39;s go to a bar and hear Captain Drake sing.</p><h2 id="pioneer-of-the-stars" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#pioneer-of-the-stars" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Pioneer of the Stars</h2><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> And that&#39;s why we&#39;re off on another voyage! There&#39;s nothing quite like the feel of the wind on the open sea, is there, Senpai!?</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Right? I wouldn&#39;t call Chaldea cramped or anything,<br> but you&#39;re still just holed up inside!</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Glad I could get you outta that place for once. You&#39;ve gotta spend time under the sun while you&#39;re still young!</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Otherwise you&#39;ll end up twisted and misanthropic,<br> no matter how smart or chivalrous you may start out.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Ain&#39;t that right, Mr. Super Genius?</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong><br> Hmph. You wound me, Captain.<br> I must say, your theory is wholly without merit!</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong><br> The greatest effect a secluded environment can have on one&#39;s personality development is to enhance one&#39;s self-sufficiency!</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong><br> Should that make one twisted is an entirely separate issue. Were I discussing this with anyone else, I would dismiss it out of hand, but...</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> But what?</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong><br> Coming from you, Captain Drake, I am happy to accept your words, criticism or otherwise. I&#39;m honored you invited me to join you.</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong><br> We may be very different people, but I respect your initiative and your capability a great deal.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Glad to hear that. I&#39;d hate to kick this voyage off with a shoot-out, after all.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Spare me the formalities though. Just having a good-looking guy around brightens things up.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Now...why did I invite you again?</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> I think I just wanted you to see how a proper voyage goes.</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> Yeah! You hear that, Tight-Suit?<br> Forget your steamboats! Forget your diesel engines!</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> A REAL sailor goes wherever the wind takes him! The sea&#39;s a battlefield, where REAL men proudly display their browsing history!</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> Having a tinkerer or ten like you aboard wouldn&#39;t help ANYTHING! Nothing!</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> All your AC can do out here is to make your noob death quicker by getting zapped when you fall into the water! Now scram!</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong><br> By the way, Captain Drake,<br> what is that seedy little man doing here?</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> ...Oh, that? Just a damn stowaway.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Didn&#39;t notice him sneak on. Must be losing my edge.<br> I HAVE had a bad feeling this whole time, though.</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> Duhuhu. Bad feeling? Hope you&#39;re not thinkin&#39; that gives you the high ground!</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> You spoil me with such attention, old hag! Y&#39;better stop that before you light me up like a schoolgirl!</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> Though I must say... (Sniff, sniff, sniff)<br> This deck is scrubbed so clean you could eat off it...</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> In fact, I think you could even lick it directly...<br> No, it DEMANDS to be licked directly!</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong></p><p>Very well then, pardon me while I show this deck soaked with your haggish scent some well-deserved love\u2013</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Just jump overboard with the rest of the trash and DIE already!</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong></p><p>Doof!</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Ugh, you&#39;re disgusting! You could&#39;ve taken your own damn ship if you felt like going out to sea!</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong></p><p>Huhuhu, you underestimate my sense of smell, old hag.<br> I caught the scent of money to be made on this ship.</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> If you&#39;re going out to sea, you&#39;d better believe I&#39;m coming along, old hag. I&#39;m not about to let you hog all the glory for yourself.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> ...(Sigh). You&#39;re technically a sailor, right? So I don&#39;t hafta tell you what happens to stowaways, do I?</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> Huh? You&#39;re kidding... You don&#39;t even know what the latest international treaties are? So you&#39;re an old-fashioned old hag?</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> All right, time to off him for good. Master, Chaldea&#39;s not gonna miss one little Servant, right?</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Here, I&#39;ll show you what happens when revolting scumbags break the laws of the sea.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> I always wanted to try gutting a fish after stringing it up. I think I&#39;ll start by hanging this one upside down and cutting him in half!</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong></p><p>Aah! Don&#39;t you think that&#39;d be a bit too much gore for Fujimaru&#39;s delicate sensibilities? [\u2642 He /\u2640\uFE0F She}&#39;s not even old enough for R-rated movies!</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> Please, [\u2642 Mistah /\u2640\uFE0F Missy} Fujimaru, help!<br> Before the old hag has her way with me!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Now now, I&#39;m sure he means well... Probably...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I know he&#39;s a scumbag, but try to let it go.</p><hr><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> Ahhh, that&#39;s my Master for you! Now we can cook up some wonderfully wicked schemes together!</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> ...(Sigh) You&#39;re too soft on him, you know that?</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> But, since he&#39;s here now,<br> we might as well find a use for him.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Gotta recoup my investment on this Rayshift somehow, especially after all the loot I had to give the Doctor.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> You paid him?<br> I thought our Rayshift here was a secret...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Of course not, Mash. As the Acting Director,<br> you&#39;d better believe I&#39;m keeping my eye on things.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> That aside, I appreciate your enthusiasm, Captain Drake.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> How could I refuse once you told me it would benefit Fujimaru as well?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I do have to ask, though: Are you sure about that time period, Captain? Wouldn&#39;t the simulator have worked just as well?</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Oh? You worried, Doc?<br> You&#39;re a lot sharper than you look!</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> But relax. There&#39;s a reason I chose this time period.<br> It means a lot to me.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> The way I see it...</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> ...this is the only lesson I can teach Fujimaru here.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...This time period means a lot to you?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> ...You have a lesson to teach me...?</p><hr><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Whoops, guess that&#39;s enough chitchat.<br> Just forget it!</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> All right, we&#39;re almost at our first destination.<br> Make ready for mooring!</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> Well now... This is San Juli\xE1n!</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> Hm? Wait...this wouldn&#39;t happen to be June of 1578,<br> would it? Are you serious, you old hag?</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Ugh, you really are disgusting...<br> Yeah, it is.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> My fleet is docked here after we left Plymouth to sail around the world.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> What if we run into the real you from this time then?</p><hr><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Don&#39;t worry. I know where my old crew is and I&#39;d never leave the ship unless I had to.</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> But...isn&#39;t San Juli\xE1n the place where Thomas\u2013</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Keep your filthy yap shut.<br> I&#39;ll tell &#39;em myself.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> ...Tonight, one of my fleet&#39;s ships,<br> the Swan, is gonna desert me.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> It&#39;s commanded by a noble called Thomas Doughty.<br> He was one of my best friends...till he turned traitor.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Nikola Tesla.<br> Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> I want you two to capture Thomas for me.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> I still remember his escape route,<br> so that should make it easy for you to ambush him.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Hm? Hang on. Are you trying to change the course of history, Captain?</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Nah, couldn&#39;t even if I wanted to.<br> Besides, I don&#39;t wanna do everything over again.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> I&#39;ve always played the hand life dealt me. If I ever had any regrets, I&#39;ve already forgotten &#39;em.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> All I want is to get Thomas to tell you why he did it.<br> You can let him go once he has.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> That way, the past&#39;ll still stay the same, right?</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> It&#39;ll still be the real, living me catching him after he thinks he got away with it.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...Hmm. True, that shouldn&#39;t cause any problems.<br> But why go to all this trouble?</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> I&#39;ll tell you when all&#39;s said and done. Now get moving. I&#39;m gonna stay behind, since I think being there would only complicate things.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Well this is weird. I know what Captain Drake said,<br> but she IS an infamous pirate...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I can&#39;t rule out the possibility that she&#39;s planning to misuse this Rayshift for something really bad...</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong><br> I considered those risks as well, Doctor.<br> But you may rest assured.</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong><br> She is a captain, a title synonymous with justice.<br> She would never Rayshift solely for personal gain.</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> No way... Captains are synonymous with justice...?<br> Then, does that mean all MY actions are in the right!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Shut it, Blackbeard.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Go shave your beard, Teach.</p><hr><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> (Sniffle)</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong><br> Besides, if she were to engage in piracy again,<br> it would be in the modern era, not the past.</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong><br> Thanks to the high-quality products on the market,<br> there is more money to be earned nowadays.</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong><br> She would not have invited Master to this time unless there is something that can only be found here.</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong><br> In which case, all we need do is watch over her.<br> Don&#39;t you agree, Romani Archaman?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...(Sigh) I can never tell what you mad geniuses are thinking. But okay, I&#39;ll trust you, Nikola.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Fujimaru, Mash.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> This mission probably won&#39;t be TOO dangerous,<br> but make sure you keep your eyes peeled anyway.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> You don&#39;t want to miss whatever it is Captain Drake wants you to learn.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Understood. I&#39;ll stay by Master&#39;s side and remain vigilant.</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> By the way, can I make a case for my utility now?</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> You do know this is MY ship you&#39;re all lounging about on, right?</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> You know, the Queen Anne&#39;s Revenge.<br> She&#39;s my pride and joy.</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> You should try using my Noble Phantasm now and then.<br> It&#39;s pretty good, if I do say so myself.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Oh yes, I know all about it.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> It&#39;s very one-sided.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes, when it comes to maritime battles,<br> your Noble Phantasm is, uh...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...third after Captain Drake&#39;s and that older captain with the white beard!</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong><br> Indeed. While I do think you&#39;ll eventually fall to fourth place, for now, you are still technically in the top three.</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong></p><p>Are you serial, Nikola!?<br> Jason&#39;s the ONE guy I refuse to lose to!</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> ...But never mind future stuff that&#39;s never gonna happen anyway.</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> Tell me, [\u2642 Mistah /\u2640\uFE0F Missy} Fujimaru,<br> what do YOU think of the old hag&#39;s plan?</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> I have no idea what to make of it,<br> and it pisses me off that Tight-Suit there does.</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> Does it have something to do with them both being pioneers? She doesn&#39;t really go in for those smarty-pants types, does she?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> What do you mean by that, Teach?</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> Well, I&#39;ll try not to go on about it TOO much, but...<br> Well, in that old hag&#39;s case...</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> ...sailing around the world was nothing more than a fairy tale until she went and pulled it off.</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> Once people knew it was possible, it went from miraculous to achievable. Of course, there were technological breakthroughs involved as well...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> What does he mean by that, Tesla?</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong><br> Hmm. I trust you&#39;ve heard the word \u201Cbreakthrough\u201D before?</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong><br> While it&#39;s commonly used to refer to formerly impossible things becoming possible, or limits being surpassed...</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong><br> ...those are merely evolutionary steps. Living creatures naturally take such steps over the course of their lifetime.</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong><br> A true breakthrough happens when obstacles hindering technology or a civilization&#39;s development cease to be an obstruction.</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong><br> \u201CIt will take decades for this breakthrough to come to fruition.\u201D \u201CThis is simply not possible with our current technology.\u201D</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong><br> Problems like that have appeared throughout all of human history. One could even consider them the will of God attempting to hold back mankind&#39;s evolution.</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong><br> But now and then, someone special will manage a breakthrough with currently available technology and resources alone.</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong><br> From then on, the knowledge they gained from overcoming that obstacle becomes something shared with the rest of humanity.</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong><br> These people are known as pioneers in recognition of their achievements...</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong><br> ...for they are the ones who paved the way for the expansion of humanity&#39;s knowledge beyond its limits.</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong><br> In brief, I suppose you could say they are people who made the impossible possible.</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong><br> Of course, that&#39;s much easier said than done. A real breakthrough is an incredible feat, and most people who managed one were mocked mercilessly by laymen.</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong><br> They were dismissed as mere eccentrics with delusions of grandeur for thinking they could succeed at something everyone else knew to be impossible.</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong><br> Captain Drake and myself are prime examples of that... Though of course, I never had her charisma.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Um, excuse me. I&#39;m sorry to interrupt,<br> but it looks like the Swan is here...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> So...we need to board it and take it over, right?<br> Otherwise, Thomas is just going to get away...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Right. But be careful not to kill him,<br> or you&#39;ll change the course of history.</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong></p><p>Can you smeeell what the Nik is cooking!?</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong><br> &#39;Cause we&#39;re cooking with ALTERNATING CURRENT now!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Wow.<br> That just instantly knocked out all the pirates.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> This is your doing, isn&#39;t it, Teach?</p><hr><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> Yus. He already looks like a heel,<br> so I thought this would be the perfect intro for him.</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> I never thought he&#39;d actually run with it though.<br> Now I dunno how I can follow it up...</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong><br> Heh. I suppose I got carried away. But I hope you&#39;ll understand I was still holding back. I certainly didn&#39;t mean to reveal my stun gun quite like this.</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong><br> It must have been quite a shock for Thomas,<br> figuratively and literally speaking.</p><p><strong>Thomas Doughty:</strong><br> Oogh... What was that lightning...?<br> Was that St. Elmo&#39;s fire or something...?</p><p><strong>Thomas Doughty:</strong><br> Is this God&#39;s way of telling me this is a mistake...?<br> But... Dammit, even if it is, I still\u2013</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> Hey, don&#39;t ragequit now.<br> God ain&#39;t real, but I sure as hell am.</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> You really stepped in it this time,<br> didn&#39;t you, Tommy boy?</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> Ya got guts, pulling a fast one on Francis Drake.<br> Actually almost makes me wanna ask you for lessons.</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> Anyways, I don&#39;t see what you&#39;re getting out of this.<br> And you&#39;re practically skin and bones.</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> I don&#39;t get it.<br> Why&#39;re you doing this?</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> Why betray Drake?<br> You can&#39;t possibly be getting any money out of this.</p><p><strong>Thomas Doughty:</strong><br> Did Drake send you? Please, you&#39;ve gotta spare me.<br> I can&#39;t afford to die here.</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> We&#39;re not talking about sparing anyone.<br> I don&#39;t care if you live or die.</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> All I wanna know is what&#39;s up with the backstabbing.<br> It&#39;s all I can think about anymore.</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> Can&#39;t even pirate doujin in peace until I get answers.<br> If you can&#39;t give &#39;em, you&#39;re no good to me alive.</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> If killing you&#39;s the only way to get this nagging question to shut up, I&#39;m game.</p><p><strong>Thomas Doughty:</strong><br> W-wait, please! I&#39;ll tell you, I promise!</p><p><strong>Thomas Doughty:</strong><br> ...It was when she revealed the goal of this voyage back at San Juli\xE1n.</p><p><strong>Thomas Doughty:</strong><br> At first, she went around recruiting investors, saying we were gonna get rich by attacking Spanish treasure ships. Then we put together a fleet and set out from Plymouth.</p><p><strong>Thomas Doughty:</strong><br> What she didn&#39;t say was that her REAL plan was to sail around the world. ...She even kept it a secret from me, her best friend.</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> ...Oh yeah, I remember now.</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> You&#39;re the one who introduced Francis Drake to Queen Elizabeth.</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> That&#39;s great. You did a real good thing there.<br> Wish I had friends among royalty.</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> Say, think you can still pull that off?<br> I&#39;d love to get an invite to a fancy ball or something.</p><p><strong>Thomas Doughty:</strong><br> ...No, I can&#39;t. You&#39;re not fit to set foot in the palace. You&#39;ve got no dignity, and no destiny.</p><p><strong>Thomas Doughty:</strong><br> I can&#39;t take credit for Drake meeting the queen.<br> That much was fated to happen.</p><p><strong>Thomas Doughty:</strong><br> They made that decision on their own. It was their bravery, their duty, their sense of adventure that made it happen.</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> Huh. That it?</p><p><strong>Thomas Doughty:</strong><br> ...I fell hard for her,<br> seeing her shining so bright.</p><p><strong>Thomas Doughty:</strong><br> She always had an incredible abundance of charm, but I sensed she had even greater potential as a sailor.</p><p><strong>Thomas Doughty:</strong><br> I truly did want to support her dream.<br> But...</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Thomas Doughty:</strong><br> ...But it&#39;s too soon.<br> It&#39;s too reckless.</p><p><strong>Thomas Doughty:</strong><br> From everything I&#39;ve seen, sailing around the world isn&#39;t going to pan out. We lost a number of ships just getting here, and everyone&#39;s shaken.</p><p><strong>Thomas Doughty:</strong><br> Morale was low even before she revealed her true goal out of nowhere. Now it&#39;s completely shot.</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong><br> Sounds like an eleventh-hour effort. Perhaps she believed revealing her intentions would unite the crew.</p><p><strong>Thomas Doughty:</strong><br> So what if it did!? Nobody&#39;s pulled off a voyage like this in decades, not since Magellan!</p><p><strong>Thomas Doughty:</strong><br> So I took the Swan and some of the crew hoping it would make her give up on this around the world nonsense.</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> Hah! Did you really think that would make Drake,<br> of ALL people, give up?</p><p><strong>Thomas Doughty:</strong><br> ...You&#39;re right. Now that I stop and think about it, I should&#39;ve known better.</p><p><strong>Thomas Doughty:</strong><br> Running off with one of her ships wouldn&#39;t even slow her down, let alone stop her altogether.</p><p><strong>Thomas Doughty:</strong><br> But at least let me say this.<br> She&#39;s the real thing...the REAL real thing.</p><p><strong>Thomas Doughty:</strong><br> That&#39;s why I couldn&#39;t let her die like a dog in a place like this... I wanted her to live on!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Then, does this mean we just stopped Mr. Doughty from risking his life to help Drake...?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> The way things are going, this Drake will...</p><hr><p><strong>Thomas Doughty:</strong><br> ...Most people in her position would fail miserably,<br> and never return to tell the tale.</p><p><strong>Thomas Doughty:</strong><br> But maybe that&#39;s just an excuse for cowards like me.</p><p><strong>Thomas Doughty:</strong><br> If the crew of her ship, the Golden Hind,<br> can all come together...</p><p><strong>Thomas Doughty:</strong><br> ...she might just be able to make it all the way to the end, no matter how difficult the voyage or how many lives are lost.</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong><br> Except you&#39;ve dashed any hope that crew had of ever coming together. Now that the deer&#39;s leg is broken, it won&#39;t soon be healed.</p><p><strong>Thomas Doughty:</strong><br> ...Yeah, you&#39;re right.</p><p><strong>Thomas Doughty:</strong><br> That&#39;s why I&#39;ve gotta go back alive.<br> As a traitor.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Huh...?</p><p><strong>Thomas Doughty:</strong><br> I&#39;m not begging for my life because I&#39;m afraid of dying.<br> I just want to choose the way I die.</p><p><strong>Thomas Doughty:</strong><br> Once I&#39;m taken back, I&#39;ll be put on trial. Drake will decide what to do with me, and I&#39;ll get the punishment I deserve for betraying her.</p><p><strong>Thomas Doughty:</strong><br> Once that&#39;s over with,<br> the crew will be united again.</p><p><strong>Thomas Doughty:</strong><br> After that...what happens&#39;ll be up to her.<br> It doesn&#39;t matter what the rest of the world thinks.</p><p><strong>Thomas Doughty:</strong><br> From there on out, it&#39;ll just be a story about Francis Drake fighting against destiny.</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> That so? Ugh, this is a sickening plot twist.<br> It&#39;s even more boring than I could&#39;ve imagined.</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> And here I thought you were hiding a stash of treasure you stole from her all this time. What a letdown.</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> There&#39;s no point in killing you.<br> Go on, get out of here. I ain&#39;t gonna stop you.</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> Just don&#39;t tell anyone about us, you hear? Breathe a word, and I&#39;ll put a bullet between your eyes before you can blink.</p><p><strong>Thomas Doughty:</strong><br> ...Thank you. I owe you one.</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> Hah, first time I&#39;ve been thanked by a dead man walking. Eh, not like you&#39;re gonna last much longer.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Hey, you&#39;re back.<br> How&#39;d it go?</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> No fun at all. It was like waiting in line at GameShop all night for a new release only to have them sell out before you even get through the doors.</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> No, Thomas didn&#39;t have anything to say for himself.<br> He was a Doughty in every sense of the word!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Um, Captain Drake...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> The truth is...</p><hr><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> Aww, why&#39;d you have to spill the beans?<br> I wanted it to be our little secret.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> So that&#39;s the story, huh.<br> Well, I figured it was something like that.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Drake...</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> But I already had my heart set on sailing around the world. Giving up on that would be giving up on everything I am.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> If that means my best friend ends up dying, that&#39;s just how it is. Whether he was a traitor or not, he still got in my way, so I had to kick him overboard.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> And that&#39;s not just hindsight speaking.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Even if I had learned about this back when I was still alive, I wouldn&#39;t have done anything differently.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Then, why did you go to all this trouble?</p><hr><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> &#39;Cause I wanted you to know that life&#39;s not all sunshine and rainbows.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Shit happens. A lot. And often as not,<br> there&#39;s nothing you can do about it.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Sometimes, someone you thought was your friend turns out to be working against you, and sometimes, someone you hated enough to kill ends up being someone you respect more than anyone.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> People may see me as this great pioneer,<br> but deep down, I&#39;m just like you.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Sometimes things break my way, sometimes they don&#39;t.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> That&#39;s just how it is, for everyone.<br> So...you know. What I&#39;m trying to say is...</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> ...it&#39;s all right if you screw up sometimes, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Sure, you got a lot riding on your shoulders,<br> but it&#39;s not the end of the world if you drop it.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Maybe someone else&#39;ll pick up the pieces.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Or maybe letting a few things go will let you keep to the path.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> So just take it easy, all right? Life&#39;s a coin toss;<br> it always comes up either heads or tails.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Sometimes, a friend might stab you in the back, and sometimes, an enemy might be the love of your life.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> That&#39;s not to say having a friend like Thomas die on me was easy. But if you can look back on that and laugh, that&#39;s when you&#39;ll know you&#39;re all grown up.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> And hey, if it pisses you off to think about them,<br> just curse them until you feel better.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Getting to send the dead off with a laugh is a privilege reserved for those who&#39;re still alive.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong><br> I see. So those are the principles with which you lead your life. Then I presume we have no more business in this time period?</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Nah. This was just a side venture. Can&#39;t line your pockets with knowledge alone, right? Our REAL destination&#39;s coming up next.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Hold on to your hats, &#39;cause this next place is something else! If all goes well, we&#39;ll be splitting enough treasure to make us all rich!</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> Treasure, you say!? If it&#39;s a treasure of yours,<br> old hag, it must be...one of your old corsets!</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> I can imagine its leather straps hugging your little tummy pooch even as we speak! Now that&#39;s a treasure I\u2013</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Nobody said anything about corsets!<br> This belt&#39;s more than enough for me!</p><p><strong>--ARROW--:</strong></p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Damn, this ship sure can fly. It would&#39;ve taken days to cross these waters back in my time.</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> Ooh, is that the Strait of Magellan I see off the starboard bow? Are we going to the Pacific?</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> &#39;Fraid we don&#39;t have any business there this time around.</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong><br> Hmm. In that case, our destination must be Cape Horn,<br> past the Drake Passage.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> You&#39;re pretty sharp, aren&#39;t you?<br> Yeah, that&#39;s our next destination.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> By the way, you feeling okay?<br> You look pale, and your knees are shaking.</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong><br> Indeed, I am feeling quite ill.<br> I never imagined I would be prone to seasickness.</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong><br> I shall have to think about ways to stabilize a ship&#39;s deck prior to my next voyage.</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong><br> No, wait. Perhaps I should invent a way for boats to glide across the water&#39;s surface.</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong><br> If I were to lay down electromagnetic rails in the air, so that it float across them like a hovercraft...</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong><br> No, wait. That would just be a hovertrain, not a boat...</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong><br> Hmm. Even with my wisdom guiding the myths of humanity, it seems the sea is still the domain of the old gods...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Even in modern times, most ships use diesel engines.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Though the number of electric and hybrid cars is growing, ocean travel is still pretty unstable.</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong><br> That would change if there were a more efficient way of generating electricity via combustion.</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong><br> Unfortunately, the only attempt at perpetual motion to ever succeed that I am aware of is the special Tesla coil I wear.</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> Speaking as a sailor, bringing electricity on board is all risk and no reward. I wish you&#39;d just get off the ship before you end up burning the mast down.</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> Not that any ship of mine or the old hag couldn&#39;t handle a little lightning strike, of course!</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> Anyway, is this Cape Horn place where you hid your legendary treasure or something?</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> Say, all those gold doubloons you stole from the Spanish that nobody ever found...?</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> You just can&#39;t stop being creepy, can you...<br> Must&#39;ve taken you a good while to figure that...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...Huh?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Then, this really IS a treasure hunt!?</p><hr><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> N-nah, nothing so grandiose.<br> I just happened to remember something is all.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Back then, I found a buncha jewels and talismans I didn&#39;t know what to make of, and I thought you might have a use for them.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Jewels and talismans... That sounds like they could be sources of magical energy! If that&#39;s true, we could absolutely use them!</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Right? I know Chaldea&#39;s always just barely making ends meet, so I&#39;m hoping this stuff can help out, even just a little.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> But don&#39;t get your hopes up too high.<br> We&#39;re basically just going back for something I forgot.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> There&#39;s just one little problem.<br> We&#39;re probably gonna run into you-know-what.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> You don&#39;t mean...the only thing you can&#39;t stand...?</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> That&#39;s the one. But this probably won&#39;t be as bad as back then. Especially since you can shoot it.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> But on the flip side, this one&#39;s even more dangerous.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Me, Fujimaru, and Mash alone won&#39;t be able to handle it.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> That&#39;s why I had Tesla here come along!<br> So he can help us fight storm with storm.</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong><br> ...I see. That explains this feeling I&#39;ve been having.<br> It seems I too have some connection to this \u201Cstorm.\u201D</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Look! Master, the sky...!<br> A storm just came out of nowhere...!</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> Here, Master!<br> Tie this rope around your waist, quickly!</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> ...There they are. I knew it.<br> These things always show up to get in my way.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Come to think of it, they got me good after I crossed the Strait of Magellan too.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I&#39;m seeing powerful magical energy signals headed your way! Are those Servants...?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> (No, they&#39;re too lacking in substance for that. They&#39;re more like shadows than anything... Maybe they&#39;re shadows cast by Drake herself...?)</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> (Whatever they are, they&#39;re drawn to her. The Wild Hunt was said to be the embodiment of a legendary storm...)</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> (Now that she&#39;s joined its ranks, does that mean she&#39;s destined to be swallowed up by a storm too...?)</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Ahh, there&#39;s nothing like a good storm to get your blood pumping. Now THIS is what an adventure oughta be!</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> It&#39;s not a real voyage if you&#39;re not risking your life! Let&#39;s do this, Teach!</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> The scientist&#39;ll handle the lightning for us.<br> Let&#39;s show these things what pirates are!</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> Ah!</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> Don&#39;t gotta tell me twice! A little storm like this is nothing compared to my lady troubles!</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> Just make sure you don&#39;t go screwing things up yourself, Drake!</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> Turn your back on me,<br> and I&#39;ll make sure you go down first!</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> That&#39;s the spirit! Go ahead and blast your cannons all you want! You couldn&#39;t hit me even if I was standing right in front of them!</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> All right, let&#39;s go, Fujimaru!</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Time to show these creeps who&#39;s boss and make our way on to Treasure Island!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Guess those things aren&#39;t all bad. With that storm and the currents, we got here faster than I expected.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...We made it to shore intact, Master. I&#39;m fairly sure the ship was flying again towards the end...</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong><br> So that is the Drake Passage off to the south.<br> I can see it&#39;s a complex maze of rough currents.</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong><br> No wonder it was considered impossible to cross with sixteenth-century nautical engineering.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Yeah. I just discovered it;<br> I didn&#39;t actually cross it.</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> Well that&#39;s a waste. Just imagine if you&#39;d made your way across it and arrived at Antarctica, old hag!</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> You could&#39;ve been a triple crown pioneer, conquering the world, the Spanish Armada, and Antarctica! You were so close!</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Huh, yeah, I guess that is kind of a waste.<br> Triple crown&#39;s got a nice ring to it!</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> But oh well. It&#39;s all academic now, anyway.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Besides, I&#39;m not like Magellan.<br> I never had any interest in a southern super continent.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> On a different note, Blackbeard, up for some hunting? Consider it your fare after stowing away on my ship.</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> You certainly are a slave driver, aren&#39;t you, old hag. Fine, how many do you want? Ten? A hundred?</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> One&#39;ll be plenty! Hell, just how big of an eater do you think I am, anyway? All I want&#39;s some raw meat. I haven&#39;t had any in a long time.</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> Here you are, everyone! Did you see me out there?<br> I was pretty wild, wasn&#39;t I?</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> I pulled out every trick I had since there&#39;s nothing but seals here, you know.</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> Do you eat seal, old hag?<br> Are you a liver kind of gal?</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Not bad, creep.<br> Now gimme that knife. I&#39;ll prep it myself.</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> What!? You mean you&#39;re not gonna go for it raw,<br> old hag!? And since when can you cook!?</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Shaddup! Of course I can cook! All you gotta do is skin it, gut it, and cook the meat!</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Keep whining, and I&#39;ll cook you too!<br> And I won&#39;t bother putting you down first, either!</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> That ain&#39;t cooking!<br> That&#39;s just torture!</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Thaaat&#39;s the stuff. Tastes just as bad as ever.<br> You guys wanna try a bite?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Th-thank you.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> It&#39;s not THAT bad... I mean, it&#39;s still edible.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Master&#39;s right.<br> This is still much better than military rations.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Glad to hear it. Does that mean you could have nothing but seal day in and day out?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That&#39;s... Well...</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> We got caught up in a hell of a storm after we crossed the Strait of Magellan. Took everything we had just to wash up here.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> The fleet I put back together at San Juli\xE1n got torn apart, until the only ship left was the Golden Hind.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Almost out of food, not a penny to our names...not that it&#39;d help since, y&#39;know, no markets nearby. So nothing but seal here for days just to survive.</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong><br> Nothing but this every day, huh? That would be downright torturous for a vegetarian like me.</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> I&#39;m a carnivore myself, but there&#39;s no stinking way I&#39;d ever eat seal to survive. I&#39;d just turn tail and run back home.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Don&#39;t be daft. You know damn well we&#39;re not the kind of pirates who turn tail and run home just because we had a little run-in with death.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Me, I found it exciting. I&#39;d never have had a chance to eat seal if I&#39;d lived a normal life.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> And my ship was still seaworthy, so it wasn&#39;t a complete loss, given my nautical skills.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Besides, if I&#39;d turned back now,<br> that idiot Thomas would&#39;ve died for nothing.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> So I decided to jump from the frying pan into the fire and make this place my crossroads.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> As a result, I ended up staying on this island for a long time. Enough to lay plenty of traps for whoever found it next.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Traps...? Then, does that mean you really did leave some treasure buried here, like Captain Teach said...?</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Sure. I hid it in a cave not too far from here.<br> What do you say we go get it after we finish this seal?</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> You guys&#39;ll get your precious magical energy, and I&#39;ll...</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> ...Well, for me, seal meat tastes like condemnation.<br> Sure puts a strong wind in my sails.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> After all, Chaldea&#39;s got a bunch of real tough Servants!</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> So I&#39;ve gotta shape up if I&#39;m gonna beat the other Riders!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> True, the other Riders are pretty tough...</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> That they are. I wonder why so many kings end up as Riders? There&#39;s the King of Conquerors, the King of Kings, the King of Maids...</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> ...Well, I don&#39;t know much about that last one, but the way things&#39;re going, it looks like it&#39;s only a matter of time until some real crazy king shows up.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> So I&#39;ve GOTTA light a fire under my ass if I&#39;m gonna be of any help to you.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Captain Drake&#39;ll always be leading them from the front.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Aww, really? I don&#39;t know what to say. I never did learn how to take a compliment... Damn, I think I&#39;m blushing.</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> Seriously!? Why don&#39;t you ever blush for me, you old hag!? I&#39;m ALWAYS giving you backhanded compliments!</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> &#39;Cause you&#39;re a liar, that&#39;s why. Try being honest &#39;bout your feelings for a change. Then drop dead.</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> (Shock)</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> But I wouldn&#39;t have you any other way, old hag! Nobody wants to see an older heroine go full tsundere!</p><hr><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> All right, that&#39;s enough chitchat.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Mash, Doc, we can bring back at least a few magical energy resources, right?</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> I&#39;ll let you guys handle the conversion. Just make sure you use &#39;em to help Fujimaru out.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> You bet we will! I can see a ton of magical energy on my monitor not too far from you!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Storing magical energy in jewels is a pretty common practice in the magecraft world.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> We&#39;ll definitely put them to good use.<br> Every little bit really does count.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Thanks, Captain.</p><hr><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> No problem. We&#39;re up against a helluva foe,<br> after all. You can never have too many weapons.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> ...You know, a lotta stuff went down on my voyage, but...</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> ...if it really did help the people who came after me, then that actually makes me feel like something of a proud hero.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> That my life wasn&#39;t just a bunch of idiotic hijinks.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> People used to say I kept getting swept up in storms &#39;cause I never learned my lesson.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> But thanks to that, I proved that I could look back on my miserable final moments and still smile.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Fujimaru, you&#39;ve already been thrown into a stormy sea headfirst.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> You can&#39;t run from it, you can&#39;t move forward in it, and it won&#39;t let you go no matter how hard you cry.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> The only thing you can do in times like that is hold your head high and smile. It might not always be easy, but if there&#39;s one thing you gotta take away from this little adventure, that&#39;s it.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> So I just have to smile?</p><hr><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> That&#39;s right. Long as you&#39;re still smiling,<br> everyone else&#39;ll be happy to help you.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> After all, smiling when times are tough is the best thing you can do to win someone&#39;s trust. No hero&#39;s gonna turn their back on a winning horse like that.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Isn&#39;t that right, Tesla?<br> I bet you&#39;ve got a winning smile up your sleeve too.</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong><br> I do indeed. Any true genius is always ready with a smile, whether they&#39;re in a tight spot or not.</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong><br> Though of course, a nihilistic smile would not suit you, young Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong><br> No, the smile that best suits you is more akin to the strength of a quiet spring day...or perhaps the charming elegance of a pigeon in the park.</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong><br> Naturally, I quite like that sort of intelligent smile myself.</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong><br> It couldn&#39;t be more different from the cacophonous laughter of a certain mangy plebeian I could name!</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> Yup, yup. Can&#39;t have a leader who&#39;s all gloomy and downcast.</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> The only people those kinds of leaders attract are bloodthirsty killers!</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> Me, I want to be surrounded by my own little harem, no matter what kind of battle we&#39;re fighting! My own smile&#39;s my greatest charm, after all!</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> Ahh, if only I could wake one day and find myself in an isekai with nothing but happy, innocent girls!</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Hahaha. Not that it needs to be said at this point,<br> but just ignore that idiot.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> I&#39;m proud to be on your crew, Master. Make sure you keep your head up high, no matter what sort of trouble comes your way.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> &#39;Cause we&#39;re all counting on you to keep us idiots in high spirits right to the very end.</p>', 514);
