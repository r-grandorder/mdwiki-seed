Ashigara</h2><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Bored. I&#39;m so bored I might just nod off to sleep.<br> Still, not that bad a night.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> City noise isn&#39;t bad, but the silence of the wilderness at night is something else altogether.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Specifically, it&#39;s like, uh, you know...healing or therapeutic or whatever you call it?</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Well, whatever, who cares.<br> Which do you prefer, Boss?</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> A woman of the night, or a woman of the wilderness?<br> A showy woman, or a reserved and quiet young lady?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> City nights.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> That&#39;s surprising. Guess I didn&#39;t read you right.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> But you know, I also like the cities of your era.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> If we&#39;re lucky enough to save the world, I&#39;ll take you to a good place. Not quite gold, but platinum.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> It&#39;s a favorite I found in a previous materialization. Nice place. Both the booze and the food were pretty good.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Nights in the wild.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> As expected! I had a feeling you did, buddy!<br> We really do see eye to eye on everything!</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> But, aren&#39;t you a city mouse? Your face says you clearly weren&#39;t raised in the mountains.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> I grew up in the mountains. You can say the forest was my garden. I used to run around all the time.</p><hr><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Anyway... That sky ring is such a nuisance.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> The stupid thing ruins the night scenery.<br> Really uncool.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes. We still don&#39;t know what the sky ring is.<br> It&#39;s an unexplained phenomenon.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Both the Doctor and Da Vinci have been attempting to analyze it, but\u2013</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou, fou...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> We can&#39;t figure it out. Not at all.<br> That guy said that it was a Noble Phantasm, but...</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou, foou, fou...</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> I don&#39;t like it. Geez, the moon and stars are all you need in a night sky.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> That thing&#39;s up there, lookin&#39; like the stars, the moon, and even the sun&#39;s getting in its way.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> I don&#39;t know who, but\u2013</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Well, this ain&#39;t the time for idle chatter.<br> Seems we got more insensitive dudes.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> They do say the moon goes good with a drink, but what? Even monsters want something with their booze?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Huh?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Is there something out there?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I don&#39;t sense anything</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> No magical energy readings detected.<br> It&#39;s just a quiet forest.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I don&#39;t think anyone&#39;s sensed us either.<br> I mean, I guess there&#39;re a few wild animals out there,</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> but I don&#39;t sense anything that would be a particular threat to\u2013</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> GAAAAAAAAA\u2013!!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Huh!? What!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Roaring of an unidentified creature confirmed from the southwest! It&#39;s outside of the magical energy detection radius, but...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> There&#39;s no doubt! It&#39;s the roaring of dragonkin!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I-I see. So that&#39;s why! The reason why you, the Heroic Spirit Sakata Kintoki, were out \u201Cstrolling\u201D tonight!</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> ...Tch. It&#39;s bigger than I thought.<br> And this job&#39;s a bigger pain in the ass now.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> The Second Singularity, was it?<br> I felt something roaring away in this era.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Man, it&#39;s gotta be\u2014bears.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Bears?</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> The only huge beasts that roar in the mountains are bears. These ones are particularly noisy!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I wouldn&#39;t call them bears! Well, I guess it does no harm to perceive them that way?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Dragonkin, the strongest Phantasmals.<br> In a way, they&#39;re at the top of the ecosystem...</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Leave it to me! Time for a bear-extermination party.<br> Boss. I&#39;ll lead you there!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> \u2013Multiple magical energy readings approaching at high speed! Judging from the speed and energy, most likely wyverns!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Perhaps they chain manifested due to the presence of the dragonkin. Unfortunately for us, there&#39;re a lot of them!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Drive the bears off!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Drive the wyverns off!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes, Master!<br> \u2013Preparing for battle!</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Remember to roll up your sleeves! It&#39;s not cool to get splattered with blood during battle!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> That was boring. I don&#39;t think I even worked off my last meal.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Ending battle.<br> ...All Phantasmals eliminated.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I don&#39;t think that was one of his skills, but Sakata Kintoki was just tearing those Phantasmals apart.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Stories say he&#39;s a hero that took a bear down as a child, so it makes sense that he&#39;s this strong as an adult.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Sakata Kintoki, are you hiding any Anti-Phantasmal skills?</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou, foou.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Huh?</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> What&#39;re you talking &#39;bout, Doctor?<br> I&#39;m the source of my own strength.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> I&#39;m a golden man, glittering like gold.<br> You need a different reason?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Uh, no, not really...</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> All right, we&#39;re good then.<br> Oh, and stop calling me by my full name.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Huh? Wh-Why is that?</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> U-Umm, just try to get it, would you?<br> ...I mean, \u201CKintoki.\u201D It&#39;s a pretty lame name.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> \u2013An enormous magical energy reading is approaching! It must have noticed us during the last battle.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I can see it from here too! No doubt about it, it&#39;s huge, a Fafnir-type dragonkin!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Judging from its speed, it seems to be flying.<br> Get ready for an attack!</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> This is so fun! I bet a flying bear is even stronger than a brown bear!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> How strong were brown bears in the Heian era!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Flying bears? Scary!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Only a few seconds left until encounter.<br> \u2013Senpai, orders please!</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> GAAAAAAAAA\u2013!!</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Oh, how bold! I&#39;m totally awake now.<br> I&#39;ll send you on a tour of hell as thanks!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Target defeated! Ending combat.<br> Disappearance of the large dragonkin confirmed!</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Master, that was a good workout before a late-night snack! Western brown bears aren&#39;t that bad!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> To be so calm against a dragonkin is really something... He must really be the child of a thunder god.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Or, perhaps in this case I should say, child of a red dragon? He&#39;s obviously not a run-of-the-mill Heroic Spirit\u2013</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> I&#39;m just me. Ugh, it&#39;s really too bad though.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> What is?</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> My class, you know. Why did they summon me as a Berserker?</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> If I materialized as a Rider, I coulda clashed midair with them on my \u201CGolden Bear.\u201D</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Huh, what&#39;s that!?<br> What&#39;s this Golden Bear?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Maybe a car?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Maybe a robot?</p><hr><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> You&#39;re close, Boss. Oh, so close!</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> You see, the Golden Bear can transform itself between car form\u2013</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> \u2013and bear form.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Wh-What! I want to see that! I really do! Doesn&#39;t a transforming Noble Phantasm sound amazing!?</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou, fou, foou!!</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Oh, even the blue squirrel here gets it. If I had the Bear, even Nikola Tesla would beg me in tears...</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> \u201CI want that too!\u201D he&#39;d say, and I&#39;d make him get mad like a sorry little brat.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Even Fou is quite excited...<br> Senpai\u2013</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I wanna see it! I totally wanna see it!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Transfoorm!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...also seems very happy.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Well, I&#39;m sure there&#39;ll be a chance to show you all someday. Anyway, let&#39;s hurry on home and have a drink!</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> A celebration for driving off the bears!<br> Doctor, get your best booze ready for us!</p><h2 id="kintoki-s-oni-slaying-at-mt-ooe" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#kintoki-s-oni-slaying-at-mt-ooe" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Kintoki&#39;s Oni Slaying at Mt.

It&#39;ll be a breeze.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I don&#39;t mind. Let&#39;s go!</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Alright! That&#39;s my Boss! You get me!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Okay, but where&#39;re we going, and what&#39;re we doing?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> You&#39;re going to Rayshift instead of using the training simulator, correct? What for?</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> You&#39;ll see soon. Mash, come on, let&#39;s do a cool golden shift!</p><hr><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Here&#39;s the specific coordinates.

A short-term Rayshift may be possible if it&#39;s not for a Holy Grail investigation... But...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> But I&#39;ve taken all possible measures to prepare for this. You&#39;re going to THAT era, after all.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Da Vinci! Oh, so you know already.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Yup. Kintoki came to talk to me about it last night. He seemed to have really given this some thought, which is not at all like him.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> I ain&#39;t thinkin&#39; too much about it. I just got feverish for half a day mullin&#39; over it, that&#39;s all!</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Y&#39;all hate long explanations, right?<br> So I just cut to the chase. Got a problem with that!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> No. But if you can at least tell us your reasoning...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Is this really serious...?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Where exactly are we going?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Oh right, Senpai. We are Rayshifting to the B.C. era.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> There ya have it! And I told ya it was for a cleanup job.

Let&#39;s go!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Family to Kintoki is family to Chaldea!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Right, Senpai. Understood. Rayshifting to the B.C. era, before the end of the battle at the Demonic Front!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Sorry Mash, I need your help on my end. Like I said before, I&#39;ll have to do all I can to prove Fujimaru&#39;s existence.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Y-yes.

And it looks quite steep.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> Thankfully, there is a path. Whether climbing up a mountain or going down one, the presence of a path is of the utmost importance.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> This place looks familiar.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> This looks like the sacred mountain even the gods feared...</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That&#39;s right, Senpai. You&#39;ve been there before. That&#39;s Mt. Ebih, the sacred mountain tied to Ishtar&#39;s myth.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Last time we, um...fought against some aesthetically disastrous\u2013I mean, very strong demonic statues there.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Well, looks like they ain&#39;t around.<br> And if they are, we&#39;ll just haveta take care of &#39;em!</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> Please proceed with caution, Lord Kintoki. Those particular statues&#39; kicks were beyond powerful...</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> They were more destructive than a low-tier Servant&#39;s Noble Phantasm. They were certainly dangerous.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Well, yeah. Either way, if they do show up, it&#39;s not like we&#39;ll be able to just tiptoe arou\u2014</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Hm? Wait a moment. Those statues over there...<br> Are they the ones you fought?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> They weren&#39;t Spriggan types, no.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> They were more erm...unique.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...She should be a goddess who governs beauty, so why were they so hideous?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Unless the sense of beauty in the Age of Gods was very different than what we&#39;re used to...</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou, fooou.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Hm?</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Are looks that important? Don&#39;t bother me much.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> Are you speaking only about how a demonic statue looks? Or...</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Demonic statues, humans, tsuchigumo, it doesn&#39;t matter. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Regardless of outward appearance, there&#39;s good, and then there&#39;s evil.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Strong folks&#39;re strong, and weak ones are weak.<br> Some folks joke around, and some are serious.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> ...There are even some who are beautiful, but scary at the same time.</p><p><strong>G\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Oh, my. There&#39;s no need to speak so harshly.</p><p><strong>G\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Why say such a thing when they&#39;re so adorably sweet. Don&#39;t you agree, heehee? This goddess of Sumer has wonderful taste.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> ...That voice!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I-I&#39;m sorry, she told me to keep my mouth shut!<br> One more Servant Rayshifted with you!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> But I didn&#39;t expect... No, she is approaching along with what looks like several hostile responses!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Shuten-Douji! You said you wanted to help Senpai!</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> Heehee. Mash, don&#39;t be so harsh with me.<br> I didn&#39;t do this maliciously.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> Three giant demonic statues incoming!<br> And on one of their shoulders...that&#39;s...Shuten-Douji...!</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> I saw these cuties lying around, so I gave them a sip of my wine.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> I did nothing wrong. I didn&#39;t turn it to poison like when I release my True Name. It&#39;s just wine.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> All I did was offer it to them.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> Heehee, they&#39;re so energetic. Look.<br> Their arms, legs, and bodies are all so puffed up.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> If they&#39;re connected to the gods, see, it&#39;s only logical for them to spring to life or grow stronger.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> It&#39;s the Divine Wine... The Shinpen Kidoku!<br> That&#39;s the oni&#39;s godly poison!</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> B-but according to legend, it&#39;s only supposed to strengthen humans! I&#39;ve never heard of any godly beings getting stronger...!</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Zip it, boy. All we gotta do is smash &#39;em to pieces.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> I don&#39;t care how pretty their faces are or how beautiful their skin is. I got business at the end of that mountain trail!</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> They&#39;ll be a good warm-up! Yo, Boss! We only just Rayshifted, and already we got a golden battle on our hands!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Ready to battle!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Golden battle... Begin!</p><hr><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Let&#39;s do this!!!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> Oh, my. But those were three godly oni\u2014</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> How disappointing. Heehee. I see you are strong as ever, golden-haired, blue-eyed brat.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> ...Shut up. The hell&#39;re you doin&#39; here, anyway?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Wait, Kintoki! Shuten-Douji really does want to help you and Master out!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> She voluntarily Rayshifted. She said she wanted to head out quickly, even if it could be dangerous.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Even for a tough Servant like her, a hastened Rayshift makes it very hard to maintain her existence.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Even then, she\u2014</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> That ain&#39;t somethin&#39; praiseworthy. That thing there&#39;s an oni. No matter how human she acts, she ain&#39;t.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> Oh, how could you be so cruel? You shouldn&#39;t say such a thing just because of how I look.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Ain&#39;t your looks. Not one bit.<br> I&#39;m sayin&#39; it based on what&#39;s underneath.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> ...Heehee, like he&#39;s checking out my underthings...</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> So, what? Want to keep at it until we die?<br> I&#39;m game, brat.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> Lord Kintoki. Unnecessary combat...</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> I know. She may be an oni, but she&#39;s still Boss&#39;s Servant. Besides, I&#39;m not the leader of this marching troupe.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Boss, I&#39;m leaving the decision to you. I&#39;ll play along.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Let&#39;s take Shuten-Douji with us.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> All right. Can&#39;t complain if Boss says so. Let&#39;s get goin&#39;.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I have a feeling Shuten-Douji&#39;s going to come in handy soon...</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> ...You serious, Boss?<br> That thing there&#39;s quite a headache.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Actually, I had the same hunch... I guess...<br> Well, at least I ain&#39;t the only one, then.</p><hr><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> What, what? Quit your whispering!</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> Let me in! Me too, me too! Right, Master?</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Too close! Don&#39;t you get near me...or Boss!</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> Heehee. Oh, come on. What a wicked thing to say.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> ... (Gasp!) My mother&#39;s intuition is telling me something bad will happen!</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Something that will sadden this mother, something shameful and wanton... Somewhere...</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Could another pest...be bothering Master or Kintoki...?</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong><br> Yes, yes, snap out of it.<br> Pay attention when you&#39;re holding a knife.</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong><br> You were the one who wanted to learn how to cook dishes from various countries and eras. You need to concentrate.</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong><br> Got it? Right now, we&#39;re the teachers, and you&#39;re the student.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Y-yes. My apologies, teacher. What was I thinking...?</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> Ready? Then let&#39;s move on to the next step.<br> Though I have to admit, your knife skills are impressive.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> It&#39;s something of a unique technique, but in the end things are cut properly, so I really shouldn&#39;t criticize.</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong><br> No, no. We should be warning her about that, don&#39;t you think?</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong><br> Slicing ingredients by throwing them into the air is...you know...probably not ideal.</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong><br> Yeah... That&#39;s no good. Let&#39;s start over, with the basics.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> Right. Then let&#39;s begin with the proper handling of a knife.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> ...Yes, I have a bad feeling about this.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Foufou, fou. Kyuuu.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> I don&#39;t want to think about what&#39;s awaiting us when we return to Chaldea... No, no, it&#39;s just a wild hunch...</p><p><strong>--ARROW--:</strong></p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> Look at this. It&#39;s like a harem of my very own.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> I have a golden-haired, blue-eyed brat to my right. I have Master on my left. Ready to take me from behind, a red-eyed boy.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> I have good wine. All I need is a moon in the sky above, watching over it all...</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> I can&#39;t ask for anything more. Heehee, what do you think? Why not spend a night with me like this?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> From behind...?</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> You know, take me out. The red-eyed boy may look innocent, but in truth he is a savage.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> He has a kunai ready to slip between my ribs if I do anything silly.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> Or maybe he has a thing for me? Yours may be a bit diluted, but we are still of the same blood. Let&#39;s be friendly.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> N-no. I was simply admiring...<br> (She&#39;s not wrong about me watching her, though...)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Nonononono.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> That&#39;s my Boss! Hit her where it hurts!<br> Tell her you ain&#39;t listening to her hogwash!</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> Oh, you two meanies are no fun.<br> Well then, how about you? Kotarou, was it?</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> Why not relax a bit? You are all so busy all the time.<br> It wouldn&#39;t kill you to take it easy once in a while.</p><hr><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> No. Staying here too long would be dangerous. We must do what we came here to do, and return immediately.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> That&#39;s a sound argument. Now, floor it.<br> We&#39;re almost at the summit.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou, fooou!</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Yeah, you&#39;re right. A long stay&#39;s a no-go since it&#39;s a short-term Rayshift.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> We just came here to get some cleanup done.<br> Nothing more, nothing less. Let&#39;s get this over with.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> From what I heard, the history of the Singularity after the Grail gets retrieved is different.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes. The irregularities that occur in a Singularity do not get properly recorded into human history.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> However, based on what King Gilgamesh said, they don&#39;t get entirely undone, either...</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Right. It doesn&#39;t completely go away.<br> It&#39;s not like tears and screams can just be erased.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Besides. If bad things are left behind, they might have an effect on the periods that come after.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> That&#39;s what this cleanup is about. Just a little finishing touch on the Demonic Front. We gotta put a stop to the misdeeds of any family members who might be affiliated with us!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Affiliated with us? That means...</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> Oh. How very odd.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> ...Got a problem with that?</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> No. I&#39;m not sure what, but something in my chest... See, hold out your hand. Right or left side, doesn&#39;t matter. See?</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Huh!?</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> Cop a feel of my chest.<br> Oh, Master. Master. I want Master to do it. See?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I mean, if it&#39;s for the mission...</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Boss, she&#39;ll eat you up. You better stop.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Hard pass.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> That&#39;s the right answer. She&#39;ll eat you right up if you just grope at her.</p><hr><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> Oh don&#39;t say that! I wouldn&#39;t just eat Master! Probably. Maybe.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> Wh-what do you mean maybe!?</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> What the brat said just triggered me. I didn&#39;t know he thought about me that way, and so I...</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> And so it made me a bit peckish and eating a human or two would be just the thing. My bad.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> I was serious, but not serious.<br> Heehee. I&#39;m sure Master won&#39;t understand.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> Please don&#39;t just eat us on a whim! Shuten-Douji is exactly what I had heard... Truly wicked, even for an oni!</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> That&#39;s right. She&#39;s an oni. Ain&#39;t no two ways about it, she&#39;s nothin&#39; like a human.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Oni live as oni. They kill as oni. They live their lives however they want and don&#39;t change for anyone.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> They ain&#39;t just mere beasts. They got some things in common with humans, but you better believe they ain&#39;t human!</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> That&#39;s probably why things turned out the way they did here. They don&#39;t give a rip what happens to human history.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> Teehee. You understand us well.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> How strange. The brat should be human, but...</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> He understands us so well. More than a certain someone who would do just about anything for the promise of chocolate.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> You sure know what we&#39;re all about.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> You guys weren&#39;t exactly subtle, either. Even if it&#39;s something you like, you destroy it. Kill. Backstab.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Enemy signals up ahead! I detect multiple large magical energy responses, Senpai!</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> ...They&#39;ve finally made their appearance.<br> Boss, let&#39;s have at &#39;em!</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> ...?</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> ...Who goes there?</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> This mountain is mine. You don&#39;t seem to know what happens to those who trespass.</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> I shall shred your bodies and devour your flesh. I shall gnaw at those bones of yours and toss them away!</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> I am this mountain&#39;s master.<br> I am also the leader of the very first group of bandits!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Banana!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Don&#39;t tell me you&#39;re still here from Gilgamesh&#39;s summoning...</p><hr><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> She&#39;s...! Ibaraki-Douji, one of the seven Servants summoned by King Gilgamesh!</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> According to Chaldea&#39;s records about the Seventh Singularity, her whereabouts were unknown. But who would have thought...!</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Oh, it&#39;s you. You&#39;re that nasty king&#39;s friend!</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> No, wait. Aren&#39;t you the red-eyed boy?<br> Did you finally decide to work for me?</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Haha, I knew it! You finally realized that I am a much better master to serve than that stupid king!</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Tomoe was terrifying, but you&#39;re acceptable! As a foreign oni, let&#39;s rain terror on this kingdom together!</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> ...Um, I hate to say this, but this is the first time we&#39;ve met. The \u201Cme\u201D that you&#39;re talking about is different than \u201Cme.\u201D</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> What? Hmmmm, now that you mention it, you smell different. Are you a ghost or something?</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> No matter. I&#39;ll say it again: I won&#39;t obey anyone!</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> I&#39;m an oni, the master of this mountain!<br> Tell your king that the king of oni rules here!</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Uruk&#39;s king is not around anymore. He completed his task and died. He pulled back at the right time.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> As for you... Well, I know you don&#39;t care about human history.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> I bet you didn&#39;t form any bonds with the King of Heroes, so you don&#39;t feel any obligation to anyone.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Which means you just have to live on as an oni.<br> And while that may work for you...</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Quit roosting on someone else&#39;s mountain! You&#39;re the oni of Mt. Ooe! Master of the ten raging flames!</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Wh-what!? Why do you talk like you know me?</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> You may not know, but we know, you idiot!</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> Now, now, she&#39;s still being true to who she is, so don&#39;t blame her.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> Right, Ibaraki? Is being on a different mountain really that fun?</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> That form, that voice... Could it be Shuten? Shuten-Douji!? Wh-why are you here?</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Is this an illusion? A dream? No, no. Looking closer, the big brawny guy looks familiar...</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> He looks like he has some colored plates over his eyes, but that golden hair and those thick arms that&#39;re too big for any human... YOU!</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> SAKATA KINTOKI!?</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Damn straight!!!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Oh right, like Ushiwakamaru, Benkei, and Leonidas...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> She doesn&#39;t have any memories of Chaldea!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes, so it seems. How the Servants retain their memories in the Singularity...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...is something the staff is looking into, but it seems like she has absolutely no memory of Chaldea!</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Ain&#39;t no thing! A chance encounter is a sign of divine approval!</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> We can&#39;t just let a familiar face causin&#39; trouble slide!<br> We gotta do somethin&#39; about it!</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> ...Wh-what!?</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> You&#39;re just tryin&#39; to live your life. Not your fault, really.<br> I wonder what I would&#39;ve done in your shoes.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> But it ain&#39;t right for you to stay here forever!</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Just think of human history as the surface of a pond. You bein&#39; here&#39;s like someone tossin&#39; a pebble in.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Y&#39;know what happens on impact? Makes a splash, and every droplet in that splash represents a different person.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Can&#39;t really know what&#39;ll happen, to be honest. There may be people who will cry, or some might laugh.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> But even so...</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> There&#39;s a possibility that someone who shouldn&#39;t&#39;ve gotten hurt will get hurt.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> ...No. Not just a possibility. People WILL get hurt. Then they&#39;ll scream. That&#39;s right. Someone definitely screamed. They wanted my help.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> I heard it. I don&#39;t know how or why, but I heard a cry for help.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> So... Sorry, Ibaraki-Douji. I&#39;ve got no choice but to boot your ass back to the Throne of Heroes.</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> I don&#39;t understand! Not at all! Not one bit!<br> What are you even talking about!?</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> You heard a voice? What? I don&#39;t hear anything at all!</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> But yeah... One thing&#39;s clear. Sakata Kintoki. As long as I make a great show of killing you right here...</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> ...Shuten over there will snap out of it.<br> Good, good, that&#39;s good!</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> ...I have to thank you, Kintoki!<br> You brought my friend right to me!</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> I shall slaughter you all, and create a new Mt. Ooe with Shuten!</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> Ibaraki-Douji is approaching!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Senpai, please be careful!<br> Ibaraki-Douji is not the only one there!</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Hah! Demonic Beasts from the Age of Gods, I see! They&#39;re formidable opponents! Let&#39;s do this!</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Behold my golden broadaxe shining in the distance! Watch as it suppresses celestial demons and strikes down yasha!</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> I&#39;m goin&#39; golden full throttle! This is gonna be Sakata Kintoki&#39;s great oni extermination!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Defeat of the enemy Servant has been confirmed! Senpai, you won!</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Why... Why? Why must I disappear...?</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> I didn&#39;t do anything wrong... I didn&#39;t even eat any of the humans who fled here from Uruk or whatever it was...</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> They didn&#39;t think they&#39;d survive there...<br> All I did was make them my minions for a while...</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> I was just...living my life... That&#39;s all...</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> With the weaklings... With those unknown deformed beasts... Together... That&#39;s all...</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> ...Oh, but... Yeah, that&#39;s right.</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> For the longest time, it wasn&#39;t enough for me... It didn&#39;t matter that there were humans around or that those conniving beasts would slink over.</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> There&#39;s nobody here. Do you understand?<br> No one who knows me, or who talks to me...</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> It wasn&#39;t long before the humans left. Said they were gonna check on Uruk\u2013excuses like that\u2013and just up and left.</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> None of them ever came back. I&#39;m sure they died.</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> The deformed beasts are getting weaker by the day.<br> Had they not been killed, they would&#39;ve died out soon...</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> ...They were all trembling with fear. They just treated me like a bonfire to huddle around for warmth.</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> But really, I was trembling just like them.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Shuten... Kintoki...</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> I... I...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> Hmmm? Say it, Ibaraki.</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Shuten... Oh, you&#39;re right there. Shuten-Douji...</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Atop this unfamiliar mountain, all by myself... I was...</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> ...I was so lonely...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Confirmed disappearance of Ibaraki-Douji.<br> Same with the demons.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> ...Lord Kintoki.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Yep. That&#39;ll do it. Sorry I roped you into my family problems.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> Oh, no need to apologize!<br> I didn&#39;t... Please don&#39;t worry about it.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> You and Master made the right choice, Lord Kintoki.<br> If you hadn&#39;t intervened, the incarnated Ibaraki-Douji would likely have affected history.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> Right. You had no choice. And if you were killed during this deadly battle, that would be the end of that.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> Besides... Heehee...teehee hee...</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> I&#39;ve never seen the brat be so... Heehee... Oh, too funny! This is too much, I just don&#39;t know what to do with myself!</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> ...The hell?</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> That&#39;s the second time you&#39;ve called us \u201Cfamily.\u201D I wonder what I should tell Ibaraki once we get back to Chaldea.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Oh, yeah...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> He did say that.</p><hr><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> !!!</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Well, that... Don&#39;t you dare! That&#39;s not golden at all!</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> Oh that is absolutely not my problem. This has been such a treat. Mash, hurry and take us back.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Uh, okay. All right everyone, the temporary Rayshift ends here. Commencing return Rayshift from the Seventh Singularity!</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> ...What? I have no business with you lot. Scram.</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> I need to meet up with Nitocris.<br> Move it or die. And die, Sakata Kintoki.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Shut up. Maybe you don&#39;t got business with us, but we got business with you!</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Oh???</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> You see... Um...</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> What? Use your words.<br> You&#39;re not just teasing me, are you?</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Uh, well you see... Yeah... Just wanted to say sorry. I was trying to tell myself it&#39;s okay but it just didn&#39;t seem right to me.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> I know it&#39;s pointless telling you this, but I won&#39;t be satisfied if I don&#39;t!</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> So... Sorry again. Sorry on a buncha levels.</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Fool! You&#39;re making no sense!</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> ...Yeah, guess not. At least take this.<br> Here.</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> A pouch? What&#39;s this? Something&#39;s inside...</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> (Rustle rustle)</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> ...What!? Could it be...!?</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> You like chocolates, right? I put in a buncha different kinds. Ain&#39;t exactly an apology gift or nothin&#39;, but...</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> At least I wrapped it in golden wrapping paper.<br> Well, if you like it, have at it. See ya.</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Don&#39;t you dare come say you want it back!<br> (Munch) (Nom nom)</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Like hell I&#39;d say that!</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Wh-wha-wha-what...!? What is going on? Why is my dear, sweet Kintoki giving that pest a present!?</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> This...this is not acceptable! I didn&#39;t raise him right!<br> I must act! I have no other choice but to assail\u2014<br> Hmmmf!? (Munch)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Calm down, Mother.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> He had his reasons.</p><hr><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Master, but...! No! They say that one mustn&#39;t get too attached!</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> Heehee. Oh? Are we no more than household pets to you? That may be, but do try not to be so silly.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> But still... Whether that brat treats us like someone&#39;s child, or a dog or cat...</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> He does have a few human qualities left to him...</p>', 468);
