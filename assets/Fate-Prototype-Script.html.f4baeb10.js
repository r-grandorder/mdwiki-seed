In the story, it was equivalent to the last stage.)</em></p><p>The downtown subway at midnight. A platform without a single person present. Saber and Archer were separated into the top and bottom platforms, both dressed in ordinary clothing. The subway tunnel that was devoid of signs of people seems just like a shrine.</p><p>In order to heal Ayaka, Saber had already searched for Berserker\u2019s Master for an entire day. His expression was both exhausted and anxious.</p><p>And now, Saber perceived another Servant\u2019s presence. He moved towards the subway platform knowing the enemy was challenging him, and waiting for him there with an audacious grin on his face was Archer, the powerful opponent who had crossed blades with him twice already.</p><p><strong>ARCHER:</strong></p><p>\u3164Long time no see, holy knight. It\u2019s already been seven days since we last met, hasn\u2019t it?</p><p>\u3164What\u2019s wrong, you seem quite downcast. Smile a bit. Since you\u2019ve already met me, smile brilliantly for me. The goddess of victory will only smile upon those who enjoy even the worst situations, right?</p><p>\u3164That\u2019s right\u2026 even if one\u2019s own Master has only a day of life remaining, one should smile at being my opponent. If not, they deserve to be trampled on.</p><p>Archer was calm. Saber had been silently facing him.</p><p><strong>ARCHER:</strong></p><p>\u3164How dull. I even thought that you were a warm, genial person. Isn\u2019t that such a waste of your handsome face, Saber?</p><p><strong>SABER:</strong></p><p>\u3164\u2026If I\u2019m a waste, then so are you.</p><p>\u3164You shouldn&#39;t blather on so. One can only be so undignified.</p><p>In response to Saber\u2019s sarcastic remark, Archer let out a joyful smile.</p><p><strong>ARCHER:</strong></p><p>\u3164Don\u2019t say that. I have always thought that blathering and squandering money on pointless things is a bad habit. But perhaps you should not make light of these bad habits?</p><p>Archer drew out a mysterious glass bottle.</p><p><strong>ARCHER:</strong></p><p>\u3164There are many such pointless things in my treasury. While I don&#39;t know what the poisons hurting Ayaka actually are, I also have this medicine that can cure any poison in the world.</p><p>A dark light surged from Saber\u2019s pupils.</p><p>Archer directed a crafty smile to Saber, who was staring at him.</p><p><strong>ARCHER:</strong></p><p>\u3164My Master is really a boring man. He said to just let Saber perish on his own. To let the Master die from the poison, but\u2026</p><p>\u3164How hopeless. He\u2019s the type of person who is careful to the end, a coward, and will helplessly miss a good show. Victory is so important.</p><p>\u3164However, sometimes a disgustingly formidable opponent is more precious than gold. To want to kill the other person from the bottom of one\u2019s heart, you can only experience that once in your life. Don\u2019t you think so, Saber?</p><p>The two sank into silence.</p><p><strong>SABER:</strong></p><p>\u3164\u2026So?</p><p><strong>ARCHER:</strong></p><p>\u3164Come and get it if you want it.</p><p>Archer arrogantly provoked him. The atmosphere was tense.</p><p>A subway car passes. After it had passed, the two have armed themselves.</p><p>Archer tossed the glass bottle to Saber.</p><p>The glass bottle danced in the air in between the platforms, above the tracks.</p><p>Saber ran quickly to grab the bottle, and Archer wore a fierce smile, like he was waiting for an opportunity to jump and behead Saber.</p><p>The two figures crossed. The battle had begun.</p><hr><h3 id="s01-the-night-before-fate-early-morning-ayaka" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#s01-the-night-before-fate-early-morning-ayaka" aria-hidden="true">#</a> S01/The night before Fate. Early Morning: Ayaka</h3><p><strong>AYAKA</strong> <em><strong>(Monologue, shortened to</strong></em> <strong>M</strong> <em><strong>henceforth):</strong></em></p><p>\u3164My countdown to death has finally reached zero.</p><p>The protagonist, Ayaka, woke up to the morning light in her bedroom.</p><p>Lazily, Ayaka opened her eyes, put on her glasses, and got up with a resigned expression on her face. The camera shifted to the calendar hanging on the wall. Every single day was marked, and an ominous and lethal \u2018cross\u2019 was placed over today\u2019s date.</p><p>Ayaka walked towards the dining table and had her breakfast alone. Three chairs were placed around the table, the two empty ones for her father and elder sister.</p><p><strong>AYAKA</strong> <strong>(M):</strong></p><p>\u3164An ordinary day starts again.</p><p>\u3164Today, the city is still at peace, and my life is calm.</p><p>\u3164This is an \u2018ordinary day\u2019 that I had already taken for granted. This is an ordinary life that I could not have imagined while Father had lived. If someone were to ask whether I am happy or not, living this life, then I would definitely say that I am very happy.</p><p>As she continued this monologue, she finished her breakfast, left her house, and headed for the garden.</p><p>The garden was full of catalysts for her Witch Craft. Herbs and magecraft plants were nourished here, together with a large number of pigeons used for sacrifices and crows to be used as familiars.</p><p>Emotionlessly, Ayaka proceeded with the magecraft ritual in front of an aged podium.</p><p>Ayaka did not have any goals or dreams herself. The ritual that Ayaka had continued when her father still lived, because she was unable to refuse him, had already become a habit.</p><p>Ayaka easily took out a pigeon that was bred in the garden. The pigeon looked at Ayaka with its round eyes while cooing at her.</p><p>Taking in a breath, Ayaka lifted the knife. The fluttering of birds\u2019 wings could be heard.</p><p>The camera darkens. Fresh blood.</p><hr><h3 id="s02-before-the-grave" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#s02-before-the-grave" aria-hidden="true">#</a> S02/Before the grave</h3><p>A school scene. Ayaka, who was going to school alone, looked depressed.</p><p><strong>AYAKA</strong> <strong>(M):</strong></p><p>\u3164Though it is my own assessment, I still feel my personality to be the worst.</p><p>\u3164I\u2019m pessimistic, a coward, narrow-minded, and likes to have empty boasts.</p><p>\u3164More importantly\u2026</p><p>A close up to Ayaka\u2019s left ring finger revealed bandages.</p><p>The scene returned to the garden 20 minutes ago. The uplifted knife. The pigeon tilting its head. And how the swung knife just happened to land next to the pigeon.</p><p>Due to her past trauma, Ayaka cannot kill living things.</p><p>(She could thus only use basic ingredients when cooking).</p><p>Therefore, more and more pigeons accumulated in the Sajou house.</p><p><strong>AYAKA</strong> <strong>(M):</strong></p><p>\u3164I\u2019m ordinary, so mundane that it cannot be salvaged.</p><p>\u3164I failed to obey Father\u2019s words even this morning, and couldn\u2019t help but use my own blood instead for the ritual.</p><p>\u3164After all, I never liked magecraft anyways.</p><p>The scene shifted to after school.</p><p>Ayaka\u2019s few friends were conversing with Ayaka.</p><p><strong>AYAKA:</strong></p><p>\u3164Sorry. I\u2019ve got something to take care of today.</p><p><strong>FRIEND (RIDER):</strong></p><p>\u3164Huh? Sajou-san, I don\u2019t remember you being in any extracurriculum groups.</p><p><strong>AYAKA:</strong></p><p>\u3164I\u2019m going to the graveyard. It\u2019s the anniversary of my father and elder sister\u2019s passing.</p><p>Ayaka took the train to the next town and walked to the foreigner\u2019s graveyard next to the church.</p><p>Ayaka stood before her father\u2019s grave. Anger\u2026 was hidden behind her ice cold expression as she laid a wreath upon her father\u2019s grave.</p><p>Turning around, she made to leave, only to discover an unfamiliar foreigner standing there.</p><p>He was Sancraid Phahn.</p><p><strong>SANCRAID:</strong></p><p>\u3164Hello, Sajou-san.</p><p>The foreigner called out Ayaka\u2019s name straight away.</p><p><strong>AYAKA:</strong></p><p>\u3164May I ask who you are? I don\u2019t know any foreigners.</p><p><strong>SANCRAID:</strong></p><p>\u3164I don\u2019t know anyone Japanese either. However, I hope we can get on well from now on. I really really hope that. I wish we can get along as seamlessly as two pieces of cloth sewn together.</p><p>\u3164Because your family are the only magi who had touched \u2018that\u2019.</p><p>Ayaka paled.</p><p><strong>SANCRAID:</strong></p><p>\u3164What happened to your father was truly a pity. He was so close to the truth. In the last war, your family kept winning until the end\u2026</p><p><strong>AYAKA:</strong></p><p>\u3164Go away.</p><p>Even though she was overwhelmed by the priest\u2019s presence, she still glared at him.</p><p>Sancraid only smiled.</p><p><strong>SANCRAID:</strong></p><p>\u3164Why aren&#39;t you making preparations? It was eight years ago to this day. It can finally start again. Everyone else is already summoning them.</p><p><strong>AYAKA:</strong></p><p>\u3164Leave me alone. That has nothing to do with me.</p><p><strong>SANCRAID:</strong></p><p>\u3164That is sad. Because, as long as you are alive, everything has something to do with you. If you want to cut that connection, the only thing to do is die.</p><p>Ayaka moved back. Sancraid only looked on with a smile.</p><p><strong>AYAKA:</strong></p><p>\u3164Don\u2019t come near me. I don\u2019t want anything to do with the Holy Grail.</p><p>Ayaka had left.</p><p>The priest muttered his advice as he looked at her retreating figure.</p><p><strong>SANCRAID:</strong></p><p>\u3164Tonight is the time. Please make your preparations before then.</p><p>\u3164Everyone would seek you out after midnight. None will leave you alone; no one will leave the daughter of the Sajou family, who had in truth won the last war, alone. That\u2019s because\u2026</p><p>Ayaka fled, almost running away.</p><p>The ends of the priest\u2019s mouth curved slightly upward in the lifeless graveyard.</p><p><strong>SANCRAID:</strong></p><p>\u3164\u2026Because the toughest opponent should be eliminated as soon as possible, right?</p><hr><h3 id="s03-lancer-s-attack" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#s03-lancer-s-attack" aria-hidden="true">#</a> S03/Lancer&#39;s Attack</h3><p>After the sunset, night. Ayaka fled home as fast as she could.</p><p><strong>AYAKA:</strong></p><p>\u3164Nothing, this has nothing to do with me!</p><p>She seemed to be calm, but the appearance of Sancraid made her half insane.</p><p>Ayaka collected the items she could use to protect herself (a feathered finger ring of witchcraft), locked the door, turned off the light, and hid herself in a robe of invisibility. She curled into a corner of the room, trembling.</p><p><strong>AYAKA:</strong></p><p>\u3164I am not the likes of them! Furthermore, to me\u2026</p><p>Wrapping herself in the invisibility robe, Ayaka repeated her delirious words like a frightened child.</p><p>Insert the memories of the past. The final night eight years ago.</p><p><em>(* Because Ayaka was just a child then, the memories were full of holes<br> and lacking consistency.)</em></p><p>Only a flashback of that tragic scene.</p><p>The corpses of many girls.</p><p>Her father, covered in blood. Her older sister, covered in blood.</p><p>The sword thrust from the back of her sister, Excalibur.</p><p>Her sister\u2019s face asked why. Her father died with a face painted in insanity.</p><p>Blood, a lot of blood, pouring onto young Ayaka\u2019s face.</p><p><strong>AYAKA:</strong></p><p>\u3164I absolutely can\u2019t do such a thing! It\u2019s impossible!</p><p>\u3164I can\u2019t be like my sister\u2026!</p><p>Returned to reality, Ayaka stared at the clock. Without her noticing, it was already 11 o\u2019clock at night. A new day was about to begin.</p><p><strong>SANCRAID</strong> <strong>(NARRATING):</strong></p><p>\u3164After today, it shall begin.</p><p>As if to swallow the words of the ominous priest, Ayaka gulped.</p><p>The grandfather clock in the living room stroke twelve o\u2019clock.</p><p>Dong. Dong. The sound of the clock.</p><p>Ayaka was startled, but there was nothing but silence.</p><p><strong>AYAKA:</strong></p><p>\u3164It seems\u2026 nothing is going to happen now.</p><p>\u3164\u2018Eight years from now\u2019, maybe I misunderstood my sister&#39;s words.</p><p>\u3164Thinking it\u2019s my turn next, I am overanalysing this\u2026</p><p>Just as Ayaka breathed a sigh of relief, distant dog barks reached the living room.</p><p><strong>AYAKA:</strong></p><p>\u3164Barking\u2026?</p><p>Ayaka lifted her head, thinking what is happening. Looking through the window, she saw the invading Lancer leading a large pack of hounds.</p><p><strong>AYAKA:</strong></p><p>\u3164This form of magical energy\u2026 Servant!</p><p>Ayaka leaped back from the window.</p><p>The hounds assaulted the Sajou residence.</p><p>The sorceries placed onto the residence for intercepting intruders activated, felling the hounds before they reached the residence.</p><p>However, a few still made it to the house. They invaded the living room by ramming through the windows.</p><p>Ayaka fled into the hallway in terror, engaging the hounds at close quarters. <em>(* Although Ayaka had a negative personality and was terrified at this moment, she had a fundamentally unyielding spirit, and would do her very best even if she complained at the same time.)</em></p><p>Ayaka used crow feathers as magic bullets to stop the invasion of the hounds; these were the basics of the basics in the realm of Witchcraft.</p><p><em>(* These crow feather magic bullets were different from Rin\u2019s magic bullets. The crow feather magic bullets had this organic effect that would give the unmistakable impression of Black Magic. A large quantity of crow feathers was released from the ring \u2192 countless crow feathers turned into magic bullets and were launched.)</em></p><p>In the meantime, Lancer was in a garden facing the house, leading a pack of hounds.</p><p>He seemed unmotivated, yet it also seemed like he was talking with the hounds.</p><p><em>(* The hounds were Misaya\u2019s familiars. Lancer reluctantly brought the hounds at Misaya\u2019s command.)</em></p><p><strong>LANCER:</strong></p><p>\u3164Oi oi, what\u2019s the meaning of this? Didn\u2019t you say you have no idea who the girl is?</p><p>Although Lancer was chatting with Misaya, she was nowhere to be seen. Misaya was actually painting her nails in her room right now.</p><p><strong>MISAYA:</strong></p><p>\u3164Because even though she\u2019s trash, she is still the daughter of the victor of the last war. Although I feel my familiar should suffice\u2026</p><p>\u3164Listen Lancer, bring her head to me. The night is late, you have ten minutes.</p><p>Lancer leaped into action while complaining.</p><p>Ayaka was still engaging the hounds in the hallway.</p><p>Although terrified, she clenched her teeth and refused to cry. She wanted to defeat the hounds with her unyielding determination of a braggart.</p><p>However, the vicious hounds held their breath.</p><p>In the shadows, a lean figure emerged. Lancer.</p><p><strong>LANCER:</strong></p><p>\u3164Ah, you are the young mistress of the house?</p><p>Lancer sounded really unmotivated.</p><p>Ayaka could feel her goose flesh. I am going to die, she thought, I am going to die no matter what I do. By reflex, she strafed Lancer with magic bullets. Ayaka almost depleted all the sorceries at her disposal.</p><p>Lancer charged in with a storm of magic while wearing a fierce grin. He swept his spear (without motivation, only adequate) at where Ayaka was.</p><p>Ayaka dodged by a hair\u2019s breadth, fleeing into the depth of the hallway.</p><p><strong>LANCER:</strong></p><p>\u3164(Whistle) Not bad, not bad at all. Good instinct\u2026 it would be a bit of a waste to kill her here.</p><p>Ayaka desperately ran out of the house, toward the garden.</p><p>Lancer pursued with airy steps, together with the two remaining hounds.</p><hr><h3 id="s04-the-summoning-of-saber" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#s04-the-summoning-of-saber" aria-hidden="true">#</a> S04/The Summoning of Saber</h3><p>Ayaka reached the garden at the inner part of the mansion.</p><p>She closed the door, and activated the locking Bound Field. Ayaka then fled into the depth of the garden.</p><p><strong>AYAKA\u2019S</strong> <strong>FATHER:</strong></p><p>\u3164No one can breach the sorceries here. If something goes wrong, run to here.</p><p>Ayaka remembered the words of her father.</p><p>However, the door was easily blown away by a single thrust of Lancer\u2019s spear.</p><p>Two hounds charged in from the darkness beyond the door.</p><p>There were two magic bullets remaining. Ayaka managed to strike the head of one hound, but the other overwhelmed her.</p><p>Her thigh was bitten. Her clothes and arms were torn. The hound posed to snap Ayaka\u2019s neck, but she fired at its abdomen point-blank. The hound was sent flying. Ayaka collapsed onto the ground, not able to move due to exhaustion and fear.</p><p><strong>LANCER:</strong></p><p>\u3164What\u2019s wrong? Out of ammunitions? Or running out of motivation? Well either way, I will finish what I came here to do.</p><p>The lean silhouette drew closer.</p><p>Ayaka could only stare at Lancer due to sheer terror.</p><p><strong>AYAKA</strong> <strong>(M):</strong></p><p>\u3164No, no, no, no!</p><p>\u3164I\u2019ll be killed, I\u2019ll be killed, just like my sister, I\u2019ll be killed\u2026!</p><p>The scream repeated in her head like a refrain.</p><p>Lancer picked up his spear with ease.</p><p><strong>LANCER:</strong></p><p>\u3164Just about ten minutes. Good, I am on time.</p><p>A gleaming spear.</p><p>The approaching doom.</p><p>Ayaka\u2019s head was blank and her thoughts seared. The images from eight years ago came flashing back.</p><p><strong>AYAKA:</strong></p><p>\u3164Save me, Father\u2026!</p><p>Responding to Ayaka\u2019s scream, a Command Spell emerged from her chest.</p><p><em>(* It was not a Command Spell, rather it was a Holy Relic previously buried into her body.)</em></p><p>Lancer\u2019s spear thrust into Ayaka\u2019s chest.</p><p>However, Lancer reacted with a frown of dismay.</p><p>Ayaka\u2019s chest began to gather light. The summoning circle rotated on the</p><p>ground like a puzzle, coming into completion.</p><p>The flashbacks within Ayaka\u2019s mind.</p><p>The Holy Grail, the girls gathered for living sacrifice, the inhuman deeds, the crazed Father who screamed in the giant underground cavern, the silhouette of someone who carried the eight years old Ayaka after saving her from ????, who wished to sacrifice Ayaka.</p><p><strong>AYAKA:</strong></p><p>\u3164I, I\u2026</p><p>\u3164I cannot become friends with such people</p><p>\u3164I will not become a woman who would forgive such deeds\u2026!</p><p>Ayaka bellowed a second time from the depth of her heart.</p><p>This was not a scream of terror, but a catharsis of the rage that had crushed Ayaka for eight long years.</p><p>The summoning of Saber had begun. The garden swirled with light and wind. The surge from Ayaka\u2019s awakening caused the plants in the garden to bloom in unison.</p><p><strong>LANCER:</strong></p><p>\u3164Wha\u2026!?</p><p>Because his spear was pushed back, Lancer became serious rather than continuing to toy with Ayaka.</p><p>He switched from a one-handed stance into two-handed, but it was too late.</p><p>The knight\u2019s slash arrived together with a radiant flash.</p><p>The spear was repelled. Saber charged at Lancer, trailed by scattering petals of the blooming flowers. The two crossed blades. Lancer was knocked faraway, while the knight descended before Ayaka after whipping his blade.</p><p>Servant Saber, materialised.</p><p>The battle between the two ended after several bouts.</p><p>Lancer retreated after his spear was severed by Saber\u2019s invisible sword.</p><p>Saber turned, reaching out his hand towards Ayaka, who watched the battle in a daze.</p><p>And thus, the Contract was forged in the garden, under the moon.</p><hr><h3 id="s05-misaya-i" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#s05-misaya-i" aria-hidden="true">#</a> S05/Misaya (I)</h3><p>Following S04.</p><p>At Reiroukan mansion, Misaya\u2019s bedroom.</p><p>The owner of the mansion, Misaya, was sitting on the sofa. Behind her was an empty room, which twisted and turned like one of Dali\u2019s paintings.</p><p>A red spear emerged in the middle of the warped room. That red spear was Lancer\u2019s Noble Phantasm, and the twisted space inside the room was to seal away that Noble Phantasm.</p><p><em>(It was a set-up created by Misaya to hide his killing move.

Then, don\u2019t tell me your life was simply made for making sensible decisions?</p><p><strong>AYAKA:</strong></p><p>\u3164Ah\u2026!</p><p>Ayaka swallowed a retort with a red face.</p><hr><p>Midday, in the living room of the Sajou residence. Saber and Ayaka were bickering just like before.</p><p><strong>AYAKA:</strong></p><p>\u3164I keep saying I don\u2019t want to fight, so why do you keep following me!?</p><p><strong>SABER:</strong></p><p>\u3164Because Ayaka is my Master, of course. Even if you are the lowest-level Master, both headstrong and timid, with no good point other than that black magic, I still have no choice but to protect you.</p><p>\u3164No matter what you say, you see, I am still a knight.</p><p><strong>AYAKA:</strong></p><p>\u3164I don\u2019t want to be protected! If you want a powerful Master, why don\u2019t you go to Misaya\u2019s place?!</p><p><strong>SABER:</strong></p><p>\u3164Hmm? That\u2019s difficult. Although as long as both Servant and Master agree, it can be changed\u2026</p><p>Saber showed a satisfied smile to Ayaka, who had \u201Cwhy\u201D written all over her face.</p><p><strong>SABER:</strong></p><p>\u3164I like Ayaka better. This time I definitely need to protect you.</p><p>He replied like that. Compared with a knight, his personality seemed more like that of a prince.</p><p>With these perplexing feelings, Ayaka slowly began to blush, but took note of the \u201Cthis time\u201D that Saber stated.</p><p><strong>AYAKA:</strong></p><p>\u3164Sa\u2014Saber, you\u2019ve done those things before?</p><p><strong>SABER:</strong></p><p>\u3164Those things? Hmm, I should say that it is my first time protecting an awkward girl like Ayaka.</p><p><strong>AYAKA:</strong></p><p>\u3164I wasn\u2019t talking about that, I was asking about you being in the Holy Grail War!</p><p><strong>SABER:</strong></p><p>\u3164Of course. Eight years ago, in this city, I fought until the very end. It\u2019s just that my memory of that time is very fuzzy.</p><p>Saber insisted that his memory of his first war was indistinct.</p><p>But in fact, although he forgot the details, he still remembered most of it.</p><p><em>(He remembered that Ayaka\u2019s sister Manaka was his Master, and that he saved Ayaka when she was about to be killed, and that he killed Manaka himself)</em></p><p><strong>SABER:</strong></p><p>\u3164But, you really are seen as an outsider everywhere. Shouldn\u2019t you take off those glasses to make yourself look more high-spirited?</p><p>Ayaka blushed angrily.</p><p>When Ayaka wears glasses, she uses a first-rate manner of speaking, but after removing the glasses she has the personality of Rin from Fate/Stay Night.</p><hr><h3 id="s08-rider" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#s08-rider" aria-hidden="true">#</a> S08/Rider</h3><p>Saber and Ayaka received intelligence from Sancraid that there were some suspicious activities in the industrial zone, and thus they went to investigate.</p><p>The factory was filled with the odour of flesh and blood, like that of rusted iron.</p><p>At the back of the automated conveyor belt, laid a mountain of corpses. Sitting at the centre of this mountain was a Servant who dressed like an Assassin.</p><p>This was the Servant who donned the iron mask, Rider.</p><p><strong>SABER:</strong></p><p>\u3164Is this all your work?</p><p><strong>RIDER:</strong></p><p>\u3164What if it is?</p><p>Rider&#39;s outrageous deed infuriated Saber and Ayaka.</p><p><strong>SABER:</strong></p><p>\u3164You have forgotten the agreement.

A muffled chuckle came from underneath the mask.</p><p><strong>RIDER:</strong></p><p>\u3164I am free, free of the bondage of a Master. Because he used all of the Command Spells the moment before he died, I received this incarnated body.</p><p><strong>SABER:</strong></p><p>\u3164You, you&#39;ve slain your own Master\u2026!</p><p>Rider was a Servant who was free after slaying his Master.</p><p>Since he had no Master, he replenished the magical energy needed to sustain his body with the lives of humans.</p><p><strong>RIDER:</strong></p><p>\u3164The Holy Grail is too rich a treat for mere magi. Allow me, a Heroic Spirit, to properly utilize it instead.</p><p>Saber and Rider engaged in fierce combat.</p><p>Rider had the significant advantage in battle as he wielded many Noble Phantasms and laid many traps within the factory. Rider with his &quot;aim for the Master instead of the Servant&quot; tactic proved to be a great challenge for Ayaka, who lacked the ability to defend herself.</p><p>Rider overwhelmed Ayaka, but he hesitated for an instant before delivering the killing blow. Using this opportunity, Saber rescued Ayaka and withdrew.</p><hr><p>This scene depicted Ayaka&#39;s internal conflict and loss.</p><p>The corpses of innocent victims stacked into a mountain, forcing Ayaka to face the reality.</p><p><strong>AYAKA</strong> <strong>(M):</strong></p><p>\u3164These people\u2026 these people are dead.</p><p>\u3164It&#39;s a lie to say I don&#39;t even know what they looked like.

I have no complaints about waiting for the others to show themselves, but\u2026</p><p>There was not much time left for Misaya. Different from other Masters, Misaya had a time limit. She could not afford to choose elegant tactics. If necessary, she even had to ally with Sancraid, and be driven by his greed.</p><p><strong>MISAYA:</strong></p><p>\u3164Enough. My life and my belief are separate things. Weighing pros and cons disgust me. I will not make such a decision for as long as I can afford.</p><p>Hearing this speech that was neither a joke nor a bluff, Lancer said &quot;yare yare&quot; while shrugging his shoulders.

Although an informal affair, it was one that was formally requested by the authorities of the Church.</p><p>There were over a hundred Cardinals at the heart of the Holy Church, and one among them secretly withdrew Imitation Grail Number ###, with the plan to recreate the miracle in the Far East.</p><p>The goal was to use the souls of the seven Servants as the ignition charge (a primer), and summon a new being of a higher level of existence.</p><p>The Holy Grail was peddled to the participating magi as a wish-granting machine.</p><p>The purpose of the Minor Grail (read as: Symbol) was to summon the benevolent souls known as Heroic Spirits.</p><p>The underground Greater Grail (read as: Saint Graph) was used to store a large number of souls.</p><p>Aside from the aforementioned fundamental differences, the other features of this Holy Grail War were almost identical to that of Fate/Stay Night.</p><p>The heretic priest who turned away from God spoke.</p><p><strong>PRIEST:</strong></p><p>\u3164Have you ever considered why the Holy Grail takes the form of a chalice?</p><p>\u3164It is the miracle of our Lord, perhaps a Gauge that proves the mysteries of ancient times.</p><p>\u3164A chalice carries water, thus it is a container for water.</p><p>\u3164The Holy Grail is a chalice forged through the grace of God, so it is a container for the metaphysical: the thoughts of men.</p><p>\u3164A man\u2019s thoughts are a resource that carries no energy, something that is not physically observable. Yet, the Holy Grail is able to grant form to the thoughts of men.</p><p>Because of this, the Holy Grail was able to recreate Heroic Spirits.</p><p>Heroic Spirits were just figments of imagination, shared illusions dreamed up by humans throughout history.</p><p><strong>MAGUS:</strong></p><p>\u3164Then there is a problem here, after the summoning of Heroic Spirits, the role of the Holy Grail will have ended.</p><p><strong>PRIEST:</strong></p><p>\u3164Yes, indeed.</p><p>\u3164As you have said, heroes are born from good will.</p><p>\u3164\u2026Unfortunately, what many people wish for is not good will, but an ill will called desire.

Instead, he placed his faith in the goodness of people.</p><p>The youth&#39;s death filled Rider with rage.</p><p>In that instant, he decided what his wish would be.</p><p>To grant his Master happiness.</p><p>He would give his Master the happiness of a normal man through the power of the Grail.</p><hr><p>Rider watched the youth until the very end, and quietly left the ward (laboratory). The monitoring magi said,</p><p><strong>RESEARCHER:</strong></p><p>\u3164Don&#39;t worry, sire. Although the summoner is dead, you can use this mask as a mimic for the Master&#39;s face\u2026 eh?</p><p>His head was lopped off.</p><p>Wearing an icy expression, Rider slayed all the researchers. He then picked up the mask, and blended into the city.</p><p>Without a master supplying magical energy, Rider could only replenish himself by killing humans.</p><p>Surrounded by the carcasses of the people he had massacred, Rider swore this oath.</p><p><strong>RIDER:</strong></p><p>\u3164\u2026For him, for him who wished for people&#39;s happiness,</p><p>Overlooking the lively nightscape of the city.</p><p><strong>RIDER:</strong></p><p>\u3164\u2026I will kill you, kill you all.</p><p>The iron mask was covered in tears of blood.</p><p>The merry prince who knew nothing but happiness seemed to swore this while crying tears of blood.</p><p>Yet he knew, his deeds, were precisely the darkest sins that would stain the dream of the youth.</p><hr><h3 id="s16-underground-church-berserker" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#s16-underground-church-berserker" aria-hidden="true">#</a> S16/Underground Church, Berserker</h3><p>Ayaka and Sancraid, Scene 2.

Young lady, his fate is up to you.</p><p>Sancraid forced Ayaka to relinquish her Master&#39;s rights by threatening Saber&#39;s life. Ayaka obeyed since at that time she already fell in love with Saber.</p><p>\u3164You have indeed forfeited the Master&#39;s rights for Saber. Thank you for your cooperation, young lady.</p><p>\u3164However, since Saber is riddled with all kinds of glitches, I will have to remake him. Crush her, Berserker!</p><p><strong>AYAKA:</strong></p><p>\u3164You\u2026 you deceived me!</p><p>Ayaka unleashed her Witchcraft.</p><p>A magic circle emerged beneath the feet of Sancraid, neutralizing (cancelling) the magic bolts.</p><p><strong>AYAKA:</strong></p><p>\u3164Magic Resistance\u2026!</p><p><strong>SANCRAID:</strong></p><p>\u3164Yes. You see, I am very cautious. If I don&#39;t move the magic circle around, I would be too afraid to move myself.</p><p>Ayaka was shocked by this fact.</p><p><strong>AYAKA:</strong></p><p>\u3164I have never heard of a moving magic circle. If what you said is true, your Magic Resistance is on the same rank as Saber\u2026!</p><p><strong>SANCRAID:</strong></p><p>\u3164Correct. Now young lady you are useless, go die.</p><p><strong>AYAKA:</strong></p><p>\u3164I knew it would be like this! Isn&#39;t your catch phrase &#39;I wish to resolve matters in a peaceful manner&#39;?! Aren&#39;t you a man of the Church?</p><p><strong>SANCRAID:</strong></p><p>\u3164Ha. Hahaha. Gahahahahahaha! Ah, those were lies! I hate Asians! The Japanese disgust me the most amongst them all!</p><hr><p>The battle begins.</p><p>The first-ranked Master, Sancraid, and the seventh-ranked Master, Ayaka, are equally matched.</p><p>Ayaka is already doing her utmost just to defend and dodge.</p><p>When she is about to fall, Ayaka has a flashback about all the things that have happened up until now and stands firm.</p><p>Living together with Saber. The trauma from eight years ago. And the conversation with her rival, Misaya.</p><p><strong>MISAYA</strong> <strong>(RECOLLECTION):</strong></p><p>\u3164Your magical ability is second-rate.</p><p>\u3164And even so you reach for the Holy Grail, Sajou heir?</p><p>The disparaged Ayaka.</p><p>She compared herself to her sister, which was essentially self-torture.</p><p>Anyways, she was always afraid of something.</p><p>She told herself that she could do nothing. She didn\u2019t want to fail. But\u2026</p><p><strong>MISAYA</strong> <strong>(RECOLLECTION):</strong></p><p>\u3164You had better not misunderstand the reason I ridicule you.</p><p>\u3164The talent and skill necessary to become a magus are not simply numerical values. Measuring the heights of and mocking another\u2019s strength is a lowlife\u2019s affair.</p><p>\u3164What I am ridiculing is your heart. You are always indulging in dreams, it makes it hard to think of you as a Master equal to me.</p><p>Ayaka could not respond to Misaya\u2019s point.</p><p>Just as Misaya said, Ayaka could not identify herself as the victim or the aggressor. It was this indecisive frame of mind that Misaya called \u201Cunpleasant\u201D.</p><p><strong>AYAKA:</strong></p><p>\u3164I\u2026 I\u2026</p><p>\u3164I can\u2019t be, like my sister, but\u2026!</p><p>Ayaka took a deep breath, hardening her resolve, and faced the pursuing Sancraid, waiting for him. Sancraid mocked the futile struggles of Ayaka, whose appearance had changed.</p><p><strong>SANCRAID:</strong></p><p>\u3164Why do you fight?! Especially under these circumstances! There is no way for you to become the winner. The you who are of lowest rank, who has never won over another Master!</p><p><strong>AYAKA:</strong></p><p>\u3164That, I understood since eight years ago!</p><p>\u3164I cannot do anything!</p><p>Ayaka shouted out as if to let herself hear.</p><p>She remembered Saber\u2019s words from before.</p><p><strong>SABER</strong> <strong>(M):</strong></p><p>\u3164The course of events and the outcome are not one set. The two should be separated.</p><p>\u3164Effort that is unable to achieve a result is meaningless, is it not? Naught but foolish sophistry.</p><p>\u3164The process and outcome are separated and independent. At times they choose themselves, and thus become the answer.</p><p>Understanding Saber\u2019s words, Ayaka lifted her head.</p><p>In front of her was the depraved priest, Sancraid.</p><p><strong>AYAKA:</strong></p><p>\u3164But I will fight. Even if I can do nothing, at the very least\u2026 something like choosing to fight, I can still accomplish\u2026!</p><p>The willpower to fight, was a farewell declaration to the self who was weak up until now.</p><p>If Saber has been stolen, then it is up to me to take him back! she thought.</p><hr><p>The end of Ayaka and Sancraid\u2019s fight.</p><p>Ayaka\u2019s greatest enemy, the priest who controlled the Holy Grail War, was extinguished here. Although powerful enemies still remained, it seemed that Ayaka\u2019s fight was already over, however\u2026</p><p>In the rubble of the collapsed underground church, Sancraid is still laughing wildly even though he has been defeated. Ayaka is at the last of her strength, but still resolutely glares at Sancraid, while he has a delighted smile on his face.</p><p><strong>SANCRAID:</strong></p><p>\u3164Since you seem to be misunderstanding, let me correct you. My Master position is ranked below 7.</p><p>\u3164You want to ask, \u2018Why? Isn\u2019t there no one left?\u2019 I am a monk. I was never a magus!</p><p>Then, the first-ranked one is\u2026?</p><hr><h3 id="s17-heaven-s-fall-part-2" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#s17-heaven-s-fall-part-2" aria-hidden="true">#</a> S17/Heaven&#39;s Fall (Part 2)</h3><p>The scene shifted back to Scene 0, the final duel between Saber and Archer.</p><p>The two fought from the subway to the open air.

It is the original story of Fate. The setup of the youth, Saber, and the girl magus who uses black magic, together as Master and Servant; the enemy Servant who lives with the protagonist\u2019s friend; the double-sealed holy sword\u2026 these are charms unique to the original. Because our reluctance to leave behind the key parts of what was discarded from Fate/Stay Night deepened every year, we thought about how to somehow give it shape\u2026</p><p>We had the fortune of all kinds of good timing, and we decided to release Prototype as bonus material with CP, but to tell the truth, touching Prototype again after 20 years was extremely interesting after all. The fragmented scenes Nasu told us about that were \u201Cdevelopments after this\u201D had much more impact than I could have imagined, and I felt that they combined all of the key factors that we had liked back then.</p><p>To all the staff who supervised and worked on this production which was quite high-calorie [lots of content] to be called bonus material, I am deeply thankful.</p><p>I must apologize to everyone who was looking forward to a brand-new Fate story. At present, we have no plans to make an anime or game of the complete version of this work. Everything of interest has already been included in this bonus material.</p><p>An episode containing both core fragments and chaotic sections. I would be honored if everyone enjoyed watching Fate/Prototype.</p><hr><h3 id="nasu-kinoko" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#nasu-kinoko" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Nasu Kinoko</h3><p>The unbelievable Proto Fate.</p><p>Originally, we planned to do something different from TAKE-MOON at the end of CP Season 3, and make a surprise with some original work.</p><p>For example, there were movie proposals like Princess Arc VS Saber Lily, or one scene from Tsukihime 2, but in the end it was decided \u201CAs a joke, let\u2019s release Proto just like a movie. Pretend it is a movie trailer. Pick the best parts, but make sure to tell the story properly\u201D.</p><p>So, we decided to \u201Cjust once, return to the original\u201D for our 10-year anniversary.</p><p>That being the case, after I reread the original work during the script-making, I couldn\u2019t help but be extremely interested. The main idea of this work, Prototype, was in the style of the \u201880s romance, or \u201CA story of revolutionizing the world\u201D.</p><p>This story was released in 2004 as \u201CA story of revolutionizing oneself\u201D, keeping the basic rules the same but massively different, Fate/Stay Night being the result. The large differences in purpose for obtaining the Holy Grail represent the changing of trends of the period, interesting.</p><p>For me, this is an undiluted existence, an already left-behind storyline of \u201CAs long as the young hero looks good, it\u2019s fine\u201D. I guess this is the so-called FPT [Fate/ProtoType].</p>', 867);
