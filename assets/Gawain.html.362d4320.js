If I&#39;m not mistaken,<br> this looks like a tag for a writ of seizure.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Huh? You&#39;re right.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> The latch for the item carrier is unlocked.</p><hr><p><strong>Gawain:</strong><br> There appears to be a note.<br> Let&#39;s see...</p><p><strong>Gawain:</strong><br> \u201C-Notice of Collections- Repayment for the borrowed Ascension materials is overdue.\u201D</p><p><strong>Gawain:</strong><br> \u201CTherefore, under the terms of the loan as agreed upon,<br> we have seized all items from your possession as repayment with the appropriate and agreed upon interest stipulated in the loan document.\u201D</p><p><strong>Gawain:</strong><br> \u201CYours in security, experience, and...love.<br> Like a great neighbor, Caesar Co. is there.\u201D</p><p><strong>Gawain:</strong><br> I feel faint...<br> I can only hope I&#39;m not reading this right...</p><p><strong>Gawain:</strong><br> Fujimaru.<br> Is what this flier says true?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Now you mention it, he did give me a Proof of Hero.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Honestly, it kinda got pushed on me...</p><hr><p><strong>Gawain:</strong><br> Why didn&#39;t you refuse...<br> Surely you know that nothing in life is free?</p><p><strong>Gawain:</strong><br> Well, there&#39;s no use lamenting what is past.<br> When did this happen, Fujimaru?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> About two months ago.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Don&#39;t remember...it was so long ago.</p><hr><p><strong>Gawain:</strong><br> This course of action is so obviously corrupt... Simply absconding with the goods without so much as a letter of intent or warning...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> The work of a true pro\u2013Er, habitual criminal.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> But I didn&#39;t have much to take in the first place.</p><hr><p><strong>Gawain:</strong><br> Not much to take?<br> But there&#39;s a receipt here... (Gasp!)</p><p><strong>Gawain:</strong><br> It&#39;s! Not! Here! The materials I brought to commemorate your summoning me...are gone...!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Y-you brought...what?</p><hr><p><strong>Gawain:</strong><br> What a silly thing to ask... Tribute for my liege lord, of course. Since you are the one taking care of me, it seemed the only sensible and proper thing to do.</p><p><strong>Gawain:</strong><br> Eh? Nobody does that? Everyone just comes empty-handed? ...Honestly, it seems no one has a real sense of what it is to be a hero anymore...</p><p><strong>Gawain:</strong><br> At any rate, let me list off what I brought you:</p><p><strong>Gawain:</strong><br> Four Octuplet Crystals, ten Hearts of the Foreign God, two Great Knight Medals, twenty Evil Bones, ten Forbidden Pages, and ten Seeds of Yggdrasil!</p><p><strong>Gawain:</strong><br> The \u201CTriple Sunny Recommended Set\u201D has been taken!<br> This is a catastrophe!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> The Knights of the Round Table are awfully generous, huh?</p><p><strong>Gawain:</strong><br> Of course. To be an asset, not a burden,<br> to one&#39;s lord is the hallmark of a great knight.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> What a well-rounded set of materials.</p><p><strong>Gawain:</strong><br> Of course. I thought materials like Evil Bones were unnecessary, but Gareth insisted that you would love them...</p><hr><p><strong>Gawain:</strong><br> Well, now&#39;s not the time to go over the contents of my gift!</p><p><strong>Gawain:</strong><br> For a Servant to steal from his Master is a thing unheard of!</p><p><strong>Gawain:</strong><br> In the name of the sun,<br> I shall bring this evil Caesar to justice!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> Ack! Why are you attacking me without any kind of warning!?</p><p><strong>Gawain:</strong><br> Pardon me. I simply decided it would be most expedient to skip the annoying explanations of your crimes.</p><p><strong>Gawain:</strong><br> And it appears the collection notice was destroyed in our battle.</p><p><strong>Gawain:</strong><br> An unfortunate occurrence, but you will simply have to accept your fat\u2013</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> No, no. What you received earlier was only a copy.<br> The original, you see, was carefully stored in my bosom!</p><p><strong>Gawain:</strong></p><p>ACCEPT YOUR FAAATE!!!</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> Gwaaaaaahhh!!!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Caesar!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Wasn&#39;t that a bit...much for him?</p><hr><p><strong>Gawain:</strong><br> Please do not fret. I collected your materials before I burnt that blackguard to cinders.</p><p><strong>Gawain:</strong><br> Eight million QP and one Forbidden Page...?</p><p><strong>Gawain:</strong><br> Strange...<br> That isn&#39;t right...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Eight million QP...?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Does that mean he&#39;s already sold everything?</p><hr><p><strong>Gawain:</strong><br> I see...so this QP is the proceeds...!<br> Wonderful deduction, Fujimaru!</p><p><strong>Gawain:</strong><br> Hey, you, burning man!<br> To whom did you sell those materials?</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> Heh...hehehehe... You think I&#39;d just give out my customers&#39; private information so easily?</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> I have my pride as a businessman,<br> young leader of the Britain Group.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I thought you were a general?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Wait, you&#39;re what now? Uh, since when? Why?</p><hr><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> Heh heh... I never imagined I of all people could be so possessed by such low greed...</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> Perhaps I erred in trying to go big in order not to be outdone by the David Credit Union...ungh...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> David Credit Union!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> You&#39;ll throw Chaldea&#39;s economy into chaos!</p><hr><p><strong>Gawain:</strong><br> So Caesar Holdings was also a victim of greed...but that doesn&#39;t matter.</p><p><strong>Gawain:</strong><br> Fujimaru, I see some records of transactions for the past few days.</p><p><strong>Gawain:</strong><br> By tracing these transactions, we should be able to locate the materials. Do not think of me as nothing more than a wielder of a sacred sword.</p><p><strong>Gawain:</strong><br> Investigation is a matter of legwork. Crime must be punished. Wives should be young. These are the basics of being a knight!</p><p><strong>Gawain:</strong><br> Master. Will you allow me to continue spearheading this investigation?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> We probably need to reexamine those \u201Cbasics.\u201D</p><p><strong>Gawain:</strong><br> Hahaha, that&#39;s what it means to be a land owner.<br> I was always busy with odd tasks back in the day.</p><p><strong>Gawain:</strong><br> I have also heard that there was a rather uninhibited shogun in Japan who concealed his identity and took to the streets to fight crime.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> What about the David Credit Union?</p><p><strong>Gawain:</strong><br> We will raid them in due course.<br> For now, let&#39;s concentrate on retrieving those materials.</p><hr><p><strong>Gawain:</strong><br> Now that that&#39;s settled,<br> let&#39;s take a look at this list.</p><p><strong>Gawain:</strong><br> Knowingly purchasing stolen goods is a crime as well!<br> We shall punish these purchasers!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> Hot! Hot, hot! Damn you, Gawain!</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> Attacking me during the day... Coward! If you&#39;re a true knight, then spring a surprise attack at night, fair and square!</p><p><strong>Gawain:</strong><br> A thoughtless imbecile deserves a harsh punishment. Especially when they are a family member.</p><p><strong>Gawain:</strong><br> Honestly... I didn&#39;t expect you to be someone who would have bought these stolen goods. I am not Sir Tristan, but I must say that this saddens me.</p><p><strong>Gawain:</strong><br> I can overlook your boorish manners, but I never thought that even you would stoop so low as to purchase stolen goods.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> I didn&#39;t STOOP!!!<br> I paid for that stuff fair and square!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Why did you do business with Caesar Holdings?</p><hr><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> &#39;Course I&#39;d get involved.<br> I&#39;m Mordred, the great king-killer!</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> When I sit the throne, I&#39;ll need a trusted minister.<br> You know, like a minister of finance.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> I had to fire that cheap-ass Agravain,<br> and I wanted someone rich in his place...</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> And y&#39;know, that Caesar guy&#39;s pretty hefty. Looks like a guy who never misses a meal, so he must be rich!</p><p><strong>Gawain:</strong><br> Well, you must disassociate yourself from that gluttonous Roman aristocrat! You&#39;ve been summoned in modern times, so you should be eating vegetables! Potatoes!</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> Well, okay, yeah... I guess you&#39;ve kinda got him pegged, but...I don&#39;t get you!</p><p><strong>Gawain:</strong><br> No, you must understand. As penance, you will eat only from a menu I specially design for one full month!</p><p><strong>Gawain:</strong><br> First of all, ketchup is not a vegetable, so you may not have it. You may consume only potatoes.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> ...What the hell...<br> Everyone in my family is freakin&#39; nuts!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> It&#39;s for your own good, Mordred.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> I know that, but...Gawain&#39;s always trying to play at being a big brother when no one else from the Round Table is around...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> We&#39;re taking the materials.</p><hr><p><strong>Gawain:</strong><br> Yes, let&#39;s collect the materials, Master. Let&#39;s see, two Octuplet Crystals... We&#39;re still missing two.</p><p><strong>Gawain:</strong><br> So they&#39;ve been used... Well, I&#39;ll let that slide.<br> Oh? Are we also missing a Great Knight Medal...?</p><p><strong>Gawain:</strong><br> What is the meaning of this, Mordred?<br> So far as I know, you have no use for that catalyst.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> Yeah, I don&#39;t use it, but I want it!<br> Don&#39;t you get it!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...You want it as a keepsake, right?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> Y-yeah. It&#39;s not about showing off or anything like that... But I thought I could have at least one...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Come on, a king wouldn&#39;t need a medal to prove themselves...</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> You&#39;re right! Come to think of it,<br> I&#39;m the one who should be GIVING those out!</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> So...it&#39;s fine. Even if I don&#39;t have any Great Knight Medals left to hand out. Not like I care or anything...</p><hr><p><strong>Gawain:</strong><br> ...Honestly.<br> What are we going to do with you?</p><p><strong>Gawain:</strong><br> Much as I desperately desire the medals,<br> I will take only one.</p><p><strong>Gawain:</strong><br> Now, let us move on to our next materials to recover. Next up: ten Hearts of the Foreign God.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> Seriously!?<br> I actually want THOSE more!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Gawain:</strong><br> I-impossible...<br> Only five Dragon Fangs!?</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> I am sorry.<br> I am so very sorry...</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> I tried to stop her, but she insisted she really needed them, and then my Golden Rule got too powerful...</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong><br> I&#39;m sorry...Caesar asked me if my love was getting cold, and he suggested I cook something that would invigorate a husband.</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong><br> And he said that making a stew with ten hearts would be just the thing...</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> Exactly... Ungh... It did bring my Golden Rule back to its peak when I was in my prime... (Burp)...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> So that&#39;s why you look so pale...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> That sounds...not good...</p><hr><p><strong>Gawain:</strong><br> If the material was used in a dish made by a loving wife for her husband, then I have no cause for anger.</p><p><strong>Gawain:</strong><br> It&#39;s a shame I lost the Hearts, but it&#39;s a small price to pay to reinforce a couple&#39;s love. The materials are yours to keep.</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong><br> Oh...thank you very much...<br> And I apologize. I misunderstood you...</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong><br> Because...you are...you know, THAT, during the day...so I thought you had no interest in love.</p><p><strong>Gawain:</strong><br> No, I&#39;m quite used to being seen as stuffy.<br> Please, think nothing of it.</p><p><strong>Gawain:</strong><br> After all, I&#39;m always with Sir Lancelot and Sir Tristan. Compared to those two, I must certainly seem rather boring.</p><p><strong>Gawain:</strong><br> Anyway, a loving couple is a good thing.<br> I wish you two eternal happiness.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> Um... I&#39;m not...um...</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong><br> Yes. Thank you, Sir Gawain.<br> Ah, that carefree smile of yours... I am quite troubled...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Yeah, even if you&#39;re a pretend couple!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> (And then, Siegfried was never seen again...)</p><hr><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Gawain:</strong><br> ...Whew. It was a long journey, but we have managed to retrieve half of the stolen materials.</p><p><strong>Gawain:</strong><br> And yet, in a way, each and every person we encountered was a victim. Had I gone all-out, I would have brought many people to financial ruin...</p><p><strong>Gawain:</strong><br> It would seem the moment is mete to stop, lamentably.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> We blazed through the second half...</p><p><strong>Gawain:</strong><br> Hahaha. Lady Cat is a force of nature. Let&#39;s just say that eating a few Evil Bones is part of her feral charm.</p><p><strong>Gawain:</strong><br> The remaining three, however, acted in a most evil and premeditated fashion. I had neither mercy nor sympathy for the likes of them.</p><p><strong>Gawain:</strong><br> And so my Galatine became the instrument of their punishment!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> You&#39;ve got talent as a collections agent.</p><p><strong>Gawain:</strong><br> Hah! This was something of a first for me, but I am glad it went well.</p><p><strong>Gawain:</strong><br> I heed all cries for aid. A knight of my position is needed even outside of battle.</p><p><strong>Gawain:</strong><br> In short, I am a jack-of-all-trades.<br> If you, Master, need anything, please let me know.</p><hr><p><strong>Gawain:</strong><br> Anyway, the case is closed.</p><p><strong>Gawain:</strong><br> I have fewer materials than when we began, but I will simply have to collect them again.</p><p><strong>Gawain:</strong><br> Our fight continues. With you, even our daily training is a joyous task, Master.</p>', 193);
