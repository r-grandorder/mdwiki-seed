That&#39;s just what I like to hear.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Sure, but what&#39;s this about?</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> Well, as it turns out, it&#39;s about something extremely important. Something that directly concerns me.</p><hr><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> Let me get straight to the point:<br> I have something I wish to confess to you.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> Well, that&#39;s rude. There&#39;s no need to look as though you&#39;re bracing for impact.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> Unlike a certain dragon princess I could name,<br> I am under no delusions about who you truly are.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> ...Ahem.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> I know I may have been treating you a bit, well, coldly, Master. Not to put too fine a point on it.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> Yet despite that, you have been perfectly patient with me and welcomed me with open arms.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> Therefore, I feel it is only right that I let my hair down, so to speak, and be my true self around here.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> I know what the others say about me.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> \u201CThe young beauty so cool she&#39;s ice-cold.\u201D<br> \u201CPrim and proper to a fault.\u201D</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> \u201CA porcelain doll who&#39;ll shatter at the slightest touch.\u201D<br> \u201CLovely bangs that half-hide her eyes.\u201D</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> Those are just a few of the things I&#39;ve heard myself called.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> But the truth is...</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> I am...</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> An irredeemable imp.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Bwa?</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> I suppose I should be thankful that you seem so befuddled.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> An imp? Really?</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> Oh? You sound skeptical.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> Then again, I suppose I&#39;m usually so elegantly well-behaved that it&#39;s no wonder you find it hard to believe.</p><hr><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> At any rate, the reason why I went to the trouble of announcing it like this...</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> ...is because now that you and I are on better terms, you have an obligation to know who I truly am.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> Specifically, I&#39;m going to engage in mischief.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Mischief, huh...?</p><hr><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> Yes. Mischief.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> There is something about making mischief that makes my heart dance with joy. Perhaps it takes me back to my childhood days or something like that.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> At any rate, I can no longer bear to act like the good little girl I&#39;m not, so I will no longer be doing so.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> But I will apologize in advance for the mischief I&#39;m going to cause. I&#39;m sorry, Master.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Got it. But what kind of mischief are we talking about here?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Okay, so exactly what kind of mischief did you have in mind?</p><hr><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> For that...</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> You&#39;ll just have to wait till tomorrow to find out.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> Teeheeheehee.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> ...Teeheeheehee.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Okay, time to get up...</p><hr><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...and seize the...</p><hr><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> day!?</p><hr><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> Did I surprise you!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I&#39;ll say you did...</p><hr><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> Teeheehee. My first bit of mischief was to change your room around.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> Of course, this is nothing the professor et al. haven&#39;t already done, so I&#39;m still only getting started.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Okay, but can I at least change into my uniform first?</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> Oh my.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> Very well then, I&#39;ll just stay right here in the meantime.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> No? I can&#39;t? Too bad...</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> But for the record, I&#39;ve had some experience comforting wounded soldiers...</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> ...so I have no issue with a man getting changed in front of me. Hehehe.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> Of course.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> ...Well? What are you waiting for?<br> The sooner you&#39;re done, the better.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> What, do you need a hand?<br> My, my, I guess I&#39;m not the only princess here, hm?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I guess that&#39;s one way to say good morning...</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> Indeed. Good morning, Master.<br> Hehe, nothing fazes you, does it?</p><hr><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> Now then, today is our combat simulation day, right?<br> So let&#39;s get going.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> Don&#39;t worry, Viy already set everything up.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...Mind if I tweak some of those settings first?</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> Oh my. How could you even suggest such a thing?<br> (Crocodile tears)</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> No, I think we&#39;ll be leaving the settings right where they are, thank you very much.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> And by \u201Cset everything up,\u201D I assume you mean \u201Cmore mischief\u201D?</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> Why yes.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> We always train in the same boring environments these days...</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> ...so we decided to \u201Cmix it up\u201D with some random data from the database.</p><hr><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> Now then, come along.<br> The day&#39;s not getting any younger!</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> Oh my, I wonder where we&#39;ll end up first.<br> These random choices are so exciting.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> There&#39;s no possible way this can end well...</p><hr><p><strong>P.A. System:</strong></p><p>Beginning combat simulation in three, two, one...</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> Let&#39;s see. This looks like...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...So much lava...</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> So hot.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> ...I mean, it&#39;s fine. This is fine.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Aren&#39;t you hot in here?</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> Who, me? Don&#39;t be silly.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> So hot.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> ...What? I didn&#39;t say anything.</p><hr><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> Ahem, ahem.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> I must say, Master, it must be awfully difficult for you, having to prepare for combat in an environment like this.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> It&#39;s okay. I&#39;m used to it.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> Teehee, you&#39;re a stubborn one, aren&#39;t you?</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> But you know...I actually prefer stubborn people over wishy-washy types.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> You can say that again...</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> Oh, very well then.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> I&#39;ll just have to cool you off a bit myself!<br> And by \u201Ccool you off\u201D I mean freeze you solid!</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> What&#39;s that? Thanks, but you&#39;ll manage?<br> ...Hmph, too bad.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> You&#39;d be surprised how much cooler your whole body will feel with just a mildly frozen nape.</p><hr><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> Anyway, I assume we&#39;ll be attacked shortly, yes?<br> Let&#39;s see, where will the enemies come from...?</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> Huh? The lava?</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> Oh my... How did they all survive in there?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Lava... Swimming... Khh, my head!</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> Master? Master! What happened?<br> You look white as driven snow!</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> What is it? Cyanosis? Anemia? A migraine?</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> Well, don&#39;t you worry. I might not look it, but I&#39;ve actually worked as a nurse (or something similar) before!</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> And if I remember my training correctly, you should be fine as long as I keep performing CPR on your heart!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> This is... This is from that Halloween!</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> Halloween?</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> That&#39;s that festival Chaldea holds in autumn on an irregular basis, right?</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> Does that mean you last encountered Servants swimming in lava during Halloween?</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> ...How does that work?</p><hr><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Believe me, I wish I knew...</p><hr><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> Ahem, ahem.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> At any rate, I&#39;ll take care of them.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> All you have to do, Master, is ensure I can make full use of my abilities as your Servant. Are we agreed?</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> ...So hot...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Well, we DID just fight while surrounded by lava...</p><hr><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> Ugh!</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> Whose bright idea was it to set the combat simulator to an environment like this!?</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> Oh right! It was Viy!</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> Well, I&#39;ve learned my lesson. From now on, I&#39;ll pay much closer attention when adjusting the simulator&#39;s settings.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> Now come on, let&#39;s get out of here.<br> I can&#39;t stand this heat for a moment longer.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Fine by me.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Okay, let&#39;s go ahead and shut the simulator down then.</p><hr><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> Thank you, Master.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> ...Well?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Hang on. It&#39;ll just be a minute.</p><hr><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> Well!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> That&#39;s weird...</p><hr><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> It&#39;s sooo hooot!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> All that squirming around is just gonna make you hotter!</p><hr><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> Ghhh... But not moving makes the heat worse, too...</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> I know. Maybe some light conversation will serve as a distraction.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> Let&#39;s see, what to talk about...<br> Say, how much do you know about me, anyway?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> A little something, I&#39;d say...</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> I see. Well, I&#39;m happy to hear you&#39;ve done your homework.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> In that case, I&#39;ll skip ahead a bit.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Nada.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> Oh my. Well, that won&#39;t do at all.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> Every good Master should know at least a little something about their Servants.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> Very well then.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> In that case, I will tell you about my background myself.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> ...But I&#39;ll keep it to under five minutes,<br> since it&#39;s so unbearably hot.</p><hr><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> That&#39;s like nothing!</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> What do you expect?<br> I already mentioned the unbearable heat.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> Now then. To begin, I was born into the title of Grand Duchess of the Romanov Dynasty...</p><hr><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> ...And that is how I died.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> Oh yes, it was dreadful. Growing up, I never expected I would die in such a cruel manner.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> Even now, I will never forget this grudge. If those soldiers&#39; graves were within walking distance, I would march right over there, spit on them, and rub it into the dirt.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> And yet, strangely enough...</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> Here in Chaldea, it all seems like a far-off, vaguely nostalgic dream.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Does that mean you&#39;d be glad to see humanity die off?</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> Ulp.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> Well, um... Not always, but...<br> Maybe sometimes...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Is that a bad thing?</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> Good question...</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> I would say yes, but there is also a part of me that&#39;s glad for it...because it makes me feel like I&#39;m practically a normal person.</p><hr><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> Hmm...</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> I suppose, deep down, I still believe people are fundamentally good.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> Not people like those barbaric soldiers, of course,<br> but people like my family.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> ...Which isn&#39;t to say I&#39;m not aware that, historically speaking, my family did some rather dreadful things, too.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> I know they lived, and grew up, and learned, and ate, and lived their lives like any other person would.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> Or at least, I thought I did.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> I&#39;m still not sure if our people starving to death was my fault or my father&#39;s fault.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> Or perhaps it was entirely Father and the government officials who swore loyalty to him who were to blame.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> Maybe the things they did were simply so terrible that my family...</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> ...Olga, Tatiana, Maria, and myself...</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> ...all deserved to be hacked to pieces and dissolved in sulfuric acid.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I don&#39;t\u2013</p><hr><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> ...(Sigh)</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> I&#39;m sorry. I didn&#39;t mean to bring up such unpleasant memories.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> And besides, I know I will never find answers to those questions, no matter how long I look.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> I just have to keep agonizing over them and looking back on them forever.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> It&#39;s not right for me to expect you to answer them for me, Master.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> Oh my, this won&#39;t do at all. If I don&#39;t snap out of it, I&#39;m liable to end up being summoned as an Avenger.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Yeah... I&#39;d really prefer if that didn&#39;t happen.</p><hr><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> Is that so? ...Hehe.<br> All right, Master, if you insist.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> Let&#39;s see... I believe this is how you make an unbreakable promise in your homeland, yes?</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> I swear that I will never become an Avenger.<br> Pinky promise.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> If this turns out to be a lie,<br> then cross my heart and hope to die.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> ...You know, I thought this would be a more lighthearted endeavor. I didn&#39;t realize quite how morbid it was until we got to the end.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> Though admittedly, I&#39;m still not sure how crossing one&#39;s heart could actually bring about one&#39;s death.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> And I&#39;m still not sure how one would actuallygo about crossing a heart at all.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> Good point.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I&#39;d just as soon not find out...</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> True. Some mysteries are better left unsolved.</p><hr><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> Oh my, was that an earthquake? ...No, it couldn&#39;t be, could it? Hopefully, it&#39;s a sign that we&#39;ll get to leave soon.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> I suppose this would never have happened in the first place if I hadn&#39;t encouraged Viy to play with the simulator&#39;s settings...</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> Then again, who&#39;s to say it wouldn&#39;t have?</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> Oh my. From the look on your face, I take it you don&#39;t believe it could have happened any other way?</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> Well, say what you will; my Viy is still adorable.<br> Especially his eyes when he has them both wide open.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> Though I know some people have complained that he&#39;s scary, or shows up in their nightmares...</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> ...or that they&#39;d wish he&#39;d stop glomming on to the backs of their heads.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Me! I&#39;M \u201Csome people\u201D!</p><hr><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> Hehehe, yes, I suppose you are, aren&#39;t you?</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> Still, you should know that Viy holds you in very high regard, even if he has his own way of showing\u2013</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> It&#39;s freezing.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> If it&#39;s not one thing, it&#39;s another!</p><hr><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> What is this place?<br> It looks like...a prison made out of ice?</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> Well I&#39;ve never seen anywhere like this before. Perhaps the system is \u201Cbugging out,\u201D as they say. All right, shall we make our escape?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Sure, but how can we get this cell door open?</p><hr><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> There we go. Now we can walk right out of here.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> ...Hm? Now why are you looking at me like that? Are you surprised that I would employ such a brutish method?</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> Well in case you need a reminder, I am the Grand Duchess of the holy Romanov Dynasty. Brute force is absolutely in my wheelhouse.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> Now let&#39;s be on our way!</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> Oh my...</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> Now we&#39;re at a party hall?<br> It&#39;s just one surprise after another.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Looks like there&#39;s food for the taking, too...</p><hr><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> Hmm... Well, the flavor is nothing to write home about. And it doesn&#39;t seem to have replenished any of my magical energy.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> Then again, perhaps that&#39;s only to be expected, since we are in a simulation and all... I suppose that makes this no different than eating mist.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> And in that case, does that mean I&#39;ve become a wise parsley, able to live off nothing but the faintest drops of dew?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Parsley? ...Ohhh, are you thinking of \u201Csage\u201D?&#39;Cause if so, that kind of sage isn&#39;t a plant.</p><hr><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> ...I swear, English can be so difficult sometimes.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> Why can&#39;t you all keep things simple and just speak Russian like civilized folk!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> From my perspective, I could say the same to you!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Right back at you, only in reverse!</p><hr><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> ...Fair enough.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> On a different subject, I trust you&#39;re familiar with Jason the hero, yes?</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> And you&#39;re also familiar with the series of horror films starring an antagonist by the same name?</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> Well, can you even imagine our Jason running around with a shaved head and a hockey mask in place of that other Jason?</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> I certainly can&#39;t. The very idea of it gives me a huge case of the giggles.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> I&#39;m sure our Jason wouldn&#39;t be very happy to hear that...</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> ...but the way I see it, if you can&#39;t be free to imagine whatever you like, then where can you be free?</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> ...And on that note, it looks like Viy is doing his best to be considerate.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> What&#39;s that? This is the opposite of being considerate?<br> Yes, you may be right.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> Anyway, I suppose this is still a combat simulation,<br> so I won&#39;t feel too bad about crushing them.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> Let&#39;s go, Master!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> Phew, that&#39;s that.<br> I would say that battle went rather well.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> Your orders were absolutely on point, Master.<br> Now then, shall we take our leave of this place?</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> ...We CAN leave, can&#39;t we?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> It&#39;d be a really big deal if we couldn&#39;t.</p><hr><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> Hehe.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> Well, if we couldn&#39;t, I suppose we&#39;d just have to throw a never-ending party here.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> ...Yes, that might have been the case.<br> Now that I think about it...</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> If we&#39;d been left to our own devices, my family and I might have continued throwing endless parties forever.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> We would have continued to eat, and learn, and grow, without ever growing tired of our day-to-day lives.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> ...All the while oblivious to the people starving to death right beneath our noses.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...I don&#39;t think you can blame yourself for not noticing them.</p><hr><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> ...I suppose you&#39;re right.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> People can only barely keep up with what&#39;s going on around them.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> They&#39;re just not capable of seriously considering the plights of perfect strangers in the rest of the world.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> If there was an exception to that rule...I guess it&#39;d be the person I&#39;m looking at right now.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> ...I take it from your expression that you have mixed feelings about that statement?</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> Yes, I know. It&#39;s very difficult to truly be concerned for others during peaceful, ordinary times.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> But in your case, you still wouldn&#39;t hesitate to help anyone in your field of vision, would you?</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> I&#39;m sure that way of life will bring you more than your share of headaches, but even so, I hope you never lose that spirit, Master.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I&#39;ll do my best.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> Good. That&#39;s all I ask.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> Because I have every faith that your best will be more than enough.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> ...All right.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> There&#39;s no need to think too hard about it.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> Knowing you, I&#39;m sure all you&#39;ll need to do is follow your heart. You can always rationalize your actions later.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> In your case, I think that&#39;s all you&#39;ll need to be satisfied.</p><hr><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> Now then, let&#39;s get out of here, Master.<br> Tomorrow is another day, after all.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> Phew...</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> Say, Viy? Do you think there&#39;s something wrong with me?</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> I might be a Servant now thanks to meeting a creature as strange and mysterious as you...</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> ...but do you think I&#39;m really doing the best I can?<br> ...I am, right?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> ...My chest feels like it&#39;s filled with knives.<br> How can I be sickly, even though I&#39;m a Servant?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>This pain... It&#39;s just like the pain I felt back then, when my family and I were lined up in that basement.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>But, that&#39;s impossible.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>Humanity has been restored.
