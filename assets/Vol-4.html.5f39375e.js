The entirety of my life didn\u2019t even span two decades.</p><p>If I were to condense my life, I would say that it was those last two years, starting from when I left my home village of Domr\xE9my at the age of seventeen, that were everything to me.</p><p>It consisted of one year of glory and one year of abasement and torture.</p><p>Some called me a \u2018girl of miracles\u2019.</p><p>Is this really a miracle, I wonder?</p><p>I took action after hearing God\u2019s laments, and I fought while following my heart in order to take back my homeland.</p><p>Yes, I fought. Even if my duty was merely to wave a flag on the battlefield, it still meant that I had chosen to kill people. In order to save hundreds of my countrymen, I killed thousands of enemies.</p><p>Even if they were enemies, who would have killed me instead if given the chance\u2014murder is still murder.</p><p>I broke the commandment \u2018Thou shalt not kill\u2019. Murder is an act that is cruel beyond imagination.</p><p>Therefore, most humans who have been burdened with the same fate have thought of it as thus:</p><p>\u2018Enemies aren\u2019t human. They are demons, evil fiends who starve for blood, and killing them is just, so we kill them out of contempt. Or we kill out of the belief that it is for the sake of our country, our birthplace, or for those we love.\u2019</p><p>It is a necessary act. A deed that should be blessed.</p><p>Thinking that way, people desperately continue to avert their eyes\u2026 if they don\u2019t, they can\u2019t keep living.</p><p>If they realize that the \u2018strangers\u2019 who face them as enemies are ordinary humans who also love their family and country, and yet continue killing even so, eventually their hearts will break\u2014</p><p>I was foolish, ignorant, and helplessly bad at telling lies.</p><p>That\u2019s why\u2014I thought of my enemies as humans. Demons are scary, evil fiends are terrifying, but I wasn\u2019t scared of humans. There was just a pain inside me that seemed to mince apart my heart.</p><p>Kill people and save people. I believed that there was no method to save my birthplace besides that. I believed, I took an oath, and without repenting, I annihilated the enemy.</p><p>The \u2018history\u2019 of the world is entangled like a spiral. You\u2019re unable to see the start of it no matter how far you go; its form is beyond absurd, and no matter how many thousands of lives are wasted, it doesn\u2019t end, like some kind of comedy.</p><p>You kill because others were killed. You get killed because you killed others. It has to be stopped somehow, but no method to stop it can be found. A spiral that continues on eternally\u2014</p><p>Even so. Even so, I chose the path of killing. This path, though vague and indistinct, leads forward. I know that the blood I spilled will lead on to a new path. I know that it will lead to a path that ends with no one\u2019s blood being spilled.</p><p>\u2026I truly was a complete fool as I moved forward while carrying that pain.</p><p>People called my sinful and bloodstained self a saint. I had to shoulder that title for my entire life\u2014how terrifying.</p><p>If I shouted \u2018That\u2019s wrong\u2019, everything would end. But it wouldn\u2019t be an end of salvation, but merely an act that threw away what I had been burdened with.</p><p>That\u2019s why I continued to shoulder it. I shouldered the people\u2019s hopes and wishes and earnestly pushed forward.</p><p>I understood. I knew from long ago that I would fall into ruin. Did I still continue forward for the sake of my homeland? For their hopes and wishes? Or, or\u2026</p><p>Was it because I thought that I\u2019m a sinner who should be punished?</p><p>What came was not a conclusion that would bring anyone happiness, but a conclusion that was fitting for a war where everyone wounded each other and hated each other.</p><p>Burning at the stake was fitting for someone stained in blood like myself.</p><p>I don\u2019t mind if others sneer at my pitiful figure and heap mockery and abuse on me.</p><p>So I shall pray. Just pray and look at the heavens above. After all, only a foolish and insignificant country girl is dying. An unremarkable event buried within history.</p><p>Thus, I thought. Even now that I\u2019m a [Heroic Spirit] who many people believe in\u2014I am still merely a foolish country girl.</p><p>\u2026Even so, this Holy Grail War is too irregular in all respects.</p><p>This is a unique situation where more than ten Servants have been summoned and where two groups of seven Servants each are fighting each other. And yet, there was an error in the summoning of myself, Jeanne, as Ruler, and I had to enlist the aid of a girl named Laeticia.</p><p>The cause of this was the most irregular factor in the Great Holy Grail War\u2014Amakusa Shirou Tokisada.</p><p>I, who should have originally acted as a mediator, no longer exist to watch over this war, but to settle things with him.</p><p>And there is one other person, who is both the smallest yet greatest irregular factor in this Great Holy Grail War.</p><p>Not even given a name, having received a short life and yet struggling to live even so, he is a homunculus who possesses a jewel-like beauty and a human-like distortion.</p><p>Everything else, including the battle between the fourteen Servants and the existence of the other Ruler, fades away in the face of his peculiarity.</p><p>In the first place, a homunculus is a being manufactured to accomplish a task. Holding no doubts over what they do, they readily obey their master\u2019s orders forever. Moreover, he is a type whose ability to even think is unsteady from birth.</p><p>His type revitalizes prana with their Magic Circuits and supplies it to Servants through a spiritual pipe.</p><p>Both words and thought are unnecessary for them. They are merely allowed to exist. In exchange for that, they are victims from birth who are continuously exploited.</p><p>\u2018He\u2019 escaped from there.</p><p>Trembling in fear, frightened in despair, he wished to live\u2014and crawled out from that prana supply tank.</p><p>He, who should have simply been buried away within the world, became an abnormal existence in that instance. To be able to live\u2014for him, that in itself is already an abnormal ability.</p><p>And in the brief time that he tried to run away with Rider of Black\u2019s aid, his heart was destroyed, and he fell into a state on the verge of death.</p><p>The one who saved him was the famous hero Siegfried from the [Song of the Nibelungs]. Having been summoned as Saber of Black, he gave his own heart to the homunculus.</p><p>\u2026The reason for why he did so is uncertain even now. However, Rider, who witnessed his death, heard him whisper his last words.</p><p>\u2014Yeah, this is a good end.</p><p>Satisfied, Siegfried freely gave out his own life. A homunculus, who shouldn\u2019t even have had a name, received many blessings and managed to survive.</p><p>He had such a bright and promising life ahead of him. He had overcome despair and managed to attain hope.</p><p>And yet, he returned to this side.</p><p>Of course, it was by his own choice. That was an undisputable fact. So, naturally, I should have just viewed and judged him impartially.</p><p>But I couldn\u2019t do that. No matter how I tried, I couldn\u2019t view him that way.</p><p>One girl within me thought that it was love at first sight. That I had been helplessly charmed by the nobility of the path he chose despite its danger.</p><p>\u2026The other girl didn\u2019t think that it was love. She thought that the impulse to protect him was from a revelation that said, it\u2019s necessary.</p><p>Either way, the homunculus who named himself Sieg and I decided to work together\u2014</p><p>Sharing a mutual interest, we ended up fighting together.</p><p>In response to that, half of me rejoiced in love\u2014and the other half of me ached in sin and doubt.</p><p>Why did I choose to work together with him and swear to protect him? Was that truly due to my feelings? Or was it\u2014</p><p>I threw away those thoughts that, on countless occasions, flickered through my mind. Not knowing the answer, I shelved the matter to the side.</p><p>In exchange, I became aware of the feelings that half of me possessed.</p><p>Richly-colored, vivid feelings, so sad it makes me want to cry and so funny it feels ridiculous, are whirling inside my other self.</p><p>Yes. This is surely love. A beautiful heart like a fleeting flower has always been completely beyond my reach\u2014</p><p>\u2026Of course, this is the love not of myself, but of the girl who had accepted me within herself. These overflowing feelings are simply pleasant and lovely.</p><p>That\u2019s why I felt slightly guilty that the one \u2018he\u2019 saw wasn\u2019t her, but me.</p><p>The person you should be looking at is her, not me.</p><p>But, for some reason, when I look at \u2018him\u2019, I somehow forget the guilt I feel.</p><p>\u2026But it\u2019s all right.</p><p>This love won\u2019t end. When I disappear, what will remain are the girl and boy who have a future.</p><p>Just by imagining that scene, I\u2014feel so happy I want to cry.</p><p>\u2014The world is beautiful, someone once said.</p><p>The infinitely changing white clouds, the ultramarine-colored sky, old trees that gave off a sense of holiness, new sprouts filled with bursting vivacity\u2026 Such forms of natural beauty go without saying. But even the great cities where humans continue struggling to live are filled with a man-made beauty that hides their ugliness.</p><p>The world isn\u2019t gentle or easy. Rather, the harshness of just surviving is a natural part of the world. Herbivores are eaten by carnivores, carnivores are defeated by human guns, and humans are defeated by something non-human. Even those non-human things\u2014are defeated by mere humans. The victors eventually become the defeated, and are always faced with the despairing cruelty of the world.</p><p>There is evil. There is good as well. There is also something grey, in which good and evil are indistinct.</p><p>And even so, the world is beautiful.</p><p>Life rejoices at being alive. There is neither beauty nor ugliness in that; there is only earnest sweat and effort. As long as people don\u2019t arrogantly flaunt the fact they exist\u2014in other words, as long as they continue to choose to live.</p><p>The world will surely be eternally beautiful.</p><p>While basking in the fleeting and warm light of twilight.</p><p>Someone thus prayed.</p><p>\u2014The world is ugly, someone once declared.</p><p>Chaos is inevitable in this world. Pure good can\u2019t be achieved, and pure evil breaks down. And these two extremes are always incompatible with each other. There is still some evil in a good world. That is how the world is, and it is what continues to create ugly things. Evil sneers at good, and good rages over evil. But, in a world where good and evil oppose each other, there is a group that is far more numerous that always appears.</p><p>That is \u2018grey\u2019. Neither good nor evil. A group that drifts through life haphazardly and merely exists. They don\u2019t believe in goodness and are simply proud that they aren\u2019t evil. Even though they affirm evil acts, they deny evil intentions. They happily say that \u2018I am not evil, I am a good person\u2019 and pardon all forms of cruelty.</p><p>They kill people while sneering. They kill people out of contempt. They kill people as part of a game. They use the excuse that they can\u2019t restrain their desires\u2014That\u2019s how humans are. That\u2019s how the world is.</p><p>Yes\u2014this world is extremely ugly. Neither dyed by good nor fallen into evil. Unable to decide on a color, the wills of people continue to waver. As long as such evil intentions and such foul-smelling corpses aren\u2019t destroyed.</p><p>The world will surely continue to rot eternally.</p><p>While wrapped within a curse-like fog in darkness frozen to its core.</p><p>Someone thus concluded.</p><h2 id="chapter-1" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#chapter-1" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Chapter 1</h2><hr><p>He was in a trance. He was numb. He was in a state of suspension.</p><p>The film was cut into disconnected pieces, and the scene changed when he blinked.</p><p>He felt intense pain in his chest. A feeling of exhaustion and lethargy gripped his entire body.</p><p>Just what on earth happened? Before thinking about such things, the first thing he had to prioritize was\u2014surviving.</p><p>What he needed in order to survive was medical treatment\u2014he had to close the wound. But intense pain was attacking him every second, and he couldn\u2019t even form a healing spell in his head.</p><p>While groaning in anguish, he moved his hand and touched his chest.</p><p>Bullets had been shot into his heart\u2014every time the organ pumped blood, the lodged bullets sent fresh pain through him. First, he had to remove the bullets agitating his body.</p><p>A healing spell was impossible for him right now. For the time being, he forcefully stimulated his metabolism by forming prana. He had to drag himself up to the point where he could use regular magecraft.</p><p>The harmful fog was also a cause for concern. It was accelerating the deterioration of his physical strength.</p><p>Though he didn\u2019t even have a moment to relax, he felt surprisingly calm. Prana, prana was necessary. He took a deep breath and gathered prana. His lungs might be inflamed, but this wasn\u2019t a situation where he could worry about that.</p><p>For now, he just gathered up prana. He was beset by head-splitting pain, chipping away even the energy to scream.</p><p>More, I need more prana. It\u2019s all right, there\u2019s no problem. This heart has the blood of a dragon flowing within it. So what if I\u2019ve been shot by three bullets? Don\u2019t worry. As if I\u2019d die from something like this\u2014!</p><p>\u201CGuh\u2026!!\u201D</p><p>His heart muscles made a screeching noise as they removed the foreign substance within him. Activating his Magic Circuits, he accelerated the prana circulating through him, and gradually it began to repair his body.</p><p>Somewhere in his heart, a voice asked in doubt, \u2018Isn\u2019t there something strange about this?\u2019</p><p>It was all well and good that Siegfried\u2019s heart was strong.</p><p>And it was all well and good that he had just barely managed to hold onto his fractured consciousness even while suffering through pain as well.</p><p>But\u2014still, even so. This healing ability was too abnormal. This situation was similar to when he was cut down by Saber of Red, though of course, the bullet wounds he had received weren\u2019t even comparable in terms of destructive power.</p><p>However, back then, he had definitely died once even with this heart.</p><p>So why was he not dying this time?</p><p>\u2014Don\u2019t think about it now.</p><p>He breathed in and out again. He gathered and accumulated prana. He had to stand up now. The enemy hadn\u2019t disappeared like magic, and she hadn\u2019t carelessly let her guard down thinking that he was already dead.</p><p>Because, even now, she was gazing at him as he repeatedly breathed and vomited out blood\u2014her gaze cold like that of a snake.</p><hr><p>Screams of agony gushed out from every direction. Due to the fog that had instantly enveloped Trifas, the town had fallen into complete chaos.</p><p>Having donned her armor, Ruler frantically ran after Sieg, who had jumped into the fog without listening to her shouted warning. But his figure had disappeared in a blink of an eye due to the fog obscuring her vision.</p><p>She heard the dry sound of something being struck. It was similar to the sound of cannons she had heard in the past, but softer.</p><p>\u201CA gunshot\u2026!\u201D</p><p>She was certain that Assassin of Black was hiding somewhere within this fog. But right now she was more concerned about Sieg.</p><p>The fog that Assassin of Black had unleashed had no effect on Ruler besides obscuring her vision. She didn\u2019t even receive a rank-down in agility, thanks to her ridiculously high Magic Resistance skill.</p><p>\u201CSieg-kun!?\u201D</p><p>\u201CHelp\u2026 me\u2026\u201D</p><p>The one who responded to her shout was not Sieg, but a young child. Without hesitation, Ruler decided to head towards the child.</p><p>However\u2014Ruler instinctively sensed that Assassin of Black was somewhere nearby. Resolving not to let her guard down, she gripped her flag and searched for the location of that voice.</p><p>Searching through her hazy vision, Ruler immediately found the child. The child was pressing her head against a wall, holding her chest in pain. Her face\u2014wasn\u2019t visible.</p><p>Ruler hesitated slightly. Assassin\u2019s true name was [Jack the Ripper], the name of a serial killer who was once famous in Great Britain, but\u2014</p><p>There was no way Assassin could be such a young girl. But no one knew Jack the Ripper\u2019s face or true identity.</p><p>Perhaps\u2026 Choosing to discard not even the slightest possibility, Ruler touched the girl\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>\u2026Instantly, she was filled with relief. She could tell immediately by touching her. The girl wasn\u2019t a spiritual being like a Servant, but a living human made of flesh and blood.</p><p>\u201CMo\u2026 ther\u2026\u201D</p><p>\u201CDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll bring you to your mother right away.\u201D</p><p>Ruler said that and covered the girl with a holy shroud she summoned forth. If she was wrapped in this cloth which protected those who wore it, she would be safe for the time being.</p><p>Luckily, the girl didn\u2019t seem to be hurt either\u2026</p><p>\u201CEh\u2014\u2014?\u201D</p><p>She didn\u2019t seem to be hurt.</p><p>That was completely impossible. Even if it was somewhat weak, this fog had been harmful enough to make homunculi die or faint within less than ten minutes. Yet why was a normal and weak child like this still alive?</p><p>At worst, it should have instantly killed her, and at best, she shouldn\u2019t have been able to avoid becoming seriously ill.</p><p>\u201CUmm, are you\u2026 okay?\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2026Uh-huh. It doesn\u2019t hurt anymore.\u201D</p><p>The girl replied thus to Ruler\u2019s question. Ruler felt like something was out of place.</p><p>\u201CWhere did it hurt?\u201D</p><p>The girl silently stuck out her leg. On part of her knee, there was a wound of roughly torn skin. A wound from falling over\u2026 was what it obviously wasn\u2019t. And of course, she had no wounds from the fog either.</p><p>This was\u2014a scar from being cut by something. That\u2019s why she had cried out in pain.</p><p>A chill went through Ruler\u2019s entire body. She was struck by a feeling of \u2018killing intent\u2019.</p><p>Moreover.</p><p>It was\u2026</p><p>This killing intent wasn\u2019t half-hearted. It felt like sticky coal tar, a spike that burned so brightly it turned white, or a mutated murderous virus. It was an astoundingly overwhelming malevolence.</p><p>Even worse, this killing intent wasn\u2019t directed at Ruler herself\u2014</p><p>If I run from here, the child will be killed.</p><p>It was directed at the child Ruler was embracing with one arm. Assassin of Black appeared to have overwhelming confidence in his next attack.</p><p>\u201CVery well.\u201D</p><p>Ruler swore that she would protect the girl she was hugging in one arm. No matter what the next attack was, Ruler wouldn\u2019t fall as long as she had this flag.</p><p>If Ruler had made a miscalculation.</p><p>It would be that, in this instant, she concentrated all her senses on Assassin of Black who was going to attack\u2014and viewed the girl she was holding as someone she needed to protect.</p><p>The girl opened her mouth\u2014and put her hand inside it, taking out a scalpel that had been stored in her stomach.</p><hr><p>In order to kill this unidentified female Servant, Assassin of Black had taken all possible measures. Her own Master, Rikudou Reika, had dealt with the boy who seemed to be this Servant\u2019s Master.</p><p>But even so, this Servant hadn\u2019t fallen into a panic, and instead was trying to find and attack Assassin. Most likely, she possessed the skill [Independent Action], or perhaps\u2014the boy hadn\u2019t been her Master in the first place.</p><p>Even so, there was no problem. Without hesitation or mercy, Assassin of Black activated her Noble Phantasm.</p><p>\u201CEverywhere except here is hell. We are flame, rain, and power\u2014\u201D</p><p>The surrounding dimension twisted and a murder began to take place. The victim is a woman. A \u2018woman\u2019 wandering \u2018within the fog\u2019 is cut down at \u2018night\u2019.</p><p>All three of these conditions had been fulfilled. Assassin\u2019s attack was Maria the Ripper: Holy Mother of Dissection. An absolute Noble Phantasm that kills virtually all \u2018females\u2019.</p><p>And now, this Noble Phantasm\u2014a murder\u2014came into existence here.</p><p>Jack the Ripper killed at least five prostitutes\u2014perhaps.</p><p>Jack the Ripper possessed advanced medical knowledge\u2014perhaps.</p><p>Jack the Ripper might have been a man, or might have been a woman.</p><p>Even though the events of history remained the same, the existence of Jack the Ripper himself was merely vague and uncertain.</p><p>No one knew his true identity. No one could figure out his true identity. He might have been a police detective, a private investigator, a poet, a teacher, a doctor, a devilish cutthroat, a psychic, a scientist\u2014or even a god.</p><p>There was only one thing that was known for certain about Jack the Ripper.</p><p>Jack the Ripper kills women.</p><p>The female victim\u2019s abdomen split open. The instant the Noble Phantasm is activated, it ends all possible situations.</p><p>This was neither an attack by a holy sword nor a series of consecutive attacks by a divine spear\u2014it was the reproduction of a murder.</p><p>The victim dies\u2014she is dissected, she has her organs plundered, she loses her blood and, as a result, she dies.</p><p>First, a \u2018murder\u2019 occurs, followed by \u2018death\u2019, and finally, the \u2018reason\u2019 for it is drastically late in catching up; that\u2019s what makes it a truly instantaneous attack. Counterattacking, dodging and resisting are all meaningless.</p><p>Assassin of Black was certain of this.</p><p>She killed her. She definitely killed this Servant. At the same time, she tried to tear out the Servant\u2019s heart.</p><p>A Servant\u2019s prana was enormous. Even more so within their heart or brain where their spiritual core existed. Assassin of Black would devour her soul and gain even more power.</p><p>\u2026If Assassin of Black had made one miscalculation.</p><p>It would be that she viewed this woman as just an ordinary Servant. True, Maria the Ripper was an unequaled Noble Phantasm that delivered instant death in a single blow. All the conditions had been achieved as well\u2014\u2018night\u2019, \u2018within the fog\u2019, and a \u2018woman\u2019.</p><p>But even if one brought about a phenomenon that twisted cause and effect, a foundation, something to serve as the raw material for it, was still needed.</p><p>In this case, Maria the Ripper was, at its essence, a [curse]\u2014the collected grudges of thousands of unborn children. That was the true nature of this fearsome Noble Phantasm.</p><p>Accordingly, in order to counter this Noble Phantasm, what was necessary was neither luck nor endurance, but purely an absolute resistance against curses.</p><p>And the woman she had targeted\u2014Ruler, Jeanne d\u2019Arc, was a saint who unmistakeably had the faith and belief of the world gathered upon her, a Servant with some of the strongest resistance against curses in this world. And what was even more fatal for Assassin of Black\u2026</p><p>\u2026was the holy flag she possessed.</p><hr><p>Rikudou Reika stared at the revolver whose trigger she had pulled. It was an Italian handgun with an extremely narrow gun barrel, known as a \u2018Rhino\u2019. Reika didn\u2019t even know the gun\u2019s name in the first place, though. A Romanian gang that Jack had \u2018eaten\u2019 had possessed a heap of firearms, and she had chosen this one because it was the lightest and smallest among them.</p><p>How strange, she thought. This thing, which was just big enough to fit into the palm of her hand, could steal a person\u2019s life with just the pull of a single finger.</p><p>Wasn\u2019t life something precious and sturdy? At the very least, wasn\u2019t it supposed to be that way? And yet, in the course of just a century, people could die just from getting hit in the brain or heart by tiny lead balls.</p><p>Naturally, even magi weren\u2019t an exception to that.</p><p>She looked down at the corpse\u2014he looked younger than her. But if he was a magus, he might have some kind of rejuvenation spell. However, it was a fact that he had just tried to save her.</p><p>\u201CHow pitiful. Truly, how pitiful.\u201D</p><p>Reika had raided places that magi used as their residences countless times, and had basically grasped their lifestyle. A home expresses the inner nature of the resident. For example, there were many cases where fastidious people had unexpectedly messy rooms. This was an expression of how, though they could pardon their own messiness, they couldn\u2019t pardon the messiness of others.</p><p>The homes of most of the magi had been simple and cold abodes. This most likely signified that they didn\u2019t attach importance to their daily lives as human beings.</p><p>Reika knew of a similar kind of people. Workaholics\u2026 The type of people who simply think of their homes as places to sleep and take baths. Merely a place to rest the bodies of these people who had no hobbies and devoted their entire lives to their work.</p><p>On the other hand, each of the magi had ingeniously devised workshops in their basement or in hidden rooms. Looking at those, Reika felt that she understood the nature of magi. It was in those workshops where their passion came out. Their life was in there. A wish similar to a grudge was in there. And at the same time, there was despair in there.</p><p>Reika had questioned the magi and learned about their way of life. In order to master the mysteries of magecraft, their passed on their blood and accumulated knowledge from generation to generation, and even while knowing their ultimate goal was unreachable\u2014they devoted their entire lives to it.</p><p>To Reika, it seemed like an extremely empty life, but there were certainly such people out there.</p><p>However, this boy was still an obstacle to Reika. She felt no emotion beyond pity. Now then, if things had gone well, both this Master and his Servant should have been taken care of by her and Jack.</p><p>If she trusted Jack\u2019s words, two or three Servants had died on that battlefield a few days ago.</p><p>\u201CThere\u2019s still a long ways to go.\u201D</p><p>Sighing, Reika was about to leisurely walk away through the fog when\u2014</p><p>\u201COh my.\u201D</p><p>She immediately stopped and turned around. Though blood flowed out from his chest and gushed out from his mouth, the boy writhed and struggled on the ground. It appeared he was still alive.</p><p>She should have shot him three times at point-blank in the heart. There was no way a human could survive that.</p><p>But that was the kind of being a magus was. Though surprised at the fact he was alive, Rikudou Reika did not panic. Ah, is that so? she thought, simply accepting the facts.</p><p>In one smooth motion, she switched out the cylinder of the Rhino, threw away the empty shell casings, and reloaded the gun.</p><p>As she did so, her movements were frighteningly calm, possessing not a single bit of confusion or hesitation\u2026 It could only be called abnormal.</p><p>There were humans who could cold-heartedly fire a gun. But there were no humans who could maintain their calm in the face of seeing someone who should have been killed still alive.</p><p>Moreover, Reika was not even a professional, and she had never touched a handgun until she came to Romania. Even so, she could calmly pull the trigger. If it was for the sake of her daughter Jack\u2014she could calmly kill anyone.</p><p>\u201CI wonder if you\u2019ll die if I shoot you in the head?\u201D</p><p>She approached the struggling boy and leveled the gun at him once there was less than a meter of distance between them. I won\u2019t miss like this, Reika thought.</p><p>The boy was still lying face-down, gripping his chest in pain. His breathing was rough and wild, and it seemed he hadn\u2019t even noticed that Reika was pointing her gun at him yet.</p><p>Please properly die this time.</p><p>With that wish in mind, Reika fired the gun.</p><p>The strength from her finger went from the trigger to the firing hammer, the firing hammer hit the detonator, the gunpowder exploded, and the bullet was shot with overwhelming power. It had more than enough energy to destroy a person\u2019s skull. That boy was completely powerless in the face of the bullet flying swiftly towards him.</p><p>No\u2026 he should have been powerless.</p><p>\u201CStra\xDFe \\ gehen.\u201D</p><p>Just when she thought she saw a pale light suddenly shine, the boy swung out his hand as if to protect his head. There was the high-pitched sound of something popping.</p><p>\u201C\u2026Oh my.\u201D</p><p>The bullet that should have pierced through the crown of his head had disappeared somewhere. To be precise, it hadn\u2019t disappeared, but been smashed to pieces.</p><p>Without hesitation, Reika pulled the trigger once more\u2014and the boy repeated the same words as before, with the bullet vanishing at the same time as he struck it with his palm.</p><p>\u201CThis is\u2026 no good, huh?\u201D</p><p>The boy\u2019s breathing was starting to gradually settle down. He was still kneeling on the ground as if prostrating himself, but he raised his body up with his left arm and took a firm step with his right foot. He seemed to be receiving damage due to being within the fog, but\u2014it didn\u2019t seem to be any significant obstacle to him.</p><p>\u201CSo you\u2019re Assassin of Black\u2019s Master?\u201D</p><p>The boy asked that in a low voice.</p><p>Now then, what to do\u2014while pondering her option, Reika retreated a step back.</p><hr><p>Though only slightly, blood flowed out from the nape of Ruler\u2019s neck. The vacant-eyed girl had stabbed her with a scalpel. There was little strength in the attack, and the scalpel itself didn\u2019t have much prana loaded within it either. But the girl\u2019s arm had changed to the color of black, to the point that it was painful to look at.</p><p>Spiritual possession\u2014possession by a low-level spirit was a common phenomenon. Dispersing the spirit wasn\u2019t very difficult either. Normally, Ruler would have been able to easily deal with her attack, even if it was a surprise attack.</p><p>But on top of embracing the aforementioned girl in her arm, Ruler had concentrated all her senses on the attacking Assassin of Black.</p><p>Her thoughts halted for a slight instant at this extremely unexpected attack. That temporary halt in her thoughts was precisely what Assassin of Black had aimed for\u2014</p><p>Here it comes\u2026!</p><p>Here I go\u2026!</p><p>Assassin of Black\u2014activated her Noble Phantasm, Maria the Ripper: Holy Mother of Dissection.</p><p>Ruler\u2014activated her Noble Phantasm, Luminosit\xE9 Eternelle: God is Here With Me.</p><p>All of Jack the Ripper\u2019s preparations were complete. She had prepared a situation where she could use her Noble Phantasm to maximum effect, and had perfectly made a surprise attack by using a decoy.</p><p>Therefore, Assassin was one step faster.</p><p>Ruler\u2019s Noble Phantasm was slightly late in activating.</p><p>But, even so, that grudge did not reach Ruler.</p><p>The rushing black grudge tried to possess Ruler, and at the same time tried to split open her abdomen\u2014but Ruler\u2019s Noble Phantasm activated immediately before it could.</p><p>\u201CKuh\u2026!!\u201D</p><p>An intense shock ran through the holy flag. As expected, it couldn\u2019t absorb all of the curse and the damage, and numbness ran through her entire body. Different from Berserker of Red\u2019s attack, which was a simple torrent of energy, this was a curse-type Noble Phantasm that followed some form of rules.</p><p>It was something that could easily kill and dissolve a normal Servant.</p><p>Ruler cried out in anguish and spat out black-dyed blood. But she didn\u2019t bend even a single knee, and somehow managed to hold her ground there.</p><p>\u201CWha\u2014\u2014\u2014!?\u201D</p><p>The one who shouted in astonishment was Assassin of Black, who had just landed on the ground. She had definitely activated her certain-death Noble Phantasm under perfect conditions. And yet it hadn\u2019t even dealt a fatal wound.</p><p>\u201CSo you\u2019re\u2026 a user of evil spirits, Assassin of Black.\u201D</p><p>Ruler pinned down the struggling young girl with one hand, and after she touched her forehead, the girl fainted. Ruler then sprinkled holy water from her pocket over her and quickly exorcised the spirit within her. Her blackened arm soon returned to normal\u2014and her atrocious appearance changed to that of a gentle young girl.</p><p>\u201CWhy\u2026 aren\u2019t you dead?\u201D</p><p>Assassin\u2019s voice was somehow strange. It was rough and mixed together with odd noise, as if several people were saying the same words at the same time.</p><p>Most shocking of all was that she looked just like a very young girl. For a young girl to be a Servant was unusual enough, but for her to be the serial killer Jack the Ripper who once terrorized Greater Britain was far beyond Ruler\u2019s expectations.</p><p>Without revealing the surprise she felt within, Ruler replied to Assassin\u2019s question.</p><p>\u201CUnfortunately, I possess something with a resistance against curses.\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2026That flag, huh?\u201D</p><p>Assassin of Black nodded in understanding. That flag had absorbed Assassin of Black\u2019s attack like a lightning rod. Her preparations hadn\u2019t been meaningless; the evil spirit she had put into the child that she had kidnapped within the town had borne fruit, making Ruler\u2019s Noble Phantasm slightly delayed in its activation.</p><p>As a result, the curse had definitely adversely affected the Servant before her eyes\u2014but she was still alive.</p><p>\u201C\u2026Onee-san, is your class Lancer? \u2026No. The number of Servants wouldn\u2019t match in that case. Saber, then?\u201D</p><p>\u201CNo, neither. I am Ruler, the mediator of the Great Holy Grail War.\u201D</p><p>Assassin of Black\u2019s eyes widened.</p><p>\u201CHeeh. Ruler\u2026 so there was such a class as well. I didn\u2019t know,\u201D Assassin murmured.</p><p>Ruler glanced at the girl that had fainted. If she had remained possessed by that evil spirit, even her soul would have been contaminated and she would have turned into the living dead.</p><p>Ruler thrust her holy flag forward. As if pressured by her gallantness, Assassin took a step back.</p><p>\u201CAssassin. The Holy Grail War should consist of only seven Masters and Servants competing over the Holy Grail. Your behavior in dragging an innocent child into this is the worst possible offence. I won\u2019t let you get away.\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2026Hmm. Is that so?\u201D</p><p>Ruler\u2019s words seemed to touch upon something within Assassin of Black. She looked at the sleeping girl, and then suddenly threw a scalpel at her.</p><p>Ruler repelled it with her flag\u2014but she felt something was off. There was no meaning in that attack. Ruler could only think that it was an outburst of anger. No, if it wasn\u2019t an outburst of anger, then\u2014</p><p>\u201CAssassin\u2026 it couldn\u2019t be\u2026\u201D</p><p>\u201CChildren are a dime a dozen. If you still want to protect her\u2026 then good luck with that.\u201D</p><p>Holding eight scalpels between her fingers\u2014Assassin smiled faintly.</p><hr><p>From the rooftop of Trifas City Hall, Archer of Red watched the disastrous scene below with a dumbfounded expression.</p><p>\u201CThis is\u2014\u201D</p><p>Fog covered Trifas. Even if it was a small town, it was insane for the entire town to be covered by fog. All the traffic on the streets and sidewalks always died out immediately once it turned nighttime these days, but since the sun had only just set, many people who were in the midst of returning home should have been engulfed within the fog.</p><p>In reality, screams were rising from all over the town. At first people were confused, then they shrieked, and after screaming, they begged for help with hoarse voices.</p><p>\u2026There was nothing she could do.</p><p>\u2026And most of all, she didn\u2019t intend to do anything about it either.</p><p>\u201CYou were all unlucky.\u201D</p><p>Archer of Red coldly muttered that. The inhabitants here should have already noticed the abnormalities occurring in this town. They were the ones who decided to go walking at night in this situation.</p><p>Assassin of Black was certainly involved with the specific manner of their deaths, but the responsibility of their death lay with themselves, and most of all\u2014they were just fatally unlucky.</p><p>\u2026It was a common occurrence. The weak are devoured by the strong due to bad luck, and even the strong were brought to an end by \u2018something else\u2019. Therefore, Archer of Red had no intention of saving them.</p><p>Her vision was completely blocked by the fog, but if she used her sense of hearing and ability to sense the presence of other Servants, she could roughly grasp the location of each Servant. As expected, Assassin of Black was the only one whose presence was vague and hard to grasp, but Ruler was easy to detect. She was a vortex of light that shined purely and honestly no matter how dark the night was.</p><p>Archer of Red could tell that Rider and Archer of Black were searching for her, but they didn\u2019t seem to be able to detect her presence yet. Most likely, Ruler was the only one who could sense her.</p><p>But Ruler was sprinting through the fog right now. She was fighting Assassin of Black. In other words, she didn\u2019t have the time to concentrate on Archer of Red.</p><p>\u201CEven so\u2026 to think that she\u2019s unable to take down Assassin.\u201D</p><p>Archer of Red tilted her head in puzzlement. Assassin, just as the name indicated, was the class of \u2018assassination\u2019. To them, facing the enemy head-on was the height of foolishness.</p><p>For her not to be able to take down Assassin one-on-one, it meant that either Ruler was a very weak and puny Servant, or that this fog gave Assassin a tremendous advantage\u2014</p><p>Either way, the time had come for Archer of Red to make a decision on how to act.</p><p>Should she throw herself into the fog, or continue waiting and watching like this?</p><p>Watching from the sidelines was a valid tactic, but there was one problem\u2026 Since earlier, Rider of Black had been actively doing reconnaissance from the sky. Archer was confident that the swiftness of her feet wouldn\u2019t lose to even Rider of Red, but even so, she wanted to at least avoid being pursued by a hippogriff.</p><p>A flying Phantasmal Beast born from a griffin and a horse. No matter how much she sprinted across the earth, that thing could easily catch up with her from the sky.</p><p>If there was any merit in boldly jumping into the fog, it was that a chance to kill Ruler might appear. Archer of Red had decided to acknowledge Shirou Kotomine as her Master. She didn\u2019t know if his \u2018method\u2019 was truly right. But there was definitely truth in his words.</p><p>She wanted to believe it. Archer of Red had a wish that she prioritized above everything else.</p><p>The salvation of all young children in the world. A world where they are all loved\u2014where they are all happy, without a single exception. The malice in the world said that such a thing was impossible. Everyone devours each other; that was how the world worked. Even Archer of Red understood that.</p><p>Even so. Even so, she couldn\u2019t help but wish for it\u2026 After all, Atalanta herself was abandoned on a mountain immediately after she was born.</p><p>\u201CA woman is unnecessary.\u201D</p><p>Her father had said that and abandoned her on a mountain. The moon goddess Artemis had seen this and thought it pitiful, so she decided to send a female bear to raise her.</p><p>Protected by the bear, Atalanta grew up on the mountain.</p><p>Many other babies besides her were abandoned on that mountain. Most of those infants died due to either being devoured by beasts or starving to death. Even if they survived by chance, their thought processes were exactly the same as a beast\u2019s. Separated from the world, they lived meaningless lives and died meaningless deaths.</p><p>Thanks to being raised by the female bear, Atalanta\u2019s life was rescued, and eventually she was found by a hunter.</p><p>\u2026She remembered.</p><p>She remembered quite well the moment when she was abandoned. As an infant, she had noisily flapped her hands and desperately sought her father and mother\u2014but her mother wasn\u2019t there, and her father had abandoned her.</p><p>She remembered wanting to be saved. She remembered wanted for someone to grasp her hand.</p><p>She remembered that her wish wasn\u2019t granted, and how she had drowned in a sea of fear\u2014and how she had held out her hands while sobbing.</p><p>The wound in her heart from being abandoned never healed.</p><p>Even after growing up beautifully and becoming a famous archer\u2014she continued to maintain her solitude.</p><p>She had friends. She had comrades with whom she rode the Argo alongside and went through many adventures. But she never found a human she could love to the point of risking her life and didn\u2019t think to have a child either.</p><p>She felt that way even more after the competition and struggle over her during the Calydonian Hunt.</p><p>But\u2014most likely because of her fame that arose from her adventures, Atalanta\u2019s beauty became known by many people, and in the end reached the ears of her father as well.</p><p>\u201CAnyone is fine. Take a husband and bear a child.\u201D</p><p>To her father, his reunion with Atalanta was a joyous event. But that was only because she had grown up to be beautiful and could be used as marriage material.</p><p>\u2026Ultimately, the father never loved his daughter, from beginning to end.</p><p>After that, she tried to run away from the marriage once she learned the conditions for it, but she was caught in a scheme and ended up marrying Hippomenes.</p><p>\u2014She just wanted to be loved.</p><p>She wanted to know true love with no strings attached to carnal desire, honor or lust for power.</p><p>It would have been better if she could believe that there was no such thing as love. If she could think that this world was hell, that this was a damned world where parents devour their children and children devour their parents\u2014how much better would have been?</p><p>But that was incorrect.</p><p>There were parents who love their children in the world. It was a free, wonderful love. There were parents who gave up their lives for the sake of their children. There were parents who worked hard their entire lives for the sake of their children and still smiled.</p><p>On the other hand, there were parents who oppressed their children. There were parents who treated the children they had given life to like trash.</p><p>That\u2019s wrong, Atalanta thought.</p><p>That must be corrected, Atalanta thought.</p><p>Even though she understood it was a natural part of the world\u2019s cruelty, she still wished for it to be changed.</p><p>The reason she was participating in the Holy Grail War was because she had the faint hope that the Holy Grail would be able to grant her wish.</p><p>It was a wish that Assassin of Red had called \u201Cimpossible\u201D.</p><p>Archer herself also understood that. She thought that it might be a wish that surpassed the ability of the Holy Grail.</p><p>But Shirou Kotomine had showed her a way. That boy had showed her hope. A method to save the world, to save all children using the Holy Grail.</p><p>In that case, she would eliminate even Ruler if she became an obstruction.</p><p>She was fully aware of the danger in jumping into the fog. She was fully aware, but\u2014</p><p>\u201CIf it\u2019s for the sake of those children, I have no regrets.\u201D</p><p>Archer of Red leaped from the rooftop of city hall and jumped into the fog.</p><hr><p>He was wracked by intense pain every time he breathed. An ugly scar was spread across his blood-stained chest, a mark from the shots that had hit him. Three bullets had gouged through his chest muscles and reached his heart. If they had been shot at his forehead, he would have certainly died.</p><p>But that didn\u2019t mean that he had escaped from death\u2019s door\u2014in fact, there was a gun pointed at Sieg right now.</p><p>It would be over for him if he was shot in the head. And the mother in front of him was replacing the gun\u2019s bullets with a single smooth hand motion. Her movements were extremely calm, showing no signs of panic. She\u2019s used to killing\u2026 Sieg surmised.</p><p>In only a few seconds, this woman was going to shoot him in the head.</p><p>I won\u2019t let her. Activate Magic Circuits\u2014concentrate prana in palm\u2014acquire information on lodged bullets\u2014leave thinking about whether or not it\u2019s possible to swing my arm at the same velocity as the bullet and crush it in the instant they touch for later\u2014chant the spell\u2014!</p><p>\u201COooooooooh!\u201D</p><p>The gun fired.</p><p>Two bullets were fired, and he repelled each one.</p><p>His right arm grated\u2026 Abnormalities had definitely formed within the bones. Enduring it, he gritted his teeth and glared.</p><p>The mother who sought help. The mother who laughed along with her daughter. Who are you?</p><p>A Master, or perhaps someone else? Either way, she wasn\u2019t an innocent person who could be left alone. But, in complete opposite to Sieg\u2019s determination to fight, the woman didn\u2019t pull the trigger any further, and instead suddenly dropped her coat and began running away.</p><p>\u201CWa\u2026 Wait!\u201D</p><p>Caught by surprise by her attempt to escape, Sieg frantically chased after her. But then a terrible clanging sound cut in between them. Immediately after, two figures leapt out before him.</p><p>One was Ruler, and the other was a slender young girl wearing a leather bondage suit. Ruler was running fiercely enough to crush the pavement beneath her and held a human girl in one arm. The other girl climbed up and clung to the wall of a building with clearly inhuman speed.</p><p>\u201CSieg-kun!?\u201D</p><p>\u201CAh\u2026!\u201D</p><p>The girl looked at Sieg\u2019s face and slightly widened her eyes, leaking out a gasp of surprise.</p><p>Ruler immediately swung her flag\u2014and the high-pitched clang of steel rang out. A crushed scalpel was knocked to the ground.</p><p>It appeared the girl had thrown a scalpel at Sieg and Ruler had knocked it away.</p><p>\u201C\u2026You aren\u2019t dead. What a shock.\u201D</p><p>\u201CAssassin\u2026 you seem to have a score to settle with him, but I\u2019m your opponent right now.\u201D</p><p>Apparently, that girl was Assassin of Black\u2014in other words, Jack the Ripper.</p><p>\u201CWhat a bad joke.\u201D</p><p>In response to Sieg\u2019s murmur, Ruler sighed in agreement. She still held the unconscious little girl in her arms.</p><p>\u201CShe\u2019s\u2014the daughter of that mother, if I remember right.\u201D</p><p>\u201CYes. More importantly, Sieg-kun, did you find her mother?\u201D</p><p>Ruler questioned him while holding her flag ready and cautiously watching Assassin. Assassin was still clinging to the wall, unmoving as she held two scalpels ready. Like a spider, Sieg thought.</p><p>\u201C\u2026It appears the mother is Assassin\u2019s Master.\u201D</p><p>\u201CEh? How do you know?\u201D</p><p>Sieg silently placed a hand on his chest to display the blood clinging to him.</p><p>\u201CShe shot me.\u201D</p><p>\u201CI see, she shot you\u2026 A-A-A-Are you all right, Sieg-kun!?\u201D</p><p>In actual fact, bullets had been shot into his heart, so he was far from all right\u2014but he currently felt no significant pain or hindrance to his movements.</p><p>\u201CI\u2019m fine. More importantly, Ruler. I\u2019ll chase after the Master, in order to bring down Assassin of Black here as well.\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2026No. It might be better if you let her go.\u201D</p><p>As she said that, Ruler instantly swung her flag\u2014and before Sieg could ask why, a jarring metallic sound rang through the area. And then, the shards of a broken scalpel were scattered on the ground near Sieg.</p><p>\u201CI won\u2019t let you lay a hand on Mother.\u201D</p><p>There was clear killing intent within Assassin\u2019s otherwise exceptionally impassive expression. I see. Sieg immediately understood. If he moved away from Ruler, Assassin would definitely attack him.</p><p>Naturally, Ruler would act to defend him, but Assassin rivaled proper Heroic Spirits like the Knight classes or the Rider class when it came to swiftness. In the worst case, if she managed to circumvent Ruler, Assassin would easily kill Sieg.</p><p>\u201CSorry. It seems I\u2019ve become a burden.\u201D</p><p>\u201CIt\u2019s fine\u2026 It\u2019s all right, Sieg-kun. There\u2019s no need for you to transform. If we wait just a little longer, reinforcements will arrive.\u201D</p><p>Reinforcements.</p><p>\u2026I see. Sieg decided to maintain a wait-and-see stance. Sieg had resolved to transform into Saber should it come to a fight earlier, but he decided to call it off. If he transformed, Ruler\u2019s good will would be brought to naught. Preventing that was very important to Sieg.</p><p>Sieg weaved prana and then took out the slender sword from the scabbard that now hung from his waist. It was the sword that Rider of Black had given him before. It was the weapon of a Servant, a spiritual being, so normally, only Rider could materialize it by weaving it out of prana.</p><p>But, most likely because it had been loaned to him by Rider\u2019s own will and Sieg himself had become something exceedingly close to a Servant, he was able to materialize it in the physical world using the same trick he used to activate his Magic Circuits.</p><p>\u201CWe wouldn\u2019t do that if we were you, you know?\u201D</p><p>Giving a small smile, Assassin of Black whistled. The sound of pitter-pattering footsteps resounded around them\u2014and then Ruler\u2019s face turned pale.</p><p>\u201CAssassin, you wouldn\u2019t\u2026!\u201D</p><p>Hearing Ruler\u2019s tense voice, Sieg also became on guard and observed their surroundings. From within the fog, the faint forms of countless children holding scalpels in their hands appeared. Some of them were slightly familiar\u2014among them, there were also children who he had seen playing earlier during the day.</p><p>They wore open-mouthed and empty expressions, their entire bodies convulsing in spasms, and their arms holding the scalpels were turning black\u2026 Assassin of Black was an aggregation of vengeful spirits. Those spirits appeared to have possessed these children. The separated vengeful spirits were weak enough on their own that a saint like Ruler could easily dissipate them by reciting holy scripture, but Assassin wasn\u2019t using them as soldiers, but rather as mobile hostages. Since Ruler was a saint, she had to protect the children\u2026 or so Assassin had judged.</p><p>\u201CHmm, then Ruler, and also the, umm\u2026 Master over there? Try protecting every single one of them.\u201D</p><p>\u201CSieg-kun!\u201D</p><p>No need to even ask, Sieg thought as he moved. He repelled the thrown scalpels and at the same time knocked down the children who rushed at him. The children weren\u2019t attacking by their own will, but rather that of the vengeful spirits that possessed them. They were unconscious from the start, so making them faint was useless, and he could only buy time by knocking them down.</p><p>But as he desperately pinned down each child, Assassin\u2019s scalpels came flying. Moreover, they were aimed mercilessly and incessantly at the children.</p><p>\u201CKuh\u2026!\u201D</p><p>A thrown scalpel stabbed into Sieg\u2019s left arm. Defending against scalpels without knowing when they would come flying while also dealing with the attacking children was, as expected, beyond Sieg\u2019s capabilities.</p><p>Though Ruler was able to dispose of the scalpels, she was forced to take a step back for every one she took forward, preventing her from getting near Assassin. If Ruler carelessly approached, Assassin would easily rain scalpels down on the children.</p><p>For an instant, Ruler thought about using a Command Spell, but the female Master who had run away was a problem. Based on Assassin\u2019s behavior, her relationship with her Master was closer to that of a mother and daughter rather than Master and Servant, and as such they probably wouldn\u2019t be stingy about using a Command Spell depending on the situation. It was likely that any order that Ruler gave for Assassin to commit suicide or hinder her would be immediately canceled out by her Master\u2019s Command Spells.</p><p>The situation was in a complete stalemate, but Sieg\u2019s exhaustion was steadily increasing. It was a battle of time. Either Rider would plunge into the fog, find them and join the battle first, or Assassin would kill Sieg before then.</p><p>Even if defeating Ruler was impossible, Assassin determined that killing Sieg would be easy. A surprise attack was already impossible in this situation, but even so, she could easily strike at his openings.</p><p>Assassin threw down a rain of scalpels and began driving Ruler and Sieg apart, though the pivot of her plan merely required that she drive Sieg far enough away that Ruler couldn\u2019t reach him in a single jump.</p><p>She controlled the children with her vengeful spirits and gradually separated Ruler and Sieg. Even as she threw her scalpels, Assassin moved to a location from which she could kill Sieg with a single strike.</p><p>Ruler purified the vengeful spirits possessing the children one by one.</p><p>But the children were many, and most of all, their value as hostages remained even with the vengeful spirits dissipated. It made protecting them easier, but that was all.</p><p>In the midst of that, Ruler realized.</p><p>\u201CSieg-kun! Get back over here!\u201D</p><p>Hearing Ruler\u2019s shout, Sieg also finally noticed it. He and Ruler had become completely separated by the attacking children between them.</p><p>Even if Ruler tried to protect Sieg from Assassin\u2019s attack, with over a dozen children acting as a wall and blocking her way, she would be unable to protect Sieg for the span of an instant.</p><p>\u201CToo slow\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014!\u201D</p><p>Assassin jumped off the wall and charged at Sieg. She held a butcher\u2019s knife in each hand, and moved to cleave off Sieg\u2019s head with them.</p><p>Her absolute confidence in victory.</p><p>The despairing sound of his defeat.</p><p>But there was something even swifter than Sieg\u2019s decision to transform or Assassin\u2019s motion to cut off Sieg\u2019s head.</p><p>An arrow shot by the god-tier bowman\u2014Archer of Black\u2014tore through the fog enwrapping the town like a ferocious shark.</p><p>It was too late by the time Assassin noticed it. The arrow, filled with prana, exploded like a cannon shot. It was strong enough for the aftershock to blow away Sieg too and send him tumbling across the ground. Assassin, who was directly hit by it, had part of her body blown off.</p><p>\u201CUgh, guuuuuuh\u2026!!\u201D</p><p>Howling in anguish, Assassin still managed to jump away. She leapt from building to building and tried to escape somewhere safe.</p><p>\u201C\u2014You\u2019re not getting away!\u201D</p><p>Ruler dashed towards her with the speed of a shooting star.</p><p>Because Assassin was concentrating on running away, the movements of the possessed children became dull, and having noticed that, Ruler dashed across the surface of a building\u2019s wall and brandished her holy flag at Assassin of Black.</p><p>Assassin tried to directly block the attack with the butcher\u2019s knives in her hands, but the holy flag didn\u2019t have a sharp edge like a blade. It was a weapon that blocked attacks and knocked down the enemy with its steel pole.</p><p>Furthermore, Jeanne d\u2019Arc\u2019s flag was a holy treasure that had always accompanied her on the battlefield and was treated as a symbol even now.</p><p>Jack the Ripper\u2019s knives were symbols of fear\u2014but still, there was no way they could win against a holy flag that had won great fame on the battlefield.</p><p>Assassin of Black fell. With a strike strong enough to make a crater in stone pavement, she was rendered pretty much incapable of any further fighting.</p><p>The sorrow of the Assassin class was that she didn\u2019t have the endurance to trade direct blows with those of the three Knight classes or the Ruler class.</p><p>\u201CGuh\u2026 uu, uuu, uuuuuuugh\u2026!\u201D</p><p>Even so, Assassin of Black continued moving and tried to escape. Ruler glanced at Sieg. The possessed children were all falling to the ground as if their souls had come out.</p><p>Ruler guessed that Assassin of Black\u2019s injuries were probably the cause. There was no error in her conclusion. Assassin of Black had weakened to the point that she had to call back and gather together the vengeful spirits possessing the children.</p><p>Even the fog created by her Noble Phantasm was gradually clearing away.</p><p>\u201CMo\u2026 ther\u2026 Mother, Mother\u2026!\u201D</p><p>While fallen to her hands and knees and trying to run away using only her arms, Assassin of Black called for her mother. Ruler couldn\u2019t help but feel pity for her.</p><p>If someone asked whether Assassin was a perpetrator or victim, she was unmistakably a perpetrator. But most likely, her origins had begun from being a victim.</p><p>Looking at her form and hearing her voice, Ruler came to such a conclusion.</p><p>And\u2014even so, she was evil. If left alone, the phenomenon known as Jack the Ripper would probably swell and grow until it could no longer be crammed into the frame of a Servant.</p><p>She was a unique, abnormal monster that existed outside conventional boundaries.</p><p>Ruler cut in front of the crawling Assassin of Black and placed a hand on her face in order to sublimate her with a Baptism Rite.</p><p>\u201CThe Lord forgives all injustice and forgives all calamities. And he frees your life from the grave, feeling love and compassion\u2014\u201D</p><p>Perhaps sensing something, Assassin\u2019s ice-blue eyes widened in fear.</p><p>\u201CNo\u2026\u201D</p><p>Without responding to Assassin\u2019s words, Ruler commenced chanting.</p><p>\u201CNo\u2026 no\u2026 no, no, no\u2026! Stop it! Stop, stop, stop! Mother\u2026! Save me, Mother\u2026!\u201D</p><p>Ruler gritted her teeth and continued the chant, but suddenly sensed a massive outpouring of prana.</p><p>\u201CThis is\u2014a Command Spell!?\u201D</p><p>\u201CMotheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeer!\u201D</p><p>Instantly, Assassin of Black disappeared. The Master had mostly likely sensed that her Servant was in danger and used a Command Spell. Just as Ruler thought, she appeared to be watching Assassin\u2019s condition from somewhere. Her lack of effort to hide their murders might have disqualified her as a magus, but it seemed she firmly understood the system under which the Holy Grail War functioned.</p><p>Ruler faintly sensed traces of Assassin of Black\u2019s presence. She was mostly likely still somewhere in this town. Now that the fog had cleared away, searching for her would be easy. They couldn\u2019t allow her to slip away here.</p><p>\u201CLet\u2019s chase after her, Sieg-kun!\u201D</p><p>Sieg nodded and began running after Ruler\u2019s wake.</p><hr><p>Rikudou Reika used the Command Spell because the fog had cleared away. The fog dissipating meant that Jack\u2019s power had considerably weakened. It was easy for Reika to imagine that she had fallen into a dangerous situation.</p><p>\u201CMo\u2026 ther\u2026\u201D</p><p>As Assassin of Black cowered in pain, Reika quickly lifted her up. Though she was a Servant, her weight was the same as that of a young girl. Assassin was extremely light, so much that it made Reika wonder if she was completely empty inside.</p><p>\u201CSorry\u2026\u201D</p><p>\u201CDon\u2019t talk. Now, go to sleep.\u201D</p><p>Reika began walking hurriedly as she spoke. They had to withdraw from here. Luckily, their hideout was nearby.</p><p>\u201CMother\u2026 what should we do next\u2026?\u201D</p><p>\u201CLet\u2019s think about it after you\u2019ve healed your injuries. For now, you should rest.\u201D</p><p>While saying that, Reika kept thinking. They wanted to obtain the Holy Grail, and those people they had fought were an obstacle to that, but eliminating them would be even more difficulty after this. Perhaps the two of them should give thought to a drawn-out war and withdraw from Trifas.</p><p>Fortunately, there would be no trouble obtaining information as long as there were magi around. No matter where in the world the Holy Grail was, they should definitely be able to track it.</p><p>\u201C\u2026Hey, hey, Mother. I want to hear, the piano, again\u2026\u201D</p><p>Hearing that childish request suddenly come from Jack\u2019s mouth, Reika giggled. Though she was in pain, Jack whined charmingly while smiling.</p><p>\u201CAll right, I will.\u201D</p><p>Prioritizing Jack\u2019s words was more important than thinking of a battle plan to Reika right now.</p><p>Seeing Jack smile despite the pain made Reika feel relieved. The fog had literally vanished like mist. If they didn\u2019t hurry, they might be found again\u2014</p><p>Reika was hurrying down a narrow street only wide enough for a single car to pass through. There were people collapsed on the ground here and there, but she ignored every single one of them. Her heart felt nothing for them, merely discarding them with the thought \u2018They were unlucky\u2019. Right now, giving her daughter in her arms the chance to rest was prioritized over everything else for her.</p><p>One of the street lamps, which had just come back on, illuminated the glass window of a shop she happened to be passing by.</p><p>By the chance, the reflection of the light showed that to Reika. A human form, wearing strange clothes that clearly looked like those of someone from an entirely different era. And that person had nocked an arrow on a bow and was aiming it in her direction\u2014it was unmistakably an enemy, and the target of the arrow was Reika and Jack in her arms.</p><p>She was forced to choose. At this rate, that arrow would definitely pierce through both her and Jack. She didn\u2019t know about Jack, but she at least would experience near instant death. Relying on luck was useless here.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t escape, and fighting would be difficult as well. There was no way the enemy would show mercy.</p><p>In other words, she had no means of stopping it. Therefore, there was no meaning in what she was about to do now</p><p>\u201C\u2026Yeah, it can\u2019t be helped.\u201D</p><p>There truly was no meaning in doing it. But I have to do it, thought Rikudou Reika.</p><p>Any further thought ended at exactly that instant for her.</p><p>Reika suddenly spun around and released Jack from her arms. Naturally, Jack fell on her back onto the stone pavement. Having suddenly been thrown away, Jack looked at Reika with a dumbfounded expression\u2014and froze.</p><p>\u201CMo, ther\u2026?\u201D</p><p>She felt sharp pain for an instant, but even so, Reika managed to understand instinctively.</p><p>I can\u2019t be saved.</p><p>\u2014From the beginning, it was a battle with slim chances of victory. Since the Assassin class itself only showed its true worth in a battle royal, Jack was unable to fight fair and square no matter how much she struggled.</p><p>Killing the Masters was also difficult considering how they were holed up in the fortress. Furthermore, her Master Reika wasn\u2019t a magus and couldn\u2019t supply prana, the source of a Servant\u2019s power.</p><p>That\u2019s why, from the start, they were at an overwhelming disadvantage. If Reika knew who was managing this whole affair, she would have seriously lodged a complaint against them.</p><p>But Reika hadn\u2019t minded at all.</p><p>She didn\u2019t mind killing people. She had killed both the sinful and the innocent alike, but she still didn\u2019t worry herself over it\u2014she felt some pity for the victims, but that was all.</p><p>There were only two important points for her.</p><p>Jack the Ripper had saved Rikudou Reika. She had granted Reika\u2019s wish to live.</p><p>And, though it was only for a short time, she had enjoyed the days she spent with Jack more than anything else in her entire life.</p><p>No matter how bloody, no matter how cruel Jack was\u2014</p><p>Rikudou Reika had enjoyed being with her from the bottom of her heart.</p><p>\u2014Mother.</p><p>A little girl had called her that with an innocent voice. No matter what her true identity was, Reika didn\u2019t care. Just that alone made her happy. Just that alone made those days together so wonderful.</p><p>The happy dream ended.</p><p>She had a mountain of regrets\u2014but there was no use regretting.</p><p>It was a happy dream.</p><p>While her thoughts were still clear, Reika murmured that in her mind.</p><p>As she fell to the ground face-up, Jack frantically approached her.</p><p>\u201CMother\u2026!!\u201D</p><p>Reika put a hand on Jack\u2019s cheek\u2014she had enough time and strength left to do that at least. She smiled\u2014she somehow managed to do that much. As for final words\u2014that was pointless. There was something more important she needed to say right now.</p><p>She had two things to say.</p><p>\u201CI order you with two Command Spells. [Even if I\u2019m not here anymore], [you\u2019ll be fine]\u2026 Jack.\u201D</p><p>It was useless to keep these Command Spells at this point.</p><p>She used up her remaining two and tried to boost Jack\u2019s chances of survival even a little. As always, she didn\u2019t understand magecraft very well.</p><p>She didn\u2019t understand it, so she used it as a stand-in for a good luck charm. Like how a mother reassures her fearful daughter, Reika used her remaining Command Spells.</p><p>\u201CNo, don\u2019t go, don\u2019t go, Mother! No, no, no\u2026!\u201D</p><p>You\u2019re a smart daughter, thought Reika.</p><p>She was losing consciousness and drifting away from the world\u2014she closed her eyes. Her hearing was faltering, and she couldn\u2019t even squeeze back the hand that held hers.</p><p>She could no long feel or even think anything.</p><p>At that moment, Rikudou Reika merely wore an expression that somehow seemed to fit the situation\u2026 a smile.</p><hr><p>Archer of Red shot down Assassin of Black\u2019s Master. Even if she had left them alone, it wouldn\u2019t have been a problem. Rather, it would have been better for Archer\u2019s side if Assassin and her Master fostered further chaos that way. The only ones bothered by the fact that they were murderers and deviating from the rules of the Great Holy Grail War were magi. It had nothing to do with Archer of Red.</p><p>But\u2014Assassin of Black had involved children.</p><p>At that instant, Assassin and her Master became enemies to Archer of Red. The Master was especially unforgivable. Assassin was a child, but her Master was an adult\u2014and she had allowed her Servant to involve children.</p><p>Archer had nocked an arrow and intended to end both Assassin and her Master together. But surprisingly, Assassin\u2019s Master, perhaps because she was trying to protect the Servant in her arms, had turned in Archer\u2019s direction.</p><p>Coincidentally, theirs gazes met.</p><p>She did not have the appearance of a crafty magus, but rather wore modern clothing\u2014she was clearly an ordinary woman.</p><p>The woman had worn a fleeting look of sorrow, and then, without resisting at all, simply waited for the arrow to be shot. No, that wasn\u2019t right. It appeared the woman was trying to protect Assassin.</p><p>\u2014Even thought it was a meaningless act.</p><p>Archer of Red didn\u2019t waver. If her target was letting herself be shot, Archer wouldn\u2019t pass the opportunity up. Neutrally, emptying herself of all sentiment, she shot the arrow.</p><p>The shot was more than enough to kill a single person. The arrow pierced the Master\u2019s chest, and Archer of Red could sense from the feedback that it had killed Assassin\u2019s Master.</p><p>\u201CMother\u2026! Mother, Mother, Mother\u2026!\u201D</p><p>Assassin\u2019s Master placed her hand on the cheek of the young girl that was desperately calling out to her, and murmured something to her before finally dying.</p><p>A feeling similar to guilt gouged Archer\u2019s chest, but it didn\u2019t move her heart. Even if she was a child, Assassin was a Servant. Servants were beings summoned in order to win the Holy Grail War.</p><p>Even if she took the form of a child, that was simply the form of her heyday in life.</p><p>\u2026Though it was irregular, there were such cases among Heroic Spirits.</p><p>Assassin of Black merely stared at the corpse of her Master in a daze. She would disappear eventually at this rate even if Archer let her go, but even if it was a one-in-a-million chance, another Master might appear to make a contract with her.</p><p>I\u2019ll get rid of her here and now, Archer decided, nocking another arrow and immediately shooting it. Assassin didn\u2019t move an inch from her kneeling position beside the corpse. Perhaps she didn\u2019t even understand that an arrow had been shot at her.</p><p>It\u2019s better that way, thought Archer. It would be better if she just let it all go like this. All of Assassin\u2019s regrets, hopes and despair would be irrelevant if she disappeared.</p><p>Assassin merely convulsed for an instant when the arrow pierced her heart, not even letting out a scream.</p><p>Puzzled, Archer of Red approached her. The arrow definitely should have destroyed Assassin\u2019s spiritual core. But she didn\u2019t display any response to it.</p><p>There was no sign of pain, or of her body fading away and vanishing. It was an abnormal sight. Assassin was merely looking up at the sky. Her blank face made it clear that she was no longer capable of fighting.</p><p>And yet, Archer of Red felt a chill go down her back and started to feel fear towards something she couldn\u2019t place.</p><p>Heroic Spirits were those who had become figures of bravery by conquering fear in all forms. Naturally, as a Heroic Sprit herself, Atalanta understood that well.</p><p>She didn\u2019t fear the darkness of the forest deep in the night. She hadn\u2019t feared the giant boar that a god had released on the earth.</p><p>She could even laugh and overcome battlefields where a single instant\u2019s decision could lead to death. That shouldn\u2019t have changed in the Great Holy Grail War either.</p><p>There was no room for her to feel fear in this situation. She had shot down the enemy, and even if she hadn\u2019t, Assassin was on the verge of death. This was enemy territory, but she was confident that she could make her escape on her swift feet. Even if everything proceeded in the worst possible way and she perished on this battlefield, she would have regrets, but she would accept it.</p><p>That was the karma of battle. Any Heroic Spirit had at least that much resolve.</p><p>But\u2026</p><p>Archer of Red took a step back. No, the thing that conflicted her right now was something decisively different from that kind of fear.</p><p>It was the feeling that, just by remaining here, something would end.</p><p>What was there to fear? Assassin of Black no longer had any means of counterattack.</p><p>Just what kind of threat could a Servant, who\u2019s Master was dead and who couldn\u2019t use her Noble Phantasms, pose?</p><p>There was no threat. There shouldn\u2019t have been, and yet\u2014</p><p>Assassin of Black\u2019s head spun around her neck like that of a doll\u2019s, and turned to face Archer of Red. Archer couldn\u2019t help but think that her blank eyes were beautiful like blue crystals.</p><p>Assassin of Black opened her mouth.</p><p>\u201CWhy?\u201D</p><p>After Assassin spoke that single word, a stream of black mud-like mass spewed out from her mouth.</p><p>Archer of Red frantically jumped away, but her reaction was fatally too slow.</p><p>\u201CThis is\u2026!?\u201D</p><p>Summoned as Assassin, Jack the Ripper was an amalgamation of vengeful spirits. The unborn children who had been abandoned in the Whitechapel district had merely temporarily materialized by taking the form of a young girl.</p><p>Archer of Red\u2019s arrow just now had released all of them from the focal point known as [Jack the Ripper].</p><p>Looking like a thick fog, the vengeful spirits attacked the nearest living being, Archer\u2014and completely engulfed her.</p><p>\u2014In that instant, Archer of Red saw hell.</p><p>Question: What is hell?</p><p>Answer: Eternally continuing torture.</p><p>Answer: Eternally repeated slaughter.</p><p>Answer: Eternally unending despair.</p><p>Indeed, each and every one of these can be called hell.</p><p>However, there are actually a great variety of hells in this world.</p><p>The city of fog, London, the Whitechapel district\u2014to certain people, that place was definitely hell. Just living was difficult, and it was impossible to have a life you could take pride in.</p><p>How could there be pride in a world where nine-year-old girls sold their bodies on the street? The stench of the tanning factories and meat processing plants always filled the air, and rats and cockroaches rejoiced in this society. There was no such thing as the \u2018strong\u2019 there; everyone who lived there were miserable weaklings, pitiful victims and cruel assailants.</p><p>Yes, it was hell.</p><p>Hell, this is truly hell. Children, there are children, so many children.</p><p>Their eyes are dead. They understand that there is no love in this world. No, that\u2019s wrong, there is love. There definitely is. And yet, I can\u2019t call out to them. I want to help, I want to save you all, and yet my body won\u2019t move.</p><p>All the children turned their eyes towards her.</p><p>I\u2019ll save you! I\u2019ll save you! I was abandoned just like you all in the past. I was saved from that fate! The joy of that, the happiness of that, I\u2019ll bestow it to you all\u2014</p><p>She had lost the ability to speak, but even so, Archer of Red tried to appeal to them in her heart. The children merely approached her silently.</p><p>There was no joy, sorrow or hatred in them. Their cold and inhuman eyes were similar to those of sharks.</p><p>Archer of Red unconsciously tried to step back in chilling revulsion, but one of the children grabbed her arm.</p><p>The children opened all their mouths at once.</p><p>\u201CJoin us.\u201D</p><p>Smoothly, the child entered inside her skin. Another one grabbed her legs\u2014and penetrated her blood vessels. Others penetrated her nerves, bones, organs, muscles, brain\u2026</p><p>Archer of Red screamed.</p><p>Her heart was tormented not by fear, but by the despair of the children and herself\u2014</p><p><img src="https://i.lensdump.com/i/1sfNJm.jpg" alt=""></p><hr><p>Sieg and Ruler, who had been chasing after Archer of Black, were also engulfed in it.</p><p>A black fog-like something had surged toward them while they were running through the streets, and engulfed them without giving them any time to run away. A mud-like substance coiled around their entire bodies, and all their senses were cut off, like when you\u2019re about to fall asleep.</p><p>When he regained his senses, Sieg was standing in a strange place.</p><p>\u201CThis is\u2026\u201D</p><p>He was in an extremely cold city covered in fog. A heavy and awful stench pervaded the area. The stench of meat, the stench of entrails, the stench of vomit and human excrement\u2026</p><p>This isn\u2019t Trifas, Sieg judged based on his surroundings. The building architecture was completely different, and there were people on the streets. Though the fog smelled slightly disgusting, it wasn\u2019t painful.</p><p>He noticed that all of senses were dull and muted for some reason, and that everyone passing by him on the street was ignoring him.</p><p>He began walking. He limped, unable to feel his feet stepping on the ground, as if he were stepping on a plastic bag.</p><p>This is an illusion, or a nightmare\u2014Sieg thus concluded.</p><p>The problem was, whose dream was this? It wasn\u2019t Sieg\u2019s; this scenery was completely unknown to him. It wasn\u2019t Ruler\u2019s either. He already knew her true name. No matter how he thought about it, this place didn\u2019t match the era she was from.</p><p>A cold wind blew by, seeming to permeate his very flesh and bones, and a crumpled newspaper floated down in front of Sieg\u2019s feet.</p><p>He read the text on it\u2014and understood everything.</p><p>From Hell\u2014Jack the Ripper</p><p>This appears to be Jack the Ripper\u2019s\u2026 that is, Assassin of Black\u2019s dream. But where is Assassin herself? She\u2026 no, he? Which was it? Strange, there\u2019s no way I could have forgotten that\u2026</p><p>\u201CDamn it. All the information about Assassin disappeared again.\u201D</p><p>The way Assassin was able to slip away no matter how much they chased after her was truly superb. But this time, this time Sieg wouldn\u2019t let her get away.</p><p>Sieg began walking in search of Jack the Ripper\u2014but then his vision suddenly distorted, and an instant later, he found himself in a different place once more.</p><p>\u2014Sieg couldn\u2019t deny that, up until that moment, he had held certain illusions about humans.</p><p>\u2014He had only gained self-consciousness a few days ago and, even if he had knowledge, he had no experience, so it was hard to say that he had understood how deep the evil deeds of humans went.</p><p>\u2014Most of all, the fact that he was blessed with the people surrounding him being Heroic Spirits, those who were heroes in the past, had the biggest effect on his view of things.</p><p>\u2014The world is beautiful. How many sacrifices had people made in order to speak those words? Sieg still hadn\u2019t comprehended that.</p><p>Laugh, laugh, laugh.</p><p>This place is the lowest plane of the world. This is none other than Cocytus, the very bottom of hell. Of course, I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s actually a hell. I know nothing of such things.</p><p>Visitors here come to understand just one thing. \u2018This place is definitely hell.\u2019 London, Whitechapel, a great human meat processing plant. It\u2019s a nest of Jorougumo where escape if impossible if you fall down into it.</p><p>This place is packed with everything within Pandora\u2019s Box, except for hope. All kinds of disasters, all kinds of despair, continually flux, converge and rain down like dirty mud here.</p><p>Prostitutes who are like monstrous creatures both without and within sell their bodies, and shelve the money they earn by selling the life they were born with.</p><p>Splat, splat.</p><p>Repeat, repeat.</p><p>Splat, splat.</p><p>Treatment, treatment, treatment, treatment.</p><p>Blood flowed in a river. The factories are discharging waste anyways, so it\u2019s no big deal if we increase the protein.</p><p>It\u2019s truly no big deal. No problem at all. If you consider the size of the world\u2019s great flow, this is just a little smidge of dirty mud.</p><p>Hands protrude from that dirty mud, and monsters are born.</p><p>That\u2019s why this place is hell, purgatory, the corrupt city of Babylon where inhuman monsters live.</p><p>Sieg watched.</p><p>He watched a very young girl be violated by a large hairy man in order to get her daily food. He watched a young boy knock down the girl with a stick in order to steal her food. He watched the boy have the bread he risked his life to get stolen in turn by a cunning adult, and watched that bread finally arrive meaninglessly in the hands of someone else.</p><p>He saw an unborn fetus. He watched the people who had brought it into the world in an unchaste act of intercourse then dispose of it.</p><p>Children weren\u2019t killed in this hell. Children were expended.</p><p>Thus, light gradually disappeared from the eyes of children. The world, like silk cloth, twined around their bodies, and they were swallowed by snakes without moving an inch.</p><p>It was ugly.</p><p>It was far too ugly.</p><p>If there was some great evil, he could understand. If there was some enormous, wicked villain\u2014someone like that who ruled them, then Sieg would still have been able to hold onto his illusions about humans. But, this was a system. A bad debt that was created when humans built and developed a city. Or perhaps it was just pus.</p><p>No one was blamed and denounced. No one was saved. No, saving anyone here was impossible. The act of salvation itself wasn\u2019t acknowledged by the system.</p><p>\u201CStop it.\u201D</p><p>Sieg trembled and kneeled down on the ground. He had been on the verge of death many times up until now, but those times were all cases of bodily death. But the sight of this was killing Sieg\u2019s heart.</p><p>\u201CStop it\u2026 Please, I\u2019m begging you, stop it!\u201D</p><p>His illusions were contaminated and the scene that should have been beautiful grew faded and dull.</p><p>\u201C\u2014Yes. That\u2019s right.\u201D</p><p>When he came to his sense, his surroundings had changed once more. There was thick fog in the air, blocking out all moonlight\u2026 It was a truly chilly night. Whose voice was that just now?\u2014Sieg wondered as he looked around, and finally noticed.</p><p>Sieg was standing alone on a deserted street somewhere.</p><p>\u201C\u2026What\u2019s right?\u201D</p><p>Sieg resolutely questioned the voice. He saw a shadow move in an alleyway. He chased after it without hesitation.</p><p>At the dead-end of the back alley, there stood a girl in tattered clothing.</p><p>For some reason, he knew who she was\u2014she was Jack the Ripper.</p><p>\u201CI\u2019ll ask you again. What\u2019s right?\u201D</p><p>The girl replied in a strangely distorted voice.</p><p>\u201CThe world is ugly.\u201D</p><p>Hearing a rustling sound behind him, Sieg turned around\u2014and there too stood a girl in tattered clothing. That girl opened her mouth.</p><p>\u201CThat\u2019s why we wanted to go back.\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2026Go back where?\u201D</p><p>Another rustle. This time, it came from above\u2014and walking casually on a building\u2019s wall was another girl in tattered clothing.</p><p>\u201CBack inside mother\u2019s belly.\u201D</p><p>Another one appeared. Every one of them looked at Sieg with hollow eyes.</p><p>\u201CWe wanted to go back.\u201D</p><p>\u201CWe wanted to go back.\u201D</p><p>\u201CWe just wanted to go back inside mother\u2019s belly.\u201D</p><p>\u201CSo why? Why is everyone so mean to us?\u201D</p><p>\u201CWe wanted to be saved. So why did no one save us?\u201D</p><p>\u201CWere we bad?\u201D</p><p>\u201CWere we hated?\u201D</p><p>Sieg couldn\u2019t give an adequate answer to those questions. The premise of \u2018wanting to live\u2019 did not exist for these girls.</p><p>The girls grabbed Sieg\u2019s arms. The girls melted while smiling with tears falling from their eyes and permeated inside of Sieg.</p><p>\u201CThe world\u2014is so very ugly. We know that. Despite that, do you still want to live?\u201D</p><p>Those words\u2026 dealt the most fatal wound of all to the heart of the boy who did not yet know the world.</p><hr><p>Ruler had also been sucked into the girls\u2019\u2014Jack\u2019s nightmare. Ruler walked down a road filled with the stench of rotting bodies.</p><p>\u201CThis place is\u2026 England?\u201D</p><p>In Trifas, though the architectural style had been that of the Middle Ages, the town itself had a properly maintained sanitation system. But this place was the opposite. The buildings here were modern in style, the kind that Laeticia was familiar with in her memories. But the streets were filled with strife and unsanitary conditions.</p><p>This was the city where Jack the Ripper was born. A freezing fog and a pitch black night. In the midst of that, Ruler walked down the street.</p><p>Before she realized it, her armor had disappeared, and her holy flag was gone from her hand as well. However, she didn\u2019t feel helpless at all. She continued walking straight ahead in a dignified manner.</p><p>She had a rough idea as to the nature of this illusion. She also understood how to escape from it\u2014no, how to bring it down.</p><p>\u2026It meant doing something sorrowful. Even if the end result would be a blessing, someone would have to bear pain in order to achieve it.</p><p>A person, no, a child, who was the pure manifestation of innocence.</p><p>\u201C\u2014Even so. Nothing will start unless she is killed.\u201D</p><p>After she took a single breath, Ruler\u2019s eyes were filled with strong determination. Her resolve was as sharp as a blade and as hard as steel.</p><p>There was a young girl in one of the back alleys. She glared at the holy maiden Jeanne d\u2019Arc with eyes filled with despair. The girl\u2019s killing intent was that of the weak\u2014but Ruler glared back at the girl without flinching. She released her own killing intent, which a hero would normally never direct at a despairing, victimized child.</p><p>The little girl was so shocked she retreated back a step. Ruler questioned her with a cold-hearted voice.</p><p>\u201CWhat\u2019s wrong, Assassin of Black\u2026? No, the girl who used to be Assassin of Black. The girl who held the name of Jack the Ripper, who wasn\u2019t really anyone. Do you intend to run away?\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2026Why aren\u2019t you scared?\u201D</p><p>\u201CScared? Why is there a need to think of you as frightening? All of you are merely sorrowful victims.\u201D</p><p>At those words, countless children appeared all around Ruler one after another. Their faces were each unique and yet they somehow had a sense of sameness. Every one of them was dirty and had eyes filled with a dark light.</p><p>This place was unmistakably the hell of this era. These children were the embodiment of it in human form.</p><p>No matter how heartless someone was, they would falter, feel fear and shudder if they were pushed down here. This place was the inner world that embodied of Jack the Ripper\u2019s Origin. A miniature garden of darkness that took form as Assassin was dying, filled with human ugliness.</p><p>\u201CGreat Holy Maiden.\u201D</p><p>\u201CLady Angel.\u201D</p><p>\u201CSave us, save the pitiful, so pitiful Jack. Save us. Save us, help us, gives us your hand. Please, please, please\u2014\u201D</p><p>The children crowded around Ruler and clung to her with desperate expressions on their faces.</p><p>If she\u2019s a saint, then she can save them. If she\u2019s a saint, then she\u2019ll definitely grant them salvation. No, even without being a saint, as long as she was a decent human being, this was a situation where she should feel something for them.</p><p>And yet, Ruler did not quiver as she stood at the center of them\u2014in fact, there was not the slightest tremble, sympathy or even pity on her face.</p><p>The holy maiden spoke harshly to them.</p><p>\u201C\u2014I cannot do that. I can save children who\u2019ve lost their way and I can purify souls that have lingering regrets by praying. However, Jack the Ripper alone cannot be saved by me.\u201D</p><p>The children froze.</p><p>\u201CYou have all already been included as part of \u2018his\u2019 legend. The murderer known as Jack the Ripper is already both anybody and nobody. Do you all truly understand that the people you killed were victims of Jack the Ripper? You know neither their names nor their faces. You only sought your mother\u2019s face and killed them in the process, right?\u201D</p><p>Jack the Ripper killed at least five prostitutes\u2014</p><p>Jack the Ripper gouged out their organs\u2014</p><p>Jack the Ripper sent a letter to a newspaper company\u2014</p><p>Jack the Ripper is a doctor.</p><p>Jack the Ripper is a member of the Royal Family.</p><p>Jack the Ripper is a painter.</p><p>Jack the Ripper is an ordinary person that can be found anywhere.</p><p>All of these were lies, and all of these were true. Now that all kinds of rumors, gossip and guesses had become jumbled together, trying to grasp her identity outside of being Jack the Ripper was an unimaginably difficult act.</p><p>She was anybody and nobody. She was nobody and anybody.</p><p>The problem was\u2014that the number of possibilities was close to infinite. Because of that, the Anti-Heroic Spirit Jack the Ripper included all the possibilities in this world.</p><p>Most likely, the Holy Grail had tried to call forth a \u2018Jack the Ripper\u2019 that embodied all of these possibilities.</p><p>\u201CThat\u2019s right. You all have all been made part of Jack the Ripper. You might have been forced to become part of him\u2026 But that\u2019s why, even if I can kill you, I can\u2019t save you.\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2014No way\u2026\u201D</p><p>\u201CNo\u2014\u201D</p><p>\u201CWe, we\u2014\u201D</p><p>Unrest ran through the children. Though they sought salvation, they contaminated everyone they came across. They truly were evil spirits. Though it was only vaguely, they understood their own end.</p><p>This holy maiden\u2019s prayers weren\u2019t salvation for them\u2014</p><p>\u201C\u2026It seems you finally understand. I\u2019ll commence destroying you all now.\u201D</p><p>Her prayers were a Baptism Rite for completely annihilating their existence.</p><p>\u201CThe Lord\u2019s blessing is deep, His love is eternal and constant.\u201D</p><p>\u201CWhy\u2026 Why are you\u2026!?\u201D</p><p>\u201CThis is natural providence\u2026 You should already understand. You have all been transformed by your inflated hatred and the despair of the people you killed. Not one of you can be separated from the concept of \u2018Jack the Ripper\u2019 anymore.\u201D</p><p>\u201CYou dwell in the deserted wasteland, not knowing the path to your proper place.\u201D</p><p>They were all molded together as one into \u2018Jack the Ripper\u2019.</p><p>Not a single one of them even had a name of their own. They were not recognized as individuals by the world.</p><p>\u201CHunger, thirst, the soul withers.\u201D</p><p>\u201CNo! No, we, we are\u2014!\u201D</p><p>\u201CThen do you all have individual names?\u201D</p><p>The children\u2019s breathing halted. That was a forbidden question. These children, who had been thrown away while still a fetus, had no names. Even if humans had names, mere cells did not.</p><p>\u201CSpeak His name and be saved. Speak the name of the One who will guide you to your proper place.\u201D</p><p>\u201CIn that case\u2014\u201D</p><p>Ruler slowly held out her right hand. At that moment, a shout rang out from somewhere.</p><p>\u201CStop\u2026 stop, Ruler\u2026!!\u201D</p><p>\u201CArcher of Red\u2026!?\u201D</p><p>Ruler was shocked as she saw Archer of Red glaring at her with an arrow nocked on her bow. Her right arm was tainted black and it was clear that she was being possessed by an evil spirit.</p><p>\u201CWhat are you doing, Archer!? Your right arm\u2014\u201D</p><p>Archer interrupted Ruler\u2019s words by shooting the arrow.</p><p>\u201CShut up! Right back at you, what are you trying to do!? They\u2019re children! They\u2019re merely children, innocent souls. They aren\u2019t evil! They\u2019re victims, pitiful souls that were crushed by the system of the world! Why are you killing them!?\u201D</p><p>The evil spirits reacted to Archer of Red\u2019s words and gathered behind her all at once. They probably sensed a strong will to protect them from her.</p><p>Ruler had no weapons. In the first place, this was an illusionary world. Nothing would be settled no matter how much they tried to kill each other here, and the arrow Archer had fired had no effect either.</p><p>\u2026That bow and arrow were Archer\u2019s will. A pure and simple will of retribution that declared she would kill Ruler if she killed these children.</p><p>Does she feel sympathy for them? thought Ruler as she glared at Archer\u2014and was glared at in return.</p><p>\u201CArcher, you should also understand as a Heroic Spirit. Those children cannot be saved. For them to live only results in increasing the number of their own kind. In the first place\u2014returning their souls to a peaceful place is an act of kindness.\u201D</p><p>Without any hesitation, Archer of Red fired another arrow. The steel arrowhead pierced the ground\u2019s stone paving. Archer was sorrowfully earnest, and yet fatally mistaken.</p><p>\u201CWhat kindness!? Saving others is the duty of a saint! Maid of Orleans, for what purpose did you wield a flag instead of a sword on the battlefield!? It was in order to not kill, wasn\u2019t it!? In order to not bloody your hands\u2014\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2014Is that what you think, Archer of Red?\u201D</p><p>Ruler spoke in a cold voice. It was a blade-like voice that was so sharp it even overwhelmed, for just an instant, the huntress who had run through battlefields.</p><p>\u201CSince I didn\u2019t use a sword, my hands weren\u2019t bloodied? Ridiculous. \u2014I participated in those battles. I decided to fight. From that instant, it was the same as if my own hands were stained in blood. Don\u2019t take me so lightly. I will not hesitate to destroy those children!\u201D</p><p>Those words angered Archer of Red from the depths of her heart, and she shouted as if snarling at Ruler.</p><p>\u201CThen, then. You aren\u2019t a saint\u2026!\u201D</p><p>\u201CThat\u2019s exactly right, Archer of Red. Everyone called me a saint, but I myself have never once thought of myself that way.\u201D</p><p>Archer of Red\u2019s expression turned shocked. If she was a saint, it was possible she could save these children. Archer might have thought that.</p><p>\u201CThis place is the world of these children\u2019s memories, merely an illusion created by their residual thoughts. Do you intend to continue letting them suffer eternally in this vague and ambiguous world!? Please, move aside.\u201D</p><p>Though visibly in anguish, Archer of Red firmly remained where she stood.</p><p>\u201C\u2026 guh\u2026 I\u2026 refuse! If I, if I abandon these children, then who will love them!? You said you would return their souls to a peaceful place, Ruler. That\u2019s merely extinguishing them, merely murder! I\u2014\u201D</p><p>Both Archer and Ruler\u2019s words halted. One of the girls hiding behind Archer\u2019s back stepped up to Ruler. What a vast and lost expression\u2014like a puppy thrown out into the wild, Ruler thought.</p><p>\u201CHey.\u201D</p><p>In response to that voice of appeal, Ruler bended down to her knees and met the child\u2019s gaze. Regardless of the reasons, what Ruler was about to do was unmistakably a \u2018sin\u2019. At the very least, she mustn\u2019t avert her eyes from it.</p><p>\u201CYes, what is it?\u201D</p><p>\u201CAre you\u2026 okay with killing us?\u201D</p><p>Those words pierced Ruler\u2019s heart like a sword. She clenched her teeth\u2014and endured it.</p><p>If they could be saved, she would have already saved them. If they could be helped, she would have already helped them. But she couldn\u2019t. Ruler understood that it was something she was unable to do.</p><p>\u201CEven so. Even so, we must all move forward.\u201D</p><p>Ruler bit her lip hard, causing blood to flow out. The instant they saw that, the agitation and fear of \u2018Jack the Ripper\u2019 disappeared.</p><p>\u201CNo\u2026 no, stop\u2026 please stop\u2026!\u201D</p><p>The children hiding behind Archer of Red walked up to Ruler one by one. Archer of Red tried to pull them back\u2014and as if rejecting that, the children slipped through her arms.</p><p>\u201C\u2014It can\u2019t be helped, huh?\u201D</p><p>\u201CYes. It can\u2019t be helped. May you all find peace.\u201D</p><p>Like cats that realized their end, the children took Ruler\u2019s hand without running away. Archer of Red understood then. It couldn\u2019t be helped. The death of these children was inevitable, a fact that couldn\u2019t be overturned.</p><p>Most of all, these children had rejected her\u2014so she couldn\u2019t move. She could only watch as a spectator in this illusionary world.</p><p>\u201CHe satiates the thirsty souls and satisfies the hungry souls with good.\u201D</p><p>The chant solemnly and smoothly began extinguishing the children\u2019s existence. This wasn\u2019t the normal second death of a Servant, but a literal erasure. They were being removed from the axis of the cycle of rebirth, and they would no longer be summoned as \u2018Jack the Ripper\u2019 in any other Holy Grail War.</p><p>It was both salvation and not salvation. Becoming a Servant meant gaining a second life, but to them, this was effectively their first life.</p><p>Holding hands with each other, the children stared at Ruler.</p><p>\u201CGive salvation to those who suffer and are bound in iron within the deep darkness.\u201D</p><p>They were disappearing. They weren\u2019t ascending to heaven, nor sinking into the darkness; they were merely dissolving into the world like mist.</p><p>\u201CAh\u2014\u201D</p><p>As she chanted, Ruler didn\u2019t let her grave and solemn expression break at all. If she cried, the children would know that she was saddened by their death, and they would probably leave behind lingering regrets in this world. That\u2019s why Ruler remained standing there firmly like steel.</p><p>\u201CNow, let your shackles be broken, and be freed from the deep darkness.\u201D</p><p>\u201CWe don\u2019t want to die\u2014\u201D</p><p>She nearly crumbled at the children\u2019s whisper\u2014but she didn\u2019t allow her posture to break. Without the slightest tremble, she simply continued \u2018disposing\u2019 of the children dispassionately.</p><p>\u201CGrant salvation to those who have fallen ill from acts stained in sin and who are troubled by injustice.\u201D</p><p>The children began disappearing one after another, and at the same time, the nightmarish London also began disappearing. This place was reconstructed from their memories, so if they disappeared, this city\u2019s existence would inevitably be rejected.</p><p>And then, everything was in darkness. There was only one young girl left. She stared at the holy maiden with pure eyes.</p><p>\u201CWe\u2019re going to disappear?\u201D</p><p>\u201CYes. That is natural providence.\u201D</p><p>\u201CIs that so? Yeah, that\u2019s right. We can\u2019t return anywhere or be anywhere. We spun in circles, ran in circles, and weren\u2019t able to reach anywhere.\u201D</p><p>After murmuring that, the girl laughed and then asked a final question.</p><p>\u201C\u2014Are you sad?\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2026No. You all are merely returning to your proper place. There\u2019s nothing to be sad about.\u201D</p><p>The holy maiden replied in a hard voice.</p><p>\u201CSo, I won\u2019t cry.\u201D</p><p>The holy maiden didn\u2019t cry. She covered her heart with a thick shell, and calmly crushed the children underfoot. She had no right to feel sad. As someone who wasn\u2019t judging their sins, but simply couldn\u2019t allow their existence\u2014she had no right to mourn.</p><p>\u201CA song of joy for the just, and silence for the unjust.\u201D</p><p>She recited the holy words.</p><p>The little girl, without smiling or looking sad, accepted it with empty eyes.</p><p>\u201C\u2014\u2014Pax Exeuntibus: Grant peace to these departing souls.\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2026How sad.\u201D</p><p>Leaving behind those words which pitied the holy maiden, the final girl vanished\u2014and the fog cleared away. Ruler\u2019s knees didn\u2019t bend or collapse. She didn\u2019t cry, and she didn\u2019t let out a single sob. She did not show any pity or compassion for the children who weren\u2019t even allowed to live.</p><p>Sympathy simply called forth victims. If she lost herself in it, everything would be wasted.</p><p>She had killed with her own hands the victimized children who sobbed out \u2018We just want to go back\u2019. It was no one\u2019s fault and no one could be blamed; it was simply an act of murder carved in sin.</p><p>Blood flowed out from her tightly clenched lips.</p><p>Ruler had personally tasted the heavy karma of humans just now.</p><p>Even so.</p><p>Even so, she didn\u2019t let her heart be crushed. Ruler warily gazed at Archer of Red. She was also worried about Sieg, who had also been caught up in that illusion along with her\u2014but she was certain that, if she moved her gaze away from Archer even slightly, she would fall into a fatal situation.</p><p>Even now that they had returned to reality, Archer was crouching on the ground, her body shivering. Like a wounded beast, thought Ruler. Regardless, it was clear that Archer of Red had lost herself.</p><p>\u2026It still hadn\u2019t been decided for sure that they were enemies. Ruler still hadn\u2019t confirmed which side Archer, Lancer and Rider of Red had chosen after their group left.</p><p>But, based on Archer\u2019s behavior just now\u2014</p><p>\u201CRuler\u2026 You killed them.\u201D</p><p>A hollow voice resounded terribly through the dark night of the city. Ruler immediately understood from that voice.</p><p>\u201CYes. The one who killed them was me, for certain.\u201D</p><p>She was an enemy. She would never get along with Ruler\u2014</p><p>After staggering to stand up, Archer shouted as her entire body trembled with killing intent.</p><p>\u201CI see. You\u2019re also on the side that discards them. Even though those children just wanted to live. You\u2019re on the side that tramples over them!?\u201D</p><p>A deep killing intent exuded from her eyes along with tears. She was so enraged that blood trickled down from her lips.</p><p>It was only briefly, but Ruler did exchange words with Archer on the battlefield previously\u2014but no trace of her aloof attitude from back then could be seen now.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t because they were enemies or allies, but because Ruler wounded something that was equivalent to Archer\u2019s soul.</p><p>Heroes had things that mustn\u2019t be touched. For Archer of Red, that was children. Since Ruler didn\u2019t save those children who existed as Jack the Ripper, she was now nothing more than an enemy to Archer of Red.</p><p>Even if those children were beings that absolutely couldn\u2019t be saved, Archer of Red still struggled to save them. No matter how much anguish and despair it brought her, she never gave up.</p><p>\u201C\u2026No matter what I say, you won\u2019t understand, Archer of Red.\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2014Those children could have been saved.\u201D</p><p>\u201CNo, they couldn\u2019t. Those children were, in the end, evil spirits. The concept of \u2018being saved\u2019 doesn\u2019t exist for them. That\u2019s why, no matter how much they continue to seek warmth\u2014they will destroy those who could give that warmth to them.\u201D</p><p>Archer of Red struck her hand against the stone building next to her. With a loud crack, the wall crumbled away as if it were brittle.</p><p>\u201CShut up! They could have\u2026 they could have been saved! Even if it was impossible with my own power, they could have been with the power of the Holy Grail!\u201D</p><p>With the power of the Holy Grail, she said. In other words, that meant having the Holy Grail grant her wish.</p><p>But Shirou Kotomine should have been in control of the Holy Grail.</p><p>As Ruler was about to question this discrepancy, Archer of Red nocked an arrow on her bow without waiting for her to speak. But, by the time she did so, Archer of Black had caught sight of the two female Servants once the fog cleared and had already aimed his own shot at Archer of Red before she could fire.</p><p>\u201C\u2014\u03B1\u03C3\u03C4\u03C1\u03B1\u03C0\u03B7 \u03C7\u03B5\u03B9\u03BC\u03C9\u03BD: Ferocity is the Hammer of the Gods.\u201D</p><p>The three arrows he fired were all filled with as much prana as they could take. Though it may not have worked against Rider or Saber of Red, Archer of Red had no defense strong enough to withstand arrows containing this much destructive power. If they hit her, she would almost definitely die at once.</p><p>But\u2014only if they hit.</p><p>The stone-paved ground exploded, forming a huge crater. But Archer of Red had avoided all three arrows with frighteningly agile movements while howling like a beast. Those movements like a four-legged beast\u2026 as expected of a hunter that lived in the wild, Archer of Black thought with a bitter expression.</p><p>But Archer of Red had no interest in the shots fired at her just now. Without even looking in Archer of Black\u2019s direction, she sharply snarled like a beast\u2014and shouted at Ruler with deep hatred, as if vomiting blood.</p><p>\u201C\u2014I won\u2019t forgive you!! Ruler, I won\u2019t forgive your deception-filled life! False holy maiden\u2014I will never forgive you for having killed those children instead of saving them! If you\u2019re going to steal the Holy Grail, come and get it. I, Atalanta, shall shoot you all down without leaving a single survivor!\u201D</p><p>Glaring at her enemy, Ruler, while gasping in anguish, Archer of Red quickly retreated.</p><p>When she was alive, the men who were charmed by Atalanta\u2019s beauty were given a trial. Beat her in a foot race. Losing meant death. Even so, the men who didn\u2019t give up challenged her one after another\u2014and all of them lost.</p><p>Rider of Red was one of the few people who possessed speed equal to hers. Even the great Greek sage Chiron couldn\u2019t pursue her when it came to pure running speed.</p><p>\u201C\u2014Are you running away, Archer of Red?\u201D</p><p>Archer of Black said that, thinking she would come fight him if provoked. But Archer of Red didn\u2019t even glance at Archer of Black once, and swiftly ran away within the darkness of the night.</p><p>\u201C\u2026We can\u2019t catch up with her.\u201D</p><p>Ruler could tell. Archer of Red had retreated from the battle area in a mere instant, and she would slip out of this city in less than a minute. She was most likely here as a scout, and even if there had been a ripe opportunity for it, it was irregular for her to move to kill Assassin of Black earlier.</p><p>She had most likely acted in order to save the children that Assassin hurt. But her arrow had unleashed something in Assassin of Black. Normally, a Servant would have their connection to this world severed and vanish when their spiritual core was destroyed\u2014or when their Master died.</p><p>But, instead, Assassin of Black had reproduced that scene of hell at the end of her life\u2026</p><p>Ruler shook her head, and for the time being, put aside the various matters that needed to be considered later. The safety of this area had been secured, so next she had to find Sieg\u2014</p><p>\u201CSieg-kun!\u201D</p><p>Reprimanding her own strife-filled and screaming heart, Ruler began searching her surroundings. Sieg should have also been dragged into that fog along with her. She had managed to endure it, but could that painfully pure boy endure\u2014?</p><p>Ruler quickly found Sieg lying unconscious on the ground, curled up in a fetal position. She lifted him up with her arms and called out to him.</p><p>\u201CPull yourself together\u2026 Please pull yourself together, Sieg-kun!\u201D</p><p>Trembling weakly, Sieg woke up. And without even giving Ruler the time to pat her chest in relief, he grasped her arm and asked her.</p><p>\u201CRuler, what was that?\u201D</p><p>\u201CSieg-kun\u2026 please calm down.\u201D</p><p>But Sieg was tensed and strained. He questioned Ruler with a confused and lost expression.</p><p>\u201CThose were normal humans? Not magi, but ordinary humans created hell that easily?\u201D</p><p>Sieg\u2019s shock was great, as to be expected. Servants were beings of abnormal power and therefore separate from the world of humans. Magi were those who were human and yet separate from human reason.</p><p>And, excluding other homunculi, the number of ordinary humans he had met was quite few, consisting of only the old man he met on the other side of the forest when he ran away and the people he encountered in town today.</p><p>Of course, he hadn\u2019t expected for humans to be perfectly good.</p><p>But\u2014he had believed they weren\u2019t evil. He would never have thought that they could create a hell like that by their own will.</p><p>What should Ruler tell him, as he sat there on the verge of tears even now? That even those people hadn\u2019t wished to create that hell? That it was because human survival instinct permitted evil? No, the problem was that he wanted to believe that people were good.</p><p>But Ruler knew that that was wrong.</p><p>\u201C\u2026Most likely, I saw the same thing as you did.\u201D</p><p>Sieg looked at Ruler in surprise.</p><p>\u201CListen, Sieg-kun. What you asked isn\u2019t something even I can answer. It\u2019s true that a great and pure cruelty, which excuses all kinds of terrible and unjust acts, exists within human beings.\u201D</p><p>Jeanne d\u2019Arc had experienced it firsthand. She was betrayed and had her life and pride trampled over in various ways. It would to be wrong not to call that evil. And the ones who trampled upon her weren\u2019t natural-born villains or those who had been raised to be evil, but simply ordinary humans who had judged Jeanne d\u2019Arc as an enemy.</p><p>That\u2019s why she understood that humans committed evil even without falling into evil.</p><p>She was aware that, even if people were individually good, they were evil as a whole.</p><p>Even so\u2014</p><p>She strongly gripped clasped Sieg\u2019s hands with her hand. Not wanting to show her expression, she bowed her head.</p><p>\u201CEven so, please don\u2019t give up yet. Please, please\u2026\u201D</p><p>Please don\u2019t give up on humans.</p><p>Please don\u2019t give up and say \u2018That\u2019s all they are\u2019. Because becoming disillusioned with humans is easy, and hating humans is even easier, but continuing to love humans is hard.</p><p>\u201CYou\u2014\u201D</p><p>Sieg spoke up. Ruler listened to him without raising her head.</p><p>\u201CYou still haven\u2019t given up?\u201D</p><p>Even though she said that humans weren\u2019t evil in themselves, didn\u2019t she acknowledge that humans could be an ugly and wicked existence?</p><p>Even though she was gripped by such despair that she was unable to add anything after saying \u2018Even so\u2019\u2014</p><p>You still love humans?</p><p>Ruler raised her head. Her smile was pure and noble.</p><p>\u201CYes. I haven\u2019t given up.\u201D</p><p>Those proud words just barely managed to stop the chaos and disgust inside Sieg. Sieg also knew of Jeanne d\u2019Arc\u2019s past.</p><p>Even though she had experienced such a terrible death, she said that she still hadn\u2019t given up. Then, someone as young and inexperienced as him shouldn\u2019t give up yet either.</p><p>He still hadn\u2019t seen anything of the world yet. It was too soon to come to a conclusion.</p><p>Of course, just remembering that scene invoked such disgust in him that it made him feel like vomiting. Ruler said she hadn\u2019t given up, but\u2026 for her to have to think \u2018I won\u2019t give up\u2019 in the first place\u2014</p><p>It meant that the world was filled with that much undefined evil.</p><p>Stifling the gloomy feelings inside him, Sieg somehow managed to stand up.</p><p>\u201CIt appears it\u2019s over.\u201D</p><p>Sieg turned around, and saw Archer of Black elegantly jump down from above. He landed soundlessly like a feather.</p><p>\u201CYes. Do the people that got dragged into the fog need medical treatment? I can also help a little with my magecraft.\u201D</p><p>\u201CThe people who fainted are seriously hurt, but not so much that they\u2019ll die. My Master is already making arrangement for them to be taken care of.\u201D</p><p>\u201CThen, about the children\u2014\u201D</p><p>Ruler asked with a worried face, but Archer of Black smiled to put her at ease.</p><p>\u201CIt seems they were intentionally excluded from the effects of the fog. They only have some scratches from when they fought both of you.\u201D</p><p>\u201CI see. Thank goodness\u2026\u201D</p><p>Ruler sighed and patted her chest in relief. After finishing his report, Archer of Black immediately went back into spiritual form and headed off to return to his Master.</p><p>\u201CWith this, it\u2019s over.\u201D</p><p>\u201CYes. At the very least\u2026 everything concerning Assassin of Black is finished.\u201D</p><p>Absentmindedly, Sieg remembered the scene he glimpsed in the fog at the end\u2014more specifically, the voices he heard back then.</p><p>Archer of Red, who was laid out accusations filled with killing intent, and Ruler, who responded with a cool voice.</p><p>Archer of Red had yelled at her several times, \u201CYou killed those children.\u201D While lying incapacitated on the ground, Sieg had thought in shock that she meant the children they had protected from Assassin of Black, but it seemed Archer of Red had been talking about the children who appeared in that illusionary world.</p><p>Sieg\u2019s general knowledge was enough for him to understand what kind of beings those children were.</p><p>Those children were what brought the Servant Assassin of Black into existence\u2026 in other words, they were like the foundation of existence known as \u2018Jack the Ripper\u2019. Naturally, they were already dead.</p><p>Even so, if they were left alone, they might have possessed some powerless human. In that case, it was highly possible that a Jack the Ripper with a living human body would have appeared.</p><p>Of course, they were low-class evil spirits. The most they would have been able to do was give someone the urge to commit murder, and they would have lacked any supernatural powers.</p><p>Even so, victims would definitely appear. That\u2019s why Ruler killed those children\u2014by extinguishing them with the Baptism Rite chant. Sieg could understand that that decision was correct and definitely an act of justice.</p><p>Yet, why had Archer of Red cursed Ruler like that? And why had Ruler kept accepting her words?</p><p>It was irrational. It was far too irrational. Even though she was a hero who had accumulated various achievements in life, didn\u2019t Ruler think that it was far too unreasonable?</p><p>When Sieg asked Ruler about it, she scrunched her brow in sorrow and murmured.</p><p>\u201C\u2014Most likely, Archer of Red had never seen that kind of [evil] before.\u201D</p><p>\u201CNever\u2026 seen it?\u201D</p><p>\u201CThere are various forms of hell. Atalanta might have seen villages massacred by evil beings. She might have seen the tyrannical rule of heinous kings.\u201D</p><p>But that hell was different from those. There was no justice in that Whitechapel district. Such a thing as justice didn\u2019t existence anywhere there.</p><p>But\u2014they weren\u2019t evil. The queen of that era, the doctors, the policemen, the criminals, the prostitutes, the orphans\u2014none of them were either evil or just. The sky of that city had just been too heavy. It was like that oppressive grey sky had been crushing all of them.</p><p>Indeed, \u2018Jack the Ripper\u2019 was evil. But her origin was simply\u2014the small wish of the abandoned to \u2018return to a peaceful place\u2019.</p><p>\u201C\u2026That\u2019s why you apologized?\u201D</p><p>\u201CYes. Remember this well, Sieg-kun.\u201D</p><p>Ruler turned around\u2014and gave a transient smile illuminated by the faint streetlights.</p><p>\u201CEvil and justice can be interchanged infinitely depending on where one stands. At the very least, I am definitely [evil] to Archer of Red.\u201D</p><p>\u201CYou, are evil\u2026?\u201D</p><p>\u201CYes. It\u2019s just as Archer of Red said. I also think so myself. I\u2014am not anything like a saint.\u201D</p><p>Ruler said she wasn\u2019t a saint.</p><p>That was a denial of herself, a lie towards the people who idolized her. Sieg was shocked and gazed at her\u2014but Ruler averted her eyes.</p><p>\u201CNow, let\u2019s go back, Sieg-kun. If we\u2019re too slow, your Servant will get angry.\u201D</p><p>She smiled as if to push aside the previous discussion and began walking. Sieg decided to obediently follow after her. While gazing at her back, Sieg recalled the evil hell that ordinary humans had created.</p><p>He was certain that he would recall that scene countless times in the future. Each time he did, he would probably waver and become unable to believe in humanity.</p><p>There might be individual people that he\u2019ll come to like. But that might be merely a small piece of goodness washed away amidst overwhelming evil\u2014</p><p>Sieg would continue to ponder over humans and the world they create.</p><p>Would he eventually be able to come to a conclusion?</p><p>Humans are good/Humans are evil.</p><p>Or perhaps he would acknowledge that humans were neither under some unknown concept? Sieg didn\u2019t know. It was far too much to shoulder for a newborn homunculus.</p><p>The confusion due to the feelings born in him, the confusion due to the abnormality of his situation, his own yet-unseen destination.</p><p>His mind was a mess, and the most he could believe in was his own Servant and Ruler\u2019s smile\u2014</p><p>\u201CI am not anything like a saint.\u201D</p><p>Her confession just now was incredibly important. It was something he mustn\u2019t forget. That\u2019s how Sieg felt. But he didn\u2019t understand the meaning behind it.</p><p>He had no idea why the saint who should have been acknowledged by everyone derided herself as being evil and murmured that it was impossible for her to be a saint.</p><p>If he asked her, would she tell him why?</p><p>\u201C\u2026No, that\u2019s no good.\u201D</p><p>Sieg immediately discarded that idea. Questioning everything and getting an answer to everything from others was probably wrong. He needed to think for himself and understand it on his own.</p><p>Even if it was a question that might never be answered, even if the answer was lost in the darkness\u2014he mustn\u2019t stop the act itself of searching for that answer.</p><hr><p>When Archer of Red returned to the Hanging Gardens of Babylon: Aerial Gardens of Vanity where the Greater Grail was stored, she dispassionately reported to her Master Shirou that she had shot down Assassin of Black.</p><p>\u201CIf possible, I would have like it if Assassin of Black kept causing a disturbance among the enemy camp a little while longer\u2026\u201D</p><p>Assassin of Red spoke up in a bored manner from where she sat calmly on her throne.</p><p>\u201CIt doesn\u2019t matter. Either way, they will definitely chase after us. Since we\u2019re in an all-out war, it would be troublesome to have trash like that moving unnecessarily.\u201D</p><p>\u201CThat\u2019s true enough\u2026 Ah, by the way, Archer. Did you find out which Heroic Spirit Assassin of Black was?\u201D</p><p>Archer of Red replied in a completely apathetic, bored manner.</p><p>\u201CThere\u2019s no point in worrying over those already slain.\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2026Hmm. Yes, it\u2019s just as you say, but\u2026\u201D</p><p>Shirou\u2019s gaze became slightly suspicious. Archer of Red wore an annoyed expression and didn\u2019t respond. There was something more important she needed to think about right now\u2014all her focus was on her hated enemy.</p><p>\u201CI\u2019m tired\u2026 that\u2019s all I have to report.\u201D</p><p>After saying that, she left the throne room. Her Master Shirou tilted his head in puzzlement at having seen something strange.</p><p>\u201CWhat\u2019s wrong, Master?\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2026No. I\u2019m a little concerned about Archer of Red\u2019s behavior.\u201D</p><p>\u201CShe looks the same as always to me.\u201D</p><p>Archer of Red was a fundamentally cool-headed person. She wasn\u2019t indifferent, but even if someone died in front of her eyes, she wouldn\u2019t raise an eyebrow.</p><p>Perhaps it was because she had lived her life amidst the exceedingly harsh providence of nature. Her thoughts were extremely cool and sober when it came to life and death\u2014including her own.</p><p>That\u2019s why she wouldn\u2019t care about the people she killed, no matter who they were, since their deaths changed nothing.</p><p>Certainly, in that regard, her behavior was not that different from her usual attitude. But Shirou couldn\u2019t get rid of a feeling of something out of place.</p><p>\u2026And then he realized. She had said she was \u2018tired\u2019. But there was no way the likes of Atalanta could feel tired from a simple scouting mission.</p><p>Immediately before she turned around, Shirou had seen Archer of Red\u2019s face from the side.</p><p>Her beautiful face, which countless men had sought to marry her for, had been exuding unconcealed hatred and rage towards someone.</p><p>Archer of Red silently walked through the Hanging Gardens. Her pace was quick, as if she was trying to shake off that scene carved into her memories. But before she could go anywhere, a single man came to stand in her path.</p><p>\u201C\u2026Out of the way, Caster.\u201D</p><p>Archer glanced at Caster in displeasure. Caster spoke to her while wearing his usual smile that was as deep and opaque as the bottom of the sea.</p><p>\u201C[Good things of day begin to droop and drowse; While night\u2019s black agents to their preys do rouse]\u2026 Were you captured by the night, exalted swift-running huntress?\u201D</p><p>Archer grabbed the collar of Caster\u2019s shirt as if she were fed up with him\u2014and pushed him against a wall.</p><p>\u201CI\u2019m tired. Very tired. So shut up, you clown.\u201D</p><p>But Caster didn\u2019t shut up.</p><p>\u201CThere is no way you of all people would be tired from a mere scouting mission! And you aren\u2019t tired, but frightened, are you not? Just like a child who\u2019s unable to escape into sleep after hearing a scary story!\u201D</p><p>\u201CShut up!\u201D</p><p>Archer\u2019s gaze oozed with killing intent. Her eyes declared that she would kill him if he joked around any further. Nevertheless\u2014Caster questioned her, his smile never breaking.</p><p>\u201C\u2014What did you see? What did you perceive? How foolish. No matter what you saw, it is already merely a remnant of the past. We are ghosts of the past, and if ghosts regret the past, they become merely vengeful spirits.\u201D</p><p>The words of the clown, who shouldn\u2019t have known anything, gouged the deepest depths of Archer\u2019s heart.</p><p>\u201CYou bastard\u2026!!\u201D</p><p>Suddenly, all life and energy disappeared from Caster\u2019s body. In the blink of an eye, the man she grasped by the collar was reduced to a mere wooden puppet.</p><p>A spell used by the author Caster\u2026 or rather, a kind of sleight of hand that combined his immense fame and enigmatic history.</p><p>\u201C\u2014We must live in the future. To devote our bodies to the yet-unseen world. Archer, you also want to see it, don\u2019t you? A world where all children are loved!\u201D</p><p>At some unknown point, Caster had crept up behind her back. Hearing him voice her wish, Archer stopped as she was about to grab him by the cuff again. The one in front of her didn\u2019t seem like a puppet this time.</p><p>Caster of Red gave a thin smile and closed one eye.</p><p>\u201CFor the sake of that, we must activate the Greater Grail. Through any means possible.\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2026You really believe that it will grant that wish?\u201D</p><p>\u201CYou heard our Master\u2019s words, did you not? That Greater Grail can certainly grant his and your wish.\u201D</p><p>Hearing that answer, distress and conflict filled Archer of Red\u2019s face. Caster\u2019s words were truly like the devil\u2019s whisper.</p><p>\u201CI\u2014don\u2019t know. Certainly, if it\u2019s his wish, it might have the power to grant my wish as well. But\u2026 but, is it really all right? Is that wish truly\u2026 correct?\u201D</p><p>\u201CWho knows? I don\u2019t know either. No, let me put it like this. Are you unable to decide unless there\u2019s a guarantee? [To be or not to be]\u2014in that case, a clown can only laugh!\u201D</p><p>Archer glared at Caster for a little while\u2014but a little bit of life had returned to her eyes. She silently walked away from him.</p><p>Caster called out from behind her.</p><p>\u201CBy the way, Archer-dono. In the end, just what kind of hell did you see?\u201D</p><p>Keeping her back to him, Archer whispered softly.</p><p>\u201C\u2026It was a piece of the world\u2019s system. Gods, heroes, magical beasts, evil kings\u2014everything was dead there.\u201D</p><p>If an evil being committed a crime, then she would eliminate it.</p><p>If a god went on a rampage, then she would search for a method to soothe it.</p><p>But there was neither there. It was a part of mechanism of the world, working so superbly well that it created a perfect system that preyed on the weak.</p><p>There was only one way to destroy it.</p><p>The fulfillment of her wish by the activation of the Greater Grail. That was Archer\u2019s only hope now.</p><p>\u201CI couldn\u2019t save them with my own power\u2026 But, even though that woman could have saved them, she abandoned them and cut them down.\u201D</p><p>Her fists trembled with rage\u2014and, even while understanding that this question was a landmine, Caster of Red asked her without holding back his curiosity.</p><p>\u201CThat woman?\u201D</p><p>Turning around at the question, Archer of Red\u2019s eyes were filled with dreadful glee.</p><p>\u201CJeanne d\u2019Arc. I will kill that woman. I\u2019ll shoot her down with my arrows, and if that doesn\u2019t work, I will rip her apart with my claws, and if that doesn\u2019t work, I will tear her to shreds with my fangs.\u201D</p><p>\u201COh my, is that possible with your beautiful nails and teeth?\u201D</p><p>With unfading madness in her eyes, Archer of Red smiled in joy from the bottom of her heart.</p><p>\u201CIt\u2019s possible. If it\u2019s to kill that woman, I will even become a monster.\u201D</p><p>Archer of Red departed, and Caster watched her leave. At some unknown point, Rider of Red had come to stand behind Caster.</p><p>\u201CA mouth that runs off so much can be a nuisance, you know.\u201D</p><p>Caster turned around at Rider\u2019s sharp voice\u2014and laughed.</p><p>\u201CHahaha. After all, the only weapons I have are daggers of words!\u201D</p><p>Rider didn\u2019t believe that this man had given advice to the troubled Archer out of the kindness of his heart. Caster was clearly planning something. The problem was that his intentions were unclear.</p><p>Perhaps he simply found it amusing to mislead her with words\u2026 actually, that was quite possible.</p><p>\u201CMore importantly, how about you go comfort Archer-dono yourself, Rider-dono?\u201D</p><p>Caster\u2019s words were correct. It was true that it was important for Rider to soothe Archer of Red in her current dangerous state. But there a matter that took priority over that. It was something he had to ask Caster in front of him.</p><p>\u201CHmph. I\u2019ll go comfort nee-san later. What I\u2019m more concerned about is\u2014\u201D</p><p>\u201CWhat are we waiting for, you mean?\u201D</p><p>\u201CThat\u2019s right. You said you had to make preparations, Caster. Preparations for what? \u2026The Black camp is going to arrive here sooner or later. It doesn\u2019t seem like you\u2019re preparing any countermeasures against them.\u201D</p><p>\u201CNaturally. In the first place, preparations for that are being taken care of by Assassin\u2014our dear empress.\u201D</p><p>\u201CSo it seems.\u201D</p><p>The Hanging Gardens were a Noble Phantasm, and its owner was that unbearably unlikable Assassin of Red.</p><p>She had probably already made a plan for dealing with any attacks against them. Then, just what on earth was Caster, who shouldn\u2019t be capable of using magecraft, doing right now?</p><p>\u201CEven if I cannot use magecraft, as a Servant of the Caster class, I have a technique to weave \u2018miracles\u2019. Right now, I\u2019m in the midst of making preparations for it, you could say.\u201D</p><p>\u201CMiracles\u2014huh?\u201D</p><p>In other words, he meant his Noble Phantasm. Perhaps, like these Hanging Gardens, it required necessary materials or conditions, or perhaps it needed time to activate.</p><p>Either way, it was probably something not for battle, but to break out of the deadlock of this situation\u2014thus Rider concluded.</p><p>\u201CNow then, I will be on my way\u2014ah, wait a minute. Speaking of which, Rider-dono. Archer of Black is your teacher Chiron, is he not?\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2026What about it?\u201D</p><p>\u201CNo, I just wanted to ask how you have come to terms with the fate of clashing against your former teacher, even if you\u2019re both Servants now.\u201D</p><p>\u201CDo you want to know?\u201D</p><p>\u201CQuite,\u201D Caster replied with a nod. Without hesitating, Rider of Red materialized his beloved spear and pointed it at Caster.</p><p>\u201CYou wouldn\u2019t understand even in a hundred years.\u201D</p><p>Rider\u2019s stern gaze radiated blatant killing intent. Rider of Red wasn\u2019t a patient person at all. Regardless of the situation, any further mockery would cost Caster his life.</p><p>And, with it unclear whether or not he was aware of this, Caster calmly shrugged.</p><p>\u201CSo it\u2019s like that. The pride and soul of noble warriors cannot be spoken of in words. In other words, you\u2019re filled with such delight and sorrow to be facing each other as warriors that you cannot express it in mere words!\u201D</p><p>\u201CYou really don\u2019t listen to people at all, do you!?\u201D</p><p>\u2014And, even more annoyingly, when he heard his incredibly complex and indescribable feelings put into words like this, they became unexpectedly simple and clear.</p><p>\u201CDamn it, this is giving me a headache.\u201D</p><p>Scratching his head in frustration, Rider made his spear vanish. I\u2019ll go make Lancer listen to my complaints, Rider decided as he turned his back on Caster\u2014but he was called out to once again.</p><p>\u201CEventually, I will carve your story into writing as well. So I have a question. Should it be a tragedy, or a comedy?\u201D</p><p>Too fed up with threaten Caster again with his spear, Rider replied immediately.</p><p>\u201CIt\u2019s my life. Interpret it however you want. But, well\u2014\u201D</p><p>Suddenly, Rider\u2019s past flashed through his mind. He had been born the child of a hero and a goddess, was separated from his mother at a young age, learned, fought, love, hated, and died in battle.</p><p>That was probably something that could be expressed in words. With the infinite words that Shakespeare could spin, he could probably speak of and expose even Rider\u2019s true heart.</p><p>However, in the end, that was merely a story.</p><p>No matter how accurately it was expressed in words, his life belonged to him alone. That\u2019s why it was all the same to him whether it was a comedy or a tragedy.</p><p>Therefore, all that was left to decide was Rider\u2019s own preference.</p><p>\u201CMake it a comedy. So ridiculous it makes people laugh. In fact, dying because only my heel is human and it was shot with an arrow is already far beyond ridiculous!\u201D</p><p>Rider heartily laughed off his own life. Seeing that, Caster\u2019s smile vanished, and he deeply bowed his head.</p><p>\u201CAs you wish.\u201D</p><p>Even if he had some troubles, Rider believed himself to be fortunate.</p><p>At the very least, this second life of his wasn\u2019t filled with only bad things. There was someone he had wished to surpass in the past. The great sage who taught many heroes and knew all manner of martial arts and wisdom.</p><p>There was a hero who once had wondered whether he would be able to fight and surpass that man one day.</p><p>It was a wish Rider had left behind at some point during his days on the battlefield. But\u2014his wish was now granted. Since it was granted, he treated it as fortunate.</p><p>However\u2014Rider of Red still had doubts over whether or not Shirou Kotomine\u2014no, Amakusa Shirou Tokisada\u2019s wish was truly enough to save the world.</p><p>He understood the reasoning. It was flawlessly correct. Rider, who understood human karma quite well, even now deemed that Shirou\u2019s plan was worthy for him to devote his spear in support.</p><p>But\u2026 even so, he had doubts. It was literally a revolution against the human species. There was no predicting what would become of the world afterwards.</p><p>But, at the very least, his Master believed in it. It was the conclusion he had reached after many decades. Most likely, he had already experienced the doubts that Rider was feeling.</p><p>Was it too fast or too slow? It was a problem that even Heroic Spirits couldn\u2019t reach a conclusion on.</p><p>\u2026Amakusa Shirou Tokisada must have seen hell before. He must have certainly witnessed that scene of every single human in his sight sight being massacred. And, even so, he still wanted to save all of humanity.</p><p>That\u2019s why Rider of Red decided it was fine to acknowledge him as his Master.</p><p>He didn\u2019t think that was wrong. He didn\u2019t, but\u2014</p><p>He still had some slight hesitation he couldn\u2019t get rid of. Rider was certain these feelings wouldn\u2019t disappear until he knew that the salvation of humanity had been correctly brought about.</p><hr><p>Each of the Red Servants had been given their own rooms within the Hanging Gardens. Naturally, they could rest by going into spiritual form, but there were many Servants who preferred to stay materialized. Especially when there were no worries in regards to their prana supply.</p><p>However, the interior design of the rooms was quite cold and blunt. To Servants, who did not require sleep or food, personal rooms were simply for protecting their privacy. And even that privacy was almost completely useless considering the role they were summoned to this world for.</p><p>However, right now, Archer of Red needed to be alone.</p><p>She sat on the bed and threw off her leather gauntlets\u2014and then she looked at her discolored right arm. There was a black bruise like a curled snake twining around the skin of her arm.</p><p>It neither hurt nor inconvenienced her movements. But Archer could tell. This was a \u2018curse\u2019 of extremely high purity. Most likely, it was from that darkness which had swallowed her up when she killed Assassin of Black\u2019s Master.</p><p>Assassin of Black\u2019s repulsive past. The flocks of children, the grudge of the unborn fetuses. Right before Assassin of Black died and dispersed, this curse was probably engraved in Archer.</p><p>Of course, it would be easy to cut it off. Though Archer had no means to dispel curses, their group\u2019s Assassin had the abilities of a Caster. There was also the dual Master-Servant Shirou Kotomine to rely on.</p><p>If she asked for their aid, it probably wouldn\u2019t be hard to restore her right arm.</p><p>But\u2014Archer couldn\u2019t choose that option no matter what. Naturally, she didn\u2019t want to rely on Assassin\u2019s help. The idea of showing any weakness to that woman wasn\u2019t even funny enough to be a joke.</p><p>And Shirou Kotomine was technically Assassin\u2019s Master. So she was naturally reluctant to request his help.</p><p>\u2026No, those were all excuses. Archer understood. She had to accept this curse. This curse was the resentment of the children she loved more than anything else.</p><p>Fortunately, there was little pain since it was merely the work of low-class spirits.</p><p>And she didn\u2019t mind even if this curse brought about her own destruction. This was a punishment. A punishment she had to accept.</p><p>She wrapped bandages around her rotten-smelling right arm, and decided to leave it alone with that.</p><p>There was one thing that Archer hadn\u2019t noticed. It was true that what possessed her right arm were low-class vengeful spirits, too weak to have any effect on Archer herself. After all, Servants were the spirits of heroes who stood at the pinnacle of all spirits.</p><p>In the first place, it had been possible for Archer to reject the possession. The moment the vengeful spirits entered her arm, she could have even devoured them as sustenance without any danger to herself.</p><p>But she had refused to do that. In other words, she wished for \u2018those children\u2019 to maintain their consciousness. Of course, these vengeful spirits did not have any high-level intellect. They simply continued whispering their wish.</p><p>We want to go back, we want to go back, we want to go back. We want to go back inside Mother\u2019s belly.</p><p>They could only whisper. They were vengeful spirits that should have been completely harmless. But Archer of Red felt ashamed at those whispers and felt compassion and pity.</p><p>Those were feelings that one must never have when facing vengeful spirits who only made appeals for their final wish. That compassion stirred up her emotions, and gradually made her hatred swell up towards both herself, who couldn\u2019t save them, and that holy maiden, who didn\u2019t save them.</p><p>\u201CI don\u2019t care.\u201D</p><p>But Archer of Red accepted that hatred without hesitation. She couldn\u2019t help cherishing those ephemeral, destructive feelings.</p><p>The more she hated herself and that woman\u2014the more she could prove and believe in her own love.</p><p>So, for now, she would sharpen her fangs. In order to kill that false saint, Archer of Red continued to earnestly nurture her hatred.</p><hr><p>Caster of Red watched Rider depart, and then headed off to his study. The Servant Caster possessed the class skill [Territory Creation]. This skill\u2019s rank changed depending on the Servant\u2019s ability, bloodline or occupation. If they were famous as a magus, they could even create a Temple, which surpassed a Workshop.</p><p>Caster of Red wasn\u2019t technically a magus\u2026 in the first place, someone like a writer didn\u2019t need a Temple or a Workshop. What he required was a study for writing.</p><p>Within the study that Caster of Red had constructed, there were mountains of books, a typewriter that Shirou had gotten for him (he had immediately abandoned it after getting it), a desktop computer (he had immediately abandoned this as well)\u2014and a writing desk with a pen and paper on it.</p><p>It was a room quite disconnected from his class name as Caster. It truly was a study. Of course, if you considered that the piles of scrap paper in the room\u2019s garbage can were all part of Shakespeare\u2019s new work, it was a mystical room in a certain sense.</p><p>Caster of Red took out one of the books on the bookshelves. The book\u2019s title was [William Shakespeare\u2019s Comedies, Historical Dramas and Tragedies]\u2014a book compilation commonly known as the \u2018First Folio\u2019.</p><p>\u2026However, this book wasn\u2019t something that Shakespeare had published himself. His friend had merely collected together his works after he died. In the first place, there were no manuscripts made from his personal handwriting.</p><p>After looking it over, he took out another, bulky leather-bound book beside it. The book had no title, and even the author\u2019s name wasn\u2019t inscribed on it.</p><p>The book he held now was different from the earlier one. This was a genuine book personally handwritten by him. But\u2014he still hadn\u2019t finished writing it.</p><p>He cherishingly moved his fingers across where the text came to an interrupted halt.</p><p>\u201C\u2014Now then, it\u2019s certainly been following the path of a masterpiece until this point, but\u2026\u201D</p><p>The protagonist needed to go through many hardships. A life full of smooth sailing from beginning to end should be left to any average person you could find anywhere. A protagonist\u2019s story needed dramatic parts. Whether the story was a tragedy, a comedy, or something else entirely, unique people had equally unique lives.</p><p>In that sense, Shirou Kotomine was infinitely close to Caster\u2019s ideal. Regardless of whether or not his wish was granted, his end would no doubt be impressive.</p><p>Contained in these bookshelves were books recounting the stories of all the people involved in the Great Holy Grail War.</p><p>They included both those who had already lost and vanished and those who had been killed off-hand. Naturally, among them was the book of that country girl\u2014Jeanne d\u2019Arc. He admitted that he had been slightly wrong to utterly make fun of her when he was alive just because she had been England\u2019s enemy.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t some pitiful, mad country girl. It would have been far better for her if that\u2019s all she was. She was someone who understood her own sins and yet still didn\u2019t stop being a saint\u2014a girl who fought against despair.</p><p>\u201CWhen classifying those known as saints, they can be properly described as those who save people and fight not out of personal desire, but against the despair of this evil world. In that case, regardless of the end results, the two of them are naturally and unmistakably saints.\u201D</p><p>To save his people, to save her homeland; regardless of the scale, they had stood up and fought.</p><p>\u201CHowever, their paths ended up being different. My Master, who acts to save all of humanity, and the Holy Grail\u2019s protector, who moves to stop that. To think their good intentions would be turned inside out into ill will towards each other, how tragic! [Honor travels in a strait so narrow, Where one but goes abreast.]\u201D</p><p>Their confrontation with each other couldn\u2019t be avoided, and their tale was so fascinating. Even though they were both trying to save people, they were enemies who had no choice but to kill one another.</p><p>\u201CI\u2019d like it if the two of them squared off against each other at the very end, but\u2014\u201D</p><p>Caster closed the book and took out another one. This book was different from the last extravagant leather-bound one; it was a white and bluntly plain book.</p><p>This was the book of that homunculus. He should have been immature, weak, and commonplace. No, even now, he was still commonplace. The only unique thing about him was the power he had received. The choices of those surrounding him had merely pushed the trait of being unique onto him.</p><p>But\u2026 but.</p><p>Even so, he continued to survive in the Great Holy Grail War. Though he had a short life, he chose to fight and desperately struggled. His short days alive were far too condensed to be called a human lifetime. Of course, homunculi were given knowledge from the moment they were born\u2014or rather, they were artificial lifeforms that were born with knowledge. Most of them were boring, ordinary and uninteresting mass-produced beings.</p><p>That\u2019s why the abnormality of this homunculus stood out so much.</p><p>He was neither boring nor ordinary. It was just that he wasn\u2019t conspicuous within this Great Holy Grail War when all the Servants were far more abnormal than him\u2014but that\u2019s what made him so amiss.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t a hero. But he wasn\u2019t an ordinary being either. He was a pitiful boy trifled with by fate, but he wasn\u2019t bothered by that.</p><p>In that case, what was his role in this Great Holy Grail War?</p><p>To act as recognition of the services of the holy maiden? To be a Master or Servant that was part of his side\u2019s forces? Or perhaps\u2014he was the one who would square off against the person at the center of this battle, Shirou Kotomine\u2014against Amakusa Shirou Tokisada?</p><p>\u201C\u2026Hmm, no, that\u2019s impossible.\u201D</p><p>The only one who was equal to Amakusa Shirou Tokisada was the holy maiden Jeanne d\u2019Arc. Everyone\u2019s awareness of that was unchanged. Most likely, the two of them would square off again in the final decisive battle.</p><p>There was no room for the homunculus to wedge himself in\u2026 No, he might be thrown in as part of the enemy forces, but he himself shouldn\u2019t be able to meddle in the part which touched upon the foundation of this war.</p><p>But even that possibility was about to vanish.</p><p>His Master\u2019s plan to save humanity would soon begin. Would Shirou Kotomine become a savior? Or\u2014would he fail to save people once more and become a pitiful clown? Either way, Caster had no doubt it would be a tragic, comic and extremely enjoyable story.</p><hr><p>Lancer of Red was in the room where the five former Masters\u2014Rottweil Berzinsky, Gene Rum, the Pentel Brothers and Feend vor Sembren were relaxing.</p><p>The five of them sat equal distances apart around a circular table. They weren\u2019t actually confined here, but they talked while looking up at the ceiling with idiotic expressions.</p><p>\u201CSpeaking of which, according to what I hear, there\u2019s been a political change within the Atlas Academy\u2014\u201D</p><p>\u201CLook at the minute detail of the ritual recorded on this scroll. It\u2019s expensive, but it\u2019s worth it\u2014\u201D</p><p>\u201CYes, quite right. Yes, yeah, exactly\u2014\u201D</p><p>\u201CAh, I\u2019m looking forward to the auction so much. Just how long does the airplane intend to make me wait\u2014\u201D</p><p>\u201CIt\u2019s almost time to gradually begin the inheritance of our family\u2019s Crest, but my son is no good. He lacks the ambition to be a magus.\u201D</p><p>There was already no coherence in their discussion. They were trapped between sanity and madness. They were completely sane, and if they were truly in the same situation they thought they were, they would certainly react and speak the same as they did now.</p><p>However, this was the room that had been given to them by Shirou Kotomine and his Servant. Before they had summoned their own Servants, they had drunk poison prepared by Assassin of Red, and were lured into the world of madness while still remaining sane.</p><p>Their mastered mental defenses were mere paper-thin armor against Assassin of Red. They hadn\u2019t been killed\u2014but they had no freedom either. They simply continued to exist in this room.</p><p>\u201C\u2014So you came here again.\u201D</p><p>Assassin of Red idly emerged from out of the shadows. Lancer\u2019s eyes couldn\u2019t be deceived. She simply spoke her thoughts to Lancer. The Assassin standing here was merely an illusion as well.</p><p>\u201CShirou Kotomine\u2019s orders were to guard these Hanging Gardens. There are currently no signs of any attacks. The enemy will most likely arrive tomorrow night. Until then, I will remain here unless my former Master instructs otherwise.\u201D</p><p>The empress\u2019 face scowled in displeasure at Lancer of Red\u2019s words.</p><p>Lancer of Red was the only one among the other three Servants who hadn\u2019t acknowledged Shirou as his Master. Both Rider and Archer had abandoned their former Masters in this state of affairs, but Lancer alone still guarded them for the simple reason that one of them had summoned him.</p><p>Assassin of Red didn\u2019t particularly care about that. Either way, in the end, Lancer of Red, like the others, was a pawn under their control.</p><p>But the problem was the five former Masters. They had drunk poison, causing their minds to roam through another world\u2014but they were sane. In order to convince them to give up their Command Spells without their Servants noticing any abnormality, Semiramis had to avoid directly harming them.</p><p>Though she was Semiramis, the world\u2019s oldest poisoner, she was unable to bring about satisfactory results under such unfavorable conditions. In other words, she didn\u2019t know when they might wake up from their dream worlds.</p><p>Rider and Archer wouldn\u2019t side with them at this point. But what about Lancer?</p><p>Even though he hadn\u2019t exchanged a single word with his Master and the Master rights had been transferred to Shirou, he still continued to be a loyal Servant.</p><p>It was only natural that Assassin of Red\u2019s mistrust would rise. If his Master awoke and gave an order, Lancer would undoubtedly betray them. Regardless of what the situation was.</p><p>Therefore, after a certain point, Assassin of Red had planned to kill these five, whom no one was interested in anymore. It was something trivial, amounting to the act of clearing away scattered garbage at best.</p><p>But Lancer had stood in her way.</p><p>\u201CYou all may think of these five however you wish. But as long as my Master is here, I won\u2019t let you have your way with them.\u201D</p><p>He had dispassionately declared that he would protect the five of them. Since then, he had continued obstructing Assassin of Red\u2019s plot even while doing the extremely boring job of guarding the Hanging Gardens.</p><p>Of course, forcefully breaking through would be simple. Within these Hanging Gardens, Assassin of Red\u2019s power and authority was truly absolute. She could restrain Lancer of Red and kill the five of them with just a single hand. However, that wasn\u2019t a secret assassination, but an act of battle.</p><p>\u2026In other words, there was the danger that the deed could be exposed to her Master and the other Servants. So the issue wasn\u2019t in the means, but rather that it wasn\u2019t something that should be displayed openly for others to see. Therefore, Assassin of Red had reluctantly withdrawn every time she found Lancer in her way.</p><p>Even so, after repeating this so many times, she was becoming irritated. Assassin of Red spoke up.</p><p>\u201CJust give up already, Lancer. They won\u2019t awaken in time for the coming battle, and you have no obligation to listen to their orders.\u201D</p><p>There were unconcealed thorns in her voice. Rider and Archer were easy to understand in comparison; they were both stereotypical heroes. Foolish heroes, who intolerably prided themselves in their strength and skill, carried a great sense of honor and pride, and ran across battlefields.</p><p>But\u2014Lancer of Red, Karna, was somehow different from them. Though he should have been a perfect hero in terms of his bloodline, history and everything else about him, he was distinctly unlike the many other heroes Semiramis knew.</p><p>\u201CThe relationship between a Master and Servant has nothing to do with obligation. It\u2019s a contract and a bond. Assassin, even you are not cooperating with Shirou Kotomine out of mere obligation.\u201D</p><p>\u201COf course not. He and I are joined together by the contract between Master and Servant. However, Lancer. Your Master is Shirou, not that man there.\u201D</p><p>Assassin said that and pointed at the man who Lancer of Red should have respected as his Master.</p><p>She provoked him with a scorn-filled laugh that no normal hero would be able to endure without flaring up. But Lancer didn\u2019t show any signs of anger at her smile and nodded with an attitude that, rather than solemn, was simply too serious and honest.</p><p>\u201CYour words are certainly correct, Assassin. The only ones who are truly joined together as Master and Servant within our camp are you and your Master. Your Master uses you and you use your Master. But there is service and trust in that relationship. You can\u2019t betray him; it\u2019s probably the best you can do to simply imagine doing so.\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2014\u201D</p><p>Assassin became speechless at Lancer\u2019s words. Just now, hadn\u2019t this Heroic Spirit pointed out [something] deep inside her far too smoothly?</p><p>After a short silence, Assassin of Red slowly opened her mouth.</p><p>\u201C\u2026What, did you, just say?\u201D</p><p>\u201CNothing really. You can\u2019t betray your Master and he trusts you as well, so I was merely complimenting you for being the ideal Master and Servant pair.\u201D</p><p>Assassin of Red glared at Lancer. \u201CHow unexpected,\u201D Lancer said as he tilted his head in puzzlement. He had certainly been praising her. He had intended to praise her. However\u2026</p><p>\u201CWhat\u2026 ridiculous nonsense are you saying?\u201D</p><p>\u201CIt\u2019s not ridiculous. You two are ideal as Master and Servant. Your Master won\u2019t betray you either. Not because you will repay betrayal with the greatest punishment, but because he understands that it\u2019s important not to betray each other as the best possible means.\u201D</p><p>\u2014He wouldn\u2019t betray her.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t help but feel that those words were something very precious.</p><p>Ignoring Assassin\u2019s turmoil, Lancer spoke further.</p><p>\u201CI won\u2019t tell you to agree, but at least understand, Assassin. Survival of the fittest is the providence of this world\u2014however, we are not beasts. There should be some kind of humanity which covers our instincts. And that humanity takes the form of various different ethics\u2026 My ethics demand that I not betray my Master. That is who I am.\u201D</p><p>Lancer said that while knowing full well about Assassin of Red\u2019s seemingly useless paranoia and Archer of Red\u2019s overly cold logic.</p><p>\u201CI will protect them here. That\u2019s all I have to say.\u201D</p><p>The illusion of Assassin staggered, showing how deeply shocked her true self sitting on the throne was.</p><p>\u201C\u2026I, see. Fine, do as you wish.\u201D</p><p>\u201CThank you, Assassin.\u201D</p><p>Just before her illusionary phantom disappeared, she turned back to Lancer and asked a question.</p><p>\u201C\u2014Hey, do you really think I won\u2019t betray my Master?\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2026That\u2019s a foolish question. Assassin, are you such a paranoid monomaniac that you would want to kill the person you adore?\u201D</p><p>At those words, the illusionary Assassin lost her composure and became greatly flustered just before vanishing from the room.</p><hr><p>Lancer of Red gave a murmur of relief. Assassin probably wouldn\u2019t aim to kill these five after this.</p><p>\u201C\u2014It seems my duty is finished. Master, I was unable to exchange a single word with you, but I wish you good fortune.\u201D</p><p>\u201CYou listening? The trick to making good coffee is\u2026\u201D</p><p>Nodding to his former Master who was staring at empty air and talking to an imaginary person, Lancer went into spiritual form and vanished from the room.</p><p>Meanwhile, Assassin was dumfounded as she sat alone on her throne.</p><p>\u2014You can\u2019t betray him; it\u2019s probably the best you can do to simply imagine doing so.</p><p>What thoughtless words. Finally, an emotion like anger began boiling up within her.</p><p>She seethed so much that her blood was boiling.</p><p>\u201CI can\u2019t betray him? Me, Semiramis\u2014?\u201D</p><p>Ridiculous. The reason she didn\u2019t betray him was only because their objectives aligned. He would save humanity, and she would become the one who controlled humanity after they were granted salvation.</p><p>The one to assume the throne would be her alone. The rest were all her \u201Clivestock\u201D. It wasn\u2019t like she would oppress them; she would merely control and rule them. That would be easily granted once she obtained a physical body, and as long as the Greater Grail was within these Hanging Gardens, there was no need to worry about running out of prana either.</p><p>All that was left was to simply settle things with the Black camp. Once everything was over, it would be more than possible for her to betray her Master.</p><p>Don\u2019t make me laugh, Lancer. I can betray him. I merely have no need to betray him.</p><p>In fact, she could betray him even right now. It would be simple for her to erase his will, steal his rights as a Master and make him her puppet.</p><p>That\u2019s right. There\u2019s no need for me to follow along with that boy\u2019s whims. I can steal everything from him. Just like always, just like I\u2019ve done countless times, I\u2019ll make everything of his mine using my words, fingertips and sweet poison\u2014</p><p>She imagined it. His face when he was betrayed. After turning shocked like an idiot and gradually understanding the truth, his face would twist hideously in anger. And then, he would cry and scream in sorrow\u2014</p><p>\u201C\u2026No, that\u2019s wrong. He wouldn\u2019t show sorrow like that.\u201D</p><p>Most likely, he would just widen his eyes slightly in surprise. And then, her Master\u2014would surely smile.</p><p>It didn\u2019t work out. My sixty years of effort came to nothing.</p><p>And yet, he wouldn\u2019t lament. Because Shirou Kotomine had already abandoned any regrets four hundred years ago. From the moment he forgave everything and swore to save everyone, he threw away everything he had.</p><p>He wouldn\u2019t become angry at her betrayal. He would simply deal with it and take appropriate measures.</p><p>That was a sad way of life. Just as scorn was unavoidable with betrayal, he was scorned each time he was betrayed and had the things he built trampled down. But, no matter how many times it repeated, he would simply rebuild again from the beginning.</p><p>When he was betrayed, he wouldn\u2019t seem like the betrayed one at all. Having already discarded all despair, he would simply leave behind the betrayer and move forward.</p><p>Assassin, who stabbed others from behind, could never catch up with him.</p><p>She could only watch his back as he left.</p><p>She felt no emotions like sadness or frustration\u2014but rather a vague loneliness like a wispy cloud.</p><p><img src="https://i1.lensdump.com/i/1sfPei.jpg" alt=""></p><h2 id="chapter-2" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#chapter-2" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Chapter 2</h2><hr><p>The Masters and Servants of the Black Camp had once more gathered in the castle\u2019s conference room.</p><p>After much trouble, Assassin of Black had been taken down, thereby getting rid of any lingering worries before they departed. There would be no problem leaving the other Yggdmillennia clan members to deal with and cover up the injuries from the fog. The fact that the children that Assassin had controlled were all alive and well was a silver lining within it all.</p><p>\u201CWe\u2019ll leave Trifas and head to the capital Bucharest at noon tomorrow. Once there, we\u2019ll board an airplane and commence our air-raid against the Hanging Gardens.\u201D</p><p>\u2014So Fiore\u2019s declaration shouldn\u2019t have been surprising, but\u2026</p><p>\u201CNee-san. An air-raid means attacking the ground from the air, so I don\u2019t think that phrasing applies in this case, strictly speaking.\u201D</p><p>\u201CMuh. I-It doesn\u2019t matter. Caules, make sure you finish all your preparations in time.\u201D</p><p>\u201CWell, I will, but are we really going by air? Using a normal plane?\u201D</p><p>Fiore nodded with a frown.</p><p>\u201CAfter all, no matter what plans we think up, it\u2019s impossible to avoid being intercepted by the enemy, right? In that case, it\u2019s more efficient to go there using the cheapest method and disguising ourselves as much as possible.\u201D</p><p>\u201CHey, hey! The airplane! I can pilot the airplane!\u201D</p><p>Rider of Black enthusiastically raised his hand\u2014but Fiore shook her head.</p><p>\u201CWe\u2019ll have a golem pilot the plane. We can\u2019t have a Servant\u2019s hands occupied with piloting it in the middle of battle.\u201D</p><p>\u201CBut I have a rank of A+ in my Riding skill! I wanted to show off how I can ride anything and not just my Hippogriff, you know!?\u201D</p><p>\u201CUfufu. Such a shameful motive gives me all the more reason to say no\u2026 Besides, if you\u2019re not riding your Hippogriff when things turn bad, you won\u2019t be able to protect you Master, right?\u201D</p><p>\u201CUgh, that\u2019s true, but\u2026\u201D</p><p>\u201CThe members going to the Hanging Gardens are Archer of Black, Rider of Black, Ruler, the boy who can become Saber of Black\u2026 and me as well.\u201D</p><p>\u201CBut Master\u2014\u201D</p><p>Archer of Black tried to object, but Fiore coldly refused.</p><p>\u201CWe\u2019ve gone over this, Archer. I also have my pride as the head of Yggdmillennia. And we can\u2019t risk the possibility of my prana being cut off from you in the midst of battle either.\u201D</p><p>Archer silently withdrew his protest. He appeared to understand from Fiore\u2019s obstinate expression that his words wouldn\u2019t change her mind. Fiore continued speaking to persuade them everyone else as well.</p><p>\u201C\u2026I must accompany you all in case the worst should happen. I have a duty as the head of Yggdmillennia. Additionally, unlike a normal Holy Grail War, fourteen Servants were summoned this time. It\u2019s possible that the Path between Master and Servant is weakened as a result. It\u2019s not a good idea to become separated from each other.\u201D</p><p>In a Holy Grail War, the relationship between Master and Servant was, logically, the same as between magus and familiar. There existed a Line connecting the familiar and magus, which was essentially unaffected by distance. However, the prana channel between Master and Servant was a pseudo-version of this Line that was created during the summoning. Prana flowed across the Line, but Fiore conjectured that it might become cut off if they became too distanced from each other. Even more so if they left Romania, the base of Yggdmillennia\u2019s magecraft.</p><p>In other words, it would be the same as if the Master didn\u2019t exist for the Servant. Unless they had the skill [Independent Action], Servants wouldn\u2019t be able to last even a day in that condition.</p><p>\u201CNee-san, me too\u2014\u201D</p><p>Fiore quickly spoke up to cut Caules off.</p><p>\u201CCaules. You must remain here\u2026 You are the successor of the Forvedge family. I can\u2019t allow you to be exposed to danger.\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2014That\u2019s wrong.\u201D</p><p>When Caules replied like that, Fiore glared at him with cold eyes. Her eyes weren\u2019t those of his older sister, but of a magus.</p><p>But, though that would normally be enough to make him withdraw his opinion, Caules glared right back at her without retreating a single step.</p><p>\u201C\u2026Caules. We will talk about this later.\u201D</p><p>As if to shake off the bad atmosphere hanging over the conference, Ruler spoke up to ask a question.</p><p>\u201CAn airplane, huh\u2026? I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything wrong with it in terms of speed, but have you thought up any countermeasures against making us an easy target for the enemy when we approach them?\u201D</p><p>Fiore frowned and pressed a hand to her head as if very troubled.</p><p>\u201CWe have come up with three tentative measures. If you\u2019ll all listen, then\u2014\u201D</p><p>Fiore laid out the full details of the strategy she had refined together with Archer. Among the three measures she had devised, two of them were extremely valid and effective plans that anyone could think of.</p><p>The problem was the last one.</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s a bit forceful, but it\u2019s not a bad idea\u2019\u2014so judged Rider of Black. Sieg also agreed to it, saying, \u2018It will slightly raise our chances of reaching the Hanging Gardens.\u2019 When Archer of Black heard the idea, he was also satisfied, saying, \u2018It will reduce our disadvantage in the air even if only by a little bit.\u2019</p><p>And lastly, Ruler, the only one among them who understood the common sense of regular society, became pale-faced when she heard it.</p><p>\u201C\u2026Ruler, is something wrong?\u201D</p><p>Fiore tilted her head and asked her curiously. Ruler breathed out a sigh and shook her head.</p><p>\u201CNo, it\u2019s nothing. I just painfully realized the gulf that lies between magi and normal humans.\u201D</p><p>Even with this plan, though, they would only be able to get close to Assassin\u2019s enormous Noble Phantasm, the Hanging Gardens of Babylon.</p><p>\u201CIt still isn\u2019t enough. I\u2019d like at least one more countermeasure to have in play.\u201D</p><p>Sieg groaned at the difficulty of what Fiore asked.</p><p>In the first place, the preconditions were harsh. An impregnable floating fortress, along with Atalanta, Karna, Achilles and Semiramis\u2014all of them Servants of the strongest rank.</p><p>The problem wasn\u2019t a matter of winning or losing, but how to feasibly approach that floating fortress\u2014</p><p>Ruler raised her hand first. She cleared her throat, gathering everyone\u2019s attention towards her.</p><p>\u201CHow about preparing a second airplane loaded with explosives and enhanced through consecration and making it dive and crash into the gardens from a high altitude?\u201D</p><p>Ruler, who had run through numerous battlefields, proposed quite an extreme plan.</p><p>\u201C\u2026H-How bold.\u201D</p><p>Fiore stiffened. Archer of Black exclaimed \u201COh!\u201D in admiration and clapped his hands.</p><p>\u201CBut the Hanging Gardens is an autonomous moving fortress. It\u2019s most likely Assassin of Red\u2019s greatest and most prized mystery. Even if you consecrate them, I have doubts about how much damage mere explosives will be able to do\u2026\u201D</p><p>\u201CHowever, if we don\u2019t manage to damage it at least a little, even infiltrating the gardens will be impossible. The situation is far different from the last battle. This time, they\u2019ll definitely counterattack with all their might.\u201D</p><p>Ruler was correct. Back when they were stealing the Greater Grail, the situation hadn\u2019t allowed the Red camp to ambush the enemy Servants while the Hanging Gardens was so close to the surface. In the first place, Shirou had intentionally led the Black Servants and Ruler into the Gardens back then.</p><p>This time would be different. The Red camp would move to eliminate the Black camp with all their might.</p><p>\u201CEven if we use that plan, it still isn\u2019t enough.\u201D</p><p>After Archer of Black stated that, the gathered Servants, Masters and even the homunculi standing by for orders exchanged various ideas, but none of them were worth pursuing.</p><p>\u201CNot a plane, but strategic bombing aircraft\u2026 Hmm, either way, we need a weapon with great destructive power\u2026 missiles\u2026 or a bunker-buster\u2026 or, though the name is disrespectful, perhaps the [Rods of God]\u2026\u201D</p><p>Fiore and most of the others couldn\u2019t understand even half of the things that Ruler murmured. Only Gordes trembled in fear, saying, \u201CDoes this holy woman intend to end the world\u2026?\u201D</p><p>\u201CHmm? In that case, how about this homun\u2014\u201D</p><p>The instant Caules tried to point at the homunculus Sieg after suddenly thinking of something, Ruler glared at him. Caules frantically hid his hand.</p><p>Sieg then raised his own hand and spoke up.</p><p>\u201CI really don\u2019t mind using my Noble Phantasm as Saber of Black\u2026 But, if I end up clashing against the Hanging Gardens\u2019 defense functions\u2014in other words, against Assassin of Red\u2019s spells, the Gardens will likely survive the attack even if I don\u2019t lose outright.\u201D</p><p>Sieg could accurately calculate the power of that spell attack which Ruler blocked with her holy flag. If that was all there was, he was confident that he could overwhelm and beat it with Saber of Black\u2019s Balmung.</p><p>However, they had learned from Rider of Black that the Hanging Gardens had eleven interception spells prepared and ready for Assassin of Red to fire at any time. If the spell that Ruler had blocked was a \u2018one\u2019, then it was basically multiplied by eleven when fired in combination.</p><p>Even then, Sieg probably wouldn\u2019t lose, but he wasn\u2019t confident that he could defeat it either. The odds were likely that it would turn into a contest of power\u2014clashing against each other with all their might and merely resulting in both of them exhausting themselves.</p><p>And, though the Red camp could afford it, that was the worst possible outcome for the Black camp.</p><p>\u201CTurning it into a contest of power is the same as wasting Saber of Black\u2019s power. That\u2019s a very poor plan.\u201D</p><p>Archer of Black stated that, and Ruler agreed. Sieg also wanted him to use his power as little as possible. But it was also true that he wanted to help them reach the Hanging Gardens if his power was necessary.</p><p>If the odds were high that it would end up being a contest of power, then it couldn\u2019t be helped.</p><p>There were no holes in their plan itself. There weren\u2019t, but\u2014in order to reach the Gardens, they had to get through Lancer, Rider and Archer of Red\u2019s interception attacks. The Gardens also had its own defences, so taking that into account\u2014</p><p>\u201C\u2026As I thought, the odds of us surviving are low.\u201D</p><p>At Sieg\u2019s intuitive words, a gloomy silence enveloped the conference room. Just as Sieg said, even with all their plans, the odds of success were low. A plane was, in the end, merely a flying lump of metal. It would be easily torn apart by any attack from Archer\u2019s bow, Lancer\u2019s spear or Rider\u2019s chariot.</p><p>\u201C\u2014That\u2019s true. The fact that I\u2019m so inept that I can only think of something like this is the problem. However, there aren\u2019t many methods for us to oppose the Hanging Gardens.\u201D</p><p>Though it was called a \u2018garden\u2019, it was already on the level of a fortress. Even the Fortress of Millennia, which had required hundreds of years to build, was but a fragile balloon in comparison.</p><p>Assassin of Red\u2014Semiramis. The legendary empress born from the goddess Derketo and a human man. Famed for her peerless beauty after she grew up, she was sometimes regarded as an incarnation of the goddess Ishtar.</p><p>She could probably put up a good match against Lancer of Red, Karna, with the strength of her mysteries. And then there was her Noble Phantasm, the Hanging Gardens. Even if it was a temporary miracle that would only last for the duration of the Great Holy Grail War, airplanes, which were the crystallization of modern science and technology, were nothing when compared to it.</p><p>\u201CIt\u2019s fine, it\u2019s fine! At the very least, I can protect Master and one other person!\u201D</p><p>In order to break the gloomy atmosphere, Rider of Black spoke up in a bright voice. His words weren\u2019t a simple show of courage. They were full of confidence, truly the kind of words that only a hero could shout.</p><p>\u201CYou mean with your Hippogriff?\u201D</p><p>\u201CYeah! I couldn\u2019t display its special ability in the previous battle, but this time I\u2019ll use it for sure! After all, you\u2019re my Master now! Ahaha.\u201D</p><p>Rider laughed while slapping Sieg\u2019s back repeatedly. Ruler felt the atmosphere in the conference room flip around and become half-amazed, yet also brighter. Those words were quite carefree, but they were sincere as well. Rider hadn\u2019t tried to forcibly cheer them up; he was a warrior who truly thought that way from the bottom of his heart. That was enough for the atmosphere to change.</p><p>\u201CAnd besides, I\u2019m completely impervious to magecraft! I have a tome that can counter any kind of spell!\u201D</p><p>After all, Rider of Black had an abundance of reliable Noble Phantasms to make up for his own weak abilities.</p><p>\u201CWell, I did forget its true name, so it\u2019s can\u2019t display its real ability, though.\u201D</p><p>Yes, even if he had forgotten the Noble Phantasm\u2019s name and couldn\u2019t activate its full power\u2014\u2014</p><p>\u201CNo, please wait a second, Rider. What did you just say?\u201D</p><p>Everyone\u2019s gazes, including Sieg, converged on Rider of Black. Rider tilted his head with a puzzled expression\u2014</p><p>\u201CEh, like I said, I have a Noble Phantasm tome. I\u2019m really troubled since I\u2019ve forgotten its true name.\u201D</p><p>Looking completely untroubled in his demeanor, Rider of Black spoke cheerfully.</p><p>\u2014Rider of Black took out a book which suddenly materialized of nowhere and placed it on the conference room\u2019s table with a thud. All the magi of the group, including Fiore, Caules and Gordes, gulped at the sight of it.</p><p>\u201CThis is Astolfo\u2019s Noble Phantasm\u2026\u201D</p><p>Unlike Rider\u2019s Hippogriff or lance, which had little to do with magecraft, a grimoire like this was a familiar sight to them.</p><p>And because they were familiar with grimoires, they could comprehend the enormous magical power hidden within this tome.</p><p>\u201C\u2026I see. So the reason your Magic Resistance is only one rank below mine is because you have this.\u201D</p><p>Ruler nodded in understanding. She had certainly thought it was strange. The Magic Resistance of the Rider class was usually low-ranked, and she had never heard any legend of Astolfo originally having such a trait either.</p><p>But there was a legend about a tome that could destroy all spells, which had been given to Astolfo by a good witch. Indeed, if he always had this in his possession, he wouldn\u2019t be harmed by most spells.</p><p>\u201CYeah, it really is convenient. After all, just possessing it protects me from spells.\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2026Umm, Rider. May I ask something?\u201D</p><p>While taking a deep breath, Fiore spoke up.</p><p>\u201CThis tome can activate its true abilities by speaking its true name. According to legend, this is a grimoire that can destroy all spells, right? \u2026And you forgot its true name?\u201D</p><p>\u201CNo, actually, it\u2019s just on the tip of my tongue\u2014\u201D</p><p>\u201CRemember it, please remember it! We might be able to take down the Hanging Gardens if you do!\u201D</p><p>Fiore shook Rider\u2019s shoulders with her Bronze-Link Manipulators.</p><p>\u201CWah, wah, wawah, wawawah! Wait, wait! I\u2019ll remember! I\u2019ll remember it! No, actually, I just remember it! Really, really!\u201D</p><p>\u201CTruly!?\u201D</p><p>Not only Fiore, but even Archer and Ruler got excited and pressed near him all at once. Even someone like Rider could feel the pressure here, and he took a step back while sweating.</p><p>\u201CErr. Umm. What I remembered isn\u2019t its true name, but the requirement for me to remember it, though\u2026\u201D</p><p>\u201CRequirement\u2026?\u201D</p><p>\u201CYeah. The requirement is\u2014a moonless night. If it\u2019s on a day when there\u2019s no moon, I can definitely invoke this grimoire\u2019s true name.\u201D</p><p>Everyone exchanged glances at those words.</p><p>\u201CMoonless\u2014in other words, a new moon, huh?\u201D</p><p>Fiore wondered aloud, and her Servant Archer of Black voiced his agreement.</p><p>\u201CThe moon has been treated as a guide of madness since ancient times. If we consider that the reason that Rider\u2019s reason evaporates is due to madness, then it\u2019s only on a night when the moon his hidden that Rider\u2019s reason returns.\u201D</p><p>\u201CThe next new moon is\u2026 five days from now. What will you do, Yggdmillennia?\u201D</p><p>Sieg asked the question. In truth, their plan was to depart tomorrow, but if they waited until the next new moon, Rider would be able to activate his Noble Phantasm.</p><p>The longer they waited, the farther the Hanging Gardens would get from them. If the Red Camp managed to leave Romania\u2019s borders, the ownership of the Greater Grail would become a contested issue. Even if they managed to take back the Greater Grail outside of Romania, it would be considerably difficult to reconnect it to the land\u2019s leylines since it would be outside the territory that served as the base of Yggdmillennia\u2019s power.</p><p>The head of Yggdmillennia, Darnic, had once used the power of Nazi Germany in order to transport the Greater Grail, but the clan didn\u2019t have any such power or connections now.</p><p>Yggdmillennia\u2019s level of influence was completely different inside and outside of Romania. If they were within Yggdmillennia\u2019s territory, they might be able to gather the survivors of their clan and, if necessary, utilize Romania\u2019s government to take the Greater Grail back to the Fortress of Millennia.</p><p>But, once they took a single step outside of the country, Yggdmillennia\u2019s \u2018power\u2019 was weak. It would be impossible for them to transport the Greater Grail back. And it wasn\u2019t like the Association of Magi had given up on the Greater Grail after losing in the Great Holy Grail War.</p><p>In other words\u2014even if they won this war, the Greater Grail wouldn\u2019t return to Yggdmillennia\u2019s hands.</p><p>But, if they didn\u2019t wait five days, they would have to shoulder excessive risk in order to get back the Greater Grail.</p><p>Fiore was pressed into making a decision.</p><p>\u2026As a magus, she should go after the Greater Grail even if it meant ignoring Rider of Black\u2019s Noble Phantasm.</p><p>To reach the Root. To make Yggdmillennia\u2019s power known to the world. For the sake of those objectives, activating the Greater Grail was absolutely necessary.</p><p>What would happen if they let the Greater Grail fall out of their grasp without resistance? It would mean the end of Yggdmillennia. At the very least, letting the Greater Grail be stolen would almost certainly mean the end of her life as a magus.</p><p>As the head of Yggdmillennia, that alone was\u2014</p><p>\u201C\u2026Sorry. Please let me talk with Nee-san for a while. Sieg and all the Servants, please go back to your rooms for tonight and rest. We\u2019ll come to a decision by tomorrow.\u201D</p><p>Perhaps sensing that Fiore\u2019s thoughts were in a deadlock, Caules raised his hand and spoke up. Gordes merely said, \u201CThis isn\u2019t an issue that I have any say in anyway,\u201D and he left before any of the others.</p><p>Rider of Black seemed like he wanted to say something to the Forvedge siblings, but Sieg and Ruler grabbed his shoulders and forcibly pulled him out of the room.</p><p>Lastly, Archer of Black looked at the conflicted Fiore\u2014and then looked at Caules. Caules nodded silently. Seeing that, Archer smiled in relief, and silently left the room.</p><p>And then, only the two siblings were left in the conference room.</p><p>Fiore moved her wheelchair to look at the pitch-black darkness outside the window\u2014as if she were trying to run away.</p><p>\u201CNow then. Nee-san, what will we do?\u201D</p><p>That cold tone was completely unlike the normal Caules; it was the voice of a magus. Fiore replied while still facing the window.</p><p>\u201CWe must shoulder the greater risks. We\u2014Yggdmillennia must take back the Greater Grail through any means pos\u2014\u201D</p><p>\u201CI think this is a watershed moment.\u201D</p><p>Without waiting for her to finish speaking, Caules cut in and said that.</p><p>\u201CWatershed\u2026 what do you mean?\u201D</p><p>\u201CThis is a turning point deciding whether you\u2019ll become a magus or a human, Nee-chan.\u201D</p><p>\u2014Those words sent a horrible chill down Fiore\u2019s back.</p><p>\u201C\u2026What are you talking about?\u201D</p><p>\u201CBased on the movements of the Greater Grail that we heard from Ruler, the Red camp is definitely heading towards the Black Sea. I have no idea where they intend to go from there. Maybe they\u2019ll go north or south, or maybe they\u2019re heading somewhere specific\u2014in any case, if we don\u2019t catch up with them by tomorrow, the Greater Grail will fall out of all of our hands.\u201D</p><p>\u201CI know that.\u201D</p><p>\u201CDarnic Prestone Yggdmillennia devoted everything for the sake of this rebellion. He put our blood, our magic power, our fortune and property, everything last thing we have on the table. If we lose here, everything will come to nothing. Even if we wait five days and win with better chances, it will all come to nothing.\u201D</p><p>\u201CI know that.\u201D</p><p>\u201CSo if we want the Greater Grail, we have to leave by tomorrow.\u201D</p><p>\u201CLike I said, I know all that! Caules, what are you trying to say!?\u201D</p><p>Irritated, Fiore turned around and glared at Caules\u2014and her anger immediately vanished like mist.</p><p>Caules\u2019 eyes were as dark as the depths of the deep sea.</p><p>\u201CHowever, that is the choice of a magus.\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2026Of a magus?\u201D</p><p>That was obvious. That was the premise behind everything. Fiore Forvedge Yggdmillennia was a magus, after all.</p><p>\u201CThe Greater Grail can\u2019t be allowed to be used by someone evil. That\u2019s why we have to win. For the sake of that, we\u2019ll raise our odds of winning even the slightest bit. We have to lower the risk and increase our chances\u2026 even if it means we can\u2019t obtain the Greater Grail.\u201D</p><p>Caules calmly said that.</p><p>\u201CI won\u2019t change my mind. Yggdmillennia\u2014\u201D</p><p>\u201CWho cares about Yggdmillennia? Forget the fact that you\u2019re the head of our family too. Nee-chan, the issue here is whether or not you\u2019ll continue to be a magus.\u201D</p><p>Understanding the meaning of those words, Fiore turned pale and moved back from Caules. Her anger had disappeared, and in its stead, she felt fear, looking at her brother as if he had become a monster.</p><p>\u201C\u2026Are you telling me to stop being a magus?\u201D</p><p>\u201CThat\u2019s something for you to decide, Nee-chan.\u201D</p><p>\u201CThe answer is obvious. I\u2014\u201D</p><p>I will continue being a magus. I must continue being a magus. After all, our parents and relatives expect that of me, and I have to unify our clan. I also have to use the Greater Grail to grant my wish to have my legs healed\u2014</p><p>\u201C\u2026Do you remember that dog?\u201D</p><p>\u2014Fiore\u2019s breathing halted. Memories that should have sunk to the bottom of her consciousness suddenly rose to the surface.</p><p>The peeled skin of the dog. Its cries of pain. Its black eyes that seemed to ask \u201CWhy?\u201D\u2014</p><p>Just remembering it made her feel like vomiting.</p><p>\u201C\u2026I remember. I could never forget it.\u201D</p><p>Tightly gripping the armrests of her wheelchair, Fiore replied as if spitting out blood. She had thought about forgetting it time and time again. And each time, she had sworn not to forget and continued to endure the flashbacks.</p><p>\u201CI see\u2026 In that case, you really aren\u2019t suited to be a magus, Nee-chan. It would have better if you just forgot it.\u201D</p><p>Memories of the past were important.</p><p>If it was for the sake of living as a magus, then she should hold onto them. But Fiore\u2019s memories were merely a form of trauma that gave her no benefit. Even if it raised her chances of communicating with low-level spirits within her specialty magecraft, what good would it do? Her success was natural in the first place, and even if she failed a spell, she could think of a hundred ways of dealing with it. As someone trained thoroughly as a magus, she could reject any trivial spiritual possession just by using her Magic Circuits.</p><p>\u2026That\u2019s why memories had no value for her. If a memory was so sad, painful and unpleasant that it blinded her, she didn\u2019t have any problem with forgetting it.</p><p>\u2014Except for one. The memory of those peaceful days spent with that dog.</p><p>\u201CThere\u2019s no way I could forget.\u201D</p><p>\u201CWhy?\u201D</p><p>Caules\u2019 voice was calm as he asked that. Fiore forgot about resisting, and simply answered honestly.</p><p>\u201CBecause, if I forget that little one, where else would he have to go?\u201D</p><p>In this world, the only ones who remembered that dog\u2014were probably only herself and her brother.</p><p>If she forgot him, that dog would disappear in that instant. The certain awareness that \u2018he had existed\u2019 would disappear.</p><p>People make graves in order not to forget the dead. Each time they saw the graves, they recalled those bygone days.</p><p>Proving that \u2018those people were alive in the past\u2019 was just as important as proving \u2018I\u2019m alive in the present\u2019.</p><p>That\u2019s why, if she forgot that dog\u2026</p><p>He would have nowhere to go\u2014</p><p>\u201CIsn\u2019t that sentiment completely opposed to the reasoning of magi? \u2026That\u2019s why you\u2019re not cut out to be a magus, Nee-chan.\u201D</p><p>Hearing those words, Fiore stopped breathing for an instant\u2014and then she nodded.</p><p>\u201C\u2026You\u2019re right. I\u2019m not cut out for it. I might have hesitated over it a little too much.\u201D</p><p>She should have forgotten it. But even if she didn\u2019t forget it, it didn\u2019t impede her that much. She had used her talent to continue dodging the issue between her detestable sentimentality and her life as a magus.</p><p>But that was also at an end. Her childhood was long past, and she had to decide whether to take the path forward or backward now.</p><p>\u2026She should go forward. She should continue as a magus.</p><p>That was the correct choice. That was unmistakably the logical decision.</p><p>Ah, but\u2014</p><p>She had made a grave for that dog. She didn\u2019t know whether it had been worn away by the all rain and wind since then. But still, she and her brother had made a grave.</p><p>She had grieved for that dog and felt sad over his death. She didn\u2019t have the courage to erase those feelings and call herself a magus with a calm face.</p><p>Yes, that\u2019s right. She had no courage. Cowardly, timid, always worrying and fretting; that was her true self.</p><p>Something warm filled her heart.</p><p>She thought herself foolish and weak, not for being unable to keep moving forward, but for being unable to change the part of her that didn\u2019t want to ever forget that dog\u2014but even so, she didn\u2019t regret it.</p><p>\u201C\u2014I can\u2019t go forward anymore.\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2026I see. Yeah, I think that\u2019s for the best, Nee-chan.\u201D</p><p>She was at her limit.</p><p>Hearing Caules\u2019 words, Fiore bent forward and began to sob.</p><p>Fiore Forvedge Yggdmillennia decided to quit. Not the Great Holy Grail War, but her life as a magus.</p><p>\u201C\u2026We\u2019ll wait five days. If Rider can utilize that tome\u2019s true power, it will decrease the risk of us getting shot down when we attack.\u201D</p><p>\u201CI see. Then Nee-chan, you\u2019ll stand behind here\u2014\u201D</p><p>As Caules patted his chest in relief, Fiore tilted her head curiously and interrupted him.</p><p>\u201CWhat are you talking about? Of course not. Naturally, I\u2019ll also be going.\u201D</p><p>\u201CHuh!? Didn\u2019t you quit!?\u201D</p><p>\u201CCaules, what on earth are you talking about?\u201D</p><p>As if her tears just now were a lie, she spoke to her brother with a composed expression.</p><p>\u201CI\u2019ve certainly quit being Fiore Forvedge Yggdmillennia the magus. But I still have a separate duty as someone chosen as a Master in the Great Holy Grail War.\u201D</p><p>\u201CUgh. That\u2019s\u2026\u201D</p><p>Caules groaned. Just as she said, regardless of whether or not she was a magus now, she still had her responsibility as a Master.</p><p>Furthermore, Archer of Black was still alive and required prana.</p><p>And it wasn\u2019t like she could give up on the Great Holy Grail War here. She had to fight, not as a magus, but because of her pride as a Master.</p><p>\u201CYou listening, Caules? I will also ride the plane. You will remain here with Gordes-ojisama. I will entrust everything to you both should the worst case scenario occur.\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2026No, I\u2019ll go. I\u2019ll go too. I\u2019m the same as you. I also have a duty as a Master.\u201D</p><p>That\u2019s right, Caules was still a Master. Though only to a small extent, he was supplying prana for Archer of Black. But that was simply as a backup. In reality, he was merely a Master that had already dropped out of the Great Holy Grail War.</p><p>\u201CEven though Berserker is gone?\u201D</p><p>When Fiore asked that sadly, Caules looked straight at Fiore and responded.</p><p>\u201CEven if Berserker is gone, even if all my Command Spells have vanished, I\u2019m still a Master. And above all, I\u2019m an Yggdmillennia magus. Since I bear that duty, I\u2019ll also go.\u201D</p><p>Fiore sucked in a surprised breath when she heard those words.</p><p>An Yggdmillennia magus\u2014she understood what those words meant. They were a proclamation of their separation, and a kind of decisive declaration.</p><p>For a short while, the two of them fell into silence.</p><p>\u201C\u2026\u2026I see. You\u2019re going that way, Caules.\u201D</p><p>Fiore whispered in a lonely manner, and Caules shrugged calmly.</p><p>\u201CI myself don\u2019t care either way. But well, if Nee-chan is going over to that side, I should stay on this side.\u201D</p><p>That wasn\u2019t Caules\u2019 own desire. He was merely acting in accordance with Fiore\u2019s actions. But he had no regrets over it.</p><p>In the first place, he had always led an aimless life. He was a completely half-hearted person who didn\u2019t care whether he was a human or a magus either way. If that could help his sister settle her own life\u2014well, that was fine with me.</p><p>\u201CYou won\u2019t come with me\u2026?\u201D</p><p>\u201CIs there a need for me to go with you?\u201D</p><p>Caules unhesitantly rebuked Fiore\u2019s imploring words. It\u2019s better like this, thought Caules. Fiore would be lonely and lament that he was no longer by her side. But it was still a parting that she would eventually recover from.</p><p>She had decided the path she would follow. There was no way to know what lay ahead of her. But she had decided.</p><p>She would lose many things\u2014that was only natural, since she was throwing away the glory and life of a magus. Even so\u2014Fiore wanted to follow that path.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t about whether it was right or not. It was a decision wrapped in regret.</p><p>\u201C\u2026I\u2019ll be lonely.\u201D</p><p>\u201CI wonder about that. We might both end up dying in five days.\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2014Yeah. Naturally, such a future is also possible.\u201D</p><p>Perhaps because she had been absentminded, she had completely forgotten it was far more likely they wouldn\u2019t live to see the future\u2014and when she realized that, Fiore involuntarily laughed.</p><p>Caules also started laughing with her, and from there on, their faces twisted in mirth as they convulsed with laughter.</p><p>Wiping tears from his eyes, Caules spoke.</p><p>\u201CIt\u2019s the final battle. Let\u2019s make sure to go all out, Nee-chan.\u201D</p><p>\u201CIt\u2019s all right. I\u2014have Archer to protect me, after all,\u201D Fiore replied.</p><hr><p>The sky was filled with dazzling stars.</p><p>Though the occasionally blowing wind was cold, it wasn\u2019t so bad that it made the body shiver. Seen from the lookout of the Fortress of Millennia, Trifas looked to have finally regained its peace.</p><p>Many Yggdmillennia magi were running around, using hypnosis on the people to suppress the panic, acting as doctors to give medical treatment, and acting as policemen to publically announce what happened as a spontaneous outbreak of poison gas. Fiore, who was the acting clan head, had immediately negotiated with the government to bring the state of emergency to a close. Apparently, it had also been announced that the serial killings were resolved.</p><p>As he was looking up at the stars, Archer of Black felt a strange sense of disconnection. It wasn\u2019t that anything abnormal had occurred, but rather that a certain thought had suddenly come to mind.</p><p>\u201C\u2014The stars haven\u2019t changed even after more than two millennia, huh?\u201D</p><p>He had thought that the sky he saw in Greece in the past and the sky he saw now in Trifas would be different, but it hadn\u2019t changed that much.</p><p>The lives of humans have changed. History continues to advance. But the way the world works hasn\u2019t changed that much, thought Archer.</p><p>People fight, love, think and give directions\u2014Those known as kings may have entirely died out, but the act of ruling itself hadn\u2019t changed that much from when Archer was alive.</p><p>\u2026It can\u2019t be helped, he thought.</p><p>People could accumulate wisdom and convey knowledge down the generations. But that didn\u2019t mean that their inner instincts changed as well.</p><p>If that part of them changed, they would no longer be human, but something else entirely.</p><p>Even so\u2014should people aim to become something beyond human?</p><p>\u201C\u2026Ridiculous.\u201D</p><p>That whisper he unconsciously muttered was heard by someone behind him.</p><p>\u201CArcher?\u201D</p><p>Archer turned around at the sound of that clear voice.</p><p>\u201CAh, Sieg. What is it?\u201D</p><p>He looked behind Sieg for the figures of Rider or Ruler, who were the first and second most likely people to be with him. Noticing Archer\u2019s gaze, Sieg spoke up in a slightly miffed tone.</p><p>\u201CThe two of them are speaking with your Master. I was just told to bring you a message.\u201D</p><p>\u201CA message?\u201D</p><p>\u201CYes\u2026 It seems we\u2019ll be departing in five days. You should talk with your Master later to hear the full details.\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2014Is that so?\u201D</p><p>Archer understood the meaning of those words very well. It meant that his Master, who was both a magus and a normal human, had decided to live as a normal human.</p><p>But despite everything, she had chosen that. Though she would lose many things, she had still chosen that path.</p><p>No matter how normal they might be, everyone was pressed to make a choice eventually. The choice of what path to take in their life.</p><p>There were exceedingly few people who didn\u2019t regret or waver. But Archer knew that never wavering was not necessarily correct.</p><p>No, he wouldn\u2019t mind even if she wavered and made a mistake.</p><p>\u201CArcher. I have a question to ask of you with your wisdom.\u201D</p><p>Archer was a bit surprised to find that Sieg was still there, since he thought the homunculus would leave right away after delivering the message.</p><p>\u201CYes, what is it?\u201D</p><p>Sieg\u2019s handsome, doll-like face was tinged with faint distress.</p><p>\u201CI don\u2019t understand.\u201D</p><p>His whisper was faint beneath the starry sky.</p><p>\u201CWhat don\u2019t you understand?\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2026Assassin of Black showed me something.\u201D</p><p>Sieg spoke of what he had seen.</p><p>There were those who exploited and those who were exploited. And at the end of it all were pure lives that were merely plucked away.</p><p>It was complete and perfect as a system; no one was in the wrong, and there was no justice to be found anywhere.</p><p>The spectacle he had witnessed was one form of hell.</p><p>\u201CIt\u2019s true that that might not be all there is to humans\u2026 But then, I realized. If humans continue to sacrifice the few for the sake of the whole, simply because it\u2019s not very visible\u2026 the world might not be that different from that hell.\u201D</p><p>With those faltering words, Sieg denounced the world.</p><p>The world isn\u2019t beautiful. The world is ugly. Those words\u2014contained a grain of truth.</p><p>\u201C\u2026Of course, I don\u2019t know anything about the world. So these thoughts of mine might be absurd to you.\u201D</p><p>He said that in a somewhat sulky manner. Archer found that slightly charming.</p><p>Now then\u2026 it would be simple for Archer to reject what Sieg had said, and putting it into words would be easy for him as well. He could destroy Sieg\u2019s conclusion in just ten words, and with a hundred he could easily persuade him otherwise. After all, Sieg himself wanted to deny his own conclusion. He wanted to believe in Ruler\u2019s words that \u2018The world is beautiful\u2019.</p><p>But Archer rejected that option.</p><p>\u201C\u2026Perhaps so. Sieg, I walked on the earth more than two thousand years ago. People have multiplied since then. They have continued to overcome disasters and battles and to prosper. In the Earth\u2019s long history, the only race to have prospered this much is humanity. But that doesn\u2019t mean that humanity has changed much over those two thousand years. They haven\u2019t changed in the most fundamental sense.\u201D</p><p>Sieg looked at Archer in surprise. Archer shook his head as if to say how unbearable it all was.</p><p>\u201CI have raised and trained less than a hundred humans. Many of them reached the level where they were called heroes. Of course, that was due to their individual resourcefulness and efforts. I merely gave them a push to support them, but\u2014\u201D</p><p>Even so, he felt pride in the pupils he had taught.</p><p>Asclepius, who became revered as a god of medicine; the famous hero Heracles; Castor; and the hero who had been summoned as Rider of Red, Achilles. Both those who left their names in history and those who remained buried in anonymity were splendid humans, one and all.</p><p>\u201CEven though there were once such great heroes, the world still hasn\u2019t changed. That\u2019s only natural. No human can change their basic instincts.\u201D</p><p>No matter how much people trained themselves, there was no human who never felt hunger in their life. If such a feat were achieved, it would probably be some kind of curse.</p><p>Humans possessed both reason and instinct. It was impossible to live by reason alone, and living by instinct alone merely made one a beast.</p><p>Reason has developed due to the advancement of knowledge. Techniques to restrain instincts have also increased. But\u2014it was impossible to completely negate them.</p><p>\u201CHowever, everything is washed away before the large river of history. It can\u2019t be helped. It can\u2019t be helped, but\u2026 As I stand here again in the world two thousand years later, I wonder if there was any meaning in my life. I think such foolish thoughts.\u201D</p><p>It truly was foolish.</p><p>Archer of Black immediately denied the thoughts that welled up in him. There was no such as a life that had meaning in this world. And there shouldn\u2019t be.</p><p>Because your life\u2019s meaning was something that you had to create yourself by moving forward.</p><p>\u201C\u2026There is meaning in it. You left your name in history. Your life\u2019s brilliance became part of the stars in the sky and the name of your constellation remains even two thousand years later. I find that enviable.\u201D</p><p>The way Sieg seemed to pout as he murmured that was quite amusing to Archer.</p><p>\u201CThank you, Sieg. Now then, I can\u2019t answer your question. But I will give you one piece of advice, if you\u2019ll allow me. Right now, you don\u2019t know what\u2019s good and what\u2019s bad, but you should think about it while following your heart. Accepting the advice of others is useful, but you mustn\u2019t simply obey it.\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2026In the end, I guess I have to think for myself.\u201D</p><p>\u201CIs that troublesome?\u201D</p><p>Sieg should his head silently. He never once thought it was troublesome. But he felt like he shouldn\u2019t think so much that he came to a standstill.</p><p>\u201CThat\u2019s true. Simply thinking will merely make you go around in circles.\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2026So I have to act, huh?\u201D</p><p>Archer nodded at Sieg\u2019s words.</p><p>\u201CThat\u2019s right. Act and decide. Right now, you are a living creature that can step firmly upon this earth with your own two feet.\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2026I understand. Archer, living is quite difficult, isn\u2019t it? If even I\u2019m like this, it must be even harder for heroes like you.\u201D</p><p>Archer shook his head in denial of Sieg\u2019s words.</p><p>\u201CIt\u2019s true that living might be difficult to some extent, but not so much as you imagine\u2026 Rather, the place from which you started was much harsher.\u201D</p><p>Sieg gained self-consciousness within a prana supply tank. The fact that he thought of breaking out from there in the first place was abnormal.</p><p>He might have despaired once he understood his situation. He might have been at a loss over what to do. But even so, he chose to move forward.</p><p>\u2026That wasn\u2019t an act that anyone could do. Most heroes possessed power, talent and divine blessings from the moment they were born.</p><p>He had none of those. Yet even without them\u2014he was continuing to fight in the cruel situation of the Great Holy Grail War. If humans had possibilities hidden within themselves, then an artificial lifeform that was extremely close to humans\u2014a homunculus might also have infinite possibilities hidden within himself.</p><p>\u201C\u2026Not really, I think I was just desperate back then.\u201D</p><p>However, it seemed the boy himself wasn\u2019t aware of that.</p><p>\u201CAs long as you have that desperate urge, I\u2019m sure that your worries will be settled someday.\u201D</p><p>\u201CI see\u2026 Thank you, Archer.\u201D</p><p>Sieg honestly thanked him, and then began walking away with a pondering expression. He seemed to be diligently considering Archer\u2019s advice.</p><p>\u201CThat\u2019s fine, but please do watch your step.\u201D</p><p>\u201CI know\u2026 ah.\u201D</p><p>As soon as he said that, Sieg stumbled. Hearing a muted cry of \u201CKyah\u201D at the same time, he saw that he had bumped into Archer\u2019s Master as she passed by.</p><p>\u201CSorry.\u201D</p><p>\u201CNo, it\u2019s fine.\u201D</p><p>After that brief exchange, Fiore moved out onto the lookout where Archer stood. Since her wheelchair couldn\u2019t ascend the stairs, she was using her Bronze-Link Manipulators.</p><p>\u201CDid you hear the message from that homunculus?\u201D</p><p>\u201CYes\u2026 I heard about how we\u2019ll be leaving in five days.\u201D</p><p>Archer of Black understood very well what that meant.</p><p>\u201CThe Greater Grail will be\u2014\u201D</p><p>\u201CYes, I know. Archer, there are several things I wish to discuss with you. Will you listen?\u201D</p><p>\u201COf course, Master. Shall we go inside?\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2026No, I don\u2019t mind staying here.\u201D</p><p>After saying that, Fiore looked up at the sky. Archer looked at her face from the side under the faint illumination of the castle\u2019s lamps\u2014and at the faint traces of tears on her cheeks.</p><p>\u201CIt might be able to grant my wish, but it will be difficult to take back the Greater Grail itself. It will most likely be retrieved by the Association of Magi.\u201D</p><p>Though, even leaving that aside, it was difficult to say whether or not the Greater Grail would be able to grant her wish anyway. The Black camp had no idea what state the Greater Grail was in after being stolen. It probably wasn\u2019t broken, but that was still merely conjecture on their part.</p><p>Besides, the enemy was a minor hero of the Far East who had continued to seek the Greater Grail over the course of six decades. Just what on earth was he planning\u2014?</p><p>\u201CThat is extremely disadvantageous to Yggdmillennia.\u201D</p><p>Archer struck at the truth of the matter with a quiet voice. That\u2019s right, if they launched their attack in five days, it would effectively mean defeat for them.</p><p>Sooner or later, the other clan members would also find out about this. In that case, Fiore would be completely cornered by them.</p><p>\u201CYes. That\u2019s why I will take responsibility\u2026 No, rather, because I won\u2019t take responsibility, I will give up magecraft.\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2026\u201D</p><p>Silence. Even though he had already understood, Archer uneasily kept silent.</p><p>For a magus to give up magecraft\u2014it meant giving up not only their life, but the entirety of their family\u2019s long history as well.</p><p>That was unimaginably painful and terrifying. Because she would be destroying something precious that had been gradually accumulated over time.</p><p>\u201CDon\u2019t look at me like that, Archer\u2026 This is fine. I was finally able to understand. Archer, you realized that I was unsuited to be a magus, right?\u201D</p><p>\u201CNo, that\u2019s\u2014\u201D</p><p>Fiore\u2019s gentle smile didn\u2019t allow Archer to lie.</p><p>\u201C\u2026I apologize. After I was summoned, I vaguely became aware of it as I talked with you. Master, you possess excellent and unrivaled talent as a magus. Even now, that is without a doubt true.\u201D</p><p>Archer apologized with a sincere expression. Fiore faintly giggled.</p><p>\u201CThank you. Those words make me very happy. But\u2014I never had any talent as a magus. I wasn\u2019t able to think rationally and devote everything to the study of magecraft.\u201D</p><p>\u201CI think it would have been fine if you were at least only an isolated magus, Master.\u201D</p><p>In that case, she wouldn\u2019t have gotten involved in the Great Holy Grail War, and would never have been installed as the head of Yggdmillennia.</p><p>In the first place, magi did not fight out of preference. There were simply battles they had to fight as a result of something they couldn\u2019t give up. If she were isolated, the danger of that would have been low. She might have made the best use of her ability as a magus and eventually left her work to the next generation without ever noticing the truth about herself all her life.</p><p>But those were all empty assumptions.</p><p>Fiore had been born as the eldest child of the Forvedge family and was made to shoulder various expectations as the candidate for the next Yggdmillennia clan head. She would have noticed it herself eventually. Or someone else would have noticed.</p><p>That would have likely led to an unstoppable and fatal situation. Just as Caules had said, this was definitely a turning point for her.</p><p>\u201CHowever, though it may be arrogant of me to say\u2014that makes me happy.\u201D</p><p>\u201CArcher\u2026?\u201D</p><p>\u201CYou acted not as a magus, but as an individual human towards me. You regarded me not as the deadly weapon known as a Servant, but as a comrade who fights alongside you. No, perhaps it\u2019s precisely because you\u2019re such a soft-hearted person that I was summoned by you.\u201D</p><p>Those were extremely unnecessary feelings in a Holy Grail War. She would definitely part with her Servant in the end.</p><p>No matter how much they bonded, that alone would not change.</p><p>It was a relationship that would eventually end. In that case, it was better to treat each other that way from the start. The Master would treat the Servant as a weapon and the Servant would use the Master as fuel.</p><p>Even though it should have been better that way\u2026</p><p>\u201CThat\u2019s not it at all. I was just afraid of being hated by you, Archer\u2026\u201D</p><p>Archer smiled wryly, finding that to be such a human-like answer.</p><p>Perhaps noticing it herself, Fiore became shyly embarrassed.</p><p>\u201CI\u2019d like to ask one more thing. Archer, are you all right\u2026 with fighting Rider of Red?\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2026What do you mean?\u201D</p><p>\u201CI saw a dream about you and Achilles. When he was young and you were raising him.\u201D</p><p>Fiore spoke of the dream she had seen. The young Achilles had earnestly revered and respected Chiron. And Chiron had also treated him as his own child\u2014and trained him to be a hero.</p><p>Family\u2026 That truly was the spectacle of a family.</p><p>\u201CArcher, Rider was a beloved pupil to you, wasn\u2019t he? I don\u2019t think it\u2019s right for you to fight him\u2026\u201D</p><p>She gave a human-like response out of human-like emotion.</p><p>She really is a good Master, thought Chiron with a broad smile. But she misunderstood. She wasn\u2019t wrong\u2014but she wasn\u2019t right either.</p><p>\u201CMaster. It\u2019s true that, just as you say, it might be painful to fight him to some extent. But it also brings me great joy that exceeds that pain.\u201D</p><p>\u201CJoy\u2026?\u201D</p><p>\u201CAchilles left my tutelage at around the tender age of ten. And just as promised, he acted as a hero, fought as a hero, and remained a hero right until the moment of his death. The fact that I contributed to those great achievements even a little brings me tremendous joy. And\u2014\u201D</p><p>Archer gave a bold smile and clenched his fist.</p><p>\u201CI can\u2019t help thinking. His fists were once small and weak, unable to even hit me, but could he beat me now? Has his formerly clumsy skill with the lance become good enough to face my arrows?\u201D</p><p>That was the instinct of a warrior. The selfish and pure desire known as fighting spirit that sprouted in all those who cultivated the art of battle in this world. It was the simple wish to fight someone strong, even if they were family.</p><p>\u201CI want to fight Rider of Red\u2026 Those are my honest feelings.\u201D</p><p>\u201CYou mean not as a Servant, but as a warrior?\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2026Yes. Of course, it\u2019s also true that there\u2019s need to eliminate him as a Servant.\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2014I see. Hey, Archer. I might be unsuited as a magus, but could it be that you\u2019re also unsuited as a Servant?\u201D</p><p>Fiore started giggling.</p><p>When she saw Archer think over his own words and then nod meekly, her laughter grew even greater.</p><p>\u201C\u2026Do you have regrets over giving up magecraft?\u201D</p><p>Archer suddenly asked her that. Fiore cast her eyes down with a slightly sad expression and whispered.</p><p>\u201COf course. It feels painful enough to pierce my heart. Magecraft was something precious to me. So much so that giving it up makes me want to cry in pain and regret.\u201D</p><p>When this conversation ended, Fiore would probably cry.</p><p>And when she transferred her Magic Crest to Caules later, she would probably cry again.</p><p>She would probably suffer through tearing heartache for a while after the war was over.</p><p>\u201C\u2026That\u2019s good, Master.\u201D</p><p>Though Archer\u2019s words were extremely inappropriate as a reply, Fiore accepted them.</p><p>\u201C\u2026Yes. My life wasn\u2019t a waste. Magecraft was such an important part of my life that I knew joy and the pain of loss from it.\u201D</p><p>That was why.</p><p>That was why she had to throw it away in order to walk a different path.</p><p>She would feel sad and lament over it. But there weren\u2019t many things in life that were held so preciously\u2014so she also felt joy over it.</p><p>\u201CThank you, Archer.\u201D</p><p>\u201CI didn\u2019t do anything. You chose your path by your own will. And Caules-dono gave you a push from behind.\u201D</p><p>Fiore shook her head at those words. If her Servant had been anyone other than Chiron, she would never have been able to make this choice.</p><p>It was because this man, who was as gentle and calm as a deep forest, had merely watched over her from behind that she was able to make this choice.</p><p>\u201CI\u2019m truly glad that my Servant was you.\u201D</p><p>\u201CAnd having you as my Master was unexpected good fortune for me.\u201D</p><p>\u201CFive days from now. Don\u2019t mind me and fight to your heart\u2019s content. That will help in protecting Caules and I.\u201D</p><p>They couldn\u2019t break through the obstacles to the Hanging Gardens with just an airplane. Therefore, they had thought up several plans (though there were all brute force strategies).</p><p>Having the Master Fiore and the Servant Archer act separately was also one of those plans. The Servant was meant to protect the Master, so Archer\u2019s presence in one place would also expose the location of his Master there.</p><p>Therefore, Archer would forget about his Master and act freely.</p><p>\u201CEven so, I\u2019ll respond to a summons by Command Spell in an emergency. If something happens, make sure to call me. I may be a failure as a Servant\u2014but I swear upon the stars of Sagittarius that I will protect you.\u201D</p><p>Archer took Fiore\u2019s hand and kneeled. Her cheeks turning slightly red, Fiore let Archer kiss the back of her hand.</p><p>\u201CCourtesy and etiquette didn\u2019t exist in my era, so forgive me if I\u2019m ill-mannered.\u201D</p><p>\u201CNot\u2026 at all.\u201D</p><p>As she spoke, Fiore laced her hands together as if having accepted something precious.</p><p>Their parting was definitely close at hand. Servants were spirits, and even if Chiron were summoned in another Holy Grail War, it wouldn\u2019t be the Archer of Black who was summoned in this Great Holy Grail War.</p><p>\u201CArcher, I pray for your victory.\u201D</p><p>It was already uncertain what victory or defeat was at this point. But even so, Fiore could only pray and entrust those words to him.</p><p>Without saying anything, Archer nodded with a gentle smile.</p><hr><p>Sieg and Rider of Black had left Trifas to head to Bucharest. Fiore had furnished a safe house in the city and had asked them to head there first.</p><p>\u2026Apparently, she was conducting a ritual that couldn\u2019t be shown to outsiders. Leaving aside Rider of Black who was a Servant, the homunculus would possibly live past the Great Holy Grail War, and so Fiore had requested that he go to a location as far away from the castle as possible.</p><p>Sieg didn\u2019t know what kind of ritual it was, but it couldn\u2019t be helped if his presence would be in the way, so he agreed. Fiore also offered to provide him with other homunculi to attend him, but Sieg politely declined.</p><p>\u201CI\u2019ll catch up with you soon.\u201D</p><p><img src="https://i2.lensdump.com/i/1sffxo.jpg" alt=""></p><p>Ruler said that while clasping her hands together. Her eyes were very serious as she gazed at Sieg. Ruler had to take care of two tasks that Sieg and Fiore had respectively requested of her, so she was staying at the Fortress of Millennia a little while longer. In other words, their group\u2019s greatest safety net would be gone from their side.</p><p>\u201CListen, okay? Please don\u2019t let Rider cause any trouble. This is not just my request, it\u2019s the request of Archer of Black and all of Yggdmillennia as well.\u201D</p><p>The homunculi behind her nodded in unison.</p><p>\u201C\u2026Understood. I\u2019ll somehow keep Rider in check.\u201D</p><p>Sieg clenched his fist as if to show his determination.</p><p>\u201CHeeeey, you guys, I am right here, you know? No, you do know, don\u2019t you? You\u2019re doing it while aware that I\u2019m here. Damn it, are you all trying to pick a fight with me!?\u201D</p><p>And Rider of Black, who was watching all this from Sieg\u2019s side, lost his temper. But their unease wasn\u2019t unwarranted. After all, he was Astolfo, who was famed for his reason evaporating in his legend. He had caused lots of trouble both big and small while here in Trifas as well.</p><p>\u201CNow, now, please do calm down. I have faith in you, Rider.\u201D</p><p>Archer of Black spoke gently and patted Rider\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>\u201CArcher\u2026 <em>sniff</em>, you\u2019re the only one who believes in me.\u201D</p><p>Rider\u2019s eyes grew moist. Caules spoke up while watching the scene with scornful eyes.</p><p>\u201CYou were quite troubled over whether you should go to watch Rider, though, Archer.\u201D</p><p>\u201CTraitor!!\u201D</p><p>Rider of Black repeatedly struck his hands against Archer\u2019s chest. Sieg came forward to calm him down. While watching the two of them with a gentle gaze, Fiore spoke to Sieg.</p><p>\u201COnce we rejoin you, we\u2019ll immediately head out towards the Hanging Gardens. Perhaps you should say goodbye to the other homunculi here while you have the chance?\u201D</p><p>\u2014Goodbye.</p><p>Sieg stiffened at that word as if taken by surprise. What Fiore said was natural, but it was only now that he truly realized that he would have to part with his fellow homunculi.</p><p>\u201CAll right. Rider, please wait a bit.\u201D</p><p>\u201CSure. Say all your farewells until you\u2019re satisfied.\u201D</p><p>\u201CSieg-kun, partings are a sad thing. Please make sure to engrave them in your memories.\u201D</p><p>Sieg nodded at Ruler\u2019s words and then went to bid farewell to the other homunculi.</p><p>Most of the homunculi nodded lightly at his words of farewell and replied by tapping his shoulder or patting his head.</p><p>Goodbye, do your best, be well, we\u2019ll miss you, don\u2019t die, don\u2019t lose, good luck, take care of your body\u2014All of their words were ordinary, yet precious.</p><p>Taking in each of their words one after another, Sieg lastly headed to see the homunculus who basically served as their leader, Tool.</p><p>\u201C\u2026You\u2019re going?\u201D</p><p>Due to having received great damage during the previous fog incident, she still couldn\u2019t get out of bed. Her consciousness was clear, but she didn\u2019t seem to have yet regained the strength to get up and work. According to Gordes\u2019 diagnosis, she would return to normal in another three days, but\u2014</p><p>\u201CYeah. Whether I win or lose, I probably won\u2019t come back here.\u201D</p><p>If he lost, he would probably die. Even if he won or managed to just survive, he wouldn\u2019t return to Trifas.</p><p>\u2026He didn\u2019t know what he would do then. Would he distance himself from the evil of humans, or believe in the goodness of humans?</p><p>\u201CI see. That\u2019s fine\u2026 Go, then. You have a future, after all.\u201D</p><p>Tool lightly grasped Sieg\u2019s hand and softly struck it. Sieg nodded with a humble expression.</p><p>\u201CTruly, thank you very much.\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2026Hmm? I think I\u2019m the one who should be saying thanks, though.\u201D</p><p>Tool tilted her head in confusion at Sieg\u2019s words. Sieg sighed\u2014how should he explain it? He was simply glad that she and the others were alive. That was all.</p><p>As he was perplexed over how to express it in words, Tool giggled.</p><p>\u201CWell, saying farewell like that really is like you\u2026 You can live and survive anywhere. You\u2019re our hope, after all. You\u2019ll surely do something amazing. All the homunculi here believe that.\u201D</p><p>Something amazing, huh?</p><p>Even now, he was aware that he was an \u201Camazing\u201D existence. Even so, that was only a transient miracle. Once the Great Holy Grail War ended, he would probably live an ordinary life like anyone else\u2014</p><p>\u201CNo. You\u2019ll surely do something amazing.\u201D</p><p>Tool giggled from the bottom of her heart. It soon changed into a spasm-like cough, so he hurriedly gave her water and decided to leave the room.</p><p>Even if he gave the same farewell to everyone, there were slight differences among their reactions. Some were sad, some were happy, some were lonely at the prospect of his departure, and some held expectations for his future\u2014</p><p>The differences were slight, but that was a result of their individuality, as slight as it might be. Even if they were reared the same way, even if others paid no heed to them, Sieg thought that was something precious.</p><p>\u2026He felt reluctant to part with them. But that feeling of reluctance and regret was probably something previous as well.</p><p>After bidding farewell to everyone, he joined back up with Rider of Black at the castle gates.</p><p>\u201CYou finished your farewells?\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2026Yeah, basically.\u201D</p><p>\u201CI see. Then let\u2019s go and do our best!\u201D</p><p>Rider firmly grasped his hand. That strength of his was reliable and made Sieg happy. And at the same time, he had a thought.</p><p>Perhaps someday\u2026 no, not \u2018perhaps\u2019, I will definitely have to say farewell to Rider as well.</p><p>At that time, will I cry or laugh? Or will I not feel anything at all? If possible, I hope I feel something.</p><p>After getting on a bus going out of Trifas, Sieg and Rider at last arrived in Bucharest at some point in the evening. They walked through the city following the map they had been given. Along the way, they ended up being surrounded by several men of large build, but fortunately neither of them was injured. They seemed to give up after Rider, using his strength which had once dragged around a giant, bent a nearby light post with his bare hands.</p><p>\u201CThen, let\u2019s get going.\u201D</p><p>Rider had walked away with a calm face\u2026 Since the situation would have turned out much worse if Rider hadn\u2019t displayed his strength like that, Sieg concluded it wasn\u2019t a problem.</p><p>The building that had been prepared as their safe house was made of brickwork and was closed off from the outside, the perfect example of a \u2018building for insulating prana within its confines\u2019.</p><p>Sieg used the password and key he had been given to unlock the safe house\u2019s magically sealed door. It was almost night time. Bucharest was dangerous at night\u2026 Though it wasn\u2019t really dangerous for Sieg and Rider themselves, it would be a different matter for anyone who tried to pick a fight with them. It would be fine if it merely ended with a few hits, but in the worst case scenarios, Rider might forget to hold back his strength and break their necks, causing corpses to pile up.</p><p>They entered the safe house. The first floor consisted of a living room and kitchen. On the second floor there were bedrooms, with a total of four beds prepared including those for guests. As expected of an Yggdmillennia safe house, the furnishings were quite lavish. There were high-quality leather sofas, Persian rugs and a tulip-shaped crystal chandelier\u2014and when the energetic Rider immediately broke part of the chandelier upon their arrival, Sieg decided to pretend he didn\u2019t see anything.</p><p>There was nothing here to serve as a magus\u2019 workshop, like a basement or attic room. However, when he paid careful attention to the interior walls, he could tell that there were several alarm spells prepared. It appeared to be a spell that would link with the beds and forcefully wake them up the moment the walls were destroyed or some act of magecraft was detected in the surrounding area.</p><p>There was food in the refrigerator, so they decided to not go out of the house any further today. As usual, Rider passed the time merrily without going into spiritual form.</p><p>Fortunately, the damage that Rider caused concluded with merely the chandelier he partially bent by swinging from it, a guest bed he completely broke by jumping up and down on it three times, and three broken plates and two cups he smashed when he tried to help with washing the dishes. As long as it wasn\u2019t anything outside the safe house, the Yggdmillennia magi surely wouldn\u2019t get angry at destruction of the house\u2019s furnishings.</p><p>Night time came. After taking a quick shower, Rider immediately fell asleep in bed. On the other hand, Sieg gazed at the softly twinkling stars outside the window and recalled Archer and Ruler\u2019s words.</p><p>Think, and act.</p><p>The words were quite simple, but they were in fact quite hard to put into action. After all, even Ruler and Archer, who were respected and revered by the masses, sometimes became troubled and worried. If it was simply about continuing to survive in this world, the answer was simple\u2014breath, eat, excrete and sleep. Repeating that cyclical process could be called \u2018living\u2019.</p><p>In that regard, Sieg was also living.</p><p>But when other people were added into the mix, it became quite complex. How should he regard and interact with others? Were they evil or good\u2026? And was he himself good or evil?</p><p>He didn\u2019t think that the city where evil was constantly produced that Assassin showed him was just\u2026 But perhaps the men and woman who lived in that city had thought it was.</p><p>Then what should he do?</p><p>How could the problem be resolved? How could everyone become happy without making any victims and with no one being evil?</p><p>\u201C\u2026I don\u2019t know.\u201D</p><p>Most likely, even sages like Archer of Black, innocent heroes like Rider of Black and saints like Ruler can\u2019t resolve this problem, Sieg thought.</p><p>Sieg\u2019s thoughts were correct.</p><p>If there was something evil, then heroes were the ones who fought and destroyed that evil with all their might.</p><p>But no concrete evil had existed within that city in the first place. What that place needed were salvation from poverty, the restraint of crime and, most of all, happiness for all who lived there.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t possible to achieve that. Then was it right to leave it alone? No, it wasn\u2019t. Then should he choose to save only the people who caught his attention\u2014? But that was impossible for him.</p><p>\u201CThe salvation\u2026 of humanity, huh?\u201D</p><p>\u2026Speaking of which, the other side\u2019s Ruler, Amakusa Shirou Tokisada, had declared he would save humanity.</p><p>Sieg honestly thought that was a wonderful thing. Sieg had also done his own research on Amakusa Shirou Tokisada. Though he was never officially recognized as a saint, he had risked his life to accomplish something that anyone could truly call [good].</p><p>He had stood up against the tyrannical rule of his time. He had given the pride of being human back to those who weren\u2019t treated as humans. That\u2014was a splendid thing that Sieg himself could never do.</p><p>Even if he was the enemy and his method was likely mistaken\u2026 if the salvation of humanity could truly be accomplished, it would be a wonderful thing. And if his method wasn\u2019t mistaken, everyone could forget their grudges and work together to help him\u2014</p><p>\u201C\u2026Hmm?\u201D</p><p>Sieg tilted his head in puzzlement. He felt something slightly out of place in his thoughts just now.</p><p>But no matter how much he thought it over, he couldn\u2019t find the source of that out of place feeling. Since the night was growing late, Sieg decided to give up and go to sleep.</p><p>The next day, Sieg (reluctantly) went out to eat with Rider, but the chances of them getting dragged into trouble doubled as a result. Rider\u2019s excitement had risen further after basking in the sunlight. Having to deal with criminals or mere hoodlums like last night was still better than what happened when they went out.</p><p>The worst case was when Rider meddled in a quarrel between spouses.</p><p>\u201CYou guys should fight it out and clear away all your pent-up feelings!\u201D</p><p>That was Rider\u2019s advice when he tried to mediate between the two, the worst possible conclusion. In the end, it turned into a fist fight while splashing around within a water fountain, and the wife had obtained victory with a right hook to the jaw.</p><p>\u2026True, the couple had thanked Rider and gone home while smiling with their arms wrapped around each other\u2019s shoulders. But there had been too many sacrifices to reach that point\u2014a coffee shop\u2019s window was broken, their clothes became soaked from the water fountain, a table was toppled over and smashed, the plate of food that had been sitting on top of it had struck Sieg right in the face, and the sauce of the uneaten pasta on the plate had made Sieg\u2019s face sticky and oily.</p><p>And, for some reason, the reimbursement for the damages was pushed onto Sieg and Rider, and they ended up being billed more than half of the money that they had received as a budget from Yggdmillennia.</p><p>It couldn\u2019t be helped, since Rider ended up forcefully dragging Sieg along each time he stopped to look at something. And Rider frequently stopped as they walked. He stopped to watch street performers, he stopped to watch a charming young couple, and he unhesitantly went to help an old man who was taking a long time to cross the street.</p><p>\u201CYou really do like trouble, don\u2019t you?\u201D</p><p>\u201CUh-huh! After all, trouble is fun, and I like people too!\u201D</p><p>When Rider said that with a beaming smile, Sieg wasn\u2019t able to do anything. It was true that Rider liked people. He smiled joyfully just by walking around and watching ordinary people.</p><p>\u201CWhy do you like people?\u201D</p><p>\u201CHmm, I don\u2019t know. Then let me ask you right back; why should I hate them?\u201D</p><p>When asked that, Sieg became troubled. What Rider watched with a smile were humans who were neither just nor evil, but merely ordinary.</p><p>There was neither good nor ill will there. It was just a piece of ordinary backdrop scenery\u2014Sieg didn\u2019t like that wording, but that was all it was to him.</p><p>\u201CThat\u2019s right. It\u2019s like a piece of backdrop scenery. Those people are surely living lives completely unrelated to us. They probably do both bad things and good things. Which one depends on their choices, but\u2014if I step in and influence them, maybe something will change. That\u2019s what makes it fun!\u201D</p><p>Rider said that while smiling and laughing. He waved his arms and shouted excitedly.</p><p>\u201CThe hoodlums we met last night might think of returning to being upright citizens after having been beat up by me! The quarreling spouses earlier might have a child, and that child might discover something amazing! Or perhaps nothing will change at all! Yeah. That\u2019s why I like humans, and why I love \u2018what if\u2019 stories!\u201D</p><p>Rider spun around and danced in the middle of the street. The people passing by avoided the lively Rider half out of annoyance and half out of amusement.</p><p>\u201CI see\u2026 Yeah, somehow\u2026 I can understand that.\u201D</p><p>Sieg thought as he watched Rider. Whether or not Rider saw that scene of hell, or even if he had seen a worse hell himself in the past, he would surely come to a clear solution by easily saying \u2018That is that, this is this\u2019.</p><p>As long as there were humans, he would continue to interact with them, while hoping that something fun will happen\u2014</p><p>\u201CAh, hey you! You can\u2019t steal my wallet like that! Hey, hey, it\u2019s dangerous to swing around a knife\u2014fine then! <em>Bang</em>!\u201D</p><p>Sieg sighed and stepped forward to end this latest round of trouble quietly.</p><p>\u201CI understand that you like people, but please at least avoid making greater trouble.\u201D</p><p>\u201CSorry\u2026\u201D</p><p>Even Rider couldn\u2019t help but hang his head dejectedly when Sieg rebuked him.</p><p>\u201CAnyway, it\u2019s already past noon. Let\u2019s eat and hurry home\u2014\u201D</p><p>As Sieg said that, Rider\u2019s face suddenly sharpened. Sieg thought for a moment that he was going to make more trouble, but Rider\u2019s expression was too grim for that.</p><p>\u201C\u2026Rider?\u201D</p><p>Ignoring Sieg\u2019s questioning, Rider abruptly began running.</p><p>\u201CThis presence\u2026 There\u2019s a Servant nearby\u2026!\u201D</p><p>Sieg frantically ran after Rider. They went off the main street into a back alley. The surrounding people made way for them in confusion. People might get dragged into something again\u2014thought Sieg for an instant, but it was a needless fear.</p><p>As he ran at full speed, Rider was overflowing with the dignity of a gallant knight that he only ever showed at night. Half-hearted people hesitated to even call out to him.</p><p>Sieg ran\u2014but Rider\u2019s feet were swift. He gave up on catching up, and the best he could do was to follow the trail of Rider\u2019s prana in order not to lose sight of him. Sieg could only think that the reason for Rider\u2019s confusing and disordered route was because he was chasing after another Servant.</p><p>\u201CRider!\u201D</p><p>\u201CI\u2019ve almost caught up\u2026!\u201D</p><p>On his way, Rider jumped over a child playing on the street, ran over a fence to avoid a cat, and even barged into an apartment room and then jumped out its window on the other side.</p><p>\u201CThere!\u201D</p><p>Sieg\u2019s body tensed as he heard Rider\u2019s shout ahead of him. It was true that a Servant was quite close by. Even Sieg could sense it, since he contained Saber of Black in his body. Most likely, the other Servant had already notice their presence as well.</p><p>It was thus that Rider turned the corner of a back alley and Sieg followed after him from a little further behind.</p><p>In the back alley that was strangely dark even though it was midday, \u2018she\u2019 stood there with her back to them.</p><p>\u201CAh\u2014\u2014!?\u201D shouted Rider in surprise.</p><p>She turned around while letting out a brutal growl\u2014</p><p>There was no way either Rider or Sieg could forget her face.</p><p>There was no way they couldn\u2019t recognize her prana signature.</p><p>Despite the fact that they were in the middle of town, she was the only one who seemed as if she was on the battlefield even now.</p><p>\u201CY-You! What are you doing here!?\u201D</p><p>Saber of Red replied while glaring at the two of them with suspicious eyes.</p><p>\u201C\u2026That\u2019s my line.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u2014It appeared she was seeing a dream.</p><p>The family who had taken upon the name of Shishigou had moved to a gloomy land in a Far East island nation where it seemed to rain all-year-round. Fair weather only lasted for a shoot time during summer. On most days, the skies were covered with dark grey clouds.</p><p>It was a desolate place, where people had to use up all their will and energy just to survive.</p><p>Even if they were magi, they needed food to survive. All the more so for fallen magi like them. They had to start over using worthless spells that couldn\u2019t be called proper magecraft and gaining the trust of the native people.</p><p>\u201CWe can still make it, we can still make it, we can still make it\u2026\u201D</p><p>What do you mean, \u2018you can still make it\u2019? They had already reached their end. They had reached an unsolvable impasse; their Magic Crest had decayed and their power wasn\u2019t even a tenth of that from their golden age. Their Magic Circuits were becoming more meager with each generation, and they would eventually end up becoming merely people who \u2018know about magecraft\u2019.</p><p>The insult, indignity and humiliation of it all. The end result which all magi wanted to avoid at any cost. The worst possible conclusion, where they didn\u2019t lose their lives in a challenge to learn of the abyss or in a gruesome battle between magi, but rather simply became meaningless.</p><p>No, I hate that, I hate ending like that, I hate it, hate it\u2026</p><p>They whined unreasonably like children and sought help from other magi they were acquainted with out of desperation. Although the family had done so much for them back in their heyday, they all scorned the family and showed nothing but contempt.</p><p>\u201CO pitiful clan. You are all already finished.\u201D</p><p>\u201CHow can we help those whose Magic Circuits are dying out?\u201D</p><p>\u201CIt\u2019s sad, but this is also the fate of magi. No matter what you say or do, your wish won\u2019t be granted.\u201D</p><p>In the end, the one who granted their wish wasn\u2019t any of those other magi. Instead, they made a curse-like contract with a mysterious being that resembled an evil spirit.</p><p>\u201CWell, I shall promise you prosperity.\u201D</p><p>It cackled in amusement.</p><p>\u201CHowever, this is only a loan, so remember that you\u2019re fated to someday have it all end in an instant, understood\u2014?\u201D</p><p>The family said that they didn\u2019t care. They would progress their magecraft until that day. They could come up with any number of methods to deal with it. Even if they couldn\u2019t, their descendants surely would, someday\u2014</p><p>They had felt prejudice and contempt towards the branch of mystical techniques in this remote land. Their new magecraft was primitive and vulgar, far removed from their sense of aesthetics.</p><p>However, on the other hand, this craft was so simple and sturdy that it was beautiful. How foolish and shallow they once were. The family passed their knowledge down the generations, warned their children and grandchildren the curse and repeatedly ordered them to come up with a measure to deal with it as quickly as possible.</p><p>Their time of prosperity was like the account of a dream. Their thesis was recognized and the Clock Tower welcomed the Shishigou family back without hiding their surprise. \u2018I don\u2019t know how you managed to make this comeback, but how wonderful. We welcome you\u2014\u2019</p><p>And then, their fall once more came in the blink of an eye.</p><p>They didn\u2019t stumble down a hill, but were pushed off a cliff. Cruel treatment? Not at all. They had prepared themselves for this\u2014however, it was a problem that they had forced upon their descendants.</p><p>Shishigou Kairi was the beginning of the end. He was the greatest masterpiece among the children the Shishigou family had given birth to until now. Having surpassed his father and attained even greater mysteries of their magecraft, he was the pride of their family.</p><p>He was introduced and married to a wife. Having not forgotten about the curse for even a moment, the family first confirmed whether he could conceive children.</p><p>And then, they realized that it had finally started.</p><p>\u201CIt\u2019s no good. Kairi doesn\u2019t have the ability to conceive. There are no abnormalities in his body, so this is definitely the work of the curse. Unbelievable, it has finally begun\u2014\u201D</p><p>First, they attempted to make it possible for him to conceive children using every kind of method. They used various medicines, performed every ritual possible and used their connections and a great deal of money to have him examined by magi who specialized in medical magecraft.</p><p>Every one of them failed miserably. They did manage to make it possible for him to conceive for an instant. But the children died immediately after being born no matter how many times they repeated it. The children would be born, melt and then fade away.</p><p>His wife immediately decided to divorce him. She spoke to him with cold, indifferent eyes.</p><p>\u201CYou really are a splendid magus. You even toy with your own children.\u201D</p><p>She\u2019s right, thought Kairi. His children always died upon being born\u2014due to his duty to his family. They died no matter what he did\u2014as if he had killed them himself.</p><p>His wife\u2019s family also understood at this point how far the Shishigou family had fallen and quickly washed their hands of them.</p><p>Kairi and his wife had been the best couple in terms of their qualifications as magi. That\u2019s why the Shishigou family had continued to obsess over having them give birth to a child. But at that point, the family decided they had no other choice but to adopt a child as the next successor.</p><p>The Shishigou family was desperate. They thought that, since nothing else worked, they should have Kairi pass on the Magic Crest to another child through some means. Even an adopted child would do for them.</p><p>\u2026Even after having reached this point, it was hard to say whether they had understood the true meaning of the \u2018curse\u2019. The condition of the contract they had made was to give up magecraft when Shishigou Kairi was born.</p><p>The act itself of producing a magus to be his successor was impossible.</p><p>Without realizing that, they somehow discovered a young girl who was a distant relative with good compatibility. When they were introduced to each other, Kairi felt plainly depressed, knowing how scary-looking he was.</p><p>In other to further increase the Crest\u2019s compatibility with her, Kairi began living together with her.</p><p>\u201CWith this, I\u2019ll be able to become a magus just like Onii-sama. I\u2019m so happy\u2014\u201D</p><p>She murmured that with a smile. She was a frail and meek young girl. Every time it rained and there was thunder, her condition would worsen. When she heard that her body would also become sturdier once the Magic Crest was transplanted to her, she smiled happily. However, her poor health would continue until it was transplanted. It couldn\u2019t be helped, so Kairi would read a book out loud to her when she went to sleep.</p><p>\u201CI feel a bit sad that you won\u2019t read any books to me anymore once I become a magus, though\u2014\u201D</p><p>She said that, hanging her head in regret. Kairi muttered back, \u201COnce you become healthy, you can read all the books you want.\u201D But when she sulked and said, \u201CThat\u2019s not what I mean\u201D, he finally realized that she wanted him to read to her.</p><p>\u201CIt can\u2019t be helped then. I\u2019ll read books to you until you get tired of it.\u201D When he said that, she finally brightened.</p><p>Never before or after this\u2014</p><p>\u2014did Kairi experience such gentle, happy days in his entire life.</p><p>Those days\u2026</p><p>\u2026all suddenly vanished like magic on a certain day.</p><p>They cremated her body, which had turned violet after death. Following the customs of this land, and most of all fearing pollution of the soil, they burned her in fire. Kairi didn\u2019t cry. There was no way he could.</p><p>The one who had turned his eyes away more than anyone else from the possibility that it might turn out like this was Shishigou Kairi himself.</p><p>He had hoped that it might work. His father and the rest of the family had told him that it would be fine, so he had held onto the hope that it would all work out.</p><p>But it was all lies. He couldn\u2019t blame anyone else for what happened.</p><p>After all, Kairi had wanted to become her father. He had cruelly crushed her with that dream.</p><p>That was the truth; it was all he was left with. Tear, apologies and anything else were far out of his reach.</p><p>Shishigou Kairi calmly accepted curse in its entirety. He had searched through books, thought it all over to the point of madness, and in the end\u2014he decided to accept that it was over.</p><p>After that, he only did things that would throw away his life. Even for a necromancer, modern battlefields were far too dangerous.</p><p>He was no longer a magus, but more like a mere user of magecraft\u2014no, that\u2019s exactly what he was. But inside his heart, he didn\u2019t care, like a man who knew death was near and wasted all the wealth he had accumulated over the years.</p><p>Perhaps due to having the devil\u2019s luck, or perhaps because he, at the very least, refused to choose death by his own hands, Shishigou Kairi somehow managed to continue surviving in a state of being half alive. The other half of him had died when the girl had.</p><p>Each time he shed blood and collapsed on the battlefield, he remembered.</p><p>\u201CThe next time you wake up, please call me father\u2014\u201D</p><p>That\u2019s right. He carried the sin of having wished for her to call him that. It was hard, painful and bitter, and dying would only make it all easier\u2014and so he would tightly clench his hands, spit out blood and get back up each time.</p><p>Years passed. His once soft husk became hard like steel, and the hands he once used to write thesis papers became marred with countless scars.</p><p>He searched for corpses and processed them, thought up spells, and made money and wasted it immediately after.</p><p>He carried that sin.</p><p>He carried that sin, so he still lived, having yet to find a way of atonement.</p><p>At the very least, he felt as if he were dead.</p><p>And thus, when he reached the present, Shishigou Kairi encountered the Holy Grail. He was introduced to it.</p><p>His knowledge as a magus told him that reviving the dead was impossible.</p><p>His experiences of running across battlefields told him that the possibility was equal to zero.</p><p>Even so. Even so, he might find something. While half-despairing and suppressing the hope that swelled within him\u2014he reached out for the Holy Grail.</p><p>The reason he sought the Holy Gail was simply that.</p><p>This was a common, childish story that could be found all over the world in a variety of different situations.</p><p>But that was precisely why Shishigou Kairi\u2019s passionate desire for the Holy Grail was real.</p><p>It was a method to satisfy his extremely tiny pride as a magus that he himself wasn\u2019t even aware he still had, and at the same time the method of atonement that he had finally found. And in the deepest depths of his instincts, he knew.</p><p>He knew that that this was the place where Shishigou Kairi would die.</p><p>When she awakened, Saber of Red spoke up.</p><p>\u201CDon\u2019t show me such a stupid dream, idiot Master.\u201D</p><p>\u201CSorry for showing you a stupid dream, but I\u2019m not an idiot, you know\u2026\u201D</p><p>Perhaps having an idea of what she dreamed about, Shishigou grimaced.</p><p>According to the [Spirit Board], the rogue Assassin of Black had been killed. There were no other casualties among the Black camp. As expected, it was likely easy for them to take down Assassin with Rider and Archer on their side.</p><p>Shishigou Kairi and Saber of Red had already left Trifas. The Greater Grail was no longer there, and this wasn\u2019t the time to leisurely remain in enemy territory.</p><p>They went to Romania\u2019s capital Bucharest, and there they worked hard to gather information on the Hanging Gardens.</p><p>This time, instead of sleeping bags, they rented a hotel room. Yggdmillennia\u2019s clout in Romania was quite large, but even their influence vanished in the capital. Still, they rented two suites on the top floor under a pseudonym, and just in case used a suggestion spell to \u2018peacefully\u2019 take over someone else\u2019s room.</p><p>\u2026Saber, who had enjoyed the view from the top floor suite, couldn\u2019t help becoming sulky when she couldn\u2019t see anything out of the window of their borrowed room. \u201CYou can go use the suite room for yourself,\u201D Shishigou suggested, but Saber immediately rejected it.</p><p>\u201CNo, no. As a Servant, I have to protect my Master.\u201D</p><p>She folded her arms and spoke just like a Servant would.</p><p>Shishigou desperately held back from asking, \u2018Did you eat something bad?\u2019, and instead merely said, \u201CI see.\u201D</p><p>\u201CSo you should move to the suite room, Master. It\u2019s okay, I\u2019ll be by your side!\u201D</p><p>However, though Shishigou himself had judged that the suite room was 90% likely to be safe, he couldn\u2019t sleep there while thinking of the remaining 10% uncertainty. He was quite prone to worrying.</p><p>\u201C\u2026You were much more desperate in my dream, though, Master.\u201D</p><p>\u201CI don\u2019t know what kind of dream you saw, but as a bounty hunter, I always take precautions. Right down to the little details.\u201D</p><p>Even if he\u2019ll eventually die, he should die after having done everything he could. That was Shishigou Kairi\u2019s stance towards the world.</p><p>Saber of Red seemed dissatisfied, but it appeared she didn\u2019t think of leaving her Master\u2019s side even so.</p><p>After Shishigou had gotten the room and settled in, he decided to make his regular report. Technically, he should probably report to Rocco Belfegan, the one who hired him, but he was an old-fashioned magus who forbade reports by telephone or email\u2014he didn\u2019t have such devices in the first place.</p><p>Since he wasn\u2019t going to use a sluggish enchanted communication tool that would take forever, Shishigou decide to make a simple report to El Melloi II, who did have a cellphone, instead of Belfegan.</p><p>[Hmm, I understand the situation\u2026 It really is quite serious.]</p><p>El Melloi curtly summarized the current situation in a cool-headed tone. Just as he said, the situation truly was serious.</p><p>Though the Greater Grail being stolen was a serious matter in and of itself, there was also the additional fact that it was stolen not by the Association of Magi, but by a member of the Holy Church and, furthermore, the Ruler of the Third Holy Grail War in [Fuyuki], Amakusa Shirou Tokisada.</p><p>Naturally, the Association was already taking action. Though its relationship with the Church had greatly deteriorated and fallen into an all-out stand-off for a short while, the moderate factions of both sides had apparently desperately worked to reconcile and end the conflict without incident.</p><p>The Church wasn\u2019t going to take action this time. In the first place, the mediating priest Shirou had simply gone mad and betrayed them. Therefore, it was only proper for them to choose to wash their hands of him\u2026 Fortunately, the Church hadn\u2019t been learned that Shirou was actually Amakusa Shirou Tokisada. Though the possibility was low, it couldn\u2019t be dismissed that they might interfere in the Great Holy Grail in order to protect or use him.</p><p>\u201CYou got that right. So, how\u2019s the request I made last time coming along?\u201D</p><p>El Melloi didn\u2019t react at all to Shishigou\u2019s presumptuous words and replied indifferently.</p><p>[No problem. It\u2019s being prepared at the location you designated. I\u2019ll send you the password later.]</p><p>\u201CRoger that. Also, there\u2019s one more thing I\u2019d like to ask\u2014\u201D</p><p>[Like you thought, I can\u2019t sense any prana from the enemy on my end either. Most likely, it\u2019s due to Assassin of Red\u2019s\u2026 Semiramis\u2019 personal skill or Noble Phantasm.]</p><p>\u201CAs expected, huh?\u201D Shishigou clicked his tongue. He had thought that it would be possible to track a Noble Phantasm that used such a large amount of prana anywhere, but it appeared that Semiramis\u2019 class of \u2018Assassin\u2019 wasn\u2019t just for show.</p><p>Most likely, it was a top-class unique Noble Phantasm even among the many Noble Phantasms that Servants had used in past Holy Grail Wars.</p><p>A sword that annihilates the enemy by shooting a beam of light, armor that rejects all attacks, a war chariot that flies swiftly through the sky, a book that summons an endless stream of monsters, or something else even more unique and mysterious\u2014there existed all different kinds of Noble Phantasms.</p><p>However, even among the many Noble Phantasms possessed by heroes, a moving fortress was unheard of. Moreover, it was currently storing the Holy Grail within itself. The situation was nothing but nightmare to the Association.</p><p>[Will you be able to pursue it?]</p><p>\u201CNo problem, the Yggdmillennia magi are constantly observing it with their familiars. They seem to have an idea where it is.\u201D</p><p>[Do you think the Hanging Gardens might be heading out of Romania?]</p><p>Shishigou thought over El Melloi\u2019s question for a little while. The chances of it were extremely high. After all, it was a flying fortress. No matter how slow its speed was, they couldn\u2019t stop it from leaving the country.</p><p>\u201CIts flight speed is unknown. We can\u2019t be certain yet.\u201D</p><p>[I see. We\u2019ve already sent squads tasked with recovering the Greater Grail to the countries bordering Romania. Depending on the situation, they\u2019ll immediately go to recover it.]</p><p>\u201C\u2026Understood.\u201D</p><p>He had expected it, but it seemed the Association was prepared to act at a moment\u2019s notice. That was only natural. After all, this was not just a matter of getting a wish granted\u2014they might be able to get their hands on the Greater Grail itself. Should the Clock Tower get a hold of it, it was likely that the next Holy Grail War would break forth immediately afterwards.</p><p>\u2026Was there really any room for him to grant his own wish at this point?</p><p>\u201C\u2014What was that, Master? Are those guys planning to seize the Holy Grail!?\u201D</p><p>Saber yelled loudly behind him. Shishigou froze\u2014and even El Melloi on the other end of the phone call was shaken by the shout.</p><p>[W-What was that just now?]</p><p>\u201CI\u2019m sorry. My Servant just\u2014\u201D</p><p>Ignoring Shishigou\u2019s attempt to smooth things over, Saber quickly grabbed the phone from him and shouted into it.</p><p>\u201CHey! I\u2019m saying this just in case, but the Holy Grail is ours! I won\u2019t let you get guys try to snatch it by sneaking in from behind! Got it!?\u201D</p><p>[\u2026\u2026]</p><p>While El Melloi was shocked and Shishigou was frantically trying to snatch back the phone, Saber of Red continued talking as she kept Shishigou at bay with one hand.</p><p>\u201CAnswer me, magus! We won\u2019t hand the Holy Grail over to you until it grants our wishes! Got it!?\u201D</p><p>[\u2026G-Got it.]</p><p>Satisfied with that response, Saber of Red threw the phone back to Shishigou.</p><p>\u201CAh\u2026 I\u2019d like it if you\u2019d forgive my Servant\u2019s words as just a little joke.\u201D</p><p>Shishigou apologized while preparing himself for the worst. After a long silence, El Melloi surprisingly didn\u2019t become indignant, but rather laughed as if slightly amused.</p><p>[Pardon my laughter. It seems we\u2019ve both been troubled by our respective Servants.]</p><p>\u201C\u2026I suppose.\u201D</p><p>[I\u2019ll overlook that outburst just now. The recovery team will move in swiftly, so you should grant your wish as quickly as possible.]</p><p>The call ended there, and Shishigou let out a sigh.</p><p>\u201CHey, didn\u2019t you say something rude about me just now?\u201D</p><p>\u201CI didn\u2019t. Rather, you were the one who\u2026 no, never mind. The situation hasn\u2019t changed all that much.\u201D</p><p>In the end, for Shishigou Kairi to survive to the end of the war, his Servant would also have to necessarily remain alive at that point. Shishigou had wanted to keep his Servant\u2019s identity a secret for as long as possible and slow the Association\u2019s recovery operation should the worst happen\u2014but if his Servant died, he didn\u2019t think he\u2019d be able to survive in that situation.</p><p>\u201CRight, right! As long as you continue to seek the Holy Grail, I\u2019ll be your Servant, Master!\u201D</p><p>\u201CDon\u2019t worry, I haven\u2019t given up. Now then, I have to do a little work. You can go and act freely on your own. You can go the hotel\u2019s top floor, go sightseeing, or anything else you want.\u201D</p><p>\u201CHmm\u2026 Is that really all right?\u201D</p><p>\u201CI\u2019m going to be holed up in this room for a while. Just make sure to return by evening.\u201D</p><p>\u201COkay. Then I\u2019ll take you up on your offer.\u201D</p><p>When his Servant, who was as boisterous as a poltergeist, left the room, Shishigou sighed in relief.</p><p>After that, he took out a conspicuously large bottle from his luggage. It was the young Hydra corpse preserved in formalin that he had received as compensation for this job. He had already processed its heads into a dagger, but he hadn\u2019t had the time to use up all of its heads, so he had set it aside in a half-dissected state.</p><p>\u201CRider of Red is Achilles\u2026 In that case, Archer of Black is either Chiron\u2026 or maybe Paris?\u201D</p><p>Naturally, Archer of Black\u2019s true name was information that hadn\u2019t been provided to Shishigou by Yggdmillennia. Even so, based on the way Archer had talked when they were explaining the situation and planning countermeasures, Shishigou could easily tell that there was a connection between Rider of Red and Archer of Black.</p><p>Achilles\u2026 he was the greatest hero who had participated in the Trojan War, but there were two bowmen who had been deeply connected to him during his life.</p><p>The first was Paris. The man who had been the trigger for the Trojan War and who had also dealt the fatal blow to Achilles.</p><p>Having learned of Achilles only weakness, his heel, and having been possessed by the sun god Apollo, Paris had splendidly shot Achilles\u2019 heel even as Achilles didn\u2019t stop moving or rest for an instant on the battlefield.</p><p>He was pretty much Achilles\u2019 a mortal enemy. And at the same time, Paris had an extraordinary personal grudge against Achilles.</p><p>After all, Paris\u2019 older brother, the great hero Hector, had been killed by Achilles and then had been submitted to the indignity of having his corpse dragged across the battlefield by Achilles\u2019 chariot.</p><p>If Paris were Archer of Black\u2026 that would mean that he had been talking nostalgically about his brother\u2019s killer back when they met.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t impossible, considering the unique sense of values that heroes often had. However, it was definitely unnatural. But there was one other bowman who was deeply connected to Achilles\u2019 life.</p><p>It was none other than the man who raised Achilles, the greatest sage among the centaurs, Chiron.</p><p>Of course, Archer had a human form and lacked the lower body of a horse that should be the proof of being a centaur. However, that wasn\u2019t anything to be surprised by. After all, Chiron was born from a god and a goddess, and was a great sage who was extremely close to being a Divine Spirit.</p><p>He could probably freely take the form of a half-horse and the form of a human at will.</p><p>\u2026Yeah, if Archer was Chiron, then it also made sense how he had wounded Rider of Red who possessed divinity. Also, Archer\u2019s great depth of wisdom that seemed to apply to everything was more characteristic of Chiron than Paris.</p><p>However\u2014if Archer was Chiron, then that meant\u2026</p><p>\u201C\u2026Yeah, it\u2019s possible.\u201D</p><p>On the other hand, Shirou, who was of the Ruler class, was on the Red side. After having met face-to-face in the Hanging Gardens\u2019 chapel, everyone who had been there knew each other\u2019s true names now thanks to Shirou and Ruler.</p><p>Chiron had been there, and so had Achilles. And the problem was one of the other Servants who had been there.</p><p>Shishigou thought about what result that would bring about\u2014and made a decision.</p><p>Breaking down the knife he had previously made, he started constructing a new magical tool.</p><hr><p>Saber of Red walked idly down the streets of Bucharest during midday. In addition to her excessively exposing outfit, her dignified and beautiful features attracted quite a lot of attention\u2026 However, not a single person tried to call out to her.</p><p>The public order in Romania\u2019s capital of Bucharest was terrible. At the very least, there was a high chance that a girl like her, walking outside alone in such a conspicuous outfit, would be dragged into some kind of trouble.</p><p>But there were always exceptions to every case. Whether they were street punks, pickpockets or fake policemen, as long as they were human, they would act according to their instincts.</p><p>\u2026In other words, there was no one foolish enough to call out to a grizzly bear in the shape of a young girl.</p><p>\u201CMuu. Like I thought, I should have brought Master along, even if I had to do it by force.\u201D</p><p>Saber yawned in boredom.</p><p>The people who passed by her all took notice of her beauty for an instant\u2014but then frantically turned to look away from her. Having realized that she was being looked at, Saber wished she would get caught up in some trouble already.</p><p>Perhaps because she had seen that depressing dream, she felt like some vague emotion was gathering in her stomach. The best way to clear it away was with violence.</p><p>However, not a single person called out to her, leaving her extremely bored. There were various kinds of people, the old, the young, those who seemed good, those who seemed bad\u2014and she was cut off and separate from all of them.</p><p>\u2014Servants were beings that were separate from the world.</p><p>Heroic Spirits were summoned to win in the Holy Grail War. Even if they were given a second life, what was asked of them was only battle\u2014so it couldn\u2019t be helped.</p><p>Though Saber thus reasoned in her mind, her thoughts couldn\u2019t ignore the truth that she was alone from the start even when she was alive.</p><p>Her mother Morgan had only seen her as a tool of revenge against her father. Because her growth had been quickened, there was no one who knew her from childhood either.</p><p>Even after she rose up to be a knight in Camelot, she had never interacted with the other knights.</p><p>The only thing she had was battle. Exchanging sword blows, cursing and trying to kill one another. That seemed to be the only form of communication that Saber knew.</p><p>There was only one person\u2014who had been aware of her as \u2018Mordred\u2019 and with whom she had talked with her face unhidden.</p><p>Her father Arthur, who didn\u2019t hold any interest in her.</p><p>Every time she remembered her father, she felt her guts boil. It was impossible to reach an understanding and be on equal ground with that. To be able to converse with that mechanical doll that was extolled as the ideal king, she had to, at the very least, become king herself\u2014</p><p>\u201CAh\u2014\u2014!?\u201D</p><p>Her thoughts were suddenly cut off by a hysterical shout. Even though she had wished for someone to call out to her just a little earlier, now she felt irritation strong enough to make her want to send the speaker flying without asking any questions first.</p><p>\u201CBe quiet. Just who\u2014\u201D</p><p>\u201CY-You! What are you doing here!?\u201D</p><p>When she turned around, Saber of Red couldn\u2019t help widening her eyes. Standing there was Rider of Black, wearing modern clothing like her and standing warily to cover the homunculus with him.</p><p>\u201C\u2026\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2026\u201D</p><p>Rider of Black and Saber of Red fell into an awkward silence.</p><p>They weren\u2019t exactly enemies right now. But things weren\u2019t reconciled between them either. Still, if there had been any other humans or Servants present, they would have managed to bear it, but right now there was no one to stop them.</p><p>\u201C\u2026That\u2019s my line. So, do you wanna pick a fight here?\u201D</p><p>Saber of Red faintly smiled, making Rider of Black lose his temper.</p><p>\u201CI could ask you the same thing. I\u2019m fine either way. If you wanna go at it, then bring it.\u201D</p><p>He really doesn\u2019t seem to have learned his lesson after having been so badly beaten down by me before. This is a good opportunity to relieve some stress, I\u2019ll smash him down completely one more time here\u2014</p><p>Just as Saber of Red was going to take a step forward, another character took the stage. He stepped in front of Rider of Black and spoke to him while waving his right hand in greeting.</p><p>\u201CSaber of Red, it\u2019s been two days since we last saw each other. There\u2019s something I\u2019d like to ask you, so could we talk a little if you have some free time?\u201D</p><p>\u201CEh?\u201D</p><p>\u201CHuh?\u201D</p><p>\u2014Talk?</p><p>Ignoring the dumfounded reactions of the other two, the boy asked once more.</p><p>\u201CAre you busy right now?\u201D</p><p>\u201CNo, I\u2019m not really busy, but\u2026 is it really fine?\u201D</p><p>Saber of Red looked at the boy suspiciously. She couldn\u2019t find any anger, hatred or even fear in the boy\u2019s calm expression\u2026 He\u2019d been killed by her, but it seemed that incident was already treated as a closed matter within the boy.</p><p>The boy nodded like a drinking bird.</p><p>\u201CYeah, we also have some free time right now.\u201D</p><p>\u201CWha, no, wait\u2026\u201D</p><p>\u201CAre you busy, Rider? Then we can separate and\u2014\u201D</p><p>\u201CNo, no, no, no, no, no! I\u2019ll go, I\u2019ll go with you!\u201D</p><p>After looking first at the boy and then Rider of Black, Saber of Red frowned and spoke.</p><p>\u201CAll right. Where will we go to talk?\u201D</p><hr><p>The three of them began walking down the main street. Although Sieg and Rider had randomly gotten involved with other people when they were walking through the streets earlier (and Sieg had desperately stopped the joyful Rider from going out of control each time), now everyone they passed seemed to avert their faces from them.</p><p>It appeared to be because of Saber of Red who walked at their head\u2026 Certainly, her brutal presence, which could be clearly felt even from behind her, was unbearable for normal people.</p><p>\u201CSo. Just what on earth are you guys doing here?\u201D</p><p>Saber of Red looked over her shoulder and asked them. The sullen-looking Rider had his arms crossed and his face turned away.</p><p>\u201CWe have no obligation to ans\u2014\u201D</p><p>\u201CRider was insistent on going out, so I was chosen to keep an eye on him. Ruler seemed to judge that he wouldn\u2019t do anything too absurd as long as I\u2019m with him.\u201D</p><p>Sieg replied as if to restrain Rider.</p><p>\u201CWhat\u2019s your reason for coming to Bucharest in the first place?\u201D</p><p>\u201CI don\u2019t know, but apparently it\u2019s necessary.\u201D</p><p>\u201CHmm,\u201D said Saber of Red with a shrug. She thought about reporting this to her Master, but since he was in the middle of working, she decided to tell him later.</p><p>\u201CI heard that Assassin of Black died. Is that right?\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2026Yeah, she died.\u201D</p><p>Rider was still ignoring Saber, so Sieg answered instead.</p><p>\u201CI see,\u201D Saber murmured disinterestedly.</p><p>\u201CSo, why are you here in Bucharest, Saber?\u201D</p><p>\u201CI have no obligation to answer\u2026 Well, we thought it wouldn\u2019t be good for us to continue staying in Trifas. That\u2019s all.\u201D</p><p>Though they had temporarily decided to work together, Trifas was still enemy territory for her and her Master. This answer which Saber\u2019s Master, Shishigou Kairi, had given her was extremely valid.</p><p>\u201CSo, what did you want to talk about?\u201D</p><p>\u201CThat\u2019s right, Sieg. What do you walk to talk about with someone like this?\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2026You\u2019ve been far too grumpy since earlier.\u201D</p><p>Saber of Red murmured in amazement, and Rider of Black vehemently protested.</p><p>\u201CWhat are you saying!? As if I could forget that you killed him!\u201D</p><p>\u201CWell, I don\u2019t really care about it myself.\u201D</p><p>\u201CHey, you should care, you know!?\u201D</p><p>Rider of Black retorted to Sieg\u2019s calm words. To Sieg, it wasn\u2019t a problem since he was alive now. Of course, it was only natural for a victim to have painful feelings\u2014to feel hate towards the perpetrator.</p><p>But this wasn\u2019t the time for that right now.</p><p>They weren\u2019t enemies right now, so Sieg had thought he might be able to talk to her a bit. After all, Saber of Red was Mordred\u2014the Knight of Rebellion who had ended King Arthur\u2019s legend.</p><p>She might have her own personal view about human beings.</p><p>Sieg wanted to ask her that. He didn\u2019t want an answer from her, but an opinion.</p><p>\u201CNo, well, if you\u2019re okay with it, it\u2019s fine, but\u2026 All right, I\u2019ll forgive you for having survived my Noble Phantasm. There, now we\u2019re even.\u201D</p><p>\u2026Does that really make us even? Sieg tilted his head in puzzlement, but Saber of Red seemed to be in a good mood, so he decided not to comment.</p><p>\u201CHere, huh?\u201D</p><p>Seeming to imply without words \u2018This is the perfect choice\u2019, Saber of Red quickly opened the door of a coffee shop. Sieg and Rider followed behind her.</p><p>\u201CWelcome.\u201D</p><p>A grey-mustached shopkeeper greeted the three of them in a somewhat brusque manner. Fortunately, there were no other customers to be seen. Though, since this was the state of the shop at lunchtime, they might not be able to expect good taste from the food here\u2026</p><p>\u201CSieg, what will you have?\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2026A ham sandwich and coffee.\u201D</p><p>\u201CThen I\u2019ll have the same.\u201D</p><p>Saber of Red took a while to think over the menu she had been given before she spoke.</p><p>\u201CI\u2019ll have a grilled chicken sandwich, a green apple sundae, a seafood buster and beef steak, and for dessert, umm, three of these muffins. Ah, and a coffee too.\u201D</p><p>Sieg and Rider exchanged glances, and then looked at the shopkeeper.</p><p>\u201C\u2026Miss, can you eat all that?\u201D</p><p>\u201CI wouldn\u2019t order it if I couldn\u2019t eat it. Do you have it or not? If not, instead I\u2019ll have\u2014\u201D</p><p>When Saber was about to take out the menu again, the shopkeeper frantically stopped her.</p><p>\u201CIt\u2019s fine, I\u2019ll bring out everything you ordered!\u201D</p><p>The shopkeeper headed back to the kitchen in a panic. It appeared he was managing the shop by himself, based on the shop\u2019s smallness and old interior design. Fortunately, however, the shop wasn\u2019t unsanitary.</p><p>\u201CSo, what did you want to talk about?\u201D</p><p>When the shopkeeper was gone, Saber of Red immediately leaned forward.</p><p>\u201CDo you mind if I explain it from the beginning?\u201D</p><p>When Sieg asked her that, Saber of Red made a bitter face, but agreed as long as he kept it short.</p><p>Sieg first explained a little about his own origins\u2014and then spoke about what kind of Servant Assassin of Black had been.</p><p>And by the time he finished briefly explaining the illusion Assassin showed him, their order arrived at their table in large amounts.</p><p>\u201C\u2026Before grumbling about other things, let\u2019s eat first, okay?\u201D</p><p>\u201CAll right.\u201D</p><p>\u201CGood idea.\u201D</p><p>It wasn\u2019t that Saber of Red was fixated on eating. Rather, since she had a contract with a first-rate magus, she didn\u2019t even need to eat.</p><p>But that was that, and this was this. She was capable of eating. Moreover, she was a Servant, a being that existed outside of the world\u2019s logic.</p><p>80% of the reason she ate wasn\u2019t to fill her stomach, but out of pure curiosity.</p><p>\u201C\u2026Muu. I want to make another order, but that wouldn\u2019t be nice to the shopkeeper, and my stomach isn\u2019t particularly empty. I don\u2019t have any money, either.\u201D</p><p>\u201CBecause I\u2019m afraid of what would happen if I gave you money\u2026\u201D Sieg murmured seriously. Rider had been making a ruckus saying \u201CLet\u2019s buy that\u201D and \u201CLet\u2019s buy this\u201D ever since they left Trifas.</p><p>\u2026There was no meaning in buying a clearly fake platinum ring. Moreover, when Sieg declared it was a fake, the owner of the street stall became angry\u2014that was one of the few examples where Sieg made the disturbance worse.</p><p>Saber of Red greedily devoured her sandwich at a frightful pace and then moved on to attack her steak.</p><p>\u201CBy the way, where\u2019s your Master? That rough-looking guy wearing sunglasses.\u201D</p><p>Rider of Black raised a finger to his brow in curiosity.</p><p>\u201CHe\u2019s in the middle of working in his workshop. My presence there was in the way, so I went out.\u201D</p><p>\u201CWe\u2019re going to be using airplanes, but what about you guys?\u201D</p><p>\u201CI don\u2019t know either. But probably something similar? After all, it\u2019s those Hanging Gardens we\u2019re talking about.\u201D</p><p>\u201CTrue,\u201D Rider agreed with a nod.</p><p>Since they were going to a flying fortress, their means of getting there were limited. It would have to be either an aircraft or flight enabled by magecraft. And whichever method they chose, it didn\u2019t change the fact that the fortress would be firmly defended.</p><p>It didn\u2019t matter how frail their transport was. Even if there was an enchanted flight device that could withstand top-class spells, it would be no different than paper and plywood in the face of EX rank spells.</p><p>\u201CI think we can somehow make it through if my hippogriff seriously goes all out, though.\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2014\u2014\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2014\u2014\u201D</p><p>Saber of Red became speechless, and Sieg covered his eyes. Seeing their reactions, Rider asked \u201CWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201D while holding his sandwich.</p><p>\u201CHippogriff, hippogriff\u2026 Ah, could it be that you\u2019re that hero? From Charlemagne\u2019s something or other, Astolfo?\u201D</p><p>\u201CYeah, that\u2019s right. Wait, I didn\u2019t tell you that, did I?\u201D</p><p>\u201CYou didn\u2019t. I know about the guy beside you being Siegfried, though.\u201D</p><p>\u201CI see,\u201D said Rider of Black in a calm and accepting manner.</p><p>\u201C\u2026Well, learning it now doesn\u2019t make any difference.\u201D</p><p>Saber of Red didn\u2019t show much surprise.</p><p>\u201CRight? I was viciously beaten by you! But I\u2019ve changed Masters now, so there\u2019s no way to know how it will go next time, you know?\u201D</p><p>Saber of Red sneered and shrugged.</p><p>\u201CI\u2019m not going to be defeated to the likes of you. Idiots should think before speaking, idiot.\u201D</p><p>\u201CSomeone who calls someone else an idiot is an idiot!\u201D</p><p>\u201CHah?\u201D</p><p>\u2026As the atmosphere was getting somewhat dangerous, Sieg quickly raised his hand.</p><p>\u201CMore coffee, please!\u201D</p><p>Because he shouted it so loudly, the two Servants looked at Sieg in surprise.</p><p>\u201C\u2026Well, whatever. I\u2019ll also have more coffee.\u201D</p><p>\u201CMe too!\u201D</p><p>\u201CThat costs extra here.\u201D</p><p>The shopkeeper said that curtly, but Sieg said they didn\u2019t mind. He should still have at least that much money left.</p><p>\u201CNow then. You want an answer your question, about whether humans are good or bad, right?\u201D</p><p>When Sieg nodded, Saber of Red sighed as if astounded from the bottom of her heart.</p><p>\u201CAre you an idiot? Humans are humans, beasts that can become either good or bad depending on the situation. In the end, they\u2019re merely slightly intelligent animals that lose all manners and virtue when they lack food and clothing. I don\u2019t care about others. As long as I myself can continue living as a superior being\u2014got it?\u201D</p><p>Saber of Red\u2019s opinion was harsh and straightforward. She didn\u2019t see humans as either good or bad.</p><p>They merely\u2026 fell down either path depending on the situation. And they were all foolish. That\u2019s why she didn\u2019t care about others and only placed importance on herself.</p><p>\u201CDo you hate humans?\u201D</p><p>Saber of Red answered in the affirmative without flinching at Sieg\u2019s frank question.</p><p>\u201CI hate them. Even though they don\u2019t forget grudges, they forget the debts they owe to others. If something will disadvantage them, they\u2019ll avoid it even if they have to sacrifice everything around them. Even though they do good deeds when it\u2019s convenient, they don\u2019t mind overlooking great evil when it\u2019s troublesome for them. They act out of selfishness, and if they fail, they use the excuse of saying it\u2019s the fault of something besides themselves. They\u2019re not worth protecting for even a penny. That\u2019s what humans are. How about it, are you disappointed?\u201D</p><p>Having spoken her conclusion, Saber stabbed at her steak with her fork.</p><p>\u201CHmm\u2026 what a sad conclusion.\u201D</p><p>Saber of Red didn\u2019t waver even at Rider of Black\u2019s words. Sieg went into deep thought for a while, and then asked another question.</p><p>\u201CThen, Saber of Red, is that also the reason you rebelled when you were alive?\u201D</p><p>In an instant, the atmosphere chilled.</p><p>\u201C\u2026No. How I feel about humans had nothing to do with my rebellion. Don\u2019t speak of it again.\u201D</p><p>Saber of Red\u2019s gaze immediately became filled with killing intent. Most likely, if Sieg said anything further, she really would cut him down. Sieg wondered if she was a moody person. Certainly, just talking with her was a trial in and of itself.</p><p>\u201CBut hey, leaving aside the matter of the rebellion itself\u2014there were also people you followed you, weren\u2019t there?\u201D</p><p>Just when Sieg thought to close this subject, Rider of Black thoughtlessly stepped into the conversation. Perhaps also having thought the subject would end there, Saber of Red widened her eyes at Rider.</p><p>\u201CWeren\u2019t there people who adored you and put their life on the line to make you king? Do you despise them too? If so, I think that\u2019s sad.\u201D</p><p>Sieg felt as if his heart were being strangled, and he restrained his hand upon which his Command Spells were engraved. If they picked a fight in the middle of this huge city, and at midday at that, it would create a huge panic. But he didn\u2019t think that Rider of Black and Saber of Red were the type of people that could use that much self-control.</p><p>Even the completely unrelated shopkeeper seemed to notice the abnormal mood as he froze while carrying a coffeepot in hand.</p><p>But ignoring the two other people present who were stiff with fear, Saber of Red merely sighed and shrugged. It appeared there was no problem as long as it was a question about the people who followed her and not the facts of the rebellion itself.</p><p>\u201CNot really. They had to bet on me for their own reasons. They needed to rebel against King Arthur. Just as I don\u2019t despise those who rebelled against me, I have no intention of viewing those who served me as the same as me.\u201D</p><p>\u201CSo you despise them all equally?\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2014I\u2019m someone meant to become king. How can a king view the people the same as himself? Will the people be saved if the king cries and laughs with them? That\u2019s not it. That\u2019s not what a king should be.\u201D</p><p>Saber of Red quietly said that without any anger or scorn in her voice.</p><p>\u201CYou want to become king?\u201D</p><p>\u201CBasically, yeah. Because during my life\u2014I failed.\u201D</p><p>Saber clicked her tongue in annoyance. In other words, that was her wish for the Holy Grail.</p><p>Her declaration that she was \u2018someone meant to become king\u2019 was quite far off from reality. But neither Rider nor Sieg raised any eyebrows at it. At the very least, Sieg didn\u2019t think he had the right to disparage someone else\u2019s wish when he didn\u2019t have any wishes of his own.</p><p>\u201C\u2026What\u2019s with you two? You suddenly became quiet.\u201D</p><p>\u201CNo, nothing really. I can\u2019t refute your words. I never became king and\u2026 though I did think about becoming one a little, I only had enough ambition to \u2018accept it if it were offered to me\u2019.\u201D</p><p>\u201CLike Rider, I can\u2019t refute you either. The position of king is far too distant for me.\u201D</p><p>The only ones who had the right to say that her words were mistaken were those who were once kings\u2026 and those who tried to become kings like her.</p><p>\u201CAll wishes are equally precious. Well, I would have to object to a wish like humanity\u2019s annihilation, though. But your wish belongs to you alone. Finding fault with it would be wrong\u2014at least, that\u2019s my philosophy.\u201D</p><p>Rider of Black replied with an unusually serious expression, causing Saber of Red to unpleasantly fall silent. Rider then asked her another question as if to take advantage of that opening.</p><p>\u201CBut\u2014still, even so, there\u2019s one thing I\u2019d like to ask. Do you want to become a bad king, or a good king?\u201D</p><p>Rider of Black asked that question not as a king himself, but as a retainer who had served a king.</p><p>It was a simple question, but one that couldn\u2019t be avoided.</p><p>\u2026Saber of Red\u2019s expression distorted slightly. She tried to open her mouth, but hesitated slightly and turned her gaze to the side.</p><p>And then, she squeezed out a short sentence.</p><p>\u201C\u2014A good king, obviously.\u201D</p><p>Rider of Black merely murmured \u201CI see\u201D in response. Afterwards, Saber of Red finished her coffee and stood up.</p><p>\u201CYou\u2019re leaving?\u201D</p><p>\u201COur business here is done\u2026 Or do you have something else to ask?\u201D</p><p>Sieg shook his head. She had seriously told him her opinion from another point of view, different from that of Ruler, Rider and Archer of Black.</p><p>He didn\u2019t completely agree with it. But he didn\u2019t fully reject it either. Right now, he was still in the stage of thinking about it.</p><p>\u201CNo, there\u2019s nothing else. Thank you, it was useful as a reference,\u201D Sieg replied.</p><p>Saber of Red then gave a bold smile and ruffled Sieg\u2019s hair roughly.</p><p>\u201CThen the next time I\u2019ll see you guys will be at the Hanging Gardens. Make sure to survive until then!\u201D</p><p>With those final words, she gallantly left the shop. Watching her leave, Sieg murmured with a sigh.</p><p>\u201C\u2026She ate that much and yet left without paying her share.\u201D</p><p>\u201CShe really is like a king in that regard,\u201D Rider of Black said as he burst into laughter.</p><hr><p>While walking through the streets, Saber of Red thought back on the earlier question.</p><p>\u201CWhat kind of king\u2014huh?\u201D</p><p>Saber of Red had answered \u2018a good king\u2019. That wasn\u2019t a lie. At the very least, she had no intention of being a bad king that would be struck down by another hero.</p><p>But, in the first place, what should she do to become a good king? She should probably rule not tyrannically, but benevolently. As long as the confrontational relationship with neighboring countries wasn\u2019t resolved, she should train and strengthen her nation\u2019s soldiers\u2014No, that wasn\u2019t it.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t something so obvious. Rider of Black seemed to have been asking a much more fundamental question.</p><p>\u2014What kind of king do you want to become?</p><p>Saber of Red thought it over. Right now, she was fighting in order to become king. If she challenged the Sword of Selection that bestowed the qualifications of a king, she was sure that she would pull it out.</p><p>She wanted to become the ideal king. She wanted to become a king that could protect everyone that she should protect, a king that everyone wished for.</p><p>Then, should she become the ideal king of the masses like her father?</p><p>Or should she become a greedy king who would drag down everyone for the sake of granting her own dream?</p><p>An ideal king would surely feel suffocating. A greedy king would surely be despised by the people.</p><p>Saber of Red absentmindedly watched the people walking down the streets. According to the knowledge the Holy Grail had given her, this country of Romania still had fresh scars from when it was ruled by a tyrant.</p><p>He had ruled tyrannically under twisted delusions and had possessed a gorgeous palace constructed meaninglessly. In the end, the tyrant was struck down by a rebellion.</p><p>I won\u2019t become that kind of king, thought Saber of Red.</p><p>Then, should he become a perfect king that sacrificed herself for her ideals like her father? Even though even her father had been forced to bend down in defeat halfway down that path?</p><p>\u201C\u2026Damn it.\u201D</p><p>Rider had pointed out the very thing she had averted her eyes from.</p><p>She had merely yearned to \u2018become king\u2019\u2014while never looking at what lay beyond that goal at all.</p><p>Had other kings seen it? Tyrants, wise rulers and even foolish rulers who had left their names in history\u2014had they seen what lay beyond the establishment of their rule?</p><p>What had her father, Arthur Pendragon, tried to see in the future of the country she ruled?</p><p>\u201C\u2026What future? It was all destroyed by me.\u201D</p><p>Saber of Red gave a self-deprecating smile. King Arthur\u2019s rule had gone well. She had certainly guided Britain into peace. The one who spoiled all that was none other than Saber of Red herself.</p><p>What was so bad about it\u2014? After all, she hadn\u2019t regretted it even once.</p><p>Many people had lost their lives in that rebellion, including her and even her father who as a knight had tried to be the sword and shield of the people.</p><p>But, if she hadn\u2019t rebelled, the soul of the knight known as Mordred would have died.</p><p>Not acknowledged by anyone, gaining no interest from anyone, not loved by anyone or loving anyone. A peaceful world was a wonderful thing. The people who wagered their lives for its sake were also wonderful.</p><p>But why had the one who had given up everything for the sake of that wonderful dream not received even a little bit of affection?</p><p>She didn\u2019t even think of asking to be loved. If at least\u2026 if at least some interest had been shown towards her, if she had been at least looked at, that alone would have been enough.</p><p>What a foolish thing to say. You would never have been satisfied. You would have endlessly sought love, sought compassion and finally sought the right to the throne, until you spoiled that peaceful rule in the end\u2014</p><p>A whisper came from deep inside her. Though she felt irritated at it, she also agreed with it.</p><p>That might be true, Saber of Red thought, reflecting on herself. After all, she didn\u2019t even know what affection was. Was it sweet, bitter, sour or bland?</p><p>\u2026But all people in this world sought it. It was surely a habitual thing, like a narcotic.</p><p>Until evening came, Saber of Red sat on a bench in a small park and stared up at the sky with her head in the clouds. She couldn\u2019t laugh at that homunculus. He was struggling and worrying over how to view human beings, but Saber of Red was struggling over what it meant to be king.</p><p>From the perspective of others, either worry was probably something people would laugh at as a stupid joke. But if they didn\u2019t obsess over these things, neither she nor that boy would be able to live\u2014</p><p>She passed the time like that for a little while, but in the end, no one appeared to try and talk to her.</p><p>When she returned to the hotel, Shishigou appeared to have finished his work and was wiping his sweat off with a towel.</p><p>\u201CWelcome back. Did anything happen?\u201D</p><p>Thinking that there was no particular reason to report what happened at lunch, Saber merely replied, \u201CNope, nothing.\u201D Then, just as her Master was heartily drinking some mineral water, Saber made up her mind and asked him.</p><p>\u201CHey, Master. Have you ever loved someone?\u201D</p><p>Naturally, Shishigou choked badly in response. After desperately coughing, he looked at his Servant reproachfully.</p><p>\u201CWhat\u2019s with this all of a sudden? That\u2019s a very odd question\u2014\u201D</p><p>\u201CIt doesn\u2019t matter why. Have you, Master?\u201D</p><p>Surmising that she wasn\u2019t teasing him, but asking it seriously, Shishigou started to think it over while rubbing his beard.</p><p>\u201C\u2026In what sense do you mean? Like love for one\u2019s family, or love for a lover?\u201D</p><p>\u201CIs there a difference? Then either one is fine. Have you ever loved?\u201D</p><p>Saber of Red leaned forward and stared at Shishigou. She didn\u2019t seem like she would retreat a single step until she heard his answer.</p><p>\u201CI haven\u2019t.\u201D</p><p>\u201CLike I thought, that\u2019s how magi are.\u201D</p><p>\u201CHey, that\u2019s prejudice. No, that view of magi isn\u2019t exactly mistaken\u2014but a magus can also love someone in their own way.\u201D</p><p>Though, that love was probably a little different from the kind of love that Saber of Red was asking about. To be a magus and to attain greatness as a magus was their happiness, so their love was often far from normal love, taking a twisted form. They had their own way of expressing love, in other words.</p><p>\u201CIn my case, I\u2019ve been divorced from my wife since a long time ago. I wasn\u2019t able to produce any children, and you already know what happened to my adopted child. My father disowned me the moment I decided to be a bounty hunter.\u201D</p><p>His wife had been a woman who thought the prosperity of her family was everything, as proper for a magus. She divorced him before love or even the appearance of love could form between them. He could only vaguely remember her face at this point.</p><p>His father had tried to do whatever it took to make a successor without giving up. But Shishigou Kairi had declared that one sacrifice was enough and left home. His father had been completely opposed to his decision back then. Magi hired by his father had attacked him several times in order to take back his Crest as well.</p><p>His mother\u2014was someone who he didn\u2019t care whether she was there or not. She hadn\u2019t been involved in raising him at all; she was simply the woman who gave birth to him.</p><p>\u201CWhat, so you haven\u2019t known love either, Master?\u201D</p><p>\u201CI do know about it. I just never had any luck with it.\u201D</p><p>And most of all, he had no interest in it. The world of decent and respectable people extolled it loudly. Love is everything, love is life, love is a great thing that conquers all\u2014</p><p>Shishigou, who lived in the unrespectable world, knew. Love was simply a tense state of mind, and it didn\u2019t have any useful impact on the use of magecraft and weapons. Rather, it increased the chances of failure instead of success.</p><p>To magi, love was unnecessary\u2014even if they understood that it was something precious for humans.</p><p>\u201C\u2026Tch. Like I thought, magi are no good.\u201D</p><p>Saber clicked her tongue annoyingly\u2014and Shishigou smiled wryly.</p><p>\u201CMagi are pretty much failures as human beings, Saber.\u201D</p><p>\u201CMaster. I will pull out the Sword of Selection. I must pull it out. And I will become king.\u201D</p><p>Shishigou nodded silently. And then, Saber spoke frustratingly.</p><p>\u201CBut that\u2019s as far as I can imagine. What should I do in order to become a king that surpasses the King of Knights\u2014I don\u2019t know what to do at all.\u201D</p><p>Her worry was earnest and poignant.</p><p>\u201CAnd that made you think of loving someone?\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2026I don\u2019t understand it. I don\u2019t understand it, so I thought I should become a king different from my father.\u201D</p><p>Mordred\u2019s father\u2014the legendary king whose fame extended across the world, Arthur Pendragon. The great and unequaled hero who had struggled through many wars and succeeded in uniting Britain.</p><p>\u201CMy father\u2019s reign was absolutely perfect. Perfectly impartial and upright. He understood that ten couldn\u2019t be maintained, so he took nine and cast away one. There was neither hesitation nor confusion in his actions. All except in regard to me.\u201D</p><p>As she spoke of her father, Saber of Red\u2019s eyes shined blazingly. Saber held both fanatic faith and freezing hatred towards her father.</p><p>Both of them were correct feelings and correct views.</p><p>\u201CMaster, what\u2014\u2014\u201D</p><p>\u2018What should I do?\u2019 was the question she couldn\u2019t bring herself to ask. She understood enough to know that this wasn\u2019t a question Shishigou could answer for her.</p><p>Shishigou blew out smoke form the cigar he had lit without her noticing and spoke to his Servant.</p><p>\u201C\u2026Well, I do understand one thing.\u201D</p><p>\u201CWhat?\u201D</p><p>\u201CYou have to face your father.\u201D</p><p>\u201CFace my father\u2014\u201D</p><p>\u201CI understand you hate him. I also understand how much you admire him as well. But those feelings come from chasing after him. If you\u2019re going to surpass him, then analyze. Your father, other people and yourself. Observe, analyze, sort everything out, and reach a conclusion.\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2026I don\u2019t particularly admire him.\u201D</p><p>Saber of Red turned the other way annoyingly. Shishigou would only be stirring up a hornet\u2019s nest if he retorted the wrong way, so he merely murmured, \u201CIs that so?\u201D</p><p>\u201CWell, it served as a good reference. Thanks, Master.\u201D</p><p>\u201CYou\u2019re welcome. Now then, we\u2019ll remain on stand by for a little while until the Yggdmillennia guys move\u2026 My gut is telling me that the next fight is going to be the last battle. Once it\u2019s over, I\u2019ll get my reward for this job and you\u2019ll grant your wish with the Holy Grail and challenge the Sword of Selection. I\u2019d like to see it happen as thanks for our partnership until now, but I suppose that\u2019s impossible.\u201D</p><p>It was unclear how she would challenge the Sword of Selection. But if her wish was granted properly by the Holy Grail, it would undoubtedly require jumping beyond the concept of time and space.</p><p>He didn\u2019t think a mere magus like himself could cross over it to watch.</p><p>Even so, he still wished to see the moment she became king. Did he feel that way out of loneliness, or was it simply a selfish whim on his part\u2014?</p><p>\u201CDon\u2019t worry about it. You\u2019ll also grant your wish at that moment, Master. As if either of us would have the time to think about the other then\u2014\u201D</p><p>Just as she finished saying that, Saber burst into laughter. Shishigou frowned at her sudden mirth.</p><p>\u201CHey, what is it?\u201D</p><p>\u201CNo\u2026 I just remembered your wish. To have descendants, right?\u201D</p><p>\u201CIt\u2019s not something to laugh at. I\u2019m serious here.\u201D</p><p>Saber waved her arms while laughing as if to hold him back.</p><p>\u201CNo, that\u2019s not it. If your wish is granted, that means you\u2019ll have children, right? Shishigou Junior\u2026\u201D</p><p>After having managed to say that much, she was unable to hold back and started laughing again. Most likely, she was imagining in her head a baby wearing sunglasses and smoking a cigar.</p><p>\u201CMaster\u2019s child\u2026 kukuku\u2026 No good, it\u2019s too hilarious to imagine!\u201D</p><p>\u201CDon\u2019t go off and imagine someone else\u2019s child and then laugh. Unbelievable\u2014\u201D</p><p>Even as he was astounded by her behavior, Shishigou\u2019s lips curved into a smile.</p><p>Saber of Red\u2019s worries were likely so serious it would affect her continued existence. It wasn\u2019t something that Shishigou could speak on any further.</p><p>Because he and she weren\u2019t partners walking the same path, but merely cooperators joined out of mutual interest. Her path and his path would eventually diverge from each other.</p><p>\u2014Suddenly, something like a passing demon seized Shishigou\u2019s heart.</p><p>He opened his mouth, but stopped himself just before he put it into words. Even if he was a magus, Shishigou was the type to worry over omens and jinxes.</p><p>Naturally, speaking or even thinking of an impossible future was an ill omen.</p><p>\u201CNow then, Master. What do we do next?\u201D</p><p>Saber of Red leaned forward readily.</p><p>\u201CNext?\u201D</p><p>\u201CYeah. You\u2019ve finished your preparations, right? What do we do now?\u201D</p><p>\u201CAh, that\u2019s what you mean. Next\u2014we wait.\u201D</p><p>\u201CI see, we wait, huh\u2026 Until when?\u201D</p><p>\u201CWho knows? I said so earlier, but we can\u2019t do anything until the others start moving.\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2026Could it be that there\u2019s nothing to do?\u201D</p><p>\u201COf course there is. I have calls to make, reports to write and my mind to sharpen. There\u2019s a ton of stuff to do.\u201D</p><p>\u201CAnything for me to do!?\u201D</p><p>\u201CNone\u2014if I said that, would you get angry? Yeah, you\u2019d get angry.\u201D</p><p>\u201CI won\u2019t get angry! But I\u2019ll go on a rampage!\u201D</p><p>Saber growled like a mad dog. Shishigou sighed and handed over a DVD he had purchased while she was out in town.</p><p>\u201CWhat\u2019s this?\u201D</p><p>The image of a fighter plane scattering flames and flying through the air was on the package cover. It wasn\u2019t an actual photo, but rather seemed to be an extremely realistic drawing.</p><p>\u201CGo watch it. This is what you need to do right now.\u201D</p><p>Shishigou said that while puffing out his chest proudly.</p><p>\u201CThis? Really\u2026?\u201D</p><p>Even as she grumbled, she put the DVD in the video player prepared in their hotel room. After three minutes of the movie playing, Saber began to get engrossed in watching it.</p><hr><p>When nighttime came, Ruler arrived at the hideout.</p><p>\u201CSorry I\u2019m late\u2026\u201D</p><p>After Ruler apologized, Sieg replied in a badgering manner.</p><p>\u201CYou really are late. It\u2019s already deep into the night. This city is extremely dangerous at night. Wouldn\u2019t it have been better for you to come tomorrow instead?\u201D</p><p>\u201CAhaha. I don\u2019t think it makes much difference for me whether it\u2019s dangerous or not.\u201D</p><p>Actually, she had gotten involved in various ruckuses on the way to the hideout\u2014or rather, she seemed to have willingly gotten herself involved.</p><p>When she encountered people who had tried to use violence against others, she thoroughly carved the brutality of violence into them. When she encountered people who tried to cajole others with sweet words, she had smashed them with a pure and sound argument right on the spot.</p><p>Thanks to that, she had ended up arriving far later than planned\u2026 Ruler thus explained and apologized.</p><p>\u201CWell, you probably won\u2019t get injured, let alone die, no matter what trouble you get involved in, But even if it isn\u2019t dangerous for you, I don\u2019t think you should proactively involve yourself in trouble.\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2026Fufu.\u201D</p><p>Ruler giggled as if strangely enjoying herself. \u201CWhat\u2019s so funny?\u201D Sieg asked as his frown deepened.</p><p>\u201CNo, I\u2019m laughing at something to do with me. More importantly, where\u2019s Rider? Don\u2019t tell me he went out or is rampaging out in the streets or is running naked out in the streets\u2026!?\u201D</p><p>\u201CRider isn\u2019t that ba\u2014no, he might be that bad, but he isn\u2019t causing any problems right now. He went into the bath.\u201D</p><p>\u201CI-Is that so? I dirtied my hands a little, so I\u2019ll be borrowing your washroom.\u201D</p><p>She seemed to have dirtied her hands with blood while saving and treating a victim. She couldn\u2019t leave it like that forever, but she also felt awkward over washing off the blood in the kitchen sink, so Ruler tried to go into the washroom.</p><p>\u201C\u2026Ah, is that all right?\u201D</p><p>\u201CWhat\u2019s all right?\u201D</p><p>\u201CNo, I mean, Rider is in the bath\u2026\u201D</p><p>Most homes had the washroom and bath adjoined to each other. There was a possibility that Rider would come out from the bath while she was in there.</p><p>\u201CAh, there\u2019s no problem. Neither I nor Rider are that bashful.\u201D</p><p>After all\u2014</p><p>\u201CWe\u2019re the same gender.\u201D</p><p>After saying that, she stepped into the washroom and shut the door. Sieg stood there dumbfounded at her words for a little while.</p><p>\u201CWai\u2014\u2014\u201D</p><p><img src="https://i3.lensdump.com/i/1sfUR9.jpg" alt=""></p><p>Somehow managing to reorganize his chaotic thoughts, Sieg finally realized that Ruler was under a fatal misunderstanding, and he hurriedly tried to call her back\u2026 but by then it was too late.</p><p>As Ruler was scrupulously washing the blood off her hands with soap in the washroom, the door to the bath opened and a voice said \u201CHuh?\u201D in surprise. Ruler turned around with a smile.</p><p>\u201CAh, Rider. If you\u2019re getting out, could you let me go in next\u2014\u2014\u201D</p><p>The next instant.</p><p>The world stood still. (Or perhaps history shook.)</p><hr><p>Having received, through Assassin of Red, a notice from their Master Shirou to convene together, the Red Servants gathered in the throne room.</p><p>\u201C\u2014According to my doves, the Black camp has finally begun to move. Though it\u2019s later than expected, they will likely arrive here in around four days through some means.\u201D</p><p>The Red Servants accepted this news without surprise.</p><p>\u201C\u2026You didn\u2019t call us all here just for that, right?\u201D</p><p>At Lancer of Red\u2019s question, Shirou nodded and raised his right arm. The countless Command Spells engraved on it shined with a dull light.</p><p>\u201CI\u2019m sorry, but I won\u2019t be able to command you all on the front lines. However, that will make it difficult for me to immediately react if Ruler uses her Command Spells. Therefore, I will use two Command Spells on each of you and raise your resistance to any Command Spells from her.\u201D</p><p>Both their Master\u2019s Command Spells and Ruler\u2019s Command Spells had equal power of compulsion. Therefore, by limiting the activation conditions and using two Command Spells to do it, Shirou could repulse Ruler\u2019s Command Spells with almost no time loss.</p><p>\u201CThat\u2019s quite excessive of you.\u201D</p><p>When Rider of Red murmured that, Shirou smiled boldly.</p><p>\u201CThen do you all need extra assistance from a Command Spell in battle at this point?\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2014No.\u201D</p><p>Lancer and Archer, who were also going to fight on the front lines, didn\u2019t voice any objections either. If possible, they also wanted to avoid the pitiful end of being forced to kill themselves by Ruler\u2019s Command Spells.</p><p>\u201CThen I wish you all luck in battle.\u201D</p><p>The Command Spells on his arm gradually shined brighter.</p><p>\u201CI order my Servants with my Command Spells\u2014\u2014\u201D</p><p>Rider and the other Servants then left, leaving only Shirou, Assassin and Caster in the throne room.</p><p>Shirou spoke up.</p><p>\u201CAssassin, Caster. With this, my role in the coming battle is finished. I\u2019ll leave the rest to you all.\u201D</p><p>\u201CDo you have a chance at succeeding?\u201D</p><p>\u201CI do. The Fuyuki Greater Grail doesn\u2019t have anything that can be called a will. It is an automated machine that lacks the will of a master. If I can reach the core without opposing it or coming into contact with it\u2014\u201D</p><p>\u201CYour wish will be granted.\u201D</p><p>Assassin of Red smiled. But Shirou shook his head and corrected her.</p><p>\u201CThis isn\u2019t my wish, but the wish of everyone in this world\u2014Assassin.\u201D</p><p>The happy conclusion that everyone desired and continued to wish for in the depths of their heart.</p><p>\u201CIn other words, a brilliant summer shall arrive! And thus I will have written another masterpiece as well.\u201D</p><p>\u201CExactly. Though we have to take down the members of the Black camp to do that.\u201D</p><p>\u201COh my, you\u2019re not confident of our odds?\u201D</p><p>\u201CAs if.\u201D</p><p>Assassin of Red\u2019s lips twisted into a smile. Though it would be a different story anywhere else, there wasn\u2019t any need to doubt their victory if they fought in these Hanging Gardens.</p><p>\u201CAlso, we have Caster\u2019s Noble Phantasm, right? However\u2014I still have doubts. It\u2019s true that Noble Phantasms are objects that embody and realize miracles, but\u2026 Can it really do such a thing?\u201D</p><p>\u201CWell\u2026 who knows?\u201D</p><p>Assassin glared in response to Shirou\u2019s vague words.</p><p>\u201CIf it works just as Caster says, it only manifests possibilities. In theory, it should be possible. We don\u2019t need to worry about prana either. Though I\u2019m somewhat uneasy about it, I will be defenceless until I completely bring the Holy Grail under my control. And if Lancer ends up being killed, you\u2019ll have to make a last stand here. But most of all\u2014it seems fun.\u201D</p><p>Assassin could only stare dumbfounded at hearing those final words. On the other hand, Caster nodded elatedly as if he understood and agreed.</p><p>\u201CYes, the insatiable pursuit of amusement itself is essential. Then, using all the power of my treasured Noble Phantasm, I will show you the power of the written word, which not even swords, magecraft, fire, or lightning can match!\u201D</p><p>Watching Caster and Shirou swell with excitement, Assassin gave a small sigh of exasperation.</p><hr><p>\u2014\u2014Now then.</p><p>Naturally, there were good reasons for why Ruler left to go to the hideout in Bucharest later than the other two. One was to have a negotiation session with Fiore, who had asked Sieg to help their side.</p><p>\u201CYou want me to write a contract?\u201D</p><p>\u201CYes. A contract that guarantees the safety and well-being of the homunculi. Currently, you\u2019ve only made a verbal promise, and there will be no one to protect them after we leave.\u201D</p><p>\u201CThey\u2019re stronger than I am, though\u2014\u201D</p><p>Gordes, who had earnestly been taking care of the homunculi\u2019s tuning and adjustments, had been spewing nothing but idle complaints lately. Perhaps because he was always being dragged away by the homunculi whenever an abnormality occurred among them regardless of the time of day, even when he was eating or sleeping, the glint in his eyes had started to shine blazingly like those of an emergency hospital doctor. He had no vigor left, but he was uplifted by a half self-destructive desperation.</p><p>\u201CBut you\u2019re right. It\u2019s impossible to believe the words of a magus without any form of guarantee.\u201D</p><p>\u201CYes, so I\u2019d like to ask you to enter into a security guarantee contract with the homunculi. Once that\u2019s been confirmed, we\u2019ll move on to the agreement we made earlier.\u201D</p><p>Fiore thought it over for a while, and then nodded, stating it wasn\u2019t a bad deal. Either way, if they won, she and the rest of Yggdmillennia would no longer have any jobs to give them. They would only be able to do maintenance on the castle ramparts at most.</p><p>\u201CThen, I\u2019ll make the contract with the homunculi\u2014\u201D</p><p>\u201CNee-san, you\u2019re going to make a contract with these homunculi? I think their self of sense has developed too much for that, though.\u201D</p><p>At Caules\u2019 words, Fiore covered her mouth and said, \u201COh my.\u201D Just as he said, in a contract between magi, one\u2019s full name was had a lot of importance attached to it. A name was like an address that every being had.</p><p>When using curses, the target\u2019s true name was indispensable information as well. If the curse wasn\u2019t restrained to a specific existence like a name, it would disperse without any effect.</p><p>And these homunculi had started to develop a sense of self the moment they chose not to obey orders. In other words, there was ample reason to fear that simply referring to them all as [homunculi] as they had up until now could create an obstacle in forming a contract.</p><p>\u201CHave no fear. Gordes-dono has given us all names,\u201D stated Tool as she and the rest of the gathered homunculi nodded.</p><p>\u201CI don\u2019t know whether or not it will work with the contract. I don\u2019t think there will be a problem, though.\u201D</p><p>Gordes looked away in a sulky manner. He couldn\u2019t be embarrassed, could he? Caules thought, but judging from his expression, he really did seem to be sulking.</p><p>\u201CMy, how serious and diligent of you, Gordes-oji-sama.\u201D</p><p>And Fiore praised Gordes without minding his behavior at all. When he was praised, Gordes became even sulkier. What a difficult old man, Caules thought with a sigh.</p><p>\u201CThen there should be no obstacles to the contract. We\u2019ll make it by slightly adjusting the regular content of a contract between magi. Basically, in exchange for allowing your residence in this castle, I\u2019d merely like for you to help with routine chores and the maintenance of the castle ramparts. I don\u2019t have any problem with you leaving either. However, please refrain from acts that will be scowled upon by the Association of Magi.\u201D</p><p>\u201CThere aren\u2019t that many homunculi among us who want to leave. But there are some problems with legal identification and such\u2014\u201D</p><p>\u201CHmm\u2026 we can provide that much at least.\u201D</p><p>Fiore added in several modifications to the contract content that Caules suggested, and then presented it to the leader of the homunculi, Tool. When she accepted it, she frowned.</p><p>\u201CWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201D</p><p>\u201CNo, it\u2019s just that this whole deal went more smoothly than I thought. I wondered if you might have added in a trap somewhere or not.\u201D</p><p>\u201CYou\u2019re quite distrustful, aren\u2019t you?\u201D</p><p>Gordes goggled at her in shock.</p><p>\u201CIf you think about how we\u2019ve been treated until now, isn\u2019t it only right to think that way?\u201D Tool responded coolly.</p><p>\u201CNow, now,\u201D Fiore said as she soothed the two of them. \u201CPlease calm down. It\u2019s precisely because I thought I might be doubted that I asked the judge of the Great Holy Grail War to arbitrate these negotiations.\u201D</p><p>Ruler received the contract and seriously read it over.</p><p>Incidentally, Ruler\u2014Jeanne d\u2019Arc\u2014didn\u2019t truly understand contract stipulations. She was simply more sensitive to deceptions of this kind than others by nature.</p><p>Her final year before her death in particular was a battle of words and sentences. Clergymen had tried to trip her up with various questions. In order to overcome that, Jeanne had faced them with the same seriousness she had on the battlefield.</p><p>While passing her eyes over the contract, she sometimes glanced at Fiore who had written it and Caules and Gordes who had helped in doing so. There was no deceit or malice in their eyes. Gordes\u2019 somewhat rude attitude was simple sulking on his part and didn\u2019t seem to be anything else.</p><p>She thought of the merits and demerits of lying in this situation\u2014the merits were too few and the demerits were too big. It was fine to conclude that there weren\u2019t any lies in concern to this contract.</p><p>\u201CThere doesn\u2019t seem to be any problem. Just in case, I\u2019d like for everyone to look at it as well.\u201D</p><p>After saying that, Ruler passed the contract to Tool. Tool and the surrounding homunculi then began to carefully read it with serious expressions on their faces. Normally, homunculi were only dolls that obeyed the orders of their creator. But now they were seriously gazing at a contract that had been written in regards to them.</p><p>In other words, that was proof of their developing ego. However, that couldn\u2019t be called unilaterally good. The ego included thoughts to increase personal gain as much as possible. That could also lead to committing crimes as a result.</p><p>It could lead them to step over others for personal gain\u2014However, at the same time, Ruler optimistically thought that it wouldn\u2019t be a problem for them.</p><p>They were beings created for the profit of others. They probably would never forgive the act of stepping over others for personal gain and never do so themselves either.</p><p>At the very least, Sieg believed in them. So she would believe in them as well.</p><p>\u201C\u2026There doesn\u2019t seem to be any problem. Then we just need to sign this contract?\u201D</p><p>\u201CYes, please sign it with a drop of your blood as well.\u201D</p><p>By combining one\u2019s name and the blood from one\u2019s body, it greatly strengthened the contract. There were also contracts that enforced binding even onto one\u2019s descendants, but this one wasn\u2019t that strong. But that wouldn\u2019t be a problem. The chances that Yggdmillennia would be involved with them for generations were extremely low.</p><p>When the gathered homunculi finished signing the contract, Fiore turned to Ruler.</p><p>\u201CNow then, may we take care of the matter I mentioned earlier?\u201D</p><p>\u201CI don\u2019t mind. Should we start right away?\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2026Yes. I have to do it now, or my resolution will wane later.\u201D</p><p>Fiore smiled bitterly\u2014and Caules\u2019 face became grave. Gordes silently left his seat. Even if they were part of the same clan, he wasn\u2019t a magus of the Forvedge family. If he tried to watch what happened next, they would have to kill him.</p><p>What Fiore had requested of Ruler was her help in transplanting the Forvedge family\u2019s Magic Crest.</p><p>The Magic Crest would be gradually transplanted from Fiore to Caules. Fortunately, Caules had been born as Fiore\u2019s spare. His body had been adjusted since birth so that he could have it transplanted to him at any time should the situation require it.</p><p>The problem was that, because the magus whose job it normally was to do the transplant procedure wasn\u2019t present, Fiore had to do the transplant while making necessary adjustments on her own. Moreover, in order for Caules to be acknowledged as the family successor, she had to transplant a very large portion of the Crest to him.</p><p>At the very least half of it, or if possible, 70% of it. Naturally, the cost of doing so was great. By halving the Crest she had, Fiore\u2019s prana stores would drop sharply, and Caules wouldn\u2019t be able to handle it satisfactorily for a while after it was transplanted.</p><p>But the situation had already surpassed what a Master could singlehandedly deal with. Since the Red camp\u2019s only Master was Amakusa Shirou Tokisada, this Holy Grail War now consisted of battle between Servants alone. Therefore, the two siblings were completely meaningless in terms of fighting power.</p><p>However, normally a Magic Crest was gradually transplanted from a young age. No matter how much her younger brother Caules\u2019 body had been adjusted for the transplant, doing such a large transplant at once naturally came with danger.</p><p>Therefore, they had requested that Archer, who was deeply knowledgeable about magecraft, and Ruler, who could use healing to a certain extent, be present during the transplantation.</p><p>\u201C\u2026I truly am lucky to be attended by two Servants.\u201D</p><p>Fiore giggled. Caules sighed and grumbled.</p><p>\u201CI didn\u2019t think I would suddenly get 70% of it at once\u2026\u201D</p><p>\u201CAre you nervous?\u201D</p><p>Caules shrugged at Archer\u2019s question.</p><p>\u201CI only have meager Magic Circuits, after all.\u201D</p><p>He answered lightly\u2014but from another magus\u2019 perspective, it was an event worthy of fainting over. If their parents heard about it, they\u2019d probably be prepared to kill Caules over it.</p><p>Frankly speaking, this act was effectively a crime in the eyes of magi. They were going to transfer the family\u2019s inheritance to the inferior sibling rather than the superior sibling, after all.</p><p>Moreover, it wasn\u2019t because the superior sibling was particularly inconvenienced or impaired by something. This was simply in order for her to go from a magus to a normal human.</p><p>They used Fiore\u2019s room for the Crest transplant ritual. The two siblings lay down together on the bed, closed their eyes, and synchronized their minds. The human mind was tougher and stiffer than people thought. So first they had to start by fusing them.</p><p>Ice wouldn\u2019t fuse together no matter how much time passed. It had to become water and melt together\u2014and then freeze once more. Naturally, if they failed even one step, two broken down people would be created due to their personalities fusing together.</p><p>\u201CThen, please begin the sympathizing process.\u201D</p><p>Archer of Black spoke quietly.</p><p>Even so, Fiore had chosen this. She neither hated the life of a magus that was always adjoined with death, nor did she fear battle, but she had understood that it was impossible for her.</p><p>She would never have the kind resolve her younger brother did. No matter how far she strived, she was just a normal person deep down.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014They melted.</p><p>They mingled\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>\u201CCaules. You\u2019re going a little too fast. Please calm down.\u201D</p><p>\u201CI know, but this sensation is just\u2014\u201D</p><p>The crystallization of everything their family had cultivated through desperate struggle and battle was suddenly divided in half.</p><p>They were instantly attacked by a terrifying feeling of nothingness. Their ancestors whom they had never met severely condemned them with dark faces. What are you doing!? You siblings have done something unforgivable!</p><p>The older sister cowered, but the younger brother spurred her on.</p><p>So what? he spat out. The one to take responsibility for this is me, not my sister, he shouted.</p><p>It\u2019s true this might throw us back by a hundred or two hundred years. So what? I am Forvedge, I am Yggdmillennia.</p><p>I won\u2019t acknowledge any objections.</p><p>\u201COh no, his body is reacting to the foreign sensation of the Magic Crest\u2026 Ruler, please calm down Caules-dono!\u201D</p><p>\u201CYes, understood! Listen, Caules. Can you hear me? Listen to my words\u2026!\u201D</p><p>Hundreds of years\u2019 worth of obsession attacked the youngster who brazenly didn\u2019t know his place. He saw a ghastly miracle that resembled hell\u2014and he succumbed and fell in love as he witnessed his family\u2019s founder who had tried to change from a human into a magus.</p><p>He had yearned for magecraft, had loved magecraft and had become inhuman with little effort.</p><p>Like a sword, the founder\u2019s tenacity pierced the heart of the boy who claimed he would be the next successor. If he let himself throw it up, it would mean exposing his own soul.</p><p>But it still felt terribly revolting. His entrails were crushed inside his body as he rode a merry-go-round that endlessly sped up. It rose in his throat\u2014would he feel better if he threw it up?</p><p>Just let it out and ease yourself, someone whispered. He thrust his hand into his mouth and tried to drag out the thing in his throat along with his entrails.</p><p>\u201CIt\u2019s all right. \u2014You\u2019re all right.\u201D</p><p>Suddenly, the voice of a holy maiden came down from the heavens.</p><p>Instantly, the desert was overturned and became green tracts of land. The refreshing smell of grass immediately caused his urge to vomit to disappear. The boy kicked his feet off the ground and lightly began to walk.</p><p>\u201C\u2026All right. He seems to have calmed down. It\u2019s almost done. Just hold on a little while longer, Master.\u201D</p><p>He heard someone\u2019s\u2026 gentle voice. He thought its calm tone was appropriate for these grassy plains.</p><p>He walked, walked, walked\u2014and arrived.</p><p>This was the final part of the Crest. There was nothing new about this place for him, which lay in the memories of his older sister who had been with him since he was young. This was the place where the two siblings had used to play in the past. A perfectly ordinary flower garden near their home.</p><p>They had always been together. He had been aware that she would sometimes turn around to confirm his presence. As if to say that being by herself was lonely, that she hated solitude.</p><p>That\u2019s why he kept saying \u201CIt can\u2019t be helped\u201D to himself and always followed after her.</p><p>\u2014It was the younger brother\u2019s duty to follow after his older sister, after all.</p><p>He had thought they might be together forever.</p><p>He had also thought that they couldn\u2019t be together forever.</p><p>When he had gotten dragged into the Great Holy Grail War, he had merely sighed at himself as a magus\u2014but he had thought it was still better than if they were in a normal Holy Grail War.</p><p>He had thought they would survive and be together again\u2014but as expected, the girl had ended up having to face herself in this Great Holy Grail War.</p><p>Having grown up, she made a choice. It was a cruel choice that no one else would ever understand.</p><p>But the younger brother was happy just by the fact that she had made a choice.</p><p>So it was fine.</p><p>\u201C\u2026Hmm?\u201D</p><p>It was a scene he was familiar with, but there was one irregularity within it.</p><p>The girl noticed her younger brother, and walked up to him while waving her hand. In her hand was a leash, and attached to it was a sluggish dog.</p><p>The dog wagged its tail and went to greet the boy\u2026 I see, the boy thought as he suddenly understood. The reason the girl had never given up magecraft lay there.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t let it be in vain. She didn\u2019t want to let it be in vain. She had to at least scoop up and make up for the life that had been used and discarded\u2014</p><p>That\u2019s why Fiore Forvedge Yggdmillennia had continued to live as a magus.</p><p>\u201C\u2026But that\u2019s also over now.\u201D</p><p>She gave a lonely smile and hesitated to let go of the leash. Picking up on her actions, the old dog began to leisurely chew the leash.</p><p>\u201CIt isn\u2019t over, Nee-chan. I\u2019m inheriting it.\u201D</p><p>In the blink of an eye, he took the leash from her. As the girl watched him in surprise, the boy spoke.</p><p>\u201CI\u2019m inheriting it, so I\u2019ll also inherent this guy too. He won\u2019t be forgotten. I was there back then too. I also saw and watched.\u201D</p><p>He had known. He had been resolved. He had known that his father would use the dog back then.</p><p>And while knowing that, he had watched and let it happen. He had tried not to feel anything for the dog as much as possible and did his best to ignore its existence.</p><p>But even if he ignored the dog, he couldn\u2019t ignore his sister. That day, he had watched the dog wagging its tail at his sister. As neither his sister nor the dog had any suspicions about what lay in the future\u2014all he\u2019d been able to do was shed tears at that scene.</p><p>So the boy had a responsibility to take charge of this leash.</p><p>\u201CYou\u2019ll take responsibility and keep hold of it?\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2026Yeah, I will.\u201D</p><p>The girl smiled and entrusted the rest to the boy. The old dog wagged its tail in a very slow-witted manner.</p><p>He would receive and inherit it.</p><p>He would inherit her magecraft, this discarded life and her pride. The divided Magic Crest might be too much for the boy\u2019s hands. But he would never fear or regret it.</p><p>That scene all those years ago. As long as he kept it carved in his mind\u2014he would discipline himself as a magus of the Forvedge family and Yggdmillennia.</p><p>The illusion ended, and Caules groaned at the sensation of something cold having been inserted in his brain.</p><p>\u201CAre you all right?\u201D</p><p>Ruler peered down at him anxiously. Caules calmed down his heated and cloudy thoughts and nodded at the question.</p><p>\u201CYe\u2014Yeah, I think I\u2019m fine.\u201D</p><p>His awareness of reality was gradually being restored. He moved his limbs, and felt the strong sensation of something foreign in his body. His movements were slow and dull as if his joints were clogged with mud.</p><p>\u201CAre you all right, Caules-dono? \u2026Let alone 70%, you received a full 80% of the Magic Crest from my Master. Your sister might feel more comfortable as the one who gave it away, but it must be painful for you as the one who received it.\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2026Not really. It isn\u2019t all that much.\u201D</p><p>Well, it was, but\u2014when he thought that his older sister had endured this kind of pain for such a long time, he felt he had to put up with it at any cost.</p><p>\u201CMagus-kun. Please use this.\u201D</p><p>After saying that, Ruler tightly wrapped a cloth around his chest. That alone immediately eased the pain. Moving was still troublesome, but he had recovered enough to get off the bed and walk.</p><p>\u201CIt\u2019s a holy shroud. I prepared it just in case, but it\u2019s better for you to use it now. It will also grant you resistance against impurities such as curses or poison, so I don\u2019t mind if you keep it on for a while.\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2026The pain has gone down a lot. Thank you, Ruler.\u201D</p><p>Ruler smiled slightly at those words.</p><p>\u201CYou did splendidly, Caules Forvedge Yggdmillennia. And you as well, Fiore.\u201D</p><p>As Archer helped her sit up, Fiore shook her head and smiled feebly.</p><p>\u201CNo, not at all. All the praise should go to Caules right now. He\u2019s my younger brother who I\u2019m very proud of, after all.\u201D</p><p>Caules turned red at those words and put his hand over mouth as his lips reflexively slackened into a smile.</p><hr><p>\u201CHmm, so that\u2019s why you left later than us.\u201D</p><p>Having changed into pajamas he had shrewdly bought before coming here, Rider of Black grinned at Ruler who was laying her head on a desk.</p><p>\u201C\u2026\u201D</p><p>Ruler remained silent. Looks like she still hasn\u2019t recovered from the shock, Sieg judged. Well, that was understandable. It was understandable, but\u2014</p><p>\u201C\u2026Couldn\u2019t you tell by looking at him normally when clothed?\u201D</p><p>Ruler jumped up at Sieg\u2019s question. Her eyes were slightly teary and she was red from her cheeks to her ears.</p><p>\u201CI couldn\u2019t tell!!\u201D</p><p>She was already embarrassed from seeing Rider naked, but her shame seemed to be worsened by the fact that she was the one who stepped into that situation herself.</p><p>\u201CBut can\u2019t you confirm the true names and stats of other Servants as Ruler?\u201D</p><p>While gripping her head, Ruler pointed at the helplessly laughing Rider.</p><p>\u201CSieg-kun\u2026 Try confirming Rider of Black\u2019s stats. As a Master, you should be able to grasp to a certain extent the abilities of the Servants you have met until now just by concentrating a little.\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2026Hmm.\u201D</p><p>Having been told that, Sieg tried confirming Rider\u2019s stats. A book appeared in his mind. He turned the pages, and the stats of the Servants he had met appeared vaguely one after another.</p><p>Saber, Archer, Lancer and finally Rider\u2026</p><p>\u201C\u2026What the heck is this?\u201D</p><p>Sieg turned to look at Rider sitting next to him\u2014and Rider waved his hand with a wide smile.</p><p>Rider\u2019s stats page was a mess. All of his skill names and ranks were properly recorded, but there were little jokes added everywhere.</p><p>In particular, his gender entry was completely painted over and impossible to read. Sieg frantically checked the stats of the other Servants, but fortunately there wasn\u2019t anything particularly strange about them.</p><p>\u201C\u2026It\u2019s true that there are Servants who possesses techniques or Noble Phantasms to hide their skills. But adding in little jokes is unheard of\u2026 Just how on earth is he doing this\u2026? No, leaving aside the means, normally people wouldn\u2019t do something that like\u2026 geez\u2026\u201D</p><p>That\u2019s true, Sieg thought in agreement. As they both looked at Rider, the Servant in question answered while smiling embarrassedly.</p><p>\u201CHmm, it\u2019s probably that. You know, the tome I have! The ability to check stats is technically a kind of spell, right? It\u2019s a spell that conforms with the fundamental rules of the Holy Grail War, so it can\u2019t be blocked completely, but the book might be able to interfere with it a little.\u201D</p><p>\u201CHow half-hearted and irresponsible\u2026 Really now\u2026\u201D</p><p>Ruler gripped her head. That\u2019s understandable, Sieg thought. Though he decided to leave it be, since it didn\u2019t do any great harm.</p><p>\u201CSo, are you still unable to remember the book\u2019s true name?\u201D</p><p>\u201CHmm\u2026 it\u2019s starting to trickle back into my head a little, I think.\u201D</p><p>What a careless answer. But Sieg didn\u2019t particularly think to scold him. Because he believed that his Servant, Rider, would always come through when push came to shove.</p><p>\u201CWill you remember in three days?\u201D</p><p>\u201CIt\u2019ll, probably, be fine, I\u2019d like to think\u2026 I think.\u201D</p><p>Rider averted his eyes to Ruler\u2019s question.</p><p>\u201CRider. The enemy will actively attack us as we approach the Hanging Gardens. Assassin will attack with her spells from the Hanging Gardens, Rider will fly through the air with his chariot and Archer will naturally shoot us with her arrows. Even if we fall at high speed, we Servants might not die, but\u2014\u201D</p><p>It didn\u2019t need saying, but Sieg would definitely die if he fell from that height.</p><p>\u201CI get it! It\u2019ll be fine, leave it to me!\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2026I feel uneasy.\u201D</p><p>\u201CRuler. You don\u2019t have to worry about Rider.\u201D</p><p>\u201CHaah\u2026\u201D</p><p>Though she seemed somewhat uneasy at Sieg\u2019s words, Ruler consented.</p><p>\u201CSo, are you okay, Sieg-kun?\u201D</p><p>Silence. Rider, who didn\u2019t know about the case with Assassin of Black, stared at his Master\u2019s face curiously. He tilted his head in puzzlement at Sieg\u2019s expression. His face was wracked by unbelievable distress.</p><p>\u201CMaster\u2026?\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2026There\u2019s no problem. I chose to fight.\u201D</p><p>Sieg somehow managed to reply. Yes, he wasn\u2019t fighting for someone else. He had chosen. He had willingly thrown himself into this battle he got dragged into.</p><p>He was fighting for himself. Not for humans.</p><p>\u201CI\u2019m going to take a bath, then go to sleep.\u201D</p><p>After saying that, Sieg got up from his chair. Rider and Ruler silently watched\u2014and once they confirmed he had entered the washroom, they looked at each other.</p><p>\u201CHe seems to be smoldering over something. Do you know anything, Rider?\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2026Yeah. Actually, at lunch, we ran into Saber of Red. But I didn\u2019t hear anything concrete about the hell my Master spoke of.\u201D</p><p>Ruler explained in detail about the illusion that Assassin of Black had shown them. The fixed system of a city where humans killed humans and stole everything there was to be had. A hell reproduced by humans where no one was evil and no one was good.</p><p>\u201CI see\u2026\u201D</p><p>Rider of Black looked down with a sad expression. Naturally, as a hero who had wandered the world, Rider knew that such things inevitably existed in the world\u2014and he accepted it.</p><p>That was the inevitably disillusioned viewpoint of a hero. Those who couldn\u2019t be saved just couldn\u2019t be saved, and the weak would bare their fangs as the weak. The malignancy of systems established by various circumstances such as social position and wealth couldn\u2019t be taken down no matter how great a hero one was.</p><p>\u201CBut he would have to learn about it eventually. Besides, it\u2019s not like Master wants to become human, right?\u201D</p><p>\u201CYes. Even so, don\u2019t you think he felt longing towards humans?\u201D</p><p>Rider crossed his arms and shook his head fervently.</p><p>\u201CI wonder about that\u2026 Master wished to live. And that wish was granted in a slightly strange and twisted form. Even so, I don\u2019t think\u2026 he feels longing towards humans. In the first place, has Master met any humans besides magi?\u201D</p><p>\u201CHe was treated to lunch by an old man named Serge. He was a very good person.\u201D</p><p>\u201CEnough that Master would feeling longing?\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2026We didn\u2019t meet him for that long. It might have made him aware that there are a good people out there, though.\u201D</p><p>There was no clue as to how he felt. Sieg himself probably still didn\u2019t know how he felt yet.</p><p>\u201CIt\u2019d be nice if he came to like them, though.\u201D</p><p>\u201CYou mean humans?\u201D</p><p>\u201CYes\u2026 Otherwise, it\u2019d be troubling for me.\u201D</p><p>Suddenly, she muttered in a tone filled with an unusual emotion. Picking up on it with his sharp ears, Rider leaned forward over the desk with plain curiosity and wariness.</p><p>\u201CMu, mu, mu\u2026 And why would that trouble you?\u201D</p><p>\u201CEh? Ah, no, err, sorry. It\u2019s nothing!\u201D</p><p>Ruler covered her mouth and quite obviously fell into a panic. Becoming even more suspicious, Rider brought his face close to her\u2014and Ruler hurriedly averted her eyes.</p><p>\u201CAre you hiding something?\u201D</p><p>\u201CI-I\u2019m not hiding anything. Really.\u201D</p><p>She wouldn\u2019t look him in the eye.</p><p>\u201CYou would you swear it by God?\u201D</p><p>\u201CI-It\u2019d be rude to swear on the Lord for such a trivial thing\u2026\u201D</p><p>Her earlier gallantness had disappeared, and Ruler blushed shyly like a normal girl her age. Conceding that touching upon this subject any further would be pitiful for her, Rider shrugged and changed the topic.</p><p>\u201C\u2026Well, I also agree that I want him to like humans, though. After all, Master has a future!\u201D</p><p>\u201CThat\u2019s\u2026 right. I think it\u2019d be nice if he had a happy future ahead of him.\u201D</p><p>Ruler spoke happily and smiled innocently. Rider also nodded cheerily.</p><p>Suddenly, Ruler, while making sure that Sieg still wasn\u2019t coming back yet, whispered to Rider.</p><p>\u201C\u2026U-Umm. Rider-san, do you like Sieg-san?\u201D</p><p>\u201CHow about you?\u201D</p><p>Having the question immediately turned back to her, Ruler widened her eyes and stiffened her back straight.</p><p>\u201CT-That\u2019s. Umm, err, that is, no\u2014\u201D</p><p>Rider sighed. He stood up and patted Ruler\u2019s head as if she were a child.</p><p>\u201CHyah!?\u201D</p><p>Rider smiled and whispered in her ear.</p><p>\u201C\u2014Well, do your best, though I won\u2019t be supporting you, Miss someone else who isn\u2019t Ruler.\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2026!\u201D</p><p>As the girl turned around, Rider waved his hand and went up to the bedroom on the second floor.</p><p>\u201C\u2026Uuugh. He noticed.\u201D</p><p>She sighed and pressed a hand to her cheek. Sieg then came out of the washroom with a bath towel covering his head and noticed Ruler looking red-faced and laying her head on the desk, so he called out to her.</p><p>\u201CRuler, did something happen?\u201D</p><p>\u201CAh, no, no, no! Nothing happened, nothing\u2014\u201D</p><p>She stiffened once again. While looking at her curiously, Sieg pointed at the washroom.</p><p>\u201CWe changed the order, but you can go in the bath next.\u201D</p><p>Ruler stiffened and stared at Sieg\u2019s body. A shirt was hanging off his right arm. He probably intended to sleep wearing it. In other words, right now, Sieg was completely naked above his waist.</p><p>\u201C\u2026Y-Yes! Under! Stood!\u201D</p><p>Moving jerkily just like a mechanical doll, she passed by Sieg to go to the washroom.</p><p>As he watched her go, Sieg found her behavior odd, but he just shrugged and decided to go up to the second floor bedroom. It\u2019d be nice if Rider doesn\u2019t barge in like last time, he thought. After all, Rider stayed in physical form and tossed and turned while he slept, which caused Sieg to be often kicked off the narrow bed.</p><hr><p>I pray in the morning, I pray at noon, I pray at night, I pray before eating and I pray before I go to sleep.</p><p>\u2014In other words, my way of life is simple. Every day is suffocating.</p><p>My friends at the school dormitory take things easy in their lives. I have no intention of condemning that, and I myself have thought that it might be better to take it easy sometimes. The reason I could never do that despite thinking that way\u2014is probably because I was afraid of agitating my heart.</p><p>Every day was like living at the bottom of the ocean. With neither great joy nor sorrow, I simply went through the days dispassionately.</p><p>The school I attend has nothing noteworthy about it. My friends idly grumble that it\u2019s like a prison. Still, it\u2019s not like it\u2019s completely cut off from the outside world, so it\u2019s easy to both fall into depravity and repent for it.</p><p>Amidst that environment, I was often told that I strictly disciplined myself.</p><p>I didn\u2019t have relationships outside or fall into depraved behavior, but neither did I try to change others out of excessive pride. My teachers and friends praised me, for some reason.</p><p>Everyone said that this way of life was beautiful, that this way of life was correct. I always accepted those praises with a vague smile, while feeling troubled inside my heart. It isn\u2019t anything that great.</p><p>I\u2019m simply afraid to change.</p><p>I understand my personality very well. My self-control is weak and my brakes are easily broken, so if I start running, I would just keep speeding up, unable to stop.</p><p>Even if there was a cliff ahead, I would just jump off it. I wouldn\u2019t stop until I fell and died.</p><p>That\u2019s why I didn\u2019t concern myself with the outside world, but also didn\u2019t feel any great joy in that prison. Furthermore, I couldn\u2019t sever my connection to the outside completely as long as I had my parents.</p><p>It makes me want to deride myself for how half-baked I am.</p><p>I didn\u2019t intend to become someone extremely commonplace, someone who was connected with others and dyed by the earthly world.</p><p>And I didn\u2019t have the courage to devote myself to a world cut off from the outside and where taboos are strictly controlled.</p><p>Frankly, I didn\u2019t know where I should aim to go. I couldn\u2019t find the path I should take. I just walked uncertainly and helplessly down the path I could vaguely manage to see.</p><p>Screw it, if it\u2019s like this, who cares anymore? I half-despaired as I walked.</p><p>I didn\u2019t know what lay ahead, so I had no other choice. Even if I fell and degenerated, even if I my body became a captive, even if I regretted it\u2026 I had no other choice, or so I told myself.</p><p>At that time\u2014I saw a dream, and I saw a path.</p><p>The holy maiden Jeanne d\u2019Arc asked for my help. I understood everything from the knowledge that had been inserted into me, and accepted it. Naturally, I was afraid. A mortal battle between heroes over the Holy Grail wasn\u2019t something someone commonplace like me should involve myself in.</p><p>But I agreed. I also politely refused the holy maiden\u2019s advice to simply sleep, and I continued to watch everything through her eyes.</p><p>Grand battles that surpassed my imagination, gruesome scenes that filled me with such disgust I wanted to throw up, all of it.</p><p>I probably felt mentally protected by the thought I was in a place of safety. I watched events that no one else would ever see in their whole lifetime.</p><p>I saw heroes who dashed across the battlefield, heroes who could smash giant stone statues with mystical tools, magi who used mysterious magecraft, divine-looking giants and even a massive fortress floating in the sky.</p><p>But what captivated my eyes the most was\u2014was\u2026</p><p>How is such a pure and beautiful being alive and breathing? That person was so beautiful it made me think that.</p><p>The boy who was a homunculus, an artificially-created life form.</p><p>I understood from the knowledge the holy maiden had given me. Most of them were short-lived, loyal servants who were created in human form and obeyed the will of humans.</p><p>But he had defied death and overcome despair, obtaining irreplaceable freedom. Even the moment where I thought Thank goodness and sighed in relief was only brief, as he sought to return to the battlefield.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t understand. After all, that meant throwing away the freedom he had obtained.</p><p>If it were me, I would definitely hold onto what I had obtained\u2014I would never let it go. He had risked his life to get it.</p><p>But he said this.</p><p>My comrades want to be saved. I can\u2019t just leave and abandon them.</p><p>Even I could understand. This person probably can\u2019t do anything. Certainly, he might regret leaving them. He might feel guilty over abandoning them.</p><p>But he would surely forget it eventually. He should live happily\u2014this person had to live happily. The world was huge and filled with tons of beautiful things, after all.</p><p>If he could do something, then it would be understandable. But he knew better than anyone else that he \u2018couldn\u2019t do anything\u2019. He knew full well that it was a foolish, reckless and futile choice that wouldn\u2019t amount to anything.</p><p>But this person had chosen to go back.</p><p>To me, as someone who lived half-heartedly, his way of life was overwhelmingly dazzling.</p><p>A jewel that was polished not to boast of its beauty nor make others look at it, but simply for the sake of doing so. A person who would never change his way of life no matter how he was scorned as foolish for not taking pride in his beauty.</p><p>Even though he\u2019s close enough for me to touch if I just reach out my hand.</p><p>To me, he\u2019s the person who was the furthest away.</p><p>Soaking in the warm bath water made her weariness disappear as if it was melting away. The girl known as Laeticia heaved a huge sigh. She felt like it had been a while since she had soaked in the bath like this.</p><p>\u201C\u2014Umm. I\u2019m sorry.\u201D</p><p>The girl who had come to the surface apologized to the holy maiden within her.</p><p>\u201CI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any need for you to apologize, though.\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2026No, umm\u2026 I don\u2019t really understand it myself either\u2026 these feelings of mine.\u201D</p><p>These feelings are so strange, she thought with a sigh.</p><p>Shame and joy were mixed together. And a large spoonful of sorrow was mixed into it as well.</p><p>\u201CIsn\u2019t that\u2014because he hasn\u2019t noticed you?</p><p>That was naturally part of it. But there was something else subtly mixed into it. Something slightly bitter, sweet and painful.</p><p>\u201CLaeticia. You know there\u2019s nothing stopping you from letting him know when you come out, right?\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2026No. I\u2019ll refrain from doing that.\u201D</p><p>She moved her hand through the bath water. She felt sad over not revealing her name to him, and she also felt sad that he wasn\u2019t looking at her. But this subtle emotion surely came from something else.</p><p>\u2014Ah, how sinful I am.</p><p>\u201CI\u2019m already fine with this\u2026 My feelings are vague and ambiguous, after all.\u201D</p><p>\u201CBut\u2014\u201D</p><p>\u201CThank you, o great holy maiden. It made me happy.\u201D</p><p>She closed her eyes\u2014and then reopened them. The girl known as Jeanne confirmed that Laeticia had gone to sleep inside her.</p><p>\u201CSo that\u2019s enough for you\u2026 huh?\u201D</p><p>They had two days remaining due to Fiore\u2019s choice. As long as there was no emergency situation, Ruler had thought it would be fine to lend her body back to Laeticia.</p><p>Laeticia had done that much for her. She had loaned Jeanne this body. Even when they got involved in bloody battles, she continued to accompany Jeanne. Even if she was technically safe, merely continuing to watch battles from inside Jeanne should have mentally exhausted her.</p><p>Jeanne couldn\u2019t thank her enough. After all, this state where she was close to being human had from the start been far more astounding than she had expected.</p><p>She felt hunger and felt joy in eating. She felt weariness and wished for sleep. The overwhelming euphoria just from having basic, human instincts. She was once more experiencing the magnificence of being alive.</p><p>If it weren\u2019t for Laeticia, she wouldn\u2019t have been able to feel this\u2026 Though naturally, she wouldn\u2019t have suffered from hunger, either.</p><p>That\u2019s right. That\u2019s why Jeanne felt an everlasting debt of gratitude to her. And most of all, she felt it was only natural that she was charmed by the boy beside her, even if they had only known each other for a few days. So why not change places and give her the chance to form and bond with him even a little\u2014that\u2019s what she had thought, but\u2026</p><p>\u201CHow\u2026 unfortunate.\u201D</p><p>Perhaps because of the steam, her vision was hazy and the world was so vague and unclear. Yes, it was unfortunate. Sieg still hadn\u2019t noticed Laeticia. Jeanne felt it was unfortunate and sad, but also just a little\u2014</p><p>\u201C\u2026No, I\u2026\u201D</p><p>Ever so slightly, completely different feelings were mixed in. They were feelings that were superfluous and absolutely unneeded, which she should discard right away.</p><p>But she couldn\u2019t throw these feelings away no matter how hard she tried. Even though they were so tiny and should have been unnecessary.</p><p>\u201CI don\u2019t understand\u2026 anything.\u201D</p><p>Whiling hoping her feelings would dissolve into steam and disappear\u2014Ruler looked up at the ceiling and heaved a huge sigh.</p><h2 id="chapter-3" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#chapter-3" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Chapter 3</h2><hr><p>\u2026For the next two days after that, everything was peaceful. Staying inside the hideout would let them avoid unnecessary trouble, so Sieg wanted to spend time there idly\u2014and ponder a vague thought he still couldn\u2019t quite put into words.</p><p>But his Servant wouldn\u2019t allow that.</p><p>\u201CCome on, let\u2019s go out and play!\u201D</p><p>\u201CWait, what are you saying\u2014!?\u201D</p><p>And the holy maiden\u2019s attempt at restraint was meaningless in the face of Rider. Rider of Black pulled them both along with him to his heart\u2019s content.</p><p>They marched through the town and ate, went around the many famous tourist sites, and talked and laughed without minding the suspicious gazes of those they passed. Whenever they occasionally encountered trouble, Rider and Ruler dealt with it. Irritated people would smile wryly when the flawlessly cute Rider talked to them, and those who with ill intentions would run away hanging their heads after hearing Ruler\u2019s reprimanding tone and words.</p><p>Sieg felt as if he was walking with a typhoon and an angel. It felt extremely safe, but also extremely tiring.</p><p>But he was only tired. And that weariness itself was extremely comforting.</p><p>\u201C\u2014Are you having fun?\u201D</p><p>Rider asked him that, taking Sieg by surprise. For some reason, Ruler also stared intently at Sieg as if waiting for his answer.</p><p>Sieg replied.</p><p>\u201COf course I\u2019m having fun.\u201D</p><p>It was true that he felt a slight amount of smoldering impatience inside. He was anxious about the future, and dark clouds hanged over their destination. Naturally, he hadn\u2019t forgotten about any of that. He hadn\u2019t, but\u2014</p><p>The sunlight was dazzling, the sky was clear and blue, and the people passing by were overflowing with energy and liveliness, for good or ill.</p><p>Just walking through such a place made his heart pound with excitement.</p><p>Sieg smiled, and Rider and Ruler nodded in satisfaction.</p><p>He didn\u2019t know the reason for their reaction. Even when he asked why, the other two merely traded looks and giggled\u2026 It\u2019s surely something good, Sieg thought.</p><p>\u2014When it became nighttime, Sieg thought.</p><p>He wracked his brain over difficult questions over things he didn\u2019t have an answer for, like human goodness, human evil and human instinct. He read books and sought the guidance of the other two people with him, but even with that, he still wracked his brains over the answers he couldn\u2019t find.</p><p>And he also thought about Amakusa Shirou Tokisada.</p><p>\u201C\u2026Why is he trying to save humanity?\u201D</p><p>Sieg suddenly murmured that while reading a book on a sofa in the living room.</p><p>\u201CHmm? Isn\u2019t that because humans are sinful beings to him?\u201D</p><p>Rider answered as if it were extremely obvious.</p><p>It was a simple answer, but Sieg also thought it was correct. Humans were sinful beings by nature, and that was precisely the reason Shirou was trying to save humanity. Though Sieg didn\u2019t know how he intended to use the Greater Grail to bring it about\u2014in any case, Shirou was filled with the sense of duty that he must save the sinful humanity.</p><p>\u201CThen does Amakusa Shirou hate humans?\u201D</p><p>\u201CI don\u2019t think so, though?\u201D</p><p>While lying down on another sofa, Rider pointed at the book on Amakusa Shirou that Sieg had been absorbed in reading. It was a book he had brought from the Fortress of Millennia, thinking it might be useful somehow. Though Sieg had been bestowed knowledge about the other Servants, he wouldn\u2019t be able to understand what kind of person the enemy\u2019s leader was unless he tried to learn about him.</p><p>\u2026If it was just a matter of fighting, there might not be a problem with not knowing. If he changed into the great hero Siegfried, he could probably defeat Amakusa Shirou Tokisada, who, in the end, was merely a saint from the Far East, in one blow.</p><p>But Sieg somehow felt that was wrong. Regardless of which side defeated the other, Sieg wanted to at least know about his opponent. Even if he could understand or agree with them, he should be aware of their existence and objectively know about their life.</p><p>Pulling the trigger to kill the enemy without knowing anything about them or their goal\u2014Sieg felt that that alone was something he shouldn\u2019t do.</p><p>Therefore, thought it was only vague details, he had learned about Amakusa Shirou Tokisada. And the more he learned, the less he understood.</p><p>If he was summoned as a normal Servant, then Sieg could understand. Even when he was summoned as Ruler, there probably hadn\u2019t been any problems when it had been in the Far East.</p><p>According to the research of the Yggdmillennia magi, the Third Holy Grail War had apparently been extremely gruesome.</p><p>The armies of supposedly allied countries each moved secretly amidst the war along with the many participating magi\u2014and by the time anyone realized it, it had developed into a massacre that no one could control.</p><p>In his first life, Amakusa Shirou Tokisada had witnessed the massacre of thirty-seven thousand people, and in his second life, he saw the hideous conflict between magi and armies.</p><p>\u201CShouldn\u2019t it be impossible for him to like humans after that\u2014?\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2026I don\u2019t think so.\u201D</p><p>Ruler suddenly spoke up from her own sofa where she sat. Rider and Sieg looked at her. Ruler murmured as if she were speaking to herself instead of them.</p><p>\u201CIf you live as a hero or a saint, you will naturally see both the ugly and beautiful sides of humans. Human evil, human goodness, or perhaps something that transcends either of them. No matter how much of the ugliness he saw, he wants to believe in the beautiful things. It\u2019s precisely because he wants to continue liking humans that he wants to save them\u2014that might be how he thinks.\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2026I see.\u201D</p><p>That\u2019s a reasonable conclusion, Sieg thought. But Rider objected while wriggling his feet on the sofa.</p><p>\u201CBut would he reach the conclusion of \u2018saving humanity\u2019 in that case? Hmm\u2026 like, wouldn\u2019t he wish something like erasing bad humans and leaving only good humans?\u201D</p><p>\u201CThat isn\u2019t salvation, but selection. No saint or hero has the right to choose who should and shouldn\u2019t be saved.\u201D</p><p>Sieg titled his head curiously at Ruler\u2019s words.</p><p>\u201CBut you yourself fought in the past, didn\u2019t you? In order to protect your homeland and defeat the enemy. Isn\u2019t that selecting the people who should be saved?\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2026Yes, that\u2019s true. I don\u2019t think that was mistaken. But even if it wasn\u2019t mistaken, my actions were a \u2018sin\u2019. I didn\u2019t think of myself as a saint; I\u2019m merely a commonplace woman who heard God\u2019s laments.\u201D</p><p>Therefore, that wasn\u2019t selection, but a choice. She had decided to save these people and destroy those people. That was the nature of how humans saved other humans.</p><p>One must never classify those who should be saved and those who shouldn\u2019t from high above.</p><p>\u201CShirou Kotomine\u2014Amakusa Shirou Tokisada should also understand that. He obtained the Greater Grail not for the sake of saving only those who should be saved, but to save all humans. However, that is a mistake. That\u2019s precisely why I\u2019m here.\u201D</p><p>\u201CA mistake\u2026 huh? Then, if it wasn\u2019t a mistake, you would also choose that salvation of his?\u201D</p><p>Ruler stiffened at Sieg\u2019s question. The coffee cup in her hand trembled slightly.</p><p>\u201C\u2026Ruler?\u201D</p><p>Hearing Sieg\u2019s curious voice, Ruler frantically shook her head.</p><p>\u201CN-No. It\u2019s nothing\u2026 Yes, I think I would consider it if that salvation was perfect. But there is no such thing.\u201D</p><p>\u201CRight? It\u2019s impossible! If there were such a thing, some much wiser guys in the past would have already done it! Living beings can\u2019t live just being saved by others!\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2026Then does that apply to me who was saved by you?\u201D</p><p>Rider glared at Sieg after he spoke.</p><p>\u201CGeez! That\u2019s not it! You weren\u2019t saved. You simply saved yourself! I just helped a little! To reverse the question, would you have thought of escaping by yourself if you had known that you would eventually be saved?\u201D</p><p>Sieg became at a loss for words.</p><p>\u2026If he had known he would be saved for a fact, would he really have fought so desperately?</p><p>If he had known that someone would save him if he just waited\u2014</p><p>\u201C\u2014That\u2019s right. It\u2019s certainly true that you were saved by Rider of Black, Sieg-kun. But when you consider the process until he did so, you were the one who saved yourself first. You shouldn\u2019t disregard that.\u201D</p><p>Sieg felt an emotion that was really hard to describe after hearing Ruler\u2019s words. It wasn\u2019t an unpleasant feeling, but some odd emotion that mixed happiness and shame and tickled his heart somehow. Though he understood it was \u2018embarrassment\u2019, Sieg still took a little while to respond.</p><p>\u201C\u2026Is that so?\u201D</p><p>\u201CIt is, it is.\u201D</p><p>While saying that, Rider picked up some Yakigashi.</p><p>\u201COh, strawberry. What luck!\u201D</p><p>\u201CMuu. Rider, haven\u2019t you been eating nothing but the strawberry-flavored ones since earlier?\u201D</p><p>Ruler glared at him. The sweets that she had bought along with coffee so they could enjoy it together were drastically decreasing in the strawberry-flavored ones due to Rider\u2019s very specific eating preferences.</p><p>\u201CI\u2019m just randomly grabbing from the pile\u2026 Oh, another strawberry.\u201D</p><p>\u201CA-Aren\u2019t they all gone now!? Rider, you! Gluttony is a grave sin!\u201D</p><p>\u201CI-It\u2019s fine! The chocolate ones are also tasty! I\u2019m going to bed, good night!\u201D</p><p>Perhaps sensing his disadvantage here, Rider suddenly went into spiritual form and ran away.</p><p>\u201CGeez\u2026\u201D</p><p>While watching all this, Sieg grabbed one of the chocolate-flavored sweets. Putting his dulled sense of taste to work, he managed to taste the chocolate.</p><p>\u201CI think it\u2019s plenty tasty.\u201D</p><p>\u201CYes\u2026\u201D</p><p>He threw one of the sweets to her as she acted downhearted. When she ate it, Ruler\u2019s cheeks loosened into a happy smile.</p><p>\u201CAh, it\u2019s like I\u2019m falling into decadence\u2026\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2026I think you\u2019ve already plenty falling into decadence when it comes to eating, though. No, sorry. That was a slip of the tongue.\u201D</p><p>When Sieg reflexively pointed that out, Ruler pouted.</p><p>\u201CThis is a unique form of summoning for me, so it can\u2019t be helped. Besides, my calorie consumption is quite fierce, so she doesn\u2019t have to worry about getting fat either.\u201D</p><p>\u201CShe? \u2026Ah, you mean Laeticia.\u201D</p><p>Ruler\u2014Jeanne d\u2019Arc\u2014had been summoned using the girl known as Laeticia as a core.</p><p>\u201CYes. She\u2019s a very good girl.\u201D</p><p>The instant the topic turned to Laeticia, Ruler\u2019s expression relaxed.</p><p>\u201CI would think so. Even if she isn\u2019t fighting, she has the necessary character to follow you into this situation.\u201D</p><p>\u201CYes. Though she seems to have become interested in something else\u2014\u201D</p><p>Ruler smiled in amusement. Something else\u2026 Certainly, amidst the unbelievable fantasies of the Great Holy Grail War, magecraft and most of all Servants, an ordinary person could easily become interested in any of them.</p><p>\u201CAh, I know. You\u2019re surely misunderstanding, Sieg-kun.\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2026Did you read my mind?\u201D</p><p>Sieg tilted his head in confusion, making Ruler smile all the more.</p><p>\u201CYes. After all, what she\u2019s become charmed by is\u2014!?\u201D</p><p>Before she could say any more, Ruler covered her mouth with her own hands.</p><p>\u201CWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201D</p><p>\u201CN-No. It\u2019s nothing. More importantly, Sieg-kun, would you like to talk with Laeticia? We\u2019re not in a pressing situation right now, after all.\u201D</p><p>Sieg tilted his head curiously at Ruler\u2019s question. Even if she asked if he would like to talk, it would actually be his first time meeting her.</p><p>\u201CI felt like she kept her distance when I first met you, but is it all right to talk with her?\u201D</p><p>He didn\u2019t mind being hated, but he wouldn\u2019t force someone who hated him to talk\u2014so Sieg tried to be considerate of Laeticia.</p><p>\u201CIt\u2019s fine!\u201D</p><p>\u2014Ruler suddenly stood up and shouted loudly. Sieg stared at her in puzzlement, and Ruler covered her mouth with a shocked expression.</p><p>Silence. After a while, Ruler sat back down on the sofa.</p><p>\u201C\u2026Could it be that you\u2019re Laeticia?\u201D</p><p>When Sieg asked that, she tried to feebly shake her head\u2014but then nodded.</p><p>Her expression was somehow helpless, unable to calm down. The way she anxiously clenched her hands was certainly like that of an ordinary girl that could be found anywhere.</p><p>\u201CUmm, yes. That\u2019s right, I\u2019m\u2026 Laeticia.\u201D</p><p>\u201CNice to meet you, sort of, I guess.\u201D</p><p>Laeticia smiled and nodded at Sieg\u2019s words. Her smile seemed a bit sad to Sieg.</p><p>\u201CYes, nice to meet you, Sieg-san. I\u2019m truly glad to have gotten the chance to properly meet you. I\u2019ve only watched you up until now, after all.\u201D</p><p>\u201CI see. Umm\u2026 are you all right with me? Sorry, that was vague. Err\u2026\u201D</p><p>Laeticia giggled and nodded at Sieg\u2019s ambiguous question.</p><p>\u201CNo, it\u2019s not a problem. It\u2019s just that, how to put it\u2026 I was nervous before. It\u2019s fine now. I\u2019ve been watching Sieg-san for a while.\u201D</p><p>She displayed a soft smile that was slightly different from that of Ruler\u2014even though their facial features were exactly the same, the atmosphere they gave off was clearly different from each other.</p><p>\u201CThen that\u2019s good\u2026 But you\u2019ve really gotten dragged into something serious.\u201D</p><p>Someone who lived a normal life had suddenly been possessed by a saint one day. Moreover, she got involved in a war over the Holy Grail and witnessed cruelty that one normally wouldn\u2019t be able to endure seeing.</p><p>Even if she could simply put her mind to sleep inside, there were probably times when she saw things she didn\u2019t want to see.</p><p>\u201CThe holy maiden Jeanne-sama treats me very preciously. Besides, truth be told, my heart is dancing with excitement a little as well.\u201D</p><p>\u201CYou heart is\u2026 dancing?\u201D</p><p>Sieg tilted his head curiously, and Laeticia nodded.</p><p>\u201CUmm, I realize it\u2019s imprudent of me\u2014but, I was someone who didn\u2019t know about magecraft or anything really until now. If Jeanne-sama hadn\u2019t descended upon me, I probably would have lived my entire life without knowing any of it.\u201D</p><p>She clasped her hands together as if in prayer and continued to speak.</p><p>\u201CBut I was able to learn through this experience. I\u2019ve met heroes who are only told of in myths and legends face to face. Whether they be enemies or allies, it\u2019s all been a precious experience for someone ordinary like me. And I also, umm, got to meet\u2026 you too, Sieg-san.\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2026It\u2019s true that homunculi are a rare sight.\u201D</p><p>After some thought, Sieg nodded in understanding\u2014and Laeticia\u2019s became downcast at those words.</p><p>\u201CIt\u2019s not because you\u2019re a homunculus. It\u2019s because you\u2019re Sieg-san.\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2026Hmm.\u201D</p><p>Sieg tilted his head. His reaction, which could only be described as naivety itself, showed how he just didn\u2019t understand.</p><p>Laeticia thought.</p><p>This person dispassionately assessed his \u2018personal\u2019 value to a frightening degree. He was a Master, the Servant Saber of Black, and a homunculus that could use magecraft. And he probably thought he was nothing else besides those things.</p><p>He treated his kindness towards others, his bravery which didn\u2019t lose to that of heroes and everything else about him\u2014as non-existent. He thought it was natural for anyone to have those qualities.</p><p>Laeticia found that unbearably sad.</p><p>\u201C\u2026Umm, Ruler\u2026 No, Laeticia.\u201D</p><p>Laeticia raised her face. Sieg stared at Laeticia with a serious gaze. He straightened his back and looked straight at her.</p><p>\u201CDid I say something rude to you?\u201D</p><p>\u201CHuh? Umm, why do you think that\u2014?\u201D</p><p>\u201CNo, it\u2019s just that you were looking at me sadly. Ruler would probably correct me or get angry if I did something rude. But right now you\u2019re Laeticia. I thought you might get sad instead in such a case, but is that wrong?\u201D</p><p>So it\u2019s like that, Laeticia thought. She became saddened again, but immediately understood.</p><p>In the end, this was something that had to be conveyed with words. Because Sieg couldn\u2019t see that which anyone could naturally understand or boast of in the depths of their hearts.</p><p>This might be her best chance.</p><p>Be brave, she reprimanded herself.</p><p>If she didn\u2019t say it here, she might never get to say it\u2014Laeticia hated the thought of that.</p><p>\u201CNo, that\u2019s not it. I\u2026 That\u2019s right, I simply don\u2019t want you to make light of yourself, Sieg-san. Umm, I\u2019ll only say it once, okay?\u201D</p><p>\u201CSure.\u201D</p><p>Laeticia sucked in a deep breath, leaned forward and spoke to Sieg.</p><p>\u201CSieg-san, even without being a Master, Servant or magus, you are a truly wonderful person just for being yourself.\u201D</p><p>Those words left Sieg with a dumbfounded expression for a little while. Laeticia nodded in satisfaction and then quietly closed her eyes\u2014</p><p>\u201C\u2014I also think so, Sieg-kun. And I pray that you\u2019ll eventually think of yourself that way as well.\u201D</p><p>Ruler lightly patted his hand. Completely dumbfounded, Sieg nodded vaguely. Ruler hoped that Laeticia\u2019s words would act as some kind of impetus and help him understand little by little.</p><p>\u201CI\u2014\u201D</p><p>Sieg couldn\u2019t continue his sentence.</p><p>He questioned the world, he questioned humans and he questioned good and evil. But he still hadn\u2019t questioned himself. If he continued questioning the world while remaining empty inside\u2014he would probably one day conclude that he was a worthless being.</p><p>The value of his life wasn\u2019t something to be decided by others; he had to decide it for himself. And when he acknowledged his own value, it would help form the path Sieg would walk.</p><p>Ruler wanted to believe that. She wanted to protect him. Even if they wouldn\u2019t walk alongside each other, if she could at least help him find his path\u2014</p><p>\u201C\u2026\u201D</p><p>She was hit by a headache similar to vertigo. You have no right to speak of dreams, a voice growled inside her mind.</p><p>You brought him here\u2014you led this homunculus to the battlefield as if it were completely natural. By the Lord\u2019s will.</p><p>\u201CRuler, what\u2019s wrong?\u201D</p><p>Sieg asked her worriedly, and Ruler frantically shook her head.</p><p>\u201CIt\u2019s nothing,\u201D she answered, and Sieg then fell into deep thought once again. Watching that, Ruler thought once more.</p><p>\u2014I certainly brought him here.</p><p>She didn\u2019t know what would happen next. But she had a responsibility. Ruler bore responsibility for not having made him run away.</p><p>As such, she would continue to protect him\u2026 even if she had to wager her own life to do so.</p><p>As she swore that within her heart, Ruler felt relieved. She could wager her life for him. She felt relieved at that part of herself.</p><p>There was one thing that she didn\u2019t notice\u2026 These feelings that seemed to burn her body from the inside out consisted of not just guilt.</p><p>Laeticia found that sad. Even if she pointed it out to her with words, the holy maiden probably wouldn\u2019t acknowledge it. And by the time she did acknowledge it, it likely would be far too late.</p><p>Thus, the final night would end with everyone passing their time peacefully.</p><p>\u2014The night wore on.</p><p>Archer of Black clenched a fist and raised it towards the starry sky above.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t thinking of his coming opponent as his former student. The enemy was a great and matchless hero, the strongest warrior Achilles, who ran across the battlefield over the course of the Trojan War\u2014</p><p>His heart cheered. And at the same time, he resolved himself. There was no proof he could win even if he fought Achilles in perfect form. When he considered it coolly, Archer was at a 7:3 disadvantage. Achilles\u2019 spear was certainly swift. Even if Archer completely grasped his abilities and habits in battle, the possibility that he couldn\u2019t process the data fast enough in real time was extremely likely.</p><p>Moreover, that was based on the assumption of first annulling the disadvantage of his foothold and his opponent not using his chariot.</p><p>To bring about such a convenient development, considerable luck and planning was necessary.</p><p>But that was precisely why Archer engraved the fact that he had to win in his heart. Because victory was the final lesson he could teach to his Master.</p><p>How strange, he thought with a smile. He would never have thought he would pass the final night feeling so calm. Only one pair could win in a normal Holy Grail War.</p><p>In such a situation where it would be natural for him to die amidst regret, he was lucky to have fortuitously met so many comrades\u2014unbelievably so.</p><p>We\u2019ll definitely win.</p><p>With his heart full of overflowing feelings, Archer of Black reflected upon that simple conclusion.</p><p>\u2014The night wore on.</p><p>Rider of Black slept. He slept regardless of the fact that he was a Servant. He fell asleep despite not needing to. And he saw a dream.</p><p>Naturally, it was a dream of his Master.</p><p>\u2026However, Sieg\u2019s life was so short and condensed it was only a fleeting twinkle. The first person he met soon after being born was none other than Rider of Black himself.</p><p>And so, Rider met himself as he watched Sieg\u2019s past.</p><p>He felt Sieg\u2019s feelings and thoughts as he watched. He experienced just how happy Sieg had felt when Rider appeared\u2014and said he would save him.</p><p>Ah, I\u2019ll protect you, I\u2019ll protect you, I\u2019ll protect you, I want you to become happy!</p><p>Rider\u2019s heart danced. Rider had forgotten that they would part soon\u2026 or rather, he blocked it off from his thoughts. He understood. It would surely be painful and sad.</p><p>If Rider could physically incarnate, he would be able to stay by Sieg\u2019s side, but that was quite difficult. Whether or not they managed to get back the Greater Grail, there was no telling whether it would be able to grant a wish at that point.</p><p>But, he could vaguely tell\u2014it was already too late for that. His instincts were quite reliable at times like these.</p><p>So, for now, let\u2019s only think of fun things. I\u2019ll do my best as a Servant. Rider thus swore.</p><p>His chest was hot and his head swirled with formless thoughts, and that was why he could understand as he became unbearably excited.</p><p>He would fight with his life on the line for his Master. He couldn\u2019t help but feel happy about that.</p><p>As he surrendered himself to sleep, Rider of Black\u2019s lips slackened into a slight smile.</p><p>\u2014The night wore on.</p><p>It was late at night. Unable to sleep, Caules absentmindedly gazed at the courtyard outside from his window. His human eyes could only faintly make out the contour of things in the darkness at best. But he managed to make out the silhouette of the rubble that hadn\u2019t yet been cleaned up outside.</p><p>Caules had often watched his Servant from here. She had usually followed him everywhere from behind, but the only independent action she took was flower picking in the courtyard.</p><p>Though it was only a few days ago, it felt nostalgic to him, and he hated himself for feeling that way.</p><p>At the same time, he was surprised at how clearly he recalled that scene. Within their scarce conversations, Caules had only once asked Berserker of Black a certain question.</p><p><img src="https://i.lensdump.com/i/1sfc72.jpg" alt=""></p><p>\u201CI thought you would have hated flowers?\u201D</p><p>She had tilted her head, as if not comprehending what he had said. Caules had smiled bitterly\u2014perhaps that was only natural. The episode about her throwing flowers into a lake was only a fictional production from a movie.</p><p>When he apologized and told her to forget about it, Berserker had nodded and began engrossing herself in flower fortune-telling once more. Holding the peeled petals in her hands, she then stood up and threw them up towards the sky.</p><p>The flower petals had danced downwards on a gentle breeze.</p><p>It only lasted an instant\u2014but that scene was vividly engraved in his mind. She had seemed unbearably ephemeral as she stood there amidst the falling petals.</p><p>He should have talked with her a bit more. Anything would have been fine, about the things they each liked, the things they each hated; he should have talked with her about anything without reserve. Even if she couldn\u2019t exchange words, she should have been able to convey something in her own way.</p><p>But she was no longer here. Caules had let her die in an manner that was the same as if he had killed her with his own hands.</p><p>The piece of rubble that was stabbed into the ground of the flowerbed couldn\u2019t help but look like some kind of gravestone to him. And then his thoughts began to turn into an even worse direction.</p><p>\u201CIdiot, stop it.\u201D</p><p>He knocked his head. He didn\u2019t have the time to be soaking in sentimentality. Everything would end tomorrow night. He didn\u2019t even know whether he would be alive then.</p><p>But\u2014he still had a responsibility as a Master. Even if his Command Spells were gone and his Servant had vanished, Caules had participated in the Great Holy Grail War by his own will and fought by his own will.</p><p>So he would ascertain the outcome right to the very end, as far as he could go. Those were the shackles Caules had placed on himself.</p><p>\u201C\u2026Let\u2019s sleep.\u201D</p><p>Caules decided to try sleeping even if he had to force himself. Naturally, he had stimulant-type herbs and spells at hand, but those were only for use in emergencies or when his research was making progress. If he managed to fall asleep, then that was fine. Still, he\u2019d had the Magic Crest transplanted into him not long ago. His body was hot and in pain, so he wouldn\u2019t be able to sleep well anyway.</p><p>Additionally, there were also spells and herbs for preventing nightmares. Should I use one?\u2014Caules wavered over it a little, but decided not to in the end.</p><p>He accepted the nightmares about the past and the near future without running away. He knew it was terribly self-righteous of him, but he believed he should face at least this much.</p><p>Caules fell asleep, while praying that he and, most of all, his sister would manage to get through tomorrow safely.</p><p>\u2014The night wore on.</p><p>Unlike her brother, Fiore decided not to sleep. Part of it was that she had trouble falling asleep, but she was also scared of seeing dreams. Her resolve was like soft pudding\u2014it would collapse with the slightest shake.</p><p>Unlike usual, Archer was still in materialized form at this hour.</p><p>\u201CThere\u2019s something I want to think about while maintaining this physical body for a while.\u201D</p><p>It wasn\u2019t that large of a burden on her, so Fiore had gladly allowed it. Most likely, he was thinking on a castle lookout not far from here right now.</p><p>Fiore thought about Archer. Even though tomorrow would be their final farewell, she felt strangely calm.</p><p>Only, she felt an indescribable sense of transience, feeling that something precious was gradually getting further away. Was it because she would give up magecraft after tomorrow, because of her coming parting with Archer, or was it perhaps both? She thought about it absentmindedly.</p><p>Before she had transplanted the Magic Crest, she had thought it would be fine this way.</p><p>Immediately after the transplant, she felt regret and worry over the fact that she might have done something terrible.</p><p>And now, her feelings wavered little by little like a pendulum.</p><p>She had thought about discussing it with Archer. About how she might be regretting her choice. But she stopped herself from doing so. This wasn\u2019t something she should speak of in this situation. Most of all, her Servant seemed like he would give advice without changing expression at all right now.</p><p>\u2014She would do her best on her own.</p><p>It was quite disheartening, but also something precious. A person\u2019s life was a path chosen even amidst a repetition of regrets. Those regrets would also probably melt away little by little every day.</p><p>But even so, she would continuously make new regrets one after another. She would forget them, cover them up, and live while always glossing them over\u2014Ah, how human of her that was.</p><p>There were only three things in her life that she had decided to never regret.</p><p>The first was how she had loved that dog. Its irritated expression when she washed it in the shower and cleaned off the dirt. Its softened expression when it dried in the hot wind. The way it wagged its tail when she patted its head\u2014its final days were precious memories to her no matter how tragic it was.</p><p>The second was her summoning and meeting Chiron as Archer of Black. It was one of the few events she could proudly call a success in all regards in her life.</p><p>The third was having learned magecraft\u2026 She had enjoyed it. It wasn\u2019t depressing or completely pointless. The joy she felt when she successfully used spells burned in her chest even now.</p><p>She would be able to live proudly with just the memory of that alone.</p><p>Even if she lamented what she lost, she still felt pride over having once had something more precious to her than anything else.</p><p>\u201CAh, but I might die tomorrow.\u201D</p><p>She murmured that aloud to herself, and then giggled. Naturally, she would feel regret if she died\u2014but she felt like she would be able to take pride in it even if she only managed to make a single step forward.</p><p>Without sleeping, Fiore quietly waited for tomorrow.</p><hr><p>\u2014The night wore on.</p><p>Saber of Red and Shishigou Kairi had left Bucharest and were heading by car to Mihail Kog\u0103lniceanu Air Force base, which lay about three hundred kilometers away from the city.</p><p>The items Shishigou had requested through the Association of Magi were there. They would no longer return to Bucharest, as their plan was to head to the battlefield next\u2014in other words, to the Hanging Gardens.</p><p>The driver Shishigou and Saber of Red in the passenger seat rode the car without exchanging any words. As some melancholy country music flowed out from the car radio, neither of them felt any awkwardness at the silence between them. Saber thought that in itself was strange.</p><p>When she\u2019d been alive, she\u2019d never experienced such a silence with anyone else. In most cases, people ran from her, she stood up to take action, or she and the other party hated each other to the point that they were on the verge of killing each other.</p><p>There was no one who had let their guard down with her, and there was no one she had let her guard down with. She had thought that was what life, what a knight and what the being known as Mordred was.</p><p>\u201C\u2026Hey.\u201D</p><p>\u201CHmm, what?\u201D</p><p><img src="https://i1.lensdump.com/i/1sfXFv.jpg" alt=""></p><p>She didn\u2019t even find his curt way of talking all that irritating. There were very few cars on the road right now, and even the few sounds on the road merely emphasized the calm and silence.</p><p>\u201C\u2026Hey, I said, what is it?\u201D</p><p>Shishigou voice was dubious\u2014speaking of which, she had merely called out to him without any question in mind. Perhaps she had merely thought, Now then, what should I ask?</p><p>\u201CAh\u2026 I forgot what it was.\u201D</p><p>After turning silent again for a little while, Shishigou tilted his head in confusion and muttered.</p><p>\u201C\u2026That happens a lot to humans, but does the same apply to Servants?\u201D</p><p>\u201CIt does, doesn\u2019t it? After all, we\u2019re so real that this is called our second life. Thought we don\u2019t need to eat or sleep.\u201D</p><p>\u201CAnd yet you eat quite a lot\u2014\u201D</p><p>\u201CShut up. That\u2019s not because I\u2019m hungry, but because I\u2019m curious about the taste.\u201D</p><p>\u201CAs expected of someone born on the island known for having the worst cooking.\u201D</p><p>\u201CStop it with the insults I can\u2019t refute, Master.\u201D</p><p>She continued talking with him about this worthless topic even while thinking it was worthless. It was fun, so fun that it made her think it would be even more fun if they had alcohol too.</p><p>Why hadn\u2019t she been able to talk like with anyone during her life\u2014? It was obvious; it was because her father hadn\u2019t. As the one who would succeed her father, she couldn\u2019t do anything that her father didn\u2019t.</p><p>But the things that her father hadn\u2019t done were so fun.</p><p>Did her father never converse with others because it was fun? Or because her father didn\u2019t find it fun? Or did her father merely think it was unnecessary?</p><p>It might be all of those reasons. Her father always looked too far ahead. Her father had freely devoted all efforts to build a peaceful country.</p><p>Naturally, her father\u2019s knights had always devoted their efforts to that cause. But they were too short-sighted. Though it was necessary to first make a foundation in order to build a castle, they didn\u2019t understand that and merely asked for the castle.</p><p>Or perhaps it was the opposite. They were unable to understand what their efforts in the present would bring in the future.</p><p>To dry up a village within their territory was a callous and cruel act\u2026 They didn\u2019t move a single step from that viewpoint. They didn\u2019t see the victory that lay beyond it. That was only natural; the possibility that they would lose if they didn\u2019t dry up their own territory was merely a hypothetical future.</p><p>Naturally, the king had explained to them. They had heard the king\u2019s words that the village was being sacrificed for the sake of victory. But\u2014</p><p>\u2014Maybe, maybe they could have won even without drying up their villages?</p><p>When they thought like that, distrust towards the king always took root in them\u2026 After all, it had been none other than the Knight of Rebellion herself who had said that to instigate them.</p><p>The king was isolated, the king was alone\u2014that was a natural, unmistakable fact.</p><p>But\u2026 maybe it would have been better to talk to each other.</p><p>If they had been frank with each other and deepened their mutual understanding, maybe a different path would have appeared\u2014</p><p>\u201CWhat\u2019s with you, suddenly turning silent?\u201D</p><p>\u201CShut up. A future king like me has a lot of worries that ordinary people can\u2019t understand.\u201D</p><p>\u201CYeah, yeah, the imperial court magus will be quiet now.\u201D</p><p>When Shishigou said that, Saber of Red suddenly imagined it\u2014Shishigou wearing a robe that just emphasized his suspicious appearance and bending his back like an old man.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t help bursting out with laughter.</p><p>\u201CIt doesn\u2019t suit you at all! It\u2019s no good, Master! You should start by rectifying that fact of yours first.\u201D</p><p>\u201CHey, don\u2019t say things about other people\u2019s faces. Despite how it seems, I\u2019m sensitive about this frightening appearance of mine!\u201D</p><p>Saber of Red was a little surprised by those words\u2014and then she realized again. It was a trivial detail, but she had once again learned something new about the person known as Shishigou Kairi.</p><p>Just by spending a few days together, she had learned a ton of facts about someone else. How much would she have learned about others if she talked with them during her life?</p><p>If she had talked with the king\u2014would she have been able to understand the king?</p><p>Even though it was already in the far past, she couldn\u2019t help but regretfully think that way.</p><p>\u201C\u2026Are we there yet?\u201D</p><p>\u201CJust a little longer. I know you\u2019re bored, but\u2014\u201D</p><p>\u201CNo, I\u2019m not bored. More importantly, talk to me more, Master. Talk about something trivial and worthless.\u201D</p><p>Shishigou smiled bitterly at her pestering tone.</p><p>In truth, they still had a long way to go. He was worried that she would be bored, but if she was satisfied just by talking, then that was perfect.</p><p>\u201CCan\u2019t be helped. Then let me tell you the story of a man I met on a certain battlefield\u2014\u201D</p><p>The Master Shishigou spoke of a trivial tale, and the Servant Saber laughed as she listened to that trivial tale, and then recounted her own few absurd stories from when she was a knight.</p><p>This might be the last time I laugh, Saber thought.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t scared of dying, and she would feel no despair even if her wish wasn\u2019t granted. She would merely say \u201CThat\u2019s how it is\u201D with a light sigh and shrug.</p><p>Even if the two of them were blessed with luck in every aspect, made a perfect battle strategy, thoroughly displayed their abilities and got the Holy Grail, their parting would still eventually come.</p><p>\u201C\u2026Hey, Master. Is parting sad?\u201D</p><p>As a slight urge of weakness sprouted in her, she involuntarily asked that question. She already expected his answer. \u2018Parting isn\u2019t sad. If people have memories, they can live on.\u2019</p><p>Shishigou, of course, betrayed her expectations when he replied.</p><p>\u201COf course it\u2019s sad. All the more so if it\u2019s an eternal separation. Listen, Saber. To part with someone means you can\u2019t talk with them. Being unable to talk with them means you\u2019ll eternally lose the chance to understand each another. No matter how strongly you\u2019re connected to them\u2014as they fade away into the flow of time, the things you remember about them will also disappear.\u201D</p><p>\u201CThen meeting other is pointless?\u201D</p><p>\u201CCompletely pointless. If we were perfect beings, we wouldn\u2019t need to meet anyone else in the first place. The reason we meet and talk with others is in order to try and fill something we lack within ourselves. But sadly, we\u2019re far from perfect. That\u2019s why we have to fill up our feelings of loneliness by encountering others. In other words\u2014encountering others is a luxury. If you think of it that way, you can endure meeting even the most unpleasant of people.\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2026What contrary logic.\u201D</p><p>Saber\u2019s amazed voice made Shishigou heartily laugh. Indeed, what he said wasn\u2019t mistaken. It was a trivial conversation without any potential for anymore more, an act that wasted time in a completely pointless manner.</p><p>It was such a luxury, such precious time spent\u2014</p><p>All the more so for a Servant. Normally, a Servant would only fight, fight and fight until everything was over, after all.</p><p>\u201CSo well, let\u2019s enjoy this luxury while we have the chance. Now then, back to my story\u2014\u201D</p><p>Shishigou continued talking\u2014and she listened to that trivial story while closing her eyes.</p><p>\u2014The night wore on.</p><p>Like Rider of Black and Caster of Red, Archer of Red didn\u2019t like going into spiritual form very much. She preferred perceiving the feel and smell of the earth.</p><p>There was practically none of the smell of iron which she hated in the Hanging Gardens, but she couldn\u2019t sniff the smell of trees or earth either. And most of all, she couldn\u2019t hear the laughter of children here.</p><p>Since the dawn of history, the ones who were most exploited in this world were children. Many children simply cried and died without ever being able to smile and laugh.</p><p>Each time she thought that, Archer was struck by despair strong enough to tear out her heart. The world should have been simple. A world where all children laughed only required adults to give a little concern and help.</p><p>And yet they trampled over, abused and never gave love to the young ones born into this world, who they should have been considered half of themselves.</p><p>Having once been one of those children, Archer could understand quite well. How cruel and painful it was. And also\u2014how joyous it felt to have her pleading hand grasped by someone else.</p><p>\u201C\u2014That\u2019s right. That\u2019s why I won\u2019t deny you all. I\u2019ll accept you. I\u2019ll love you. I\u2019ll truly love you all.\u201D</p><p>Looking at her discolored right arm, Archer smiled. The vengeful spirits continued to whisper.</p><p>Kill, kill, kill, kill everyone, kill every last one of them.</p><p>\u2026It was abnormal. Low-class vengeful spirits could only repeat the desires from when they were alive. If they wanted to \u2018return\u2019, they would continue to earnestly seek to return. Even if a hundred or a thousand years passed, as long as they existed as spirits, that wouldn\u2019t change.</p><p>But the vengeful spirits possessing Archer\u2019s right arm had changed their wish. Was it born from Archer of Red\u2019s own desire, or was it because the vengeful spirits actually understood Archer\u2019s love and hatred? Even Archer herself didn\u2019t know.</p><p>She was certain of only one thing.</p><p>Her wish was absolutely correct, and the fates of the children in the world hanged in the balance. She couldn\u2019t afford to lose. Even if\u2014she became a beast that froze the hearts of those who saw her.</p><p>That\u2019s right, she had that power. Not her power as a hero, but the power of a Monstrous Beast of punishment sent by the gods\u2014but if it was for the sake of these children, she would happily become a beast.</p><p>So just wait a little longer. It\u2019s all right, I\u2019ll gladly become the cornerstone for you all.</p><p>She whispered while holding her right arm closely.</p><p>Her right arm replied to Archer\u2019s words with a faint \u201CThank you\u201D. At the very least, she [heard] it.</p><p>As long as she had this voice, she could fight. She could kill. She could trample over all obstacles and destroy all evil.</p><p>Even if she was exterminated as a monster, she would let herself fall into destruction while smiling\u2014</p><p>\u2014The night wore on.</p><p>Rider of Red took the \u2018poisonous serpent\u2019 stance with his spear. It was an effective style where he held the middle part of the handle and could use quick thrusts while warding off the enemies attacks. He aimed at the stomach of his enemy, Chiron, with that stance.</p><p>However, the attack was avoided quite naturally by the enemy screwing his body with a side step.</p><p>The enemy saw through Rider\u2019s movements. The moment he took this stance, the enemy understood where he would aim.</p><p>\u2014How should he respond as he pitched forward in readiness? After remaining vigilant for a counter and dodging to the left or right, the enemy used a punch or kick. There was an 80% chance the enemy would do a roundhouse kick and attack at the same time as he twisted his torso; that was the most logical course of action. That\u2019s why, now that he was pitching forward, the enemy would be forced to aim at his head. How should he defend himself? He could draw back his spear and thrust it again\u2026 but it wouldn\u2019t make it in time. He could lower his head and dodge\u2026 but that would cause his stance to collapse even further.</p><p>Cut and retry.</p><p>He resolutely set up his first move by jumping and then thrusting\u2014Retry.</p><p>He tried to thrust after tripping his enemy up\u2014Retry.</p><p>He swiped his spear horizontally, turned around as the attack was blocked and swiped his spear again. He aimed at the knees and thrusted downwards\u2014No good. Retry.</p><p>\u201CDamn it, nothing works.\u201D</p><p>Rider of Red closed his eyes with a sigh. His palms were soaked with sweat. The back of his neck was cold, and his entire body hurt as if he\u2019d actually been punched and kicked everywhere.</p><p>Rider was imagining a hypothetical one-on-one battle against Archer of Black in a situation where they were on a flat field without any obstacles.</p><p>In the end\u2026 he had gone over five battles, and made mistakes and lost each time. As long as he fought with the spear that Archer had taught him how to use, all his combos were seen through. Additionally, Archer\u2019s power of observation was practically on the level of future sight. If Rider tried to use a surprise attack, Archer would read it and deal him a counterattack.</p><p>Naturally, the situation wasn\u2019t as bad as it seemed. The way Rider lunged with his spear was truly divine speed incarnate. Even if his attacks were seen through, they couldn\u2019t all be avoided. In the hypothetical battle just now, he had fought in a situation where his speed was not taken into account.</p><p>But he couldn\u2019t say for sure that it wouldn\u2019t actually go that way. Archer of Black\u2019s skills knew no depth. He was perfectly balanced in all aspects; that was precisely why all heroes sought to be trained by him. Moreover, Servants were summoned in the form of their prime. Though his appearance was human, his stats were of that when the being known as Chiron was at his most perfect.</p><p>If he ignored all their feelings and bonds in the coming battle and simply considered and compared their respective power, Archer of Black was the enemy wanted to fight the least. Therefore, Rider always imagined the worst situation as he fought\u2014and continued to lose each time.</p><p>\u201C\u2026I feel like I keep making a mistake right from the first move.\u201D</p><p>Since his opponent had greater battle power than him, making a mistake right from the start was fatal. Since they both knew almost all of each other\u2019s moves, he could tell the fight would end in this manner by logically thinking it through.</p><p>Since both of them moved completely logically, the first one to make a mistake would lose.</p><p>However, there was a strong possibility that such a situation wouldn\u2019t occur. The only thing that the Black camp had which could deal with his chariot was the other Rider\u2019s Hippogriff. His opponent couldn\u2019t fly no matter how he struggled.</p><p>These conditions wouldn\u2019t be overturned unless something significant was done.</p><p>But on the other hand, the enemy should also be desperate to overturn this situation. The Black camp might use a plan that he himself couldn\u2019t think of.</p><p>In that case, his opponent would definitely aim for him. He knew that since he would definitely do the same if he were in the same position.</p><p>That was because he possessed a body that couldn\u2019t be harmed except by those with divine blood\u2014and \u201Che\u201D was the only Servant on the other side who had divine blood.</p><p>\u2026No, such reasons didn\u2019t matter.</p><p>Rider knew. His quivering muscles, creaking bones and boiling cells whispered to him.</p><p>\u2014The one to fight that man will be you.</p><p>\u2014You are the only one who has the right to fight him.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t that he wanted to kill his opponent. He didn\u2019t hate him either. This was a pure contest of strength; he wouldn\u2019t hate his opponent even if he lost, and he wouldn\u2019t bear a grudge even if he was killed.</p><p>He just wanted to fight him, to swing his clenched fists, to kick and to pierce him with his spear.</p><p>How strong was he compared to the teacher he had once loved and respected? He wanted to show him. In life, he had been extolled as a hero by everyone. But his teacher had never seen his exploits after their final parting.</p><p>He was proud.</p><p>Just like other heroes such as Heracles and Jason, he was incredibly proud of having been taught by Chiron. And yet, his teacher had always merely smiled calmly. He felt no pride in granting wisdom and strength to young heroes like Achilles. Neither did he feel jealous of them for being praised as heroes.</p><p>\u201COf course. Even without me, they would have naturally become heroes on their own eventually. I merely gave them a little push from behind. But you know, Achilles. That act\u2026 that act of giving them a little push is something I take great pride in\u2014\u201D</p><p>Chiron had once said that to Achilles when he was young. This might be a thought that suddenly came to Achilles at that time. Or perhaps it was something he always thought about while he was being taught\u2014</p><p>Achilles thought to himself that Chiron, who continued to teach and guide others, had never once fought seriously.</p><p>And at the same time, he also thought that he wanted to drag out his great teacher\u2019s\u2014full power.</p><p>The Great Holy Grail War truly was a miracle unto itself.</p><p>Depending on the situation, they both might not be able to display their power to perfection.</p><p>But that moment would come. It would definitely come. Rider intended to devote this final remaining day to training.</p><p>The night wore on, and the sun would soon rise again. But Rider continued to glare through the darkness without closing his eyes.</p><p>Error, retry, miss, retry.</p><p>Rider of Red continued to repeat hundreds of battles in order to take down Archer of Black\u2014</p><p>\u2014The night wore on.</p><p>In a small spring within the confines of the Hanging Gardens which ruled the sky, Lancer of Red bathed himself out of habit. Naturally, Servants had no need to clean themselves, but his habits from when he was alive wouldn\u2019t go away.</p><p>Karna silently washed his body while gazing at the mysterious phenomenon of the water flowing upstream.</p><p>In contrast to his magnificent armor and dazzling spear, Karna preferred the simple life.</p><p>In the first place, he himself had never wished for his armor or spear. His armor was given to him due to his mother\u2019s supplication to the gods, and he received his spear in exchange for giving up his armor.</p><p>The reason he had lived after being abandoned by his mother was due to the power humbly bestowed upon him by his father and the armor he had received thanks to his mother.</p><p>He always lived without ever sullying his father\u2019s name.</p><p>That guiding principle of his hadn\u2019t changed even now in his second life. So naturally, he had to obey his Master as a Servant. Lancer of Red refused to commit any act that would sully his father\u2019s name.</p><p>However, his Master had already been restrained even before Lancer had been summoned, a problem that went beyond merely the matter of how he acted.</p><p>His Master continued to view a dream with empty eyes. He couldn\u2019t communicate with him, and there was no chance of mutual understanding. The only thing Lancer understood from his ramblings was that his Master mistakenly thought that he had obtained the Holy Grail.</p><p>Knowing that was enough for Lancer. He would obtain the Holy Grail and grant his Master\u2019s wish\u2026 Of course, he knew full well how difficult that would be to accomplish.</p><p>He probably wouldn\u2019t manage to get it. The Holy Grail was right before his eyes, but this wasn\u2019t a situation where he would take it away that easily, and most of all\u2014Lancer of Red\u2019s Master had been changed to Amakusa Shirou Tokisada, the one who currently possessed the Grail.</p><p>He had no intention of betraying his former Master, but he couldn\u2019t go against Shirou. He was completely cornered in every direction.</p><p>However, such a situation was par for the course for Karna, the Hero of Charity. He held no grudge against his former Master or his current Master Shirou.</p><p>He merely did what he could within the range of actions that were available to him.</p><p>He merely give the things that were asked from him as long as it was possible.</p><p>And he always accepted everything solemnly no matter the result.</p><p>\u2014No, perhaps not quite everything.</p><p>Lancer of Red recalled the one thing he had continued to obsess over.</p><p>There was person, one hero in this world that had continued to stir up Karna\u2019s heart.</p><p>His name was Arjuna. \u2018Kiritin: The Shining Diadem\u2019, \u2018Vijaya: The Victor\u2019, \u2018Dhananjaya: The Prosperous One\u2019\u2014he was a man who had various names and was loved by all.</p><p>If Karna was a man who had everything taken from him in exchange for his spear and armor, Arjuna was a man who had received everything with no compensation in return.</p><p>Was the emotion Karna held within him envy? Or was it something else entirely?</p><p>Karna had never known the answer to that right until the very end. After all, as someone who had never envied anything or anyone, he had been unable to concretely put a name to the feelings that stirred his heart.</p><p>\u2026Soon after this Great Holy Grail War began, he had received another chance to find out.</p><p>Saber of Black\u2014Lancer could tell that that man held traces of Arjuna somewhere in him. When he heard of his true name from Shirou Kotomine afterwards, Lancer had understood the reason for that.</p><p>The tragic hero from a royal bloodline who had obtained wealth, prestige and everything else\u2014Siegfried.</p><p>But unlike Arjuna, his end was terribly tragic.</p><p>An untimely death due to a sneak attack. Without even the time to swing his dragon-slaying sword, the invincible Siegfried had his only weak point attacked and lost his life.</p><p>Karna thought of all the various Heroic Spirits participating in the Great Holy Grail War as unique and rare beings.</p><p>He thought of his allies as comrades to work with and his enemies as rare warriors of valor. In that sense, Karna \u2018comprehended\u2019 the other Heroic Spirits more deeply than anyone else.</p><p>But the only one he held a personal interest in was Saber of Black. Though they had exchanged few words, Lancer had glimpsed into the man after exchanging hundreds and thousands of blows with their respective weapons.</p><p>A man who was very similar to Arjuna, but at the same time hungered for something.</p><p>A man who held no regrets over his untimely end, but instead sought something new.</p><p>And\u2014a just hero, so evident that anyone could tell. He had wished to fight Lancer of Red once more and saw him as an enemy that must be defeated. That was the greatest honor and joy for a warrior like Lancer.</p><p>That battle, and that promise. Had there ever been anything else that made him boil so much with excitement before? He felt gratitude for the actions and warm conversations of humans. But that was far removed from \u2018selfishness\u2019. He had never possessed a desire and joy that made him seethe.</p><p>But he found it on the battlefield. Now that he thought back, Karna had only encountered joy on the battlefield. His entire existence was focused on the tip of his spear. It was the only instant where he was released from the thoughts of the people he allied with and could freely run forth as his \u2018bared self\u2019.</p><p>The sparks of clashing weapons were twinkling stars to Karna. A worthy enemy who could easily push back his bared self and told him to give it his all. Thought it was arrogant of him, it was enough to make him think that his entire life had been for the sake of tasting the joy of that moment. That\u2019s why, when Saber of Black disappeared, when the prospects of another fight vanished in the empty sky, Lancer had felt unspeakable regret.</p><p>Saber of Black had disappeared.</p><p>But\u2014he still hadn\u2019t died. Lancer didn\u2019t know the reason behind it, but Saber was still in this world even now.</p><p>In that case\u2026 their promise was also still valid.</p><p>Naturally, Lancer understood that \u2018he\u2019 was a being far removed from Saber of Black. Lancer understood that \u2018he\u2019 was a being who had been born with everything taken away from him, even more so than Lancer, and yet still struggled to live.</p><p>But a promise was a promise. It couldn\u2019t be changed. Back then, Karna and Siegfried had wagered each other\u2019s lives, battled with deadly technique and put off the conclusion for later.</p><p>\u2014They had sworn on their names to definitely fight and unleash their utmost power against each other. It was a trust founded on their very lives. To break it would be equal to insulting that man\u2019s life.</p><p>He had surely entrusted something to the one who had now become Saber of Black. Lancer believed that ascertaining that was would tie to the promise they\u2019d made.</p><p>Thus, Lancer of Red lived, in order to protect his Master to the end of the war and fulfill his promise with Saber of Black.</p><hr><p>\u2014It didn\u2019t feel like nighttime at all to me.</p><p>The calm air became filled with a heavy heat, burning my skin.</p><p>\u2014Here again?</p><p>I touched the coarse rock surface with my hand. Just how many times had I encountered the evil dragon Fafnir already? No matter how many times I swung my sword, my blade never pierced its skin. I had to constantly avoid its attacks by a hair-breadth; failing even once would mean instant death.</p><p>There was no showy heroic tale in that battle.</p><p>It was a hellish comedy where I had to swing my sword just in order to survive, no matter how unsightly and ridiculous it looked.</p><p>I know that I can\u2019t beat it. I had no experience or spark in me; inside, I was merely a soft homunculus who had taken on the outer shell of a hero.</p><p>But right now, I was the dragon-slayer Siegfried. I had to challenge this despairing battle once again.</p><p>The dragon opened its jaws and released a bluish-white light.</p><p>Flames burst out. I determined that it was impossible to dodge. I released the power of Balmung and blocked the attack by pushing forward\u2014!</p><p>The dragon\u2019s breath was a surging blast of extreme heat, extreme impact and extreme pressure. A normal human would die in an instant from either being burnt to ash or having their lungs torn out of their very mouths from the wind pressure.</p><p>\u2026Even so, I managed to survive it.</p><p>I tried to suck in a breath and ended up coughing violently.</p><p>I seemed to have survived thanks to the sturdiness of my shell and the sword blast from Balmung. The great pain and suffocation I felt could be endured as long as I had this shell.</p><p>But\u2014</p><p>My arms couldn\u2019t move. Even though my entire body was as hot as if I had been bathed in boiling oil, the heat of my body was frozen in fear. I couldn\u2019t win; even with a hero\u2019s body, it was impossible for \u2018Sieg\u2019 to beat it.</p><p>What should I do?</p><p>There\u2019s no way I could know. Fighting, escaping and negotiating were all impossible against this enemy. I had no option besides giving up.</p><p>\u2014As if I could give up.</p><p>Even after scolding myself like that, I couldn\u2019t think of anything. Perhaps sensing that, the dragon sidled forward as if to bestow fear onto me.</p><p>And then, it suddenly opened its jaws and attacked. I reflexively counterattacked with my sword.</p><p>Perhaps the inside of its mouth would be softer than its skin\u2026</p><p>That faint hope was easily smashed.</p><p>\u201CWh\u2026 at\u2026?\u201D</p><p>If my hopes had merely been smashed, then I still could have dealt with it. But what the dragon aimed for wasn\u2019t myself, but the great sword which had blocked its breath earlier\u2014Balmung.</p><p>The dragon\u2019s teeth, whose hardness far surpassed any steel, clamped down on the sword and bite off the blade.</p><p>The legendary sword which had been bestowed to Siegfried by the Nibelung. The dual holy and cursed sword which released a blast of twilight\u2014</p><p>If it was held not by a hero, but by a homunculus\u2026 then it could also break easily like this.</p><p>I\u2026 really wasn\u2019t Siegfried after all. That hero had managed to come out with a plan to break through even a situation like this.</p><p>And yet, the only thing I could do was resolve myself worthlessly. I was going to die. I don\u2019t know what will happen in reality, but the me here would be torn about by the dragon\u2019s teeth.</p><p>Losing this battle is inevitable; I was merely unlucky.</p><p>I wanted to explain it away with such swords. I was merely unlucky\u2014for being here, in this situation and at this moment.</p><p>That\u2019s only natural. Just what do you think you are?</p><p>A homunculus, an artificial lifeform created through magecraft, and a mass-produced one at that. I merely survived by relying on fortunate chance and clinging to the kindness of others.</p><p>\u2014My soul is pure and untouched, and therefore I can become anything.</p><p>My self-torturing thoughts halted at that sudden revelation. But, before I could understand what exactly it was, the dragon clamped down on me with its mouth.</p><p>Its fangs bite into me. I writhed in pain so great I couldn\u2019t even scream. I let go of the handle of my sword and feebly hit the dragon with both hands.</p><p>I was being devoured while alive. The experience was more painful and terrifying than I had ever imagined. As I struggled, my gaze happened to meet the eyes of the dragon\u2014and it seemed to be laughing smugly at me.</p><p>Ah, this dragon has surely devoured thousands of humans. It had probably tasted their fear and despair.</p><p>Even though it was of the dragon race, the very top of the Phantasmal Species, it was unbelievably avaricious. It continued to gather up possessions and devour humans who presented themselves as sacrifices.</p><p>No matter how many times it was hit, the hands of humans couldn\u2019t even be felt by it, let alone hurt it.</p><p>Its fangs crushed and pierced my armor and body. This armor\u2019s hardness wasn\u2019t ordinary, but it was like paper before the fangs of a dragon.</p><p>I want fangs, I thought.</p><p>I want fangs to fight. I want fangs to win. I want fangs so as not to lose.</p><p>I want this dragon\u2019s fangs.</p><p>Before me was the dragon\u2019s upper jaw. I opened my mouth and bite into it like a starved wolf.</p><p>A howl rang out\u2014the dragon was shocked, unable to believe it.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t believe it either.</p><p>I realized.</p><p>And then I laughed.</p><p>Thus, my path was settled.</p><p>I threw away all other options, not knowing if I\u2019d ever had them in the first place, and cut open a path.</p><p>The [Dead Count Shapeshifter: Dragon Revelation Command Spells] on my left arm, which governed destruction. There was no longer any need to count down to my death. The result would be the same no matter how many Command Spells I use. Since I decided to participate in this war, the countdown would definitely reach zero.</p><p>But I was already resolved to everything.</p><p>I bit into the upper jaw and bared my fangs at the dragon.</p><p>\u2014\u2014And then, Sieg opened his eyes. His consciousness was clear and free of pain.</p><p>He looked out the window from his bed. It was still dark outside, but the sky was becoming slightly bluish.</p><p>Dawn wasn\u2019t far away. Determining he couldn\u2019t sleep any further, Sieg decided to get up.</p><hr><p>\u2014The night came to an end as dawn broke.</p><p>Ruler gazed at the gradually changing sky through the window without getting tired of it. She had already finished her morning prayer. If she were to consider Laeticia\u2019s physical health, it might be better to go back to sleep\u2014but even so, she didn\u2019t feel like sleeping at all.</p><p>Her heart felt uneasy for two reasons. The first reason had to do with Amakusa Shirou Tokisada\u2026 and his plan to save humanity.</p><p>Certainly, at a glance, it looked as if she had been summoned as Ruler in order to prevent his plan. But currently the Greater Grail was in the possession of the enemy, and at this rate she wouldn\u2019t be able to prevent his plan.</p><p>At this point, wasn\u2019t it as if she had unconsciously acted to the benefit of her enemy?</p><p>\u2026No good, she was starting to think about the threads of destiny. The threads of destiny were complex, twisted and intertwined all over the place. Thinking about it would only lead to doubt and uncertainty.</p><p>The plan to save humanity that Amakusa Shirou had declared he would accomplish was merely the mutterings of a madman. His plan would definitely bring about destruction\u2014that was why she had been summoned. It was precisely because she thought that way that she clearly opposed him, and averted her eyes from the countless doubts that ran through her mind.</p><p>What if his wish truly is correct?</p><p>Could she really say that the answer that a hero like him had reached over the course of sixty years was truly mistaken?</p><p>A way to save humanity without hurting anyone and without spilling a drop of blood certainly does not exist\u2014Did she really think that?</p><p>All humans should have dreamt of achieving it at some point during their lives.</p><p>Why did she say that Amakusa Shirou Tokisada couldn\u2019t do it?</p><p>If his wish was correct.</p><p>If his words were true.</p><p>What should Jeanne d\u2019Arc choose?</p><p>And there was also the other reason for her worries. In a sense, it might be the more serious problem.</p><p>She had always continued to think about it, the role \u2018he\u2019 was meant to fulfill in this Great Holy Grail War\u2014</p><p>\u201CCan\u2019t sleep?\u201D</p><p>The moment she heard those words, Ruler stifled the unease in her heart and turned around. Sieg stood there wearing plain pajamas.</p><p>\u201CYeah. The night is almost over. Most likely, today will be the last. We will head towards the Hanging Gardens and fight. In order to stop Amakusa Shirou Tokisada.\u201D</p><p>\u201CYeah, we have to stop him.\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2026Is it okay if I ask you one last thing?\u201D</p><p>Ruler spoke in a somewhat stiff voice. When Sieg nodded, she asked hesitatingly.</p><p>\u201CSieg-kun, are you really sure you should be on this side?\u201D</p><p>It was a question she had asked him several times before. Being on this side, being part of this war, participating in a battle of kill or be killed\u2014How conscientious of her, thought Sieg as he replied in the affirmative.</p><p>\u201CYes, of course.\u201D</p><p>There was no hesitation in his voice. But Ruler continued questioning him.</p><p>\u201C\u2026Rider once told you that \u2018You can do anything now\u2019, right? That\u2019s exactly right. Your current self can go anywhere and do anything. Your greatest worry, your fellow homunculi are embarking on a new life. Yet why must you still fight? You don\u2019t have to fight; it\u2019s fine if you don\u2019t fight, Sieg-kun.\u201D</p><p>Sieg felt a strong pressure as if his heart were being gripped.</p><p>You don\u2019t have to fight, there\u2019s no need\u2014</p><p>Those soft words and kind voice were things he had wished for somewhere in his heart. But he shook his head as if to shake off the warm temptation.</p><p>\u201CI\u2026 have a duty as both a Master and a Servant.\u201D</p><p>He had become a Master and could even become a Servant. There was surely meaning in that\u2014</p><p>\u201CSieg-kun, merely acting according to a higher purpose isn\u2019t everything there is to life.\u201D</p><p>Ruler said that in a somewhat self-punitive tone. Sieg felt like those words were extremely heavy and important.</p><p>\u201CRuler\u2026\u201D</p><p>\u201CIt\u2019s true that you obtained power. That power is necessary, and that might be precisely why you\u2019re here. But even if you\u2019re here by your own will, it isn\u2019t your fate to be here. That\u2019s why\u2014that\u2019s why it\u2019s fine for you to run away, Sieg-kun.\u201D</p><p>Ruler trembled, as if enduring some violent emotion.</p><p>Being guided here by destiny, being here because it was necessary\u2014there was something wrong about that way of thinking.</p><p>When Sieg started to ponder on it, Ruler placed a hand on his cheek. She looked at him with a sad smile.</p><p>\u201C\u2026Sorry. I seem to have confused you. Please be at ease. You\u2019ll surely be fine, Sieg-kun.\u201D</p><p>You\u2019ll be fine\u2014Ruler whispered that and looked out the window once more. Faint light was starting to pour it through the window.</p><p>The dawn of the end had finally arrived.</p><p>The night ended for everyone, and the sky gradually became tinged with the light of dawn.</p><p>The result of the war over the Holy Grail wouldn\u2019t determine whether or not the world was destroyed.</p><p>But the world would be pressed to choose between undergoing a transformation or not.</p><p>Amakusa Shirou Tokisada would save humanity \u2018righteously\u2019.</p><p>Jeanne d\u2019Arc would deny that \u2018righteously\u2019.</p><p>They each had their own justice and things they wouldn\u2019t turn over. There was no evil in this battle; there was only justice and faith.</p><p>However, most wars might be like that. Every human who has a great cause to fight for and dreams of a world that blesses them and their comrades with happiness chooses to fight.</p><p>In the end, this Great Holy Grail War was the same.</p><p>You didn\u2019t win because you were just and correct. The victors were just and correct because they won.</p><p>Both Rulers understood that. Therefore they wouldn\u2019t censure each other, but merely fight to kill one another.</p><p>If there was a way for this war to end without any further blood being spilled, it would only be by one side understanding and accepting that the stance of the other side was correct.</p><p>And that situation was impossible nine times out of ten. Too much blood had been spilled for either side to understand each other.</p><p>Even so, one camp held a na\xEFve hope. That perhaps they could understand each other by talking\u2014</p><h2 id="chapter-4" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#chapter-4" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Chapter 4</h2><hr><p>\u2014Thus, the day of the final battle arrived with gentle rays of sunlight.</p><p>Right after dawn, Fiore, Caules and Archer of Black boarded a limousine along with a homunculus driver.</p><p>\u201CThen, Gordes-oji-sama, please take care of things here while we\u2019re gone.\u201D</p><p>The one to see them off was the only remaining magus at the Fortress of Millennia, Gordes Musik Yggdmillennia. He was in charge of looking after the castle in their absence and conducting negotiations with various organizations in order to find a way for Yggdmillennia to survive after this war. It could only be described as the miserable job of dealing with the aftermath of defeat, but oddly enough, Gordes was most skilled in those kinds of negotiations.</p><p>\u201CYeah\u2026 Well, err, you know. Come back alive, all right?\u201D</p><p>Gordes\u2019 farewell was quite half-baked. The impression that stood out the most about him was the fact that his stubble and loosely hanging bangs had become frayed and messy in the last few days. However, for some reason, Caules actually felt that that Gordes was more likable like this.</p><p>\u201CYes, returning alive is the major premise of this mission. Please take care of the homunculi here as well.\u201D</p><p>\u201CDon\u2019t dump these guys on my lap. They\u2019re already living quite fine on their own as they please.\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2014Fiore-sama, don\u2019t worry. No matter what he may say, Gordes-sama is a man with a generous and kind heart who saved us all.\u201D</p><p>Next to Gordes, Tool spoke while emphasizing the \u201Csama\u201D. Gordes turned and glared at Tool bitterly, but she feigned innocence.</p><p>\u201CUfufu. In that case, we\u2019ll be off.\u201D</p><p>\u201CSee ya, Gordes-ossan. Try not to argue with the homunculi too much.\u201D</p><p>\u201CFool, who would start an argument they\u2019re clearly going to lose? Just go already!\u201D</p><p>Lastly, Archer of Black bowed his head courteously, and then the limousine departed. As Gordes watched it leave, he had a sudden thought.</p><p>\u2014The Holy Grail War is beyond the means of us magi.</p><p>An omnipotent wish-granting device\u2026 A parasitic magical tool that connects to the leylines and continuously absorbs vast amounts of mana. However, to put it another way, it was the same as the nuclear weapons made by those who\u2019d been drunk on science. Moreover, it was uncertain whether it could even be properly controlled. It couldn\u2019t even be activated without conducting the ritual of the Holy Grail War. And to finish the ritual, you had to take down six pairs of incredibly strong Masters and Servants\u2014</p><p>The whole setup had too many holes to count. Yet even as he thought that, Gordes was self-aware enough to acknowledge that he lacked talent. Not talent as a magus\u2014perhaps it would be better to say he lacked the resourcefulness to fight and win.</p><p>He didn\u2019t think that he lacked skill as a magus. But he hadn\u2019t sincerely tried to deal with things like strategy and tactics.</p><p>It was too late for him to regret it now. He knew that. He knew that, but\u2014</p><p>\u201CHey, what are you moping over? We don\u2019t have the time to slack off here, remember?\u201D</p><p>\u201CI know, damn it. I know already.\u201D</p><p>Gordes drowned out those pointless thoughts. That\u2019s right, it was already too late. No matter who won or lost next, and regardless of whether or not humanity was saved, none of it had anything to do with Gordes.</p><p>Those were things for saints and heroes to think about. Right now, Gordes had several problems that he had to deal with as soon as possible.</p><p>The first thing he had to do\u2014was notify the entire clan that they had effectively lost in the Great Holy Grail War and then send a message of surrender to the Association in order to try and bring an end to the conflict with minimal sacrifices.</p><p>The whole prospect of it was depressing, but he convinced himself by saying it was better than dying. Gordes was used to receiving insults, ridicule and scorn, and he had tasted humiliation several times in just the past few days.</p><p>Bowing his head in shame and apologizing to their sworn enemy the Association was practically nothing for him at this point. However, he had far too few advantageous cards to bring to the negotiation table.</p><p>This negotiation might drag on for a long while\u2014</p><p>\u201CHey, what are you daydreaming around for? Hurry up, we\u2019re starting the castle repairs today.\u201D</p><p>Recalling that particular matter thanks to Tool\u2019s words, Gordes changed his plans. First, he would start with the work that was right in front of him\u2026 It wasn\u2019t like he wanted to push off the unpleasant work for later. Not at all.</p><hr><p>It was already past evening by the time Fiore arrived at the safe house Sieg and the others were staying at. After she knocked, Rider swiftly opened the door with Sieg and Ruler in tow.</p><p>Fiore sat in her wheelchair before the door with Archer of Black behind her.</p><p>\u201CAh, it\u2019s that time already?\u201D</p><p>\u201CSorry for making you wait. Then, shall we get going?\u201D</p><p>Rider of Black tilted his head in puzzlement.</p><p>\u201CGet going where?\u201D</p><p>\u201CAh, I still haven\u2019t informed you all. We\u2019re going to the Henry Coanda International Airport. There, we\u2019ll board airplanes and head to the Hanging Gardens. Please come board the car, everyone. I don\u2019t mind if you change into your armor now.\u201D</p><p>Fiore guided the three of them to the limousine. Ruler and Rider followed her suggestion and changed into their armor.</p><p>\u201CAll right\u2026 Are you sure you haven\u2019t forgotten anything, Sieg-kun?\u201D</p><p>\u201COf course not. This is the only equipment I have, anyway.\u201D</p><p>Sieg patted the sword hanging from his waist. It was the sword that Rider of Black had lent him. He probably wouldn\u2019t even have a chance to use it in the final battle. By the time he resorted to using this, the situation would likely be hopelessly bleak.</p><p>Even so, Sieg felt reassured when he carried this, like an iron rod supporting his back. Not because having a sword was reassuring, but because it made him remember the warmth of the person who had given it to him.</p><p>\u201CI plan to keep it with me, but is that all right with you, Rider?\u201D</p><p>Rider readily agreed as if it were only natural.</p><p>\u201COf course. I gave it to you, after all.\u201D</p><p>While feeling slightly reluctant to part with the safe house they had stayed at for a short while, the three of them joined Fiore in the limousine.</p><p>\u201CWow, it\u2019s so spacious inside!\u201D</p><p>\u201CUmm, is it really okay to wear my armor in here? It\u2019s hard to sit here without damaging the seats\u2014\u201D</p><p>\u201CI don\u2019t mind. This car and everything in it are merely appropriated goods,\u201D Fiore smoothly replied, as she skillfully sat herself down on the rear seat with her already activated Bronze-Link Manipulators.</p><p>\u201CNow, let\u2019s be off! We should arrive\u2026\u2026 in about five minutes.\u201D</p><p>It was so close that they wouldn\u2019t even have the time to properly enjoy the limousine.</p><p>\u201C\u2026Couldn\u2019t we just walk?\u201D</p><p>Fiore firmly denied Ruler\u2019s suggestion.</p><p>\u201CWe rarely get the chance to use this limousine. This might be the last time we get to ride it.\u201D</p><p>And with that, they arrived at the airport in the blink of an eye.</p><p>Unlike Sieg, who was a homunculus born in the Yggdmillennia castle, and Rider, who was a Servant summoned in the castle, Ruler had arrived in this country from France through this airport, and thus she recognized just how abnormal the current situation was.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t that anything had changed here. There was merely no one else around. The taxies in front of the airport, the customers, even the security guards\u2026 They were all gone.</p><p>\u201CAh, yes. It\u2019d be a problem if we were seen by anyone, so naturally, I reserved the whole place. From the next twelve hours, we\u2019ll be the only ones using this airport.\u201D</p><p>\u201CReserved, you say\u2026?\u201D</p><p>Ruler was left completely speechless in the face of Fiore\u2019s casual words. Sieg and Rider seemed to be thinking \u2018We can\u2019t afford to involve any outsiders, so that\u2019s a wise decision\u2019 and thought no more of it. In Ruler\u2019s eyes, though, reserving an entire international airport went beyond the realm of the ridiculous.</p><p>In front of the airport entrance doors, men in suits stood imposingly as watchman in place of the airport\u2019s security guards.</p><p>When Fiore approached them and swiftly said what seemed to be a password, the men nodded and opened the doors.</p><p>\u201CI\u2019ve set up a Boundary Field to keep people away around the airport. No one will be able to approach within a several kilometer radius around this area.</p><p>\u201CWow, it really is completely deserted,\u201D murmured Rider of Black in amazement.</p><p>Just as Rider had said, there was no one besides themselves in this vast airport. There were no receptionists at the counter, the always-running baggage claim conveyor belt was halted, and even the electronic display boards were off.</p><p>\u201CEven I can\u2019t help but be amazed by my own sister\u2026\u201D Caules murmured in astonishment, as someone who had the common sense of an ordinary person. \u201CJust how much money did you spend on all this?\u201D</p><p>\u201CIt wasn\u2019t that much. The price of arranging this was only five times the cost of the Mystic Code I designed. The bigger problem was the money to purchase the airplanes. Really now, I asked for old second-hand planes since they\u2019re going to be scrapped anyway, yet why did they cost so much? We truly are lucky to have the fortune that Grandfather Darnic left behind.\u201D</p><p>\u201CWell, that\u2019s\u2026 because they\u2019re jumbo jets.\u201D</p><p>Sieg looked down at the visible airfield through the window in amazement. There were a total of ten old jumbo jets which Fiore had bought.</p><p>Fiore said that they were going to use all of these with their destruction in mind from the start. True, it was a valid decision, since a single plane would be completely annihilated by concentrated attacks. So instead, they would send out several decoy plans to increase their chances of survival\u2026 It was quite reasonable, if you didn\u2019t take the accompanying cost into account.</p><p>\u201CThen, we\u2019ll deploy in the formation I explained in the car\u2026 Rider.\u201D</p><p>\u201CYes, yes?\u201D</p><p>\u201CYour tome is our final hope. Have you remembered its true name?\u201D</p><p>\u201CErr\u2026\u201D</p><p>Rider awkwardly averted his eyes\u2014the faces of everyone else present turned pale.</p><p>\u201CHey, don\u2019t tell me you still don\u2019t remember!? After coming all this way, that\u2019s\u2014\u201D</p><p>Fiore drew close and pressed Rider, who waved his hands frantically.</p><p>\u201CIt\u2019ll be fine, it\u2019ll fine! Once it\u2019s night, I\u2019ll remember it! But look, it\u2019s still evening right now. Just give me a little more time, okay?\u201D</p><p>\u201CWe can trust you, right?\u201D</p><p>\u201CLeave it to me!\u201D</p><p>Rider confidently placed his hand over his chest\u2014however, dubious stares remained fixed on him.</p><p>\u201CAha, ahaha\u2026 Master, help!\u201D</p><p>Rider ran behind Sieg\u2019s back to protect himself from the stares.</p><p>\u201CRider\u2026 I\u2019d like to talk with you about something with just the two of us, is that all right?\u201D</p><p>\u201CEh? No, umm\u2014\u201D</p><p>Rider tried to say \u201CWait a minute\u201D, but Sieg grabbed his arm without bothering to ask for any further permission and moved them both away from everyone else.</p><p>\u201C\u2026What is it?\u201D</p><p>\u201CA love confession, perhaps?\u201D</p><p>The two siblings present both tilted their head curiously and conversed without any sense of tension.</p><p>\u201CMaybe if it was Rider, but there\u2019s no way Sieg would do that.\u201D</p><p>Archer of Black joined their conversation as well, equally unconcerned. Meanwhile, for some reason, Ruler had gone off to follow Sieg and Rider.</p><p>\u201CW-What, what, what?\u201D</p><p>Sieg pushed Rider against the wall next to a paper cup coffee vending machine as if to hide him in its shadow\u2014upon which Rider stared at Sieg with open confusion. That\u2019s a rare expression for Rider, thought Sieg.</p><p>\u201CRider. I\u2019m asking this to make sure.\u201D</p><p>\u201CY-Yeah?\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2014Are you scared?\u201D</p><p>The question was blunt and sudden, and that\u2019s precisely why it caught Rider off guard. Rider stared at Sieg dumfounded for a short while, but then his shoulders discouragingly drooped.</p><p>\u201C\u2026Yeah. But how did you know?\u201D</p><p>\u201CYou told me before, remember? That you became scared the instant you regained your senses. The brighter and fuller the moon is, the more your sense of reason vanishes. But to put it another way, you regain your reason on dark nights when the moon isn\u2019t out, enough that you can remember your tome\u2019s true name.\u201D</p><p>\u201CDespite the situation, I\u2019m still happy that your remembered those casual words of mine\u2026 Yeah, it\u2019s exactly as you guessed. Master, I\u2019m\u2026 scared. I know you\u2019re probably disappointed at hearing words completely unsuitable for a Servant, but I\u2019m scared,\u201D murmured Rider with a gloomy expression.</p><p>\u201CDo you mean\u2026 you\u2019re scared of dying?\u201D</p><p>\u201CHmm? No, not that. I\u2019m not scared of dying. This much is true. I really don\u2019t like pain and dying, but it\u2019s not scary.\u201D</p><p>\u201CThen what are you\u2014?\u201D</p><p>Rider sighed in lamentation.</p><p>\u201CObviously, I\u2019m scared of you dying. Seeing someone you care about die and understanding that they\u2019re dead really takes its toll. When my sanity evaporates, I can forget about it for a while. It\u2019s precisely because I forget about it that I can take absurd risks. But when my thoughts become clear like they are now, I keep imagining terrifying outcomes.\u201D</p><p>Even if he released the book\u2019s true name, what if the enemy had some means to counteract it?</p><p>The only thing the tome could block was magecraft. It couldn\u2019t block the physical attacks of Rider and Archer of Red. If one of them managed to land a hit on Rider of Black\u2014it would be a fatal blow.</p><p>He\u2019d die. And everyone else would too. All because he was weak.</p><p>\u201CI wish I were stronger. I wish I could stay a fool who even forgets the fact that he\u2019s weak. But on nights of the new moon, it\u2019s no good. When my reason returns, I\u2019m\u2014\u201D</p><p>Sieg grasped Rider of Black\u2019s hand. He spoke while looking at Rider right in the eye with the same perfectly transparent gaze he\u2019d had when they\u2019d first met.</p><p>\u201CIt doesn\u2019t matter whether you\u2019re strong or weak. I think and believe that you\u2019re an amazing person, Rider. After all, you saved me. You would have done the same thing regardless of whether or not you had your sense of reason, right?\u201D</p><p>Though surprised at having his hand held, Rider managed to vaguely nod.</p><p>Yes. That\u2019s why you\u2019re fine the way you are, thought Sieg.</p><p>\u201CWhether we fail and die or succeed and live, nothing would have begun for me in the first place if you hadn\u2019t saved me back then. I wouldn\u2019t have met Ruler either. The very fact that I\u2019m standing here right now is already miraculous. That\u2019s why you\u2019re fine the way you are. Just do as you please like always.\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2026It\u2019s okay if I fail?\u201D</p><p>\u201CI don\u2019t mind.\u201D</p><p>\u201CYou might die, you know?\u201D</p><p>\u201CBut I might not die too. Either way, I won\u2019t stop now after everything that\u2019s happened. I\u2019m fine as long as you continue to be yourself, Rider. The way I see it, the fact that you\u2019re scared of what might happen to me if you fail\u2026 is also very much like you, Rider.\u201D</p><p>\u2014Rider sighed in relief.</p><p>In other words, that was all he wanted to hear. That Sieg wouldn\u2019t be disappointed in him for becoming scared after regaining his reason. He absolutely hated the thought of disappointing the Master who he had chosen and who had chosen him in turn.</p><p>\u201C\u2014As long as you continue to be yourself, Rider.\u201D</p><p>Both the way he fears failure and his foolishness that fears no one is just like him. That\u2019s what his Master was saying.</p><p>In that case, the answer was simple. Rider would just do his best. Whether he succeeded or failed\u2014doing his best was truly like him, after all.</p><p>\u201CI see. You\u2019re saying that it\u2019s fine if I stay the way I am.\u201D</p><p>\u201CYeah. That\u2019s more than enough.\u201D</p><p>Rider of Black tried to gloss over the tears in his eyes as he frantically wiped them.</p><p>\u201CYeah, you\u2019re right! \u2026Yeah. Huh, how strange. Even though I was thinking of nothing but failure just now, suddenly I feel all calm. I feel like everything will go well!\u201D</p><p>Sieg smiled happily at Rider, whose depressed expression had completely disappeared.</p><p>\u201CAll right, let\u2019s depart! Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll protect you, Master! We\u2019ve made it this far already, so let\u2019s charge in boldly and grab our happy ending!\u201D</p><p>In complete reversal from when they\u2019d come here, Rider grabbed Sieg\u2019s arm and pulled him along to go back to the rest of the group. Though a bit confused, Sieg understood that his Servant had somehow cheered up, making him feel relieved.</p><p>And at the same time, he held an unexplainable, sad conviction\u2014that having his arm pulled along again and again like this would soon come to an end.</p><p>Even if everything went well in every way\u2014Sieg was certain that they couldn\u2019t avoid an eternal farewell.</p><p>\u2026Ruler wanted to believe that the pain in her heart was just her imagination. But the hot ache spreading in her chest told her that it wasn\u2019t.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t that she was hurt by Sieg and Rider\u2019s conversation. The two of them completely understood each other as Master and Servant. That was a good thing. Mutual misunderstandings between Master and Servant could only lead to tragedy.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t narrow-minded enough to be jealous of that. What pained her was just one thing. The words that Sieg had casually said.</p><p>\u201CThe very fact that I\u2019m standing here right now is already miraculous.\u201D</p><p>That\u2019s right. It truly was a miracle. Ruler had brought him all the way here. Of course, it was a path that Sieg had chosen himself. She hadn\u2019t forced him. She\u2019d even rebuked him for it. But in the end, he had arrived here.</p><p>It was both his choice and her choice. And yet, she still couldn\u2019t get rid of the feeling that he had arrived here as if intentionally guided here.</p><p>Ruler wanted to know the reason for his presence here.</p><p>\u2026At the same time, she didn\u2019t want to know. If she learned the reason, she felt as if she would be crushed by guilt for bringing him with her this far.</p><p>But what pained her most was the thought of what Sieg himself might think.</p><p>If he understood that she had intentionally guided him here, he would probably scorn her. He would loathe her. He would probably see her as a reaper who had pushed misfortune unto him\u2014</p><p>She couldn\u2019t bear it.</p><p>She was used to being slandered. She\u2019d even experienced people using her and then suddenly coldly abandoning her.</p><p>But she couldn\u2019t endure the thought of betraying someone who had believed in her with innocent trust. Even more so since he was the boy who the girl insider her, Laeticia, had feelings for.</p><p>Aah\u2014her heart hurt so much it felt like her very veins were in pain from the blood pumping through her heart to the point of bursting.</p><p>She wanted to reveal everything to him. She wanted to confess and ask for his forgiveness. But that would just hurt him instead of her.</p><p>Besides, it wasn\u2019t certain yet that the worst would happen. Even if it was true that he had reached here due to some higher \u2018will\u2019\u2026 Even if he was chosen to be the \u2018destroyer\u2019 of the Holy Grail, it wouldn\u2019t necessarily require his life to accomplish it.</p><p>True, he could turn into Saber of Black, but he wasn\u2019t Saber of Black himself.</p><p>All she could do was hold onto that faint hope.</p><p>Those black Command Spells, and the impossible phenomenon of a homunculus turning into a Servant, even if for only three minutes. That was a frightening miracle that chipped away at one\u2019s life and had to be sacrificing something in exchange.</p><p>Ruler was filled with dread at the thought of what result it would ultimately lead it.</p><p>An ending filled with nothing but sorrow\u2014she absolutely wouldn\u2019t allow it to happen.</p><p>\u201C\u2026It\u2019s time. We should get going now.\u201D</p><p>\u201CHuh? Now that I think about it, what about the pilots? I can pilot a plane, but the remaining nine\u2026\u201D</p><p>\u201CDon\u2019t worry. We\u2019ve put golems installed with the skill to pilot in all ten planes. They\u2019re golems that Roche originally created, so their ability is guaranteed.\u201D</p><p>Being capable of \u2018expanding\u2019 their techniques and abilities after their initial creation according to need was one of the advantages of golems. Fortunately, they still had some humanoid golems that Roche had made left, and it was simple to install abilities that he designed beforehand into them.</p><p>\u201CWe\u2019ll be boarding this plane, so this is where we part.\u201D</p><p>From this point on, Fiore would be acting independently of her Servant Archer.</p><p>Since they would surely clash with Rider of Red, who could fly through the skies, before they reached the Hanging Gardens, it was very likely that Fiore would get caught up in their battle if she stayed with Archer.</p><p>As much as it made her feel lonely, having Archer ride a different plane was the correct decision.</p><p>\u201C\u2026Archer. May the fortunes of war be with you.\u201D</p><p>\u201CThank you, Fiore. I will obtain victory for you.\u201D</p><p>Fiore shook her head at her Servant\u2019s words.</p><p>\u201CThere\u2019s no need to do it for me. It\u2019s you that matters most here. I want you to fight to your heart\u2019s content. \u2014I permit you to use your Noble Phantasm as you see fit. There\u2019s no need to wait for orders from me. If you feel that you should use it, please do so.\u201D</p><p>Archer solemnly nodded. Her words meant that she was abandoning any intention of interfering in his battle and was entrusting everything to him. This wasn\u2019t an act of irresponsibility, but rather proof of her absolute trust in her Servant.</p><p>\u201CThen, we should get going.\u201D</p><p>\u201CYes\u2026 Let\u2019s meet again at the Hanging Gardens.\u201D</p><p>They were very curt words of farewell. Fiore stifled the regret at parting inside her\u2014and gave him a final smile as she left his side. She thought that bursting into tears would be shameful. Her Servant also understood that, which was why he didn\u2019t speak to her more than necessary, in order to protect that resolve of hers.</p><p>\u201CArcher.\u201D</p><p>\u201CYes. I wish you luck as well, Caules-dono. And, about my Master\u2014\u201D</p><p>\u201CNo need to even ask\u2026 Go beat Rider of Red, Archer.\u201D</p><p>Caules ended his farewell with a last wave of his hand. As if nothing had happened between them at all, he then pushed his sister\u2019s wheelchair towards their plane.</p><p>\u201CDon\u2019t die, you two!\u201D</p><p>The two siblings couldn\u2019t help smiling wryly at Rider of Black\u2019s rude farewell. Caules turned around and called out to him with an exasperated expression.</p><p>\u201CRight back at you, Rider. Don\u2019t get carried away and die by mistake.\u201D</p><p>\u201CI-I never get carried away! Stupid, stupid!\u201D</p><p>\u201CNo, you do,\u201D murmured Sieg next to Rider. However, it was certainly true that Rider was stronger when he got carried away than not.</p><p>\u201CCaules\u2026 Are you really fine with coming?\u201D</p><p>Fiore questioned her younger brother one final time as he pushed her wheelchair. Fiore was going off to a deadly battleground out of her sense of responsibility as a Master. But even if Caules was technically Archer\u2019s second Master, it wouldn\u2019t pose much impediment to Archer\u2019s prana supply if he didn\u2019t come.</p><p>\u2026That reasoning was correct. It was correct, but Caules still rejected it.</p><p>\u201CI\u2019m your younger brother. Isn\u2019t that reason enough?\u201D</p><p>\u2014What truly human-like words.</p><p>Fiore smiled at that thought. Normally speaking, such upright, human-like words should be avoided by magi. A proper magus wouldn\u2019t and shouldn\u2019t stick their heads into such an absurd situation.</p><p>\u201CBesides, it\u2019s not often that a mere magus gets the change to witness magecraft from the Age of Gods.\u201D</p><p>And in contrast, those were truly words befitting a magus. Magi wouldn\u2019t risk their own lives so easily. But it was a different matter when it came to magecraft. And the magecraft used by Assassin of Red\u2014Semiramis\u2014were truly miracles from the Age of Gods. If magi could get the chance to witness it, risking their lives was a cheap price.</p><p>Hearing that, Fiore nodded, feeling slightly relieved.</p><p>Compared to the likes of Fiore, Caules seemed to have much greater self-awareness as their family\u2019s successor and resolve as a magus, irreplaceably important things to have when walking the path of magecraft\u2014</p><p>\u201CThen, I\u2019ll be heading off next.\u201D</p><p>After seeing off the two siblings, Archer chose the plane he would ride. To him, any plane besides the one his Master rode was fine with him.</p><p>In the first place, the planes were merely footholds to Archer, whose job was to intercept Rider of Red.</p><p>\u201CArcher!\u201D</p><p>Archer turned around at Rider of Black\u2019s call. Rider made the victory sign with his hand at him while wearing a beaming smile.</p><p>\u201CMake sure to win! It\u2019s embarrassing if the teacher loses to his student!\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2014Yes, it\u2019s just as you say. I lived a long life, but I\u2019ve never allowed myself to lose to my students even once, at least. In that case, I have to make sure to win.\u201D</p><p>After replying that in a light tone, Archer boarded his plane.</p><p>\u201CYeah, in that condition, he\u2019ll probably be fine.\u201D</p><p>\u201CIn that case, I\u2019ll be going as well.\u201D</p><p>After performing consecrations on the planes loaded with explosives, Ruler would be boarding a different plane.</p><p>To her, the one unfortunate aspect of this plan was that she would be acting separately from Sieg from here on.</p><p>To act as the flagbearer who led the front charge\u2014that was Ruler\u2019s duty in their plan to board the Hanging Gardens.</p><p>\u201CBe careful, Ruler.\u201D</p><p>Ruler smiled faintly at Sieg\u2019s words. Sieg felt that that smile was oddly sad for some reason.</p><p>\u201CSieg-kun, please try not to anything excessive. I know it goes without saying at this point, but\u2014\u201D</p><p>\u201CTransforming a third time is forbidden, right? I know.\u201D</p><p>Ruler had repeatedly told him that at every opportunity over the past several days. The way she said it was always strangely pressing, so even Sieg had to nod in acquiescence.</p><p>\u2014However, this isn\u2019t a situation where I can likely afford not to transform at some point.</p><p>Suddenly, Ruler\u2019s expression became downcast.</p><p>\u201C\u2026Even I understand, you know. Under these circumstances, there\u2019s no way you won\u2019t transform, Sieg-kun. You\u2019re unmistakably a Master, and you chose to fight. There\u2019s no way you won\u2019t end up using your power.\u201D</p><p>She spoke as if she\u2019d read his thoughts. Sieg sighed. Just as expected, Ruler also seemed to understand. There was no way to stop him besides making him withdraw from the Great Holy Grail War.</p><p>The homunculus Sieg had chosen to fight out of his own will. Even Ruler couldn\u2019t stop him with words at this point.</p><p>Ruler couldn\u2019t say it. She was too scared to say it, and she understood that, even if she did\u2014his determination would remain unchanged.</p><p>Even if you chose to fight not out of your own will, but because of fate?</p><p>What if you\u2019ve been caught up in a great unstoppable flow and are subject to a destiny that can\u2019t be resisted?</p><p>And what if what aided that process was none than me due to having received a revelation?</p><p>\u201C\u2026What\u2019s wrong?\u201D</p><p>\u2014What would you think of me then?</p><p>\u201CIt\u2019s nothing. Then, Sieg-kun, let\u2019s meet again at the Gardens.\u201D</p><p>After bidding farewell to him with a smile, Ruler turned her back on Sieg and Rider of Black. She went to board the plane that Fiore had instructed her to, and Sieg tilted his head in puzzlement as he saw her off.</p><p>\u201CIs it just me, or did she seem like she wanted to say something?\u201D</p><p>\u201CIf she had something she wanted to say, Ruler would properly say it. Just now, she probably had something she wanted to say but couldn\u2019t.\u201D</p><p>\u201CDo you know what it is, Rider?\u201D</p><p>\u201CI don\u2019t. Ah, but, well\u2014\u201D</p><p>Rider looked at Sieg with a pleased expression.</p><p>\u201CShe cares deeply for you. That much is certain!\u201D</p><p>Rider grinned and hit Sieg on the back, apparently amused by something. The hit didn\u2019t hurt, but Sieg coughed from having been taken by surprise.</p><p>She cares deeply for you. Sieg repeated those words in his mind. Just the fact that she cared deeply for a homunculus like him made him feel happy somehow.</p><p>\u201CNow then, Master. Let\u2019s get going too!\u201D</p><p>\u201CYeah\u2026 Let\u2019s go, Rider.\u201D</p><p>Sieg swore to himself that he would survive this battle. He had to properly ascertain the right timing to use his remaining three transformations\u2014no, if he followed Ruler\u2019s advice, then it was only two transformations.</p><p>When they boarded the plane, the interior was naturally empty of any other people. His curiosity-filled Servant went to peek at the golem in the cockpit, but Sieg wasn\u2019t all that interested himself and so just chose a random seat to sit down and wait for their departure.</p><p>As he looked around the plane, what caught his eye was an Ouija board that clearly didn\u2019t belong in an airplane. The board had old-style alphabet letters and numbers carved into its surface. Attached on top of it was a needle like that of a record player and a cable, and the other end of the cable was attached to an old-fashioned metal pipe. Sieg surmised that it was a wireless communicator used by magi.</p><p>Besides the board, there wasn\u2019t anything else in the plane that had been added or remodelled. There were no defenses against magecraft installed either\u2026 Though, considering the power of their enemy, even if Fiore had spent Yggdmillennia\u2019s entire fortune on reinforcing and upgrading the planes, it would only increase the time it took for the planes to be destroyed from ten seconds to fifteen seconds.</p><p>Though Sieg had some basic knowledge about airplanes, he hadn\u2019t thought the interior would be so big and spacious. A flight spell was so simple that even a novice magus could learn it. But it had taken ordinary humans two thousand years to create this kind of aircraft without magecraft.</p><p>Their advancement was slow, but certain. Meanwhile, magecraft kept going further and further beyond humanity\u2019s limits\u2014but where was that path leading to now?</p><p>\u201CSorry for making you wait.\u201D</p><p>As Sieg was internally marveling over the differences between science and magecraft, Rider came back from the cockpit. He cheerfully reported that a big stone spider-like golem was in the pilot\u2019s seat.</p><p>\u201CIt\u2019s almost time, Master.\u201D</p><p>Sitting in the seat next to Sieg, Rider waved his legs up and down in unconstrained excitement.</p><p>\u201CAh, right, it\u2019s probably better to summon him now. Come out, Hippogriff!\u201D</p><p>Before Sieg could stop him, Rider summoned his hippogriff. The materialized hippogriff was, as expected, confused by his current surroundings and gazed over the cramped plane interior restlessly.</p><p>\u201CSit!\u201D</p><p>Seeming to be well trained, the hippogriff sat down, conspicuously destroying several seats in his way in the process.</p><p>\u201CAll that\u2019s left is the book.\u201D</p><p>Rider materialized his Noble Phantasm\u2014Luna Break Manual: Universal Magic Guide (Temporary Name). Both the hippogriff and the time were Noble Phantasms containing enormous power, and as a result\u2014they were easy to detect if the Red Servants choose to search for prana signatures.</p><p>This was another part of Fiore\u2019s plan. Both Archer of Black and Ruler were powerful Servants with strong prana signatures. By having them each protect different planes, it made it harder for the Red camp to concentrate their attacks on a single target.</p><p>Archer of Black would intercept Rider of Red and Ruler would intercept Archer and Lancer of Red. And Rider of Black\u2014would tackle Assassin of Red\u2019s temple Noble Phantasm, the Hanging Gardens of Babylon: Aerial Gardens of Vanity, as a rematch after his defeat against her last time.</p><p>However, he had been shot down completely after a single attack last time. Therefore\u2014this time, he had to draw out the tome\u2019s true name.</p><p>\u201C\u2026Ah. Looks like we\u2019re about to depart.\u201D</p><p>Rider noticed that the plane had begun to move. Sieg, who\u2019d been reading the in-flight manual to kill time, dutifully put on his seat belt.</p><p>\u201CIs there any point in that?\u201D asked Rider.</p><p>\u201CProbably not. If the plane falls, it\u2019ll be due to a Servant\u2019s attack, and even if it falls without being destroyed, you\u2019ll save me, right, Rider?\u201D</p><p>\u201CAhaha, of course.\u201D</p><p>As they chatted nonchalantly, they felt a slight pressure weigh down on their bodies. The jumbo jet\u2019s four giant turbo fan engines began to roar loudly.</p><p>Suddenly, the Ouija board\u2019s needle began to move. The needle pointed at certain letters and numbers while releasing a creaking sound. After a while, a voice came out of the board.</p><p>\u201CCan you hear me, Rider?\u201D said Fiore\u2019s voice.</p><p>Rider picked up the transmitter to respond.</p><p>\u201CI can hear you. Can you hear me? Testing, testing.\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2026Your voice is too loud. Please move your mouth away from the communicator a bit. Ruler has roughly grasped the location of the Hanging Gardens, but she can\u2019t say when and where we\u2019ll reach it. Make sure to keep on guard, okay?\u201D</p><p>\u201CI get it, I get it! It\u2019ll be fine, don\u2019t worry!\u201D</p><p>\u201CNaturally, you\u2019ve already remembered the tome\u2019s true name, right?\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2026\u2026Yeah!\u201D</p><p>\u201CWait. What was that long pause for\u2014!?\u201D</p><p>Click. Rider flipped off the Ouija board\u2019s power and turned his face away in feigned innocence. Then, he seemed to remember Sieg\u2019s presence and trembled a little.</p><p>\u201C\u2026It\u2019ll be fine, right?\u201D</p><p>\u201CDon\u2019t worry. I believe in you.\u201D</p><p>Sieg neither got angry nor laughed, but merely nodded with a serious and honest expression. Of course, he already knew that this was the most effective way to put pressure on Rider. The hippogriff squawked as if to express agreement with Sieg.</p><p>\u201CUfufu. As long as my Master understands what kind of Servant I am, everything is good.\u201D</p><p>Rider of Black\u2019s smile was clearly stiff as he replied.</p><p>Immediately afterwards, the plane lifted off the ground gently. Sieg looked out the window\u2014the lump of metal they were riding was soaring through the sky at several hundred kilometers per hour.</p><p>Below, Bucharest became tiny in the blink of an eye. The people on the streets weren\u2019t even the size of dots at this point. Their forms were indistinguishable amidst the dark town with only the tiny blinking lights from lamps visible.</p><p>The plane ascended further. Eventually, nothing could be seen outside the window\u2014Sieg guessed that they were above the clouds now. The plane interior was brightly lit by the cabin lights, but the outside was painted completely black.</p><p>For the next while, all they could do was wait. Rider began eating treats he apparently got at the airport while sharing one with the hippogriff. The hippogriff scowled after one taste and spit it out, but Rider continued eating with a beaming smile.</p><p>After a while, the Ouija board began moving again\u2014another communication from someone was coming.</p><p>\u201C\u2026Sieg-kun, are you there?\u201D</p><p>This time, Jeanne\u2019s voice came from the communicator. Sieg picked up the receiver.</p><p>\u201CI\u2019m here. What is it?\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2026\u201D</p><p>Even though she was the one who had called, Ruler awkwardly sank into silence.</p><p>\u201CRuler?\u201D</p><p>\u201CUmm\u2014why do airplanes fly?\u201D</p><p>Then, without warning, she threw out that fundamental question.</p><p>\u201CErr. They fly due to the flow of air released by the wings, I think. It\u2019d take a while to fully explain, but why do you ask?\u201D</p><p>\u201CW-What would happen if the wings were torn off?\u201D</p><p>\u201CThe plane would decelerate and fall. Of course, the same thing would happen if the engines stalled.\u201D</p><p>\u201CWouldn\u2019t that be really serious!?\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2026It would. Though, we probably wouldn\u2019t have the time to think about that if it actually occurred.\u201D</p><p>\u2014More importantly, based on Ruler\u2019s stressed tone\u2026</p><p>\u201CRuler, could it be that you\u2019re bad with airplanes?\u201D</p><p>\u201CYes!\u201D</p><p>Her reply was quite vigorous.</p><p>\u201CI see\u2026 It\u2019s unfortunate, but try to endure it. We can\u2019t stop at this point, after all.\u201D</p><p>\u201CUugh, I know that. I know, but\u2014\u201D</p><p>Even if she understood, scary things were scary and unpleasant things were unpleasant. Sieg pondered a little, and then tried to speak to her reassuringly.</p><p>\u201CIt\u2019ll be over soon\u2026 Though, it\u2019d be a real problem if the Hanging Gardens is also no good for you, considering how it floats in in the sky.\u201D</p><p>\u201CAh, that\u2019s not an issue for me. The Hanging Gardens is powered by magecraft and prana, after all.\u201D</p><p>From Sieg\u2019s perspective, something flying using magecraft was more untrustworthy than an airplane. A machine didn\u2019t make mistakes. A machine merely got work out and tired; as long as a proper machine was made properly using the proper procedure, it would merely abide by physical laws.</p><p>However, it was true that, from the perspective of someone from the 15th century, machines were probably far more untrustworthy than any kind of mysticism. It was common sense to them that metal cracked and broke. Humans had spent hundreds of years making durable metals and advanced to the point of making materials that could withstand precise flight\u2014but its appearance hadn\u2019t changed at all.</p><p>\u201CYou should trust humans and the science that humans have cultivated a bit more. Well, I might not be in a position to say this as a homunculus myself, though\u2026\u201D</p><p>After Sieg said that, Ruler turned silent, as if his words had caught her off guard somehow.</p><p>After a while, she let out a small sigh of admiration.</p><p>\u201C\u2026You\u2019re right. There\u2019s no point if I don\u2019t believe in what humans had cultivated. The fact that airplanes fly is the crystallization of hard work that doesn\u2019t rely on magecraft. Making a lump of metal like this fly truly is a miracle!\u201D</p><p>\u201CYeah, I get the feeling your trust in it is still a bit shaky, but as long as you understand\u2014\u201D</p><p>Sieg cut off his words as he heard Ruler suddenly draw in a sharp breath.</p><p>\u201CRuler?\u201D</p><p>\u201CTell Rider to get ready.\u201D</p><p>The hippogriff growled in apparent warning.</p><p>\u201C\u2014Oops, looks like this is it. We\u2019ve arrived, Master.\u201D</p><p>Upon hearing Rider\u2019s grim tone, Sieg took a moment to take a deep breath. He felt like the air itself was burning. His acute sense of smell as a homunculus detected the huge swirl of prana lying ahead of them.</p><p>\u201CAll right, get on, Master!\u201D</p><p>Rider lightly tapped the hippogriff\u2019s neck and lightly jumped on its back. Rider held out his hand, and Sieg firmly grabbed it.</p><hr><p>The very existence of the temple Noble Phantasm Hanging Gardens of Babylon was miraculous in itself, but the basement room containing the \u2018altar\u2019 that stored the Greater Grail was an especially strange room within the gardens.</p><p>First, its size was clearly abnormal. Considering the total size of the Hanging Gardens, there was no way for there to be any space within so huge its wall were out of sight, but even someone with eyes accustomed to darkness couldn\u2019t see where this vast room ended. Most likely, space was being distorted here through some form of magecraft.</p><p>The floor and walls were all rough and uneven like mortar, except for the area at the center of the room, where the floor was completely smooth. Beyond a series of sun-dried brick stairs that led to the very center, the stolen Fuyuki Greater Grail hovered motionlessness in the air.</p><p>It faintly radiated a pale light, looking as if the moon itself had been summoned into this room.</p><p>But what was even more astonishing was this room\u2019s ceiling\u2026 in other words, the part that served as the \u2018sky\u2019 here.</p><p>There was \u2018water\u2019 running along the ceiling. It was an upside down lake. Upon its surface floated lotuses of a myriad of vibrant colors\u2014it was like looking at rainbow-colored sky.</p><p>This phenomenon was brought about by the concept of reversal that ruled over the Hanging Gardens. The water flowed upwards from the ceiling to the space above, and that water went on to fill the ceiling in the throne room.</p><p>In other words, the water-filled ceilings of this alter room and the throne room were linked, and it was impossible to tell which one was actually located in the basement of the gardens.</p><p>\u201CDear me\u2026 I feel like my sense of reality turns topsy-turvy every time I come to this place.\u201D</p><p>Caster of Red smiled wryly as he looked at the ceiling. Ripples occasionally spread through the water in the sky due to the mana filling the Greater Grail.</p><p>Caster of Red\u2014Shakespeare\u2014was a man who\u2019d been born in an era where magecraft and mysteries weren\u2019t openly exposed to the public. He\u2019d had virtually no opportunity to witness shamans cause a miracle through prayers to their objects of worship or famous magi display impossible phenomena.</p><p>Clairvoyant witches and curses were commonplace in his stories\u2014but those were merely products of Shakespeare\u2019s imagination. The range of his imagination was limitless and could perform terrifyingly huge leaps that could picture anything in detail.</p><p>That\u2019s why it was rare for him to express amazement and awe like this. However, that was perhaps only natural considering the sheer abnormality of the Hanging Gardens and the Greater Grail.</p><p>Shirou Kotomine was standing directly below the Greater Grail in the center of the room.</p><p>Upon noticing Caster\u2019s arrival, Shirou lightly waved his hand in greeting.</p><p>\u201CCaster. My Noble Phantasms are ready.\u201D</p><p>\u201CYes, Master. I\u2019ve also finished preparing my Noble Phantasm.\u201D</p><p>Amakusa Shirou Tokisada\u2019s Noble Phantasms\u2014Right Hand, Evil Eater: Right Arm, Transgression Consumption and Left Hand, Xanadu Matrix: Left Arm, Foundation of Heaven\u2019s Gift.</p><p>Caster of Red\u2019s Noble Phantasm\u2014First Folio: Let the Curtains Rise to Thunderous Applause.</p><p>Their respective Noble Phantasms were neither weapons bestowed by the gods nor famous mounts obtained during adventures.</p><p>Shirou\u2019s Noble Phantasms were the materialization of the miracles he had bestowed onto people in life.</p><p>Caster of Red\u2019s Noble Phantasm was the [book] he had never managed to write during his lifetime.</p><p>Either way, these Noble Phantasms were merely the embodiment of their legends.</p><p>Neither one could face an army, let alone destroy a fortress. In terms of Servant rankings, they were both undoubtedly third-rate.</p><p>But, only at this very moment\u2014only when they combined their Noble Phantasms together was their value completely upturned.</p><p>A holy sword or a divine spear could destroy the Greater Grail.</p><p>But among the Servants in the Great Holy Grail War, the only ones who could take control of the Greater Grail were these two.</p><p>\u201CI\u2019ve already connected the \u2018thread\u2019. It\u2019s what supplies the prana to you and the other Servants, after all.\u201D</p><p>The only Servant who Shirou Kotomine actually supplied prana to as a Master was Assassin of Red. The other Red Servants were merely connected to him through the basic Master-Servant contract, while their prana supply was provided from the Greater Grail, which he\u2019d himself linked to after stealing it.</p><p>Just creating that link had required significant time. He\u2019d searched for a method to accomplish it for several days after stealing it and had only managed to finally form the prana supply connection through the help of Assassin.</p><p>An ordinary mage like Darnic, who wasn\u2019t from the great alchemist Einzbern family who had created the Greater Grail, had likely required decades just to touch the Grail\u2019s system.</p><p>But both the Einzberns and Darnic had merely adjusted its system rather than control the Greater Grails itself. In other words, they had merely activated or slightly improved its original functions.</p><p>Basically, their actions had been limited to switching it On and Off. But what Shirou was about to attempt was something fundamentally different.</p><p>To put it simply, he was going to create a new switch. He wasn\u2019t adjusting the system, but adding in a new system. He was remaking it into a Greater Grail that suited his needs.</p><p>Servants were summoned to the present age through the Greater Grail. Therefore, reprogramming the Greater Grail went beyond dangerous and into the realm of sheer insanity for a Servant like Shirou. Even if all his preparations were perfect.</p><p>That\u2019s why, to Shirou, this was his true battle. All the battles until now had merely been preparations and groundwork. Even if he lost them, he could still make another move.</p><p>But this was completely different. If Shirou lost here, he would come to an end. And if he was gone, everything would be brought to naught\u2014the salvation of humanity would end in failure.</p><p>The light tremble in Shirou\u2019s hands wasn\u2019t from excitement. It was from the fear of knowing everything would end if he lost.</p><p>\u201C\u2014Even so, you\u2019re still here, Master.\u201D</p><p>\u201CYes. After thinking and agonizing over the correct choice for sixty years, I chose to be here. Even if I feel fear, I have no regrets. Then Caster, let\u2019s begin the preparations\u2014but before that.\u201D</p><p>\u201COh?\u201D</p><p>Shirou held out one arm towards Caster. His Command Spells were faintly glowing.</p><p>Caster\u2019s face immediately stiffened.</p><p>\u201C\u2026Master?\u201D</p><p>\u201CCaster. I respect and trust you as a writer from the bottom of my heart. And that\u2019s precisely why I understand. You surely want to write a tragedy. Therefore, this is a necessary piece of insurance.\u201D</p><p>With a radiant smile, Shirou used up a Command Spell.</p><p>\u201CI order you with a Command Spell. Caster, don\u2019t write a tragedy for my story.\u201D</p><p>\u201CGuh\u2026!!\u201D</p><p>The expended Command Spell bounded Caster like a chain.</p><p>The Command was an order with absolute authority created by the Makiri and capable of firmly binding not only a Servant\u2019s body but even their mind. And wording the order not as \u2018forbidding betrayal\u2019, but as \u2018not writing a tragedy\u2019, made it bind Caster of Red even more tightly.</p><p>\u201CMaster\u2026 Such treatment is too awful. This is cruel, far too cruel.\u201D</p><p>Caster of Red loudly lamented\u2014but that was only natural.</p><p>\u201CNo, I already told you, remember? I trust you as a writer. You want to write a tragedy. But if I questioned you about it, you would have to lie. So I never once asked you \u2018Do you want to write a tragedy?\u2019 until now\u2026 If never questioned, you would have no reason to lie, after all.\u201D</p><p>Despite his groaning, Caster of Red had to acknowledge that. It would be a lie if he said that he didn\u2019t intend to write a tragedy. He had thought about not writing one\u2014but when the time came to write, his pen would naturally plunge towards writing a tragedy on its own. The only way to prevent that was for him to decide to write a comedy from the start.</p><p>Caster loudly sighed and shrugged his shoulders.</p><p>\u201CVery well, I will do as you wish. After all, [Sweet are the uses of adversity, which like the toad, ugly and venomous, wears yet a precious jewel in his head].\u201D</p><p>\u201CThank you. I thought restricting the genre of a story would be rude towards the most famous writer known today, though.\u201D</p><p>\u201CFufu, being called a famous writer is embarrassing. I\u2019d prefer it if you gave me such praise after reading my works\u2014\u201D</p><p>\u201CYes, I made sure to read your Four Great Tragedies, at least, before today. That\u2019s why I decided to use a Command Spell.\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2026I see.\u201D</p><p>What a blunder, thought Caster as he held his head in his hands at the irony. Perhaps I shouldn\u2019t have told him to read my works\u2026 No, no, having others read one\u2019s stories is precisely what makes a writer a writer.</p><p>In the first place, this man had already experienced the worst possible tragedy. The thirty-seven thousand people who followed him were massacred and he lost his own life as well. His was a tale of crawling out from the pit of despair and overturning that fate of misfortune.</p><p>In that case\u2014he had to continue to climb up even now. Even if God allowed him to walk away from his path in this situation, a writer never would.</p><p>\u201CI promise to use all my might to write a happy ending instead of a tragedy, Master.\u201D</p><p>\u201CThank you, and sorry for the imposition\u2026 Now then, let\u2019s begin.\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2014You\u2019re so slow. I was wondering when you would finally start.\u201D</p><p>Assassin communicated her clear displeasure through telepathy. Her words were heard by Caster of Red as well. Shirou looked up at the water canopy and apologized with a smile.</p><p>\u201CSorry. \u2014We\u2019re beginning now.\u201D</p><p>\u201CWorst comes to worst, I will discard you. Understood?\u201D</p><p>How terrifying, thought Caster with a slight chill down his back. There was not an even the smallest trace of emotion in her words, words which a Servant should never direct at their Master under any circumstances.</p><p>\u201COf course. That\u2019s only natural.\u201D</p><p>\u2026And even more terrifying was Shirou\u2019s reply, far too bright in face of such unfeeling and merciless words.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t unworried because he thought his Servant wouldn\u2019t do such a thing. There was no way that Assassin was that na\xEFve. In the worst case scenario, she really would choose to abandon him in order to protect herself.</p><p>Which one could be considered madder, a Servant who would unhesitantly betray her Master or a Master who would happily accept that?</p><p>\u201CGood. Then begin, Shirou. And win. Failure is not allowed.\u201D</p><p>Assassin\u2019s words remained unfeeling, but Shirou Kotomine expressed gratitude from the bottom of his heart.</p><p>\u201C\u2014Thank you, Assassin.\u201D</p><p>Shirou smoothly took of his stela and mantle. He took off his cassock and undershirt as well, leaving his upper body naked. His tanned skin had countless sword scars and fire burns carved into it. In Caster\u2019s eyes, his body expressed great sorrow rather than ugliness.</p><p>Shirou then lifted his arms up above him. He opened his palms, as if to make the Greater Grail his by grabbing it.</p><p>His arms were filled with a different radiance than that of the faintly shining Command Spells\u2014Shirou Kotomine\u2019s miracle, his dual Noble Phantasms, were activating.</p><p>\u201CThen I\u2019ll start first.\u201D</p><p>Shirou began to walk with graceful footsteps towards the Greater Grail hovering in the air. As Caster watched him, he was suddenly beset by the illusion that Shirou was walking on a staircase made of corpses.</p><p>The corpses that served as building material for the stairs were the victims who had been eradicated for believing in a faith different from the native religion and following Amakusa Shirou Tokisada. They didn\u2019t feel sadness at being trodden over. In fact, it was clear that they felt joy, even.</p><p>They were grateful from the bottom of their hearts that they\u2019d become sacrifices for saving the world\u2014. It was an illusion, just an illusion, but if these corpses from the past knew of what was happening now, wouldn\u2019t they say the same thing?</p><p>That was what Caster of Red believed.</p><p>As he walked towards the canopy and the Holy Grail, Shirou thought back on the seventeen years of his first life and the sixty years of his second life.</p><p>He had devoted everything for this moment. He had lived with the resolve to sacrifice everything.</p><p>Right now, hundreds of millions of lives, and human goodness itself, rested on his shoulders. It was so heavy he felt like was going to be crushed, but there was no sign of agony on his face.</p><p><img src="https://i2.lensdump.com/i/1sfwIC.jpg" alt=""></p><p>\u2014I won\u2019t lose.</p><p>Shirou took the first step, and connected to the Greater Grail through the \u2018thread\u2019 he\u2019d made while establishing a prana supply connection\u2014</p><p>Instantly, his world turned upside down.</p><p>His existence was instantly fused with it. He was overcome by a comfortable feeling like when one is about to fall asleep, and the sensation continued infinitely. He was engulfed by something soft, and kept sinking without end\u2014down, down, down.</p><p>Any malice, no matter how strong, would vanish here.</p><p>Any desire to kill, no matter how great, would be useless in the face of this.</p><p>This entire space, filled with happiness, peace, pleasure, order and purity all mixed together, felt like sweet milk dripping over his entire body.</p><p>His brain\u2019s functions halted.</p><p>His brain\u2019s functions became unnecessary.</p><p>Thought and instinct are unneeded. So melt away. Melt away and become one with it, until you\u2019re reduced to mere sweet, formless milk\u2014</p><p>\u201C\u2026You\u2019re in my way.\u201D</p><p>Shirou rejected that supreme pleasure with extreme ease. He scrunched his face at the great pain that ran through his arms, but he felt relieved at the same time.</p><p>Shirou had touched this several times while linking with the Grail to connect the prana supply. He had clearly understood from those brief touches that he would likely become unable to think of anything and merely dissolve into it if he plunged his entire body into it. To prevent that, he\u2019d made his arms feel pain. The reproduced pain came from the despair which he\u2019d experienced in the past\u2014and his black rage which sought to overcome it.</p><p>Shirou Kotomine couldn\u2019t forgive humans. He couldn\u2019t forgive human evil, nor human goodness either. It\u2019s precisely because humans possessing contradicting aspects of good and evil, greed and compassion, that they continue to exist as beings that repeat an endless spiral.</p><p>\u2026He couldn\u2019t forgive that. As long as he had that rage and pain, Shirou could withstand even such comfortable pleasure. The interior of the Greater Grail was still swirling with enormous amounts of prana undyed by anything.</p><p>To maintain his \u2018self\u2019 while inside the Greater Grail was the first trial.</p><p>Images of various scenes whirled around Shirou like a revolving lantern. It reminded Shirou of a fast-forwarded film.</p><p>The images appeared to show the history of the Einzberns. Their origins went back two thousand years, and the start of their quest began one thousand years ago. They were a clan that had repeated a trial-and-error process of every possible method for the sake of their dream of completing the Holy Grail.</p><p>They glorified every gruesome sacrifice they made and flung off every setback. Simply calling it \u2018obsession\u2019 wasn\u2019t sufficient; in fact, their struggles could even be likened to the journey of a saint.</p><p>Endless days without joy, of only battling with despair head on. The span of one thousand years made it seem like madness, but in truth it was merely a simple repetition of the same process.</p><p>Trial and failure, setback and restart. Even though it wasn\u2019t even clear whether they were moving forward or backwards, they just relentlessly continued to walk on.</p><p>Shirou honestly felt respect for them at the sight\u2014and smiled wryly at the same time.</p><p>Receiving sympathy from someone like him who wasn\u2019t even a member of the Einzberns was merely a bother for them.</p><p>Even more so since he was the culprit who had stolen their Greater Grail.</p><p>It\u2019s true that the sight of their history was moving\u2014but that\u2019s all it was, nothing more and nothing less. He remained silent until the fast-forwarded film ended.</p><p>A pale light engulfed the world once more. If he let his attention slip, he would dissolve in it, so he had to keep affirming his own existence every second.</p><p>There was no real direction here. Ahead laid the origin point of the Greater Grail. As he reinforced his strong determination to reach there, he began to walk.</p><p>Normally, the Greater Grail activated by using the Lesser Grail as fuel after it had absorbed the souls of Heroic Spirits. Once activated, the Greater Grail would create energy from it. Seven Servants were needed to fully activate it\u2014but no Servants souls were absorbed into the current Lesser Grail yet.</p><p>The Lesser Grail, which had a hole gouged into it, was sealed in a small room within the gardens, where the concept of \u2018up and down\u2019 didn\u2019t exist, and was continuously leaking out prana. No matter how many times the souls of Servant entered it, they would keep leaking out from the hole. But the leaked souls were unable to follow gravity in the room, and so they continued to be absorbed into the Lesser Grail and leak out again from the hole in an endless cycle.</p><p>Currently, Saber of Black, Lancer of Black, Berserker of Black, Caster of Black, Assassin of Black and Berserker of Red had all been killed, so the Greater Grail would automatically activate using the Lesser Grail as fuel after one more Servant was killed. This setup with the Lesser Grail was meant to prevent that.</p><p>If the Lesser Grail was destroyed, the Greater Grail might sense the abnormality and malfunction in some way. But if Shirou left it to operate normally, the Greater Grail would activate before he could finish changing its system.</p><p>Even he wouldn\u2019t be able to touch the Greater Grail once it fully activated. He couldn\u2019t let it activate\u2014not yet, at least.</p><p>Shirou Kotomine wasn\u2019t a magus. But still, he\u2019d had sixty years to work on his objective. At this point, he was pretty much as knowledgeable as possible on the Holy Grail War and the magecraft connected to it.</p><p>With what he\u2019d learned, he had to agree that the Greater Grail truly was the ultimate wish-granting device whose almighty power reached God\u2019s domain. Its system, having been designed minutely and elaborately to an abnormally high degree, definitely had the power to grant any Master\u2019s wish\u2014and even reach the ****.</p><p>But no matter how enormous, divine and almighty it was, what lay at the core of this Greater Grail was a single woman.</p><p>Her name was Justeaze Lizrich von Einzbern. The head of the Einzberns who had become the nucleus of the Greater Grail.</p><p>The Saint of Winter who had sacrificed her own life and given up everything for the sake of realizing a miracle (Sorcery)\u2014that was Shirou Kotomine\u2019s goal and destination. She held all of the grail\u2019s functions under her control.</p><p>There are stories of weapons that were made by sacrificing human lives, enchanted into true cursed swords by throwing a maiden into the hot molten iron.</p><p>But the Greater Grail was different from those. The Justeaze wasn\u2019t sacrificed to the Greater Grail. First, Justeaze existed, and then she became the Greater Grail.</p><p>Yes. The Greater Grail was both an almighty wish-granting device and also a giant pipeline (Magic Circuits) for the sake of reproducing the lost miracle of the Einzberns.</p><p>Normally, three things were necessary for a magus to perform magecraft. A spell foundation, Magic Circuits and prana. A spell foundation was the foundational system needed for any form of magecraft. Magi produced prana through the inner pathways known as Magic Circuits and performed spells based on a specific foundation.</p><p>And it was no different from the Greater Grail. This enormous Holy Grail was basically a cluster of Magic Circuits, and it could produce any miracle by using prana it absorbed from leylines.</p><p>The title almighty wish-granting device wasn\u2019t just for show. The Greater Grail was a meticulously-made and extremely precise device that contained an enormous store of prana worthy of being called \u2018almighty\u2019.</p><p>But Amakusa Shirou Tokisada knew. The Greater Grail was impartial. Justeaze\u2019s personality was already gone\u2014only her Magic Circuits still lived.</p><p>No matter what wish it was asked from the outside, the Holy Grail would grant it all. Then, if Shirou asked it to \u2018save humanity\u2019 from outside of it, would the Greater Grail bring about that salvation?</p><p>\u2014Of course, the answer is no.</p><p>The Greater Grail can\u2019t do what\u2019s impossible. That\u2019s why Shirou was risking his very life to invade the Greater Grail. He had a wish that was impossible for even the Greater Grail\u2014in that case, he merely had to overwrite its system from the inside and forcefully make the Greater Grail grant it.</p><p>He was attempting to adjust and reprogram the Greater Grail itself, something that would never be allowed in a normal Holy Grail War.</p><p>If it wouldn\u2019t grant his wish, then the Holy Grail was the one that was mistaken. So he would merely correct it.</p><p>Shirou walked towards what he had long sought\u2014which surely lay beyond this expanse.</p><hr><p>Several hours had already passed since Shirou had dived into the Greater Grail. He would probably require an even more considerable amount of time to complete his task. The Greater Grail was a work of art on the level of the divine, and Shirou was trying to modify it from its very foundation. There was no way he would finish quickly.</p><p>For the time being, Caster had returned to his study and resumed writing. It was then that he received a telepathic message from Assassin of Red.</p><p>\u201CCaster, has Master already dived in?\u201D</p><p>\u201CYes. Have there been any changes to his prana?\u201D</p><p>\u201CNo. There\u2019ve been no changes to the prana being supplied to us and the prana accumulating in the Hanging Gardens from him. I suppose this means that, even if the interior of the Greater Grail is another world entirely, the Line connecting Master and Servant can\u2019t be severed so easily.\u201D</p><p>Shirou had been most concerned about the moment he dived into the Greater Grail.</p><p>If his link to the rest of the world was cut off, everything would immediately fall apart.</p><p>\u201CIn that case, I shall continue with my writing.\u201D</p><p>\u201CWait, Caster\u2026 There\u2019s one thing I want to ask you. Is the end that you wish for my Master glory, or failure?\u201D</p><p>Caster just barely managed to stop himself from doing a spit take at those words.</p><p>\u201CGlory, of course.\u201D</p><p>\u201CI know, but I\u2019m making sure just in case. If things go wrong and this plan is setback because of you, I\u2019ll have you take responsibility\u2014quite painfully so.\u201D</p><p>\u201CO Empress, have no fear. Our Master took precautions against that just earlier with a Command Spell. To my bitter disappointment\u2026 Ah, no, I of course didn\u2019t have any intention of writing a tragedy from the start, though!\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2026Hmph. As if I could trust the words of a clown like you. Listen well, Caster. Your value as a writer lies only in the books you write. And the moment I judge that your books are not beneficial to us, I will lose any reason to keep you alive.\u201D</p><p>Caster felt as if he\u2019d been captured by a viscous carnivorous plant\u2014though of course he kept that thought to himself.</p><p>If he said the wrong answer, he would be melted and digested in an instant. Assassin of Red was most likely the most skilled Servant in terms of cruelty in the Great Holy Grail War.</p><p>From what Caster saw, Assassin of Red was likely always evaluating whether to stealthily kill anyone and everyone in this world, including even her own Master. Even if someone had no killing intent and only the slightest ill will towards her\u2014if she judged from their every word and attitude that they would cause harm to her, she would unhesitantly move to assassinate them.</p><p>This was the greatest reason why Rider and Archer kept their distance from Assassin. Of course, the fact that she was a figure of authority with the position of empress was part of it, but more importantly, she was always planning to kill them from the start. Telling them to get along with her was the height of difficulty.</p><p>That\u2019s why the two of them detested her. The neutral Lancer should have noticed the empress\u2019 nature as well. However, he merely thought \u2018That\u2019s just how she is\u2019 and accepted it without reproach.</p><p>And to Caster, it was only natural that she be that way.</p><p>She was an empress who reigned far above others. She definitely wasn\u2019t a weakling, but she was better described as a person of undisputable and absolute authority than a strong warrior. And as a woman who had tricked and deceived everyone throughout her life, it was only self-evident that she wouldn\u2019t let her guard down even the slightest bit in the presence of others.</p><p>\u201CI\u2019d like to fervently advocate my existential worth as a court jester. I assure you that, while my books and writings are always imperfect, that is precisely what makes them beautiful stories.\u201D</p><p>\u201CImperfect? Not perfect?\u201D</p><p>\u201CThat is only natural, O Empress of Assyria. A perfect existence, a perfect human being, and a perfect story constructed through only order and logic\u2014are completely shitty and boring! [My salad days, when I was greenin judgement, cold in blood!] My stories are imperfect and therefore beautiful, are imperfect and therefore genuinely entertaining. Failures means death? I don\u2019t mind! There\u2019s a chance of failure, and we will have to pay the price if that happens! And that\u2019s precisely why I can rouse myself to excitement and write a masterpiece.\u201D</p><p>\u201CEnough! Even through telepathy, your voice is loud and grating! I\u2019ll repeat myself one more time: failure is not allowed. Make sure to write Shirou\u2019s\u2014Amakusa Shirou Tokisada\u2019s story right until the end.\u201D</p><p>Caster coolly smiled at those words, and chose that moment to pose a question he\u2019d wanted to ask for a while now.</p><p>After all, their Master wasn\u2019t present right now. This was his best chance to hear her true feelings.</p><p>\u201CThen allow me to ask you in return. O Empress, which do you want? Would you rather our Master\u2019s dearest wish be realized, or would you enjoy trampling over his wish more?\u201D</p><p>\u2014For a brief instant, Assassin\u2019s breathing stopped as she was caught completely off guard by the question.</p><p>\u201CThe realization of his wish, obviously. A Servant serves their Master, after all.\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2026My, my.\u201D</p><p>Though silent, Assassin was clearly dissatisfied by Caster\u2019s response.</p><p>He was definitely the weakest of the remaining Servants that currently survived, and yet he feared no one.</p><p>\u201CSuch a perfunctory answer! Assassin, I\u2019m asking if you want to see his destruction or not. Now, answer me!\u201D</p><p>Pierced by the Caster\u2019s words, Assassin realized that this was actually a serious question for a clown like him.</p><p>In that case, she also had to answer sincerely as an empress. If she spoke falsely, that would make her an even worse fool than a clown.</p><p>There were no retainers of hers present, so she had no choice but to reveal her true feelings. But, strangely enough, that seemed like an act of tremendous courage to her. But she had no one to rely on. Caster wouldn\u2019t overlook her answer if she tried fawning upon him.</p><p>Focusing her nerves like never before, Assassin stripped away her many layers of falsehood\u2014and spoke the truth.</p><p>\u201C\u2014I won\u2019t deny that part of me wants to see him fail. I\u2019m a woman who has no interest in virtue and generosity and enjoys the destruction and despair of others, after all. I\u2019ve seen kings proud of their power fall into unsightliness and brave generals despair and run away in fear. But I\u2019ve yet to see the despair of a saint. So I will admit that I want to see it.\u201D</p><p>Assassin chuckled. Caster urged her to continue by remaining silent. A clown sometimes had to be patient and listen to a king\u2019s words.</p><p>\u201CBut there\u2019s something else I want to see. The scene that that man wishes to witness from the bottom of his heart. The salvation of humanity. A possibility that no one seriously considers, and that even heroes and saints have given up on. The same goes for me too. As someone who stands above others, I have witnessed various things, like untimely death, dazzling beauty, ugliness, pure integrity\u2014but that is the one thing I have never seen. It might be boring. It\u2019s possible that it might be a dull and dreary ending. But\u2014I\u2019ll never know unless I see it first.\u201D</p><p>\u201CI see. In other words, you mean to say that you want to see that ending not out of loyalty to your Master, but out of pure curiosity.\u201D</p><p>\u201CExactly. Of course, I also have my own wish to \u2018rule\u2019. But, more than anything else\u2014right now, I\u2019m looking forwarding to seeing how far that man will go.\u201D</p><p>Just like a child playing with a toy\u2014Caster just barely stopped himself from saying that out loud. Most likely, he\u2019d be killed if he did.</p><p>\u201CIt seems you were about to say something insolent, but you did well to hold back for a man like you. As a reward for your silence, I\u2019ll forgive you.\u201D</p><p>Suddenly, Caster felt like a line was cut in his mind as Assassin closed the telepathic communication. But it was then that Caster remembered that he\u2019d forgotten to ask one last question.</p><p>\u201CWhat a blunder. I should have asked her if I could add in the love story of an empress. Now then, what to do\u2014well, I\u2019ll just write it anyway. This will be well-received by readers, for sure.\u201D</p><p>Shakespeare took out a paper from his breast pocket and scribbled a note on it.</p><p>The empress fell in love.</p><p>And thus, he went to resume writing the main plot.</p><p>Since he was linked to Amakusa Shirou Tokisada as a Servant, he was able to record what happened around Shirou and Shirou\u2019s own mental state in great detail with his Master\u2019s permission.</p><p>This meant that his Master\u2019s thoughts and feelings were all laid bare to him, something a normal Master would never allow.</p><p>\u2014And of course, Shirou Kotomine was far from ordinary.</p><p>Shakespeare was indisputably the most famous playwright in the world. Anyone who made him their Servant would be forced to make the ultimate choice.</p><p>Would they allow him to write down their story, encompassing their thoughts, habits and entire life, or not?</p><p>If they allowed it, Shakespeare would recount and extol their extraordinary life as far as his voice could carry.</p><p>And that story would sublimate into a Noble Phantasm. Shakespeare\u2019s pen could affect even events and phenomena, no matter how absurd or preposterous it may be. The only thing he couldn\u2019t write were uninteresting events. If he believed something was interesting as a writer, fate itself would be overturned to make it happen.</p><p>He wrote, wrote, and wrote.</p><p>Amakusa Shirou Tokisada was encountering various hardships and trials within the Greater Grail.</p><p>His dead father, his dead mother, and the comrades who had sworn to stand by his side.</p><p>All of them were appealing to him.</p><p>Take up a sword in your hand and use it. We have that right. You have the responsibility to avenge us\u2014</p><p>Even while beset by anguish, he continued onward.</p><p>Then, if his comrades failed, what about his enemies?</p><p>The ones who had violated, trampled and thoroughly disgraced his comrades while laughing, manifestations of this world\u2019s malignant cancer. They were more than enough to make someone give up and despair at humans.</p><p>In the face of them, Amakusa Shirou\u2014</p><p>\u201C\u2026Hmm!?\u201D</p><p>Caster stopped his pen at the sudden tremor that rocked the gardens. The time was midnight. For a sudden tremor to occur in this situation\u2014there could only be one reason.</p><p>\u201CSo you\u2019ve come, holy maiden!\u201D</p><p>Heartily laughing, Caster stood up and ran out of his study.</p><p>\u201CIt\u2019s a battle against time now. But our Master is ignoring sleep and hurrying to speed up time as much as possible. Even if they make it in time, we\u2019re protected by invincible swords and indomitable shields, and are encased in fortress as hard as a diamond. Now, what shall happen next!?\u201D</p><hr><p>At almost exactly the same time, Assassin of Red opened her eyes as she sat upon her throne.</p><p>\u201C\u2014Hmm, so they\u2019ve come.\u201D</p><p>She\u2019d anticipated the enemies to come eventually, but they were slightly later than she\u2019d predicted. Did their preparations take more time than expected, or was there another reason for their late arrival?</p><p>Either way, it didn\u2019t change what had to be done.</p><p>\u201CArcher, Rider\u2026 They\u2019ve arrived. Intercept them. I don\u2019t know what means of flight they used to get here, but there\u2019s nothing that can withstand your attacks. Rider, crush them with your flying chariot.\u201D</p><p>\u201CAh, I plan to, but it\u2019ll probably take some time to take them all down.\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2026What? Did they use such a large-scale spell?\u201D</p><p>\u201CYou\u2019ll understand if you see.\u201D</p><p>Assassin projected an image of the outside world onto the throne room\u2019s ceiling\u2014and was dumbfounded by what she saw.</p><p>\u201CWhat is this\u2014\u2014?\u201D</p><p>From the knowledge she\u2019d been given by the Holy Grail, Assassin knew what an airplane was. A mechanical bird that petty humans had put together somehow or other to fly through the sky.</p><p>They were heading towards the gardens using that. That much was fine. It was a far more rational choice than using an enchanted tool that could go malfunction. But\u2014there were far, far too many of them.</p><p>There were a total of ten large jumbo jets, approaching the Hanging Gardens like a flock of ravens. The prana signatures coming from them were vague and ambiguous, making it impossible to precisely detect who and what was on each plane.</p><p>And furthermore\u2014</p><p>\u201CThose damn Black Servants\u2026!!\u201D</p><p>Archer of Black was standing on the roof of one of the planes. His preparations for battle were already complete and he was searching through the surrounding skies with eyes that overlooked nothing.</p><p>Rider of Black was riding on top of the plane next to Archer\u2019s. He was atop his hippogriff, with the homunculus who was his new Master sitting behind him.</p><p>And standing atop the center plane was the arbitrator of the Great Holy Grail War and the absolute enemy of the Red camp. The young woman who was acknowledged as a true saint and who opposed the young man who never managed to become a saint.</p><p>Class Ruler\u2014Jeanne d\u2019Arc.</p><p>\u201CRelying on pure numbers\u2026 Hmph, what a foolish plan. But that\u2019s precisely what makes it hard to deal with.\u201D</p><p>The ten planes were approaching fast, so close they were almost on the verge of colliding with the Hanging Gardens. But conversely, felling one plane wouldn\u2019t be enough to destroy their foothold. With Archer and Ruler\u2019s physical abilities, they could jump to the next plane before the one they stood on fell.</p><p>\u201CHowever\u2026 even that\u2019s not enough to approach my Hanging Gardens.\u201D</p><p>It was true that Assassin would have some difficulty dealing with this. But that was all. She could destroy all those lumps of iron merely by activating the garden\u2019s defense functions.</p><p>However\u2014that wouldn\u2019t be tasteful. Proudly displaying her great power was soothing in its own way, but the other heroes of the Red camp wouldn\u2019t agree to just slaughtering the enemy like that.</p><p>\u201CRider. I don\u2019t intend to attack until the enemy reaches a certain distance near the gardens. However\u2014\u201D</p><p>\u201CHey, Miss Empress, is that supposed to mean that I\u2019ll also get caught in the crossfire if I get close too?\u201D</p><p>\u201CPrecisely. Does that dissatisfy you?\u201D Assassin of Red replied calmly.</p><p>Rider of Red happily accepted that provocation.</p><p>\u201CNo, no problem at all\u2026 I\u2019ll kill Archer of Black, and while I\u2019m at it, I\u2019ll take apart those flying pieces of scrap iron too.\u201D</p><p>Rider\u2019s voice, like that of a ferocious beast, caused a chill to run down Assassin\u2019s back.</p><p>A demi-god born from a hero and a goddess, the great hero of the Trojan War\u2014but if you peeled those titles away, he was actually a monster who devoted everything to battle.</p><p>\u201CVery well, I\u2019ll leave it to you.\u201D</p><p>However, that was an indispensable component for a hero. Cruelty, arrogance and a sense of pride that asserted that one\u2019s strength was absolute were what made heroes truly heroes.</p><p>\u201CArcher. I\u2019ll leave the rear support to you. Make sure to shoot down each one of those planes.\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2026No. I\u2019m going to kill that annoying girl first.\u201D</p><p>Archer of Red\u2019s voice sounded as if it rang out from the very depths of the earth. Rider\u2019s voice had been that of a beast excited in a blazing frenzy, filled with only joy\u2014the pure delight at fighting someone strong.</p><p>But Archer of Red\u2019s voice was different. It was clearly filled with hatred, decisively different from the cruel cheerfulness that most heroes possessed.</p><p>\u201C\u2014What?\u201D</p><p>It was only natural that Assassin furrowed her brow suspiciously. From her point of view, Archer of Red was the type of hero who was easy to understand.</p><p>She enjoyed fighting the strong, had no dislike for battle in and of itself, and had no interest in good and evil or government. She treasured invisible things like honor and pride\u2014</p><p>If she hated someone, it would only be the killer of her loved ones. However Ruler\u2014the holy maiden of Orleans, Jeanne d\u2019Arc\u2014was far from being a person who would do such a thing. In the first place, Archer of Red shouldn\u2019t have had anyone she cared about enough to love in this world.</p><p>\u201CI\u2019ll kill that woman! I have to kill that filthy murderer who pretends to be a saint. Don\u2019t get in my way, Assassin\u2026!\u201D</p><p>And yet\u2014Archer\u2019s voice was filled with rage.</p><p>Assassin understood. This kind of hatred couldn\u2019t be controlled. It was the kind that took precedence over anything, most likely making Archer deem not only the Red camp but even her own life meaningless in comparison.</p><p>Such hatred always caused chaos on the battlefield. Of course, if she could successfully defeat Ruler, then it wasn\u2019t a problem.</p><p>However\u2014</p><p>\u201CLet her be, Miss Empress. Either way, my own opponent remains Archer of Black.\u201D</p><p>Rider interjected into the telepathic conversation. Just as he said, Rider\u2019s pride made him desire to fight his former teacher.</p><p>\u201C\u2026Very well. Rider of Black likely intends to try and invade the gardens with that meager monster of his. I\u2019ll take care of him.\u201D</p><p>In her eyes, Rider of Black was no more a threat than a fly.</p><p>\u201CLancer, you are to remain on standby until any of them manage to board. I\u2019m busy with controlling the gardens, and it goes without saying that Caster cannot be relied upon. You\u2019re entrusted with the final defense line.\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2014Understood.\u201D</p><p>Hearing that quiet reply made Assassin feel relieved. Even if one of the three Red Servants in charge of intercepting the enemy were defeated in the worst case scenario, as long as he was here\u2014the enemy wouldn\u2019t be able to take even a single step near the Greater Grail.</p><p>\u201CIn that case\u2014slaughter them. The Greater Grail is ours!!\u201D</p><p>\u201CAye!\u201D Rider and Archer replied affirmatively.</p><p>The Black camp would win this battle if they reached the gardens.</p><p>And the Red camp would win if they prevented them from reaching the gardens.</p><p>Amakusa Shirou Tokisada aimed to save humanity, while Jeanne d\u2019Arc was trying to prevent him from doing so. The final battle between the two sides began in a magnificent manner at the dead of night, seven thousand and five hundred meters above the Black Sea.</p><hr><p>The holy flag in her hands fluttered violently in the fierce and piercingly cold wind. The young woman stood majestically atop one of the planes.</p><p>The superb view around her was a hell in the sky where ordinary humans couldn\u2019t exist.</p><p>Most likely, the prana from the Hanging Gardens was interfering and causing the planes to slow down the more they approached, with their current velocity now at a mere three hundred kilometers an hour. However, it was still fast enough that any human would be immediately blown off by the violent headwind. But as a Servant, Ruler was able to concentrate prana into her feet to remain firmly standing on the airplane\u2019s roof.</p><p>She was filled with maddening worry, but for this moment alone she concentrated on only what was in front of her. Both now and in the past, her duty was to be the flag bearer\u2014to receive all attacks onto herself.</p><p>That was her contract (curse). As long as she stood holding this flag, she wouldn\u2019t lose to any hero from any time or place.</p><p>Saber.</p><p>Archer.</p><p>Lancer.</p><p>Rider.</p><p>Berserker.</p><p>Caster.</p><p>Assassin.</p><p>Not conforming to any of these seven classes, she was the aloof, absolute arbitrator.</p><p>Ruler\u2014Jeanne d\u2019Arc\u2014stood at the vanguard just as she had in her first life.</p><p>In the sky at high altitudes that surpassed human reach, the Black camp at last caught sight of the Hanging Gardens of Babylon.</p><p>\u201C\u2014I see it!\u201D</p><p>\u201CYes, me too.\u201D</p><p>\u201CI can see it too! Wow, it\u2019s an amazing sight no matter how many times I see it!\u201D</p><p>Inwardly, Ruler agreed with Rider of Black.</p><p>Assassin of Red\u2019s Hanging Gardens could be best described as a huge, gold-shining birdcage. Seeing it fly through the sky was a wondrous sight straight out of fantasy.</p><p>And that birdcage was protected by not only the Red Servants, but also eleven pure black plates over twenty meters in length floating around the gardens, the Tiamutomu Umu: Eleven Black Coffins which had shot Rider of Black down to the ground before.</p><p>In contrast, Ruler and the others were riding giant birds of steel flying straight towards the Hanging Gardens at full speed. Fortunately, the trajectory of the planes was extremely stable. Strangely enough, despite having been so nervous inside the plane, Ruler was now the height of calm as she stood on its roof.</p><p>It appeared that her basis of fear lay with whether or not she could see the outside scenery.</p><p>Ah, how truly like a bumpkin country girl\u2014She even had the composure to think such foolish jokes.</p><p>But it was about time for the laughter and smiles to end. What waited ahead was every form of despair that none could laugh at. And that was precisely why she was smiling now while she could.</p><p>She smiled humorously as she thought of Rider of Black, she smiled pleasantly at the charming relationship between Archer of Black and his Master, she smiled in admiration at the courage of Fiore\u2019s younger brother\u2014and lastly, she wore a different smile as she thought of him.</p><p>Then, she suddenly stopped smiling.</p><p>Her gazes narrowed and turned grim. With her holy flag raised in one hand, she shouted out boldly and loudly.</p><p>\u201CAmakusa Shirou Tokisada\u2014!\u201D</p><p>Ruler yelled out his name\u2014but the one to respond was not him, but his Servant, Assassin of Red.</p><p>\u201CWhat an unsightly howl. My Master is busy accomplishing the \u2018salvation of humanity\u2019 with the Greater Grail. Come, you might still make it in time if you hurry, you know?\u201D</p><p>The telepathic communication forcefully rang through her mind, annoyingly loud.</p><p>But there was more important information there to be concerned with.</p><p>\u201C\u2026He seriously intends to save humanity?\u201D</p><p>In response to Ruler\u2019s question, Assassin snickered.</p><p>\u201CWho knows? Whatever the results of his actions are, it is no concern of mine. If you want to stop my Master, you\u2019ll have to reach him. Though\u2026 only if you manage to get past the Red Servants first!\u201D</p><p><img src="https://i3.lensdump.com/i/1sfxB5.jpg" alt=""></p><p><img src="https://i1.lensdump.com/i/1sfG8T.jpg" alt=""></p><p>Suddenly, an intense light flashed through the sky from the Hanging Gardens. That incredible torrent of prana\u2014it was the three-horse chariot ridden by Rider of Red, the steeds neighing as they soared through the sky.</p><p>\u201CCome, Archer of Black! It\u2019s the promised time. Let\u2019s enjoy ourselves!\u201D</p><p>Soaring through the dark sky in a zigzagging pattern like a huge snake, Rider of Red charged at Archer of Black\u2014!</p><p>Archer of Black\u2019s eyesight possessed clairvoyance that could accurately grasp everything even in the midst of a pitch black night, but it was next to impossible even for his eyes to follow Rider of Red\u2019s chariot. Whether it be strength, technique or speed, when one of these abilities in battle reached a level that far surpassed common sense, they became more than mere stat numbers\u2014they were pure \u2018weapons\u2019 in their own right.</p><p>In that regard, the speed of Rider of Red\u2019s chariot truly was a weapon.</p><p>It was impossible to avoid and impossible to defend against, and its charging power was tremendous. It was virtually perfect in both attack and defense\u2014one of the pinnacles of what heroes could accomplish.</p><p>Moreover, Rider\u2019s steeds weren\u2019t ordinary horses. Two were the immortal divine hoses Xanthus and Balius, given to him by the sea god Poseidon, and the third was Pedasos, the famous horse he obtained when capturing the city of Eetion.</p><p>The chariot\u2019s name was Troias Tragoidia: Tempestuous Immortal Chariot. It was a Noble Phantasm possessing divine speed that could overtake everything in this world.</p><p>Who could possibly stop this comet that soared across the sky at light speed? Any living being that touched it would be instantly turned into crimson paste. And the same applied even to giant whale-sized precision machines created by humans.</p><p>The chariot soared up and then dropped down towards one of the airplanes like a shooting star. Naturally, he was aiming for the plane Archer of Black was standing on.</p><p>\u201CI\u2019ve got you!!\u201D</p><p>Rider of Red\u2019s yell was filled with confidence. Just as he\u2019d said earlier, airplanes were mere scrap iron before him.</p><p>The unpleasant sound of metal tearing apart rang through the air. Its fuselage was pierced during impact and the two torn halves of the planes lost control and immediately fell toward the sea below.</p><p>Rider didn\u2019t even have to watch to know that it would crash against the sea and shatter into thousands of small pieces. But there was no sign of Archer of Black on the felled plane. Figuring he had moved to one of the other planes next to it, Rider temporarily stopped his chariot and looked around around\u2014but at that instant, one of his steeds neighed.</p><p>\u201CWhat\u2026!?\u201D</p><p>Rider reflexively turned around\u2014and he saw Archer of Black holding his bow ready and aiming straight at him. No, wrong. He had already fired an arrow!</p><p>It was virtually impossible to catch sight of an arrow shot on a night without moonlight and only the faint lights from the Hanging Gardens for illumination.</p><p>But Rider detected the swirl of prana and slight disturbance in the air, and he swiftly turned his head to the side.</p><p>Suddenly, the sound of grating teeth rang out\u2014Rider of Red smiled fearlessly. Even Archer of Black was left speechless by what he\u2019d done.</p><p>Rider had caught and crushed the arrow between his teeth. He had predicted that it was aimed for his forehead and, instead of avoiding it, stopped it head on.</p><p>\u201CSo there you are!!\u201D</p><p>Rider of Red whipped at his steeds and resumed charging his \u2018chariot\u2019 that was more like a jackhammer.</p><p>His acceleration pierced the sound barrier in a mere instant. He flew in a spiral and ascended\u2014and then did a sudden descent. The plane Archer of Black was standing on was crushed as if by a giant fist from the heavens.</p><p>Archer of Black ran and jumped off the crushed plane\u2014and simultaneously fired mores arrows as he did so. He shot three arrows in quick succession, all aimed straight at the nape Rider\u2019s neck as he halted midair for an instant.</p><p>But that wasn\u2019t enough to stop the chariot. There was no way it could be stopped.</p><p>\u2014Just try and stop me, Archer of Black. Right now, I\u2019m the indisputable fastest in the world!</p><p>The chariot charged as it cleaved through the darkness.</p><p>Archer of Black softly jumped onto another plane from the destroyed one, acting as if the dozens of meters between them and the whirling winds were nothing to him.</p><p>At the same time as he landed, he activated the program that had been installed in the piloting golem beforehand.</p><p>\u201CSpin.\u201D</p><p>Just as Rider of Red moved to chase after him, the whole plane performed a barrel roll. The reversed underside of the plane served as a shield that blocked Archer of Black from Rider\u2019s sight. Archer used that chance to stealthily move to another plane again.</p><p>The plane blocking Rider\u2019s vision ascended, but Rider didn\u2019t chase after it.</p><p>Achilles wasn\u2019t the type to keep falling for cheap tricks. He saw through it\u2014 Archer was no longer on the ascending plane and was now on another plane aiming at him!</p><p>Don\u2019t underestimate me. Rider of Red charged and crashed straight into the ascending plane\u2014a three hundred ton lump of metal. Archer of Black, who had drawn his bow in order to shoot Rider down along with the bait plane, was astonished at the sight.</p><p>It was one thing he Rider had merely pierced through the plane with his chariot. But\u2026 Archer couldn\u2019t believe that he was pushing the whole plane in front of him as he charged\u2026!</p><p>However, in reality, this now turned the plane into a huge shield that protected Rider from Archer\u2019s arrows, and he was trying to crash it into Archer\u2026!</p><p>Archer immediately leapt back while firing his nocked arrow. He used the enormous prana emitted by it as a form of propulsion, while the arrow itself simultaneously pierced through the plane with the force of a missile and destroyed it.</p><p>However, that didn\u2019t stop Rider of Red. He struck the wrecked pieces of the plane with his spear and even used punches and kicks to launch them as projectiles.</p><p>They were more like machine gun fire than pellets. Archer of Black was forced to retreat back even further.</p><p>\u2014Rider was certain that he was cornering Archer into a corner. His initial hesitation was gone now as well. The only thing that ruled his heart was the unimaginable joy of fighting the man he had once strived to match up to.</p><p>Rider wouldn\u2019t kill him. He would beat him. It was merely unavoidable that his opponent would die in the process. If he fought with all his strength and the result was the death of his enemy, then it couldn\u2019t be helped. His opponent was also surely excited at the prospect of beating him in return. They were fighting each other with everything they had. There was no room for sorrow there.</p><p>They ran, chased, shot and smashed. The great sage Chiron\u2014Archer of Black\u2014and the great hero Achilles\u2014Rider of Red. The two Servants \u2018used up\u2019 yet another two jumbo jets with no hesitation at all.</p><p>In just a few short minutes, six planes had already been destroyed. There were four left. At this rate, all the planes would be felled within several minutes, and the Black camp would be forced to retire from the Great Holy Grail War as a result.</p><p>Of course, Rider of Red was at full strength, and even if he was reluctant for their battle to end in such a boring manner, he would still accept it as something that couldn\u2019t be helped if it decided the battle.</p><p>Archer of Black didn\u2019t wish for such an ending. And he knew that Rider of Red was using all his strength and taking advantage of the situation as well.</p><p>And then\u2014at last, Archer\u2019s adjustments were completed.</p><hr><p>She\u2019s come.\u201D</p><p>\u201CThat hateful woman has come.\u201D</p><p>\u201CThat woman who killed those children has come.\u201D</p><p>Someone whispered those words. In response to that voice, Archer of Red grabbed her bow. She still hadn\u2019t realized that the whispers of the evil spirits had turned into her own words.</p><p>Low level evil spirits could only repeat the same whispers. They shouldn\u2019t have even have had the intelligence to change their words according to the situation.</p><p>So this was her own wish.</p><p>\u201CKill.\u201D</p><p>\u201CKill.\u201D</p><p>\u201CKill.\u201D</p><p>\u201CKill.\u201D</p><p>\u201CKill.\u201D \u201CKill.\u201D \u201CKill.\u201D \u201CKill.\u201D \u201CKill.\u201D \u201CKill.\u201D \u201CKill.\u201D \u201CKill.\u201D \u201CKill.\u201D \u201CKill.\u201D \u201CKill.\u201D \u201CKill.\u201D \u201CKill.\u201D \u201CKill.\u201D \u201CKill.\u201D \u201CKill.\u201D</p><p>\u201CKill\u2014\u201D</p><p>Archer of Red smiled gently at the whispers and kissed her blackened right arm.</p><p>\u201CDon\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll definitely kill that woman, that fraud of a saint.\u201D</p><p>Her killing intent had already become as sharp as a blade. Servants possessed strength and abilities that far surpassed humans, but at the same time, they were extremely human in nature.</p><p>Love strengthens people, and hatred grants even more power. Of course, both emotions could also lead to self-destruction at their most extreme\u2014but the power they granted was more than worth it to Archer of Red, even if it came at the price of her own destruction.</p><p>Atalanta laughed and knocked an arrow on her bow. Even in the pitch-black darkness of night, her eyes accurately locked onto Ruler.</p><p>Ruler was holding up her holy flag on top of an airplane in a fearless and majestic manner. Naturally, Assassin of Red activated the defense functions of the Hanging Gardens in response.</p><p>A barrage of EX rank of orbs of light was fired from the black plates in quick succession. Each one was as devastating as a meteor falling from the sky. Its pure destructive power which carved through the sky was worthy of being called [Anti-Army].</p><p>\u2014However, to put it another way, it was merely an interception spell that \u201Chad no merits besides its destructive power\u201D.</p><p>Ruler swung her flag at the flood of light orbs\u2014and just that was enough to make the concentrated prana disperse. Her EX rank Magic Resistance skill was part of it, but as expected Ruler\u2019s worst ability lay in that holy flag.</p><p>As long as the holy maiden continues to swing her flag, we will know no defeat.</p><p>The pure and simple faith of the soldiers who had followed her. That faith had spread across the world along with Jeanne d\u2019Arc\u2019s fame and had taken form as a Noble Phantasm unique to the holy maiden.</p><p>It didn\u2019t matter that the length of her history was shallow compared to Rider, Archer and Assassin of Red. Jeanne d\u2019Arc was a saint who was, without exaggeration, known by everyone in the world.</p><p>In that case, the flag she now held was capable of brushing aside any and all harm no matter where she was.</p><p>Archer of Red figured that Assassin of Red was surely furious right now. After all, even if the Hanging Gardens was \u2018vain\u2019, it was still her pride.</p><p>An unrivaled and invincible floating fortress that could crush all enemies. Heroes could win against a chariot. They could win against a flying horse, or maybe even a dragon.</p><p>But they couldn\u2019t win against a fortress. In the first place, the terms \u2018victory\u2019 and \u2018defeat\u2019 were meaningless in the face of a fortress.</p><p>A fortress was something to be invaded and interception attacks were meant to be dodged; smashing an interception attack head-on shouldn\u2019t be possible.</p><p>\u201CHow annoying\u2026!!\u201D</p><p>In concert with that angry shout, more blasts of light danced hysterically through the air. They were completely in Archer of Red\u2019s way. The barrage wasn\u2019t pointless, but it was too wasteful.</p><p>\u2026However, though it was wasteful, it wasn\u2019t pointless.</p><p>Ruler was a top-class Servant, but she wasn\u2019t all powerful. Even without her Command Spells, she exceeded the average Servant, but she still had her limits.</p><p>That was why Ruler had chosen to run away back when she first confronted Shirou Kotomine. Even excluding Archer and Rider of Red whose allegiance hadn\u2019t been decided back then, if Shirou attacked her in concert with Lancer, Assassin and the yet-unseen Caster of Red, it was extremely likely she would have lost even if she used her Command Spells.</p><p>Even her holy flag Noble Phantasm wasn\u2019t invincible.</p><p>Archer of Red could see that, while it was very gradual, her flag was starting to crack and tear. It was likely the cost of preventing all attacks from coming near her.</p><p>Jeanne d\u2019Arc wasn\u2019t invincible in her legend. Though there had been various tricks and evil schemes involved, she had been turned into a prisoner at the end of her life.</p><p>In that case, Archer would keep firing arrows until Ruler\u2019s body could no longer endure it and she finally died.</p><p>\u201C\u2014Here I come, Ruler. I\u2019ll feed your corpse to the bears.\u201D</p><p>She drew back the bowstring and concentrated an enormous amount of prana into the arrowhead. Her beast eyes precisely grasped the instant when Ruler looked at her.</p><p>She released her fingers\u2014and the arrow instantly shot out with the arrow gushing huge waves of prana. It looked just like a swift, hungry wolf attacking its prey.</p><p>A direct hit from that would wound Lancer of Red, who boasted the greatest physical defense in the Greater Holy Grail War.</p><p>However, Ruler\u2019s holy flag expertly crushed the arrow in a swing so fast it looked like a flash and used the momentum to repel some of Assassin of Red\u2019s spell blasts while she was at it. She likely had consciously chosen the direction to scatter the blasts in, as the plane beneath her remained unharmed at least.</p><p>However, there was no way Archer of Red\u2019s attack would finish with just a single shot. The instant after she fired the arrow, she nocked another one and filled it with prana.</p><p>\u201CSecond and third shots ready. Set\u2014Subjugate, Twin Stars.\u201D</p><p>She fired two arrows at the same time. If the previous shot was like a wolf, these twin shots, whose trajectories Archer freely controlled with prana, attacked Ruler just like wriggling, poisonous snakes\u2014!</p><p>There\u2019s nothing she can do to defend, thought the ultimate huntress.</p><p>There\u2019s one thing I can do to defend, thought the arbitrator.</p><p>There were two enchanted arrows coming at her, and more light orbs had been fired from the Hanging Garden\u2019s defense mechanism Tiamutomu Umu as well.</p><p>At this point, it was impossible for Ruler to take conscious action. It was impossible to calculate which of the two arrows were flying at her faster.</p><p>Therefore, she partly cut off her thoughts and simply followed her instincts.</p><p>She swung her holy flag in a side sweep\u2014and she repelled the light orbs which were shot from a shorter distance. However, now she couldn\u2019t block the arrows which were falling straight at her from above.</p><p>However, even if she couldn\u2019t block them, she could guide the course of events.</p><p>\u201CWhat\u2014!?\u201D</p><p>It was only natural for Archer of Red to be shocked. Her arrows, which she was certain couldn\u2019t be avoided, had been intercepted by light orbs from the gardens.</p><p>Immediately after Ruler had intercepted the light orbs, she\u2019d shifted direction and reflected them above her head. It was an unsightly display of intersecting fire by allies\u2014Archer of Red became enraged.</p><p>\u201CAaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaarrrrrrr!\u201D</p><p>With that roar, Archer jumped out. Her fastest sprint using her divine feet, which no one had ever been able to catch up to during her lifetime, resembled the running of a beast with her body bent forward at an extreme angle.</p><p>In a single breath, Archer of Red crossed a vast distance that was impossible for humans to cross even with all their diligent research and training. At her approach, Ruler held her flag ready\u2014and the two of them glared at each other.</p><p>\u201CI\u2019m going, to kill you.\u201D</p><p>That repulsive, hate-filled voice belonged to Archer of Red.</p><p>\u201C\u2014Unfortunately, that\u2019s impossible.\u201D</p><p>And Ruler replied with a great solemnness, as if to stamp out that hatred.</p><p>This was how the fight between the two female Servants began.</p><hr><p>\u201CYou have your back to the wall now, Archer of Black!\u201D</p><p>As Rider of Red\u2019s booming words echoed through the sky, Archer of Black smiled coolly and shot an arrow. However, Rider\u2019s chariot closed in on Archer faster than the arrow could reach him.</p><p>From the start, it was a battle Archer had no chance of winning. There was no way a bowman who had to fight at long range could stand up to a mounted warrior who could close the distance between them to point blank range in an instant.</p><p>\u2014However, Archer of Black wasn\u2019t a bowman who was limited to fighting at long range.</p><p>Even if one possessed the fastest speed, there was a drawback that accompanied it.</p><p>\u201CThe proper time, the proper coordinates, and the proper speed\u2014those are the only things I need.\u201D</p><p>Archer knew the speed of his arrows.</p><p>He could calculate the time it took to reach its target.</p><p>And he could predict the coordinates it would pass through.</p><p>Then, if he could figure out the speed of the chariot as well, the rest would be simple. No matter how overwhelming fast the enemy was, he just had to fire his arrow before Rider moved.</p><p>This was a form of future sight, but it wasn\u2019t a particularly special skill. It was simply a technique naturally gained from accumulated training over time without being discouraged by setbacks and thorough calculation that predicted what would happen next.</p><p>\u201CWhat\u2014!?\u201D</p><p>However, from Rider of Red\u2019s perspective, it was just as if the arrow had suddenly appeared before his eyes. Right after Archer had shot the previous arrow, he\u2019d shot another arrow at the coordinates Rider would definitely pass through. It truly was a nightmarish situation for Rider.</p><p>The arrow hadn\u2019t been fired after Rider moved.</p><p>Rather, Rider had moved to the coordinates that the arrow passed through\u2014</p><p>There was no way for him to dodge. It was as if Rider had moved to stand in the bull\u2019s eye himself.</p><p>Blood gushed out as the arrow pierced his shoulder. The arrow penetrated down to his bone.</p><p>\u201CTch\u2026!!\u201D</p><p>Rider of Red pulled out the arrow and glared at Archer of Black, who had already swiftly moved to a different plane. He steered his horses to chase after him\u2014and immediately after, the head of his horse Pedasos jolted.</p><p>\u201CWhat!?\u201D</p><p>Two of Rider\u2019s three steeds were immortal divine horses. However the third one\u2014Pedasos\u2014was a famous horse who was legendary for his swift feet, but was not immortal. A single arrow had pierced Pedasos\u2019 head, where his spiritual core was located. Even if the horse was a Noble Phantasm, this killing blow forced him to vanish and die.</p><p>Gritting his teeth, Rider of Red glared at Archer of Black.</p><p>His options were limited now. If he continued to destroy the airplanes with his now two-steed chariot, he could easily force the enemies to withdraw. Most likely, Rider of Black alone would remain with his hippogriff, but Archer of Red could probably shoot him down without much trouble.</p><p>However\u2014this was only if Rider of Red was able to destroy all the planes.</p><p>His actions were anticipated. After the battles in the open field, in the forest and now in the air, Archer of Black could predict what he would do with virtually perfect accuracy.</p><p>That presented a much bigger problem. However\u2014was it really best to discard this current situation in the air that was overwhelmingly advantageous for him?</p><p>As his thoughts pondered over his options in the span of an instant, his instincts as a warrior whispered to him.</p><p>You don\u2019t need to ride your chariot. You\u2019re a warrior stronger than anyone else.</p><p>\u201C\u2014Xanthus, Balius. You\u2019ve done enough. Leave.\u201D</p><p>He lightly tapped the heads of his horses. The horse called Xanthus turned to face his master and opened his mouth.</p><p>\u201CThat\u2019s a wide decision, my master. If you continue to fly through the air in this chariot, you will eventually end up facing the same fate as back then.\u201D</p><p>Xanthus had been given the ability to understand and even speak human language by a certain goddess. However\u2014</p><p>\u201CHmph. Then you mean to say that what I\u2019m about to do is the right choice?\u201D</p><p>\u201CWho knows? I don\u2019t know such things. I only know which choice will lead to your death if you do nothing.\u201D</p><p>However, his personality was completely rotten.</p><p>As Xanthus let out a laughing neigh, Rider hit him with the butt end of his spear. After letting out a shriek, Xanthus vanished along with Balius in a clearly exaggerated manner. And that was it. Having discarded his overwhelming advantage in the air, Rider of Red jumped down to the plane where Archer of Black was with only his spear in hand.</p><p>The jumbo jet was at an altitude that would make any normal human lose consciousness, but the two heroes stood on it unperturbed as they finally faced each other directly for the second time in this war.</p><p>The two Servants slowly began to walk over the steel roof to approach each other. Then, Rider of Red let out a hearty laugh that seemed to blow away the wind itself and asked a question.</p><p>\u201CNow then. Did you already predict that I would come stand here, sensei? Or is this outside of your calculations?\u201D</p><p>In response, Archer of Black smiled calmly. However, he already had an arrow nocked on his bow. If Rider tried to leap at him, he would instantly sense it and shoot the arrow. Meanwhile, Rider was waiting for an opening to attack. Depending on the situation, he would leap forward in an instant.</p><p>They were at a stalemate\u2014but it wouldn\u2019t last long. There was no way they would be able to hold themselves back from the feast before their eyes after they had waited so long for this moment. Keeping his ferocious and eager fangs at bay for the time being, Rider of Red waited for the answer to his question.</p><p>Archer of Black spoke up.</p><p>\u201CHmm, who knows? Though I did think it might come to this.\u201D</p><p>\u201CIf possible, I hope that this was outside your calculations. I\u2019m tired of having my path decided by the gods. This time, it doesn\u2019t matter whether my side is right or not. I\u2019m fighting because I want to fight.\u201D</p><p>\u201CSo that\u2019s why you sided with Shirou Kotomine\u2026 no, Amakusa Shirou Tokisada? And chose to help accomplish that absurd, delusional dream?\u201D</p><p>Archer of Black\u2019s gaze was stern. Amakusa Shirou had spoken of the pipe dream of \u2018saving humanity\u2019\u2014and yet Rider had overlooked the absurdity of it and chosen to help him. Before he had his showdown with Rider of Red, Archer had to question him on this matter at least as his teacher.</p><p>But Rider refuted his words in a firm tone.</p><p>\u201CIt\u2019s true that it\u2019s an absurd dream. But it can be done. At the very least, we were convinced so after hearing our Master\u2019s explanation.\u201D</p><p>\u201CDon\u2019t be foolish. Something like saving humanity\u2014\u201D</p><p>\u201CWith his method, it\u2019s possible\u2026 It really is a plan that\u2019s worthy of the word \u2018salvation\u2019. He doesn\u2019t intend to annihilate humanity, select the chosen from the unchosen, or destroy anything. It truly is a method you\u2019d expect from a saint.\u201D</p><p>Unlike his usual calm attitude, Archer\u2019s voice turn heated.</p><p>\u201CThere\u2019s no way such a method exists! It\u2019s something many sages, heroes and saints have continued to search for and piled up various thoughts and actions to achieve without any success! Even if he\u2019s a saint, Amakusa Shirou Tokisada shouldn\u2019t be able to achieve it either!\u201D</p><p>Rider of Red waved his spear and pointed straight at the Hanging Gardens.</p><p>\u201CIt\u2019s possible\u2014using the Fuyuki Greater Grail, sensei.\u201D</p><p>When summoned to this world, each Servant had been granted some general knowledge about the Holy Grail besides common knowledge about the current era. Archer of Black in particular had managed to figure out the Greater Grail\u2019s original purpose with his great discernment.</p><p>Using his vast knowledge, Archer dissected Rider\u2019s words, connected the information and constructed a conclusion.</p><p>The Holy Grail War, and its origin and source.</p><p>The three familiars who had created the Holy Grail, the Einzberns, Tohsaka and Makiri. Their true objective.</p><p>The Greater Grail\u2026 and its true power.</p><p>Seven Servants, and the true meaning behind that number.</p><p>And the five Outsiders who still existed even in the modern era\u2014</p><p>Archer turned speechless.</p><p>Everything led to one conclusion. It was impossible. Impossible, but\u2026</p><p>That might actually bring about the salvation of humanity</p><p>\u201C\u2026It, can\u2019t be\u2026\u201D</p><p>Archer of Black involuntarily let those words slip out\u2014while Rider of Red laughed.</p><hr><p>Perhaps swimming would be a better analogy for what he was doing than walking. In any case, Shirou Kotomine determinedly advanced while feeling as if his skin was being peeled off and his flesh was meting away.</p><p>This place wasn\u2019t within the Hanging Gardens. The interior of the Greater Grail was a space separate from the real world. Physical laws, the laws of magecraft and even himself were mixed and churned together to form something else entirely.</p><p>However, his arms hurt to the point of grating\u2014that alone allowed him to maintain his awareness of himself as Amakusa Shirou Tokisada. Shirou felt relieved that he\u2019d been right to connect to the Greater Grail beforehand for the sake of obtaining the Grail\u2019s prana supply. If he had plunged into this abnormal space with no countermeasures, he would have dissolved away in an instant.</p><p>His arms continued to cry out in pain. But that pain was what connected his sense of self to reality.</p><p>The world was still filled with pain and anguish.</p><p>To indulge in pleasure all by himself was truly the act of a fool.</p><p>Shirou Kotomine desperately focused on maintaining his self-awareness. He remained conscious of the fact that he was within the Greater Grail, which had no sense of place or direction, and kept walking towards the other side of this space.</p><p>By establishing a landmark, a path was created. Shirou believed that that path would lead to his destination.</p><p>The path was long and far, with no end in sight.</p><p>He felt like he could hear whispers that kept saying \u201CGive up and break\u201D\u2014but he withstood the temptation. In the end, it didn\u2019t matter whether you were a Servant or human in this place.</p><p>Even if he had all the power possible for a human to possess, it made no difference. Even if he could cut through dimensions and jump across space, there was no way to progress down this path except by walking.</p><p>And merely walking\u2014wasn\u2019t enough either.</p><p>He was the one who determined the destination, and he was also the one who determined where the goal was.</p><p>He believed he would definitely reach it, and he had a wish that he would definitely accomplish, so he walked.</p><p>It was an extraordinary distance. A distance that might even be infinite. And there was even the fear that he might be walking in the opposite direction without realizing it.</p><p>But he threw all those feelings away like garbage.</p><p>\u201CI\u2019ll walk, no matter where the destination may be, and no matter how long it takes.\u201D</p><p>He took one step. He took a second step. He took a third step without hesitation. He didn\u2019t care if he had to walk a hundred thousand leagues, walk up a ninety degree slope, or walk a path of thorns.</p><p>He had already resolved himself for all that long ago.</p><p>His father, mother, older sister and his massacred thirty-seven thousand followers tried to stop him.</p><p>\u201CListen to us,\u201D they said. Their voices called out to Shirou from behind.</p><p>\u2014You\u2019ll feel a bit better if you stop. So stop. And please listen to us.</p><p>He rejected those words of sympathy. He denied the invitation to halt and come to a standstill. He blocked his hears so as not to hear them.</p><p>He had assumed that such voices temptation would bombard him. If I waver here, your deaths will be for nothing. With that thought, he shook them off.</p><p>There was no way that it wasn\u2019t painful and sorrowful for him.</p><p>Next, in place of the massacred behind him, their killers appeared before him. The strong who devoured the weak countless times throughout history. Using the shaky reason that we and they are different, they continued to kill other people.</p><p>They whispered to him with faint smiles.</p><p>\u201CWhat\u2019s wrong? We killed them, you know? Your father, mother, comrades; we killed, killed and killed them all. Don\u2019t you hate us?\u201D</p><p>The people behind him shouted out in sorrow and anger.</p><p>\u201CThey killed us. So please, kill them in retribution! Avenge us so that our souls can rest!\u201D</p><p>Shirou remained silent. He didn\u2019t open his clenched fists. If he did\u2014he felt like he would spit out something at the same time.</p><p>Of course he hated them. Of course he felt anger. He wanted to rip those smiles off their faces, stop their breathing and crush their hearts.</p><p>But\u2014he had thrown away his sorrow and rage. He had decided that he wouldn\u2019t fight to give peace to the souls of his comrades, but to save everything instead.</p><p>He had thrown away forgiveness, compassion and love!</p><p>\u201CYou\u2019re in my way!\u201D</p><p>His heart hurt as if it was being torn out. From the bottom of his heart, he wanted to hate himself for lending a hand to evil despite not being dyed in evil himself.</p><p>Even so. He wouldn\u2019t change his decision. The dice couldn\u2019t be taken back after being thrown.</p><p>There exists a method to save everything in this world. So I want you all to believe in me. It doesn\u2019t matter whether you\u2019re enemy or ally. Let\u2019s all head to that paradise which should lay beyond the horizon.</p><p>\u2026However, he needed its power in order to save everything.</p><p>As long as humans remained the way they currently were, saving them was impossible. If ten people constructed a world, at least two people would be expelled from that world. A world made by ten people couldn\u2019t support all ten people.</p><p>By sacrificing two, eight received happiness. And that was the minimum limit; in reality, there were even times when nine people went through a path of hardship for the sake of one person\u2019s happiness.</p><p>This was the system of the human world, which should continue unchanged for eternity.</p><p>He was going to destroy that system. He would save the two sacrifices and the eight happy people alike. He would save both the one happy person and the nine people who struggled through hardship. In order to embark towards the heavens, a special power, a miracle was needed. And that is\u2014</p><p>\u201CThat is the Cup of Heaven\u2014Heaven\u2019s Feel. The final and ultimate Mystery for universally saving all of humanity. In other words, the Third Sorcery.\u201D</p><p>Shirou Kotomine at last laid hands upon humanity\u2019s salvation.</p><h2 id="afterword" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#afterword" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Afterword</h2><h3 id="nasu-kinoko" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#nasu-kinoko" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Nasu Kinoko</h3><hr><p>At last, the war has reached the final battleground\u2014seven thousand five hundred meters midair above the ground, a place that can\u2019t be reached by human hands.</p><p>The blue sky that encompasses their entire field of vision is endless, and the unseen, far-off ground exemplifies the limits of the human world.</p><p>There in the sky is a perfect world unclouded by anything. In this pure domain still yet untouched by civilization, an offering of condensed human wishes is now being consecrated.</p><p>It is the cup filled with desire.</p><p>The final wish of the broken-hearted.</p><p>That which grants a single wish while accumulating the wishes of many.</p><p>That which produces the one and only correct answer.</p><p>\u2014No matter how much it is dyed in madness and despair.</p><p>A great war between fourteen Heroic Spirits. A multi-viewpoint, action-packed story centered around a Holy Grail War that surpasses the structure of the Holy Grail War. The [Fate: Hidashide-version], which went beyond a single Far East island country out into the world and which really feels like it went overboard in various ways, has finally reached its final volume.</p><p>While thinking that as long as Chiron-sensei and Semiramis-sama each got a happy end, I wouldn\u2019t even mind the obvious Laputa jokes, I awaited the final manuscripts, but then\u2014</p><p>\u201CKinoko. I told you it would be finished in four volumes. But that was a lie.\u201D</p><p>With those words, Higashide \u201CCommando\u201D Yuuichirou then rudely hung up the phone.</p><p>This was on a certain January day in 2014.</p><p>But Kinoko understood. I\u2019d already known it after looking at the plot a year earlier.</p><p>\u201CThat\u2019s why I told you that this wouldn\u2019t finish in four volumes!\u201D</p><p>But it\u2019s too late to complain now.</p><p>Actually, most readers probably thought the same themselves.</p><p>So this volume count was pretty much expected. There\u2019s no point in being surprised. If you\u2019re going to be surprised by something, let it be at the actual contents of the book.</p><p>Like at how that Servant who everyone expected to go on a killing spree with Maria the Ripper ended up going in a shocking direction, or how the idea for boarding the Gardens ended up being a method that goes too far even for Hollywood and makes you think \u2018Hey, do you know just how much money this would cost if this were a movie!?\u2019.</p><p>Just between you and me, many of the developments in this volume weren\u2019t even in the initial plot. Even Mr. Higashide Yuuichirou probably didn\u2019t predict during the plotting stage that the story would get so crazy and overblown.</p><p>Therefore, it was unavoidable that the volume count increased. After all, this is what they mean by the saying \u2018stories are alive\u2019. What lies ahead is an invisible domain that not even the narrator can imagine. A story that can\u2019t be predicted even by its god, the author. What a wonderful thing that is. Don\u2019t you think that\u2019s what makes this a Final (Dead) Coaster worthy of being an apocrypha that breaks all molds and conventions?</p><p>My acquaintance and relationship with Mr. Higashide Yuuichirou is actually quite long and deep.</p><p>It goes back fourteen years ago.</p><p>Right after TYPE-MOON had published the visual novel \u201CTsukihime\u201D, we first met and talked at Tokyo Big Site\u2019s western hall where lots of passion and excitement swirled. The doujinshi I received from him back then is still on my work shelf even now.</p><p>After that, Higashide Yuuichirou formally debuted with the PC game \u201CAyakashibito\u201D and displayed talent and passion that you wouldn\u2019t expect from a newcomer.</p><p>It fused Japanese romance with a shooting action game. It contained deep knowledge of horror films. It contained depictions of martial arts that left you on the edge of your seat. It had an extremely charming and fascinating relationship between teacher and student. It was a story of growing up and parting. It was a story with multiple character viewpoints that increased in depth the more you read through it. The game is hard to get a hold of these days, but it\u2019s been ported and spread by consumers, so I highly recommend you play it. It is the undiluted embodiment of Higashide Yuuichirou\u2019s writing at full speed. It is such a condensed piece of work that his strong and weak points practically squeak and grate against each other within it, truly a story that \u2018expresses the soul of the writer\u2019.</p><p>And after \u201CAyakashibito\u201D, Mr. Higashide Yuuichirou continued to make other games like \u201CBullet Butlers\u201D and \u201CEvolimit\u201D, and later moved on to work in the world of light novels.</p><p>I am both a fan of Higashide Yuuichirou and at the same time a producer who spreads the [Fate] brand, which has already grown beyond a single visual novel.</p><p>I want new blood. I want to see new possibilities. I couldn\u2019t help wanting to see what would happen to [Fate] by introducing Higashide Yuuichirou into the mix, and I entrusted him to write this apocrypha.</p><p>I\u2019m now reflecting on the results of that decision with the release of this fourth volume.</p><p>The different viewpoints and ways of life of two saints. The countless hells that exist in the real world and yet are ignored as if they were only natural. He recites their story while coldly depicting those grudges and lamentations.</p><p>I\u2019ll tell you now. There is no salvation in this hell, It\u2019s precisely because there is no salvation that this is hell, after all.</p><p>As those we have overlooked this, we mustn\u2019t turn our eyes away from this truth and reality.</p><p>What lies beyond it? What will it produce? \u2014And what meaning lies in it? We keep searching for those answers.</p><p>That is the story that only Higashide Yuuichirou can write, one that isn\u2019t [stay], [Zero] or [EXTRA].</p><p>While confined to the [Fate] universe, Higashide Yuuichirou\u2019s writing at last bared its fangs with this timing.</p><p>[Fate] is a story about both dreams and reality.</p><p>Those who were destroyed by reality within their dreams and ideals.</p><p>Those who drowned and wallowed in dreams and ideals within reality.</p><p>And those who sought for reality within the dream of the virtual world.</p><p>Though the order differed, all three stories were cameras that displayed those who \u201Cstood up once more after breaking\u201D\u2026 Well, the main goal of their plots was the \u201Cfulfillment of wishes that couldn\u2019t be granted\u201D, so naturally the protagonists all tasted failure and frustration.</p><p>The concept of not giving up or not being able to endure it and still holding out a hand even so; that is the starting point of [Fate].</p><p>Fate\u2014a tragic destiny. In order to defeat and smash that huge, heaving wave that is beyond the capabilities of humans to resist.</p><p>No matter how much [Fate/Apocrypha] has diverged from the history of [stay night], that aspect remains unchanged.</p><p>Look at the light of the battle flag which runs across the blue sky.</p><p>This is the story of two saints.</p><p>The march of the young man who carried salvation to the extreme in the present era, and of the young woman who ascertained the salvation of the present era.</p><p>This is the story of the flags they each believe in and the utopias they each seek.</p><p>The Greater Grail is about to activate. At last, the young man\u2019s dream will take form.</p><p>\u2014But will its final form be prosperity or vanity?</p>', 4026);
