It\u2019s one of the representative literary genres of medieval Japan.</p><p>[2]: Kuzury\u016B was an evil dragon who was offered human sacrifices to be appeased, similar to the Yamata no Orochi. But rather than being killed, it was tied to an underwater rock formation by a priest called Mankan, and ended up being worshiped as Kuzury\u016B Daimy\u014Djin. The legend also includes Mankan witnessing the dragon turn into a Dragon King and building a shrine for it.</p><p>[3]: A type of wrathful god in Buddhism. Its name literally means \u201Cdefender of Dharma (the Law)\u201D. In Japanese it\u2019s written<br> goh\u014D<br> \u8B77\u6CD5<br> to make a pun with<br> mah\u014D sh\u014Djo<br> \u9B54\u6CD5\u5C11\u5973<br> (magical girl).</p><p>[4]: \u767E\u82B1\u7E5A\u4E71\u30FB\u6211\u611B\u79F0. \u767E\u82B1\u7E5A\u4E71 can refer to either flowers blooming or a gathering of many beautiful women. At the same time, \u611B\u79F0 can be \u201Cnickname\u201D or \u201Cintimacy\u201D. I suppose that the message the NP\u2019s name tries to convey is something like a private harem, but the result is a bit awkward.</p><p>[5]: \u6C88\u9ED9 usually refers to simply being silent, but here it\u2019s more like being silent because you\u2019re dead.</p><p>[6]: \u65E6\u90A3 can be \u201Chusband\u201D or \u201Cmaster\u201D, as many of you know.</p><p>[7]: The parts in italic are said by Shuten. Wish there was a way to put the Kansai dialect in English.</p><p>[8]: An old way of calling Japan.</p><p>[9]: I guess they\u2019re simply referring to the gold offered to the kamuy?</p><p>[10]: This type of paragraphs full of commas are always difficult. I apologize if it\u2019s difficult to understand what it says.</p><p>[11]: They probably mentioned it in FGO (I\u2019m a NA pleb), but it\u2019s probably the dragon Sitonai killed.</p><p>[12]: Written as \u9B3C\u6551\u963F (Oni Rescue Shade). It reads the same as \u30AA\u30CB\u30AD\u30E5\u30FC\u30A2 (Onicure). Obvious reference to Precure, one of the most known magical girl anime.
