The one who inherited the authority of destruction from him is Arjuna Alter. In return, he was losing his humanity, but his naturally born heroic self somehow saved him from turning into a puppet.</p><p>The universe revolves and the\u300CThe Revolving Sword that Arbitrates the Great Dissolution (Mahapralaya)\u300Dis used in a world that\u2019s far into the future. For the sake of fulfilling that moment faster, Arjuna Alter was sent in, but-----</p><p>He ruled as the perfect God in the Indian Lostbelt. His original sense of self was destroyed, truly a Deus Ex Machina\u2026. He has reached the brink of becoming a concept that only reincarnates the world.</p><p>However, Arjuna\u2019s egoism was ruled by his humanity (that is wanting to win against someone, wanting to be someone who is great, to hate, to be angry at something) was left over and ironically it returned his humanity. This time, he wants to win against Karna, that kind of wish...desire, managed to return him into being a human. In the Indian Lostbelt, he went overboard after taking many Gods\u2019 Authorities and became a concept that won\u2019t tolerate even a slightest imperfection, but when he\u2019s summoned as a servant, he won\u2019t allow any wicked hostility to his Master and the calm nature that\u2019s originally held by Arjuna from Pan-Human History can also come out.</p><p>He doesn\u2019t perceive that beautiful things are beautiful and is a sentimentalist that marvels at things that are made\u300Cbeautiful\u300D.</p><p>You are not awarded by the heavens, value the things you earned yourself, cherish that joy.</p><p>Arjuna Alter isn\u2019t aware of that, but that in itself could be his most human side.</p><h2 id="standard-weapons" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#standard-weapons" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Standard Weapons</h2><p>His sword is his fundamental weapon, but he can emit energy waves in the form of a shining horse.</p><h2 id="related-characters" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#related-characters" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Related Characters</h2><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong></p><p>Arjuna Alter isn\u2019t just an inverse being, but someone that lost more than half his humanity because of Authorities.</p><p>Hence, he harbors longing for Arjuna.
