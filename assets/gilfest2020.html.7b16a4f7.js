It is that time of year once again!<br> I am proud to announce the fourth Nero Fest!</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Hehehe. Quite the jubilant reception, is it not,<br> Fujimaru? And who can blame them!</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Of course it is! This is a festival of Rome, by Rome, and for Rome! Why shouldn&#39;t I be excited!?</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> I have prepared plenty of prizes once again, and would like nothing better than for everyone to test their strengths against one another in fierce competition!</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Though it hardly need be said that I will be this year&#39;s victor! Yes, this is the year where all will sing my praises as Rome&#39;s greatest swordsman!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I see you&#39;re in a good mood, Your Imperial Majesty.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Of course! The mere fact that Olympia shall open its doors again is enough to content me!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> You don&#39;t mean...infinite Guts...?</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Heh heh heh. Some things are better left unsaid.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Nero Fest is getting a bit long in the tooth, so I thought it would be a good time to present myself in all my steamy goddesslike glory!</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Forget the Venus de Milo!<br> Now is the time for the Venus de Nero!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Senpaaai! Emperor Nerooo!<br> Excuse me, please let me through!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Phew, what a crowd. I&#39;m a little exhausted just from making my way here.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Still, it just goes to show what a great success Nero Fest has been, and how much everyone loves it. I think that&#39;s a wonderful thing.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Umu, you will have to forgive me for my overwhelming success! That aside, you look even more daring than usual today, Mash!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Thank you. Please watch me, Master.<br> I&#39;m going to do my very best again this year.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> My goal is to place at least in the top ten!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Only the top ten, Mash? Shouldn&#39;t you be aiming for first? You are Chaldea&#39;s signature Servant and all.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Not to mention that this year&#39;s Nero Fest prize is exceptional. Even more so than usual!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> So for my part, I was really hoping Fujimaru would be the one to take it home.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Morning, Da Vinci!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Morning! I&#39;m glad to see you haven&#39;t forgotten your manners!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> \u201CNever forget to properly greet someone,<br> no matter what&#39;s going on.\u201D</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Or at least that&#39;s what we&#39;ve been doing since the Incineration of Humanity.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> An exceptional prize...?</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Oh, come now, Da Vinci! Don&#39;t give the game away so early! Wait until my official announcement!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Oops, right, of course. So sorry about that.<br> It just slipped out.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Umu. It seems all the participating Servants have assembled.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Then we shall proceed to the Colosseum.<br> See you later, Fujimaru and Mash.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> We will be broadcasting the opening ceremony in the cafeteria via Sheba, so feel free to bask in its glory from here.</p><p><strong>Caligula:</strong><br> Yeeeaaahhh!<br> Neroooooo!</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Uncle!? It is too soon for you to be cheering for me yet!<br> I appreciate your enthusiasm, but please wait until the ceremony...</p><p><strong>Caligula:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Caligula:</strong></p><p>Yeeeaaahhh!<br> Empty treasury Neroooooo!</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> What do you take me for, some petty tyrant who used up all her nation&#39;s money!? I will admit I came close to that once, but I never went so far as to\u2013</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> ...Wait. Were you speaking of Rome&#39;s current treasury, Uncle!?</p><p><strong>Caligula:</strong><br> ...Heh.<br> (Smirking in agreement)</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> That cannot be right! All the money I have been saving over this past year was in that treasury!</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Along with the Holy Grail I had purchased from Da Vinci to present as this Nero Fest&#39;s grand prize!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> A Holy Grail!?<br> Your \u201Cexceptional prize\u201D is a Holy Grail!?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Yup. Every now and then, a Singularity comes along that ends up disappearing on its own.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> And when it does, it sometimes leaves a Holy Grail behind. They may not be the best-quality Grails, but they&#39;re still pure, crystallized magical energy.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> So when one of those low-quality Grails falls into our lap, it&#39;s my job to retrieve it, polish it, and make it into something usable.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Emperor Nero happened to find me fixing up the latest such Grail, and I agreed to let her have it at a fair price as long as she made it her grand prize\u2606</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You really are a genius...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Fair price? Do I even want to know how much QP you charged?</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> This will never do! We cannot have Nero Fest without a suitable prize! Uncle, who is the villain responsible for\u2013</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Wait! Sheba just turned on!<br> It&#39;s about to show us something...!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Hahahahaha! Greetings to you at this late hour of 3:00 a.m., my fellow Heroic Spirits!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Oh, wait, it&#39;s morning there, isn&#39;t it?<br> Hahahaha, forgive me. Just a little KoH humor.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> I have lost all sense of the various time zones here, as there is neither day or night in this city!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Truly, this is a glittering cityscape even at night, worthy even of me! Perhaps that tells you where I may be speaking of?</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Now then...I must first convey my apologies to the Saber in red regalia.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Fifth Emperor of Rome, all of the money you worked so hard to save...now belongs to me.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Caesar knows why. You should ask him.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Though of course, he is most likely long gone by now. Indeed, there are few things more frightening than being related to an unrepentant grifter.</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> \u201CYes, I admit that I am deep in debt, a not inconsiderable portion of which I owe to you.\u201D</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> \u201CBut here is how I see it: I am the embodiment of Rome; therefore, my debt is Rome&#39;s debt.\u201D</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> \u201CAccordingly, those affiliated with Rome are my family, and must stand in joint surety with me.\u201D</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> \u201CAnd as it happens, there is a magnificent vault right here filled with riches. Riches enough to repay my debt in full.\u201D</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Juuullliiiuuusss!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Heh. And so the contents of your vault are now mine. Unfortunate, but that is how it is.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> However! While I may pity you, I cannot commend you!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> A sporting spectacle for Servants to pit their skills against one another? A fourth Nero Fest? You fool!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> What were you thinking, using the same arena all four times!? And a decrepit relic as the Colosseum at that!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> If I were running this festival, I would ensure my contestants compete in the greatest arena in the world.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> For example...the pinnacle of entertainment,<br> right here in Manhattan!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> The Garden!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> He&#39;s in New York!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> And here I thought he was all about the good old days...</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> What!?<br> An all-weather stadium!?!?</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Hahaha, did you think I spent my time in that tropical resort merely idling the hours away? Of course not!<br> I have been planning this ever since that trip began!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Furthermore, I declare here and now, that it is THIS festival which will determine the strongest Servant!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> And so I have come to New York! The only place in the world suitable enough to act as the stage for this historic event.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> To all you Heroic Spirits watching this now, listen well!<br> I have opened a gate in Chaldea that will take you here!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Those among you who fancy yourselves the strongest of all Servants, come to New York and prove it.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Needless to say, this event will also consist of team battles. I await you here, atop this skyscraper!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Once you have defeated all the other challengers...</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> ...that is when I, the Golden Archer, the oldest King of Heroes in all humanity, shall pass my final judgment!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Furthermore, my full-time secretary, Moolah, has prepared a host of incredible prizes for you to win!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Fight hard, play hard, and challenge me for supremacy! Now is the time to prove that you are the strongest!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Hehehe... Hahaha...<br> Haaahahaha!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I can&#39;t believe it...<br> Gilgamesh took over Nero Fest!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> And, um... I&#39;m sorry, Emperor Nero...<br> I... I don&#39;t know what to say...</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> What to say... What to say...<br> What... What...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...(I have no idea what to say to her.)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Nero...?</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> What...an incredible idea!<br> You are right, accursed King of Heroes!</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> I have been clinging to my Colosseum like a fool! If there is a better stage to be found in the modern era, then that is what I shall use.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Flashy lights! Gleaming skyscrapers! Classy champagne flowing from bottle to glass in the very poshest of penthouses!</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Umu! Enemy though he may be, I must commend him on his decadence, his ostentatiousness, and his sheer wealth! That is what entertainment should be!</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> I will gladly accept his challenge!<br> Hear me, all you Heroic Spirits gathered around!</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Nero Fest may be no more,<br> but our festival itself remains unchanged!</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> This event shall henceforth be called...<br> Battle in New York 2020!</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> That arrogant King of Heroes clearly believes that HE is the strongest one of all! Let us show him how wrong he is!</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> We shall pummel him with the full force of our greatest Noble Phantasms and send him tumbling off his high perch!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Now that&#39;s the emperor we know!</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Umu! Just leave it all to me! To be frank,<br> I am looking forward to visiting New York myself!</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Hehe. Fujimaru, Mash.<br> This is where our competition truly begins.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Only one team will be able to challenge the King of Heroes. I cannot wait to see who emerges victorious!</p><h2 id="before-the-awards-ceremony" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#before-the-awards-ceremony" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Before the Awards Ceremony</h2><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> So this is where the finals will be held...<br> Huh? Emperor Nero?</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Mash and Fujimaru!?<br> What is going on here?</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Is this not the site of the final battle?<br> Has there been some kind of mistake!?</p><p><strong>B\uFF1A???:</strong><br> It is no mistake. I determined from the start that there would be two teams advancing to the finals.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> That sounded like...Gilgamesh!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> That sounded like...Gorgeous P!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Hahaha, I expected you would make your way here, mongrels! You have put on a most entertaining show!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> As your reward, I shall give you the opportunity to compete directly with your king. You will have a chance to bask in the honor as you fall to the ground.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> So you mean to take us all on at once? If that is what your pride as a king demands, I have no objections.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> But first... I know that my reserves alone could not possibly have sufficed to pay for this extravaganza.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> So tell me, just how much did you spend to put on this event?</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Heh. I would estimate it cost about three times what you had in Rome&#39;s treasury...but that isn&#39;t to say I had to spend much myself.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> One came up with a business deal to restore your treasury&#39;s funds. It succeeded brilliantly, so you now lay claim to several times what you did before.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> It is no wonder he is known as one of the Nine Worthies. His powers of elocution are no less effective in modern show business than they were in his own time.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> He must have been thinking harder about how to help Nero Fest succeed than you were.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Caesar... He certainly has his share of issues, but I guess he really was worried about you, in his own way.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Umu! That is all I needed to know.<br> Now we can focus entirely on our battle, King of Heroes!</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> This festival may belong to you now,<br> but I still have my own pride as an emperor!</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Besides, it is not the proprietor that is the star of the show, but the brave heroes who take part in it! Now, as the undisputed strongest of them all, I shall reclaim the Holy Grail that is rightfully mine!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Foolish emperor. That is exactly why I will be fighting you in this form. The King of Heroes has been the star of this show from the beginning, and the star I will remain to the end.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Unfortunately for you, I have grown tired of counting my money and playing the kind, understanding king.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> No, what I have in store for you is nothing less than hell itself! Your half-baked heroism will not be enough to defeat me!</p><p><strong>Gorgeous P:</strong><br> Hahaha, I expected you would make your way here, mongrels! You have put on a most entertaining show!</p><p><strong>Gorgeous P:</strong><br> As your reward, I shall give you the opportunity to compete directly with your king.

Once I hit the ground, that will be it for me!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> But don&#39;t let this go to your head, mongrels! Remember, I am the kindest of all my various permutations!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Next time, I shall return as an even more refined King of Heroes!

We...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> We did it, Master! I&#39;ve confirmed that the...um...New York King of Heroes has returned to Chaldea!</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Indeed he has! Victory is ours,<br> Fujimaru and Mash!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Congratulations, Nero!</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Umu. Umu, umu! Do not stop now!<br> Keep lavishing me with praise!</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Thank you for your support during battle,<br> and for leading us to victory!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> You did great, Mash!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Thank you, Master, but I didn&#39;t really do anything compared to you, and not just in this battle!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I could never have made it this far without your orders and support.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The King of Heroes was right! This was a team victory. And as our team&#39;s leader, you deserve the lion&#39;s share of the credit.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Oh... Look, Fujimaru.<br> That is the Holy Grail I prepared for this event.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> That accursed King of Heroes must have fitted it to his championship belt. But it should still work fine!</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Take it for yourself, Fujimaru.<br> I have no need of it.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> I am the one who secured it in the first place, after all, and it would be completely improper for an event&#39;s proprietor to go home with its grand prize.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> In that case, don&#39;t mind if I do.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Then I&#39;ll just use it on you.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> U-umu, I see.<br> How can I refuse such a kind offer...</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> (Perhaps it is due to my mother and that poison affair...but Holy Grails make me nervous...)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I&#39;ve retrieved the Holy Grail.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I wish we could stay and enjoy the nighttime view a little longer, but Da Vinci just asked us to head back to the arena immediately.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Umu, the victors have been determined! All that remains now is for them to stand atop the podium!</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> I am proud to call you my heroes, brave warriors!<br> Now, let us be off!</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> I declare that the Battle in New York 2020 has officially come to a triumphant end!</p>', 200);
