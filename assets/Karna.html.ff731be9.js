However, Karna assumes his problem is saying too much, when it\u2019s actually saying too little. Because he can\u2019t convey the part he was really supposed to, he is always hated at the end. Or the person assumes Karna hates them.</p><h2 id="attitude-towards-master" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#attitude-towards-master" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Attitude Towards Master</h2><p>There\u2019s no other Servant more loyal than him, but due to his aforementioned way of speaking, it\u2019s easy for him to be hated by the Master.<br> He apparently took an immense shock when a previous Master pointed out \u201CYou don\u2019t speak too much, you speak too little\u201D and is doing what he can to fix that. He has no wish for the Grail. He was simply summoned for his power and is here only to attend this call.</p><h2 id="dialogue-examples" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#dialogue-examples" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Dialogue Examples</h2><p>\u201CI was above you and that\u2019s all that is to it.

I see\u2026 I see.\u201D</p><h2 id="historical-character-and-figure" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#historical-character-and-figure" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Historical Character and Figure</h2><p>A great variety of characters appear in the ancient Indian epic Mahabharata, but the de facto protagonist is Arjuna.<br> And the greatest rival opposing Arjuna is him, Karna.<br> He is also Arjuna\u2019s half-brother on their mother\u2019s side and has the blood of the sun god.<br> With Arjuna as the protagonist, Karna should have inevitably fitted into a villain role, but instead he is portrayed in the Mahabharata\u2019s story as a tragedy hero and boasts immense popularity even in present day India as a hero that never stops fighting despite the constant torment of the caste system.</p><p>When Karna\u2019s mother Kunti took care of Sage Durvasa, he thanked her with a present: one Mantra. It allowed her to summon forth any god and bear a child of the gods. As a test, Kunti summons the sun god Surya and bears his child. A decision she comes to regret.<br> At the time, giving birth to a child before marriage was a huge problem, so the concerned Kunti discards Karna in a river.<br> Luckily enough, he is adopted by a charioteer couple and starts displaying remarkable martial arts talent as he grows up.<br> In a Kaurava conference, Arjuna, one of the 5 Pandava princes, showed transcendental archery skills.<br> The audience showered him with praise, with the only contrarian being Karna. Karna displays archery skills on par with Arjuna and goes as far as requesting a one-on-one duel. However, the 5 Pandava brothers respond asking \u201CWhat is your caste?\u201D. In order to challenge Arjuna, a prince, your caste needs to be at least Kshatriya (warrior) and Karna didn\u2019t qualify for that.<br> Luckily, Duryodhana, a dissenter of the Pandavas, takes a liking to Karna and ushers him into kinghood.<br> However, Karna\u2019s foster father appears there, exposing Karna\u2019s origins. He was the son of a charioteer.</p><p>Karna was indignant at the Pandava brothers for making his caste into laughingstock. He\u2019s always complete fine with himself being mocked, but they insulted his foster father.</p><p>Karna started to serve his new friend Duryodhana. Karna and Arjuna\u2019s mutual rivalry would deepen in the competition for Draupadi (who later became the wife of the Pandava brothers), until they finally settle who is on top on the Kurukshetra War. A war for territory breaks out between the 100 Kaurava princes (Duryodhana being one of them) and the 5 Pandava brothers.<br> At this time, a woman approaches Karna as he commands his army.<br> It was Kunti, the biological mother who birthed, then abandoned Karna. She confesses to him that she is his mother. The Pandava brothers are also sons of Kunti, therefore Arjuna is Karna\u2019s half-brother.<br> Although Karna rejected her wish for him to switch to the Pandava brothers\u2019 side, impressed by Kunti\u2019s courage to admit her shameful crime, he swore not to attack any brother other than Arjuna.<br> For that reason, Karna let the non-Arjuna Pandava brothers escape the battlefield alive multiple times.</p><p>Later, immediately before the final battle, Indra, the thunder god, appears before Karna.<br> Karna was under an oath to never reject a request from a Brahmin, so when asked for his golden armor and earrings (that is, his Noble Phantasm Kavacha &amp; Kundala), he peels away the items that were fused with his flesh. Impressed by his outstanding nobility, Indra grants Karna a single Divine Spear. The one and only Vasavi Shakti.<br> But even that wasn\u2019t a fair replacement for an armor that promised him de facto immortality. When Arjuna approached Karna in the final battle, he had no trace left of his former strength.<br> With one curse making his chariot\u2019s wheel get bogged down, another curse rendering unable to remember his weapons\u2019 True Names, and without his immortality, Karna no longer had any ways to avoid Arjuna\u2019s arrow.<br> But Arjuna wouldn\u2019t shoot.<br> Because before the war, both parties agreed upon a rule: it\u2019s forbidden to attack anyone who is no longer able to fight.<br> As long as his chariot was bogged, Arjuna was not allowed to shoot him.</p><p>\u201CIgnore this rule\u201D, whispers Arjuna\u2019s charioteer Krishna.<br> Arjuna listen to the devilish whispers and regrets it for the rest of his life.<br> Karna, on the other hand, is weirdly proud of the fact that a hero on Arjuna\u2019s level would go as far as breaking the rules to defeat him.<br> Karna and Arjuna drew their bows with all their might\u2026</p><p>And in the end, Arjuna\u2019s bow shot down the sun.</p><h2 id="related-characters" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#related-characters" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Related Characters</h2><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong></p><p>His half-brother, with enough connections of fate to him to fill entire books. One day we will be able to talk about one without talking about the other (or so we hope).</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong></p><p>He\u2019s very similar to his old friend Duryodhana.

I believe Karna-san is designed as a man who is hot for the modern Japanese standards but wasn\u2019t considered hot when he was alive.
