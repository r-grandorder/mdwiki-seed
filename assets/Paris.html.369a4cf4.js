This has been Kususaga Rin, delivering the boys with 300% more shota-ness. Good day. The concept for him was... a boy who looks like a girl but is most definitively a boy! I aimed to give him strikingly different outfits between Ascensions to portray three completely different species of cuteness, but all I did was work myself to death three times... But a shepherd boy ascending into a sheep (costume) is good civilization. I tried to make the Apollo with him into a Unquestionably Cute Mascot(tm), but later I played the game and found out he&#39;s a shitbag without a single good bone in his body. Wonderful. That threw his cuteness out of the window... It&#39;s amazing how you can feel the evil in his eyes... Also, after drawing Paris, I gained a reputation as the gender-unidentifiable character illustrator. It&#39;s a huge honor! I&#39;ll devote myself to drawing more than just piss[1]!
