All the numerous anecdotes surrounding Hektor strengthen Mandricardo\u2019s body, with the collective overwhelming legendary power of said anecdotes granting him Pseudo-Charisma.</p><p><strong>The End Strike: [C]</strong></p><p>On the verge of death, this skill enables Mandricardo to unleash an all-out strike. It is close to but not the same as Battle Continuation in the sense that he is guaranteed to perish after landing a strike.</p><p>The higher the rank, the greater the damage. At rank C, one full-power strike can be unleashed at just the right measure.</p><p><strong>Brigliadoro&#39;s Neigh: [A]</strong></p><p>This skill is the sublimation of the episode of Mandricardo stealing and riding the famed horse Brigliadoro. It increases his mobility, attack power, and reputation at the cost of making him an easy target for enemies.</p><p>To add, this skill allows him to steal and ride demonic beasts ranked C or lower.</p><h2 id="noble-phantasm-s" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#noble-phantasm-s" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Noble Phantasm(s)</h2><h1 id="serment-de-durendal-oath-to-never-bear-a-sword" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#serment-de-durendal-oath-to-never-bear-a-sword" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Serment de Durendal: Oath To Never Bear a Sword</h1><ul><li>Rank: A</li><li>Type: Anti-Personnel</li><li>Range: 1</li><li>Max.

Information regarding this Noble Phantasm is sealed and inaccessible even for his Master.</p><p>In the fifth Lostbelt, because Hektor gave him Durindana (Durendal) and because he was driven by his objective to save the friends he met on his journey, Mandricardo managed to activate this Noble Phantasm. He accomplished the miracle of thwarting Artemis\u2019 arrow. Following this feat, Mandricardo perished.</p><h1 id="character" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#character" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Character</h1><h2 id="pronouns" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#pronouns" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Pronouns</h2><ul><li>First Person: ore</li><li>Second Person: anta/omae</li><li>Third Person: kare/kanojo</li></ul><h2 id="personality" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#personality" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Personality</h2><p>A gloomy young man who has been exposed to the vanity of life.</p><p>Mandricardo is well aware of how minor a figure he is, hence the occasional self-deprecating remarks.

Shocked by this defeat, he has since become quite the gloomy, diffident character.</p><h2 id="attitude-towards-master" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#attitude-towards-master" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Attitude Towards Master</h2><p>He typically adapts a True Neutral attitude. He will step in and stop excessive acts of cruelty, but due to his background as a former knight and king, he will overlook most less-severe cases.</p><p>Mandricardo is not one to initiate conversation with his Master. This inclination comes from his lack of confidence and insignificant military fame\u2026which then produces misunderstanding since a mage Master would typically interpret this attitude as that of a Servant exercising tact.</p><ul><li>He is willing to follow orders that are a bit on the reckless side.</li><li>He is always reserved and never acts out of turn.</li><li>He is not one to engage in needless chatter even with enemies.</li></ul><p><em>Why, he makes the ideal Servant indeed.</em></p><p>\u201CA beginner friendly Servant?

At the end of his adventure, he acquired the shield and armor of Hektor.</p><p>Hektor\u2019s sword Durendal, however, remained in the hands of Roland, the very man who killed his father. Enraged, Mandricardo then set out wandering to find Roland.</p><p>After some twists and turns, Mandricardo eventually won both the legendary sword and the love of his life, but a duel with Ruggiero would cost him both Hektor\u2019s armor and his very life.</p><p>Although he may have been the enemy who triggered Roland\u2019s episode of going blind with rage and utterly naked, Mandricardo never played a part in the main plot of the narrative. While his brilliant feats were depicted in Orlando Innamorato, he was simply portrayed as one of the many obstacles standing in both Ruggiero\u2019s and Roland\u2019s way in Orlando Furioso.</p><h2 id="character-in-fgo" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#character-in-fgo" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Character in FGO</h2><p>He used to be a king and adventurer!</p><p>After obtaining Hektor\u2019s armor at the end of his adventure, he then set off on numerous journeys in high spirits! The quest for Durendal was one riddled with tireless fights and twists and turns. By the end of it all, Mandricardo had been exposed to the vanity of life. Treat him nicely\u2026</p><p>In his lifetime, he wreaked havoc with an attitude of self-importance and an air of supremacy. But this changed following his defeat in the hands of Ruggiero, Bradamante\u2019s lover. Having been slain by Ruggiero even with Hektor\u2019s armor and Durendal at his disposal appears to have left Mandricardo traumatized. He is now diffident when interacting with his Master.</p><p>Communication, a determining key factor in a Holy Grail War, fills him with dread\u2026 Yet for some reason he gets recommended as a beginner friendly Servant.</p><p>He does regain some confidence during battle, which is perhaps his way of lifting his ego.</p><h2 id="in-atlantis" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#in-atlantis" aria-hidden="true">#</a> In Atlantis</h2><p>Mandricardo was one of the Servants summoned in advance in Olympus. He fulfilled his missions solemnly and surely, albeit in an unexciting manner. The one who called him \u201Cbeginner friendly\u201D in a previous section [see Attitude Towards His Master] was a Servant who participated in the same mission as him.</p><p>Those summoned in advance eventually divided into two: one team of Servants would make their way to Olympus, ready to fight in do-or-die battles, while the other team would remain in Atlantis as they wait for an opportunity to turn the tides. Following an advice he received, Mandricardo decided to stay and wait for Chaldea. He would then meet somebody he could call a friend, an encounter made possible only in this Lostbelt.</p><p>Meetings and partings are all but fleeting occurrences. But without a doubt, this was a once-in-a-lifetime miracle\u2026 One so special you could devote your entire life into it and even then you\u2019ll never know if it will come true.</p><h2 id="extra-info-from-in-game-profile" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#extra-info-from-in-game-profile" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Extra Info from In-Game Profile</h2><p>(Usually Bond 6, or story clear bond, etc)</p><h2 id="standard-weapons" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#standard-weapons" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Standard Weapons</h2><p>Although his weapon of choice is a simple wooden sword, he can wield it to temporarily exhibit powers similar to that of Durendal\u2019s.</p><h2 id="related-characters" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#related-characters" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Related Characters</h2><p><strong>Atlantis Argonauts</strong></p><p>\u201CWhat?

With a wooden sword in his hand, he gave me the impression of an aggressive lone wolf. It didn\u2019t help that his eyes looked intimidating, too\u2026 Contrary to my initial expectations, he turned out to be friend shaped! My friend!!!! Adding comedic facial expressions made him even more animated. I am particularly fond of his uneven bangs!
