Master!<br> We&#39;re gonna go on an adventure!!!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...?<br> Astolfo? Where are you going?</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> To France!<br> I thought I&#39;d pay Roland a visit.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Um.<br> I don&#39;t think Roland is around in 1431...</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> It&#39;s okay! All we gotta do is wander around France,<br> and I&#39;m sure he&#39;ll get summoned one of these days!</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Now let&#39;s go, go, go!!!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> H-hey, don&#39;t be so pushy!</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Here...we...goooooo!!!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Senpai...Senpaaai!!!</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Sorry! I&#39;m lost!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Called it.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I kinda figured.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Master. If you knew this would happen,<br> you should have said something earlier.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I guess there&#39;s nothing to be done now. Fortunately, you have camping supplies, so I suggest you spend the night in the forest.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Yay!!! Camping! Camping!<br> Hey, do you have curry?</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Curry! Curry!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Um, if you&#39;re a Servant,<br> you don&#39;t need to eat...</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Ehhh?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> It&#39;s fine. Here you go.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Let&#39;s eat together.</p><hr><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Yay! Thank you Master!<br> Then make mine an extra large curry!</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> More! Mooore!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Here you go.</p><hr><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Thanks!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I think you&#39;re spoiling Astolfo too much, Senpai.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You think so?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I do.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Then I&#39;ll spoil you when we get back, Mash!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Eh? Me!?<br> Um...well...no...you mustn&#39;t...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Um, but if you insist,<br> I shall gratefully...</p><hr><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Master, Master! More!!!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Again!?</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Whew! I ate a lot!<br> I&#39;m stuffed!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Master. You are out of emergency rations.<br> You&#39;ll need to purchase food in town tomorrow...</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Okay, then I&#39;m going to sleep to prepare for tomorrow. Good night!</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> ...Zzzzzz.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That was fast, Master.<br> Astolfo just fell asleep in the middle of a sentence.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Just like a child.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Some kids act like that.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Is that true?<br> I&#39;ve never met any children like that in Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Oh, but I remembered something.<br> It was when I first met you, Senpai...</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Ahhh! What a refreshing morning!<br> ...Huh? What&#39;s wrong?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> N-nothing. I just didn&#39;t get enough sleep.<br> It&#39;s okay. It shouldn&#39;t affect us in combat.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Ahaha. Master, you look sleepy too.<br> Well, let&#39;s head off!</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Where could Roland be?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> In conditions like this, I sincerely doubt a Servant could be summoned easily...</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> I guess so...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Is Roland your lover?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Is Roland your boyfriend?</p><hr><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Roland?<br> Hahahaha! That&#39;s a riot!</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> That guy...he&#39;s no good, Master.<br> He&#39;s good-looking, but he&#39;s bad inside.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> ...No. That&#39;s not the word. He&#39;s not bad on the inside. Hmmm... To put it in today&#39;s terms, he&#39;s...disappointing?</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> No matter how good someone looks, you&#39;d still kinda judge &#39;em if they ran around town naked, right?</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Roland does that! Happily, even! It&#39;s practically a hobby! He&#39;ll just run around buck naked!</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> That&#39;s just the kinda guy he is,<br> so prolly not really \u201Clover\u201D material, y&#39;know?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...It&#39;s true. According to legend,<br> Roland stripped his clothes off, mad with grief.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> But I didn&#39;t think he really ran around...</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Ayup. That&#39;s cause after that, he&#39;d get naked every chance he had. Said he got hooked on it. Hooked!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Stripping?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Hooked?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> (Did he have a mental breakdown...?)</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Anyway, let&#39;s go look for some enemies.<br> My Astolfo-sense is telling me that fort looks suspicious!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Huh...<br> Astolfo is always so pushy...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> But if Roland ever joined us, I feel he would be a great asset. Let&#39;s do our best to find him.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Yep! He&#39;d for sure be dependable, you&#39;ve got the Astolfo guarantee on that! Other stuff...not so much.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It seems like Fou is also concerned...or at least that&#39;s what I&#39;m getting from that response.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> By the way, I&#39;m curious about something.<br> Hey, Mash.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes? What is it?</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Are you okay seeing naked men?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> !</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I-I-I-I...I suppose.<br> I&#39;ve never seen one, but I should be okay...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I-it is through the filter of a screen, too.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I-I-I-I think it should be okay. Yes. It&#39;ll be fine.<br> I have a little knowledge about those things.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I&#39;ll be fine. I&#39;ll be ready. As long as you let me mentally prepare, it&#39;ll be totally fine.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Oh, good!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes. Please rest assured...somewhat.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> ...Master. I&#39;m betting Mash will scream.<br> What about you?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I&#39;m all in for screaming.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> There&#39;s nothing to bet on.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I-I&#39;ll be fine! Totally!<br> I&#39;ll definitely probably be okay!</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> We&#39;ve arrived!<br> Hey, you guys there.</p><p><strong>Soldier:</strong><br> ...Hm? What?</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> You&#39;re looking kinda tired.<br> Everything okay?</p><p><strong>Soldier:</strong><br> ...It&#39;s complicated. This old man is considering quitting the soldiering life and go home...</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Really? Then, good work! Hey by the way,<br> did you see a naked handsome guy running around?</p><p><strong>Soldier:</strong><br> ...A naked...handsome guy?</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Yep!</p><p><strong>Soldier:</strong><br> A guy with a bright smile, but he looks a bit dumb,<br> but at the same is stupid strong...that handsome guy?</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Yep, that&#39;s the one.<br> We&#39;re looking for him!</p><p><strong>Soldier:</strong><br> I see...you&#39;re looking for him?<br> I see, I see. Hey, everyone!</p><p><strong>Soldier:</strong><br> Some friends of that naked jackass are here!<br> Get &#39;em!</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Eh...eh!?<br> Wh-what, why!?</p><p><strong>Soldier:</strong><br> No questions asked!<br> Cock-a-doodle-doo! Arrrf! Wooof!!!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> What exactly happened to anger those men so much!?<br> What did this Roland do!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> A-anyway, Astolfo!<br> We need to calm them down!</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> I know, I know! I&#39;ll give &#39;em what for and that&#39;ll calm &#39;em right down! Astolfo PUNCH!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Well...um, I can&#39;t argue with that... Anyway,<br> please strike with the flat of the blade, Master!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Soldier:</strong><br> Why you...I curse you for the nakedness...ungh.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Whew.<br> I worked up a good sweat.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Mine was cold sweat...</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Um, the first guys...yeah, this guy!<br> Hey! Are you okay?</p><p><strong>Soldier:</strong><br> Y-yeah... (Gasp) Wh-who the hell are you guys?<br> And why&#39;re you so strong?</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> So tell me. Roland...I mean the naked guy...do you know where he is?</p><p><strong>Soldier:</strong><br> He ran wild in that fort and then disappeared...<br> All we wanted to do was to put clothes on him...</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> That is...I can only say I&#39;m sorry.<br> I am pretty sure he didn&#39;t not mean to do any harm.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> You need to find him, Astolfo.</p><p><strong>Soldier:</strong><br> Oh, and when he jumped up, he pressed his crotch on my face... I&#39;m scarred...forever...</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Hey! You gotta say stuff like that earlier!<br> I put my face right next to yours!!!</p><p><strong>Soldier:</strong><br> Terrible...</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Don&#39;t cry!<br> Now I&#39;m getting sad, too!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Wanna go home?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Let&#39;s retreat.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> N-no. If Roland is out there, running amok,<br> then that&#39;s a problem we need to fix.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Let&#39;s at least resolve this problem.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Y-yeah. I&#39;ll do my best!<br> So please don&#39;t abandon me, Master!</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Hmmm...I haven&#39;t heard any screams...yet.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I&#39;m worried about how all these citizens have this thousand yard stare...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> They all look like they saw something no one should ever see.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> I&#39;m sure it&#39;s just a Demon King or something. Probably. Let&#39;s ask around.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I have a bad feeling about this...</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Hey, soldier. Mind answering a question?<br> See a naked guy running around the streets here?</p><p><strong>Soldier:</strong><br> ...Naked. Guy.<br> This. Road. Straight. Go.</p><p><strong>Soldier:</strong><br> I. Lead. Way. Follow. Me.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Really? Yay, a clue!<br> Let&#39;s go, Master!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Aren&#39;t you the least bit suspicious about what that man said!? W-wait just a moment!</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Hm. Hey soldier.<br> Where&#39;s the naked guy?</p><p><strong>Soldier:</strong><br> You. Friends. That. Guy.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> N-no, that&#39;s not...</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Um, technically I am.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Fou!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I&#39;m sorry! I couldn&#39;t help it! It just slipped out!<br> Fou, I&#39;m sorry!</p><p><strong>Soldier:</strong><br> Fufufu. This. Grudge. Must. Not. Ignore.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Uwaa! They&#39;re attacking!<br> What the heck? We were tricked!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Not tricked, really. I knew they would attack.<br> Of course they would!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Whew. We beat them.<br> They were so pale, I thought they were zombies!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> They seemed that way because of those dead fish eyes of theirs...</p><p><strong>Soldier:</strong><br> Ungh...<br> So what the heck was he...?</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> What did he do to you guys?</p><p><strong>Soldier:</strong><br> I scolded him because he was naked.<br> Then he got violent...</p><p><strong>Soldier:</strong><br> He even climbed onto the two hundred year old statue of our town&#39;s saint...and he mounted his head...</p><p><strong>Soldier:</strong><br> And he shouted<br> \u201CI&#39;m the king of the world!!!\u201D</p><p><strong>Soldier:</strong><br> The rest...was all a mess.<br> Then he ran off, laughing.</p><p><strong>Soldier:</strong><br> The kids cried...the women blushed but stared...I&#39;m starting to get really tired of living a proper life.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Please get a hold of yourself.<br> It&#39;s okay. Please live a proper life!</p><p><strong>Soldier:</strong><br> You think so? I feel like I&#39;m in an illusion and hallucination at the same time...</p><p><strong>Soldier:</strong><br> See? There&#39;s a little girl up ahead...</p><p><strong>Soldier:</strong><br> Oh, so it was an illusion.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Aw, c&#39;mon. A little hallucination now and then is no big deal! People get to keep on having fun after they lose their sense of reason, too!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> We absolutely need to stop this rampage!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Astolfo, we need to stop the perv\u2013I mean, Roland!</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Got it! ...Wait a minute.<br> I thought the plan was to get him to join us?</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Oh well!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> That&#39;s not good.</p><hr><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> He came through the city.<br> Where could he have gone?</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Oh, footprints!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I&#39;ll analyze them.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The print isn&#39;t from a shoe.<br> It&#39;s from a bare foot.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...There&#39;s only one person crazy enough to walk a wasteland barefoot...</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Roland! Okay!<br> Let&#39;s get to trackin&#39;!</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> I feel like we&#39;re playing a game of boy scouts! If Geronimo was here, he&#39;d give us some big fancy lecture about tracking and the land or...something...</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> &#39;Course, then I&#39;d forget it about a minute later!</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> The footprints continue this way... This way...<br> Turn this way... He climbed a tree...</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Stole a bird egg...<br> Ate it...</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Ouch!<br> I-I won&#39;t steal, okay!?</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Afterward, he wasn&#39;t satisfied with just one egg...<br> He wandered around...fought a wyvern..</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Then ate it...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> He ate it!?</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Raw, too.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Raw!?</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> And then afterward, he got food poisoning from eating the raw wyvern, and he threw up right here.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Master!<br> This is not encouraging!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Just a little bit further...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Y-yes. As your navigator,<br> I&#39;ll stick with you till the very end!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Keep at it.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Oh...Master&#39;s getting discouraged too.<br> A little more...let&#39;s stick to it a little bit more...!</p><hr><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> So...</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Theeen he stepped all over his own vomit,<br> then he staggered along...</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> And then he went to sleep sulking for just a bit.<br> Hey, do you think it feels nice, sleeping naked on the ground like that?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> This is like a strange geoglyph, isn&#39;t it?</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> But then...a wild horse came rushing toward him from the side...</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> And it kicked Roland&#39;s back.<br> Oh, his mouth&#39;s bleeding a little.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I have no more energy to comment on this.<br> Master, I leave the rest to you.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I don&#39;t want to do that!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I thought you were supposed to play the straight man!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> But...</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> And then Roland stood up.<br> He called for the horse&#39;s owner!</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> And then he got into an argument.<br> Roland was so angry...</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> He choked the owner and tossed him under this tree...</p><p><strong>Soldier:</strong><br> H-how irrational...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yet another victim.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> And then Roland mounted the horse...<br> Everything was going fine for a while...</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> But then he realized that riding a horse naked and bareback causes various areas to start hurting...and so he dismounted.</p><p><strong>H\uFF1AHorse:</strong><br> Neeeighhh.<br> Brrrgh.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> So it really does hurt?</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Why not try it yourself?<br> Naked.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Absolutely not.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> A shame. By the way, mister horse,<br> do you know where the naked guy who rode you went?</p><p><strong>H\uFF1AHorse:</strong><br> Neeeigh!</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> He said, \u201CFollow me.\u201D</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> So we&#39;re finally going to meet him.<br> Hnnn...my body&#39;s trembling...</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> ...There! There he is!</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> I finally found you, Roland!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Master, I&#39;m starting to get embarrassed!<br> I&#39;m not fine!</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> O-ooohhh...you are...are you by chance Astolfo?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Oh, oh! Clothes! He&#39;s wearing clothes!<br> I&#39;m so relieved!</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Yeah...yeah it&#39;s me, Roland! I&#39;m glad! I&#39;m glad I could pick you out because you&#39;re wearing clothes!</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> If you were naked, I probably wouldn&#39;t have recognized your face!</p><p><strong>Roland:</strong><br> Th-that cheerfully dumb child...<br> You really are Astolfo!</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Hey, it&#39;s been a while.<br> How&#39;ve you been?</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Oh, let me introduce you!<br> This is my Master.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Hello...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I heard so much about you from Astolfo.</p><hr><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> And this is Master&#39;s other Servant...she&#39;s a navigator for us now. Her name&#39;s Mash!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I&#39;m Mash Kyrielight.<br> I serve as a navigator for Master in Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> P-pleased to meet you.</p><p><strong>Roland:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Roland:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Master, Master.<br> He&#39;s looking at me.

The gentleman is waiting. Answer him.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> M-my apologies...<br> I&#39;m very sorry, but...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Men who like to be naked...are not really my...</p><p><strong>Roland:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Oh, he stood up. Hey, don&#39;t get discouraged just because you got rejected by a girl!</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Although...people fall for me all the time so I&#39;ve never been rejected!</p><p><strong>Roland:</strong><br> WHAAAAAA...!??</p><p><strong>Roland:</strong><br> If that&#39;s...how it is...then let&#39;s all die together!!!<br> Together!!!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Eh, together!?</p><p><strong>Roland:</strong><br> Yes! This will be like Romeo and Juliet!<br> Oh Romeo, Romeo, wherefore art thou Romeo!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Wrong role!</p><p><strong>Roland:</strong><br> Now, if you can hand me my Juliet, Master Romeo!</p><p><strong>Roland:</strong><br> Fufu...fufufu...fuhahahahaha!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Master! He is not Roland!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> To be clear, he&#39;s just lingering emotions Roland left behind...a remnant...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Anyway, he&#39;s a fake!<br> That&#39;s such a relief!</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Hmmm, so we&#39;re gonna have to fight, huh?<br> Well, if he&#39;s a fake, it can&#39;t be helped! (Nobbu!)</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Okay, Master!<br> I&#39;m going to win...for Mash&#39;s sake!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Got it.

THAT&#39;S your last wish!? Ahahaha! And that&#39;s why Roland&#39;s hilarious!</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> I bet even our king would laugh himself silly if he saw you!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> By king, you mean...?</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Charlemagne, of course! Now that I think about it...<br> I wonder why he hasn&#39;t been summoned yet either...</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Me, Roland, the king...<br> One day I&#39;d like to fight alongside them!</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Okay! Anyway, we saw Roland! Kinda! And once he gets summoned properly, we can see him again!</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> But my Astolfo sense tells me that if we meet,<br> it&#39;ll be in a REALLY dumb situation!</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Sorry for all the hassle, Master.<br> Now, let&#39;s go home!</p>', 329);
