Said to have protected the Shogun Hidetada by cutting down seven warriors in an instant during the siege of Osaka (1615 AD). After his death, the third Shogun, Shogun Iemitsu dubbed him as \u201Cpeerless in swordsmanship.\u201D</p><p>He is a strategist and politician.</p><p>Not only has he instructed daimyos and their relatives in the Shinkage-ryu, he also sent his disciples to serve influential daimyos as swordsmanship instructors. He is often regarded as an extraordinary plotter in historical novels and plays. This is probably out of the reason that, in the early Edo Period, it would be impossible to raise the Yagyuu clan up to a social position of a Daimyo with 12,500 koku just by being honest and clean handed.</p><p>It is said Yagyuu received great trust from Iemitsu as a strategic instructor.</p><p>It was documented that Iemitsu had a nickname to call Munenori (Ryuu-tan). It was a nickname that took one kanji character apiece from Yagyuu and Tajima. He said \u201Clive Yagyuu\u201D as his order after death.</p><p>It was said that he quickly saw through the expansion of the Shimabara Rebellion with excellent foresight.</p><p>In the 14th year of the Kan\u2019ei era (1637 AD), right after the news of a rebellion by Christian believers was arrived, Munenori desperately tried to hold back Itakura Naizen-no-Kami Shigemasa, who was tasked with leading a punitive expedition. It\u2019s been said, when Yagyuu was asked why by Shogun Iemitsu, Munenori answered \u201Creligious wars are always a serious matter\u201D and \u201CShigemasa-dono would have died in battle.\u201D</p><p>The situation progressed as Munenori predicted. Shigemasa, who\u2019s a daimyou of 15,000 koku, was lacking in strength despite leading all the western daimyou and found himself forced into a hard fight as a result. As he saw the situation turning grimmer, Shogun Iemitsu dispatched his chief vassal, Mastsudaira Nobutsuna, to act as supreme commander, but when Shigemasa was notified about it, he became impatient and attempted an assault on the enemy camp before Nobutsuna\u2019s arrival and ended up tragically dying in the process.</p><p>\u25C7</p><p>He is a heroic swordsman in the\u300ESeven Heroic Swordsmen Showdown\u300Fwho appeared as Saber Empireo. Craving a battle with Miyamoto Musashi, he transformed into a devilish swordsman embedded with a karma of absolute massacre as a Servant with a body of flesh and blood. Munenori already attained being a master swordsman, but with his desire to fight Musashi, he was completely distorted and not only did he have a complete state of mind as master swordsmen, he also accepted a violent end as a devilish swordsmen. He is summoned in Chaldea as his pruned phenomenon self that turned him into Empireo---------He doesn\u2019t really talk about the \u201Cif\u201D version of himself. It must be quite a twist of fate that the\u300CYagyuu Munenori\u300D, who should have attained the state of \u201CZen through the sword,\u201D would stray that far, that is all he will say, with a slight smile.</p><p>\u25C7</p><p>There are anecdotes of Munenori having criticized Musashi\u2019s existence during his lifetime. He said things such as \u201CMusashi is a member of the Western Army\u201D and \u201Can enemy of Tokugawa.\u201D In his lifetime, Munenori never clashed nor met with Musashi, but was in fact mindful about him------</p><p>Or so has been established in this work. Therefore, he was fixated with his duel with Musashi during the\u300ESeven Heroic Swordsmen Showdown\u300Fas Saber Empireo. He also knew that she was a different person than the\u300CMiyamoto Musashi\u300Dfrom his own world.</p><p>The Munenori who was summoned to Chaldea as a Heroic Spirit has already recognized Musashi\u2019s skills and way of being. He shouldn\u2019t have shared memories of being Empireo who was his pruned phenomenon existence, but-----------</p><p>As for what he thinks of the\u300CMiyamoto Musashi\u300Dof his own world\u2026.that remains a mystery for now.</p><h2 id="related-characters" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#related-characters" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Related Characters</h2><p><strong>Miyamoto Musashi / Sasaki Kojiro / Houzouin Inshun / Diarmuid Ua Duibhne / Artoria Pendragon / Arthur Pendragon</strong></p><p>....Let me see.</p><p>They are all magnificent people, I wonder if I shall have a chance to cross blades with them.</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen</strong></p><p>Hmm, a photo.</p><p>Of a creature that reminds me of Loco Moco?
