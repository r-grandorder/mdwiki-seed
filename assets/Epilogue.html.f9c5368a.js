It&#39;s almost time to wake up.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Hm\u2015\u2015\u2015I guess you&#39;re right. Morning, Sakura. Thanks for waking me up.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;No, it&#39;s nothing you need to thank me for. I knew you would wake up properly, so I only did a needless thing.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;I see. ......Then why did you come to wake me up?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I wanted to wake you up today, so I woke up 30 minutes earlier than usual. Today&#39;s a special day, you know?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Oh.&quot;</p><p>That reminds me.</p><p>That&#39;s right. Today is a special day.</p><hr><p>&quot;Sakura. I don&#39;t think I even need to ask, but Fuji-Nee isn&#39;t here yet, right?&quot;</p><p>&quot;No, Fujimura-Sensei is not here yet. Oh, but Illya-chan is already here.&quot;</p><hr><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015As I thought.</p><p>Illya being the only one here means one thing.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015Crap. Sorry Sakura, but can you take care of breakfast? I&#39;ll go and wake Fuji-Nee up.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh, yes. Sorry for your troubles, Senpai.&quot;</p><hr><p>Fortunately, I worked late last night as well, so I&#39;m still in my work clothes.</p><p>It&#39;s good I can go outside without having to change.</p><hr><p>&quot;I&#39;ll be back in ten minutes, so I&#39;ll leave the rest to you.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes, please do.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh, Shirou&#39;s awake.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yeah, I just woke up. I&#39;m going to go wake Fuji-Nee, so help Sakura out, will you?&quot;</p><p>Patting Illya on her shoulder, I head to the front entrance.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015I got beat. Geez, I told you I&#39;m going to wake Shirou up, Sakura!&quot;</p><p>Illya runs to the shed screaming.</p><p>Such a scene isn&#39;t that unusual now.</p><hr><p>Illya said she wouldn&#39;t go back to her country, so I consulted Fuji-Nee to see if I could keep her at my place.</p><p>Fuji-Nee really objected, said her house was better, and ended up taking Illya in.</p><p>Since then, still staying at the Fujimura house, Illya comes attacking with Fuji-Nee at morning and at night.</p><p>Needless to say, their target is breakfast and dinner.</p><p>It&#39;s been two months since they started living together, and they seem to be in union now.</p><hr><p>When I walk past the shed area, I hear voices over the wall.</p><p>It&#39;s Sakura and Illya talking.</p><hr><p>I thought Illya would not get along with Sakura since Illya has that really unreserved personality, but I was wrong.</p><p>The two consisting of the energetic Illya and the quiet Sakura are getting along well even though they&#39;re rather noisy.</p><p>In fact, Sakura is regaining her spirit because of Illya.</p><hr><p>...Sakura stopped smiling when her brother, Matou Shinji, disappeared and was considered missing.</p><p>She must have vaguely understood the connection with the mass coma incident at the school.</p><p>She was worried about the missing Shinji and moped for a long time.</p><hr><p>It was Illya who forcibly made Sakura get over it, and Sakura regains her cheerfulness when Illya is around.</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Yeah. Sakura is able to laugh now.&quot;</p><p>I&#39;m purely happy for that.</p><p>Because that soft smile certainly suits her.</p><hr><p>&quot;Uhh, you&#39;re mean, Illya-chan. I even gave you a special bonus to wake me up no matter what.&quot;</p><p>Fuji-Nee scoffs down breakfast while crying.</p><hr><p>&quot;It&#39;s only natural. I&#39;ll be late too if I wait for Taiga, and I worked enough for what I got paid for. If you want more out of me, you should raise the base pay and not just give me a special pay.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;......Hmm. Why are you such a miser when you&#39;re getting paid from grandfather as well?</p><p>Everyone would hate you if you&#39;re stingy about money from such a young age.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;I don&#39;t care if I&#39;m hated. I don&#39;t care what people beside the ones I like think of me. And Taiga, pay me back the money I let you borrow. Your payday was five days ago, right?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015Eh? H-How do you know that!?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I heard from Laiga. I can give you the details as well if you wish.&quot;</p><hr><p>Illya smiles daringly.</p><p>In contrast to Sakura, Illya and Fuji-Nee do not get along well.</p><p>And to add, Illya gets really mean when she faces Fuji-Nee. That smile right now is like that certain someone.</p><hr><p>&quot;You have until tomorrow to repay me. If you can&#39;t, I&#39;ll just take it away from your allowance.&quot;</p><p>&quot;......! G-Grandfather told you even that!?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Yes, we&#39;re together all noon. Laiga praised me that I&#39;m much cuter than Taiga.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Awawawa......! What are you going to do about it, Shirou? This girl&#39;s such a devil! She&#39;ll take over the Fujimura group if you let her be!&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>Actually, more than that...</p><p>You were still getting allowances at that age...?</p><hr><p>&quot;See you, Shirou. You&#39;re going to be back early today, right? Then I&#39;ll be waiting here, so come home right away.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yeah, I&#39;ll try. Take care while I&#39;m gone.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...Humph. You might as well live here, you idiot.&quot;</p><p>Fuji-Nee sulks while hiding behind my back.</p><p>&quot;Yeah, yeah. You should get yourself together too. You can&#39;t cause Shirou trouble outside.&quot;</p><hr><p>Illya easily turns aside her remark.</p><p>The power relationship must already be at a position where Fuji-Nee can&#39;t push back by force.</p><hr><p>&quot;Then I&#39;ll be going ahead, but don&#39;t walk slow and be late for school.&quot;</p><p><em>Brrrrrr</em> Leaving the sound of exhaust, Fuji-Nee disappears like a bullet.</p><hr><p>Fuji-Nee got her license a month ago.</p><p>Since then, her tardiness decreased considerably, but she has received another nickname of Rocket Tiger... I mean, Rocket Diver that only she doesn&#39;t know about.</p><hr><p>&quot;Phew.&quot;</p><p>I stretch out and take a deep breath.</p><p>Sakura has gone to school already.</p><p>Seeing how she was eating a large bowl of rice today, it seems she is in real high spirits.</p><p>Today is the big day for the archery club.</p><p>Sakura must be enthusiastic to work hard as the co-captain of the archery club.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Well.&quot;</p><p>Let&#39;s go to school.</p><p>Today is April 7th.</p><p>There&#39;s the school entrance ceremony, and the season is past the cold winter and already into spring.</p><hr><p>It&#39;s been two months since then.</p><p>It feels like a lot has changed since she has gone away, but I think the changes are trivial.</p><hr><p>Winter ended and spring came.</p><p>That&#39;s all that&#39;s changed.</p><p>I feel like I&#39;ve grown up a bit, but it&#39;s not like that caused me to be any different.</p><p>So not much has changed.</p><p>Emiya Shirou is clumsily running after Kiritsugu as usual.</p><hr><p>&quot;Good morning, Emiya-kun. It&#39;s unexpected to see you in the morning.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Hey. It sure is a good day today, Tohsaka.&quot;</p><p>I raise my hand and greet her.</p><hr><p>&quot;But is it really unexpected? We&#39;re barely missing each other recently.</p><p>Well, I certainly didn&#39;t come across you too many times before.&quot;</p><p>&quot;...Come across?&quot;</p><hr><p>Tohsaka glares at me as if unhappy about something.</p><p>I don&#39;t think it&#39;s good to send an aura of enmity first thing in the morning.</p><hr><p>&quot;Tohsaka, did you change the time you leave your house? You came later before, right? You came at a time that wasn&#39;t too late or too early.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;That&#39;s not true. I bet it&#39;s only coincidence that we didn&#39;t see each other until now.</p><p>Do you know? My house and your house are in the exact opposite locations. So if we get up and go down the hill, it&#39;s only natural that we meet here.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015Oh.</p><p>That&#39;s the first time I&#39;ve heard that. I see, that would certainly\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>...Wait, hold on.</p><p>That&#39;s only if we do the same things around the same time.</p><p>For Tohsaka to come to this intersection at this time, she would have to get up at six.</p><p>But that&#39;s...</p><hr><p>&quot;Tohsaka, you&#39;re not sleepy?&quot;</p><p>I ask her directly.</p><hr><p>&quot;...What do you mean by that? I&#39;m not sleepy nor pushing myself.</p><p>Why do you ask such a thing?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Well, you weren&#39;t a morning person.</p><p>You&#39;ll unmask your true self if you go to school with lack of sleep. It&#39;ll be terrible if you fall asleep during class.</p><p>I bet you&#39;ll rage around with a face like an awakened demon if someone tries to wake you up.&quot;</p><p>Like &quot;I will kill all that disturbs my sleep&quot; kind of thing.</p><hr><p>&quot;I-I won&#39;t do such a thing! I won&#39;t make such a mistake just by waking up 30 minutes early!&quot;</p><p>&quot;See. You did wake up early.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015!</p><p>Geez, quit worrying about when other people get up. If you have time to inquire about such boring things, just go to school!&quot;</p><p>Tohsaka gets angry while looking away.</p><p>Her excuse is plausible, so I stop my greeting here and we resume our way to school.</p><hr><p>We go up the hill.</p><p>The streets and houses below me have all changed to show the coming of spring.</p><p>The wind is comfortable, and the cherry blossom flowers flutter down occasionally from the school on top of the hill.</p><p>Everything that can be seen and felt is pleasant.</p><hr><p>&quot;Do you have work all this week?</p><p>...I won&#39;t complain since it&#39;s your time, but don&#39;t you get sick like that?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Huh\u2015\u2015\u2015? No, I got today off.</p><p>I heard that the archery club is doing a welcome party for the new members, so I&#39;m thinking of going with Illya.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Wow. You have some great guts. You&#39;re a big shot if you&#39;re taking Illya to school with an unconcerned face.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;? Is it bad? I think it&#39;ll let Illya kill some time, and it should make her happy.&quot;</p><p>&quot;It is bad. It&#39;s bad, but I guess I&#39;ll show up as well then. It won&#39;t be boring if Illya&#39;s going to be there, and most of all, I just can&#39;t leave her alone because it&#39;s too dangerous.&quot;</p><hr><p>I&#39;m thankful that she says that.</p><p>It&#39;s Tohsaka, not Sakura or me, that understands Illya the most.</p><p>There&#39;s the fact that she periodically takes care of Illya, but more importantly, Illya and Tohsaka are natural-born magi.</p><p>I think Tohsaka would be a good teacher for Illya as she doesn&#39;t quite realize what it&#39;s like to live as a magus while hiding that fact.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>Thus, things are settling into the way they should be.</p><p>The damage from the Holy Grail War is almost completely restored by the new priest dispatched by the Church, and our everyday life has returned without problems.</p><p>There are certainly things that were lost and will not return.</p><p>But the wounds have slowly healed and I should be happy about the regrets fading away.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015But it was unexpected.&quot;</p><p>And then.</p><p>Tohsaka murmurs in a serious tone while looking down at the town below her.</p><hr><p>&quot;? What was unexpected?&quot;</p><p>&quot;...Yeah. I thought you would be more depressed.</p><p>I thought you wouldn&#39;t be able to get over it for a while.&quot;</p><hr><p>That is about the girl that isn&#39;t here anymore.</p><p>It&#39;s been two months since then\u2015\u2015\u2015it&#39;s about the golden-haired girl that we talk about for the first time since then.</p><hr><p>&quot;Yeah. That&#39;s what I thought too. I was about to go insane just thinking about the future.&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015But it turns out you didn&#39;t change after that. You didn&#39;t even get depressed as you were fine the next day.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...At that time, I wondered if you were really all right. I can&#39;t put this into words real well, but you had the atmosphere of a guy that would die in an accident the next day.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;What is that? Why would I easily die when I&#39;m doing well?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Things like that happen. When people accomplish their lifelong goals by mistake, they can suddenly die.</p><p>The instant they think like &quot;Oh, I don&#39;t think I need to live anymore&quot;, cars run into them running red lights and they fall down stairs.&quot;</p><hr><p>...Okay.</p><p>Tohsaka&#39;s metaphor is difficult to understand.</p><p>She might want to say something about peaceful death and going to heaven or something.</p><hr><p>&quot;So I was worried about that. At times like that, people around you feel more relief if you get really depressed.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh. Then would you have comforted me if I was depressed?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015Of course not. I would have kicked you in the back and made you get over it. I&#39;m just saying that it&#39;s a bit disappointing since I couldn&#39;t do that.&quot;</p><p>She looks away in displeasure.</p><p>Her gesture looks so funny that I laugh.</p><hr><p>&quot;What? Was it strange?&quot;</p><p>&quot;No, it was a strict line surely fitting you, so I feel relieved.&quot;</p><hr><p>We both walk on looking up at the spring sunlight.</p><p>The hill is long and it looks as if it&#39;ll continue on into the endless blue sky.</p><p>And as if saying something trifling...</p><hr><p>&quot;Then you don&#39;t have any regrets? With Saber gone and all?&quot;</p><p>Tohsaka murmurs while looking up at the sky.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015No. I probably don&#39;t have any regrets.&quot;</p><p>It&#39;s not a bluff, and I say so with a calm state that even surprises me.</p><hr><p>There is no regret, and I don&#39;t have anything I forgot to tell her.</p><p>That parting contained everything.</p><p>What I wanted to do.</p><p>What she dreamed of.</p><p>It was a competition of our determination, and maybe I should have taken her hand and granted her dream.</p><hr><p>But\u2015\u2015\u2015there was something we both felt was beautiful, and we desperately protected it until the very end.</p><p>There&#39;s nothing to feel regret about.</p><p>As she has properly ended her time...</p><p>I cannot remain in this reminiscence forever.</p><hr><p>&quot;...I see. Then you&#39;ve concluded this inside you already.</p><p>So that&#39;s why you&#39;re not depressed or filling yourself with reminiscence.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Yeah. But I still dream about it. I&#39;ll recall her for the rest of my life.</p><p>My memory will fade away someday, and I will forget about her voice and her gestures.</p><p>But still\u2015\u2015\u2015I&#39;ll remember forever that this thing occurred and that I loved Saber.&quot;</p><hr><p>Tohsaka doesn&#39;t say anything.</p><p>But for some reason, she looks happy and starts to walk as if she&#39;s skipping.</p><hr><p>&quot;What&#39;s going on, Tohsaka? Did something happen to make you hurry?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;It&#39;s nothing. I just want to get to school quickly.</p><p>So let&#39;s hurry! I&#39;ll leave you behind if you&#39;re slow!&quot;</p><p>Turning around, Tohsaka starts running up the hill.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015What is she doing? Pushing herself when she&#39;s not a morning person...&quot;</p><p>Grumbling, I throw the bag over my shoulder and start to run.</p><p>It&#39;s still 7:30.</p><p>It&#39;s too early a time for a student not involved in any club activities, but I guess there&#39;s nothing wrong with being early.</p><hr><p>Running up the road that seems to go up into the sky, I reach the school earlier than usual.</p><hr><p>Today is the day the new year starts.</p><p>If I am to celebrate it, I have to shake off my old memories and hurry up.</p><p>Traces will never go away.</p><p>Even if I almost cry from the vacancy hitting my heart.</p><hr><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015Blue sky is in the distance.</p><p>It feels so close.</p><p>Yet, I cannot grab it even if I reach out with my hands.</p><hr><p>I looked up at the stars before.</p><p>The stars that I cannot reach and the wishes that will not be granted.</p><p>There is nothing we have been able to leave behind for each other.</p><p>Therefore, traces and memories will disappear someday.</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>But still...</p><p>Even if it will not reach her, there should be something that will remain in our hearts.</p><hr><p>There is nothing that remains in our hands, but we lived the same time and looked up at the same things.</p><p>If I can remember that\u2015\u2015\u2015I can believe that we can be together even if we are far apart.</p><p>I can assent that as there are things that will go away, there are also things that will not go away.</p><hr><p>That is why I will keep running for now.</p><p>If I aim for the distance, there should come a day when I will be able to reach out to what I have been aiming for.</p><hr><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015Winter has passed and it is spring, the season of new beginnings.</p><p>Under the blue sky that she has also seen, I keep running up the hill.</p><hr><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015The battle has ended.</p><p>Her last battleground, the battle that was fought between the split halves of her country, ended with the king&#39;s victory.</p><hr><p>&quot;Haa, haa, haa, ha\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015!&quot;</p><p>The knight is running.</p><p>The battle has ended, the bloody red sun has already set, and the darkness of the night is already ruling over the battlefield.</p><p>The hill, covered with corpses, is filled with curses, crying out to try to take the survivors with them.</p><hr><p>Through it all, the knight runs panting.</p><p>A rein is in the knight&#39;s hand, and the wounded white horse earnestly follows him.</p><p>The only survivors are this knight and this horse.</p><p>And this one king that is lying on the white horse&#39;s back.</p><hr><p>&quot;Your highness...! King Arthur, please come this way\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015!&quot;</p><p>He must be wounded himself, but the knight runs through the battlefield with all his energy.</p><p>The king he is serving is on the verge of death.</p><p>The king has defeated the enemy&#39;s king in personal combat, but the king received a fatal wound as well.</p><p>The wound is fatal even in the knight&#39;s eyes.</p><p>The king that they have served will soon reach death.</p><hr><p>&quot;Please get a hold of yourself...! If we reach that forest, we shall certainly...!&quot;</p><p>He desperately calls out.</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015Or possibly, the knight might have really believed it.</p><p>That their king is immortal.</p><p>That as long as the guidance of the holy sword is there, the king would never die.</p><hr><p>&quot;Haa\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Haa, haa, haa, ha\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015!&quot;</p><p>He breathes hard, passes over mountains of corpses, and heads for the forest that is not covered in blood.</p><p>He knew of the king&#39;s immortality.</p><p>Therefore, he believes that the king&#39;s wound will heal if he escapes this cursed battlefield and makes it to a pure place.</p><hr><p>No\u2015\u2015\u2015he could only believe so.</p><p>He believed his own king, unlike the other knights.</p><p>The king was isolated in the Court, alienated by the knights, and was feared by the people.</p><p>But the king did not show emotion even in such a situation and always stayed as an ideal, and the knight felt pride in his young king.</p><hr><p>He did not serve his country.</p><p>He had entrusted his sword, struggled to be of power, and made his way to be a personal guard of the king as a young man because it was this king.</p><p>The masked king.</p><p>The boy who tried to allow no personal feelings and to be fair.</p><p>He might have hoped to be able to see the king&#39;s true face if he went near the king.</p><hr><p>He just wanted to see the king&#39;s true expressions.</p><p>Not the face he puts on during battle or in the castle, but a real smiling face of a human.</p><p>It should appear in the Court when he has been released from his duties.</p><p>No matter how perfect a king is, he cannot strain his mind twenty-four hours a day.</p><hr><p>But that thinking proved wrong.</p><p>The only thing he found out was the truth contrary to his expectation.</p><p>He has made it to the rank of Imperial Guard and was able to guard beside the king.</p><p>He has guarded the king closer than any other knights and kept watch on the king&#39;s behaviors.</p><p>But still, it did not happen even once.</p><p>His king never smiled.</p><hr><p>&quot;Haa\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Haa, haa, haa\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015!&quot;</p><p>Since when did he feel anger toward it?</p><p>The king has accomplished so many great deeds and has accrued much\u0320glory.</p><p>But in fact, the king never showed a peaceful face.</p><p>He could not approve of that fact.</p><p>He wanted to believe such a thing should not be allowed.</p><p>That is why he wished for his king to be awarded the light.</p><hr><p>But he has yet to accomplish that.</p><p>The king is still isolated.</p><p>That is why the knight continuously did not approve of the king&#39;s death.</p><p>He cannot end it here.</p><p>He thinks that this great king is not rewarded enough for his actions.</p><hr><p>&quot;Your highness, please stay here. I shall go get someone right away.&quot;</p><p>In the forest he reaches, the knight lays the king by a large tree.</p><p>The situation is a race against time.</p><p>It takes half a day no matter how much he hurries to go to the port where his own army is left.</p><p>Anyone with eyes should be able to tell if the king&#39;s life will last till the morning or not.</p><hr><p>&quot;Please endure until then. I shall certainly bring our troops here.&quot;</p><p>He salutes the unconscious king and runs to his white horse.</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Bedivere&quot;</p><p>Before that.</p><p>The king that should have been unconscious calls out his name.</p><hr><p>&quot;Your highness!? Have you regained your consciousness...!?&quot;</p><p>&quot;...Yes. I was watching a dream.&quot;</p><p>A faint voice.</p><p>But that voice\u2015\u2015\u2015seems warm to the knight.</p><hr><p>&quot;A dream...?&quot;</p><p>He calls out as if to search.</p><p>The king&#39;s consciousness is not certain. He shall go back into the darkness unless he replies so.</p><p>&quot;Yes. I have not seen many dreams, so I had a valuable experience.&quot;</p><p>&quot;...That is great. Then please be at ease and rest. I shall go get the troops in that time.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>A gasping sound.</p><p>It sounds as if what the knight said was unexpected.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Your highness? Have I been rude...?&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015No, I was just surprised at your point. I did not know a dream could be seen after one awakens. Are you saying I will be able to see the same dream if I close my eyes again...?&quot;</p><p>Now, it is the knight&#39;s turn to be surprised.</p><p>He stutters, but replies even though he knows it is a lie.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015Yes.

You are knowledgeable, Bedivere.&quot;</p><p>The king murmurs as if impressed.</p><p>His face is still looking down and he does not even look up at the knight.</p><p>The king breathes so softly that it can be barely heard, and quietly\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><p>&quot;Bedivere.
