How&#39;s everyone doing\uFF5E?\u201D</p><p>A relaxed morning greeting that does not befit a teacher.</p><p>...Well, it is Fuji-Nee, after all. Looking sharp really isn&#39;t like her.</p><hr><p>\u201CIt doesn&#39;t bother me, but the way it&#39;s going...\u201D</p><p>\u201CWhat is it? What bothers you, Shirou?\u201D</p><p>Fuji-Nee notices me shaking my head.</p><p>Here, we&#39;re strictly teacher and student, but it&#39;s just before homeroom and class hasn&#39;t started yet.</p><hr><p>\u201COh, nothing. You&#39;re just being your own self, as usual.\u201D</p><p>\u201CMmmmmph. Are you trying to say that I don&#39;t look like a teacher, Emiya?\u201D</p><p>\u201CIt&#39;s not that bad... No, I don&#39;t particularly care right now.\u201D</p><hr><p>We see each other all the time, and know each other&#39;s problems all too well.</p><p>Putting it that way, it&#39;s an ideal teacher-student relationship where nothing needs to be hidden\u2015\u2015\u2015one could say, but it&#39;s just natural for siblings.</p><hr><p>\u201CMmmhm. Shirou, shouldn&#39;t you start taking it seriously too?\u201D</p><p>\u201CEh? Did I do something?\u201D</p><p>\u201CSee, it&#39;s not long till you graduate, and you&#39;re still playing around, aren&#39;t you. That&#39;s no good, that&#39;s really no good. As your teacher, I&#39;m concerned, very concerned.\u201D</p><p>Fuji-Nee keeps lamenting, but she doesn&#39;t sound serious.</p><p>I suppose that&#39;s why students find her easy to approach for all sorts of advice. It&#39;s her natural personality.</p><hr><p>\u201CShirou, you should rely on your homeroom teacher too and ask me for advice.\u201D</p><p>\u201CLike tonight&#39;s dinner menu?\u201D</p><p>\u201CAh, meat would be great\u2015\u2015\u2015 Yep, lots of protein and fat in those steaks!\u201D</p><p>Early morning at school, and this is what we end up discussing?</p><p>All of a sudden, a figure walks past, shadow-like\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>\u201CGood morning, Kuzuki-sensei.\u201D</p><p>\u201CAh, good morning.\u201D</p><p>\u201CMorning.\u201D</p><p>That was Kuzuki, the strict ethics teacher.</p><p>It is said that students admire him more with every year they spend in school, and I was no exception. As I went into my third year, I began to appreciate his style.</p><hr><p>\u201CFujimura-sensei, about this month&#39;s arrangements.\u201D</p><p>\u201CThe preparations for the cultural festival and exams, right? Oh, what did they decide about the date for the regular teachers&#39; meeting?\u201D</p><p>\u201CIt is in the evening today. There is also the matter of guidance counseling for the seniors.\u201D</p><p>\u201CRight. Career choice is definitely important. But since the students respect you well.\u201D</p><hr><p>Fuji-Nee is holding a very professional conversation.</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015I instinctively reach to rub my eyes to make sure I&#39;m not dreaming.</p><hr><p>\u201CNo, I am not quite as popular as you are, Fujimura-sensei.\u201D</p><p>\u201CThat&#39;s not true. Look, Emiya-kun&#39;s expression says it all.\u201D</p><p>Don&#39;t just dump it on me.</p><p>I can&#39;t relax in front of Kuzuki.</p><hr><p>\u201CI believe you are a teacher I can rely on, Kuzuki-sensei.\u201D</p><p>\u201C...I see. I will try to live up to your trust. Well, then.\u201D</p><p>Kuzuki heads towards the classroom.</p><p>The moment his slim figure disappears down the hallway\u2015\u2015\u2015the two of us breathe a collective sigh of relief.</p><hr><p>\u201CReally, Shirou, acting like a good kid all of a sudden.\u201D</p><p>\u201CAnd you, stop feigning innocence all of a sudden... I mean, you sure can pull it off.\u201D</p><p>\u201CWhat&#39;s with that tone? You aren&#39;t lumping me with the delinquents, are you? Hm? Delinquent? Girly?\u201D</p><p>The idea of being called a &quot;girl&quot; apparently pleases her, so she repeats it a few times.</p><p>\u201C...Don&#39;t see a problem. Ah, but if I was raised by a delinquent, wouldn&#39;t that make me one, too?\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><p>Looks like we wasted all of the pre-homeroom time on this.</p><hr><p>\u201CAh, it&#39;s almost time. Mmh, I&#39;m sure you&#39;re not a delinquent.</p><p>Alright, to the classroom.\u201D</p><p>\u201C...Ack, we should just about make it this time.\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Ayaah!\u201D</p><hr><p>She dashes forward with an odd battle cry. No way!</p><p>What happened to the serious teacher just now\u2015\u2015\u2015?</p><hr><p>\u201CHey, hey, you&#39;ll be late if you don&#39;t make it, Emiya-kun!!\u201D</p><p>\u201CKuh, delinquent or not, get your own identity sorted out first...!\u201D</p><hr><h3 id="school\u30FBday-1-let-s-go-for-lunch" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#school\u30FBday-1-let-s-go-for-lunch" aria-hidden="true">#</a> School\u30FBDay 1 Let&#39;s go for lunch!</h3><hr><p>\u201CEmiya, let&#39;s go eat lunch.\u201D</p><p>For reasons unknown, Shinji came up to me and invited me to join him for lunch.</p><p>Totally out of the blue, but it does happen a few times a year, so it&#39;s not that surprising.</p><hr><p>\u201COkay. I brought my own lunch, though.</p><p>You? Should we go get something from the cafeteria?\u201D</p><p>\u201CCafeteria? Nah, not in the mood for cheapo stuff. Why don&#39;t we just go out?\u201D</p><p>Out...? I guess he means the shops in Miyama.</p><p>I hear it&#39;s reckless, but it&#39;s not impossible to get back before fifth period if we hurry up.</p><hr><p>\u201C...I guess once in a while is okay. I could just give my lunch to Gotou-kun as thanks for the other day, too.\u201D</p><p>\u201COoh, then it&#39;s settled already! Alright, in return for being earnest, I shall introduce you to my one prized shop today. See, I found this amazing pasta place near work.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C? Wait, if we go out to Shinto, there&#39;s no way we&#39;ll make it back in time. Let&#39;s just go to somewhere in Miyama.\u201D</p><p>\u201CWe can just skip. Don&#39;t you have enough credits to pass already?\u201D</p><hr><p>&quot;Come on, let&#39;s go,&quot; he keeps bugging me as if it&#39;s now or never.</p><p>...I have my reservations, but I just can&#39;t get the words &quot;amazing pasta&quot; out of my head.</p><p>For Shinji, very particular about taste, to praise it so, it may well be worthwhile\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>\u201CFool! To bring down a fellow classmate to your level, that is unsightly, Matou!\u201D</p><p>And so Issei, who was listening (eavesdropping) in the back, interrupts with the flames of justice.</p><hr><p>\u201CWhat is it, Ryuudou? Where we go out to eat is none of your business. You are a third party. Please keep your mouth shut.\u201D</p><p>\u201CIt is my business. My classmate is being led astray by a delinquent&#39;s deceptive words. It is only right that I should step in.</p><p>And besides, Emiya made a promise with me first. Right, Emiya?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CEh... Sorry, I don&#39;t... remember.\u201D</p><p>But if Issei says so, it&#39;s probably true.</p><p>I&#39;ve been having trouble remembering things recently, for some reason.</p><p>I probably said I&#39;d go to the student council room in the morning.</p><p>I really don&#39;t recall saying that, though.</p><hr><p>\u201CYou mean you replied without thought...? Really, I was going to stay quiet since I thought you would refuse, anyway, but the force of his attack is too severe.</p><p>Well, let&#39;s go, Emiya. I will bring out our most prized tea leaves today. The kind that no Shinto Italian place can compare to.\u201D</p><p>\u201CAh.\u201D</p><p>I&#39;m being dragged to the student council room.</p><hr><p>\u201CHuh? Say what?</p><p>&quot;Come to the student council room when you&#39;re free,&quot; isn&#39;t that what you always tell him?</p><p>That&#39;s not a promise or anything. Nah, isn&#39;t it more like an order? When did you pass the rule about having lunch in the council room if you&#39;ve got nothing better to do, Mr. President?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CWhy would someone even write a rule like that?</p><p>Lunch in the council room was arranged with our mutual agreement. Emiya, tell him. Tell him that you made the promise with me this morning.\u201D</p><p>\u201CEh\u2015\u2015\u2015I did? This morning?\u201D</p><p>\u201CYes. Right before the end of homeroom we looked at each other, remember?</p><p>And so I coughed, which signaled that it would be the student council room. If you coughed, then it would have been the classroom.\u201D</p><hr><p>He shakes his head.</p><p>\u201C........................Aah...\u201D</p><p>......I&#39;m really sorry. I didn&#39;t notice we had such a rule for three years.</p><p>I did think that he coughed unnaturally from time to time. I see, so that&#39;s how we&#39;ve been deciding on the meeting place.</p><hr><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Hey, listen.</p><p>I thought before, aren&#39;t you starting to lose it, Ryuudou?\u201D</p><p>\u201CHow rude. I do not want to hear that, and from you even more so.\u201D</p><hr><p>Sparks start flying between the two of them.</p><p>There&#39;s nothing spectacular going on, but it is an exciting battle nevertheless.</p><p>I would rather take out my lunch and spectate as I&#39;m eating, but then, I would be the only one full by the end of it.</p><hr><p>\u201CHey, you two.</p><p>Lunch isn&#39;t that long, you should settle it later.</p><p>What about all three of us go to the cafeteria? Shinji gives up going out, Issei gives up the student council room. That should be a good compromise.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CI refuse. If I say I&#39;m going out, then I am going out. Now come, Emiya. I&#39;ll buy you lunch. And then we&#39;ll hit the streets after that. See, today there&#39;s a party with girls from Western High.\u201D</p><p>\u201CHumph, I really cannot understand you, Matou. I&#39;m telling you, stop dragging Emiya down the path of evil. If you like western food so much, then just move to Europe! And do not try to lure Emiya with the prospects of meeting girls!\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C..................\u201D</p><p>Looks like my proposal has failed miserably, too.</p><p>It seems that the two of them have no intention of eating with me and the other one.</p><hr><p>\u201CWhatever. Do as you wish. I&#39;ll be going to the cafeteria myself.\u201D</p><p>\u201CWait, Emiya, that would be too cruel! You must make your decision here. It is your duty as a friend.</p><p>Whichever one is left behind will be proven wrong. You must show your will of steel!\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CI agree! It makes me vomit to agree with Ryuudou, but that is true, dammit!</p><p>Now, hurry up and say it, Emiya. Which one of us will be eating lunch all alone?!\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CI&#39;ll go with Issei, then.\u201D</p><p>\u201CWHY!? It&#39;s the Shinto pasta shop!</p><p>And then a party with the girls! It&#39;s three hours with girls that are hot even in my opinion! It&#39;s obviously the better deal!</p><p>Bah, I really don&#39;t get you, Emiya!\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CMm, I am interested in the pasta shop and even though parties aren&#39;t my thing, I&#39;m not opposed to that either. But the main problem is...\u201D</p><p>I point toward the schedule.</p><p>That&#39;s right. Fifth period is Fuji-Nee&#39;s class.</p><hr><p>\u201C...Indeed. It&#39;s a bit regrettable, but it is a very student-like answer. There is no other way. Amen.\u201D</p><p>\u201CAnd so, you should reconsider too, Shinji. Let&#39;s eat together in the council room. If you don&#39;t like cafeteria food, I&#39;ll share my lunch.\u201D</p><p>\u201CHeh, I doubt that will be necessary. Having blurted out that much, I highly doubt he&#39;ll be staying in school for lunch.</p><p>Isn&#39;t that right, Matou?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CHmm, hmph! It is as you say, Ryuudou. Even if you beg, I shall not go.</p><p>Fine! You guys enjoy your simple plebeian lunch, then. But make no mistake, I shall show you who the final and real victor is!\u201D</p><p>&quot;Ahaha\xD7ha\u2015\u2606,&quot; Shinji half laughs, half cries and goes away.</p><hr><p>\u201C..................\u201D</p><p>Damn.</p><p>I&#39;m not sure, but maybe I was a bit too harsh.</p><hr><p>\u201CIssei, did I say it wrong?\u201D</p><p>\u201C......I&#39;d say so.</p><p>I do not take a liking to Matou, but you should choose your words more carefully. If I were Matou, then I would most definitely be in despair right now.\u201D</p><p>\u201C?\u201D</p><p>I can&#39;t really understand Issei, either.</p><p>Saying he feels no sympathy toward him, he turns in the direction Shinji ran off to and clasps his hands in silent prayer.</p><hr><p>The bell rings to signal the end of lunch.</p><p>We conclude our lunch in the council room and prepare for class, about to start in five minutes.</p><p>Shinji&#39;s missing... it seems he hasn&#39;t come back yet.</p><hr><p>\u201C....Mmm. Danger past, God forgotten, I guess.</p><p>It seems we have wronged Matou today. The tuna cutlet was particularly good. Maybe we should have given him a piece to try\u2015\u2015\u2015 Hm?\u201D</p><p>It wasn&#39;t just Issei who noticed something odd.</p><p>Everyone in the class is looking out into the hallway to see what&#39;s going on.</p><hr><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015Ah.\u201D</p><p>A crowd resembling a circus is approaching.</p><p>The troupe traveling down the hallway appears to include Shinji and many of his first-year female admirers.</p><p>They all have their lunchboxes and are feeding Shinji.</p><hr><p>\u201CWh-what\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><p>Issei stands speechless.</p><p>Shinji stops to boast.</p><hr><p>\u201CMy, my, isn&#39;t that the lonely duo of men who eat their lunch in the company of each other?</p><p>How could it have been? I do wonder if today&#39;s lunch was just as pitiful. There weren&#39;t any cheering girls, were there? &quot;Kyaa, Shinji-sama, you&#39;re the best\u2606!&quot; No such thing, eh?\u201D</p><p>Issei starts to shake.</p><p>Shinji&#39;s mood is already MAXXed.</p><hr><p>\u201CMe? I&#39;m the best! My joy cannot be put into words! And I wanted to share this feeling with you two, too bad!\u201D</p><p>\u201CDamn you, you really are a primitive bastard!\u201D</p><p>\u201COh no, run away, everyone! That&#39;s the smelly student council president over there, he&#39;ll catch you and dress you up in tasteless clothes!\u201D</p><hr><p>&quot;Waaaah,&quot; the whole Shinji Circus Troupe runs away merrily down the hallway.</p><p>I&#39;m fairly certain they rehearsed all this beforehand.</p><hr><p>\u201CI shall not allow escape, Matou! Emiya, tell Fujimura-sensei that I went to deal with one of the Three Public Enemies of Homurabara!\u201D</p><p>And with an incredible speed Issei follows after them.</p><p>But even then, being an active member of the student council, he does not run.</p><p>His walking has already surpassed running.</p><hr><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015Sure.

Probably not.</p><p>As she&#39;s just gazing into the distance, random thoughts come to mind.</p><p>Yeah, no way. Saber&#39;s hometown must have been on the coast, too.</p><hr><p>\u201CThe sea in this country is calm, Shirou.\u201D</p><p>\u201CEh...? Yeah, because we&#39;re inland. If you go farther out, it does get rougher.\u201D</p><p>That is, on a peninsula that&#39;s breaking up the Pacific Ocean&#39;s Kuroshio current, as if rushing towards the rough waters of the Sea of Japan... That must be one magnificent sight.</p><p>Taking her to a place like that is one of my dreams.</p><hr><p>\u201CIn my hometown, the wind raged, and the sea bristled like the manes of a thousand galloping white horses.</p><p>Or, if you were to gaze at the faraway land from atop a white cliff, you would see a long coast shrouded in mist, running as far as the eye can see.\u201D</p><p>It is early in the fall, a calm day, yet Saber&#39;s words somehow brought that scenery to my mind.</p><p>Nothing like the docile ocean in front of us, but something harsh and solemn.</p><hr><p>...I steal a glance at Saber&#39;s face.</p><p>The conflicted memories of her hometown left a bittersweet taste in the air.</p><p>\u201CHad peace come to my country, I would have liked to see foreign countries by ship.</p><p>Knights from the continent often spoke of the golden plains of Gaul, the green hills of Hibernia where the people of Eire reside.</p><p>Or, perhaps, the distant lands from the songs that the bards weave. Our flag flying high above, I would have liked to see the cultures not yet known with my very own eyes.\u201D</p><hr><p>...I have no words to answer her with.</p><p>I have no right to speak of dreams she could not realize.</p><hr><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015Those are the kind of things that come to my mind.</p><p>I have been blessed. Having fond memories, not regrets.

For a hometown means the same to everyone.\u201D</p><hr><p>I nod at Saber&#39;s words.</p><p>There is not a single person who does not love the land they were born and raised in.</p><p>It may not be the kind of love one can express freely, but rather a subconscious instinct that one simply cannot defy.</p><p>However...</p><hr><p>Even then...</p><p>Beyond the ordinary, souls that hate everything must also exist.</p><hr><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><p>It must be the sun.</p><p>I feel a bit dizzy.</p><p>For once, I&#39;ve met Saber at the harbor, and ended up pondering about hometowns and things completely outside of my character.</p><p>Time for a change of pace.</p><hr><p>\u201COh, by the way. You do like fish, don&#39;t you, Saber?\u201D</p><p>\u201CYes, once particular parts are removed... Is there a fish market at this harbor, by chance?\u201D</p><p>\u201CThere isn&#39;t, sadly. Ah, but it sure would be nice to taste the season with some saury and yuzu.\u201D</p><p>\u201CThat is the spirit of this nation... Yes.\u201D</p><hr><p>Thus, the menu for tonight has been decided.</p><p>I&#39;d love to get some nice fatty ones, but, well, this season&#39;s fish is great no matter what.</p><p>And in the end, you could say that it is the cook&#39;s job to draw out the true flavor.</p><p>...But as you&#39;d expect, not a single guy is fishing all day long now.</p><hr><p>\u201CI am looking forward to it, Shirou.\u201D</p><p>\u201CYeah, I&#39;ll do my best, oh\u2015\u2015\u2015were you going somewhere?\u201D</p><p>\u201CNo, nowhere in particular.

Ah no, it&#39;s okay, right!\u201D</p><hr><p>...So is it okay or not - the reply isn&#39;t at all clear.</p><p>Does this &quot;okay&quot; mean &quot;yes, come in&quot;, or maybe &quot;okay, hold on&quot;...?</p><p>If I bothered her at a wrong time, wouldn&#39;t it be better to come back later...?</p><hr><p>\u201CHey, if you&#39;re busy, it can wait...\u201D</p><p>\u201CNo, no!

I came for, uh, some advice regarding lunch.</p><p>It&#39;s a bit early, but I thought we could get it done stress-free if we started ahead of time.\u201D</p><p>\u201CAh... T-Thank you.\u201D</p><p>\u201CUh... well, it&#39;s not something you should be thanking me for, but...\u201D</p><hr><p>Her shyness is contagious.</p><p>...How embarrassing.

Well then, please be my guest, Senpai.\u201D</p><p>\u201C...Sorry, it looked like you were kind of busy...\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CAhaha. That&#39;s not it, I just dozed off again.</p><p>But thanks to you, I finally woke up and will stop idling around!</p><p>...Um, so that&#39;s what the thanks was for... how about that...?\u201D</p><p>\u201CAh, I see. In that case, let&#39;s go on.\u201D</p><hr><p>If she puts it like that, there&#39;s no reason to refuse.</p><p>I sit down, smelling the barely noticeable sweet fragrance in the air.</p><p>Hey... is this perfume or a herb of some kind?</p><hr><p>\u201CAh... I guess I overdid it a bit?\u201D</p><p>\u201CHuh? Not really, both heater and air conditioner are...\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CI mean, you noticed the perfume too, Senpai\u2015\u2015\u2015I just used some fragrance.\u201D</p><hr><p>So it was perfume, after all.</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015I can&#39;t make out the brand, but it certainly does smell nice.

I think it suits you.\u201D</p><p>Actually, the only one who uses perfume in our house would be\u2015\u2015\u2015Tohsaka, I guess.

If I did, Saber and Mitsuzuri would probably consider it too effeminate, and get mad.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CMitsuzuri-senpai sure would be mad, wouldn&#39;t she. She idolizes you, you know.</p><p>But I still think it would suit you.</p><p>...I also wanted to give Rider some of her own, but she doesn&#39;t care much for it, either...\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CIt&#39;s really troublesome... but...\u201D</p><p>Sitting in Sakura&#39;s room, I started thinking.</p><p>Once I started chatting with Sakura, I thought about everyone staying here.</p><hr><p>\u201C...We just keep getting new residents.\u201D</p><p>\u201CYes, indeed... Each time I came by for a visit, I thought about how nice it is to have such a lively atmosphere, but I never thought it&#39;d grow this far.\u201D</p><hr><p>Sakura lets out a laugh.</p><p>...That&#39;s right, only Sakura and Fuji-Nee know what the Emiya household looked like before.</p><p>So much has changed, and so quickly\u2015\u2015\u2015should it be considered admirable or shocking?</p><hr><p>\u201CSomeone would leave and the house would be empty again, just like that.\u201D</p><p>I nod in agreement.</p><p>Fuji-Nee comes and goes, but doesn&#39;t live here. Sakura, too, was here for the mornings and evenings, yet never had lunch with everyone like this.</p><p>For a long time, I was the sole inhabitant here.</p><p>I didn&#39;t consider myself lonely, but looking back now...</p><hr><p>\u201CRight, hearing that you were the only one staying in such a huge residence was quite a big surprise at first.\u201D</p><p>...It&#39;s been over two years since.</p><p>Back then, Sakura was a diligent girl that never smiled. With a brooding face, she came over and told me she wanted to help out\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>\u201C...Is that so? But your house isn&#39;t exactly small, either.\u201D</p><p>\u201CNo, they are both large, but in different ways.</p><p>The Matou house was never a friendly place. Yet every room here is warm, pleading to be filled.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CSame with Rider. She is calm and content over here, and even Saber ought to feel the same way.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CIs that... so?</p><p>I have the feeling it&#39;s become a hostel, but with everyone splitting the chores, I guess it saves some effort.\u201D</p><p>\u201CBack in the day, cleaning was quite a chore, wasn&#39;t it, Senpai?\u201D</p><hr><p>Laughing, Sakura recalls the past.</p><p>...There are a lot of vacant rooms even now, but nothing like the empty warehouse we used to have.</p><p>A building without people in it deteriorates all too quickly.</p><p>Cleaning out the entire house used to be one huge task.</p><hr><p>\u201C...Yeah. The year-end cleaning doesn&#39;t sound so bad this time.\u201D</p><p>\u201CRider&#39;s really good at it, don&#39;t you think?</p><p>The house is in good hands, and it will be done before you know it!\u201D</p><p>Sakura puffs up with pride.</p><p>Rider likes to keep things neat and orderly, and what&#39;s more, has the brute strength for it. That&#39;s what she meant, probably\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>\u201CBut...\u201D</p><p>\u201CYes?\u201D</p><p>\u201CDon&#39;t you miss the peace and quiet we used to have, from time to time?\u201D</p><hr><p>The question just slipped out, somehow.</p><p>For no other reason than just having thought about it on the spot.</p><hr><p>\u201C...It&#39;s kind of a pity that we can&#39;t be alone together, I think.\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><hr><p>That&#39;s right.</p><p>In the mornings, before Fuji-Nee arrived, it was just the two of us, with Sakura often coming to the shed to wake me up.</p><p>Kind of a pity\u2015\u2015\u2015does that mean she actually wants just the two of us to get together?</p><hr><p>\u201C...I-I see.\u201D</p><p>I suddenly become flustered.</p><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><p>She may have been like a younger sister in the past, but now that she has all grown up, the older brother&#39;s role has become quite complicated...</p><hr><p>\u201C...............Mm.\u201D</p><p>I end up staring at the bed, trying to look away.</p><hr><p>\u201CB-But you know, Senpai! It&#39;s better when it&#39;s lively, after all! And we can cook a lot, too.\u201D</p><p>\u201CY-Yeah, you&#39;re right!\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CGetting your turn for the bath is a bit difficult, and there&#39;s a lot of laundry to do, but it&#39;s all fine, really!\u201D</p><p>\u201CYeah, that too, let&#39;s take care of it together!\u201D</p><hr><p>Mutual agreement is reached with much excitement.</p><p>Sakura seems to be putting on airs to hide her quickened pulse, just the same as me... I guess?</p><hr><p>\u201C......Um.</p><p>Senpai, do you miss the quiet old days?\u201D</p><p>\u201CAh\u2015\u2015\u2015No, I don&#39;t think so.</p><p>What&#39;s gone is gone, and now is now. There&#39;s plenty of good and bad about both, I think.\u201D</p><p>No, that isn&#39;t right, either.</p><p>There aren&#39;t really any bad things about the present.</p><hr><p>\u201CYes, I agree... Really, I wouldn&#39;t mind if it was even busier than now.\u201D</p><p>\u201CHaha. Just who would the newcomer be, I wonder...?\u201D</p><p>Maybe Issei? Although I don&#39;t picture him coming down from the mountain and rolling in.</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015But you never know, even Tohsaka started visiting recently.</p><hr><p>\u201CWho knows, maybe Illya-chan and Fujimura-sensei will move here?\u201D</p><p>\u201CUgh... Illya would be problematic.\u201D</p><p>Those maids will also come if she does, so we&#39;ll be up by three. Just about full capacity.</p><hr><p>And then, something hits me.</p><p>\u201CBut, either way, Sakura...\u201D</p><p>\u201CYes?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CWhether we gain or lose more mouths, the kitchen team&#39;s duties are still the same, and expectations high. Let&#39;s make sure we meet them.\u201D</p><p>The population growth failed to bring in reinforcements for the cooking ranks.</p><p>No, perhaps there were too many cooks in the first place.</p><hr><p>\u201CRight, I guess we do have a reputation to keep.\u201D</p><p>\u201CAnd fall is when appetites grow, too.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C...That it is.</p><p>I still have a lot to learn from you, Senpai.\u201D</p><p>As we were talking, my stomach got empty.</p><p>Sounds about time.</p><hr><p>\u201CSakura. What should we do for lunch?\u201D</p><p>\u201CLet&#39;s decide once we get to the kitchen.</p><p>Because no dish is a challenge for the two of us.\u201D</p><p>\u201CI-Is that right?</p><p>Then I&#39;ll go find out who&#39;ll be joining us for lunch.\u201D</p><hr><p>I stand up and leave the room together with Sakura.</p><p>There isn&#39;t much to add.

I have to say though, this feels like an issue of a different caliber.</p><hr><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015I give up. You amaze me.\u201D</p><p>\u201CPraise from a youngster ain&#39;t gonna cut it.</p><p>Is this all you wanted to chat about? Then I&#39;ll go back to fishing. I got a feeling I&#39;ve a big catch coming up.\u201D</p><p>With that, Lancer went back to fishing, as if nothing happened.</p><hr><p>Satisfied with the information acquired, I leave the harbor.</p><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015Yeah, but you know what?\u201D</p><p>&quot;There&#39;s no need to hate the enemy,&quot; that&#39;s what Lancer was saying.</p><p>That battle and emotion are separate from each other.</p><p>But, on the other hand...</p><p>It doesn&#39;t matter if the enemy is a relative or a loved one. As long as they&#39;re an enemy, they will be killed... That&#39;s what he was also saying.</p><hr><h3 id="emiya-residence\u30FBstart-of-night-things-to-do-1" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#emiya-residence\u30FBstart-of-night-things-to-do-1" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Emiya Residence\u30FBStart of Night Things to do</h3><h3 id="night\u30FBstreets-at-night-patrol-2" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#night\u30FBstreets-at-night-patrol-2" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Night\u30FBStreets at night (patrol)</h3><h3 id="night\u30FBpeace-and-quiet-2" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#night\u30FBpeace-and-quiet-2" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Night\u30FBPeace and quiet (2)</h3><hr><p>There doesn&#39;t seem to be anything wrong here.</p><p>No signs of life in this district is business as usual.</p><p>No screams nearby, and no howling beasts, either.</p><p>Perhaps due to the white moonlight, I can see the town much clearer than usual.</p><hr><p>\u201CEverything&#39;s fine.

This is rather suspicious. What&#39;s up with someone like her suddenly coming out in broad daylight just to sweep the steps?</p><hr><p>\u201COh my, if it isn&#39;t the boy. What brings you here today?\u201D</p><p>\u201C...So, even you get dragged into cleaning.\u201D</p><p>It kind of caught me by surprise.</p><p>...Well, perhaps it shouldn&#39;t have.

Is there a problem?\u201D</p><p>\u201CWhile in that outfit... um, is that all right?\u201D</p><p>Other stuff\u2015\u2015\u2015like her plain clothes she wears into town.</p><p>I mean, those won&#39;t seem out of place, and it would look like some random parishioner busy with sweeping.</p><hr><p>\u201CWhat&#39;s your point?\u201D</p><p>\u201COh, nothing... Right, isn&#39;t there a gate keeper? Why not ask him to sweep?\u201D</p><p>Isn&#39;t Assassin Sasaki Kojiro always standing by the temple gate?</p><hr><p>\u201C......Aaah.\u201D</p><p>She lets out a theatrical sigh, as if to underscore the point.</p><hr><p>\u201CIf only that man had a shred of gallantry, I wouldn&#39;t have to go through all this trouble.\u201D</p><p>\u201CBut he&#39;s always idling around.\u201D</p><p>\u201CYes, idling around. I told him many times already, at least go sweep the grounds if you have nothing to do.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CGood-for-nothing sponger, his mouth is his only skill.</p><p>&quot;It&#39;s too bad I&#39;m only a spirit, no real body of my own. I would not object if you gave me an order, but would that not be contrary to your style? Adopting physical form and sweeping requires magical energy. Compare that to the amount of magical energy spent when the Master herself is holding the broom, which is greater? Need I say more?&quot;</p><p>That&#39;s the crap he keeps telling me! What do you think of that, boy!?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C..................\u201D</p><p>Seems like having minions can be tiring, too.</p><p>On top of that, Assassin&#39;s logic is impenetrable.</p><p>Nevermind her looks, underneath those robes is a true old-fashioned magus that would make Tohsaka look like a lowly amateur in comparison.</p><p>Ever frugal, she wouldn&#39;t use magical energy frivolously. Truly, it&#39;s far too inefficient to make Servants materialize and do grunt work.</p><hr><p>\u201C...Ha. Perhaps I should have summoned a youngster&#39;s spirit, perceptive and obedient.</p><p>Just like you, boy\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><p>Caster looks me over from head to toe.</p><p>...Whoa, my body temperature dropped for a moment just now.</p><hr><p>\u201CWouldn&#39;t it be great to have a young guy who can cook, clean, and do laundry as a familiar...?\u201D</p><p>\u201C...Umm... thanks.\u201D</p><p>Is she praising me, or is she making fun of the fact that I&#39;m useless as a magus? I think it&#39;s a bit of both.</p><p>Caster suddenly looks up at the gate with an unpleasant expression.</p><hr><p>\u201CYou listening, Assassin?\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015Mm-hmm.\u201D</p><p>He&#39;s nowhere in sight, only his voice is present.</p><hr><p>\u201CThat&#39;s you we&#39;re talking about. You, the good-for-nothing idler that sleeps all day long, is far less useful than even this boy right here, get my drift?\u201D</p><p>\u201CSplendid. Indeed, a swordsman is not one whose services should be needed. Rather, the true samurai ought to be farming the fields, raising wheat. There is no arguing the fact that this boy is more useful than me.\u201D</p><p>Kojiro&#39;s tone is as carefree as always, even as Caster&#39;s starting to lose it. It&#39;s hard to tell if those two are really a Master and Servant.</p><hr><p>\u201COr, perhaps you would like to use a Command Spell?\u201D</p><p>\u201CKuh\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><p>\u201CHaha, nice expression. It&#39;s been a while since I&#39;ve seen that face of yours\u2015\u2015\u2015You have become too happy and relaxed lately, and I find it rather uninteresting.\u201D</p><p>...Kojiro continues to tease her.</p><p>I did think that his words always had thorns in them, but he&#39;s taking it to a whole new level with Caster.</p><hr><p>\u201CHmph, that&#39;s all right, just keep doing your job as a doorman. The original idea was to demote you to a janitor if you don&#39;t do your work properly.\u201D</p><p>\u201CHahaha. Right, I will devote my whole self to this duty.\u201D</p><p>Kojiro&#39;s voice stops.</p><p>...It&#39;s hard to interject when they&#39;re fighting.</p><hr><p>\u201CJust like that, boy. Do you understand now?\u201D</p><p>\u201CClear as day... Do you need a hand?\u201D</p><p>It kind of bothers me, so I asked.</p><p>Did I just say something entirely unexpected?</p><hr><p>\u201C...I had a hunch for a while now, boy. You really can&#39;t tell what&#39;s going on around you, can you? Say you do help me. Now Saber, who&#39;s already treating me like a sworn enemy, will be boiling with rage, no?\u201D</p><p>\u201CSaber won&#39;t get mad if I just help with sweeping. Sweeping the stairs all the way to the bottom would be quite tedious, right? So...\u201D</p><p>So do you... need help?</p><p>It&#39;s not like I have anything else to do, and a bit of help isn&#39;t enough to invoke heaven&#39;s wrath on me.</p><hr><p>Caster sighs again.</p><p>\u201C...That lass sure found herself a handy apprentice.\u201D</p><p>\u201CThat lass... Tohsaka? She sure orders me around.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CAh, it&#39;d be best if I refuse.</p><p>Should Issei find us going at it together, we&#39;re bound to have another quarrel.\u201D</p><p>\u201CI see, too bad.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CIt just can&#39;t be helped if it&#39;s you, boy. Now had it been Souichirou-sama, it&#39;d be a whole different show.\u201D</p><p>Kuzuki-sensei with a broom\u2015\u2015\u2015sweeping silently without a word. Somehow, it&#39;s really easy to imagine.</p><p>And with Caster by his side. A wife doing her husband&#39;s bidding, a classic scene.</p><hr><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015Heh.\u201D</p><p>Sarcastic laughter emerges from the top of the gate.</p><hr><p>\u201CJust what are you laughing at, Assassin!?\u201D</p><p>\u201CThat, exactly that. Souichirou-sama this, Souichirou-sama that, the way you&#39;re enamored with the man almost makes me sick. Good thing I have a bucket handy.\u201D</p><p>\u201CBalderdash\u2015\u2015\u2015a-and what&#39;s this about being enamored? I will not let you insult Souichirou-sama in this manner!\u201D</p><p>\u201COh dear, excuse me for being a hooligan who doesn&#39;t know how to serve his master properly.</p><p>I haven&#39;t the slightest clue on how to treat the master of my master.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CGet down here, Assassin. I have a few things to tell you this time.\u201D</p><p>\u201COh, that&#39;s fine with me, but your sweeping is about to stall there, correct?\u201D</p><p>\u201CI will leave the part in front of the gate to you. Time is precious and I&#39;m very busy. I still need to mop the floor in the main temple.\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015Today&#39;s the cleaning day, is it?\u201D</p><hr><p>Mopping the main temple floor has got to be a pretty big task.</p><p>I&#39;ll make sure to catch Issei and suggest that we tackle it together.</p><hr><p>\u201CGET YOUR ASS DOWN HERE!\u201D</p><p>\u201CDon&#39;t be hasty...\u201D</p><hr><p>Looks like I&#39;m not needed here.</p><p>With a light nod, I pass through the gate and step onto the temple grounds.</p><hr><h3 id="school\u30FBday-4-11-flip-flop-2" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#school\u30FBday-4-11-flip-flop-2" aria-hidden="true">#</a> School\u30FBDay 4-11 Flip-flop 2</h3><hr><p>After finishing lunch, I walk through the school building.</p><p>Even though it&#39;s a day off, I can still see people here and there.</p><p>It&#39;s probably the students who are working hard for their clubs.
