He completely has no interest in being liked by others, and is incapable of discovering his own worth. Due to that, he does not have the outlook of enjoying one&#39;s own live. Described briefly, he is an &quot;abusive pessimistic author&quot;.</p><p>Ha had never managed to gain what he desired during his live, not a single thing. One can consider that that personality of his is the cause for that.</p><p>Andersen looks as if he hates anything and everything in this world, but at his root his character is one that is good at taking care of others. Should others depend on him, he would answer them to the limit of his ability.</p><p>He is methodical like an author is, and perfect in aftercare as well. Due to that, if one can bear even his abusive tongue, one can say that he is a Servant worthy of trust. While he maybe a pessimist, he will never laugh at the effort of others in &quot;living correctly&quot; and &quot;accomplishing things with all their might&quot;.</p><p>Because that is the form of ideal world that he, who had continued on composing his career, had once dreamt of and wished for.</p><h2 id="attitude-towards-master" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#attitude-towards-master" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Attitude Towards Master</h2><p>He has no ability in combat, declaring that he is a faulty good of a Servant and saying &quot;I am not useful in the slightest!&quot; aggressively at every opportunity.</p><p>If one carelessly praise his work, then not only he would say that a fan would definitely not want to know him and return back any opinions and complaints, but also keeps on making excuse and abuse the Master with &quot;You dumbass!&quot; Truly a pain in the ass of a Servant.</p><p>Whether the Master accept his attitude as &quot;abandoning responsibility to fight&quot; and &quot;insubordination&quot;, or instead as complete sincerety, depends on how the Master takes it to heart.</p><p>Andersen has no wish towards the Holy Grail. However, he would keep on saying things like &quot;Since you&#39;ve summoned me, I&#39;ll work, but honestly speaking I really, REALLY don&#39;t want to work&quot; as he continues to help the Master, resulting in a complex and guniguni* sort of distortion, like a straight stick crooked in water.

A third-rate Servant, Andersen.<br> Still, that&#39;s the face of an ordinary person, so ordinary that it amazes me.

I&#39;d say that foolishness is a sin, but being thrown away to this world as an ordinary one is a windfall. In any rate, good and evil is both something you can enjoy!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Let us disparage the value of human earnestly.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Even assuming life have values.

He was born as a son of a cobbler, he had planned to become an actor but gave up without showing any result. He then set his eyes on becoming a poet but was valued harshly.</p><p>Finally, with the money he gained from his self-published books he proceeded on leaving the country. He was thirty by the time he had finally been recognized in the world with his book, &quot;The Improvisatore&quot;, which was written with the inspiration he had earned during his time outside of the country. Afterwards, he switched to become a fairy tale author, but his fairy tale is by nature filled with mayhem and sorrow, poverty, and colored with the literary style that paints death as salvation.</p><p>He borrows that shape of fairy tale and keeps on writing the despair of utter grief from poverty and how that there&#39;s no other escape from it than death. All the while covering every thoughts that whirls within his own heart with those beautiful sentences.</p><p>His work includes &quot;The Ugly Duckling&quot;, &quot;The Snow Queen&quot;, &quot;The Little Match Girl&quot;, and others.</p><p>He was single his whole life.
