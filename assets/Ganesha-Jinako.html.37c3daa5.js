Her creation process is full of mysteries. To be honest, she&#39;s full of minor glitches.<br> The name on her Saint Graph\u2019s profile displays what\u2019s believed to be the name of the human mage serving as the host but for some reason the data is conceptually corrupted in a way no one can read the name.<br> For that reason, the Chaldea staff, Master included, decided to call her \u201CMr. Ganesha\u201D since that\u2019s what she was calling herself.<br> It\u2019s actually not confirmed that the Divine Spirit inside her really is the Indian god Ganesha.</p><p>In rare occasions, people with implied connections to her randomly say her name, but they can only do so unconsciously, and the others never process her name as a word.<br> Due to the Extra Class she\u2019s manifested in, it\u2019s easy to deduce which superior AI is somehow involved in her creation\u2026 but the truth is still hidden in the darkness, or perhaps in the Inner Moon of another world.</p><p>Ganesha, the Indian god she claims to be inside her, is said to be the son of Shiva and Parvati.<br> To be more exact, Parvati created him from the filth on her body.<br> Parvati made him to stand guard and not let anyone pass while she was bathing. And that\u2019s when Shiva came in.<br> Since Ganesha didn\u2019t know Shiva was Parvati\u2019s husband, he stopped him. And since Shiva didn\u2019t know about Ganesha either, he feel into rage for being treated like that and ripped Ganesha\u2019s head off.<br> Parvati lamented her son\u2019s death and Shiva promised he would bring their son back to life, but he couldn\u2019t find the head.<br> For that reason, Shiva revived him with the head of the first elephant he found\u2026 And that\u2019s the most well-known reason for the elephant head.</p><p>Ganesha is the god of fortune and prosperity, the god of learning (it\u2019s said that the Mahabharata was made by him writing down the story the Rishi Vyasa was verbally narrating), and the god of obstacles later turned the ** god who removes obstacles**.</p><h2 id="role-in-the-game" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#role-in-the-game" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Role in the game</h2><p>The Servant summoned by the Counter Force to confront the Indian Lostbelt.<br> Due to her manifestation having special circumstances in both the vessel\u2019s selection and the land she was summoned in, it\u2019s fair to assume that she possessed a variety of cheat codes like the aforementioned name bug.</p><p>\u201CWhat the heck, why this black sheep treatment?
