This included Mozart&#39;s best pupil, S\xFCssmayr, as well as Mozart&#39;s son Franz Xaver Wolfgang Mozart and even Beethoven.</p><p>However, sometime around 1820, the rumor that Salieri had killed Mozart started to spread all over the world. Even though it was untrue, people kept imagining this story where &#39;the genius loved by god was murdered by a jealous and hateful prodigy&#39;.</p><p>The now old Salieri told his pupil Moscheles &#39;that is nothing but vile slander&#39;, but people even took that as a confession of the crime. Later there were even rumors that a regretful Salieri had taken his own life by cutting his throat with a knife.</p><p>And now, after long time passed, Salieri&#39;s existence has become warped by the unjustified rumors. His existence has also become fused with the mysterious man in grey, who is also related to Amadeus&#39; last days, and has materialized as a Servant in this way.</p><p>An anti-hero that kills people.</p><p>A pitiful man. A furious man. The man who must kill he who was loved by god.</p><p>A single innocent monster.</p><hr><p>Due to his origin, Salieri is a violent and aggressive Servant, and must be treated with care.</p><p>Usually, communication with him would also prove difficult, as Salieri&#39;s humanity also turned into ash, but that wasn&#39;t entirely the case within the lostbelt.</p><p>This is due to the lostbelt being a world separated from panhuman history...A world that didn&#39;t scorch Salieri into his avenger form...It would seem that this allowed some of his humanity to remain.</p><h2 id="related-characters" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#related-characters" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Related Characters</h2><p><strong>Amadeus Wolfgang Mozart</strong></p><p>...</p><p>...</p><p>Stop coming near me.</p><p>Stop looking at me.</p><p>Stop laughing at me.</p><p>Stop playing music.</p><p>I am the one who will kill you.</p><p>Your honor, your music, any last trace of you, I will destroy it all.</p><p>Now that you&#39;ve finally appeared in this world, I shall finally kill you with my own hands.</p><p>Gottlieb, the man loved by god.</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette</strong></p><p>It seems I owe some gratitude to your brother...Or do I...</p><p>No, wait, I...I...</p><p>Who am I...?</p><p>Sorry.</p><p>I&#39;m sorry.</p><p>Oh queen, you are god&#39;s grace...</p><p><strong>Phantom/Caster Gilles/Salome</strong></p><p>They don&#39;t get along.</p><p><strong>Edmond Dantes</strong></p><p>They get along.</p><p><strong>Jeanne d&#39;Arc</strong></p><p>They don&#39;t get along.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter</strong></p><p>They get along.</p><h2 id="comment-from-the-illustrator" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#comment-from-the-illustrator" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Comment from the Illustrator</h2><p>Salieri&#39;s eyes were originally supposed to be gold, but the color of red flames conceptually reflected upon his being and changed their color. Conversely, Amadeus&#39; were originally silver, but then changed to sky blue or green, something like that? In regards to the Wailing Facade, the original plan was that Amadeus had created his very own grim reaper from things he was scared of, so the broader origin of the design were the black armor that the knight captain&#39;s ghost (who was presented as a father figure) wore in the movie, as well as the neck part of archbishop Colloredo&#39;s clothes. I guess Salieri&#39;s build in his third stage is closer to a bird or a dinosaur, huh. There was also a plan for Salieri to use his wings as speakers or sound amplifiers when he spread them. (PFALZ)</p><p>Salieri and the Man in Grey show up as sort of relatives or acquaintances of Amadeus, but actually the reason why Amadeus&#39; design is so gaudy is because his design was based on the idea of the Man in Grey. &quot;There is a legend that Amadeus was killed by a grey reaper&quot;, starting from that I started thinking about other things, like &#39;grey days&#39;, &#39;rationalism&#39;, &#39;melancholy&#39;, &#39;not partaking in pleasure and simply living is the best choice&#39;...all those &#39;colorless&#39; concepts that Amadeus would appear to oppose pretty much ended up making me design him to be flashy and needlessly gaudy. The request I got for Salieri&#39;s human form was &#39;a sophisticated dandy man&#39;. So while I was at it I remember having a lot of fun designing my own unique brands for him.
