There are so many stores open along the main street here. It&#39;s a sight for sore eyes.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You seem to be in a fine mood, Saber.</p><p><strong>Saber Lily:</strong><br> Yes. It is true that we are in enemy territory, but it is still pleasant to observe people going about their daily lives.</p><p><strong>Saber Lily:</strong><br> ...Admittedly, it does pain me to see France and England at war during this era.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Want to get something to eat?</p><p><strong>Saber Lily:</strong><br> Oh, thank you.</p><p><strong>Saber Lily:</strong><br> I appreciate the thought, but for now I am content just to breathe the air here.</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I see. You look so young that I forgot your royal status.<br> I guess your first concern is the town&#39;s safety.</p><p><strong>Saber Lily:</strong><br> Oh...Yes, that&#39;s right. I will be a king someday,<br> so I need to properly understand how things work here...</p><p><strong>Saber Lily:</strong><br> I apologize for acting like a tourist.<br> There is still so much I need to learn...</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I-I&#39;m sorry, I didn&#39;t mean...<br> It&#39;s just, this is all so hard to take in.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> She&#39;s a serious, kind girl,<br> but we&#39;ve all seen a different side to her...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You mean the &quot;Dark Saber&quot; in Fuyuki?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It&#39;s true they share physical characteristics, but they aren&#39;t the same Saber.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> They are nothing alike.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> You&#39;re right. Even if they&#39;re the same entity,<br> she has nothing to do with that Dark Saber.</p><hr><p><strong>Saber Lily:</strong><br> Someone who resembles me?<br> I&#39;m curious. What was she like?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Oh, what a pure smile... It seems like she has no idea just how terrifying her other self was...</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou!</p><p><strong>Saber Lily:</strong><br> I don&#39;t recognize this familiar.<br> ...Yet, I feel like I have some recollection of it...</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Fou says, &quot;Don&#39;t worry about your other self!&quot;</p><p><strong>Saber Lily:</strong><br> I see...but it&#39;s unsettling, isn&#39;t it?<br> That &quot;other self&quot; isn&#39;t very nice.</p><p><strong>Saber Lily:</strong><br> I mean, if the person in question is my future self, I was hoping to get some advice that might make my life a little easier.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Advice?<br> Saber, you&#39;re still in training, right?</p><p><strong>Saber Lily:</strong><br> Yes. Although I chose to walk the path of swordsmanship, I was serving my brother up until this point.</p><p><strong>Saber Lily:</strong><br> Now I continue to polish my swordsmanship and broaden my horizons.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I see. Not just an aspiring knight, but also a king in the making. As far as I can see, your skills are already impeccable...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...Hey Fujimaru, there&#39;s something about her that&#39;s been bothering me for a while now. Can I ask her?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Go ahead, Doctor.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Feel free to dig your own grave Doctor.</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Well then, if I may ...Ahem Saber, this is a bit of a direct question, but...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> What&#39;s up with those clothes?<br> I mean, isn&#39;t that skirt kind of short?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Doctor! We were trying to ignore that.<br> Did you really have to say it out loud?</p><p><strong>Saber Lily:</strong><br> Th-These clothes?<br> I see, indeed...They somewhat concern me as well.</p><p><strong>Saber Lily:</strong><br> I am not used to wearing such feminine clothes...<br> But Merlin suggested it would help mask my identity.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Merlin! The mage who served King Arthur,<br> the protector of Britain!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Who knew such a legendary figure would press his taste upon you?</p><p><strong>Saber Lily:</strong><br> Yes. I weave my own magical energy into armor,<br> but he told me not to rely on it.</p><p><strong>Saber Lily:</strong><br> He said I get to be more reckless now, that I should fight more freely and lightly.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...I see. One could expect no less from Merlin,<br> the famed kingmaker.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> True, seeing Saber in her current state, not many could guess she would one day rule over Britain as the King of Knights.</p><p><strong>Saber Lily:</strong><br> R-Really? Someone like me will rule...No, I mustn&#39;t show weakness! Of course, I will do everything I can to be worthy of that position.</p><p><strong>Townsperson:</strong><br> The castle gates are about to be breached!<br> Everyone, run for your lives!</p><p><strong>Saber Lily:</strong><br> Hmm, sounds like trouble at the gates. Judging from the noise, I imagine it&#39;s an enemy attack.</p><p><strong>Saber Lily:</strong><br> Unfortunately, it seems our brief break ends here.<br> Let&#39;s go, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Saber Lily:</strong><br> No matter the era, even if it&#39;s an enemy territory,<br> no one should be allowed to disturb this peace.</p><p><strong>Saber Lily:</strong><br> I, Saber Lily, vow to protect you as a proud Heroic Spirit!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Saber Lily:</strong><br> Oh, it seems like we left town during combat.<br> The gates...have been shut behind us.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> No use blaming the townspeople, they&#39;re trying to survive. We&#39;re just drifters, looking out for ourselves.</p><p><strong>Saber Lily:</strong><br> Yes. For now, I am just happy to be able to travel with Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Saber Lily:</strong><br> I still have a lot to learn, but...as we fight together, I want you to teach me as much as possible.</p><p><strong>Saber Lily:</strong><br> If I&#39;m with you I won&#39;t give up, and I know that I can continue to fight for my ideals.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Of course.</p><p><strong>Saber Lily:</strong><br> I&#39;m glad...<br> Thank you, Master.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> When you&#39;re king, don&#39;t forget my rewards.</p><p><strong>Saber Lily:</strong><br> R-Rewards, you say?<br> Yes, anything within my capabilities\u2014</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou!</p><p><strong>Saber Lily:</strong><br> Oh, it seems Fou is opposed to this idea...<br> I thought that a king could return favors easily...</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Sorry, but we should get moving. If we stay here too long, the soldiers might come down from the gates.</p><p><strong>Saber Lily:</strong><br> Yes.<br> We shouldn&#39;t needlessly alarm them.</p><p><strong>Saber Lily:</strong><br> Let&#39;s continue our training, Master.<br> I&#39;ll devote myself to becoming a great king!</p>', 78);
