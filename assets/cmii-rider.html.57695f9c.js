She possesses agility, skills, and<br> several Noble Phantasms worthy of the Rider<br> class and is easily among the top Servants in<br> terms of overall ability. Since Sakura had no<br> intention of fighting anyone, she transferred her<br> control of Rider to her brother Shinji. As a result,<br> Rider was technically Shinji&#39;s Servant whenever<br> she appeared before Shirou.</p><p>Rider&#39;s main weapon is a nail attached to a<br> chain, and she maneuvers gracefully through the<br> air while piercing her opponent with the nail in<br> order to reduce their mobility. Of her three Noble<br> Phantasms, the most potent in terms of offensive<br> capability is the Bellerophon, which allows her<br> legendary mount Pegasus to use an extremely<br> powerful charge. Aside from her Noble Phantasms,<br> possesses Cybele, the Mystic Eyes of<br> Petrification. Since Cybele&#39;s effect is constant and<br> out of Rider&#39;s direct control, she usually wears<br> Mystic Eye Killers in order to seal Cybele&#39;s effect.</p><p>Though usually stoic and aloof, Rider is not<br> thoughtless or without feelings. If anything, she<br> tends to overthink things. When Rider sees how<br> Sakura lives her life oppressed by others, the<br> Servant cannot help but compare Sakura&#39;s suffering<br> to the way she herself had suffered at the hands of<br> the Gods. This empathy Rider feels for Sakura<br> means she is very serious when it comes to her<br> concerns regarding Sakura&#39;s well-being. Rider&#39;s<br> bewitching presence and flawless proportions are<br> two more characteristics she shares in common with<br> Sakura, as Sakura also has an enviable body even<br> if she tends to hide it.</p><h2 id="character-data-006" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#character-data-006" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Character Data 006</h2><table><thead><tr><th style="text-align:left;">Bio</th><th style="text-align:center;">Details</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style="text-align:left;">Affiliation</td><td style="text-align:center;">Sakura Matou&#39;s Servant</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align:left;">TRUE NAME:</td><td style="text-align:center;">Meudsa</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align:left;">GENDER:</td><td style="text-align:center;">Female</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align:left;">HEIGHT:</td><td style="text-align:center;">172cm</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align:left;">WEIGHT:</td><td style="text-align:center;">57kg</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align:left;">MEASUREMENTS:</td><td style="text-align:center;">B88/W56/H84</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align:left;">THEME COLOR:</td><td style="text-align:center;">Black</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align:left;">TALENTS:</td><td style="text-align:center;">Using machinery, riding, acrobatics, stalking</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align:left;">LIKES:</td><td style="text-align:center;">Alcohol, reading, snakes</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align:left;">DISLIKES:</td><td style="text-align:center;">Mirrors, body measurements</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align:left;">RIVALS:</td><td style="text-align:center;">Saber, Kojiro, Souichirou Kuzuki</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align:left;">ORIGIN:</td><td style="text-align:center;">Greece</td></tr></tbody></table><h3 id="relationship-chart" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#relationship-chart" aria-hidden="true">#</a> RELATIONSHIP CHART</h3><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/L28Hkbs.jpg" alt=""></p><p>Sakura is the one who actually summoned<br> Rider, and is therefore Rider&#39;s true Master. Even<br> after Shinji was granted control over Rider, the<br> Servant viewed Sakura as her one and only<br> Master. Though Rider did not think for a moment<br> that Shinji was in any way a positive presence in<br> Sakura&#39;s life, the Servant dutifully obeyed Shinji<br> because the transfer of control was done through<br> the use of Command Spells - and because such<br> was Sakura&#39;s wish. Rider&#39;s absolute obedience<br> quickly inflated Shinji&#39;s ego, but Rider had<br> absolutely no interest in him and couldn&#39;t care less<br> about his state of mind.</p><p>Certain story choices can lead to Rider sucking<br> Ayako Mitsuzuri&#39;s blood, after which the Servant<br> seems to take a liking to her.</p><hr><h1 id="character-discussion-with-kinoko-nasu-takashi-takeuchi" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#character-discussion-with-kinoko-nasu-takashi-takeuchi" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Character Discussion with Kinoko Nasu &amp; Takashi Takeuchi</h1><h3 id="the-catalyst-for-rider-s-birth" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#the-catalyst-for-rider-s-birth" aria-hidden="true">#</a> THE CATALYST FOR RIDER&#39;S BIRTH</h3><p><strong>TAKEUCHI:</strong> Rider&#39;s one of the rare cases where<br> the design changed quite a bit between the early<br> drafts and the final design.</p><p><strong>NASU:</strong> The early drafts actually lived on to<br> become Ayako... and I don&#39;t want to hear<br> anything about her eyebrows being thick! I saw a<br> movie called &quot;Vidocq&quot;, and I was totally charmed<br> by the mirror-masked killer in it. I just really liked<br> the way he moved and hid using his black cloak.<br> I wanted to reproduce that feeling in the game, so<br> I figured we could have a Rider with disheveled<br> hair wearing a long robe. But then Takeuchi drew<br> up the base design for the current Rider just on a<br> lark, and even I had to admit it was the better<br> design. That illustration of Rider where her face is<br> angled down and to the side... that&#39;s the one that<br> captured my heart.</p><p><strong>TAKEUCHI:</strong> So how did we decide on Medusa<br> as an identity for Rider again? Was it because we<br> were talking about the lack of a &quot;sexy&quot; type<br> character?</p><p><strong>NASU:</strong> Yes, that&#39;s right. Rider was originally a<br> male character, but we realized we didn&#39;t have<br> enough female characters for a bishojo game.<br> The original concept for Rider was a masterless<br> &quot;stray&quot; Servant whose true name was Perseus,<br> from Greek mythology. By the time he made his<br> first appearance, his Master was long dead. The<br> concept took two or three different turns before it<br> finally settled into the current Rider.</p><p><strong>TAKEUCHI:</strong> When we reviewed the Servants in<br> search of one that could be changed into a<br> female, Berserker was out of the question and<br> Assassin&#39;s identity as Kojiro was basically the<br> punch line for his character, so that left Rider.</p><p><strong>NASU:</strong> But there weren&#39;t any legendary heroines<br> with ties to Pegasus, so we selected Medusa, who<br> gave birth to Pegasus, as Rider&#39;s new identity.</p><p><strong>TAKEUCHI:</strong> We originally had no intention of<br> releasing any information about Rider prior to the<br> game&#39;s launch, but when the launch was delayed<br> by about a month, we suddenly found ourselves<br> in need of more material to fill the gap. We<br> reluctantly unveiled Medusa, but we didn&#39;t reveal<br> the details of her character, like the fact that she<br> was a Servant.</p><p><strong>NASU:</strong> We imagined most people would assume<br> she was Assassin, and we were quite pleased to<br> let them think that.</p><p><strong>TAKEUCHI:</strong> Indeed, we were quite successful on<br> that front. I mean, after seeing that nail...</p><p><strong>NASU:</strong> No one would guess it was Rider!</p><p><strong>TAKEUCHI:</strong> The best part was that the magazine<br> [Rider was revealed in] added the tagline &quot;Sexy<br> Fighting Lady&quot;. How great is that!?</p><p><strong>NASU:</strong> I love it. (laughs)</p><hr><h3 id="regarding-rider-s-character-design" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#regarding-rider-s-character-design" aria-hidden="true">#</a> REGARDING RIDER&#39;S CHARACTER DESIGN</h3><p><strong>TAKEUCHI:</strong> The main thing I was conscious of<br> with Rider&#39;s design was the fact that I didn&#39;t want<br> her outfit to turn out looking obscene. I leaned<br> more toward a snug-fitting bodysuit rather than a<br> sexually charged leather suit.</p><p><strong>NASU:</strong> I do recall that when I asked you if her<br> outfit was leather, you said &quot;no&quot; with quite a bit<br> of fervor.</p><p><strong>TAKEUCHI:</strong> I may not have wanted the suit itself<br> to be leather, but I did imagine the bindings to be<br> leather. I thought those little accents being made<br> of leather might add a touch of elegance without<br> making her look like a dominatrix.<br> range</p><p><strong>NASU:</strong> I see. As a side note, Rider was initially<br> supposed to have a height somewhere in the<br> of 175~180cm, but we were worried that<br> PC gamers might not find such a tall woman<br> particularly appealing, so we compromised at<br> 172cm.</p><p><strong>TAKEUCHI:</strong> I imagine she wouldn&#39;t have such a<br> wide appeal if we set her height in the 180cm<br> range.</p><p><strong>NASU:</strong> But you know, I did get some feedback<br> suggesting that more than a few of our players<br> were surprised that she was &quot;so short&quot; since I had<br> emphasized her height in the original &quot;stay night&quot;<br> material.</p><p><strong>TAKEUCHI:</strong> Personally, I think somewhere<br> around 170cm was just the right height to make<br> her self-conscious about her height without<br> making her a giant.</p><p><strong>NASU:</strong> You&#39;re right. I suppose any girl over<br> 170cm in height is plenty tall. I think tall women<br> are cool, but I do wonder if I should have eased<br> up on that a bit.</p><p><strong>TAKEUCHI:</strong> I think it&#39;s fine. Rider&#39;s height is what<br> makes her unique, and it was precisely her height<br> that made that awesome pose at Ryuudouji<br> Temple during Sakura&#39;s route possible.</p><p><strong>NASU:</strong> That was one of the rare cases where I,<br> as the writer, made a specific request about the<br> visual aspect. I asked them to give her &quot;an<br> arachnid pose&quot;.</p><hr><h3 id="rider-s-feelings-about-her-master" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#rider-s-feelings-about-her-master" aria-hidden="true">#</a> RIDER&#39;S FEELINGS ABOUT HER MASTER</h3><p><strong>NASU:</strong> I saw Rider as a Doberman, fierce and<br> scary but beautiful and loyal. Rider considered<br> Sakura to be her true Master, so when Sakura<br> wanted Rider to obey Shinji instead, Rider did so<br> dutifully despite her personal feelings. But even<br> Rider had her limits in dealing with a jerk like<br> Shinji... (laughs)</p><p><strong>TAKEUCHI:</strong> She does come off as a very loyal<br> individual.</p><p><strong>NASU:</strong> Rider initially had a military theme, so<br> she&#39;s definitely not the kind of person who<br> interacts with others based on sentiment... she<br> views it more as a duty.</p><hr><h3 id="the-message-rider-carries-as-a-character" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#the-message-rider-carries-as-a-character" aria-hidden="true">#</a> THE MESSAGE RIDER CARRIES AS A CHARACTER</h3><p><strong>NASU:</strong> An outlaw with super long hair and the<br> Mystic Eyes of Petrification... a winning trifecta!</p><p><strong>TAKEUCHI:</strong> Speaking of the Mystic Eyes, the<br> mark on Rider&#39;s forehead was designed to look<br> like a snake and was originally going to be a<br> third eye.</p><p><strong>NASU:</strong> Yeah, the idea was to make her third eye<br> the Mystic Eye, but we dumped that idea because<br> it was too obvious and boring.</p><p><strong>TAKEUCHI:</strong> So the mark on her forehead that<br> was originally there to indicate a sealed Mystic<br> Eye ended up being little more than a cool tattoo.</p><p><strong>NASU:</strong> I still think we made the right decision<br> about the third eye.</p><p><strong>TAKEUCHI:</strong> Now that I think about it... if we had<br> given her a third eye, we probably wouldn&#39;t have<br> had her wearing glasses...</p><p><strong>NASU:</strong>...You&#39;re right!</p><p><strong>NASU:</strong> Even in the old &quot;Fate&quot;, we had drilled it<br> into our fans that Noble Phantasms were swords.<br> So I can only imagine their reactions when Rider<br> activated her reins of all things, which then<br> immediately evaporated. (laughs) In a manner of<br> speaking, Rider&#39;s true name was essentially the<br> punch line of her character, much like with Kojiro.<br> That&#39;s why I mostly kept her quiet throughout the<br> main &quot;stay night&quot;.</p><p><strong>TAKEUCHI:</strong> For the longest time, I thought<br> Pegasus was her Noble Phantasm, so I assumed<br> the reins were like a Noble Phantasm Rider used<br> to control her Noble Phantasm... but then Nasu<br> told me that Pegasus wasn&#39;t a Noble Phantasm,<br> and my mind was blown.</p><p><strong>NASU:</strong> At the school and on the roof, Rider only<br> summoned Pegasus. After summoning Pegasus,<br> Rider uses her reins as kind of a power-up item,<br> and that is the recipe behind Bellerophon.</p><h2 id="reference" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#reference" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Reference</h2><details class="custom-container details"><summary>Source Images</summary><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/7fyPld7.jpg" alt=""><br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/LcMPK6p.jpg" alt=""><br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/NLILCHD.jpg" alt=""><br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/L28Hkbs.jpg" alt=""><br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/evOVlC0.jpg" alt=""><br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/XUiWgf1.jpg" alt=""><br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/s9uH4gQ.jpg" alt=""><br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/Cfi8Z6D.jpg" alt=""><br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/GQnZdeh.jpg" alt=""><br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/KQCNQlZ.jpg" alt=""></p></details>', 58);
