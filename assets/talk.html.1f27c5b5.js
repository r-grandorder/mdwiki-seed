Even though the sun has risen, the forest is still shrouded in darkness.</p><p>The forest is dark even in daylight, and it sheds blood repetedly in a shade of dark red as if it were the innards of some animal.</p><p>Blood is flowing, just like that.</p><p>The trees of this forest secrete blood instead of sap.</p><p>It was not made from the inside, but sucked from the outside.</p><p>Speaking frankly, this forest can be called an alien world.</p><p>A black forest that reaches 50 kilometers in diameter. It, with a mind of its own, &#39;moves&#39;, and sucks the blood of every single animal in the area.</p><p>No man who had set foot upon this forest, which can be called an enormous predating lifeform on its own, has returned alive.</p><p>A dense overgrow of tree branches.</p><p>Countless roots reach into the earth.</p><p>Blood flows from the end of each, and the forest growls, as if it were one bloodthirsty dark-red beast.</p><p>Inside it, human ability is powerless. The trees suddenly strike, becoming weapons of free form,</p><p>and even the air becomes poisonous, leaving nowhere to flee.</p><p>A man engulfed by the forest has his fate sealed. No, the forest not only attacks humans, but the village itself,</p><p>and it wasn&#39;t rare for it to create a whole new forest in one night.</p><p>A vampiric land that thinks, and wanders the world with the earth.</p><p>Forest dwellers call it the Demon of Schwartzwald.</p><p>They call it the Disemboweling Forest of Einnashe.</p><p>&#39;-------all dead, here as well.&#39;</p><p>In the darkness, she is the only one alive.</p><p>She has no baptismal name. Only the name &#39;Ciel&#39; refers to her.</p><p>Ciel sets foot upon the miserable space.</p><p>The trees in the vicinity are definitely eliminated. Probably the final struggle of the colleagues.</p><p>The trees around the square were all slashed, broken, and incinerated.</p><p>Scattered around the square are around ten dead bodies. Bodies with familiar faces.</p><p>The demise of the follwers, sent into the forest by the order of the Church.</p><p>......in the end, a combat unit of 40 people wasn&#39;t even able to survive one night.</p><p>&#39;......ten men could only eliminate such a small section.&#39;</p><p>Ciel confirms the bodies one by one.</p><p>Each one is a first-class fighting monk, and a comrade who had trained together.</p><p>&#39;So exorcists can be of no help within this forest... mages are not specialized in exorcism, but even to them, this forest would be a fatal place.&#39;</p><p>The combat units of the Church are not accompanied by exorcists. The ones that were sent to this forest are specialized in close combat.</p><p>There were some who used sorcery as well, but their circuits couldn&#39;t have operated. Because, in this forest.</p><p>&#39;------the source of magical energy is dominated by Einnashe, yes. Wouldn&#39;t that be why Narbareck chose you in the first place?&#39;</p><p>Ciel&#39;s movement stalled.</p><p>Fixing her eyes on the tenth body, she spoke to the person who appeared------no, he was there from the start, behind her back.</p><p>&#39;Merem. Are you the watcher this time?&#39;</p><p>&#39;Ahahaha... a watcher, that can&#39;t be appropriate.&#39;</p><p>A lively laugh that doesn&#39;t match the scenery.</p><p>The one called Merem, does not reveal his form.</p><p>&#39;Do you know that I really care for my co-workers? Since I&#39;m here to help Ciel for now, why not be friends?</p><p>Actually, Eins was supposed to come here, but I switched places. He can&#39;t possibly protect you,</p><p>and both of you could be killed. But Narbareck insisted on putting you in charge... so I followed in a hurry.&#39;</p><p>&#39;You care for your co-workers? That&#39;s new... I&#39;m just asking, but what did you do with Eins?&#39;</p><p>&#39;Ahaha, I ate him.&#39;</p><p>Merem said in an innocent tone.</p><p>&#39;It doesn&#39;t matter, does it? Just say Einnashe did him in. He was at a good age to retire, anyway.</p><p>This kind of work gets tough both physically and mentally after 50, doesn&#39;t it?&#39;</p><p>&#39;......I&#39;m hearing this from someone whose life scales up to 4 digits, Merem.&#39;</p><p>&#39;No, look. I&#39;m Peter Pan, so I can&#39;t be measured by common standards.&#39;</p><p>&#39;..................&#39;</p><p>After confirming all the bodies, Ciel started to walk towards the center of the forest.</p><p>&#39;Eh? What, you&#39;re going to do it alone? You know you can&#39;t use any sorcery in this forest, don&#39;t you?</p><p>The only thing one can trust here is his personal abilities. Supernatural powers that rely on exterior mana cannot be used.</p><p>After all, everything in this forest is-&#39;</p><p>&#39;Dominated by Einnashe, isn&#39;t it? I know that. This is a Reality Marble created by the Dead Apostle Einnashe.</p><p>You can&#39;t enjoy the world&#39;s benefits when the world around you belongs to your enemy.&#39;</p><p>&#39;That&#39;s it. I mean, even if you are skilled in the martial arts. You didn&#39;t train yourself to master level.</p><p>The two factors that made you a member of the Burial Agency has no meaning here.</p><p>Without your sorcery and your immortality, you can&#39;t survive in this place.</p><p>Knowing this, and picking you, Narbareck&#39;s really got a rotten spirit.&#39;</p><p>&#39;It&#39;s probably just a test. Without my immortality, I am not attractive firepower. The director is indirectly telling me to die.</p><p>&#39;See, you&#39;re stubborn. That&#39;s why Narbareck likes you.&#39;</p><p>&#39;.....useless meddling. If you want to talk, than talk to those trees. They can attack people, maybe they can talk to people as well.&#39;</p><p>Ciel leaves the square behind.</p><p>And behind her,</p><p>&#39;------Ciel, you&#39;re leaving the Burial Agency, are you?&#39;</p><p>A question is thrown, with murderous intent.</p><p>&#39;I&#39;ve heard that such rumors are spreading.&#39;</p><p>Ciel replied in an emotionless voice.</p><p>The one called Merem giggled.</p><p>&#39;So it is. Your objective was to regain your humanity by killing Roa. Since that has been accomplished, there is no reason to be with us.</p><p>Frankly speaking, you were invited by the British Museum, weren&#39;t you? Now that your next workplace has been arranged, don&#39;t you think this rumor is quite persuasive?&#39;</p><p>&#39;......I am no mage. Even if something goes wrong, I won&#39;t be joining the Association.&#39;</p><p>&#39;Ah, that&#39;s fortunate. Since it&#39;s really dull there. I figured if someone like you, who already knows the taste of blood, went there he&#39;d die of boredom.</p><p>Of course. Dying of boredom, you wouldn&#39;t want to die such a Dead Apostle-like death.</p><p>Well------although you are more Dead Apostle-like than that Apostle over there in the first place.&#39;</p><p>&#39;------&#39;</p><p>&#39;Besides. I know that the rumor is just a rumor. I mean, if you were trying to leave, you would have left a year ago.</p><p>It&#39;s been a year since Roa was exterminated. And you&#39;ve been continuing the Dead Apostle-hunting. If your objective was in regaining humanity,</p><p>isn&#39;t it strange that you didn&#39;t leave a year ago?&#39;</p><p>&#39;------so, what are you trying to say, Merem Solomon?&#39;</p><p>&#39;Eh? Well, I&#39;m saying that you don&#39;t really care about being human or not. All you&#39;re interested in is killing vampires.</p><p>Like the others, you&#39;re no more than a killing machine. Ah, but I&#39;m different. I&#39;m just a kid who likes toys.&#39;</p><p>&#39;------are you? Then don&#39;t bother with my affairs. Like what you said, I&#39;m just a machine that kills Dead Apostles.</p><p>So even if you&#39;re a co-worker, there&#39;s no guarantee that I won&#39;t assault you, is there?&#39;</p><p>The Dead Apostle called Merem laughs, shrouded in darkness.</p><p>&#39;Then, Ciel, why are you still hunting Dead Apostles?&#39;</p><h2 id="_2-op" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_2-op" aria-hidden="true">#</a> 2/ op.</h2><p>There is a Dead Apostle called Einnashe.</p><p>It is regarded as one of the ancestors, but the vampire had changed its matter of existance dramatically some 800 years ago.</p><p>The vampire called Einnashe follows a forest.</p><p>There is a sorcery called Reality Marble, which materializes a person&#39;s mental image, altering the world temporarily.</p><p>The &#39;Living Forest&#39; that Einnashe controls is a form of it.</p><p>However, while a typical vampire can only maintain a bounded barrier for a few minutes, and even the most powerful ancestors, a few hours, Einnashe maintains it for days.</p><p>The forest. The alien world called the Disemboweling Forest is elusive. It sucks the blood of hundreds of people, and then disappears,</p><p>going into a state of hibernation for a couple of decades. Einnashe shows its form only around once in 50 years.</p><p>This is why the Church hasn&#39;t been able to seal it, even though it repeats mass homicide.</p><p>No, to speak the truth, they have no way of destroying Einnashe in the first place.</p><p>Out of the 27 ancestors, ones that rank in the top 10 cannot be destroyed by ordinary concepts.</p><p>For if one is to compete against a being that lives in an illusion, one must use an illusion that surpasses it.</p><p>And this time.</p><p>Einnashe is active again, and two towns have already been exterminated.</p><p>The Church has sent first-class combat units out of dignity.</p><p>The result is obvious. The Church has failed again.</p><p>Also, the Church is not the only one that is interested in Einnashe.</p><p>There are many organizations that are trying to negotiate, or capture Einnashe, one of the most powerful of the Dead Apostles.</p><p>They, too, sent their elite into the forest, but the result was the same.</p><p>Einnashe does not distinguish friend from foe. Everything that sets foot upon his alien world has no more meaning to it than food.</p><p>Even so, there are many humans who wish to enter the dark forest.</p><p>One of the reasons is related to immortality.</p><p>In the center of the dark forest, there is a giant tree, and in that throne of Einnashe is a fruit of vivid red.</p><p>A singe fruit holding the condensed blood of hundreds, thousands of animals that had lived in the forest.</p><p>One who eats that fruit can gain temporary immortality.</p><p>That is, similar to a light trap.</p><p>Countless humans enter the dark forest, lured by the fruit of immortality.</p><p>This year, it has been 4 days since Einnashe has appeared again, and the number of hunters that have entered the forest goes over a hundred.</p><p>only four remain.</p><p>Numbers 5 and 7 of the Burial Agency, the prized anti-vampire organization of the Church.</p><p>A wind magus from the Mage&#39;s Association, who has visited the forest as a hunter.</p><p>And, one other.</p><h2 id="_3-black-sheep" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_3-black-sheep" aria-hidden="true">#</a> 3/ Black Sheep</h2><p>They walk the forest.</p><p>Four days after entering the Disemboweling Forest. Ciel still hasn&#39;t been able to grasp the true colors of this forest, nor the location of its central area.</p><p>Although it only reaches around 50 kilometers in size, the Disemboweling Forest is constantly in motion from the start. A forest walks inside a forest.</p><p>To find the center of a disemboweling forest that never stays in the same area is not something that can be done in three or four days.</p><p>&#39;So, we&#39;re lost again. Wouldn&#39;t it be better to take some appropriate rest here?&#39;</p><p>Anyway, it&#39;ll be safe if we make a clearing by knocking the trees down to their roots.&#39;</p><p>The voice of the one called Merem is heard behind Ciel&#39;s back. Even if Ciel had looked behind, she wouldn&#39;t have seen a shadow of a man.</p><p>&#39;------------&#39;</p><p>Ciel walked on in silence.</p><p>Her robe is torn here and there, and her breath is scattered.</p><p>Four days after entering the forest. It was the result of 46 hours of combat with trees assaulting from all directions.</p><p>&#39;Eh, are you listening to me? It&#39;s no use just wandering around the Disemboweling Forest. For now, it&#39;s best to take a rest, to recover your stamina.&#39;</p><p>&#39;------------&#39;</p><p>Ciel walks on.</p><p>&#39;Really. Ciel, why don&#39;t you listen to what I say?&#39;</p><p>&#39;Because I don&#39;t like you.&#39;</p><p>&#39;Wha, that&#39;s so mean~&#39;</p><p>A merry voice burst out from behind.</p><p>In this forest, where a moment&#39;s lack of tension could get oneself impaled, he was the only cheerful one.</p><p>And, his presence was lost, just as easily.</p><p>&#39;------Merem?&#39;</p><p>Ciel stopped her feet.</p><p>A loud boom was heard some hundred meters ahead.</p><p>&#39;------Merem!&#39;</p><p>She runs toward the source of the sound.</p><p>In the end, no matter how she tried to deny it, she had a tenderness inside that cared for her collegues.</p><p>And that allowed her to stay as herself.</p><p>It was a ruined wasteland.</p><p>There was a large patch of wasteland in the middle of the forest, as if a meteor had fallen on it.</p><p>The ground was dug deep, so much that even the roots would surely have been blown away.</p><p>&#39;------unbelievable. This is, like.&#39;</p><p>Like someone just scooped the ground away with a giant spoon, she muttered.</p><p>&#39;Okay, now we could rest in peace.&#39;</p><p>An angel-like boy stands in the middle of the ruin.</p><p>Merem Solomon.</p><p>This boy was the 5th of the Burial Agency, and one of the 27 Ancestors, just like Einnashe.</p><p>The two sat around a bonfire.</p><p>Looking up, the sky was already dark.... although there wasn&#39;t much of a difference, since it was dark inside the forest during the day as well.</p><p>Well, maybe the stars could make a difference.</p><p>&#39;It&#39;s okay. Einnashe won&#39;t move around anymore. It&#39;s about time for it to start making the fruit.&#39;</p><p>Merem, who was making noises with his rings, spoke out. The boy wears rings in every single finger.</p><p>&#39;......a rare thing, for you to use your beasts in front of someone else.&#39;</p><p>&#39;Hm? Ah, well since I haven&#39;t been giving it enough food lately. The soil of Einnashe makes good food.</p><p>Besides, I wanted to talk to you like this. Since you&#39;re talking, I should prepare the stage, shouldn&#39;t I?&#39;</p><p>&#39;Talk------what, about what we were saying earlier?&#39;</p><p>&#39;Eh------no, not that, but..... yes, um, you know. You, said you met, a year ago?&#39;</p><p>The boy mumbled, avoiding Ciel&#39;s eyes, as if he was ashamed of something.</p><p>&#39;It&#39;s about her, is it?&#39;</p><p>The boy flushed furiously. Ciel was amused, rather than surprised.</p><p>&#39;This just makes no sense at all. You&#39;re already like a traitor of the Dead Apostles, and now you&#39;re on her side.</p><p>Where did the wise and cool Merem Solomon go off to?&#39;</p><p>&#39;That&#39;s my left hand. I only show my true self to you and Narbareck. You see, our organization values experience.</p><p>It could get quite tiresome in many ways if I show myself.</p><p>anyway, is it true that the princess won&#39;t be returning to her castle?&#39;</p><p>The boy spoke in an uneasy tone.</p><p>The Church has a morbid hatred for vampires.</p><p>It is known that they will do whatever it takes to eliminate vampiric beings that were once human------that is, Dead Apostles.</p><p>That&#39;s because while they can tolerate demons, they cannot accept beings that their god is not involved with.</p><p>However, to hunt down a heretic is to acknowledge its existance.</p><p>Therfore, an organazation keeps a darkness within in order to protect itself.</p><p>An agency that exists not to solve a contradiction, but to eradicate it, to say it wasn&#39;t there.</p><p>That is the darkness in which she resides.</p><p>The darkness requires not faith, but just force, to protect the organization.</p><p>Out of those forces, these two can be called extraordinary.</p><p>The woman called Ciel was once tainted.</p><p>The boy calls himself Merem is the target of elimination itself.</p><p>And, the two share a common situation.</p><p>&#39;......Hm. Then it should be about time for her blood crave to take over.&#39;</p><p>The boy muttered, expressing regrets.</p><p>&#39;Is that so? From what I&#39;ve seen, she didn&#39;t seem to have reached that stage.&#39;</p><p>&#39;Well, the True Ancestor are different from other vampiric creatures. They suck blood because of psychological reasons, not physical ones.</p><p>That is, the incentive is emotional.</p><p>So, their hatred against humans and their love for them may actually be quite similar.</p><p>&#39;......Hah. You mean that for a True Ancestor, the more emotionless one is, the longer he lives?&#39;</p><p>&#39;Yeah, since nature has no emotions. Ones belonging to nature only have a will to stay beautiful. That&#39;s why the world is so------&#39;</p><p>and suddenly, the boy broke his speech.</p><p>&#39;Merem......?&#39;</p><p>&#39;------------&#39;</p><p>The boy does not answer.</p><p>His dazed eyes, seemed to be gazing far beyond the darkness.</p><h2 id="_4-red-ram" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_4-red-ram" aria-hidden="true">#</a> 4/ Red Ram</h2><p>And, a battle draws to an end.</p><p>A dark forest.</p><p>The mage Forte has been defeated by a nameless opponent.</p><p>&#39;------I ask, for your name.&#39;</p><p>Forte spoke, hidden in the shadows of the trees, posed to break from this location immediately.</p><p>The mage was not wounded. Even after a complete and utter defeat, her body didn&#39;t have a single scratch.</p><p>However, the battle was concluded.</p><p>Forte understood that it was impossible to compete against this oriental.</p><p>To be honest, she couldn&#39;t believe she was still alive, that she wasn&#39;t killed outright.</p><p>It was as if all this, hiding in the shadows and hearing his name, was just a delusion, as if she was already dead.</p><p>The oriental said something, but it was impossible for Forte to understand. Since she never was interested in Japanese,</p><p>even the pronounciation wasn&#39;t caught clearly.</p><p>But still------Forte inscribed that poorly heard sound into her mind.</p><p>The one that forced her, a swordsman as well as a mage, who could stand her ground even against the dogs of the Burial Agency, into defeat.</p><p>The name of the unknown killer.</p><p>And the mage departed.</p><p>She left like the wind, in the same manner in which she appeared.</p><p>&#39;------ha.&#39;</p><p>A sigh, and he winds the bandages again.</p><p>In his hand, there is only an antique knife. Other than that, some light clothing that is lacking somewhat in resistance.</p><p>Even in this unearthly, demonic ground, his attire was as simple as that of the boy called Merem Solomon.</p><p>&#39;Indeed, with you as an escort, even Nero would have been exterminated.&#39;</p><p>&#39;------------&#39;</p><p>The voice spoke out without any sign of disturbance, as if it already knew his presence. The voice spoke English, which he couldn&#39;t speak at all,</p><p>so it was somewhat difficult to understand what it said.</p><p>&#39;Pleased to meet you, Satsujinki. Though we were to meet in the near future, I never imagined we would meet today.</p><p>So, what brings you this deep into the mountains? From what I&#39;ve heard you don&#39;t seem to agree with Apostle-hunting.&#39;</p><p>&#39;------------&#39;</p><p>&#39;It just happened, did it. You&#39;re quite similar to Ciel. Well, since in your case, all your actions are based on the princess--</p><p>indeed, you&#39;re after the Fruit of Einnashe as well. That&#39;s fine.</p><p>The fruit would surely supress her blood crave to a good extent.&#39;</p><p>He responds to the sound of &#39;Ciel&#39;.</p><p>Just for an instant, however.</p><p>He lays his hand on the freshly wrapped bandages.</p><p>&#39;Wait. I have no intention of fighting you. Since as of now, there is no way for you to defeat me.</p><p>Such pointless actions are not advised. For now, your power should act against Einnashe.&#39;</p><p>The fingers stop, extended over the bandaging.</p><p>&#39;Wonderful. You&#39;re honest, unlike Ciel. Judgind from what I&#39;ve heard, I had imagined an emotionless killer,</p><p>but you&#39;re a lot better. A purpose that goes out in two extremes, two completely different systems of thought.</p><p>A contradiction that cannot exist without such methods is quite beautiful. Well, since I happen like inadept humans.&#39;</p><p>A small laugh.</p><p>He finally understood that the voice in the darkness was actually nowhere near him.</p><p>&#39;Well, I&#39;ll guide you to the lair of Einnashe..... but before that, will you tell me one thing? 800 years ago,</p><p>the princess definitely exterminated Einnashe. Why, then, is he still alive?&#39;</p><h2 id="_5-darkwood-kingdom-2" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_5-darkwood-kingdom-2" aria-hidden="true">#</a> 5/ Darkwood Kingdom 2</h2><p>&#39;Merem......?&#39;</p><p>&#39;------hahah. That&#39;s a rather ridiculous coincidence.&#39;</p><p>Light returned to the boy&#39;s eyes.</p><p>Merem, who had been like an empty shell for some time, exhaled deeply.</p><p>&#39;Coincidence? Merem, what coincidence?&#39;</p><p>&#39;Eh? Oh, I was just off for a moment to hear the truth. How Einnashe can maintain a Reality Marble for days, and such.&#39;</p><p>&#39;? Heard, from who?&#39;</p><p>&#39;Mm-, that&#39;s a secret. However I&#39;ll tell you the details. That&#39;s like, such a pressing story.</p><p>Ciel, did you ever hear about what type of Dead Apostle Einnashe is?&#39;</p><p>&#39;......no, I&#39;ve heard that the Dead Apostle Einnashe became prominent some 800 years ago, but I do not know of its identity.&#39;</p><p>&#39;Yeah, Einnashe is like Zelretch. He&#39;s a mage who turned himself into a vampire. A powerful hypnotist,</p><p>so much that his abilities could be called memory remodelling. He was a cautious one, and he rewrote the memory of every single human that got to know him.</p><p>Even the princess was fooled into thinking &#39;There is no Dead Apostle called Einnashe&#39;.</p><p>But that was just once. Einnashe remodels memory by making the target &#39;understand&#39;.</p><p>There was a mage who can sink thoughts into the subconscious, making it impossible to recall.</p><p>The princess eliminated Einnashe with his help. That was 800 years ago.&#39;</p><p>&#39;......800 years, then that would be when she was still hunting Dead Apostles by the order of the True Ancestors.</p><p>If she eliminated him then, she would have destroyed the whole lot of them.</p><p>Then, didn&#39;t the entire clan called Einnashe get totally wiped out?&#39;</p><p>&#39;Yeah, that&#39;s what happened. However, for some reason the princess made a big mistake.</p><p>She left Einnashe&#39;s dead body and returned to the castle, but she left it under some tree.&#39;</p><p>&#39;......? Some tree, what&#39;s that?&#39;</p><p>&#39;Well, a carnivorous plant. If you were in Japan, you&#39;d have heard of such things?</p><p>Like gajumal or jubotko, stories of trees that suck blood. Ah, he also said cherry blossoms drink blood as well.</p><p>Well, anyway, the corpse was under that tree, and the tree accidently sucked Einnashe&#39;s blood.</p><p>You know the rest. The tree that sucked the blood of a powerful monster such as Einnashe.</p><p>It became a transcedental lifeform that moves around, assaulting people, and it grew steadily.</p><p>&#39;------that leaves me speechless. Unbelievable. That idiot, had a screw loose from the first place, did it.&#39;</p><p>&#39;Ahahaha. Yeah, he showed the same sort of appreciations well.&#39;</p><p>The boy laughed innocently.</p><p>&#39;Eh......wait a second, Merem. Someone who knows such a truth that only she could know, and talks about it just like that. Um, it&#39;s just a maybe, but......&#39;</p><p>&#39;Yeah, it&#39;s the one Ciel was talking about earlier. He was quite surprised when I mentioned you, as well. Like whoa, Senpai is here as well, or something.&#39;</p><p>&#39;------------&#39;</p><p>Ciel flushed, becoming as red as the boy did earlier, and took a breath.</p><p>&#39;Ah, um, Merem, that------&#39;</p><p>&#39;If it&#39;s his location, it&#39;s simple. He was closer to Einnashe than we are. So I gave him some guidance.</p><p>Anyway, he says he&#39;s here to destroy Einnashe.&#39;</p><p>&#39;What......!&#39;</p><p>Ciel rises to her feet.</p><p>And at that moment.</p><p>&#39;Eh------no way?&#39;</p><p>The whole forest shook, and suddenly, one of the boy&#39;s legs ruptured.</p><p>If there was such a thing as a god&#39;s beast, then it would refer to something like that.</p><p>A dark mass. A silhouette like a whale stood up from the middle of the forest.</p><p>Were there so many birds in this forest of death? A flock of wild birds, big enough to cover the stars, fly up.</p><p>The black whale, made a sound like a scream.</p><p>Something was clinging at an alarming rate, starting from the legs of the giant beast.</p><p>It was a group of trees, literally running over the black skin of the whale.</p><p>The enormous beast, which had the size of a mountain, was covered entirely by trees in less than a minute, and halted, becoming a new part of the forest.</p><p>The beast that would stomp and crush the world was, however, defeated by the corrosion of the world it should crush.</p><p>No.</p><p>It was no match in the first place.</p><p>&#39;Argh------that thing, doing quite well......!&#39;</p><p>The boy presses down the ruptured right leg.</p><p>The forest continues to shake.</p><p>Perhaps it&#39;s the excitement of consuming such a giant lifeform, the trees supress a strong desire to move around.</p><p>&#39;Merem, that was------!?&#39;</p><p>&#39;No, this is bad------of course, it lives purely on instinct. Looks like it noticed that something capable of killing it has come near.</p><p>That Disemboweling Forest is about to kill every single living thing on it.&#39;</p><p>&#39;------------!&#39;</p><p>From that, she understood the whole turn of events.</p><p>Holding the few black keys that are left, she stares into the depths of the forest. Inside, would be her target.</p><p>Not the target to destroy, but the target to protect.</p><p>&#39;Merem, where&#39;s the core of Einnashe.&#39;</p><p>&#39;There, around 3 kilometers in distance.&#39;</p><p>The boy speaking is missing a hand. Clearly not satisfied with just being attacked,</p><p>it seems that he has already sent another beast in the direction.</p><p>&#39;I&#39;m going. Will you be able to protect youself alone, Merem?&#39;</p><p>&#39;It&#39;s okay. I&#39;m not alone.&#39;</p><p>&#39;Of course, it was a stupid question.&#39;</p><p>Ciel replied briefly, and ran off.</p><p>Severing countelss assaulting branches, she headed to the core of the dark forest.</p><p>What happend after that, would be needless to say.</p><p>Since it would be what anyone would imagine.</p><h2 id="_6-ep" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_6-ep" aria-hidden="true">#</a> 6/ ep.</h2><p>They leave the forest.</p><p>The sun, which they haven&#39;t seen for a few days, glows a dazzling white.</p><p>&#39;Ciel, you let him go. The Church had ordered his capture as an important reference.&#39;</p><p>&#39;But you let her go. The director sent out orders to dispose of her on sight, did she not?&#39;</p><p>The two halted at the exit of the forest.</p><p>After staring at each other in the eye for a few seconds,</p><p>&#39;Well, I&#39;ll let it pass this time.&#39;</p><p>&#39;Yeah, let&#39;s forget about it.&#39;</p><p>And they walk.</p><p>It seems the boy&#39;s leg is still immobile. His movement is akward, so much that he couldn&#39;t walk properly without her assistance.</p><p>&#39;-----------&#39;</p><p>The two walk in silence.</p><p>Suddenly.</p><p>&#39;Ciel, if there&#39;s a chance, that would be now.&#39;</p><p>The boy spoke such words.</p><p>&#39;---------&#39;</p><p>She stops her steps.</p><p>The boy&#39;s intentions are incomprehensible, but his words speak the truth.</p><p>There is no watcher on her, and her only companion cannot move properly.</p><p>If she is to dissapear, like a cat without her leash, now is the perfect chance.</p><p>&#39;------------&#39;</p><p>After taking a deep breath.</p><p>&#39;Forget about it. The opportunity has left a year ago.&#39;</p><p>She says, and starts to walk with the boy in her arms.</p><p>&#39;Hm. That&#39;s just acting calmness, isn&#39;t it.&#39;</p><p>&#39;Yes. However, since this is the first time, it would be an impudence to stop before I can&#39;t bear it anymore.</p><p>giving up just because I&#39;m fed up with it, is rather childish.&#39;</p><p>&#39;Hm, that&#39;s like paying the price of your sins? It&#39;s funny, since that sounds quite human.&#39;</p><p>&#39;Eh. Do you envy me, Merem?&#39;</p><p>&#39;......yeah- in a way. About as much as you envy me. However, then how long does it last?</p><p>You&#39;re not saying that sin lasts until you die, are you?&#39;</p><p>&#39;That would be convenient...... But I don&#39;t think so.</p><p>Since I don&#39;t even know what my sin is, in the first place.&#39;</p><p>Until it is certain, I will confront the darkness within me, she says.</p><p>The boy, gazes far.</p><p>&#39;What, then it&#39;s a damned bond that lasts a lifetime, isn&#39;t it? Don&#39;t you know the simple truth?</p><p>That nothing can be cleared before it comes to an end?</p><p>He says, in a rather exhausted tone.</p><p>&#39;Indeed... those words carry a weight when you say it, Merem.&#39;</p><p>She giggles like a boy, but she doesn&#39;t stop walking.</p><p>like that, she returns to her old workplace.</p><p>The boy doesnt know. He doesn&#39;t know that she had always wanted to escape, that she repeats the same things over and over again in each task.</p><p>In the end.</p><p>The woman called Ciel goes searching for her sins until her old nest itself is gone.</p><p>Afterwards, whether the sin comes in the end or not, will be another story.....</p>', 374);
