I-</p><p>\u201CWe meet again, Saber.</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015No, this would be the first time for you.\u201D</p><p>I stare fixedly at the magus, utterly stunned.</p><hr><p>\u201C...Were you the only one to come? I have no idea of your intentions, but dealing with one Servant is all the better for us.</p><p>The other Servants have already been defeated. Now, I shall defeat you and check the king.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C!\u201D</p><p>Sparks run through Saber&#39;s body.</p><p>Her fighting spirit has flared up. She must know that what this magus says is true.</p><hr><p>\u201CYou... defeated the other Servants?\u201D</p><p>\u201C...No. You and your Master, as well as the Einzbern Master and her Servant, still remain.</p><p>Once I defeat you, I will attack the Einzbern castle and obtain the Holy Grail.\u201D</p><hr><p>Saber&#39;s readiness to fight has changed to open hostility.</p><p>She sees the woman before her as nothing but an enemy, and is now waiting for me, standing behind her, to give the order.</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015Namely, &quot;destroy our foe.&quot;</p><hr><p>But surprise has forced the gears in my head to a standstill.</p><p>Forgetting even to breathe, I take in the scene before me.</p><hr><p>So there really was another Master nobody knew about.</p><p>So there really was someone trying to continue this war.</p><p>So\u2015\u2015\u2015she really was in this city.</p><hr><p>She definitely isn&#39;t an illusion.</p><p>But it doesn&#39;t make sense for her to not be. This doesn&#39;t add up. There are too many contradictions.</p><p>Yes, that&#39;s right, and furthermore\u2015\u2015\u2015if that woman really exists, then standing beside her...</p><hr><p>\u201C...Finally my turn to shine, huh?</p><p>Time for a rematch. Let&#39;s give it everything we&#39;ve got, Master.\u201D</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015would be the eighth Servant.</p><hr><p>\u201CWha\u2015\u2015\u2015you, are you... a Servant...?\u201D</p><p>Saber&#39;s surprise is warranted.</p><p>The Servant that appeared isn&#39;t a somebody, but rather a &quot;something.&quot;</p><p>Its presence is unnaturally powerful, and its reality is unnaturally lacking.</p><p>...Just looking at it is revolting.</p><p>To speak to that &quot;thing,&quot; to be together with that &quot;thing,&quot; much less trust in that &quot;thing,&quot; isn&#39;t humanly possible.</p><hr><p>\u201CAllow us to introduce ourselves.</p><p>I am the Master dispatched by the Association, Bazett Fraga McRemitz.</p><p>And this is my Servant, Avenger.\u201D</p><hr><p>The faceless, featureless silhouette grins.</p><p>Even without a face, the expression of his emotions is clear.</p><hr><p>\u201CSo a mano-a-womano fight it&#39;ll be.

It is impossible for you to finish off Saber. Give me a good fight. At the very least, get her to the point where she has to use her Noble Phantasm.\u201D</p><hr><p>A thunk resounds by Bazett&#39;s feet.</p><p>She dropped the bag she was carrying,</p><p>and a leaden sphere rolled out.</p><hr><p>That thing, which I couldn&#39;t see as a weapon no matter how I look at it, floats off the ground and into a diagonal orbit around Bazett.</p><p>Should we take it for some type of defensive Mystic Code against Servants?</p><p>The crystal circles around Bazett as if to protect her, glowing with a dim, sluggish light.</p><hr><p>\u201CLet the battle commence. Ready your sword, Saber.</p><p>This time, my Servant and I will defeat you.\u201D</p><hr><p>Leaving her Servant to the front line, Bazett steps back.</p><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015Huh?\u201D</p><p>That&#39;s not right.</p><p>Her combat style isn&#39;t supposed to be like this\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015Hold on. Saber, that&#39;s...\u201D</p><p>\u201CHAH. AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!\u201D</p><p>As if to obliterate the sound of my voice, no, to do exactly that, Avenger rends the air with an exaggerated war cry.</p><p>Holding a pair of brutish swords in a reversed grip, he rushes at us.</p><hr><p>\u201C...! I&#39;m moving in, Shirou! Stay back...!\u201D</p><p>Saber responds to the charge of the silhouette.</p><p>With no time to stop them, the battle between the two Servants begins.</p><hr><p>Saber and Avenger.</p><p>The struggle between the two is more like watching a warrior grapple with a beast than the elegant meeting of blades.</p><p>The warrior is Saber. The beast is Avenger.</p><hr><p>A battle without Noble Phantasms or magic, where pure physical attack and defense would determine the victor.</p><p>The short swords Avenger holds are closer to fangs than blades.</p><p>They are a pair. The two weapons, so great the variance in their size and shape, press in on Saber.</p><hr><p>\u201CSha, haaaaaa\u2015\u2015\u2015!\u201D</p><p>A furious, whirling dance of swords, where blows fly like shrapnel.</p><p>For every hit that Saber lands, Avenger makes three or four. The beast, unable to match her strength, compensates with its speed.</p><hr><p>A uniquely bizarre and haunting scene.</p><p>Avenger&#39;s speed is far from slow.</p><p>His footwork is dizzyingly nimble and quick as he unceasingly swings the pair of fangs he holds.</p><hr><p>As though delirious from fever, he fights, his only purpose to attack.</p><p>He&#39;s more than fast enough for her already.</p><p>But then comes the next attack, and the next after it, and I see Avenger raise that speed.</p><hr><p>\u201CHaa, haa, haa, ha\u2015\u2015\u2015!\u201D</p><p>His eyes are bloodshot. His breath comes in ragged pants from the lack of oxygen. His body veritably screams that anything more than this will be impossible.</p><p>And yet Avenger ignores it all completely and immerses himself in the battle.</p><hr><p>Stronger. If she blocks this attack, he has to hit her even stronger.</p><p>Faster. If she can throw that strike aside, he has to do it faster.</p><p>His body is without limits. No, it&#39;s just that he doesn&#39;t care about the limits.</p><p>He is...</p><hr><p>...A beast, stricken with a madness that drives him not to heed the exhaustion searing his brain.</p><hr><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015What?\u201D</p><p>I rub my eyes.</p><p>...That&#39;s this Servant&#39;s style, huh?</p><p>...Murderous rage seethes from him like vapor, turning his physical outline vague.</p><p>Something distorts and inflames his desire to kill until it becomes a mirage that envelops his entire body.</p><hr><p>\u201CHa, ha, ga, hahi, hi, ha\u2015\u2015\u2015!\u201D</p><p>The speed at which Avenger&#39;s short swords strike their foe has already increased countlessly, a hundredfold or more, since the battle began.</p><p>A ceaseless torrent of swords rains upon his foe. However...</p><p>Saber&#39;s blade deflected them, each and every one.</p><hr><p>Ordinarily, no human can stand up to a huge carnivore.</p><p>But in this case, the tables have been turned.</p><p>The human, Saber, is the one with the overwhelming advantage.</p><p>No matter how fast Avenger goes, his swords won&#39;t reach Saber in the end.</p><hr><p>From the start, the gap between their raw abilities was too wide.</p><p>To Avenger, Saber is as impregnable as a man-made fortress.</p><p>Even with the excessive speed he wagered his life for, Avenger doesn&#39;t stand a chance against Saber.</p><hr><p>\u201CGA\u2015\u2015\u2015AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!\u201D</p><p>The beast roars.</p><p>Knowing that he won&#39;t reach her, that he&#39;s no match for her, he continues his charge toward destruction.</p><hr><p>Saber was kept on the defensive not because she was waiting for Avenger to burn himself out, but to see how he would play his hand.</p><p>...There is a purpose to this rampage.</p><p>Our enemy is also a Servant. If his basic stats are low, what we need to watch out for is his Noble Phantasm. Knowing that, she was gauging Avenger&#39;s power, but that too is now at an end.</p><p>Judging that Avenger has no trump card, Saber begins her counterattack.</p><hr><p>...But what interests me is the Master.</p><p>She&#39;s monitoring the fight from a distance, just like I am.</p><p>She&#39;s an excellent magus.</p><p>There are plenty of ways she could be supporting her Servant, so why is she only looking on?</p><p>What\u2015\u2015\u2015is that sphere floating behind her?</p><hr><p>\u201CHa\u2015\u2015\u2015!\u201D</p><p>Saber&#39;s sword flashes.</p><p>With one swing of her sword, she would perform the last rites to end this rampage.</p><p>And as she brings it down, the malformed blades of his short swords catch it.</p><hr><p>\u201C...A swordbreaker...!?\u201D</p><p>Short swords like those are usually used for that purpose.</p><p>A weapon designed not to rend, but to stop the blade of the attacker&#39;s weapon.</p><hr><p>\u201CHa, you finally took the bait, you moron\u2015\u2015\u2015!\u201D</p><p>He laughs derisively at the game that has just entered his trap.</p><p>Avenger, whose left dagger halted Saber&#39;s sword, brings its mate up from the right to cut Saber...</p><hr><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015, ha?\u201D</p><p>The fangs are pulverized, shattering without a trace.</p><p>The lefthand sword that held hers,</p><p>and the righthand one, aiming to slash at her armor,</p><p>Saber obliterated them both in the blink of an eye.</p><hr><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><p>Saber&#39;s sword descends.</p><p>\u201CWHAT THE\u2015\u2015\u2015what kind of a bullshit magic burst was that, you bitc\u2015\u2015\u2015!!\u201D</p><p>He jumps back, shrieking in anger, but all too late.</p><hr><p>\u201CGi\u2015\u2015\u2015!\u201D</p><p>Even after being dealt a mortal wound, the beast sneers.</p><p>Her last blow laid him open from his right shoulder to his waist,</p><p>a wound that would bring him to the verge of death, rendering him completely incapable of further combat...</p><hr><p>\u201CGya, gaa, HIA, AAAAAA!\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015!\u201D</p><p>&quot;<ruby>VERG<rt>False Copy</rt></ruby>&quot;</p><p>\u201CA\u2015\u2015\u2015Gi, GI GI, HI HAHAAHAHAHA HA HA HA HAHAHAHAHAHAHA...!!\u201D</p><p>&quot;<ruby>AVESTA...<rt>of Inscribed Creation!&quot;</rt></ruby></p><p>And activating his Noble Phantasm.</p><hr><p>\u201C...!? Ha, gu...!?\u201D</p><p>As she cuts down Avenger, Saber crumples to the ground.</p><p>...Like mirrors facing one another.</p><p>Saber, without a single visible wound, clutches desperately at her torso in the very same place where Avenger had been cut\u2015\u2015\u2015!?</p><hr><p>\u201CThis... is a curse\u2015\u2015\u2015a primal curse of shared pain!\u201D</p><p>Saber struggles to stay on her feet.</p><hr><p>\u201CHah. Just what I&#39;d expect from a prim and proper lil&#39; Heroic Spirit like you. Not too slow on the uptake, are you.</p><p>As you&#39;ve surely deduced by now, this here&#39;s the most simple curse in the whole wide world. All it does is take the wound you gave the other guy and throw it right back at ya.</p><p>I call it &quot;<ruby>Verg Avesta.<rt>False copy of Inscribed Creation</rt></ruby>&quot; A third-rate Noble Phantasm worth the equivalent of shit that can&#39;t do anything until I eat damage.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CAvesta...? Using the Book of Zoroaster as a Noble Phantasm...!?\u201D</p><p>\u201COh no no, just a worthless copy, ma&#39;am.</p><p>...Eh, it&#39;s not near as great as one of those damage-multiplying scriptures, but I have to admit that it has its advantages.</p><p>Get what I&#39;m saying, Saber? That wound&#39;s written on your soul. Your standard oh-so-proper healing won&#39;t do a thing to it. Until my wound heals, your pain isn&#39;t going anywhere.\u201D</p><hr><p>The silhouette snickers.</p><p>Bearing his fatal wounds, the Servant, his life reduced to the span of a few minutes more, moves away from us.</p><hr><p>\u201CThen again, thanks to you, I&#39;ve only got a few more minutes left, tops.</p><p>On the other hand, you&#39;re not going to bite the dust from the likes of this. You&#39;ll be A-OK, so long as you don&#39;t move until after I die... but\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><p>Bazett, who&#39;d been watching the whole time, makes her move.</p><p>With a spare efficiency in her movements, she slips both her hands into leather gloves.</p><hr><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015You don&#39;t exactly have the time to stand around catching flies, either.</p><p>If I were you, Saber, I wouldn&#39;t hold back. My Master&#39;s not the forgiving type where her job is concerned. She&#39;d even step over little kids and cute puppies, y&#39;know.</p><p>...So once you&#39;re dead, the kid over there is next. You get me?\u201D</p><hr><p>Strength returns to Saber&#39;s body.</p><p>It might have been Avenger&#39;s taunting that did it, or maybe it was because she noticed me trying to run towards her.</p><hr><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015Do not underestimate me. Do you really believe a wound like this would be enough to stop me, Avenger?\u201D</p><p>Saber&#39;s sword reveals itself.</p><p>Her enemies number only two. The distance between them is sufficient.</p><p>From this position, the church would also be mowed down along with them, but she already has confirmed that no people are inside.</p><hr><p>\u201CShirou, I request permission to use my Noble Phantasm\u2015\u2015\u2015!</p><p>Please hurry, the enemy Master is making her move...!\u201D</p><hr><p>The sphere floating behind Bazett is being charged with electricity.</p><p>I don&#39;t know what she&#39;s trying to do, but that magus looks like she&#39;s going to attack Saber from over there.</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015But, with that?</p><p>That&#39;s something like using a pebble to attack a tidal wave.</p><hr><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015Saber, it&#39;s up to you...!
