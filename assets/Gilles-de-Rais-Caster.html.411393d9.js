Scorched earth with no sign of human life, nor blade of grass left behind!</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong><br> What manner of disaster could have befallen it?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> We&#39;re not sure of the details, either. At any rate,<br> a strange natural disaster beyond human knowledge...</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong><br> Natural disaster! Not the ravages of war? Some caprice of God unrelated to Man&#39;s sins wiped out those living here?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Yes...Because this is impossible for the people of this era, perhaps you could call it a trick of fate.</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong><br> Oh, how wretched! How disastrous!<br> How tragic! This cannot go unanswered!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Caster...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Senpai, you can&#39;t judge a book by its cover.<br> Gilles may look terrifying, but he&#39;s a good Heroic Spirit.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Hm...I had some concern regarding the man who was the basis for the legend of Bluebeard, but...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> He really was a good man, wasn&#39;t he?</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong><br> Of course! No one else values life more highly than I, Gilles de Rais!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Are you forcing yourself?</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong><br> Nonsense! No one else values life more highly than I, Gilles de Rais!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> He really is a good man!</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong><br> Human life is like a fruit. Squeeze, and the gem-like nectar shall sates my thirst. However!</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong><br> Pain and screams! Fear and despair! Crushed before they could be fully squeezed out is such a waste!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Pardon?</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong><br> Outrageous! A natural disaster as a caprice of God, and the waste of new lives is outrageous!</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong><br> The agonies of all creatures should only be unleashed by one who appreciates the joy of plucking out a life!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...I take back what I said. Senpai, sticking with this weirdo will only ruin Chaldea&#39;s reputation.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Well, even so. His abilities as a Servant can&#39;t be measured by the scale of good and evil.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> His personality may be kind of out there, but consider him an invaluable assets to be used effectively.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I don&#39;t like this...</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong><br> Oh? Does my Master still not understand fully the true beauty of life?</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong><br> No surprising. Precious few have a genius for aesthetics.<br> It&#39;s not something you develop in a short time.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Sounds fun!</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong><br> Heheheh, so, you understand, my Master.<br> How joyful to work with a Master who thinks as I do.</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong><br> In place of God and Satan, let us both savor the light of life, treasured as the stars!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I heard that Gilles de Rais was a great hero who supported Jeanne d&#39;Arc as a war marshal.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Yes, but at the same time, he&#39;s known as a pleasure killer who murdered hundreds of young children.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> While he&#39;s a popular Heroic Spirit, that dual nature means he can be a completely different person depending on the class he&#39;s summoned in.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> How well you master a Servant like this depends on the Master&#39;s latent potential.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Which means, Fujimaru, you&#39;ll just have to do your best!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Meaning it&#39;s not your problem, Doctor?</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fooou...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Um, look! While we&#39;re talking,<br> the enemy signatures are getting closer!</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong><br> Oh?<br> Talk about a rough welcome right after I&#39;m summoned.</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong><br> Very well. I shall enlighten these creatures on the true beauty of how one should kill!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Um...I suppose this needs to be taken care of first...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Master, you&#39;ll have to use this new Servant to get through this ordeal.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I&#39;ll be trying hard, too, so fight bravely!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong><br> Hee hee hee hee!<br> How lovely! How lovely!</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong><br> I thought them as mere hors d&#39;oeuvres, but these children sing unexpectedly well.</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong><br> Hmm, should I reevaluate the enemy as well, perhaps?<br> In their own ways, they are beautiful and intriguing materials.</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong><br> Crush them! Cut them open! Rip out their guts!<br> We must hear the sound of their screams for ourselves!</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong><br> Heh, this is turning out to be an enjoyable journey, my Master.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Senpai, don&#39;t tell me you&#39;re planning to keep using this troublemaker...are you?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I...<br> I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll ever eat octopus again...</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fuuouu...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Well, if you ignore what he says and does, I think he makes a pretty useful asset...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Well, let&#39;s leave that up to Fujimaru.<br> It&#39;s not a proposal one can calmly make from the Command Room.</p>', 60);
