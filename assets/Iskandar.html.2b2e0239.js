What is this wasteland?</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong><br> I came along excited about the prospect of a new battle, but this place is cold and bare.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Really? I thought the great King of Conquerors who trampled the Persian desert would find this place nostalgic.</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong><br> Fool. The glorious battlefields of my memories were blazing gold at day and like tranquil moonlight at night. A sea of sand so mystical, it roused the heart.</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong><br> It&#39;s nothing like this empty bore of a ruin.<br> It&#39;s vastly different in epicness and scale.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Wouldn&#39;t you say an empty plain like this is rather convenient for battle, since you don&#39;t need to worry about harming innocent bystanders?</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong><br> Convenient!? If it&#39;s not a fruitful land that gets the heart pumping, how do you know what you&#39;re fighting for!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> What you&#39;re fighting for, huh.<br> Then, may I ask, why do you fight?</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong><br> It&#39;s obvious! To conquer! To reach the undiscovered land and claim it as my own!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...I see. I expect nothing less from you, Senpai. You have summoned yet another troublesome Heroic Spirit.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Yeah, what a headache.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...I feel that&#39;s putting it lightly...<br> He&#39;s almost a supervillain...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Now, now. There&#39;s no need to be so pessimistic.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> In order to have a harmonious relationship with Servants, a positive outlook on things is most important, Mash.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Actually, this is fine.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Are you saying that you have no problem controlling Servants, no matter how extraordinary of a Heroic Spirit they are?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Perhaps that&#39;s just your positive thinking talking? ...To be honest, I&#39;m a little concerned about your optimism...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> No. In a situation as desperate as this, confidence and optimism are our ultimate weapons.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Fujimaru has proven yet again [\u2642 his /\u2640\uFE0F her} high suitability as a Master.</p><hr><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou??? (Suspiciously)</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> King of Conquerors. You seem unimpressed with the world you&#39;ve been summoned to, but why not think of it this way?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> The crisis of destruction we are facing right now has the potential to make every land of this world into barren wastelands.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Which means the enthralling land that you seek to conquer will no longer be if nothing is done.</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong><br> Oh-ho? That is a grave concern. This is no battle.<br> It&#39;s simply a disaster.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> You are not wrong to think so. To be honest, we do not fully understand the enemy ourselves.</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong><br> No matter what it may be, as long as it has a physical body that bleeds when I cut it, I&#39;ll have no problem fighting.</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong><br> Basically, you just want me to slaughter those ghastly creatures coming right at us, yeah?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...Say what!? Oh crap!<br> Look out, you&#39;re surrounded!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong><br> ...Hm. Now that I&#39;ve fought against some, I understand. This is no battle. This is some kind of cataclysm.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Meaning?</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong><br> There&#39;s no passion in the enemy&#39;s fist. No emotion nor warm blood coursing through them. They are like locusts or portents of disaster. They are no warriors.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Um, so you&#39;re saying,<br> they&#39;re like ghosts?</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong><br> Hm. I cannot simply let such creatures roam free.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> We need your help.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> You&#39;ll regret it if you ignore them.</p><hr><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong><br> Indeed. With another conquest up ahead, it seems we need to settle this matter first.</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong><br> This is a bizarre turn of events, but as you&#39;ve summoned me, I shall offer you my sword, Master.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Ah yes! Now this is what Servant cooperation is all about! See how negotiation can make anything possible, Mash?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> To be honest, I was on guard when I heard the King of Macedonia was here, but he&#39;s quite the man! He&#39;s so heroic, but not too rough!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I wouldn&#39;t call it negotiation...<br> I feel like the fight convinced him.</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong><br> Now that&#39;s settled, we need to prepare!</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong><br> Military strategies change with the time and place.<br> I must learn more about this era!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Ah! That&#39;s quite convincing coming from the great hero who sought world domination!</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong><br> Being summoned as a Servant granted me knowledge of your era, but it does not feel real yet.</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong><br> Yes, I need...personal experience...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> And what kind of preparations do you have in mind?</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong><br> First and foremost, information from literature.<br> And a map.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...I&#39;m a little surprised that you&#39;d be so meticulous in forming military strategies.</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong><br> Obviously. A guide is necessary when exploring foreign lands. Maybe not an interpreter, but I do want literature to help steer our way.</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong><br> Prepare something that lists must-see sights, local foods, and what times are the busy times. Make sure they don&#39;t skimp on the details.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...Huh?</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong><br> And...clothing. We wouldn&#39;t be fully immersing ourselves in local fare if it&#39;s just food and lodging.</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong><br> Attire unique to that country! Just a wardrobe change changes your entire perspective!</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong><br> My retainers all hated to do it.<br> But it really is amusing.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Look at that smile. It&#39;s like saying, \u201CI can get anything I want.\u201D A royal ego like that reminds me of Gil... I mean, a different king that we know.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> But when King Iskandar says it, I think I understand why his retainers would give in.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> So, this is the king who thought to slice through the Gordian Knot. Only Senpai could summon a Servant like this!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> That&#39;s not true!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Maybe that&#39;s true!</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Well, um...yeah. I guess it wouldn&#39;t kill us to have a, uh, couple people around with one or two screws loose.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> On that same note, maybe it wouldn&#39;t be so strange to have a king who mixes up tourism with conquest.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Foooou?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> My point is, no matter what this Heroic Spirit&#39;s interpretation of the situation is...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> As long as we can count on him in battle, I don&#39;t see any issue... I guess?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> That may be true...</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong><br> Hahaha! That&#39;s the spirit!</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong><br> As my contractor, that&#39;s the attitude you need!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> That&#39;s not necessarily true...</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong><br> Hahahaha! There&#39;s nothing to fear! Life itself is a battle. Those who enjoy it will be victorious!</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong><br> No matter your predicament, first eat your fill! Sing! Rest! Then you can worry about it after!</p><hr><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Foooou... (Dumbfounded)</p><h2 id="the-unending-expedition" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#the-unending-expedition" aria-hidden="true">#</a> The Unending Expedition</h2><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Let me reiterate! We need to retreat immediately! There&#39;s nothing we can gain from this battle!</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong><br> Wahahaha! You may be right, Shield Maiden, but our escape route is now closed off! We just need to bite the bullet.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...Unfortunately, he&#39;s right, Mash. Now that you&#39;ve started the battle, you&#39;ll need to fight to get through.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> This is all because Iskandar just had to meddle...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> We could&#39;ve escaped if you kept quiet...</p><hr><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong><br> Come now, don&#39;t say that!</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong><br> The winds that blow in this land reminded me of Persia. It brought back the days of my passionate young blood!</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong><br> And just when I felt like wreaking havoc here again, this lot showed up in need of a real thrashing!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> What a meatheaded thought process...<br> Senpai, be careful you don&#39;t get carried away, too!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Mash, don&#39;t get distracted.</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong><br> Wahahaha! That&#39;s my Master there! You really do have keen insight into the workings of battle!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Senpai, where were you from again?<br> Did you work in a super exploitative company before coming to Chaldea?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> What I&#39;m saying is that you seem very adept at navigating a conflict and unreasonable demands!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I hate my life!</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong><br> Wahaha! Don&#39;t say that. Come, even my Bucephalus is excited by the prospect of battle!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Foooou!</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong><br> Even that little squirrel over there is excited!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Fou!?</p><hr><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong><br> Besides, this battle may have begun as just a fun romp, but that may not be the case now.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> What do you mean?</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong><br> When I arrived in this land for an expedition, King Darius&#39; troops were not the only ones who blocked our path.</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong><br> They were like the evil spirits that we are fighting right now. They were relentless in ambushing us.</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong><br> And along with those old memories...<br> My men say their blood is stirring.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Huh?</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong><br> They want to fight! Like back in the day... So fiercely, so courageously! Wagering their short lives for a chance at glory!</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong><br> Men who had gathered to join in my path to conquer across the sea of sand! That is what they desire!</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong><br> So, as king, I must answer their call!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> What&#39;s with this sudden\u2014!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...Where are we?</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> A Reality Marble! But this is strange. How could the King of Conquerors as a Rider manage such powerful magecraft?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> No, wait a minute! I detect numerous Servant signatures nearby!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> This... What is going on!?<br> I&#39;m detecting more than 10,000!</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong><br> Ah, look at your faces! Even I am excited. I&#39;m trembling!</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong><br> Now, raise your voices for battle!</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong><br> The time of wonderment is here, Fujimaru, Shield Maiden! This is truly my kingship! My bond! My ultimate Noble Phantasm!</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong><br> Run them down! Ionioi Hetairoi!!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Amazing... Was that your Noble Phantasm?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> The successive Servant summoning was a surprise! How many Servants were there!? Who knew they&#39;d all be Heroic Spirits!?</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong><br> Yes, indeed. They all went wild to their hearts&#39; content. As usual, my men are unbelievable.</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong><br> Fujimaru, and Shield Maiden as well. To see you unmoved by the mass of strong enemies was admirable.</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong><br> My men were also in awe of your recklessness.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Th-thank you.</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong><br> If there ever is another opportunity to wade into battle together, they would be more than happy to, is what they are saying.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Um...I don&#39;t quite understand what&#39;s going on, but can we assume you will help us out again?</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong><br> Indeed. Not only do you have my support, but my men have all agreed as well.</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong><br> Therefore, I declare here and now:</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong><br> Under the banner of the King of Conquerors Iskandar, we of the Eastern Expedition Mixed Army shall participate in the Grand Order.</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong><br> My Master! Command my Noble Phantasm,<br> \u201CIonioi Hetairoi,\u201D well!</p>', 144);
