So it was a long relationship.&quot;</p><p>I finally understand now.</p><p>I knew Issei&#39;s attitude towards Tohsaka was not normal.</p><p>Well, the mystery is unraveled... actually, it seems even more tangled now.</p><hr><p>&quot;Anyway, I just happened to see you keep trying to jump over a height you couldn&#39;t.</p><p>That&#39;s all. That&#39;s when I first saw you, and I found out later that Sakura came to this house. I didn&#39;t know your name until then, and I forgot about your face.&quot;</p><hr><p>...Well, now I know how she knew me.</p><p>&quot;Um, is that something traumatic?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Humph. It&#39;s revenge after four years.</p><p>Sakura joined the archery club a year ago, right? So I went and watched when I got the chance. And I happened to see someone who wasn&#39;t a club member shooting arrows.</p><p>I knew right away that you were the idiot from that time.&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>I want to say something about what she thought about me, but I stay quiet.</p><hr><p>&quot;...And I was shocked at that time. There was this stranger who went to a different school that I&#39;d considered stupid all this time, but I remembered him even after three years.</p><p>And I finally realized that you&#39;ve been giving me damage all this time.</p><p>I found out I was jealous of this guy that kept on running like an idiot.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015Why? He was stupid, right? That&#39;s not someone you should be jealous of.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Yeah. I probably wasn&#39;t jealous of him, but I felt Iike I&#39;d lost. ...It would&#39;ve been fine if he&#39;d had hope of clearing that bar. I would&#39;ve just gone home if that were the case.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...But even he knew it was impossible.</p><p>He knew nothing would change that, but he kept trying. It&#39;s as if he believed the effort was what mattered.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...To be honest, I can&#39;t do such a thing.</p><p>I&#39;ve always been like that. I determine whether or not something is possible. If I know it&#39;s impossible for me, I quickly give up. I don&#39;t try what I can&#39;t do, and I never regret it or think I&#39;m powerless because of it.</p><p>I&#39;m cold like that. I&#39;m a terrible person. Kirei called it machine-like instead of cruel.&quot;</p><hr><p>But Tohsaka isn&#39;t belittling herself.</p><p>She&#39;s proud of how she is.</p><hr><p>&quot;But I do sometimes think how pure it&#39;d be to just keep trying without a thought for whether it&#39;s possible.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...Well, as a child, it&#39;s shocking to see someone that&#39;s completely the opposite of you, right?</p><p>That&#39;s why it was traumatic. That guy who foolishly kept running was...&quot;</p><hr><p>Someone I was happy to know existed.</p><p>Tohsaka murmurs with a dreamy expression.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015Oh, that was boring talk. Maybe I&#39;m being nervous because things aren&#39;t going well.&quot;</p><p>Tohsaka gets up, as if saying the break&#39;s over.</p><hr><p>&quot;I&#39;m going back to my room. I&#39;ll be creating the framework with Illya in the afternoon, so you go watch Sakura.&quot;</p><p>She puts her cup in the sink and heads to the hallway.</p><hr><p>...But.</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Hey. How was Sakura?&quot;</p><p>She stops and asks, as if she&#39;s just remembered.</p><hr><p>&quot;She seemed well. She still has a fever, but it&#39;s better than the last time she collapsed.</p><p>Sakura is calm as well. She pushed herself to do things around the house, but she&#39;s being obedient and resting today.</p><p>That being the case, I&#39;m sure she&#39;ll be better in no time.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Of course she&#39;s staying still.</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015She can&#39;t get up by herself now.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015What?&quot;</p><p>She can&#39;t get up by herself now...?</p><p>&quot;Why? She should have enough magical energy. Then shouldn&#39;t she have enough physical energy as well?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Yes, she has more than enough magical and physical energy. But it&#39;s terrible inside.</p><p>...I don&#39;t know what happened last night, but she definitely died once. That&#39;s the only sound explanation for why the muscles in her limbs are so badly damaged.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...No way. She didn&#39;t have any external wounds.&quot;</p><p>&quot;...It&#39;s just that it&#39;s cleanly connected on the outside.</p><p>I don&#39;t know if the crest worm ripped her apart, or if someone else tore her limbs. ...If something really did tear her body apart, the pain would have destroyed her sanity.</p><p>...Let me ask. Did she recognize you?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>I swallow my affirmation.</p><p>...Tohsaka&#39;s expression is agonized.</p><p>Then that means...</p><hr><p>&quot;...Sakura didn&#39;t recognize you?&quot;</p><p>&quot;She did. She knew me, and she called me Nee-san.</p><p>But she wasn&#39;t looking at me, but was looking at the Tohsaka Rin she imagined.</p><p>...Yeah, I really wanted to kill her when she said things like &#39;nice to meet you&#39; and &#39;I wanted to meet you sooner.&#39;&quot;</p><p>Tohsaka looks away as her words turn cold.</p><hr><p>...Wanted to kill?</p><p>...Tohsaka felt murderous intent against Sakura?</p><hr><p>&quot;In short, I can&#39;t do it.</p><p>I can&#39;t protect Sakura until the very end like you, and I don&#39;t intend to either.&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Tohsaka.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;I told you, right? I don&#39;t do impossible things.</p><p>As long as I&#39;m Tohsaka Rin, I&#39;ll kill Sakura the moment I determine that it&#39;s not possible to let her go on. Well, I don&#39;t need to say it again because that was our deal all along, but I thought I&#39;d remind you.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;You don&#39;t need to say anything. I know how you feel, and even if you say something, it won&#39;t accomplish anything.</p><p>We&#39;re allies while we fight against Zouken, but we&#39;re enemies when it comes to Sakura. If you don&#39;t like it, we have to defeat Zouken as quickly as possible.</p><p>......But Shirou. What will you do if Zouken and the shadow are two separate enemies?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>I shut my mouth.</p><p>Tohsaka&#39;s question is so sharp that it makes me dizzy.</p><hr><p>&quot;Shirou.

Sakura is already functioning as a Holy Grail. She will die even if I remove the crest worm right now.&quot;</p><hr><p>Hold on.</p><p>Holy Grail? Sakura is functioning as a Holy Grail?</p><p>Why is he talking about the Holy Grail...?</p><hr><p>&quot;Wait. What do you mean by Sakura being the Holy Grail? What did you do to her...!?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;I tampered with her to obtain the Holy Grail and make my wish come true.</p><p>It is all for Makiri&#39;s dearest wish, to put shape to the soul, the true immortality. That is why I embedded the Holy Grail into Sakura after the war ten years ago.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;What\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015you embedded the Holy Grail...?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Right. You should have heard how the Holy Grail War ended ten years ago.</p><p>Your father, Emiya Kiritsugu, destroyed the Holy Grail that was completed through the ritual we know as the Holy Grail War.</p><p>The war ended, the summoning ritual a failure once again.</p><p>But\u2015\u2015\u2015it was not a total loss. The Holy Grail was completed, if only temporarily.</p><p>Then it would be a waste to leave the broken fragments as they were.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>My head quickly cools down.</p><p>In short, he took his granddaughter Sakura and...</p><hr><p>&quot;Yes. I embedded the Holy Grail within her. But I am no monster. I made sure she can function as a human. I knew it would be painful to have an inorganic substance in her, so I turned the shard of the Holy Grail into a living thing.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Living thing... Then the crest worm in Sakura is...&quot;</p><p>&quot;It is something I created using the Holy Grail as catalyst.</p><p>With that, her body became a container to receive the souls. It became a tool to become the gate when the ritual is completed.</p><p>It is just a copy of the Holy Grail the Einzbern family makes.</p><p>Well, I do not have as much skill as them, so I did about an eighth my own way.&quot;</p><hr><p>He laughs.</p><p>...Copying Einzbern?</p><p>All he did was pick up a piece of a finished product and implant it within Sakura...!</p><hr><p>&quot;...You bastard! You can&#39;t make a Holy Grail, so you used a human being to make an imitation of the Holy Grail...!?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Experiment. It&#39;s just an experiment, heir to Emiya.</p><p>This experiment is merely a stepping stone to the next. My plan was to slowly change her to something like a Holy Grail over several decades.</p><p>It was supposed to be an experiment of Makiri&#39;s Holy Grail which lives as a human but still has the function to collect souls.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Sakura\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015is an experiment...?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Of course. Sakura was given to the Matou family for that reason.</p><p>To give a daughter to the Matou family means giving us a foundation to achieve our goal. Tohsaka is well aware of that. We both have the same goals. We will both turn ourselves into monsters to achieve immortality.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Immortality...?</p><p>You and Tohsaka&#39;s father used Sakura for something ridiculous like that...!?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Of course. The Holy Grail War has always been a ritual dedicated to that end. That is the only reason we cooperated, and I am the only one who still lives.</p><p>To use the Matou successor to achieve our goal in the far future.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;But fate can be quite ironic.</p><p>Sakura was prepared to be an unadaptable Holy Grail, but she has shown surprising growth.</p><p>My, I have gotten old. I never expected Sakura to have that much talent. Not only does she still live in spite of taking in so many Servants, but she still retains her sense of being Matou Sakura.</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015She is a true Holy Grail, just like that of the Einzbern, which I thought was impossible to make myself.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;......!&quot;</p><p>I can&#39;t hold it anymore.</p><p>I&#39;m not patient enough to keep listening to the monster&#39;s nonsense.</p><p>Forgetting the possibility of Assassin&#39;s intervention...</p><hr><p>&quot;Enough of this bullshit...! You can&#39;t call something that only sacrifices human lives a Holy Grail\u2015\u2015\u2015!&quot;</p><p>I let my anger take over and dash at Zouken with a raised fist.</p><hr><p>But.</p><p>&quot;It is a Holy Grail.</p><p>First of all, even the Einzbern, who create the Holy Grail, used a human as their Holy Grail for this war.&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015What?&quot;</p><p>Zouken&#39;s smile stops me in my tracks.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Using a human?&quot;</p><p>...My body wobbles back.</p><p>I hate myself for knowing who he&#39;s talking about, even though I don&#39;t want to understand.</p><hr><p>&quot;Right. Illyasviel is also a Holy Grail.</p><p>But do not consider us as the same. The Einzberns are far worse. You can ask her yourself what kind of a Holy Grail they prepared.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>My upraised arm falls.</p><p>...Not only Sakura.</p><p>Even Illya is the same, and regret takes over my body in place of anger.</p><hr><p>&quot;Well, I assume that was all you wanted.</p><p>Then it is my turn now. The reason I called for you.</p><p>I want to discuss the shadow with you.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Wha\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>Discuss the shadow...?</p><p>He must be talking about the black shadow that&#39;s attacking the people in this town.</p><p>But\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>&quot;...What are you saying? That thing is on your side.</p><p>So what do you need to talk about? Do you want us to beat it?&quot;</p><p>I glower at Zouken, my voice thick with sarcasm.</p><p>&quot;Kakaka, this simplifies matters!</p><p>Yes, I want you to do something about that shadow. That is why I need your powers, Emiya Shirou.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;What\u2015\u2015\u2015are you serious...!? You guys are on the same side, right...!?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;On the same side...? Well, I have helped it, but it has never helped me.</p><p>I cannot even communicate with it.</p><p>I merely arranged its path so it would not run wild. I calmed it down every night to minimize the damage it dealt, but as of last night, I can no longer continue.</p><p>Did I not tell you? I cannot manage it anymore.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>My heart thumps loudly.</p><p>&#39;I cannot manage it anymore.&#39;</p><p>Who is that directed to?</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Zouken.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Ah, yes. I must tell you what that shadow is before anything else.</p><p>In short, that is the content of the Holy Grail.</p><p>People say the Holy Grail is an omnipotent pot, but the Holy Grail we aim for is not a pot. The Holy Grail is only a means.</p><p>Einzbern, Makiri, and Tohsaka.</p><p>What the three families aim for is to open a gate using the complete Holy Grail.</p><p>You can think of the complete Holy Grail as a gate to connect this world to a world where every wish comes true.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...Hold on. Then the Holy Grail is...&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes. The goal of every magus is to reach the origin.</p><p>But I am not interested in such a thing. The Einzberns only thought for the completion of the Holy Grail. Tohsaka is the only family of magi that is still aiming for the origin.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...Anyway.</p><p>The Holy Grail is a gate that connects to the wish machine. The shadow is something that has leaked from the other side.</p><p>The real Holy Grail\u2015\u2015\u2015Illyasviel would not have done such a thing. That shadow is a mistake made by the imitated Holy Grail.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Well, I do not like to talk about the shame of my family, but it seems I did not discipline her well enough.</p><p>She matured as a Holy Grail, but it would appear she cannot shut the gate properly. I do not mind if she dies from her own carelessness, but I cannot have her involve other people.</p><p>What a bother... the Holy Grail I made might kill everyone in this town.&quot;</p><hr><p>Matou Zouken shakes his head,</p><p>as if it&#39;s someone else&#39;s problem.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>I should punch him for saying that.</p><p>But his words turn my emotions to ice.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Then that black shadow is...&quot;</p><p>Truly...</p><p>&quot;You should already know. That thing is Sakura&#39;s shadow. You should recognize the similarities between them.&quot;</p><p>...Matou Sakura herself?</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>...I fight off the dizziness.</p><p>...The truth...</p><p>I accept the connection I&#39;ve already known but denied.</p><p>No matter what that black shadow may be...</p><p>I have to accept that the crime is Sakura&#39;s as well\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>&quot;Does Sakura\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>&quot;No, she should not know about it.</p><p>That thing is the Holy Grail&#39;s shadow that appears through Sakura. It originally should not have form, but when it passed through the gate called Sakura, it took Sakura&#39;s form and obtained a body.</p><p>The Holy Grail borrowed Sakura&#39;s sealed id to come into this world.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;It was beyond my expectations to be honest. I denied it since it was impossible, but I have to accept it now that it is getting stronger by the day.</p><p>That thing is a Holy Grail with a will. That is why it keeps consuming human souls to complete itself.</p><p>There is only one way to stop it. If the Holy Grail is born from Sakura&#39;s unconsciousness, you merely need to stop Sakura.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;I tried to persuade Sakura, but the shadow does not want me going near her.</p><p>It does not have a will of its own, but that shadow is Sakura herself. It hates whoever she hates.</p><p>I cannot even go near Sakura anymore.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;......What? Then you can&#39;t get close to Sakura?&quot;</p><p>&quot;No. You people think Sakura is under my control, but that is all in the past. She is already yours. I cannot control her, as I have been cut off from her.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;.........&quot;</p><p>It&#39;s something I can be happy about.</p><p>At the very least, Zouken can&#39;t do anything to Sakura.</p><p>Then if we can do something about the crest worm\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015Wait. You haven&#39;t done anything to Sakura?&quot;</p><p>&quot;No, nothing at all.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Then, Sakura&#39;s still in pain, because...&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;That&#39;s her own problem. I have never used the crest worm. She is breaking down because she is a Holy Grail and the powers of the Holy Grail are flowing into her.</p><p>Think about it. There is a great swirl of magical energy that can grant any wish. Her human body must receive what flows from that source. There is no way Sakura&#39;s weak mind can endure the strong onflow.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Wha\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015then Sakura will...&quot;</p><p>&quot;Unable to bear the strain of being a Holy Grail, she will explode.</p><p>No, if Sakura&#39;s consciousness empties, the Holy Grail should appear. She might be swallowed by her own shadow.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Do you understand? It is meaningless to kill me here.</p><p>The Holy Grail War ends once you defeat me. At that point, all that remains is for the Holy Grail to activate. Sakura&#39;s mind will be obliterated once that happens.</p><p>If you want to save her, endure for the duration of the Holy Grail War. The timing to open the gate, the completion of the Great Holy Grail, does not last long.</p><p>It has already been ten days since the war began. Judging from the past wars, this war should end in about four more days.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015Four days. Are you saying Sakura will survive if four days pass?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Who knows? That is for you to determine. How was she this morning? Do you think she will last four more days?&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015! She will. Of course she&#39;ll make it.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;I see, I see.</p><p>But the same cannot be said for the other people. How many disappeared last night? How many will disappear tonight?</p><p>No\u2015\u2015\u2015how many days do you think it will take for the whole town to be consumed?&quot;</p><hr><p>I can&#39;t really hear his question.</p><p>Does this man sound happy or sad?</p><p>My head is shaking so much that I can&#39;t tell.</p><hr><p>Defeating Zouken won&#39;t solve the problem.</p><p>Sakura won&#39;t last until the Holy Grail War ends.</p><p>We can&#39;t beat that black shadow.</p><p>The people in town will continue to die as long as the Holy Grail War continues.</p><p>&quot;...Then how...&quot;</p><p>Can I save Sakura?</p><hr><p>Then...</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015It&#39;s simple. You just need to kill Sakura.&quot;</p><p>Zouken states the obvious.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>&quot;I am correct, am I not? She cannot survive even if you let her live, and the black shadow will attack people again tonight. Kill her right now to prevent that.&quot;</p><p>I feel dizzy.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>&quot;That is what I wish to discuss. I wanted to inform you of the current situation. I wanted to tell you that you are protecting the greatest disaster.&quot;</p><p>I feel like vomiting.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>&quot;Sakura will notice Tohsaka&#39;s daughter or me. But she will gladly give her life if it&#39;s for you.&quot;</p><p>I can&#39;t breathe.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015Ending one evil life to save thousands.</p><p>You should know. If you are to carry out Emiya Kiritsugu&#39;s will, Matou Sakura is your enemy.&quot;</p><p>My mind isn&#39;t working at all.</p><hr><p>I walk down the distorted hallway, unable to give a reply.</p><p>I don&#39;t feel anything even when I walk or lean against the wall.</p><p>It&#39;s ugly.</p><p>It feels like I&#39;m in a twisted nightmare without an exit.</p><hr><p>I go outside, still forgetting to breathe.</p><hr><p>&quot;You will not make the wrong choice. It is a pity for Sakura, but this is fate.&quot;</p><hr><p>...I walk.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015But I will thank you in my granddaughter&#39;s place.</p><p>She has never done anything for herself. She never cursed herself for being thrown away by her father. She did not wish to be almighty like her older sister.

Can I ask you something, Illya?&quot;</p><p>&quot;All right, I&#39;ll tell you anything. What do you want to know?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...The Holy Grail. Tell me about the Einzbern&#39;s Holy Grail.&quot;</p><p>&quot;...I see, so you found out, huh? There were two things I didn&#39;t want you to find out, and that was one of them.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Illya. Then...&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yeah, I&#39;m the Holy Grail. I&#39;m not human. I&#39;m a homunculus made that way.&quot;</p><hr><p>Homunculus\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><p>An alchemical formula to create life without a womb, using sperm and other elements.</p><p>They are not born from a proper reproductive system, and therefore have physical defects.</p><p>Small bodies. Short lives. Lack of intelligence. Lack of reproductive functions.</p><p>They have human shapes and human lives, but they are not human, and therefore are completed with a powerful Magic Circuit.</p><hr><p>They are weak as a life form.</p><p>But they far exceed human powers when they are made as magi\u2015\u2015\u2015no, as magecraft-Circuits\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Well, so that&#39;s it.</p><p>The Einzbern family raised me to function as both a Holy Grail and a Master.</p><p>The function of the Holy Grail is to collect the souls of defeated heroic spirits. Humans, coffins, stew pot, it doesn&#39;t matter what it&#39;s made of as long as it has that special function. It just has to be a sufficiently large container of souls.&quot;</p><hr><p>Illya sounds like she&#39;s not interested.</p><p>But\u2015\u2015\u2015this is the first time I&#39;ve heard that the Holy Grail collects Servants.</p><hr><p>&quot;Well, it&#39;s more like retrieving them than collecting them.</p><p>Servants are summoned by the Holy Grail. Then it&#39;s natural that they return through the Holy Grail after they&#39;re defeated. I&#39;m the only Holy Grail of Einzbern, so I should have collected all of them.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...But it seems there&#39;s someone else that&#39;s functioning as a Holy Grail.</p><p>It took Caster and Lancer when I noticed, and its drawing power was greater.</p><p>So it took most of the Servants.</p><p>......I was able to collect Archer because he disappeared right in front of me.&quot;</p><hr><p>...It doesn&#39;t even need to be said.</p><p>The other Holy Grail is Sakura.</p><p>According to Illya, Sakura has already taken in Caster and Lancer... as well as Saber and Berserker.</p><hr><p>&quot;Four Servants&#39; worth of souls. But can you hold such a thing? Isn&#39;t it a general rule that the human body can only contain one soul?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Yes, all the more so if it&#39;s the soul of a heroic spirit.</p><p>The magical energy of a Servant that lost its &#39;shell&#39; called class is enormous. Having one in your body is like creating a typhoon in your body.</p><p>But it&#39;s the function of the Holy Grail to collect seven in the end.</p><p>There&#39;s no space for the soul of the container itself.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;That&#39;s why all the Holy Grails until now were inorganic substances without souls. The function of the Holy Grail is to collect the souls of all seven Servants, then to unify and manage them.</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015You don&#39;t need extra programs in there. The personality of the Holy Grail will only be erased by the function of the Holy Grail.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;In short, Shirou. The Holy Grail loses its human functions the more complete it gets.</p><p>The same goes for me. Once I collect many Servants, I have to cut off my functions as a human being to control the souls.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;I can manage them if I cut off the energy that moves my limbs.</p><p>I won&#39;t let the souls out if I stop breathing.</p><p>I can stabilize the integration of the souls if I use all the power I&#39;ve used to construct my human form.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;That&#39;s the same for Sakura. You can&#39;t function as a human once you become a Holy Grail. You don&#39;t have the power to spare.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;......But, yes.</p><p>If there is a difference between us, it&#39;s that I can switch at will, but Sakura is forced to. Sakura is an incomplete black Holy Grail, so she has no right to refuse.&quot;</p><hr><p>Illya shows no emotion as she continues.</p><p>...She knew it.</p><p>She probably knew it since the time she was born, no, even before she was born.</p><p>She knew that her life was made for such a stupid reason.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>But there&#39;s something I can be glad about.</p><p>I place my hand on my tense chest and look up at the heavens, as if in thanks.</p><hr><p>&quot;What&#39;s wrong, Shirou? I said Sakura can&#39;t be saved.&quot;</p><p>I know.</p><p>I know that, but...</p><hr><p>&quot;You two are sharing them between you two, right? Then you&#39;re still...&quot;</p><p>&quot;Hm, yeah. Sakura took most of it, so there&#39;s no problem in me staying as myself. Rider and Assassin. Even if I collect their souls, I don&#39;t need to cut off my functions as a human being.&quot;</p><hr><p>...Yes, that&#39;s fortunate.</p><p>If I lose Illya as well, it will mean I can&#39;t protect anybody\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>&quot;Eh, eh, Shirou...!?&quot;</p><p>Before I know it, I&#39;m embracing Illya.</p><p>I can&#39;t promise her anything, and it&#39;s not like I want something.</p><hr><p>&quot;Shirou...&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>Her body is small, so I can&#39;t hold her too tightly.</p><p>I just touch her, holding her in my arms.</p><p>I let my fingers feel the weight of what I must protect.</p><hr><h2 id="scene-09-once-it-s-spring" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#scene-09-once-it-s-spring" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Scene 09 Once it&#39;s spring</h2><p>It&#39;s almost two o&#39;clock.</p><p>It&#39;s late, but I decide to make lunch and take it to Sakura&#39;s room.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Well.&quot;</p><p>I take off my apron and put the rice porridge on a tray.</p><p>I take a deep breath.</p><p>And I fill my heart with ice.</p><hr><p>I don&#39;t know what I&#39;ll say if I go see Sakura in this condition.</p><p>I can&#39;t do that.</p><p>If Sakura figures out that I&#39;m troubled, she&#39;ll just be even more troubled herself.</p><hr><p>I have to freeze my emotions so that I don&#39;t reveal anything.</p><p>...This will the last time.</p><p>This will be the last time we will be together to just casually see each other&#39;s faces.</p><p>I want our precious time together to end in laughter.</p><hr><p>&quot;Are you awake, Sakura?

How can you have spirit during a cold?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh, um... it&#39;s an embarrassing story, so it&#39;s a secret.&quot;</p><hr><p>Sakura laughs in embarrassment.</p><p>...Hm. It seems Sakura was an energetic child in her own way.</p><hr><p>&quot;So it&#39;s not that I dislike cold medicine, but it&#39;s that I can&#39;t trust it.

So the solution would be to start over from day 9 and increase Sakura-chan&#39;s affection points.</p><p>The other method is a direct offense brought on by an external factor.</p><p>The victim was also the assailant.</p><p>He tried to kill Sakura-chan here.

Sakura is a scary girl...!&quot;</p><hr><p>Their speculation heats up.</p><p>But I think of another method that doesn&#39;t fall under either scenario.</p><p>It goes like this.</p><p>Going back to yesterday morning.</p><p>What if my death was determined the instant I said &quot;no&quot; to Tohsaka-san&#39;s question...?</p><p>&quot;Anyway, the case is solved.</p><p>Let&#39;s go, Lady Illyasviel.
