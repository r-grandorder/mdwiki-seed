Although he has a docile disposition, contrary to his gentle appearance, his sense of justice is strong, and while he was alive, concerning the \u201Coverthrowing of the evil that lurks inside humans\u201D, he was agonizing in earnest about it, having researched it, and tried to fight against it (and failed).

It is unknown if Hyde, the evil that was largely dormant within Jekyll, became ferocious as a reaction to the usual Jekyll who lived as a good person, or if it \u201Cmerely resulted in about this much atrocity\u201D since Jekyll has a scarce amount of evil. Hyde basically does not reflect on these things. He has no view of morality. He frequently behaves reflexively towards everything before his own eyes.

However, he was living in anguish. He felt ashamed of the pleasurable nature hidden inside of himself. That is, it was called a meagre thing because it is possible to say that it is just something everyone has.</p><p>Good and evil. About humans, Jekyll believed that they are not composed out of a single nature, but beings who must have a dual nature, and he attempted to detach all of his evil nature from his persona by means of chemical experiments. He refined and administered a dose to himself a special medicine, but he transformed into \u201CEdward Hyde\u201D, who embodied evil. Not only did he became a different persona, but even his flesh had also changed. For the sake of stopping \u201CHyde\u201D \u2013 who reached the stage of dyeing his hands in blood to the point of committing murders and indulging himself in atrocities, it is said that Jekyll eventually rejected his own life.</p><h2 id="character-in-fgo" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#character-in-fgo" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Character in FGO</h2><p>Henry Jekyll has a reason to be obsessed with \u201Cevil\u201D. That is to say, it is a matter largely caused by the existence of the \u201CEmperor of the Criminal World\u201D that he saw with his own eyes while he was in the process of cooperating with the private investigations of a certain private detective, who was playing an active role in London.<br> Performing works of evil.<br> Works being done to anger others.<br> Works that disrupt order, destroy the world, and contaminate goodness.<br> But for himself, to be before the \u201CEmperor\u201D whose presence is so far as overwhelming, who puts on an air of a transcendent person who does not receive any punishment, and who is located outside the fate that befalls on society, Mr. Jekyll \u2013 who is a good person that acts with sincerity \u2013 was fascinated with the repulsiveness of evil.</p><p>For the good of denying evil that everyone seems to have, Jekyll relied on chemistry and alchemy. He attempted to separate the elements of good and evil that mankind is endowed with. Although he used his very own living body as the subject of his experiment, the experiment failed\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>At the end of the struggle with \u201CHyde\u201D \u2013 who exists as a second self that originated from himself, Jekyll lost his life.</p><p>Henry Jekyll, on the occasion of materializing as a Servant, has his self come into existence as a Dual-Existence Entity who can even transform his flesh while accompanied with his persona switching over. Due to his Noble Phantasm, he can change places with \u201CHyde\u201D, a person who should be beaten by himself. Fight evil with evil. Although he has an unbearable dilemma, it seems he will obey his Master. The justice that was never yet fulfilled by himself\u2026 he believes that he will surely attain it this time.</p><p>However, maybe because he materialized in the Assassin Class, or maybe because of some other reasons, Jekyll\u2019s Saint Graph is unnaturally warped, and he is unable to completely suppress Hyde. He can barely grasp and contain a hegemony of his persona, and he has no conjecture of when he can suddenly change too. Furthermore, even though he was summoned to Chaldea, Jekyll is continuing to struggle with the inside of himself. Although, even a conclusion to that will probably be decided before one would know about it. The end of the conflict between good and evil is near.</p><h2 id="others" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#others" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Others</h2><p>If he had been summoned into a different Class, Jekyll would practically possess no combat ability. The reason why Jekyll is endowed with combat ability as a Servant in Fate/Grand Order is because it is conjectured that Hyde\u2019s persona as well as his brutality are beginning to dissolve into Jekyll due to the abnormality of his Saint Graph.</p><h2 id="related-characters" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#related-characters" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Related Characters</h2><p><em><strong>When he is Jekyll:</strong></em></p><p><strong>Edison / Nikola Tesla / Babbage</strong></p><p>Jekyll has an excellent compatibility with scholar Servants to the extent that he can continue his conversations with them all throughout the night.</p><p><strong>Lord El-Melloi II</strong></p><p>\u201CIt is said that he is a person of that Clock Tower.
