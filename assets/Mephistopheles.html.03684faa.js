Its purpose covers many uses, like returning twofold to his opponent the wounds he himself has received from them, sowing discord in one\u2019s personal relationships, giving nightmares by using incubi, and so forth. It is even difficult for the average Mage to resist it.</p><p><strong>Innocent Monster: [B]</strong></p><p>Contract Devil \u25A0\u25A0\u25A0\u25A0\u25A0\u25A0\u25A0\u25A0\u25A0\u25A0\u25A0\u25A0\u25A0\u25A0. The name of a monster that had Mephistopheles\u2019 past and the way he ought to be distorted according to the image born from his deeds while alive. His abilities and appearance have been completely transformed. In his case, there is nothing but merits, such as having his Curse Techniques strengthened, possessing Magecraft that reached the level of a Noble Phantasm, and so forth. A first-class devil.</p><p><strong>The Clown\u2019s Laughter: [A+]</strong></p><p>A Skill derived from Innocent Monster. As a(n established) devil, Mephistopheles can put an intense heavy pressure on the entirety of mankind as a species. If there is a possibility of failure in any situation, it will fail without exception, one falling into a state like they had been abandoned by fortune.</p><h2 id="noble-phantasm-s" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#noble-phantasm-s" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Noble Phantasm(s)</h2><h1 id="tick-tock-bomb-dozing-bomb" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#tick-tock-bomb-dozing-bomb" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Tick-Tock Bomb: Dozing Bomb</h1><ul><li>Rank: A+</li><li>Classification: Anti-Army Noble Phantasm</li><li>Range: 1~10</li><li>Maximum Number of Targets: 30 people</li></ul><p>A kind of Curse Technique that intentionally lays bugs into one\u2019s Magic Circuits and the Spiritual Bodies of Servants before making them explode by causing an impact on them. Specifically, they appear in some image that is like a combination of a pocket watch and a bomb. Mephistopheles installs these on the field so they would explode on contact\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014or rather, that is how he pretends to use them in such a method.</p><p>But actually, on the occasion of having its \u201CTrue Name\u201D invoked, it results in a situation where the targets that are within a medium range will have bombs inserted inside their bodies. In this situation, a check based on one\u2019s resistance to curses is carried out to prevent this. The maximum number of bombs per person is five, and in addition, including the ones installed on the field and the like, it is possible to install a total of thirty bombs. Of course, Mephistopheles can just finish his targets off right there and then if he detonates the bombs inserted inside their bodies, but he likes to take the opportunity to have the overall picture of the bombs being inside their bodies stand out to them on purpose, choosing a means of having them obey him as well by threatening them. It is possible to say that this unscrupulous Noble Phantasm is as if his trickiness and ruthlessness had combined together.</p><h1 id="character" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#character" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Character</h1><h2 id="pronouns" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#pronouns" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Pronouns</h2><ul><li>First Person Pronoun: watakushi</li><li>Second Person Pronoun: anata-sama</li><li>Third Person Pronouns: ano kata / kare / kanojo, etc.</li></ul><h2 id="personality" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#personality" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Personality</h2><p>Mephistopheles acts as someone cheerful and easygoing, and because he takes up a jestful attitude at all times no matter the kind of occasion it is, one cannot feel a sense of seriousness from him. That is to say, he is more cruel than what anyone can imagine, and he is similarly cruel towards his Master too. He is really like \u201Cmaking fun\u201D of the whole world, and if he is happy, it seems he is willing to kill Masters as well.</p><h2 id="attitude-towards-master" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#attitude-towards-master" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Attitude Towards Master</h2><p>At a first glance, Mephistopheles faithfully serves in a cheerful manner. However, regarding his Master, he basically does not think of them as anything but \u201Ca toy to entertain himself with\u201D to a degree, and he will drive his Master into despair if given the chance. In the case where his Master has vigilantly restrained every way for him to act against them, even though unwillingly, Mephistopheles will accept the relationship between a master and a servant. He basically does not take up the \u201Cdisobeying one\u2019s commands\u201D attitude. However, it is a different story of whether or not he properly understands and acts on the commands.</p><p>And from there progressing one step even further, where a situation has appeared in that his Master had deepened their bond with him while accepting all of those wickedness and immaturity of his, it seems Mephistopheles will fight while gambling his life for the sake of his Master, all with pleasure and while laughing.</p><h2 id="dialogue-examples" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#dialogue-examples" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Dialogue Examples</h2><p>\u201CGreetings, greetings.

Please kindly understand that these horns are decorations.\u201D</p><p>\u201COh? Master. You are also making an amusing face, no? What happened? Have you made up your mind on what you even want to do if it is for the sake of having your wish granted?<br> Peaceful, so peaceful like the life of a single child.\u201D</p><p>\u201COh dear! Master. You are a human being who cannot help being very careless! It is no wonder I have been summoned as you have only succeeded in doing reckless things!\u201D</p><p>\u201CMake the name of Mephistopheles my True Name!

He is an astrologer and an alchemist, and the devil he contracted with is Mephistopheles.</p><p>Mephistopheles is the Devil of Temptation in \u201CFaust\u201D, and he played a bet with God on whether or not he was made to corrupt Dr. Faust.</p><p>In the end, Mephistopheles was defeated in this bet, and his wish to acquire Faust\u2019s soul had not come true, but it is said that the real Faust, in the middle of his alchemy experiment, was killed in a bombing where his whole body violently exploded and broke apart into five pieces. It did not become clear whether this was Mephistopheles carrying out his contract, or if something separate was the main cause of Faust\u2019s death.</p><p>\u2026 In this work, Mephistopheles is a kind of familiar cast by Dr. Faust; namely, a sort of homunculus. Dr. Faust, with his gifted engineering, had advanced homunculus technology several generations ahead of his time, but because of his strange sense of aesthetics, he chose to strengthen the homunculus\u2019 self (ego). A homunculus that is exceedingly full of human traits\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014That is the key part of \u201CMephistopheles\u201D; furthermore, by being clad in that legend, the Servant Caster \u2013 Mephistopheles, was born.</p><p>\u201CI\u2026 was born to be a Servant.\u201D</p><p>Pay special attention to Mephistopheles\u2019 face that feigns ignorance. Indeed, it may not become known that although Mephistopheles was born to be a Servant, since there was no need for him to have a person who he could call \u2018Master\u2019\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><h2 id="related-characters" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#related-characters" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Related Characters</h2><p>This genius devil is not always lonely.</p><p>Ok, Mephistopheles is just a little lonely.</p><h2 id="comment-from-the-illustrator" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#comment-from-the-illustrator" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Comment from the Illustrator</h2><p>I viewed Mephistopheles as and designed him in the image of an abnormal, visually-looking clown. In relation to his clothing, because the Director was worried about it, having said that \u201CShimokoshi-kun, they are not good clothes to wear when he is getting on a bicycle\u201D, they had changed into snug clothing that is like a cycling jersey. I tried to make his overall design insect-like and with gaudy-ish hues; doing things like adding some tactile-like horns of a longhorn beetle, and so on.</p><p>Mephistopheles\u2019 weapon. I thought it would be normal if it was a cane (stick), but it was going to be a pair of scissors by the time his character design came together, and they particularly have no significance. Say, it was nice for Mr. Koyasu to be given the assignment for his voice, given that I was drawing Mephistopheles\u2019 pictures while imagining his voice, so when the cast was decided, I was happy. Just like Mephistopheles\u2019 image!
