The knights of the legendary Camelot who appeared in that era, drawn by the Lion King. When the Lion King disappears, they disappear as well. However, the \u201Ccommon soldiers\u201D were invited by the Lion King\u2019s call, but they are not knights of Camelot, rather they are soldiers from all over Britain. Gawain\u2019s subordinates were soldiers from Orkney, and Lancelot\u2019s subordinates were soldiers from the French territory. Each Knight of the Round Table\u2019s subordinates were as such.

Gawain supervises the Holy City\u2019s defense forces and trains the soldiers. Mordred suppresses and cleans up enemies outside the Holy City as a raid unit. Lancelot\u2019s assignment was the same as Mordred\u2019s, but his main responsibility was investigating and monitoring the Egyptian territory, and driving out (protecting) the refugees.
