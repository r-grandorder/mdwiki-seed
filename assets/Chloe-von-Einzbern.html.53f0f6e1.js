Depending on what you have to say, I may have to contact the authorities.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Mash, you look a little scary.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> This is my default expression.

I came over to see if there was anything we could do to improve the situation.</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> If you can increase the magical energy supplied to me,<br> I can increase my output, which will help everyone.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I-I didn&#39;t realize that&#39;s what you were talking about. I just thought...</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> You thought...?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> N-no!<br> Nothing at all!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> So this is about getting stronger. I believe this is one of the most important topics to discuss here in Chaldea. Absolutely, yes.</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> Yep, yep.<br> You really are cute, Mash.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I don&#39;t know why...but I feel like I was just teased by an older sister or something...</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> I think they&#39;re around here somewhere.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> We tagged along because you asked us to,<br> but why did you take us here?</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> I heard there&#39;s good snacks around here.<br> I figured I could taste them all at once.</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> Ah! I smell something delectable over there!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Um...what happened to you getting stronger?</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> There they are!

Are we allowed to talk normally?</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong><br> We thought chanting \u201Ccha cha\u201D was customary in a Japanese tea party.</p><p><strong>Chacha:</strong><br> A tea ceremony isn&#39;t this wacky! A Japanese tea ceremony is a social gathering that mixes etiquette and being fashionable!</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> I feel things went off the rails somewhat when Chacha started randomly shouting \u201CChacha!\u201D</p><p><strong>Chacha:</strong><br> Chacha!?</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme &amp; Jack:</strong><br> Cha-cha-cha!</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> This is so stupid it&#39;s hurting my head...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Setting matters of intellect aside,<br> those girls are all pure and innocent.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> For you to attack them and...k-k-kiss them...<br> I don&#39;t think we can permit such an immoral act...</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> Yeehaw!

But there&#39;s nothing we can do about it now, is there?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> We. Saw. Nothing. Got it?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> This is definitely something I won&#39;t want to witness!</p><hr><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> Whew. They fought hard,<br> but they were no match for the Serial Kisser Squad.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> And now we&#39;re a part of this shameful group!</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> Now that they&#39;ve all passed out...</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> Time for a taste\u2606</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> Hm...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Oh...my...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Ahhh...w-wow...that sound...ahhhh!<br> That&#39;s too much...!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> S-Senpai! I don&#39;t think this is right!<br> This is...this is SO wrong in SO many ways!!!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> It&#39;s just kids playing. It&#39;s fine.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> It&#39;s only an exchange of magical energy. It&#39;s fine.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Y-you really think so?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> N-no, you&#39;re right. The...methodology may be troubling, but it really just amounts to a medical procedure.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It is just one way to exchange magical energy.<br> Yes... So there is no problem here...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...No problem...I hope...</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> Ummmmmmf... Phew!</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> ...Wanna try, Mash?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ABSOLUTELY NOT!!!</p><p><strong>--ARROW--:</strong></p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> In the end, none of them were compatible.<br> I&#39;m disappointed...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I feel sorry for them...</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> I was hoping the ponytail witch Medea Lily would be the one... But even though she was unconscious, she had really strong magical resistance!</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> She was the hardest to deal with, despite how she looks. She&#39;s probably got a lot more going on than meets the eye.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Really? Out of those four, I feel she has the most common sense. ...Although that can be its own burden.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> So, boss. Who&#39;s your next victim?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> As much as I respect your adaptability, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s working in your favor this time, Senpai.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> The Serial Kisser Squad&#39;s journey continues...</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> It&#39;s good that you&#39;re really into my cause, but quit acting like that, it&#39;s gonna end up making things take a bad turn (read: get us shut down).</p><hr><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> Okay, next. I went after kiddos last time, so maybe I should look for a stronger girl this time.</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> Maybe I should find myself a king, or...oh!<br> Maybe a Berserker...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I predict a whole different kind of disaster from last time.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...To be quite clear,<br> disaster beyond reckoning is sure to ensue.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Is it girls only?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> You don&#39;t want boys?</p><hr><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> Eh? When it comes to boys, I wouldn&#39;t want them to get serious with me... None of them are my type anyway.</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> Oh wait... There are maybe one or two good ones,<br> but those guys...you know...honestly...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I-I don&#39;t know how to respond to that. I can only surmise that you have a very complicated situation here.</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> So there you have it.<br> Now let&#39;s keep looking for other girls with potential.</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> Girls like the last ones, the sort who aren&#39;t challenging, are just boring... I wanna try getting a strong girl to submit to me.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> You are much too gung-ho about these morally questionable endeavors!</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> Hmmm, is there anyone around? A cute and strong and stimulating girl...and possibly a Saber who&#39;s compatible with my class.</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> Yoohoo, are there any girl kings swinging their swords around here...?</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> After I give her a gentle thrashing, I wanna nurse her back to health with the utmost care and tenderness!</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> Where&#39;s the patient!?</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> ...?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> A wild head nurse appears.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Welp, you hoped for a Berserker. There you go.</p><hr><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> No, no, no! She&#39;s no good! I was trying to put up a flag to lure someone like Altria or Altera!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That last bit might have pushed her over the edge.<br> She&#39;s gone berserk herself.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> Do not fret. Now that I&#39;m here, I will thoroughly expunge this mental anguish troubling you.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> It will not be unnecessarily painful... That is, it will be excruciating, even highly traumatic, but that is only because it is necessary.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> Sadly, there is no anesthesia to numb pain of the heart or soul. I must ask you to grit your teeth and bear it.</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> We can&#39;t reason with her! Figures! Wh-what are we going to do with her? There&#39;s no way I can handle her!</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> No, no. There is nothing that cannot be handled.<br> Your perspective in this is all wrong.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> What cannot be dealt with simply must be amputated. All that is necessary to sustain a patient&#39;s life is to keep the vital organs intact.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> Despair only when there&#39;s nothing left to amputate!</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> It may sound like we&#39;re having a conversation, but you&#39;re actually talking to yourself! Argh! This is why Madness Enhancement EX is impossible to deal with!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Come on, that&#39;s a stimulating girl for you.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I thought you wanted to have a strong girl submit to you?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> S-Senpai!?<br> Please don&#39;t egg Chloe on!</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> A-are you telling me to attack her?<br> Seriously? Are you NUTS?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You can do it, Chloe.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Break through common sense and morality!</p><hr><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> ...Heh.</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> You&#39;re right. What was I thinking? Being scared of dessert (read: women) is so unlike me.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> U-um Chloe? You&#39;re kidding, right?<br> You&#39;re not really going to...?</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> The Serial Kissers never turn their backs on their prey! As long as there&#39;s a girl around, I&#39;ll try to jump them from behind!</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> Those lips of yours will be mine!<br> Brace yourself, head nurse! Or rather...!</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> Kill\u2606Kill\u2606Nurse!</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> Take my lips...?<br> Did you just say you mean to take my lips from me?</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> Manpower, medicine, bandages, bed, and other resources are all being taken and running low! And now you&#39;re trying to take away my lips too!?</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> Oops. I already decided I wouldn&#39;t talk to you. Instead of filling your mouth with words, I&#39;m going to fill it with something warm and wet!</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> I understand now. You are poison. You are the danger. You are an infection that must be eradicated!</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> Kill\u2606Kill\u2606Germs!!!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> (Gasp!) I&#39;m sorry! I could not intervene during that intense and bizarre back and forth.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> But...yes. Commencing battle!<br> Good luck!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> That...was an intense battle.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Had this been a manga,that battle would have taken three volumes.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I&#39;m not sure what you&#39;re saying,<br> but it truly was an epic battle...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> And I learned from this battle that fighting can be completely empty and futile... I have never in all my life felt so sad...</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> I managed to get a strong woman to submit to me, just like I wanted... It&#39;s nothing like I expected, though.</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> Whew... I&#39;m beat, so I should go home and take a shower.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> W-wait! Did you forget your initial plan?</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> If you leave now, what was the point in fighting Nightingale!?</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> I forgot.<br> Oh, right, right.</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> But do I really have to?<br> I&#39;m kind of over it.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> After all that effort...!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You can&#39;t give up just because you got sick of it.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> You need to take responsibility till the very end.</p><hr><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> Okay... This is such a mood killer,<br> but I guess I have to do it.</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> Then, here I go...<br> Hmf...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You&#39;re watching pretty intently, huh?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Why don&#39;t you have her do it to you too, Mash?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I-I&#39;m not looking,<br> and I don&#39;t want to get involved!</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> ...Pfaaah!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> H-how did it go, Chloe?</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> Well, you know... I kinda expected it,<br> but...she tasted like antiseptic.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Ah, well that makes sense,<br> but I really wasn&#39;t asking how she tasted...</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> Oh you mean, magical energy? That was so-so too. I suppose I was wrong to expect more from a Berserker in the first place...</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> ...Wrong.</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> Eh?</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> Wrong...! Wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong!!!<br> Everything is wrong!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Nightingale&#39;s awake!<br> No, perhaps she was never unconscious...</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> So what am I wrong about!?</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> Everything!<br> Your resuscitation procedure is totally wrong!!!</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> Huh?<br> Resuscitation!? Huh!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Oh, Nightingale just reached out and grabbed Chloe&#39;s throat...</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> First, find the airway! Tilt the face sideways, and if there is anything inside the mouth, scoop it out with your fingers!</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> Bleeah... Your finger...! Ack!</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> Lift the chin up, pinch the nose,<br> and blow in with all your might for one second!</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> Hey, I\u2013hrmgh! Ack!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I don&#39;t think you need to breathe with all your might...</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> But most important are chest compressions! Punch the chest one hundred times per minute to force the heart to restart!</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> (Cough) ...Heart!? But it didn&#39;t stop...<br> Ow...owowowowowowowowowow!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Multiple hits with no rest between them!?</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> ...You have just witnessed a chief modern medical technique to combat death. It is known as CPR.</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> ...That isn&#39;t...right...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Um. I don&#39;t know how to react to that.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That was a wonderful demonstration. The only thing that was unfortunate was that, rather than being a resuscitation exercise, it is guaranteed to kill the targum, patient.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> Mash. Should your respiratory organs shut down, come to me immediately. I will be sure to resuscitate you.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> N-no thank you!<br> Um, I&#39;m fine with Chaldea&#39;s medical equipment!</p><p><strong>--ARROW--:</strong></p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> I-I thought I was gonna die...<br> Ungh...what did I get myself into...?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Nightingale really was unexpected. By the way, are you familiar with the phrase \u201Cwhat goes around, comes around\u201D?</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> Hmmm, nope.</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> Oh? There&#39;s a flyer posted in the hallway.<br> Actually, there&#39;s a ton out here. Let&#39;s see what it says.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> \u201CWarning: Serial kisser on the loose\u201D</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> \u201CFemale Servants should stay in their rooms.\u201D</p><hr><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> What the heck is this!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Looks like word of Chloe&#39;s evil doings has spread.<br> Perhaps now your wicked quest will come to an end.</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> But I haven&#39;t finished playing around... I mean...I still haven&#39;t found someone who&#39;s compatible with me!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Time to quit...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> The Serial Kisser Squad will be dissolved...</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Indeed. We got dragged into this because of Chloe&#39;s insistence, but that will now come to an end. We cannot overlook your deeds any more.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> If you continue to corrupt Chaldea&#39;s morals,<br> I will stand in your way as Chaldea&#39;s shield!</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> Mash is betraying me now!? Unbelievable...<br> Desertion will not be permitted!</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> Come on! Don&#39;t be such a square just because you wear glasses! You dummy! You...Mashmallow Goody Two-shoes!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I never once joined your squad, and I am not acting like a square. Also I don&#39;t understand why you&#39;d call me Mashmallow.</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> Ungh... That Shielder is so serious.<br> Fine. Be that way.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Whew. I&#39;m glad she listened.</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> But there&#39;s one thing I want you to know: it may seem like I was playing around, but I really did want to make myself stronger.</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> I want to get strong for Fujimaru...<br> No, I wanted to be useful for [\u2642 big brother /\u2640\uFE0F big sister}...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Chloe...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Don&#39;t worry. I believe you. Sometimes you may go overboard, but I also know you have an inherent kindness within you.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> As for you getting stronger... Let&#39;s think about it together. I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll find something for you.</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> Thanks.<br> But...it&#39;s fine.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Eh? But...</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> Is this it?<br> We&#39;re coming in.</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> Huh, Chloe?<br> What&#39;s going on?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> We&#39;re in...Illya&#39;s room?</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> Mash! And [\u2642 big brother /\u2640\uFE0F big sister} Fujimaru too!<br> What great timing!</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> Someone in red was teaching me how to make sweets.<br> I just finished up a batch.</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> I&#39;ll brew up some tea, so let&#39;s have them together.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> What a wonderful, kind invitation. Even though you&#39;re so young, you are very domestic, Illya.</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> What is this feeling? I feel secure, as if I&#39;m in my childhood home. And I simultaneously sense a newlywed and old-wifey aura from her...</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> Yeah...I knew it all along...<br> In the end, everyone wants to go back to Illya.</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> I don&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking about...<br> Oh, by the way! Chloe, you should be careful too!</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> I heard that there&#39;s some serial attacker lurking around in Chaldea! There&#39;s tons of victims already!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Uh...um...</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> Hm?</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> That&#39;s me.</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> ...Come again?</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> And now I&#39;m here to make you my last victim.</p><p><strong>Illya &amp; Mash:</strong><br> ...Come AGAIN!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> So you knew from the beginning.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> The one most compatible to you is Illya.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> W-wait a minute...!<br> Um...um...what you&#39;re trying to say is...?</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> Yep. The ones I attacked before were just for fun. I always knew the one most compatible with me was Illya!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I was foolish to believe in Chloe even for a minute!!!</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> I&#39;m running low on magical energy from that last battle! I&#39;m gonna suck you harder than usual, Illya!</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> Eh? What!? What&#39;s going on!?<br> Somebody explain!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Please run, Illya!!!</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> Waaaaaah!!!<br> Something like this always happens to me!!!</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> Yahoo!!!<br> It&#39;s hunting time!!!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> How did we end up chasing her all the way to a forest...?</p><hr><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> ... (Cough) ...</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> Yep. Delicious.</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> That&#39;s the familiar taste I enjoyed in Miyama. I think the fact that it&#39;s nothing out of the ordinary is proof that I succeeded.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Oh... So in the end, I could not prevent Chloe&#39;s barbarism... I failed to defend Chaldea&#39;s morality...</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> Illya doesn&#39;t count. We&#39;re like twins.<br> Just think of it as sisterly bonding.</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> ... (Twitch, twitch)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> And this is the result of that bonding?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> N-no...I&#39;m not going to comment on Chloe&#39;s bizarre morality anymore.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> So you found an efficient source of magical energy.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Can we expect you to be better in battle?</p><hr><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> Of course! From now on, if Illya is by my side,<br> I&#39;ll just keep sucking from her!</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> I&#39;m kinda disappointed I never found another snack other than Illya, but I&#39;ll just keep looking on my own time.</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> And whenever Illya&#39;s not around, I&#39;m counting on you to supply me with magical energy, okay Master?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Leave it to me!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Leave it to me! Always!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...May I interject?<br> I just remembered my first question about all of this...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Do you do it...with Senpai...normally?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> (Silence)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> No comment.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> You know...with Chloe...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> DOING SUCH THINGS AS THIS!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> (Silence)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> No comment.</p><hr><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> Ahahaha!<br> I knew Mash was jealous!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Th-that&#39;s not what this is about!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The magical energy necessary for a Servant to manifest is supplied by Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That&#39;s why...there should be no need to siphon extra from other Servants...let alone from Master!</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> I know. That&#39;s why I&#39;ve been saying \u201Csnack\u201D this whole time.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Come again?</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> A healthy lifestyle requires three meals a day, plus delicious snacks in between.</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> Actually, I can live off of my snacks,<br> so they really count as my meals! In other words...</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> My meals are snacks!!! (BAM)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That doesn&#39;t make any sense!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> (It&#39;s almost time for supplies to be distributed...I&#39;m going to the Command Room.)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> (Slyly walk away)</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Senpai? Why are you making a mad dash out of here without even looking back!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Please wait, Senpai! If you&#39;re running away, you must be hiding something! Explain...explain yourself!!!</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> And there they go.<br> Mash is seriously cute.</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> And Master didn&#39;t need to fret. I haven&#39;t done anything too bad that Mash would be concerned about. I only took a little sample.</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> But if Mash doesn&#39;t make a move soon...</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> U-unnnnnngh...</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> Oh I forgot.<br> I forgot you were lying there, Illya.</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> H-horrible!<br> You treated me worse than usual...!</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> Yeah, yeah. Sorry.<br> I admit I went a little overboard this time.</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> Now come on, stand up.<br> Let&#39;s go home and have some tea.</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> Tea... Oh right.</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> You made some snacks for us, right?<br> Let&#39;s have them together.</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> Together for...for now\u266A</p>', 387);
