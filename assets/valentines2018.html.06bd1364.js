That&#39;s rare.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong><br> I am sure you&#39;d think that way. After all, Lady Mash is the usually the one to wake you up.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong><br> Unfortunately, as you may be aware, she&#39;s battling with chocolate at the moment.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Where&#39;s Mash?</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong><br> Well, well, have you forgotten, Master?</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong><br> All of the female Servants, including her, are spending all their time on chocolate.</p><hr><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong><br> Some of them... Like Lady Artemis, for example, is making the chocolate for their true love.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong><br> Lady Mata Hari, Lady Antoinette, and Lady Boudica seem to be making chocolate for everybody.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong><br> I guess you could call those types of chocolate, friendship chocolate.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong><br> Also, although it&#39;s only my own speculation, I have an eerie feeling about what they might get in return on White Day, except Lady Boudica.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong><br> I mean, the majority of male Servants probably never received a chocolate in their life, and glare at the world with eyes that look like the Tibetan Fox.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong><br> Well, there are also Servants who don&#39;t care much about this kind of occasion, but that&#39;s that.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong><br> \u201CIt (Jealousy) is the green-eyed monster which doth mock the meat it feeds on.\u201D</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong><br> ...That&#39;s the saying, no?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Would they be happy to get one from me?</p><hr><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong><br> Ohhh, Master&#39;s handmade chocolate!<br> That would make any Servant happy!</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong><br> Servants are emotional entities.
