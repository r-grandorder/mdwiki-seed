You remember anything?</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong><br> No, huh.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong><br> Looks like you and I are in the same boat then.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong><br> The situation looks pretty grim.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong><br> I think we&#39;re in Japan sometime in the 2000s,<br> but as you can see, there&#39;s been a huge disaster.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong><br> And we can&#39;t seem to get in touch with Chaldea either.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong><br> Looks like our only choice is to make our way through this burning city.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong><br> I&#39;m sure you&#39;re not thrilled about being stuck with me, but I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll find a Servant who&#39;s a better fit for this sooner or later.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong><br> In the meantime, I&#39;ll start by cleaning up the riffraff.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong><br> Don&#39;t fall behind. Make sure you keep up.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> W-will do!</p><hr><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong><br> Well that was a waste of time. Come on, let&#39;s hurry.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You know, I&#39;ve been wondering for a while now\u2013</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong><br> Whatever it is, I&#39;m not interested unless it has to do with my capabilities.</p><hr><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong><br> That said, the fact that you still have energy for idle chatter is good.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong><br> If there&#39;s something you wanna ask me on the way,<br> go ahead. If I feel like it, I&#39;ll answer.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong><br> If you&#39;re wondering what I am, that&#39;s hard to explain.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong><br> As a Master, you ought to know that every hero has another side to them.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong><br> Some of them, they slaughter innocent people without so much as blinking. Others, they fight to protect their country like their lives depended on it.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong><br> Most of those types that everyone looks up to have some sort of hidden cruel side.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong><br> Then you have Servants, which reflect only one side of the hero they represent.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong><br> Sometimes, a Servant&#39;ll reflect that hero&#39;s hidden side...</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong><br> ...and sometimes, their Spirit Origin&#39;ll end up corrupted for one reason or another.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong><br> Servants like that all get lumped into a different category.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong><br> We&#39;re talking the possible destruction of all of humanity here. We need all the help we can get, and we can&#39;t be choosy about whether we get it from good or bad people.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong><br> ...But even there, I&#39;m an unusual case.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong><br> The other me was a nameless hero,<br> shaped by society at large.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong><br> It might&#39;ve been a one-of-a-kind event,<br> but it still happened naturally.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong><br> But me, I&#39;m not one of a kind. I&#39;m just twisted.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong><br> The past that made me a hero is gone, and I don&#39;t remember anything about who I used to be.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong><br> All that&#39;s left now is my ability to kill my enemies.<br> That&#39;s the only reason I materialized.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Is that why you spend most of your time in your spirit form?</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong><br> Yeah.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong><br> The others try to find meaning in existence, but since I&#39;m just a weapon, I don&#39;t bother with anything outside of a fight.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong><br> After all, no one should go waving weapons around when there&#39;s no battles to be fought, right?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Then, your memories</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong><br> I know in my head that the other guy is who I used to be.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong><br> But it doesn&#39;t feel real. It&#39;s like we&#39;ve been separated into two completely different people.</p><hr><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong><br> Anyway, enough prattling. Come on, Master.</p><p><strong>--ARROW--:</strong></p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> He never remembers the intervening moments.<br> He simply wakes up, and there he is.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Then he turns around...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> ...and there is only hell as far as the eye can see.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> A place so awful it&#39;d feel presumptuous to call it a battlefield that suits him.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> He figures out who he needs to kill, and quickly focuses his effort on doing so.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> He wastes not a moment,<br> even if he never knows why he does so.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> But the worst part is...he doesn&#39;t even care anymore.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> He leaps into the darkness,<br> and feels as though he&#39;s falling ever deeper into the abyss.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> \u201CHey, it&#39;s not all bad,\u201D he sneers to himself,<br> \u201Cat least I&#39;ve still got something to lose.\u201D</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong><br> ...It&#39;s faint, but there are traces of magecraft being used up ahead.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong><br> And since I don&#39;t see any other obvious leads,<br> I guess we&#39;ll just have to head there next.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong><br> Come on. It&#39;ll be a walk.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong><br> ...What? You still want to talk?</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong><br> I can tell you&#39;re the inquisitive type,<br> but you&#39;re better off forgetting about it.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong><br> Other Servants have pasts and presents.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong><br> They&#39;ve got honor, goals, purpose, glory, desires,<br> dreams, feelings... All that stuff.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong><br> I don&#39;t have any of that.<br> I have nothing to give, and nothing to offer.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong><br> ...That&#39;s the main thing I&#39;ve got going for me. The cradle of my origin.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong><br> So there&#39;s no point in learning about me.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong><br> All you need to know is what I&#39;m capable of.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong><br> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> A Shadow Servant...</p><hr><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong><br> Is this guy why we&#39;re stuck wandering around here...?<br> Well, I guess it doesn&#39;t matter.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong><br> Fire up your magical energy, Master.<br> We&#39;re taking him down!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong><br> ...<br> ...Guess he wasn&#39;t the one.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong><br> But at least I found some new traces of magecraft.<br> Come on, let&#39;s keep moving.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> R-right!</p><hr><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong><br> Why don&#39;t I ever talk to my other self?</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong><br> Why would I? There&#39;s no point.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong><br> If he&#39;s all that&#39;s left of the man he used to be,<br> I barely qualify as whatever&#39;s left over from that...</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong><br> No, even that&#39;s giving me too much credit. If that were the case, I&#39;d still have some reason to exist.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong><br> But I&#39;m just a thing, without any purpose.<br> It wouldn&#39;t make any difference if I was gone.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong><br> As far as the other guy&#39;s concerned, he could kill me a thousand times and it still wouldn&#39;t be enough.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong><br> ...These traces lead into that cave. Let&#39;s hurry.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong><br> ...Don&#39;t you think it&#39;s strange?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Don&#39;t I think what&#39;s strange?</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I do, but what other choice do we have?</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong><br> Gotcha.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong><br> At least you&#39;re not as dense as I thought.</p><hr><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong><br> I&#39;m guessing this is a dreamworld.<br> An artificial hell. The end of nothingness.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong><br> A place that makes you confront your sins and demands you pay for them.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong><br> ...I&#39;ve seen it before.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong><br> But I don&#39;t know why we&#39;re here.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong><br> I&#39;m not looking for anything from you,<br> and you&#39;re not looking for anything from me.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong><br> We&#39;re just helping each other out. That&#39;s all there is to it.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong><br> So then, why am I\u2013why are we here?</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong><br> Anyway, let&#39;s keep moving. Whatever&#39;s going on here,<br> we&#39;ll have to take care of it before we can go home.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I might not remember them myself,<br> but I do have records of my past deeds.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I know exactly how many people I killed,<br> and how many mages.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I don&#39;t feel any guilt over their deaths,<br> and I&#39;ve never been punished for them either.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Every bullet I fire hits its mark,<br> making the world safer.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> ...But the path I&#39;ve walked isn&#39;t mine alone.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> When did my path split from his?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I&#39;m not jealous. I don&#39;t envy him.<br> I just find myself wondering from time to time.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> It feels like a monster with its jaws open wide is slowly making its way toward me.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I&#39;d probably feel a lot better if I just let it swallow me up.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> But I&#39;m not that far gone.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> ...Not yet, anyway.</p><p><strong>--ARROW--:</strong></p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> There&#39;s nothing here...</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong><br> You&#39;re right.<br> But I&#39;m pretty sure this is our last stop.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I kind of thought we&#39;d find the shadowy guy with the foul mouth here.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong><br> Who&#39;re you talking about?</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong><br> ...Ah, whatever. Just hang on.</p><hr><p><strong>???:</strong><br> If you&#39;re here, then I doubt anybody summoned me.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong><br> That&#39;s right.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong><br> You&#39;re like a tumor that snuck its way into my dreams, aren&#39;t you? I&#39;m taking you out and getting Master home.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong><br> Hope you enjoyed your life, because it ends here.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Oh, I&#39;m pretty used to that sort of thing by now.<br> That said...</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> ...I&#39;m not just going to abandon my survival instinct and let you chop my head off.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong><br> ...The hell?</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> What&#39;s there to be upset about?<br> Isn&#39;t that why you need a Master?</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong><br> No...you&#39;re right.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong><br> Come on, Master. This is the last battle we&#39;ve got to fight to get home.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong><br> Let&#39;s go.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> I see. Well, for your sake,<br> I certainly hope you can return home.</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> ...!</p><p><strong>A\uFF1AEmiya Alter:</strong><br> ...Something&#39;s not right.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> What is it?</p><hr><p><strong>A\uFF1AEmiya Alter:</strong><br> ...I know my swords and bullets tore through you.</p><p><strong>A\uFF1AEmiya Alter:</strong><br> So how are you still alive?</p><p><strong>C\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Why wouldn&#39;t I be?<br> A Servant can&#39;t go down without a fight.</p><p><strong>A\uFF1AEmiya Alter:</strong><br> ...Huh!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Th-there&#39;s two of him!?</p><hr><p><strong>D\uFF1AEmiya Alter?:</strong><br> ...There you have it.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1AEmiya Alter?:</strong><br> I&#39;m sure you can understand,<br> since we are the same person.</p><p><strong>A\uFF1AEmiya Alter:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>A\uFF1AEmiya Alter:</strong><br> ...Yeah, I get it now.<br> I was the tumor.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1AEmiya Alter:</strong><br> Sure looks that way.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1AEmiya Alter:</strong><br> There really isn&#39;t much difference between us, though.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1AEmiya Alter:</strong><br> Our rote, mechanical way of life is just so simple that even the concept of who we are starts to get hazy.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1AEmiya Alter:</strong><br> That&#39;s the long and short of it, Master.<br> Now stand back a bit.</p><p><strong>B\uFF1A???:</strong><br> ...You came here to save Fujimaru?</p><p><strong>D\uFF1AEmiya Alter:</strong><br> Of course. Despite everything, I&#39;m still [\u2642 his /\u2640\uFE0F her} Servant.</p><p><strong>B\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Hmph.</p><p><strong>B\uFF1A???:</strong><br> I might be the cancer here, but you&#39;re not far off from being just like me.</p><p><strong>B\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Whatever fate&#39;s got in store for us can&#39;t be that different.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1AEmiya Alter:</strong><br> ...You might be right.</p><p><strong>B\uFF1A???:</strong><br> That said, it does look like I&#39;m getting in the way.</p><p><strong>B\uFF1A???:</strong><br> So then, there&#39;s only one way to end this.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1AEmiya Alter:</strong><br> Don&#39;t look at him, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>B\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Screw that. You should see this through to the end.</p><p><strong>B\uFF1A???:</strong><br> You should see what happens when a man who&#39;s lost sight of everything is as far gone as he can be.</p><p><strong>B\uFF1A???:</strong><br> I&#39;d say it&#39;s a fitting end for me, don&#39;t you think?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> He...turned his gun...on himself...</p><p><strong>D\uFF1AEmiya Alter:</strong><br> I told you not to look.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> No...</p><p><strong>D\uFF1AEmiya Alter:</strong><br> Don&#39;t worry about it. It&#39;s what had to be done to resolve this.</p><hr><p><strong>D\uFF1AEmiya Alter:</strong><br> I don&#39;t blame you for not realizing he was an imposter. He wasn&#39;t.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1AEmiya Alter:</strong><br> This dream\u2013if that&#39;s even what it really is\u2013will be over soon.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1AEmiya Alter:</strong><br> Once you&#39;re awake, you should forget this ever happened.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1AEmiya Alter:</strong><br> It&#39;s all been just a nightmare. That&#39;s all.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1AEmiya Alter:</strong><br> Once you forget it, I will too. After all...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> &quot;Even things that happened five minutes ago feel like a dream from long ago.&quot;</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong><br> You up now, Master?</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong><br> There was something strange happening with my Spirit Origin. It happened right around the time your vitals started going haywire.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong><br> Guess you and I were sharing one of those Servant dream things.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong><br> You look like you&#39;re all right now, but make sure you get yourself a mental health checkup too.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong><br> So? What&#39;d you see in there?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I don&#39;t remember a thing.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong><br> Good. It&#39;s better that way.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong><br> Don&#39;t worry about it.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong><br> Whatever you saw wasn&#39;t worth remembering.<br> It was just one possible end to one man&#39;s life.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong><br> It was a glimpse of a future that has to come, sooner or later...</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong><br> Hmph. But I digress.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> All I remember is that it made me really sad...</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong><br> ...I see.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong><br> Well, whatever you&#39;re sad about, I&#39;m sure you don&#39;t have to be. When you get right down to it, I&#39;m just a bullet.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong><br> I don&#39;t have any thoughts or ideals. Once you fire me, I&#39;m gone. Out of sight, out of mind.</p><hr><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong><br> Anyway, what do you say we get going?</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong><br> You&#39;re on another mission to save the world,<br> just like always, right?</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong><br> Like I said, I&#39;m a bullet, so lock and load.
