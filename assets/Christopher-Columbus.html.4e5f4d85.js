Is that how I came off?</p><p><strong>Columbus:</strong><br> Sorry &#39;bout that. It&#39;s been so long since I came to Master&#39;s room, I must&#39;ve been more nervous than I thought.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> (I wouldn&#39;t really say that expression looked at all nervous...)</p><p><strong>Columbus:</strong><br> Anyway, I didn&#39;t realize you were here too, girly.<br> ...Hope I&#39;m not interrupting anything.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> N-no, you&#39;re not. Senpai and I were just enjoying a hot drink together, like we usually do...!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Today we&#39;re having hot cocoa. Would you like a cup too, Columbus? It really warms you up.</p><p><strong>Columbus:</strong><br> ...Cacao, huh...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> You don&#39;t care for cocoa?</p><p><strong>Columbus:</strong><br> No, it&#39;s not that.</p><p><strong>Columbus:</strong><br> It&#39;s just that every time I see it,<br> I&#39;m reminded of the huge opportunity I missed.</p><p><strong>Columbus:</strong><br> I never even realized it until someone else told me what I&#39;d passed up...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> But aren&#39;t you the one who made cacao popular?</p><hr><p><strong>Columbus:</strong><br> Exactly.</p><p><strong>Columbus:</strong><br> Sure, I was the one who first brought cacao beans back from the New World, but I didn&#39;t really have any idea what they might be for.</p><p><strong>Columbus:</strong><br> They didn&#39;t catch on as sweets until years later.<br> Ugh, even today it kills me to think about it.</p><p><strong>Columbus:</strong><br> &#39;Course that was all a long time ago, but still...</p><p><strong>Columbus:</strong><br> ...I smell an opportunity to make big cacao money here in Chaldea, too...</p><p><strong>Columbus:</strong><br> But I digress. I&#39;m here &#39;cause I got a little favor to ask you, Master.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You don&#39;t say... (Suspicious stare)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> A favor, huh? (Suspicious stare)</p><hr><p><strong>Columbus:</strong><br> C&#39;mon, don&#39;t give me that look!</p><p><strong>Columbus:</strong><br> I don&#39;t know what shenanigans any other versions of me might&#39;ve gotten up to, but I&#39;m your faithful Servant.</p><p><strong>Columbus:</strong><br> ...So long as you assign me the right kinds of work, that is.</p><p><strong>Columbus:</strong><br> I always get a thrill whenever I help you open the door to the treasury.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I had a feeling that might be the case.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Good to have you on board...I think.</p><p><strong>Columbus:</strong><br> No problem. There&#39;s nobody better at collecting shiny baubles, you know!</p><hr><p><strong>Columbus:</strong><br> Anyway, getting back on track...here&#39;s what I had in mind.</p><p><strong>Columbus:</strong><br> There&#39;s a whole boatload of Servants here in Chaldea besides me, right?</p><p><strong>Columbus:</strong><br> Some of them have invited me to join their clubs,<br> and I&#39;ve been meaning to turn them all down.</p><p><strong>Columbus:</strong><br> But for some strange reason, people keep taking what I say and do the wrong way.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I see... I can&#39;t imagine why...</p><p><strong>Columbus:</strong><br> I&#39;m not trying to offend anyone by turning them down, but I might be coming off harsher than I mean to...</p><p><strong>Columbus:</strong><br> ...and ruffling the rest of Chaldea&#39;s feathers as a result.</p><p><strong>Columbus:</strong><br> Since you&#39;re our Master, I&#39;m hoping you can help me put a stop to all of that.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Okay...but what exactly did you have in mind?</p><hr><p><strong>Columbus:</strong><br> Don&#39;t worry, it&#39;s easy.</p><p><strong>Columbus:</strong><br> All you have to do is be there with me, and throw me a lifeline if things start going off the rails.</p><p><strong>Columbus:</strong><br> You&#39;re a special [\u2642 guy /\u2640\uFE0F gal} to all us Servants, after all.</p><p><strong>Columbus:</strong><br> Just having you there for these sorts of conversations will make a world of difference.</p><p><strong>Columbus:</strong><br> If you&#39;ve got time to spare, Mash, it&#39;d be great to have you around too. You know pretty much every Servant here, don&#39;t you?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Well, sure, I don&#39;t mind coming along.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> But, I&#39;m curious: Why are you turning these invitations down in the first place?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> From what I know about these clubs, they just appear to be a way for their members to get to know each other better.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Is turning down an invitation to one really such a big deal?</p><p><strong>Columbus:</strong><br> No, no, it&#39;s not. And I know that.<br> There&#39;s no greater point to this or anything.</p><p><strong>Columbus:</strong><br> It&#39;s really just a me thing.<br> I just figure it&#39;s better to be true to myself.</p><p><strong>Columbus:</strong><br> ...Hey, let me ask you two something:<br> What word would you say best defines who I am?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Huh? Well, I&#39;d say you&#39;re...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> (Good question...)</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Uh, that&#39;s hard to say. Maybe an adventurer?<br> Or an explorer? You could also go with captain...</p><p><strong>Columbus:</strong><br> Haha, don&#39;t worry about answering.<br> I think you get my point.</p><p><strong>Columbus:</strong><br> Now let&#39;s go pay this first club a visit.<br> Hopefully they&#39;re the understanding types.</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong><br> Come! The deep blue seas await us with untold treasures!</p><p><strong>Anne:</strong><br> Hidden desert islands, skull marks on old maps,<br> unarmed trade ships just waiting to be plundered...</p><p><strong>Anne:</strong><br> If it&#39;s a pirate&#39;s life for you, this is the closest you&#39;ll get to it here in Chaldea!</p><p><strong>Anne &amp; Mary:</strong><br> Welcome to the Pirate Club!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Pirate Club...!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Four words: Pirates of the Chaldean...</p><hr><p><strong>Columbus:</strong><br> Hey there, ladies. For the moment, I just wanted to stop by and say thanks for the invite.</p><p><strong>Columbus:</strong><br> Is it just the two of you in this club?<br> What about that Brit...uh, Francis Drake, I think?</p><p><strong>Columbus:</strong><br> I could&#39;ve sworn I saw her name on the invitation too.</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong><br> Of course Captain Drake&#39;s a member.<br> She&#39;s just sleeping off a hangover.</p><p><strong>Anne:</strong><br> Sorry to disappoint you if you were looking forward to meeting her. But hey, since you&#39;re joining, you&#39;ll have plenty more chances to meet her!</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong><br> Oh, wait. Didn&#39;t Captain Drake kick the crap out of the Spanish Armada?</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong><br> Did you actually want to avoid her, not meet her?</p><p><strong>Columbus:</strong><br> No, no, nothing like that. I don&#39;t know how she feels about international relations, but I couldn&#39;t care less.</p><p><strong>Columbus:</strong><br> Besides, she just handed Espa\xF1a&#39;s asses to them &#39;cause England paid her good money for it. It&#39;s not as though she sold her soul to queen and country or anything.</p><p><strong>Columbus:</strong><br> Still...haha, I bet it&#39;d be a lot of fun to join her in drinking the night away.</p><p><strong>Columbus:</strong><br> There&#39;s no telling what might happen,<br> if you get my drift... Hehe, hehehe...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Columbus. Columbus! You&#39;re doing it again!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> U-um, could I ask you a question!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I&#39;m not at all surprised that you two would want to form a pirate club...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...but what sort of activities did you have in mind for it?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I mean, there&#39;s no way to get to the ocean from Chaldea without Rayshifting.</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong><br> We know. That&#39;s why we wanted to at least carve out a space here where pirates can feel like themselves.</p><p><strong>Anne:</strong><br> Maybe some kind of mock tavern, where pirates can swap tales of their voyages over mugs of beer?</p><p><strong>Anne:</strong><br> It wouldn&#39;t matter what the tales are about. They could be about foolish mistakes, daring exploits, reliving the good old days...</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong><br> And of course, if any members have any leads on new treasure, they could choose to share them\u2013or not\u2013and compete with each other to see who could find it first.</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong><br> That&#39;s the sort of piratey club we&#39;ve got in mind.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I, uh...I see...</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong><br> Anyway, thanks for coming, Christopher Columbus.<br> We&#39;re happy to have you.</p><p><strong>Anne:</strong><br> In a sense, we have you to thank for discovering the Caribbean and helping us get started with our own adventures.</p><p><strong>Anne:</strong><br> You&#39;re like our granddaddy&#39;s granddaddy when it comes to the seven seas. We&#39;d love to hear all about your voyages.</p><p><strong>Columbus:</strong><br> Well, uh...</p><p><strong>Columbus:</strong><br> This is hard for me to say, but I didn&#39;t come here to accept. I&#39;m sorry, but I can&#39;t join your club.</p><p><strong>Columbus:</strong><br> I had Master and Mash come along to mediate all of this.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> So he says, anyway.</p><hr><p><strong>Mary:</strong><br> What!? Aw, come on!</p><p><strong>Columbus:</strong><br> Besides, what do you even need me for? I&#39;m not the only sailor here. What about, say, Blackbeard?</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong><br> Are you nuts!? We blacklisted that perv from day one! He&#39;s never, ever getting into this club!</p><p><strong>Anne:</strong><br> In fact, that might actually be one of the reasons why we want you to join.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> What do you mean?</p><p><strong>Anne:</strong><br> Well, we&#39;re thinking Blackbeard may put his own club together.</p><p><strong>Anne:</strong><br> He might be a super-perv, but I guess he&#39;s first a first-class pirate. He really is an ultra-perv though.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> (I guess once wasn&#39;t enough.)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> From super, to ultra...!</p><hr><p><strong>Mary:</strong><br> Besides, Chaldea could easily end up summoning other pirates in the future, right?</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong><br> If one of them was that coward, Calico Jack Rackham, or Captain Kidd, or that hottie Bartholomew...</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong><br> ...they might end up siding with Blackbeard,<br> much as saying so kills me.</p><p><strong>Anne:</strong><br> Yeah! So we need to grab as many capable sailors for our club while we can.</p><p><strong>Anne:</strong><br> Having Captain Drake and Christopher Columbus in our club would absolutely give us the edge in both skill and popularity!</p><p><strong>Anne:</strong><br> In other words, having you two here means the seas of Chaldea would be ours!</p><p><strong>Columbus:</strong><br> Well, hang on now. For one thing, you&#39;ve got the wrong idea about something real fundamental.</p><p><strong>Anne &amp; Mary:</strong><br> Huh?</p><p><strong>Columbus:</strong><br> Are you sure you&#39;d call me a pirate?<br> &#39;Cause I really wouldn&#39;t.</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong><br> Wh-what do you mean!?</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong><br> You find unexplored islands and plunder them for all their worth! Of course you&#39;re a pirate!</p><p><strong>Anne:</strong><br> Besides, didn&#39;t you used to sail on a corsair when you were young? Pretty piratey, I&#39;d say.</p><p><strong>Columbus:</strong><br> Hmm, hm hm. I&#39;ll give you the bit about the corsair, yeah.</p><p><strong>Columbus:</strong><br> But that&#39;s exactly why I&#39;ve got no choice but to spell this out for you now.</p><p><strong>Columbus:</strong><br> Unlicensed piracy is, by definition, a criminal act.</p><p><strong>Anne &amp; Mary:</strong><br> ...Huh?</p><p><strong>Columbus:</strong><br> That&#39;s why I&#39;ve gotta turn you down.</p><p><strong>Columbus:</strong><br> I don&#39;t wanna give people the wrong idea by joining a pirate club when I was never a pirate.</p><p><strong>Columbus:</strong><br> Plus, I don&#39;t want to be arrested when I didn&#39;t do anything wrong.</p><p><strong>Columbus:</strong><br> Happened to me before, you know. I wasn&#39;t engaging in piracy or anything, but they still tossed me in jail.</p><p><strong>Columbus:</strong><br> Even now, I can&#39;t help but cry when I think back to how they clapped me in irons...</p><p><strong>Columbus:</strong><br> I was just trying everything I could to keep the colonies under control, you know?</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong><br> Th-that&#39;s what you&#39;re afraid of? Chains!? No pirate worth her salt would even bat an eye at that!</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong><br> Now what do we do, Anne? I thought Columbus was the granddaddy of all pirates, but it turns out he&#39;s a total yellowbelly!</p><p><strong>Anne:</strong><br> I get the sense he&#39;s taking some liberties with his story here, but never mind that!</p><p><strong>Anne:</strong><br> I think in this case...the right thing to do here is to give him a proper flogging, true pirate style.</p><p><strong>Anne:</strong><br> I think they call it shock therapy these days? That way, we&#39;ll have the Columbus we&#39;ve been looking for.</p><p><strong>Anne:</strong><br> Maybe then, he&#39;ll snap out of it and be the pirate granddaddy he&#39;s meant to be!</p><p><strong>Columbus:</strong><br> Oh, so you&#39;re not gonna let me turn this down politely, huh... Sheesh.</p><p><strong>Columbus:</strong><br> Sorry for the trouble, Master, but this is where you come in. Thanks for helping out with the mediation!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Anne &amp; Mary:</strong><br> Guh...</p><p><strong>Columbus:</strong><br> Sorry about that, ladies. Hope you are able to find someone a little better for your club.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Are you sure about this, Columbus?</p><p><strong>Columbus:</strong><br> What else could I do?<br> Like I keep saying, I&#39;m not a pirate.</p><p><strong>Columbus:</strong><br> Anyway, that&#39;s one invite turned down.<br> Thanks again, Master.</p><p><strong>Columbus:</strong><br> All right, let&#39;s go see the next club. Unfortunately,<br> I doubt this one&#39;ll be smooth sailing, either...</p><p><strong>--ARROW--:</strong></p><p><strong>D\uFF1A ???:</strong><br> You do like money...don&#39;t you?</p><p><strong>Columbus:</strong><br> Hell yes I do!</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> Hahaha! Then I trust it goes without saying that you like being rich as well?</p><p><strong>Columbus:</strong><br> And how!</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A ???:</strong><br> Good, good.<br> I knew we were right to send you an invite.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A ???:</strong><br> In that case, welcome to the Chaldea Merchants Association\u266A</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> The economics club, if you will.</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> This is where Chaldea&#39;s big earners come together to pool their resources.</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> To control the flow of information is to control the economy itself. Now come, tip your wine glass, and let us exchange trade secrets.</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> Here at Chaldea, small talk and business talk are lumped together into the same concept, losing their respective essence.</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> What we choose to take, and choose to leave behind,<br> is where our unique skillsets shine.</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> We were, of course, certain that you would not be troubled by the gears of Chaldea&#39;s economy beginning to truly pick up speed...</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> In fact, it is because we believe you are trustworthy enough to help us turn them yourself that you were invited to join us.</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> That should be a source of great pride for you!</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A ???:</strong><br> Oh! But no kings whose names start with \u201CD\u201D can join!</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A ???:</strong><br> I can&#39;t imagine ever forming a positive,<br> mutually beneficial relationship with him!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Something about this whole room seems...shady.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I agree, Senpai.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> As someone still learning the ways of society, the barriers to entry in this room feel much too high for me to overcome...</p><p><strong>Columbus:</strong><br> Haha, true, this world might be kind of rough for you, girlie. Best keep those purse strings drawn tight.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> It&#39;s so...grown-up in here...!</p><p><strong>Columbus:</strong><br> True, you and Mash might be a little young for this place. Make sure you keep those purse strings drawn tight.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...All right, I understand what it is you&#39;re doing here.<br> But I at least have to ask about this!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Where did this party room come from? I&#39;m quite sure we don&#39;t have anything like this in Chaldea.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A ???:</strong><br> Oh, that&#39;s just an illusion I cast, of course. If you&#39;re going to talk money, you should do so in an appropriately-themed setting, right?</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A ???:</strong><br> In fact, I make new luxurious rooms every day just to keep things fresh!</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A ???:</strong><br> Sometimes I go with ones like this... And sometimes, I go with ones like this!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Well, they definitely seem to fit the theme.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Columbus, you&#39;re sure about this?</p><hr><p><strong>Columbus:</strong><br> Yeah, I am. Sorry about this, Queenie and Big Roman Guy. I appreciate the invitation, but I have to refuse.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A ???:</strong><br> What? But...whyyy...?</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A ???:</strong><br> We&#39;re trying to be a real, respectable, legitimate merchant society, with no backstabbing or cheating whatsoever.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A ???:</strong><br> In time, we&#39;re planning to make this a safe and secure place where merchants of all stripes can make a buck or ten without any money laundering, you know...?</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> And above all, does the prospect of secret meetings with this beautiful woman not get your blood pumping?</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> You can tell how serious I am about this endeavor by the lengths I&#39;m willing to go to keep it secret from my beloved Cleopatra!</p><p><strong>Columbus:</strong><br> Don&#39;t get me wrong.<br> I can tell this place has a lot going for it.</p><p><strong>Columbus:</strong><br> But the thing is...even though I used to sail on a trade ship, and I&#39;ve made plenty of deals in my day...</p><p><strong>Columbus:</strong><br> ...I don&#39;t think I&#39;m a merchant, either.</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> Hm? Hahaha, is that all you&#39;re concerned about?<br> Come now, no need to worry about titles here.</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> I&#39;m an autocrat myself, not a merchant, though I do have a talent for the latter. That holds just as true for Her Majesty here as well.</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> This association is about a way of life! It&#39;s all about the thrill of financial endeavors pursued by the finer members of society.</p><p><strong>Columbus:</strong><br> Exactly. It&#39;s about a way of life.</p><p><strong>Columbus:</strong><br> I&#39;ve known plenty of merchants in my time, too. Bigshots who wield their guild&#39;s authority like a club, modest peddlers just trying to make a living, con artists who never met a mark they didn&#39;t like, patsies with the best of intentions and not a lick of common sense...</p><p><strong>Columbus:</strong><br> So, believe me, I know what merchants value better than just about anyone.</p><p><strong>Columbus:</strong><br> They want to minimize risk, and maximize reward.<br> That&#39;s the case for you lot as well, right?</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A ???:</strong><br> Well... Basically, yes.</p><p><strong>Columbus:</strong><br> Heh. Well that&#39;s not me.</p><p><strong>Columbus:</strong><br> Maximizing the reward is all that matters to me. Think I&#39;d have made the journey out west if I&#39;d spent a bunch of time weighing the risks?</p><p><strong>Columbus:</strong><br> The only thing I was thinking about was the riches awaiting me if I could get there.</p><p><strong>Columbus:</strong><br> It didn&#39;t matter how long it was gonna take or what I&#39;d have to sacrifice along the way. I knew the reward would be enough to make up for all of that. Or rather, I believed it would.</p><p><strong>Columbus:</strong><br> I really never bothered to weigh the expense of the voyage against the gold I&#39;d gain.</p><p><strong>Columbus:</strong><br> A merchant would never have set one foot on board a ship before drawing up an estimate. I never made one.</p><p><strong>Columbus:</strong><br> That&#39;s why I have to refuse your offer.</p><p><strong>Columbus:</strong><br> The whole idea of stopping your journey to take stock of the risks just doesn&#39;t sit right with me.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A ???:</strong><br> I see... All right, I understand. It does sound like you don&#39;t really live the life of a merchant.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A ???:</strong><br> If anything, it&#39;s the opposite.<br> You&#39;re a gambler.</p><p><strong>Columbus:</strong><br> Oh?</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A ???:</strong><br> It&#39;s not that you won&#39;t calibrate your expectations, it&#39;s that you can&#39;t. You&#39;re a hedonistic gambling addict who&#39;s only got his eyes on the prize and ignores the risks entirely!</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> Indeed! That won&#39;t do. That won&#39;t do at all. One should never participate in a game you aren&#39;t certain you can win, whether by skill or other means.</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> When the die is cast, whether literally or figuratively, one should always take steps to ensure that it lands the way they want.</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> Of course, those measures can change depending on the scenario. Fair prices, an eloquent speech, a small army at your beck and call...</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A ???:</strong><br> I agree. This won&#39;t do at all.<br> There are few things I despise more than gamblers.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A ???:</strong><br> It&#39;s incredibly dangerous to have an actor in the marketplace who isn&#39;t concerned about what he might have to lose.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A ???:</strong><br> His mere presence could disrupt my finely tuned calculations! And from there, it&#39;s only a hop, skip, and a jump to h-heavy losses! Oh God!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Couldn&#39;t you just not put him in your calculations?</p><hr><p><strong>D\uFF1A ???:</strong><br> I wish I could...but I can&#39;t just ignore him...</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A ???:</strong><br> You understand, right, Master?</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A ???:</strong><br> Why do you think I didn&#39;t think twice about sending him an invite? Can&#39;t you smell the scent of money practically radiating from him?</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A ???:</strong></p><p>For better or worse, I can&#39;t help but think that where he goes, money follows.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> (Yeah, I can see that.)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> (Maybe that&#39;s his EX Luck at work.)</p><hr><p><strong>D\uFF1A ???:</strong><br> If we let him run around doing whatever he wants, the consequences for Chaldea&#39;s economy could be disastrous.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A ???:</strong><br> And that means we can&#39;t just ignore him.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A ???:</strong><br> I don&#39;t want a gambler ruining my business opportunities... And I really don&#39;t want one putting me in the red...</p><p><strong>Columbus:</strong><br> Then what&#39;re you gonna do about it?<br> Me, I&#39;m just gonna do whatever I want.</p><p><strong>Columbus:</strong><br> ...If that ends up with you losing money, well,<br> to be honest, I don&#39;t really give a shit.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A ???:</strong><br> True. There&#39;s only one thing I can do about this:</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A ???:</strong><br> Put you under Merchants Association supervision, whether you like it or not...and teach you what it means to have a pure, righteous, beautiful merchant&#39;s soul!</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A ???:</strong><br> So to start, I&#39;ll beat you over the head with bags of gold until you&#39;ve learned to polish them to a high shine so they make that beautiful jingling sound!</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> Heh. Just a moment, Queen Moneybags. As a gentleman, I cannot permit this burden to rest on your shoulders alone!</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> Please, allow me to offer you my assistance as the figurative king of cutting one&#39;s losses.</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> Of course, if you like, I would also be happy to serve as his instructor myself.</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> I could teach him all my proven methods for making money, from the Roman art of haggling to the Roman see-food diet.</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> ...Naturally, I will prove their efficacy by charging a more than fair price for my services! What better way to learn than by experience!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I can&#39;t say I&#39;m at all surprised things turned out this way...</p><p><strong>Columbus:</strong><br> Haha, you lot sure are pushy when it comes to invites. Guess I&#39;ll have to be a little pushy in return about turning them down!</p><p><strong>Columbus:</strong><br> All right Master! Second verse, just like the first!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> Well, drat. Perhaps I let the prospect of spending time in secret with the beautiful queen get the better of me.</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> I spent so much time on my alibi to allay Cleopatra&#39;s suspicions that I neglected to rig the actual invitation.</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> It seems I cast my die prematurely after all...</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A ???:</strong><br> Ngh...</p><p><strong>Columbus:</strong><br> Oh, right, I almost forgot. I wasn&#39;t completely truthful earlier, so let me set the record straight.</p><p><strong>Columbus:</strong><br> Sure, I made my way west &#39;cause I thought it&#39;d make me rich, but that wasn&#39;t the only reason.</p><p><strong>Columbus:</strong><br> ...And I gotta admit,<br> it feels a little weird telling you this...</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A ???:</strong><br> (Sigh). All right...what was the other reason?</p><p><strong>Columbus:</strong><br> Well, simply put...I felt like God was telling me to go.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A ???:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A ???:</strong><br> Well...that certainly doesn&#39;t sound very merchant-like...</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A ???:</strong><br> But then again, maybe in one sense,<br> it very much is...</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A ???:</strong><br> Hmm. I honestly can&#39;t tell which...</p><p><strong>Columbus:</strong><br> All right, only one more to go.</p><p><strong>Columbus:</strong><br> Truth be told, this last club&#39;s the only one where I&#39;ve got no idea why they invited me.</p><p><strong>Columbus:</strong><br> I&#39;ll do my best to convince them peacefully...but if that falls through, I&#39;ll be counting on you to help bail me out again, Master.</p><p><strong>Columbus:</strong><br> But don&#39;t worry. For this next club in particular, I&#39;m pretty sure words will be just fine, and things shouldn&#39;t likely turn violent.</p><p><strong>Columbus:</strong><br> Hell, these next Servants have so little connection to me that I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if you ended up turning them down for me.</p><p><strong>Columbus:</strong><br> ...Honestly, I wonder if this invite wasn&#39;t just some kind of mistake.</p><p><strong>--ARROW--:</strong></p><p><strong>D\uFF1A ???:</strong><br> Welcome...to the Chaldean League of Villains.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Yeeeah, I don&#39;t think I&#39;m gonna be turning them down for you.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> This seems like a mistake to you, huh?</p><hr><p><strong>Columbus:</strong><br> Hey, come on, Master, work with me here.</p><p><strong>Columbus:</strong><br> I&#39;m nothing like these guys...right?</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A ???:</strong><br> So that is your initial reaction, is it? I certainly accounted for that in my calculations, but I must say it is still somehow surprising.</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong><br> Heeheeheehee! You wound me, you wound me! All we wanted was a new playmate we were sure to get along with!</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> Dammit! As if I&#39;d ever join any pirate club who&#39;d have the old hag as a member!</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> Still, I has a sad since I won&#39;t get to see the holy zone extending from Mary&#39;s pert upper arm to down below her armpit on a daily basis!</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> Anyway, I decided to hang out here until Bartholomew and the others show up.</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> Gotta make sure he doesn&#39;t soak in that lukewarm bath for so long that he forgets how to commit a proper crime, after all.</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> The only downside is that my tastes are just not compatible with these plebs here!</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> How can you all be so disinterested in my secret collection!? It&#39;s the stuff every man dreams about!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I-I don&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking about, but nobody should be committing any kind of crime!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> We&#39;d better squash this club now, before it gets out of hand.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> No good can come to Chaldea by letting this club exist...</p><hr><p><strong>D\uFF1A ???:</strong><br> Now, now, just a moment. I believe there&#39;s been some sort of misunderstanding.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A ???:</strong><br> We haven&#39;t actually formed a secret society sworn to foment chaos and anarchy.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A ???:</strong><br> We are merely exercising a bit of...fantasy.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Fantasy...huh...</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A ???:</strong><br> Everyone has a dream they bask in from time to time, do they not? Things they know to be improbable or infeasible, yet cannot help but yearn for nonetheless.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A ???:</strong><br> We come here to share those dreams, to imagine what it would take to make them come true as a sort of mental exercise, nothing more.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A ???:</strong><br> It&#39;s a surprisingly effective form of stress relief. Even we villains need a safe space where we can relax and be ourselves, after all.</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> The good guy types are always suspicious of us,<br> even if we haven&#39;t done anything wrong!</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> Really makes it hard to girl watch in the cafeteria. I can&#39;t even remember the last time I grabbed a cup of tea there.</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> The best I&#39;ve managed is to rig the soda machine to serve only the Blackbeard Special (coffee mixed with orange juice)...</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong><br> Personally, I&#39;m so used to people pretending not to see me that it&#39;s a bit of a thrill when they do.</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong><br> Heehee, heeheehee! Go on, look at me! No, on second thought, please don&#39;t! No, wait, on third thought, please do!</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong><br> What&#39;s that? You want to look at me even more?<br> You can&#39;t take your eyes off me for a moment?</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong><br> In that case, why don&#39;t I hold on to your eyes for you? That way, they&#39;ll never come off me!</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A ???:</strong><br> Mephy there may be too Chaotic Evil for me to account for him in my calculations, but he&#39;s welcome here nonetheless. Diversity is crucial to the health of any organization, after all.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A ???:</strong><br> I&#39;ve sent out an invite to Henry\u2013er, Edward as well, but I&#39;m afraid he has yet to respond.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A ???:</strong><br> He may have just thrown it away, or some busybody may have torn it up before he even saw it. I tell you, it&#39;s too much for this aging man&#39;s heart!</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A ???:</strong><br> At any rate, that is the sort of broad-minded play land we are attempting to build here. Join us, and let us all enjoy ourselves together.</p><p><strong>Columbus:</strong><br> All right, I get what it is you&#39;re all doing here.<br> But I still can&#39;t join your club.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A ???:</strong><br> And why is that, if you don&#39;t mind my asking?</p><p><strong>Columbus:</strong><br> Do you even have to ask?</p><p><strong>Columbus:</strong><br> Because, honestly, as of right now,<br> I don&#39;t think of the person I am today as a villain.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A ???:</strong><br> Oho... What a fascinating assertion.</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong><br> Ohohohoho! Talk about dropping a bombshell!</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> Srsly? You&#39;re really serial right now?</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> I only ever sailed the Caribbean, but even I heard some pretty bad stories about the things you&#39;ve done.</p><p><strong>Columbus:</strong><br> I know what you&#39;re getting at. You&#39;re talking about what happened after my big voyage, right? But everything I did was completely normal.</p><p><strong>Columbus:</strong><br> And I do mean everything.</p><p><strong>Columbus:</strong><br> If I thought it was okay to do something, I did it.<br> If I thought it was wrong, then I didn&#39;t.</p><p><strong>Columbus:</strong><br> I made my men do what I thought was okay,<br> and punished them if they did something bad.</p><p><strong>Columbus:</strong><br> That&#39;s all there was to it. I never bothered thinking about whether our actions were good or evil.</p><p><strong>Columbus:</strong><br> No, that&#39;s not quite right. I didn&#39;t bother bringing along anything to measure what&#39;s good and what&#39;s evil.</p><p><strong>Columbus:</strong><br> Getting ready for the voyage out west was hard enough without packing things we didn&#39;t need.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Wait, Mash.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I think he might still have more to say.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Senpai...?</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A ???:</strong><br> I see, I see. Something to measure good and evil, eh?</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A ???:</strong><br> Yes, I can certainly understand that.<br> So that&#39;s why you don&#39;t think of yourself as evil.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A ???:</strong><br> However, I feel your explanation is lacking in one particular respect.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A ???:</strong><br> And whether this is an intentional or accidental omission is of particular relevance.</p><p><strong>Columbus:</strong><br> Hm? What&#39;re you talking about?</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A ???:</strong><br> Very well then, I&#39;ll get straight to the point. Unlike a certain \u201Cgreat\u201D detective I could name, I have no interest in beating around the bush.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A ???:</strong><br> You were very clear that as of this moment, you do not think of the person you are now as a villain.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A ???:</strong><br> So then, the obvious question is: As of right now,<br> how do you see the man you were in the past?</p><p><strong>Columbus:</strong><br> ...Hard to say. I don&#39;t have any weird way to measure that, either.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A ???:</strong><br> Now, now, be honest. If you need some way to measure your own goodness or evil...you have one right there, don&#39;t you?</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong><br> Why yes, he does!<br> A young, fresh, perfectly ordinary meatsack!</p><p><strong>Columbus:</strong><br> What&#39;s that? I&#39;m afraid I don&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking about.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A ???:</strong><br> Hehehe, you clearly have no trouble lying through your teeth. Not really a trait one typically finds among those inclined toward good.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A ???:</strong><br> It would be a shame to let you go.<br> Are you sure you won&#39;t reconsider joining us?</p><p><strong>Columbus:</strong><br> Sorry, but my answer&#39;s still no. If you don&#39;t like it, go ahead and try to change my mind for me.</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong><br> Heeheeheehee! Ooh, I do so love dragging one who thinks himself good down the path of evil!</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong><br> And would you look at that? I just so happen to have some truth serum (read: bombs) to make him confess how evil he really is right here!</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> I haven&#39;t been following most of the time, but really, the gist is that you&#39;re like me, aren&#39;t you? You&#39;ll kill anyone who looks at you funny and be done with it?</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> I could always use a new crew member.<br> Especially a skilled sailor with similar tastes!</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> After all, you never know when someone&#39;s gonna challenge you to a duel you can&#39;t talk your way out of, smh. I plan on being the last one standing!</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> So get over here and show us what you&#39;re really made of already! Got regrets about how you lived your life? Save them for your deathbed!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> Tch. Oldschool, but that was still some damn good steering! You&#39;re a way better pirate than most pirates I know, old-timer!</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong><br> Hmm. Does this mean that the evil defeated by evil was the true evil all along?</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong><br> Heeheeheehee, it seems I&#39;ve unexpectedly become something of a fiery mood maker!</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong><br> I do hope you&#39;ll call on me again!</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A ???:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A ???:</strong><br> The key difference between you and me, Columbus, is that I was made to be evil, where you were labeled evil by others.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A ???:</strong><br> But in both our cases, the question is:<br> Who decided we were evil?</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A ???:</strong><br> For you, I imagine that&#39;s the means of measuring you spoke of.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A ???:</strong><br> I was hoping to determine whether you still follow your original time period&#39;s sense of morality...</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A ???:</strong><br> ...or whether you&#39;ve come to adopt more modern ones...</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A ???:</strong><br> ...but I think that can wait for another time. And I&#39;m quite certain there will eventually be such a time.</p><p><strong>Columbus:</strong><br> ...Good god. University professors sure do like to yammer on, don&#39;t they.</p><p><strong>Columbus:</strong><br> Well, it might have gotten a little rough at times, but at least those invites are good and declined now. Appreciate all your help, Master.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I don&#39;t know...<br> I&#39;m not sure this will really be the end of it...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> If you really appreciate it, how about returning the favor?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I think I deserve some payment for my services.</p><hr><p><strong>Columbus:</strong><br> Payment, huh? Well listen to you. Fine, I guess I can&#39;t turn you down now. How much do you want?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I want you to finally come clean.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I want you answer the question he put to you.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Oh... You mean when he first asked me what I thought he was?</p><p><strong>Columbus:</strong><br> ...Well, since you&#39;ve stuck with me this far, I guess it wouldn&#39;t be fair to fudge it any longer.</p><p><strong>Columbus:</strong><br> All right, this&#39;ll be your payment then. Though I&#39;ve gotta say, it&#39;s a little embarrassing talking about myself like this.</p><p><strong>Columbus:</strong><br> If you want to know what I think I am,<br> well...I&#39;m afraid all I can say is this:</p><p><strong>Columbus:</strong><br> I&#39;m myself. I&#39;m the man most people know as Christopher Columbus.</p><p><strong>Columbus:</strong><br> Back when I was younger, I went by Cristoforo Colombo, and in Espa\xF1a, I&#39;m known as Crist\xF3bal Col\xF3n...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> No fair!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> That&#39;s not what I meant, and you know it!</p><hr><p><strong>Columbus:</strong><br> Haha, well, I had to try. But if you&#39;re not satisfied with that, I&#39;ll keep going.</p><p><strong>Columbus:</strong><br> Given my current position, it might be easier to think about why I was summoned as a Servant.</p><p><strong>Columbus:</strong><br> Was it because I&#39;m a sailor?<br> A merchant? A villain? Of course not.</p><p><strong>Columbus:</strong><br> Hell, I just turned down invites for all those clubs &#39;cause I didn&#39;t want to be pigeonholed into any of those particular categories.</p><p><strong>Columbus:</strong><br> So then, why was I summoned as a Servant?</p><p><strong>Columbus:</strong><br> I think it&#39;s because I made my dream come true.</p><p><strong>Columbus:</strong><br> I think it&#39;s because I proved to the whole world that, as long as you never give up, you can make your dream a reality, no matter what that dream may be.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Still...if we&#39;re talking about your Servant status, well, you are technically a Rider, right?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> So while you may not be a pirate, I still can&#39;t help but think the sailor part must be pretty relevant, since it involves riding a ship...</p><p><strong>Columbus:</strong><br> Hah, now we&#39;re taking things literally, are we?<br> Well, if you want to think about it in terms of riding...</p><p><strong>Columbus:</strong><br> ...you could say that I never disembarked from my dream.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...!</p><p><strong>Columbus:</strong><br> No matter what sort of hardships I encountered, or how many other people I stepped on, or how long it took...</p><p><strong>Columbus:</strong><br> ...I believed I&#39;d eventually arrive at my goal as long as I kept moving forward, and never stopped believing till the very end.</p><p><strong>Columbus:</strong><br> You know, thinking about it now...</p><p><strong>Columbus:</strong><br> ...I might just be the best example there is of a Servant that made their dreams come true.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...I see. That&#39;s certainly...one way to look at it.</p><p><strong>Columbus:</strong><br> Oh, and while we&#39;re on the subject, let me make one more thing clear about the role I have to play.</p><p><strong>Columbus:</strong><br> Like I just said, the only thing I&#39;ve got going for me is my ability to follow my dreams.</p><p><strong>Columbus:</strong><br> But you know, my dream from when I was still alive already came true. I don&#39;t need to discover the New World all over again.</p><p><strong>Columbus:</strong><br> So then, what dream should I pursue now that I&#39;m a Servant? What do I set my sights on and chase after with all I&#39;ve got?</p><p><strong>Columbus:</strong><br> Well, I think the answer to that question\u2013the thing that gives dream-chasing Servants something worth chasing\u2013is probably you, Master.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...!</p><hr><p><strong>Columbus:</strong><br> &#39;Course, I still have a mind and a will of my own.</p><p><strong>Columbus:</strong><br> I&#39;ll still go after any easy money there is to be made, go wherever I want, and do whatever I want.</p><p><strong>Columbus:</strong><br> But all that said...</p><p><strong>Columbus:</strong><br> If you point me towards something that can match discovering the New World...</p><p><strong>Columbus:</strong><br> ...and if I can think of it as my own dream...</p><p><strong>Columbus:</strong><br> ...then I&#39;ll do whatever it takes to get there.<br> Guaranteed.</p><p><strong>Columbus:</strong><br> So as long as you&#39;re on board my ship,<br> I&#39;ll make sure you get there too.</p><p><strong>Columbus:</strong><br> I don&#39;t care if it involves restoring humanity, achieving world peace, or even conquering the world.</p><p><strong>Columbus:</strong><br> The only thing I&#39;ve got going for me is my tenacity.<br> As for what I use it for, well...that&#39;s up to you.</p><p><strong>Columbus:</strong><br> It doesn&#39;t matter what anyone else thinks about the end result. Good, bad, it&#39;s all the same to me.</p><p><strong>Columbus:</strong><br> All I care about...is following my dream until it becomes reality.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...I&#39;ll remember that.</p><hr><p><strong>Columbus:</strong><br> Good. Anyway, thanks again for helping me out today. Give me a shout the next time you head to the treasury.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> You know...I think I understand Columbus just a little bit better now.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Even though he changed the world, he only did so because he was chasing his own dream.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That must be why he doesn&#39;t like having his actions, or his ethics, or the good and bad sides of his deeds, labeled one way or the other.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Because that would just be him going by someone else&#39;s metric.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The only things he&#39;s concerned with are his own dreams and desires, as determined by his own way of thinking.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> So...if we can come up with a good dream for him...one that lines up with our own goals...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...then I think he might just end up being a tremendously capable ally.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> On the other hand...if we show him the wrong sort of dream by mistake, he&#39;ll probably end up doing things that most would describe as evil.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> True. We&#39;d better be careful...</p><hr><p><strong>D\uFF1A ???:</strong><br> ...Welcome. What can I do for you this fine day?</p><p><strong>Columbus:</strong><br> Well, I&#39;ve been thinking about what you said the other day...</p><p><strong>Columbus:</strong><br> ...and I&#39;ve decided to join your club after all.<br> Here&#39;s my registration form.</p><p><strong>Columbus:</strong><br> I figured, if I&#39;m gonna join any club around here,<br> this one looks like the best fit.</p><p><strong>Columbus:</strong><br> Course, I already went and declined while Master was present, plus the other clubs I turned down.</p><p><strong>Columbus:</strong><br> So I&#39;d appreciate it if you kept my membership here just between us.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A ???:</strong><br> Heh, by all means. This is precisely the outcome I expected. But, as a matter of interest, and do be straight with me about this...</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A ???:</strong><br> ...You&#39;re doing the same thing with the Pirate Club and Merchants Association as well, aren&#39;t you?</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A ???:</strong><br> I trust you fed them the same line, and similarly asked them to keep your membership secret?</p><p><strong>Columbus:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Columbus:</strong><br> Hahaha! Was it that obvious!?</p><p><strong>Columbus:</strong><br> If only I&#39;d had a smart guy like you on my crew instead of Pinz\xF3n or Bartolome!</p><p><strong>Columbus:</strong><br> Still, I didn&#39;t technically lie to Master and Mash, you know?</p><p><strong>Columbus:</strong><br> I am me. It&#39;s not accurate to say I&#39;m just a pirate, or just a merchant, or just a villain.</p><p><strong>Columbus:</strong><br> But...if you&#39;re gonna say I&#39;m all of them, well,<br> that&#39;s fine with me. Accurate, that&#39;s for sure!</p><p><strong>Columbus:</strong><br> So...if you&#39;re that smart, Professor, do you also know why I went to all the trouble of getting Master involved and making a show of turning you all down?</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A ???:</strong><br> Of course. The answer couldn&#39;t be simpler: to gain all you could, personally, from your membership to each club as was possible.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A ???:</strong><br> After all, you only act to satisfy your own personal desires.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A ???:</strong><br> You brought Master along to spread the belief throughout Chaldea that you would not be joining any of the Servants&#39; clubs.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A ???:</strong><br> Then, when you went to a club and said you would make an exception just for them, you would be assured a special position. A shadow member, if you will.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A ???:</strong><br> In doing so, you will be able to gain insider knowledge while staying out of the spotlight.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A ???:</strong><br> Naturally, there are many merits to such an approach. For one, you can act with greater impunity, knowing you will be safe even if the club should go south.</p><p><strong>Columbus:</strong><br> So, now that you know all that...are you still willing to let me join?</p><p><strong>Columbus:</strong><br> &#39;Cause if you are, you should know that I&#39;m still planning to hide in the shadows and suck up all the juiciest bits for myself.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A ???:</strong><br> It&#39;s quite all right with me. If that&#39;s how you want to play, I can think of any number of ways to make use of you.</p><p><strong>Columbus:</strong><br> Haha! You&#39;ve got guts, telling a guy you&#39;re gonna make use of him right to his face.</p><p><strong>Columbus:</strong><br> ...I think you and I are going to get along just fine. Pleasure to join your club, criminal gentleman!</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A ???:</strong><br> The pleasure&#39;s all mine. After all, you achieved tremendous success and changed the world itself merely by following your own selfish dreams and desires.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A ???:</strong><br> As far as I&#39;m concerned, that is a world-class criminal accomplishment. I daresay I&#39;m rather envious...</p><p><strong>Both:</strong><br> Hehe... Hehehe... Mwahahahahahaha...</p>', 486);
