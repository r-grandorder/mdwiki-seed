Miss Jaguarmura!</h2><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Here you go, Senpai, Ishtar.<br> Emiya made some tea for us.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> ...(Sigh) What did I ever do to deserve being summoned to a place like this where I&#39;m forever condemned to choke down cheap tea?</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> If you&#39;re going to complain, then don&#39;t drink it.<br> I don&#39;t really have anything fit for a goddess.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Hmph. You there, gloomy Archer, you&#39;re not being respectful enough to a goddess like me.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> My apologies. I am a mere peasant, after all. Shouldn&#39;t you, in your great benevolence, be more lenient to the likes of me?</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Hmph. Is it just me,<br> or am I getting condescended to?</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Like a cold chill running down your spine,<br> I creep in! Yahoo! Is everyone feline good!?</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Young ones! Young&#39;ins! Are you all enjoying the purrime of your youth!? Good, good. I won&#39;t stop you!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Yep...the only thing I can say is:<br> (standing prim and tall) ...I wanna join!!!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Oh, that tea smeows really nice.<br> I want some.</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> What about snacks?<br> Like chocolate mouse...I mean, mousse?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Jaguar Warrior...</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> That cat&#39;s as rowdy as always... Is it too late to abandon her in the middle of a field in Uruk, Fujimaru?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> That&#39;s probably not an option...</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...? Senpai. Emiya seems to be acting strange...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Oh right. Has he not met Jaguar Warrior?</p><hr><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> ...(Utter bafflement)</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Mrrow!? That look on his face! Something he saw made him real sad! I&#39;m pawsitive of it!</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> No, no. Nothing like that. Toothache.<br> No reason to be concerned.</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Now he&#39;s shaking his head all exasperated!</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> By the way, Fujimaru. What is this creature?<br> I can&#39;t imagine a Heroic Spirit looking so absurd.</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Hey, don&#39;t call me \u201Cabsurd\u201D or a \u201Ccreature\u201D! That hurts my felines! Fur your information, I am a Divine Spirit! I&#39;m godly...a big shot!</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> (Dumbstruck)</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Look at that shocked look! Big sister never raised you to become such a catty person!</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> Uh...well, I don&#39;t remember being raised by a weird cat-creature...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Please calm yourselves... I will go and make more tea, so please have a seat, Jaguar Warrior.</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Oh, but not that. I forgot that I hate to drink hot things. Iced tea would be purrfection though.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Ugh... I&#39;m not even part of this conversation and she&#39;s irritating me! Mash, I give you my permission to beat the crap out of that thing.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I-I will do no such thing! A-and, no, I will not replace sugar with salt, either!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Here you go, Jaguar Warrior. Iced tea.</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Ah, thanks Mashy.<br> (Glug, glug, glug...)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> (Mashy...? That&#39;s new.)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> A-anyway. Everyone&#39;s having tea, so please make yourself at home, too, Jaguar Warrior.</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> (Gulpgulpgulp) Phew! Thanks for the tea!<br> It was good! I&#39;ll be taking my leave, meow!</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> ...Huh?</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> ...What?</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Hmmm... (Looking around)</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Well, maybe if I look harder, I think there&#39;s a couple more people with ties to me that I could find nearby and lug around...</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> (Oh my...what should I do?)</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> (I don&#39;t know why, but since I had time on my hands, I was thinking of asking that red archer to teach me how to cook Japanese food...)</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> (...But I have this strange feeling that I would get involved in something very...difficult if I go in that room right now.)</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> (It&#39;s just a hunch of mine. Yes, just a hunch.)</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> (Change of plans! Today, I&#39;ll go ask Boudica to teach me how to make Western home-cooked meals!)</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> (The Divine Spirit of the jaguar...simply chose THAT as a vessel on the basis that she&#39;s feral...)</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> (I don&#39;t know a thing.)</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> (She stares at me sometimes, but has she figured something out...? No, there&#39;s no way. It&#39;s probably just an instinctual thing.)</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> (It&#39;s just like how I feel something from that red Archer.)</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> (And if something sets off my instincts, it may be because there is some sort of connection between us...)</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> (But there&#39;s nothing I can do if I don&#39;t know...)</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> (But the one thing I can say for sure is that Chaldea&#39;s Summoning System is rubbish.)</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> (And it&#39;s not just because of her.<br> After all, it summoned me as a Servant, too.)</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> ...And if such a group started interacting without considering the consequences, it could lead to chaos.</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> (Sniff, sniff...) Huh.<br> I caught a scent, but he&#39;s nowhere to be found.</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> I guess I have no choice.<br> I guess I&#39;m stuck with these two.</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Oh. And obviously, I&#39;ll have Master and Mashy help me out, too.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I don&#39;t see a way out of this...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> No. I don&#39;t mind helping out,<br> but I wonder what we are going to do...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Sure!</p><hr><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> That&#39;s the spirit! Here&#39;s a Jaguar Stamp for you as a reward! Rumor has it that if you collect &#39;em all, something good will happen!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> ...Eh? Specifically what, you ask? Who knows! Hey, you over there! Don&#39;t say stuff like that! It&#39;s not shady!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> There&#39;s a saying that opurrtunity comes to those who believe! Why? &#39;Cause unlike tigers, this jaguar is a Divine Spirit! Something grrreat would happen!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> It&#39;s like...like...getting blessed with the power to never get pasta sauce splattered on your shirt...</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Or like the power to get TWO sodas from a vending machine...whoa, that&#39;s incredible!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Anyway. Have no fear and follow meow!<br> Let&#39;s go, go, go!</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> H-hey! Where are you taking us!?</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> (Sigh)... I can&#39;t say no now that I know Master is going.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> At least tell us your plan.</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Hm! Well, to give you the abridged version...</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> ...we&#39;re gonna visit a place that is connected...I think...to all of us. The land of beginnings...</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Fuyuki! And it&#39;s in a bind!</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> Hm. This is...</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Huh. It&#39;s like a graveyard.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> To bring a shining goddess of Venus to a gloomy place like this...you South American gods are barbaric.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> This place is just the worst. If you really wanted a goddess, I wish you&#39;d picked a different one.</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> But hey, it&#39;s really lively for such a gloomy place! Grim grinning ghosts come out to socialize!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Yup! Definitely a ghost town! And look at all these things milling about...they&#39;re like squatters!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes, I&#39;ve detected that, too!<br> Da Vinci, what are these!?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Hmmm. I can&#39;t say we really expected this...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> There&#39;s no Holy Grail here anymore, just like the other Singularities. The Incineration of Humanity is over...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> The world should have righted itself, and the distortion disappeared...but in this case, the Holy Grail might still be affecting the area.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> I&#39;m not exactly sure how and what it&#39;s affecting, though.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> This isn&#39;t something we can ignore, is it?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> No. We have no idea what other issues might spring up if we leave it alone. First things first, you&#39;ll need to get rid of those malevolent spirits.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Something&#39;s causing this.<br> You just have to find it and get rid of it.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I found it!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> It looks like it&#39;s going to attack!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Please, Emiya, Ishtar!</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> What!? You want ME to work!?<br> Can&#39;t you guys just handle it yourselves?</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> I&#39;d love to do this without you, but it seems your opponent isn&#39;t going to just let you go.</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> The heart of the great jaguar, who loves justice and sacrifices, led me here! Fleeing from the enemy means death OR sacrifice!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Besides, I have this feeling that you two are under my guardianship, so you gotta do what this jaguar says!</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> Guardianship? Are you sure it&#39;s not more like a pet sort of thing?</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Wait a minute, shouldn&#39;t it be the opposite?</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> We may both be Divided Spirits, but I am a genuine goddess. You&#39;re a nagual of Tezcatlipoca. There&#39;s no contest\u2013</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Shut up! No backtalk! This teacher does not tolerate misbehavior from her students!</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Teach...er!? What!?</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Anyway, these things are buzzing around like gnats and it&#39;s pissing me off! I&#39;m gonna swat them all!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Ah! No matter how much complaining she does, she&#39;s still going to help me! I KNEW I was adored!</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> (Oh crap. She&#39;s got the serious eyes!)</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Maybe this way? Hmmm, yep, it&#39;s this way.<br> C&#39;mon guys! Let&#39;s explore!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> This place...is in shambles. From what I can tell,<br> it looks like it was a school.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Huh. A school.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> ...Does that mean something to you?</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Nope. Nothing. Nothing at all.<br> What about you?</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> Same here.<br> I don&#39;t feel anything for this place.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> ...I see. By the way, I feel like you&#39;ve been a lot less deferential to me since we got here.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> It&#39;s better that way. After all, we&#39;re both Servants who got summoned by the same Master.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> A Heroic Spirit who can&#39;t work with others because they&#39;re obsessed with their position in some hierarchy isn&#39;t worth the energy it took to summon them.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> That...and I suppose I do feel a bit more at ease since we&#39;re in Japan. I&#39;m more comfortable here than places like England or France.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Hmph. Aaand we&#39;re way out of my comfort zone here...</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> But I&#39;M purrfectly fine! It&#39;s like this land is empawering me!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> If I had a nickname here, it&#39;d be the Jaguar of Fuyuki... Hm, that doesn&#39;t sound quite right.</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Whatever! I don&#39;t care!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Now! Follow me!<br> Follow the jaguar you&#39;ve put all your trust in!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> This feels SO right! Whoo!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Look like she knows where she&#39;s going, and she&#39;s taking the reins this time around. So, is your destination somewhere beyond the ruins of the school?</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Let me answer your question with my own question...because that&#39;s the jaguar way. Do you all know what this jaguar hates?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I...do not, no.</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Hey! That&#39;s no good! You need to show more interest in me! Specifically, you need to pet me more in My Room!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> And so you know, the answer is: lions.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> A...lion...?</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Gracias! It&#39;s like you can see right through me!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> (Uh, I think she&#39;s mentioned it a few times herself...)</p><hr><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Even though we&#39;re both part of the cat family,<br> I feel like we don&#39;t mesh, soul-wise.</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> I&#39;ve got this pawful feeling that if we sit at the same table, all my food would get eaten up!</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> ...So what about it?</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Hm. Keeping that fact in mind, we&#39;ll just come around the corner of this pile of debris and...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> A lion-faced...Chimera!?</p><hr><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> I knew it was here. I&#39;m getting pumped up!<br> This jaguar&#39;s nose never lies!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Behold! The mortal enemy of the jaguar...my main competitor of the dinner table!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> This response...it&#39;s a giant ghost!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> That is DEFINITELY the cause of this CATastrophe! It&#39;s tall, it&#39;s behind the school ruins...it must be a social studies teacher! That&#39;s a jaguar hunch!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Yikes, you&#39;re starting out with a boss enemy!?<br> Sometimes good instincts get you into trouble!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> B-but...now that we&#39;ve encountered it, we must do something about it!</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> (Sigh) Honestly, something about this Singularity just pisses me off...</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> And of all the things here,<br> that one really just makes my skin crawl.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> It&#39;s just a remnant, but it&#39;s tearing this city up with a vengeance. Just looking at it makes me sick.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> Hm. I forgot that you&#39;re a goddess of love and battle.<br> Are you saying that you would do a better job?</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> Might be a bit late to say, but I really wouldn&#39;t have thought fighting and love could coexist in one person. Your perspective must be...interesting.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> What? You got a problem with that!?<br> I&#39;ll blow you away in one shot!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Hold it right there, you two!<br> Did you just say something naughty?</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> I won&#39;t allow illicit sexual relationships! Why? Because they makes me sad! But if you insist, you&#39;ll need to go through me first!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> After all, you can&#39;t skip the somber,<br> \u201CThey grow up so fast...\u201D</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I-I&#39;m sorry, but please concentrate on the battle!<br> Master&#39;s safety is our priority!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Obviously, I haven&#39;t furgotten my mission!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Let&#39;s do this, Emiyan and flashy-looking goddess! This will be our first collaborative work, and we&#39;re sure to emerge victorious!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Enemy responses are gone.<br> Whew...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> (...She was so loud and rowdy even during battle.)</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Justice purrvails!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> And peace has been restored to Fuyuki... The end.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Peace, you say?<br> The city&#39;s still in ruins.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> And there&#39;s not a single living soul around.</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> But still...we still protected it.<br> We protected Fuyuki!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> And isn&#39;t that something to be purroud of?</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> It may be broken now, but if it gets back going propurrly, that&#39;s a win for us, right?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> You&#39;re right. There are still a lot of unanswered questions about what happened here...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...but I&#39;m still convinced that there was meaning to this.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Yeah, good work, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Well, we let a primal beast lead our expedition,<br> but it seems all&#39;s well that ends well.</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Now, time to head back home to finish our tea party! You&#39;ll need to purrpare tea and snacks!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> (It appears...that she has forgotten the fact that she doesn&#39;t like hot drinks...)</p><p><strong>--ARROW--:</strong></p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Heh heh heh.<br> Did you think my epic quest would end in Fuyuki!?</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Fwahaha. It&#39;s fur from over!!<br> So...here you go!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Now begins the super-secret post-interlude story!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Such freedom...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Multiple...</p><hr><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Okay, thanks for that lackluster response!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> The city of night, steeped in desires...it&#39;s like a mini-map of someone&#39;s life with no possible escape!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> And it was here that we received intel that there are children who wander around at night...</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> To pursue the truth, we head to the Amazon\u2013I mean, to the city at night.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> Explain to me why I&#39;m here again?</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Well, because you&#39;re Unit 1.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> Unit...1?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Oh, is Ishtar not coming with us this time?</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Hm. Obviously I looked for her before we left, but no matter how much I sniffed around, I couldn&#39;t find her!</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> (Sigh) She bailed.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> By the way, Jaguar Warrior, I&#39;m slightly confused... What, exactly, is the point of this Rayshift?</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Tsk, tsk, tsk.<br> Right now, I&#39;m NOT Jaguar Warrior!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> ...?</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Like a sumo wrestler who hits hard and throws oneself at the kids...! ...Hey! Who&#39;s the rude dude calling me a sumo wrestler!? I&#39;ll have you know that I&#39;m seen far and wide as a svelte lady!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Anyway...I&#39;m the wonderful adult who looks out for children&#39;s futures by tackling their most difficult problems...literally!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Now, give me the reaction that says, \u201CWow, there&#39;s still hope for the world with adults like her in it! Now gimme an autograph!\u201D That&#39;s the jaguar way! Meow!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Uh...yeeeah...</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Hey, what kinda lifeless response is that!?<br> C&#39;mon, gimme some GUSTO!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> She&#39;s so passionate...!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Heh. Now look upon me with your most adoring gaze!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> I should also mention that this is all unpaid volunteer work! That&#39;d be craaazy.</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> And if word of this gets posted anonymously on bulletin boards or social meowdia, my popularity will skyrocket... So don&#39;t post it! Don&#39;t you dare!</p><hr><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> I&#39;m as confused as ever as to what she&#39;s on about, but maybe she got a taste for battle after Fuyuki the other day...</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> By the by, your backstory is that you&#39;re the first delinquent I rehabilitated!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Formerly a playboy that bleaches his hair...but my toe bean stick of justice went WHAM! POWWIE! Reformed! I&#39;m in your debt...! Something like that!</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I don&#39;t know why...but I want to say...good work...</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Okay! Time for today&#39;s patrol! And let&#39;s do it with some enthusiasm! ...Hm! I hear the scream of a delinquent who&#39;s lost his way! Let&#39;s go!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> I found him!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That&#39;s...C\xFA Chulainn.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> ...Ah? Hey, it&#39;s you, Master.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> What&#39;s going on? Why&#39;s everyone here?<br> I was just taking a stroll.</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Rrrgh! Dress code violation! Pierced ears are absolutely a violation of the school dress code!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> That condescending attitude!<br> Those shifty eyes...!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> And the nail in the coffin: wearing a full-body leotard is definitely a sign of rebellion! He is pawsitively a shameless delinquent!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Ah...but I understand. It&#39;s not all your fault. The adults who never disciplined you are partly responsible fur your behavior. Oh, and Sc\xE1thach.</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> What you gotta do is body slam the kids! Or at least not teach them an instant death move that NEVER WORKS!</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> ...Hey, Archer?<br> What the actual hell is this nonsense?</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> If you figure out an answer to that,<br> be sure and let me know.</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Y-you&#39;ve got to be kitten me!<br> I&#39;m the prim and propurr warrior of the jaguar!</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Jaguar, huh? Well, I&#39;m C\xFA Chulainn,<br> the renowed hound of my lands!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Oh yeah, that too. That nickname of yours...it sounds like \u201Cthe rabid dog of the west,\u201D and that can only mean one thing: DELINQUENT!</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> ...What?</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> I have no idea what the hell&#39;s going on,<br> but I&#39;m assuming you&#39;re trying to pick a fight.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Jaguar Warrior...<br> Um, I suggest that you try not to provoke him...</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> It&#39;s all right.<br> They always act rebellious in the beginning.</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> BUT! Accepting these delinquents for who they are and not running away is the true way a jaguar shows her beautiful stripes!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> In other words...the time for talk&#39;s over!<br> Let&#39;s go, punk! Come at me!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> I knew he was a purehearted young man deep down. It&#39;s the adults of this world who warped the boy! ANYWAY, this jaguar&#39;s purposeful night stalking continues!</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Dammit...I knew I should&#39;ve gone straight home.<br> You guys are crazy to tag along with THAT thing.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> Unlike you, I wasn&#39;t given the choice...<br> \u201CReformed Delinquent Unit 2.\u201D</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Now that I think about it,<br> I don&#39;t know why Senpai is here either.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> No. I probably shouldn&#39;t think too hard about this.</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Mrrow! Now that I think about it too, nobody&#39;s wearing any badges or cuffs that indicate that they&#39;re part of Team Night Stalking Jaguar!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Like matching colored windbreaker jackets...<br> Hm, what a grrreat idea.</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> When we get home, I&#39;ll go ask Da Vinci to make something like that.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Aw, darn. I&#39;m just so busy, I am pretty sure I won&#39;t be able to squeeze it in. Mark me down for a no!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> (If I did, I&#39;m pretty sure everyone in Chaldea would end up in jaguar print windbreakers...yuck!)</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou...</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Hm...well, I guess it&#39;s enough that we&#39;re all working with a single purrpose. For now, let&#39;s go purrsue our final delinquent. Follow meow!</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Did you just hear a dog barking?</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Who&#39;re you lookin&#39; at?<br> I&#39;ll break your back\u2014</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Ah! That&#39;s him!</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Crap... Ya gotta be freakin&#39; kiddin&#39;!</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> In case I heard wrong the first time, ya gotta tell me again. This thing...what dog breed is it?</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> ...Haha!</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> I see, I see... A GOLDEN retriever!<br> What a totally golden chance meeting!</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Good boy, good boy! Wanna Kintarou candy? No?<br> Ya want meat? Yeah, I figured.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Is that...Sakata Kintoki...?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Why is he talking to that woman who&#39;s walking her dog?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> He&#39;s petting that dog with a big smile on his face...</p><hr><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Oh I forgot...one of his skills lets him communicate with animals. He&#39;s very friendly with them.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Huh? Oh, it&#39;s you, Boss.<br> Whatcha doin&#39; out here so late at night?</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> No mistaking it! Bleached blond hair! Sunglasses! Lotsa bling-bling! He&#39;s definitely a super-duper delinquent Heroic Spirit!</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> ... (That thing&#39;s crazy.)</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> (I totally sense it without her sayin&#39; a single word: this sister&#39;s a real big hog sorta beast!)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Please don&#39;t get the wrong idea. I believe she is just out rounding up all those breaking curfew.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> What the hell? Don&#39;tcha know that I&#39;m a grown ass man? I&#39;m no boy.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> So it shouldn&#39;t matter where and when I hang out.<br> I ain&#39;t botherin&#39; no one.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Aw, dammit. That golden doggie got spooked by the pussy cat and ran away. I&#39;ll tell ya what, missy.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> I suggest you get that dangerous aura of yours under control. Normal folks won&#39;t be able to handle even lookin&#39; at ya.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> If by not handle, you mean one look at her destroys any intent to reform they may have had, then you would be correct, Sakata.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Yep. Definitely.</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Hey! Don&#39;t you two sink right back into your delinquent ways, dammit!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Look at how he&#39;s all dressed like a stereotypical delinquent... I can only imagine the kind of abuse he had to endure in the past!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> What sort of dark past does he hide in his heart!?<br> Find out...after this commercial break!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Okay, CUT!</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> What the heck? There&#39;s cameras rollin&#39;?<br> Seriously!? Where!?</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> There&#39;s no camera. Sheesh, figure that out yourself.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Hey, Archer.<br> Don&#39;t you think this guy&#39;s a little too na\xEFve?</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> He&#39;s na\xEFve to a fault.<br> I actually feel bad for bothering him.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> And...I&#39;m mortally afraid that his parent might put in an appearance...</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Okay! Now let&#39;s go and color that blond hair of yours. Let&#39;s show a teaser shot of your black hair right before we break for commercial to hook the viewers.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> HUH!?<br> You sayin&#39; you&#39;re gonna color my golden hair!?</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> ...That ain&#39;t right. That&#39;s cruel, sister. You got no call buttin&#39; in on a guy&#39;s way of life!</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> If you guys are serious, then I&#39;m just gonna have to go all-out to defend my GOLDEN look!</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Lookin&#39; at you all in red, blue, and tiger print, I got no problem cuttin&#39; loose since you clearly got no appreciation for gold!</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> My hair, my name, and even my axe are all golden! I&#39;ll give you a personal lesson on how awesome it is!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Oh crap! That young man is waving a weapon around and getting all violent!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> But this jaguar isn&#39;t afraid of anything!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Because...even in times like this, as long I use my trump card, I can reform anyone!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> That&#39;s right...as long as he&#39;s under my guidance<br> (read: beaten down)...nothing can stop me!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Tsk...</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Meowhaha. Give up and dye your hair black.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Senpai, Senpai...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> This may have all happened in the heat of the moment...but don&#39;t you think Jaguar Warrior has gotten a bit out of hand here?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Hmmm...it may be best that you said something.<br> The problem is WHAT to say...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I can&#39;t help but notice that you&#39;re blonde, too...</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> M-mrow!?<br> M-my hair is fine because I&#39;m an adult!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Are you one of those adults who forces others into a mold?</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Mrow!!! You&#39;ve hit a nerve there!</p><hr><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> Ah. We&#39;ve cornered her now, pointless as this whole game of cat and mouse has been, though...</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Hey, looks like that guy&#39;s going for a counterattack.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Hey you, the cat who can&#39;t take a freakin&#39; hint...I&#39;m only sayin&#39; this once, so listen up.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> This golden hair of mine is...</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> My natural hair color!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong></p><p>WHAT!?</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Really? Oh, then, that&#39;s fine.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> That was easy!</p><hr><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou!</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> ...I get it. That cat&#39;s tactic is just to go all-out. The moment we break through, her defenses weaken. Well then, I&#39;ll take this opportunity myself...</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> I&#39;ll have you know that these earrings of mine are family heirlooms, passed down by my parents. So that&#39;s why I can&#39;t take them off.</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Oh I see. Then that&#39;s purrfectly fine.<br> You can keep them on.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Easy. Too easy.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> (...I guess I have no choice.<br> I feel bad, but this is the end for her.)</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> Uh, so, actually... My hair did this on its own.<br> I don&#39;t bleach it at all.</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Heh? Haha, there&#39;s no fooling me on that! That can&#39;t be true! There&#39;s no point messing with me!</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> How come I&#39;m not getting a break!?</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> And so! Today&#39;s night rounds are over...but I&#39;m obviously going out tomorrow night! Got that, Reformed Delinquent Boy, Unit 1!?</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> The journey of the young man who idolizes the jaguar on her nightly rounds! Until he can finally put his serial dating days behind him!</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> (Sigh) I guess I&#39;m stuck with her a little longer.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> Sorry, Master.<br> She doesn&#39;t mean any harm. Probably.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> She&#39;s trying to better the world in her own odd way. I&#39;ll take care of the rest.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> You go back to Chaldea and rest up. Me? Just keeping a cup of tea ready for me will be enough.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> And there goes Emiya...<br> That is the posture of a sad, defeated man...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> He looks kinda happy, too...</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> You think so?<br> If Senpai thinks so, maybe it&#39;s true...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Yeah. I agree with Fujimaru.<br> He does seem like he is a little happy.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> He&#39;s the sort of Heroic Spirit who&#39;s always taking care of everyone else, but it always seemed like he kept his distance from Jaguar Warrior before.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> But it looks like he&#39;s given up and now he&#39;s tagging along with her. I&#39;d say it all turned out okay.</p>', 353);
