She was a young girl knight born to King Lot and Fae Queen Morgan, and the sister of Gawain, Gaheris, and Agravain. Mordred the Knight of Treachery was her half-brother.</p><p>She was also known as Guerrehet and Beaumains (Beautiful Hands).</p><p>Gareth was the newest addition to the Round Table and the least experienced knight. She held respect for all her senior Knights of the Round Table. She was especially attached to Sir Lancelot and often followed him.</p><p>Gareth went through numerous trainings as a squire (such as working in the castle disguised as a kitchen boy, fighting her brother Gawain, and pursuing learning under the fae folk) and eventually became an official member of the Knights of the Round Table. Like Gaheris, she did not accompany their eldest brother Gawain after her knighthood and instead chose to become an attendant of Lancelot.</p><p>\u2666</p><p>Gareth was loved by many for her brimming potential. Even the other Knights of the Round Table, not just her brothers, spoke highly of her claiming that \u201Cshe will become the greatest knight one day\u201D and that \u201Cin time, she will become a true knight rivaling all her brothers.\u201D</p><p>When Agravain plotted to indict Queen Guinevere and Sir Lancelot of adultery, Gareth opposed him. She said, \u201CI will not speak of unsettling statements about Sir Lancelot, who conferred the title of a knight to me,\u201D and left the scene filled with deep sorrow.</p><p>Later, Agravain caught Lancelot in the act of committing adultery, but this resulted to him losing his life in retaliation. Gareth was then ordered to attend the captured Queen Guinevere\u2019s execution. Gareth complied but made it clear that she would be witnessing the execution against her will and attended without wearing armor or carrying weapon on her person. This decision would lead to her demise.</p><p>Gareth\u2019s unarmed head was cracked open in Sir Lancelot\u2019s rescue of the queen.</p><p>Many lives were lost in this chain of incidents. Agravain, Gaheris, and lastly Gareth\u2014Having lost his siblings, how tremendous must have been Sir Gawain\u2019s grief? Thus, a schism divided the Round Table, and the glory of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table came to an end.</p><h2 id="character-in-fgo" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#character-in-fgo" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Character in FGO</h2><p>She honors chivalry, and believes in and follows justice. She is proud to serve under the King of Knights, and even now considers being chosen as a member of the Round Table the greatest honor of her life.</p><p>She still respects Sir Lancelot. Even if the knight who blindly rushed to rescue Queen Guinevere never caught sight of her figure on the day everything spiraled to the end\u2026 And even if the knight did recognize her but still slew her without hesitation, she respects him all the same.</p><h2 id="standard-weapons" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#standard-weapons" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Standard Weapons</h2><p><strong>Her favorite jousting lance</strong></p><p>Although Gareth\u2019s skill with the lance is justly proven, this lance has been enhanced multiple times by Merlin\u2019s magecraft and has become a type of Mystic Code.</p><h2 id="related-characters" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#related-characters" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Related Characters</h2><p><strong>Artoria</strong></p><p>Our King of Knights.
