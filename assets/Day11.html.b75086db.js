You should think things through before you take that.&quot;</p><hr><p>When she turned around, before her was the most feared magus in the country.</p><p>The magus said...</p><p>That she would no longer be human once she took ahold of the sword.</p><hr><p>The girl only responded with a nod.</p><p>Becoming a king means no longer being human.</p><p>She was prepared for that ever since she was born.</p><p>In short, a king is someone who kills everyone to protect everyone.</p><p>The young girl thought about it every night and shuddered until morning came.</p><p>No day passed that she did not fear that fact.</p><p>But the girl said that it would end this day.</p><hr><p>The sword was pulled out as if it were only natural to do so, and the place was filled with light.</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015In that instant, she became something not human.</p><p>The king&#39;s gender does not matter.</p><p>No one will care about the king&#39;s appearance or even notice it if the king acts like a king.</p><hr><p>Even if anybody noticed that the king was female, there would be no problem if she was a good king.</p><p>Perhaps because of the sword&#39;s magecraft, the girl&#39;s growth stopped at that time as well.</p><p>Many knights feared it as ominous, but most of them praised their master&#39;s immortality as divine.</p><hr><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015And thus.</p><p>The time of the king who would become a legend started.</p><hr><p>The battles of the new king were indeed the acts of a god of war.</p><p>The king always led from the front.</p><p>No enemies could stand in her way.</p><p>Arturia, the god of war.</p><p>There was no defeat for a body admired as a dragon in human form.</p><hr><p>For ten years and twelve battles, she knew only victory.</p><p>Those were the days she ran through as the king.</p><p>She never turned back and was never disgraced.</p><p>She was raised as the king and fulfilled her obligations as the king.</p><hr><p>Is that why I saw such a figure?</p><hr><p>Her soul must still be on the battlefield.</p><p>Before daybreak.</p><p>Resting her body in the wind under the indigo blue sky, she just gazes into the distance.</p><hr><p>The sky is high, and the clouds are flowing fast.</p><p>Under the clear air, she is looking at the great army she must face with her sword in hand.</p><hr><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015That figure is burned in and will not go away.</p><p>She and her sword are one.</p><p>The sword from the stone that chose the king.</p><p>I think the brilliance of the sword that selected her fate is also her brilliance.</p><hr><p>But I wonder in the dream.</p><p>That sword is different from the one she had.</p><p>It is similar, but different.</p><p>The one she used last night is different from this sword.</p><hr><p>...So.</p><p>How did she lose such a fine sword...?</p><hr><p>When I wake up, I&#39;m in my room.</p><p>It&#39;s light outside.</p><p>I guess I fell asleep after coming back to my room, unable to make a decision.</p><hr><p>&quot;...That... dream...&quot;</p><p>It was a strange dream.</p><p>Events I shouldn&#39;t know about, things I don&#39;t know about Saber.</p><p>Is it possible for me to dream about them?</p><hr><p>&quot;...But that sword was certainly different from the one Saber had....&quot;</p><hr><p>I vaguely think.</p><p>Saber&#39;s true identity that was hidden.</p><p>...To be honest, I still can&#39;t accept who she is.</p><p>Saber is just Saber.</p><p>I can&#39;t change my attitude just because I know who she was before, and I don&#39;t think Saber would want that either.</p><hr><p>&quot;...But it suited her.&quot;</p><p>The sword from yesterday suited her, but the sword in my dream also suited her.</p><p>No, you could say I was fascinated.</p><p>With yesterday&#39;s sword and the sword in my dream... it seems I fall for swords easily.</p><hr><p>I also thought Lancer&#39;s lance was beautiful when I saw it, but my interest in swords is exceptional.</p><p>It seems Emiya Shirou is easily attracted to swords.</p><hr><p>&quot;Well... it&#39;s not like that only just started.&quot;</p><p>I take a deep breath and reach up to my sweaty face.</p><hr><p>&quot;...But it sure is hot.&quot;</p><p>I wipe the sweat off my forehead.</p><p>Even though it&#39;s winter, my body is burning.</p><p>It feels like my blood is getting hotter, and I feel restless.</p><hr><p>&quot;...I wonder why... ever since I saw Saber&#39;s sword...&quot;</p><p>...My body has been strangely hot.</p><p>The hand that bears the Command Spell is hot as if it&#39;s holding a pocket heater.</p><hr><p>&quot;...It&#39;s like that time Tohsaka made me swallow that jewel... like it&#39;s itchy, or it makes me want to run around.&quot;</p><p>I take a deep breath to try to calm myself.</p><hr><p>&quot;...I guess Saber&#39;s still asleep...&quot;</p><p>Saber has not woken up even once since last night.</p><p>But it still seems she&#39;s getting better.</p><p>Her breathing is calm now and there&#39;s no sign she is gasping in pain.</p><p>Saber is sleeping peacefully.</p><p>This is an everyday morning scene.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015Maybe if...&quot;</p><p>If I let her sleep like this, she might get back to normal.</p><p>Then there&#39;ll be no need to have her kill people.</p><p>Then, just like now, Saber will be with me and\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015How selfish of me\u2015\u2015!&quot;</p><p>I hit the wall.</p><p>I&#39;m so weak it makes me sick.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015It&#39;s my fault Saber&#39;s in this state.</p><p>Who am I to say\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>...I get up, trying not to make a sound.</p><p>I don&#39;t know when Saber will wake up.</p><p>But I have to make a decision before she does.</p><hr><p>Tohsaka must still be asleep.</p><p>There&#39;s no energy in the house, and it feels like it&#39;s abandoned.</p><p>No, I&#39;m just depressed.</p><p>I can&#39;t decide, so I&#39;m wandering around in a gray state, and that causes the world to be vague.</p><hr><p>&quot;...?&quot;</p><p>I hear something cut through the air.</p><hr><p>&quot;Again... it&#39;s from the yard, but that\u2015\u2015</p><p>I remember that sound.</p><p>...Yeah.</p><p>I don&#39;t feel like cooking breakfast right now, so I&#39;ll take a walk and check it out.</p><hr><p>It&#39;s much colder than usual outside.</p><p>It must be really cold if my burning body feels it.</p><p>It&#39;s so cold that it might snow.</p><hr><p>&quot;...It&#39;s from the shed area.&quot;</p><p>The sound is coming periodically.</p><p>I cross the yard, breathing out white puffs.</p><hr><p>He&#39;s there in front of the shed.</p><p>...I guess I kind of knew he would be here, so I wasn&#39;t surprised.</p><p>He must have been shooting arrows until now.</p><p>He lowers his bow in displeasure as soon as he sees me.</p><hr><p>&quot;That&#39;s dangerous. Don&#39;t shoot bows in someone else&#39;s house. What are you going to do if you hit someone?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I would not have to do anything as I am not using any arrows. One cannot be hit by something that is not fired.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;......&quot;</p><p>He doesn&#39;t need to tell me that.</p><p>The sound was Archer&#39;s bow string cutting through the air.</p><p>I don&#39;t know why, but Archer isn&#39;t using any arrows, but only pulling his bow.</p><hr><p>&quot;...That&#39;s a good bow. I wasn&#39;t convinced until now, but you really are an Archer.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Well. I&#39;m not an archer like the ones you know, so I would not be able to answer you even if you asked me about archery.</p><p>Your arrows are shot to target yourself, while my arrows are shot to hit an enemy. The archer you have in mind must be the kind that respects manners and politeness.&quot;</p><hr><p>He curls his lips offensively.</p><p>As I thought, I can&#39;t get along with him.</p><hr><p>&quot;I don&#39;t intend to ask you about archery.</p><p>I was just wondering what you were doing.&quot;</p><p>&quot;As you can see, I am merely checking my condition.</p><p>The wound Saber gave me has healed. I cannot stay on watch forever.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>...I see.</p><p>He&#39;s healed now. Then that means Tohsaka should return to the war.</p><hr><p>I turn away.</p><p>Since Tohsaka and Archer are rejoining the battle, I must make a decision.</p><p>I have to think seriously somewhere I can be alone.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015There is a concept called &#39;follow-through&#39;.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Huh?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;The time you have after you take your shot.</p><p>I believe that is the only thing common to your archery and mine.&quot;</p><p>&quot;...What? You don&#39;t have to tell me about the eight stages of shooting.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Just listen. They say the body stays there naturally after you shoot a bow. I heard that you call it follow-through.&quot;</p><p>&quot;......&quot;</p><p>Certainly, there are eight movements in archery called the eight stages of shooting.</p><p>The last one, the follow through, is the state that comes after shooting an arrow, but\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>&quot;...Yeah. So what about it?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I am talking about your mental preparation. Follow through is not intended to ascertain if the arrow has hit the target.</p><p>An arrow has hit the target even before it is released. The archer lets the arrow go according to that image.</p><p>So there is no need to check if the arrow has hit or not.</p><p>Because if you think the arrow will hit, it will hit the target, and if you do not, the arrow will not hit.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015That&#39;s not true. There are shots that won&#39;t hit no matter how much you think they will. Everyone would hit the target every time if all you have to do is to think about hitting it.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Is that so? Well, you hit the target every time.&quot;</p><p>&quot;What\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>His statement makes my heart jump.</p><p>That&#39;s certainly\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>&quot;Well, I do not care about that. There is only one thing I want to tell you. Follow through is not intended to ascertain if you have hit the target or not. What happens to the released arrow is obvious.</p><p>So follow through is a preparation to accept that result, is it not?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015I know. So you&#39;re saying I should be able to see through this thing until the end, right?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Exactly. I heard about Saber&#39;s situation. You should have known from the beginning that she would end up like this. She will disappear in time if she fights without a magical energy supply.</p><p>That fact was already determined. So\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><hr><p>...All that&#39;s left is to accept the result.</p><p>Is he saying that no matter what happens to Saber because of my decisions, all I can do is see through what happens?</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>I turn my back to Archer.</p><p>I will leave this guy once and for all.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Oh, and one more thing. I will tell you since you don&#39;t seem to know.&quot;</p><p>I hear a voice behind me.</p><hr><p>&quot;Saber should have known she would disappear if she used her Noble Phantasm. She probably did not intend to use her Noble Phantasm until the very end.&quot;</p><p>The usual offensive tone isn&#39;t present in his voice.</p><hr><p>&quot;There is only one reason she used her Noble Phantasm in spite of that.</p><p>She chose to protect you over her own existence.</p><p>Never forget that.&quot;</p><p>His voice holds only honest sincerity.</p><hr><h2 id="scene-01" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#scene-01" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Scene 01</h2><p>&quot;......&quot;</p><p>I don&#39;t know how serious Illya is.</p><p>I&#39;m sure it&#39;s just a metaphor or something when she tells me to be her Servant, and even if I did become her familiar, nothing would change.</p><hr><p>I won&#39;t be of any use, and Illya already has Berserker.</p><p>Illya shouldn&#39;t need a crappy magus like myself.</p><hr><p>&quot;Now answer.</p><p>Will you be with me...?&quot;</p><p>Illya&#39;s voice is full of expectation.</p><p>I....</p><p>&quot;...All right. I&#39;ll be your familiar.&quot;</p><p>...Answer with a lie as a temporary measure.</p><hr><p>&quot;Yes...! Great! Now, we&#39;ll be together forever, Onii-chan!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Wha...?&quot;</p><p>She must be really happy as she is jumping around in joy.</p><hr><p>&quot;......&quot;</p><p>...My heart&#39;s in pain.</p><p>I convinced myself that I could not help it since I&#39;m a captive, and I deceived Illya.</p><p>Seeing her this happy makes me feel sorry, and makes me feel like I could listen to her selfishness a bit\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>&quot;Huh\u2015\u2015?&quot;</p><p>I feel dizzy.</p><p>It feels like an invisible weight is resting on my back.</p><hr><p>&quot;Illya.&quot;</p><p>I call out to Illya, driven by the unknown uneasiness.</p><hr><p>&quot;Hm, what Shirou? Oh, I&#39;ll take off your ropes right away.&quot;</p><p>&quot;...That&#39;s not it, but\u2015\u2015I feel a bit sick.&quot;</p><p>I feel like I&#39;m about to throw up, so I desperately adjust my breathing.</p><hr><p>&quot;What? You don&#39;t feel well, your body&#39;s heavy, and you can&#39;t help feeling uneasy?&quot;</p><p>\u2015\u2015That smile.</p><p>Looking at that cruel smile that knows everything about me...</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015Illya.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yeah, I know everything about you now. Because you made a contract with me.</p><p>You can&#39;t hide anything from me now.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015!&quot;</p><p>This is bad.</p><p>Directed by the unknown uneasiness different from the former direct uneasiness, I stand up.</p><p>But my body won&#39;t move.</p><p>It&#39;s not bound by Illya&#39;s magical energy.</p><p>My body doesn&#39;t move at my will...!?</p><hr><p>&quot;Illya, what have you...!?</p><p>&quot;It&#39;s you yourself that did it. You feel sick because you lied to me. You&#39;re so kind that you hurt yourself.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...But yeah. You didn&#39;t put too much feeling in your answer, so I&#39;ll ask you again.</p><p>Onii-chan, you will be mine, right?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Ah\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>The weight on my back digs through my skin and permeates inside me.</p><hr><p>&quot;Come on, admit it, Shirou. Your soul is mine now.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Ah\u2015\u2015\u2015gah...!&quot;</p><p>I gasp.</p><p>My mouth opens by itself and my tongue repeats the words without thought.</p><hr><p>&quot;All... right\u2015\u2015I&#39;ll be.... your.... familiar\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Yes. I have accepted Emiya Shirou, in the name of Illyasviel.</p><p>Fufu. I&#39;ve seized your soul now.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015Illya.&quot;</p><p>I have to get up, tear off this rope, and run away as fast as I can.</p><p>Even if Illya gets in the way, I can push her to the side.</p><p>Things will get out of hand if I don&#39;t.</p><p>Yes, things will get out of hand, so why\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>&quot;My body won&#39;t move...&quot;</p><p>My limbs won&#39;t respond as if telling me I&#39;m not their master.</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh, you don&#39;t have to worry, Shirou. It&#39;s just that all the commands to your body are shut out right now.</p><p>I&#39;ll make that body something that&#39;ll hold your soul, and I&#39;ll quickly make you a new body.</p><p>Human bodies are fragile, so I&#39;m going to transfer your mind into something that won&#39;t matter if it breaks.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh, but I guess you don&#39;t understand what I&#39;m saying, huh?</p><p>Hmm, I guess you won&#39;t understand even if I explain, and it&#39;s more about getting used to it than learning about it.</p><p>&quot;Sella, Leysritt. I&#39;m going to start the Apport right now, so bring me a suitable doll.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>I can&#39;t even talk now.</p><p>Even though I&#39;m here, I feel like I&#39;m watching it all through a screen.</p><hr><p>&quot;Here you go, Ojou-sama. I hear you are going to perform the Apport...&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes. I really don&#39;t want to wear it, but I&#39;ll use the heavenly garment since I don&#39;t want to fail no matter what. Liz, can you get it ready?&quot;</p><p>&quot;...It is done. But is this all right, Illya...?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;W-What? Are you going to tell me what to do even though you&#39;re a failure, Leysritt!? S-Shirou agreed, so I can make him my familiar...!&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;No, you are not mistaken.</p><p>You are saying too much, Leysritt. We do not care what happens to such a human. No, since he is able to feel her miracle, it should be an honor for him.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...Sella, you indulge Illya too much. Do you realize that has the opposite effect...?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Leysritt! Do not speak of Ojou-sama like that...! Illyasviel-sama is the successor of Einzbern&#39;s miracle. She is different from failures like us.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...Sigh. Illya, let&#39;s start. Sella is really annoying.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Leysritt!&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>Of the two servants, the calm one approaches me.</p><hr><p>Liz\u2015\u2015the one called Leysritt...</p><p>&quot;...Sorry. You won&#39;t be able to go back into this container anymore.&quot;</p><p>...Blanks my vision as if turning off a switch.</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh, Ojou-sama. It seems someone has trespassed in the forest. What should we do? Should we send Berserker?&quot;</p><hr><p>I hear their voices.</p><p>...That&#39;s strange.</p><p>My mind isn&#39;t connected to my limbs and my senses are already gone.</p><p>If I&#39;m not connected to my body, what is listening to their voices?</p><hr><p>&quot;Of course not. They came a long way to come here, so it&#39;s impolite unless we welcome them properly. You two hide yourselves with Berserker.</p><p>I will have Rin and Saber see that Shirou has become mine. After that, I&#39;ll let Berserker do what he wants.&quot;</p><hr><p>...She giggles.</p><p>I don&#39;t have any senses, but I feel like my arm has been grabbed.</p><hr><p>\u2015\u2015I start to pass out.</p><p>I don&#39;t know what will happen to me in a few minutes, but\u2015\u2015I can understand that my fight has already ended....</p><hr><h2 id="scene-02" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#scene-02" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Scene 02</h2><p>\u2015\u2015I don&#39;t even need to think about it.</p><p>And I can only take so much.</p><p>Why does everyone think that Saber is disappearing?</p><p>Saber won&#39;t disappear, and I&#39;m going to fight with her until the very end.</p><p>I can&#39;t undermine that oath with something like this.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Illya, I can&#39;t do what you&#39;re telling me.

If you won&#39;t listen to me, I won&#39;t listen to you either.</p><p>I&#39;ve let you guys off up to now, but I&#39;m done with that.&quot;</p><p>Illya&#39;s voice is filled with murderous intent.</p><p>I feel an ominous tone to it.</p><hr><p>&quot;Wait here. I&#39;ll be done right away.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Hold on...! What are you going to do, Illya...!?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I&#39;m going to go kill Saber and Rin. You&#39;ll regret your action a bit if I kill them, right?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Wha\u2015\u2015? Don&#39;t say such a stupid thing...! Saber and Tohsaka have nothing to do with this! I&#39;m saying I can&#39;t be with you for my own reasons alone...!&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Is that so? But I&#39;m going to kill them anyways. You&#39;ll be next, Shirou. I don&#39;t need you if you&#39;re not going to be mine.&quot;</p><hr><p>She starts to go.</p><p>She&#39;s serious.</p><p>She&#39;s going to go kill Saber and Tohsaka.</p><p>...And Illya will probably manage that easily.</p><hr><p>&quot;Don&#39;t do it, Illya...! They have nothing to do with this...! I&#39;m the one you captured, so just kill me if you hate me...! There&#39;s no reason to kill them...!&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;There is a reason. I can&#39;t let other Masters live. That&#39;s the Holy Grail War, right?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Idiot, don&#39;t say you&#39;re going to kill people that easily...! It doesn&#39;t suit you. You&#39;re still a child, so you can&#39;t do such things...!&quot;</p><hr><p>After looking at me in amazement...</p><p>&quot;Too bad.

Oh yeah, I can&#39;t move because I saw Illya&#39;s eyes...&quot;</p><hr><p>It must be what they call the Mystic Eyes.</p><p>They say a superior magus is able to intervene magically with a target just by looking into their eyes.</p><p>A common form of Mystic Eyes is &quot;binding&quot;, so this must be something like that.</p><hr><p>As eyes perceive visual information, their disadvantage is that they are weak against suggestion.</p><p>Therefore, a magus usually casts some protection over their eyes to shut out others&#39; magical energy.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Who knows what Tohsaka would say if she found out I was bound by suggestion without even casting a spell...&quot;</p><hr><p>...Well, they&#39;re just Mystic Eyes that are acquired with the use of magecraft.</p><p>But I hear that monsters born with such eyes don&#39;t even need to look at the eyes of their target.</p><p>These people exhibit their ability just by &quot;looking&quot;, but I hear such powers are rare.</p><hr><p>So.</p><p>Fortunately, it doesn&#39;t seem like Illya&#39;s Mystic Eyes are the special kind.

Even if I do exchange blows with Berserker, I will not be able to deliver a fatal wound. If we are to defeat him, we should do so outside of battle.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...Outside of battle... you mean we&#39;ll attack Berserker before he notices us...?</p><p>Well, you&#39;re right that it&#39;s reckless to fight him straight on, but that plan is even more reckless. He&#39;s not the type that&#39;ll allow us to take him by surprise.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Yeah, we won&#39;t make any optimistic plans that assume we can get near Berserker without being noticed.</p><p>They have Illyasviel. She&#39;ll sense Shirou and Saber&#39;s presence easily. I&#39;m fine since I can hide my presence.&quot;</p><hr><p>...Hm.</p><p>I don&#39;t know how it works, but Illya can feel Saber and my presence, huh?</p><p>If Tohsaka is the only one who can hide, then\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>&quot;...Don&#39;t tell me that you&#39;re going to be the one doing the surprise attack.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Of course. You&#39;re the one she&#39;s after the most, and I&#39;m the best suited for this role. Leave it to me to slash Berserker from behind.&quot;</p><p>&quot;You say so, but Berserker can&#39;t be that off guard.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Of course not. That&#39;s why I&#39;m going to have Saber create an opening.</p><p>Saber, how much have you recovered?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Normal battle should not be a problem, but I should avoid using my Noble Phantasm.</p><p>With the amount of magical energy Shirou gave me, I will no longer be able to maintain my body the instant I use my Noble Phantasm. Even if I do use it, it will not be full force, so I do not think it would be able to defeat Berserker.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Yeah, that&#39;s more than enough. I&#39;ll have you fight Berserker. Shirou as well, of course.</p><p>And I&#39;ll watch while hiding. I&#39;m only an extra for Illyasviel, so I think she&#39;ll assume I&#39;ve run away if I&#39;m not there.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...Okay. Well... I think that&#39;s possible, but...&quot;</p><p>&quot;If the probability&#39;s low, raise it.</p><p>You seem to be on good terms with Illyasviel, so you may be able to trick her.&quot;</p><p>Tohsaka looks at me meaningfully.</p><hr><p>&quot;...I have some objections, but I&#39;ll take that.</p><p>Illya would believe me if I told her you ran away. I don&#39;t think she would doubt anyone.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;But there is still a problem.</p><p>I am fine fighting Berserker, but I cannot have Shirou do the same. Shirou cannot stand Berserker&#39;s attacks.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;I&#39;m not telling Shirou to go hand-to-hand against Berserker.</p><p>Shirou will support you from the back. It&#39;s going to be difficult for Saber to fight Berserker alone, so help her when she&#39;s in trouble.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Ridiculous. Shirou does not excel in black magecraft like you do, Rin.</p><p>How would he be able to support me?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Shirou will think of a way.</p><p>...But, well, there won&#39;t really be any room for a Master to interfere against Berserker. Even I wouldn&#39;t be much help if I did something.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;But we don&#39;t have enough to spare to let anyone stay idle.</p><p>I know Saber is done for if Shirou dies, but I&#39;ll still have him do this. ...After all, this battle is a gamble from the very beginning.&quot;</p><p>&quot;That... is true.&quot;</p><hr><p>Saber grows silent with a troubled face.</p><p>As Tohsaka is silent too, she must know she&#39;s saying something unreasonable.</p><hr><p>The two&#39;s concern is only natural.</p><p>That night I met Saber...</p><p>When we were attacked by Berserker, I could only use my body to defend her.</p><p>There&#39;s a high probability that would happen again.</p><p>So I should stay away from the battlefield, but I would have no intention of doing that even if she didn&#39;t tell me to be there.</p><hr><p>&quot;I know. I&#39;ll do something to back her up.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Eh?&quot;</p><p>Both of them turn around.</p><p>Whoa, were my words that surprising?</p><hr><p>&quot;I just have to support her from a distance, right?</p><p>Then I think I&#39;ll be able to do something.&quot;</p><p>Saying that, I hold up the branch I just collected.</p><hr><p>The length is perfect. The flexibility is good as well.</p><p>...This is the first time I&#39;ve done this kind of &quot;strengthening&quot;.</p><p>But I don&#39;t think there&#39;s any flaw in the principle.</p><p>The point is, I just need to keep reinforcing it until it becomes a real one.</p><hr><p>And for this, I also have a reference since he had one too.</p><p>And on top of that, magical energy has been flowing in my body for a while now.</p><p>I just have to repeat the usual process now.</p><hr><p>I analyze the basic structure and modify it.</p><p>I analyze the composition materials and reinforce them.</p><p>...But that&#39;s not enough if the original is a branch and the finished product is his bow.</p><p>I have to imagine it from the concept of creation.</p><p>If I am to get it close enough to the real one, I have to formulate every hypothesis, at least in my head.</p><hr><p>...I open my eyes.</p><p>The branch is shaped right, but, um\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>&quot;Man. It&#39;s not even close.&quot;</p><p>It&#39;s ugly and crooked.</p><p>But I know it will work as a bow.</p><p>I just have to make the arrows in the same way.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015Shirou, that was...&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yeah. I think I got the hang of it after the thing with Shinji. You said so too that I shouldn&#39;t strain myself too much.&quot;</p><p>&quot;...I see. Well, it&#39;s good that we have a way to attack, so it&#39;s enough for now.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Going back to the original topic.</p><p>I will have you two fight Berserker. I&#39;ll get on top of a tree beforehand and watch from above.</p><p>When Saber creates an opening in Berserker&#39;s defense, I&#39;ll skewer Berserker from above using all of my reserve jewels.</p><p>It&#39;s a simple plan.&quot;</p><p>Tohsaka&#39;s expression asks for questions.</p><hr><p>&quot;... Jewels... is that Rin&#39;s magecraft?</p><p>But a normal magecraft will not harm Berserker. We need a full-purity attack to injure him.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;I know. So in other words, we need an attack with an A rating, right?&quot;</p><p>Saying that, Tohsaka takes a jewel out of her pocket.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015What is that jewel?&quot;</p><p>&quot;This is like my savings that I&#39;ve been building up since I was small. One of these can instantly generate an A-rank great magecraft. I had ten, but I used one on you.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;I see\u2015\u2015if it is the magecraft from that time, Berserker will certainly not be able to block it.</p><p>He does not have magecraft resistance like I do. Even if it is magecraft, an A-rank will penetrate him without any problems\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;That&#39;s right. I thought about using it in small amounts, but I can&#39;t be saying things like that now. I&#39;ll give Berserker two or three of these.&quot;</p><p>Tohsaka sticks out her chest in confidence.</p><p>...But.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Hey. Aren&#39;t you being a bit stingy?&quot;</p><p>&quot;...I feel the same way. I should not be saying this, but I believe you should be generous enough to at least use half of these.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Ugh... w-what? It&#39;s my business, right!?</p><p>Do you guys know how hard it was to save this much!?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;......&quot;</p><p>&quot;......&quot;</p><p>Saber and I protest silently.</p><p>Tohsaka&#39;s life depends on this as well, so it won&#39;t be funny if she gets stingy and we end up failing because of that.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Fine. I&#39;ll use half of them, okay!?</p><p>&quot;...Come on, I just wanted to say that. I get what you guys are saying too.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015Anyways, that&#39;s the plan.</p><p>Now, we have to find somewhere where I can hide and where it&#39;ll be easy for Shirou to support Saber. Let&#39;s find a good spot before Illyasviel gets here.&quot;</p><hr><p>...Yeah, we can&#39;t stay in this ruin now.</p><p>As Tohsaka says, all that&#39;s left is to find a spot to wait for Berserker.</p><p>But before that\u2015\u2015</p><hr><h2 id="scene-07" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#scene-07" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Scene 07</h2><p>...I wonder if Saber&#39;s really all right.</p><p>She says she will have no problems fighting, but isn&#39;t it hard on her fighting Berserker when she was so weak before?</p><hr><p>No, I&#39;m more worried about her Noble Phantasm.</p><p>&quot;I will not be able to maintain my body if I use it.&quot;</p><p>Saber said that.</p><p>That means that Saber will disappear the instant she uses that sword.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015Saber&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes. What is it, Shirou?&quot;</p><p>&quot;...Can you promise me one thing before we fight?&quot;</p><p>&quot;...? Yes, I do not mind if it is something I can do.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...Okay. Um, I don&#39;t want you to use your Noble Phantasm no matter what situation we end up in.</p><p>It&#39;s a serious matter if we use that on the ground, and I don&#39;t want you to disappear even if we can defeat Berserker with it.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Yes, I understand. I do not intend to use the Noble Phantasm either. I do not think I will be able to defeat Berserker with the amount of magical energy I have, and more importantly, I will not be able to obtain the Holy Grail if I disappear.&quot;</p><p>Saber declares so.</p><p>That makes me happy.</p><hr><p>&quot;All right. You&#39;re the same as always. I&#39;m relieved that you&#39;re so sickeningly calm.&quot;</p><p>&quot;...Hm. What is that supposed to mean, Shirou?&quot;</p><p>&quot;No, it doesn&#39;t mean anything. Let&#39;s just go outside. Tohsaka will complain at us again if we&#39;re late.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;You are right. It seems to be Rin&#39;s hobby to complain at you.&quot;</p><p>...Saying such an ominous thing, Saber heads to the exit.</p><hr><p>\u2015\u2015Then.</p><p>Saber&#39;s body falls forward as if she tripped on something.</p><p>&quot;...!!&quot;</p><p>I quickly grab her hand.</p><hr><p>&quot;Come on, watch your feet. Things are scattered around, so you have to watch out\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>&quot;......&quot;</p><p>...Hey.</p><p>Saber is blushing awkwardly.</p><hr><p>&quot;S-Saber...? What? Is something wrong?&quot;</p><p>&quot;...No, it is not that... but if you are holding my hand, um...&quot;</p><p>Saber blushes even more.</p><p>...Her figure looks like me from earlier.</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>I blush too.</p><p>Her hand in mine. ...I vividly recall Saber&#39;s sensations and pull away quickly.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>Unable to say anything, we just stand there.</p><hr><p>&quot;...L-Let&#39;s go outside. We have to go or we won&#39;t have much time.&quot;</p><p>&quot;T-That is right. Let us hurry, Shirou.&quot;</p><p>We start to go with that forced conversation.</p><hr><p>...Once we go outside, we won&#39;t return here.</p><p>I look back at the ruin for the last time and head to the battlefield, suppressing my beating heart.</p><hr><h2 id="scene-08" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#scene-08" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Scene 08</h2><p>...I don&#39;t want to think so, but...</p><p>Tohsaka won&#39;t be stingy using her jewels, will she...?</p><hr><p>&quot;Hold on. I&#39;ll say this again, but no holding back, Tohsaka. It&#39;s true that jewels are expensive, but they can&#39;t substitute for your life, right?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Heh. You can say such irresponsible things because you don&#39;t know the state of my financial affairs. I bet you&#39;d fall over if you found out how expensive one of these is.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015Hey. I won&#39;t lose my legs just from money talk!</p><p>...All right. If you say that, I&#39;ll take responsibility. I&#39;ll pay for half the jewels you use.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Really? A man wouldn&#39;t back out of that, right?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;No. I have some money saved up, and I&#39;ll work and repay you if that&#39;s not enough. We&#39;re having you use a weapon that you&#39;ve saved up, so I have to show some sincerity.&quot;</p><hr><p>...Well, it&#39;s more like being obstinate than sincerity.</p><p>I guess I want to show off to Tohsaka.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Hey, what&#39;s going on? You&#39;re smiling really crookedly.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes, it&#39;s true that I&#39;m happy, and it&#39;s also true that I&#39;ve found a certain enjoyment.</p><p>By the way, Emiya-kun. Do you not need to ask how much one of these jewels costs?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015Well, it&#39;s not like it&#39;s only 100,000 yen, right?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Nope. That would be about right if it was a one-time use.&quot;</p><p>&quot;...Then, something like 200,000 yen?&quot;</p><p>&quot;That&#39;s a really odd increase. But that&#39;s not it.&quot;</p><p>&quot;...T-Then, like 250,000 yen?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Hey now. Wouldn&#39;t you usually move on to the next digit?</p><p>Why don&#39;t you go above six digits?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Guh... I don&#39;t want to say this, but maybe 300,000 yen?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;I&#39;m telling you. Why aren&#39;t you going to seven digits?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Agh... could it be 1,000,000 yen?&quot;</p><p>I ask, feeling like I&#39;m jumping off a bridge.</p><hr><p>&quot;Close. One more digit.&quot;</p><p>But what&#39;s below me is a hole leading straight to hell.</p><hr><p>It&#39;s astronomical.</p><p>I can&#39;t imagine such a large number... if you convert it into damages, it would kill any enemy boss.</p><p>&quot;What&#39;s wrong? You look pale, Emiya-kun.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Uh\u2015\u2015no, I&#39;m okay, I can calculate fine.&quot;</p><p>I can, but it&#39;s working against me in this case.</p><hr><p>&quot;Really? Then I&#39;ll ask you just in case, but I can use my jewels, right? I won&#39;t spare anything. I&#39;ll use them without holding anything back.&quot;</p><p>...!</p><p>I swallow my words, trying to tell her to use them sparingly if she can.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015Tohsaka, can I have credit?&quot;</p><p>I show as much courage as I can.</p><p>&quot;Of course. I won&#39;t put interest on it, so you can take your whole life to pay me back.&quot;</p><p>Tohsaka-san answers seriously without a trace of humor.</p><hr><p>Hey, I can&#39;t pay back an amount that large even if I use my whole life.</p><p>...Man.</p><p>I don&#39;t want to think about it, but I feel like Tohsaka controls my life now...</p><hr><h2 id="scene-09" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#scene-09" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Scene 09</h2><p>We reach an open clearing in the forest.</p><p>The sun is rising and the forest is darkened by the morning mist.</p><p>Compared to the inside of the dense forest, this place has an open view.</p><hr><p>&quot;Tohsaka. This place is okay, right?&quot;</p><p>&quot;...Yeah. It meets several conditions, but I don&#39;t know about the view being so open. There aren&#39;t any escape routes for you or Saber.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...Hm.&quot;</p><p>She&#39;s such a perfectionist, considering even the escape routes.</p><hr><p>&quot;Let&#39;s look for another place. We should have time.&quot;</p><p>Tohsaka reenters the forest.</p><p>&quot;......&quot;</p><p>But Saber stares into the distance and doesn&#39;t move.</p><hr><p>&quot;Saber? What are you doing? If we don&#39;t hurry, Illyasviel will\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><hr><p>I feel a chill.</p><p>I can&#39;t forget it, since I felt it once already.</p><p>I can&#39;t even see him nor feel his presence.</p><p>But this pressure on my body must be because of him.</p><hr><p>\u2015\u2015Fufu. Found you\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>A girl&#39;s voice echoes through the forest.</p><p>Beyond the mist.</p><p>From inside the forest far away, something black comes straight for us.</p><hr><p>\u2015\u2015Hold on. I&#39;ll be there to kill you soon\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>...Is it because we&#39;re in a clearing under the open sky?</p><p>I feel like Illya is talking to us while looking down from the sky.</p><hr><p>&quot;Crap, she found Shirou already...!?</p><p>This is bad, this place is too open... whoa, how fast are they going!? It won&#39;t take them even two minutes to get here...!&quot;</p><p>Tohsaka is flustered.</p><hr><p>&quot;Hey, why are you two so relaxed...!?</p><p>I&#39;m telling you this place is bad! We have to go somewhere else...!&quot;</p><p>Tohsaka takes my hand.</p><p>\u2015\u2015But we won&#39;t make it.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015This place is fine. Let&#39;s fight here, Tohsaka.</p><p>We&#39;re lucky just to be able to fight with the three of us together, so we can&#39;t wish for more.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Idiot, I&#39;m telling you that&#39;s no good...! There&#39;s too much space here...! Saber can&#39;t stop Berserker by herself, and you&#39;ll be in his range no matter how far away you are...!&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;I know you&#39;re worried about me, but everyone&#39;s in danger now. And besides, there&#39;s no escape now, right?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Ugh... that&#39;s true, but...&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;It&#39;s fine with you too, right Saber? We&#39;ll take Berserker on here.&quot;</p><p>Saber nods quietly.</p><p>&quot;G-Geez...! Fine. I&#39;ll be pissed if you die too easily...!&quot;</p><hr><p>She must have agreed as she disappears into the fog.</p><p>Once she goes into action, she&#39;s super fast.</p><p>She gets away from the clearing and goes up a tree in the forest.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015They&#39;re coming, Saber. Are you ready?&quot;</p><p>&quot;...You too. Please do not come any closer than you are now once the fight starts. I will not let Berserker near you, no matter what.&quot;</p><hr><p>Saber answers in a quiet voice.</p><p>...The fog flickers.</p><p>From the morning fog...</p><p>As if a black darkness is seeping out, the mad warrior appears along with a white girl.</p><hr><p>&quot;I&#39;m surprised. I thought you&#39;d keep running until the very last second. Or have you given up already, Onii-chan?&quot;</p><p>...There&#39;s about forty meters between us and Illya.</p><p>We&#39;re facing each other on opposite ends of the clearing.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Oh, so Saber&#39;s recovered. I see, that&#39;s why you stopped running.</p><p>...That&#39;s disappointing. It&#39;s cute that you think you can win just because of that, but\u2015\u2015</p><p>\u2015\u2015I&#39;m sorry, Shirou&#39;s going to die here.&quot;</p><hr><p>Her laughter echoes through the forest.</p><p>Does it irritate her?</p><p>Saber, standing beside me, is so worked up that she could attack at any moment.</p><hr><p>&quot;Geez. This is boring since you&#39;ve gotten so quiet. Are you scared of dying? That&#39;s a waste. If you beg for your lives now, I might consider forgiving you.&quot;</p><hr><p>...Tohsaka must have finished climbing the tree.</p><p>If she&#39;s going to place herself, it will be near the center of the clearing.</p><p>Nobody would notice if she was right where the branches are overlapping, and they should be strong enough to support her as well.</p><hr><p>&quot;...I see, so that&#39;s how you&#39;re acting. Then I guess there&#39;s no more point in talking. I&#39;ll kill you two and Rin\u2015\u2015</p><p>\u2015\u2015Hold on. Where&#39;s Rin, Shirou?&quot;</p><hr><p>Illya&#39;s tone changes.</p><p>...I guess that&#39;s what you expect from Berserker&#39;s Master.</p><p>She has a complete understanding of what can be overlooked and what can&#39;t be.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015Tohsaka isn&#39;t here. She left us behind a long time ago.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;You guys went your separate ways? Oh yeah, you two would just be a burden to her. She should be able to run away faster by herself.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...That&#39;s right. Knowing her, she should be out of the forest by now. You won&#39;t make it even if you go after her now.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015Is that so? This forest is Einzbern&#39;s boundary field.</p><p>I can tell who enters and who leaves. No one has left the forest since then. Rin is still in the forest, so I can look for her later.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>...Thank God.</p><p>If Illya can only sense the boundaries of the forest, she doesn&#39;t know about Tohsaka yet.</p><p>Actually, she completely believed what I said.</p><p>...Illya is certainly a cold-hearted Master.</p><p>But still\u2015\u2015can&#39;t that cold-heartedness still be recovered?</p><hr><p>&quot;...Illya, I&#39;ll ask one more time before we fight.</p><p>Won&#39;t you stop being a Master and stop this battle?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;I can&#39;t. It&#39;s my grandfather&#39;s command.</p><p>As long as I have Berserker, I&#39;m the Master of Einzbern. I have to kill other Masters and bring back the Holy Grail.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...And besides, I&#39;m the one that should be asking you.</p><p>I&#39;m the head of Einzbern, so I won&#39;t repeat my words... but I can still listen if you&#39;re going to give me a different reply...?&quot;</p><hr><p>...She has a little hope in her voice.</p><p>But as long as Saber is beside me, I can&#39;t nod to her words.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015My answer won&#39;t change. I&#39;m Saber&#39;s Master.</p><p>If you won&#39;t stop being a Master, I&#39;ll defeat Berserker and make you quit.&quot;</p><p>I declare so while looking at Illya and Berserker.</p><p>In that instant.</p><p>The air in the clearing freezes.</p><hr><p>&quot;...I see. Then I&#39;ll really kill you.</p><p>I&#39;ll disintegrate you and your conceited thoughts, Shirou...!&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Wha\u2015\u2015?&quot;</p><p>...What is that?</p><p>A pattern is appearing on her face.</p><p>\u2015\u2015No, it&#39;s not just her face.</p><p>That thing is all over her body\u2015\u2015it&#39;s a huge Command Spell, incomparable to the ones we have.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015No more playing around.

Good morning, Onii-chan. How are you feeling?&quot;</p><p>Illya is acting totally different from before.</p><p>Her cold eyes are gone and the Illya before me is the white girl who was talking to me in that park the other day.</p><hr><p>&quot;Hm? What&#39;s wrong? You don&#39;t seem energetic. Does your body still not move? ...That&#39;s odd, you should be able to talk by now.&quot;</p><p>She looks at me, tilting her head.</p><p>...It looks like she&#39;s just worried about me.</p><hr><p>&quot;...I&#39;m fine. I can talk and my head&#39;s clear enough to know that I&#39;ve been captured.&quot;</p><p>I glare at Illya.</p><hr><p>&quot;What, are you dissatisfied? We usually put our captured enemies in the dungeon.</p><p>But I felt bad about doing that to you, so I brought you into my room as a special exception.&quot;</p><p>Illya looks displeased.</p><p>I don&#39;t know if I should be thankful or not.</p><p>...But anyway, I&#39;m starting to understand the situation I&#39;m in.</p><hr><p>&quot;...I get the situation. I&#39;m captured and this is your place, right?&quot;</p><p>I say so sharply, killing my emotions.</p><p>As long as I don&#39;t know the full details of the situation, I should listen for now.</p><hr><p>&quot;That&#39;s right. I told you before that I live in a castle in the forest.</p><hr><p>&quot;This is a castle in a big forest, and there&#39;s nothing around here. It takes a few hours by car to get to the town you live in. Nobody will come to save you, nor will there be any nuisances.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015I see.</p><p>I get that, but why did you do it?</p><p>If you wanted to kill me, you could have done so at the park.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Why? I don&#39;t intend to kill you, Shirou. You&#39;re mine. I&#39;ll kill the other Masters, but you&#39;re special.</p><p>That&#39;s why I locked you up here, so there won&#39;t be any interruptions.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015!&quot;</p><p>I automatically lean back.</p><p>Illya puts her face close to mine as if not caring about my feelings.</p><hr><p>&quot;H-Hey, Illya...!&quot;</p><p>I know it&#39;s indiscreet, but my heart&#39;s beating fast from the weight of Illya on my legs.</p><p>Even though she&#39;s not heavy, she feels so alive that I can&#39;t think straight\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>&quot;Yeah, like I thought, Shirou is special.</p><p>...Hey, do you want to become my Servant? If you&#39;re going to be my Servant, I won&#39;t have to kill you. All you have to do is nod, and I can spare you.&quot;</p><hr><p>She says so in a fawning voice.</p><p>This is nothing half-hearted.</p><p>Illya&#39;s words are so pure that I won&#39;t be able to take it back if I nod.</p><p>...And if I do betray her, all her purity would probably turn into hatred.</p><hr><p>With Illya so close to me, my confused mind freezes.</p><p>This isn&#39;t just that she likes me.</p><p>Illya&#39;s question is asking me if I want to live or die.</p><hr><p>&quot;You don&#39;t even need to think about it, right? You don&#39;t have Saber already. You don&#39;t have any way to fight.</p><p>So it&#39;ll be useless to stay as a Master now.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015No. Saber hasn&#39;t disappeared yet. I won&#39;t let that happen.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh yeah? But she&#39;ll be killed easily in her condition.</p><p>It&#39;s fine, you can just stay here. If you&#39;re going to stay here forever, I&#39;ll protect you forever too.&quot;</p><hr><p>Illya snuggles up to me.</p><p>I don&#39;t even have the freedom to push her away.</p><p>...I don&#39;t know what will happen if I disobey her.</p><p>But I still can&#39;t nod to Illya&#39;s words.</p><hr><p>&quot;...I can&#39;t. Get off of me, Illya. No matter what you say, I...&quot;</p><p>Illya puts her finger up to my mouth.</p><p>The girl smiles and looks up at my bewildered face.</p><hr><p>&quot;Geez, you don&#39;t get it, do you?</p><p>Look, you&#39;re just a bird in a cage right now. It&#39;s my decision if you live or not, so you shouldn&#39;t say anything to make me mad.</p><p>...I&#39;ve waited for 10 years. It&#39;s too boring just to kill you here, right?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Wha\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015?&quot;</p><p>Her voice sounds like a girl who wants a toy.</p><p>I gasp, sensing a cruelty that sends a chill up my spine.</p><hr><p>&quot;This is your last chance, Onii-chan. I&#39;ll ask you one more time.&quot;</p><p>She looks up at me, full of hope.</p><p>&quot;Shirou\u2015\u2015be mine.&quot;</p><p>Illya says so as if allowing no refusal.</p><hr><h2 id="scene-17" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#scene-17" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Scene 17</h2><p>&quot;I-I should be asking that! What were you doing?</p><p>I told you so many times not to go off by yourself, yet you were so easily captured by Illyasviel and taken to a place like this...!&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;You&#39;re disqualified as a Master. I shall not be satisfied unless you apologize to me in some way.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Ugh... I was certainly careless. But why are you here?</p><p>You can&#39;t move properly, right? What are you thinking coming to Illya&#39;s castle in that state!?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;No, what are you thinking?</p><p>A Servant&#39;s role is to protect its Master. You have been captured, so it does not matter if this is Illyasviel&#39;s castle.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>Saber speaks clearly.</p><p>...Her figure is just as it was before.</p><p>It&#39;s different from the figure sleeping, weak and in pain.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Shirou? Why are you silent all of a sudden? Did you suffer any wounds while you were held captive...!?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh... no, that&#39;s not it. I&#39;m fine. More than that, I&#39;m glad you look well.&quot;</p><hr><p>...I really regained my peace of mind.</p><p>I&#39;m surprised Saber&#39;s here, but I&#39;m happy she&#39;s back to normal.</p><p>It&#39;s just selfish prejudice.</p><p>But I think Saber is meant to act like this.</p><hr><p>&quot;...I&#39;m sorry, Saber. I don&#39;t quite understand, but you came to save me, right?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Uh... yes. It is only natural for a Servant to save her Master.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Thank you. You&#39;re a godsend.&quot;</p><hr><p>\u2015\u2015I&#39;m glad.</p><p>There&#39;s no problem now.</p><p>All that&#39;s left is to escape with Saber and\u2015\u2015</p><p>...Hey.</p><p>Why can I see Tohsaka...?</p><hr><p>&quot;T-Tohsaka...?&quot;</p><p>Ummm.</p><p>Is she really, seriously there?</p><hr><p>&quot;You seem to be doing better than I expected. Maybe there was no need for us come, huh?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;That is what I said, Rin. You should have left Emiya Shirou be.</p><p>This kind of a man causes trouble for the people around him and survives. This was a good opportunity. He would have died if you had abandoned him.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...That is inexcusable, Archer.</p><p>I am the one that asked for help, but you do not have the right to insult Shirou.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015Heh, so you act like that now that your Master is safe, huh? The Master&#39;s like this, and the Servant&#39;s the same. I guess you have no respect for your allies.</p><p>...Well, we are to fight eventually. It will be easier to fight then if no feelings are held.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;......&quot;</p><p>Saber falls silent as if he hit a sore spot.</p><p>...This guy... does he not get along with Saber either?</p><hr><p>&quot;That&#39;s it. You still remember the situation we&#39;re in, right?</p><p>We don&#39;t have time to stand around chatting. We have to retreat before Illyasviel gets back.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...? Hold on a second.</p><p>Did you guys come here knowing this place is Illya&#39;s castle? No, first of all\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>Illya went out intending to kill them.</p><p>Then.... does that mean Illya and Tohsaka missed each other?</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015That&#39;s okay. I think Illya&#39;s heading to my place now. If you guys didn&#39;t come here, I think you would have ended up fighting her.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Yes, it seems so. I confirmed Illya and Berserker leaving. ...Well, we wouldn&#39;t have come in like this if it wasn&#39;t for that.&quot;</p><hr><p>...I see. Tohsaka took such drastic measures because she knew Illya went outside.</p><p>She&#39;s as direct as ever, but that turned out for the best this time.</p><hr><p>&quot;Anyways, we&#39;ll talk later. I came prepared when I realized this was Einzbern&#39;s base, but it&#39;d be great if we don&#39;t have to meet them.</p><p>We can&#39;t match Berserker anyway with Saber in that state.&quot;</p><p>Tohsaka steps between me and Saber.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Tohsaka. What do you mean by Saber&#39;s state?</p><p>She looks fine and she&#39;s just like normal.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Hey now. Convenient things like that never happen.</p><p>Saber hasn&#39;t healed at all. Can&#39;t you tell just by looking that she&#39;s barely even standing?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Rin...! I thought you promised not to talk about that...!&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Sorry, I&#39;m going back on that. It&#39;s bad to hide it, and it&#39;s not something we could keep from him anyway.&quot;</p><p>&quot;...That is true, but\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>Saber hesitates painfully.</p><p>That makes me realize that her condition has not improved at all.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015Saber. Is that true?&quot;</p><p>&quot;...Yes. What Rin says is true. It is embarrassing, but I cannot fight as Saber right now. All I will be able to do is to be your shield.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Huh, that&#39;s what I thought. You wouldn&#39;t listen and you wanted to come with us when you can&#39;t even arm yourself.</p><p>I bet she intended to protect her Master instead of fighting.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Wha\u2015\u2015?&quot;</p><p>My breathing stops.</p><p>What is that?</p><p>She&#39;s so weak she can&#39;t arm herself?</p><p>What ridiculous things is she saying about being my shield?</p><hr><p>&quot;...I am sorry, Shirou. I know I am a failure as a Servant with a body like this. But I am able to act as a shield. I am sure you are dissatisfied, but please accept that for now\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><hr><p>\u2015\u2015That&#39;s it!</p><p>Why do you always think such stupid things\u2015\u2015!?</p><hr><p>&quot;Don&#39;t kid me, of course I&#39;m not satisfied...!</p><p>Tohsaka, why did you bring Saber!?</p><p>Don&#39;t you know Saber&#39;s more important than me...!?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;W-What? I objected too! But Saber didn&#39;t listen, and only Saber knew where you were anyway. I knew it was dangerous, but I still needed Saber!&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;But still\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>I start to yell that she shouldn&#39;t have brought her, but I stop myself.</p><p>...I&#39;m in no position to criticize Tohsaka.</p><p>The root of all this was me getting captured.</p><p>Tohsaka and Saber just did what they thought was right.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Disputes are good, but you should stop for now, Rin.</p><p>A Master will be sensitive to changes in her dwelling. We do not have time to explain things in a leisurely fashion.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...You&#39;re right. Illyasviel should be hurrying back by now.</p><p>\u2015\u2015All right. We&#39;ll leave the conversation until later. We have to get out of this castle first. That&#39;s okay, right Shirou?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Shirou, we should...&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015Well, but...&quot;</p><p>If Saber is like she was last night, isn&#39;t it difficult for her to even walk?</p><p>I can&#39;t let Saber push herself if she&#39;s in that state.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Honestly. It seems you take me too lightly.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Huh, Saber...?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Even though my magical energy is depleted, I can fight better than you, Shirou. To me, you seem to be the one about to disappear.</p><p>...I do not think Rin has noticed, but your magical energy is disrupted, correct?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh... no, this isn&#39;t anything serious. It&#39;s fine if I bear with it.</p><p>I&#39;m, uh\u2015\u2015fine, really.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Then I am the same as well. It is painful, but it is not unbearable.</p><p>I believe things are going too fast for you to grasp the situation, but let us follow Rin for now. If we are to talk, we can do so once we get home.&quot;</p><p>Saber urges me forward.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>...Geez.</p><p>I can&#39;t even worry if she says so with such an expression.</p><hr><p>&quot;...You&#39;re right. I have a lot to talk about, but I&#39;ll leave it until we get home safely.&quot;</p><p>...Yes, about Saber&#39;s body, and thanking her for coming to save me.</p><p>\u2015\u2015That dream is not something I should ask her about right now.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015All right. Let&#39;s go, Saber.&quot;</p><p>Nodding, I move my body earnestly.</p><hr><p>...I sweat with each step, but I can&#39;t complain.</p><p>Saber came all the way here with her weakened body.</p><p>So as a man, I can&#39;t show weakness now\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Wow.&quot;</p><p>As soon as we leave the room, I gasp.</p><p>Is this... a hallway?</p><p>From this museum-like hallway, I guess the building is really big.</p><hr><p>&quot;Hey, this is no time to be fascinated. Even if we leave the castle, there&#39;s a big forest outside. If we don&#39;t hurry, it&#39;ll be morning.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;A big forest\u2015\u2015? Then is this place really on a mountain? That forest a few hours drive away from Fukuyama?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Yeah, this is Einzbern&#39;s secret castle.</p><p>Even if we get out of this castle, we&#39;ll have to spend a few hours getting out of the forest. It&#39;s night now, so we&#39;ll make our way out by the morning.&quot;</p><hr><p>Tohsaka runs down the hallway without hesitation.</p><p>I guess she&#39;s heading to the back entrance she snuck in through.</p><hr><p>&quot;...I knew it was night already, but... how long was I captured for?&quot;</p><p>I thought it was only half a day, but it might have been longer.</p><hr><p>&quot;You were captured by Illyasviel this morning. It has been half a day since then.</p><p>...The date has changed, so that means you have been captured for a day now.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Ugh... I see. I&#39;m ashamed.&quot;</p><p>&quot;No, please do not be. You were safe even though you have been captured by Illyasviel for so long. That must be proof that your mind did not give in, even though your body was held captive.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015That might be true.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes. Illyasviel looks like a young girl, but she is a magus of Einzbern. If you were to yield to her, you would not have been yourself.</p><hr><p>&quot;...It is not like I did not consider that possibility. I came to this castle prepared to find you dead in the worst case.&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;So I am glad I am able to see you again.</p><p>Since my Master is safe, I cannot lose either.&quot;</p><hr><p>...Saber says so with a faint smile.</p><p>I feel the same way.</p><p>I was so worried, wondering whether Saber was all right.</p><hr><p>&quot;Hey, are you really trying to escape!?</p><p>I&#39;ll go on ahead if you&#39;re too slow...!!&quot;</p><p>Tohsaka yells at us from the corner ahead.</p><hr><p>&quot;Gah, this is no time to be talking. Let&#39;s hurry, Saber.&quot;</p><p>I run, urging Saber on as well.</p><p>...!</p><p>Every step brings unpleasantness and pain as if boiling water is pouring into my veins.</p><p>But I can run if I grit my teeth.</p><hr><p>Forcing my aching body to move, I follow Tohsaka.</p><p>Saber is running behind me as if escorting a sick person.</p><p>...She must be in pain.</p><p>She&#39;s acting firm, but Saber&#39;s in no condition to move properly.</p><hr><p>&quot;Saber, if you&#39;re in pain\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>I stop myself from asking her if she needs a hand.</p><p>If I said that, Saber would stubbornly try to run on her own.</p><hr><p>I should just watch for now.</p><p>If Saber looks tired enough that she can&#39;t make excuses, I can carry her then.</p><p>...Saber is really troublesome.</p><p>This stubborn girl won&#39;t rest unless I do something that forceful.</p><hr><p>\u2015\u2015And so.</p><p>Following Tohsaka&#39;s lead, we reach the exit of the castle.</p><hr><p>&quot;This is the main entrance, Tohsaka\u2015\u2015!?&quot;</p><p>&quot;...? Why are you saying something so obvious? This is what entrances are for, right? This is the fastest way if you want to go out or come in.&quot;</p><p>Tohsaka runs down the stairs.</p><hr><p>&quot;......&quot;</p><p>...Well, I&#39;m in no position to complain.</p><p>Saber and I descend the stairs into the hall.</p><p>I guess this is the lobby.</p><p>So that must mean we&#39;ll be outside if we go through that large door at the end.</p><hr><p>&quot;All right, we&#39;re doing well to have gotten this far. The problems come after we get into the forest, but it&#39;s night and all, so maybe we&#39;ll be able to get out to the main road under cover of darkness.</p><p>It&#39;ll be too late when Illyasviel comes back and finds out you&#39;re not here anymore.</p><p>It&#39;ll be morning by the time she gets back.... Hey, why that unsatisfied look on your face?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...No, it&#39;s nothing. I was just realizing again that you&#39;re a big shot.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...? You realize the weirdest things in the weirdest places.&quot;</p><p>...Like, entering the enemy&#39;s base from the main entrance and the way she&#39;s acting so confidently.</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh well. Let&#39;s go outside. I remember the way back, so we won&#39;t get lost.&quot;</p><hr><p>We head for the entrance.</p><p>A long hall stretches from the lobby and a large door can be seen on the end.</p><p>It&#39;s amazing, the hall is about 30 meters long.</p><p>...I think to myself that this place really is a castle. And the instant I start to walk...</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015Oh, you&#39;re going home already? That&#39;s too bad, after you came so far.&quot;</p><hr><p>The voice of the girl who shouldn&#39;t be here echoes through the room with a faint laugh.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015!&quot;</p><p>I turn around instantly.</p><p>Everybody stops.</p><p>The instant I turn around and see the &quot;enemy&quot;, I understand that I will be killed if I turn my back on it again.</p><hr><p>&quot;Illya... sviel\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>Tohsaka&#39;s voice is shaking.</p><p>Across the hall.</p><p>On the stairs we came down is something that should not be there.</p><hr><p>\u2015\u2015It&#39;s strangely like the time before.</p><p>Illya is standing above us with Berserker standing behind her.</p><p>Berserker&#39;s presence is overwhelming.</p><p>As I can feel the Servant&#39;s strength now, I can understand how much of a monster he is.</p><p>....How absurd.</p><p>He&#39;s not at a level Saber could match even in her normal condition.</p><hr><p>...It probably wouldn&#39;t even be a fight.</p><p>That thing is not something that can be beaten in battle.</p><p>Defeating Berserker means eliminating it without fighting it.</p><p>In other words.</p><p>We should have avoided him if we didn&#39;t want to die.</p><hr><p>&quot;Good evening. I&#39;m happy you have come to see me, Rin.&quot;</p><p>Illya&#39;s voice is cheerful.</p><p>That smile is the same as it was eight days ago. Innocent and merciless emotion that will kill any insects she catches.</p><hr><p>\u2015\u2015I understand now.</p><p>We won&#39;t be able to get away.</p><p>I can&#39;t stop Illya no matter what I do.</p><p>Even if I can get Illya&#39;s attention, that doesn&#39;t mean everyone else can get away.</p><hr><p>&quot;What&#39;s wrong? It&#39;s boring if you don&#39;t talk. I&#39;m giving you some time, so I think it would be best if you at least leave behind a will.&quot;</p><hr><p>She giggles.</p><p>...But we don&#39;t have such composure.</p><p>We will run for the entrance if there is an opening.</p><p>Even though we know there will be no such chance, we can only wait for it.</p><hr><p>&quot;...I see. Then let me ask you one thing.&quot;</p><p>But still.</p><p>Tohsaka takes a step toward Illya.</p><hr><p>&quot;Illyasviel. I didn&#39;t feel you coming back, so were you actually hiding all this time?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;That&#39;s right. I didn&#39;t go anywhere. I was just watching you make a fool of yourselves.&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015I see. Does that mean the one who went out was a fake?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Yes. I knew you people were coming, after all.</p><p>I&#39;m the master here, so I have to welcome the guests, right?&quot;</p><hr><p>The giant figure suddenly disappears.</p><p>I don&#39;t know if it jumped or just moved there.</p><p>Berserker appears in the middle of the lobby with a whirlwind.</p><hr><p>...We&#39;re done for now.</p><p>If we retreat, we&#39;ll be slashed in half the instant we turn our backs.</p><p>But we&#39;ll be killed as well if we stay like this.</p><p>The only path left is to challenge that mass of death, knowing it&#39;ll be pointless.</p><hr><p>&quot;Are you done talking now? Then let&#39;s begin, Berserker.&quot;</p><p>The girl raises her hand as if performing some kind of a ritual, looks down at us, and...</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015I swear. I will not let anyone go today.&quot;</p><p>...She declares so with delight and murderous intent.</p><hr><p>Light shines in Berserker&#39;s eyes.</p><p>...The Servant that has obeyed Illya up to now has his mind released and identifies us as his enemies.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>A gritting sound.</p><p>&quot;...Tohsaka...?&quot;</p><p>Tohsaka grits her teeth hard as if regretting something.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Archer, can you hear me?&quot;</p><p>She murmurs in a quiet voice without turning around.</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015A little while is enough. Keep him busy by yourself.&quot;</p><p>She orders her Servant to die.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>Archer does not answer.</p><p>&quot;Ridiculous...! Are you insane, Rin? Archer is no match for Berserker by himself...!&quot;</p><p>&quot;We&#39;ll run while you do that. Archer, buy us time until we escape.&quot;</p><hr><p>Ignoring Saber, Tohsaka continues her instructions.</p><p>Her voice is cold, killing her emotions.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>Archer, who has been silent as if pondering something, quietly nods and...</p><p>&quot;That is a smart move. I will be able to escape if you escape first.</p><p>Independent action is a specialty of Archers after all.&quot;</p><p>...Takes a step forward as if to protect Tohsaka.</p><hr><p>Berserker does not move.</p><p>Only Illya&#39;s laughter can be heard from above.</p><hr><p>&quot;Wow, I&#39;m surprised. You&#39;re saying such an unknown Servant is going to stop my Hercules?</p><p>Wow, you have a cute side to you, Rin.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>Neither Tohsaka nor Archer has the composure for a rebuttal.</p><p>Tohsaka and Archer know that fact better than anyone.</p><hr><p>Archer steps forward.</p><p>He is empty-handed as usual.</p><hr><p>&quot;......&quot;</p><p>Tohsaka is watching Archer&#39;s back.</p><p>...She must not have anything to say to him.</p><p>Tohsaka should know her command is unreasonable.</p><p>Because she told her Servant to die so that we can escape.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Archer, I-&quot;</p><p>Tohsaka starts to say something.</p><p>But...</p><p>&quot;By the way, Rin. May I confirm one thing?&quot;</p><p>...Archer interrupts her words in a cool voice unsuited to the situation.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Fine. What?&quot;</p><p>Tohsaka looks at Archer with a downcast look.</p><p>Still looking at Berserker...</p><hr><p>&quot;Yeah. Buying you some time is fine, but\u2015\u2015[r]</p><p>;// You won&#39;t mind if I beat that thing, right?&quot;</p><p>...Archer says something unexpected.</p><hr><p>&quot;Archer\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015Yeah, you don&#39;t need to hold back.</p><p>Give him a beating, Archer!&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;I see. Then I shall meet your expectations.&quot;</p><p>Archer moves forward.</p><p>There are only ten meters between him and Berserker.</p><p>That thing should be able to close that distance in an instant.</p><hr><p>&quot;...!! You&#39;re underestimating me...! Fine, go on Berserker! You can slash that stuck up guy into pieces...!&quot;</p><p>Illya speaks in a hysterical voice.</p><p>Tohsaka turns her back, not paying attention.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015We&#39;ll be going. Getting outside means victory for us.&quot;</p><p>Tohsaka starts to run, taking both Saber and my hands.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>Saber follows Tohsaka without objection.</p><p>...I start to run to the entrance, leaving Archer behind.</p><p>But from behind me...</p><p>&quot;Emiya Shirou.&quot;</p><p>He stops me, still with his back to me.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>I turn around, letting go of Tohsaka&#39;s hand.</p><p>In the lobby, now far away, is the back of the man facing Berserker.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015Understand. You are a maker, not a fighter.&quot;</p><p>Berserker charges.</p><p>Archer stares at his enemy without backing off, still empty-handed.</p><hr><p>&quot;Do not think about other things. There is only one thing you can do. So master that one thing.&quot;</p><p>Archer raises his hand.</p><p>I don&#39;t know when he got it, but in his hand is that shortsword.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015Do not forget. What you must imagine is always that you yourself are the strongest. You do not need outside enemies. For you, the one you have to fight is none other than your own image.&quot;</p><p>The red back sinks.</p><p>Berserker&#39;s attack rages.</p><hr><p>Tohsaka and Saber are already at the entrance.</p><p>\u2015\u2015I run without turning around.</p><p>The red back tells me to just go.</p><hr><h2 id="scene-18-warning-h" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#scene-18-warning-h" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Scene 18 [WARNING: H]</h2><p>Once we pass between the exceptionally tall trees, an unexpected sight appears before me.</p><hr><p>&quot;...A ruin...?&quot;</p><p>Holding Saber, I look at the building with blank amazement.</p><p>I don&#39;t know why, but this building in the woods is now a desolate ruin.</p><hr><p>&quot;We should be able to hide here for a while.</p><p>Archer found this as a place to hide on our way here.&quot;</p><p>I don&#39;t know what kind of nerves she has, but Tohsaka enters the ruin.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Well, I guess it won&#39;t crumble any more than it already has.&quot;</p><p>I head towards the entrance stepping over the rubble.</p><p>...How long has it been since it was abandoned?</p><p>The building seems like a corpse desecrated by the forest.</p><hr><p>\u2015\u2015The entire ground floor is taken over by trees.</p><p>The only usable rooms are on the second floor, and this is the best of those.</p><p>Miraculously, the windows are still intact.</p><p>I don&#39;t know how, but I can see the night sky from here.</p><hr><p>&quot;Hmm. It&#39;s pretty clean in here. Maybe someone was staying here until recently.&quot;</p><hr><p>...Really, what kind of nerves does she have?</p><p>Stepping over the rubble, Tohsaka is dusting off the bed by the window.</p><hr><p>&quot;Shirou, this way. We have to lie Saber down.</p><p>It&#39;s pretty tiring being held by someone.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh\u2015\u2015yeah, I&#39;ll be right there.&quot;</p><p>I carefully make my way over to the bed and lay Saber down.</p><hr><p>&quot;How are you feeling, Saber? Can you still move okay?&quot;</p><p>&quot;...Yes, since Shirou carried me here.</p><p>It seems I can still sustain my body.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015I see. Then I guess there&#39;s only one problem left.</p><p>It&#39;s been an hour. We should have a bit more time even if Illyasviel comes after us immediately.</p><p>...No, we might be able to hide here until morning if they have trouble finding us.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>Her mumbling reminds me.</p><p>We were able to make it to this ruin, but what happened to Berserker and Archer?</p><p>He remained at the castle to keep Berserker there.</p><p>It&#39;s already been more than an hour.</p><p>So Archer should already have retreated as well\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>&quot;Tohsaka, what happened to him\u2015\u2015?&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>Tohsaka doesn&#39;t answer.</p><p>She just places her right hand on her chest as if holding something dear.</p><p>...That tells me of Archer&#39;s fate.</p><hr><p>Tohsaka&#39;s Command Spell is on her right hand.</p><p>The Master and the Servant are connected.</p><p>As Saber sensed my danger, if the Master can sense the life and death of their Servant...</p><hr><p>&quot;...Tohsaka, he...&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yeah. And I told him he just needed to buy us some time.</p><p>He\u2015\u2015was arrogant to the very end.&quot;</p><p>Tohsaka murmurs as if laughing off a bad rumor.</p><hr><p>...Silence follows.</p><p>The silence that seems to last forever is...</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015But I won&#39;t let it be meaningless. Since I&#39;ve lost Archer, I&#39;ll get Berserker here.&quot;</p><p>...Aborted by the sound of Tohsaka punching her left hand with her right.</p><hr><p>&quot;Mourning is over. I believe in acting if I have time to worry. Since it&#39;s come this far, I&#39;m going to make sure you&#39;re resolved as well.&quot;</p><p>&quot;...? Resolved? For what?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Resolved to beat Illyasviel... Berserker, of course.&quot;</p><p>We can&#39;t escape this forest with Saber, and it&#39;s going to take a long time even if we are to heal her. Illya will catch us either way.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Do you get it? For us to escape the forest with all three of us, we have to defeat Berserker.</p><p>If we can&#39;t, we&#39;ll just share Archer&#39;s fate.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015Beat Berserker...?&quot;</p><p>That monster?</p><p>Beat that whirlwind of death that nullifies every attack and destroys all that it touches in a single blow...?</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>I can&#39;t even imagine that.</p><p>Anything that fights him will die.</p><p>Tohsaka must know that as well.</p><p>Is she saying we&#39;ll beat it in spite of that?</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015No, that&#39;s not right.&quot;</p><p>What am I saying?</p><p>Tohsaka isn&#39;t saying we can beat it.</p><p>She has no such false hopes.</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh\u2015\u2015I see...&quot;</p><p>That&#39;s right. We&#39;re not going to beat him to win.</p><p>...I should have realized that immediately.</p><p>&quot;Our only option is to beat him.&quot;</p><p>It&#39;s just that.</p><p>If we don&#39;t want to die here...</p><p>We have to beat that monster.</p><hr><p>&quot;That&#39;s right. But it&#39;s not that hopeless.</p><p>Even if it&#39;s Berserker, he should be wounded after fighting Archer. And I have all my reserve jewels, so if Saber recovers, I can come up with a few plans to beat him.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015Looking at it from the other side,</p><p>Since Berserker is wounded right now, don&#39;t you think this is our best chance to beat Illyasviel?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...That may be true.</p><p>But is there a way to heal Saber? ...I hate to say it, but I don&#39;t think there&#39;s any way to heal Saber here.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;No, the location doesn&#39;t matter for Saber&#39;s treatment.</p><p>Saber is just weakened by lack of magical energy. If we replenish her stocks, she should be able to use her abilities like before.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Hey now, Tohsaka. Have you forgotten? The problem is, I can&#39;t do that kind of magical energy replenishment.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;There is a way. Yesterday... it&#39;s the day before now, but I explained to you then.</p><p>There is one more method other than the sharing magecraft to give magical energy to your Servant.</p><p>Back then... well, I didn&#39;t say anything because I didn&#39;t think it would end up like this.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Hm\u2015\u2015?&quot;</p><p>I recall the conversation yesterday.</p><p>She certainly did say\u2015\u2015</p><p>&quot;...Well, a path should have been formed at summoning, so there may be other measures\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>...Something like that.</p><hr><p>&quot;...I remember. Something about there being another way since a path exists...&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Yes. You and Saber have not only a spiritually connected path, but also a physical path. So there&#39;s no need to use difficult magecraft to give her magical energy. All you have to do is to give her energy.&quot;</p><p>...?</p><p>But, I don&#39;t know of any way to do that.</p><hr><p>&quot;Hold on. You say the Master gives energy, but how do I do that?&quot;</p><p>Tohsaka looks at me in surprise.</p><hr><p>She stares at me for a while, and then tells me it&#39;s simple.</p><p>&quot;Sleep with her. Saber&#39;s a girl fortunately, so it should be easy, right?&quot;</p><p>She says lightly.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015What?&quot;</p><p>Sleep with her... that, um... means...</p><p>Because, since Saber&#39;s a girl, it should be easy?</p><hr><p>&quot;WHA, WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT!!??&quot;</p><p>H-H-H-H-Hold on, w-w-w-why are we going this way all of a sudden!!!!?</p><hr><p>&quot;What are you so surprised about? Unison from sex is standard procedure. The semen of a magus is a cluster of magical energy. Don&#39;t you know that poor magi sell their semen to the Association?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;I-I-I didn&#39;t know that...! T-T-Tantrism is a heresy, and the Baphomet is just superstition! I won&#39;t fall for such cajolery!&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...Hey now. Tantrism is a genuine secret rite, and the Baphomet is a standard contractor.</p><p>I don&#39;t know what you&#39;re panicking about, but you said you were prepared earlier.</p><p>This is the only way we can survive, so don&#39;t give us too much trouble.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Well, but, that&#39;s...&quot;</p><p>It&#39;s not something that can be solved that easily...!</p><hr><p>&quot;Geez, we don&#39;t have time to be arguing!</p><p>Archer was defeated, so Illyasviel will be here soon. We need to heal Saber if we&#39;re going to survive.</p><p>You know we need all three of us to match Berserker, right!?</p><p>So there&#39;s only one thing to do!</p><hr><p>&quot;I won&#39;t let Archer die in vain.</p><p>I will make sure we make use of the chance he gave us in place of his life. So I&#39;m going to use everything I can to survive...!&quot;</p><hr><p>Tohsaka yells at me.</p><p>But the more she says, the more confused I get. I imagine really making love to her, and my head goes even more blank.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>...Damn, my face is so hot that I know I&#39;m blushing red.</p><p>But I can&#39;t help it.</p><p>It troubles me if she suddenly says such a thing, and Saber is breathing wildly in the bed before me.</p><p>I feel like I&#39;ve wandered into another dimension and my head is mixed up\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>&quot;...! Oh, Tohsaka, that plan won&#39;t work.</p><p>Putting myself aside, Saber will definitely refuse. Saber would never give up her body just to replenish magical energy!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Really? Then why don&#39;t you ask her?&quot;</p><p>Tohsaka&#39;s attitude doesn&#39;t change.</p><hr><p>&quot;Wha\u2015\u2015?&quot;</p><p>I look over at the bed.</p><p>...Still breathing heavily, Saber is looking at us, without objecting to Tohsaka.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Saber?&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015No. I would not mind, Shirou.&quot;</p><p>...And.</p><p>Saber says so in a shy voice.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>That&#39;s a terrible betrayal.</p><p>Why does she have to say that in this situation and take away my reasoning?</p><hr><p>...If you&#39;re asking me if I want to make love to her, of course I want to.</p><p>Saber is a girl, she&#39;s beautiful beyond belief, and if I didn&#39;t see her that way, I wouldn&#39;t have kept on escaping from my room into the shed.</p><hr><p>\u2015\u2015That&#39;s why I think it&#39;s bad.</p><p>I can still feel her in my hands.</p><p>Her warm body, her sweating skin, and her light weight... all of it was in my hands until a moment ago.</p><p>If I remember that, I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll go after her body not because I want to save her, but just because I want her.</p><hr><p>&quot;What? You&#39;re so indecisive. Don&#39;t you want to have sex with her?</p><p>Oh, are you impotent?&quot;</p><p>&quot;That&#39;s not true!!!!!</p><p>It&#39;s not that, I just\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><hr><p>I feel bad for Saber, this is no time to do such things, my head is blank, and this is, um, my first time...</p><p>...I&#39;m in such a panic that I don&#39;t even notice myself grumbling out loud.</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh, then you&#39;re already fine mentally.</p><p>Well, I know how you feel, but just accept it for now.&quot;</p><p>Tohsaka steps closer to me.</p><hr><p>&quot;...!&quot;</p><p>I prepare myself, but the enemy makes an unexpected move.</p><hr><p>&quot;I&#39;m sorry, but we don&#39;t have time to slowly get you in the mood.</p><p>Shirou, hold still.&quot;</p><p>Tohsaka reaches out.</p><p>It happens in an instant.</p><p>Tohsaka grabs my face, forces me to look at her, and\u2015\u2015</p><p>Humbly kisses me.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015!!!!?&quot;</p><p>I can&#39;t breathe.</p><p>My confusion reaches its peak, and I can&#39;t think at all.</p><p>\u2015\u2015But it makes me realize that this sensation is unfair.</p><hr><p>...Tohsaka&#39;s lips are so soft.</p><p>I think it&#39;s special to feel someone else&#39;s skin on my lips.</p><p>But what I&#39;m feeling now isn&#39;t skin, but flesh on flesh.</p><p>Her lips are soft and even though I can taste them, they&#39;re just sweet.</p><p>Tohsaka might not be used to it either as our lips are just pressed together.</p><hr><p>...I clearly feel Tohsaka&#39;s body temperature.</p><p>Her breath is hot. ...Is it her saliva? Our wet lips exchange small amounts of water.</p><p>Our touching noses are tickling, and all I can do is bear it.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>...I guess this is what they mean when they say all men are animals.</p><p>My head is still blank, but already I can&#39;t put my brakes on\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>...Our lips part.</p><p>Leaving me dumbfounded, Tohsaka goes over to the bed.</p><p>&quot;Have you calmed down?&quot;</p><p>...It&#39;s contradictory.</p><p>Tohsaka&#39;s red herself, but she still speaks like that.</p><hr><p>&quot;Tohsaka, you\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>&quot;Sorry it was me.&quot;</p><p>\u2015\u2015That&#39;s ridiculous.</p><p>Why does she have to apologize? If someone needs to apologize, it&#39;s definitely me.</p><hr><p>&quot;Anyways, I have no intention of backing out now.</p><p>...You can just watch from over there. I don&#39;t think you can do it in your situation, so I&#39;ll help you out.</p><p>...So you and Saber will feel more in the mood.&quot;</p><hr><p>Tohsaka props herself up on her hands and climbs over Saber.</p><hr><p>&quot;Wha\u2015\u2015Rin, what are you doing...?&quot;</p><p>Saber sounds confused.</p><p>&quot;...I&#39;m helping. It seems you two aren&#39;t used to it, so I&#39;m going to help you both.&quot;</p><hr><p>She smiles.</p><p>...She must have forcibly turned on her own switch with that kiss.</p><p>Tohsaka starts to run her fingers over Saber in a feverish motion.</p><hr><p>&quot;Wha... wha... Tohsaka...!&quot;</p><p>She doesn&#39;t even pause.</p><p>As soon as Tohsaka lies on the bed, she touches Saber, unable to move from fever, with her fingers.</p><hr><p>&quot;Rin\u2015\u2015hold on, I...&quot;</p><p>&quot;...Just let me handle this. It&#39;ll be hard for you to do it by yourself.</p><p>It&#39;s all right. You won&#39;t be able to think about anything soon\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>Tohsaka&#39;s fingers reach Saber&#39;s chest.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Here, you have to get comfortable first. It&#39;ll just be stiff if you keep these on.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Ah\u2015\u2015yah... nn...&quot;</p><p>Is her breathing from her hesitation?</p><p>Saber looks up at Tohsaka with her feverish face.</p><p>And Tohsaka starts to turn red and breathes wildly as if Saber&#39;s fever has been transmitted to her.</p><hr><p>&quot;To\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>Tohsaka... I want to say, but my throat will not move.</p><p>...Is it because of Saber&#39;s breathing?</p><p>Tohsaka&#39;s finger movements themselves are seductive.</p><hr><p>She unties the blue ribbon and starts to undo the shirt one button at a time.</p><p>A flexible and refined movement, without hesitation.</p><p>Her fingers sequentially remove the armor from the knight, and it has a dubiousness of a ritual to expose the girl within.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Nn... ah, Rin, no more\u2015\u2015we can continue without taking any more off\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>&quot;...No, it&#39;s necessary. We&#39;re going to do that sort of thing. We have to warm your body through direct contact.&quot;</p><hr><p>Still breathing hard, Tohsaka whispers into Saber&#39;s ear.</p><p>Saber grabs onto Tohsaka as if to stop her, but she&#39;s under Tohsaka&#39;s control, so she cannot fight against her.</p><p>And as soon as the last button is unfastened.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>I desperately look away from the image before me.</p><p>...Saber&#39;s skin.</p><p>The figure that I have tried so hard not to notice is bared before me.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015!&quot;</p><p>I close my eyes.</p><p>I keep them shut with my will as they want to open by themselves.</p><p>...I&#39;ll go crazy if I open them.</p><p>Everything I&#39;ve built up with Saber will crumble.</p><p>I grit my teeth and endure my unknown urges in fear of that.</p><hr><p>&quot;Ah... nn... no Shirou... you have to look. We&#39;re going to start once Saber&#39;s ready... so you have to... feel, ah, like it too...&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015Feel like it!?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...Just open your eyes. We&#39;re accomplices.</p><p>We&#39;re going to love Saber and have Saber save us in return.</p><p>...Or are you going to just sit there and watch...?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015!&quot;</p><p>Tohsaka&#39;s point is crazy.</p><p>It&#39;s crazy, but I&#39;m contradicting myself if I keep my eyes closed.</p><p>...I have to make love to her to save her.</p><p>If I want Saber not to disappear no matter what, I have to accept this proposal.</p><hr><p>...And I have already accepted it.</p><p>Even though I have my eyes closed, I want Saber to stay, as proven by my choice of not running away.</p><p>So\u2015\u2015I can&#39;t just close my eyes and do nothing.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015Is that okay? I won&#39;t be able to hold back if I open my eyes.&quot;</p><p>&quot;...Aha. Did you hear that, Saber? Shirou&#39;s turned on just by looking at you.&quot;</p><p>She laughs.</p><p>Tohsaka looks at Saber and my red faces, and laughs.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015Yeah. But control yourself for just a bit. You have to stay there until Saber is ready. Until I tell you\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>&#39;Stay there and watch Saber.&#39;</p><p>Tohsaka says so in a more passionate voice than Saber.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>...I release a small breath.</p><p>I have to forget about everything when I open my eyes.</p><p>About Saber.</p><p>About Tohsaka.</p><p>I have to forget about the trust between us and my life with Saber, and make love to her to save her.</p><hr><p>&quot;......&quot;</p><p>I breathe deeply and clench my fists tight.</p><p>I gather all my power into my abdomen and calm my mind so I won&#39;t be perturbed by anything.</p><p>And then\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>All my protective walls are torn down in an instant.</p><hr><p>The two colors entangled in each other.</p><p>A small body lying on top of a beautiful white girl like a sculpture.</p><hr><p>&quot;Fu... ah, nn... a. ...Saber&#39;s lips are small.&quot;</p><p>Just the touching of the lips.</p><p>Tohsaka&#39;s lips fall as if tasting her.</p><hr><p>&quot;Ha... nn.... how is it, Saber? ...It&#39;s almost gone, but can you taste Shirou...?&quot;</p><p>Is she trying to say that&#39;s an indirect kiss?</p><p>Tohsaka says something that could kill me from embarrassment.</p><p>&quot;...So this is Shirou&#39;s fluid\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>And Saber drinks it with a heated voice.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Nm, ah, n... no Rin... I cannot tell... Please give me more.&quot;</p><p>Saber pulls on Tohsaka.</p><p>Tohsaka doesn&#39;t oppose it and this time\u2015\u2015they kiss each other deeply.</p><hr><p>&quot;Ha\u2015\u2015ah\u2015\u2015mm... Shirou is sweet.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yeah... mm... you&#39;re just as sweet as him too...&quot;</p><p>The red colors intertwine.</p><p>As they lick each other&#39;s tongues, the shining flesh joins.</p><hr><p>...No, that&#39;s wrong.</p><p>Saber is just being dominated by Tohsaka.</p><p>She has her tongue out and answering Tohsaka&#39;s because Tohsaka wants it.</p><p>Saber is trembling and looking in confusion at Tohsaka\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>&quot;Mm... Saber... stronger\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>Their hot breaths overlap.</p><p>Tohsaka gently feels Saber as if handling something precious.</p><hr><p>From her gently sloping chest to her navel, drawing a beautiful line of ridges.</p><p>&quot;Rin... your hand... is... on my... body\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>Her hand goes down even further and reaches the place tightly closed off.</p><hr><p>&quot;Ha... nn&quot;</p><p>Saber shakes a bit.</p><p>Tohsaka looks down at it happily.</p><p>&quot;Fu, well then... let&#39;s start, Saber.&quot;</p><p>She doesn&#39;t stop and sinks her fingers in between Saber&#39;s thighs.</p><hr><p>&quot;...! Ah\u2015\u2015no, Rin. Not there\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>&quot;...Why? What&#39;s there? I won&#39;t listen unless you tell me clearly. ...Say it clearly... loud enough so that Shirou can hear... too...!&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...!&quot;</p><p>Saber&#39;s opposition softens.</p><p>Tohsaka pushes down Saber&#39;s body with heated breaths.</p><p>&quot;...But then... I won&#39;t stop now even if you do say it.&quot;</p><p>&quot;...! Ah...! Sto-ah... R-R-Rin...!!&quot;</p><p>She sucks on Saber&#39;s lips.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Come on, cry out more. That&#39;s not enough, so Shirou and I will want to treat you wilder\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>&quot;Hm...! ...Ah, your finger is\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>...Tohsaka&#39;s body covers Saber&#39;s small body.</p><p>The two&#39;s heavy breathing echoes through the ruin.</p><p>The white flower is being violated by the red flower.</p><hr><p>&quot;Ah, nn...! No Rin, it hurts\u2015\u2015please get away for a while\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>Saber breathes in as her lips are released.</p><hr><p>Tohsaka looks down at the golden-haired girl below her and takes a deep breath.</p><p>&quot;Ah... hm... I&#39;m surprised... I didn&#39;t think I swung this way.&quot;</p><p>Then, she takes the finger resting on top of Saber&#39;s crotch and sinks it inside.</p><hr><p>&quot;...! \u2015\u2015Ah, ha\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>...Was it a soft touch?</p><p>Saber just raises her shoulders once and does not appear agitated by Tohsaka&#39;s fingers.</p><hr><p>&quot;Nn... ah, haa...&quot;</p><p>...A wet sound can be heard between her heated moans.</p><p>Sticky and slimy sounds.</p><p>Drops of the passionate juice that seems to symbolize the improper actions of two women.</p><p>It is indeed dripping from between Saber&#39;s legs.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015Nn... You are gentle, Rin\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>...Saber sounds impatient.</p><p>She looks up at Tohsaka as if saying that she is unhappy with her gentle\u2015\u2015no, her overly soft touch.</p><p>&quot;Ha... but, such consideration is unnecessary... mm...! Without your help, I...&quot;</p><p>&quot;...Are you saying you&#39;re all right...? Hm... no, you&#39;re not wet enough yet... It&#39;ll probably hurt if you take Shirou like this, Saber...&quot;</p><p>Her caress echoes through the room.</p><p>Tohsaka is loving Saber&#39;s slit as if she&#39;s masturbating.</p><hr><p>&quot;Mm... it&#39;s so warm... and it&#39;s so cute, so I&#39;ll... take care of it more.&quot;</p><p>Tohsaka sucks on Saber&#39;s lips.</p><p>Their tongues play around making noise.</p><hr><p>&quot;Hm... ah, ha, mn...! ...Haa, it is fine Rin... I am used to pain, so, um...&quot;</p><p>Saber confesses that she&#39;s scared to go wild in front of us.</p><p>But\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>&quot;...Really? But Saber... if you do it like this, Shirou will be in pain as well. We have to get it so wet that even your butt is wet.&quot;</p><p>With an evil smile, Tohsaka replies.</p><hr><p>&quot;Wha\u2015\u2015my butt\u2015\u2015?&quot;</p><p>&quot;...Oh. It&#39;s okay if you don&#39;t want to. Because it&#39;ll only be a problem for Shirou.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Eh... for Shirou...?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Of course. Yours is so tight even on my finger. If you do it like that, Shirou will certainly hate you. He&#39;ll just say it was just [wra\u0370 text=&quot;painful&quot;]painful and it didn&#39;t feel good at all.&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015!&quot;</p><p>Saber blushes not from the caress, but from embarrassment.</p><p>Tohsaka smiles and looks at her maliciously.</p><hr><p>&quot;So, what will you do? I&#39;ll stop if that&#39;s enough. It won&#39;t feel good at all, but I&#39;ll let Shirou take over.</p><p>...Come on. You don&#39;t like being touched in your vagina, so what do you want done now...?&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>Not just her face, but Saber&#39;s body heats up as well.</p><p>Shlick. Shlick.</p><p>An obscene sound comes from Tohsaka stirring inside the wet walls.</p><p>Then.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Please.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I can&#39;t hear you. Say it more clearly, Saber. I won&#39;t listen unless you request it yourself.&quot;</p><p>&quot;...! ...I will leave it to you, Rin... Please move your fingers faster\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><hr><p>\u2015\u2015Saber pleads to Tohsaka with a bright red face.</p><p>Perhaps that makes Tohsaka go crazy.</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>&quot;...!? R-Rin, ow\u2015\u2015!!&quot;</p><p>Tohsaka pushes Saber onto the bed and climbs on top of her even more roughly.</p><hr><p>&quot;Ha, nha...!&quot;</p><p>Saber&#39;s body jumps.</p><p>Trying to keep her down\u2015\u2015no, to have her jump even wilder, Tohsaka inserts her finger deeper into Saber.</p><hr><p>&quot;Wha\u2015\u2015so, deep... Rin\u2015\u2015!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Ha... of course\u2015\u2015you said I could do as I wanted\u2015\u2015!&quot;</p><hr><p>She must not even hear Saber.</p><p>Tohsaka cups Saber&#39;s breasts as if she&#39;s possessed, squeezes her soft chest, and rolls her tongue over the tip as if tasting it.</p><hr><p>&quot;Hya...!? What, what are you doing, Rin...!?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Mm\u2015\u2015Saber, you&#39;re so cute\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>An obscene and cute sound.</p><p>&quot;...Ah, nn... nn, ah... yah, ah&quot;</p><p>Still breathing hard, Tohsaka licks the pink bud.</p><hr><p>&quot;Ah...!! ...! Haa... no, please do not squeeze my breast so hard...!&quot;</p><p>She struggles to get up and her toes curl in protest.</p><hr><p>Has getting touched in a place that has never been touched made her sensations go past the limit?</p><p>Saber struggles frantically with her hot and weakened body.</p><hr><p>&quot;Nn... faa, ah...! Ah, ya\u2015\u2015!&quot;</p><p>Her voice and red face have lost the captivation they had earlier.</p><hr><p>&quot;...See. Don&#39;t lie, Saber. You&#39;re getting hotter.</p><p>...You feel good even though I&#39;m fondling your breasts, fondling your indecent parts, and teasing you, right\u2015\u2015?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Haa\u2015\u2015n-no, I am not...!&quot;</p><p>Sweat starts to form on Saber&#39;s white body.</p><p>&quot;...Ha... Haaa... Mm, ahh... No...&quot;</p><p>Her wild pose seems to be driven by something other than fever, and its obscenity increases with time.</p><hr><p>&quot;Aha\u2015\u2015you really are starting to get wet, Saber. You like being teased like this...?&quot;</p><p>&quot;...!! ...Rin, you are...&quot;</p><p>&quot;Mm... Your nipples are hardening... your body is so hot....&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>...!</p><p>My throat is so dry it hurts.</p><p>Saber being teased by the red flower is so different from usual and so lovely that I want to take her right now.</p><hr><p>&quot;... Ah... haa, ah... Rin, any more will be...&quot;</p><p>\u2015\u2015That tear-stained face.</p><p>Her cute throat anguishing, embarrassed by surges of pleasure as her breasts are teased and her wet slit is fondled.</p><p>I want to snatch her away right now.</p><p>I want to feel Saber in Tohsaka&#39;s place and make her moan like that\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>&quot;Fuaa...!! Ya, ah... ahhhh, ya\u2015\u2015!&quot;</p><p>Saber&#39;s reactions start to change.</p><p>The small wet splashes sound much more sticky now.</p><hr><p>Looking down.</p><p>Tohsaka&#39;s finger, going into Saber&#39;s slit and stirring it, is wet down to her wrist.</p><hr><p>&quot;Hmm... it&#39;s getting wet... ah, nn\u2015\u2015but you don&#39;t seem to be the sensitive type.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Ag... Rin, no... please do not go... any deeper\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>&quot;...Ah... I know... it&#39;s Shirou&#39;s role from now on... and your pussy&#39;s so tight... wow, my fingers are so wet.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...See, can you tell Saber...? Your pussy is like it&#39;s freshly boiled\u2015\u2015it looks so perverted.&quot;</p><p>Adding to the existing finger, she slips more into Saber&#39;s hole.</p><hr><p>&quot;...! Ah, hia...!&quot;</p><p>A sticky sound.</p><p>Tohsaka keeps fondling Saber, making wet sounds.</p><hr><p>&quot;Kua, no, please, stop\u2015\u2015!&quot;</p><p>Every time, she raises her body and swallows the words coming up to her throat.</p><p>Her limit is close.</p><p>Like this, she should be able to receive me in a matter of seconds.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>They don&#39;t even need to ask if I&#39;m ready as well.</p><p>My thing is already erect and full of blood, waiting shamelessly.</p><p>My pants are tight.</p><p>My dick is almost about to explode even though I&#39;m not doing anything, and it feels like I&#39;ll cum if I even touch it.</p><hr><p>&quot;Fa, ah...!! Nha, ha\u2015\u2015!&quot;</p><p>Saber&#39;s voice.</p><p>Tohsaka persistently fondles Saber&#39;s pussy, and Saber is too captivated by her fingers to protest.</p><p>There&#39;s no freedom for the white flower.</p><p>Tohsaka has completely enclosed Saber in her hands.</p><hr><p>&quot;Ah\u2015\u2015haa, ah, Rin\u2015\u2015! Hnn, ah, ya, I....&quot;</p><p>&quot;Hm... you feel odd...? ...Then I guess this will do... your pussy is wanting Shirou too. ...So\u2015\u2015!&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Ah, yaa, nmm...!!!!!&quot;</p><p>Tohsaka plunges her fingers in deeper for the last time and numbs her.</p><hr><p>Then.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Ha\u2015\u2015ah, ha...Aa&quot;</p><hr><p>Tohsaka holds up Saber as if showing off her hot white body.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Mm... are you ready as well, Shirou...?&quot;</p><p>Tohsaka is totally in tune with Saber.</p><p>Saber looks at me feebly, not knowing what to do with her heated body,</p><p>And Tohsaka fondles Saber&#39;s body with eyes that show both affection and sadism.</p><hr><p>The two defenselessly open their bodies and watch me as I stand there.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>The whiteness of Saber&#39;s body, half out of her mind, and the redness of Tohsaka&#39;s cheeks excited from embarrassment and hope.</p><p>The air in here is stenched with their smell, and it feels like this place is wet.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Here, hurry. Your pants are tight already... Take them off and show us. ...Saber wants it, and I want to see your erect penis too.&quot;</p><p>A voice with none of her usual firmness... a sweet and sticky voice.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>My head feels dizzy.</p><p>My throat dries up instantly.</p><p>My mouth is dry and my head is cracking up inside.</p><p>\u2015\u2015I&#39;m completely defeated.</p><p>Saber and I are beaten by Tohsaka&#39;s sweet words, completely knocked out.</p><hr><p>&quot;......&quot;</p><p>With the small amount of composure I have left, I open my zipper.</p><p>It is filled with blood and covered in veins, and looks ugly compared to Saber.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>The two stop breathing for an instant.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Wow.

Shirou&#39;s saying he couldn&#39;t wait for you.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Ah\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Shirou is... going to...&quot;</p><p>I don&#39;t know what they&#39;re thinking.</p><p>But the two of them stare at my cock.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015!&quot;</p><p>T-This is torture...!</p><p>I&#39;m already embarrassed, but having them see it erect boils my head from embarrassment\u2015\u2015!</p><hr><p>&quot;...T-T-Tohsaka...! So I just have to make love to Saber, right...!?&quot;</p><p>I bluff, frantically stopping myself from running away and take a step toward the bed.</p><hr><p>&quot;Yes. You&#39;re a man. You won&#39;t run away after everything&#39;s prepared like this, right?&quot;</p><p>She laughs.</p><p>&quot;...!&quot;</p><p>Fine, that encourages me...!</p><p>My mind that was about to be blown away moves forward as if unwilling to lose.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Shir... ou...&quot;</p><p>Saber looks up at me.</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>...No.</p><p>That&#39;s not it.</p><p>I just can&#39;t stand it any longer.</p><p>I want to touch Saber.</p><p>I want to feel her white skin and hear her voice by my ear, like Tohsaka did.</p><hr><p>But that&#39;s\u2015\u2015</p><p>&quot;...Is it really all right, Saber?

H-Hold on, please...! I-I do not know such a posit\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>&quot;Just relax. It&#39;ll be easier for you in this position.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Ah... but, this is...!&quot;</p><hr><p>I can&#39;t listen to Saber&#39;s complaints.</p><p>My heart is ready to burst from even the pluck of a needle.</p><p>My remaining reasoning has to go toward trying to stop Saber feeling pain and to go as easy as I can.</p><hr><p>&quot;Hya...! ...Ahh, nn...! You&#39;re, coming in, again, ah\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>...Stiffness starts to disappear from Saber&#39;s voice.</p><p>The embarrassment of getting hugged from behind must have overwhelmed her pain.</p><p>Stiffness starts to leave Saber&#39;s body, and my cock starts to move smoothly.</p><hr><p>&quot;Ha\u2015\u2015why... is, nha, fya...!&quot;</p><p>...Her reactions start to change.</p><p>Her wild breathing starts to change into the heated breathing she had while Tohsaka was fondling her.</p><p>&quot;Hm... ah...&quot;</p><p>And her hard inside starts to regain its original softness.</p><hr><p>&quot;...See. I told you this would be easier for you.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Ah... ahh, no, what, am I\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>She is bewildered, showing no trace of her usual firmness.</p><p>Saber is definitely starting to feel pleasure.</p><p>She is embarrassed about starting to feel pleasure from being penetrated from behind.</p><hr><p>&quot;...... Aha, you&#39;re pretty slovenly, Saber. You feel better getting it from behind even though this is your first time?&quot;</p><p>Tohsaka&#39;s finger goes up Saber&#39;s thigh.</p><hr><p>&quot;...! No, that is a lie...! I am not pleased at all...!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Really...? Then I&#39;ll help as well. Shirou seems to be reaching his limits and it&#39;s so wet here too, Saber. ...It&#39;ll get dirty unless I lick it clean.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Wha...!? R-Rin, what are you...!&quot;</p><p>The bed creaks and shakes.</p><p>Perhaps she&#39;s reacting to Tohsaka&#39;s tongue... Saber twists her body and tries to get away.</p><hr><p>&quot;...! Saber, if you move like that...!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Ah, eh, Shirou...!?&quot;</p><p>I won&#39;t be able to hold it.</p><p>The slow back and forth movement starts to speed up as if to answer Saber as she gets looser.</p><hr><p>&quot;Haa...! No, Rin, please, do not, lick, that...!&quot;</p><p>\u2015\u2015I&#39;m about to explode</p><p>I&#39;m about to come from her many walls tracing my cock and the warmth inside her.</p><hr><p>&quot;Mn, nn, ha\u2015\u2015! ...Why... is my head, going, blank...!?&quot;</p><p>It must be the same for Saber.</p><p>She isn&#39;t feeling pain anymore.</p><p>She only has the same feelings as me and Tohsaka, the sense of our heads going blank.</p><hr><p>...That unknown sensation must be scary for her.</p><p>Saber sheds tears that didn&#39;t even show during insertion and shakes her head in protest.</p><hr><p>&quot;Hm... nha, ha...! Sto-Stop, please stop, Shirou...! I don&#39;t want\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>Saber tries to get away.</p><p>But Tohsaka&#39;s caresses stop her.</p><p>Saber tries to run away from the pleasure coming from behind her, but she&#39;s trapped by Tohsaka&#39;s tongue.</p><hr><p>&quot;Ha, ya...! Ah, no, Shi... rou... my body, is...!&quot;</p><hr><p>...I feel like passing out.</p><p>Or have I already gone mad?</p><p>Saber&#39;s voice feels good.</p><p>Her slender arms and legs, and her inside walls feels so good that I can die in it.</p><hr><p>&quot;Ah, haa, it won&#39;t stop...! No, Shirou, I do not, want, this...!&quot;</p><p>So why.</p><p>Why is Saber so scared, why does she not want this feeling?</p><hr><p>&quot;...Why? It feels good, right, Saber?&quot;</p><p>I manage to ask so while holding what&#39;s about to spew out.</p><hr><p>She replies...</p><p>&quot;Ha, ah, m...! Haa, because... it makes me... uneasy, not being, able to, see your face...&quot;</p><p>...With an answer that just finishes me off.</p><hr><p>&quot;...!? Shirou, please hold, ah, ahhh...!&quot;</p><p>I can&#39;t hear her.</p><p>I don&#39;t have the composure left to listen to her.</p><p>Saber&#39;s body is going wild.</p><p>Her hips turn as she tries to get away.</p><p>I move my hips sideways, so as not to drown in that motion.</p><hr><p>&quot;Nn, fa, ah, ha...! No Shirou, if you do any, any more, I will go mad\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>That&#39;s not fair.</p><p>I&#39;ve already gone mad.</p><p>I want to be set free.</p><p>I want to reach orgasm.</p><p>So...</p><hr><p>&quot;Ya, nfu, ah...! Ahh, ya, ah, ahh, ahhhhhhhhh...!!!!!&quot;</p><hr><p>I push my hips forward.</p><p>A movement driven only by lust, with nothing of my slow movements from earlier.</p><hr><p>&quot;Ya, fua, no, ha, nn...! Haa, no Shirou, I will, really, go mad\u2015\u2015!&quot;</p><hr><p>\u2015\u2015Saber&#39;s back arcs.</p><p>As if hitting it</p><p>&quot;Ha\u2015\u2015kuh, Saber...!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Ahh\u2015\u2015naa, ahh, ahhhhhh...!!!&quot;</p><p>I ejaculate the sperm that I held for so long into her\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>...My body loses power.</p><p>My body wants to rest from withstanding ejaculation for so long and from giving Saber my magical energy.</p><hr><p>As I happen to look up at the sky, it&#39;s getting brighter.</p><p>Dawn is near.</p><p>...The one-night dream comes to an end.</p><p>That&#39;s right, I have woken from my dream.</p><p>This is no situation to remain in my lingering memory, and anyway, it was just a way to stay alive.</p><hr><p>...So I have to think of this as a dream.</p><p>Saber&#39;s voice, sensations... everything.</p><p>I have to think of this as an unfulfillable dream or I won&#39;t be able to live from now on\u2015\u2015</p><hr><h2 id="scene-19" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#scene-19" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Scene 19</h2><p>We go down the long hallway and pass through the gate.</p><p>\u2015\u2015Unbelievably, the place really is a castle.</p><p>An old castle hidden deep in the forest.</p><p>This whole place is surrounded by trees as far as the eye can see, and neither buildings nor sky can be seen in the distance.</p><hr><p>&quot;This way.

Then I will obey your command, Master.&quot;</p><hr><p>Saying so, Saber relaxes in my arms.</p><p>It was hard to carry her before since she was unwilling, but it&#39;ll be a bit easier now.</p><p>The problem now is\u2015\u2015whether Saber&#39;s body and my body will make it.</p><hr><p>...How long have we been running?</p><p>It feels like thirty minutes, and it feels like an hour.</p><p>&quot;Haa\u2015\u2015Haa, haa, hah\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>No, running isn&#39;t that bad.</p><p>I haven&#39;t been training for nothing, and Saber really is light.</p><hr><p>But, now\u2015\u2015</p><p>Inside, my body is messed up.</p><p>I get dizzier the more I move, and I feel like throwing up.</p><p>We&#39;re in a forest, so I would understand if I was bitten by a poisonous snake or something...</p><hr><p>&quot;Kuh\u2015\u2015I can&#39;t, let this\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>This isn&#39;t pain that&#39;ll kill me.</p><p>It&#39;s just that my chest feels heavy and I feel like throwing up.</p><p>This is nothing compared to the warmth in my arms right now.</p><hr><p>...Saber is closing her eyes as if asleep.</p><p>She&#39;s not resting because she&#39;s relaxed.</p><p>Her body is getting hotter by the minute.</p><p>Even though it&#39;s winter, her body is sweating and she&#39;s hanging her head to try to hide her ragged breathing.</p><hr><p>&quot;Crap\u2015\u2015this is really...&quot;</p><p>A repeat of that night.</p><p>Saber collapsed from using all her energy after using that sword on Rider.</p><p>...Saber hasn&#39;t healed a bit since that night.</p><p>Was her ability to talk now just a brief spark before she disappears?</p><hr><p>&quot;Ha\u2015\u2015Haa, haa, haa, ha\u2015\u2015!&quot;</p><p>I run, trying to deny that.</p><p>I don&#39;t care about my body.</p><p>I just make myself believe that something will be possible if I get home, and keep running\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>I almost fall, and stop myself from collapsing by leaning against a tree.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015!&quot;</p><p>...I can taste blood.</p><p>So this is the cause of my nausea.</p><p>I didn&#39;t spill it onto Saber since it was only a bit, but I still feel the cause of the nausea in my chest.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Well, it&#39;s better than the worst possibility if I think about it...&quot;</p><p>Saber would be mad at me for a different reason if I threw up the contents of my stomach.</p><p>Actually, I bet Saber would seriously try to cut me in half if I did that.</p><hr><p>&quot;Hah\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>...Yeah, that&#39;s funny.</p><p>Imagining a funny thing gives me some strength.</p><p>All right, I&#39;m done resting.</p><hr><p>&quot;No, you are done pushing yourself, Shirou.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Saber...?&quot;</p><p>She wasn&#39;t asleep?</p><p>Saber speaks in my arms.</p><hr><p>&quot;What do you mean I&#39;m done now?&quot;</p><p>&quot;You should escape by yourself, Shirou. You cannot take me with you in your state.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Wha\u2015\u2015!? That&#39;s not true...! I just fell down. This is nothing\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;It is something. What are you saying with a pale face like a corpse?&quot;</p><p>\u2015\u2015Hey.</p><p>Tohsaka, who was leading the way, is back here now for some reason.</p><hr><p>&quot;Heh, it&#39;s your choice to bluff, but you should at least hide the blood near your mouth even if we&#39;re in a dark forest. It&#39;s only natural for Saber to worry if you&#39;re in that state.&quot;</p><hr><p>Tohsaka glares at me.</p><p>Saber must have noticed that voice.</p><p>&quot;...Good. Things are simpler if Rin is here.&quot;</p><p>Saber says so without looking at Tohsaka.</p><hr><p>&quot;I would think so. I know what Saber wants to say. We don&#39;t have time, so say it quickly, so even that idiot can understand it.&quot;</p><p>Saber nods.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Yes. Rin, I want you to leave me here.</p><p>You will not be able to make it with me, and most of all\u2015\u2015I will not last long.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>I can&#39;t yell at her for saying such a ridiculous thing.</p><p>I have no intention of leaving Saber.</p><p>But still\u2015\u2015I know well enough that Saber&#39;s condition is worsening.</p><hr><p>Saber won&#39;t last long.</p><p>I vaguely knew that she wouldn&#39;t be able to make it until morning like this.</p><hr><p>&quot;I see. So how about you, Shirou? Will you die with Saber here?&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015Of course not. I have no such intention, and I won&#39;t let Saber disappear either. If she&#39;s going to disappear, I&#39;ll use the Command Spell and\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Okay, that&#39;s good enough. Then let&#39;s solve both problems at once.</p><p>We&#39;ll save Saber and all escape from the forest. That&#39;s our plan now.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...Huh?&quot;</p><p>My brain turns into tofu.</p><p>Tohsaka says the most difficult things so easily at times.</p><hr><p>&quot;Hold on...! I-I really want to do that, but since we can&#39;t\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Just come here. I&#39;ll say this, but I have no intention of letting Saber die like this either.</p><p>...Yes, I won&#39;t let this chance slip away. I&#39;ll have you fulfill your duty. You said it&#39;s okay, so you won&#39;t mind either, right Saber?&quot;</p><hr><p>Tohsaka looks at Saber with a meaningful expression.</p><p>&quot;......&quot;</p><p>Saber does not answer, but merely looks downward awkwardly.</p><hr><h2 id="scene-20" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#scene-20" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Scene 20</h2><p>Hi. I don&#39;t think I need to tell you now, but this is the place that comforts you at bad ends, the drop of water in the desert... the Tiger Dojo.</p><p>This time is the commemorative lucky number seven.</p><p>This is the memorable day of when Shirou finally became mine!</p><p>Please clap, everyone!</p><p>Yay. Congratulations, Illya-chan.</p><p>We won&#39;t congratulate you, you devil child\u2015\u2015!</p><p>Geez! What happened to that talk from last time about getting depressed because you made Shirou yours by force!?</p><p>What? Shirou accepted my offer willingly this time, so it&#39;s not my fault.</p><p>And I bet Shirou is happy too. Because Shirou, Sella, Liz, and I are all going to live together happily ever after.</p><p>Hm. Now that you say that, it seems like a paradise.</p><p>Captured by a young princess... could that be beautiful and good?</p><p>Yes. It&#39;s a privilege that I alone have, that you and Sakura lack.</p><p>So, Shirou and I end up going on a corrupted honeymoon!</p><p>Well, the H scene was discarded though.</p><p>Ugh... that hurts, Senpai. I thought you promised not to mention that.</p><p>Don&#39;t be conceited, buruma.</p><p>Oh. Hey, you there, don&#39;t pick on my senior student!</p><p>Kuh, she got away again... who is she anyway?</p><p>Oh, are you all right, Illya-chan?</p><p>Osu, it filled me with spirit. Senpai&#39;s words are always profound.</p><p>...It feels like they have more of a relationship of mutual trust than master and student do.</p><p>Oh, by the way. You say &quot;doll&quot; a lot, but, um... not that doll, right......?</p><p>Oh. You don&#39;t like scary stories, Taiga? Do you like stories about dolls that are alive?</p><p>So everyone, this Tiger Dojo is finished!</p><p>You made the wrong choice again this time, so go back and choose the other one!</p><p>Hey, you&#39;re trying to change the subject. Master, I think you should listen to what your student has to say!</p><p>No! I hate scary stories and horse racing stories!</p><p>Geez. It&#39;s fine, this is just a normal stuffed toy.</p><p>The thing about the doll will come up later on, so I&#39;ll explain it to you then.</p><p>Everyone, please be patient until then and keep Saber and Rin company!</p><hr><h2 id="scene-21" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#scene-21" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Scene 21</h2><p>Osu! This is the training area that saves you people heading straight to cat hell because you made a trivial mistake, the Tiger Dojo!</p><p>Osu. I am the senior student, in perfect condition and pumped up!</p><p>Splatter house!</p><p>Auuu...! Why did you do a full swing on me, Taiga!?</p><p>Did I do something bad!?</p><p>Shut up! This is the eighth Tiger Dojo, but you&#39;ve killed Shirou five times already!</p><p>There&#39;s a limit to murder too, you know!?</p><p>What? This is still on the cute side.</p><p>Because in the end, the one who kills Shirou the most is...</p><p>Hiya, Spoiler Prohibition Sword.</p><p>Heh, such an attack won&#39;t affect me.</p><p>Anyways, I&#39;m at the bottom of the list.</p><p>See, look at this notebook.</p><p>Wow, I didn&#39;t know such a list of killers existed.</p><p>...Oh, you&#39;re right. Hey, what are these lies?</p><p>Why do you get the &quot;good girl award&quot;?</p><p>It&#39;s because my actions are so graceful.</p><p>People with enough time should check out all of the ends where I kill Shirou.</p><p>You&#39;ll notice that it&#39;s a bit different from \u2585\u2585\u2585\u2585&#39;s.</p><p>A bit different...? Well, enough about trivial things.</p><p>Thinking tires me out.</p><p>Well, about this Tiger Dojo.</p><p>I don&#39;t think the choice was wrong, so why did it end up like this, senior student?</p><p>It&#39;s just lack of magical energy.</p><p>Saber recovered enough magical energy to be able to use Excalibur, but she didn&#39;t have enough to spend on her Noble Phantasm.</p><p>I don&#39;t know if that weak Excalibur could take off even two of Berserker&#39;s lives.</p><p>I see. So this time, one lost because of a smart choice?</p><p>Osu. This is a cruel tightrope where you die if you go on the defensive and if you go on the offensive.</p><p>It&#39;s a difficult balance as usual.</p><p>It feels more like a checkmate than a balance, considering the character abilities.</p><p>I see. Then this dojo is finished.</p><p>So go back to the previous choice and try choosing the immature, reckless choice!</p>', 4019);
