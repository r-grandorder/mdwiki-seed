Nighttime is for getting plenty of rest so you can wake up refreshed and raring to go the next day.</p><p><strong>Beni-Enma:</strong><br> It&#39;s unfortunate that some Heroic Spirits still have yet to learn these lessons...</p><p><strong>Beni-Enma:</strong><br> ...but I&#39;m very glad to see that you understand their importance, Master!</p><p><strong>Beni-Enma:</strong><br> You&#39;re the sort of person I&#39;d want for my coproprietor! It&#39;s no wonder you managed to restore all of humanity!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Aww, it&#39;s not THAT big a deal. (Obviously proud)</p><p><strong>Beni-Enma:</strong><br> Don&#39;t be silly, of course it is! You SHOULD be proud! You accomplished something monumental, chirp!</p><p><strong>Beni-Enma:</strong><br> ...That said, don&#39;t push yourself too hard, okay? Taking on too many responsibilities, or trying to live up to too many people&#39;s hopes, can leave you in a state of constant stress.</p><p><strong>Beni-Enma:</strong><br> I&#39;m very happy that you&#39;ve accomplished so much, but I&#39;m even happier that you&#39;re keeping yourself healthy.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> \u201CCoproprietor\u201D?</p><p><strong>Beni-Enma:</strong><br> Ch-chirp!?</p><p><strong>Beni-Enma:</strong><br> I-I&#39;m so sorry. That just slipped out.</p><p><strong>Beni-Enma:</strong><br> Kiyohime has been raving about your accomplishments ever since I formed a contract with you...</p><p><strong>Beni-Enma:</strong><br> ...and I was just so proud that I guess I got a little carried away, chirp.</p><hr><p><strong>Beni-Enma:</strong><br> ...Anyway, this won&#39;t do at all. We can&#39;t spend all day conversing, no matter how pleasant it might be.</p><p><strong>Beni-Enma:</strong><br> Come on, Master, it&#39;s time for breakfast. We have some lovely fish this morning thanks to Lady Sion.</p><p><strong>Beni-Enma:</strong><br> We also have hot, freshly cooked rice for carbohydrates, and for the main dish: simmered sardines and pickled plums with a side of chrysanthemum greens.</p><p><strong>Beni-Enma:</strong><br> Cooking at the Wandering Sea has been wonderful.<br> We&#39;re spoiled for choice when it comes to seafood.</p><p><strong>Beni-Enma:</strong><br> Though I am a little uneasy that I still don&#39;t know exactly how Lady Sion is acquiring these fish...</p><p><strong>Beni-Enma:</strong><br> Anyway, as nice as fish can be, it would certainly get boring if we had it every day, so I&#39;ll make sure to bring back some mountain veggies and wild game the next time I go back to the Enma-tei.</p><p><strong>Beni-Enma:</strong><br> Now go on, eat up!<br> You&#39;re still a growing [\u2642 boy /\u2640\uFE0F girl], after all!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Don&#39;t mind if I do!</p><p><strong>Beni-Enma:</strong><br> Hehe, I&#39;m glad to see you like this new seasoning.<br> (Taking notes)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> (How can I tell her I don&#39;t really like plum-simmered sardines...?)</p><p><strong>Beni-Enma:</strong><br> Hmm. I see you&#39;re not tucking in with your usual<br> enthusiasm. (Taking notes)</p><hr><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Mukyu, fooou???<br> (Special Translation: What&#39;re you staring at?)</p><p><strong>Beni-Enma:</strong><br> Oh, so you were under Master&#39;s bed, Lord Fou. Please, don&#39;t mind me. It&#39;s just an old bad habit of mine.</p><p><strong>Beni-Enma:</strong><br> Would you like something to eat, too?<br> Lady Sion told me you love bacon.</p><p><strong>Beni-Enma:</strong><br> Hehe, you may look like the auspicious qilin of ancient China, but you are nothing like them, are you?</p><p><strong>Beni-Enma:</strong><br> Don&#39;t worry, that doesn&#39;t bother me. The sparrows got me used to dealing with strange and unusual animals.</p><p><strong>Beni-Enma:</strong><br> I don&#39;t know exactly where you come from...</p><p><strong>Beni-Enma:</strong><br> ...but I appreciate that you&#39;re doing such<br> a good job of keeping [\u2642 Lord /\u2640\uFE0F Lady]Fujimaru safe!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> \u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u2013 Today&#39;s Breakfast \u2013</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> \u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000 \u2013 8:12 a.m. \u2013</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Kyuuu... Fooou...<br> (I wonder what&#39;s keeping the sparrow lady...)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I hope she&#39;s okay...</p><p><strong>Fionn mac Cumhaill:</strong><br> Hmm. It certainly isn&#39;t like Madam Beni to not follow her own advice about maintaining good routines.</p><p><strong>Fionn mac Cumhaill:</strong><br> Even if something urgent had come up, or she had overslept, she would surely have let you know.</p><p><strong>Fionn mac Cumhaill:</strong><br> So the fact that she hasn&#39;t must mean\u2013</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> You know, she deserves a day off now and then.</p><p><strong>Fionn mac Cumhaill:</strong><br> Indeed she does. Meal prep is something that only gets more difficult with every passing day.</p><p><strong>Fionn mac Cumhaill:</strong><br> Mothers need to take much-deserved breaks once in a while, lest their souls end up falling to the dark side.</p><p><strong>Fionn mac Cumhaill:</strong><br> And Madam Beni absolutely deserves the occasional break, given what a hard worker she is.</p><p><strong>Fionn mac Cumhaill:</strong><br> I would encourage you to remind her of that yourself sometimes, Master.</p><p><strong>Fionn mac Cumhaill:</strong><br> However...something tells me this absence is not due to her taking a break.</p><hr><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> Indeed, I have a bad feeling about this as well. I&#39;m worried we may end up missing breakfast; the most important meal of the day!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou, fooou!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Did I miss something? What are you guys doing here?</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> Why, we&#39;re here to protect you, of course, Master.<br> From poisoned food, specifically.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Fionn mac Cumhaill!</p><p><strong>Fionn mac Cumhaill:</strong><br> Heh. Yes, it is I, the star of Celtic mythology;<br> the bright hero of the Fenian Cycle.</p><p><strong>Fionn mac Cumhaill:</strong><br> I am the golden-haired mac Cumhaill; the man who is beautiful in all endeavors. Does that about cover it?</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou. Fooou.</p><hr><p><strong>Fionn mac Cumhaill:</strong><br> Hmm. It seems you still don&#39;t know about the disturbance that took place here last night, Master.</p><p><strong>Fionn mac Cumhaill:</strong><br> Fill [\u2642 him /\u2640\uFE0F her] in, would you, Diarmuid?</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> Leave it to me, my lord.<br> I will be both brief and concise.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> You see, Master, there was a disturbing incident in the cafeteria last night.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> As I&#39;m sure you know, meals at Chaldea have not been what most would consider normal for some time now.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> Thanks to the Chaldea staff&#39;s hard work, and some creativity on behalf of the chef Heroic Spirits...</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> ...the food here now provides Heroic Spirits with the magical energy we need to remain materialized.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> Providing such food was always a goal, but it was only through Madam Beni that it became a reality.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> It is the Enma-tei in the Land of Fairies\u2013or the sage realm, as I believe it&#39;s called in other countries...</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> ...that has been providing us with ingredients that can nurture spirit bodies as well as physical ones.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> As a result, there have been more Servants flocking to the cafeteria now than ever before.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> ...It was there that this incident took place.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> A number of Servants came down with diarrhea all at once, as though they had all been food poisoned.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> Last I heard, all of the Heroic Spirits who had eaten there last night are still moaning in bed, their bodies unable to break down the poison.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> That is why we are here now, Master:<br> to keep you safe from this nefarious poisoner.</p><p><strong>Fionn mac Cumhaill:</strong><br> Hahaha. There you have it, Master.<br> But please, no need to concern yourself with us.</p><p><strong>Fionn mac Cumhaill:</strong><br> To be honest, we were looking forward to the madam&#39;s breakfast just as much as you.</p><p><strong>Fionn mac Cumhaill:</strong><br> Indeed, it was thanks to her cooking that we enjoyed our days working at the Enma-tei as much as we did.</p><p><strong>Fionn mac Cumhaill:</strong><br> All that aside, it&#39;s unsettling that Madam Beni-Enma is apparently nowhere to be found. I&#39;m afraid my suspicions would seem to be correct.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Sounds like we&#39;d better go check in on her.</p><hr><p><strong>Sparrow:</strong><br> Wait, chirp.<br> You can&#39;t go to the madam&#39;s room now, chirp.</p><p><strong>Sparrow:</strong><br> I wish I could cover it up, but we sparrows are no good at fibbing, so I&#39;m just going to tell you that the food poisoning last night is the madam&#39;s fault, chirp.</p><p><strong>Sparrow:</strong><br> Chirp, I&#39;d rather you not see her now, Fujimaru.<br> It would only make her feel even worse, chirp.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou. Fo fou?</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> Is that true, Lord Sparrow? I can&#39;t believe a chef of Madam Beni&#39;s skill would make such an egregious error in cooking.</p><p><strong>Sparrow:</strong><br> No, no, chirp! Of course she didn&#39;t cook the<br> dish that made all those people sick, chirp!</p><p><strong>Sparrow:</strong><br> But she&#39;s still responsible for it, chirp.<br> She&#39;s the one who mismanaged the ingredients, chirp.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> So it&#39;s her fault even though she didn&#39;t cook?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> What do you mean, chirp?</p><hr><p><strong>Fionn mac Cumhaill:</strong><br> I see. So she made an administrative mistake. True, knowing the madam, I can see how she would feel personally responsible.</p><p><strong>Fionn mac Cumhaill:</strong><br> While you, I, and indeed most people may not hold her responsible, I doubt the same is true for her, given her own high standards for herself.</p><p><strong>Fionn mac Cumhaill:</strong><br> Tell me, young sparrow, would the madam happen to be at Rashomon now, by any chance?</p><p><strong>Sparrow:</strong><br> Ch-chirrrp!?</p><p><strong>Sparrow:</strong><br> How did you know, Fionnma? Is that salmon still swimming around in your head, chirp?</p><p><strong>Fionn mac Cumhaill:</strong><br> Hardly. I just figured that if any Servant were to do something like that, it would be her.</p><p><strong>Fionn mac Cumhaill:</strong><br> It&#39;s not unlike stacking blocks on top of one another; or words, in this case. Once they&#39;re arranged properly, it&#39;s easy for anyone to see what they mean.</p><p><strong>Fionn mac Cumhaill:</strong><br> Fujimaru, as Lady Beni-Enma&#39;s Master,<br> you must know a fair amount of her story.</p><p><strong>Fionn mac Cumhaill:</strong><br> She is one of the most well-known Heroic Spirits in Japanese folklore. The Tongue-Cut Sparrow, was it?</p><p><strong>Fionn mac Cumhaill:</strong><br> Her history is quite long and storied, so let&#39;s take the events of her life one at a time.</p><p><strong>Fionn mac Cumhaill:</strong><br> She was sold to a brothel at a young age, where she was forced to endure horrific treatment at her employers&#39; hands.</p><p><strong>Fionn mac Cumhaill:</strong><br> They crushed her throat...<br> Cut off her tongue...</p><p><strong>Fionn mac Cumhaill:</strong><br> ...so on the brink of death, she summoned up the last of her strength to escape.</p><p><strong>Fionn mac Cumhaill:</strong><br> In my reading of the tale, I don&#39;t see this escape as her risking her life. Rather, I think she simply wanted to choose where she would die for herself.</p><p><strong>Fionn mac Cumhaill:</strong><br> After all, she must have known her little broken-down body would never last through the night.</p><p><strong>Fionn mac Cumhaill:</strong><br> And as fate would have it, when she ran into the mountains, she ended up wandering into a mayoiga...</p><p><strong>Fionn mac Cumhaill:</strong><br> ...a haunted house that tested anyone who entered it, and killed them if they failed. There, she met her end.</p><p><strong>Fionn mac Cumhaill:</strong><br> She died all by herself, without a single comforting word. It must have been a sad and lonesome end to her life.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fionn mac Cumhaill:</strong><br> But, as I believe they say in your country,<br> one person&#39;s trash is another person&#39;s treasure.</p><p><strong>Fionn mac Cumhaill:</strong><br> A Jizou, a kind of deity in Japan that looks after children, took pity on her and reincarnated her...</p><p><strong>Fionn mac Cumhaill:</strong><br> ...into a lesser hell as a sparrow oni.</p><p><strong>Fionn mac Cumhaill:</strong><br> It is here I feel I should remind you that time does not exist in hell the way it does in our world.</p><p><strong>Fionn mac Cumhaill:</strong><br> Although the little girl we now know as Beni-Enma died during Japan&#39;s Edo period, she was reincarnated in hell before the Edo period had even begun.</p><p><strong>Fionn mac Cumhaill:</strong><br> I expect that was done to cleanse her of her human karma; to truly wipe her slate clean, so to speak.</p><p><strong>Fionn mac Cumhaill:</strong><br> In time, this red sparrow oni forgot about her life as a human, and went on to become a hard worker in hell.</p><p><strong>Fionn mac Cumhaill:</strong><br> She did everything from helping to guide souls across the Sanzu River, to looking after the tormentor demons in Children&#39;s Limbo.</p><p><strong>Fionn mac Cumhaill:</strong><br> Word of the hardworking sparrow traveled all across hell until eventually, Great King Enma adopted her as his child.</p><p><strong>Fionn mac Cumhaill:</strong><br> From there, he lovingly trained her in the art of Battoujutsu, where she learned to cut off the tongues of anyone caught lying...</p><p><strong>Fionn mac Cumhaill:</strong><br> ...and raised her into a judge overseeing hell itself.</p><p><strong>Fionn mac Cumhaill:</strong><br> He was so proud of her accomplishments that he gave her his personal Enma ledger and sage cloak.</p><p><strong>Fionn mac Cumhaill:</strong><br> And so, Beni-Enma, the Tongue-Cut Sparrow who caused even great oni to quake in fear, was born.</p><p><strong>Fionn mac Cumhaill:</strong><br> However, although Great King Enma was very happy with her skills, he must not have cared for the idea of his darling daughter being a dreaded arbiter of hell...</p><p><strong>Fionn mac Cumhaill:</strong><br> ...because he soon ordered her to oversee the mayoiga back on the surface.</p><p><strong>Fionn mac Cumhaill:</strong><br> In time, the mayoiga left to her care became the Sparrow&#39;s Inn described in Japanese folklore, which she ran under the name \u201CEnma-tei.\u201D</p><p><strong>Fionn mac Cumhaill:</strong><br> However, at some point, for some reason or other...</p><p><strong>Fionn mac Cumhaill:</strong><br> ...she went down to visit a nearby human village,<br> and ended up captured and tortured by a human.</p><p><strong>Fionn mac Cumhaill:</strong><br> The details are the same as what&#39;s depicted in the tale of the Tongue-Cut Sparrow.</p><p><strong>Fionn mac Cumhaill:</strong><br> At any rate, that is the story I learned at the Enma-tei of how Lady Beni-Enma came to be who she is.</p><p><strong>Fionn mac Cumhaill:</strong><br> Does that sound right to you, little sparrow?</p><p><strong>Sparrow:</strong><br> How do you know so much about her, chirp?<br> Have you been stalking her, chirp?</p><p><strong>Fionn mac Cumhaill:</strong><br> It&#39;s because I support the Enma-tei wholeheartedly. There aren&#39;t many safe otherworldly places humans can stumble into, after all.</p><p><strong>Fionn mac Cumhaill:</strong><br> Now then. Fujimaru, Diarmuid, is there anything that stood out to you in my recounting of Madam Beni&#39;s story?</p><p><strong>Fionn mac Cumhaill:</strong><br> Don&#39;t be shy. Anything at all will do.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Um... The fact that she used to be human?</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou, fou! (Special Translation:<br> There&#39;s another oni like that here in Chaldea!)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I am curious what an Enma ledger is. And a little on her history.</p><p><strong>Sparrow:</strong><br> You&#39;ve never heard of Great King Enma&#39;s Enma ledger before, chirp? It&#39;s the notebook that describes everything a dead soul did during their lifetime, chirp.</p><p><strong>Sparrow:</strong><br> That&#39;s why they can&#39;t lie to him;<br> because the ledger always contains the truth, chirp.</p><p><strong>Sparrow:</strong><br> That ledger reveals all the sins one committed while they were alive. It&#39;s the final weapon of hell, chirp!</p><hr><p><strong>Fionn mac Cumhaill:</strong><br> She was not originally born to oni-kind.<br> She was a human who was transformed into one.</p><p><strong>Fionn mac Cumhaill:</strong><br> And so, the Enma ledger is a treasure containing untold amounts of top secret information.</p><p><strong>Fionn mac Cumhaill:</strong><br> By stacking these words together, we are soon reminded of a certain Heroic Spirit.</p><p><strong>Fionn mac Cumhaill:</strong><br> Ibaraki-Douji: leader of oni and thieves, and above all, an oni who remains decidedly unrepentant.</p><p><strong>Fionn mac Cumhaill:</strong><br> The way I see it, it was only a matter of time before she made some sort of move on the good madam.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> ...If I may, Fionn mac Cumhaill...</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> ...There&#39;s actually one more thing from Madam Beni&#39;s backstory that stood out to me.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> You said that her tongue was cut<br> out back when she was human.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> Has it been restored now that she&#39;s a Heroic Spirit?</p><p><strong>Fionn mac Cumhaill:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Fionn mac Cumhaill:</strong><br> I&#39;m afraid not, Diarmuid.<br> And it never will be.</p><p><strong>Fionn mac Cumhaill:</strong><br> You see, her tongue being cut is an inextricable factor in her being a Heroic Spirit.</p><p><strong>Fionn mac Cumhaill:</strong><br> That&#39;s why it can never be restored, no matter what sort of healing spells one might try.</p><p><strong>Fionn mac Cumhaill:</strong><br> For if it were, that would mean by definition that she was no longer the Tongue-Cut Sparrow.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> Then, in that case...how does she season her cooking?</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> Needless to say, it is impossible to taste without a tongue. So if she is still missing hers...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> That&#39;s...a damn good point.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> (I can&#39;t believe that never occurred to me before...)</p><hr><p><strong>Fionn mac Cumhaill:</strong><br> Good question. Madam Beni is indeed missing her sense of taste, which is, of course, a huge disadvantage for a chef.</p><p><strong>Fionn mac Cumhaill:</strong><br> So I cannot help but deeply respect the fact that she has become such an expert in the kitchen that she now has her own cooking classes.</p><p><strong>Fionn mac Cumhaill:</strong><br> At any rate, I think that covers everything I needed to tell you before we begin.</p><p><strong>Fionn mac Cumhaill:</strong><br> Standing by and letting Madam Beni fight this difficult battle alone would go against every principle I hold dear. Come, Master. What do you say we go poke our noses into her business?</p><p><strong>--ARROW--:</strong></p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> When we entered Ibaraki-Douji&#39;s room...</p><hr><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...we found it had turned into the Singularity from that time.</p><hr><p><strong>Fionn mac Cumhaill:</strong><br> A Reality Marble. Ibaraki-Douji&#39;s mindscape<br> is manifesting as an alternate world.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> Then, is this the power of Madam Beni&#39;s precious Enma ledger at work?</p><p><strong>Fionn mac Cumhaill:</strong><br> Of course. It may not be as powerful as a Holy Grail, but as a magical tool once possessed by the great King of Hell himself who gave it to his daughter, it&#39;s still nothing to be trifled with.</p><p><strong>Fionn mac Cumhaill:</strong><br> So an oni of some renown would be well within her means to use it for something like this. Isn&#39;t that right, Lord Tawara?</p><p><strong>C\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Indeed! This Bounded Field was oni-created. It must be a mayoiga connecting reality and the afterworld!</p><p><strong>C\uFF1A???:</strong><br> It may not bear a grudge, but it is still permeated with a kind of gloom. And this smell... Is that alcohol? No, wait. I think it&#39;s...azuki?</p><p><strong>C\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Ugh, that damn Ibaraki-Douji. Is she trying to go back to her old oni ways?</p><p><strong>Sparrow:</strong><br> Chirp? Who&#39;s this guy, chirp?</p><p><strong>Sparrow:</strong><br> Since he&#39;s carrying a bag of rice, I&#39;m guessing he&#39;s from the rice shop, chirp?</p><p><strong>Sparrow:</strong><br> Though from the way he&#39;s baring his chest, he might just be some kind of pervert, chirp.</p><p><strong>Sparrow:</strong><br> If you&#39;re just here to make a delivery, would you mind using the back entrance by the kitchen, chirp?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Bwa!? Sparrow, don&#39;t you know who this is!?</p><hr><p><strong>C\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Hahaha, right you are! Making deliveries is hard work. Sometimes, it&#39;s just easier to do it with your shirt off!</p><p><strong>C\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Lord mac Cumhaill there asked if I could help, and since I had nothing better to do, I readily agreed.</p><p><strong>C\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Oh, you can just call me \u201CRice Guy,\u201D by the way.<br> That&#39;s all the name I need here.</p><p><strong>Rice Guy:</strong><br> Oh, and one more thing: make sure you don&#39;t tell the madam about me, all right?</p><p><strong>Rice Guy:</strong><br> That goes for you too, Fujimaru.<br> Whatever you do, do not reveal my True Name here.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Okay, I can do that... But why not?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> All right, if you insist. But can I ask why?</p><hr><p><strong>Rice Guy:</strong><br> Oh, let&#39;s not get into that now. It&#39;s not really<br> a topic for polite company, you see. And more<br> importantly\u2013</p><p><strong>Rice Guy:</strong><br> It looks like they&#39;re wasting no time rolling out the welcome wagon for us! I see a Saber, a Lancer, an Archer... That&#39;s quite the opponent assortment!</p><p><strong>Rice Guy:</strong><br> Hahaha, I take it you saw this sort of thing coming when you asked for my help?</p><p><strong>Rice Guy:</strong><br> All right then, I&#39;ll go ahead and take care of the Saber oni. It should make for a good warm-up for my bow before we teach the big kahuna a lesson!</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> I&#39;ll handle the Lancer oni. Fionn mac Cumhaill, would you deal with the oni bringing up the rear?</p><p><strong>Fionn mac Cumhaill:</strong><br> Of course. All right, Master, let&#39;s see how well you can command all three of us!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I was NOT expecting them to be that tough...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Since when could Ibaraki-Douji control enemies this strong?</p><hr><p><strong>Sparrow:</strong><br> It&#39;s the affinity between an oni and hell, chirp. They make for an almost unbeatable combination, chirp.</p><p><strong>Rice Guy:</strong><br> Talk about having the home ground advantage. This must mean the treasure Ibaraki-Douji stole from the madam really is\u2013</p><p><strong>Fionn mac Cumhaill:</strong><br> Indeed. The only thing that would let her command oni this powerful is Madam Beni&#39;s Enma ledger.</p><p><strong>Fionn mac Cumhaill:</strong><br> This is much worse than I had anticipated.</p><p><strong>Fionn mac Cumhaill:</strong><br> No wonder this is beyond Lady Beni-Enma&#39;s capacity. I&#39;m not sure the four of us together are up to the task.</p><p><strong>Fionn mac Cumhaill:</strong><br> Come on, we need to make sure the madam is safe.<br> I just hope we&#39;re not too late...!</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Hahahaha! This heat! These flames!<br> How do you like my new unstoppable power!?</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> I didn&#39;t use to put much stock in those old tales about trials and judgments in hell, but this one turned out to be way better than I expected!</p><p><strong>Beni-Enma:</strong><br> You&#39;re even more of a fool than I thought, Ibaraki! I see I have no choice but to sever both of your arms!</p><p><strong>Beni-Enma:</strong><br> Enjaku Nobori Hina! Followed by Oroshi Kaze!<br> Try this sparrow whirlwind on for size!</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Hahaha, too easy!<br> So much for your vaunted sparrow swordplay!</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> I usually couldn&#39;t keep up with sword strokes that fast, but it looks like my body just moves on its own now!</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> In fact...</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> I can&#39;t stop it from moving! What&#39;s going on!?<br> I&#39;m starting to scare meee!</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Is this because I misused Enma&#39;s ledger!?<br> Am I getting my jigoku deserts!?</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> But why!? All I did was try one\u2013Okay, three\u2013Okay, ten secret techniques from it!</p><p><strong>Beni-Enma:</strong><br> ...I had a feeling things might turn out this way.</p><p><strong>Beni-Enma:</strong><br> You&#39;ve become a textbook example of digging your own grave. I&#39;m amazed someone as thoughtless as you was ever able to lead a gang of oni.</p><p><strong>Beni-Enma:</strong><br> I guess you must be one of those oni whose true talents only shine when they&#39;ve got lesser ones working for them.</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Never mind the psychoanalysis! Help me out here!<br> My back muscles are so sore they feel like they&#39;re going to burst!</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> I do want to be a great oni, but I don&#39;t want to end up as one of those tormentors of hell that&#39;s all muscle!</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> I&#39;m sorry, red lady oni! I&#39;d take it all back if I could! I should&#39;ve known better than to steal!</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> So please, help me! Save meee!<br> I&#39;ll give you your ledger right back, I promise!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> What in the world is going on here...?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Yup, that&#39;s the Ibaraki-Douji I know all right...</p><hr><p><strong>Beni-Enma:</strong><br> Master!? Lord Fionn!? Lord Diarmuid!?<br> What are you all doing here!? And who is\u2013</p><p><strong>Beni-Enma:</strong><br> Umm, hello there, Heroic Spirit I&#39;ve never seen before. Are you here from the rice shop?</p><p><strong>Rice Guy:</strong><br> Hahaha. Sure, let&#39;s go with that.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> We heard you were in danger, Madam,<br> so we came to help.</p><p><strong>Beni-Enma:</strong><br> What were you thinking, Gokan!? I thought I told you not to tell Master about this! I can clean up my own mess!</p><p><strong>Sparrow:</strong><br> I didn&#39;t tell them anything, Madam, chirp.<br> Fionnma figured it out on his own, chirp.</p><p><strong>Sparrow:</strong><br> Watching him in action was like watching a beautiful salmon surging upstream, chirp.</p><p><strong>Sparrow:</strong><br> It makes me wonder if he might have once been the captain or commander or something of a large organization in his own day, chirp.</p><p><strong>Fionn mac Cumhaill:</strong><br> Hahaha, come now, you&#39;re exaggerating.<br> I wouldn&#39;t say I did anything special at all.</p><p><strong>Fionn mac Cumhaill:</strong><br> That said, I do like to think I&#39;m a reasonable man. If you wish to spread those rumors far and wide, who am I to stop you?</p><p><strong>Fionn mac Cumhaill:</strong><br> Anyway, I&#39;m afraid you&#39;ll just have to resign yourself to accepting our help, Madam Beni. I&#39;ve already figured out about eighty percent of the situation, anyway.</p><p><strong>Fionn mac Cumhaill:</strong><br> And good luck getting Master and the others to go back to their rooms before this matter is dealt with.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You know it.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> What he said.</p><hr><p><strong>Beni-Enma:</strong><br> ...I see. Well, if this is all Lord Fionn&#39;s idea, I guess I&#39;m in no position to refuse!</p><p><strong>Beni-Enma:</strong><br> Chirp, I&#39;ll even go ahead and make a formal request. Would you lend a hand in killing Ibaraki-Douji!?</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Wha!? I asked you to stop me, not kill me!<br> I&#39;m not even gonna drop anything this time!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> So Rashomon turned back into the Enma-tei?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I guess that&#39;s that then?</p><hr><p><strong>Beni-Enma:</strong><br> So it would seem! Thank you all so much for your help!</p><p><strong>Beni-Enma:</strong><br> I was planning to handle this on my own, but your assistance was invaluable. Chirp chirp, thank you.</p><p><strong>Rice Guy:</strong><br> No problem! I&#39;m just glad you&#39;re okay, Madam!<br> Now the cafeteria should be back to its old self!</p><p><strong>Rice Guy:</strong><br> But I do have to ask you, Ibaraki-Douji:<br> Why did you embarrass yourself like this?</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji Bound With Rope:</strong><br> Ha! If you think I&#39;m gonna thank you for stopping me, you thought wrong! If anyone&#39;s an oni around here, it&#39;s you guys for ganging up and whaling on me like there&#39;s no tomorrow!</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji Bound With Rope:</strong><br> Still...I will apologize for stealing the Enma ledger. It was just on a whim, but I still feel bad about it.</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji Bound With Rope:</strong><br> The red lady oni carries it around with her constantly. Now that I&#39;m back to my senses, I know why that is.</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> One day, I noticed her writing<br> something down in a notebook...</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> ...while she was studying the expressions on the Servants having lunch in the cafeteria.</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> (That&#39;s right. She&#39;s the daughter of the King of Hell, isn&#39;t she?)</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> (So that must be the famous Enma ledger!<br> The notebook that has records of everyone&#39;s lives!)</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> (I bet she uses it to torture Heroic Spirits when they fall into hell, so they have no choice but to obey her.)</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> (This is perfect. I bet it lists Raikou&#39;s weaknesses... Kintoki&#39;s weaknesses... Maybe even Tsuna&#39;s!)</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> By the time those thoughts had crossed my mind,<br> my hands had already made off with the notebook.</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> I&#39;ve always been great at pickpocketing wallets and such from kimono sleeves, after all.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> (Oh, yeah...)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> (True, I&#39;ve seen Beni-Enma writing in that notebook, too...)</p><hr><p><strong>Beni-Enma:</strong><br> So that&#39;s why you stole my notebook?<br> Then you made a big mistake in more ways than one.</p><p><strong>Beni-Enma:</strong><br> Yes, Papa&#39;s Enma ledger does contain every deed every person on Earth has ever done.</p><p><strong>Beni-Enma:</strong><br> But while my notebook might be from hell, it&#39;s also just an ordinary notebook that you can find anywhere.</p><p><strong>Beni-Enma:</strong><br> The type that even an apprentice prostitute who can&#39;t yet read or write might have. It&#39;s not the real deal.</p><p><strong>Beni-Enma:</strong><br> Well, I suppose it does technically have a section for sins, even if it&#39;s not in the way you thought.</p><p><strong>Beni-Enma:</strong><br> Anyway, your misusing of my notebook for your own ends is clearly what led to last night&#39;s food poisoning incident, as well as your rampage just now.</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji Bound With Rope:</strong><br> Y-yeah, I know that now.</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji Bound With Rope:</strong><br> After I stole your notebook, I transformed into you and snuck into the kitchen to make a bunch of things from what was written in it...</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji Bound With Rope:</strong><br> ...but when I got back to my room and ate them, my heart started beating erratically, my guts started wrenching, and blood came pouring out my nose!</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji Bound With Rope:</strong><br> And if all that weren&#39;t bad enough, you guys came here and ganged up on me! Well, no more! I&#39;m done with this crap!</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji Bound With Rope:</strong><br> Here, you can have your stupid notebook back! Some sorry excuse for treasure it turned out to be!</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> Huh!? When did you undo your ropes!?</p><p><strong>B\uFF1AIbaraki-Douji:</strong><br> What are you, stupid!? How many times do you think<br> you bastards have captured me before!? I can practically undo ropes like this in my sleep now!</p><p><strong>B\uFF1AIbaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Muahahaha! See ya, Western swordsmen!<br> See ya, gullible Master!</p><p><strong>B\uFF1AIbaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Oh, also, you guys didn&#39;t beat me at all! I only lost to that oni&#39;s sinful secret arts (read: snacks)...</p><p><strong>B\uFF1AIbaraki-Douji:</strong><br> ...and to Fujiwara-no-Hidesato there!<br> Basically, I got nothing to be ashamed of!</p><p><strong>B\uFF1AIbaraki-Douji:</strong><br> I mean, even freakin&#39; Raikou&#39;s scared of Mr. Rice<br> Guy, so you can&#39;t blame me for not sticking around!<br> Muahahaha!</p><p><strong>Rice Guy:</strong><br> Damn, she said my True Name before I could stop her. Trust an oni to get a parting shot at your weak spot.</p><p><strong>Beni-Enma:</strong><br> Th-th-then, does that mean you<br> really are Lord Tawara Touta!?</p><p><strong>D\uFF1ATawara Touta:</strong><br> Yes, that&#39;s me.<br> I&#39;d heard you held me in fairly high regard...</p><p><strong>D\uFF1ATawara Touta:</strong><br> ...so I&#39;ve been avoiding you to make sure I didn&#39;t end up sullying your impressions of me.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1ATawara Touta:</strong><br> But when Lord mac Cumhaill told me what had happened, I was so overcome with the urge to help that I couldn&#39;t resist.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1ATawara Touta:</strong><br> I hope you can forgive me for sticking my nose in,<br> Lady Beni-Enma. I never meant to dishonor you.</p><p><strong>Beni-Enma:</strong><br> D-d-don&#39;t be ridiculous, chirp! You&#39;ve honored me more<br> than I can say! I&#39;m the one who should be apologizing!</p><p><strong>Beni-Enma:</strong><br> Not only did my carelessness end up making trouble for everyone at Chaldea, now I&#39;ve gone and made you dirty your hands too...</p><p><strong>Beni-Enma:</strong><br> I can&#39;t thank you all enough...</p><p><strong>D\uFF1ATawara Touta:</strong><br> Ha ha ha, not at all, Madam Beni.<br> We&#39;re the ones who are grateful.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1ATawara Touta:</strong><br> After all, we wouldn&#39;t be eating nearly as well if it wasn&#39;t for you!</p><p><strong>D\uFF1ATawara Touta:</strong><br> Frankly, I don&#39;t think this comes close to paying back the debt we owe you, and I&#39;m sure I&#39;m not the only one who thinks so!</p><p><strong>Fionn mac Cumhaill:</strong><br> Indeed. I&#39;m especially fond of the way you always manage to cook salmon just right. I hope you&#39;ll be willing to teach me the trick sometime.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> I&#39;m especially fond of your...shishi niku, I think it&#39;s called? There&#39;s just something about it that inspires me to fight.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> It would absolutely make my day if you were to add it to the standard menu.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Your cooking is always a highlight of the day for me, too!</p><hr><p><strong>Fionn mac Cumhaill:</strong><br> Oops. My apologies for the stomach growls. We&#39;ve been in Master&#39;s room since the morning, you see.</p><p><strong>Fionn mac Cumhaill:</strong><br> Hmm, it seems we&#39;re in quite the pickle now. Ibaraki-Douji was such a fearsome opponent that we can hardly raise a hand!</p><p><strong>Fionn mac Cumhaill:</strong><br> I think we need a delicious and nutritious meal, on the double. Wouldn&#39;t you all agree?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Oh, yeah! I still haven&#39;t had breakfast!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Man, count on Fionn mac Cumhaill to wrap things up nice and tidy!</p><hr><p><strong>Beni-Enma:</strong><br> Hehe. Well in that case, I guess I&#39;d better get cooking! Treating you all to a proper feast is the least I can do!</p><p><strong>Beni-Enma:</strong><br> Thank you all again for being so considerate of me.<br> I really, really appreciate it!</p><p><strong>Beni-Enma:</strong><br> As a proprietress, I feel blessed getting to spend each day with customers as wonderful as all of you!</p><p><strong>B\uFF1AIbaraki-Douji:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> Aww, what&#39;s the matter, Ibaraki? Why the long face? All this peace and quiet boring you out of your skull?</p><p><strong>B\uFF1AIbaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Oh, hi, Shuten. It&#39;s nothing, really.<br> At least, I don&#39;t think it is...</p><p><strong>B\uFF1AIbaraki-Douji:</strong><br> I just feel like I&#39;ve seen<br> something I shouldn&#39;t, is all.</p><p><strong>B\uFF1AIbaraki-Douji:</strong><br> You know the little sparrow oni?<br> The one they say came from hell?</p><p><strong>B\uFF1AIbaraki-Douji:</strong><br> I got a look at the notebook she&#39;s always carrying around...and it was chock-full of recipes.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> Oh, right, the little shrimp. Well what&#39;s so surprising? Anyone who&#39;s good at cooking&#39;s probably got a notebook like that.</p><p><strong>B\uFF1AIbaraki-Douji:</strong><br> But it wasn&#39;t just recipes. She&#39;d also written down how different people reacted to a given recipe, and things she could do to improve it the next time.</p><p><strong>B\uFF1AIbaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Her handwriting was horrible, but she still wrote down a ton of crazy detailed notes. It&#39;s almost scary how closely she&#39;d have to be watching to notice some of the things she did.</p><p><strong>B\uFF1AIbaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Anyway, I finally realized why she goes to all that trouble. It&#39;s &#39;cause she doesn&#39;t have a tongue.</p><p><strong>B\uFF1AIbaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Well, she might still have some sense of taste, since I think only half of it got cut off...</p><p><strong>B\uFF1AIbaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Then again, she might&#39;ve lost it entirely. Either way, the fact that her cooking is still so good is amazing.</p><p><strong>B\uFF1AIbaraki-Douji:</strong><br> I mean, it&#39;s gotta be just as hard as a blind guy painting a colorful masterpiece.</p><p><strong>B\uFF1AIbaraki-Douji:</strong><br> When I think about how hard she must&#39;ve trained to get as good as she is, well...it freaked me out.</p><p><strong>B\uFF1AIbaraki-Douji:</strong><br> And then, it kinda made me, uh...sad?<br> I&#39;m not really sure what it was I felt.</p><p><strong>B\uFF1AIbaraki-Douji:</strong><br> But, I think the idea of working yourself to the bone to learn to do something you can&#39;t, smiling even when you feel like you&#39;re about to collapse...</p><p><strong>B\uFF1AIbaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Well, it kind of feels like something I used to do way back when I was alive...</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> What a silly little thing to say.<br> You&#39;ve always been a free-spirited oni leader.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> You&#39;d go around fighting Kyoto&#39;s guards, taking whatever you wanted, eating whoever got in your way...</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> You were an oni&#39;s oni, through and through.<br> Hell, you were practically the definition of one.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> There&#39;s nothing wrong with that. Nothing wrong with that at all. In fact, that&#39;s the Ibaraki I like best.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> That&#39;s the Ibaraki I&#39;ve always enjoyed being around.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> Really, isn&#39;t that why you left the mansion to begin with? Because you wanted to have fun instead of working hard?</p><p><strong>B\uFF1AIbaraki-Douji:</strong><br> ...Yeah. Yeah, you&#39;re right!</p><p><strong>B\uFF1AIbaraki-Douji:</strong><br> When my mom sent me out into the world, she demanded I be as proud as I could be of being an oni!</p><p><strong>B\uFF1AIbaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Man, I can&#39;t believe an oni of my caliber let myself get swept up in some stupid sentiment!</p><p><strong>B\uFF1AIbaraki-Douji:</strong><br> I knew I could count on you, Shuten! One of these days, I&#39;m gonna learn how to be as light on my feet as you are!</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> ...My, my. I never would&#39;ve thought Ibaraki and the little oni would have so much in common.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> If Tsuna or the like were to show up now,<br> it might just push her over the edge.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> Ugh, this sucks. I usually love me some gloom and doom, but not when it comes to Ibaraki...</p><p></p>', 378);
