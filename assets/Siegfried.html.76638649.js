Even though he will normally listen to anything said to him, in some line of thought he has, he will not move even one step aside in situations that will compromise his principles and position, even if a Command Spell is used. Because of that, it also seems that he is occasionally misunderstood.</p><p>Siegfried\u2019s self-esteem tends to be negative because of the misfortune caused by Das Rhinegold that continues to last even now, with him being unable to do anything but grant the wishes of those who cross over into his lifetime, and it seems that his reasons that once stirred the flow of his desires could not be found anymore.</p><h2 id="attitude-towards-master" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#attitude-towards-master" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Attitude Towards Master</h2><p>It is possible to say that he is extremely easy to handle as a Servant, Siegfried being able to make a Master with the mannerism to take a step back from a dangerous situation to stand up to the situation presented instead. However, like mentioned above, in situations where he is presented problems that will affect his principles and position, in spite of how favourable the relationship was built between his Master and himself, it seems he will stubbornly not listen to anything said to him by his Master. However, his principles are extremely humane and respectable, and if he has a virtuous Master, it is expected for one to be able to build up a relationship of mutual trust with him without any troubles to an extent.</p><p>However, even if it was with flattery, no matter what kind of relationship of mutual trust was built up, it is hard for one to ride on a relationship with Siegfried.</p><h2 id="dialogue-examples" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#dialogue-examples" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Dialogue Examples</h2><p>\u201CLuck has merely made a short visit to this side. Don\u2019t be disheartened.\u201D</p><p>\u201CThere\u2019s nothing I particularly want to wish for on the Holy Grail.

Siegfried was a prince of a noble lineage with various adventures having unfolded around him. And then, he heard rumours about the beautiful Kriemhild of the Kingdom of Burgundy and went towards her for a marriage proposal\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014Thus, the tragedy had begun.</p><p>As a matter of fact, in \u201CThe Nibelungenlied\u201D, Siegfried is not in the role of the leading character. The true leading character is his wife, Kriemhild, and this epic poem is a great revenge tragedy brought about by her despair and hatred.</p><p>Consequently, even Siegfried\u2019s adventures, up to him obtaining the demonic sword Balmung and the event where he felled the Evil Dragon Fafnir, were only just talked about as hearsay by the characters and were not actually depicted in the tale. In the First Chapter of the FGO Story, when Siegfried told his companions that he does not remember anything of the time when he confronted Fafnir, it is because no one within his tale even saw, heard or talked about that in the first place.</p><p>At the end of his adventures, Siegfried obtained a cloak that hides his figure, obtained the demonic sword Balmung, and in the end, accomplished the feat of Dragon Slaying where he felled the Evil Dragon Fafnir. And, almost a large number of these extremely gruesome battles were events that went untold\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>Without even choosing to waste even a considerable amount of Das Rhinegold that he obtained as he likes, Siegfried entrusted his back, his only weak point, to his peerless friend.</p><p>Judging from Siegfried\u2019s point of view, it was the only way in order to resolve the antagonism between Kriemhild and the wife of his older brother-in-law where it was growing to the point that Siegfried already found himself in a sticky situation with his involvement, but he was fatally misjudging the situation.</p><p>If it is for the sake of revenge for her murdered husband, then it does not even matter if Kriemhild sells her soul to the devil for she loves Siegfried so much to the extent that she would do so. Her hatred was not only pointed towards Hagen, the one who killed Siegfried, but also towards Gunther, her older brother. And then, it has been decided that even Kriemhild herself, who was taken prisoner to her hatred, would therefore be brought down by an attack filled with a righteous spirit. Furthermore, it was Siegfried\u2019s beloved sword, Balmung, that Kriemhild used to kill Hagen, so there are even people that said that after twists and turns, Siegfried has fulfilled his revenge. However, it was still certain that Siegfried and Hagen were once friends whom exchanged drinks of alcohol and talked together of their dreams as well.</p><p>For the times when he is summoned as a Servant, Siegfried will think to himself. Of how he was celebrated as a Hero who killed a dragon, but the only thing he did in the end was nothing more than giving birth to further tragedy. An absolute retribution, as if to say, \u2019Since you were spilling the blood of various people so far, you will even spill the blood of the people you are protecting.\u2019 Therefore, his self-esteem is constantly negative, and in one way or another, he is muttering thus:</p><p>\u201CI\u2019m sorry.\u201D</p><h2 id="related-characters" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#related-characters" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Related Characters</h2><p><strong>Vlad III</strong></p><p>\u201CI\u2019m really sorry for inconveniencing you in some other world.\u201D</p><p><strong>Brynhildr</strong></p><p>\u201CI want you to calm down and take a deep breath.

And the staff had to race to implement him in the end when his appeal didn\u2019t fit into the phone screen as I more than doubled their troubles too with the absurd workload! I\u2019m really sorry.</p><p>After I came up with the rest of his evolutions, if I leaned Siegfried forward a little in order to choose a way to balance his weight, it\u2019s miraculously matching with more of his established character, all for the appearance of making him awfully apologetic\u2026 Even though he\u2019s a Great Hero, I\u2019m sorry.
