So dark. Where&#39;s the light?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> And...dammit.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> It hurts...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> My entire body hurts. My chest, my stomach, my back, my arms, my legs, my head, my nose, my inner ears hurt.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> The only thing not hurting is my fingers. Otherwise there&#39;s this stabbing pain throughout my entire body.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Who am I? I&#39;m a soldier.<br> Where am I? Am I in the Scutari base camp?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> What the heck?

I got shot. I got shot in the chest and stomach, and the bullets passed through my back. And then I broke my arms and legs when I fell. And my head and face, too.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> The Russians got me.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> May the Ottoman Empire be victorious. Death to the invaders. I need to keep fighting. I can&#39;t face my brothers in this state.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> ...I can&#39;t move a muscle. What&#39;s going on with me?<br> Am I a goner? Ahhh...it hurts.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Nothing changes even as time goes by.<br> The pain&#39;s not going away.

Everyone is entitled to his or her interests, whatever they may be.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> But it is inappropriate to force those interests on others. Understand?</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> So, what kind of dream did you see?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Well, here&#39;s what happened...</p><hr><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> That...</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> It is natural for things that interest you to appear in your dreams. You should study neurophysiology more.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Wait a minute...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> That&#39;s not from your memory, Nightingale?</p><hr><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> My memory?</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> No. You mentioned that you saw me from a male soldier&#39;s perspective.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> That could not be a memory from my lifetime.<br> Obviously.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> But...the fact that you have taken an interest in me...</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> Does that mean you have taken an interest in nursing, treatment, and sanitation?</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> Excellent.<br> In that case...</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> Hello.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> Thank you all for gathering today.<br> I, Florence Nightingale, am extremely pleased.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> You have gathered here today because you all value human life, and all of you have sacrificed on behalf of others. It is my sincere belief that we can have a meaningful, productive discussion.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> For the sake of all human life.<br> For Fujimaru, who has also shown interest.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> And, of course, for each of us as well.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> I&#39;m looking forward to hearing everyone&#39;s input.</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong><br> Likewise, Miss Nightingale.</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong><br> I am yet inexperienced as a practitioner of medicine, but I hope to be of some small assistance.</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong><br> Above all, I would like to learn more, as well.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> ... (Nods)</p><p><strong>Fionn mac Cumhaill:</strong><br> Hm. I thought this was simply a gathering of beautiful women. Seems I was mistaken.</p><p><strong>Fionn mac Cumhaill:</strong><br> Still, this isn&#39;t terrible. An angel in a white nurse&#39;s outfit, a black-haired beauty, and one very sprightly girl.</p><p><strong>Fionn mac Cumhaill:</strong><br> Ah, what a wonderful selection. A buffet of beauties...the cream of the crop. This isn&#39;t just about being surrounded by beauty; it&#39;s like a harem!</p><p><strong>Fionn mac Cumhaill:</strong><br> Ah, my apologies.<br> I got a bit overexcited. Just a joke!</p><p><strong>Fionn mac Cumhaill:</strong><br> This is a gathering for those who want to save people, right?</p><p><strong>Fionn mac Cumhaill:</strong><br> Well, then I have every reason to be here. I do have a Noble Phantasm that can save lives, after all!</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> ... (Nods)</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> Um!</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> I don&#39;t really get it, but we&#39;re just here to talk about how to save people, right?</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> Then leave it to me! I have the guidance of the Buddha, so you&#39;re in good hands!</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> Aw, if I&#39;d known there was a support group like this,<br> I would have dragged Touta here, too.</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> So, what are we going to talk about first?<br> The health benefits of fasting?</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> ... (Nods deeply)</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou, fooouuu...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Y-yes, Fou.<br> I sense an indescribable feeling in the air.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I thought this was just discussion group for Servants who have recovery skills...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> But it feels more like they&#39;re anxious and getting pumped up to go into the simulator for combat training...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> This is a bit tense for a discussion group...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> A-a just point...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Nightingale&#39;s hosting this?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes, Senpai. It appears that Nightingale had approached everyone earlier.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> If I may ask...um...is it appropriate to call Sanzang someone with recovery skills?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I don&#39;t believe she has any skills like that.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Seems a bit off the mark, yeah.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> That&#39;s totally wrong...</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Y-yes...and it appears that Fionn believes that everyone but himself is female...</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> Devotion to helping others is my creed. I search the battlefields after overcoming many obstacles.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> All the injured and sick must be saved.<br> Yes... Life is precious. I must save all lives.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> And to do so, I must let go of all that holds me back or makes me hesitate. Yes...and that&#39;s why...</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> First and foremost, hygiene is key.<br> Good hygiene is a bare minimum requirement.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> All affected body parts and the surrounding environment must be sanitary. Uncleanliness is the enemy. It is the enemy of all medical practices.</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong><br> Life is precious.<br> And hygiene is indeed very important.</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong><br> Very admirable, Miss Nightingale.<br> Truly you are a noble Heroic Spirit.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> ... (Nods)</p><p><strong>Fionn mac Cumhaill:</strong><br> Of course, clean water is also important. Any water I pour from these hands of mine becomes water of life...</p><p><strong>Fionn mac Cumhaill:</strong><br> But yes, water should be clean. That also helps lovely flowers bloom. I agree, my wonderful ladies.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> ... (Nods)</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> Eh? What? Clean? Are you talking about washing or cleaning up after yourself?</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> I like it when things get cleaned, too.</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> Whenever I go to an inn, the first thing I do is clean the dust off the bed!</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> Of course...my disciples always said my room was too messy.</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> Buuut I really do like it when things are clean!<br> I&#39;d even clean up after myself if someone made me!</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> ... (Nods deeply)</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou, fooou!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Senpai, this is...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> It&#39;s like they get it wrong,then do an about-face and get it right somehow.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Nightingale looks satisfied.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Right, Senpai.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> As unbelievable as it may be, they seem to be on the same page. At least this is a productive conversation!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> All coincidence!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Are they even talking about the same things?</p><hr><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> I ask myself\uFF1AHow many patients can I save with these hands of mine?</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> I am a nurse, not a doctor. There are some out there who say that medicine should be left to doctors.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> Sterilizing and disinfecting is sure to increase the chances of survival for the wounded and ill.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> So many lives are in our hands before they ever reach the doctors.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> ...Yes, there were too many...</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> That is why I advocate sterilization so much.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> Treatment. Nursing. Maintaining hygiene. These are the weapons that we use to defeat the threat of injury and illness.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> We are here to save every life we can.</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong><br> Wonderful argument.<br> Hygiene is also important in the world of alchemy.</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong><br> When doing biomedical experiments, the patient&#39;s cleanliness and health management are crucial.<br> The same is true in medicine, of course.</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong><br> But for you to focus on that subject, and advocate it to spread the word... You really must love humans.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> ... (Nods)</p><p><strong>Fionn mac Cumhaill:</strong><br> I completely understand!</p><p><strong>Fionn mac Cumhaill:</strong><br> It&#39;s the same kind of joy I feel when I come across a beautiful stream while I&#39;m hunting deep in the forest!</p><p><strong>Fionn mac Cumhaill:</strong><br> The delightful sounds of a babbling brook, so like the finest instrument...the sunlight kissing the surface of the water to make it glisten...ah, exquisite!</p><p><strong>Fionn mac Cumhaill:</strong><br> Just like when I meet a beautiful woman for the first time!</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> ... (Nods)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> (Eh!? Is that really something to nod at in agreement, Nightingale?)</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> A brook? You&#39;re talking about a river?<br> I love bathing in water! It feels sooo good!</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> But...when you talk about a river, I think of fish. Oh, but I&#39;m a disciple of the Buddha though, so I don&#39;t eat meat.</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> But I love to watch them. Fishes have these beady eyes that make them sooo cute!</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> ... (Nods deeply)</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou, fooouuu...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I&#39;m sort of confused about what Nightingale&#39;s been nodding at here tonight.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> A-anyway, it doesn&#39;t sound like anybody&#39;s on the same page, but somehow the conversation is still going!</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> And now...</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> Let&#39;s continue our discussion. Well, I would like to, but perhaps we should take a short break.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> It&#39;s time for our practical training.<br> Everyone, ready yourselves.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> To save the injured and sick, sometimes the use of force is necessary. Especially in the face of a threat that may increase the number of patients.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> It is very important.</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong><br> Ah, combat training.<br> The medical ward may turn into a battlefield, it seems.</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong><br> Some superstitious people have gone deranged after seeing medicine practiced, thinking it to be a ritual of the devil, and attacked the practitioners.</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong><br> So in situations like that...yes...the use of force is necessary.</p><p><strong>Fionn mac Cumhaill:</strong><br> Oh? Is it time for me to demonstrate my valor?<br> Perfect!</p><p><strong>Fionn mac Cumhaill:</strong><br> Honestly, I was starting to think it was time for me to change my flirting approac\u2013err, I mean the topic!<br> Good timing!</p><p><strong>Fionn mac Cumhaill:</strong><br> Heh. Then let&#39;s do it! I, Fionn mac Cumhaill,<br> shall show off my glorious form!</p><p><strong>Fionn mac Cumhaill:</strong><br> I&#39;m sure it&#39;ll drive the ladies wild!</p><p><strong>Fionn mac Cumhaill:</strong><br> And, as luck would have it, I don&#39;t see my annoying subordinate here to mess it up for me!</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> Eh? What?<br> Battle? Huh? Why?</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> I-I&#39;m going to participate too!?<br> I&#39;m beyond surprised!</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> Please head to the training site.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br><span style="font-size:25px;"> IMMEDIATELY!</span></p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fooou!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Oh, are we going to battle in the simulator!?<br> Senpai...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Leave it to me!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Yeah, just let them do whatever they want at this point.</p><hr><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> [\u2642 Mister /\u2640\uFE0F Miss} Fujimaru. You will be playing the role of my subordinate this time. Understood?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Y-yes, ma&#39;am.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I&#39;ll do it if you tell me...</p><hr><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> Ready to treat!<br> Repeat!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Ready to treat!</p><hr><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> Very good. Now let&#39;s go.<br> Miss Mash, I leave the operations to you.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Senpai.<br> U-um...g-good luck!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> ...Good work.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> Now we shall resume our discussion.<br> Please take your seats. Quickly.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Y-yes...<br> Senpai...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> The meeting continues, huh?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I-I might be a little tired.</p><hr><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> ...?</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> What is the matter?<br> You are looking pale.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> Ah, I see. Have you by chance...not had adequate sleep, or not had a proper, balanced meal?</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> This is a problem.<br> You are therefore injured.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> Change of plans. I will begin treatment. First: sterilization. Then we will maintain the hygienic state.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> Rest assured, [\u2642 Mister /\u2640\uFE0F Miss} Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> I will save your life...even if I must first kill you to do so.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> ...I guarantee it.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> W-waitaminute!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> No, no...no!!!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> U-um, you have it wrong, Nightingale.<br> Senpai is neither injured nor sick!</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> Mash.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Y-yes?</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> You look pale as well.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> !!!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> N-no...that is not true... Not true at all!<br> I am not hurt nor am I sick!</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> I will treat you as well.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Nightingale&#39;s...probably...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> She&#39;s more intense than usual!</p><hr><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou, fooou!</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> Name: Fujimaru.<br> Place of employment: Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> Breathing, pulse...all normal. No loss of limbs.<br> No issues with the special nervous system, either.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> Very good.<br> There are no issues.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Hmph.<br> Special nerves, you say?</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong><br> To you, even the structure the mages call magical circuits is just a type of nerve.</p><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong><br> I see you have had quite the eventful day.</p><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong><br> Is this all because someone got a glimpse of your life and you panicked? You, the angel of steel...panic?</p><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong><br> I caught a glimpse of something rare.<br> Haha, thank you for that.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> ...You.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> I&#39;ll thank you to refrain from superfluous talk. It&#39;s not just Master...this place is overrun with the wounded and potentially ill.</p><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong><br> Don&#39;t mind me.<br> Just keep focusing on Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong><br> I&#39;m sure a time will come when your help is needed.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> Your words confuse me.<br> I do not comprehend all of what you say...</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> But I am a nurse.<br> Nothing more, nothing less.</p><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong><br> Hmph.</p><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong><br> Many Heroic Spirits have arisen from human history! Many heroes are men and women of dauntless courage and battlefield valor!</p><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong><br> But those who heal wounds...Heroic Spirits of salvation. There are not many of those.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> I still do not understand.<br> Why not speak in your own native language?</p><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong><br> Heh.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> ...And he flees once again.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> Heroic Spirit of salvation...<br> That is quite the overstatement.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> I am simply one who takes joy in treating and nursing others. And at the same time...</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> I am also saddened when I see Fujimaru hurt and suffering.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Ah!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Good morning, Senpai. It&#39;s a nice morning.<br> Did you sleep well last night?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I think I dreamed of an argument...or...something...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Hm???</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> What about you, Mash?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I slept very well.<br> All of my vitals are good.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Um, breakfast is ready.<br> Shall we head to the cafeteria?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Actually...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I woke up early, so I helped out Emiya and Boudica in the kitchen today.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Oh, that&#39;s good.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Okay, let&#39;s go to the cafeteria!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes, Senpai.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Good health comes from a good night&#39;s sleep and a proper, nutritious meal, right!?</p><h2 id="fighting-for-someone" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#fighting-for-someone" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Fighting for Someone</h2><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Welcome back, Senpai!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Welcome back, everyone!<br> Great job out there!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I can see the minute Singularity shrinking even as we speak.

Of that, I&#39;m certain.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> But...</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> ...enemy or not, to do that would be to cause injury with my own hands.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> And nothing could be further from what I want.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> Listen, Commander, that others think of me as a small army unto myself does not make me an officer.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> I&#39;m not here because I want to win wars.<br> All I want is for the fighting to stop.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> I...</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> I want to save lives.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> As long as I can do that,<br> I don&#39;t care about the rest...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Nightingale...</p><hr><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> ...(Gasp!)</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> Nnn, I can&#39;t remember how I got here.<br> Weren&#39;t we just fighting golems?</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> Are we back in Chaldea now? We are, aren&#39;t we?<br> What have I been doing...?</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> You were telling us how you aren&#39;t a soldier.<br> That is certainly true, of course, but... Hmm.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> I knew it. Something is wrong with her Spirit Origin, Master.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> I see.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> Yes, I must not be feeling well. I will go rest.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Nightingale?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Nightingale!?</p><p><strong>Gentleman:</strong><br> ...Are you listening to me, Florence?</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> Yes. I&#39;m listening.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> We were just talking about the front line&#39;s medical supply situation. I need your help, Sidney.</p><p><strong>Sidney Herbert:</strong><br> Oh for... I knew it! You aren&#39;t listening to me at all, Florence! Do you even realize where you are!?</p><p><strong>Sidney Herbert:</strong><br> This is London! The capital of the entire British Empire! You aren&#39;t on the battlefield anymore, Florence.</p><p><strong>Sidney Herbert:</strong><br> But it&#39;s clear to me that your heart is still there.<br> Just look at you.</p><p><strong>Sidney Herbert:</strong><br> I can&#39;t believe you&#39;re wearing an army uniform.<br> You don&#39;t even work for them...</p><p><strong>Sidney Herbert:</strong><br> I won&#39;t ask what happened while you were there,<br> but this is London, Florence. London.</p><p><strong>Sidney Herbert:</strong><br> Do you understand?<br> You can&#39;t go around behaving like this.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> ...I dress this way for a reason.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> You may find it strange. Maybe it is strange.<br> But I&#39;m fighting too, just like those soldiers.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> I&#39;ll never stop fighting against the illness and injury plaguing our world. This uniform is more than appropriate for that.</p><p><strong>Sidney Herbert:</strong><br> You&#39;ll never stop fighting...?</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> That&#39;s right.</p><p><strong>Sidney Herbert:</strong><br> Ahh...</p><p><strong>Sidney Herbert:</strong><br> Don&#39;t do this to yourself anymore, Florence.<br> Please. I&#39;m begging you.</p><p><strong>Sidney Herbert:</strong><br> You haven&#39;t been the Angel of Crimea for a long time now. You don&#39;t have to keep fighting any longer.</p><p><strong>Sidney Herbert:</strong><br> It&#39;s time to focus on your own life now.<br> What about... What about marriage?</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> Sidney?</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> What in the world are you talking about?<br> You know nobody can get married on their own.</p><p><strong>Sidney Herbert:</strong><br> ...That&#39;s not what I mean, and you know it.</p><p><strong>Sidney Herbert:</strong><br> How long are you going to keep pretending not to know?</p><p><strong>Sidney Herbert:</strong><br> I haven&#39;t been helping solely out of the goodness of my heart, Florence. Everything I&#39;ve done has been for you...</p><p><strong>Sidney Herbert:</strong><br> For years now, I...</p><p><strong>Sidney Herbert:</strong><br> I&#39;ve always lo\u2013</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> No.<br> This is wrong. It&#39;s a lie.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Sidney Herbert was my friend. He was already married.<br> This conversation never happened. It couldn&#39;t have.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> No. It&#39;s not just that.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> In all my life, nobody ever told me they loved me...</p><p><strong>Voice:</strong><br> I see.</p><p><strong>Voice:</strong><br> I always thought your way of life was...bizarre, but now, you&#39;ve started seeing cracks in your own facade.</p><p><strong>Voice:</strong><br> Heh.<br> Fascinating.</p><p><strong>Voice:</strong><br> But...I&#39;m not about to let you dig your own grave.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> You have horrid taste in hobbies.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> Do you always go around spying on women while they&#39;re sleeping?</p><p><strong>Count of Monte Cristo:</strong><br> ...Hmph.</p><p><strong>Count of Monte Cristo:</strong><br> Most Servants don&#39;t sleep at all, let alone dream.</p><p><strong>Count of Monte Cristo:</strong><br> That you are here, now, doing both makes plain that something is wrong with your Spirit Origin.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Count of Monte Cristo:</strong><br> Generally speaking, all of Chaldea&#39;s Servants are linked to Master. It&#39;s no wonder that sometimes lines may get a little blurred.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> How dare you say that to me?</p><p><strong>Count of Monte Cristo:</strong><br> Something like this has happened to you before, hasn&#39;t it?</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> That wasn&#39;t me. It was Fujimaru who...</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> Yes. It has.</p><p><strong>Count of Monte Cristo:</strong><br> Nice to see you be direct about it.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> It&#39;s clear what is going on here.<br> There&#39;s no point in denying it.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> ...I must be mentally injured.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Heroic Spirits...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> ...are usually created when a human being ascends beyond their humanity. At this point, they have yet to be assigned a class.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> For one thing, the very concept of classes only arose as a byproduct of the Heroic Spirit Summoning Ritual.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Naturally, Chaldea&#39;s summoning system follows the same principles, typically assigning each Heroic Spirit one of the seven classes.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> But there are, of course, exceptions to this rule. Most potential problems can be avoided if there is an appropriate Extra class to which the Heroic Spirit can be assigned...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> ...but there may also be times when a Heroic Spirit is forced into a class for which they may not be fully suited.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Such cases can certainly become cause for distortion of one sort of another.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Uh... And that means what, exactly?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Could you try that again, only way, waaay simpler?</p><hr><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> ...The Ms. Nightingale we know is a Berserker.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> She is clearly a fighter, with her struggles to save lives as a nurse now manifesting in more literal terms.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> But is that who she truly is? Was she always so obstinate during her life as a human woman?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Or is the fierce devotion we see in her a caricature of her true self, exaggerated to fit her Berserker class?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> If the latter, she will continue to strain her mind and Spirit Origin for the length of her materialization.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Then, I&#39;ve been forcing her to be something she&#39;s not all this time...</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> N-not necessarily!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I know that in my case, I never felt like I was under any strain.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> So maybe it&#39;s similar for\u2013</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> As a Demi-Servant, Ms. Kyrielight,<br> your circumstances are even more unusual.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Thus, I&#39;m afraid your argument may not hold much water in this case.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Ugh, not again, Holmes. You really can be kind of a twat sometimes, you know that?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Can I now?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> You don&#39;t have to put it like that. Summoning a Heroic Spirit with a mind of their own has always been a huge deal.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> And it&#39;s especially difficult to maintain a contract with a Berserker. This is KNOWN.</p><p><strong>Count of Monte Cristo:</strong><br> ...It makes no difference to me.</p><p><strong>Count of Monte Cristo:</strong><br> Let&#39;s go, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Wha\u2013</p><p><strong>Count of Monte Cristo:</strong><br> Take care of [\u2642 his /\u2640\uFE0F her} body, girl.<br> Er, Mash Kyrielight.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> W-wait! What are you talking about, Count!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Ah! Senpai!</p><p><strong>Sidney Herbert:</strong><br> Ah, [\u2642 Mr. /\u2640\uFE0F Miss} Fujimaru!<br> Excellent timing!</p><p><strong>Sidney Herbert:</strong><br> Please, would you say something to Florence?<br> I can&#39;t seem to get through to her myself.</p><p><strong>Sidney Herbert:</strong><br> But maybe she&#39;ll listen to you,<br> since you&#39;re one of her colleagues.</p><p><strong>Sidney Herbert:</strong><br> Go on! Please, say something!</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> J-just a minute!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> What is this place...</p><hr><p><strong>Count of Monte Cristo:</strong><br> You are seeing her mind as it is now.<br> Normally you would only see this in your dreams.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> So this is Nightingale&#39;s...</p><hr><p><strong>Count of Monte Cristo:</strong><br> That&#39;s right.</p><p><strong>Sidney Herbert:</strong><br> Are you all right, [\u2642 Mr. /\u2640\uFE0F Miss} Fujimaru?<br> Your eyes seemed to glaze over for a moment.</p><p><strong>Sidney Herbert:</strong><br> Please, you have to talk to Florence.<br> She needs to rest up and return to her normal life.</p><p><strong>Sidney Herbert:</strong><br> She only just got back from the war, and she&#39;s still intent on fighting. She can&#39;t keep going like this.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Um...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I&#39;m sorry, do I know you?</p><hr><p><strong>Count of Monte Cristo:</strong><br> He&#39;s nobody.</p><p><strong>Count of Monte Cristo:</strong><br> Remember, she&#39;s a Berserker. Most of her rational mind was sealed away when she materialized.</p><p><strong>Count of Monte Cristo:</strong><br> Ordinary people could never keep the fires of battle raging in their hearts at all times, but that&#39;s not the case for Berserkers.</p><p><strong>Count of Monte Cristo:</strong><br> However, that of course comes at a cost.</p><p><strong>Count of Monte Cristo:</strong><br> There&#39;s something that builds up deep down inside Berserkers over time.</p><p><strong>Count of Monte Cristo:</strong><br> Especially in the ones who still speak with some semblance of sanity!</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Count of Monte Cristo:</strong><br> It becomes twisted, warped, distorted.<br> At times, it can even manifest.</p><p><strong>Count of Monte Cristo:</strong><br> Sometimes, it appears as a monster who wants nothing more than to follow its destructive impulses and lay waste to everything around it...</p><p><strong>Count of Monte Cristo:</strong><br> ...and sometimes, it embodies reason in the shape of an old friend!</p><p><strong>Sidney Herbert:</strong><br> She needs to rest now.<br> She shouldn&#39;t push herself anymore.</p><p><strong>Sidney Herbert:</strong><br> Come now, Florence, think about it.<br> There&#39;s no reason to do this to yourself.</p><p><strong>Sidney Herbert:</strong><br> Don&#39;t you agree, [\u2642 Mr. /\u2640\uFE0F Miss} Fujimaru!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Maybe you&#39;re right.</p><hr><p><strong>Sidney Herbert:</strong><br> Of course I am!</p><p><strong>Sidney Herbert:</strong><br> So she should stop this right\u2013</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> But not yet.</p><hr><p><strong>Sidney Herbert:</strong><br> What was that...?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I want to keep fighting beside her until the very end.</p><hr><p><strong>Sidney Herbert:</strong><br> What!?</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> ...So that&#39;s your wish, Fujimaru?</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> Very well then, I accept your request. I will return to the battlefield to save as many lives as I can.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> If helping those in need requires me to do violence, then so be it.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> Good grief. I guess you&#39;re no better than me in some ways, Commander.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> Your desire to remain on the battlefield with me can&#39;t be healthy. I must cure you of it...some day.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Works for me.</p><hr><p><strong>Count of Monte Cristo:</strong><br> I see your appearance has changed.<br> Not bad.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> So it has. I didn&#39;t mean for my hair to come undone...but perhaps it suits who I am now.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> If I&#39;m to embrace my Berserker self...then I must admit this is who I am.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> A wild woman, hair untamed, saving every life she can without regard for her own safety.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> This is who I truly am right now.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> All right then, Commander. No...Master.<br> First, I&#39;ll need your help with something.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> The temporary excision of this fragment of rationality masquerading as an old friend.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You got it!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Let the healing begin!</p><hr><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> Good. Very well then...</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> Start the treatment!!!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> Good morning.<br> ...I see you have more or less awoken on schedule today.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> It&#39;s been a week since your last morning exam, so I&#39;d like you to come to the infirmary for a follow-up.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> Mash Kyrielight is already on standby there,<br> so do try to hurry.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> Now, if you&#39;ll excuse me.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Nightingale!</p><hr><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> Yes?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...G-good morning.</p><hr><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> Yes, it is a good morning.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> ...Thank you again for fighting by my side, Master.</p>', 511);
