Last time, I really did not consider that Anne as she is would truly undergo Ascension too. I was able to accept tearing off her skirt and stockings to put into that feeling of revenge. Although I even like skirts, I also really love waists and bare legs that nicely reach that thickness. It is a swimsuit event this time after all, right?</p><p>Last time, I was imagining Anne &amp; Mary\u2019s golden age that included the time when they were pirates, but this time, these women themselves recognize that they have these transient lives as Servants, finishing their once human lives after they were clearly arrested, and that became the premise of these designs. I attached to their wrists some shackles as their collars, of which one of them has each other\u2019s hair so that they can be together even when they die separately.</p><p>Mary\u2019s additional weapon\u2026 well, I wonder if it was something that was impossible to exist if it was from that era\u2026 so I guess it became a fictional weapon that came from something floating in my mind. Perhaps during Mary\u2019s lifetime, it was a product stolen from the site that manufactured and dispatched only one of said weapon and was made for rich people, and although her heart was unusually drawn to it and she wanted to wear it on her person, it was heavy, easy to break and hard to shoot and kill with, and it was difficult to repair those peculiarities, so it seems that there was no opportunity to make use of a little bit of that item up to the very end when her life was taken into custody.</p><p>Even so, it is different right now after Mary died. Having pulled it out from her memories as something joyful in her mind, it is probably that sort of feeling, among other things, that makes her start taking it out completely to her heart\u2019s content compared to when she was not up to the task of using it during those times. Naturally, during the times when she does battle, it breaks every time she uses her Noble Phantasm, so it is a weapon similar to garbage that does not even have a great Mystery behind it. Given that she can repair it as many times as she likes, do you not think that it is probably not satisfying for her to smash it apart when she is using it without any sense of hesitation?</p><p>In the picture of Anne &amp; Mary\u2019s Final Ascension, these two women are allowed to remove their shackles, and they put their hands on top of each other\u2019s; this unlikely scene is only after such things are reached. A large quantity of gold coins and a pirate flag (although frankly, that pirate flag is almost unable to be seen) are laid out underneath their buttocks, and it was fun for them to enjoy themselves a lot. Also, they are wearing the smiles called tomorrow. Because Mary is satisfied with this and that, she is not holding onto her weapons. But Anne cannot relinquish her weapon. Even if she shows a smile on her face, the fact is that she is still anxious. Even if she is grasping this as an ephemeral dream, it is nevertheless the embodiment of a lingering attachment she does not want to lose this time.</p><p>Although, since a heavy story such as that does not suit Anne &amp; Mary as they are now, well, think of that as further nonsense. If that is a heavy story, then let us try discussing instead about how nice is meat that seems heavy and looks soft - hey, let us try to stick to that. Right, it is an important point for meat to seem heavy.</p><p>Why is that Anne\u2019s established body weight? Because that is how it is posed. Oh, after all, since she has a tall stature, an excellent body build, and splendid muscles as well, even with a light estimate, she has to be at least - no, being responsible for somewhat sensitive talks like this must go through a different section, so I am a bit reluctant to really answer that, alright?
