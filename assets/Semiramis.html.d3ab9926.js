Semiramis was born between the Goddess Dekerto and Oannes, a mortal. It has been told that Semiramis had been abandoned by Derketo when she was a baby, but doves bundled around her in order to warm her up \u2013 perhaps because half of her was divine \u2013 and they reared her up until she was taken into the care of a shepherd at the age of 10. Afterwards, she was married to Onnes, a veteran army general, but she was forcibly snatched away from Onnes by King Ninus, who was charmed by her beauty. Semiramis made many suggestions to King Ninus, and although she deepened his favour in her, she killed King Ninus via poison several days after she became Queen Consort\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>It has also been told that at the end of her reign, Semiramis was either murdered by her son or that she was given an oracle that the imperial throne would be inherited by her son, so she transformed her appearance into a dove and took off to the skies.</p><p>In addition, the Hanging Gardens was originally not Semiramis\u2019 work.
