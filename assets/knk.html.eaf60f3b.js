For a guest to arrive here... Is this some kind of mistake?</p><p><strong>F\uFF1A???:</strong><br> If you&#39;re dreaming, go back to where you came from.</p><p><strong>F\uFF1A???:</strong><br> This is a place without boundaries.<br> You have a name, so you shouldn&#39;t be here.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Well, I woke up here...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I didn&#39;t come here because I wanted to...</p><hr><p><strong>F\uFF1A???:</strong><br> You didn&#39;t want to be here?<br> In that case... Hehe, sorry.</p><p><strong>F\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Looks like our connection was made from this side. Let me apologize while I can, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>F\uFF1A???:</strong><br> I&#39;m asleep and thus unaware of what&#39;s going on outside. But I can take a guess.</p><p><strong>F\uFF1A???:</strong><br> I&#39;m sure it&#39;s just another hack-and-slash type of case without a hint of romance.</p><p><strong>F\uFF1A???:</strong><br> What a disaster, busy Master. But it&#39;s a good thing to have things you can do, things you must do.</p><p><strong>F\uFF1A???:</strong><br> ...Yes, rather than talk about myself, I would love to talk more about your future, but...</p><p><strong>F\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Too bad, the night is almost over. Seems like this dream is about to end.</p><p><strong>F\uFF1A???:</strong><br> If we meet again, could you please call me by my name?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Hi, I know it&#39;s only midnight, but good morning, Fujimaru. Sorry to wake you up.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> However, it&#39;s an emergency, so I contacted you anyway. I&#39;m sorry, but please come to the Command Room immediately.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Senpai!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou, Foou!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Good evening, Mash.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes, good evening, Senpai. This will be a night shift, so thank you for all your hard work.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Good morning, Mash.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Good morning... Meaning, you were already sleeping, Senpai?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I think it&#39;s good to sleep early. It means you&#39;re someone with dreams and hopes.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> \u2014Oops, now is not the time for greetings.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Doctor Roman requested an urgent dispatch.<br> Hurry to the Command Room, Master!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Right, let&#39;s get going!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> ...Hey, isn&#39;t it kind of quiet?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Now that you mention it...<br> Chaldea does feel kind of empty...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Usually, you&#39;ll see a lot of non-assigned Servants strolling through these hallways...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> But tonight of all nights, we didn&#39;t run into anyone...</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Ah, both of you are here.<br> That saves me time in explaining.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Now, then, please look at the monitor. Around Japan on the world map.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Is it Singularity F? I thought we already recovered the Holy Grail at those coordinates.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Not Fuyuki, but next to it. You can see a strange distortion, right?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> It&#39;s been under observation for several days.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> At first, I thought it was a small error caused by the fluctuation of Singularity F&#39;s repair.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> But it wouldn&#39;t disappear even after a considerate amount of time. Then I tried changing Sheba&#39;s observation angle...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> There are signs of life!<br> But these coordinates should have been incinerated!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Oh, and that&#39;s not all.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I only detected a few life forms,<br> but I picked up countless moving objects.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> On top of that, no matter how much I adjust Sheba, I can&#39;t get a read on the scale and era of these coordinates.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> It&#39;s a complete black box. We won&#39;t know what&#39;s going on unless we Rayshift there.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> So, is it a new Singularity?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I&#39;m sorry, but I can&#39;t even be sure about that. Humanity has been destroyed, and the outside world incinerated.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> At least before 2018, when humans were still alive.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> The cause of such atrocities, what made them possible, was our loss of coordinates called the Foundations of Humanity\u2014</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Historical events that became the essential support pillars of our human history...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...such as those that occurred in France and Rome.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> In response, Chaldea prevented the collapse of these foundations by Rayshifting into them from outside the time flow.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Even if it&#39;s already incinerated in the proper timeline, Chaldea can Rayshift to a time before the destruction, and prevent its collapse.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Fujimaru, just think of what you&#39;ve been doing as repairing a completely incinerated scroll.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> However, these coordinates are different.<br> They don&#39;t exist in any history.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Think of it as something that&#39;s lost. A hole eaten away by bugs.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> As usual, right?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Yes, simply put, that&#39;s exactly it!<br> You&#39;re really reliable, Fujimaru!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I was ready to explain a lot of things,<br> but in short, you should take a chance on everything!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Hmm, Doctor. I request further explanation on what you just said.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> There are few signs of life, but multiple moving objects. What does that mean?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Let me explain it! Even if it&#39;s the night shift, I can still give you a lecture with my glamorous beauty!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Who am I? I am the lady who loves those green cubes, everybody&#39;s favorite shop owner, Da Vinci!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Good evening. It&#39;s a nice night out.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> It&#39;s the perfect night for a ghost story. Not that any of them happened at Chaldea.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Are you kidding me with Mona Lisa?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Oh, stop throwing silver embers at me! It&#39;s my bad! I was just having a little bit of fun!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> ...But that Craft Essence was pretty well made, right? My only regret is that I couldn&#39;t write the explanation in mirrored letters.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Good evening, Da Vinci. Please give us your explanation.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> They are not alive, yet they are moving around... In other words, that place is full of zombies.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Well, it&#39;s not like you will be surprised by them. Zombies were in France, too.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> But there&#39;s another problem, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> If the seven Singularities are like stains on the scroll we call human history, that fake Singularity is like a hole in that scroll.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> I don&#39;t understand how it happened, but it&#39;s luring the Servants and trapping them in there.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Trapping the Servants?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Speaking of which, did you notice that Chaldea is a lot more quiet than usual?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> The Servants that Fujimaru successfully summoned and formed a contract with...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> They&#39;re receiving magical energy from Chaldea and setting up anchors for their existence all around this base.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> You can call it a temporary incarnation.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> If they keep using magical energy from their<br> Master each time they&#39;re summoned into battle, Fujimaru would be all dried up already.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> So, in order to lessen the burden cast on Fujimaru,</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Chaldea is using 40% of its power to sustain the contract with each Servant.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> As long as Grand Order is still in effect, these Servants have made Chaldea their home.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I didn&#39;t know...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I had a vague idea...</p><hr><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Yes, yes. Oh, just so you know, I&#39;m different. Even if Chaldea&#39;s light has gone out, I can still sustain my body.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Ahem!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> About those Servants. A few of them disappeared when this distortion was observed.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> They all headed to this distortion of their own free will... And then they never came back.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Never came back... So they weren&#39;t eliminated? That means...they stayed there?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Exactly. Their contracts with Fujimaru are still intact.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> The Heroic Spirits who Rayshifted to that strange hole are either staying there of their own free will, or\u2014</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It&#39;s possible that they&#39;re trapped and can&#39;t come back.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> That&#39;s everything. This distortion has nothing to do with the Foundation of Humanity.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> It wouldn&#39;t cause any harm even if left as it is... However, it&#39;s also true the Servants are not coming back.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Fujimaru. Mash.<br> I want you to investigate these coordinates.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Rayshifting anywhere other than a Singularity is an exception, and requires the authorization of the former Director, but...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Will you do it?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Of course, Doctor.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> If they are taken, we&#39;ll get them back!</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Thank you. You&#39;re so reliable!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Then we will commence Rayshifting now.<br> You two, start your preparations.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> We don&#39;t know what might happen there.<br> And we won&#39;t be able to send backup.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Please, be careful over there. Oh, and one more thing... This is just a hunch, but...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Perhaps Fujimaru will find the scenery over there very familiar.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> If that&#39;s the case, please show Mash around. She&#39;s never seen anything like that.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ?</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I don&#39;t really get it, but roger!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Familiar scenery?</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> You&#39;ll understand when you get there.<br> Well then, commencing Rayshift!</p><h2 id="encounter" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#encounter" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Encounter</h2><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> A road made of asphalt...<br> High-rises like big walls...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> This is...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I&#39;m sure of it! This is the 21st-century Japan, Senpai!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Look! See? A vending machine that isn&#39;t destroyed!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Even a public phone, and a bus stop, too!<br> Ah, and that thing like a house is a toilet!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The city seems so quiet and the streets are so clean! The example of a perfectly safe city!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Unfortunately, I don&#39;t see any of those so-called convenience stores\u2013 The places that never sleep!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It really is just like what I&#39;ve read...<br> One of my dreams has come true!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> It was your dream?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Ah... Yes. I&#39;m sorry, I got carried away. It&#39;s not that I dreamed of visiting a city in Japan.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Not only Tokyo, but Washington, Moscow, Beijing, Rome, Madrid...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Any one of them would have been fine. I just wanted to visit a major city from the era I live in.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> It seems pretty normal...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Ugh. It&#39;s almost like you&#39;re saying, \u201CWhat&#39;s so special about a city like this?\u201D</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Senpai, did you live in a city like this one? No, I am sure you did.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Please tell me more about it, in detail! Everything from your life in elementary school to high school! Please!</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Hello, test, test.<br> Communication, video feed, both working fine.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Ah, as I thought... Judging from these coordinates and time, I predicted your destination to be a city in Japan.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> But... I didn&#39;t expect it to be such an urban area. This seems pretty fishy to me...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...You&#39;re right. A normal city in a time like this is the most abnormal thing.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The only two normal life-form responses are from Senpai and myself... But I&#39;m also getting some higher-class life-form responses from that building.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> \u2014A big city like this, with this many houses, and still no one in sight.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Building? Oh, that cylindrical one? It sure looks weird...<br> Fujimaru, can you tell us anything about it?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> It&#39;s like a spooky tower.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...I agree.<br> I&#39;m getting chills just looking at it.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> It&#39;s just an apartment.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Just an apartment? But its design is so different than the other buildings surrounding it...</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Anyway, that building is undeniably suspicious. I&#39;m picking up readings of multiple Servants inside as well.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> No obstacles detected from here to the building entrance. Let&#39;s go there and... Wait! Senpai!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> There&#39;s someone around the entrance! It&#39;s\u2014</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I&#39;m picking up multiple strange signals! Residual wills... They&#39;re ghosts!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Looks like a Servant is fighting with them!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Hurry up, Mash!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes, Master!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Wait! I&#39;m not picking up any more ghost readings! They didn&#39;t disperse, they disappeared\u2014</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> As if they were erased with an eraser!<br> That&#39;s a little scary, isn&#39;t it!? What is it!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Servant response, entering our line of sight! Is that\u2014a woman?</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong><br> ...Phew, cheap dream.<br> Its quality is too low to be a nightmare.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Ghosts with skulls as faces? Man, they gotta get with the times.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It&#39;s a girl...in a kimono...holding a knife!<br> Senpai, who is she?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I don&#39;t know her.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> It&#39;s the first time I&#39;ve ever seen her face.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Just as I thought<br> Let&#39;s try to talk to her first...</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong><br> No need. I don&#39;t want to talk to you. It&#39;ll take too long.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Doesn&#39;t matter if you&#39;re good or bad. With this knife in your head, you can say goodbye to this reality.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong><br> You&#39;re the one who stuck your nose in other people&#39;s business, yeah? I am gonna send that nose, along with your head, to where they belong!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Here she comes!<br> I don&#39;t get it, but it&#39;s a battle, Master!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE-</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Battle was interrupted, but...we still don&#39;t know that Servant&#39;s real name, nor its attack pattern!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Doctor, please give us your analysis!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> How can a simple knife cut not only a Servant&#39;s body, but easily cut its armor too?!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...It&#39;s Mystic Eyes. I can&#39;t believe Mystic Eyes of this level still exist in the modern era.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Doctor?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> In the world of Magecraft, magical eyes that can perceive all things mystical are called Mystic Eyes.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> These eyes can project phenomena without casting any sorts of chants or rituals. They just need to look.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> The most popular types are \u201CBinding,\u201D \u201CCompulsion,\u201D \u201CContract,\u201D \u201CFlame,\u201D \u201CIllusion,\u201D and \u201CJinx.\u201D</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Even among them, her eyes are special. The type that can \u201CStop\u201D everything, it&#39;s even more powerful than \u201CPetrification.\u201D</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Her rainbow eyes materialize the concept of death and capture it. If I had to give them a name, I&#39;d call them the Mystic Eyes of Death Perception.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> How incredible! That&#39;s an ability fit for a Divine Spirit! To kill an enemy just by looking at them... Talk about overpowered!</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong><br> ...What&#39;s up with him?<br> He sounded so fake and unimportant...</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong><br> I&#39;m not a Heroic Spirit.<br> I can&#39;t kill anyone just by looking at them.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong><br> All I can do is see death... Lines that trace death. Ummm, like the eventual end of all things.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Would you understand if I say I simply trace the cause, the result of eventual death?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Oh, um, I see... The, uh, lines that trace death... The, the eventual end of all things... Y-Yes...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I&#39;m sorry, I don&#39;t get it at all.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Me neither. It seems to be a highly advanced magical theory, but...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> So you slash a person&#39;s life span?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Senpai, you understand?!</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Huh, that was easy. Hey, you must be a big otaku, right? Disgusting. Absolutely disgusting.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> (Nice, Fujimaru! She looks happy! Really happy!)</p><hr><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Whatever. Hey, you there! The slippery-looking one!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> M-Me?!</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Of course! Who else could it be? Physically, you&#39;re not a complete Servant, right?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> R-Right. I&#39;m a Demi-Servant,<br> so you could say that my base body is human...</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong><br> I see. I thought you were that shadowy bastard&#39;s friend.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong><br> That [\u2642 man /\u2640\uFE0F woman]&#39;s eyes are glittering. I guess that rules out the possibility of being possessed by some weird illusions.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong><br> My bad for attacking you. All right, see ya.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> What? Hold on!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Where do you think you&#39;re going?!</p><hr><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong><br> I am going to tear down this apartment. I can&#39;t just leave it like that.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong><br> It&#39;s crawling with disgusting things inside. If I let it be, it&#39;s gonna cause trouble for the neighbors.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Say, do you guys watch horror movies?<br> You do? Good.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong><br> You know the deal... Things like walking corpses, ghosts you aren&#39;t supposed to see...</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Things like that are running rampant in there... All because of Servants.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> All because of...Servants?</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Yeah. Servants live in that apartment like it&#39;s their own. Thanks to them, it&#39;s all becoming one big block party.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong><br> I mean, Servants are kinda like ghosts, right? If they gain physical bodies, others will get carried away too.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong><br> ...Well, as for myself, I am also showing up as a Servant.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong><br> If you&#39;re a Demi-Servant, I guess that makes me a Pseudo-Servant.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Most likely I had a connection with this building, so I ended up being summoned. It&#39;s really annoying.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> If you&#39;re a Servant, you need a Master...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Will you be okay by yourself?</p><hr><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Who cares? If I vanish, it actually saves me some trouble. At least I don&#39;t have to go through this ordeal.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I don&#39;t know if you&#39;re being frank, or you just don&#39;t care about yourself...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Still, though...<br> There must be a reason why we met here!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> If you don&#39;t have a Master, could you work with Chaldea?</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong><br> ...A reason, you say.<br> This, too, must be my fate... I don&#39;t hate it.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong><br> That one over there is a Master, right? If I help you, that would really make me look like a Servant.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong><br> I&#39;m merely an outsider who was summoned here. I don&#39;t intend on concerning myself with others.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong><br> However, I want to pay back that despicable shadowy bastard...</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou, foou!</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong><br> !</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Fou!? Were you hiding in my shield again?</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong><br> ...Are you kidding me? What is this furball?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You never know when Fou will show up...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Fou is everyone&#39;s favorite Runner!</p><hr><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong><br> ...Ryougi Shiki.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> What?</p><hr><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong><br> That is my name.<br> What&#39;s your name?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Right, this is Master Fujimaru.<br> My name is Mash Kyrielight.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> If we&#39;re exchanging our names like this... Does that mean you&#39;ll help us, Shiki?</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong><br> ...Well, if you think about it, the fact that you&#39;re a Master probably means you&#39;re related to the Servants living here somehow, right?</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong><br> In that case, you&#39;re supposed to be the ones to get rid of them. Good luck. I&#39;ll be giving you a hand too, so don&#39;t worry.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Thank you, Ryougi-chan!</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong><br> You can just call me Ryougi. Aren&#39;t you embarrassed, using \u201Cchan?\u201D</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> ...Do you like cats?</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong><br> No, I don&#39;t.<br> Also, I wouldn&#39;t call that thing a cat.</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong><br> It has good fur and feels really nice, that&#39;s all. It doesn&#39;t even look like one. That&#39;s insulting to cats.</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Oh... I was keeping my mouth shut because she didn&#39;t look like she could take a joke... But I&#39;m glad it all worked out!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Erm... Should I call you Miss Ryougi? You seem to know all about that apartment?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> What was it like inside? Did it turn into a different dimension? It won&#39;t kill them upon entering, right?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> As you can see, Fujimaru is just a human. If the air composition is abnormal then...</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong><br> Ah, you don&#39;t have to worry.<br> Rest assured, it&#39;s the same Ogawa as ever.</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong><br> But there are lots of enemies,<br> and there are some funny traps.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Funny traps?<br> What kind of traps?</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong><br> That will be a surprise. It was a questionable property from the start anyway.</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong><br> Here used to be the grave marker of an old mage who attempted to collect death. A hollow shrine that fused the yin-yang and hell together.</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong><br> People say \u201Cinvestigations start from the bottom,\u201D right?<br> Enjoy the case, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong><br> So once again, rookie Master... Welcome to this 64-story shrine, Ogawa Heim.</p><h2 id="_1st-floor-room-no-1" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_1st-floor-room-no-1" aria-hidden="true">#</a> 1st Floor, Room No.1</h2><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It&#39;s so cold... Something&#39;s not right, Senpai. The thermometer shows normal values, but I feel like we&#39;re inside a freezer...</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong><br> Yeah, absolutely. Since there&#39;s an air conditioner, why don&#39;t you try turning on the heater?</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong><br> Isn&#39;t that right, big guy? Just because your soul becomes cold, that doesn&#39;t mean your body has to be cold too, right?</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> ...Hmm.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Benkei!?<br> Are you living in this room!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Or... Are you imprisoned here, like what the Doctor suggested?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Please answer me, Benkei. Why did you come to this apartment?</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> ...I don&#39;t accept it. I don&#39;t! It&#39;s unforgivable...unforgivable!</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> Abandoned by Heaven, forgotten by the earth, and deceived by the people! Why would you turn away from this respectable life?</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> Instead of training your wisdom, you mastered ugliness, It&#39;s outrageous! I can&#39;t let it be, I have to make a stand!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Servant, Musashibou Benkei is switching to combat mode!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I can&#39;t get a read on this situation, Master!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Let&#39;s attack, Mash!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes... Let&#39;s start a Servant battle!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Let&#39;s attack, Shiki!</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong><br> You don&#39;t have to tell me.<br> Our first opponent is a monk? Talk about a twist of fate!</p><hr><p><strong>--BATTLE-</strong></p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> Ooohhh... Oooohhhhhh... Nghhhhhohhhhhhh!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Benkei...has disappeared.<br> Is he going to be all right?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Hmmm, I&#39;m not sure.<br> When a contract is bound to Chaldea...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> The defeated Spirit Origin doesn&#39;t return to the Throne of Heroes, but to Chaldea instead.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Given some time, he&#39;ll probably return to Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> We still don&#39;t know why he was in that room, but it seems like you just \u201Cfreed\u201D a Servant.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Is that so? He was rather aggressive, but at least we&#39;ve reached a solution.</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong><br> As I thought, there&#39;s nothing here. This is the wrong room. Let&#39;s check the others, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong><br> What? You look sad...<br> Don&#39;t tell me you&#39;re feeling down?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Of course.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I mean... Benkei&#39;s...</p><hr><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong><br> Hey, guys. I should let you know, this apartment&#39;s always been like this, okay?</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong><br> You can feel bad for him, but I can&#39;t do anything if you let that get to you...</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong><br> I mean, if you guys didn&#39;t force them out, they would&#39;ve gone on like that forever.</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong><br> Don&#39;t you think that would&#39;ve been even more tragic?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...That&#39;s right. It&#39;s just as Ryougi says.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> It may be a little violent, but if a Servant attacks us, we&#39;ll have to face them as enemies.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Looks like that&#39;s our best option in this apartment. Do you understand, Mash and Fujimaru?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...Yes I do.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> You&#39;re right, this room is full of pain.</p><hr><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong><br> We have to keep a positive mindset, no matter what. Those imprisoned here all had a negative way of thinking.</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong><br> Let&#39;s keep pace and proceed with our investigation.</p><h2 id="_1st-floor-room-no-2" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_1st-floor-room-no-2" aria-hidden="true">#</a> 1st Floor, Room No.2</h2><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong><br> \u266A\u266A\u266A\u266A\u266A</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Shiki seems to be in a good mood, Senpai...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Humming all the while, with her hands in her pockets, skipping down the hallway...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You&#39;re not feeling well, Mash?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> N-No. I&#39;ve fought against numerous walking corpses till now, but not like this... I mean...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It&#39;s the first time I fought against someone who looked like he was alive until yesterday...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> She looks so happy...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I can even tell that from across a monitor. She looks reluctant but she&#39;s actually the type who enjoys a good fight, isn&#39;t she?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> However, we can&#39;t stay uninformed like this forever.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> To us, it&#39;s a strange world, but to Shiki...it&#39;s a familiar scene. In that case...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Excuse me, Shiki!</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong><br> Hm? What? If you need the restroom, you&#39;ll have to go outside or go inside a room.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> No, that&#39;s not it...<br> This is an apartment, right?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> This place feels cold regardless of the temperature outside. Police officers and residents still walk around despite being dead.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It&#39;s obviously unconventional in modern Japan. In that case, this place must be a magecraft workshop built in secrecy, right?</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong><br> If it were, it wouldn&#39;t be quite so bad... Unfortunately, this apartment was built in public with no secrets.</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong><br> A permit was submitted to the local office, and a normal construction company worked on it.</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong><br> It even asked regular folks to move in. However, now it&#39;s becoming a place no one wants to go near.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...It&#39;s a barrier created using man&#39;s natural instinct to avoid taboos...without a single trace of Magecraft.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> It&#39;s common sense for mages after the 20th century to conceal their workshops in order to avoid detection from the public.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> However, we can&#39;t detect any traces of magical energy from this place.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> If it&#39;s a magecraft workshop, then whoever created it must be really cautious and patient.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> That mage built a building this size to perform a ritual, yet didn&#39;t rely on Magecraft.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> They simply built this place from the ground up, brick by brick, all by themselves. Kind of like building a tower.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Which reminds me of buddhist folklore that talks about children stacking rocks in hell, with all effort and no gain.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Just simply continuing a mundane task without complaint, and without companionship.</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong><br> ...The Children&#39;s Limbo, huh?<br> Indeed, it fits him.</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong><br> But you&#39;re wrong, it&#39;s not a nice place like that. This is simply a building that collects death.</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong><br> Death by natural causes, illness, accidents, and violence. An exhibit hall decorated with various methods of death.</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong><br> Those zombies wandering the hallways, they&#39;re, you know... The previous residents of this building.</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong><br> They&#39;re designed to live one day, and die the next. Even though they already died many years ago.</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong><br> ...I know this might sound obvious, but humans are born with a certain fate.</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong><br> No matter how much you fight back, your eventual end\u2013the cause of your deathwill never change.</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong><br> Those destined to die in an accident, whether they&#39;ve achieved happily ever after,</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong><br> or an abrupt demise, their lives will end in a form of \u201Caccidental death.\u201D</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong><br> ...There used to be a guy who was trying to prove that, and the residents of this apartment were merely \u201Csamples\u201D for his theory.</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong><br> When night falls, they die. When morning comes, they are reborn. No matter what happens, they always die the same way.</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong><br> It&#39;s a loop, no, a retry. Since before you guys came here, people have been coming back to life and dying, endlessly.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> ...How can I say it? It&#39;s...</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...I know how you feel.<br> That system is... How should I put it?</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong><br> Inhumane, is that what you want to say?</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong><br> Hmm. You&#39;re all mages yourselves, and yet... That kind of thing still troubles you?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Fujimaru is not a mage, so [\u2642 he /\u2640\uFE0F she] tends to think differently than those elites at the Mage&#39;s Association.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> But... I don&#39;t understand this building at all. What can they achieve with this kind of experiment?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> There are no results. There is no gain.<br> Even if they&#39;re creating a model case, there&#39;s no goal...</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong><br> You&#39;ll have to ask the creator himself.<br> Although he&#39;s no longer in this world.</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong><br> Anyway, this is now a haunted apartment with zombies walking around.</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong><br> On top of that, ghosts and Servants are starting to show up. The effects are showing up in the outside world.</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong><br> ...Seriously. It&#39;s creepy, but this one-life-one-death world wasn&#39;t supposed to cause trouble for anybody.</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong><br> I mean, what the hell are those Servants?!<br> All of them are in some weird get-ups...</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong><br> Mash, you were lucky that this was a haunted apartment. You would&#39;ve been reported if we were in front of the station.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Reported? Is that because I am not from around here?</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong><br> ...Say, do you know why I only carry a knife around with me?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Ah, so that&#39;s what you mean... You&#39;re right!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Fujimaru, we&#39;re lucky that this Singularity isn&#39;t a perfect recreation of the downtown area.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> If we were in front of a station, just Mash changing into her Servant form would get us in trouble with the police.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I didn&#39;t talk about this a lot, but Chaldea is what you would call \u201Ca secret organization.\u201D</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> You can&#39;t recklessly summon your Servants nor arm Mash in front of people.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> It depends on the city, but Mash&#39;s Servant form could be considered indecent in some places.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> NO WAY!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> You just realized?</p><hr><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong><br> ...I wasn&#39;t talking about her appearance, but her weapon... Anyway...</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong><br> We&#39;re here. There&#39;s no nameplate either, right? I&#39;m sure a Servant is living in this room.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Yes.<br> I can detect a Servant&#39;s Spirit Origin in there.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> What will we do, Master?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Let&#39;s ring the doorbell.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Let&#39;s go inside.</p><hr><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong><br> Right, that&#39;s the spirit.<br> Here is the key. I will give it to you.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...(Gulp)<br> Master, I&#39;ll open the door.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Who on earth is inside this room?</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong><br> Yes, yes, certainly!</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong><br> Welcome, unknown Master!<br> You too, Miss Demi-Servant!</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong><br> The one who moved into this grudge-soaked apartment, of course it is I, Demon Mephistopheles!</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong><br> ...What&#39;s the deal with his scissors?<br> Oh, he knows Mash?</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong><br> This funny guy here is Mash&#39;s big brother or what?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I couldn&#39;t take having a brother like Mephisto! The breakfast table would be a catastrophe!</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong><br> The breakfast table? That&#39;s all you&#39;re worried about? Yes, you&#39;re right, breakfast should be enjoyed quietly.</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong><br> I may look like this, but I&#39;ve cared for stubborn and stinky old guys, too.</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong><br> I&#39;m able to make good and tasty breakfasts, unfortunately, I&#39;m incapable of closing this mouth!</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong><br> Even if you sew it, or zip it, it&#39;s useless! Even without a mouth, I can give you bad news using ventriloquism</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong><br> For example, my neighbor in Room 3. Watanabe, was it? Tormented by his lover, whom he strangled.</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong><br> He&#39;s like a skull, a nervous wreck, malnourished! At<br> 2 o&#39;clock, the time of his crime, the madness begins!</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong><br> Drugs, hanging, wrist-slashing, gas poisoning.<br> Every night he has to escape from his nightmare.</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong><br> His excuses for his own actions are quite unsightly, and yet pleasurable.</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong><br> There is no better spice to make a meal delicious than other people&#39;s misfortune!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> This manner of speaking...this is the real Mephisto! But why are you here?!</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong><br> Oh? Oh, oh, oh!<br> Hmm? Hum, hum, hum...</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong><br> This is the first time I&#39;m meeting you, but how many times have you met me?</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong><br> I knew it!<br> I&#39;ve already caused trouble for you!</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong><br> This is destiny! Conviction, betrayal and satisfaction! Now I understand why I was summoned to Chaldea!</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong><br> Unfortunately, I am different from that thing,<br> the \u201CI\u201D that was summoned in early stages!</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong><br> Hahaha! Hehehehe! And!<br> I am the criminal behind this case!</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong><br> I am the one who invited those ghosts into this apartment!</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong><br> It was also I who infiltrated Chaldea, and lured promising-looking Servants one by one!</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong><br> That was all my handiwork!<br> Yahoo! It worked perfectly!</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong><br> Hmm, but now I have to break the bad news to you. Yes, Mephy is sad!</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong><br> I&#39;ve finally met a good Master like you, and now I have to cut you into pieces.</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong><br> You see, the previous tenant of this room had a bizarre hobby... He would sever the limbs of his loved one every night.</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong><br> He did it to hide the dead body? But get this! He tripped and accidentally killed himself while cutting up the body in the bathroom!</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong><br> It was so hilarious so I took over his job for him.</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong><br> Where is this tenant now you ask?</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong><br> Well, you see, now he&#39;s just in the way, right? I mean, he must be bored to death now that he can&#39;t accidentally kill himself anymore?</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong><br> That&#39;s why I intervened to make it funny. By now, he must have escaped the system, and joined his ghost buddies outside!</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong><br> Now, let&#39;s start! Let&#39;s just start! It&#39;s annoying to explain so let&#39;s just start!</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong><br> I am the demon, the bomber, Mephisto Pheles! The demon who blows up boring daydreams!</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong><br> Wow, I repeated the word demon so many times! But it doesn&#39;t matter!</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong><br> Master and Lady, please be sure to remember this, now!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Mephisto Pheles is in combat mode!<br> Master, what should we do?!</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong><br> What should we do? There&#39;s only one thing to do! Our opponent is ready!</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong><br> Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;m used to handling bombers. I&#39;ll wipe that smirk off his face before the bomb blows up!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE-</strong></p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong><br> Oh... How can this be... To ignore what you&#39;re told is a bad move, a lost cause, extreme uselessness!</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong><br> You killed me, the only one who knows the truth! Now the case is cold, dead people tell no tales. It&#39;s too late!</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong><br> But how should I put it? There are a lot of mystery novels where the perpetrator dies in the beginning, right?</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong><br> You guys, use your heads, and solve this abnormal situation!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Enemy Servant eliminated.<br> Was that really the right move?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Now we have no clues...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Right... Although Mephisto&#39;s words are not really trustworthy, if he really was the cause of this abnormality...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Then we just destroyed the only lead we had...<br> We&#39;re bad detectives.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Let&#39;s visit the next Servant.</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong><br> Oh, you recovered from that pretty fast. Right, that&#39;s not a bad thing.</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong><br> Don&#39;t feel bad, Mash.<br> Eliminating one or two perpetrators won&#39;t be an issue.</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong><br> Didn&#39;t I say \u201Cinvestigations start from the bottom\u201D? The next crime scene is waiting for us, detective.</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Hum... Detective story... So this was a detective story? No, never mind that...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Even if it was self-proclaimed, killing the perpetrator is pretty damaging...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> At least if we&#39;d arrested him, we could&#39;ve interrogated him about this place, and why it attracts ghosts...</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong><br> That&#39;s right! I&#39;m really sorry! I wanted to be useful and use my scissors as much as possible...</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong><br> ...but this time, I had nothing to do, there was no room for me to act! I ended up moving around in vain!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes, until now, I can&#39;t remember you being useful at any time... Basically, you&#39;re totally useless...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Wh-What?!</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong><br> Sc-Scissors guy!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Why did you come out of your room?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> This is Mash&#39;s big brother?!</p><hr><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong><br> There was another one!?<br> Good, I&#39;ll kill you as many times as it takes!</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong><br> Wait, no need for that.<br> The one you defeated is the evil Mephisto.</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong><br> The one here is me, the good Mephisto.<br> Ah, in other words...</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong><br> One of me laments this situation, and the other one enjoys it. But now is not the time to question my conscience.</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong><br> So, if I split my good heart and evil heart apart like this...</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong><br> I can basically clone myself! Oooohhh, UNBELIEVABLE!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Hmm, you did show up as support.</p><hr><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong><br> Of course.<br> Hmm... Fujimaru, was it?</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong><br> From now, I am a loyal Servant of Fujimaru! SO. LOYAL. (LMAO)</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong><br> To prove it, I shall part ways with my evil self and lend a hand to everyone here!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Ah... It seems too good to be true, but...<br> What do you think, Master?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Tell the truth in two lines or less.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Tell us what you know in two lines or less.</p><hr><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong><br> Good decision. You really are good.</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong><br> Only two lines? That&#39;s impossible! But I will try. I am an innocent clown. I merely play the pipe like Hamelin did!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It&#39;s two lines!</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong><br> You can do it if you try.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Hmm. If you call yourself innocent, then you have nothing to do with this fake Singularity, right?</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong><br> Not in the least! To tell you the truth... I&#39;m truly sorry but if you could allow me to get involved, and tone down the rate of ghost-gathering,</p><p>I could make a horror show, incredibly realistic, about half dead, half living, killing and being killed...</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong><br> In two lines!</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong><br> I was summoned by someone else, not via Chaldea&#39;s summoning system, to this tower of resentment.</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong><br> By that guy, his name is... That guy... Grand something. That guy is one class above mine.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> !!!</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong><br> He said to me, \u201CShouldn&#39;t you be on this side?\u201D And he does have a point, so...</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong><br> After that, I split dramatically.</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong><br> My evil self disguised itself as a Servant of Justice and infiltrated Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong><br> I&#39;m sure that&#39;s possible because I&#39;m over there.</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong><br> Because only Servants who were summoned by a Master can find Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong><br> My evil self used this clever loophole, and started recruiting.</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong><br> He said: \u201CThere&#39;s a new place to live. There are rooms for Servants. You don&#39;t need a deposit. The first month is free. Move in as fast as possible!\u201D</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong><br> Ah, I am such a good salesman! I am jealous of myself!</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong><br> But it can&#39;t be helped. Chaldea&#39;s rooms for Servants are too small!</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong><br> No posters on the wall. No pets in the rooms, except for those that came with horses.</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong><br> That&#39;s why everyone came to this side. Then, when I got the chance...</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong><br> I escaped from the Grand-something&#39;s contract, and happily waited for all you to arrive!</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong><br> Ah, I knew!</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong><br> That Fujimaru would admonish my evil self and believe in my good heart...hehe, to think that you&#39;d believe in me!</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong><br> You heard him.<br> People really trust you.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Don&#39;t tell me you&#39;re coming with us, Mephy?</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong><br> Of course I am!<br> Don&#39;t think about kicking me out!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Weren&#39;t you just laughing, right now?</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong><br> Of course I laughed!<br> I laugh when good things happens, I&#39;m human after all!</p><hr><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou, foou!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Fou...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Master. Fou is also encouraging you,<br> let&#39;s just bring Mephisto with us.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> If we can make him tell us what he knows on the way, that would be great. Just don&#39;t expect too much.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You&#39;re right.</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong><br> Hehe, did you reach a conclusion?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Mephisto, don&#39;t betray us, okay?</p><hr><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong><br> Don&#39;t worry.<br> I&#39;ll absolutely obey the winner.</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong><br> In the first place, speaking of danger,<br> I&#39;m the same as Miss Assassin right there.</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong><br> Please, could you add me to this investigation team? Be careful of your back and neck!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...You heard him.<br> Are you the same as him, Shiki?</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong><br> Don&#39;t compare me with him!<br> My knife cuts way better than his scissors!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> That&#39;s what gets you angry?!</p><hr><h2 id="_1st-floor-room-no-4" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_1st-floor-room-no-4" aria-hidden="true">#</a> 1st Floor, Room No.4</h2><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> This sure is a strange-looking apartment... Its corridors are much longer than they appear to be.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...its elevator has a \u201CForever Out of Order\u201D sign, and it&#39;s always empty.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> There&#39;s a sign that points to the stairs going up, but we&#39;ll never reach it.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Ryougi, was this building always like this? Or is it just this time?</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong><br> Yeah. It was always a creepy apartment, but this time it&#39;s even worse.</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong><br> The width of the corridors, the number of rooms... Stuff like that doesn&#39;t really make a difference.</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong><br> But this temperature... I can&#39;t deal with this cold. Now this really feels like a haunted house.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> You mentioned this as a place that collects death. It doesn&#39;t collect ghosts?</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong><br> Indeed. It&#39;s more like it traps them here. It didn&#39;t collect them endlessly like this.</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong><br> Now this place is like a whirlpool. It pulls in unrelated stuff and turns it into evil.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...Evil?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> ...Harmless ghosts becoming evil spirits?</p><hr><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong><br> Big swirl! Hole, gap, black hole! I got it! It&#39;s easier to understand this way!</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong><br> I thought this place was like a magnetic field that attracted grudges like a lightning rod...</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong><br> But a big tree&#39;s hollow trunk is more suitable. Once you take a peek, if you&#39;re unlucky, you will fall into the eternal abyss.</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong><br> Hehe... A trap hole that opened in reality? Make sure you don&#39;t push me!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Mephisto, you&#39;re saying it, but stop pushing Senpai, please!</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong><br> ...You guys sure get along. Was he like this back in Chaldea, too?</p><p><strong>Mash and Dr. Roman:</strong><br> He is, without a doubt, the exact same Servant!<br> No doubt about it!</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong><br> Is that so!?<br> I&#39;m really troublesome!</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong><br> Ah, putting that aside, Miss Ryougi?<br> I&#39;m worried about that thing you have there.</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong><br> Mystic Eyes of Death Perception, right? I heard they can cut down anything regardless of strength.</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong><br> They sever the very activity of living. They bring instant death, yet it&#39;s different than brain death or heart attack.</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong><br> I understand. I do understand...<br> but they work on living things, right?</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong><br> Yet you&#39;re killing zombies who are not living. How is that possible?</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong><br> That&#39;s my doubt!<br> To kill dead people... It&#39;s complete nonsense!</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong><br> Hell if I know. It might look the same to humans, but ceasing to live and dying are two different things.</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong><br> Doesn&#39;t matter if it&#39;s zombies or ghosts, they&#39;re moving... If they are moving, that means they are \u201Cliving.\u201D</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong><br> If it&#39;s alive, no matter what, death will come. May it be oblivion or disintegration.</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong><br> My eyes don&#39;t make any distinctions between those things.</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong><br> That is... Painful!<br> You have gone through much, Miss Ryougi!</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong><br> Not really. It&#39;s better than becoming a demon in order to continue living, isn&#39;t it?</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong><br> \u2014Oh.<br> You&#39;re right.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> \u2014Stop Fujimaru!<br> Watch your front and not just your back!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I&#39;m detecting a Servant!<br> Not in the room, it&#39;s in the corridor\u2014</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> There&#39;s someone at the end of it!</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong><br> Hey, good evening, Mephisto.<br> Are these the new tenants?</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong><br> Welcome to the grudge garden.<br> Nice to meet you. I&#39;ve met you before, haven&#39;t I?</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong><br> I&#39;m Jekyll from Room 4.<br> I&#39;m the manager of this corridor, too.</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong><br> You just arrived, so you haven&#39;t mutated, right? You&#39;re not ready to go upstairs.</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong><br> It is better to stay on the first floor a little longer. It&#39;s a little cold, but you&#39;ll get used to it.</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong><br> Do you want to rest a little in my room?<br> It is a bit untidy right now, but you can use it.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Master... That Jekyll...<br> is scary... I can&#39;t explain it, but he&#39;s very\u2014</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...Yeah, his eyes aren&#39;t laughing.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> His shirt is covered in blood.</p><hr><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong><br> Whaaat? Mephisto don&#39;t wanna go!<br> Me don&#39;t like dirty room.</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong><br> Dirty room? Is that a dirty room?<br> It&#39;s no good. It&#39;s no good at all!</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong><br> I like to expose people&#39;s fetishes,<br> but I don&#39;t like looking at them.</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong><br> So, please, Master, decline Jekyll&#39;s invitation.<br> He&#39;s not suitable as a Servant in the first place.</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong><br> If you know it&#39;s dirty, clean it up!<br> Or perhaps...</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong><br> Scrupulous Jekyll is sleeping?<br> You&#39;re someone who can&#39;t clean up?</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong><br> Uh... Well, to tell you the truth, you&#39;re right. I&#39;m bad at cleaning up, and besides...</p><p><strong>Hyde:</strong><br> It gets dirty and red instantly!<br> I can&#39;t clean it up every single time, right?!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Shiki!</p><p><strong>Hyde:</strong><br> I see, someone here totally gets it!</p><p><strong>Hyde:</strong><br> But that was a perfect surprise attack! Why the hell would you block that!?</p><p><strong>Hyde:</strong><br> Anyway, I see that you&#39;re the same as me!</p><p><strong>Hyde:</strong><br> Pretending to be normal, but you&#39;re just a mass murderer who&#39;s craving to cut people&#39;s heads off!</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong><br> ...Tch, what was that? Disappointing... And here I was looking forward to this fated encounter.</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong><br> Before I knew it, I was at Ogawa Heim.<br> I was already a Servant.</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong><br> Facing countless ghosts and their grudges, running into a strange Master.</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong><br> Ah, yes... Fujimaru and Mash are good.<br> It&#39;s not that bad yet.</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong><br> But I wasn&#39;t satisfied.<br> That much I know.</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong><br> The only reason I could remain motivated was because I had a hunch! That I might run into the real thing.</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong><br> The one who came before. The world famous mass murderer with dual personalities!</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong><br> But what&#39;s this? Are you kidding me? Why did you transform? I thought we could enjoy some time together. I&#39;m shocked.</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong><br> Hey, please turn back to that kind-looking guy.<br> That one is probably stronger, and I prefer him.</p><p><strong>Hyde:</strong><br> What? Do you prefer that moron over me? Why?<br> Are you sure? This is the real me!</p><p><strong>Hyde:</strong><br> From that weak Jekyll, I become the strong Hyde! The one who&#39;s good with the knife is me, you know?!</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong><br> ...Hah. That&#39;s enough, tell him, Scissors.<br> I think you can understand me.</p><p><strong>Hyde:</strong><br> ...What?</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong><br> Okay, okay. I understand you completely!<br> Yes, I do, I understand you, miss!</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong><br> Mr. Hyde, this is what she&#39;s saying. Don&#39;t show the ace up your sleeve too quickly. If you do that, it&#39;s basically saying, \u201CThis is my limit.\u201D</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong><br> It&#39;s more fun to watch a good human fight while suppressing his own demons, as we still don&#39;t know what will happen!</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong><br> The catharsis of collapse, was it?</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong><br> I serve under the Master because I want to witness that explosive moment!</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong><br> If you want to play with a beast that is aggressive from the start you can go to a savannah!</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong><br> That&#39;s what she wants to see!<br> It&#39;s not the mass murders committed by Hyde.</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong><br> ...But the immoral crimes committed by the good Jekyll as he cries tears of regret. Now that&#39;s ecstasy!</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong><br> ...I&#39;m an idiot to have let you talk.<br> You&#39;re completely wrong. Get out of my way.</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong><br> Mephy, shocked!</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong><br> But I do prefer the goodie-goodie looking one. It&#39;s like the difference between fighting for fun and fighting for your life.</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong><br> If you have to kill, it&#39;s more enthralling to fight desperately, right?</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong><br> In other words, you are not enough.<br> Come back again another time...</p><p><strong>Hyde:</strong><br> HAH! I see, I see!<br> You can&#39;t enjoy it if it&#39;s not serious!?</p><p><strong>Hyde:</strong><br> You&#39;re one crazy lady!<br> Then, let&#39;s have fun with this little dance!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE-</strong></p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong><br> Ugh... Hyde came out again...<br> Sorry... Hyde and I were manipulated...</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong><br> Fujimaru, be careful with Mephisto...<br> He cannot be trusted...</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong><br> Oh? Me?<br> No, no. Don&#39;t you know I&#39;m a changed man?</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong><br> Wait, I can&#39;t change!<br> I mean, I am already the good Mephy!</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong><br> If I change, I will become the evil one! Nope, not changing, not ever going to chaaaaaaannnge.</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong><br> Ugh... What is this, I can&#39;t maintain my body... My eyes... It&#39;s all dark...</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong><br> Fujimaru, give me your hand, please...<br> I have something that I have to give you...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> (Offer your hand to Jekyll)</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong><br> Good... You have the heart to trust people...<br> You are the Master I&#39;ve always hoped for.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Master?!</p><hr><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong><br> Come on, take this key.<br> Use it to go to the upper floor\u2014</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong><br> But before you go... Dieeeee!</p><p><strong>Hyde:</strong><br> Ggg\u2014!</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong><br> Thanks.<br> I will gladly accept this key.</p><p><strong>Hyde:</strong><br> Y-Yooouu! Twice!<br> You ruined my surprise attack twice!</p><p><strong>Hyde:</strong><br> I&#39;m amazed that you can&#39;t even fulfill a dying pretty boy&#39;s wish! Don&#39;t you have the heart to trust people?!</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong><br> If you were your normal self, I would&#39;ve been deceived, or rather moved, by your kindness.</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong><br> But neither happened to me this time.<br> I mean... You&#39;ve been one personality the whole time.</p><p><strong>Hyde:</strong><br> \u2014Ugh.<br> Don&#39;t tell me, you already knew?!</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong><br> I wanted to meet the famous Doctor Jekyll, but he is not here.</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong><br> Instead of having a split personality, you were acting like someone with dual personalities.</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong><br> As a fan, you can&#39;t blame me for being disappointed, can you?</p><p><strong>Hyde:</strong><br> Ah... Dammit that&#39;s embarrassing. It&#39;s even more embarrassing than me losing in a knife fight.</p><p><strong>Hyde:</strong><br> I&#39;d bury my head in the sand if I could. But looks like I don&#39;t need to do that, right?</p><p><strong>Hyde:</strong><br> Considering there&#39;s a dangerous fan here, I guess I shall take my leave.</p><p><strong>Hyde:</strong><br> See ya, mass murderer of the present. Just be careful and make sure you don&#39;t become a knock-off.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Enemy Servant eliminated.<br> Um... What was that just now?</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong><br> I don&#39;t know.<br> Hey Scissors, say something.</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong><br> Hehehe! Not that it&#39;s important, so I will keep it in two lines!</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong><br> Dr. Jekyll fully mutated when he arrived at this apartment. Both his body and soul rotted away, so he died!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Doctor Jekyll is a Servant with a split personality... So what you&#39;re saying is that his main personality is gone already?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> So Hyde, who survived, was acting like Doctor Jekyll... Just like how his story ended... So sad.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> But what do you mean by mutated?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Jekyll was a Servant who transformed into Hyde with drugs, but it seems you&#39;re not talking about those...</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong><br> Ah, I forgot to mention it.<br> It is what makes this apartment special.</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong><br> Certain characteristics? Past history? Criminal record? Hmmmmm, well, let&#39;s just keep that vague.</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong><br> Anyway, if certain Servants stay here, their alignment will change, and become more resentful.</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong><br> I myself was changed that way! Even if I want to fight, I took an arrow to the shin! Ow!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Changing Heroic Spirits&#39; alignment?!<br> Is that like a new way of tampering with parameters?!</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong><br> Yes. Well, they get angry easily so it&#39;s more like stress level? Like lowering the boiling point?</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong><br> So it&#39;s not really that harmful.<br> However\u2014</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong><br> For the people that ended their life full of resentment and sadness, this place will work wonders!</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong><br> Heroic Spirits ending up as evil ghosts due to their own resentment for humans... Isn&#39;t that ironic?</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong><br> Yes, even the evil me used that and asked those kinds of Servants to come here.</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong><br> As you can see, all the Servants that moved here went crazy, right?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Th-That&#39;s not very nice!<br> Bad Mephisto! You&#39;re guilty!</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong><br> Hehe, I was just doing my job as a real estate agent! The guilty ones are this land, this building, and the mastermind!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> When we meet again, it&#39;ll be in court.</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong><br> I can&#39;t believe it... You have a contract with a Servant who was a judge?</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong><br> Will the jury be full of homunculi? I mean, human trials can be tough, you know?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Mastermind?</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong><br> Oops, I was caught by Mash&#39;s beauty and said too much. Zipping my mouth now.</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong><br> You will find out yourselves when you go to the upper floors! I think!</p><hr><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong><br> \u2014</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong><br> Oh. Did you smile? Why?</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong><br> It&#39;s fun with Fujimaru around, clown.<br> When we have fun guests, my tension blows up!</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong><br> Is it possible?<br> I&#39;m always hyper like this, hyahoo!</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong><br> I can see that.<br> Fine, now we can go upstairs, right?</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong><br> Let&#39;s move forward, Fujimaru.<br> It seems the real fight starts now.</p><h2 id="_2nd-floor-room-no-4" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_2nd-floor-room-no-4" aria-hidden="true">#</a> 2nd Floor, Room No.4</h2><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong><br> Hellooo, I&#39;m coming in!<br> Oohhh!

I know it&#39;s Elisabeth, but please fight with everything you&#39;ve got!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE-</strong></p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Ugh...<br> That hurts... That hurts... That hurts!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> ...Stop it!<br> Don&#39;t let me know...</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Don&#39;t let me know that it hurts this much when my stomach is cut open! Don&#39;t force that on me!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> So what if you tell me that other people would share the same pain! What do you expect me to do?</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Why?! Why am I the only one miserable?!<br> No matter what I do, why can&#39;t I be saved?!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> If you say you&#39;re humans, wouldn&#39;t that make me a more lowly beast?!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Like a lizard, like a lizard, like a lizard... Are you telling me to crawl on the floor and get stepped on and crushed?</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> I can&#39;t stand it.<br> I will not be able to stand it!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> So, please let me kill you.

That was...</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong><br> Yes, those were always her real feelings!<br> For me it only sounded like a scream!</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong><br> But I am sure it was a good outlet for her. Her...pride? Or should I call it dignity?</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong><br> It must be the result of the education she received as an aristocrat. The ruling class is not allowed to lament.</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong><br> \u201CThose who stand over others must shoulder suitable responsibility.\u201D I am sure that idea was etched onto her.</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong><br> She picked herself up after falling, trying to aim for the top only to fall again, covered in mud. Yet she picked herself up again.</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong><br> It looks like she keeps repeating the process as her atonement. Hmmm, kind of like a dragon that keeps collecting shining treasure in its dungeon.</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong><br> That&#39;s why, don&#39;t mind the ugly side of her you&#39;ve just witnessed. Next time you see her...</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong><br> ...just say, \u201CYour horns are pretty cute,\u201D and everything will be okay!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...Really?

Oh, Mash, is that what you think of me? Someone who hugs at every possible chance?</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong><br> Anyway. I just made a stew. Will you have some with me, Fujimaru?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Yes, of course.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Eat up, so we can all go home.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes! You are way past your limit, Senpai.<br> I think it&#39;s good for you to replenish some energy.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> After we finish our meal, let&#39;s go back to Chaldea for the time being. We also have to bring Boudica back\u2014</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong><br> \u2014Go back?<br> What are you talking about, Mash?</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong><br> Don&#39;t joke around with me.<br> Who said I would go back?</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong><br> I won&#39;t go back. There&#39;s no place for me to go back to. That&#39;s because... Everything... YOU TOOK EVERYTHING!</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong><br> We were the king&#39;s only family.<br> My daughter and I were all he had!</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong><br> That&#39;s why I was going to inherit the throne...

Exactly! That there is the evil Dark Knight, the crow that devours the dead.</p><p><strong>Lancer Alter:</strong><br> ...No, wait!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I get chills just from the gaze beyond that helmet!

Oh I can&#39;t stop laughing! Hehehe, kill, let&#39;s kill!</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong><br> Inside that armor is probably a hollow shell like the ghosts outside, or a bony skeleton!</p><p><strong>Lancer Alter:</strong><br> ...Hey!<br> Who are you calling a bony skeleton?</p><p><strong>Lancer Alter:</strong><br> Feast your eyes upon this body! One that belongs to the King of Storms, the protector of the holy lance!</p><p><strong>Lancer Alter:</strong><br> LOOK! CLOSELY!</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong><br> (Completely stunned by her taking off her armor)</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Whoa! Time to record this!

You show much promise. However...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I don&#39;t remember you.

To think my servants will be disposed of so easily.</p><p><strong>Lancer Alter:</strong><br> If she&#39;s with you then you can win. I have no more reasons to stop you.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Master, Lancer Alter has lowered her spear.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Unlike the other Servants,<br> maybe she still hasn&#39;t mutated?</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong><br> Of course she hasn&#39;t. I mean, she&#39;s just not cut out for it.</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong><br> How should I put this... The heart that&#39;s not afraid to go all out? The courage to pursue desires? Kind of like the class president?</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong><br> No matter how strong she becomes,<br> she never seems to turn into a cruel queen.</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong><br> Unless you pour ale into the Holy Grail and have her drink it, she will never become a villain.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That&#39;s very much like her.<br> But why is she blocking our way?</p><p><strong>Lancer Alter:</strong><br> ...Hmm. I can&#39;t let people without light tread into the darkness.</p><p><strong>Lancer Alter:</strong><br> I am here to filter the people who can&#39;t resist against the grudge in this place.</p><p><strong>Lancer Alter:</strong><br> But with that woman around,<br> any immortal will face death.</p><p><strong>Lancer Alter:</strong><br> That&#39;s why I will allow you to proceed. Besides...</p><p><strong>Lancer Alter:</strong><br> Even with a light, it&#39;s common to be eaten by beasts.<br> I will enjoy watching how far you can go.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Wow, what a scary laugh...<br> She looks like a cruel queen to me... Cruel enough...</p><p><strong>Lancer Alter:</strong><br> You talk too much, mage. Small talk is strictly prohibited. Instead of speaking, keep moving!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou, fou!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Ouch, she scolded me... She&#39;s like a class president alright. Now for the necessary questions.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Heroic Spirit of the Holy Spear. Why are you here? Did Mephisto trick you into coming, too?</p><p><strong>Lancer Alter:</strong><br> I don&#39;t know about that.<br> I came of my own free will.</p><p><strong>Lancer Alter:</strong><br> ...This is the tower that gathers grudges.<br> It is the cenotaph that imprisons death.</p><p><strong>Lancer Alter:</strong><br> Originally it should&#39;ve been drowned in the darkness of history. But someone dug it up, and tried to convert it to a Singularity.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Someone... It&#39;s probably the same person who&#39;s incinerated humanity. But you said they tried, did they fail?</p><p><strong>Lancer Alter:</strong><br> ...This is what you will find out from your investigation. Indeed, the King&#39;s plan ended in miscalculation.</p><p><strong>Lancer Alter:</strong><br> That&#39;s probably because he sent the wrong man for the job. As a result, this place did not turn into a Singularity.</p><p><strong>Lancer Alter:</strong><br> Instead, it became a tower that attracts and imprisons Servants, turning them into demons.</p><p><strong>Lancer Alter:</strong><br> There are many types of death that come here. Someday, it will become the Singularity called \u201CHell.\u201D</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong><br> So this is the gate of Hell, right? That means I am most suitable to be your guide!</p><p><strong>Lancer Alter:</strong><br> Now, even if a Hell wasn&#39;t created here, one already exists. Adding one or two more holes to it wouldn&#39;t be a problem. However...</p><p><strong>Lancer Alter:</strong><br> If you can&#39;t overlook that fact, then do whatever you see fit.</p><p><strong>Lancer Alter:</strong><br> This place has no effect on the incineration of humanity. The mutation of the Servants is the result of their own doing.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...That&#39;s what she thinks...<br> What should we do, Senpai?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Of course, we will go up.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> We can&#39;t abandon our Servants.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Roger!<br> I will go with you, Master!</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong><br> ...Even if it won&#39;t cause any harm to you, you&#39;ll still intervene? You sure are a curious one.</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong><br> Or are you just nosy?<br> Chaldea is more laid-back than I thought.</p><p><strong>Lancer Alter:</strong><br> That&#39;s not it. It is my duty as a king.<br> An inferior being like you wouldn&#39;t understand.</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong><br> Don&#39;t be ridiculous. Even inferior civilians have their path! Especially, when it&#39;s related to our own territory.</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong><br> Oh well... We&#39;ve already defeated the large chested woman, so let&#39;s go ahead Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong><br> If we keep looking at those things, it&#39;ll mess up our sense of scale! More than enough is too much, you know?</p><p><strong>Lancer Alter:</strong><br> Heh. No one who has more than enough says that. I will accept it as sour grapes.</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong><br> Okay, okay. Ah, how about that Room No. 4? That is your room, right? Can we go inside?</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong><br> You clean it up everyday, right?</p><p><strong>Lancer Alter:</strong><br> Eh\u2014?</p><p><strong>Lancer Alter:</strong><br> No!

There&#39;s no boundary lines!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> It&#39;s like Sc\xE1thach&#39;s Land of Shadows!<br> If we don&#39;t stop this thing\u2014</p><p><strong>Evil Mephisto:</strong><br> Welcome, everyone!<br> Have you been satisfied so far?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> \u2014Huh?</p><p><strong>Good Mephisto:</strong><br> Of course we have!<br> Hello, me! Thanks for watching the Boundary!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou, foou!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Another set of Mephistos!?<br> Even though we got rid of the evil one!?</p><p><strong>Good Mephisto:</strong><br> What are you saying, lady Mash?<br> I&#39;ll ask you not to underestimate me.</p><p><strong>Good Mephisto:</strong><br> I am a devil!<br> I&#39;ve only got a single good heart within me\u2014</p><p><strong>Good Mephisto:</strong><br> But I&#39;ve got far more than one or two hearts of evil! I&#39;ve got so many you couldn&#39;t count them all!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That&#39;s surprisingly convincing!<br> I have no come back to that, Master!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> It&#39;s Mephisto. What can you do?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> We just have to keep punching him until he reforms.</p><hr><p><strong>Good Mephisto:</strong><br> Yes, perfect!<br> I wanted to see you go around defeating all the evil mes.</p><p><strong>Good Mephisto:</strong><br> That&#39;s why I came here in the first place!</p><p><strong>Good Mephisto:</strong><br> Come, come! Go right ahead! Behind that evil me is a Greater Ghost.</p><p><strong>Good Mephisto:</strong><br> That&#39;s the keystone of this Bounded Field! The Great Avici Hell, which draws spirits of the dead here and turns them into a pillar!</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong><br> ...It&#39;s huge. How hard is it gonna be for that to die? There&#39;s so many lines I could never cut them all!</p><p><strong>Evil Mephisto:</strong><br> Hehehe! Of course it&#39;s hard!<br> It&#39;s a copy-paste of over a hundred million deaths!</p><p><strong>Evil Mephisto:</strong><br> And you&#39;re going to join the other ghosts in it! But before that\u2014</p><p><strong>Evil Mephisto:</strong><br> There&#39;s something I don&#39;t quite understand. I&#39;m talking about you, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Evil Mephisto:</strong><br> Say, why are you doing all of this? This isn&#39;t your problem at all.</p><p><strong>Evil Mephisto:</strong><br> It&#39;s true that Servants were trapped here.<br> But they mutated of their own will.</p><p><strong>Evil Mephisto:</strong><br> They all wanted to be that way. There was no need for you to go to considerable length to come and save them.</p><p><strong>Evil Mephisto:</strong><br> This apartment is located in a different dimension, yes. But it&#39;s only a fake Singularity. It&#39;s safe to ignore.</p><p><strong>Evil Mephisto:</strong><br> Even if humanity&#39;s foundations were restored, this place would simply sit outside the world and quietly gather hatred and pain.</p><p><strong>Evil Mephisto:</strong><br> Looking at this sort of hell is my job, which is why I&#39;m here working.</p><p><strong>Evil Mephisto:</strong><br> But why are you getting involved?<br> No one asked you. And this isn&#39;t revenge.</p><p><strong>Evil Mephisto:</strong><br> There&#39;s nothing to be gained for you by solving this problem!</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong><br> \u2014</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Well...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Everyone looks like they&#39;re suffering.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> A hobby. Just like you.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> \u2014Right! It doesn&#39;t matter what we gain! It felt like we needed to solve this!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That&#39;s the kind of person Senpai is! Someone who can&#39;t look away from pain and sadness.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...I still remember Senpai holding my hand that day when I was scared in the Command Room...</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong><br> Everyone looks like they&#39;re suffering, huh? And I guess \u201Ceveryone\u201D includes the ghosts.</p><p><strong>Evil Mephisto:</strong><br> \u2014SIGH. Then I guess I&#39;ll have no choice but to kill you.</p><p><strong>Evil Mephisto:</strong><br> I am a devil. It&#39;s no fun if someone does something just because they want to.</p><p><strong>Evil Mephisto:</strong><br> I can&#39;t tempt them with anything. Which means I can&#39;t trade with them!</p><p><strong>Evil Mephisto:</strong><br> And in the face of someone like that, you know... I would have no choice but to truly submit!</p><p><strong>Evil Mephisto:</strong><br> And if I was loyal like that, I wouldn&#39;t be a devil anymore, would I?</p><p><strong>Evil Mephisto:</strong><br> I am here as myself.</p><p><strong>Evil Mephisto:</strong><br> As long as I&#39;m needed as the devil Mephisto Pheles... It would be rude to my wonderful Master not to do my job!</p><p><strong>Good Mephisto:</strong><br> Ooh, that&#39;s me for you!<br> A devil more devilish than any devil!</p><p><strong>Good Mephisto:</strong><br> But as the me on Master&#39;s side, this is a problem. I don&#39;t think I can beat that Greater Ghost.</p><p><strong>Good Mephisto:</strong><br> The evil devil me wants to be defeated by my Master. The good devil me just wants to survive and doesn&#39;t care about anyone else.</p><p><strong>Good Mephisto:</strong><br> What is this? Mixing both me together would make me look like the strongest, wouldn&#39;t it!?</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong><br> Idiot. Just shut up and work with us.<br> It&#39;s the only way you&#39;ll survive.</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong><br> Let&#39;s do it, Mash, Scissors.<br> Fujimaru&#39;s answer persuaded me.</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong><br> I&#39;d been wondering the whole time, too.</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong><br> Fujimaru has a place to call home.<br> Why get involved in someone else&#39;s hell?</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong><br> But I guess I know the answer now.</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong><br> This one is the same kind of idiot as Mikiya! So there&#39;s no sense in thinking about it!</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong><br> Idiots never listen to you, after all!<br> They just make everyone&#39;s lives difficult!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Right... right! I agree, Shiki!<br> That&#39;s our Master!</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong><br> Then let&#39;s finish this thing!</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong><br> I&#39;m thinking that I want to go to this Chaldea of yours!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE-</strong></p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> The massive ghost has vanished!<br> Now the fake Singularity is done for!</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong><br> Bye now, lying devil.<br> Time for you to head back home!</p><p><strong>Evil Mephisto:</strong><br> Ayye\u2014yeee!<br> It&#39;s so sharp!</p><p><strong>Evil Mephisto:</strong><br> So this is a death line!?<br> It&#39;s so sharp, huh miss?</p><p><strong>Evil Mephisto:</strong><br> It&#39;s a clean cut! I didn&#39;t feel anything and there&#39;s no blood! But there&#39;s terror and pleasure!</p><p><strong>Evil Mephisto:</strong><br> Oh, I have to disappear!<br> I can&#39;t take it anymore!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The enemy Servant and massive ghost have been eliminated. \u2014We won, Master.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Good work, everyone.</p><hr><p><strong>Good Mephisto:</strong><br> Hehe. Hehehehe!</p><p><strong>Good Mephisto:</strong><br> Good work! Good work, huh?<br> An airhead until the end, you are!</p><p><strong>Good Mephisto:</strong><br> But that&#39;s unforgettable, unattainable, and I want to die! Good work! And farewell!</p><p><strong>Good Mephisto:</strong><br> Though... When you&#39;re a devil like me you don&#39;t do farewells like this often!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Good Mephisto!?<br> W-Why are you starting to disappear?</p><p><strong>Good Mephisto:</strong><br> Why? That&#39;s a strange question<br> Killing that me means killing this me as well!</p><p><strong>Good Mephisto:</strong><br> Listen, if you defeat an evil heart,<br> the good heart isn&#39;t going to somehow survive, okay?</p><p><strong>Good Mephisto:</strong><br> I am me because of my evil.<br> And I am me because of my good.</p><p><strong>Good Mephisto:</strong><br> You are who you are because of your strengths.<br> I am who I am because of my weaknesses.</p><p><strong>Good Mephisto:</strong><br> It&#39;s best to disappear together. That is what we are.</p><p><strong>Good Mephisto:</strong><br> Because\u2014if only one of us were to survive, that would be a sad thing.</p><p><strong>Good Mephisto:</strong><br> They say a man can&#39;t live by himself!<br> Although, I am a devil!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> \u2014</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong><br> ...Yeah.<br> Did you have fun, Scissors?</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong><br> Yes, I did! The best days of my devilish life! Um, yes. Enough that I&#39;m going to miss it.</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong><br> Anyway, I will be off!<br> I&#39;ll be joining the ghosts!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> No, I&#39;ll see you soon, Mephisto Pheles.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I&#39;ll summon you soon.</p><hr><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong><br> Hehehe. Hehehehe.<br> That&#39;s wrong. That&#39;s a different me. Not this me.</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong><br> I&#39;m not human.<br> In fact, I was never human at all\u2014</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong><br> So I don&#39;t remember what happened yesterday, and I probably won&#39;t remember you!</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong><br> That&#39;s what a devil is! Either they destroy the one they contract with, or that one will destroy them!</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong><br> Nothing remains. For if it did, it would weigh on me. I wouldn&#39;t be able to have fun deceiving you, Master!</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong><br> Goodbye, everyone\u2014<br> The devil Mephisto Pheles will be leaving now!</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong><br> Splendid, splendid work, Fujimaru!<br> You have done well to awaken from the sleep of death!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Heroic Spirit Mephisto Pheles is gone.<br> It&#39;s over, Shiki, Senpai.</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong><br> Over?<br> Well, I guess it is.</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong><br> Once that massive ghost is gone, this apartment building will go back to being abandoned.</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong><br> When the time comes, there&#39;ll be nothing left. Like what Scissors said, that&#39;s life.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes. It is a little lonely, though.</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong><br> Okay. Let&#39;s head back to this Chaldea place, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong><br> No, should I call you Master?<br> That&#39;s the rule for Servants, right?</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou!?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Huh? You&#39;re coming too?</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong><br> What, am I not welcome? I&#39;ve helped you this far.<br> ...Not that it was my main goal.</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong><br> I was troubled too.</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong><br> I thought I&#39;d wake up if I found the cause, but it&#39;s not happening. Instead, I feel more alert than ever.</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong><br> This place is going to disappear soon.<br> So Chaldea&#39;s the only place I can go.</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong><br> If I work for you as a Servant,<br> then you can give me lodgings, food, and clothing, right?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It&#39;s true...We can&#39;t just leave her.<br> Senpai?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Welcome to Chaldea.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Thanks for coming, Ryougi.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Right!<br> Thanks for working with us, Shiki!</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong><br> Thanks.<br> Okay, let&#39;s get going.</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong><br> If you need ghosts, zombies, or anything else weird taken out, I&#39;m the one. Use me as you like.</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong><br> Thanks, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong><br> I won&#39;t go as far as Scissors,<br> but I&#39;ll follow you to the gates of Hell.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Damn... Another weirdo, huh?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> But it&#39;s good that Chaldea will be livelier.<br> I&#39;ll get her a room ready quickly.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Fujimaru, good work. I can see the fake Singularity response beginning to weaken.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> The massive ghost maintaining it vanished.<br> That apartment building will vanish soon.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> The Servants who were trapped will come back when the building disappears.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> If you forgot anything, take care of it.<br> Chaldea always needs more resources.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> But don&#39;t spend too much time there!<br> I&#39;ll be waiting for you in the Command Room!</p><h2 id="_6th-floor-room-no-1" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_6th-floor-room-no-1" aria-hidden="true">#</a> 6th Floor, Room No.1</h2><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Excuse the intrusion!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Good morning!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Although we resolved the incident, it seems there are still some Servants trapped inside the building.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> So we continued our search and rescue efforts,<br> but... but...</p><p><strong>Fran:</strong><br> Uuuu...

Thermopylae Enomoti...waaaahh!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I apologize, Mash. Just as you said, he hasn&#39;t been mutated. He&#39;s just bad with ghosts, it seems.

They&#39;ll even \u201Ckill\u201D a shadow reflected on the water&#39;s surface.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> You perceive even inanimate things as living. Even phantoms are not immune to death. It seems my work ends here.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> The Spiritron reaction is fading...<br> No, wait! The dark Servant!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Why did you create this kind of place!?<br> Who asked you to do this!?</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> It&#39;s obvious. Surely you understand.<br> It&#39;s the one that you regard as your enemy.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> He boasted that this tower could become a new Singularity. However\u2014</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> My goal differs from his.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> My life is fueled by my thirst for vengeance.<br> He differs from me on a fundamental level.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Why should I lend a hand to someone who holds no grudge? That&#39;s why I rejected his offer.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> True to my nature, I gave other Servants the opportunity to take revenge.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> \u201COh Tiger, howl with all the fury of a tiger.<br> The time has come to devour your prey.\u201D</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> He held no grudge... What does that mean? I&#39;m confused... Well then, what is the point of incinerating mankind&#39;s history?</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Why don&#39;t you find the answer yourselves?<br> I have no interest in the matter.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Master.<br> The enemy Servant will disappear.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Wait!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Please, just tell me who you are!</p><hr><p><strong>???:</strong><br> I&#39;m not obligated to say anything.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> ...Hmph. But, if you insist...<br> The only thing I have to say is this.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> \u201CAttendre et esp\xE9rer...\u201D Wait and hope.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...It is finally over. The mastermind who was gathering all the ghosts is finally gone.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> This apartment will return to its incinerated history... The long night will finally end.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That&#39;s good news, but...<br> We still have no idea who that Servant was.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> He made it sound like he was our enemy...<br> I wonder if we will have to fight again someday?</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong><br> Who knows? One victory might be all that&#39;s needed for that type of guy. He might turn out to be an unexpectedly trustworthy ally.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Really?</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong><br> That&#39;s right. Mash, do you know why human beings take revenge on others?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> N-No. I can&#39;t quite recall at the moment the motivation behind the act of revenge...</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong><br> It&#39;s simple. A human being holds a grudge when they have been betrayed by someone they love. If the other person is someone they don&#39;t care about, they would be indifferent.</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong><br> So... Maybe that guy in black actually loves humanity on a fundamental level?</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong><br> The one born from hatred speaks of love,<br> and the one born from love speaks of hatred.</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong><br> That&#39;s the type of guy he is, I&#39;m sure.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Yes. Perhaps we&#39;ll encounter him again someday. For now, let&#39;s hope that we have solved this case once and for all.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I&#39;m glad we were able to solve the case!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou, foou!</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong><br> Yeah. The investigation did take a lot of legwork. Your perseverance exceeded my expectations.</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong><br> Come to my house if you lose your job as a Master. We...have a detective, so we&#39;ll hire you as an assistant.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Dr. Roman, don&#39;t tell me it&#39;s you!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Hmm, I don&#39;t know about that. If I can remote control someone from here, I think I can be a lot more useful to you guys.</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Anyway, good work, everyone. You were all able to persevere and continue the search until the end.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> There&#39;s nothing left to do now, and the distortion in the coordinates should eventually disappear.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I&#39;ll be waiting for all of you in Chaldea.<br> The Case of Ogawa Heim has come to a close!</p>', 1595);
