Transporter Santa Claus</h2><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> The Servants will be visiting their homes?<br> On the bleached Earth?</p><p><strong>Da\xA0Vinci:</strong><br> Right. Servants are still children of humanity<br> (*save for a few exceptions).</p><p><strong>Da\xA0Vinci:</strong><br> It&#39;s only natural that they&#39;d miss their places of birth,<br> not to mention that returning to their lands has the<br> benefit of restoring their damaged Saint Graphs.</p><p><strong>Da\xA0Vinci:</strong><br> Therefore, all Servants who apply for it are given<br> leave to return home for seven days every year.</p><p><strong>Da\xA0Vinci:</strong><br> You can&#39;t have summer vacation but no winter<br> vacation, can you?</p><p><strong>Da\xA0Vinci:</strong><br> Well, Chaldea&#39;s magical energy supply is minimized,<br> so it&#39;s not actually as comfortable as it could&#39;ve been.</p><p><strong>Da\xA0Vinci:</strong><br> Any problems, Captain?</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> ...No, I have no objections as long as they keep in<br> touch. I can agree that restoring their Saint Graphs<br> would be an improvement to our forces.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> It&#39;s effective to review and reinput the elements of the<br> source character that one loses or forgets.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> On the off chance the Border gets attacked,<br> we&#39;ll have to forcibly summon all of them back,<br> causing overload for the Triton Engines...</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> but not all Servants will apply for visits. I&#39;m sure the<br> applicants will be a minority.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> At Chaldea&#39;s current state, a 10-20% loss of<br> personnel is something we can compensate for with<br> knowledge and experience.</p><p><strong>Da\xA0Vinci:</strong><br> \u2014</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Da Vinci?</p><p><strong>Da\xA0Vinci:</strong><br> Sure, you got the 10-20% number right. You just<br> assigned it to the wrong box.</p><p><strong>Da\xA0Vinci:</strong><br> 80% of our Servants are currently visiting their homes.<br> The 20% are the ones remaining on the Storm Border.</p><p><strong>Da\xA0Vinci:</strong><br> Don&#39;t worry. SHEBA&#39;s future observation guarantees<br> that we&#39;re safe for at least another seven days.</p><p><strong>Da\xA0Vinci:</strong><br> You can be sure that the Storm Border won&#39;t be<br> attacked. Professor said the same thing.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Professor... This is the sort of thing you have to report<br> to your captain. That&#39;s unacceptably negligent...<br> Lazy, even.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> ...I&#39;ll deal with my own problems later...</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> What matters now is the other Servants. We have too<br> many Servants absent. That&#39;s unreasonable.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Did Chaldea work them so hard that everyone got<br> homesick?</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou. Fou.<br> (Special translation: They kinda did.)</p><p><strong>Da\xA0Vinci:</strong><br> There&#39;s one more reason. I know this may sound too<br> Chaldea-esque for your standards, but\u2013</p><p><strong>Da\xA0Vinci:</strong><br> we have a regular tradition of a Santa delivering<br> presents to everyone on Christmas.</p><p><strong>Da\xA0Vinci:</strong><br> Many might be waiting at home in hopes of getting<br> what they wished for.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> These people are crazy. Eels who&#39;ve tied themselves<br> in knots.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Christmas? Santa Claus? While the Earth is bleached?</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> It&#39;s deplorable to see Leonardo da Vinci making such<br> an elementary mistake.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> \u201CWaiting at home\u201D is not even the point!</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> \u201CNeeding to be good the whole year\u201D is! Not making it<br> about that removes most of the joy of the season!</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Yes! That&#39;s exactly it! Christmas is proof that you did<br> good this year!</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> I can see why the kids want to be like you,<br> adventurous captain Nemo! You know what really<br> matters about Christmas!</p><p><strong>Santa\xA0Martha:</strong><br> I&#39;ve been thinking that it&#39;s about time I chose someone<br> for this year&#39;s Santa role. But there were too many<br> candidates on the list~!</p><p><strong>Santa\xA0Martha:</strong><br> Preferably, I&#39;d want a sturdy and hardworking Rider<br> Class Servant!</p><p><strong>Santa\xA0Martha:</strong><br> And now fortune smiled my way right when I needed<br> it!</p><p><strong>Santa\xA0Martha:</strong><br> Rider Class? Check!<br> Hardworking? 100%! Sturdy? Tarasque level!</p><p><strong>Santa\xA0Martha:</strong><br> Perfect. The Lord&#39;s guidance has brought us together.</p><p><strong>Santa\xA0Martha:</strong><br> Greetings and good day, Heroic Spirit Nemo.</p><p><strong>Santa\xA0Martha:</strong><br> May I ask you to be this year&#39;s Santa?</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Me, the Santa? Wait, does that just pass down from<br> one to the other so casually?</p><p><strong>Santa\xA0Martha:</strong><br> Yes, the Santa Claus is chosen by the previous one<br> every year!</p><p><strong>Santa\xA0Martha:</strong><br> I was an exception, but I hear this pattern was true for<br> mostly all other Santas!</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> I-If you say so.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> But I am a conqueror of the seas, not someone known<br> for giving children things they want.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Not to mention I have my tasks as captain.</p><p><strong>Santa\xA0Martha:</strong><br> Oh, I see. Hmm, then I suppose I&#39;ll have to ask<br> someone else.</p><p><strong>Santa\xA0Martha:</strong><br> Sorry for the sudden and unreasonable request.<br> I&#39;ll go look for another Santa candidate to\u2013</p><p><strong>E\uFF1ANemo\xA0Baker=spot:</strong><br> HOLD IT! It&#39;s Santa we&#39;re talking about! Delivering<br> presents!</p><p><strong>E\uFF1ANemo\xA0Baker=spot:</strong><br> We have do it! Let us do it, Captain!<br> It&#39;s guaranteed to be fuuuuun!</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Marine=spot:</strong><br> Agreed! We wanna be Santaaaaaa!</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Engineer=spot:</strong><br> H-hmpf. Christmas, eh? Might be a good idea to leave<br> the Storm Border coolin&#39; off.</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Professor=spot:</strong><br> This is my moment. In preparation for this occasion,<br> I converted the Nautilus&#39; landing vessel into a<br> four-by-fo~ur.</p><p><strong>I\uFF1ANemo\xA0Nurse=spot:</strong><br> I have no reason to object. Since there will be no<br> combat, I&#39;ll have no work to do at the infirmary.</p><p><strong>I\uFF1ANemo\xA0Nurse=spot:</strong><br> Besides, I&#39;m sure our wise Captain already thought of<br> what he wanted to do as soon as the word \u201CSanta\u201D<br> entered the conversation.</p><p><strong>Santa\xA0Martha:</strong><br> Sorry for the sudden and unreasonable request.<br> I&#39;ll go look for another Santa candidate to\u2013</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> I accept, of course. Fortunately, Da Vinci told me<br> everything about it.</p><p><strong>C\uFF1AFou\xA0(Narration):</strong><br> \u201CNemo&#39;s train of thought there lasted 0.5 seconds.<br> This level is comparable to the average Atlas<br> alchemist&#39;s Thought Acceleration.\u201D</p><p><strong>Santa\xA0Martha:</strong><br> Great. Then I&#39;ll pass the Santa Saint Graph to you.</p><p><strong>Santa\xA0Martha:</strong><br> Close your eyes and focus on your personal idea of<br> Santa Claus.</p><p><strong>Santa\xA0Martha:</strong><br> It&#39;s a very difficult and time-consuming process,<br> but I&#39;m sure the great Captain Nemo can\u2013HUH?!</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Santa:</strong><br> This is a good enough look for a Santa Claus.</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Santa:</strong><br> Thank you for choosing me, Saint Martha. I will not<br> disappoint.</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Santa:</strong><br> I am now Captain, yet not Captain.<br> The leader of Team Nautilus, Nemo Porter!</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Santa:</strong><br> Discipline to the naughty children.<br> Presents to the nice children.</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Santa:</strong><br> Leave it to me. I never fail an assignment. I swear on<br> the name of the Heroic Spirit Nemo that Santa will not<br> allow failure!</p><p><strong>Santa\xA0Martha:</strong><br> (Whaaat?

It would be no<br> exaggeration to say you&#39;re the best Santa of the<br> century.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Am I? (Trying not to look too happy)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I sure am. (Shit-eating grin)</p><hr><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Sorry to spoil your Santa Mystic Code fun, but you<br> won&#39;t need to head out, Master.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Save the costume for the Christmas party. Or for next<br> year&#39;s gift delivery.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Oh! I know that voice\u2014</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Santa:</strong><br> Merry Christmas, Mash and Fujimaru.<br> As you can see, I&#39;m this year&#39;s Santa.</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Santa:</strong><br> I don&#39;t have any witty name for this form, so let&#39;s<br> stick with the plain and simple Nemo Santa.</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Santa:</strong><br> Alternatively, Nemo Porter, since my standard<br> function is delivering requested packages.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> \u2014</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> \u2014</p><hr><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Santa:</strong><br> So I&#39;m Nemo Santa. Any problems?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> N-no, the red cap looks great on you. And your<br> moustache is...yes.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It&#39;s a dignified mustachio, an honor to Captain Nemo&#39;s<br> legacy... Is it a disguise piece?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> (Nodding a &quot;Yeah, yeah&quot;)</p><hr><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Santa:</strong><br> Less of a disguise piece and more an expression of<br> how I feel. I thought my body and spirit needed some<br> facial hair while I&#39;m in Santa mode.</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Santa:</strong><br> No, forget what you just heard. Some things are best<br> left unsaid. I only passed by to say goodbye before<br> departing.</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Santa:</strong><br> It turns out Santa Claus has a Skill that picks up on<br> people&#39;s wishes for his arrival.</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Santa:</strong><br> So I opened a support ticket for each request and now<br> the task list has over 300 tickets.</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Santa:</strong><br> And the Servants are currently spread all around the<br> world.</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Santa:</strong><br> That&#39;s more hard work than you two can handle.</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Santa:</strong><br> As your captain, no, as your Santa, I can&#39;t exploit your<br> labor after you&#39;ve been nice kids the whole year.</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Santa:</strong><br> I can handle this year&#39;s Christmas alone\u2014<br> or rather, with the crew.</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Santa:</strong><br> Unlike other Santas, I have a 4x4, a computer that can<br> tell me the most efficient present delivery route,</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Santa:</strong><br> and an anchor hook that can get me into anywhere.<br> Trust me, the delivery process will be over in a cinch<br> with my cutting-edge equipment.</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Santa:</strong><br> Do not follow me out there. Are we clear on that?</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Santa:</strong><br> Alright... I can wrap this up in seven days. I&#39;ll be<br> reporting to you at the end of each day.</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Santa:</strong><br> So you just relax and enjoy your winter vacation with<br> Mash. Resting is an essential part of a Master&#39;s duty.</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Santa:</strong><br> Copy that? You two have a cake ready in Chaldea for<br> when I&#39;m back.</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Santa:</strong><br> The shop and item exchange will be operational,<br> of course. I understand the exchanging shop is the<br> star atop your Christmas tree.</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Santa:</strong><br> Nemo Porter is the perfect Santa. Absolutely flawless,<br> you could say.</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Santa:</strong><br> Bye then. Merry Christmas.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> \u2014HUH!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Sorry, the moustache&#39;s impact got to me and I didn&#39;t hear a word...</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Indeed... I also don&#39;t know how to comment on his<br> manliness...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Now that I&#39;ve had time to collect myself and feel more<br> assured... I&#39;m grateful that Captain Nemo became<br> Santa, but I feel like things could&#39;ve been different...</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> I know, right? I was totally ROBBED!</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> I wasn&#39;t counting on Nemo to take the Santa Saint<br> Graph first...</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> (Sniff) What am I supposed to say to the Senpais all<br> over the world who patiently waited with faith that this<br> year would be the year of BB Santa...?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> BB!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> No faith here whatsoever!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> BB!? When did you get here?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Also, my apprehensions weren&#39;t about who gets to<br> have the Santa Saint Graph...</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Yes, I know. It was just a little quip of BB humor.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Your problem is with Nemo Porter&#39;s work policies.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> The \u201CI don&#39;t need anyone else to deliver the Christmas<br> presents\u201D part, right, Mash?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes. I believe that&#39;s too much even for Nemo,<br> considering that all the Servants are in their lands of<br> choice for Christmas...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> They all just do whatever they want...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I think Nemo can handle it, but...</p><hr><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I wanna help. And not because of the Santa Mystic Code.</p><hr><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I agree. I&#39;d love to go after him and offer our help right<br> now...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> But Nemo has other plans, so I don&#39;t believe he&#39;d be<br> happy about it...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> True...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Captain Nemo is a guy who values discipline over kindness...</p><hr><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Then approach it from a different angle.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Nemo Porter only told you not to follow him.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> He never said you can&#39;t do any Santa work. Soooo...</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> If you really want to take any part in this operation,<br> I have a few ideas.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Like what?</p><hr><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> How about making his route safer?</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Nemo Santa said his delivery schedule will last seven<br> days, meaning his route is split into seven areas.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> There will be obstacles and enemies along the way,<br> and taking each of them down will be exhausting even<br> for Santa Claus.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> That&#39;s where you come in\u2014</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> We&#39;ll traverse the routes before he does and remove<br> the obstacles!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I agree that this would qualify as both a separate<br> activity and be helpful to Nemo!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Well said, Mash! Christmas is sure to have traffic jams.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Infrastructure improvements are always nice!</p><hr><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Are we settled? Then I&#39;m going to get informed on<br> the area division.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Knowing Nemo Santa&#39;s personality, the routes will be<br> the ones most efficient and to-the-point.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> I&#39;ll calculate it in a snap and get there ahead of<br> everyone to set missions for you to clean up\u2661</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Oh right, the Earth is bleached so the snow-piled<br> roads are actually sand! You can&#39;t ask for a winter<br> more Chaldean than that!</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> BB does LOVE seeing a Senpai working [\u2642 himself /\u2640\uFE0F herself] to the<br> bone on the holiday season!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Thank you for the advice and mission drafting, BB!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Let&#39;s go, Master! We&#39;ll be the light on Nemo Santa&#39;s<br> path!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> OK! It&#39;s Christmassing time!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Leave it to me! Nemo Santa&#39;s road will be free and clear!</p><hr><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> \u2014By the way,</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> why are you doing this, BB?</p><hr><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Hmm. Good question...</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Partly frustration that I failed to claim the Santa Saint<br> Graph, but mainly that it sucks that I haven&#39;t been<br> getting any significant screen time lately...</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Well, also a special sympathy toward the Heroic Spirit<br> Nemo! We share the Imaginary Numbers element!</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> I&#39;ll help getting you to the designated areas.<br> My Zero Shift isn&#39;t the most refined, but I find it&#39;s<br> better than going on foot.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Well then, let&#39;s begin Operation: Holiday Season<br> Route Maintenance.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> These seven long days will pass in a flash.<br> Do your best every day, Senpai\u2661</p><h2 id="day-1" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#day-1" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Day 1</h2><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><ul><li>6:00 PM -</li><li>End of business hours -</li></ul><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Thanks to BB&#39;s Zero Shift, we managed to get back<br> with time to spare.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Today&#39;s business should come to an end right this<br> minute...</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Marine:</strong><br> Yoo-hoo, coming iiiin! Team Nautilus completed<br> today&#39;s deliveries!</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Marine:</strong><br> Look, Master! Don&#39;t I look awesome in my Santa suit?</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Santa:</strong><br> Behave, Marine.</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Santa:</strong><br> I only brought you along to stop your pestering.<br> If you&#39;re going to make a ruckus, you&#39;re not joining<br> next time.</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Marine:</strong><br> Aye-aye, sir! Shutting up now!</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Marine:</strong><br> I just wanted to show off the new outfit we Marines<br> are wearing.

It was an easy delivery.</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Santa:</strong><br> It&#39;s tomorrow that I&#39;ll first buckle down for this Santa<br> business. Oh, but...</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Santa:</strong><br> Today&#39;s last delivery was memorable.<br> Also, there&#39;s a present addressed to you.</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Santa:</strong><br> Do you want to know who it&#39;s from?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Of course.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Who could it be...?</p><hr><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Santa:</strong><br> Alright. Long story short, the last location I visited<br> today was\u2014</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Anning:</strong><br> Hoh? Look who it is. Nemo! What brings you here?<br> Felt like visiting my place?</p><p><strong>Anning:</strong><br> Be my guest. I&#39;ma go brew you some coffee!</p><p><strong>Anning:</strong><br> Ya know, I&#39;ve always felt this special affinity for you,<br> Nemo. I mean, a nautilus is almost a belemnite,<br> am I right?</p><p><strong>Anning:</strong><br> Surely you&#39;ve battled a living prehistoric monster<br> under the deep seas.</p><p><strong>Anning:</strong><br> Might&#39;ve even seen a pterosaur in the flesh.<br> Come sip some tea with me as we watch the Lyme<br> Regis coastline.</p><p><strong>Anning:</strong><br> Although that place is an empty land covered in snow<br> now, so we won&#39;t be able to see the ocean or the shore!</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Santa:</strong><br> I&#39;m sorry about that. It might be me that&#39;s the cause<br> of the snow.</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Santa:</strong><br> Merry Christmas, Mary Anning. I know it&#39;s early,<br> but I&#39;m here to deliver your present.</p><p><strong>Anning:</strong><br> Huh? Christmas? You&#39;re working as Santa, mister?</p><p><strong>Anning:</strong><br> Hell, you didn&#39;t ride here on the Nautilus? Then I want<br> nothing from you. Bugger off.</p><p><strong>Anning:</strong><br> &#39;Sides, I don&#39;t trust \u201CSanta\u201D, \u201CChristmas\u201D, or any other<br> of these transparent acts of goodwill.</p><p><strong>Anning:</strong><br> Society&#39;s about give and take. Trading. I&#39;ll have ya<br> know I&#39;m a capable merchant.</p><p><strong>Anning:</strong><br> I may love me some cash, but I&#39;m not brave enough to<br> accept a gift given for no reason.</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Santa:</strong><br> There is a reason. Santa makes his presents in<br> response to calls for them. You wanted me here.</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Santa:</strong><br> Your name is clearly listed in the list of the wishful.</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Santa:</strong><br> I&#39;m here for your delivery. As Santa Claus.</p><p><strong>Anning:</strong><br> Hoho. You&#39;re saying this box has what I want?</p><p><strong>Anning:</strong><br> Say what it is. If it really is what I want, I&#39;ll take it.</p><p><strong>Anning:</strong><br> Well, I already gave you the answer out loud!<br> I know what you&#39;re thinking, you can&#39;t hide it.</p><p><strong>Anning:</strong><br> \u201CMary Anning is a barbaric fossil digger and a<br> merchant who only cares &#39;bout money\u201D!</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Santa:</strong><br> I can&#39;t disagree. You&#39;re very levelheaded about your<br> finances, but I didn&#39;t bring you cash.</p><p><strong>Anning:</strong><br> Ah! Doggy clothes, the #1 ego boost item for smug<br> pet owners...!</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Santa:</strong><br> That&#39;s what the list said. But I don&#39;t think this is about<br> the owner&#39;s unflinching ego.</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Santa:</strong><br> Nothing pleases a loyal dog more than seeing the joy<br> on their owner&#39;s face.</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Santa:</strong><br> If you believe your dog looks precious in these clothes,<br> your happiness will make your dog happy, don&#39;t you<br> agree?</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Santa:</strong><br> Besides, these clothes are very resilient. They<br> shouldn&#39;t tear in case of a landslide.</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Santa:</strong><br> This is what you wished for. If you don&#39;t want it,<br> I&#39;ll take it back.</p><p><strong>Anning:</strong><br> Cripes, I want it! Nemo, are you an angel!?</p><p><strong>Anning:</strong><br> But ain&#39;t this Santa business bloody awful!?<br> You walk through all that snow to deliver gifts and not<br> get paid for it?</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Santa:</strong><br> That&#39;s how Santa Claus is. But your case is an<br> exception.</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Santa:</strong><br> Mary Anning, there is a reason why I chose you to be<br> the last visit of the day.</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Santa:</strong><br> Would you tell me your stories as a digger who never<br> failed to excavate precious fossils?</p><p><strong>Anning:</strong><br> Blimey, you couldn&#39;t ask for a better sweetener!<br> How could I say no to someone asking me to regale<br> the saga of my glory?</p><p><strong>Anning:</strong><br> Do you wanna hear about my debut excavation,<br> the ichthyosaurus? Or do you prefer my most major<br> work, the plesiosaurus?</p><p><strong>Anning:</strong><br> Ask for any story you like! I could even teach you how<br> to excavate fossils!</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Santa:</strong><br> And that&#39;s what happened. Anning is a much more<br> eloquent talker than she initially seems.</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Santa:</strong><br> It sounded like she could go on for hours still,<br> but she knew exactly when to wrap things up.</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Santa:</strong><br> And then she gave me a present.</p><p><strong>Anning:</strong><br> So, uh...can you take this?</p><p><strong>Anning:</strong><br> Now that I&#39;m home, I got to relax and polish fossils...<br> I can hope one&#39;ll work as a good luck charm.</p><p><strong>Anning:</strong><br> It feels bad not to give anything in return. Merchant&#39;s<br> pride.</p><p><strong>Anning:</strong><br> There&#39;s one for you and one for Master. To tell you<br> the truth, one of them was actually for me!</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Santa:</strong><br> I see. You returned home in order to give this to<br> Master.</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Santa:</strong><br> Thank you, Anning. I&#39;ll gladly accept it.</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Santa:</strong><br> This belemnite fossil does indeed resemble a nautilus.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> A good luck charm from Anning...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> (Thank you, Anning.)</p><hr><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Santa:</strong><br> That&#39;s all from me. I&#39;d better rest. My day starts early<br> tomorrow.</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Santa:</strong><br> Master, today proved that I can handle the present<br> delivery on my own.</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Santa:</strong><br> It bears repeating: do not follow Santa. Are we clear?</p><h2 id="day-2" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#day-2" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Day 2</h2><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><ul><li>6:00 PM -</li><li>End of business hours -</li></ul><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Once again, we made the route as safe as possible.<br> We&#39;ve been quite efficient, wouldn&#39;t you agree?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> By the way, Senpai, have you already been to the<br> event currency shop?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It&#39;s a very lively place, since it&#39;s operated by the<br> Marines that stayed behind in the Border&#39;s moorage.</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Nurse:</strong><br> I&#39;m glad to hear positive reviews of the event shop.</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Nurse:</strong><br> There were concerns the Marines would be getting<br> into trouble.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Nurse!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> The Santa hat looks great on you!</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Nurse:</strong><br> Doesn&#39;t it?

Oh, I forgot the important part.</p><hr><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Nurse:</strong><br> Good day, Fujimaru and Mash.</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Nurse:</strong><br> I&#39;m visiting because I still hadn&#39;t given you my formal<br> greetings.</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Nurse:</strong><br> And naturally, I&#39;m accompanying our Leader.</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Santa:</strong><br> Sorry for the unannounced visit. I trust that you<br> wouldn&#39;t do anything unnecessary, but I&#39;ll ask anyways.<br> Did you have a quiet, enjoyable day?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Y-yeah, I&#39;ve been relaxing in my bedroom.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> N-nothing unusual happened.</p><hr><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Santa:</strong><br> I&#39;d hope so.</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Nurse:</strong><br> Leader, I don&#39;t agree with demanding them to spend<br> all of Christmas in their rooms.</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Nurse:</strong><br> Why not let them have a safe, injury-free adventure in<br> the simulator?</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Nurse:</strong><br> Oh, we finished delivering to the England-France<br> region after getting a start on that yesterday.<br> Here&#39;s the ticket list.</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Nurse:</strong><br> Also, here&#39;s a present from Habetrot to the both of<br> you.</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Nurse:</strong><br> I believe it&#39;s a set of warmers to match with your<br> Santa outfit.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Thank you. So today you visited Habetrot?</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Santa:</strong><br> Yes. She requested me to say hi to you. And she was<br> with unexpected company\u2013</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Britomart:</strong><br> My apologies! I didn&#39;t realize you were Santa Claus!</p><p><strong>Britomart:</strong><br> When I saw everything suddenly get covered in snow,<br> I assumed it was the work of a wicked magician and<br> engaged in full-force combat!</p><p><strong>Britomart:</strong><br> I should have associated the snow with Christmas and<br> the red cap and sled combo with Santa...</p><p><strong>Britomart:</strong><br> Blame it all on Britomart, you didn&#39;t deserve any<br> suspicion.</p><p><strong>Britomart:</strong><br> Err, I know this is rich coming from me, but are you<br> hurt!?</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Santa:</strong><br> No problem.<br> As you can see, I&#39;m a professional Santa.</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Santa:</strong><br> Our schedule accounts for the possibility of some<br> skirmishes. One in every three visits has us mistaken for<br> an invader.</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Santa:</strong><br> But it was a surprise to see you here. Is this address<br> your homeland, Habetrot?</p><p><strong>Habetrot:</strong><br> Yeah, you came to the right place! Britain is our<br> birthplace!</p><p><strong>Habetrot:</strong><br> Britomart and Oberon are from the same place as me,<br> so I invited the two over for a little tea party.</p><p><strong>Habetrot:</strong><br> We&#39;re chatting about Morgan! Britomart is always<br> wanting to know more about her, see?</p><p><strong>Habetrot:</strong><br> So she came to hear from Morgan&#39;s tea buddy<br> Habetrot and the self-proclaimed Morgan expert<br> Oberon!</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong><br> That&#39;s right. I heard she&#39;d have some nice snacks to<br> eat, so I took this fine opportunity to visit.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong><br> As for the Morgan talk, I&#39;m sticking only to the<br> harmless, safe-to-speak parts. Don&#39;t want to shatter<br> her dreams, eh?</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong><br> Besides, I may know a lot about Fairy Britain,<br> but I never got a chance to see the real Britain before.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong><br> I&#39;m arguably a Pan-Human fairy. No harm in taking a<br> look with my own eyes.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong><br> That said, there&#39;s nothing to see here, no thanks to<br> the bleaching! Hahaha!</p><p><strong>Britomart:</strong><br> It&#39;s mortifying, really... If I was at least as developed<br> as my mother, I could deploy a temporary fairyland,</p><p><strong>Britomart:</strong><br> allowing King Oberon to see the beauty of the original<br> Britain...</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong><br> Don&#39;t bother yourself for my sake, Britomart.<br> Raise your chin. Dejection doesn&#39;t suit a fairy&#39;s face.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong><br> I can intuit how beautiful the land was just by looking<br> at you.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong><br> There&#39;s no need to see the real thing,</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong><br> which means I can simply wait for a better<br> opportunity in the future, no?</p><p><strong>Britomart:</strong><br> \u2014!</p><p><strong>G\uFF1ANemo\xA0Santa:</strong><br> (The moment she fell to her knees, he took<br> Britomart&#39;s hand so naturally!)</p><p><strong>Habetrot:</strong><br> (Uh-huh. Taking her hand is an understatement.<br> He smoothly rose her back to her feet when his<br> \u201Cbetter opportunity\u201D came.)</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong><br> So? Is Santa Claus here to give Habetrot something?</p><p><strong>B\uFF1ANemo\xA0Santa:</strong><br> Yes. My business is with Habetrot. All of you being<br> here too was unexpected.</p><p><strong>B\uFF1ANemo\xA0Santa:</strong><br> What she wants is marked as personal.<br> May I ask you to relocate?</p><p><strong>Habetrot:</strong><br> Hm? What, am I the only one getting a present?<br> What about Oberon and Britomart?</p><p><strong>B\uFF1ANemo\xA0Santa:</strong><br> The two of them are not on the checklist. It must<br> mean they don&#39;t have anything they want at the<br> moment.</p><p><strong>Britomart:</strong><br> Correct! I&#39;m still in training! I&#39;m saving the wishing for<br> when I&#39;m fully qualified!</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong><br> It&#39;s the other way around here. I have too many things<br> I want.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong><br> I suppose I&#39;m off the list because there&#39;s no one<br> present option I could settle on.</p><p><strong>Britomart:</strong><br> I see... Then if we have countless Christmases,<br> you&#39;ll eventually get your wish granted, King Oberon!</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong><br> \u2014</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong><br> True. With countless wants, one at least has a good<br> chance of coming true.</p><p><strong>I\uFF1ANemo\xA0Santa:</strong><br> The bystanders are away now.<br> Then this is for you, Habetrot. Merry Christmas.</p><p><strong>Habetrot:</strong><br> Thank you, Santa Claus. Can I open it right away?</p><p><strong>I\uFF1ANemo\xA0Santa:</strong><br> Be my guest. Verify if it really is what you want.<br> Hearing you got the wrong thing would harm my<br> Santa credentials.</p><p><strong>Habetrot:</strong><br> Then don&#39;t mind if I do...</p><p><strong>Habetrot:</strong><br> ...!</p><p><strong>I\uFF1ANemo\xA0Santa:</strong><br> Was that the right thing?</p><p><strong>Habetrot:</strong><br> Yup! This is what I wanted! You know how I&#39;m the<br> yarn-spinning fairy of the spinning wheel?</p><p><strong>Habetrot:</strong><br> My lips often get inflamed thanks to all that<br> thread-licking. That&#39;s what this balm is for. It&#39;ll prove a<br> helpful work tool.</p><p><strong>Habetrot:</strong><br> But...it&#39;s also make-up, kinda. Though I&#39;m still far off<br> from becoming a bride.</p><p><strong>I\uFF1ANemo\xA0Santa:</strong><br> You&#39;re not that far. You&#39;d be wasting the make-up<br> part if you use it in your alone time instead of flaunting<br> it.</p><p><strong>Habetrot:</strong><br> R-really? Won&#39;t people laugh at me?</p><p><strong>I\uFF1ANemo\xA0Santa:</strong><br> Absolutely not. You&#39;ll look great. You have Santa&#39;s<br> seal of approval.</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Nurse:</strong><br> I can&#39;t go into further detail on what her present was,<br> but that&#39;s the general gist of the situation.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> So Habetrot went off to her homeland.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Oberon and Britomart are also English heroes,<br> so I trust that they could have a stimulating chat.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Gotcha.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Did anything happen after?</p><hr><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Santa:</strong><br> No, nothing. We made small talk with Habetrot and<br> returned to Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Santa:</strong><br> Nurse, we must take our leave.<br> Tomorrow&#39;s schedule will be pretty tight.</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Santa:</strong><br> Our mission has just begun. Stay alert.</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Nurse:</strong><br> Yes, of course, Captain. The voyage will be long.</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Nurse:</strong><br> If you&#39;ll excuse us, Fujimaru and Mash.</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Nurse:</strong><br> Don&#39;t stay up too late and refrain from midnight<br> snacks. Remember to sleep early and wake up early.</p><h2 id="day-3" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#day-3" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Day 3</h2><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Santa:</strong><br> All hands, revise the delivery list.

Anythin&#39; on your mind?</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Santa:</strong><br> Not really. I thought we had a lucky first day,<br> but now the lack of enemies on our trajectories is<br> starting to look unnatural.</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Santa:</strong><br> I suppose I&#39;ll have to question BB later.</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Santa:</strong><br> Marines, we won&#39;t be cutting short the number of<br> Zero Sails. Part of the point is running an endurance<br> test.</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Santa:</strong><br> Keep your eyes peeled for any irregularities in the<br> sailing Nautilus. That&#39;s your task.</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Marine:</strong><br> Yessir... But don&#39;t push yourself too hard, okay,<br> Captain?</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Marine:</strong><br> If anything happens to the Nautilus, you&#39;re the one<br> taking the damage, not us.</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Santa:</strong><br> I know. Now let&#39;s begin today&#39;s deliveries.</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Santa:</strong><br> Santa Claus can&#39;t fall behind schedule. We will meet<br> the appointed times, without fail.</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>J\uFF1ANemo\xA0Engineer:</strong><br> Stop, STOP!<br> That&#39;s enough, ol&#39; Nikola!</p><p><strong>J\uFF1ANemo\xA0Engineer:</strong><br> Don&#39;t you recognize me?<br> Nemo Engineer! Your birdwatchin&#39; buddy!</p><p><strong>Nikola\xA0Tesla:</strong><br> Oh dear. I didn&#39;t notice you, Madam Engineer!</p><p><strong>Nikola\xA0Tesla:</strong><br> I beg your pardon. How could a genius of my caliber<br> fail to tell a friend apart from a wraith?</p><p><strong>Nikola\xA0Tesla:</strong><br> Letting nostalgia get the better of me was a mistake.<br> Doubly so when my trip down memory lane was over<br> a past regret.</p><p><strong>Nikola\xA0Tesla:</strong><br> My belated greetings, Nemo Engineer and...</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Santa:</strong><br> Nemo Santa. I&#39;m currently away from my captain post.</p><p><strong>Nikola\xA0Tesla:</strong><br> I see. Good day, Nemo Santa.<br> I&#39;m a genius. The name is Nikola Tesla.</p><p><strong>Nikola\xA0Tesla:</strong><br> A pioneer inventor beyond compare in human history.</p><p><strong>Nikola\xA0Tesla:</strong><br> The true king of electricity, the one who brought light<br> to the daily lives of the common man,</p><p><strong>Nikola\xA0Tesla:</strong><br> and the eccentric, unlucky pigeon-loving gentleman<br> who ended one step short of illuminating the world.</p><p><strong>Nikola\xA0Tesla:</strong><br> Also a friend of your other persona, Nemo Engineer.<br> You may address me like a good friend.</p><p><strong>Nikola\xA0Tesla:</strong><br> Or if you prefer, like teacher and student. Perhaps<br> father and son. Alternatively, father and daughter.</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Santa:</strong><br> O-okay. I appreciate the sentiment, but no thanks.</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Santa:</strong><br> (Sigh)... I didn&#39;t know you were friends with Engineer.</p><p><strong>Nikola\xA0Tesla:</strong><br> Oh. So your information sharing is not<br> all-encompassing?</p><p><strong>Nikola\xA0Tesla:</strong><br> Well, everyone has a secret they want to keep to<br> themselves. Madam Engineer is still a young maiden at<br> heart.</p><p><strong>Nikola\xA0Tesla:</strong><br> Being on affable terms with a perfect gentleman such<br> as myself is certainly something she wouldn&#39;t be able<br> to share with her siblings.</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Engineer:</strong><br> Hell no! I simply don&#39;t report irrelevant information!</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Engineer:</strong><br> Actually, what are you even doin&#39; here? We&#39;re in<br> North America. Isn&#39;t your hometown in Croatia?</p><p><strong>Nikola\xA0Tesla:</strong><br> You&#39;re correct, but the United States is the country<br> where I made the most important memories of my life.</p><p><strong>Nikola\xA0Tesla:</strong><br> Chiefly so in this land. I wanted to pass by one last<br> time before the final battle to recover mankind&#39;s future.</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Santa:</strong><br> I see... I also found that unusual. We&#39;re in Long Island,<br> New York.</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Santa:</strong><br> It&#39;s the site of the Wardenclyffe Tower, a super-long-<br> range radio tower and transmitter meant to ultimately<br> supply energy to the entire planet.</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Santa:</strong><br> That was the peak and final destination of Nikola<br> Tesla&#39;s dream.</p><p><strong>Nikola\xA0Tesla:</strong><br> I wouldn&#39;t call it a final destination.<br> That was merely one of my many ideas.</p><p><strong>Nikola\xA0Tesla:</strong><br> But I&#39;ll have to admit it was the most valued period of<br> my life. I still envision it when I have a motivation spike,<br> oh yes.</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Engineer:</strong><br> Oh, that thing that shows up when you do your Noble<br> Phastasm! The huge generator skyscraper, really<br> snazzy stuff!</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Santa:</strong><br> It&#39;s not a skyscraper, Engineer, it&#39;s a tower.<br> And it&#39;s not a generator either.</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Santa:</strong><br> It&#39;s a device that sends electricity...as far as the public<br> eye is concerned. In reality, it&#39;s Nikola Tesla&#39;s<br> ultra-scientific teleporter.</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Engineer\xA0&amp;\xA0Nikola\xA0Tesla:</strong><br> It&#39;s what?</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Santa:</strong><br> A teleporter.</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Santa:</strong><br> A device that instantly sends away not only data and<br> energy, but physical matter from point A to point B.<br> Is that not what it is?</p><p><strong>Nikola\xA0Tesla:</strong><br> Wait, hold on one minute. I don&#39;t recall making any<br> matter replicator or teleporter.</p><p><strong>Nikola\xA0Tesla:</strong><br> Your drivel makes me nauseous, Nemo Santa.<br> Where did you learn such pseudo-science?</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Santa:</strong><br> Huh? It&#39;s, you know, the thing that got used in the<br> Philadelphia Experiment...</p><p><strong>Nikola\xA0Tesla:</strong><br> I&#39;d never collaborate in military experimentation!<br> The tower is a voltage generator!</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Santa:</strong><br> No way... You mean Nikola Tesla, I mean, the Tesla<br> Coil can&#39;t teleport physical matter...?</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Engineer:</strong><br> Darn, I&#39;ve never seen him this dejected before.<br> Hey, ol&#39; Nikola, it is really impossible for you?</p><p><strong>Nikola\xA0Tesla:</strong><br> (My impulses tell me to call the idea proposterous...<br> But I&#39;m not sure about taking away a boy&#39;s sincere<br> dreams...)</p><p><strong>Nikola\xA0Tesla:</strong><br> Nay. Not to toot my own horn, but the Tesla Coil has<br> several possible applications.</p><p><strong>Nikola\xA0Tesla:</strong><br> So I cannot affirm it is absolutely impossible.<br> There may be a genius capable of utilizing it in ways<br> that defy even my imagination.</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Santa:</strong><br> I see. Like what, for example?</p><p><strong>Nikola\xA0Tesla:</strong><br> Well, music for instance? Just keep in mind that the<br> Tesla Coil can do anything.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><ul><li>6:00 PM -</li><li>End of business hours -</li></ul><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Engineer:</strong><br> Hey there, comin&#39; in!

With that settled, here, for you.<br> It&#39;s no substitute for turkey, I know.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> What is it?</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Baker:</strong><br> A present from a very heated Servant to his Master,<br> so the cold doesn&#39;t get the better of you.</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Santa:</strong><br> Yes. As it has already become a routine, we were<br> asked to give this to you.</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Santa:</strong><br> Good grief. Before meeting him, I already knew this is<br> how things would turn out, but wow, winter did nothing<br> to get that Servant less heated.</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>A\u015Bvatth\u0101man:</strong><br> Well, it if isn&#39;t NEMO!!! Hey, what&#39;s going on?</p><p><strong>A\u015Bvatth\u0101man:</strong><br> My bad for that. But you gotta understand that the<br> sudden snow is a shocker. Don&#39;t blame me!</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Santa:</strong><br> Apologies for that. It&#39;s my fault. I should consider<br> myself lucky that my suit didn&#39;t burn.</p><p><strong>A\u015Bvatth\u0101man:</strong><br> Oh, right, that&#39;s not your usual get-up.<br> Nice and red! I like that color.</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Santa:</strong><br> I don&#39;t think it&#39;s that big of a deal...</p><p><strong>A\u015Bvatth\u0101man:</strong><br> But what do you want with me? I&#39;m here waitin&#39; for<br> that Santa fella with my present\u2013</p><p><strong>A\u015Bvatth\u0101man:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Santa:</strong><br> ...?</p><p><strong>A\u015Bvatth\u0101man:</strong><br> Well, it if isn&#39;t SANTA!!! I almost missed you with your<br> lack of gravitas!</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Santa:</strong><br> ...Excuse me, what?</p><p><strong>A\u015Bvatth\u0101man:</strong><br> A-ah. You&#39;re (almost) Santa-ish enough. No<br> questioning that.</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Professor:</strong><br> Showing my face in the interest of curiosity~<br> What&#39;s the take on me~?</p><p><strong>A\u015Bvatth\u0101man:</strong><br> Oh, hi, reindeer.</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Professor:</strong><br> Well, that was disappointi~ng.<br> Much quieter than I expected.</p><p><strong>A\u015Bvatth\u0101man:</strong><br> Anyway, you got the present here, right? Is that what<br> the deal is?</p><p><strong>O\uFF1ANemo\xA0Santa:</strong><br> Of course. Santa Claus exists to give nice children<br> what they want.</p><p><strong>O\uFF1ANemo\xA0Santa:</strong><br> If you receive the wrong item, you can get it<br> reimbursed. A professional Santa accepts refunds.</p><p><strong>A\u015Bvatth\u0101man:</strong><br> Thank ya kindly! Then I&#39;m gonna check what&#39;s in the<br> box.</p><p><strong>A\u015Bvatth\u0101man:</strong><br> Oil...? Is it for cooking? Am I supposed to, like...<br> fry some potatoes with it?</p><p><strong>O\uFF1ANemo\xA0Santa:</strong><br> No, no.</p><p><strong>O\uFF1ANemo\xA0Santa:</strong><br> It&#39;s for coating your weapon...the Chakram.<br> Aren&#39;t you always rolling it on the ground?</p><p><strong>A\u015Bvatth\u0101man:</strong><br> Yup. When it&#39;s Noble Phantasm time, I give it the boot.</p><p><strong>O\uFF1ANemo\xA0Santa:</strong><br> I know. Professional football players do the same.<br> Aren&#39;t you bothered by the dirt stains from using it all<br> the time?</p><p><strong>A\u015Bvatth\u0101man:</strong><br> Sure, I am! But I just whack it enough to brush off the<br> dirt.</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Engineer:</strong><br> Not all of it!</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Engineer:</strong><br> Dirt and rust that won&#39;t come off are the nemesis of<br> all engines! That&#39;s what this stuff is for!</p><p><strong>A\u015Bvatth\u0101man:</strong><br> Gotcha! Wash it with this oil and it&#39;ll be all fixed up!</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Engineer:</strong><br> Yup! You got one great gear there, so take care of it<br> properly!</p><p><strong>A\u015Bvatth\u0101man:</strong><br> You&#39;re pretty passionate about that...!</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Professor:</strong><br> It&#39;s a super oil, so it&#39;ll also dirtproof it. The filth will<br> bounce right off at tremendous speeds.</p><p><strong>A\u015Bvatth\u0101man:</strong><br> So it solves both stain and friction issues? Hell yeah!<br> You some kinda god of oil?</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Professor:</strong><br> It&#39;s industrial grade.</p><p><strong>A\u015Bvatth\u0101man:</strong><br> Never heard of any god by the name of<br> Industrialgrade...</p><p><strong>A\u015Bvatth\u0101man:</strong><br> Well, I&#39;ll gladly take it. Thank ya!</p><p><strong>O\uFF1ANemo\xA0Santa:</strong><br> You&#39;re welcome. By the way, don&#39;t consider this a<br> payment request for the present.</p><p><strong>A\u015Bvatth\u0101man:</strong><br> Hah?</p><p><strong>O\uFF1ANemo\xA0Santa:</strong><br> \u2014Asvatthaman. I have one question for you.</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Santa:</strong><br> That&#39;s all. No issues. Mission complete.<br> This box is from Asvatthaman to you.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> All right, let&#39;s open it.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I see... It appears to be a piece of jewelry. Is it a<br> bracelet?</p><p><strong>A\u015Bvatth\u0101man:</strong><br> Yeah, and take this one with you while you&#39;re at it.<br> A gift for Master.</p><p><strong>A\u015Bvatth\u0101man:</strong><br> I had already resigned myself to the idea that I&#39;d only<br> be able to give my gift after Christmas&#39;d passed.</p><p><strong>A\u015Bvatth\u0101man:</strong><br> But if you&#39;re willing to deliver it, I&#39;d appreciate it.</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Santa:</strong><br> Fine... One more present to Master. I suppose<br> everyone had the same idea.</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Santa:</strong><br> May I ask what is inside? Knowing you, there&#39;s a<br> chance it might be an explosive, even if that&#39;s not the<br> intended use.</p><p><strong>A\u015Bvatth\u0101man:</strong><br> Don&#39;t worry. It&#39;s just a rock I had no use for.</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Santa:</strong><br> This is...a ruby?</p><p><strong>A\u015Bvatth\u0101man:</strong><br> Yeah.</p><p><strong>A\u015Bvatth\u0101man:</strong><br> After this one war, I was cursed to wander for 3,000<br> years.</p><p><strong>A\u015Bvatth\u0101man:</strong><br> I don&#39;t even remember where I went and how.<br> Just that it was a real painful walk.</p><p><strong>A\u015Bvatth\u0101man:</strong><br> After all, I didn&#39;t have any destination.<br> I just kept walking for the sake of it.</p><p><strong>A\u015Bvatth\u0101man:</strong><br> For trivial reasons, I remembered that I was atoning<br> for a sin.</p><p><strong>A\u015Bvatth\u0101man:</strong><br> I still don&#39;t remember if I was forgiven...<br> But regardless, I had the will to atone.</p><p><strong>A\u015Bvatth\u0101man:</strong><br> So here&#39;s my advice from experience:</p><p><strong>A\u015Bvatth\u0101man:</strong><br> Never forget what got you takin&#39; that first step.<br> Remember it every time you see the shine of this<br> stone.</p><p><strong>A\u015Bvatth\u0101man:</strong><br> Pretty meaningful promise, ain&#39;t it? It&#39;s got that \u201Cmay<br> your journey be blessed and fortunate\u201D meaning to it.</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Santa:</strong><br> This bracelet is not just lucky. It&#39;s also charged with a<br> little bit of magical energy.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Yeah, it&#39;s warming.</p><hr><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Santa:</strong><br> I see. He didn&#39;t want to you to be defeated by the<br> cold and loneliness of winter.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Master will need that this winter. Thank you very<br> much.</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Santa:</strong><br> Thank Asvatthaman instead.</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Santa:</strong><br> That&#39;s all from me. Goodbye.

Success or failure,<br> the result matters not to the world.</p><p><strong>First\xA0Hassan:</strong><br> Should thy might be insufficient, thou shall have no<br> skeleton to leave behind. Even thy name will be gone<br> without trace. Albeit, thou wert always named \u201CNo One\u201D.</p><p><strong>First\xA0Hassan:</strong><br> No settlement will make itself necessary.<br> \u2013Thus, what reason remains to dwell on thy deed?</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Santa:</strong><br> I see.

I feel like that&#39;s finally taken a<br> weight off my shoulders.</p><p><strong>First\xA0Hassan:</strong><br> Though take heed.</p><p><strong>First\xA0Hassan:</strong><br> For spending an eternity at the border of life and<br> death, I hath become the border itself.</p><p><strong>First\xA0Hassan:</strong><br> For being so immersed in Death, I hath become Death<br> itself.</p><p><strong>First\xA0Hassan:</strong><br> Embrace that which should not be, and thou too shalt<br> become something that ought not to be\u2013</p><p><strong>First\xA0Hassan:</strong><br> That which brings about the invisible becomes<br> invisible.</p><p><strong>First\xA0Hassan:</strong><br> In the world metaphysical, only faith doth save one<br> from losing their meaning.</p><p><strong>First\xA0Hassan:</strong><br> \u2014Remember this, Captain. So we may meet<br> again, at a distant intersection of causality.</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Nurse:</strong><br> Welcome back, Leader. Did you get your chance to<br> pay respects to the Old Man of the Mountain?</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Santa:</strong><br> Yeah, I did. And he was more frightening than I could<br> have ever imagined.</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Santa:</strong><br> It seemed like he didn&#39;t view our plans as any<br> different from his morning prayers.</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Santa:</strong><br> I asked if what we were doing was acceptable,<br> but he basically waved off my indecision.</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Santa:</strong><br> To sum it up, he told me,<br> \u201CDo what you want, I don&#39;t care\u201D.</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Nurse:</strong><br> My, how harsh. Then shall we proceed as planned?</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Santa:</strong><br> Yes. Marine, relay to Master that we won&#39;t be coming<br> back today.</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Santa:</strong><br> All hands to general quarters! Prepare for Imaginary<br> Numbers dive, Depth 7! Our target is the year 2015 AD!</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Santa:</strong><br> The ship will now travel back to the appointed date!</p><h2 id="day-7" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#day-7" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Day 7</h2><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Santa:</strong><br> Is everyone here? It&#39;s about time we go deliver the<br> presents, but first...</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Santa:</strong><br> There&#39;s something I must tell you. My true reason in<br> accepting the Santa Claus role.</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Santa:</strong><br> Santa Claus is a figure that delivers miracles to many<br> by the mere merit of being Santa Claus.</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Santa:</strong><br> He delivers presents to all who wish for it, wrapping<br> up the year with a nice bow.</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Santa:</strong><br> That is Santa Claus&#39; fundamental task and reason for<br> being. It&#39;s the wish of those gathered in the Holy Night.</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Santa:</strong><br> But that&#39;s the wish of all people. Not Santa Claus&#39;<br> own.</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Santa:</strong><br> I see no problem with Santa Claus&#39; duties and<br> personal wishes existing separately.</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Santa:</strong><br> Which gets us to my point\u2014</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Engineer:</strong><br> The introduction is takin&#39; forever, Captain Jerkass!<br> We all already know what this is about.</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Engineer:</strong><br> There&#39;s one [\u2642 dude /\u2640\uFE0F gal] we wanna gift of our own accord!</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Marine:</strong><br> That being Master, of course!</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Marine:</strong><br> And not the Master from current Chaldea. But Master<br> long before [\u2642 he /\u2640\uFE0F she] met us!</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Nurse:</strong><br> Yes. Because Triton is the child of the sea who<br> guarantees a safe voyage.</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Nurse:</strong><br> We shouldn&#39;t give a good luck charm when the<br> journey&#39;s end is in sight. It&#39;s best to give it at the<br> journey&#39;s start.</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Nurse:</strong><br> To put a tiny miracle under a sleeping [\u2642 boy /\u2640\uFE0F girl]&#39;s pillow.<br> That&#39;s a job for a Santa Claus.</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Baker:</strong><br> Yeah, you don&#39;t need to explain! We know how you<br> feel, Captain!</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Baker:</strong><br> The best present to the person we want to gift the<br> most... Right?</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Professor:</strong><br> Yu~p. That&#39;s a wonderful idea that will only work if<br> Santa Claus is no o~ne.</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Professor:</strong><br> Although it will be a challenge to accomplish it.</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Santa:</strong><br> Crew\u2014</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Santa:</strong><br> Yes, you&#39;re right. It&#39;s more of a desire than a motive.</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Santa:</strong><br> The person I want to gift isn&#39;t in the present.<br> No, to be more accurate, there would be no point in<br> giving them the gift now.</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Santa:</strong><br> Present-day Chaldea has enough capable fighters on<br> board. When they need help, they will have someone to<br> give it.</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Santa:</strong><br> But that&#39;s not true for the past&#39;s Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Santa:</strong><br> At the earliest days of correcting Singularities,<br> Chaldea couldn&#39;t even spare the time for a coffee<br> break. Thus\u2014</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Santa:</strong><br> To the Antarctic Chaldea base, 2015.</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Santa:</strong><br> I want to, as subtly as possible, deliver my utmost<br> respect to them before [\u2642 his /\u2640\uFE0F her] long journey comes to a<br> start.</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Santa:</strong><br> That&#39;s something only the Phantom Spirit Nemo<br> capable of Zero Sailing can attempt.</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Santa:</strong><br> One mistake while interfering with the past will end us.<br> If we change past events, no matter how insignificant,</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Santa:</strong><br> the force of historical correction will have no mercy in<br> making it so we never existed.</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Santa:</strong><br> If we even get there, anyway. Sailing to past<br> coordinates is no easy task.</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Santa:</strong><br> Each year we swim upstream carries a greater risk of<br> the Nautilus being crushed by the pressure.</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Santa:</strong><br> Each annual layer will put new obstacles in our path.</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Santa:</strong><br> Knowing that, will you humor my whim?</p><p><strong>Everyone:</strong><br> Absolutely!<br> Aye-aye, Captain!</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Santa:</strong><br> \u2013Thank you. Then let&#39;s review the operation.</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Santa:</strong><br> Even jumping through Imaginary Space, traveling to<br> the past is extremely difficult.</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Santa:</strong><br> We travel back one year per day, and upon reaching<br> each goal, we mark it with a PAPERMOON pin and<br> make it our next starting point.</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Santa:</strong><br> As soon as the pin is set, we resurface the Nautilus to<br> regular time and leave the vessel recovering while we<br> deliver presents.</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Santa:</strong><br> And after seven days, the vessel will travel back<br> to 2015, and then the contact with the most intense<br> Saint Graph among us will resume the mission on land.</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Santa:</strong><br> Any questions so far?</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Marine:</strong><br> Oh, I have one!</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Marine:</strong><br> Since we&#39;re warping to 2015, can we stop the<br> bombing?</p><p><strong>F\uFF1ANemo\xA0Professor:</strong><br> That&#39;s the worst alteration you could ma~ke.</p><p><strong>F\uFF1ANemo\xA0Professor:</strong><br> If you prevented the explosion, that would erase the<br> present Chaldea~</p><p><strong>F\uFF1ANemo\xA0Professor:</strong><br> When you jump to the past, you generally can&#39;t<br> change anything that already happened.</p><p><strong>F\uFF1ANemo\xA0Professor:</strong><br> Or more accurately, WE can&#39;t change anything that<br> already happened because we don&#39;t have any parallel<br> world mobility.</p><p><strong>F\uFF1ANemo\xA0Professor:</strong><br> If you managed to infiltrate the 2015 Chaldea base<br> and did something that didn&#39;t happen in the past,<br> Marine...</p><p><strong>F\uFF1ANemo\xA0Professor:</strong><br> It&#39;s you who would be erased. Instantly.</p><p><strong>F\uFF1ANemo\xA0Professor:</strong><br> No altering, not appending. That&#39;s the rules for this<br> mission.</p><p><strong>C\uFF1ANemo\xA0Marine:</strong><br> ...I got it. Can we at least talk to someone?</p><p><strong>C\uFF1ANemo\xA0Marine:</strong><br> Even if I can&#39;t change their fate, at least saying thank<br> you should be...</p><p><strong>F\uFF1ANemo\xA0Professor:</strong><br> ...Not necessarily safe.</p><p><strong>F\uFF1ANemo\xA0Professor:</strong><br> Because an expression of gratitude would be an<br> attitude that the subject can&#39;t understand the reason<br> for, bearing a risk of changing their future actions.</p><p><strong>F\uFF1ANemo\xA0Professor:</strong><br> If you have to talk with someone, the conversation<br> must be something that makes sense and won&#39;t stand<br> out to the people at the Chaldea base of that time.</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Santa:</strong><br> You heard Professor. The infiltration will require<br> utmost attention.</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Santa:</strong><br> The contact will swim solo through the sea of<br> Imaginary Numbers, Zero Sail to Antarctica,<br> and infiltrate the base.</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Santa:</strong><br> Achieve the objective without being spotted by a soul.</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Santa:</strong><br> I&#39;ve obtain the Chaldea shift sheet for the day in<br> question. We also have the route to the objective<br> already mapped out.</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Santa:</strong><br> There&#39;s still a minor risk of coming across a staff<br> member, but the route was chosen based on which of<br> them would reasonably be where.</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Santa:</strong><br> The next step in the roadmap is creating the disguise<br> apparatus to falsify the contact&#39;s appearance.<br> There&#39;s still one last challenge:</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Santa:</strong><br> Convincingly playing the role of the individual the<br> contact will be disguised as. But fortunately,<br> this is a solved problem. Don&#39;t worry about it.</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Santa:</strong><br> That&#39;s the outline of the operation.<br> Any questions?</p><p><strong>O\uFF1ANemo\xA0Santa:</strong><br> \u2014Excellent.<br> The vessel will now commence the special mission.</p><p><strong>O\uFF1ANemo\xA0Santa:</strong><br> Operation: 8 Years Snow Carol.</p><p><strong>O\uFF1ANemo\xA0Santa:</strong><br> I&#39;m counting on every one of you. I swear on Santa<br> Claus&#39; name that we will deliver this package!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Aw, I only came here to give you some advice and you<br> treat me like a nuisance. Am I really so annoying?</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Be that as it may, I can&#39;t look past such a reckless<br> waste of human resources. Chaldea&#39;s going to need you<br> in the future.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Why not call it quits here, Nemo? Santa Claus is a<br> one-day miracle. It&#39;d be ridiculous to stake your life<br> over it.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> There&#39;s nothing to gain if you succeed, and no one to<br> be disappointed if you don&#39;t.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Time travelling to the past is cheating, you know.<br> This is especially unlike you.</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Santa:</strong><br> Your insincere advice is well-recieved, Magus Merlin.</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Santa:</strong><br> I&#39;m honored that you would go out of your way to visit<br> us during an Imaginary Numbers dive.</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Santa:</strong><br> \u2013But what do you mean by that? I heard your<br> words clearly, but I&#39;d like to check just in case.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> The part about \u201Cnothing to gain\u201D, I take it?<br> Yes, it&#39;s sad but true.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> What it is you&#39;ve all been struggling to send [\u2642 him /\u2640\uFE0F her]</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> is a smidgen of good luck at so small a trace that it<br> will fail to tamper with the past.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> A dreamcatcher, a talisman that repels bad luck so as<br> not to meet with sorrow in battles to come.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> The plan is to leave behind a Chaldea uniform with<br> one woven in that nobody will notice.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Your references for approaching the past came from<br> conversations with the fossil-digging lady and the man<br> with Shiva&#39;s authority.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> The seamstress fairy was commissioned to take on<br> the part of perfectly reproducing the uniform.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> The one you sought to teach teleportation theory<br> unfortunately had nothing, but the Old Man of the<br> Mountain, ever the softie, chose to turn you a blind eye.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> However, your efforts will have no meaning even if you<br> go the distance.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> \u201CTravel into the past and swap out the uniform with no<br> one the wiser.\u201D</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> \u201CIf Master wears it never knowing about the imparted<br> gift, no conflicts in reality will occur.\u201D</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Sure. Doing it that way won&#39;t cause a time paradox.<br> But it will also have practically no effect.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> A charm can only be as effective as its owner believes<br> it can be.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> A talisman you don&#39;t even know you bear is hardly<br> more than a little peace of mind.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> The amount of luck you&#39;re adding is, let me see,<br> enough to make a person who has regular nightmares<br> wake up one second sooner.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Put simply, it does nothing. You understand?</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Santa:</strong><br> I&#39;ve known all this from the very start. Verifying it was<br> the first thing I did.</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Santa:</strong><br> \u201CSanta Claus is a one-day miracle. It&#39;d be ridiculous to<br> stake your life over it.\u201D</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Santa:</strong><br> If you truly mean that, we can go right back to fighting.<br> I&#39;ll prove to you that it&#39;s no fool&#39;s errand.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Truly?</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> To go and risk tampering with the past, with a good<br> chance of your erasure, all for the sake of some luck<br> that may not even register as a margin of error?</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> With the risk of it never taking effect, never changing<br> anything, even if you manage? It&#39;s not worth it at all.</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Santa:</strong><br> Sure. Chaldea will get from there to here even if I<br> don&#39;t do this. My actions will contribute nothing to their<br> victories.</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Santa:</strong><br> But that isn&#39;t the point.</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Santa:</strong><br> It&#39;s not a question of someone late in arriving<br> rewarding someone who&#39;s there already.</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Santa:</strong><br> The chance to gain any rewards or joy has passed us<br> by. We never were able to make room for them as<br> comrades.</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Santa:</strong><br> Even then, she wanted to lend them aid. Calling the<br> act itself its own reward with a smile.</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Santa:</strong><br> ...That&#39;s right. Even if the difference is so insignificant<br> that SHEBA can&#39;t observe it,</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Santa:</strong><br> I don&#39;t consider the extra bit meaningless. I admire<br> the courage of people who leap into the storm for<br> something unnecessary.</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Santa:</strong><br> ...as this one summoner has in [\u2642 his /\u2640\uFE0F her] lifetime.</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Santa:</strong><br> So don&#39;t call the act of paying whatever I can to give<br> them a measure of peace a fool&#39;s errand.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> ...Now I get it. My Clairvoyance only views the present.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> I&#39;d always assume the reason why you looked blurry<br> in my eyes was because of the vampire, but it turns out<br> it was something else.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Allow me to rephrase, with apologies.<br> \u201CRidiculously marvelous.\u201D</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Huh. The real fool looks to be wearing my shoes.<br> I should&#39;ve known better than to think the Old Man<br> misjudged.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Excuse me for trying to complicate a smooth journey,<br> Heroic Spirit Nemo. I&#39;ll keep your wish well in mind.</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Santa:</strong><br> Well, thanks. For my part, I&#39;m grateful you came to<br> offer advice.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Oh, right. Pass on my regards to the man if you find<br> him there.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Call him an idiot for me.

The Rayshift<br> experiments are the last thing on my mind.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> I got fed up with magi screwing each other over.<br> That&#39;s why I took this job at so remote a research<br> facility.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> The squabbling over credit is sure to start the moment<br> the Rayshift succeeds, no matter how the Masters fare.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> All that amounts to is a hassle. I want no part in the<br> Clock Tower&#39;s faction nonsense.</p><p><strong>Elron:</strong><br> I suppose. The proprietary technology is mostly<br> Animusphere&#39;s, but a little bit from every Department&#39;s<br> gone into the minutiae.</p><p><strong>Elron:</strong><br> The other Lords must have spies dispatched here.<br> I&#39;d say that&#39;s not your element.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> No, ma&#39;am. And it&#39;s why I&#39;m going straight back to<br> the warehouse. See you, Elron.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> ...You probably shouldn&#39;t leave your post at the gate<br> just because there&#39;s nothing to do. If the Director finds<br> out, she&#39;ll raise hell again.</p><p><strong>Elron:</strong><br> Sure, sure. Thanks for the advice.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Our conversation ended naturally. Meeting her here<br> was within the considered possibilities.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Perfectly as planned. Now to go somewhere no one<br> will see me dive into Imaginary Space\u2014</p><p><strong>Cheery\xA0Voice:</strong><br> Oh, hello. On your way back from the break room too?</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> \u2014</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> A small chill runs down my spine. This was an<br> unforeseen encounter with an unexpected individual.</p><p><strong>Man\xA0in\xA0Lab\xA0Coat:</strong><br> It does lay on a burden, huh? Everyone in Chaldea&#39;s<br> on pins and needles, feeling like the slightest mistake<br> would be fatal.</p><p><strong>Man\xA0in\xA0Lab\xA0Coat:</strong><br> But there&#39;s really no helping that part. This is the day<br> we all came here for.</p><p><strong>Man\xA0in\xA0Lab\xA0Coat:</strong><br> The Director&#39;s speech will start any time now,<br> with all the Masters and staff gathered round.</p><p><strong>Man\xA0in\xA0Lab\xA0Coat:</strong><br> You people probably don&#39;t care much about this in the<br> Neutral Faction, but you should put in an appearance.<br> It&#39;ll make an impression with the Director.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> No, I&#39;m going straight back to the Moonlight<br> Room\u2013slip of the tongue, to the warehouse.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> I don&#39;t like seeing the Director put in that spot.<br> It&#39;s not how she normally acts in general.</p><p><strong>Man\xA0in\xA0Lab\xA0Coat:</strong><br> I couldn&#39;t agree more! You always do know how to put<br> things frankly!</p><p><strong>Man\xA0in\xA0Lab\xA0Coat:</strong><br> She never listens when I say anything. You should put<br> it in writing for the suggestion box.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Is it okay even to say that I don&#39;t like her?</p><p><strong>Man\xA0in\xA0Lab\xA0Coat:</strong><br> I mean say she&#39;s not normally like that.</p><p><strong>Man\xA0in\xA0Lab\xA0Coat:</strong><br> Director Olga Marie herself hates the \u201Cmid-speech<br> Director\u201D more than anyone.</p><p><strong>Man\xA0in\xA0Lab\xA0Coat:</strong><br> If she heard it from a staff member of your status,<br> she might just warm to that side of her.</p><p><strong>Man\xA0in\xA0Lab\xA0Coat:</strong><br> ...By the way, there&#39;s something I couldn&#39;t help but<br> notice. Aren&#39;t you\u2014</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> A-am I what?</p><p><strong>Man\xA0in\xA0Lab\xA0Coat:</strong><br> Aren&#39;t you considerably fatigued? I don&#39;t know,<br> you look as though you&#39;ve circled the world on foot.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> I wouldn&#39;t go that far for a cup of coffee. Go on,<br> check whether I&#39;m showing the miles on my face.</p><p><strong>Man\xA0in\xA0Lab\xA0Coat:</strong><br> If you say so. Must&#39;ve been my imagination...<br> You had that look about you from behind.</p><p><strong>Man\xA0in\xA0Lab\xA0Coat:</strong><br> Sorry. Diagnosing someone on impression alone is no<br> way for a physician to behave...</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> ...That&#39;s nothing to feel bad about. You&#39;re not wrong.<br> I am pretty tired.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> I&#39;m just out on a real important task. Intense work<br> isn&#39;t easy on anyone.</p><p><strong>Man\xA0in\xA0Lab\xA0Coat:</strong><br> Okay. Thanks for putting in all you have.</p><p><strong>Man\xA0in\xA0Lab\xA0Coat:</strong><br> Try not to overdo it again. Now that this is over,<br> take on a lighter task next.</p><p><strong>Man\xA0in\xA0Lab\xA0Coat:</strong><br> Work will always be painful and tiresome, but when<br> it&#39;s unenjoyable, there&#39;s nothing else going for it.</p><p><strong>Man\xA0in\xA0Lab\xA0Coat:</strong><br> After a big task for everyone&#39;s good, I recommend a<br> fun task for your own.</p><p><strong>Man\xA0in\xA0Lab\xA0Coat:</strong><br> If it can be done with close friends, all the better.<br> For you and them alike.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> \u2014Since when friends enter the conversation?</p><p><strong>Man\xA0in\xA0Lab\xA0Coat:</strong><br> Oh... Sorry, just a bad guess on my part. I might have<br> misjudged you as someone who enjoyed being alone.</p><p><strong>Man\xA0in\xA0Lab\xA0Coat:</strong><br> But I can tell from our short chat that you&#39;re a rather<br> responsible individual.</p><p><strong>Man\xA0in\xA0Lab\xA0Coat:</strong><br> I&#39;m sure the people around you think highly of you.<br> They&#39;ll give you a hand when you need it.</p><p><strong>Man\xA0in\xA0Lab\xA0Coat:</strong><br> Cherish the opportunities to share favors and laughs<br> as much as you can.</p><p><strong>Man\xA0in\xA0Lab\xA0Coat:</strong><br> Come by the medical office if you have the time.<br> It&#39;s fine to be in good health, but better safe than<br> sorry.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> I watched the man wave goodbye and walk away.<br> Against my better judgement, I called to him.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Excuse me. Can I ask you a quick question?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> The man lazily turned turned around, waiting for the<br> inquiry.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> There&#39;s this friend of mine, not me, that I heard this<br> thing from...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>Just a hypothetical.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>What if two worlds, equal yet different, were<br> competing for survival?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>The question wasn&#39;t about the worlds themselves,</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>but about an outsider that witnessed the competition<br> and could decide which world got to live.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>Would the outsider be good or evil? I needed to know<br> his opinion.</p><p><strong>Man\xA0in\xA0Lab\xA0Coat:</strong><br> Hmm... Are you talking about some movie? Sorry,<br> it&#39;s too complex for me to have an immediate opinion...</p><p><strong>Man\xA0in\xA0Lab\xA0Coat:</strong><br> Going by the set rules of the battle being inevitable<br> and allowing only one survivor,</p><p><strong>Man\xA0in\xA0Lab\xA0Coat:</strong><br> the question of whether the outsider is good or evil<br> isn&#39;t relevant. Your question needs to be asked in<br> different terms.</p><p><strong>Man\xA0in\xA0Lab\xA0Coat:</strong><br> Every conflict between humans is a clash of values.<br> You should be asking, \u201CWas the outsider right or wrong?</p><p><strong>Man\xA0in\xA0Lab\xA0Coat:</strong><br> Pretty much everyone thinks they&#39;re right. You could<br> even say people can only do what they believe to be<br> right.</p><p><strong>Man\xA0in\xA0Lab\xA0Coat:</strong><br> Therefore, no matter how just the opposition&#39;s cause<br> may be, if they&#39;re choosing to be antagonistic,<br> they are fundamentally wrong.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> ...Everyone is invariably wrong.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> That goes both for them, your enemy; and for you,<br> their enemy.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> In a battle for survival, the most good-natured person<br> in the world still wouldn&#39;t be objectively right...</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Is that what you mean?</p><p><strong>Man\xA0in\xA0Lab\xA0Coat:</strong><br> Yeah. And you just gotta accept that.</p><p><strong>Man\xA0in\xA0Lab\xA0Coat:</strong><br> The worst thing you can do is believe your side has<br> the one correct answer.</p><p><strong>Man\xA0in\xA0Lab\xA0Coat:</strong><br> The winner is not the one who is right. They&#39;re simply<br> the ones who earn the right to see what comes next.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> So you think everyone is wrong when multiple peoples<br> fight for survival. Then who is right? Are you saying<br> being right is realistically impossible?</p><p><strong>Man\xA0in\xA0Lab\xA0Coat:</strong><br> Your heart is right, in this moment where you&#39;re<br> asking these questions.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> The man in a lab coat said that to be right is to<br> meditate on the fact that you survived.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Looking at it from another angle, he wished for us to<br> be like that.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> It was a conventional answer. A conventional form of<br> care. But his words were filled with the utmost<br> conviction.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> As if he was a sage living in the summit of a mountain.<br> The one who watched many wars and conflicts.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> \u2014It wasn&#39;t about me, okay? I was asking for a<br> friend.</p><p><strong>Man\xA0in\xA0Lab\xA0Coat:</strong><br> Oops, I forgot that part! Never mind me!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>Why is he acting like he goofed up? He totally believes<br> the question was about me.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>...I can see how carrying out an year-long operation<br> with this guy would give you an imperturbable peace of<br> mind...</p><p><strong>Man\xA0in\xA0Lab\xA0Coat:</strong><br> Well, gotta go now. I&#39;m the one in charge of the<br> medical sector, somehow.</p><p><strong>Man\xA0in\xA0Lab\xA0Coat:</strong><br> The Director will probably me kick me out<br> immediately, but I&#39;m going to say hi at the Control<br> Room.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> \u2014Wait, please. I&#39;ve got a, uh, weird request.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Do you have a spare of something you&#39;re always<br> carrying around? A pen, or something easily<br> replaceable like that?</p><p><strong>Man\xA0in\xA0Lab\xA0Coat:</strong><br> Yeah, I walk with a few on hand. I never know when<br> I&#39;ll be called to the field. Are these what you want?</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> One more pair, if it&#39;s not too much. I could use some<br> too in my warehouse work.</p><p><strong>Man\xA0in\xA0Lab\xA0Coat:</strong><br> Of course, ask whenever you like! It&#39;s always great to<br> see my professionalism appreciated!</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> That was not about my opinion on your professionalis-<br> m at all... With all due respect, you&#39;re an idiot.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> But I&#39;ll try to adopt your stupid way to see everything<br> in a positive light.</p><p><strong>Man\xA0in\xA0Lab\xA0Coat:</strong><br> Will you? Thanks. I was trying to cheer you up,<br> and yet I&#39;m the one hit with the best words of<br> encouragement.</p><p><strong>Man\xA0in\xA0Lab\xA0Coat:</strong><br> Goodbye for real now.<br> Have a nice day, Meuni\xE8re.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> \u2014The lab coat fades into the distance.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> My salute to this man I never truly met, will never meet,<br> and don&#39;t even know the name of.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Nothing afterward changed.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> He headed towards his own \u201Cmoment of truth\u201D,<br> much like I did to reach here.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><ul><li>4:00 PM -</li><li>Fujimaru&#39;s Room, Day 7 -</li></ul><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> After what happened the other day, today we came<br> back an hour earlier than usual.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> This way, we have plenty of time left to wait for the<br> Nemos to return...</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Santa:</strong><br> Oh, you&#39;re early today. I didn&#39;t think you&#39;d be back<br> yet.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Uhh, back yet from what?</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Santa:</strong><br> Nothing else needs to be said, is there? Pardon me<br> for inquiring.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Good work out there, Nemo Santa.</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Santa:</strong><br> ...Good to be back. Though my work isn&#39;t over quite<br> yet.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> G-good work out there, Nemo Santa. You returned<br> two hours ahead of your usual time.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Did something unusual happen?</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Santa:</strong><br> I suppose so. I can&#39;t elaborate, for various reasons.</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Santa:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Santa:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Nemo?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Santa?</p><hr><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Santa:</strong><br> No, this is no time to act embarrassed. I&#39;m going to<br> say it out loud, like a leader ought to!</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Santa:</strong><br> The truth is, I couldn&#39;t deliver a single gift all day<br> today. Something I consider a very un-Santa gaffe.</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Santa:</strong><br> ...Though that&#39;s a small issue altogether. I know this<br> subject is coming up a bit too late, but...</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Santa:</strong><br> I&#39;d been dismissing you two when you were Santa<br> Clauses of a different kind, Fujimaru, Mash.</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Santa:</strong><br> I&#39;d like to right that wrong...um, if there is still time to<br> do so.</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Santa:</strong><br> There are still presents left over, you see. Would you<br> like to come along for the deliveries?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Certainly!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> We&#39;ve had more than enough downtime!</p><hr><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Santa:</strong><br> Glad to hear it, you two. There isn&#39;t much time,<br> so let&#39;s get right back to delivering.</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Santa:</strong><br> It&#39;s going to occupy us past midnight. Be sure to dress<br> for the cold and pack a late-night snack.</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Santa:</strong><br> I&#39;m prepared, naturally. I&#39;m in need of some enjoyable<br> work, you see?</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Santa:</strong><br> As soon as the last gift is away, I&#39;ve got a small<br> present to give to both of you.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> A present for us? That should be fun. What sort of gift<br> will it be?</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Santa:</strong><br> The fun is in the waiting. The memories of a one-time<br> holy night like this can be a gift in themselves.</p><p><strong>Nemo\xA0Santa:</strong><br> Just a little something I found while playing<br> warehouseman, and that both of you should be able to<br> appreciate more now.</p><p></p>', 1080);
