Speaking of which, I haven&#39;t introduced myself.<br> I am Lord El-Melloi II.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong><br> I am a mere human, who became the Spirit Origin of a famous strategist from the Three Kingdom Period in China.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Lord?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong><br> What, don&#39;t you know?<br> What kind of manuals did Animusphere make...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> The Second?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong><br> Right. I was originally a third-rate noble from the countryside. For certain reasons, I took after my mentor and inherited his name.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Excuse me, Lord El-Melloi II. When you say Lord,<br> do you mean the &quot;Lord&quot; of the Mage&#39;s Association?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong><br> Yes. I represent one of the twelve noble families that operate the Clock Tower, the center of the Mage&#39;s Association. The lowest-ranked, though.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Did you know Director Olga Marie?<br> What time period are you from, anyway?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong><br> Same as Fujimaru, I&#39;m from the 21st century. Before I knew it, I became a Pseudo-Servant.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> A Pseudo-Servant...like me. Are you someone that was empowered by Heroic Spirits?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong><br> ...The result was the same but the idea&#39;s different.<br> There&#39;s nobody identical to you in this time.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong><br> Originally, it&#39;s impossible to form a Demi-Servant.<br> Just the same as it&#39;s impossible for Dhampir to be born among vampires.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> As I&#39;d expect of a Clock Tower mage, you probably understand the logic behind the impossible.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> That&#39;s right. Mash is an extremely unique example of success. It&#39;d be hard to recreate an accident.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong><br> I&#39;m glad to hear that. I would&#39;ve suggested an immediate dismantling of Chaldea if it was such a screwed-up organization.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou, Fooou!</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong><br> ...Sorry, that was insensitive of me. You aren&#39;t guilty of anything, ma&#39;am. I would like to correct myself.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> W-Well, you cannot deny that creating Demi-Servants was an inhumane experiment.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Your feeling of disgust is justified, Lord El-Melloi.<br> Even more so if it comes from justice and morals.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That aside, please continue your explanation.<br> What are Pseudo-Servants?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong><br> Ah, yes.<br> I shall answer that question.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong><br> A Pseudo-Servant is someone possessed by a Heroic Spirit. Those Heroic Spirits who can&#39;t become a Servant...</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong><br> Perhaps they are higher beings like Divine Spirits, or their Spirit Origins can&#39;t be created by Chaldea.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong><br> In order to summon them as Servants, human vessels are sometimes used.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong><br> That is what a Pseudo-Servant is. Using a human body as catalyst to forcefully summon a Heroic Spirit.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ??</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> ?????</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Oh-uh, Fujimaru looks confused.<br> Obviously since it&#39;s a particularly unique case, right?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> In short, it&#39;s someone being possessed by a ghost.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Then the psyche of the possessed is overwritten by the Heroic Spirit...</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong><br> I&#39;m the opposite. I took only the role of Zhuge Liang,<br> because western logic doesn&#39;t match eastern logic.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong><br> But with the greater good of protecting humanity in mind, we share a common goal.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong><br> That&#39;s why after a discussion with the Strategist on who should control the body, I ended up staying because of my knowledge of modern eras.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I see. That&#39;s very much Zhuge Liang.<br> Just like what he did at the end of his life.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> The important thing was for someone to execute his strategies, without participating on it...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> In other words, he found the one capable of his strategies, so he decided not to appear.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong><br> That&#39;s right. We&#39;ve only talked for a bit, but it&#39;s obvious he&#39;s more of a monster than history described. I didn&#39;t feel like I was talking to a human.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...Can you fight?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> ...You&#39;re just a human?</p><hr><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou, Fooou.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong><br> I would&#39;ve been incinerated if I was just a human.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong><br> By becoming one with the Heroic Spirits, I temporarily became a Servant.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong><br> Follow me.<br> I will show you proof.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong><br> Around here is fine.<br> Enemy approaching. Prepare for battle.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong><br> You will immediately see if I can fight as a Servant.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong><br> In turn, I will assess your potential as a Master.<br> Kill two birds with one stone, right?</p><p><strong>Monster:</strong><br> Gaooooooooooooo\u2014!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> They&#39;re already pumped up!<br> What did you do, Lord El-Melloi?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong><br> Well, this will be interesting.<br> I used some pheromones to excite them.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong><br> Be careful when you fight, ma&#39;am. The enemy is on a rampage. Don&#39;t let your guard down.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Master!<br> I think he&#39;s gone too far with his logic!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> The enemy response is still spreading!<br> It&#39;s massive. Just how excited are they!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> This is no time to be in awe, Doctor!<br> Do something!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Sorry, there&#39;s nothing I can do beside scanning the area... You just have handle it by yourselves.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Got it!<br> It means I can only rely on Senpai, right!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Sorry Doc. Let&#39;s do this, Mash!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Same as usual. Let&#39;s do this, Mash!</p><hr><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong><br> I see. Aren&#39;t you a courageous one?<br> No plans, but you sure got guts.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong><br> Humph\u2014Not bad at all.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong><br> You remind me of myself in the past.<br> If that&#39;s the case, &quot;I&quot; shall show my true strength.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong><br> Of course, this is merely on the path of me reaching him.<br> But it seems this will be a fruitful contract.</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The battle is over...<br> You know...I&#39;m three times more...tired than usual...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Good job, Mash.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> ...It was a disaster, huh?</p><hr><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Foou!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I&#39;m relieved that you and Fou...both made it...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Those wild beasts had their eyes on the two of you, I was doing everything I can...</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou!?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong><br> You&#39;re done?<br> So how did I do, Fujimaru? Did I pass?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You&#39;ve convinced me.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong><br> That&#39;s good.<br> I&#39;m finished assessing you too.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> That&#39;s not fair, you can fight as a human.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong><br> Not fair? Oh I see, you mean comparing to you? So you&#39;re jealous that I can fight on the front line despite being a human.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong><br> Cherish what you&#39;re feeling now. Because it requires strength to withstand that feeling of powerlessness.</p><hr><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong><br> As you can see, I can fight as a Servant.<br> You might be unsatisfied with my firepower, but I will make up with my intellect.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Oh. He&#39;s definitely a first-rate Servant. I mean all Pseudo-Servants are exceptional cases to begin with.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Fujimaru, eventually you&#39;ll be able to meet a Pseudo-Servant who fused with a god, I think.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong><br> Probably...Well, I am a special case.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong><br> Most vessels chosen to become Pseudo-Servants...<br> in other words, mages, already possess powers.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong><br> And when Heroic Spirits possess humans, they will choose those who closely resemble themselves. So of course they are powerful.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong><br> Those integrated will then transmigrate into a third personality, a new personality if you will.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong><br> Those kinds of Servants are troublesome.<br> After all, they tend to think like Divine Spirits.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong><br> They will probably be completely selfish and ask for all kinds of impossible things.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong><br> Then you&#39;ll know that I&#39;m one of the better ones.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Hahaha...Well, let&#39;s save that for the future.<br> Good job, Mash, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Come home with Mr. El-Melloi II.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I couldn&#39;t fight with you, but I can welcome you home with a warm cup of tea.</p><h2 id="endless-sea" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#endless-sea" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Endless Sea</h2><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> (Senpai, Mr. El-Melloi seems off.<br> I know he looks irritable all the time, but now...)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Is he looking at the sea?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> He&#39;s looking at the sunset?</p><hr><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou, fou.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong><br> ...So.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong><br> Ma&#39;am. If you&#39;re going to hide, at least put down your shield. Anyone will notice a black steel wall on the beach.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong><br> You too Fujimaru.<br> As her Master you should&#39;ve pointed that out.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> S-Sorry.<br> It seemed like you wanted to be left alone...</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Nnnng...kyau, kyaaaau!</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong><br> Nothing, I was just looking at the sea.<br> I heard it was named Okeanos due to the Grail.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong><br> But it&#39;s just a name. It&#39;s a horizon as far as you can see, but the edges simply adhere to each other.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong><br> Just like a scroll. A sea enclosed in all directions that perpetually revolves around the same area.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong><br> You can sail it endlessly, but in truth,<br> it&#39;s just a clipped miniature garden. How absurd.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong><br> This is not the place I set out to reach.<br> Not even close to the real Okeanos.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> You wanted to reach Okeanos?<br> Are those the words of Zhuge Liang?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong><br> ...Hmph, those are my words. Watch your mouth.<br> It appears I got too sentimental.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong><br> It was a dream. One that I had when I was younger.<br> All the experience I&#39;ve gained was to further that goal.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong><br> I didn&#39;t become what I am now naturally.<br> I was an average mage.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong><br> Taking on that troublesome teaching position, inheriting the name of El-Melloi, refining my third-rate magical circuit, it&#39;s all because\u2014</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong><br> I wanted to become the ideal I yearned for when I was young. Now, I&#39;m just a crooked old mage.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> A crooked mage...you?<br> Even though you are a first-class mage?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong><br> Only my position is first-class. My ability as a mage isn&#39;t much different from Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong><br> I somehow managed to keep up with those first-class monsters with my knowledge and preparations.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong><br> Dr. Roman can see through that too. Whatever you say about that guy, he&#39;s a natural at talent assessment.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...You didn&#39;t reach your ideal?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong><br> Stop with your nonsense. I did reach it.<br> That&#39;s why I&#39;m like this, right?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong><br> I reached my ideal, just not the natural way.<br> It&#39;s a bit harder every day, and it&#39;s killing my stomach.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong><br> You need to remember, Fujimaru. With strong convictions and desires, you can reach your ideal.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong><br> It&#39;s a rough path for an ordinary person. You&#39;ll reach your ideal but lose your way of life in the process.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> ...You couldn&#39;t reach Okeanos?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong><br> Well, I haven&#39;t started the journey yet.<br> I&#39;m just not ready to reach the endless sea.</p><hr><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou, Foou!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> What&#39;s in the forest, Fou?<br> Master, Lord, enemy sighted!</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong><br> Geez.<br> No time for fond memories huh?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong><br> \u2014It&#39;s about to begin, Master.<br> Let&#39;s see how much you&#39;ve grown.</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong><br> Didn&#39;t even break a sweat. You don&#39;t consider them enemies anymore, huh?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong><br> ...Hmm, growth as a mage is unlikely, but it looks like you&#39;re gaining experience as a Master.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong><br> It&#39;s good to be diligent. All right,<br> I will give you this as a reward for your efforts.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Is this...a jewel?<br> It appears to be an expensive Mystic Code...</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong><br> It&#39;s not. It&#39;s just a common protective ore.<br> On top of that, it&#39;s a used one from me.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong><br> I pocketed it as a precaution when I was young, but I don&#39;t need it anymore.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong><br> No one will acknowledge your effort anyway, right?<br> That&#39;s why I&#39;m giving it to you as a reward.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou, Foou!</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong><br> Hey, calm down there!<br> My student showed progress, it&#39;s natural!</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong><br> Look what you did! Now my expensive suit is ruined!<br> Not to mention that my hair is sticky from the sea breeze.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong><br> I shouldn&#39;t have come to the beach.<br> Who&#39;s dumb enough to want to come here?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Mr. El-Melloi just left...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> He must see his younger self when he looks at you, Senpai.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> In that case, I&#39;m honored...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> ...I&#39;m not that eccentric...</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes, here you go Senpai.<br> A gift from your teacher.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> He said that it was used, but I&#39;m positive that he prepared it just for you.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Let&#39;s fight and not give up!

I guess we&#39;re left with no choice (grin).<br> Let&#39;s do this...</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong><br> Cooooome, Meduuuuusaaaaaa!</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> My big sisters... Please stop summoning me like that.<br> I&#39;m not some giant robot, you know...</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong><br> Silence! Don&#39;t talk back to your sisters!<br> Anyway, that thing over there! That one!</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong><br> That cheeky guy over there!<br> He dared to raise his hand against us!</p><p><strong>Stheno:</strong><br> That&#39;s right. Despite our hospitality to welcome him as a guest, he charged at us without saying a word!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...I see.<br> Technically she&#39;s not lying.</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> ...Hmm.<br> Is that true, sir?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II(Young):</strong><br> Whoa. Isn&#39;t that Servant a bit too scary?<br> No, you&#39;re getting it wrong!</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II(Young):</strong><br> We came to talk! We only resorted to force because we weren&#39;t making progress!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Unfortunately, he&#39;s not lying either.</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> \u2014All right, get ready. As punishment, I&#39;m turning you to stone for one hundred years.</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> You&#39;ll be small for a statue... At least I can use you as a paperweight.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II(Young):</strong><br> Hahaha, I see that Riders sure are professional at pressing all my buttons!</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II(Young):</strong><br> Now Fujimaru, I mean my Master!<br> Punish that giant for me!</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Enemy Rider defeated.<br> ...But, is this really a good reason to fight?</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> Damn...</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong><br> Hey, that was sloppy Medusa.</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong><br> You didn&#39;t go easy on him because he looks like a good kid, did you?</p><p><strong>Stheno:</strong><br> That&#39;s not it, &quot;me.&quot;</p><p><strong>Stheno:</strong><br> Medusa isn&#39;t getting heavier and slower,<br> Fujimaru is getting stronger.</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> (...Not heavy...I&#39;m not heavy, big sister...(tears))</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II(Young):</strong><br> Your secret weapon Medusa is no match for us by herself. This time, why don&#39;t you just\u2014</p><p><strong>Stheno:</strong><br> What&#39;re you talking about? The real battle begins now.<br> Both Golems and Medusa couldn&#39;t finish the job...</p><p><strong>Stheno:</strong><br> In that case, we&#39;ll have to get serious. I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll be forgiven for revealing that forbidden name.</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> Huh? No way, big sister.<br> You wouldn&#39;t!</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong><br> I seeeee. You&#39;re right!<br> If it&#39;s come to this we have no choice but to use that!</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong><br> Hmmmm. Get ready, you Monchhichi! Demon God of the Shapeless Isle, distinguished in Greek mythology\u2014</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong><br> The Demon God who flattened 100 brave men, the True Body of the Trinity Goddesses Gorgon.<br> We release you here and now!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong><br> \u2014Actually, there&#39;s no such thing as the True Body of Gorgon. Even if there was it wouldn&#39;t be introduced here.</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> (...Twice...Twice was I defeated for unknown reasons... Just how unfortunate can I be...)</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II(Young):</strong><br> Haha... You scared me for a moment.<br> Turns out it was just you three attacking together.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II(Young):</strong><br> You&#39;re really out of ammunition now, right?<br> Just give up already and release me from this curse!</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> A curse... What is that?<br> Surely, my sisters didn&#39;t cause you any trouble...</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II(Young):</strong><br> Don&#39;t worry about it, I know you&#39;re always the victim.<br> Sorry about the rough treatment. Why don&#39;t you rest?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II(Young):</strong><br> You two, Stheno and Euryale!<br> Get rid of this rejuvenation curse on me!</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong><br> Rejuvenation? What&#39;s that?<br> That little runt there is\u2014</p><p><strong>Stheno:</strong><br> Hehe. So &quot;I&quot; didn&#39;t realize after all.<br> That&#39;s Lord El-Melloi II himself.</p><p><strong>Stheno:</strong><br> For some reason, he&#39;s returned to his younger self.</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong><br> No way! That handsome man used to look like that?<br> How much pain do you have to endure to grow into that?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II(Young):</strong><br> That&#39;s my business. Leave me alone!<br> Wait, hold on. You didn&#39;t know?</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong><br> Nope, I didn&#39;t know.<br> If I did, I would&#39;ve teased you much more.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II(Young):</strong><br> That means...<br> No way...</p><p><strong>Stheno:</strong><br> Yes, as you might expect, My Lord\u2661<br> We have nothing to do with it.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II(Young):</strong><br> What\u2014</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> What\u2014</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> What did you say?!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Well, that&#39;s what I thought!</p><hr><p><strong>El-Melloi II(Young):</strong><br> So, so, so, so what&#39;s the cause, then?<br> I can&#39;t think of any other external factors!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Well, then the answer is clear, isn&#39;t it? If there are no external factors, it just means your growth led to that body.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It is a logical conclusion.<br> Your body got younger because of your Ascension.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II(Young):</strong><br> That&#39;s... That&#39;s ridiculous...<br> Then it&#39;s pointless, isn&#39;t it?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II(Young):</strong><br> Ascension is a reform to make one stronger!<br> Why would I revert to a form when I was immature?</p><p><strong>Stheno:</strong><br> For you, there are things you can only do in that form...</p><p><strong>Stheno:</strong><br> Rather, you can say that form is the &quot;origin of all your concepts.&quot;</p><p><strong>Stheno:</strong><br> See, your ability as a Servant hasn&#39;t degraded one bit, right?</p><p><strong>Stheno:</strong><br> When you fight as a &quot;main character,&quot; that form is the most powerful... Or most fitting.</p><p><strong>Stheno:</strong><br> You didn&#39;t even realize it...<br> How adorable can you get?</p><p><strong>Stheno:</strong><br> I ended up playing with you for a bit.<br> I received the best present to relieve my boredom\u2661</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II(Young):</strong><br> Ugh...Ughhh...Ughhhhhhhhh...<br> Again...Again, played by you!</p><p><strong>Stheno:</strong><br> But, it doesn&#39;t feel right to just keep taking from you...</p><p><strong>Stheno:</strong><br> If you play some more, I may be able to give you information about an elixir to turn you back, Lord El-Melloi.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Oh... Let&#39;s go, Senpai.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Lord El-Melloi is going into a battle that he&#39;ll never win.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...Those who challenge Stheno will only end up being played by her and then disposed of...I shall be careful.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Let&#39;s go back to Chaldea.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Good luck, Lord El-Melloi.</p><hr><p><strong>El-Melloi II(Young):</strong><br> Oh. Let&#39;s go home then, damn it! Just you watch.<br> I&#39;ll be back to my original form in no time!</p>', 349);
