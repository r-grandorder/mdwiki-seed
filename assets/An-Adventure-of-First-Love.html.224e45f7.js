It was the first March since Soujuurou had come down to the city. Lured out for a stroll by the blue skies, he found himself at a caf\xE9 that he remembered well. It was a caf\xE9 that rented out space on the building\u2019s first floor. Once when Soujuurou still wasn\u2019t used to the town, he took shelter here when it suddenly began to rain. What a fateful encounter\u2026 wasn\u2019t something that went through Soujuurou\u2019s head, but he went in since it was just the right time for a meal.</p><p>The carpets were red, with white walls and white cabinets. He didn\u2019t know it when he first came here, but the interior was decorated in a French style. Feeling uneasy at the subtle differences from the Kuonji Mansion, Soujuurou sat at the same seat as last time.</p><p>\u201CHuh! Soujuurou-kun?\u201D Right as Soujuurou sat down, a voice called out from behind the counter. That voice belonged to the one of the beautiful female siblings from the church, the wild, always friendly, Suse Ritsuka. \u201CWow, I didn\u2019t expect to see you here! So, have you got another shift today? Or are you volunteering? Or just working for free? Well, it doesn\u2019t matter which, come on, open up the menu! I\u2019m really happy to see you, so pick something out! It\u2019s my treat!\u201D Ritsuka was wearing an apron with the name of the caf\xE9 printed on it, and had a massive smile on her face.</p><p>And thus, he acquired a favourite caf\xE9, as is normal for a student. It wasn\u2019t that he had caught the sickness that is unique to puberty, \u2018I want to do things that adults do\u2019, but that when Ritsuka was working, there was a high probability he would receive something extra. Or to put it another way, he was lured in by free drinks.</p><p>\u25C6</p><p>The caf\xE9 was called Janus. For Soujuurou, it was a name that was both difficult to remember and difficult to pronounce, but it was probably a name the owner was attached to. While thinking he would ask about it if he ever got the chance, he arrived at the caf\xE9 as he had done many times before. Soujuurou sat down at his usual seat, and decided to focus on studying math for the half hour until his shift started. Then.</p><p>\u201COh, you\u2019re from the fish shop, right?\u201D A man who was reading called out from the table diagonally opposite Soujuurou. He was in his early 20\u2019s. With his calm features, he gave the impression of a modern youth enjoying the campus life. While his short cropped hair seemed rather rough, it looked like a work of art no matter the angle. He was slender, and a head taller than Soujuurou. His casually chosen college jacket and slim jeans couldn\u2019t have suited him better. He was a perfect example that someone with the looks of a model will look good no matter what they wear.</p><p>\u201CHello, um\u2026 who were you again?\u201D Soujuurou asked.</p><p>\u201CNo way. You just gave me a freebie at Uotatsu yesterday, didn\u2019t you?\u201D</p><p>\u201COh, you\u2019re the one who always comes to buy weather loach and eels. Huh. Did you ever tell me your name?\u201D</p><p>\u201CI see. I guess I never introduced myself. I\u2019m\u2014 yes, my name\u2019s Ichigozuka. It\u2019s a pleasure.\u201D With a friendly smile, Ichigozuka sat down opposite Soujuurou. Soujuurou wasn\u2019t wary of people unless they gave him reason to be, so much so that even the unsociable Kuonji Alice accepted his presence. Thus Soujuurou responded with an innocent smile.</p><p>\u201CSo you\u2019re studying today? It\u2019s quite dazzling to see a student at work.\u201D</p><p>\u201CYou\u2019re always dazzling as well, Ichigozuka-san.\u201D Particularly your teeth. Thinking that, Soujuurou stabbed his fork into the shortcake that came with his coffee set.</p><p>In the end, the spare time before Soujuurou\u2019s shift was completely taken up talking to the young man named Ichigozuka. When it came to talking about what food was in season, Soujuurou couldn\u2019t stop himself.</p><p>\u201CWhoops, it\u2019s this late already. Sorry for taking up your time. In exchange for your valuable time, I\u2019ll pay for yours too.\u201D Ichigozuka took both their bills and left the caf\xE9.</p><p>Straight after that, the ringing of a cowbell echoed through the shop. While putting his textbooks back in his bag Soujuurou\u2019s eyes drifted over to the door, drawn by the sound of the bell. \u201C\u2014What?\u201D Just what kind of fate was this? Standing at the caf\xE9&#39;s entrance was a gloomy figure that left even Soujuurou speechless. He had a very angular form, almost like a stupa tomb. He was almost 190cm tall. His clothes were entirely white. He wore a guard on his head, almost like a helmet. The cloak wrapped around his body looked like the wings of a white swan in the middle of a blizzard.</p><p>\u201CExcuse me. I\u2019m looking for a second year from Misaki Highschool, Shizuki Soujuurou. Is he here?\u201D The pure white devil asked the waitress with a cold, strained voice. Frightened, the waitress nodded, as her gaze showed him Soujuurou\u2019s seat. The man thanked the waitress, made an order for something, then walked directly towards Soujuurou\u2019s seat.</p><p>\u201CMy name is Mino Yoshitsune. I was your senpai until a few days ago. I\u2019m not someone to be suspicious of.\u201D While his actions and clothing were certainly suspicious, his greeting revealed his honest nature. \u201CNow, as a result of our leaders&#39; guidance and encouragement, I was safely carried to graduation at Misaki High School. While there I belonged to the cheer squad. Although I never crossed paths with you.\u201D</p><p>It had been three months since Soujuurou had transferred to the school. The words \u2018cheer squad\u2019 did ring a bell. There were many stories about the captain of the cheer squad, that great, frightening man. He had heard that even that student council president would act amenable when he was around\u2026 maybe.</p><p>\u201CI\u2019ve got something to talk to you about. Would now be an opportune moment?\u201D</p><p>Bewildered by the old fashioned saying, Soujuurou replied with a \u2018yes\u2019. After the man gave a word of thanks, for some reason he sat down next to Soujuurou, rather than opposite him.</p><p>\u201CHm? The seat over there is free, you know?\u201D Soujuurou told him.</p><p>\u201CIt seems so. But this way there\u2019ll be less trouble in the future.\u201D</p><p>Shortly after, the waitress brought two cream parfaits. Two men were sitting next to each other on the caf\xE9 sofa. The waitress couldn\u2019t keep her face from twitching at that unusual sight.</p><p>As for Soujuurou, he thought \u2018I see. It\u2019s a lot more difficult to get up and run away sitting like this.\u2019 He was quite impressed.</p><p>\u201CIt\u2019s my treat. Eat up. I went for the most expensive thing on the menu.\u201D</p><p>\u201COkay. I\u2019ll go ahead then.\u201D Honestly, Soujuurou had already had his fill of sweet food during his conversation with Ichigozuka, but it would be a bit awkward to refuse when Mino was sitting so close. Soujuurou began tasting the fresh cream, nibbling on it.</p><p>Without touching his parfait, Mino Yoshitsune cleared his throat with a loud cough. \u201CThis may be a bit of a sudden question. In regards to the schoolmates you live together with, are you an animal who is conscious of them as members of the opposite sex?\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2014Sorry?\u201D While Soujuurou was treated as a guard dog by his housemates, would someone really suspect him of being a beast on their first meeting? But perhaps not hesitating to take food given to him was a bit like a dog, he couldn\u2019t help but think. \u201CWell, putting that aside. Um. Being conscious of members of the opposite sex as a being of the opposite sex would be natural for a human, wouldn\u2019t it?\u201D Soujuurou fixed his gaze on Mino, emphasizing that it shouldn\u2019t be any reason to call him an animal.</p><p>\u201CI see. So that\u2019s how it is. You\u2019re amazing.\u201D So it\u2019s true, thought Captain Mino, sure that he had understood the situation. The handsome man with a white cloak cleared his throat. \u201CI\u2019ll put it another way. What I want to ask is, are you and Aozaki Aoko lovers?\u201D</p><p>Upon hearing such an unexpected question, Soujuurou choked on the cream. He then gulped down some water to clear his throat. \u201CSorry, allow me to take back what I said before. Because I\u2019m human, there are times when I\u2019m not conscious of someone as a member of the opposite sex.\u201D</p><p>\u201CI see. That\u2019s a relief. Things were about to get troublesome.\u201D With a solemn nod, Captain Mino looked Soujuurou directly in the eyes and finally got to the main topic. \u201CShizuki. I\u2019m going to ask Aozaki Aoko to go out with me. Would you be able to assist me? According to the captain of the swim club, it would go much better with your help.\u201D</p><p>There was a loud choking noise, and the seat opposite them was filled the water Soujuurou spat out.</p><p>\u25C6</p><p>According to the students of Misaki High School, Mino Yoshitsune was an impeccable man. He was a head taller than the average high school boy, but without the roughness of a giant. That straight back even gave him an intellectual look. He had pale red lips, and a chiseled face. His gaze was calm, yet seemed distant. Perhaps due to his symmetrical build, his voice had a sharp tone. Indeed, he was a man born to be the captain of the cheer squad, a traditionally handsome young man. The black clothing under a white cloak was, needless to say, the uniform of the cheer squad. Since the start of March he was no longer attending school at Misaki High School, but since he still had responsibilities with the cheer squad he was wearing this around... so he said. The school cap he wore was proof that he was the captain, and the white cloak seemed to be something to focus himself. As an example, if Soujuurou was a country boy who was behind the times, Mino Yoshitsune appeared to be an anachronistic leader from an entirely different time.</p><p>\u201CSomeone like you wants to ask out, of all people, Aozaki?\u201D</p><p>\u201CThat reaction hurts a bit, but yes. Someone like me, of all people, has had feelings for that sweet Aozaki for close to two years.\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u201D</p><p>The two saw things as differently as an ant and an elephant.</p><p>\u201CWhen you say two years, would that mean from when Aozaki was a first year?\u201D</p><p>\u201CThat\u2019s right. I first met Aozaki just after I had taken over as captain. Have you heard what happened with the boys who asked Aozaki out?\u201D</p><p>Only the end result, replied Soujuurou. Tsukiji Tobimaru, the student council vice president, had told him about the \u2018Who Will Confess to the First Year Beauty? Tournament\u2019. In the end, there was carnage. The few boys who remained confessed to Aozaki Aoko, and met an honorable defeat.</p><p>\u201COh. Then were you one of them, Mino-senpai?\u201D</p><p>\u201C...No. I was too late for that. Before I knew it, the previous student council president was absent, and both Aozaki and I were busy with our work. It wasn\u2019t the time to talk about love. As the two of us were busy with our studies, two years passed. It\u2019s because of my cowardice, and it is my biggest regret.\u201D</p><p>Mino Yoshitsune cast his eyes down in anguish. His shadowed expression was incredibly picturesque. Soujuurou noticed the waitress watching from a distance. Her face twitched once again. \u2026...She wasn\u2019t afraid, but holding herself back, since she was so captivated that she was on the verge of collapse.</p><p>\u201CI understand what\u2019s going on now. But why didn\u2019t you say anything for two years?\u201D</p><p>\u201CIt is due to my weakness of character. I\u2019ve cheered on teams without a chance of victory many times, but when it comes to myself I always hesitate. If it were possible, I would like us to keep our relationship as schoolmates forever, but\u2026\u201D</p><p>\u201CBut you\u2019re going to confess now, aren\u2019t you?\u201D</p><p>\u201CIt\u2019s a painful choice, but it can\u2019t be avoided. I\u2019ll be leaving this town after I graduate. I can\u2019t put it off any longer.\u201D</p><p>Soujuurou had gotten the gist of things. It was unclear whether for work or further study, but after graduation, Mino Yoshitsune was probably leaving for the city. There were only a few more days where he would have the chance to confess to Aozaki Aoko. However, Soujuurou was at a bit of a loss. Even if he was asked to help, what should he actually do? In the first place, in matters of love, Soujuurou was the one who really needed the help.</p><p>\u201CSenpai. Have you thought that leaving your memories as memories might be for the best? I don\u2019t know about other girls, but in Aozaki\u2019s case, there\u2019s a high probability of that being true.\u201D Soujuurou made a gesture indicating beautiful memories being smashed into dust. At that point Mino nodded, as if that proposition had reached deep inside him.</p><p>\u201CI am prepared to accept being rejected. If I don\u2019t try my luck here, could I really say I\u2019ve graduated? If I can manage to confess my feelings, I wouldn\u2019t care, even if I turned to ash.\u201D</p><p>\u201C......\u201D If that\u2019s the case, you should just go do it, Soujuurou said silently. He could be quite heartless when it came to these things.</p><p>\u201CI understand what you\u2019re getting at. I\u2019m not shrewd enough to go after her weaknesses. However Aozaki seems to have a strong view on dating. If I just go up and ask her, I\u2019ll just be shot down. It\u2019s not as simple as just catching her with a rope.\u201D</p><p>\u201CNo, I don\u2019t think a rope\u2019s going to cut it. You\u2019d need steel wire at a minimum. I\u2019d also recommend a stun gun.\u201D</p><p>\u201CCould you leave the clever jokes for later? Shizuki. Until you transferred in, Aozaki would never associate with any of the male students for long. Do you understand what that means? My thoughts are that you\u2019re someone who she cares for deeply, or she doesn\u2019t consider you to be a human.\u201D</p><p>\u201C...We already proved that I wasn\u2019t an animal.\u201D</p><p>\u201CThat\u2019s right. You, Soujuurou, are Aozaki\u2019s first male friend, since the founding of Misaki High School. That\u2019s why I have a favour to ask of you. I want you to look into whether she would be open to dating someone.\u201D</p><p>\u2018Are you telling me to die?\u2019 Soujuurou wanted to ask, but he stopped himself, tilting his head instead. Acting as if he didn\u2019t understand the question in an attempt to escape. But Captain Mino asked again, with a more specific request. If comparing it to a sword strike, Soujuurou would have been slashed straight across his chest.</p><p>\u201CI\u2019ll be more direct. I want you to ask Aozaki whether she currently has a boyfriend.\u201D</p><p>A moment of silence. Soujuurou nodded.</p><p>\u201CSo, you\u2019re telling me to die, aren\u2019t you?\u201D</p><h2 id="_2" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_2" aria-hidden="true">#</a> 2/</h2><hr><hr><p>It was 11:30 at night. After parting ways with Mino Yoshitsune and finishing his shift, Soujuurou returned to the Kuonji Mansion, and upon arriving noticed that the lights were on in the living room. That\u2019s unusual, he thought as he went to say hello. Aozaki Aoko and Kuonji Alice were relaxing in the living room. On the TV, Thursday Movie Theatre had just ended.</p><p>\u201CJackie really mastered those wooden men, didn\u2019t he? Grieving for his parents, training, persecution, encounters, training, new techniques, leaving for the wilderness to become a master, then the bad guys showed up, training, training, and finally the farewell. It&#39;s got everything you could want from a coming of age story. No matter what anyone says, it\u2019s just got to end with a tearful fight against his master!\u201D Aoko clenched her fist, unable to hide her excitement.</p><p>On the other hand. \u201C...I understand most of what happened. However, I wonder why that cut at the end was vertical. You can give me an explanation I would be satisfied with, can\u2019t you, Aoko?\u201D Alice sighed, as if to say \u2018Aoko was just enjoying herself so much, that as her friend I had no choice but to watch it with her, so don\u2019t get the wrong idea\u2019.</p><p>\u201C\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u201D This could be my chance, Soujuurou sensed. The atmosphere in the living room was quite relaxed. If he brought up an outrageous topic now, it probably wouldn\u2019t seem too unnatural. \u201CI\u2019m back. I thought I\u2019d make a late night snack before I go to bed, so would you two like something as well?\u201D</p><p>\u201CHuh, really? Lucky, I was just thinking I wouldn\u2019t mind a bite to eat. I\u2019ll have some too, thanks!\u201D said Aoko.</p><p>\u201CIf you two are eating, I\u2019ll have some as well. Only a little bit.\u201D said Alice.</p><p>It was a perfect setup. Things must be done in order. It\u2019s best to shoot the horse rather than the general. A girl needs something sweet first. Making excellent use of the lessons he had learned over the past two months, Soujuurou headed to the kitchen.</p><p>\u201CNow the question is how do I bring it up\u2026\u201D Mino-senpai had given Soujuurou two orders. To confirm whether Aozaki Aoko was currently dating anyone, and to get her to talk about her intentions\u2026 no, her thoughts on the matter. There were a lot of reasons why Soujuurou wasn\u2019t enthusiastic about doing this, but after thinking back to Mino\u2019s serious expression, he hardened his resolve. He decided that he just had to do it. Since he didn\u2019t decline the request, Soujuurou was partly at fault himself. He needed to put in at least a minimum amount of effort.</p><p>\u201C...Well, that should just about do it. Aozaki, Alice, the food\u2019s ready. Come and get it.\u201D Soujuurou carried the desert to the sunroom. Both Aoko and Alice came in excitedly, a bound in their step. And there on the table was a silver cloche with it\u2019s dome shaped lid.</p><p>\u201CIt\u2019s only simple, but please eat up.\u201D With a pop, he lifted up the cloche. On the plate he revealed so majestically, was what seemed to be a jar of vivid red jam and 3 pieces of golden looking bread. The deep red jam was a cheap off-the-shelf jar, and the light brown bread was simply slices of toast. Combine them together, and you get a primitive sweet. \u2014No matter how you look at it, it was just jam on toast.</p><p>\u201CWell that\u2019s Shizuki-kun for you. You don\u2019t waste a cent.\u201D Alice gracefully took a seat.</p><p>\u201CNo, this isn\u2019t what you would call luxurious at all. ...What is this, are you trying out some new kind of mental attack on us again? Jam and Toast? Since when did we have a sweets shop here? Siberia cake? Hey, is this Siberia cake? No, Siberia cake would have actually made sense!\u201D</p><p>\u201CWhat are you talking about? This is Toppan\u2019s most expensive loaf of bread. What could be more luxurious?\u201D</p><p>\u201CYou\u2019re telling me, that one eighth, of 150 yen, is a luxury\u2026!\u201D Perhaps it was the influence from the movie she was watching earlier. Aoko moved behind Soujuurou, and put him in a headlock using both her arms. It seems she was so shocked by the jam and toast that she had completely forgotten about Soujuurou\u2019s collar.</p><p>\u201CAck, I give up\u2026 I surrender\u2026\u201D Soujuurou gasped. \u201CBut I\u2019ll keep saying it. You two really need to learn how to save money.\u201D</p><p>That\u2019s right. Before Soujuurou moved in, the mansion was in dire straits. Aoko was sent an allowance from her family to cover her living and food expenses. 30000 yen each month. Alice had 50000 transferred to her account from an unknown sender. And on top of that, the girls apparently calculated their food expenses by \u2018Putting what\u2019s left of last month\u2019s allowance in a jar.\u2019 It was like throwing their luck and desire into a cement mixer, and using that to manage their daily finances. As you would expect, their food budget would go bankrupt halfway through the month. For almost two years before Soujuurou moved in, their greatest threat wasn\u2019t stray Magi from afar, but dying from starvation at the end of each month!</p><p>\u201CUghh\u2026 for someone like you who lived up in the mountain those words are basically a religion! It\u2019s hard for people like us who are used to consumer culture! It\u2019s biologically impossible!\u201D</p><p>\u201CIt\u2019s biologically impossible to go without food too. No matter how dull, you need to make sure you eat three times a day.\u201D</p><p>Yes, Alice nodded along.</p><p>To digress for a little while, Soujuurou was the one in charge of their food budget, since he was putting in the money for their food, and the only one with any self-control when it came to money. The meal reformation had begun at the start of the year and dinner had become more simplistic every day since. While Aoko and Alice did make plans to overthrow him at the time, that\u2019s a story for another day.</p><p>\u201CIf we use up all the food money, we just need to go borrow some more! Since you\u2019ve come here our food quality just keeps going down!\u201D said Aoko.</p><p>\u201CIt\u2019s not like it was that great before though.\u201D said Soujuurou.</p><p>\u201CAhrgh! You\u2019re the last person I want to hear that from!\u201D</p><p>\u201COkay, Okay! Just let me go. Also, while you\u2019ve been wasting calories, Alice is going for her second piece.\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2014, Ahh.\u201D</p><p>\u201CWhat\u2019s with that \u2018Oh, you caught me?\u2019 face! Take your hand of the toast, that piece is mine!\u201D shouted Aoko.</p><p>\u201CI\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t think you needed it.\u201D</p><p>\u201CYeah, that\u2019s right. Aozaki isn\u2019t really needed.\u201D Soujuurou joined in.</p><p>\u201CI do need it! Jam on toast tastes good. ...More importantly, you guys aren\u2019t ganging up to make me angry, right?\u201D</p><p>No, we weren\u2019t trying to, Alice and Soujuurou exchanged glances. When these two teased Aoko, they could be an outstanding combination.</p><p>\u201C...You two airheads are getting on pretty well together.\u201D Perhaps she had said her piece and was satisfied, or else she had remembered that the refrigerator was practically empty. Aoko followed Alice\u2019s example and sat down, taking her piece of toast.</p><p>As an aside, there was a little trick to serving dessert at the Kuonji Mansion. Aoko would devour anything sweet, counting the calories as she went. No matter how magnificent the dessert was, Alice would rarely eat anything elaborate. For her, dessert was a piece of fruit. Pie or chocolate was out of the question, at most she would have some scones. Therefore, the choice of jam on toast was something that would defeat both of them.</p><p>The three finished their late night snack quietly, before relaxing with a cup of tea brewed by Alice. It was only a few minutes until midnight. When it was about time for them all to return to their rooms, Soujuurou, very naturally, said \u201CIt\u2019s almost spring break, isn\u2019t it. I\u2019m thinking that I want to take a day off work and do something different for a change. I need to make it through the end of year tests somehow before that though. Anyway, that\u2019s my plan. Aozaki, would you happen to be going out with anyone at the moment?\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u201D The two girls were speechless, as if a thousand year old temple had just collapsed in front of their eyes. Silence spread through the sunroom, as if they had forgotten to even breathe.</p><p>\u201CHuh?\u201D Aoko barely managed to reply after the surprising question. \u201CI, um, what?\u201D</p><p>\u201CWell, I was just wondering if you had any experience in dating.\u201D</p><p>\u201CI have no obligation nor intention to tell that to you, but just in case, I\u2019ll ask. \u2014Why?\u201D</p><p>With Aozaki glaring at him, Soujuurou averted his eyes, not answering the question.</p><p>\u201CDon\u2019t look away. I\u2019m not going to yell at you or strangle you. I\u2019m just one step away from my anger getting out of control. That\u2019s all.\u201D</p><p>\u201CBut that&#39;s the same thing,\u201D</p><p>\u201CEven I don\u2019t shout 24/7, every day of the year like Gyaos does. No matter how ridiculous the question is, if there\u2019s a logical reason behind it I want to answer sincerely. So can you please answer me properly? Just what led to that question coming out of your mouth? If it\u2019s your own question, I\u2019ll have you pay all kinds of compensation, but you\u2019ll have to give me a proper answer. However\u2014\u201D</p><p>In response to a smile which he had never seen before from Aoko, Soujuurou gulped loudly. \u201CHow-, However?\u201D</p><p>\u201CIf the truth happens to be that it was some vulgar request from a third party, things will go back to how they were before winter vacation. But this time there\u2019ll be two victims. There may be a new rumour about the haunted mansion going around before too long.\u201D</p><p>His back dripping with cold sweat, Soujuurou evaded the question with a vague reply. Normally, he would just confess, saying \u2018Sorry, someone asked me to do it\u2019, but for some reason, he just kept looking away, as if it was difficult for him to say that.</p><p>\u201C...Ahhh. I see. It\u2019s not that you can\u2019t say it, you just don\u2019t want to. That\u2019s fine. It\u2019s not that I\u2019m actually angry. Instead, we\u2019ll leave this conversation here.\u201D</p><p>\u201CAre you okay with that? You definitely look like you\u2019re angry.\u201D</p><p>\u201CI just know that when you make that face, I\u2019m not going to get anything else out of you. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve got some weird conviction stopping you from telling me who put you onto this.\u201D</p><p>\u201CUm? No, I can tell you that. Mino-senpai is going to confess to you, so he wanted me to investigate whether you were seeing anyone at the moment.\u201D</p><p>\u201CPff-!\u201D Oddly enough, Aoko made the exact same mistake Soujuurou had a few hours earlier. \u201CWh, what happened to your determination!? Weren\u2019t you going to protect them even if it killed you!?\u201D</p><p>\u201CNo, Mino-senpai didn\u2019t say that I \u2018need to keep it a secret\u2019. I didn\u2019t answer before because of personal reasons.\u201D</p><p>\u201CYou can say some pretty awful things without even hesitating...\u201D</p><p>If you were asked by someone else to find out whether I was dating anyone, you\u2019re dead. With Aoko\u2019s threat, Soujuurou had kept quiet out of fear for his own life. Aoko thought something was off still, but it seemed that was actually the truth.</p><p>\u201C...Hahh. Um, I don\u2019t currently have a boyfriend, and I don\u2019t plan on getting one in the future. Will that do?\u201D</p><p>\u201CWhat?\u201D said Soujuurou.</p><p>\u201CI\u2019m saying that I haven\u2019t had a boyfriend. Ever. Seriously, this\u2026 Hey, what are you laughing for?\u201D</p><p>\u201CNo, I\u2019m not laughing. But what happened? Weren\u2019t you going to get angry if it was a question from someone else?\u201D</p><p>\u201CIf it\u2019s a question from Mino-senpai, I\u2019d answer no matter what he asked. I respect him a lot. He\u2019s, you know, pretty amazing. If he confessed to me, there\u2019d be a high chance that I, well, wouldn\u2019t turn him down.\u201D As she said this, Aozaki Aoko\u2019s cheeks turned slightly red, like you would expect from a girl her age.</p><p>\u201COh\u2014\u201D</p><p>With a clang, the midnight bell rang out from the grandfather clock. After Aoko and Alice had returned to their own rooms, Soujuurou was left alone at the table to ponder what Aoko had said. His face looked like a pigeon hit by a peashooter. \u201CIs such a calamity actually possible?\u201D</p><h2 id="_3" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_3" aria-hidden="true">#</a> 3/</h2><hr><hr><p>\u201CThat would be possible, certainly.\u201D</p><p>\u201CIt would\u2026!\u201D</p><p>It was 3 o\u2019clock the following day, just after class had ended. Soujuurou had quickly declined any invitations, no matter who they were from, rushed to a telephone box on the outskirts of town and dialed a secret number. \u201CHello, this is the Garan no Dou store.\u201D said the voice on the phone. After Soujuurou had explained the events of last night, the immediate reply was, surprisingly, affirmative.</p><p>\u201CDespite how she looks, Aoko\u2019s weak to others&#39; kindness. At her core, that idiot really likes other people.\u201D Explained the voice on the phone.</p><p>\u201CI know that, but dating is a different story. It seems like Aozaki\u2019s put up a wall, towards that kind of thing especially.\u201D</p><p>\u201CSee? You\u2019ve got it, don\u2019t you. That wall won\u2019t come down easily. Why? It\u2019s simple. Aoko dislikes romance. No, you could even say she detests it.\u201D</p><p>\u201CMmmh\u2026 Detesting seems rather extreme.\u201D</p><p>\u201CThat\u2019s right. But what else could you expect? She was horribly betrayed by her first love after all.\u201D</p><p>\u201CI see\u2014 Huh?\u201D The boy\u2019s sour expression was reflected in the glass of the telephone box. The distressed boy began to question himself. Wait, where should I start? The fact that she detests romance? That she was dumped? Or what the words \u2018first love\u2019 meant?</p><p>\u201CYou know, her first love, her darling.\u201D</p><p>\u201CYou\u2019re telling me that Aozaki had a first love, and was dumped by them!?\u201D</p><p>\u201CMmh, no that\u2019s not exactly right. I wouldn\u2019t say she was dumped, They\u2019re probably still in contact with each other? After all, her first lover is still in Misaki Town, and still meets with Aoko frequently.\u201D</p><p>\u201CWha\u2014\u201D</p><p>\u201CTo put it simply, there was a really bad betrayal. Ever since then, it\u2019s been as if Aoko is allergic to dating. My own little sister really makes me la\u2014 no, it\u2019s quite a misfortunate fate. Oh, it\u2019s about time to burn out the mystic line now. If we talk any longer we\u2019ll be found by Alice\u2019s Ploy. Bye then, call me again whenever you\u2019re in the mood.\u201D</p><p>Click, beep, beep. As the call was cut off, silence took its place. Pushing his way through the dizziness, Soujuurou put the receiver back on its hook. After a short, deep breath, he tried to summarize all the information he had learned so far. Thinking about it, it really was a typical story that you could find anywhere. The student council president of steel, Aozaki Aoko, was a demon, but before that she\u2019s still a young girl. Having a first love or two would be completely normal.</p><p>\u201COkay, I can understand the logic behind it at least.\u201D After pushing any feelings that would cause him to go protest into the corner of his mind, Soujuurou left the telephone box. The problem he should be thinking about wasn\u2019t his own displeasure. Even imagining that Aoko might possibly still be dating that first love was a scary thought.</p><p>\u25C6</p><p>Soujuurou entered his usual caf\xE9, finding that Mino Yoshitsune had arrived ahead of him. So tall your eyes are drawn to him, and wearing an antiquated white cloak. He sat at the window like a strange silhouette, but his expression was that of a troubled scholarly young man. The caf\xE9\u2019s waitresses and the office ladies passing by outside couldn\u2019t help but stare. You can\u2019t stop a river from flowing, after all.</p><p>\u201CMino-senpai.\u201D Mino nodded quietly in reply to Soujuurou\u2019s greeting. Checking that there were no other customers nearby, Soujuurou sat down opposite Mino and placed his elbows on the table, leaning in close.</p><p>\u201CLet&#39;s hear the results.\u201D With a cold, tense voice, Mino got straight to business. He had such a simpleness and solidness to him, that if a third party who knew Shizuku Soujuurou well were here, they\u2019d be likely to think \u2018Wait, is Mino-senpai just a high end model of Soujuurou?\u2019</p><p>\u201CThis is what I\u2019ve heard. One, Aozaki doesn\u2019t currently have a boyfriend. She also doesn\u2019t intend to get one in the future. Two, she\u2019s never had a boyfriend before. Three, Aozaki does have fondness for you.\u201D</p><p>\u201CHow did you manage to get that third piece of information?\u201D</p><p>\u201CWas it unnecessary?\u201D</p><p>\u201CNo, it\u2019s perfect. The captain of the swim club has quite the discerning eye.\u201D As if to say that hearing that was plenty, the white-cloaked leader of the cheer squad stood up to leave. ...but.</p><p>\u201CFour, Aozaki detests romance. Five, that\u2019s because she was betrayed by her first love. Six, she still has a relationship with that first love. Seven, that\u2019s because they live in this town, and still meet with each other frequently.\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2014It seems things won\u2019t be that simple.\u201D Captain Mino sat back down, rubbing his temples.</p><p>\u201CI can understand how you feel. I felt that same dizziness just twenty minutes ago.\u201D</p><p>\u201CYes. You\u2019re right. Someone who knows Aozaki well would be overcome with such dizziness they would think the world is ending. ...Putting that aside, the first half of the information has a very different quality to that of the latter half. Is it right to assume that the source of the information was two different people?\u201D</p><p>\u201CThe first three came from Aozaki herself. The rest of the information comes from a trustworthy relative of hers.\u201D</p><p>\u201C...Which one should I believe?\u201D</p><p>\u201CI don\u2019t know. You only asked me to find out what the situation was.\u201D</p><p>\u201CI\u2019m surprised, it seems you can be quite spiteful as well. I apologize, let me ask again. If possible, I\u2019d like you to give me some advice as well. You can pick whatever you like from the menu.\u201D Mino passed the menu straight to Soujuurou.</p><p>He picked three cakes from the menu, getting them wrapped to take home, saying \u201CIn this situation, I would imagine someone with a more objective view would have more credibility than a subjective one.\u201D</p><p>\u201CSo you\u2019re saying I shouldn\u2019t trust what Aozaki said herself. I think so too. ...But I doubt Aozaki is the kind of person to twist the truth for her own convenience.\u201D</p><p>\u201CI agree, but Aozaki is also likely to misunderstand something that would be unthinkable for a normal person.\u201D</p><p>\u201CAgreed again. For it to happen twice, let alone three times.\u201D</p><p>For those two who knew Aoko, they reached the heart of the matter incredibly smoothly. \u201CWith the situation like this, there\u2019s nothing I can do now. This is the end of it. Thanks for your help, Shizuki.\u201D</p><p>\u201CHm? The end? What?\u201D</p><p>\u201CYes. Aoko has someone in her heart\u2026 her first love, right? It would be ill-mannered to interfere with someone&#39;s romance. Investigating any further would be too much for me.\u201D</p><p>\u201CBut, still.\u201D Is it okay to give up like that? Soujuurou protested silently. \u201CI only told you what I heard, I haven\u2019t confirmed any of it. And don\u2019t you want to find out? Who Aozaki\u2019s first love was?\u201D</p><p>\u201CThat\u2019s\u2026 true\u2026\u201D Captain Mino folded his arms with an uneasy expression.</p><p>\u201CLet\u2019s look into it. Right now. Thoroughly. I\u2019ve been compensated for the advice. We can\u2019t stop here.\u201D</p><p>\u201CBut we\u2019re talking about her love life here though.\u201D</p><p>\u201CThis is about your love life as well, isn\u2019t it, Mino-senpai! We should investigate Aozaki\u2019s first love!\u201D Soujuurou was more eager than ever.</p><p>Feeling his kouhai\u2019s burning gaze, the white cloaked, handsome young man frowned, deep in thought. Even if he cheered a lot of people on, it seemed like he wasn\u2019t used to being cheered on himself. \u201C...You\u2019re right. This is my last chance to bring things to an end. I wouldn\u2019t want to leave any regrets.\u201D Mino nodded sincerely as he readjusted his cap. \u201CBut if we want to investigate, there\u2019s a lot of ground to cover. If we\u2019re talking about her first love, that\u2019s probably before high school. Do you know where Aoko\u2019s family home is?\u201D</p><p>\u201CMore or less. It\u2019s a bit of a distance away though. Do you know of the Akikoshiro station in Sugawa?\u201D</p><p>\u201CI know it. It is quite a distance. I wonder where someone from there would go to middle school? It\u2019s a tough ask to walk that far. It would be easier if one of our students had gone to middle school with Aozaki.\u201D But Mino Yoshitsune knew that Aoko\u2019s time in middle school was shrouded in mystery. \u2018Entering high school was like a fresh start for my life.\u2019 He remembered how Aoko had said that, as if it was a joke. The tone may have been lighthearted, but to this day Mino remembered the distant look she had in her eyes.</p><p>\u201CI guess we\u2019ve just got to go there and gather information. It\u2019ll be a hard journey on foot, but\u2026 I don\u2019t have enough leeway to pay for your fare on top of my own. I\u2019m saving to prepare for when I graduate.\u201D Hmm, that\u2019s true, the two pondered with arms crossed. At that moment\u2014</p><p>\u201CAlright, if you\u2019re after a ride, I can help. I only just bought the car, and I\u2019ve just got my license. Is that fine with you guys? I\u2019ve actually kinda been wanting to go on a drive for some practice.\u201D</p><p>A young man\u2019s friendly voice suddenly called out from the seat behind them. \u201CI\u2019ve heard what\u2019s going on. It\u2019s quite hil\u2026 no, things have become quite troublesome, haven\u2019t they, Soujuurou-kun.\u201D</p><p>\u201CIchigozuka-san.\u201D</p><p>Hey, he waved back with a smile. It was one of the regulars at this caf\xE9, the young man called Ichigozuka. ...skipping the details, this, no matter which way you look at it, unbalanced trio had a long discussion, and ended up forming an extremely peculiar investigation squad. Soujuurou, who was curious about the truth behind Aoko\u2019s first love. Mino Yoshitsune, who was preparing to confess his feelings. And Ichigozuka, who was just plain interested in what was going on. While their desires may have differed, all of their interests aligned.</p><p>\u25C6</p><p>The jeep drove through the countryside. While Mino had declined the offer at first, he lost to Ichigozuka\u2019s smooth-talk and Soujuurou\u2019s strong encouragement and they ended up going by car. Ichigozuka\u2019s new car was a Mitsubishi Pajero, an excellent vehicle which could even go offroad. Ichigozuka\u2019s model-like figure was at odds with the roughness of the jeep, but it didn\u2019t seem to bother him. He was in high spirits, whistling as he gripped the steering wheel.</p><p>\u201CIf she\u2019s from Akikoshiro, there\u2019d be two middle schools nearby. Should we start with the close one or the far one?\u201D Without opening a map to look at, Ichigozuka smoothly sped along in the jeep. Unexpectedly, he was quite aggressive on the accelerator, and they were practically drifting around the right turns and such. Mino and Soujuurou were sitting in the backseat.</p><p>\u201CShizuki. This may be a bit late, but can we really trust him?\u201D</p><p>\u201CI\u2019m pretty sure. I don\u2019t know his background, but he\u2019s a regular at the fish shop. He\u2019s thought of fondly in the shopping district, as a young lad of fine character who cooks for himself in these modern times.\u201D</p><p>\u201C...Well. But it\u2019s true that I don\u2019t have time or money. It\u2019s good to have people to help out. I don\u2019t have any complaints, as long as it\u2019s done out of good will.\u201D Rubbing the wrinkles on his brow, Mino leaned back deeply into the seat.</p><p>Mino gazed at the rural scenery that passed by his window, a nostalgic look in his eyes. He didn\u2019t have long left to see this scenery. In two days time, Mino would leave his hometown. No one but the teachers knew that he couldn\u2019t attend the graduation ceremony due to the circumstances at his new university. The reason no one else at school had been told was due to Mino being easily moved to tears, and his lingering attachment.</p><p>He was over 180 centimeters tall, with sharp features and long, dark eyelashes. A good old fashioned traditional Japanese handsome student, a kind that is almost completely lost to time. He truly was the man born to be the captain of the cheer squad, Mino Yoshitsune. However, contrary to his outward appearance, he lacked confidence in himself, and had an introverted personality. While Yoshitsune himself was a bookworm, his grandfather had been a legend in the cheer squad before the Misaki High School\u2019s temporary closure. After the entrance ceremony he was suddenly led to the cheer squad, and was surprised when his grandfather\u2019s name was brought up. When he was urged to join the cheer squad, the reason he couldn\u2019t refuse was partially due to his timidness, but also due to his respect for a grandfather he never knew. Hearing how his grandfather had lived, even if Yoshitsune didn\u2019t know him, he could tell that he was a man of noble character, someone he could admire and be pleased with.</p><p>But when Yoshitsune was a first year, the cheer squad was facing the pressure of extinction. The problem was that there wasn\u2019t much interest in the cheer squad, and on top of that, Misaki High School\u2019s clubs were on the verge of losing their spirit. The previous captain, the one who invited Yoshitsune to the cheer squad, was an awkward kind of person, but he worked really hard for the sake of the cheer squad and Misaki High School. In the custom of cheering on the clubs from behind, he felt the feeling of belonging you can\u2019t find outside school life and the sparkle of youth. He was a spirited, straightforward senpai, who believed in Yoshitsune as \u2018the grandson of a great, dependable man\u2019, despite his tendency to stay back in the shadows.</p><p>The reason Yoshitsune took over the role of captain in his second year was because he didn\u2019t want the previous captain\u2019s hard work to go to waste. While Yoshitsune\u2019s outward appearance looked like that of a cheer squad captain, his personality wasn\u2019t suited for it. He was always a step behind.</p><p>The one who gave him a push was the new student council president, Aozaki Aoko. What exactly Aoko thought of Mino Yoshitsune, was something he had no way of knowing. In truth, she had taken the rumours of him being \u2018the new demon of a captain, who was silent to the boy\u2019s cries and the girl\u2019s misery\u2019 at face value. The revival of the cheer squad was essential for the revitalization of the sports clubs. \u201CThe responsibility for the prisoners slacking off, for the most part, falls on the warden, does it not?\u201D From the jeep\u2019s backseat, Mino thought back to the time Aoko had burst into the cheer squad\u2019s club room with those sharp words. \u201C...Seriously. Looking back on it, it was a tough year.\u201D Since then it\u2019s been busy every day. With the senpai who trusted in him, and the kouhai who created the opportunities for the cheer squad\u2019s revival, it was a year of hard work, even without being the captain. He learned that even without aiming for perfection, you can achieve thorough results. Fighting when you can\u2019t see what\u2019s ahead was one of Aozaki Aoko\u2019s strong points.</p><p>\u201CWe\u2019ll be at Akikoshiro soon. I\u2019ll wait in the car, but you two, are you really planning to go in there dressed like that?\u201D And with Ichigozuka\u2019s words, Mino Yoshitsune\u2019s recollection was interrupted.</p><p>\u201CThat\u2019s right, is there something wrong with them?\u201D</p><p>\u201CI mean, Soujuurou-kun\u2019s probably fine, but you\u2019d stand out a bit wearing that. How about you at least take the cape off?\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2014No, I\u2019ll go ask around as I am. It isn\u2019t like we\u2019re doing anything to be guilty of.\u201D Well my motives may be a bit cowardly. He added, as if to scold himself while he adjusted his cap.</p><p>While they did seem a little strange, their questioning went smoothly. Seeing that the sun was beginning to set they finished their investigation of Akikoshiro, and the three of them headed back to Misaki Town. Both middle schools near Akikoshiro were co-ed, and they soon learned which one Aoko had gone to. She stood out that much. As soon as they mentioned Aoko\u2019s name to the current students, it set off the landslide.</p><p>\u201CWhile this is just based on gossip, it seems that Aozaki was completely different in middle school to what she\u2019s like now. From the way her kohai were talking, she seemed relaxed, or perhaps graceful would fit better.\u201D</p><p>\u201CReally? I wouldn\u2019t have minded hearing those kids for myself. So you\u2019re saying that this Aoko-chan was a yamato nadeshiko for at least her middle school life?\u201D</p><p>\u201CCorrection. Aozaki still is a yamato nadeshiko.\u201D</p><p>\u201CHm? Mino-senpai, what\u2019s a \u2018yamato nadeshiko\u2019?\u201D</p><p>\u201CIt means a woman who is wise and profound, stands up for strangers and is considerate of others, neither giving in to tyranny nor yielding to evil. A beauty who knows not lies nor deceit\u2014\u2014 Ichigozuka-san, don\u2019t you think you\u2019re driving a bit recklessly? That sharp turn was dangerous.\u201D</p><p>\u201CAh, sorry, sorry. A bird just jumped out in front of me, and I panicked a bit. No, it wasn\u2019t just one of those crows, it was a starling, I think. More importantly, Soujuurou-kun, is this Aoko-chan you two are so devoted to really that kind of person?\u201D</p><p>\u201CAt first I thought it was a different person with the same name who I didn\u2019t know, but looking at it again, I guess she mostly fits the description.\u201D</p><p>Ichigozuka had joined Soujuurou and Mino\u2019s conversation along the way, as they sorted out what information they had found. Soujuurou and Mino asked around separately. Since both of their information matched, its credibility was high. The one problem was that not once did anything about romance come up.</p><p>\u201CFrom the fact that none of the students had seen anything, we can probably assume that her first love wasn\u2019t someone from her middle school.\u201D</p><p>\u201COh? In middle school, just being a couple would get you teased from everyone around you, right? Perhaps Aoko-chan might have hidden the relationship?\u201D</p><p>\u201CNo\u2026\u201D</p><p>\u201COh please.\u201D</p><p>Aoko wouldn\u2019t be able to hide something like that, thought Soujuurou. Aozaki wouldn\u2019t hide things like that, thought Captain Mino.</p><p>\u201CAre you sure? Well, I guess we\u2019ve got one option left. If there\u2019s no witnesses at school, then they must have met up outside school. We\u2019ll have to quietly investigate around Misaki Town tomorrow, right?\u201D Ichigozuka\u2019s remarks were quite lax, but they also hit the mark. If nothing came up at her middle school, then their only choice was to try around town.</p><p>\u25C6</p><p>The three decided on a time to meet up tomorrow before parting ways in front of the caf\xE9. \u201CI\u2019ll try out any ideas I\u2019ve got tomorrow morning. There might be someone in the cheer squad who\u2019s seen Aozaki meeting up with this first love.\u201D Mino said goodbye as he left, his cloak fluttering behind him.</p><p>After seeing Mino off, Soujuurou began walking in the opposite direction of the Kuonji mansion. They hadn\u2019t really found out anything today. He couldn\u2019t go home like that. I want to at least confirm that it\u2019s true, he said to himself as he hurriedly passed through the shopping district. Unusually for this man, he was for some unknown reason quite determined.</p><p>The sun had completely set by the time Soujuurou reached Aida Church. Father Eiri wasn\u2019t in the chapel, but Suse Yuika was in the middle of cleaning up, wearing her nun\u2019s habit.</p><p>\u201CGood evening, Yuika-san.\u201D Soujuurou called out to announce his visit. He was being considerate to the blind Yuika.</p><p>\u201COh, Shizuki-san. I\u2019m terribly sorry, but we\u2019ve planned to close down early today. Please come again tomorrow for a consultation.\u201D</p><p>\u201CNo, I didn\u2019t come for a consultation. I\u2019ve got something I wanted to ask.\u201D Perhaps due to the question being about romance, Soujuurou scratched his cheek. While he seems na\xEFve, but at his core, he was weak to beautiful women.</p><p>\u201CMy. That\u2019s an expression I wouldn\u2019t have expected from you, Shizuki-san. I\u2019m surprised\u2014 No, I\u2019m delighted. That you have those sorts of worries as well.\u201D My my, said the Sister as if to tease Soujuurou, a reassuring smile on her face. Although she would never admit it, Yuika enjoyed teasing others just as much as her older sister, Ritsuka.</p><p>\u201C...You\u2019ve known Aozaki for a long time, haven\u2019t you?\u201D</p><p>\u201CI wouldn\u2019t exactly say that. I\u2019ve only known her personally for about three or four years.\u201D \u201CThat\u2019s plenty. You only need to answer this if you know the answer, and if it\u2019s something you can tell me, but did Aozaki have a first love?\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2014Could you repeat that?\u201D</p><p>That\u2019s right. According to informant T, \u2018Aoko was betrayed by her first love\u2019. However person T had a personality where you could trust them, but couldn\u2019t always believe them. So first he needed to confirm whether \u2018there really was a first love\u2019. Honestly, Soujuurou was hoping that this was all a joke from person T.</p><p>However. \u201CAh, that\u2019s what you\u2019re talking about. Yes, she had one, a first love. Aoko-san\u2019s first love is a story that\u2019s horrifying to hear, and harsh to tell, a tragedy worthy of Shakespeare.\u201D She grinned, with a smile unbecoming of a woman of the church. Sister Yuika crushed what little hope the young man had left.</p><p>\u201C...Yuika-san, do you know that person?\u201D Soujuurou asked as his mind was bleached with an anemia-like shock.</p><p>The sister replied with the smile of a pure, holy maiden, dodging the question. \u201CI can\u2019t see, after all. I can\u2019t tell what his face looks like, and I\u2019ve only heard the story. From my position, I can\u2019t talk about people\u2019s past based on speculation. It would, however, be a different story if you were to enter the confessional.\u201D</p><p>The confessional was a small closed off room made of wood in the corner of the church. Kind of like two telephone boxes placed next to each other, a person with troubles would enter one side, the Father would enter the other; it was a space where they could share their sins alone. The confessional could be called a cornerstone of this world. After leaving this secret room, all the secrets and suffering would be \u2018erased\u2019. In a town with a lot of people living there, the confessional was probably an excellent form of mental healing. Even small wounds can lead to a person falling apart if the pain remains. Even if it doesn\u2019t result in any drastic resolution, even if it only stops the pain, just the fact that there\u2019s somewhere they can open their heart to will be a support.</p><p>\u201CThat small room might be a bit much. It\u2019s nothing that serious. No, maybe it is serious?\u201D</p><p>\u201CI wasn\u2019t involved, so I can\u2019t really say anything for sure. However\u2026 yes. If I were Aoko-san, I would have silenced everyone involved with her first love, felt despair at the state of the world, and joined a convent. Thinking about it, there\u2019s no other reason for a young woman to become a Sister.\u201D</p><p>\u201C...um. Is this where I\u2019m supposed to laugh?\u201D</p><p>\u201COf course. There\u2019s a lot of troubles in this world that would stop you from keeping on going if you don\u2019t laugh them away.\u201D It was a terrifying joke. If you were to ask what was so terrifying about it, it would be the fact that this Sister rarely ever made a joke. \u201CWe\u2019ve gotten a bit off track. Ritsuka\u2019s probably more qualified for this kind of talk. Finding out about gossip, and selling it, is her field of expertise.\u201D</p><p>\u201C...I see. Where\u2019s Ritsuka-san now?\u201D</p><p>\u201CShe would be in the break room, indulging in her laziness. I imagine she\u2019s still in there now.\u201D The break room was inside the chapel, where Sister Yuika and Father Eiri lived. Soujuurou thanked Yuika and headed towards the break room.</p><p>\u201CRitsuka-san, are you in there?\u201D Even when he knocked there was no reply. He tried turning the doorknob, and it turned smoothly. The door wasn\u2019t locked, so she must be inside. She may have still been sleeping. \u201CExcuse me, I\u2019m coming in.\u201D However after opening the door and going inside, he found the break room deserted. Despite it being almost spring, the oil heater was on. On the table was a half-eaten mandarin, a half read mystery novel and a piece of notepaper.</p><p>\u201CHm?\u201D Soujuurou picked up the obviously suspicious note.</p><p>\u2018Did you think it was the useless wicked Sister? Too bad, it was the almighty slacker helper, Ritsuka-chan! I overheard what you were talking about. It\u2019s a very interesting incident, but I\u2019ll pass this time. Ako-chan\u2019s lightning is scary, so I\u2019m not going to involve myself in the matter at all.\u2019</p><p>The message was written in pink and green highlighter, and disintegrated as soon as he had finished reading it. Soujuurou let out an exaggerated sigh. \u201CEither way, both sisters were useless.\u201D Saying that honest impression out loud, he turned the heater off.</p><h2 id="_4" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_4" aria-hidden="true">#</a> 4/</h2><hr><hr><p>The next day, foggy, just before noon. Soujuurou was about to leave for the caf\xE9 to meet up with the others, but Aoko called out to him as he was about to leave the Kuonji Mansion\u2019s lobby.</p><p>\u201COh, did you have work again today Soujuurou? ...If you\u2019re scheduled in, then there\u2019s nothing you can do about it, but you\u2019re going to be alright for exams, aren\u2019t you? There\u2019s only two days left, you know?\u201D</p><p>\u201CWhether I\u2019ll be alright or not, I\u2019ll be back in the evening. I can pull an all-nighter then.\u201D</p><p>\u201CThat\u2019s alright then. But between yesterday and today, you\u2019ve been acting rather suspicious\u2026 You haven\u2019t found another shady job, have you?\u201D</p><p>\u201CNo, it\u2019s nothing like that. It\u2019s sort of like volunteering this time.\u201D</p><p>\u201CVolunteering\u2026 Seriously, that\u2019s just making me worry all the more.\u201D</p><p>Dodging Aoko\u2019s questioning, Soujuurou hurried to the caf\xE9. It was the start of March, and the end of year exams were fast approaching. This investigation started by Captain Mino had reached its third day. At Misaki High School, preparation for the graduation ceremony started as soon as the end of year exams were over. Soujuurou also didn\u2019t want to increase Aoko\u2019s worries during the exams, so he wanted to finish their investigation before then. There were only a few days left, no, looking at the situation they would have to finish the investigation today. However.</p><p>\u201CMino-senpai seems kind of out of it, doesn\u2019t he?\u201D</p><p>\u201CYes, considering he\u2019s only got up until the graduation ceremony to confess, Yoshitsune-kun\u2019s rather calm.\u201D</p><p>In an out of the way corner of Caf\xE9 Janus, Soujuurou and Ichigozuka talked in hushed voices. Since Mino had yet to arrive, Soujuurou had asked that complaint-like question to the young man.</p><p>\u201CWell, that\u2019s probably the difference in our objectives. The two of us are interested in the events surrounding Aoko-chan and Yoshitsune-kun. On the other hand, Yoshitsune-kun\u2019s feelings were already decided from the start. What he\u2019s doing is more like a final safety check. Unless some major truth gets revealed, I imagine he will confess to Aoko-chan when the time limit is up.\u201D</p><p>\u201C...A major truth?\u201D</p><p>\u201CIt would be if Aoko-chan is currently going out with anyone, wouldn\u2019t it? Yoshitsune-kun doesn\u2019t seem too interested in this first love of hers, after all. Think about it. If you confess to a girl who already has a boyfriend, it\u2019ll only cause trouble for her, won\u2019t it?\u201D</p><p>I see, Soujuurou nodded. It seemed like he was the only one who was stuck on Aozaki Aoko\u2019s first love. Ichigozuka was truly cheering Mino Yoshitsune on, and Mino was checking that there wasn\u2019t going to be a landmine buried when he confesses. As a man, if Mino discovered that there was a \u2018landmine\u2019, as long as it wasn\u2019t too big, he would be prepared to jump over it, you could say.</p><p>\u201CHowever, he wouldn\u2019t want Aozaki to get hurt in that explosion. Senpai wanted to know whether or not Aozaki would be inconvenienced by his confession\u2026\u201D</p><p>\u201CThat\u2019s on the money. It\u2019s fine if he takes damage himself, but he wants to avoid the other party being troubled by it. It\u2019s a little bit over considerate, but I guess Aoko-chan is just that important to him.\u201D</p><p>Captain Mino\u2019s character was exactly as the rumours said. Him rebuilding Misa-High\u2019s cheer squad from the verge of extinction may have been because of that moral fibre. Cool, handsome, silent, and most of all prudently considerate. Soujuurou was quite impressed, thinking that the white clothed captain would be unlikely to ever let his emotions get out of control in front of others.</p><p>\u201CSorry I\u2019m a bit late. ...No, don\u2019t worry about the menu. We\u2019ll be leaving straight away.\u201D</p><p>Speaking of the devil, Captain Mino appeared in his usual cloak, sending away the waitress, who had already become his fan.</p><p>\u201COh? You\u2019re unusually hasty. Did you get some new information?\u201D</p><p>\u201CA sudden development. I\u2019ve discovered something very important.\u201D Despite saying they\u2019d be leaving straight away, Mino sat down. Leaning over the table, he began talking. \u201CThe younger sister of one of our club members was one of Aozaki\u2019s classmates in middle school. I was busy talking with them until now, and I\u2019ve found out how to identify her first love.\u201D</p><p>\u201CWhat?\u201D</p><p>\u201CSupposedly, They\u2019re older than Aozaki, a kind faced university student. And apparently they\u2019re from where she grew up.\u201D</p><p>\u201CThat\u2019s rather vague. There\u2019d be a lot of men who fit that description, wouldn\u2019t there?\u201D</p><p>\u201CNo, if we look at who Aozaki spends time around, we should easily be able to figure out who it is. If he was a university student while Aozaki was in middle school, he would have to be at least five years older than her. It\u2019s also someone from where she grew up, who still meets with her frequently. That was right, wasn\u2019t it, Shizuki?\u201D</p><p>\u201CYes. ...Huh. That\u2019s odd. If she was talking to someone that much older, there would have to be a lot more people seeing it, wouldn\u2019t there?\u201D</p><p>\u201CThat\u2019s it. In other words, her first love would have to be someone who it wouldn\u2019t be strange for her to talk to, someone who she meets with frequently, yet it wouldn\u2019t seem like they were dating. Under these conditions, I can think of one person who fits.\u201D</p><p>\u201CIn town or at school, it wouldn\u2019t seem strange for Aozaki to talk to him, at least five years older than her, with a kind face\u2014 Ah.\u201D said Soujuurou, his face freezing up. With those conditions, there was one person who fit perfectly!</p><p>\u201CHuh? Who, who? Who is it? Have you both figured it out already?\u201D</p><p>\u201CYes. Although you likely haven\u2019t met him, Ichigozuka-san\u2026\u201D</p><p>\u201CThe student council advisor at Misaki High School, Mr. Yamashiro Kazuki, fits the conditions.\u201D Mino\u2019s accusation indicated that things were ramping up. Thinking about it, the distance between Aoko and Yamashiro was rather strange. Rather than student and teacher, their communication was more frank, like that of siblings. They obviously trust each other, but they keep their distance and try not to rely on each other. There was more than enough evidence to assume that something happened between Aoko and Mr. Yamashiro in the past.</p><p>It was just before 3 in the afternoon. There was only another hour left before the school would shut, so this wasn\u2019t the time to bother with a plan. The three of them rushed out of the caf\xE9.</p><p>\u25C6</p><p>\u201CMr. Yamashiro, were you Aozaki\u2019s first love?\u201D</p><p>\u201CIs this some new kind of harassment?\u201D</p><p>With a smile on his face, Yamashiro Kazuki replied instantly, his tone of voice not matching his expression at all. That\u2019s it. Explanation over. Soujuurou and the others&#39; investigation had gone back to square one in three seconds flat. More accurately, it was over three seconds after they entered the staff room.</p><p>\u201C...I apologize. You see, for very personal reasons, I, um, wanted to ask something about Aozaki.\u201D</p><p>\u201CNo, no need for an explanation, Mino-kun. I don\u2019t ever want to get involved with that walking disaster. If I asked why you asked that question, and why you asked it to me, I\u2019d lose my escape route.\u201D Looking up at the clock, Yamashiro Kazuki smiled at the intruders. There was three minutes until school was over. His expression showed an iron will to do not even a minute of overtime. \u201CIs that everything? I\u2019ll take my leave then. However, Captain Mino, Shizuki-kun. Since you\u2019ve brought an intruder into school grounds so suddenly, I\u2019m pretty sure the student council president will hear about it. It\u2019s a bother though, so I\u2019ll pretend I didn\u2019t see anything.\u201D Saying goodbye, Mr. Yamashiro left the staff room. He turned the key in his sedan and left to go home, happily on time.</p><p>\u201CMr. Yamashiro is the same as always.\u201D</p><p>\u201CIndeed. Even the school newspaper, printed on straw paper, changes with time, but Mr. Yamashiro never even bends. In a way, it\u2019s admirable how reliable he is.\u201D</p><p>\u201CCome on. I might not know him very well, but he seems like a failure as a person. He\u2019s competent, but just look at his awful personality.\u201D</p><p>It was just past four in the afternoon. The three were standing in front of the recently closed gate to Misaki High School, at a loss. The sun had begun to set and their only clue had now disappeared. It seemed like this would probably be it for the day.</p><p>\u201CSo that\u2019s the end of the investigation then.\u201D</p><p>\u201CYou\u2019re right. Tomorrow\u2019s our last chance.\u201D</p><p>\u201CNo, that\u2019s not what I meant. The whole investigation ends here. Tomorrow\u2019s already the day before the end of year test, right? I can\u2019t cause you any more trouble. Shizuki, allow me to thank you again. You were a great help.\u201D Mino turned around to face Soujuurou, deeply bowing his head.</p><p>\u201C...Senpai, are you going to go confess to Aozaki now then?\u201D</p><p>\u201CNo, it\u2019d be impolite to push myself onto her now. Aozaki has her end of year tests as well. I\u2019ll wait until after the graduation ceremony.\u201D</p><p>\u201CYeah. It was fun, but this is probably a good place to wrap things up. To be honest, I\u2019m pushing things a bit far myself. It may not look like it, but I do actually have a part time job. It\u2019s hard to leave three days open from work.\u201D</p><p>\u201C...\u201D While Soujuurou seemed quite unsatisfied, Mino and Ichigozuka seemed rather cheerful.</p><p>\u201CI\u2019ll drive you to the caf\xE9. You haven\u2019t had dinner yet, right? I\u2019m the oldest one here, I\u2019ll treat you as long as it\u2019s on the cheaper side.\u201D The three of them climbed into Ichigozuka\u2019s Pajero. The sound of the 4WD engine roared up the tranquil hill road. And that was how it happened. Their three day long adventure of a first love came to a close, with an unsatisfying and inconclusive end.</p><p>\u25C6</p><p>Soujuurou declined Ichigozuka\u2019s invitation and headed back to the Kuonji Mansion alone. It seemed like Mino and Ichigozuka were enjoying a fancy dinner at the caf\xE9, but Soujuurou just wasn\u2019t in the mood. He climbed up the tall hill and entered the Kuonji estate. Opening up the solemn metal railing between the stone gate posts, Soujuurou walked through the woods. It wasn\u2019t long before he reached Kuonji Mansion, bathed in the evening sun.</p><p>\u201CI\u2019m home.\u201D He opened the front door with a vigor-less greeting.</p><p>\u201CWelcome home. Is the reason for your depressed face that you couldn\u2019t find what you were looking for?\u201D</p><p>\u201CAlice\u2026?\u201D Had she been waiting for Soujuurou, or did she just happen to be going past at the time? Regardless, Kuonji Alice was standing alone in the lobby. She was holding onto a red box. Inside were twenty-four chocolates, a witch&#39;s playthings.</p><p>\u201CDon\u2019t tell anyone, but long ago, Touko-san said this. \u2018Oh my, it seems my little sister has gotten obsessed with love. She\u2019s still in elementary school, yet she\u2019s even asking how to get engaged.\u2019 or something or other.\u201D It wasn\u2019t an act. Alice said this in a tremendously monotone voice that would make you think of the millennia old tree on Yakushima Island. While he didn\u2019t know Alice\u2019s motives, after seeing the box in hands, Soujuurou could guess the situation. Let\u2019s be careful of things overhead.</p><p>\u201CWho was it?\u201D</p><p>\u201C...I haven\u2019t heard that much. However, you know that when Touko-san was living at the Aozaki house, she had a senior apprentice. They would travel to the Aozaki\u2019s house each day, and worked as Aoko\u2019s private tutor as well.\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2014\u2014\u2014\u201D Ah, of course, Soujuurou bit his lip. ...That\u2019s right. Since he first heard about this first love, somewhere in his heart he had already realized. A person that Aozaki Aoko knew well before she became a mage, someone who watched over her. Attractive and dressed in black, they even asked if Aoko wanted to run away together. \u201CI thought I was finished, but something\u2019s come up. Thanks Alice, I\u2019m just going to see Father Eiri for a bit.\u201D</p><p>\u201CDon\u2019t worry about it. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good thing to pry into the past, but I understand how you feel, so\u2014\u2014 Father, Eiri?\u201D</p><p>Soujuurou dashed out the door as Alice reached out in an attempt to stop him. But Soujuurou\u2019s speed was that of an arrow, and before Alice could call out, he disappeared into the sunset.</p><p>\u201C...How hasty.\u201D</p><p>Alice let out a gloomy sigh. A chirping came from her shoulder, as a blue robin landed there. \u201CAlice-san, whatcha up to down here? Who was on the phone?\u201D</p><p>At the bird\u2019s chirping, Alice said \u201COh.\u201D and covered her eyes apologetically. \u201COh no. There was a call from the student council secretary, and Aoko rushed out straight afterwards\u2026 Oh, and I forgot to tell Shizuki-kun about the most important part.\u201D</p><p>\u201CAnd on purpose as always. That\u2019s Alice-san for you!\u201D Instantly the girl\u2019s open palm swung around. With a \u2018boing\u2019 sound, the blue bouncy ball whizzed around the lobby.</p><p>After running to the caf\xE9, Soujuurou found Mino and Ichigozuka still inside. It looked like they had finished their meal, and were relaxing with some tea. It was lucky that Ichigozuka believed dinner should be a relaxing experience.</p><p>\u201CWhat\u2019s wrong, Shizuki? It seems like you went home then immediately came back here.\u201D</p><p>\u201COh? Does that mean that you couldn\u2019t resist the temptation of a meal? I wouldn\u2019t have expected any less from you, Soujuurou-kun.\u201D</p><p>\u201CMino-senpai, today\u2019s investigation isn\u2019t over yet. I\u2019ve learned some new information. Aozaki\u2019s first love, is at Aida Church.\u201D While still catching his breath from running here, Soujuurou got straight to business.</p><p>\u201CHmm\u201D Captain Mino\u2019s dignified gaze narrowed.</p><p>\u201CWhat?\u201D Ichigozuka\u2019s aloof aura suddenly changed. \u201CIs that true?\u201D</p><p>\u201CFrom what I\u2019ve heard, Aozaki\u2019s first love was a private tutor. And at the time, a young man from Aida Church was visiting the Aozaki\u2019s house regularly.\u201D Soujuurou explained this, hiding the fact that the private tutor was also there as mage\u2019s apprentice.</p><p>\u201CI see\u2026 So we gave up about five hours too early then.\u201D Mino lowered his school cap as he stood up. \u201CLet\u2019s head to the church. Regardless of what kind of person her first love is, I want to find out whether they\u2019re still dating.\u201D</p><p>\u201CIchigozuka-san, please get your car ready. We need to get there quickly, before the church closes.\u201D</p><p>In front of the two who could barely control their eagerness, Ichigozuka looked flustered. Actually, it looked more like he was about to run away. \u201CWai- Wait, please. I really can\u2019t hang around with you guys anymore, like I\u2019m busy with work, you know.\u201D</p><p>\u201CYou\u2019ve already said that was from tomorrow. Ichigozuka-san, we\u2019re counting on you.\u201D</p><p>\u201CYou just need to drive us there. It\u2019ll only take a few minutes.\u201D</p><p>The two youthful students leaned forward vigorously. Ichigozuka had nowhere to run. He was basically their captive. \u201C...Argh, fine. But it\u2019s already seven. If the church is closed, we\u2019ll be going straight home.\u201D Of course, the two replied immediately.</p><p>\u201CWell, I guess this\u2019ll be the final test of my luck.\u201D thought Ichigozuka as he pulled himself together, and ferried the young men to their destination.</p><p>Perhaps as a gift for Mino\u2019s everyday good deeds, the Church hadn\u2019t been closed yet. There was light coming from the chapel, and the front gate was still open. Sister Yuika wasn\u2019t in the chapel, but in her place was the leader of the church, Father Fumizuka Eiri. As if he had been expecting Soujuurou and the others, the black robed priest smiled. \u201CNow this is an unusual combination. I\u2019m happy to see you\u2019re doing well, Captain Mino.\u201D It seems like Father Eiri knew not just Soujuurou, but Mino and Ichigozuka as well. As to be expected of a priest who left the church work to a Sister and would frequently walk around Misaki Town. He was well connected.</p><p>\u201CMy apologies, Father Fumizuka. Today I\u2019m here regarding the school, but for personal reasons.\u201D Walking brazenly through the rows of pews, Mino confronted the Father in the middle of the chapel. For the Father, this was just a normal consultation, but for Mino this was the final play of the game. The harsh expression on his face was something unavoidable for a man standing before his rival in love.</p><p>\u201C...Hm, you don\u2019t seem very relaxed. Now that I think about it, I\u2019ve never talked about anything personal with you before. It\u2019s a good opportunity, go ahead and ask whatever you want. Well, It\u2019s almost certainly going to be about Aoko though.\u201D Fumizuka Eiri was a man to be feared. Just seeing the determination in Mino Yoshitsune\u2019s eyes, and the faces of Soujuurou and Ichigozuka standing silently behind him, he was already quite sure of the situation.</p><p>\u201C\u2014\u2014\u2014\u201D The tension was so thick you could choke on it. Sparks flew between the white and black cloaked men. Ichigozuka held his breath as he watched the two from the door, waiting for one of them to make the first move. It wouldn\u2019t seem strange if they crossed blades right here. Perhaps Soujuurou didn\u2019t want to get too close to the priest, as he was making sure to stay at least three paces away, watching things from between Mino and Ichigozuka. They were all lined up from the altar to the entrance, starting with the Father, then Mino, Soujuurou, Ichigozuka, and finally the door.</p><p>\u201CSenpai.\u201D Soujuurou called out to Mino\u2019s from behind, who was watching the priest closely. If you can\u2019t say it then I will, was what he implied, urging Mino on.</p><p>\u201CI know. Intimidation won\u2019t work on Father Eiri. ...Father. It may be inconsiderate to ask this, or even seem like the question of an honest fool. Are you currently in a relationship with Aozaki?\u201D<br> \u201COf course. It\u2019s been over six years, after all. It\u2019s not a relationship you can cut off that easily.\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2014\u2014\u2014. Did you also betray her horribly?\u201D</p><p>\u201CIf you consider playing havoc with her destiny, then yes, I guess I have some responsibility for that.\u201D</p><p>\u201CAnd how does Aozaki feel after all that?\u201D</p><p>\u201CIn the end, It\u2019s already been done. It\u2019s not like holding a grudge would change anything. From her point of view, it\u2019s a situation where all she could do is cry herself to sleep.\u201D</p><p>Mino collapsing to his knees\u2014\u2014\u2014 was something he showed no indication of doing. \u201CI see. I\u2019ve heard plenty.\u201D The manliness in those words was truly that of he who had led the cheer squad for two years. The conversation with the priest had revealed a likely hopeless situation for Mino. Just like the unconfirmed information said, Aoko was betrayed horribly by the one who was her first love, yet despite that they still had a relationship. Just looking at that, it would seem Aoko was madly in love.</p><p>But Mino had promised to himself. If Aozaki was currently in a relationship with him, and was happy, then Mino\u2019s confession would be nothing but a bother. He wouldn\u2019t intrude. But it\u2019s a different story if the relationship didn\u2019t seem to be a happy one. As a man, all that was left was to fight it out with that first love.</p><p>\u201CI apologize for disturbing you at such a late hour. It seems like the two of us will have another confrontation before too long. Excuse me.\u201D he said, turning around, with his cloak fluttering behind him.</p><p>Father Eiri called out to his turned back \u201C Ummm. It seems that you\u2019re misunderstanding, so I\u2019ll say it clearly. I\u2019m not Aoko\u2019s first love, and I\u2019m not a beast who gets aroused just because someone is of the opposite sex either, right?\u201D</p><p>\u201CWait?\u201D</p><p>\u201CWhat?\u201D</p><p>Both Mino and Soujuurou were lost for words.</p><p>This wasn\u2019t something that he couldn\u2019t ignore, Soujuurou thought. Taking a step forward, he began questioning the priest. \u201CThat can\u2019t be. You were an apprentice at Aozaki\u2019s place, weren\u2019t you? And then according to Alice, Aozaki\u2019s first love was an older apprentice.\u201D</p><p>\u201CAh, that\u2019s where you\u2019ve gotten confused. Soujuurou-kun, my relationship with Aoko\u2019s grandfather was that of friends. I wasn\u2019t his pupil.\u201D In the first place, it\u2019s taboo for a clergyman to learn magecraft, Father Eiri conveyed with his eyes. With Mino present, they couldn\u2019t talk about magecraft, after all.</p><p>\u201CThen, what about going to the Aozaki\u2019s house everyday?\u201D</p><p>\u201CAs part of my swordsmanship training, I was climbing the mountain every day.\u201D</p><p>A faint dizziness came over Soujuurou. Their investigation had returned to the starting point. Even the perseverant Soujuurou couldn\u2019t help but feel it had all led to nothing.</p><p>\u201CNo, It may be a bit too early for you to give up. I may not be the one, but it\u2019s true that there was someone traveling to the Aozaki\u2019s house as an apprentice. I know that they learned together with Touko-san, and also tutored Aoko when they had time to spare.\u201D Someone cleared their throat behind him, but in his urgency, that sound didn\u2019t enter Soujuurou\u2019s consciousness. \u201CThen, who is it?\u201D Soujuurou\u2019s direct question, and Mino\u2019s truth-demanding gaze were thrust towards the priest. Father Eiri\u2019s mouth twisted into a grin.</p><p>\u201CIt was Ritsuka.\u201D It was someone the two of them had never expected, a name completely unrelated.</p><p>\u201C\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026, huh?\u201D</p><p>\u201CAs I was saying, Ritsuka was the one who traveled to the Aozaki\u2019s house as an apprentice. You probably know this already, Soujuurou-kun, but at the time, Touko-san was the favorite child. People said that it was certain she would be the next in line. The one who was sent by the association as a supervisor and assessor was Ritsuka. Supposedly it was an easy decision, since this was Ritsuka\u2019s hometown.\u201D</p><p>\u201C...I\u2019m sorry. Can we go over that again, Father? When you say Ritsuka, do you mean the one famous in the shopping district, who doesn\u2019t work, and no one knows what she does, however she happily window shops at the clothing stores every day, that vague and fuzzy Miss Suse Ritsuka?\u201D</p><p>\u201CYes. The fuzzy one. I confess, Aoko\u2019s first love wasn\u2019t me, but Ritsuka.\u201D</p><p>\u201CBut, Miss Ritsuka is a woman\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u201D</p><p>\u201CThat she is. But what of it?\u201D</p><p>What of it? What of it? What of it?</p><p>With the priest\u2019s cruel answer, The captain of the cheer squad\u2019s head was spinning. Soujuurou could clearly hear the sound of his heart breaking. With a thud, Mino Yoshitsune\u2019s legs gave way and he fell to his knees. ...The chapel fell into an unpleasant silence, which must have lasted for a whole minute.</p><p>Slowly, the man clothed in a white cloak stood up between the rows of benches. \u201C...I\u2019m sorry for disturbing you. I\u2019d be thankful if you would keep tonight&#39;s events private.\u201D</p><p>\u201COf course. I\u2019m not that merciless.\u201D</p><p>The handsome young man turned his back to the priest, walking towards the door, unsteady with anguish.</p><p>\u201CSenpai? Are you fine with this?\u201D</p><p>\u201C...I can\u2019t interfere with another&#39;s romance. If that&#39;s what Aozaki seeks in love, then it isn\u2019t my\u2026 No, it isn\u2019t a man\u2019s business to interfere.\u201D</p><p>\u201C???\u201D Soujuurou couldn\u2019t at all understand what Mino had said. When he had heard that Ritsuka was Aoko\u2019s first love, they were surprised at very different things. Who knows when Soujuurou would learn of the term homosexuality.</p><p>Even forgetting to thank Ichigozuka, Mino left the chapel alone.</p><p>\u201CWell, that was a shocking end. Maybe I should have gone a bit easier on you, Yoshitsune-kun.\u201D said Ichigozuka as he watched Mino leave, nodding guiltily .</p><p>\u201C...Mm. Ichigozuka-san. Mino senpai\u2019s expression made it look like the world had ended. Why is that?\u201D</p><p>\u201CIf you don\u2019t know then don\u2019t worry about it. Anyway, we\u2019re finished here. With this the case is closed. So we should go home too, Soujuurou-kun.\u201D Not taking a step away from the entrance, Ichigozuka called Soujuurou over.<br> With the smile of a saint, Father Eiri called out to Ichigozuka. \u201CAh, please wait Soujuurou, and you as well. Actually, there\u2019s someone I wish to introduce to you as well. Please, come in.\u201D</p><p>\u201CPardon?\u201D</p><p>The door next to the altar opened, which led to the residential quarters. The one who appeared was a long haired, blue-eyed, seventeen-year old girl. One who had a sweet outward appearance, but on the inside physically emanated older sister aura.</p><p>\u201CThe case hasn\u2019t been closed yet. You guys seem to have been having quite the interesting conversation.\u201D That is, no matter which way you look at it, it was our dependable student council president, Aozaki Aoko.</p><p>\u201CUgh, Aozaki!\u201D</p><p>\u201C!!!!\u201D</p><p>What do you mean, &#39;ugh&#39;. However, Soujuurou\u2019s reaction wasn\u2019t unreasonable. He was investigating Aoko\u2019s first love while keeping it a secret from her. If it were found out, he would inevitably end up with the same fate as Kinomi Housuke. It was like his limbs were going numb from the shivering.</p><p>\u201CYou, stay where you are. If I see even an indication of you trying to run, not even I know what\u2019s going to happen.\u201D Not hiding her rage at all, Aoko rolled up her sleeves as she strode over. Her harrowing presence was easily three times as strong as it was at the amusement park.</p><p>While preparing himself for death, Soujuurou said \u201CPlease wait for a moment. I understand your reasoning, but is it really that big of a deal!?\u201D Somehow, in a desperate attempt to stop Aoko, Soujuurou managed to raise his objection.</p><p>However. \u201CNot you, the one back there!\u201D Aoko\u2019s target wasn\u2019t Soujuurou, but the young man breaking out into a cold sweat next to the entrance, Ichigozuka.</p><p>\u201C...Not me?\u201D</p><p>\u201COf course I\u2019ll still be having a nice long talk with you later, Shizuki-kun, but at the moment there\u2019s someone who\u2019s an even bigger problem. Now, let\u2019s hear it. Why would you, the culprit, be deliberately going around with Mino-senpai, Ritsuka!\u201D</p><p>\u201C!?\u201D Upon hearing the name \u2018Ritsuka\u2019, Soujuurou reflexively turned around. Of course, Ichigozuka was the only one behind him. \u201CRitsuka-san? ...You mean Ichigozuka-san is!?\u201D</p><p>\u201CAh, ahahaha\u2026 Um, how should I put this, I wasn\u2019t really deceiving you\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 Well, I guess the game\u2019s up.\u201D Ichigozuka laughed frivolously to hide his embarrassment. Aoko continued silently walking towards him. Making her way past Soujuurou, her right hand was lifted up to her chest. She was ready to release a full powered right straight. \u201CWait Ako-chan, It\u2019s a misunderstanding. This time, I didn\u2019t really do anything!\u201D</p><p>\u201CCan someone explain! I have no idea what\u2019s going on anymore!\u201D</p><p>\u201CAh, I never did tell you about this, Soujuurou-kun. Ritsuka is from the Mage\u2019s Association, working in espionage and intelligence. Her specialty is disguise. She can even change her skeletal and muscle structure. At the time she pretended that the female and male Ritsuka\u2019s were an older sister and younger brother, and became an apprentice to the Aozaki family. Even though there was no need to do anything more at the time, she was tutoring Aoko. And the result was\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 Of all things, Aoko, who was in elementary school at the time, ended up falling in love for the first time with the young man Ritsuka had disguised herself as, is how the story goes.\u201D</p><p>\u201CNo way\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 So Aozaki\u2019s first love was even a misunderstanding!\u201D With that stupendous truth, Soujuurou went straight past laughing and was just impressed. Aoko\u2019s temples twitched upon hearing that reaction, as she closed in on Ichigozuka \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014Suse Ritsuka.</p><p>\u201CI may as well ask before I kill you. Hey Ritsuka. Why would you purposely disguise yourself as a man to follow Soujuurou and Mino-senpai?\u201D This was the last chance for an explanation.</p><p>Looking up at Aoko from below, Ritsuka laughed awkwardly. \u201CHaha. I thought it would be funny, so it just kind of happened.\u201D</p><p>\u201CI shouldn\u2019t have expected anything else from you\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014!\u201D</p><p>The sound of a full force punch echoed through the chapel. Ichigozuka flew through the air as if in slow motion, before crashing down to the hard stone floor.</p><h2 id="_5" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_5" aria-hidden="true">#</a> 5/</h2><hr><hr><p>\u25C6</p><p>On the top of a mountain far away from civilization\u2026 would be an exaggeration, but halfway up a mountain quite a distance from town, stood the house of a young girl. Her family was her mother and her father, her sister 4 years her elder, and herself. You couldn\u2019t say that it was a normal family you would find anywhere, but it was a loving home. Apparently the girl\u2019s mother and father married after being in love for a long time. Whether her father was weak-willed, or just patient, she did not know. It\u2019s just that there was no dramatic event. The girl did not inherit the family leadership. At the time, their father had washed his hands of the family business by getting married, or so the girl and her older sister were told, but the truth was a little different.</p><p>The girl\u2019s father met her mother in the first year of high school, and on the day he met her, he went to his father\u2019s den, and said \u201CIt\u2019s a different era now, and it never suited me in the first place. Either try someone else, or abandon it now.\u201D It seems he said that straight to his father\u2019s face. When the girl heard of that, she respected her father more than ever, however, it was a long time before that happened. The girl\u2019s father was of average talent, but there was one conviction he had that could quiet her grandfather. That he loved her mother more than anything in the whole world, just that simple, commonplace conviction. Upon meeting his lifelong partner, he threw out hundreds of years of tradition without hesitation.</p><p>\u201CThen the role will fall upon your children, are you fine with that?\u201D</p><p>\u201CWhether I accept it or run from it, I\u2019m sure the role will fall to them. If my children decide to follow on with the family business, then as a parent I will of course support them. Well, not that a good-for-nothing like me would be able to have children.\u201D</p><p>However, he was blessed with children. The first born was the older sister, whose abilities were noticed even before she was born. \u201CThis child is a prodigy only seen once in a hundred years.\u201D Receiving that blessing from the organization, the father was a little bit troubled. He refused to continue on the family business, since he wasn\u2019t suited for it, but lamenting over the irony of his daughter having that talent\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 He was most certainly not.</p><p>\u201CThis is a problem. She\u2019s going to take a lot of money. Even just her education will be ten times that of a normal person.\u201D Since he had calmly accepted his daughters talent, he just let out a sigh at the difficulties of preparing an environment suitable for that talent. Seven years later. It\u2019s unclear what questionnaires were filled out, but the older sister made the choice to succeed the grandfather of her own will. As a result, many private tutors of unknown nationality came and went from the house.</p><p>By the way, the prodigy\u2019s little sister also showed a little bit of a glimpse of that talent. However, compared to her older sister, it was like a rare steak and a pre-packaged hamburger, a disappointment, in other words. As long as her older sister was the successor, the girl couldn\u2019t take over the family business. \u201CMy sister was chosen, and I wasn\u2019t.\u201D It was a cruel truth, but that didn\u2019t cause the girl to feel inferiority or envy. Rather, she felt lucky. She could live her life carefree and enjoy herself. However, in the depths of her heart, she might have held a little bit of a grudge against her sister. A few years after the girl had entered elementary school. A private tutor came to their house, completely different from any who had come before.</p><p>\u201CThe private tutors will be twins this time. They\u2019re the pupils of my previous teacher. ...It\u2019s a little complicated, but I guess they\u2019d be my senior pupils. It seems like the older brother\u2019s going to come along and help with the housework. If you think it\u2019s a pain having to go to cram school, then why don\u2019t you get him to teach you?\u201D</p><p>That was where the girl first met the Suse sisters. Well it was more like when she first met Suse Ritsuka. For certain reasons, Ritsuka had come to the girl&#39;s house to investigate, acting as both roles. You could say she was a spy. At this time, the real Yuika had yet to begin working in Misaki Town. Ritsuka presented her real self as Yuika, and her male disguise as the younger brother Ritsuka. The younger brother who appeared calling himself Suse Ritsuka didn\u2019t have that characteristic gloominess. He was a kind and easygoing, likable young man. As a university student who had come from the city, Ritsuka was the first stranger who the girl found easy to talk to and could rely on.</p><p>\u201CHey Ritsuka. Why don\u2019t you ever go to study with Touko?\u201D</p><p>\u201CThat\u2019s my sister\u2019s role. It\u2019s a lot more fun spending time lounging around here with you, Ako-chan. Or rather, I don\u2019t want to do anything too troublesome.\u201D</p><p>From the way Ritsuka talked, the girl, as young as she was, could see through to his\u2026 or more correctly her, core. While seemed good, both on the outside and the inside, once you spend time with him, it became clear he was the lazy type. He was an incredibly amiable young man, and yet at his core he was a hopelessly undisciplined slacker.</p><p>\u201CYou really are a creature born to turn girls into your victims. Do you have any intentions of fixing that or anything?\u201D</p><p>\u201CAm I really that bad? Then I\u2019ll go to the chiropractor sometime. It\u2019d be good if it was yoga style. They say fixing your physique will straighten out your personality as well, don\u2019t they?\u201D</p><p>\u201CNo way, just straightening you out would be way too soft. Rather than getting someone to play with your spine, you should go straight to the hospital. Since you need your whole central nervous system replaced.\u201D</p><p>\u201CThat\u2019s horrible! But it\u2019s also true! I\u2019m scared of what you\u2019re going to become, Ako-chan!\u201D</p><p>Perhaps Ritsuka\u2019s excessive uselessness flicked a switch in her, or perhaps it was just something like the measles. For whatever reason the girl trusted Ritsuka, held admiration for his approach to life, and in the end she mistook that for love. It was a mistake the girl regretted, so much that she would want to alter the Akashic Records.</p><p>And then, the fiery red autumn came to an end. When the girl learned that the Suse siblings would be leaving in two months&#39; time, she demonstrated ample amounts of her inherent rationality and decisiveness.</p><p>\u201CYuika-san, I have a question. What do I need to do to get married to Ritsuka-san?\u201D Having been asked that, Ritsuka\u2019s older sister, Yuika exploded with laughter, as if she had heard the world\u2019s funniest joke. It was completely incomprehensible. This is why I can\u2019t stand anyone related to magecraft, the girl thought as she looked at Yuika like she would a pig.</p><p>The girl carefully formed her plan. The girl&#39;s conviction to absolutely win if she was going to do it, to win even if it killed her opponent, applied to her romance as well. She would confess on the last day before the Suse siblings left. There could be no better situation to force a reply while his retreat was cut off. Even though she was only in her final year of elementary school, her thought patterns were like a devil. However, the girl had fatefully bad luck. The girl had yet to learn that no matter how perfect her plans were, they were fated to tumble in a strange direction.</p><p>The first tragedy was that to achieve her mission, she asked for the older sister Yuika\u2019s cooperation. Under the condition that she would keep it a secret from Ritsuka, The girl asked Yuika about various things, and in the end even opened up to her with girl\u2019s talk. Right until the end, she never realized the reason why Yuika would cover her mouth every time she talked reservedly about her dreams.</p><p>And at last the long awaited day of the confession arrived. On the night that the moon looked the most beautiful over the mountains, Aoko called Ritsuka out, and confessed her love.</p><p>\u201CIn six years time, I, with my magnanimity and gracefulness, will, in place of my husband, go out into the world and demonstrate my usefulness, and in the future I will become a woman who earns at least seven figures. Ritsuka. How will you pass these six years? If you have no prospects, shall I ask Touko to put you in suspended animation while you wait?\u201D</p><p>It was the perfect confession. If he waited for just six years, he could get the perfect wife. Of course he would wait, right? Or rather, it was a super aggressive warning that in six years, memories, or even life can be lost.</p><p>However, the second tragedy was now revealed. \u201COh? You\u2019re still in disguise, Ritsuka? It\u2019s the last day, so you\u2019ve got no need to disguise yourself as a man. Alright, I\u2019ll remove the transformation.\u201D</p><p>\u201CUgh.\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2014\u2014What?\u201D</p><p>The carefree older sister appeared, trotting over to where the confession happened. For the girl who had chosen the porch for the confession because of its good view, well, it was a bit of a blunder. The older sister had just gotten out of the bath, and while drinking milk with a bath towel wrapped around her neck, she snapped her fingers. And with that sound, Cinderella&#39;s magic dissolved. Ritsuka\u2019s body, which until now had been that of a young man, returned to its original female form.</p><p>\u201CWh, wh, wh\u2014\u2014\u201D The girl\u2019s face turned bright red, and her fists began to shake. For the intelligent girl, it took only two seconds to understand the truth. At the same time it was a part of her dark history, that raged through her head like a tempest. Even if she hadn\u2019t known it, she had asked the person she was going to confess to \u2018What sort of things does he like?\u2019 Also, her first love was actually a woman in disguise!?</p><p>Seeing the girl\u2019s embarrassment was about to send her anger berserk, Ritsuka slowly backed away.</p><p>\u201C...Why, would you do this?\u201D</p><p>\u201CI\u2019m sorry, it was a secret mission. You know I wasn\u2019t trying to deceive you?\u201D</p><p>\u201C...That\u2019s not what I asked. When I went to Yuika for advice, why didn\u2019t you either show your true self, or lead the conversation towards me giving up, is what I\u2019m asking.\u201D</p><p>\u201COh, that? Mmm, I don\u2019t think there was much I could do about that. I know this is me saying it myself, but my disguise is perfect, right? I had the confidence that I wouldn\u2019t be found out until the end, you see? And you were obviously going to self-destruct, Ako-chan. Thinking about what was going to happen next, I just couldn\u2019t resist, I mean, It was hilarious, so I just kinda, you know. Eh-he\u2606\u201D Suse Ritsuka tapped herself on the head and stuck her tongue out as she apologized. Then the girl put her entire existence into a right straight, which exploded into Ritsuka\u2019s solar plexus.</p><p>\u201CI already knew it, but that woman is the worst.\u201D</p><p>That was the story of the girl who was betrayed by her first love. Going back from now, it would be around six years ago now.</p><p>\u25C6</p><p>\u201C...Uhh, I\u2019ve remembered something awful\u2026\u201D Her body shaking, Aoko fixed up the scarf around her neck. Even though it was early spring, the early morning atmosphere was still plenty cold enough. Right now, it was twelve past six in the morning. The dimly lit sky was beginning to grow white beyond the forest of buildings surrounding the bus stop. Aoko was waiting for him. In the morning fog that covered the town on Misaki hill, not another person could be seen. It was still ten minutes before the first bus. It must be about time, she thought as she looked down at her watch. Just as she expected, a figure appeared from the fog covered intersection, headed towards the bus stop.</p><p>A height that drew the eyes, a white cloak and a white school cap. Mino Yoshitsune arrived at the bus stop, walking his bike with a travel bag hanging from it. Thinking it\u2019s odd that someone else was there already, his eyes opened wide upon realizing that it was the kouhai he held deep affection for. However, that was just for a moment. The expression in Mino\u2019s eyes turned from surprised, to calm, and warm. Of course she would go that far, he thought. She was dependable, like it was her own problem. Accepting that proudly, Mino Yoshitsune called out to her like normal. \u201CHey. Morning, Aozaki.\u201D</p><p>\u201CGood morning, Mino-senpai. I realize that it may be an inconvenience, but I\u2019ve come to send you off.\u201D</p><p>\u201CToday\u2019s the first day of the end of year exams. You must be pretty confident.\u201D</p><p>\u201CYes. That\u2019s why after I see you off, I\u2019ll head to school and cram. As the student council president, I need to make sure that I get above average marks.\u201D</p><p>Ahhh, Aoko laughed.</p><p>I see, Mino returned a grimace.</p><p>While the story was now over, Mino\u2019s misunderstanding had already been resolved last night. After being scolded by Aoko, Soujuurou had called Mino to explain the situation. During the call, Mino had asked Soujuurou \u201CDid you call me up because you were asked by Aozaki?\u201D</p><p>Soujuurou replied immediately. From the start, Aoko had said \u201CIf Mino-senpai asks whether I asked you to call him, say that I did.\u2019 Upon hearing that, Mino Yoshitsune correctly understood Aoko\u2019s feelings. Although she had probably heard the details of what happened from Soujuurou, Aoko had set the situation back to its starting point. To a blank sheet of paper.</p><p>Who to, and for what reasons he confesses. That choice, that action belongs to Mino Yoshitsune. Even if Aoko\u2019s answer is already decided, she would not say that until after Mino had made his choice. Aoko would have hated it if her interruption had twisted Mino\u2019s choice. Understanding that fairness, Mino smiled to himself while holding the receiver, and found his answer to his feelings from the last two years. \u2026 ...He looked back at those times fondly. That\u2019s right. If it were possible, he would have liked to continue his school life with Aozaki Aoko forever.</p><p>At that point he should have realized the truth behind his emotions. Thinking that there was no choice to confess since the time limit was here. That thought showed that he had been mistaken about something. What he had fallen for was the \u2018pleasant way of life\u2019 that Aozaki Aoko demonstrated, but he didn\u2019t attempt to understand her any deeper than that. He dreamed that Aozaki Aoko should just stay as that. I just wanted to continue studying together with that girl, was what he had selfishly thought. That wasn\u2019t love towards another person. It was nothing more than a yearning for his own youth. Whatever others might think, that was the conclusion Mino Yoshitsune came to.</p><p>That\u2019s why he decided to strongly, thoroughly put the lid on his own feelings until the very end. In his own way, that was Mino Yoshitsune\u2019s thanks to Aozaki Aoko over these last two years.</p><p>\u201CBut I\u2019m surprised that you knew it was today. I hadn\u2019t told anyone but the teachers.\u201D</p><p>\u201COf course I knew. After all Senpai, you left the preparations for the graduation ceremony up to the rest of the cheer squad, right? Ah, so you\u2019re not going to be here on that day, I thought.\u201D</p><p>\u201CSo that was it. Is the vice-leader\u2026 No, the leader, managing with everything?\u201D</p><p>\u201CSomehow. But He respects you so much that he ended up saying that he ended up saying it\u2019s too difficult for him, that he wants to quit.\u201D</p><p>\u201CThe fool. The role of leader is too much for anyone. Finding a way through that difficulty is the leader&#39;s first job. Tell him that for me.\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2014\u2014Understood. You know, that\u2019s quite a wise saying.\u201D</p><p>The two of them talked as if nothing had happened, still keeping the same distance between them as always. It was almost as if they would return to the same school life as always afterwards. From far off came the drum like sounds of an engine. From within the morning fog, a dull light approached.</p><p>\u201CThe bus is coming. It\u2019s about time.\u201D</p><p>\u201CSure is. Senpai, what university are you going to? If it\u2019s not too far away, I\u2019ll come visit on summer break or something.\u201D</p><p>\u201CNo, that would be a bit difficult. I\u2019m not just going to university, but I\u2019m studying abroad. I\u2019m going to Cornell University in New York. I wanted to study genetic engineering, you see.\u201D Upon seeing Aoko\u2019s eyes open wide, Mino began scratching his nose out of embarrassment. Aoko had no way of knowing that just that expression would become encouragement for the adversity that was awaiting Mino.</p><p>\u201CCongratulations, Senpai. You are really smart, after all.\u201D She smiled, wishing him well from the bottom of her heart.</p><p>\u201CThank you. It\u2019s unfortunate that I don\u2019t have your courage or quick wit, however.\u201D</p><p>The bus came to a stop. The door opened. Hiss, it went. It was almost as if it was urging the passengers to hurry up and get on. The engine was idling. The driver sleepily stifled a yawn. The time until departure was three minutes, plus how long it took him to resolve to say goodbye.</p><p>\u201CBut even though you\u2019re going so far away, you\u2019re still wearing that cloak.\u201D</p><p>\u201CYes. At first it was rather embarrassing, but now I can\u2019t feel relaxed without it. Do you remember? That time you-\u201D</p><p>\u201CYes. That was the very first unreasonable demand that I pushed onto you.\u201D</p><p>Mino replied to Aoko\u2019s cheerful smile, with a smile of acknowledgement. Just after he had taken over the role of leader, he was planning to quit, thinking that he couldn\u2019t do it. Then the new student council president came and forced this cloak onto him. \u2018Everything starts from the outward appearance. Please wear this Senpai. It\u2019s definitely going to suit you.\u2019 Mino had been with this garment ever since. It was like a statement of his determination. As long as he was wearing it, he didn\u2019t have room to make any complaints. Those around him also placed high expectations and hopes onto Mino Yoshitsune and his fluttering white cloak. In that case, I\u2019ve got no choice but to grin and bear it, was how Mino motivated himself. And most of all. He was happy that the color she had chosen for him was white.</p><p>The president and leader\u2019s joint work was all like this, a series of extravagant accomplishments. A brilliant youth. Looking back on it after it was over, those wonderful days really had gone at the speed of light.</p><p>\u201C\u2014\u2014Oh man, I think I might cry.\u201D</p><p>\u201CWhat are you saying? Tears wouldn\u2019t suit you, Senpai.\u201D</p><p>The horn sounded. The bus driver changed the gear from neutral into first.</p><p>\u201CSenpai, Is it alright if I apologize for one thing?\u201D Her cheerfulness from before was gone, as Aoko\u2019s expression had clouded over.</p><p>\u201CApologize? For what?\u201D</p><p>\u201CYou know, the cloak and stuff. I was always pushing you beyond your limits. I might have completely messed up your high school life.\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u201D He purposely didn\u2019t ask why Aoko might have thought that. What flew into his heart was nothing but the feeling of admiration for the kohai in front of him. Aoko understood Mino Yoshitsune\u2019s character well. She completely understood that he was a person who would feel more at ease in a laboratory than in the cheer squad. Understanding that, she trusted Mino, using him effectively. It\u2019s no surprise that she would feel indebted to him. However\u2014\u2014</p><p>\u201CNo, not at all.\u201D He took off his school cap. Without letting his emotions get the best of him, Mino Yoshitsune stared straight at the kohai he had yearned for over the last two years. \u201CMy school life was perfect. \u2014\u2014I had good senpai, and good kohai.\u201D</p><p>Mino had a thought. A school isn\u2019t the building. The real studying would start from here on, until his last breath. These three years would come to color the rest of his life. Being in contact with people who, living by their own nature, you would never have a chance nor a reason to meet. An extraordinary place reserved only for the young, where they can spend time together with people who they wouldn\u2019t have any contact with in life otherwise. That\u2019s what sort of time high school is, he thought.</p><p>\u201CYou still have a year left. I\u2019m a little bit jealous of Shizuki-kun.\u201D</p><p>\u201CWh- why are you bringing him up now?\u201D</p><p>\u201CI wanted to get one up on you at least once before the end. I\u2019ll be off then. Stay well.\u201D Mino put his feet onto the step. The driver stepped on the clutch.</p><p>\u201CYou take care too, Senpai! If you become famous, I\u2019ll come sponge off you!\u201D</p><p>The door shut. She waved her hand.</p><p>The morning sun had already risen to halfway up the buildings. The bus took the graduating student away to a faraway country, bathed in the morning sun.</p><p>\u2026...that was how it happened. The adventure of first love had safely reached its destination, as the curtain fell, unnoticed.</p><h2 id="_4-5" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_4-5" aria-hidden="true">#</a> 4.5/</h2><hr><hr><p>Let\u2019s rewind the story a little bit.</p><p>\u25C6</p><p>\u201CNo then, we should head home too. Tomorrow\u2019s the finals, and you\u2019ve got a hellish all-nighter ahead of you.\u201D</p><p>The root of all evil, Suse Ritsuka fell before Aoko\u2019s right straight. Sister Yuika wasn\u2019t home, and Father Eiri was dealing with Ritsuka. So naturally, Aoko and Soujuurou were walking home together from the church, just the two of them.</p><p>\u201CDo you know why Ritsuka pretended to be a man? \u2018Boys\u2019 clothes look rather cool, don\u2019t they? Rough and smart and wild, they have a different appeal to girls&#39; clothes. Of course I would want to try wearing them, right?\u2019 is what she said. ...Well, I do understand that feeling a little.\u201D</p><p>\u201C... So it wasn\u2019t for her work, she was just doing such a strange thing as a hobby. \u2026 the city really is like another world.\u201D</p><p>As the two walked up the hill, they reflected on what had happened. After Aoko told him the truth about her first love, Soujuurou let out a deep breath as if a weight had lifted off his chest, before returning to his usual demeanor, where you could never quite tell what he was thinking.</p><p>\u201CBy the way. I\u2019m kind of curious, why did you stay quiet back then?\u201D</p><p>\u201CBack then?\u201D</p><p>\u201CWhen you spat out \u2018Do you have a boyfriend?\u2019 to me. At the start, you didn\u2019t say that it was a request from Mino-senpai, right? Isn\u2019t that not very like you?\u201D</p><p>\u201CDid that happen? Couldn\u2019t you just be imagining things?\u201D Soujuurou evaded the question really naturally and Aoko frowned at him. The reason Soujuurou couldn\u2019t answer that question, was that while it was a \u2018request from someone\u2019, it was also out of \u2018his own interest\u2019. At that time, Soujuurou\u2019s own feelings and Mino Yoshitsune\u2019s overlapped, and he felt that for some reason, he didn\u2019t want to tell that to Aoko. Or rather, he was pouting.</p><p>\u201C...Well, anyway. This is the main part. As the first question, Why did you accept Mino-senpai\u2019s request? That was the first time you had met him, right? And there was no benefit to you, either.\u201D</p><p>\u201CAt first it was just going with the flow. But then I got serious once you were brought up.\u201D</p><p>\u201CMe? Why though?\u201D</p><p>\u201CWell\u2014\u2014 I mean, it\u2019s an important problem, isn\u2019t it?\u201D Soujuurou replied, not looking at Aoko and pouting. Aoko suddenly stopped. Soujuurou walked ahead briskly, puffing up his cheeks slightly.</p><p>Aoko stared blankly at Soujuurou\u2019s back, \u201CWait, what do you mean by that?\u201D</p><p>Surprised, she let out that half-witted question, the likes of which she hadn\u2019t even heard from herself before.</p>', 494);
