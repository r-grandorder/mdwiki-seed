My hair...my evil...is shamelessly driveling...</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> If you do not wake up soon,<br> I may really eat you...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> (WHA...!?!?!?)</p><hr><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...Where am I...?</p><hr><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong><br> ...Hmph. So you have awoken.<br> That was a close call for you.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> There are scale marks on my cheek!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> There&#39;s a snake chewing on my finger!?</p><hr><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong><br> If you&#39;re disappointed that I spared your life rather than relieved...</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong><br> ...then tell me that you lament having missed the opportunity to merge with me and melt into sweet oblivion.</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong><br> It&#39;s not too late to speak up.<br> Don&#39;t you fret. I am always hungry.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Oh, no, no, no...no. Don&#39;t worry about me.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Oh, uh, thanks, but I&#39;m...fine...</p><hr><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong><br> Mmm. What...is this place?</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong><br> I just found myself here with you sleeping beside me. You&#39;re my Master. Do you know what is happening?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> This has happened to me a few times...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Probably a dream, or your unconscious or something...</p><hr><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong><br> ...? What do you mean? Explain more in detail.</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong><br> Hehe...hahahaha!<br> A dream. A dream? Of mine!? Oh you ARE funny...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> That&#39;s...funny?</p><hr><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong><br> Of course it is. Look around you.<br> See this cold, empty world.</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong><br> It&#39;s so dark... Not a mote of light to be seen,<br> nor a sign of life anywhere.</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong><br> Your lungs are filled with dark and ominous air.<br> What dread sights you can see are most sinister.</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong><br> The cold floor is damp, like a demon&#39;s entrails,<br> and eagerly awaits you to collapse and die...</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong><br> Its hideous walls stifle you,<br> waiting to close around you like a coffin.</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong><br> There is nothing at all good here. A true nightmare for any human. A being of pure despair and evil...that is what I am.</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong><br> Ah... This place is a true reflection of my nature...utterly monstrous!</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong><br> I certainly could not argue if you said this was a reflection of who I am within. All I can do is laugh at this! Hahahaha!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You&#39;re talking nonsense again...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Maybe there&#39;s a field of flowers over there...</p><hr><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong><br> ... I&#39;ve always wondered.<br> What do you think of me, truly?</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong><br> Now more than ever, you fail to understand my nature, which makes this a good opportunity to teach you.</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong><br> I am...evil. That is all.</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong><br> The third sister of a certain family, destined to become a monster. That is all I am.</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong><br> As my power goes beyond any mere common evil,<br> some may even call me the mother of Demonic Beasts.</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong><br> Yet you do not fear me... Why?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> We don&#39;t have any trouble communicating...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> You seem to understand what I say...</p><hr><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong><br> ...If communication is all you require, your bar is quite...low.</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong><br> And even that is only possible because, at this moment, I exist in a state between my forms as a goddess and monster.</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong><br> I honestly do not understand why I was summoned in this state...</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong><br> Let me make myself clear. I am not a goddess.<br> I am a monster. I am a divinity who turned evil.</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong><br> That&#39;s why you\u2013</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> What&#39;s that voice!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Something&#39;s coming!</p><hr><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong><br> Hah... I am the mother of Demonic Beasts. I devour even other evils. It would not surprise me to know there are a few lurking within me.</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong><br> At least it may be amusing to watch whatever hungry beasts lurk here devour you.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I&#39;d appreciate it if you&#39;d help me out...</p><hr><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong><br> Shut up. I don&#39;t care what you want.</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong><br> But... I have no intention of feeding the other evils that work within me in this dream of mine.</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong><br> Letting them feast on your flesh would be a waste.<br> Besides, I happen to feel like exercising just now.</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong><br> Consider yourself lucky.<br> You can cower before me once we finish here.</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong><br> Now, look upon my form and learn...</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong><br> Learn that the being you thought you could merely talk with is a monster who will turn your stomach!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong><br> Hahaha...what do you think!?<br> Did you see my terrible serpent form!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Thanks! You saved me!</p><hr><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong><br> That&#39;s not what I&#39;m talking about!<br> That&#39;s not what you should be saying!</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong><br> You should be terrified! You should be soiling yourself! You should be begging me not to eat you!</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong><br> This is the time to beg for your life!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> So, I&#39;m thinking leaving would be a good idea...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I don&#39;t think we should stay long...</p><hr><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong><br> Ungh...<br> This human...is unbelievable...!</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong><br> Argh! Fine! So!?<br> Do you have any idea how to escape!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I don&#39;t, but let&#39;s just keep going.</p><hr><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong><br> Hmph. Are you saying we should simply head in that direction?</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong><br> The single, obvious way out in a place steeped in nothing but evil on all sides?</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong><br> I suspect that will only lead us to a hell far worse than the one we find ourselves in now.</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong><br> But you willingly walk headlong into peril...and you are even willing to peek into the underbelly of the hideous monster I am?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I&#39;m sure there are parts of yourself you don&#39;t want anyone seeing...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> We&#39;ve got to go that way to get out, sorry.</p><hr><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong><br> Silence. It seems you value neither your life nor your sanity.</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong><br> Perhaps you will realize what they were worth once you&#39;ve lost them. Hehe.</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong><br> Very well. I&#39;m intrigued.</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong><br> I shall watch your final moments and mock them to the very end. You may meet your end without fear. Hahaha.</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong><br> ...Hold it right there. Are you a fool?</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong><br> Did you not think that carelessly venturing out might mean your death? If you simply perished, I would be robbed of my chance to watch a demon devour you.</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong><br> Just stand behind me and follow me, scum.<br> Unbelievable...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> (She might get angry again if I thank her...)</p><hr><p><strong>--ARROW--:</strong></p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong><br> I can feel the evil presence growing stronger.<br> It certainly doesn&#39;t bother me, but you\u2013</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...?</p><hr><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong><br> Tsk. You&#39;re fine? Disappointing. Do you have no consideration for how your whimpering and looks of terror would keep me entertained on this dull journey?</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong><br> Don&#39;t you know?<br> Human suffering is my greatest pleasure.</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong><br> Seeing, hearing, and tasting human suffering are my favorite things to do...</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong><br> That terror, oh it makes me drool in anticipation. There is no better seasoning for my meal.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Is that because...you&#39;re an Avenger?</p><hr><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong><br> ...What a silly thing to say.</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong><br> That class was forced upon me when I was summoned as a Servant.</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong><br> But...you&#39;re probably right.<br> Your absurd question jogged my memory.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...Memory of what?</p><hr><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong><br> Rage!</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong><br> Yes...I may truly be an Avenger. The desire for revenge does indeed burn within my Spirit Origin.</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong><br> But...revenge against what?<br> Whatever is it that I hate so much?</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong><br> The unknown is what infuriates me, and it has led me to kill and devour all living things I encounter.</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong><br> That, at least, I find fulfilling, all the more so if the victim is someone I loathe.</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong><br> Heh...a monster who doesn&#39;t even know who deserves her vengeance...</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong><br> Of all the Heroic Spirits you employ,<br> I must be the most bizarre and horrible!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> That&#39;s not true...</p><hr><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong><br> Tsk. I&#39;ve said too much. Forget it.</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong><br> Either way, the stench of evil is getting stronger here. Something is bound to happ\u2013</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I-it got dark all of a sudden!</p><hr><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong><br> Quiet.</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong><br> Hmph. I can hardly see... Even my own eyes cannot see through...the darkness within me...</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong><br> ... Fine. For now...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> And something touched me!!!</p><hr><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong><br> I said keep quiet. That&#39;s just my hair.<br> Hold on to it and don&#39;t let go.</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong><br> If you annoy it, it may bite off a finger or two.<br> If you want to live, deal with it. Let&#39;s go.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> (I hope she&#39;s only kidding...)</p><hr><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong><br> ... There&#39;s something up ahead...</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong><br> ...! Is...that...</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong><br> My older sisters...</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong><br> And that&#39;s...</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong><br> Me!!!</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong><br> Wait. Stop. What are you doing?</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong><br> No...what are you...trying to show me!?</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong><br> ...!</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong><br> Ah, I see.</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong><br> So this is a dream to show me what might have been!!!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> What was that...?</p><hr><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong><br> ...Let me ask you.<br> What did you just see?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Uh...I don&#39;t know, it was all fuzzy...</p><hr><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong><br> I see. That&#39;s a relief.</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong><br> Even if you did see something or THINK you saw something, don&#39;t ask. I&#39;ll kill you if you do.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> But...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I can still see the other Gorgon.</p><hr><p><strong>???:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong><br> Hmph. I&#39;ll let that one slide.<br> That&#39;s only the \u201Cme\u201D I see in my dreams.</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong><br> And that...that is... Hahaha!<br> All the more reason to kill it!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You&#39;re going to kill it!?</p><hr><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong><br> Of course. That being is the center of the evil that has flooded this realm. My body...my every instinct...cries out for that thing&#39;s blood!</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong><br> (Instinct...that&#39;s right...instinct.)</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong><br> (If that is true...)</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong><br> (Is that what defines my existence? Is that how I will end up? Is it telling me to seek revenge...)</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong><br> (...against the humans and world that led me here...?)</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong><br> (Hehe...hahaha!!!)</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong><br> (Who cares? Even if that were true,<br> my purpose does not change. I am not wrong.)</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong><br> (I devour what I wish. I kill what I wish.<br> That is the essence of my very being!)</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong><br> Ah, of course. Of course. In the end...this is all monsters are able to do!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong><br> The darkness is starting to clear...<br> Hehehe... Oh, that was satisfying!</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong><br> And yet...that was no more than a shadow of my past and future. I know just how pointless it is.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ?</p><hr><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong><br> Hah! That vacant look...<br> I can see you do not understand. But I do.</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong><br> What would you call something that is both satisfying and completely pointless?</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong><br> ...Amusement.</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong><br> I had an amusing dream. If how I feel now is any indication...I would say it was a sweet dream.</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong><br> Let me reiterate: I am a monster.</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong><br> Killing that monster\u2013that other me\u2013and bathing in its blood was exhilarating. I found that dream...amusing.</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong><br> Knowing that...do you still want something like me in your Chaldea?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Of course.</p><hr><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong><br> Why? I&#39;ve told you time and time again, and you still don&#39;t get it!? I am no Heroic Spirit! I AM A MONSTER!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Whatever you are, you are here now.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> You answered my call...</p><hr><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong><br> ...You are mistaken.</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong><br> Even I do not know why I was summoned.<br> It must have been some kind of accident.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Even if it&#39;s an accident or a mistake, I&#39;m happy.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Thank you for coming to Chaldea.</p><hr><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong><br> I said...you...!</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong><br> (Sigh) So annoying.<br> Even my hunger has dissipated.</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong><br> ...Hmph. It&#39;s almost time to wake up.<br> I failed to devour the moron before me.</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong><br> Perhaps it is the same for humans, but I will likely forget this most amusing dream of mine.</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong><br> And if you don&#39;t want me to remember that I failed to devour you...</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong><br> Do not ever mention what happened in this dream should you recall it. For your own safety.</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong><br> Hmph.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Oh.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> What&#39;s wrong, Senpai?</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong><br> ...! (Silent pressure)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong><br> ... (Look that says, \u201CGood. Keep quiet.\u201D)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...?</p><p><strong>Stheno:</strong><br> Very suspicious, don&#39;t you think, \u201Cme?\u201D</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong><br> Yes. They were exchanging knowing glances with each other, \u201Cme.\u201D</p><p><strong>Stheno:</strong><br> Hehe...our foolish younger sister, who&#39;s three times the size of the one we&#39;re used to seeing...the BBB (Big Big Big) Mountain...</p><p><strong>Stheno:</strong><br> What in the world do you think transpired between her and Master last night? I am so curious.</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong><br> Yes. We must pry it out of her...down to the last juicy detail.</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong><br> Privacy? What&#39;s that?<br> We had no such thing on our island.</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong><br> Older sisters...!?</p><p><strong>Stheno &amp; Euryale:</strong><br> Fess up. Right now.<br> Come on...hurry up...spill it...!</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong><br> M-Master! Remember that we had planned a training session in the simulator!?</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong><br> Let&#39;s get going! It&#39;s important! If I don&#39;t get exercise, I&#39;ll get rusty! Now, please excuse us!</p><p><strong>Stheno:</strong><br> She&#39;s fleeing with Master! Does that mean something really...is there some truth behind what we think happened between them!?</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong><br> Hold it right there! Do you think you can get away with keeping secrets from your older sisters!? You big, giant fool of a sister! Wait up!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Wh-what just happened?</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou, fooou!</p>', 274);
