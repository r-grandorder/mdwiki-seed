No, you&#39;re wrong, Lord Roman. I&#39;m neither a warrior nor a samurai. Just some dude that can wave a stick.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Whaaaaaat!?</p><p><strong>Kojirou:</strong><br> Besides a sword, I&#39;ve carried hoes before, too.<br> So I am quite handy with peasant works, too.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Whoa...That&#39;s impressive, but how did you become a Heroic Spirit, again...?</p><p><strong>Chairperson:</strong><br> The first match<br> &quot;SAMURAIS&quot; vs. &quot;Immortal Soldiers!!&quot;</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Wait wait wait, this is messed up!!<br> Immortal!? Are they zombies!? Skeletons!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I&#39;ll leave it to you this time, Doctor.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Groovy, Roman.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes. It is twice the communications traffic than usual.<br> The Doctor&#39;s interested in Kojirou...or rather, SAMURAI.</p><p><strong>Kojirou:</strong><br> Hmm...so let&#39;s have a fair...fight!!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Kojirou:</strong><br> Umm. Given your opponent&#39;s build, you&#39;ll need to be creative. Focus on inserting your blade and pulling your arm back, I guess.</p><p><strong>Chairperson:</strong><br> What an overwhelming force! Who on earth is he?<br> &quot;SAMURAI,&quot; warrior from the Orient!</p><p><strong>Chairperson:</strong><br> But that&#39;s the extent of his power!!<br> Next up is a gladiator-killing demon!</p><p><strong>Chairperson:</strong><br> Our champion!!<br> &quot;Demon Sword, the Emissary from Hell!!&quot;</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Any way you slice it, that&#39;s a demon! That&#39;s insane!<br> Isn&#39;t that insane!? What has happened to the reign of Rome!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Calm down, Doctor.<br> That&#39;s a gladiator&#39;s costume.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Oh, I seeee. It&#39;s just a performance to hype up the battle...and you think I&#39;d fall for that!?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I mean it&#39;s got wings and a tail!!<br> That transcends the level of a costume!!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Why did the Emperor hire this guy? Is she a moron? I had a feeling all along, but is the Roman Emperor a moron?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> No matter how great a samurai you are, Kojirou...<br> No, even if you were raised in the wild, that&#39;s not fair!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Your opponent transcends Bushido, you know!<br> Default, Kojirou! That would be the best!</p><p><strong>Kojirou:</strong><br> Hahaha.<br> Lord Roman, you worry too much.</p><p><strong>Kojirou:</strong><br> Don&#39;t worry about me!<br> I fought beasts on a daily basis in the mountains.</p><p><strong>Kojirou:</strong><br> Look. An ox head, bear body, and monkey legs.<br> A worthy opponent, but rather boring.</p><p><strong>Kojirou:</strong><br> Why don&#39;t you relax and enjoy this, Lord Roman?<br> OK, Master. Let&#39;s show off our abilities!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Kojirou:</strong><br> Hmm. He&#39;s invulnerable like Berserker.<br> Guess this wasn&#39;t just a beast?</p><p><strong>Chairperson:</strong><br> No matter how much you attack him, he won&#39;t fall!!<br> That&#39;s our champ, &quot;Demon Sword!!&quot;</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> You&#39;re still going to insist that it&#39;s a human fighter!<br> I&#39;m going to make a direct complaint to Emperor Nero!</p><p><strong>Demon Sword:</strong><br> Ugoaaaaaaaaa!!!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Watch out, Master!!</p><p><strong>Kojirou:</strong><br> Hidden Sword\u2013Swallow Reversal!!</p><p><strong>Demon Sword:</strong><br> Goaaaaaaaa...!!</p><p><strong>Chairperson:</strong><br> ...!!<br> Wh-What has happened!?</p><p><strong>Chairperson:</strong><br> Demon Sword, undefeated for 100 battles, has finally fallen!!</p><p><strong>Kojirou:</strong><br> I guess its stock of resurrection ran out.<br> ...How boring.</p><p><strong>Kojirou:</strong><br> I expected a tough opponent, but it&#39;s still quite far from an enlightenment of a new Hidden Sword.</p><p><strong>Kojirou:</strong><br> Well. I wonder when I&#39;ll meet the one who could surpass the swallow on that day.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> No, no, no. The swallow you fought was absolutely nuts, a phantasmal! Was it a phantasmal?</p><p><strong>Chairperson:</strong><br> A new champion has risen here!!<br> His name is &quot;SAMURAI,&quot; the warrior of the Orient.</p><p><strong>Chairperson:</strong><br> We ask the audience to welcome this new champion with a loud round of applause!!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> This just turned into something amazing, Senpai.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You&#39;re amazing, SAMURAI!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> That&#39;s right, SAMURAI.</p><hr><p><strong>Kojirou:</strong><br> This is some pretty good cheering.<br> It lacks elegance but the thunderous applause is nice.</p><p><strong>Kojirou:</strong><br> Lord Fujimaru, I&#39;ve caused you trouble.<br> Well, let&#39;s have a drink to celebrate the victory.</p><p><strong>Kojirou:</strong><br> Will there be a bag of rice, too? Man, a place where you can make money from martial arts! This is a nice town!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> \u2013After that, the fighter from the Orient piled on victory after victory as a great Gladiator in Roman history</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> and became a legend among the people for a long time henceforth...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> \u2013Well, that bit of Roman gladiator history continues to be described about in detail but</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Have anything to say, Kojirou?</p><p><strong>Kojirou:</strong><br> No, I was just excited.<br> Forgive me.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> It was incredible! Swallow Reversal 100 slashes!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Her Majesty was delighted, too.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Kojirou was really popular.<br> The merchandise was flying off the shelves, too!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Emperor Nero was having a fit though.<br> She said, &quot;I shall be the 100th opponent!&quot;</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> But, I am surprised that the history can tolerate this amount of changes.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> No, it can&#39;t tolerate at all.<br> Romani, what are we going to do about this?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Well...We went there to correct the history, and now we actually ended up changing it...What should we do, Fou?</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou!!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Fou said, &quot;Super Overtime.&quot;<br> Doctor, do you want to eat the food we got as prizes?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Don&#39;t need it, return it to Rome!</p>', 90);
