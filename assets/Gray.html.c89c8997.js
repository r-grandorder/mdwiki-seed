But from Gray&#39;s point of view, these were all changes that suddenly started happening to her, and even know she still can&#39;t accept her new face as her own. Due to this she seems to want to distance herself from her own face, and has now created a relationship of deep trust with Lord El-Melloi II, who took her away from her hometown.</p><p>Gray frequently carries a birdcage with a talking box, Add.</p><p>At Gray&#39;s command, Add is able to transform into all sorts of weapons, like a scythe or even a hammer to aid her. Combined with her training as a gravekeeper, Gray&#39;s combat abilities have reached a level far beyond that of normal humans.</p><p>This is kind of a big secret, but the holy spear given to King Arthur, Rhongomyniad, is currently sealed within Add. This is to prevent the mystery of this Noble Phantasm from decaying from reacting to the current texture of human order, and also to allow them to unleash Rhongomyniad when necessary.</p><p>Seeing as the current circumstances put human order at stake, Gray would not hesitate to use the spear.</p><h2 id="standard-weapons" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#standard-weapons" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Standard Weapons</h2><p>Scythe: This is Add&#39;s usual form. It is the best one at absorbing mana, while it is second best in attack power.</p><p>Great Shield: It is capable of absorbing mana and releasing it along with a reversal curse.</p><p>Hammer: Its mana absorption is D rank, but it has the highest attack. Gray does rely on it when she really needs to.</p><p>Boomerang: A giant boomerang swung using both hands. If it&#39;s for a short distance, they can even be used as gliding wings. She used it this way in volume 7.</p><p>Halberd: This form shares part of its design with Rhongomyniad. This one has the highest speed and sharpness. Using this one reminds Gray the most of her trance-like state when using Rhongomyniad, so she doesn&#39;t like it very much.</p><p>Bow: This has not been used in the story. It&#39;s a bow that shoots arrows of mana.</p><p>Greatsword: This has not been used in the story. A form rarely taken by Add. An imitation of Excalibur. To begin with there&#39;s no real reason to have Rhongomyniad imitate Excalibur, but this form was something set up by the Arthur cultists from Gray&#39;s hometown.</p><h2 id="related-characters" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#related-characters" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Related Characters</h2><p><strong>Zhuge Liang:</strong></p><p>Oh, umm...I feel greatly honored to get to meet my teacher in his younger days.</p><p><strong>Sima Yi:</strong></p><p>If you&#39;d like, it would make me happy if we could have tea together again...?</p><p><strong>Olgamarie:</strong></p><p>Miss Olgamarie is here?
