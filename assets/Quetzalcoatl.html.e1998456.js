Basically, she spins the opponent around in the air and drops them on the top of their head in a piledriver, or accordingly to the situation presented, she might aim to kick the opponent from a height of 1000 meters, becoming a strike as if she is a meteor.

Quetzalcoatl\u2019s trump card. The megalith of the ancient Aztecs. The Aztec calendar that is said to show all the world\u2019s past and present.

More or less composed. However, when she encounters something that makes her a little happy, there is a sudden rise in excitement within her, and while still like that, she has difficulties in pronunciation, becoming like a pseudo-foreigner in her speech.</p><p>First Person Pronouns: watashi [katakana characters] / watashi [kanji character]<br> Second Person Pronouns: anata [katakana characters] / anata [kanji characters] / ni\xF1a, ni\xF1o / \u25CB\u25CB (without honorifics) / Master, \u25CB\u25CB-kun, \u25CB\u25CB-chan<br> Third Person Pronouns: kare / kanojo / \u25CB\u25CB (without honorifics)</p><h2 id="personality" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#personality" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Personality</h2><p>A god of peace and tranquility. Now, an enigmatic elder sister who is addicted to lucha libre. A gentle god who guided to prosperity and with affection, the lovely humans. A gentle god with a famous legend. Basically, human beings are the subjects Quetzalcoatl watches over in the near future, and whether they are people who point their blades, or whether they are people who believe in themselves, she thinks about how one should not kill thoughtlessly. A bright optimist. However, a faithful optimist as well. She surely has a smiling face that makes the Sun apparent in the hearts of men, and she surely believes in opening up a path to a happy era, not letting that brightness be extinguished no matter what kind of crisis there is. An elder sister with a very big-hearted spirit, a broad-mindedness that is like the Earth, and a bright and passionate disposition that is like the Sun.</p><p>Nonetheless, Quetzalcoatl\u2019s thought criteria and the scale of her existence is that of a god\u2019s. She cannot capture everything on the same scale as a human being\u2019s, and she may even sometimes pass a cruel/brutal judgement as a result. She is without mercy to opponents that are considered disasters or foreign enemies, displaying a terrifying facial expression to them. For most things, Quetzalcoatl endorses communication and prosperity with a smiling face, saying that \u201CIt\u2019s wonderful everybody\u2019s fuineee, so this elder sister is happy!\u201D, but she becomes displeased when talking about Tezcatlipoca and alcohol. This person deeply regrets that she was defeated in the battle with Tezcatlipoca, while simultaneously, she feels a lot of resentment as a result. Rather than saying that she is angry at Tezcatlipoca, she becomes \u201Csullen\u201D towards her powerlessness in defeating Tezcatlipoca \u2013 who is the Spider \u2013 and that Jaguar Deity. Regarding \u201Calcohol\u201D, it is the biggest reason why she was defeated in the battle against the former Evil God, and although she wants \u201Cno more\u201D, she drinks without thinking in order to encourage herself, even now. Only a small bit will get her drunk, and she will state what she really thinks with her \u201Cbad self\u2026\u201D And then, she becomes unconscious, having no recollection of it.</p><p>The particulars on how Quetzalcoatl got addicted to lucha libre (professional wrestling) is quite simple: she ended up seeing lucha libre during a time when she was summoned into some era, and that overwhelming shock since then made a very strong impression even on her main body sitting on the Throne, or so it seems.</p><p>\u201CSo, it\u2019s the body! Something like using weapons to occasionally kill each other\u2026 that should be avoided to the utmost care! Even during times of discussion, lucha is the most suitable answer!\u201D</p><p>Quetzalcoatl\u2019s favourite luchador is Mistico. As a God of Wind, and as a God of the Morning Star, she observed the luchadores (luchadoras in the case of women) flying freely as if they have wings, and she was deeply moved, shedding tears of gratitude, before having experienced then the distant future, or something like that. Thereafter, her fondness for diligence and her characteristic curiosity turned into her fortunes, and she became a luchadora just like that, acquiring the persona of a professional wrestling enthusiast which is unprecedented even among the goddesses. She boasts that she can definitely succeed in applying a headlock onto any kind of deity or monster once she puts her mind to it, but because the propagation of lucha libre is centered around aerial techniques, she is currently sealing the submission techniques that are the quintessence of lucha.</p><h2 id="attitude-towards-master" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#attitude-towards-master" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Attitude Towards Master</h2><p>The deities of South America returned to the land of the jungles, stopping their activities in the Age of Gods, but they were dreaming of the development of humanity. Humanity, \u201Ceven though they are still irrational now, in the distant future, they will become autonomous, they will compete with each other, and through thick and thin, they will become a species prospering far and wide, abundantly, and plentifully\u201D, and for those kinds of deities that arrived by being imported from the outside, they slept, dreaming of the humanity that will become that prosperous species. Those are the deities of South America in the Fate World.</p><p>During the moment where Quetzalcoatl is summoned as a Servant, she views something sprouting in her Master, and then becomes deeply moved. Basically a Servant who loves her Master. However, she does not \u201Clove her Master\u201D in the meaning of the broader sense, but she loves the \u201Cgrowth of this seed called mankind that is being nurtured within this Master.\u201D</p><h2 id="dialogue-examples" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#dialogue-examples" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Dialogue Examples</h2><p>\u201CSo I think it\u2019s not good to mince them with your snake parts.

In mythology, it is said that Quetzalcoatl is a gentle god who loves peace and that he bestowed many blessings to the humans. The meaning of his name is \u201CWinged Serpent\u201D. It is said that he is called both the God of Wind and the God of Culture. There is also a legend that he is a Sun God who governed the sun for a time.</p><p>Quetzalcoatl was once regarded as the same as the Good God Tlahuizcalpantecuhtli, who is the embodiment of the Morning Star, and he denied the sacrifices the humans offered to the gods \u201Cas unnecessary.\u201D Although he guided the people to prosperity by bestowing them many knowledges such as agriculture and fire, all while loving everybody, he bought the resentment of the god Tezcatlipoca, and in the end, he was defeated in battle by him; it is said that he took off from the Aztecs to Venus, and his figure was erased. Prophecies were left behind of his return to the Aztecs once again; later on, the Aztec people believed that Quetzalcoatl had returned with the Spanish people and reached the decision of having the Aztecs perish.</p><p>Quetzalcoatl was originally a male deity. At the time of his materialization, he obtained an existence as a female deity. Maybe he was drawn towards the image of Venus (Aphrodite) \u2013 the goddess of beauty and the planet Venus \u2013 due to the influence of the existence of the planet Venus, which is regarded as the same as Quetzalcoatl\u2019s for a long time, or so Quetzalcoatl herself now says.</p><p>The South American deities are greatly unlike the other mythological systems of deities, and those South American deities would take action in \u201Ctransferring from one human to another.\u201D Even the god Quetzalcoatl was identified in several ways according to different regions, and it may not come to light that this female body of some time period became Quetzalcoatl.</p><h2 id="character-in-fgo" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#character-in-fgo" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Character in FGO</h2><p>Quetzalcoatl appeared in Chapter 7. One of the goddesses in the Three Goddess Alliance, an alliance that was meant to destroy the Mesopotamian world. A goddess of Central and South America as well as of Aztec Mythology. One of the goddesses summoned by Tiamat. Her favourite phrase in the moments of agitating her opponent is \u201CYucat\xE1n?\u201D Seen as free and uncontrolled, she is a goddess full of kind-hearted intelligence. She hates sacrificial ceremonies and loves mankind. She knows the lucha libre (professional wrestling) of Central and South America upon materializing, and she is receiving a great influence from this.</p><p>Quetzalcoatl joined the Goddess Alliance in order to protect the humans. Although she is disgusted with the Holy Grail, she does not want the transfer of the Holy Grail to the other two goddesses to happen, so she decided to carry out the fall of Uruk. That person\u2019s principle was called \u201Cknocking all humans down to the cement one by one.\u201D Something is suspicious.</p><p>Quetzalcoatl fundamentally wrestles barehanded, but of course, she will also make use of a weapon from her myth. That weapon\u2019s name is the Macana. A weapon that wears a comprehensible outward appearance, and it is very painful to punch on.</p><p>The Yucat\xE1n Peninsula is the place where a meteorite fell and caused the extinction of the dinosaurs, and a mythological system was cultivated above this plateau, concealing the \u201Cbestowed \u2018blood\u2019 from an outside astronomical object.\u201D The first generation Kukulkan (the name of Quetzalcoatl in Mayan Civilization) was an existence who possessed elements (bacteria and microorganisms) of this outside astronomical object, or so it was told. This backbone is closely matched with Altera\u2019s, and yet, it was a visitor from the universe more ancient than Altera. However, there is a discrepancy where Altera was an invader while Kukulkan was a being adrift in space.</p><h2 id="related-characters" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#related-characters" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Related Characters</h2><p><strong>Tezcatlipoca</strong></p><p>\u201CThe worst, disgusting Divine Spirit no matter the time or place.
