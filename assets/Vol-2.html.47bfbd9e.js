A great hero who killed a dragon.</p><p>A prince of the Netherlands, he was brave and noble, and everyone praised his majestic appearance and extoled his glory.</p><p>All men hastened to become his subordinates, and all women pushed their earnest affections onto him.</p><p>The hero also lived up to their expectations.</p><p>With rarely any time for rest, he only sought battle. No, it wasn\u2019t that he sought battle, but rather, battle would never let him and his great power escape.</p><p>His famous sword Balmung, which he received from the tribe of the fog, the Nibelung. His body of steel, which was bathed in the blood of the evil dragon Fafnir, whom he slayed.</p><p>An invincible sword and an invincible body. It was only logical that many battles sought him out. Untouched until his death, his life was simply dazzling.</p><p>But he was a hero\u2014too much so. When someone made a request of him, he answered it. When someone kneeled before him and begged his help, he firmly grasped their proffered hand.</p><p>When asked to slay a dragon, he slayed it. When asked for help in sleeping with a peerless beautiful maiden whom none could satisfy, he wracked his brains over a way to do so. His actions were neither good nor bad. His way of life was just like that of a wish-granting machine. He thought that it was fine that way. After all, good and evil were merely a matter of where you stood.</p><p>When officials who took advantage of their position complained that their families had been killed, he took revenge for them.</p><p>Since people suffering in poverty simply didn\u2019t wish for anything, he abandoned them.</p><p>Because if he didn\u2019t do so, it would never end. It\u2019s impossible to carry everything in the world in a single person\u2019s arms. So he decided to only respond to requests that were asked of him.</p><p>He did not act according to his own will. He did not fight because he liked it. As he was doing so, the hero suddenly realized. He did not know what he himself wished for at all. He had no wishes or dreams. He couldn\u2019t even imagine the future. Even though there were those who called the hero an ideal being, the hero in question had lost sight of his own ideal.</p><p>\u2014What a fraud. The gears did not mesh at all. If he responded to any and all requests, it was only natural that he would end up not knowing what he himself wanted.</p><p>He had lost sight of his path and wandered aimlessly, but even so\u2014he believed that there lay something at the end. He believed that there lay something at the end of this way of life. The hero could only continue to fight.</p><p>He was never defeated. Such a thing was impossible. As long as others requested victory of him, he grasped victory no matter how much suffering and despair he trod on.</p><p>Victory, victory, he only knew victory. \u201CPlease kill that monster\u201D, \u201CPlease save our village\u201D, \u201CPlease defeat our enemies\u201D, \u201CPlease get me that mountain\u201D, \u201CPlease get me that beautiful maiden\u201D, \u201CPlease get me that country\u201D\u2014the number of wishes equaled the number of people, and the amount of those he granted equaled the amount of those that were requested of him.</p><p>He was already a mere [System]\u2014a [Holy Grail] that bore the name \u2018hero\u2019.</p><p>Even so, it\u2019s fine, the hero thought.</p><p>After all, being thanked by someone was not a bad feeling.</p><p>It was only natural that his heart would be moved when people requested his help with desperate expressions.</p><p>So he continued without faltering\u2014and in the end, he even managed to slay a dragon. But there was a hole somewhere in his heart. There was nothing at the bottom of the hole, merely an empty black space within him.</p><p>Even though he loved humans.</p><p>Even though he loved the world.</p><p>He never managed to fill that emptiness no matter what he did.</p><p>The hero\u2019s name was\u2014</p><h2 id="chapter-1" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#chapter-1" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Chapter 1</h2><hr><p>Staggering, he tried to stand up, and his hand touched the surface of cool and rough rock. Before he could ask himself where he was, he sensed the presence of something in front of him and felt himself gripped by a chill.</p><p>Something was breathing nearby. But why were those breaths showering his entire body?</p><p>\u2026It was because the [something] that appeared to be in front of him was absurdly huge. Filled with rage and wickedness, it was lying in wait to eat him.</p><p>His own breathing became erratic. He wanted to run away, immediately run away at full speed; he had to run away, run away, run away. However, his body couldn\u2019t move, as if it were tied down to his shadow. Cold and unpleasant drops of sweat dripped down his entire body like slugs.</p><p>\u2014Cold.</p><p>His heart was frozen in fear. And yet, heat shook throughout his body. Did that mean that the thing right in front of him was something more ferocious than any kind of flame?</p><p>The air he inhaled was like poison, and exhaling it was accompanied by pain. However, the thing in front of him never tried to lay a hand on him.</p><p>Without appearing or calling out, the thing sluggishly turned in another direction. It was neither running away nor leaving. It had simply drawn its huge body back inside.</p><p>There was only one sentence that the thing communicated to him.</p><p>Don\u2019t forget. Those words engraved themselves on his skin like a tattoo.</p><p>\u2014This is neither a dream nor reality. This is the threshold world on the border between dreams and reality.</p><p>Never forget this thing, for you will meet it again soon.</p><p>Thus, with a pain in his chest that felt as if needles had been stabbed into him, and with the feeling of his blood burning as if on fire\u2014he awoke.</p><hr><p>Frozen air, frozen silence. The forest was simply dark and silent. Rider of Black, Astolfo, who had been emotionally sobbing just earlier, finally stood up.</p><p>He pulled up the fallen homunculus. His stature, which should have been slightly smaller or about the same as Rider\u2019s, had grown considerably. It appeared that, due to taking in Saber of Black\u2019s\u2014Siegfried\u2019s heart, his body had undergone a radical transformation.</p><p>Still unable to believe it, the homunculus clenched and unclenched his hands again and again. The dull pain he felt when his heart was ruptured still remained, but it had already been reduced to a level that wouldn\u2019t impede him.</p><p>\u201CIt seems that Saber\u2019s heart is functioning properly.\u201D</p><p>Rider nodded, appearing impressed. The homunculus put his hand against his heart, and indeed felt a strong pulse from it. His blood was so hot that it made him sweat all over his body.</p><p>\u201CYeah\u2014\u201D</p><p>The homunculus felt slightly moved as he spoke without experiencing pain. To think that inhaling and exhaling could be so comfortable!</p><p>Somewhat excited, he surveyed his surroundings until his attention was caught by a tree.</p><p>The homunculus adjusted his breathing and activated his Magic Circuits. He gently placed his hands on the tree, confirmed the tree\u2019s material properties, and then released his prana to destroy it. The tree easily broke like a twig, but the homunculus\u2019 body magnificently endured the force of operating his Magic Circuits.</p><p>Watching him, Rider nodded in a somewhat lonely manner.</p><p>\u201C\u2026Yeah. Like this, you\u2019ll probably be okay by yourself from here on. Since Saber died, someone has to go back and explain what happened right away, or things will become complicated.\u201D</p><p>Rider was correct. The Masters at the Fortress of Millennia were probably confirming the status of all the Servants one by one. Saber had been sent to chase after Rider and the homunculus, so there was a high chance that a new pursuer would be sent at this rate.</p><p>\u201CI have to take back this guy too.\u201D</p><p>He lightly tapped the head of Saber\u2019s Master\u2026 Gordes Musik Yggdmillennia, who was unconscious after having been struck by Saber. The man\u2019s physique normally wouldn\u2019t make carrying him a feasible feat, but Rider was a Heroic Spirit. Carrying the man on his shoulder was no problem for him.</p><p>\u201COh, that\u2019s right. We don\u2019t know what you might encounter along the way, so I\u2019ll give you this sword.\u201D</p><p>Rider casually handed over the slender sword hanging along his waist. Bewildered, the homunculus accepted it. Though it was slender, the steel blade felt heavy in his hands.</p><p>\u201CBut, this is yours\u2014\u201D</p><p>\u201CYeah, but I have my lance and book besides my sword. And that\u2019s not even including my Hippogriff as well. Honestly, I don\u2019t use my sword that much.\u201D</p><p>Rider gave a full-blown smile and a peace sign with his fingers\u2014unable to see a reason to refuse, the homunculus hung the sword along his waist.</p><p>He was a bit worried about his balance due to the added weight on one side of his body, but he would probably get used to it before long.</p><p>\u201C\u2026I want you to use it with great care. It seems I misunderstood Saber. Umm, how to put it\u2026? I mistakenly thought he was a sullen, straight-laced and boring guy.\u201D</p><p>\u201CI get it. Thank you. You truly saved me.\u201D</p><p>\u201CIt\u2019s fine, it\u2019s fine. I wasn\u2019t very useful in the end.\u201D</p><p>That\u2019s not true, thought the homunculus. Rider alone had answered his cries for help. He had held out his hand to him, saying he would help him. The homunculus had nothing to repay him with, and yet Rider had unhesitatingly done something that would not recompense him in any way\u2026 Perhaps it was precisely because he was such a man that his words had convinced Saber to save the homunculus at the last moment.</p><p>\u201CBy the way, I\u2019ve wanted to ask you before. \u2014What\u2019s your name?\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2026My name?\u201D</p><p>How difficult, thought the homunculus as he folded his arms. Naturally, if he had been specially made to serve as a maid or to fight, he would have been given a name to discern him from other homunculi, but since he was just a mass-produced industrial product, there had been no need to give him a name.</p><p>That\u2019s why he had to think of a name for himself now. There was no way he could live his entire life under the name \u2018homunculus\u2019.</p><p>Suddenly, he placed his hand upon his heart. This was a blessed gift from a Heroic Spirit. So, at the very least\u2014</p><p>\u201CHow about \u2018Sieg\u2019?\u201D</p><p>\u201CNot Siegfried?\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2026It would be far too brazen for me to completely copy his name. But, it would be regrettable to completely forget it as well. So, I thought \u2018Sieg\u2019 would do.\u201D</p><p>Rider nodded his head enthusiastically.</p><p>\u201CThat\u2019s true\u2026 Yeah, Sieg is a nice name, isn\u2019t it?\u201D</p><p>\u201CThank you. Then, my name is Sieg.\u201D</p><p>\u201CAhaha. Nice to meet you, Sieg!\u201D</p><p>Rider offered his hand, and, with some hesitation, Sieg grabbed it with his own. They both knew that their final farewell was approaching soon.</p><p>\u201CIsn\u2019t there something I can do for you?\u201D</p><p>Rider made a somewhat painful expression and slowly shook his head.</p><p>\u201C\u2014There isn\u2019t. You have been freed from this war. You\u2019re a free man now. And most likely, your life span has been increased to that of an ordinary person, I think? So you should live normally and die normally. If you do that, the one who saved you, Saber, will probably be happy as well.\u201D</p><p>With a kind gesture like that of a young maiden, Rider placed his hand on Sieg\u2019s cheek and smiled. Then, as if overcome with emotion, he pulled Sieg\u2019s head close and ruffled his hair.</p><p>After doing that for a while, Rider finally released him.</p><p>\u201CAll right, get going now. I\u2019ll manage somehow or other on my side.\u201D</p><p>Nodding at Rider\u2019s words that seemed to thrust him away slightly, Sieg drew back first one, then two steps. It was slow, but he was certainly increasing the distance between them. Rider waved his hand reluctantly as they parted, but eventually he nodded as if severing himself from something, and then he suddenly hoisted up Gordes over his shoulder and turned his back to Sieg.</p><p>\u201CRider! What should I do?\u201D</p><p>Sieg called out to his back as he began to leave. Rider turned his head around and shouted back to him with a full-blown smile on his face.</p><p>\u201CAnything is fine! You\u2019re able to do anything now! Go to a town, meet people, come to like and dislike others, and live a happy life!\u201D</p><p>I see. Indeed, that is probably happiness, agreed Sieg mentally\u2026 Somewhere in his heart, he felt a sense of unease like a thin, clinging membrane, but he did his best to avert his eyes from that.</p><p>Rider breathed a sigh of satisfaction.</p><p>Yeah, that homunculus was no longer someone that needed to be protected. With his strong body and first-rate Magic Circuits, it shouldn\u2019t be impossible for him to quietly slip into the world and keep on living.</p><p>Of course, Yggdmillennia\u2019s reparations were considerably large. Losing Saber, the self-proclaimed strongest swordsman in the Great Holy Grail War, was especially fatal.</p><p>The Black Faction had also managed to defeat Berserker of Red, Spartacus, and had placed him under their control as a pawn. But the respective value of Saber and Berserker was not comparable by any means.</p><p>\u201C\u2026Well, it\u2019s fine. What will be, will be.\u201D</p><p>With that, Rider stopped thinking about the course of the Great Holy Grail War. For the time being, he would simply dance through the skies and fight. Of course, he had to wrack his brains over how to explain the matter of Saber\u2014but he was bad at lying, and he didn\u2019t think he\u2019d done anything wrong either.</p><p>True, Saber of Black, Siegfried, had given his heart to the homunculus and died as a result. This might have been a fatal act for them in the Great Holy Grail War. But so what? In the end, Saber, who had been given a second life, did what he wanted to do. It was definitely not something he\u2019d been forced to do, but rather an act of selflessness\u2014of justice.</p><p>He would honestly and frankly confess with pride in his chest that Saber had done the right thing.</p><p>That was what Rider decided.</p><p>Thus, Sieg slowly began walking. His legs stepped forward strongly and made light footprints on the frozen ground. But, even so, his progress was slow. With each step he took, he would turn around and watch Rider\u2019s increasingly distant figure.</p><p>Rider still hadn\u2019t killed the living Gordes. He was a Master and had Command Spells remaining, so it was possible for him to make a contract with a new Servant.</p><p>The problem was that Rider might be punished. He didn\u2019t know anything besides the knowledge that he had possessed from birth regarding the Great Holy Grail War. But he knew enough to understand that the Saber class was famed for being the strongest among all Servant classes.</p><p>That Saber had died. Moreover, it had been due to giving his heart to Sieg. This was an act that could rightfully be called equivalent to suicide. That was an unmistakeable truth even for Servants. Even though he had been given a second life like this, why had he done such a thing?</p><p>\u2026Sieg didn\u2019t know what Saber had wished for. Sieg was neither his comrade, nor his friend. They weren\u2019t even acquaintances. Though, in a sense, they might share the common feature of possessing lives that were meant to be consumed like wood chips.</p><p>Even so, Sieg had been saved by him. Overflowing with feelings of endless gratitude, he did not know how to repay this debt.</p><p>Now then. For the time being, he would head to a town just like Rider said. That being said, though, there was no way he could slip into Trifas. That town was Yggdmillennia\u2019s territory. So he would walk straight through this place and go to a nearby village.</p><p>\u2026He had to go, but.</p><p>Quite strangely, in spite of the fact that Rider had already disappeared from sight, his progress was slow as his feet still tended to stop.</p><p>\u201CHmm, I wonder why?\u201D</p><p>For some reason, he whispered to himself\u2014and his throat didn\u2019t hurt from doing so, which made him a little happy. As a homunculus, there was nothing he didn\u2019t know about himself. At the very least, he should know about any errors in his body.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t that he was injured. His physical condition was at its highest within his short life. There was heat in his body and his heartbeat was strong. There were no errors in his feet at all. His brain\u2014no errors. His nerves\u2014no damage. Illness due to a virus\u2014none.</p><p>Everything was normal. And his objective was to first [go to a town] because he had to secure a base besides that of Trifas. He estimated the possibility of his success to be a bit more than 80%. If he was unlucky, he might get caught by Yggdmillennia by coincidence and then would probably return to a tragic fate.</p><p>He had an objective and his physical condition was normal, so there was no reason for his feet not to move. And yet, they wouldn\u2019t move.</p><p>\u201CI should have asked Rider for a method to make my feet move\u2026\u201D</p><p>And suddenly, at this late hour.</p><p>The homunculus realized he was alone once more. And that he would never again meet Rider.</p><p>\u201C\u2026Hmm.\u201D</p><p>It hurts, he thought as he felt his chest tighten a little. Trying to ignore it as much as possible, he somehow managed to continue walking.</p><hr><p>To explain starting from the conclusion, Rider of Black, Astolfo, currently had stakes driven into both his arms and legs, had his movements confined by fluid-form golems and was in fact imprisoned along with Berserker of Red.</p><p>He had spoken too honestly, and to make it worse had added in his own thoughts (\u201CIt was really quite refreshing!\u201D) into his report. That Lancer of Black\u2014Vlad III\u2014would become enraged was only to be expected.</p><p>All the Masters, who learned Saber of Black\u2019s true name, had also looked at Rider of Black with reproach. After all, it was Siegfried, the \u2018dragon-slayer\u2019 of the Netherlands. To the Black Faction, he was certainly a Servant that could serve as their trump card.</p><p>Lancer had ordered that Rider be imprisoned and then immediately vanished into spiritual form. His Master Darnic was smoothing things over with him, but he was currently in an ill mood. If this were back when he was still alive, someone\u2019s life would certainly have been a necessary price to improve his mood.</p><p>After expelling everyone else from the dungeon, Rider\u2019s Master Celenike slapped his face. Annoyingly to her, the sound it made was very light. Although Rider wore a solemn expression, he showed no signs of reacting to the pain\u2014and most of all, no signs of despair.</p><p>\u201CDo you understand just what you did?\u201D</p><p>\u201CI understand, you know? I saved a homunculus\u2026 That\u2019s all.\u201D</p><p>\u201CDon\u2019t joke around! Saber has disappeared, don\u2019t you get it!? Saber, the strongest of all Servants! And it wasn\u2019t in battle. He didn\u2019t even die in battle! He disappeared due to an internal dispute, how ridiculous! And it\u2019s your fault!\u201D</p><p>Rider thought it over for a short while, and while knowing his next words might anger her, he whispered.</p><p>\u201CNo. It\u2019s not my responsibility. Saber splendidly acted according to his own will, just like a hero should.\u201D</p><p>Celenike slapped Rider\u2019s face again. Even so, he remained calm and composed, which exasperated her irritation more and more, so she gripped the stakes stabbed into his hands and legs and shook them.</p><p>\u201COw, oooooww! No, c-come on, give me a break!\u201D</p><p>She felt satisfied as Rider finally showed an anguished face. It was an expression that she hadn\u2019t been able to see no matter what she did to him on top of the bed.</p><p><img src="https://i2.lensdump.com/i/1mYw3Q.webp" alt=""></p><p>\u2014This alone is wonderful, and yet\u2026</p><p>Celenike thought so from the bottom of her heart. It was truly regrettable that Servants didn\u2019t possess a physical body made of flesh.</p><p>\u201CIf you had held back at my side like a Servant should, you wouldn\u2019t be in this kind of position.\u201D</p><p>\u201CAh, if I start doing that from now on, will you take these things out?\u201D</p><p>Celenike, as expected, shook her head at that proposal. At the very least, Lancer of Black would not allow it. She had no intention of getting dragged into it.</p><p>\u201C\u2014These will only be taken out when you fight. It\u2019s been decided that you will be completely treated as a pawn in this Great Holy Grail War.\u201D</p><p>Celenike gave a cruel smile and put her mouth to his ear as she spoke.</p><p>\u201CIf you\u2019re going to blame someone, blame that homunculus.\u201D</p><p>Watching Celenike leave after saying that, Rider tilted his head with an idle expression.</p><p>\u201C\u2026Why?\u201D</p><p>Celenike considered Servants as being the same as normal humans too much. After all, Rider couldn\u2019t understand at all her words about hating the homunculus. He understood it even less than the reason for why Lancer of Black had driven stakes into his limbs and the abuse he had received from his Master.</p><p>Crossing paths with Celenike as she left, Archer of Black\u2014Chiron\u2014also came to visit Rider in the dungeon. He hadn\u2019t said a single word when Rider had been brought before all the other Servants and Masters.</p><p>\u201C\u2014If I had at least intervened, it wouldn\u2019t have come to this.\u201D</p><p>This was true. Lancer highly valued Archer\u2019s strategic experience, and he was widely trusted due to his honest and upright character. If he had spoken out and stood up for Rider, there was a high chance that the matter would have been settled with just a rebuke.</p><p>But Rider immediately had stopped him from doing so with a brief glance at the start.</p><p>\u201CNo, no. There\u2019s no reason to split apart our camp due to a trivial thing like this. In this incident, I was scolded and received punishment. If that\u2019s enough to end the matter, I don\u2019t mind it at all.\u201D</p><p>Rider understood why he was being punished. Regardless of whether what he did was right or not, it didn\u2019t change the fact that Saber had died in the end. So the king, Lancer, thought it was necessary for someone to be punished. And since Saber was gone, Rider was the only one who could be punished now.</p><p>Even if it was unreasonable and he knew that his actions hadn\u2019t been wrong, Rider did not refuse the punishment. He had decided that upon finally reaching here.</p><p>\u2014In the first place, this wasn\u2019t his first time being locked up and imprisoned. He had a similar experience when he was trapped in the form of a tree by a certain witch.</p><p>\u201CHowever\u2026\u201D</p><p>The only thing that Rider worried about was that, if it came to light that Archer had also been involved with freeing the homunculus, Lancer might alienate Archer.</p><p>It would be troubling if their king and their strategist quarreled while they fought in the war from now on. If the issue was resolved with punishing a single reckless knight, the war front wouldn\u2019t collapse completely.</p><p>\u201CIt\u2019s fine this way. And in the first place, losing Saber doesn\u2019t mean that we\u2019ve lost yet. Right?\u201D</p><p>Rider grinned fearlessly.</p><p>\u201C\u2014Yes, that\u2019s right.\u201D</p><p>It was true that they had lost Saber. But, as long as Archer could devise a strategy, it didn\u2019t mean that their side\u2019s advantage had been completely undermined. If they threw Berserker of Red, Spartacus, onto the battlefield, it would certainly deal enormous damage to the enemy. It may have been completely by chance, but the strategy of capturing him had been the very best plan in that situation. If they had tried to destroy him without proper handling, they might have sustained far more large-scale damage.</p><p>However, it was certain that great care would have to be taken in handling Berserker of Red.</p><p>\u201C\u2026Even so, I never thought Saber would do such a thing.\u201D</p><p>\u201CYeah, me too. Yeah, maybe I should have talked to him more. I regret not doing so now.\u201D</p><p>\u201CThat would have been difficult since his Master Gordes forbade him from talking.\u201D</p><p>\u201CAh\u2026\u201D</p><p>Saber\u2019s greatest misfortune was probably having that guy of all the magi among the Yggdmillennia as his Master. It was extremely unlucky for that rare hero to serve under such a coward\u2026 err, cautious Master, thought Rider with a sigh.</p><p>\u201CIn any case, did he make it out safe and sound?\u201D</p><p>\u201CYeah. Maybe it\u2019s due to taking in Saber\u2019s heart? His height and features became quite splendid and heroic too. If he\u2019s like that, he\u2019ll be fine. By my diagnosis, he\u2019ll live for a hundred years.\u201D</p><p>\u201CHoh,\u201D said Archer as he showed a rare display of surprise.</p><p>\u201CI heard that Saber\u2026 Siegfried gained a steel body due to being bathed in the blood of a dragon, and that the blood circulated through his body due to swallowing it. The heart is an internal organ that sends blood through the body, so the blood of a dragon might have been mixed in with it as a result.\u201D</p><p>\u201CIt must be nice, being a dragon slayer. I also want the title of dragon slayer!\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2014At any rate. If it\u2019s him, he should be able to make a compromise with the world and live successfully.\u201D</p><p>Archer and Rider felt no unease in that regard. Among the many homunculi within this fortress, he was the only one that had boldly shown his own desire to \u2018live\u2019.</p><p>No matter what difficult circumstances he came to face, he\u2019d probably live bravely.</p><p>\u201CEven so. Why did you go that far to help him, Archer?\u201D</p><p>\u201CWe are, after all, transient ghosts without flesh. It would be nice if\u2014there was even a single being that we etched into this world, don\u2019t you think?\u201D</p><p>There was only gentleness in Archer\u2019s voice.</p><p>\u201CI think that you should have been the one to become our king.\u201D</p><p>Rider whispered something so dangerous that Lancer would have had to kill him if he heard it. Archer shook his head with a bitter smile.</p><p>\u201CI\u2019m not good at bearing the full brunt of responsibility.\u201D</p><p>Rider sighed at those words and lamented, \u201CThis isn\u2019t going to go well.\u201D</p><hr><p>It was a good thing he had time to spare. Sieg thought that while walking. It had been difficult to even vaguely think of something while walking with a body that previously would become exhausted and feel pain just by taking steps.</p><p>Since the Bounded Field was functioning, the forest remained silent as usual. There were no signs of any living creatures. He\u2019d already gained considerable distance from the fortress. Even if the Yggdmillennia knew vaguely where he was within the Boundary Field, they wouldn\u2019t go to the extent of expressly chasing after him.</p><p>When he had nearly climbed halfway up the mountain, the light voices of birds started to leak out. That meant the Bounded Field that drove away living creatures didn\u2019t function here. It was still gloomy due to the large trees clustered around each other, but it appeared that dawn would arrive soon. Through that, he calculated that he\u2019d been walking for several hours, but his body still showed no signs of being tired. Even though his clothing was too thin and sparse for mountain climbing in the late fall, he didn\u2019t even feel chilly.</p><p>Even if he had become healthier now, this was still a bit abnormal. Sieg conjectured that it was most likely due to the power of Saber of Black, Siegfried\u2019s heart.</p><p>\u2026He wanted more concerns to think about, so that he could surrender his mind to complicated and mysterious equations. If he did that, he could escape, even if only slightly, the unidentified haze that had been coiling through his mind since earlier which still hadn\u2019t gone away.</p><p>His progress was still slow, but even so\u2014as he kept going forward, a road appeared before he had noticed it.</p><p>Crossing over the mountain, Sieg sighted a village too small to be called a town far below. Unlike Trifas, the influence of the Yggdmillennia magi shouldn\u2019t reach here.</p><p>It probably wouldn\u2019t even take him a day to take control of the villagers\u2019 minds through suggestion. In other words, he could obtain a peaceful and ordinary life in that village. Or he could also use it as a stepping stone to go to another town or even another country.</p><p>So if he took this single step forward, that life would begin the moment he did so. He would be able to live, obtain something, or find a wish for himself.</p><p>Being able to live such a life was called\u2014[freedom].</p><p>It was wonderful. It was full of good things. No matter what may happen, there was nothing as bad as his previous life, and if he could change things for the better, he just needed to take this first step forward.</p><p>For the sake of this single step, a hero had given him his life. Another hero had healed him. And another hero still had walked alongside him.</p><p>It was all for the sake of this single step.</p><p>But why? Why did his feet refuse to take that step forward?</p><p>He sighed. He couldn\u2019t seem to shake off the haze in his mind. Did living as a human being mean that this haziness would accompany him for his entire life?</p><p>Regardless, he somehow managed to raise his foot forward and\u2014</p><p>\u2018Stop!\u2019</p><p>He frantically looked over his shoulder in response to the voice that restrained him, which was followed by a noise. The noise just now was definitely not natural. It was the sound of something heavy falling down.</p><p>Was it a pursuer? But there was no sign of magecraft being used, and he didn\u2019t sense the enormous prana of a Servant. Although he hesitated slightly, Sieg decided that it should be fine to at least see the owner of the voice, and so he turned back.</p><p>He broke off a bit from the mountain path and pushed through the forest. I think the sound came from around here, he thought as he looked around\u2014and found it.</p><p>In that instant, his soul was snatched away.</p><p>\u201C\u2014\u2014\u201D</p><p>He couldn\u2019t even let out a sigh of wonder. He just looked at the girl who was leaning her body against a tall tree as she crouched in exhaustion.</p><p>Illuminated by the faint light of daybreak that leaked through the gaps between the trees, her slightly swaying hair shone like golden silk threads. Her amethyst-colored eyes were completely pure as they looked at him, rousing an unnecessary feeling of guilt in Sieg.</p><p>She didn\u2019t have the precise and molded beauty of a homunculus, or the kind of cuteness that made one\u2019s heart flutter just by being nearby like Rider. She possessed a wondrous beauty that scarcely felt real.</p><p>The girl\u2019s body was clad in armor\u2014she was unmistakably a Servant. Regardless of whether she was with the Black or Red camp, she ought to be someone that he shouldn\u2019t become involved with.</p><p>If asked whether she was an enemy or an ally, he would definitely conclude that she was an enemy. And yet, the thought of getting away from her was far from his mind.</p><p>Was it like having one\u2019s eyes enraptured by a work of art? Without realizing it, Sieg had stepped over to the girl\u2019s side. The instant he tried to touch his hand to the girl\u2019s cheek as she leaned over, the sword hanging on his waist made a clinking sound as if to warn him.</p><p>They both remained silent. Meeting her gaze, Sieg\u2019s mind was in chaos. Now that he thought about it properly, what had he been about to do?</p><p>Extending his hand to touch a girl crouching down was an extremely vulgar act. Just as he was about to hurriedly pull back his hand, the girl suddenly grasped his hand with her own.</p><p>\u201CThank goodness\u2026 I managed to meet you!\u201D</p><p>The instant the girl smiled and said that, Sieg thought to himself: Even if this girl was his enemy\u2014or even if she cut off his head right here. Just being able to have seen that smiling face left him with no regrets.</p><hr><p>The holy maiden who had been summoned in this Great Holy Grail War as Ruler: Jeanne d\u2019Arc. She carefully inspected the parts of the forest that had been the stage for two fights, the battle between Berserker of Red and Lancer and Rider of Black and the battle between Rider and Archer of Red and Saber, Berserker and Archer of Black, and placed a hand to her chest in relief.</p><p>The destruction had been limited to trees mowed down in the midst of battle. Furthermore, the range of destruction through the forest wasn\u2019t extensive. If Lancer of Red\u2014the great hero Karna, who was clad in the sun itself\u2014had participated, the forest might have been turned into scorched earth.</p><p>Leaving aside the Masters of Black Faction who were secluding themselves in the Fortress of Millennia, she hadn\u2019t caught any sight of the Masters of the Red Faction who should have initiated the attack. But it wasn\u2019t that strange if she considered it from the viewpoint that this war was just starting to unfold. Masters in the Holy Grail War mainly consisted of magi, so they likely wouldn\u2019t be experienced with battle itself.</p><p>\u201C\u2026In any case, it was a normal battle.\u201D</p><p>Yes. Though the number of Servants was large, the battle was conducted normally. Archer who sniped from long range, Berserker who charged forward, Caster who controlled golems through magecraft, Lancer who summoned stakes and skewered the enemy\u2014including Rider and Saber as well, none of them were absurd Servants who slipped from the limitations of Heroic Spirits. That went for both the Black and Red Servants.</p><p>\u2026Of course, since they were Servants, their power was tremendous. Rider of Red especially stood out among them. By Ruler\u2019s estimation, he boasted ability and power that rivaled Lancer of Red\u2019s.</p><p>That was understandable. After all, he was a great and famous hero. The progress of a battle completely changed just due to his existence. Should Rider and Lancer both be present on the battlefield, the Red side would be superior in terms of the [quality] of Servants.</p><p>Naturally, that was only a comparison in simple power. The affinities between Servants, the abilities of their Noble Phantasms, magecraft, location; there were countless factors to consider. Depending on what kind of Servants the still unseen Assassin of Black, Saber of Red, Caster of Red and Assassin of Red were, the situation could change further still\u2026</p><p>At any rate, the situation was fixed to the limits of a normal Holy Grail War. Even if it dissolved into an all-out battle between all fourteen Servants, the town of Trifas was isolated from the outside with its population of twenty thousand. If she used her privilege as Ruler, she could also likely limit any damage done to the minimum.</p><p>There weren\u2019t any suspicious factors. There weren\u2019t any, but\u2014</p><p>Nonetheless, a sense of doubt whose source she just couldn\u2019t grasp whirled within her heart. She had held out through the night like this and investigated the traces from the battles, but in the end she hadn\u2019t obtained any clues. The only clue that she obtained was the fact that Lancer of Red had come to take her out. Ruler also understood quite well that Lancer of Red possessed a pure and noble character. As such, it was probably due to the order of his Master that he had tried to kill her.</p><p>\u2026As expected, she needed to make contact with the Masters of the Red Faction somehow.</p><p>In any case, tonight\u2019s battle was over now\u2026 The moment she thought that, her body lost a little strength\u2026 It appeared that she was \u2018sleepy\u2019. To put it more accurately, it wasn\u2019t Ruler, Jeanne, who was sleepy. The one who required sleep was, in the end, only Laeticia\u2019s body. However, in the first place, Servants lacked the ability to sleep. Perhaps due to that gap, it was somehow a refreshing urge for her.</p><p>\u201CUgh, no\u2026 not yet\u2026\u201D</p><p>This sleepiness was not something that Jeanne could deal with just through willpower. She had to return to the town and make it all the way to the church and the bed in the attic there. But her body was rapidly wishing for sleep too much.</p><p>She leaned her hand against the trunk of a large tree, and when that turned out to be not enough, she reluctantly punched her cheek. The pain managed to clear her mind\u2026 A physical body was truly inconvenient. Due to her incomplete summoning, she could endure it for long periods of time, but if she crossed over the limit, she would probably lose consciousness like a switch being cut.</p><p>Leaving the matter of finding a way to deal with this problem for the future, for now she used the holy water she carried and once more began identifying the location of each Servant. If she found no problems, she would end her work here for tonight.</p><p>Five of the Black Servants and one of the Red Servants were located in the fortress. The Red Servant should be Berserker. It had been a large capture operation, but it appeared he had succeeded in safely changing Masters. This was not a violation of the rules, as changing to different Masters or Servants was a natural occurrence\u2014no, wait.</p><p>\u201CThere\u2019s one missing\u2026?\u201D</p><p>There should have been six Black Servants in the fortress. What had happened to the last one? She expanded her search range further and further, but she couldn\u2019t find the sixth one.</p><p>\u2026She had a bad premonition. That Servant had died\u2014was not what had happened. If one of the fourteen Servants lost, Ruler would definitely be able to sense it intuitively. At present, no Servants had been defeated.</p><p>But something was strange. It wasn\u2019t her intuition as the Servant Ruler, but her instincts as Jeanne d\u2019Arc that whispered to her that something had occurred somewhere without her knowledge.</p><p>She had to locate the last Servant as quickly as possible. But how to search? Should she go out and search aimlessly?</p><p>She wouldn\u2019t find anything that way. Ruler felt certain of that. God helps those who help themselves, so searching blindly would merely be acting without thinking.</p><p>In that case\u2014she looked at the fortress where the other five Servants were gathered. Questioning them would be more constructive.</p><p>At the very least, the Black camp had to bring her over to their side, so they probably would not try to kill her without even attempting to talk like the Red camp.</p><p>It might be wishful thinking, but nothing would start if she didn\u2019t act. Ruler decided to proceed squarely towards the fortress right to the front door.</p><p>The fortress towered on top of a slightly elevated hill that lorded over Trifas. Its silhouette faintly stood out against the black of night, reminiscent of a huge kettle in hell within which squirmed the souls of the departed. Its majesty was far too mismatched with the small town with a population of twenty thousand, but the inhabitants of the town didn\u2019t even consider using it as a sightseeing landmark. One reason was that this fortress was not a public building, but rather a private building built on private property\u2026 but most of all, it was because all the inhabitants of the town were afraid of this fortress.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t that they thought it was cursed. The ones who ruled Trifas lived in this castle. The inhabitants generally perceived it that way, and in reality, that assumption was correct.</p><p>Standing before the castle gate, Ruler twisted her head to look up. The fortress possessed not even a fragment of artistry, and its stubborn structure made it in effect difficult to assault and easy to defend. However, that was not the true special characteristic of this fortress.</p><p>She softly touched the castle wall. Instantly, a slight numbness ran through her. It was probably a spell that contained both strong interference and detection magecraft. Due to the countless magical defences that covered the surface of the wall, even a Servant would probably require a suitable destructive force to make this fortress fall.</p><p>When Ruler stood before the castle gate, the gate started automatically opening before she had even named herself. The door opened with a tremble, and on the other side of it stood a single \u2018old person\u2019 with a staff in his hand.</p><p>\u201CYou are a magus of Yggdmillennia, correct? I am\u2014\u201D</p><p>\u201CThe mediator of this Great Holy Grail War, Jeanne d\u2019Arc-sama. It is truly the highest honor to meet the famous holy maiden. My name is Darnic Prestone Yggdmillennia. I serve as the chief of the magi that reside in the Fortress of Millennia.\u201D</p><p>Forestalling her introduction, Darnic gave an exaggerated bow. His use of her true name was probably a warning rather than an attempt to show familiarity. But then, the fact that her true name was known to others didn\u2019t matter to her. Rather, if she didn\u2019t disclose her true name, it would probably be difficult for every Master and Servant to place trust in her. That was why she had given her name as Jeanne at the church.</p><p>\u201C\u2026I\u2019ll say this just in case, but I don\u2019t intend to support either the Black or Red camps in the Great Holy Grail War. I have only come here because there are two or three things I wish to ask you about.\u201D</p><p>Darnic responded to Jeanne\u2019s words of indifference without losing his smile.</p><p>\u201CNaturally, I am aware of this. However, for the time being, please come meet my lord first. He\u2019s been in a good mood since we received the report that you came.\u201D</p><p>\u201CLord\u2026?\u201D</p><p>Darnic nodded and spoke with a smile that gripped Ruler with wariness.</p><p>\u201CThe sovereign of Wallachia, Vlad III, is my Servant, Lancer of Black.\u201D</p><p>As Ruler walked through a stone-paved hallway with Darnic leading the way, servants came and went in either direction and bowed to them one by one as they passed. Ruler realized they were homunculi from their excessively uniform looks, behavior and Magic Circuits within their bodies.</p><p>\u201CWe thought it was best to keep the number of humans involved down to the absolute minimum.\u201D</p><p>Darnic murmured those words as they walked. This followed the fundamental rule of the Holy Grail War to avoid involving unrelated humans as much as possible. But\u2014</p><p>\u201CHomunculi are also unrelated lives no different from anyone else.\u201D</p><p>Ruler curtly replied.</p><p>By its nature, the Holy Grail War was both the smallest and greatest war in the world. Seven Masters and Seven Servants should have been sufficient for it to be conducted\u2026 Though this time, the circumstances differed far too much.</p><p>\u201CHoh. So as a saint, you also work your hardest for artificial life forms. Then have we violated your rules?\u201D</p><p>Darnic gave her a sarcastic smile, and Ruler\u2019s expression stiffened slightly as she responded.</p><p>\u201C\u2014I won\u2019t go as far as to say that.\u201D</p><p>\u2026But, considering the current scale of battle, it could be argued that employing homunculi like this couldn\u2019t be helped. It was true that there was no room for Ruler to judge it as a violation of the rules. She couldn\u2019t force them, and it was difficult to call the homunculi children. They had merely been created that way.</p><p>\u201CUnlike our enemy, the Association of Magi, the existence of our clan hangs in the balance. I would appreciate it if you would take that point into account.\u201D</p><p>The door connecting to the throne room opened.</p><p>\u201CGuh.\u201D</p><p>Although Ruler leaked out that faint mutter, she stepped into the throne room without hesitation. Sitting on the throne was Lancer of Black\u2014Vlad III. And from among the Black Servants who followed him, Archer, Berserker and Caster stood in reserve nearby.</p><p>Furthermore, golems and homunculi carrying halberds were also lined up in the room with them.</p><p>\u2026Their presence was miniscule as a threat, but even so, their combined hostility as a group created an intimidating air on its own. However, Ruler had experience with being surrounded on all sides by enemies during her lifetime.</p><p>Not especially worked up by it, Ruler calmly stepped forward to the king. Since she wasn\u2019t a retainer, she didn\u2019t bow her head, but the king didn\u2019t raise a single eyebrow at it.</p><p>\u201CI am the Servant Ruler summoned as the mediator in this Great Holy Grail War, Jeanne d\u2019Arc.\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2014Hmm. It\u2019s reassuring to have a mediator who believes in the same God as I.\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2026Since I believe in God, I pray that I can convey to you that I aim to be fair and impartial.\u201D</p><p>The edges of Lancer of Black\u2019s mouth loosened into a smile at Ruler\u2019s resolute gaze. He probably thought her words were the nonsense of a foolish country girl.</p><p>\u201CNow then, dawn is almost upon us. First of all, what is your business here, mediator?\u201D</p><p>\u201CYou battled against the Red Servants earlier this night, correct? The opponents should have been Rider, Archer and Berserker of Red.\u201D</p><p>\u201CYes, what of it?\u201D</p><p>\u201CIn the end, it appears that the battle concluded with Rider and Archer withdrawing and Berserker being captured\u2014but just what happened after that?\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2026\u201D</p><p>Archer of Black reacted slightly to Ruler\u2019s question. No, it wasn\u2019t just him. A slight agitation was also visible among the halberd-wielding homunculi.</p><p>But the one who showed the most dramatic reaction was Lancer of Black.</p><p>\u201C\u2026How unpleasant.\u201D</p><p>Just by Lancer saying that, the throne room was filled with killing intent. It was unreasonable like a child\u2019s temper tantrum, but its power was equal to a wide-range, saturation-fire weapon. Ruler nonchalantly accepted the killing intent released by a weapon with its own will.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t as bad as the ill will she had received when she had sought an audience with the Crown Prince Charles at the Ch\xE2teau de Chinon despite being a mere village girl, or when she was imprisoned and put on trial for heresy. If there was even the slightest uncertainty, it was that it was greater than when she had been executed.</p><p>\u201CIf you cannot provide an answer, it can\u2019t be helped. Our conversation ends here. I\u2019ll go and investigate it on my own.\u201D</p><p>The instant she was about to turn her back to him, Lancer\u2019s killing intent immediately softened.</p><p>\u201C\u2014Pardon me. It seems that I teased you a little too much.\u201D</p><p>Even Ruler couldn\u2019t help but be stunned that Lancer called the killing intent just now \u2018teasing\u2019. No, perhaps he was telling the truth. To a king, all human emotions were a part of his rule. For example, he cried for his retainers even though he felt no sadness and he accepted tributes even though he felt no happiness from it. Perhaps anger was also just a mere performance for him.</p><p>\u201CSaber committed suicide.\u201D</p><p>\u201CWha\u2026\u201D</p><p>Even Ruler was left speechless at those dispassionately spoken words. Lancer of Black shook his head and sighed as if sad.</p><p>She promptly stopped shut her mouth as she started to say, \u201CThat\u2019s impossi\u2014\u201D. \u2026It appeared that he was telling the truth when he said that Saber of Black, Siegfried, had lost his life. But there was a contradiction. Saber of Black was on the verge of death, but he was still alive.</p><p>\u2026There was no way a Master wouldn\u2019t be able to sense the state his or her Servant. If that situation were to arise, it was probably because the Servant\u2019s line had been severed.</p><p>But Ruler\u2019s perception ability exceeded that of the [spirit board]. True, it was feeble, but she could affirm that Saber of Black hadn\u2019t completely disconnected with this world. It was unclear where exactly he was, but\u2014in any case, he should still be alive.</p><p>\u201CWho would be able to explain the situation more concretely?\u201D</p><p>\u201CThe one who reported it was Rider of Black, Astolfo\u2026 It appears that he instigated it, though, so he\u2019s been incarcerated in the dungeon as punishment.\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2026Is that so?\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2014Now then. Ruler, I\u2019ll speak frankly. The swordsman who could truly be called a vital cornerstone for us has been meaninglessly lost. Therefore, I want to replenish my forces with a fighter of equal power as Saber. Is that not only natural?\u201D</p><p>Ruler frowned as the conversation seemed to turn suspicious.</p><p>\u201CAs I said before, I am Ruler. I am this war\u2019s absolute mediator summoned by the Holy Grail\u2026 I have my own objective, and it does not involve joining you all.\u201D</p><p>\u201CDo not you have a wish? Since you were summoned by the Holy Grail, you should have a wish of your own.\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2014The Ruler class is an exception in this regard as well. Since Ruler is summoned as a mediator, possessing no wishes to be fulfilled in the present age is one of the qualifications for the class.\u201D</p><p>Those words caused a slight disturbance among the other Servants.</p><p>\u201C\u2026Ruler, you have no wish?\u201D</p><p>\u201CYes, I have none.\u201D</p><p>Lancer struck his throne\u2019s armrest in irritation. Standing up, his former madness was unconcealed as he shouted angrily.</p><p>\u201CJeanne d\u2019Arc. I know of your last moments! There is no way that you, who were betrayed by everyone, had everything taken away from you and met a violent death, do not have a wish! Answer me! I won\u2019t allow any falsehoods!\u201D</p><p>If his previous killing intent was like a wide-range, saturation-fire weapon, his words this time were sharp like a stake. She could tell that the instant she lied or gave an answer Lancer could not accept, she would be skewered.</p><p>Ruler gazed at Lancer for a short while, and then spoke in a voice so calm it overpowered him.</p><p>\u201CI have no wish. Everyone says that I should regret my last moments. That I probably wish for revenge, or wish to be saved. However\u2014it\u2019s enough if I alone know the life that I lived. It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t have sympathy for others, but at the very least, I don\u2019t have even a single regret regarding my life, and I have no wish to make to the Holy Grail. If I were to have one, it would only be that this Holy Grail War be conducted correctly.\u201D</p><p>\u201CYou say that after having been forsaken even by God?\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2014That in itself is foolishness. The Lord did not forsake us. No, in the first place, the Lord has never forsaken a single person. There was just nothing he could do.\u201D</p><p>\u201CWhat\u2026?\u201D</p><p>\u201CPraying, giving offerings, everything is an act not for oneself, but for the Lord. We pray in order to heal the Lord\u2019s laments and sorrow. Yes, I definitely\u2014\u201D</p><p>I definitely heard the Lord\u2019s lament.</p><p>He shrieked. He lamented. He wept, and he felt sorrow.</p><p>The world changed straight into hell, and no one could stop it. No, perhaps that itself\u2014was hell.</p><p>The Lord lamented in sorrow. People were not even allowed to live simply, and were compelled to become either beasts or food.</p><p>Conflict never ended, and blood continued to rain incessantly and soak the land.</p><p>That\u2019s why the Lord lamented\u2014I heard His voice. I caught His small, feeble murmurs that everyone else failed to hear.</p><p>It was an obvious thing. To lend my ears to His voice and respond to it meant that I would throw away everything I had until now.</p><p>I had to throw away my life as a simple villager and the joy of loving someone and being loved back. Furthermore, there would be no compensation. I would surely be scorned by many people\u2014both enemies and allies alike.</p><p>It was a very terrifying thing to contemplate. It was mad for a mere village girl from the countryside to leap onto the battlefield where people\u2019s killing intent swirled about.</p><p>\u2014But the Lord cried.</p><p>Yes, I surely\u2026 can\u2019t bear it. I can\u2019t turn my back on His cries.</p><p>In order to stop the Lord\u2019s tears and soothe Him, I will oppose this world\u2019s hell. I will clad my body in armor, hang a sword on my waist, carry the flag\u2014and devote my life to it.</p><p>Yes, the voice of revelation I received from the Lord contained no glory or victory, no obligation or sense of purpose. The Lord merely lamented and grieved.</p><p>\u2014That\u2019s why. At the very least, having received that revelation, I thought I should stop the Lord\u2019s laments.</p><p>Lancer of Black glared fixedly at Ruler for a while, but eventually he shook his head and sat back down.</p><p>\u201C\u2014It seems that, even though we believe in the same God, we are incompatible.\u201D</p><p>\u201CThere are those who burned me at the stake even though they believed in the same God as me. So it\u2019s only natural.\u201D</p><p>Ruler spoke with a composed expression. Lancer of Black smiled pleasantly at those excessively joking words.</p><p>\u201C\u2026It can\u2019t be helped. But it\u2019s a fact that a Red Servant tried to kill you. We merely wish to win you over, but it seems they are different.\u201D</p><p>\u201CSo it seems. I also must investigate what the Red camp is thinking. I don\u2019t intend to oppose them but\u2014\u201D</p><p>\u201CIt\u2019s a different story if they attack you.\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2026That\u2019s correct.\u201D</p><p>\u201CI\u2019ll pray that the Red camp consists of fools aiming to kill you, then.\u201D</p><p>Lancer said that and smiled once more.</p><p>Ruler exited the throne room and headed directly for the dungeon. Both Berserker of Red who had been captured in battle and one of the Black Servants were present there. According to Lancer, it appeared to be Rider of Black.</p><p>The atmosphere within the dungeon made it obvious that it hadn\u2019t been used in a long time. Nearly all of the eight cells present were filled with nothing but rotted wood, straw and spider webs.</p><p>In one cell, Berserker of Red was imprisoned with his body completely sealed in a wax-like fluid. Even though he had changed Masters, that didn\u2019t mean that the Black side could simply leave him to take care of himself\u2026 Though even in this situation, his unchanging smile was very eerie.</p><p>Now then, the problem was the Servant who was imprisoned in the last remaining cell.</p><p>\u201C\u2014Oh? Who might you be?\u201D</p><p>The young boy tilted his head with a puzzled expression. It was a casual gesture, but right now he was even more firmly sealed up than Berserker. The sight of him with stakes driven into his arms and legs was quite painful to look at.</p><p>\u201CYou are Rider of Black, correct? I am the Servant Ruler, Jeanne d\u2019Arc. I was summoned by the Holy Grail to carry out the management of the Great Holy Grail War.\u201D</p><p>When Ruler told him that, Rider nodded with a \u201CYeah\u201D in understanding.</p><p>\u201CNow that you mention it, I did hear that such a Servant was summoned. But are you for real? You\u2019re not a Red Servant?\u201D</p><p>When Rider gave her a doubtful look and a smile that said, Things have gotten interesting, Ruler took a short time to ponder, and then removed her gauntlet and rolled up her sleeve to show him \u2018that\u2019.</p><p>\u201CWoah\u2026\u201D</p><p>\u201CIs this sufficient as proof?\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2026It is. Yeah, you\u2019re definitely Ruler. I see, so that\u2019s the \u2018privilege\u2019 of Ruler. How nice, I want it!\u201D</p><p>Rider nodded repeatedly in understanding.</p><p>\u201CIt\u2019s fortunate you understand. Now then, Rider. I apologize for this, but there\u2019s something I wish to question you about.\u201D</p><p>\u201CSure, sure. I\u2019ll answer anything as long as it\u2019s within my power, so go right ahead.\u201D</p><p>Rider replied in his unwavering light manner.</p><p>\u201C\u2026Did Saber of Black, Siegfried, really commit suicide?\u201D</p><p>\u201CYeah, that\u2019s right.\u201D</p><p>\u2026But that shouldn\u2019t be possible. Whether it was Saber or anyone else, all fourteen Servants were present in this world. She intuitively knew that he was \u2018alive\u2019. Ruler knew this for certain. He still walked this earth.</p><p>\u201CI\u2019m sorry, could you please explain in a little more detail?\u201D</p><p>\u201CSure. You came at just the right time. I can\u2019t stand all this free time.\u201D</p><p>Smiling, Rider started talking about Saber. It was far from a heroic tale, and more like the story of a saint. And he spoke of the homunculus, the nameless boy saved by that hero. He told of how the boy had sought freedom and departed.</p><p>\u201CWell, after this and that, I ended up being tied up all by my lonesome in this place. No, I do have Berserker of Red as a neighbor, but talking doesn\u2019t work with him\u2026 You doing good over there?\u201D</p><p>When Rider of Black called out, there was a response from the cell next door.</p><p>\u201CI have no intention of flattering the dogs of political power. Though, I will answer your question. I\u2019m doing fine. Now, it would be perfect if you could just remove these restraints\u2014\u201D</p><p>\u201CThat\u2019s for another time.\u201D</p><p>It was a startling development, but at the same time Ruler finally understood.</p><p>\u201C\u2026Saber has definitely disappeared. But he gave his [heart] to that homunculus.\u201D</p><p>It wasn\u2019t a mere sword or suit of armor assembled out of prana, or something small like a piece of hair. It was a heart, the internal organ that was just as important as the brain for humans. The spiritual core of Servants also existed in the heart and brain. Personally gouging out one\u2019s heart and giving it to another was an act without precedent in the past Holy Grail Wars.</p><p>Furthermore, the one who had given his heart was Saber of Black\u2026 in other words, the immortal hero Siegfried, who was bathed in the blood of a dragon and obtained a body close to that of the Dragon-kind. It wouldn\u2019t be strange if it had some kind of effect on the homunculus\u2019 body.</p><p>\u201CYeah. I parted with him there. After that, he headed towards the mountain road. I saw a village over there when I took my Hippogriff out for a test ride, so I guess he\u2019d be there now?\u201D</p><p>\u201CI see. I understand now. Thank you.\u201D</p><p>After Ruler gave her thanks, Rider of Black made a very complicated expression and asked a question of his own.</p><p>\u201C\u2026Are you going to meet him?\u201D</p><p>\u201CYes. If what you say is correct, there is no one else but him who could be radiating the presence of a Servant.\u201D</p><p>\u201CI know, but I\u2019d like it if you didn\u2019t involve him in this war.\u201D</p><p>Rider, who had given an optimistic smile earlier, suddenly glared at Ruler with eyes that concealed a slight hostility and a strong determination. Ruler caught a glimpse of an extremely strong will within those eyes.</p><p>\u201C\u2026I understand. If what you say is correct, then he is certainly just a victim. As long as he doesn\u2019t wish otherwise, I do not intend to excessively interfere with him.\u201D</p><p>Rider sighed with relief, and his hostility vanished like mist all at once.</p><p>\u201CI\u2019m relieved to hear that. Yeah, if he can survive and live, ending up like this is worth it.\u201D</p><p>As Rider whispered that, Ruler asked Rider about one point that was still unclear.</p><p>\u201CRider. Why did Saber save that homunculus? If you were the one in Saber\u2019s position, I would understand. Since you\u2019re Astolfo, one of Charlemagne\u2019s Twelve Paladins\u2014\u201D</p><p>If the one who saved the homunculus was Astolfo, who sacrificed himself to chivalry and yet possessed a bottomless soft-hearted nature, it would be more understandable. But Saber of Black was Siegfried. He was a member of royalty, a prince of the Netherlands. Protecting the lamenting weak and taking down the strong who lived in luxury was a suitable act for a Heroic Spirit. However, even that had a limit. Since he was a Servant summoned in the Holy Grail War, he should have had a wish to make upon the Holy Grail. At the very least, it was careless to go as far as to sacrifice his life to save a single person who wasn\u2019t even his Master.</p><p>To a Servant, participating in the Holy Grail War meant gaining a second life, a one-in-a-million miracle. It was not natural to so easily throw it away\u2014and for a homunculus he didn\u2019t even know at that.</p><p>\u201CEven if we\u2019re Servants, that doesn\u2019t mean we repeat the same things we did in life. Rather, there are a lot of guys who try to do something different in order to wipe away the regrets from when they were alive\u2026 Well, it probably ends in failure most of the time, though.\u201D</p><p>Heroes were heroes due to what they achieved in life. No one wished for what they couldn\u2019t accomplish in life.</p><p>\u201C\u2026Thank you for everything. I pray that you will be victorious in this war.\u201D</p><p>\u201CEh? Are you favoring me?\u201D</p><p>Ruler chuckled and shook her head at his question.</p><p>\u201CNo. I merely pray for all the participants to be successful.\u201D</p><p>\u201CHey, hey, don\u2019t speak nonsense, Ruler. It\u2019s the principle of the Holy Grail War that there can only be one winner, you know?\u201D</p><p>\u201CThat\u2019s correct. \u2014Even so, I pray that everyone will be victorious.\u201D</p><p>Ruler quietly left the dungeon. Left alone once more, Rider of Black suddenly remembered Saber\u2019s last moments.</p><p>Had that man, who sacrificed himself to save the homunculus without hesitation and smiled in satisfaction at the end, been \u2018victorious\u2019?</p><p>It would be nice if that were so\u2014no, it had to be so. Rider thought that from the bottom of his heart.</p><p>The one that guided her out was not Darnic, but a female homunculus servant this time. Silently walking with quiet and precise steps, the homunculus truly did resemble a doll.</p><p>\u201CIs it all right if I ask you something?\u201D</p><p>The homunculus replied without stopping or nodding at Ruler\u2019s question.</p><p>\u201CI don\u2019t mind. Please go ahead.\u201D</p><p>\u201CAre you homunculi participating in the Great Holy Grail War because you wish so?\u201D</p><p>\u201COf course. That is the wish of our master who created us, after all.\u201D</p><p>It was an indifferent and smooth answer. \u201CI see,\u201D replied Ruler. \u2026At the very least, it did not deviate from the rules of the Holy Grail War. It was by the will of both these homunculi and the golems that they acted to obey their master. Even if they were manufactured\u2014it was still by their own will.</p><p>Therefore, she had to respect their wishes.</p><p>\u201CI can make my way from here. Thank you very much.\u201D</p><p>When they finally arrived at the castle gate, Ruler politely stated her thanks. Gazing at her with transparent eyes, the homunculus bowed deeply. And the instant Ruler turned around and was about to depart, the homunculus cleared her throat slightly in hesitation and called out to her.</p><p>\u201CDid he commit some kind of wrongdoing?\u201D</p><p>Turning back around, Ruler tilted her head at the unexpected question.</p><p>\u201CHe?\u201D</p><p>\u201CI mean \u2018him\u2019. The homunculus who brought about the death of my master\u2019s Servant, Saber.\u201D</p><p>There was no turmoil or emotion in her eyes\u2026 or so she had thought, but when Ruler observed carefully, she caught a glimpse of something like concern for \u2018him\u2019 in her eyes.</p><p>\u201CNo. From what I\u2019ve heard, Saber merely responded to his wish to \u2018live\u2019. Wishing to live is never a sin.\u201D</p><p>She declared that not as Ruler, but as a human being. No matter how evil one may be, the wish to live itself was not wrong. The crime of living and committing evil was another matter, though.</p><p>\u201C\u2026Thank you very much.\u201D</p><p>The homunculus\u2019 expression relaxed just a little. Yes, these homunculi truly were \u2018alive\u2019\u2014Ruler sighed. Their fates were almost completely determined. Their compensation as hurriedly constructed life forms was a considerably short life.</p><p>But, precisely because she was Ruler, she could do nothing about it. She had not been granted the right to take up arms for those who did not wish for salvation.</p><p>Pulling herself together, Ruler began walking in the direction of the mountain that Rider had spoken of earlier.</p><p>Although Rider of Black had recounted what he saw earlier, the bad premonition that had been clinging to her since earlier wouldn\u2019t go away. It wasn\u2019t actually rare for a Servant to self-destruct in the Holy Grail War. The circumstances varied, but for the Berserker class, there were many cases of the mad Servant self-destructing due to exhausting its prana supply. There were also Servants that used powerful Noble Phantasms and accidentally destroyed their Masters in their wake.</p><p>Though it was a rare case, there were also Servants that chose to kill themselves for the sake of their Master, and soft-hearted Servants that deployed their Noble Phantasms in order to protect innocent citizens.</p><p>But something was different this time. Saber had gouged out his own heart, and there were no anecdotes of him doing so in life\u2014but that wasn\u2019t the reason she felt this way. Something was fundamentally different. That was only natural; after all, there now should have been only thirteen Servants left now.</p><p>So why did she feel that there were still fourteen Servants left? Why did she think that Saber of Black was still [alive]? There really was something strange about this Great Holy Grail War. Something had gone amiss. Wasn\u2019t that homunculus partially responsible for that?</p><p>No, that was merely conjecture. She didn\u2019t know for sure. She didn\u2019t know, so for now, she could only chase after him and question him.</p><p>\u201CRider said he headed towards this mountain, but\u2026\u201D</p><p>The forest, covered entirely by a Boundary Field, was so silent and still that it hurt the ears. The homunculus wasn\u2019t emitting the presence of a Servant. In other words, she had to search for [someone] who was continuously walking to get out of the forest.</p><p>However\u2026 that might unexpectedly be difficult, she began to think. After all, the homunculus was running away from Yggdmillennia. He was probably sensitive to the presence of magi and Servants more than others.</p><p>Even if she called out to him, he likely wouldn\u2019t come out. There was a good chance that he would run away in fear.</p><p>The thought Should I stop him? rose through her mind. In the first place, the homunculus ran away because he didn\u2019t want to be involved in this war. To him, he probably could only think of her as a nightmare trying to bring him back into the war.</p><p>But\u2014</p><p>She gathered her prana and held it down enough to just barely negate the effects of the Boundary Field. This way, she wouldn\u2019t be detected as a Servant, and would probably be able to approach him close enough to see him with her own eyes.</p><p>But in this state, her physical abilities were no different from that of an ordinary human. Even if the moon was out, walking up a mountain road while relying on its hazy light to see was an act that would exhaust her body extraordinarily.</p><p>While settling down her rough breathing, she prayed that she would catch up with him and ascended the mountain road with determination.</p><p>Her eyes swam dizzily\u2014but she didn\u2019t have the time to spare worrying about it.</p><p>Each step she took exhausted her stamina greatly\u2014Just endure it a little longer, she thought to her body.</p><p>Why did she have to go through so much trouble? \u2014Because she wanted to meet him. The homunculus whom Rider of Black helped and Saber of Black sacrificed his life for without hesitation.</p><p>Was that all? \u2026That, that should have been enough. Then just what was this sense of duty and purpose that troubled her so much she was at her wits\u2019 end?</p><p>No, it was better not to think about it. For the time being, it was best to just conclude that she was trying to meet him out of her own will.</p><p>\u2026And yet, contrary to her mind, her body gradually lost that control.</p><p>It was probably Laeticia\u2019s human body. It had at last broken through the limit of its ability to continue moving, and was now only walking through Ruler\u2019s willpower. Cornered in this situation, she stifled the impatience in her heart. Walking through a mountain at night didn\u2019t mean that she could be negligent.</p><p>Resisting the temptation to sleep, she simply walked up the mountain. Perhaps due to severing the support provided by her prana, the weight of her armor was somewhat painful.</p><p>She continued to walk up the path that seemed to go on forever\u2014and then she finally caught sight of a hazy figure standing at a place near the summit of the mountain beyond which the forest ended.</p><p>\u201CAh\u2014\u201D</p><p>She sighed in relief\u2026 but, that seemed to be a fatal action on her part. Her vision darkened all at once and the world swayed.</p><p>No, I still\u2014I still have to endure it.</p><p>\u201CStop!\u201D</p><p>She reflexively called out to him. The thought I blundered flitted through her mind. Even though she had gone through so much trouble so as not to frighten him away, she had called out to him at the very last moment.</p><p>Her stamina was completely used up. Before she could form some kind of counterplan, her consciousness broke off. She crouched and leaned her back against a large tree nearby.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t move. Though she wasn\u2019t going to die, she could no longer move presently. Her body needed to surrender itself to sleep. But\u2014her shout a moment ago had probably made the homunculus think he was being pursued. If she didn\u2019t chase after him now, she would never get another chance to meet him.</p><p>She might have committed a fatal blunder. As Ruler regretted that in her heart, the faint sound of feet stepping on grass reached her ears.</p><p>It couldn\u2019t be, she thought as she raised her head. Her consciousness cleared just a little. A boy with fine, elegant features timidly extended his hand to her.</p><p>She grasped his arm at once, and whispered with a sigh of relief.</p><p>\u201CThank goodness\u2026 I managed to meet you!\u201D</p><p>\u2014And thus, the two met.</p><p>The girl who was a Servant yet had no Master, who merely devoted herself to administrating this Great Holy Grail War. The boy who was neither human nor a Servant, and who might not even be a homunculus. Both were outsiders in the ritual known as the Holy Grail War.</p><p>\u201CAh, um, err. I\u2019m not an enemy.\u201D</p><p>The girl apologetically muttered that, and the boy replied with a nod empty of ill will.</p><p>\u201C\u2026Somehow, I understand.\u201D</p><p>Despite staggering, the girl managed to lift herself up and, after correcting her seated posture, she introduced herself.</p><p>\u201CI am Jeanne d\u2019Arc, summoned in the Servant class of mediator\u2014Ruler\u2014for this Great Holy Grail War. There is something I wish to ask you, a homunculus formerly belonging to the Fortress of Millennia, but do you mind?\u201D</p><p>\u201CYeah, I have no problem with that.\u201D</p><p>\u201CDue to the special characteristic of the Ruler class, I can detect when any of the Servants participating in the war are defeated. Currently, I can confirm that all Servants are still present, However\u2014\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2026No. That\u2019s incorrect. Saber of Black died not long ago.\u201D</p><p>\u201CRider also told me that Saber had died. However, that shouldn\u2019t be. According to my senses, there are still fourteen Servants present. And you are emitting the presence of a Servant. But I understand now that I\u2019ve directly met you like this. You really aren\u2019t a Servant.\u201D</p><p>Ruler took off her gauntlet, and suddenly placed her hand on his chest. Ignoring his bewilderment and embarrassment, she confirmed the sound of his heartbeat.</p><p>\u201C\u2014It\u2019s beating strongly. It appears to be functioning no different from a normal heart. Thank goodness. He really didn\u2019t choose a mere meaningless death.\u201D</p><p>She sighed in relief. Then, she seemed to realize what she was doing, and frantically pulled back her hand and apologized profusely.</p><p>\u201CI\u2019m sorry, I just\u2014\u201D</p><p>\u201CNo, I don\u2019t really mind\u2026 Are there no problems with me?\u201D</p><p>The boy asked that somewhat uneasily, but Ruler shook her head and assured him, \u201CYou\u2019re fine.\u201D Frankly, his [heart] was functioning so perfectly it was unbelievable. If one excluded his Magic Circuits and his ability to perform magecraft, he was no different from an ordinary human.</p><p>\u201CIt\u2019s just as Rider of Black said. You are free.\u201D</p><p>When she said that, the homunculus\u2019 expression involuntarily clouded over. Seeing that, Ruler quizzically questioned him.</p><p>\u201CIs something wrong?\u201D</p><p>\u201CNo. I naturally understand the meaning of the word [freedom]. But\u2026 I don\u2019t know what I should do.\u201D</p><p>Sieg honestly spoke his worries. Ruler tilted her head in curiosity. She knew that Rider of Black had spoken happily of the boy\u2019s future when she was at the castle.</p><p>\u2018He\u2019ll surely go to the village and then use that as a stepping stone to go to a town. He\u2019ll come into contact with lots of people, move forward while being healed and wounded, and then come to love someone. Yeah, how wonderful!\u2019</p><p>When Ruler told him of Rider\u2019s words, he shook his head and denied that future.</p><p>\u201CYeah, certainly, if I\u2019m [free] now\u2014that is probably also a possibility for me. But for some reason, I don\u2019t feel the desire to do that at all.\u201D</p><p>He turned his face down, wearing a gloomy expression that conveyed his apologies to Rider. Ruler spoke up to comfort him.</p><p>\u201CA lot has just happened to you, so I don\u2019t think your feelings will simply change so soon afterwards\u2026 But perhaps you have a different wish?\u201D</p><p>\u201CA different, wish\u2026\u201D</p><p>The future he had been given by Rider was without a doubt attractive. But for some reason, he didn\u2019t feel attracted to it. So maybe there was a something else\u2026 a different future he wished for.</p><p>\u201CIf you say you have no dreams, then first you should experience freedom and then search for a dream. But, if you already have a dream\u2014you should express it honestly. That\u2019s what I think.\u201D</p><p>A dream, his own dream. What was it really? Closing his eyes\u2014Sieg thought back on his life. He had wished to live and escaped, asked for help, tried to escape in order to live and failed, and even though he had died once, he was revived like this and obtained freedom.</p><p>It was an extremely short life, but he had been blessed with much good fortune. Even though he was no different from the other homunculi\u2026 No, he had become different from the other homunculi. They died out without exception, and he lived.</p><p>It was simple to just say, \u2018It can\u2019t be helped\u2019, and end the matter there. With those words, he could simply cast them away. But, he absolutely couldn\u2019t say, \u2018It can\u2019t be helped\u2019. Earlier, in spite of being ordered to search for him, his fellow homunculi had purposefully overlooked him.</p><p>What was that happiness he felt when he heard about that from Rider afterwards? Was it not because he felt a bond with his fellow homunculi, who had overcome even their master\u2019s orders?</p><p>Then.</p><p>Then, it\u2019s easy to understand what my wish is.</p><p>I became free. That\u2019s why I want to free everyone else as well. Like how Rider, Saber and Archer gave me freedom.</p><p>Wish, my wish, my dream\u2026 is to save them. I want to save my former self\u2026 my fellow homunculi who will die at this rate.</p><p>They\u2019re immersed in that rotting juice, only able to feel frightened. It\u2019s normal for all living things to have death as a fixed part of their future, but for it be decided that they couldn\u2019t do anything until then is just too unreasonable and sad.</p><p>Like how Rider saved me, I\u2019ll save them. If I do that, I feel like I\u2019ll be able to stick out my chest with pride if I ever meet Rider again. I\u2019ll be able to say that I saved everyone else who wished for freedom\u2014</p><p>They said, \u2018please save us\u2019. I heard them. I can\u2019t act as if I didn\u2019t hear them and run away from it. Upon this pride entrusted to me by a hero, that is the one thing I can never do.</p><p>\u201C\u2026I want to save them.\u201D</p><p>\u201CWho do you want to save?\u201D</p><p>\u201CMy comrades, those who are the same kind of being as me. Those who can\u2019t even cry out even though they begged to be saved. The ones who live just to die without even being able to expect help.\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2026You mean to say you will save the homunculi in that castle?\u201D</p><p>Sieg nodded at Ruler\u2019s question.</p><p>\u201CBut\u2026 that isn\u2019t what Rider wanted, right?\u201D</p><p>Exactly, that Servant should have just wished for the homunculus to be happy. For him to have a peaceful life without battle.</p><p>\u201CI know\u2026 But, that peaceful, ordinary life. That dream\u2026 isn\u2019t my dream.\u201D</p><p>Rider\u2019s feelings had truly made him happy. Even so, he wanted to do this.</p><p>\u201CI heard it. I heard their wish to \u2018someone\u2019 asking for help. I can\u2019t just live and turn my eyes away from that.\u201D</p><p>It was like a chain to him. The homunculus, having been saved by much good fortune, understood that joy very well. \u2026The great joy of having someone grasp the hand you held out. It was an emotion that the other homunculi would probably never experience in their lives.</p><p>\u2026A strange feeling of guilt crept through his body. It was something that couldn\u2019t be helped, but his heart wanted to do something about it.</p><p>Ruler had her breath taken away by Sieg\u2019s words.</p><hr><p>Though the source of the voice he heard was different, he hid the same determination as her within himself. She tried to respond to the laments of the Lord, and he was trying to respond to the laments of his fellow homunculi. Even though Ruler couldn\u2019t hear their voices asking to be saved, this boy heard them.</p><p>Therefore\u2014</p><p>\u201C\u2026I can\u2019t stop you.\u201D</p><p>\u201CHmm? \u2026If it\u2019s you, I think you have plenty of ways to stop me, though.\u201D</p><p>\u201CNo, I was talking to myself. In other words, you intend to return to the castle now and persuade the homunculi to run away?\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2026I\u2019m thinking of various approaches to take to do that, but that\u2019s basically it.\u201D</p><p>\u201CWhat do you think your chances of success are?\u201D</p><p>\u201CRight now, it\u2019s equivalent to zero. But that doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m going to run away.\u201D</p><p>\u201CPlease cut it out with the reckless charging ahead. That is the same as trampling over Rider\u2019s good will.\u201D</p><p>Of course, he didn\u2019t intend to do that. But\u2026 currently, Sieg couldn\u2019t come up with anything that could be called a plan.</p><p>\u201CI have a question for you as the mediator of the Great Holy Grail War. The Black camp is using homunculi like me as a prana supply. That could be called a violation in the Holy Grail War, right?\u201D</p><p>Ruler\u2019s expression darkened. Yes, rescuing the homunculi was his objective. But the journey ahead of him was filled with too many difficulties. The biggest problem right now was the difficult question of whether this could be called a violation if one strictly applied the rules.</p><p>\u201C\u2026From what I have seen, the homunculi are participating in the Holy Grail War of their own will. At the very least, that\u2019s how a homunculus answered when I asked her.\u201D</p><p>Because it was their master\u2019s order, they agreed to fight. That was a course of action that not only homunculi, but also many humans had taken. In the first place, Servants participated in battle fundamentally for that reason.</p><p>\u201COur will is extremely weak. We\u2019re beings that just obey the orders we\u2019re given.\u201D</p><p>\u201CBut you yourself possess a sense of self and are acting according to it.\u201D</p><p>\u201CThat\u2019s true, but\u2014\u201D</p><p>\u201CIf they are participating in the Holy Grail War of their own will, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s my place to speak out. You can ask the homunculi whether they are participating of their own will and obtain an answer from them, can\u2019t you?\u201D</p><p>The homunculus was at a loss for words. It was doubtful that he would get an ideal answer from them if he asked. Since the moment they were born, obeying someone\u2019s orders was everything to them. Their will to resist was pretty much nonexistent.</p><p>\u201CBut it\u2019s true that this is something I cannot overlook. It\u2019s a general rule that the supply of prana should be conducted between Master and Servant alone. To ignore that rule on such a large scale and so openly\u2026 it might be a bit of a problem. But, even if I order them to correct the situation, they do not have the obligation to obey.\u201D</p><p>\u201CDon\u2019t you have that kind of authority, since you\u2019re the mediator?\u201D</p><p>\u201CI do, but\u2026 the number of times I can use it is limited. To be more specific, I have been granted the right to enforce up to two orders on each Servant.\u201D</p><p>\u201CThat\u2019s\u2014\u201D</p><p>Ruler nodded at his surprised expression. Yes, this was her greatest privilege as Ruler. The rights to enforce absolute orders on Servants that each Master possessed three of\u2014in other words, [Command Spells].</p><p>\u201CHowever, I cannot use a Command Spell as the mediator when it comes to minor matters\u2026 No, naturally, this is just my own criterion.\u201D</p><p>Of course, if she used the Command Spells, she could even control who obtained the Holy Grail as an extreme example. She could just order the Servant who she didn\u2019t want to obtain it to commit suicide.</p><p>However, that was precisely why she needed laws inside herself. If she got rid of those, she wouldn\u2019t be Ruler, but just a despot.</p><p>As the homunculus slumped his shoulders in defeat, Ruler felt her heart tighten. Just as he said, it was too harsh to ask for a display of [will] from the homunculi.</p><p>\u201C\u2026I have a suggestion. Don\u2019t you think the homunculi would open their hearts if you talked to them? Why don\u2019t you show them the things the ones that rule them haven\u2019t shown them?\u201D</p><p>\u201CThat\u2019s\u2026\u201D</p><p>The boy began to ponder hard. As a homunculus like them, he might be able to make an appeal regarding their wretched conditions. Then it was possible that Ruler might act a little as well. If that was enough to break out the homunculus who sought help and chose to withdraw from the war from the castle\u2014</p><p>\u201CIf I can save my comrades that way, I think I\u2019ll try it.\u201D</p><p>\u201CI see\u2026 In that case.\u201D</p><p>To be honest, this was an act just on the borderline of Ruler\u2019s jurisdiction. She was supporting this homunculus too much.</p><p>But\u2026 even if she were to say she wouldn\u2019t cooperate with him now, he probably wouldn\u2019t stop.</p><p>As long as Rider of Black existed, he would undoubtedly cause chaos among the Black Faction. And with matters already being complicated due to the Red Faction aiming to kill her as well, she couldn\u2019t allow for the war\u2019s order to crumble any further.</p><p>First giving a light cough and then puffing out her chest, she spoke in a deliberately crabby manner.</p><p>\u201C\u2014It can\u2019t be helped. The situation is unavoidable, so from now on I\u2019ll direct and manage your actions. Have no worries, I will consider your will as much as possible. However, please refrain from taking any absurd and reckless actions. Understood?\u201D</p><p>\u201CMgh\u2026\u201D</p><p>\u201CThis isn\u2019t a situation that you can deal with by yourself right now.\u201D</p><p>\u201CThat\u2019s true\u2026 but.\u201D</p><p>\u201CMost of all! If you go back to that castle by yourself right now, we have no idea what Rider of Black\u2026 Astolfo might do. I feel deeply, deeply anxious about that\u2026\u201D</p><p>She grumbled as if she felt anxious from the bottom of her heart.</p><p>\u201C\u2026That\u2019s true.\u201D</p><p>After all, he was a Heroic Spirit who blew off reason all the way to the moon. If the homunculus acted carelessly, Rider would definitely go on a rampage inside the castle for his sake.</p><p>\u201CTherefore, please follow my lead. Is that fine with you? It\u2019s fine, right? Answer me!\u201D</p><p>Overpowered by Ruler as she suddenly and forcefully pressed him for an answer, the boy frantically nodded.</p><p>\u201CU-Understood\u2026 I\u2019ll obey you.\u201D</p><p>Ruler was about to hold out her gauntlet-less hand to shake, but then suddenly realized. She had yet to hear his name.</p><p>\u201CI\u2019m sorry, but about your name\u2014\u201D</p><p>\u201CPlease call me \u2018Sieg\u2019. Though this was originally his name, not mine.\u201D</p><p>The boy spoke with his hand placed against his chest as if somehow proud of that.</p><p>\u201CSince he\u2019s gone now, I must live. When I consider that, this name seems appropriate\u2026 that\u2019s what I think, but how about it?\u201D</p><p>\u201CI understood. So your name is Siegfried then.\u201D</p><p>\u201CNo, that\u2019s wrong. Just Sieg is fine. I feel that that hero\u2019s name is too heavy for me. I probably wouldn\u2019t be able to live like he did.\u201D</p><p>He probably wouldn\u2019t able to sacrifice his life without hesitation like he did\u2014</p><p>He whispered that with some regret and frustration.</p><p>\u201CThat\u2019s only natural. You have merely obtained a position that allows you to just barely do something. You aren\u2019t a hero who has already accomplished the things you needed to do like him.\u201D</p><p>It was mere disgusting arrogance to force a boy with an infinite future spread out before him to sacrifice his life. No matter how much he looked like an adult in appearance, he\u2014was still very young.</p><p>\u201CI see\u2026 Yeah, I understand.\u201D</p><p>Sieg obediently nodded. What a good boy, Ruler pleasantly thought. Then, she offered her hand again. And the boy gingerly grasped that hand.</p><p>\u201CThen, let\u2019s return to the castle without delay\u2026 If we meet Rider, please leave it to me to properly explain things to him so it doesn\u2019t turn into a quarrel.\u201D</p><p>\u201CAll right. Then, let\u2019s go.\u201D</p><p>\u201CYes, let\u2019s go!\u201D</p><p>Ruler turned around to face away from the village at the base of the mountain. And then, after taking a few steps forward, she weakly collapsed to her knees.</p><p>\u201CW-What\u2019s wrong?\u201D</p><p>Sieg frantically rushed over to her, and Ruler replied with a deeply apologetic expression.</p><p>\u201CUmm\u2026 I\u2019m sorry, but let\u2019s go to the village at the base of the mountain.\u201D</p><p>\u201CWhy?\u201D</p><p>His question was answered by a sound more eloquent than words. It was the trill of her stomach; in other words, it was the sound of her stomach growling.</p><p>\u201CI don\u2019t think it\u2019s possible, but are you\u2014\u201D</p><p>\u201CI\u2019m sorry, but could you please carry me on your back while you\u2019re at it? My stomach is empty and I can\u2019t move\u2026\u201D</p><p>It was that impossibility. She was out of gas. Thinking back on it, since eating dinner, she had been running around here and there without eating or drinking until it was near dawn, and she had lacked the time to rest after using her holy water to search. It was only for an instant, but her consciousness had flicked off earlier.</p><p>Even if it was no problem for a Servant, she had expended too much energy as a human. If she expended a massive amount of prana, she could move, but\u2014she could not endure this despairing sensation of hunger forever.</p><p>\u201C\u2026I feel anxious about our future prospects.\u201D</p><p>Ruler had no words she could respond with.</p><hr><p>\u201CHow is Lancer?\u201D</p><p>\u201CInstead of going into spiritual form, my Lord is sitting on his throne and seems to be thinking about something. He appears to be considering some matters from his discussion with Ruler.\u201D</p><p>Gathered together in one of the castle\u2019s rooms, the head of the Yggdmillennia clan, Darnic, and Archer stood in front of each other as they started working out their plans from now on.</p><p>\u201CTo think that Saber would drop out so early on\u2026\u201D</p><p>Darnic wore a dark expression. It was only natural; the one extolled as the greatest of the seven Servant classes, Saber, possessed outstanding talent that should have ensured he survived until the final stages of the war. There were Servants like Caster and Assassin who excelled at targeting their opponent\u2019s weak points, and Servants like Rider who overwhelmed the enemy with an abundance of Noble Phantasms\u2014so it wasn\u2019t like the Saber class had an absolute advantage, but unlike those other classes who suffered from the issue of compatibility with their enemies, the Saber class could deal with any type of enemy in battle with its all-purpose strength and skills.</p><p>Moreover, Saber of Black had been Siegfried, the great hero of the Netherlands. Excluding Saber of Red, he should have been able to dominate any battle no matter what Servant he faced.</p><p>\u201CIt\u2019s no use regretting what\u2019s past now. The Red camp will probably detect Saber\u2019s death sooner or later. When they do, there is a high chance that they\u2019ll attack to try and finish us off in one stroke.\u201D</p><p>The Red camp had lost Berserker to them and was also down to six Servants. If Archer were their commander, he would want to attack before the Black camp made countermeasures to deal with Saber\u2019s loss. They had the best chance of winning now while the Black camp wasn\u2019t prepared.</p><p>\u201CCaster\u2019s Noble Phantasm will be necessary.\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2026I heard we haven\u2019t yet gathered all the necessary materials yet, though.\u201D</p><p>A Servant\u2019s Noble Phantasm was brought into this world when they were summoned, and was naturally compiled out of prana. Though there were sometimes necessary conditions for activating it, it was rare for the Noble Phantasm itself to require materials to construct it.</p><p>Most of the time, this occurred in cases where the Noble Phantasm still existed in the world up to the present day. However, in this case, what was needed was the Noble Phantasm itself instead of the materials.</p><p>A Noble Phantasm was not an unknown weapon. Noble Phantasms were none other than the ultimate mysteries of Heroic Spirits that were sublimated into their legends. Therefore, Noble Phantasm were already completed existences\u2026 normally speaking.</p><p>If there was a Noble Phantasm that did not follow this logic, it would be something too huge to be possessed by a single Heroic Spirit, or\u2014something that was incomplete but still carved into legend.</p><p>\u201CThere\u2019s just one material left. If we can obtain it, Caster can activate his Noble Phantasm.\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2026A first-class magus.\u201D</p><p>Darnic spoke with a grim expression. Hearing those words, Archer finally understand the reasons for various things that had been happening.</p><p>\u201C\u2026I see. So that\u2019s why Caster wanted that homunculus.\u201D</p><p>\u201CThat\u2019s right. Caster\u2019s Noble Phantasm requires a [core] to function, and the quality of the core is reflected in the power of the Noble Phantasm. The only ones that possess the necessary talent among our clan are\u2014\u201D</p><p>\u201CThe seven who became Masters. And also the homunculus in question.\u201D</p><p>\u201CWe can gather any number of second-rate and third-rate magi as materials. However, a magus who is the successor of a thousand-year-old Magic Crest can\u2019t be obtained in such a short period of time.\u201D</p><p>\u201CI don\u2019t think that the homunculus has a Crest, though\u2014\u201D</p><p>\u201CBut that homunculus was made using crafting techniques stolen from the Einzberns. It\u2019s not unusual for an extraordinary monster to be born among those we created. Caster probably noticed that.\u201D</p><p>That\u2019s true, Archer thought with a nod. His Magic Circuits were first-class. As a result, his feeble body hadn\u2019t been able to endure the power of his Circuits.</p><p>\u201CBut at this point, capturing that homunculus is a dim prospect. In other words\u2026\u201D</p><p>\u201CWe have to use someone among us as the materials, huh?\u201D</p><p>\u201CYes. In that case, there is only one person who qualifies.\u201D</p><p>Darnic muttered with a bitter smile.</p><p>Archer guessed that he was probably referring to Gordes Musik Yggdmillennia. Especially since Saber had chosen his own death, his Master was definitely not unrelated.</p><p>When he regained consciousness, Gordes had shaken pitifully before Lancer\u2019s cross-examination of what had happened and had blamed everything on Saber and Rider. Watching him do that had not brought pleasant feelings even to a Servant like Archer.</p><p>Gordes had forgotten that, at the same time as being his Servant, Saber was also the undying hero Siegfried who was unparalleled in history\u2026 No, perhaps it was more accurate to say that he averted his eyes from that fact.</p><p>If Saber didn\u2019t obey his Master\u2019s orders, it was probably due to his own beliefs. To try and overcome that with a high-handed attitude was completely out of the question. As a matter of fact, Archer felt that Gordes\u2019 arrogant attitude had caused Lancer\u2019s anger towards Rider to cool down.</p><p>\u201CWas it okay to make Caster the Master of Berserker of Red?\u201D</p><p>Though Gordes had lost Saber, he still had one of his Command Spells left, and continued to possess the rights of a Masters. If he were to make a new contract, it was only natural to do so with Berserker of Red, but\u2014</p><p>The contract with Berserker had already been completed with Caster as a proxy Master.</p><p>\u201CWe can\u2019t expect anything from Berserker\u2019s Master, after all. Once we transfer Gordes\u2019 Command Spell to Caster, his role will end after guiding Berserker\u2019s rampage with the Command Spell.\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2026I see.\u201D</p><p>Darnic rolled his eyes in exasperation.</p><p>\u201CHave we still not received any word from Assassin\u2019s Master?\u201D</p><p>\u201CNo. Thanks to the [spirit board], we know that Assassin hasn\u2019t died, but\u2014\u201D</p><p>The worst possible scenario passed through their heads. A member of the Yggdmillennia, Sagara Hyouma, had purposefully departed for his homeland in the Far East and performed the summoning of his Servant with perfect preparation.</p><p>They confirmed that the summoning itself had succeeded through the [spirit board]. But they couldn\u2019t confirm if the Master was Sagara Hyouma.</p><p>In other words, there was a high probability that someone besides Sagara had become the Master. Assassin of Black\u2014Jack the Ripper\u2014had a short history and was a serial killer, which was far from the level of a Heroic Spirit, but with the special characteristics of his class, he undoubtedly specialized in killing Masters.</p><p>In that regard, Assassin was quite a terrifying Servant to have as an enemy.</p><p>\u201CHaving both Assassins in the Red camp is the worst possible outcome, but\u2026\u201D</p><p>Darnic shook his head at Archer\u2019s words, as if to say that he didn\u2019t want to even consider the possibility. It was then that the door suddenly opened and the two of them turned to look at the same time.</p><p>\u201CGrandfather, Archer. May I have a minute of your time?\u201D</p><p>The one who barged in was Archer of Black\u2019s Master, Fiore Forvedge Yggdmillennia. Normally, she acted in a graceful manner in all situations, but for once, she wore a highly bewildered expression.</p><p>\u201CWhat\u2019s wrong, Fiore? To not even knock\u2014\u201D</p><p>Without answering, Fiore silently put a newspaper on the table. Darnic and Archer focused their gazes on a particular news article.</p><p>\u201CThis is\u2026\u201D</p><p>\u201CIt appears that a serial killer has appeared in Romania\u2019s capital, Bucharest. The deaths have spread north of Bucharest to Sighi\u0219oara.\u201D</p><p>Darnic frantically pored over the newspaper. While the details on the murders themselves were sparse, there were already more than thirty victims, and all of Romania appeared to be in a panic.</p><p>\u201CI thought it was just a coincidence, but please look here. The list of victims\u2014\u201D</p><p>What Fiore pointed at was the photo of a woman. Though they were low grain photos, one could see that she possessed well-ordered features. Only the words [Unidentified] were written in the caption beneath the photo.</p><p>\u201CHer name is Pemetrekis. \u2014She is a magus who was in the same department as me at the Association.\u201D</p><p>At her words, Darnic also recognized the seriousness of the situation. If this were a mere serial killer, one could just disregard it as a coincidence. But that was impossible if a magus was included among the list of victims. Moreover, she was probably one of the magi who had been despatched to Trifas.</p><p>\u201CIs she a magus weak enough to be killed by a serial killer?\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2026No. Pemetrekis is a magus specialized in intelligence-gathering. Adding in the battle abilities of her familiars, a normal magus wouldn\u2019t be able to contend with her in battle.\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2014In other words. This serial killer possesses the ability to kill magi.\u201D</p><p>If the serial killer was simply a magus who surpassed her level, then it was still a minor matter. But the name of a monster that was famous for surpassing magi by far came to their minds.</p><p>Servant Assassin\u2014Jack the Ripper. Had he arrived in Romania? If so, just what on earth was his Master thinking? At the very least, they couldn\u2019t imagine he was sane if he was turning a blind eye to these abnormal events that even appeared in the newspaper. He was stepping far off from the general rule of all magi to conceal their mysteries from the public.</p><p>\u201CThat\u2019s right. What should we do, grandfather? This isn\u2019t something that can be ignored.\u201D</p><p>After pondering for a while, Darnic decided to despatch several of their clan\u2019s magi who were on standby in Trifas at the moment.</p><p>\u201C\u2026If this really is the work of Assassin of Black, magi won\u2019t be able to fight him at all.\u201D</p><p>No matter how weak any Servant might be, they were all Heroic Spirits. They had reached the domain of what could be called the ultimate mysteries. Not to mention the opponent was Assassin, whose abilities were specialized in killing Masters.</p><p>\u201CShould we not head out as well?\u201D</p><p>Fiore\u2019s suggestion was certainly reasonable. But it was a different story if she had to leave Trifas and go all the way to Sighi\u0219oara. Despatching Servants in this situation and weakening their defences in this situation was\u2014</p><p>As Darnic\u2019s thoughts had reached a dead end, he received a telepathic communication from Caster.</p><p>\u2018Reporting. It seems Saber of Red and her Master have left Trifas.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Left\u2026 Do you know where they\u2019ve gone to?\u2019</p><p>\u2018They appear to have headed to Sighi\u0219oara. If I observe that city with my remote viewing thaumaturgy, my surveillance here will become somewhat insufficient, though\u2026 what should be done?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Please keep maintaining your surveillance over Trifas as you have. But I also want information on Sighi\u0219oara to some extent. If you have the power to spare, divert it to observing Sighi\u0219oara.\u2019</p><p>There could only be one of two reasons why Saber of Red and her Master\u2014the bounty-hunting necromancer Shishigou Kairi\u2014were heading to Sighi\u0219oara.</p><p>To kill Assassin of Black or to join forces with his Master. Either way, the Black camp couldn\u2019t remain a mere spectator in this situation.</p><p>They currently had six Servants and six Masters under their control, but they could use only one Servant as a scout. From a defensive standpoint, they couldn\u2019t send out two or more Servants.</p><p>\u201CArcher. And Archer\u2019s Master, Fiore. You are to head to Sighi\u0219oara. Assassin of Black\u2026 and Saber of Red are there.\u201D</p><p>Fiore\u2019s expression visibly stiffened faintly at the mention of Saber of Red. A clash with the Servant who was their most formidable enemy in the Great Holy Grail War. She guessed that crossing blades with her Master Shishigou Kairi would be inevitable. Hence the reason for her stiffened expression.</p><p>\u201C\u2026Understood. We\u2019ll depart as soon as we finish making preparations. Let\u2019s go, Archer.\u201D</p><p>But though she was tense as she nodded, Fiore was not afraid. Her trust in her Servant was naturally one reason for that, but it was also because\u2014she possessed absolute pride in her own abilities as well.</p><p>\u201CUnderstood, Master. Then, Darnic-dono, please pardon us.\u201D</p><p>Fiore exited the room with Archer, and Darnic let out a short breath.</p><p>\u201CThe world truly is beyond my control. But that\u2019s fine. I already decided to put my life on the line to separate from the Association of Magi. An incident of this level is within my expectations.\u201D</p><p>Naturally, Darnic had also taken into consideration the possibility that he himself would be defeated and that their clan would be destroyed. But his response to that would probably be \u2018So what?\u2019 Darnic remembered well how many clans had died out gloomily without even getting the chance to reach the Root.</p><p>They had gotten that chance. That alone was unexpected good fortune. And of course, Darnic had no intention of being defeated.</p><hr><p>\u2014It\u2019s not my fault.</p><p>Alone in his room, Gordes was crushed by humiliation and terror.</p><p>\u201CIt\u2019s not my fault.\u201D</p><p>Muttering that, Gordes drank down an entire glass of alcohol while trembling, trying to deny his own blunder. The taste of the expensive alcohol placed on his night table wasn\u2019t that good. It was a bitter taste that pierced his tongue. Not only was the taste bad, but he also couldn\u2019t get drunk on it\u2014it truly was a fraud product.</p><p>\u201CYes, it\u2019s a fraud. That damn hero\u2026 as if that could be Siegfried.\u201D</p><p>He stopped drinking\u2014wasn\u2019t what he did. He drank and drank, but\u2014his head hurt, and he remembered the gaze of that annoying swordsman.</p><p>Just remembering it made his thoughts, his heart, regain calm.</p><p>It hadn\u2019t been ugly or beautiful. It hadn\u2019t been filled with coldness or killing intent either. It had just waited.</p><p>\u201CWhat should I do?\u201D</p><p>If it had held expectations for Gordes\u2019 answer, he might have had the time to think. If that gaze had been cold or angry, he would have complied out of fear\u2014even if he was its Master.</p><p>If it had calmly given a proposal with merits and demerits\u2014Gordes might have refused, but he wouldn\u2019t have been that enraged by it.</p><p>That\u2019s not what it did. It had just waited robotically. It had waited for him to choose Yes or No.</p><p>That wasn\u2019t the bond between Master and Servant. I was just a pebble\u2014Gordes thought.</p><p>Gordes was a pebble on the path to achieving his objective. Gordes was in the way, so he kicked him away to the side of the path. That was probably the level of recognition he had given Gordes.</p><p>\u201CAs if that could be a hero.\u201D</p><p>Even as he grumbled those complaints, he understood\u2014but he averted his eyes from it. He just continued to avert his eyes. Because that would force him to face his own foolishness as well.</p><p>You don\u2019t understand anything.</p><p>The terror, shame and sorrow of his Servant realizing that and saying it to him. To prevent that, he acted that way. He didn\u2019t speak to him and wasn\u2019t spoken to either. Because Gordes tried to treat him as a Servant (tool), Saber could only treat Gordes as a Master (tool) as well.</p><p>That was only natural. Gordes treated everything besides himself as tools. His objective was the restoration of the proud alchemist Musik family. Even becoming part of the Yggdmillennia clan was a mere stepping stone for the sake of that goal. That was what he was taught. His father and mother said that, and his grandfather and grandmother said that.</p><p>\u2026He knew that wasn\u2019t right. He knew that, but he couldn\u2019t think of a way to bring about change. Following the rules imposed on him made his heart feel at ease. We\u2019ll triumph one day. That sworn revenge was pushed upon the next generation by his grandfather, grandmother, father and mother.</p><p>He had also of course intended to push it upon his son. Once this war was over, he planned to start the incremental transplant of his Magic Crest to him.</p><p>His son also saw him as a tool. He had immediately understood that from his son\u2019s obscure eyes that seemed to rebel at him without trying to hide it\u2026 After all, he was the spitting image of Gordes who was reflected in those eyes.</p><p>If, he suddenly thought.</p><p>If he had recognized his Servant not as a tool, but as a hero with his own personality like the Forvedge siblings had.</p><p>Perhaps Saber\u2019s machinelike eyes would have changed somehow. Perhaps the future would have been different.</p><p>Gordes laughed scornfully at his own thoughts and poured more alcohol into his glass.</p><p>\u201CRidiculous. What good does it do to think of it now?\u201D</p><p>He gulped down the alcohol, but even so\u2014Gordes thought. If, at that time, he had responded to Saber\u2019s suggestion\u2014no, ridiculous. It was ridiculous, so he stopped thinking about it. He was a loser, a dropout. Now he could only leave the rest to someone else.</p><p>Concluding that, Gordes finally started to feel the alcohol take effect on his mind.</p><p>Geez, how annoying.</p><p>While twisting her intelligent and beautiful face in anger, Celenike walked through the hallway with loud and rough footsteps. No matter how much she tormented her Servant, she didn\u2019t feel refreshed by it all due to the frivolous smile he always wore.</p><p>She had the greatest feast before her eyes, but she couldn\u2019t touch it. Not only was she not allowed to eat it, but it also remained too hard to chew no matter how much she stabbed at it with a fork.</p><p>To Celenike, who was raised and doted upon by the old female magi who practiced the dark arts, patience and self-control were the same things as torture. She could only maintain self-control with things regarding magecraft.</p><p>If there was anything that could bring a smile to her noble-looking face, it would probably be for someone to bring the homunculus whom Rider had protected before her. If she gouged out his eyes, cut off his arms, pulled out his tongue and made him eat his own intestines right in front of Rider, even Rider would probably lament and despair.</p><p>She wanted to see that expression. She wanted to see it no matter what. If she could see the expression of Astolfo, known as being the loveliest among Charlemagne\u2019s famous Twelve Paladins, twist in despair, she wouldn\u2019t even mind dying.</p><p>\u2014At the same time. She seemed to greatly hate the homunculus who had stolen Rider\u2019s heart to this extent.</p><p>There was something that Astolfo had never given her no matter how much she wished so since he had been summoned as Rider of Black.</p><p>It could probably be called love. Cherishment, affection and the joy that came with it were emotions that Celenike had difficulty understanding.</p><p>Why wouldn\u2019t he direct those emotions towards her? How annoying. Even though that homunculus has just a transient life like a mayfly.</p><p>In reality, she had wanted to search for him till the bitter end. Not only was she skilled in magecraft, Celenike also had the most vindictive personality among the Yggdmillennia clan. To her, the homunculus was already nothing more than an annoying pest. The kind of bug that one had to search for through even the roots of grass and eradicate.</p><p>But she couldn\u2019t take up her time to search for a single homunculus. Finding him wasn\u2019t impossible with her dark arts. But a lot of preparations would need to be made to do so, and it was made harder since the homunculus whose whereabouts were unknown was also an excellent magus.</p><p>There would be no point to it if she attacked unskillfully and ended up being bitten by a cornered mouse. She could do nothing but give up regarding the homunculus until the end of this war.</p><p>It made her want to see Rider\u2019s anguished face and do even more extreme things to him. She wanted to violate him, disgrace him, and dye him in despair\u2014but Celenike somehow managed to hold herself back from such wicked acts. Once this war was over, once her side won, she could do so with no problems.</p><p>Once they beat the Red camp, she would give up her wish and participation in the war. She would use all three Command Spells to violate Rider until he died.</p><p>Perhaps it was because she was walking in such an overly irritated manner, but a homunculus bumped into her shoulder as she passed. The young boy, in charge of setting the table for meals, bowed his head and apologized with vacant eyes.</p><p>I\u2019ll do it to him, Celenike decided.</p><p>\u201CYou, come with me for a bit.\u201D</p><p>The homunculus had no right to refuse. And Celenike had not one fragment of sympathy for a homunculus servant. Furthermore, consumption was a virtue for magi.</p><p>With a vulgar pleasure that even other magi would scorn, Celenike decided to release the stress she\u2019d kept building up for the time being.</p><p>\u2014Something weird has happened.</p><p>Roche Frain Yggdmillennia sighed. He stirred up his extremely curly hair and tried to settle his disordered thoughts.</p><p>Their side\u2019s Saber had fallen. Moreover, it was due to suicide. He thought Heroic Spirits were people with a bit more sense, but that didn\u2019t seem to be the case.</p><p>\u201CGeez, how absurd.\u201D</p><p>This should have been a war with plenty of leeway for their side.</p><p>With Lancer of Black, Saber of Black, Archer of Black and the combination of him and Caster, he had been confident that they could knock down any enemy. To put it more accurately, he had confidence in making golems that could deal with anything.</p><p>The Black Masters valued his golems far too lightly. Certainly, Saber of Red had cut them down with a single strike. But those were golems made to serve as lookouts. It didn\u2019t mean that they were inferior to the others he made, but their purpose was strictly detection and giving reports. Golems that displayed true battle specs wouldn\u2019t have been defeated so one-sidedly.</p><p>Of course, they would have been defeated in the end, but his golems existed in the hundreds. Saber might not get injured against ten or twenty of them, but if she was attacked in waves with golems numbering beyond a hundred, who knows what might have happened?</p><p>\u2026He was fully aware that it was an abstract academic theory. However, the possibility of that was definitely not low.</p><p>But in truth, he understood it was expecting too much for Saber to be taken down by his battle-type golems.</p><p>The problem was Caster\u2019s Anti-Army Noble Phantasm, Golem Keter Malkuth: Royal Crown, the Light of Wisdom. Naturally, he guessed that Caster\u2019s Noble Phantasm was also a golem. But for some reason, Caster was vague about its precise form.</p><p>\u2026That was because Roche was still inexperienced. He wanted to think that was the reason. However, based on the words Caster sometimes let slip, it at least seemed to be a huge golem. After that, Caster of Black had told him this as well.</p><p>\u2014This golem is not meant to be invincible.</p><p>\u2014Rather, it must be designed so that it can die through any kind of means.</p><p>\u2014The golem I\u2019m creating possesses life. Therefore, it will die.</p><p>\u2014My golem is not a craft to simple move clay dolls. My golem is the creation of life\u2026 in other words, a copy of the original human, Adam.</p><p>That was the being Caster aimed to create. To Roche who thought that it was sufficient to just create a capable golem, Caster\u2019s thinking was extremely shocking.</p><p>He wanted to help, and if he couldn\u2019t do that, he wanted to at least be next to him to watch him make it. Frankly speaking, the Great Holy Grail War was nothing other than a troublesome event for Roche. If it weren\u2019t for the battle around the Holy Grail, he wouldn\u2019t have been able to witness the miracle of summoning Heroic Spirits, and naturally, he wouldn\u2019t have met Caster of Black\u2014Avicebron.</p><p>So fighting in the war couldn\u2019t be helped. But although there were still a ton of things he wished to learn from Caster, the length of the Great Holy Grail War was far too short\u2026 Because of that, Roche had decided on what to wish for.</p><p>His wish was for Caster to be fully resurrected. Caster also had a wish he wanted to fulfill in the present world, so it should be fine to assist him a little.</p><p>When he heard Roche\u2019s wish, Caster of Black had said, \u201CThank you.\u201D It didn\u2019t mean that Caster\u2019s detached attitude had changed, and his teaching didn\u2019t become softer.</p><p>But they communicated through the heart. Just knowing that was a great yield to Roche.</p><p>He didn\u2019t find it this interesting to mingle with other people. It was rarer for there to be someone whom he could respect from the bottom of his heart. Roche\u2019s parents had never shown interest in him. No, even if being raised by golems was a tradition of the Frain family, he had never once felt love and affection even beyond that.</p><p>That might be necessary for a magus. Love for one\u2019s family was sometimes a heavy burden in the quest for magic. So it\u2019s better not to give any love from the beginning. At the very least, that was the policy of the Frain family.</p><p>Furthermore, Roche was a child who was called the Frain\u2019s greatest masterpiece since the family had joined Yggdmillennia.</p><p>Roche himself recognized that as well. He had carefully read the numerous grimoires that contained the feelings of his ancestors as if their blood ran through it, and had tilted his head in puzzlement at why they would explain in drawn-out words such a simple\u2014easily understood thing.</p><p>And then, he had summoned a genius. He was overwhelmed by him right from the start, and then admired him. The man who was on the same level as him\u2026 no, who he thought might even be lowering his level to match his.</p><p>It was unthinkable for him to serve Roche. Roche himself had to be taught by him. And one day, he would watch from beside him as Caster fulfilled his dream.</p><p>He would do anything for the sake of that. If human lives were necessary, he would mow down as many as it took. He would even do things that would undermine his own family.</p><p>It can\u2019t be helped. After all, it\u2019s for the sake of fulfilling sensei\u2019s, our dream\u2014</p><p>\u2014Ah, that was scary.</p><p>The eldest son of the Yggdmillennia\u2019s clan\u2019s Forvedge family, Caules Forvedge Yggdmillennia, trembled while walking down the hallway as he remembered what he\u2019d just seen.</p><p>Following closely behind him was his Servant, Berserker of Black\u2026 Though he thought that she was a little too close, like a spirit hanging off his back.</p><p>What filled him with fear wasn\u2019t the enemy. It was one of his allied Servants\u2014Lancer of Black.</p><p>Caules still hadn\u2019t grasped exactly what had happened, but it seemed that some trouble had happened between Saber of Black and his Master Gordes.</p><p>In any case, as a result, Saber had been eliminated without even fighting. It truly was a nightmarish development. By capturing Berserker of Red and changing his Master, they had increased their number of Servants to seven. Although Assassin still hadn\u2019t joined up with them, they had at least gained the superior advantage in the quantity of their forces\u2014just when he thought that, this happened.</p><p>Lancer of Black had naturally been furious at that report. It was truly a fit of rage. The force and intensity of it had been enough to make even Celenike, a cold-blooded practitioner of the dark arts, turn pale. To be honest, he thought it was a miracle he was currently still alive like this.</p><p>That was a Heroic Spirit; that was Lancer. Furthermore, he was Vlad III, who was known throughout the world for his harsh governance and skewers, a man who had without hesitation skewered even aristocrats who should have been his relatives.</p><p>And at the same time, the other gathered Servants were worthy of even more admiration for not having been gripped by considerable terror when they faced Lancer\u2019s rage. He could at least understand Archer, Berserker and Caster remaining calm since they were bystanders to the event. But the supposed related party, Rider of Black, had remained calm no matter how much Lancer raged\u2026 or rather, he had just smiled as if enjoying himself.</p><p>Was that strangeness of smiling in that situation without feeling even an iota of fear Rider of Black\u2019s grounds for defence? The other related party, Gordes, had desperately made excuses, but no matter how Caules thought about it, he was just reaping what he sowed.</p><p>Unfortunately, Yggdmillennia had lost Saber of Black.</p><p>But Caules was not particularly pessimistic about this incident. It appeared that Saber of Black had been Siegfried, the great hero of the Netherlands. At the same time as being truly invincible thanks to bathing in the blood of a dragon, he was famous for having died a tragic death from being pierced in the back due to a leaf from a lime tree that had clung to his back while he was bathed in the blood.</p><p>And then there was that incident\u2014due to Gordes trying to force Saber to unleash his Noble Phantasm with a Command Spell in a fit of confusion, there was a chance that his true name had been exposed. If the Red camp found out that his true name was Siegfried, they would naturally take many countermeasures. They wouldn\u2019t just simply try to aim for his back.</p><p>Firstly, since he was a dragon-slayer, they would probably try to avoid facing him with a hero possessing the blood of a dragon. Conversely, while Siegfried was a dragon-slayer, he had been bathed in the blood of a dragon, so he might receive fatal damage from Noble Phantasms that are tremendously effective against dragons.</p><p>Naturally, such countermeasures wouldn\u2019t necessarily go as well as it sounded. But\u2026 in any case, the enemy could work out that many countermeasures if they found out. The Black camp\u2019s first plan had been to construct strategies that pivoted around Saber of Black, but if his true name was seen through, they would need to revise their plans. However\u2014at the same time, there had also been the chance that his true name wasn\u2019t exposed.</p><p>In the end, that uncertain situation had beckoned confusion on the battlefield. That was the worst possible result. From the start, it was normal for the battlefield to be ruled by chaos. If even more factors that confused it were included, there was no telling what result it would lead to. Caules didn\u2019t like that kind of gambling. Saber had died, so they should just form a new system of order.</p><p>From the start, the Black camp had the advantageous position. Based on the system of the Great Holy Grail War, it was impossible for it to turn into a drawn-out war. Furthermore, this war in Trifas was known to magi throughout the world.</p><p>\u2026Yes, for the Association of Magi who prized honor and prestige, they couldn\u2019t stand the continued existence of this Fortress of Millennia for a day or even an hour more.</p><p>In that case, they should just drop a cluster bomb on it\u2014but as expected, that was a method that they couldn\u2019t use as the Association of Magi.</p><p>Honor, tradition and convention\u2026 there were a mountain of things beyond one\u2019s control in this world. Both the Association of Magi and the Yggdmillennia clan were bound to them.</p><p>It was simple to just discard those values as \u2018stupid and trivial\u2019, but\u2014Caules himself couldn\u2019t do anything about it as someone who was bound to them. He understood that fact so well it pierced his body. The world and human life was like that.</p><p>\u201CWell, whatever.\u201D</p><p>He would just do what he had to do. If he died along the road, that was the end of it\u2014so Caules concluded.</p><p>\u201C?\u201D</p><p>Noticing that he was muttering to himself, Berserker suddenly peered at his face.</p><p>\u201CAh, sorry. It\u2019s nothing.\u201D</p><p>He sighed. But then, even if he said he would do what he had to do\u2014there was nothing he could do with Berserker like this. Having lost her reason, she could only break through the enemy directly before her when she went out on the battlefield.</p><p>In other words, there was no need for any directions from Caules at all.</p><p>Even so, Berserker was, in a way, exceptionally convenient for Caules as a Servant. After all, there was almost no need for him to supply her Prana. She could absorb the residual prana that existed on the battlefield and could in effect continue to fight perpetually.</p><p>It was true that the Black Servants didn\u2019t have to fear running out of prana as long as they had the prana supply from the homunculi, but there was a limit to how much they could provide. Most of all, Caules had doubts about whether or not they could provide prana for seven Servants even with Saber gone now.</p><p>Shortly after summoning Berserker, Caules had performed battle simulations where not only did he make Berserker not absorb prana with her Noble Phantasm Bridal Chest: Maiden\u2019s Chastity, but also cut off her prana supply from the homunculi.</p><p>The result was that she was assaulted by light dizziness just by moving and swinging her mace several times. If she remained in that state for five minutes or longer, she\u2019d probably be incapable of even standing.</p><p>This was Berserker\u2019s actual consumption rate of prana. It would have been a great burden to bear for Caules who was generally accepted to be a third-rate magus.</p><p>But this unease was resolved as long as Berserker had her Bridal Chest. Naturally, it would definitely turn into a crisis if she lost her Noble Phantasm\u2014but she would have already pretty much lost in such a situation in the first place.</p><p>Of course, it would be an exaggeration to say that he had no problems with her, but\u2026</p><p>He suddenly heard the familiar sound of a wheelchair squeaking across the floor. Stopping his pondering, he turned forward and found his older sister Fiore Forvedge Yggdmillennia there. The one pushing her wheelchair was her Servant, Archer of Black, Chiron.</p><p>\u201C\u2026Nee-san?\u201D</p><p>Puzzled, Caules suddenly stopped walking. It wasn\u2019t that there was anything strange about her Servant pushing her wheelchair. The issue was the black suitcase she held in her lap.</p><p>\u201CAh, Caules.\u201D</p><p>\u201CNee-san, are you going out somewhere with that dangerous thing?\u201D</p><p>It appeared he was correct, as she nodded with a solemn air.</p><p>\u201CYes. I\u2019m going out to make contact with Assassin of Black and his Master.\u201D</p><p>\u201CContact? \u2026I think that thing\u2019s quite dangerous to bring for just that, though.\u201D</p><p>Stored inside Fiore\u2019s suitcase was the Bronze-Link Manipulator: Coupled Reinforcement Mystic Code that she had designed herself.</p><p>\u201CUsing the computer is fine, but you should at least look at the local newspaper too, Caules.\u201D</p><p>Fiore frowned and scolded Caules. \u201CYeah, yeah,\u201D Caules responded very half-heartedly. This made Fiore raise her eyebrows even further, but Archer gently pushed her wheelchair, stopping her sermon from going any further.</p><p>\u201C\u2026Geez. I\u2019m going to have a talk with you once I return.\u201D</p><p>\u201CI get it, I get it. I\u2019ll listen properly when you get back.\u201D</p><p>\u201CReally? Then, I\u2019ll be going now. Look after the place while I\u2019m gone.\u201D</p><p>Fiore left those words and departed with Archer. Seeing them off, Caules sighed, and then Berserker agitatedly pulled at his sleeve.</p><p>When he turned to face her, her silver and gold eyes, which flickered in and out of sight from behind her long forelocks, looked like they were trembling with an inner fire.</p><p>\u201CWhat? Are you mad about something?\u201D</p><p>She nodded twice.</p><p>It seemed Berserker had been angered. By whom? Obviously, by Caules. But unfortunately, she couldn\u2019t communicate with words, so he couldn\u2019t tell what she was angry about.</p><p>\u201CIs it about Nee-san?\u201D</p><p>For now, Caules guessed that random, and Berserker nodded affirmatively. Tilting his head in puzzlement, Caules managed to find the answer with her affirmative and negative gestures.</p><p>The two of them returned to his room and faced each other. Caules sat on a chair, and Berserker sat down on the bed facing him. Incidentally, Caules\u2019 room could probably be called the strangest room in the Fortress of Millennia. There were several grimoires on his bookshelves, a crystal ball on his desk, and chess pieces placed along the corners of the room, perhaps meant to affix a Bounded Field. All that was fine, but the problem was the computer enshrined on his desk.</p><p>Darnic grimaced, Gordes scoffed and Fiore sighed at it, but in Caules\u2019 opinion, science and technology weren\u2019t without their worth. In the first place, they were in an era where magi also had to communicate through information technology unlike a decade ago. Unexpectedly, the one who used this technology for a lot of correspondences was the dark arts practitioner Celenike. Maybe she used it to conduct research on cursing techniques performed through the computer network.</p><p>\u201C\u2026In other words, you mean that? You can\u2019t stomach the way I was mentally overpowered by an opponent we might have to face someday?\u201D</p><p>Affirmative. Indeed, it was hard for him to say that Berserker\u2019s anxiety was just needless fear.</p><p>\u201CWell\u2026 This doesn\u2019t have any persuasive power if I say this to a Servant, but my older sister is a monster, you know.\u201D</p><p>Caules\u2019 eyes became tinged with nostalgia as he sighed. Though he grumbled that she was a monster, there was a glimpse of something like pride in him as he said it.</p><p>\u201CWell, I\u2019m not so stupid as to resolve myself to die and commit a suicide attack. More importantly, the battle with the Red camp comes first. Just like Archer said, the other side\u2019s Rider is extremely overpowered.\u201D</p><p>In the first place, it was abnormal for a Servant to be unbeatable by those without divine blood. Fortunately, the Black camp had Archer. Though his Divinity received a Rank Down due to being summoned as a Heroic Spirit, he still possessed divine blood.</p><p>If they hadn\u2019t summoned him, their side\u2019s defeat would have been fixed at that point. Naturally, even without defeating the Servant, there was the option of killing his Master. However, that was a plan with little hope of success for Berserker and a third-rate magus.</p><p>\u201CI think you also understand, but make sure you do not to fight that Rider. Okay?\u201D</p><p>Berserker vigorously nodded her head. It appeared she had learned her lesson after fighting him just once. It couldn\u2019t be helped if her attacks wouldn\u2019t affect the enemy right from the start.</p><p>Thank goodness this is a team battle, Caules thought from the bottom of his heart. If this had been a normal Holy Grail War, he honestly didn\u2019t feel that they could have won no matter what they did. Bridal Chest was a constantly-active-type Noble Phantasm that was easy to use, but if Berserker unleashed her other Noble Phantasm, Blasted Tree: Lightning Branch of Crucifixion, with all her limiters released\u2026 the price for wielding power she normally couldn\u2019t boast of would be too high.</p><p>The price for it was death. If Berserker of Black, Frankenstein, released all her limiters and unleashed her Noble Phantasm at maximum power, all her functions would halt. Since that was what was written in the blueprint left behind by none other than Doctor Frankenstein himself, he had no choice but to believe it.</p><p>Naturally, it was also possible to unleash it without releasing her limiters, but that would lower the power output. In order to avoid as much uncertainty as possible, Caules had also measured the Noble Phantasm\u2019s power output when it was unleashed without releasing the limiters.</p><p>After putting up a Bounded Field to clear people out of the forest during the day and retreating back to what he thought was a safe distance, he had made Berserker use her Noble Phantasm.</p><p>Its power output was at best C rank, at worst D rank by his estimation. He had used golems he earnestly requested to borrow from Roche as a standard of measurement for its power, but the lightning strikes got weaker the farther they traveled from Berserker, while conversely the golems she hit at point-blank range had been literally turned into garbage.</p><p>Caules estimated that it was powerful enough to kill most Servants if the limiters were released and she fired it from point-blank range\u2026 However, the price for it was too high. There was no proportional gain in killing one enemy Servant at the cost of losing one of their own.</p><p>\u201C\u2026Berserker, though I think it goes without saying. Basically, don\u2019t release Blasted Tree\u2019s limiters, okay?\u201D</p><p>Berserker tilted her head oddly at Caules\u2019 warning. As expected, no matter how high her intelligence was, it appeared that Berserker was truly Berserker\u2014Caules sighed.</p><p>In any case, for the combo of a third-rate magus like himself and Berserker who has a hard-to-use Noble Phantasm, there was no other choice but for him to strain his intelligence to come up with a plan. Even if he was third-rate as a magus, there should be an inexhaustible number of means he can use as a Master.</p><p>\u201C\u2026Ah, that reminds me, Nee-san said to read the newspaper.\u201D</p><p>Suddenly, he recalled Fiore\u2019s earlier words and had a homunculus bring him a local newspaper. After thanking the homunculus, he opened the newspaper and read the article that seemed to be what she had noticed.</p><p>\u2026Indeed, there was some truth to what she said. After he finished reading the article on the serial killer, Caules stood up.</p><p>\u201CNow then. Berserker, sorry about this, but please look after the place while I\u2019m gone for a bit.\u201D</p><p>\u201C?\u201D</p><p>Caules picked up several magical tools for summoning evil spirits and beasts that were stowed away in his desk, and equipped them on his person. He put on a bracelet with the names of beasts inscribed upon it on his wrist and stored black insect eggs in the tiptoes of his shoes.</p><p>Though they were small fries that wouldn\u2019t last even a second against a Servant, his panther familiars and his horde of earthworms that crawled into the enemy\u2019s body and caused pain would probably reasonably harass an enemy magus.</p><p>Caules once more felt his sleeve being agitatedly pulled. Explain yourself, Berserker\u2019s eyes demanded.</p><p>\u201C\u2026It\u2019s nothing, I\u2019m just going to go help Nee-san a bit.\u201D</p><p>Saying that, Caules glanced at his computer. The email he\u2019d received told of how the Association magi stationed in Sighi\u0219oara were being murdered one after another.</p><p>This information meant two things. First, the person who had taken out those magi was at the very least not a member of the Yggdmillennia clan. Second, the fact that Fiore was heading there meant that it was the work of a Servant.</p><p>And, though this was just guesswork on his part, if Assassin of Black and his Master were to oppose both the Yggdmillennia and the Red camp\u2026 it was conceivable that there would be a clash between Archer of Black, Assassin of Black and a Red Servant. In other words, a three-sided battle.</p><p>This was\u2014an extremely bad situation.</p><p>\u201CEven if the chance is one in a million, we can\u2019t afford lose Archer now. If it was one-on-one, the enemy magus would probably fight my sister. That\u2019s what it means to be a professional. But, if it\u2019s a two-on-one battle with me included\u2014no matter how weak I am, he\u2019ll probably run away. Because that\u2019s part of being a professional too. But it\u2019s true that we have to protect this fortress. So I\u2019ll leave you here to continue defending it. Well, in the worst case scenario, I\u2019ll call you with a Command Spell.\u201D</p><p>Berserker of Black thought that she should go along with Caules if possible in order to protect her Master, but his order to protect the fortress was also rational.</p><p>\u201CDon\u2019t worry. I have no intention of fighting to the death with the enemy. Anyone who would fight in a two-on-one situation is either very strong or a simple fool.\u201D</p><p>There was no falsehood in Caules\u2019 words. He truly didn\u2019t intend to fight. Anyway, his sister was strong. Let alone normal magi, she wouldn\u2019t easily lose to even magi that could be called first-rate. Her altered Magic Crest, said to be ranked next to Darnic\u2019s, was like a precision instrument.</p><p>Her Servant, Archer of Black, was also a first-rate Heroic Spirit. Within the Yggdmillennia\u2019s camp, Lancer of Black was the banner and Archer of Black was the cornerstone.</p><p>That was what made the worst case scenario so frightening. If Assassin of Black and Archer of Black clashed and a Red Servant used that as an opening to defeat Archer, it would mean defeat for them.</p><p>But, just by adding Caules into the equation, the magus of the Red camp would probably choose to withdraw. Necessarily, the Red Servant would also withdraw. He could do that not through his own power, but just by being there, so it would probably be easy.</p><p>After watching Caules leave the room, Berserker suddenly took notice of the computer, which had been left on. It seemed he had forgotten to turn it off. What a careless Master. Electricity is precious\u2014Berserker sighed and, without hesitation, pulled out the computer\u2019s plug.</p><p>She was scrupulously considerate as a Servant. Her Master would probably praise her for it as well.</p><hr><p>Thus, it was announced that the largest-scale Holy Grail War in history\u2014the [Great Holy Grail War] was over. The Black camp had lost, and the war ended with the Red camp as the victors. Unfortunately, the Greater Grail had ceased functioning, so no wishes could be granted, but an enormous reward was given by the Association of Magi as compensation. With the Greater Grail non-functional, they couldn\u2019t fight amongst each other either now.</p><p>The Red Masters relaxed as they pleased and soothed their fatigue from the war.</p><p>\u201CEveryone, I truly thank you for your hard work.\u201D</p><p>Just like when they met at the beginning, Shirou Kotomine presented them black tea.</p><p>\u201CThank you for the tea.\u201D</p><p>The moment they put the tea to their lips, a refreshing aroma plunged inside their chests. A comfortable pleasantness that pervaded not only their lungs, but all their internal organs. Perhaps it was also because they had finished their jobs without a hitch that they felt so relaxed, to a degree they hadn\u2019t felt since they became magi.</p><p>\u201CThis is good tea.\u201D</p><p>\u201CThank you very much for the praise.\u201D</p><p>\u201CShirou. Won\u2019t you drink some?\u201D</p><p>\u201CNo. Brewing it is my specialty, but I\u2019m not accustomed to drinking black tea\u2014\u201D</p><p>Smiling wryly, he poured hot water in his own cup. So the Japanese are like that, the magi thought absentmindedly.</p><p>\u201CAh, I just remembered. Could you all please hand over your Command Spells?\u201D</p><p>\u201COur Command Spells? Why?\u201D</p><p>The Command Spells\u2014were extremely\u2014important\u2014and necessary\u2014in order to win\u2014the war\u2014</p><p>\u201CReally now, everyone. Don\u2019t you remember? The Great Holy Grail War is over.\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2026Now that you mention it, that\u2019s right.\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2026Now that you mention it, that\u2019s true.\u201D</p><p>Yes, the Great Holy Grail War was over. When they heard that Ruler had joined the Yggdmillennia camp midway through, their sweat had turned cold, but they had somehow managed to deal with that as well thanks to Shirou\u2019s quick-wittedness. It had truly been a hard battle. Since the preparations before the fighting\u2014yes, it had been quite a handful since the preparations.</p><p>\u201CI am the overseer. I must recover all of your Command Spells and have them ready for the next Holy Grail War. I apologize for the trouble.\u201D</p><p>\u201CIt can\u2019t be helped. There\u2019s no use keeping them now anyway.\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2026I suppose that\u2019s true.\u201D</p><p>\u201CThen how about I bill the costs and expenses to the Church? If we arrange so that I provide the money and look after the Command Spells\u2014\u201D</p><p>\u201CIn that case, we can agree to it, but\u2026 is that all right?\u201D</p><p>\u201CThe one being billed is the Church, not me. Think of this as my revenge against them for pushing this important task onto a junior member like me.\u201D</p><p>Laughter spilled from everyone at his expression, which was just like that of a mischievous boy. Though they had been wary of him at the start of the war, thinking him to be an assassin sent by the Church, he had in fact worked quite hard for them.</p><p>\u201CWe appreciate all the hard work you did as the overseer. We would also like to reward you, but\u2014\u201D</p><p>\u201CAh, please do not worry in that regard. I also received something from you all as proper compensation.\u201D</p><p>Someone asked what it was. Shirou spoke with a small and elusive smile like always.</p><p>\u201CThat would be your rights as Masters. That is suitable as compensation, is it not?\u201D</p><p>I see, someone said with a nod.</p><p>\u201CAre you really fine with something like that?\u201D</p><p>\u201CYes, of course. Then, I will arrange the preparations to conduct the transfer ritual. Please enjoy chatting amongst yourselves for a short while.\u201D</p><p>\u201CWe\u2019ll do so.\u201D</p><p>\u2014At last, without noticing the unnaturalness of the situation right till the very end, the magi decided to hand over \u2018that\u2019, which they should have treasured more than their lives, over to the smiling boy, free of charge.</p><p>\u201CMore importantly. How should we use the reward we received?\u201D</p><p>\u201CI think we should spend time relaxing and enjoying ourselves for a while. This recent job was quite hard.\u201D</p><p>\u201CIt seems that an auction for grimoires has opened at the Clock Tower. With this reward, I\u2019ll be able to buy at least three books that I\u2019ve wanted for a long time.\u201D</p><p>\u201CI\u2019ll use it to give a personal donation to my department. The budget has been constricted.\u201D</p><p>\u201CIt\u2019s no fun to use it for things related to the Association. I will\u2026\u201D</p><p>The war had ended. Now they just had to get their reward. Incidentally, there was one thing they just couldn\u2019t seem to understand.</p><p>Just how exactly did we win?</p><p>Even though it was something they should definitely remember, for some reason none of them could answer that question. But it all became inconsequential to them when they drank the black tea.</p><p>Only days of peace and decadence filled their memories, and everything seemed to shine. Without glory or prestige, they merely quietly passed the time in idleness\u2014</p><h2 id="chapter-2" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#chapter-2" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Chapter 2</h2><hr><p>Participants in the Holy Grail War were able to see dreams. Perhaps it was due to the deep mental connection between Master and Servant.</p><p>They were able to view each other\u2019s pasts in the form of dreams. It was a phenomenon that was widely known to have occurred in the first three Holy Grail Wars and the smaller derivative Holy Grail Wars.</p><p>\u2014So Shishigou Kairi wasn\u2019t surprised at all when he found himself in Britain in the far ancient past.</p><p>\u201C\u2026Well, this kind of thing happens too, I guess.\u201D</p><p>This was probably his Servant Mordred\u2019s past. When he realized it, she was already right there next to him. The sword she held was the weapon she favored in this Holy Grail War as well\u2014Clarent: Radiant Sword of the King.</p><p>Originally, this weapon did not belong to her. It was a sword that served as the symbol of the throne, which King Arthur had obtained and stored in his armory.</p><p>Mordred had stolen it and incited a large-scale rebellion to take the title of \u2018king\u2019 for herself, and now she was tightly grasping this sword in front of King Arthur as she challenged him to a one-on-one fight.</p><p>\u201C\u2026In other words, this is Camlann, huh?\u201D</p><p>Yes, this place was the hill of Camlann. The site of the final decisive battle between the rebel army led by Mordred and the regular army led by King Arthur. In this sad and gloomy war, the curtains would finally close on the brilliant knightly story of King Arthur\u2019s legend.</p><p>Fired arrows pierced lightly-armored rank-and-file soldiers. Mordred, with her entire body clad in armor, pushed forward in defiance of all attacks.</p><p>King Arthur, who boasted of tremendous charisma, had finally managed to unify Britain. Yet in spite of that, why did so many soldiers approve of Mordred\u2019s rebellion?</p><p>With unification close at hand, weariness of war had spread and grown rampant within the country\u2014that was one reason.</p><p>The scandal between Queen Guinevere and the Knight of the Lake, Lancelot, who, despite being extolled as perfect, had fallen into an immoral love, had caused the king\u2019s authority to weaken in the people\u2019s eyes\u2014that was also one reason.</p><p>Many knights had been gripped by both a strange fear and even disdain for their king, who was too pure and upright and never acted according to personal feelings\u2014that was also one reason.</p><p>But there was another reason.</p><p>Seeing Mordred on the battlefield, Shishigou could understand it quite well. Her way of fighting was savage. The magnificent and gallant sword technique that other knights boasted of was like a frail twig before her style.</p><p>It was a style of killing that focused on obeying her instincts and optimized her fighting habits with the greatest efficiency.</p><p>The morale of the troops who followed her from behind was high. It was a rhythm that urged people\u2019s instincts. Their footsteps banged loudly and grandly like large drums as they stepped forward.</p><p>\u2014It was a calamity like that of a dragon.</p><p>Mordred was a famous knight. She had worked hard to be one and seemed to be so in reality. Still, if she had proceeded to the battlefield as a [knight], hundreds of thousands of soldiers probably wouldn\u2019t have followed her.</p><p>Her strength was real and somehow seemed to be filled with madness. But that very madness was her most admirable and suitable trait on the battlefield.</p><p>Since she was as strong as a monster and scattered enemies like a gall of wind, her soldiers continued to follow her as if stirred by madness.</p><p>\u2014They wanted to see how far this mad warrior could go.</p><p>A faith that went under the name \u2018frenzy\u2019. If they thought about it deeply, that was probably the only motive for the soldiers. But even if they had high morale, they were finite in numbers. One was killed, two were killed, hundreds, thousands of them died across the battlefield.</p><p>Mordred did not look back at them. Soldier\u2014no, humans were beings that multiplied of their own accords after winning. That was how she seemed to view them.</p><p>She prioritized attacking a thick formation of enemy soldiers. When she scattered them like wood chips, she would look for another thick enemy formation and ride swiftly towards it. Enemies that faltered, enemies that resisted, enemies that ran away\u2014she slayed them all and piled up mountains of corpses.</p><p>And as expected, Mordred paid no heed to the rank-and-file soldiers. The only one that held her interest was none other than her father\u2014King Arthur.</p><p>\u201CWhere is King Arthur?!! Where is the King of Knights?!!\u201D</p><p>She cried out and tore through the soldiers surrounding her by two, threefold. By challenging thick formations of the enemy, she had a high chance of treading where the king was. However, as if fate itself refused her, the two of them never encountered each other on the battlefield no matter where she went.</p><p>But\u2014once there were no more walls to block her, fate would finally fulfill her wish. Both King Arthur\u2019s army and Mordred\u2019s rebel army perished almost completely, leaving corpses strewn about everywhere. As Mordred rested using her sword as a cane, King Arthur finally appeared before her.</p><p>His expression was completely tranquil, containing no pity or hatred for her. That expressionless face clearly irritated Mordred.</p><p>In any case, the two of them stood facing each other. There were no longer any living beings left to get in their way.</p><p>Mordred spread her arms wide and shouted passionately. She shouted with anger, delight and all the emotions she couldn\u2019t help feeling.</p><p>\u201CHow\u2019s that?! How\u2019s that, King Arthur?! Your country ends here! It\u2019s finished! Regardless of who wins\u2014everything is already in ruins!\u201D</p><p>The one who received those words was a king who looked just like a youth, with features very similar to Mordred\u2019s.</p><p>Without caring about Mordred\u2019s passionate words, or even responding with words of his own, the king merely lifted his sword like some sort of machine.</p><p>That was the most unacceptable response to Mordred. Howling, Mordred swung her sword.</p><p>King Arthur parried, causing sparks to scatter as the two holy swords clashed. They were both exhausted, but both fought hard as they refused to lose. But their battle would change nothing. Just as Mordred said, no matter who won, this country was quickly falling to ruins.</p><p>\u201CYou should have known this would have happened! You should have known it would end up like this! If you had just turned over the throne to me, it wouldn\u2019t have turned out like this\u2026!\u201D</p><p>But even so, Mordred\u2019s sword did not slacken.</p><p>She was born as an illegitimate son, admired her father, was rejected by him, and then hated him\u2014and now they were trying to kill each other on the battlefield like this.</p><p>\u2014I hate you, I hate you. I hate you, the perfect king. I hate you, who didn\u2019t acknowledge my existence. Even though I was happy to be in your shadow. You never once turned around to face me.</p><p>\u2014That\u2019s why this is a natural punishment, King Arthur. I destroyed everything, everything you had!</p><p>\u201CDo you hate me!? Do you hate me that much!? Did you hate me for being Morgan\u2019s son!? Answer me\u2026 answer me, Arthur!!\u201D</p><p>At that shout, Arthur finally responded to her as they crossed swords. In a cold, completely emotionless voice, the king pronounced his verdict.</p><p>\u201CI have never once hated you. The reason I did not hand the throne over to you is because\u2014\u201D</p><p>You did not have the capacity to be a king.</p><p>It was a reply filled with [indifference]. He had merely understood Mordred\u2019s abilities and, without the slightest bit of emotion, divulged that she didn\u2019t have the necessary capacity.</p><p>Immediately after that, Mordred swung her sword in rage, and then, King Arthur\u2019s holy lance Rhongomyniad pierced through her chest. No matter how tough her armor was, it amounted to nothing before that lance.</p><p>\u2014However.</p><p>Even after being fatally wounded, Mordred mustered the last of her dying strength and finally dealt a decisive blow to King Arthur. Mordred\u2019s helm split in two, revealing the face of a young girl that Shishigou was familiar with.</p><p>As blood dripped down from her lips, Mordred stretched out her hand to King Arthur who stood right before her eyes.</p><p>\u201C\u2014\u2014Fa, ther.\u201D</p><p>Mordred fell without touching her father. Watching steadily, King Arthur understood that he had won this battle and, without a word, turned his back to Mordred and walked away.</p><p>\u2026After this, King Arthur was taken away by his surviving knight, Bedivere, and he had him return his sword to the lake. It was said that even after dying, he was healing his wounds in the land of fairies, Avalon.</p><p>That was how King Arthur\u2019s legend came to an end.</p><p>Paying no attention to King Arthur as he walked away, Shishigou gazed at the fallen Mordred. He sighed and muttered to himself.</p><p>\u201C\u2026Damn it, what a terrible dream.\u201D</p><p>It was so real. This dream was so lifelike he could even smell the blood on the battlefield. Mordred merely lay there with vacant eyes, her expression completely lifeless.</p><p>Yes, the current Mordred was completely a corpse. She would probably eventually be stripped of everything she had on her and rot away while devoured by insects.</p><p>King Arthur became a legend, and Mordred was remembered as the knight who tarnished that legend.</p><p>Since all the soldiers that followed her had been slain, there was no one left to remember her. That was only natural. This was a battlefield\u2026 those who lost and became bleached corpses were finished with this world.</p><p>Her passion, her keen wish was recorded nowhere and merely disappeared. Truly. Right until her last moments, she died in obscurity without even her parent turning back to look at her.</p><p>\u201C\u2014Ah, geez. I drew a troublesome Servant.\u201D</p><p>There\u2019s a limit even to compatibility, Shishigou thought. In the end, a Servant was merely a visitor from the past. Connecting with each other was important, but plunging in too deeply was out of the question. Once they got their hands on the Holy Grails, their relationship would end.</p><p>That\u2019s why this truth was extremely irritating. A child who wished for her father\u2019s love was the worst bad joke to Shishigou.</p><p>While waiting to wake up from the dream, Shishigou sat down beside Mordred\u2019s corpse. And then he merely gazed aimlessly at the perished people of a ruined country.</p><p>No matter the era or nation, the scene of a country\u2019s last moments were always the same\u2014</p><p>Thus, morning came, and the first words that came out of Shishigou\u2019s mouth were directed at Saber of Red and filled with ill humor.</p><p>\u201CGeez, don\u2019t show me strange dreams.\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2026I don\u2019t really get it, but is that my fault?\u201D</p><p>Even Saber of Red was wide-eyed with amazement at such an unreasonable complaint.</p><p>The place the two of them awoke in wasn\u2019t the catacombs of Trifas. It was in the room of a small hotel in Sighi\u0219oara. Just in case, they weren\u2019t using a room they had rented themselves, but a room they had gotten someone else to pay for using suggestion magecraft.</p><p>Having received a message from the Association of Magi, Shishigou had decided to temporarily withdraw from Trifas, where they\u2019d been hiding, to go to Sighi\u0219oara. Famous for its historical buildings and architecture, this city appeared to be currently ruled by fear due to a serial killer that had suddenly appeared.</p><p>\u201C\u2026So. Why are we here?\u201D</p><p>\u201CBecause the Association magi who were on standby here as backup have been massacred.\u201D</p><p>The somewhat unbalanced pair drank coffee at an open terrace caf\xE9 under the clear autumn sky. Saber of Red turned her face away in displeasure, and Shishigou silently read the city\u2019s local newspaper.</p><p>\u201CMagi have been massacred\u2026 huh.\u201D</p><p>There were no openings in Trifas for Association magi to enter the town, but the nearby city of Sighi\u0219oara was a different matter. Many magi had been stationed here as backup personnel. While their strength in battle was inferior to that of the magi hired as the Red Masters, there were countless other things they could do such as surveillance and despatching familiars.</p><p>They had diligently observed the battle between Saber of Black and Lancer of Red outside Trifas as well and had provided valuable information for Shishigou.</p><p>However, he appeared to have suddenly lost all communication with them. The Association of Magi had ordered them to give periodic reports. It was only natural to think that something abnormal had occurred.</p><p>\u201CIt\u2019s possible that a Servant is involved. So, we were called to go and check it out since we\u2019re acting freely on our own.\u201D</p><p>\u201CSoul devouring, huh\u2026 But why are they doing that here instead of Trifas?\u201D</p><p>In order for a Servant to remain secured to this world, an enormous amount of prana is necessary. Providing that prana is the Master\u2019s role, but second- and third-rate magi or simply ordinary people who became Masters cannot do even that. As a result, they have to attack innocent people and supplement their Servants with human souls.</p><p>It was a normal practice, but depending on the nature of the Heroic Spirit, there were Servants that would object to that method. Also, even for magi, using this method was a humiliation that was equivalent to declaring they were cornered or were a second-rate magus. There weren\u2019t that many magi who would willingly choose to do so.</p><p>\u201CThat\u2019s also one of the things we\u2019ll be investigating. Maybe they didn\u2019t want to cause a disturbance in Trifas, or\u2014\u201D</p><p>Shishigou spread out his newspaper and pointed at a simply drawn map. In the beginning, the murder had started at Bucharest and then gradually went north. Seeing that, Saber nodded in understanding.</p><p>\u201CMaybe they\u2019re devouring souls while heading towards Trifas.\u201D</p><p>\u201CExactly. All the Red Servants have been gathered according to Shirou, and he said that they aren\u2019t devouring any souls. If we trust those words, then the culprit must be the only one whose presence hasn\u2019t been confirmed yet among the Black Servants\u2014Assassin.\u201D</p><p>He felt it was somewhat dangerous to trust Shirou Kotomine\u2019s words, but he wouldn\u2019t lie about something like this. And, of the Black Servants, the deceased Saber and the ones within the Fortress of Millennia, Lancer, Rider, Archer and Berserker, had already battled against some of the Red Servants at least once. Based on the quality of the golems they fought, Caster, who was presumed to be a golem-user, was also probably among them.</p><p>Only Assassin\u2019s presence hadn\u2019t been confirmed. Of course, with Assassin\u2019s class skill, [Presence Concealment], the possibility that the Servant was on standby in the Fortress of Millennia couldn\u2019t be discarded, but\u2026</p><p>In any case, they had to obtain confirmation. If the serial killer was a Servant, he would have Saber fight them. Even if that wasn\u2019t the case, the serial killer was an enemy due to having killed the magi despatched by the Association. They should try to get rid of any future worries as much as possible.</p><p>\u201CIt\u2019s fine if it\u2019s a Servant\u2026 So, what do we do?\u201D</p><p>\u201CWe\u2019ll wait until night. In the meantime, I intend to go look at the corpses of the dead magi at the morgue.\u201D</p><p>\u201CHmm. And me?\u201D</p><p>\u201COf course I\u2019d be grateful if you accompanied me. But it\u2019s daytime, so I won\u2019t force you. It\u2019s a waste, but if I judge that I\u2019m in a dangerous situation, I\u2019ll immediately summon you with a Command Spell.\u201D</p><p>However, Shishigou didn\u2019t think he\u2019d have to use a Command Spell anyway. All the incidents happened at night. Perhaps the serial killer was protecting the war\u2019s minimum rule of not acting during the day, or perhaps there was a reason why the culprit had to kill at night. Either way, the chances of being attacked during the daytime were so low that he could ignore the danger. So he essentially intended to treat this as free time.</p><p>\u201CWho would go to a gloomy place like a morgue? Now, what should I do\u2026?\u201D</p><p>Saber apparently decided to stroll around the streets. Fortunately, Sighi\u0219oara was one of Romania\u2019s tourist spots, with buildings that boasted of hundreds of years of history and were preserved even to this day. There was no way anyone would get tired of\u2014no, wait.</p><p>After he parted with her and was in the midst of heading to the morgue, Shishigou realized a crucial point. She was a Servant, a person who had lived in the far past.</p><p>\u201CNow that I think about it, there\u2019s no way she hasn\u2019t seen such things before.\u201D</p><p>Even if people said the buildings had a \u2018Middle Ages\u2019 look, she had lived in that very era.</p><p>Shishigou predicted that, at first, Saber would wander through the streets expecting to see new and curious things, but gradually notice and mutter to herself, \u201CHuh, there\u2019s not much difference from the era I lived in?\u201D, and then immediately become displeased and kill time while sulking\u2014</p><p>\u201CIt was so boring\u2026\u201D</p><p>Shishigou and Saber met back up when the sun started to set. With a truly disappointed expression, Saber voraciously ate a massive quantity of baked sweets she appeared to have bought at a street stall half out of despair.</p><p>\u201C\u2026I thought so.\u201D</p><p>\u201CEven though I wanted to see skyscrapers, there weren\u2019t any at all. The buildings that tourists gathered around had nothing strange about them at all\u2026 Damn it, I wasted my time feeling out of place.\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2026I thought so.\u201D</p><p>\u201CAfter this, I can\u2019t calm down unless I fight a Servant! So, how did things go on your end?\u201D</p><p>\u201CRejoice, Saber. I have good news for you. I checked the dead bodies, but they really were in a horrible state.\u201D</p><p>Shishigou said that happily, and Saber squinted at him suspiciously.</p><p>\u201CWhat does that mean?\u201D</p><p>\u201CSome of them were attacked with edged tools and blunt weapons\u2026 or others with punches and kicks. There\u2019s evidence that some of the victims used guns or magecraft. And almost all of them had their hearts gouged out.\u201D</p><p>\u201CHearts?\u201D</p><p>\u201CThe place where the spiritual core is located for a Servant, and the internal organ said to be the source of life for humans. They might have been eaten in a ritual in order to obtain prana.\u201D</p><p>Saber thought about it for a short while, and then muttered to herself.</p><p>\u201C\u2026Were they eaten raw?\u201D</p><p>\u201CDon\u2019t say such unpleasant things\u2026 I\u2019d find it scarier if they were eaten cooked.\u201D</p><p>To eat the heart raw was to use it for a ritual, but to cook and then eat it meant the act was a hobby. Of the two, the people who did the latter were more terrifying.</p><p>\u201CIn any case, I hope that it\u2019s a Servant we\u2019re after. I won\u2019t forgive you if you\u2019re wrong.\u201D</p><p>\u201CI\u2019ll face the Master. That guy is also completely breaking the universal rule of magi of hiding their mysteries\u2026\u201D</p><p>Articles in the newspapers were already showily declaring, \u201CJack the Ripper reborn in Romania\u201D, and the entire country was gripped with fear. No matter how Shishigou thought about it, he could only think that a magus who would leave this situation alone had gone completely insane.</p><p>Even though nighttime had only just descended in Sighi\u0219oara, both the tourists and local inhabitants were already taking refuge in the safety of their homes.</p><p>\u201CDid you find anywhere suitable when you were wandering around?\u201D</p><p>Shishigou nodded. The people who had become victims had at first been hoodlums and gangster, and it was conjectured that the serial killer had broken into the buildings where they gathered and massacred them. However, after that\u2014just after Association magi had been despatched to Sighi\u0219oara as rear backup, it appeared that the killer\u2019s aim had narrowed down to only them.</p><p>In other words, it was fine to think that there was a high chance that the killer would aim for Shishigou Kairi next, as he was now the only magus in Sighi\u0219oara.</p><p>\u201CSaber, just in case, change into your armor. The enemy is Assassin. You might not have time to change your clothes if you receive a surprise attack.\u201D</p><p>She nodded at his words and clad her entire body in her steel armor. Fortunately, due to the effect of the incidents, they were the only ones walking down the road at night. They might pass by vigilant policemen, but they could simply deceive them with suggestion magecraft then.</p><p>\u201CAll right\u2026 let\u2019s go.\u201D</p><p>Thus, the magus and Servant began boldly walking down the street, using themselves as bait.</p><hr><p>\u201CThere really isn\u2019t anyone out at all.\u201D</p><p>Rikudou Reika sighed as she looked down at the dead streets with no sign of humans present from a third-story window. It was always like this here recently. When it became nighttime, the city became as still as death.</p><p>\u201CMother, shouldn\u2019t we move to a different town soon?\u201D</p><p>Reika\u2019s Servant\u2014Assassin of Black pulled at her shirt sleeve.</p><p>\u201CI suppose so. Next is Trifas, right?\u201D</p><p>Assassin nodded her head. But then her expression immediately turned downcast.</p><p>\u201CBut, that might be a bit dangerous. Since all the others are still alive.\u201D</p><p>\u201CThe others?\u201D</p><p>\u201CThe other Servants like us.\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2026Yeah. Now that you mention it, there are others besides Jack. It\u2019d be a bit scary to go where they are.\u201D</p><p>Reika commented in a carefree manner, and Assassin also agreed.</p><p>\u201CYeah. We are Assassin, after all. Surprise attacks are our specialty, but it\u2019s impossible for us to face multiple enemies. We would definitely die first.\u201D</p><p>Assassin, with the face of a very young girl, calmly spoke that cold fact.</p><p>\u201CBut they\u2019re trying to kill each other, right?\u201D</p><p>\u201CYes. The magi and Servant have divided into the Red and Black camps and should be in the midst of fighting each other.\u201D</p><p>\u201CThen for now, why don\u2019t we go over there while at the same time taking a wait-and-see approach? If there\u2019s a chance, you can go and eat, and if it\u2019s dangerous, we can run away.\u201D</p><p>Assassin of Black thought over Reika\u2019s suggestion for a short while. Although Reika and Assassin were connected through their contract, Reika was a complete amateur when it came to magecraft, so she could provide almost no prana. Therefore, Assassin had been supplying herself with prana by devouring the souls of humans.</p><p>Naturally, this method had heavy demerits for a Servant, but there were slight merits to it as well. Reika didn\u2019t emit any presence of magecraft, so the chances of being discovered by another Master were extremely low. If Assassin used [Presence Concealment] as well, Rikudou Reika would probably be overlooked as a completely ordinary human.</p><p>Most of all, Assassin wanted to confirm how many Servants that she couldn\u2019t kill herself currently remained.</p><p>\u201CYeah, we could go now. \u2014But it seems another magus has come to this city.\u201D</p><p>After pondering whether to go to Trifas, the two of them came to a decision for the time being.</p><p>\u201COh my, is that so? Then shall we make them your last meal in Sighi\u0219oara?\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2026Yeah, let\u2019s. But Mother, you can\u2019t come to watch today. It might be more dangerous than usual.\u201D</p><p>\u201CAll right. Then I\u2019ll wait here. Take care.\u201D</p><p>\u201CYeah. We\u2019re heading out. Hey, hey. When we come back, we want to eat hamburgers again\u2026 Is that okay?\u201D</p><p>\u201COf course. I\u2019ve already bought the ingredients, so I\u2019ll borrow the kitchen to make it.\u201D</p><p>Assassin was bashfully happy at those words, and then she jumped out from the third-story window. Reika waved her hand with a smile and watched her depart.</p><p>Now then. Reika didn\u2019t know when exactly Assassin would return, but in any case, she had to prepare a delicious meal for that darling girl\u2014</p><hr><p>There was no town as unique as Sighi\u0219oara in Romania or even all of Europe. This was referring to its \u2018unchanging\u2019 nature. It was a small town with a population of thirty thousand, but the people who came to sightsee felt as if they had slipped back in time to the Middle Ages just by walking through the town\u2019s historical district, which was labelled a World Heritage Site.</p><p>If you walked through the extremely rough, stone-paved hill road, you would find private houses that looked exactly the same as they had in the sixteenth century lining the streets and even public squares where witch trials were once held.</p><p>Other sightseeing spots included the home in which Vlad III was born (it was now a restaurant), the town\u2019s landmark clock tower, and a church at the top of the mountain in the old city district. At any rate, the town was the most suitable sightseeing area for foreigners to experience the \u2018Europe of the past\u2019.</p><p>And presently, Sighi\u0219oara was gripped by fear due to a serial killer. It was a ghastly situation where visiting tourists had been murdered one after another and all their corpses had their hearts gouged out.</p><p>There was no evidence besides the corpses left behind, and no link could be found between the victims at all. But only a select few people knew the truth. The victims were all magi\u2014in other words, something extraordinarily \u2018abnormal\u2019 was occurring in Sighi\u0219oara.</p><p>Shishigou and Saber of Red had been walking for an hour now through the streets, lit faintly by sodium-vapor lamps, on edge all the while. Saber\u2019s armor clinked noisily, but fortunately there was no one around who questioned them. A drunken homeless man carrying a wine bottle in one hand gazed at Shishigou and Saber with an open-mouthed expression. Not even bothering to use suggestion magecraft, Shishigou waved his hand at him, and the man banged his head and started drinking again.</p><p>Although they encountered policemen several times, they were immediately driven away using Shishigou\u2019s suggestion magecraft. Even the policemen probably didn\u2019t want the duty of remaining on watch for a crazy killer. Shishigou was able to drive them away without even forcing them that much.</p><p>But more importantly, Saber was more serious now. Not long ago, she\u2019d been complaining with \u201CThis is boring\u201D, \u201CSo dull\u201D, and \u201CAre they here yet?\u201D over and over again, but now she had gone silent.</p><p>\u201CWhat\u2019s wrong, Saber?\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2026Sorry, please let me concentrate. I have a bad feeling here.\u201D</p><p>Shishigou\u2019s face tensed at her words. If she was taking such a vigilant attitude, then there was definitely a Servant nearby.</p><p>At some point, their pace slowed down and became cautious. They surveyed their surroundings\u2014the dim glow of the streets lamps seemed to conversely make their vision fuzzier. A freezing gust passed through that seemed to lick at the nape of Shishigou\u2019s neck.</p><p>\u201C\u2026A mist is forming.\u201D</p><p>Just as Saber said, before they knew it, a mist broke out around the two of them. This would obstruct their vision more and more\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014no, wait.</p><p>\u201CMist\u2026?\u201D</p><p>Even though the air was clear just moments ago, could a mist so thick it obstructed their vision just suddenly appear? \u2026Impossible.</p><p>Shishigou and Saber stopped walking at nearly the same time. Saber already had her sword out, and Shishigou had his hands on the holster of his favorite shotgun.</p><p>\u201CThis mist is\u2026\u201D</p><p>The instant that Shishigou tried to mutter something, the inside of his nose was struck by pain like scattering sparks. He reflexively coughed and covered his mouth.</p><p>\u201CMaster!?\u201D</p><p>\u201CIt\u2019s poison! Don\u2019t breathe, Saber!\u201D</p><p>Shishigou crouched down as he covered his mouth and nose. Even just breathing a little caused the inside of his nose to explode in pain and his vision started to falter.</p><p>\u201CHey, hang on, Master!\u201D</p><p>Making an instant decision, Shishigou took off his jacket and used it to cover his mouth and nose. The jacket, made from the skin of a magical beast, was able to cancel most Single-Action spells. When he breathed through the jacket, the pain was mitigated slightly. It appeared that the mist really was created out of prana.</p><p>\u201C\u2026Damn it. For now, let\u2019s get out of this mist.\u201D</p><p>\u201CYeah, if you\u2019re able to run, that is! I\u2019ll pull you along, follow me!\u201D</p><p>Saber held her sword in her right hand and tightly grasped Shishigou\u2019s hand in her left as she began to run. Fortunately, perhaps because her Magic Resistance rank was high, Saber seemed to receive nearly no damage from the mist and didn\u2019t appear to mind the worsening visibility at all. Her sharp [Instinct] made the mist no obstruction at all for her.</p><p>But Saber and Shishigou were both certain. Since this wasn\u2019t an ordinary mist, naturally something would come \u2018next\u2019. The issue was just when it would happen\u2026 Even as she ran and tried to escape from the mist, Saber prudently estimated the timing when it would occur.</p><p>Perhaps because she\u2019d been able to precisely choose their escape route, the mist gradually started to fade away.</p><p>\u2014People always wish for relief. When they fell into a dangerous situation, no matter how much they calmly dealt with the situation, their minds would relax immediately after they escaped from it.</p><p>\u2014For just a moment right after they escaped from the jaws of death that lay in wait for them, no matter what kind of person they were, there was an opening when they stopped to take a breather.</p><p>\u2014Serial killers never overlooked that moment of relaxation. They would hold their blades, which had sipped the blood of countless people, and quietly creep up behind them.</p><p>\u201CAll right, we\u2019re out\u2026!\u201D</p><p>Saber and Shishigou succeeded in getting out of the mist. In that instant, the only thought in Shishigou\u2019s head was to breathe fresh air. Having escaped from the fear of death, his mind relaxed just slightly. From behind him, an assassin crept up to slit his throat\u2014</p><p>But Saber, who was standing in front of Shishigou, swung down the sword in her right hand just as she spun around, and sent Shishigou rolling on the ground due to lightly brushing his feet.</p><p>There was a flash.</p><p>A shrill sound resounded on the stone-paved ground. Saber\u2019s slash had struck away the knife grasped in Assassin\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201C\u2026Ah.\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2014Sorry, but that guy\u2019s my Master. The one you\u2019ll be fighting is me.\u201D</p><p>When Shishigou turned around, there was someone standing still almost right behind him. He hadn\u2019t noticed\u2014in spite of getting this close to him, he hadn\u2019t noticed at all.</p><p>And he was struck with amazement by one more thing.</p><p>The person standing behind Shishigou was a young girl. She looked two or three years younger than his own Servant, Saber of Red. She had short and messy silver hair and ice-blue eyes, which were widened slightly in surprise. She had several knife scabbards hanging along her waist, but she didn\u2019t have the vital skirt to cover her lower body. Together with the leather clothes on her upper body, she had a sensuous atmosphere like a prostitute despite her very young appearance.</p><p>\u201CYou slashed at us. How horrible.\u201D</p><p>Muttering that, she looked straight at Saber\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201C\u2014What do you mean, \u2018horrible\u2019? A lowlife like you who devours souls despite being a Servant has no right to say that!\u201D</p><p>Not bothering to hide her displeasure, Saber thrusted her sword before her in preparation. Assassin, not seeming to fear the sword, tilted her head and replied with an extremely innocent expression.</p><p>\u201CThere\u2019s nothing wrong with that\u2026 right?\u201D</p><p>The next instant, Saber repelled a knife thrown at her face with her gauntlet. Assassin had thrown a knife with an extremely natural movement while speaking without the slightest visible quiver of her wrist.</p><p>The reason Saber was able to respond to the sudden surprise attack was due to her instincts and skill. But an opening was created the instant she blocked the knife with her gauntlet and Assassin jumped behind her. The mist was still wafting strongly in the air there and immediately masked her from sight.</p><p>\u201CWait here, Master!\u201D</p><p>After saying that, Saber once more leapt into the mist. Breathing in the mist made her body feel somewhat heavier, but Saber judged that it wouldn\u2019t impede her at this level.</p><p>She strained her ears for the faintest sound and swung her sword according to her instincts. The same sound as earlier resounded\u2014she had struck down a thrown scalpel.</p><p>\u201CWow. You\u2019re really good.\u201D</p><p>Saber clicked her tongue at the girl\u2019s voice. The voice could be heard from all directions and she couldn\u2019t pinpoint its origin at all.</p><p>\u201CSpare me your prattle. What good are the words of a \u2018cleaner\u2019 like Assassin who isn\u2019t even a Heroic Spirit? No, you\u2019re not even a cleaner. You\u2019re just a killer, just a murderer!\u201D</p><p>\u201COh? How did you know?\u201D</p><p>\u201CWhat\u2014?\u201D</p><p>Saber\u2019s mind was frozen with shock for an instant.</p><p>\u201COur name is Jack the Ripper. Hey, hey, hey, hey, won\u2019t you tell us your name too?\u201D</p><p>The voice whispered right in her ear. Saber immediately swung her sword in that direction, but she felt no resistance against her blade as she merely cut through mist. But right now, the fact that she had learned the enemy\u2019s true name was more important.</p><p>\u2014It was an incident from a hundred and twenty years ago. The people of London in Great Britain had trembled in terror. The people he targeted were all prostitutes from the East End. The number of people he murdered was in fact only five. In spite of that, he was the world\u2019s first serial killer, who left behind many legends and mysteries before he disappeared.</p><p>Based from a signature written in a letter posted in the newspapers, people called him Jack the Ripper.</p><p>It was only a hundred and twenty years ago. From the viewpoint of other mysteries with firm concepts that were far more ancient, this Servant was probably the most fragile in this regard in this Great Holy Grail War.</p><p>King Arthur had gone out on many campaigns and earned many magnificent achievements. Mordred herself had etched her name into history as the Knight of Treachery. Other Servants were also generally the same. Though their eras and societies differed, they should have overcome many legendary battles and left their names behind in the memories of the people.</p><p>But\u2014Saber adjusted her grip on the handle of her sword and focused her mind.</p><p>Why had someone like a murderer been elevated to a level where she could be summoned as a Servant?</p><p>\u2026The only possible explanation was that it was because the murderer\u2019s career had been shrouded in too much mystery and filled the people with too much terror. People might cheer as they watched a hero fight. They might be filled with courage and vie with one another as they hoisted up their fists. But this girl was different.</p><p>She etched her name into the world with arbitrary, thorough and despairing slaughter. If there were those who believed in her, they were surely other murderers just like her.</p><p>Indeed, she was appropriate as Assassin. Without any sound or sign of her presence, she simply killed her target. There was no one else who specialized in killing Masters as much as her.</p><p>To Saber, this mist wasn\u2019t much of an obstruction. However, due to Assassin\u2019s class skill [Presence Concealment], she couldn\u2019t grasp her presence at all. Since Assassin\u2019s voice was resounding around Saber, she should definitely be nearby, but\u2014</p><p>\u201CAh, just like we thought! You\u2019re a woman, aren\u2019t you?\u201D</p><p>Saber involuntarily ground her teeth slightly at those words.</p><p>\u201CIn that case\u2014\u201D</p><p>\u201CYeah. In that case\u2014\u201D</p><p>\u201CLet\u2019s do it.\u201D</p><p>\u2014It sounded as if she were conversing with someone. An eerie slug-like feeling that Saber hadn\u2019t experienced in a long while slightly passed through her chest.</p><p>This was fear. An unknown assassin lurking in the darkness. She never fought head on, always using surprised attacks, always taking the initiative. If Saber mistakenly predicted her next move, it would instantly lead to her own death.</p><p>So\u2014what should she do?</p><p>\u201C\u2026Hah. Don\u2019t underestimate me, you shitty brat!!\u201D</p><p>An instant reply. Saber stored her helm into her armor as if tearing off the skin upon which the fear clung to her. At the same time as she exposed her noble-looking face, she raised the sword in her hand and shouted.</p><p>\u201C\u2026Crimson Lightning!\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2014\u2014\u201D</p><p>If there was an eerie darkness, than she just needed to blow it away with her own light. She poured all her prana into her sword, making it spew crimson lightning around her.</p><p>The mist literally vanished\u2014and Assassin looked at Saber with an open-mouthed expression.</p><p>\u201CIt\u2019s over, Assassin. If you\u2019re going to scream out to your heart\u2019s content, now\u2019s your chance. Once I behead you, you won\u2019t be able to scream anymore.\u201D</p><p>\u201CWe don\u2019t wanna. Our tummy is still empty.\u201D</p><p>Speaking like a child, she held a butcher knife in each of her hand.</p><p>\u201CYou should give up and run away,\u201D said Saber with a fearless smile while she timed the moment to activate [Prana Burst].</p><p>Since the mist had vanished, her body was no longer weighed down. So there should have been no way for Saber, a Servant of the strongest class, to fall behind the likes of a murderer that couldn\u2019t hide in the darkness.</p><p>Watching their fight from afar, Shishigou had the utmost faith regarding that point. However, there was just one factor that made him uneasy. After getting out of the mist, he had taken out a piece of equipment from his jacket pocket.</p><p>It was the wrist of a magical monkey cast in adipocere wax. In situations where he wasn\u2019t able to move from where he was, he used this wrist to quickly construct a Bounded Field that warded people away. It wasn\u2019t a half-hearted piece of magecraft either. The wrist crawled around independently like a mouse, and as it did so it created a completely locked-out area as if cutting off that space from everything else.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t tried it out yet, but even if he were in an intersection in the streets of New York at night or of Shibuya in Tokyo, he was confident that he could completely clear people out of the area. Though there existed eyes besides those of people, such as cameras, in such downtown districts, so it wouldn\u2019t be effective in the first place.</p><p>\u2014The source of his unease was\u2026</p><p>\u2026the fact that they were in the unfavorable emergency situation, as someone had managed to break into this space where everyone besides him and the two female Servants in front of him had cleared away.</p><p>His palm hurt as if it were being stabbed by needles. That was how Shishigou sensed that an intruder had penetrated his Bounded Field.</p><p>\u201CSaber!\u201D</p><p>His words exploded into the air as the critical situation continued to unfold. Saber of Red and Assassin of Black were both charging at each other.</p><p>Saber was aiming to swing her sword down from above and cut Assassin in half in a single stroke with the force of a surging wave. On the other hand, Assassin was challenging her to close-combat again with movements so smooth they were terribly eerie. Her target was the nape of Saber\u2019s neck, a vital point. If Saber\u2019s strike was a superhuman attack that transcended the domain of humans, then Assassin had abandoned humanity so thoroughly that she had reached the domain of inhuman beasts.</p><p>\u2014I\u2019ll win.</p><p>The instant she leapt forward, Saber was certain of that. She had no doubt that her strike would deliver a fatal wound to Assassin. The timing, speed, power; everything was in perfect sync.</p><p>\u2014But.</p><p>At the same time, Saber\u2019s mind was bothered by Shishigou\u2019s shout. There was definitely a reason for the shout just now. If not, he wouldn\u2019t have called out her name. When she had thought that far, she realized it with a chill.</p><p>She didn\u2019t know where. But she was definitely being aimed at.</p><p>A throw or shot from long distance. The enemy was probably Lancer or Archer. Either way, at this rate she would be killed\u2026!</p><p>Her body moved before her logical thought caught up. She just slightly put the brakes on her intense forward charge and forcefully screwed her body around. This was all she could do now. Slanting her body, she looked at the clock tower that was one of this city\u2019s landmarks.</p><p>She gazed at it in amazement. Two figures stood at the pinnacle of the clock tower. Illuminated by the faint moonlight, the person she saw pointing a bow and arrow at her there was definitely a Servant\u2014!</p><p>The next instant, a shock wave and a thunderous roar hit Saber\u2019s entire body.</p><hr><p>The fired arrow hit just as planned. But the target hadn\u2019t moved as planned. Without lowering his bow, Archer loaded his next arrow.</p><p>\u201CDid you succeed?\u201D</p><p>Archer shook his head at the question of his Master, Fiore.</p><p>\u201CNo. Unfortunately, Saber dodged the attack just now. She really does deserve to be called a member of the strongest class.\u201D</p><p>\u201CAnd Assassin\u2014?\u201D</p><p>\u201CAssassin avoided a fatal blow as well. Though I did manage to inflict a wound on her.\u201D</p><p>Sighi\u0219oara\u2019s famous clock tower boasted of being the tallest building in the city, with a height of sixty-four meters, and, just as one could see nearly the entire town from atop it, the tower was visible from everywhere in town.</p><p>It consisted of a central spire surrounded by four smaller spires. Above even the tower\u2019s highest hallway, Archer and Fiore stood on an outcropping so small that it that couldn\u2019t even be called a thin foothold.</p><p>The reason Archer was able to calmly stand somewhere that normal people wouldn\u2019t be able to endure for even a few seconds was probably due to his innate sense of balance. It was nothing to be surprised about for someone of his caliber.</p><p>The problem was his Master, Fiore. Her legs were disabled due to the effect of her degenerated Magic Circuits. Normally she was incapable of standing, and the foothold wasn\u2019t wide enough to hold her wheelchair either. In spite of that, she was on that foothold. However, she wasn\u2019t standing.</p><p>Her feet were suspended in midair. Long metal arms were extending out from her back and supporting her body on the small foothold.</p><p>\u201C\u2014Master. It appears that Assassin of Black has decided to retreat.\u201D</p><p>\u201CThen we\u2019ll move on to fight Saber of Red just as planned. Archer, please face Saber. I\u2019ll fight with her Master Shishigou Kairi.\u201D</p><p>If possible, she wished they could have killed both Assassin of Black and Saber of Red together with that last attack. If one were to ask which they prioritized between Assassin of Black and Saber of Red, the answer would naturally be Saber. Now that they had lost their camp\u2019s Saber, she was a Servant that they absolutely wanted to take down here and now.</p><p>\u201CMaster. Please don\u2019t overextend yourself.\u201D</p><p>\u201CYes\u2026 I know.\u201D</p><p>By Archer\u2019s judgement, Saber\u2019s Master Shishigou Kairi and his own Master Fiore were nearly even in ability. Shishigou was superior when it came to experience and Fiore was superior when it came to sense. The only remaining factor was how calmly either of them could deal with this battle situation.</p><p>Saber\u2019s angry gaze pierced Archer. Her exposed face was surprisingly young and beautiful. But Archer, having seen many heroes, could tell. She definitely had the disposition of a hero.</p><p>Feeling a sense of exaltation as if the bottom of his stomach was ablaze\u2014Archer smiled bitterly. It appeared that he himself was still a green youth. Or perhaps it was due to being summoned in the form from his heyday. As he was now, Archer leaned toward recklessness so much that it surprised even him.</p><p>Saber exchanged a glance with her Master Shishigou for just an instant, and then immediately charged in Archer\u2019s direction. It wouldn\u2019t take her even ten seconds to reach the clock tower.</p><p>Fiore matched her and headed towards Shishigou while circumventing Saber\u2019s path.</p><p>Saber\u2019s gaze turned towards Fiore for an instant. Instantly, Archer fired his nocked arrow at her to deter her from doing anything to Fiore.</p><p>Saber cut down the arrow with a single stroke. That seemed to decide Saber\u2019s mind. Without glancing at Fiore any further, she charged straight at Archer\u2014</p><hr><p>Saber had needed five seconds to regain her footing after Archer\u2019s shot. But by the time those five seconds had passed, Assassin had already withdrawn.</p><p>She clicked her tongue\u2014her regret over not killing Assassin and her hatred towards Archer for getting in the way made Saber\u2019s face twist in anger.</p><p>\u201CMaster. Assassin has run away, while Archer\u2019s over there. Who should I attack? I personally recommend Archer who\u2019s so full of himself on the clock tower.\u201D</p><p>Saber asked that question while pointing her sword at the clock tower, and Shishigou just scratched his head with a sigh. His answer was already decided for him. In addition, it\u2019d be very difficult to chase after Assassin now that she had run away. Anyhow, they wouldn\u2019t be able to catch her by sight at all due to her [Presence Concealment] skill.</p><p>\u201C\u2026You seem pretty intent on fighting Archer yourself. Well, that\u2019s the correct decision. I\u2019ll take care of his Master.\u201D</p><p>\u201CSorry about this, Master. Then, I\u2019m off to crush Archer.\u201D</p><p>Saber grinned happily. She could also tell with her eyes that Archer was nocking his next arrow. Her normal full-throttle speed wouldn\u2019t be enough to reach him in time. However\u2014</p><p>Saber had the [Prana Burst] skill. By taking off her Noble Phantasm helm, she could clad her body in prana even further and could explosively accelerate herself by instantly releasing it all in a jet burst.</p><p>\u201CAll right\u2026 Saber, go and get him!\u201D</p><p>\u201CAye!!\u201D</p><p>The instant after she yelled out her agreement to Shishigou, she disappeared in a flash. She had taken a single, powerful step forward. She was like a human-shaped cannonball. She flew towards where that distant bowman should be.</p><p>Archer didn\u2019t move. Saber glanced at Archer\u2019s Master as she headed towards Shishigou while circumventing around Saber. However, an arrow flew towards Saber to prevent her from touching the female Master.</p><p>As she cut the arrow with her sword, Saber smiled.</p><p>\u2014You don\u2019t need to worry, Archer. The one I want to crush is you.</p><p>Archer\u2019s Master was going to face Saber\u2019s own Master, Shishigou. He wouldn\u2019t lose before her. She felt a little surprised when she realized that she believed that. She had never trusted those known as magi before now. She had thought of magi as all being shut-ins with extremely twisted personalities. No, in reality, the magi that she had met until now were generally like that.</p><p>But there were also the sort of magi that get along well with her. The type that was foolhardy and reckless, thinking 90% on attack and 10% on defense.</p><p>Speaking of which, the catalyst that summoned her was a fragment from the Round Table. In other words, it wouldn\u2019t have been strange for any of the other Knights of the Round Table\u2014like Lancelot, who slighted her father, or Gawain, that annoying honor student\u2014to have been summoned instead.</p><p>And yet, the one who was summoned was her. She considered the meaning of that. She thought that, at some point, she would have to properly think it over. In order to obtain the Holy Grail for herself.</p><p>At that point, Saber stopped her extraneous thoughts. She was heading for the sixty-meter-tall clock tower. She only needed twelve steps to reach it. Instead of ascending it with both her hands and feet, she dashed straight up the 90-degree-angle outer wall with just her two feet.</p><p>Archer was already right before her. She could see not only his form, but even his expression. He was a man of delicate features clad in leather armor. Indeed, the style of his appearance was truly that of a bowman. But now that she had gotten this close, there was no longer anything that Archer could do.</p><p>Archery was the most superior when it came to long-range sniping. Even when compared to modern guns, it still had a huge advantage due to being able to shoot almost completely silently. Of course, in order to hit the target with an arrow, one requires unimaginably harsh training and innate talent. But there was no way a Heroic Spirit summoned as Archer would lack those. So the Archer class was nearly invincible as long as it remained at long range from the enemy.</p><p>But if there was a Servant fast enough to close him from long range to close range, the situation would be completely overturned.</p><p>A bowman also naturally has several weak points. Firstly, it was nearly impossible to shoot consecutively. Secondly, his location was easily exposed from the path of his arrows. Thirdly, a bow was extremely fragile at close range.</p><p>It was natural for Saber to feel confident of her victory. When the enemy had gotten so close, there was nothing a bowman could do\u2014that\u2019s how it should have been.</p><p>Completely unfazed by Saber\u2019s violent charge, Archer smoothly loaded his next arrow.</p><p>The nocked arrow was shot at Saber\u2019s face as she came at him right from below, but she flicked it away with her sword held in both her hands.</p><p>\u201CI got you, Archer\u2026!!\u201D</p><p>There was no time for him to nock another arrow. Just like with Assassin earlier, Saber was certain that she would kill him in a single strike.</p><p>But Archer was a Heroic Spirit with a long history of experience as a warrior. At that precise moment, he did something so unexpected that it surpassed even Saber\u2019s instincts. Without hesitation\u2014he threw himself off from the small and unreliable foothold into the air.</p><p>As Saber was paralyzed in shock, Archer nocked another arrow and fired it at Saber even as he fell towards the ground below. His target was naturally her chest, which should be thinly armored. However, an arrow shot by Archer\u2014Chiron of the Sagittarius\u2014would definitely kill everything in its path.</p><p>The arrow, clad in the light of the stars, forcibly smashed through Saber\u2019s armor. Something cold crept into her shoulder, and flashes of dizzying pain ran through her entire body one after another. But, probably thanks to her heavy armor, the arrow that had been aimed at her chest seemed to have been deflected and pierced her shoulder instead.</p><p>But such a thing wasn\u2019t comforting at all for Saber, who had been certain of her victory.</p><p>\u201CYou, bastard\u2026\u2026!!\u201D</p><p>Saber managed to drown out the intense pain, spreading like ripples from her shoulder to the rest of her body, with just her anger. Without hesitation, she went into a bullet dive straight at the still-falling Archer using [Prana Burst]\u2014!</p><p>She\u2019s like a shooting star, Archer thought. She wasn\u2019t graceful at all, but she was excessively strong and excessively violent, and so she possessed an enchanting light.</p><p>Indeed, Saber was a magnificent Heroic Spirit. She had to have a strong will to launch a counterattack immediately upon receiving his attack, ignoring the pain and impact from it.</p><p>In just several fractions of a second\u2014Saber would probably cut him down this time beneath her blade the moment he landed on the ground. Now then, what should he do to prevent that?</p><p>He couldn\u2019t use his archery. No matter how fast his arrows were, he was already at a disadvantage against a sword that would finish its motion just by being swung down. He had no sword or lance, he couldn\u2019t use his bow, he had no mount, there was no way he could go mad and rampage, and he couldn\u2019t stop this course of events with magecraft or dirks.</p><p>\u2014In that case. He had no choice but to fight with his final remaining weapon.</p><p>His sixty-meter fall, and his landing\u2014just before it came to an end, he vigorously struck the ground with one leg and slightly shifted his body to the side.</p><p>He extended both his arms. The roaring Saber noticed his inexplicable action, but she didn\u2019t have the time to take it into consideration.</p><p>With her sword brandished to strike combined with her explosive accelerated speed due to [Prana Burst] and with her being in her normal state excluding the release of her Noble Phantasm, there was no winning blow as perfect as this.</p><p>However, against what would definitely deal a fatal wound if it hit, Archer did something dreadful\u2014or rather, something \u2018crazy\u2019 like Saber herself would do.</p><p>He extended both arms, and before the charging Saber could swing down her sword, he coiled his arms around her. The instant her wrists were seized in a hold, her senses rang out in alarm. Forcefully halting her slash as it bit into his collarbone, Archer didn\u2019t negate the momentum of her charge but instead cleverly transferred her body weight and\u2014</p><p>A throwing technique\u2026!?</p><p>The instant that Saber realized what he was doing, she was flung through the air upside down. It was similar to a one-armed shoulder throw in judo, but the way it immobilized the joints of her wrists was completely merciless.</p><p>Archer\u2026 Chiron was the greatest sage among the centaurs and received various teachings from the gods such as learning medicine and music from the sun god Apollo and hunting from the goddess Artemis. And so, young and immature heroes gathered around him and learned various teachings and fighting techniques under his wing.</p><p>The sword, lance, and bow\u2014besides those, Archer had also acquired techniques for fighting bare-handed as a matter of course. They consisted of perfect hand-to-hand combat techniques that combined boxing and wrestling.</p><p>That fighting style was Pankration\u2014the world\u2019s oldest mixed martial arts spoken of in Ancient Greek tales.</p><p>\u201CGah\u2026!!\u201D</p><p>Hitting the deadly weapon known as the ground, Saber\u2019s eyes widened as she experienced an impact that seemed to make her very guts reverberate. Her entire body froze for just a few seconds as if she was tied down with chains. It was an extremely lethal situation for her\u2014however, despite the fact that Saber had fallen down, Archer didn\u2019t finish her off; instead, he fell down to his knees in anguish. The wound from the blade that had bit into his shoulder, even if it wasn\u2019t a fatal wound, was extremely close to being so.</p><p>Normally, there was no strength behind the part of the blade close to the handle, so Archer had judged that it would probably only be strong enough to cut his leather armor. But he had underestimated it too much. In spite of receiving Saber\u2019s strike under most likely the very best of conditions possible, the wound on his collarbone was too deep.</p><p>Most likely, his right shoulder wouldn\u2019t move until it was mended with healing magecraft. In other words, he couldn\u2019t use his bow until then. Archer smiled bitterly. He had intended to corner her, but he ended up being cornered instead. The decisive chance he had received in return had been reversed into a fatal situation for him.</p><p>He came to a decision without hesitation. He could not think of a way to deliver a final blow to Saber in this situation no matter how he moved or fought. If he effectively used the slightly less than three seconds it would take until Saber got back up, withdrawal was probably the best plan here.</p><p>Archer decided to report the situation to Fiore who was fighting a fierce battle of her own and recommend retreating.</p><hr><p>Necromancers start their training by first staring at their own death. They must hypnotize themselves and see their flesh decompose many, many times. Their reflection in the mirror rots away disgustingly before their eyes\u2014and they get used to it. They stare at death, carry death, and learn that life is always accompanied by death.</p><p>And necromancy is a craft that controls death.</p><p>Shishigou Kairi waited for the girl to arrive while smoking a cigarette. He didn\u2019t set up any detection or protective Bounded Fields, leaving himself far too defenseless.</p><p>But then, Shishigou knew quite well that there was no meaning in such things if the one he was going to face was her. Any Bounded Fields he made at this point would simply be a waste of his prana and tools.</p><p>Shishigou noticed the wind change direction slightly, and flicked away his still-lit cigarette.</p><p>He looked up at the sky above and called out to the young girl suspended in the air there.</p><p>\u201CNow then. You don\u2019t mind if we skip introducing ourselves, do you?\u201D</p><p>The man smirked, and the girl smiled in turn.</p><p>In a somewhat narrow alleyway caught between two buildings, Fiore Forvedge Yggdmillennia had stabbed the [arms] sprouting from her back into the walls of the buildings. The arms gave off the impression of being smooth yet hard, and were similar to insect legs\u2014that was what Shishigou thought.</p><p>\u201C\u2026Very well. There\u2019s no way either of us doesn\u2019t know each other\u2019s names. However, may I give a warning just in case?\u201D</p><p>\u201CGo ahead.\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2014Leave now, necromancer. All this far and wide land belongs to us Yggdmillennia. I will overlook your insolent trespassing should you leave. If you ignore this warning, your folly will be repaid with compensation equivalent to death.\u201D</p><p>\u201CHeh\u2026 So, do you think I\u2019ll obey that?\u201D</p><p>In response to Shishigou\u2019s words, Fiore spoke with a satisfied smile.</p><p>\u201CNo. But if I declare that first, I wouldn\u2019t be able to resolve myself inside.\u201D</p><p>I see, Shishigou thought with a wry smile. To put it another way, since she had warned him\u2014she wouldn\u2019t hesitate to kill him now.</p><p>And of course, Shishigou had no intention of obeying such a warning. His answer was to reach his hand for his shotgun. At that instant, the density of prana in the surrounding area thickened.</p><p>There was no more room for idle talk between them. Fiore knew that Shishigou Kairi was a freelance magus and that he surpassed her in terms of battle experience. Shishigou knew that Fiore Forvedge Yggdmillennia was a prodigy who bore the next era of the Yggdmillennia clan on her shoulders.</p><p>\u2014The magecraft this person uses is necromancy. However, his magecraft isn\u2019t as simple as turning corpses into ghouls and using them as slaves. For example, the small firearm he\u2019s holding\u2026</p><p>\u2014The magecraft this young lady uses are Euryphis and human engineering\u2026 If I remember right, her Mystic Code is called the Bronze-Link Manipulator.</p><p>The frozen atmosphere between the two of them was blown away by the metal lid of a garbage can nearby. Perhaps blown by the wind, it fell down noisily and caused the tension between them to explode. Shishigou pulled out his sawed-off shotgun in a single smooth motion and Fiore whirled down from the sky fiercely and resolutely.</p><p>He pulled the trigger\u2014and a bullet manufactured from a processed finger cut off from a magus sniffed out the presence of a magus and rushed out to hit her right in the head.</p><p>\u201C\u2014Jupiter: Tin Arm of Protection, intercept.\u201D</p><p>A fatal magic bullet that targeted the enemy\u2019s head without mistake and could not be dodged. That bullet, which wouldn\u2019t stop until it planted itself in the head of the enemy, was plucked away without hesitation by the arms sprouting from Fiore\u2019s back.</p><p>Shishigou\u2019s shock at this lasted for only an instant. Moving quickly to retreat, he hid himself on the other side of a car parked along the street. The two arms sprouting out from Fiore\u2019s back each split into two. With now four [arms] in total, two of them acted as substitute legs for her by stabbing themselves into the stone pavement. And the other two arms opened their jaws straight at Shishigou like menacing insects.</p><p><img src="https://i3.lensdump.com/i/1mY5We.webp" alt=""></p><p>\u201C\u2014Mars: Iron Arm of War, shoot.\u201D</p><p>With sounds similar to gunfire, [bullets of light] shot out from those openings. Those shots, which had force behind them equal to bullets, pulverized the stone pavement at Shishigou\u2019s feet.</p><p>\u201CAh, damn it. So those arms can do anything, huh\u2026!\u201D</p><p>While pigeonholing himself, Shishigou used the car as a shield and withstood the machine gun-like strafing fire of cursed bullets. He threw out his shotgun\u2019s empty cartridge and reloaded with a bullet from his waist pocket.</p><p>After shooting some restraining fire, he took out a processed owl eyeball and tossed it out through an opening in the car. It linked with the sight in his right eye, allowing him to survey the girl. First, he looked once more at the Mystic Code she wore.</p><p>According to the profile he\u2019d obtained beforehand, she should be burdened with the handicap of being unable to move her legs due to a defect of her Magic Circuits that was a physical peculiarity of hers.</p><p>However, with that Mystic Code, such a thing was no problem. To her, that Mystic Code was exceedingly excellent legs in and of itself. Since it was able to pluck away a fired bullet, even if it was at subsonic speeds, it surpassed other Mystic Codes in terms of precise movement.</p><p>\u2014The reaction speed of its autonomous defense was nearly perfect as well. Most likely, it was equal to that of the Volumen Hydrargyrum: Cerebrospinal Fluid of the Moon Spirit, the autonomous-type maid golem that accompanied the \u2018young mistress\u2019 of the El Melloi.</p><p>However, due to the difference in composition between mercury and metal arms, the arms would probably have trouble dealing with something like a claymore mine that attacks the entire surrounding area instead of a single point.</p><p>\u201C\u2026In other words, I\u2019ll have to use this.\u201D</p><p>Shishigou took out the heart of a magus from the inside pocket of his jacket. This internal organ, which had the teeth and nails of magi embedded inside it, was quite suitable as an anti-magus weapon. The teeth and nails it scattered upon detonation were charged with prana soaked in grudges and exerted an effect similar to a kind of [Gandr] when they hit a person\u2019s body. However, their effect was much stronger than that simple curse, perhaps because they were made from the body parts of the dead.</p><p>Put simply, when the teeth and nails penetrated a person\u2019s skin, their skin would decompose and melt away.</p><p>He pulled out the heart\u2019s muscle fiber like a pin, and the halted heart instantly began beating and pulsing. He confirmed her location with the owl eye. While remaining hidden behind the car, Shishigou used a bit of sudden airflow manipulation and threw the hand grenade heart at the perfect spot.</p><p>\u201CKuh\u2014\u2014!!\u201D</p><p>If Shishigou had made one mistake, it was using this hand grenade in the skirmish against the homunculi before, thereby showing it to Fiore and the others. Having collected and examined the corpses of the homunculi and then hypothesized the power and effect of the grenade from their decomposed state, she knew that this attack would be fatal.</p><p>\u201C\u2014Saturn: Lead Arm of Roaring, crush!\u201D</p><p>The metal arm that acted as her right leg seemed to turn itself flat like a spatula and squashed the rolling heart from above. The teeth and nails that should have been scattered into the surroundings with a destructive blast were pushed into the ground, unable to hurt Fiore\u2019s body.</p><p>But the fact that Shishigou had managed to gain even a little bit of time was important. Getting into the car that he was using as a shield, he pulled out a hidden spare key from the driver seat\u2019s sun visor and quickly started up the engine.</p><p>The instant that Fiore frantically turned around at the noisy sound of the engine\u2014he pressed down on the accelerator and the car ran her over from the front with a violent charge.</p><p>\u2014Geez! This person is so reckless and absurd!</p><p>Even as the car hood coiled around her, Fiore was not significantly injured. Her four artificial arms had instantly protected her.</p><p>However, at this rate she would definitely be crushed against a wall or something else. She dug her artificial arms into the car hood and pulled her body up. Her eyes met Shishigou\u2019s in the driver\u2019s seat\u2014and then he turned the handle sharply to the left in order to shake her off.</p><p>But two of Fiore\u2019s arms pierced into the car hood and completely fixed her body in place. Furthermore, she used her two remaining arms to tear off the car\u2019s front glass along with its roof.</p><p>Shishigou was now defenseless, but he had gotten his sawed-off shotgun in his hand without her noticing. He smiled in satisfaction\u2014and hit the brake. After having been hit by the car hood, Fiore was blown off this time by the sudden recoil.</p><p>Her four artificial arms detected that she was in a dangerous situation and stabbed into the stone pavement to act as a cushion. Instantly, Fiore understood. In this state, she couldn\u2019t intercept his attack with her artificial arms.</p><p>In the car\u2019s driver\u2019s seat, Shishigou pulled out his shotgun. She shuddered as she felt the presence of death\u2014and then he pulled the trigger and fired a magic bullet at subsonic speed. Fiore couldn\u2019t think of any countermeasures.</p><p>Oh n\u2026!?</p><p>And then, the silhouette of an animal quickly cut in before her.</p><p>\u201CWhat!?\u201D</p><p>The magic bullet smashed through the animal\u2019s brain, ending its mission. As Fiore was frozen in astonishment, someone hidden behind a nearby building called out.</p><p>\u201CNee-san, don\u2019t just stand there in shock!\u201D</p><p>\u201CAh. R-Right!\u201D</p><p>Fiore frantically stood up. Her artificial arms had already regained their flawless ready postures to protect her. She ordered her arms to release strafing fire with bullets of light all at once in order to blow way the car.</p><p>Clicking his tongue, Shishigou went back to hiding behind the car. He tried to figure out the identity of the person who had shouted just a moment ago.</p><p>\u201CNee-san, Nee-san, Nee-san\u2026 are you Caules Forvedge Yggdmillennia!?\u201D</p><p>\u201CThat\u2019s right!\u201D</p><p>Caules responded with a shout from behind the building. Things have gotten troublesome, Shishigou thought. Magi had to create a situation as advantageous as possible if a battle should increase beyond just one-on-one between them. Trying to fight alone against two magi was pure folly.</p><p>According to the profile Shishigou was given before the war started, this younger brother was so inferior when it came to magecraft that he couldn\u2019t even be compared to his older sister, but that just made fighting both of them all the more foolish. Being inferior in magecraft did not mean that he was weak when it came to fighting as well.</p><p>Rather, Shishigou knew well that the type of magi who would [do anything] in order to compensate for their inferior magecraft were far more formidable enemies. In the first place, this was not a battle of magecraft, but a war\u2014a fight to kill each other. No matter how much you excelled in magecraft, if you died, you lost.</p><p>\u201CCome out and show your face! How about introducing yourself fair and square like a magus!?\u201D</p><p>In response to Shishigou\u2019s provocation, Caules replied honestly.</p><p>\u201CI refuse! Do self-introductions elsewhere, you muscle-headed daruma!\u201D</p><p>What\u2019s up with that blunt refusal?\u2014Shishigou thought. In a complete reversal from earlier, he had fallen into checkmate. Honestly, he had no confidence that he could beat her in close combat. No matter how much he had trained himself as a human being, he couldn\u2019t do anything against those fearsome artificial arms\u2014the Bronze-Link Manipulator. In addition, Caules was his biggest obstacle. Shishigou couldn\u2019t concentrate on fighting her one-on-one. Could he be watchful of Caules while fighting Fiore? Rejected; that was impossible.</p><p>\u2026In other words, he needed something that would be sufficient to kill Fiore in a single strike.</p><p>\u201CThere\u2019s no way I can die while keeping my treasure unused.\u201D</p><p>He carefully took it out from his inside pocket. It was a knife with a thin blade that was hard to call practical in shape and design. This weapon did not automatically aim for the head like the finger of a magus that he had used earlier. But, this would kill the enemy if it hit. No, it would kill if it even touched someone.</p><p>When Shishigou accepted the request to participate in this Great Holy Gail War, he had asked for a baby hydra preserved in formalin as prior compensation. He had used each of the nine heads of the hydra to create either weapons or supplemental tools. This was an enchanted poisonous Mystic Code that should probably be kept in reserve for when he fought as a magus.</p><p>But\u2014he was stuck in a stalemate no matter what he did. Just before he resolved himself and entrusted himself to a make-or-break gamble\u2014the strafing fire suddenly stopped.</p><p>\u201C\u2026?\u201D</p><p>Finding it odd, he secretly peeked at Fiore to see her condition. With a calm expression you wouldn\u2019t expect to see in the midst of battle, she lightly nodded. And then, she spoke to Shishigou.</p><p>\u201CIt seems we must end things here.\u201D</p><p>\u201CI can still fight!\u201D</p><p>Shishigou shouted that while tightly gripping his knife. But Fiore shook her head and rejected that with a gentle gesture. When he saw her do that, Shishigou knew that he had lost the chance to use his trump card.</p><p>\u201CI\u2019ll be waiting in our fortress in Trifas for our next encounter. Shishigou-sama, I\u2019ll settle my battle with you next time.\u201D</p><p>Fiore said that and then quickly retreated. Her behavior was rather splendid, and not even a fragment of her desire to kill him here remained.</p><p>Shishigou quickly gave up on pursuing her. It was a self-evident truth that the pursuer had the advantage in battle, but it didn\u2019t cancel out the disadvantage of numbers. The advantage of pursuing and the disadvantage of numbers. There was no need to weight them on a scale to choose which option he should take.</p><p>\u201C\u2026Did something happen to her Servant?\u201D</p><p>In that case, this battle couldn\u2019t even be called a draw. Sighing, Shishigou took out a cigarette from his inside pocket as he decided to wait here until Saber returned.</p><p>A cigarette after a battle was normally reputed to taste good, but\u2014</p><p>\u201CNo good, this really tastes bad.\u201D</p><p>Grimacing, Shishigou savored the taste of the world\u2019s transience with his lungs.</p><hr><p>Fiore agreed to Archer\u2019s suggestion. It appeared that the other battle had also reached a stalemate.</p><p>\u2018Then, let\u2019s join up at the designated location. Our intention was reconnaissance from the start. There\u2019s no need to obsess over settling things here and now.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Understood. Thank you, Master.\u2019</p><p>By the time Saber managed to stand up, Archer had widened the distance between them sufficiently enough for him to escape.</p><p>\u201CAre you running away, Archer!?\u201D</p><p>Watching him move away, Saber shouted without hiding her anger.</p><p>\u201CYes, since, at this rate, I\u2019ll be defeated first. Let\u2019s consider this match as a draw due to mutual injuries.\u201D</p><p>After saying those final words, Archer smoothly disappeared into the darkness of a back alley. Even though it wasn\u2019t at the same level as Assassin\u2019s [Presence Concealment], it appeared that he possessed knowledge of techniques for making oneself disappear as well.</p><p>For an instant, Saber wavered over chasing after him\u2014right now, he couldn\u2019t use his bow. She was confident that she could definitely cut him down if she caught up with him. However, the issue was whether or not she\u2019d catch up to him. Additionally, she couldn\u2019t be certain that he wasn\u2019t hiding [something] like the throwing technique he had used earlier.</p><p>Of course he had humiliated her. So humiliated that even tearing him apart wouldn\u2019t satisfy her. But she endured it.</p><p>\u201C\u2026Now then, I wonder how Master is doing?\u201D</p><p>She wasn\u2019t that worried. Should her Master fall into a critical situation, Saber would immediately be informed through the Command Spells. If he was just about to fall into such a situation, he would probably call her back to him using a Command Spell.</p><p>After standing up and walking for ten minutes, she found Shishigou looking languid as he leaned against a historic building that had been magnificently destroyed.</p><p>\u201CSo Archer retreated, huh.\u201D</p><p>Shishigou had no conspicuous wounds that were worth mentioning. Some blood flowed from his face and abdomen, but they were probably just scratches.</p><p>\u201CPretty much.\u201D</p><p>\u201CSo our first battle was a draw. Saber, how did you find a battle between Servants?\u201D</p><p>Without replying, Saber merely looked up at the sky silently. Why was it that she found the cold blue moonlight so dazzling\u2014?</p><p>Shishigou smiled and nodded as if he understood.</p><p>\u201CIt appears we\u2019ve both tasted the thrill of the Holy Grail War to our hearts\u2019 content.\u201D</p><p>\u201CMuh. I didn\u2019t say anything.\u201D</p><p>\u201CI can tell that much from your face. Now then, assuming that Assassin has retreated, chasing after her would be difficult. She can\u2019t remain confined to Sighi\u0219oara forever either\u2026 Since Archer shot at her, it looks like she\u2019s not working with the Black camp, so there will probably be other chances to kill her.\u201D</p><p>Or she might be killed by another Servant as well. Most likely, a third party had killed the original Master and taken Assassin for themselves. Did they intend to conduct themselves skillfully and get their hands on the Holy Grail? Or\u2014based on these serial killings, maybe they weren\u2019t thinking of anything.</p><p>Shishigou hoped it was the former case. That would be fine then, since they were fighting with reasoning behind their actions. But, if they were completely unconcerned with everything and were killing just because they wanted to\u2014Assassin of Black and her Master would definitely become the most difficult enemies in the Great Holy Grail War.</p><p>However, just as Fiore had said, not just Trifas, but all of Romania should be under the control of Yggdmillennia. If not, the title of Second Owner would weep.</p><p>\u201CSo, we\u2019ll be going back to Trifas, Saber.\u201D</p><p>\u201CAye\u2026 But, how are we going to get back? The bus we took to get here won\u2019t be passing through anymore at this time.\u201D</p><p>\u201CWell, naturally\u2014we\u2019re going to borrow one of these.\u201D</p><p>Shishigou briskly walked out onto the main street, smashed the glass window of a parked car and unlocked its door. By the way, he had no intention of returning it, so he was basically stealing it.</p><p>\u201CCome on, get in.\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2026Please avoid us having to drop out from the Great Holy Grail War due to getting caught by the police, Master.\u201D</p><p>Saber sighed as if amazed by her Master\u2019s actions.</p><hr><p>When Assassin of Black, with her right arm hanging torn and limp, returned to the place she used as her dwelling, an hour had passed since she left.</p><p>\u201C\u2026It hurts.\u201D</p><p>With teary eyes, she showed her right hand to her Master, Rikudou Reika. Even the bone in her hand was visible in the cut cross-section, and her muscle fibers were torn to shreds. If she were a normal human, she wouldn\u2019t be able to use her hand ever again.</p><p>\u201COh my!\u201D</p><p>With a pale face, Reika frantically tried to search for a first-aid kit, but soon realized that there was no point. Assassin was a Servant who was not of this world. There was no point in applying medical treatment without magecraft. And as an ordinary human, Reika couldn\u2019t use magecraft.</p><p>She was helplessly limited to binding the wound with a clean handkerchief. There was nothing else she could do.</p><p>\u201CDoes it still hurt?\u201D</p><p>Reika asked that uneasily, but Assassin shook her head and smiled as if to tell her not to worry.</p><p>\u201CNo\u2026 it\u2019s fine now. More importantly, Mother, we\u2019re hungry.\u201D</p><p>\u201CAll right. Just wait a bit. I\u2019ll go reheat your hamburger right now.\u201D</p><p>Since Assassin couldn\u2019t use her right arm, Reika decided to cut up the reheated hamburger with a fork and feed Assassin piece by piece.</p><p>After pestering Reika for the hamburger, Assassin opened her mouth like a small bird. Seeming to have forgotten about her right hand, she smiled happily from the bottom of her heart.</p><p>\u201CDoes it taste good?\u201D</p><p>\u201CYeah!\u201D</p><p>Thank goodness, thought Reika with relief, but when her thoughts turned to Assassin\u2019s right hand, her expression turned dark.</p><p>\u201CThen, Jack. Just how did you get that injury?\u201D</p><p>\u201CAh, yeah. We fought a Servant.\u201D</p><p>\u201COh my\u2026 Servants are people like Jack, right?\u201D</p><p>Assassin nodded. Reika had learned about the Holy Grail War in her own way from Jack, and she was able to understand enough to know that the enemies she challenged were considerably strong.</p><p>\u201CDid you lose?\u201D</p><p>\u201CNo\u2026 Someone else barged in. They were really cowardly, attacking while we were in the middle of fighting.\u201D</p><p>\u201CYeah. Everyone is thinking of acting all sneaky and cunning because it\u2019s a war. That\u2019s not good, right?\u201D</p><p>\u201CRight~,\u201D repeated Assassin with a smile. Then, while continuing to feed her the hamburger, Reika asked a question.</p><p>\u201CHey, Jack. What should we do about that?\u201D</p><p>\u201COur right hand?\u201D</p><p>\u201CYeah. It\u2019s painful to see your pretty hand like that.\u201D</p><p>\u201CEhehe\u2026 yeah. A [meal] would probably be the best cure.\u201D</p><p>Assassin replied while smiling in embarrassment. Reika had a contract with Assassin, but she couldn\u2019t supply prana to her. So naturally, Assassin had to rely on [eating] to supply herself with prana.</p><p>\u201CYeah, so how about eating the heart of the last Mister Magus?\u201D</p><p>\u201CYeah, let\u2019s do that.\u201D</p><p>Reika took out a dark red heart wrapped in film on a white plate from the refrigerator. Unable to wait, Assassin plucked it out of the wrapping film and swallowed it in a single gulp.</p><p>The heart of a magus was far richer in prana than that of an ordinary human. Having replenished her depleted prana supply, Assassin felt herself become revitalized. Her town-up right hand was also already regenerating.</p><p>\u201CPhew. What a relief.\u201D</p><p>\u201CYeah\u2026 But we\u2019re out of hearts now. Mother, what should we do?\u201D</p><p>\u201CHmm, if we stay here, you might get attacked again. Also, the police have started to get noisy. Shall we try heading straight to Trifas next?\u201D</p><p>Assassin folded her arms and started to hum to herself in thought\u2026 Saber was a formidable enemy, but based on the nature of the Holy Grail War, there wouldn\u2019t be many Servants stronger than that one. Of course, if Saber used her Noble Phantasm, Assassin\u2019s defeat would probably be certain. But Assassin had another certain kill Noble Phantasm of her own, and she hadn\u2019t used it in this battle.</p><p>Saber would probably run at and scatter the other Servants with her strength, but there was no way she\u2019d be able to avoid using her Noble Phantasm at some point. If Assassin aimed for that moment\u2014she\u2019d be able to eat her.</p><p>\u201CHmm\u2026 yeah. Let\u2019s try going there.\u201D</p><p>\u201COkay. You\u2019re also tired, so let\u2019s leave after taking a nap. Okay, Jack?\u201D</p><p>\u201CYeah!\u201D</p><p>With light footsteps, Assassin jumped onto the bed, and then tore off the sheets. She rolled herself within them into a ball like a bagworm.</p><p>\u201COh my.\u201D</p><p>Smiling, Reika piled the dishes and brought them to the kitchen. They would be immediately departing when they got up, but it was proper manners to tidy up before they left.</p><p>Although, since the men who had lived in this house had been dissected after having their hearts gouged out a short time ago and were now buried underground, there would never again be an opportunity for those dishes to be used.</p><p>\u201CMother, hurry up!\u201D</p><p>Bunched up like a bagworm on top of the bed, Assassin kicked her legs about. While saying \u201CYes, yes\u201D with a wry smile, Reika quickly finished washing the dishes and headed over to the bed.</p><p>The instant Reika lay down on the bed after taking off her clothes, Assassin covered her with the sheets wrapped around herself. Smiling innocently, Assassin hugged Reika\u2019s naked body and buried her face in her abdomen.</p><p>\u201CM\u2014o\u2014th\u2014er.\u201D</p><p>She murmured in a somehow slow, frightened manner. Reika embraced her closely and patted her head to comfort her.</p><p>\u201CThere, there.\u201D</p><p>Assassin behaved like a spoiled child, but Reika didn\u2019t find that strange. She didn\u2019t know about the Holy Grail War, Masters and Servants. Servants were Heroic Spirits, elevated due to the belief of the people, and were always summoned in the form of their heyday.</p><p>So there were hardly any that were summoned as children. Assassin of Black\u2014Jack the Ripper wasn\u2019t like this because of a failure of the mind or soul, but was a genuine child.</p><p>\u2026In the first place, Jack wasn\u2019t a [human] when she was alive.</p><p>In 1888, there were tens of thousands of prostitutes in London. The abortion methods back then were too unskilled and rough, and the children who should have been born were treated like trash. Their corpses were discarded into the river that flowed through the East End district where the prostitutes lived, and their hatred and grudges accumulated in the stagnant river.</p><p>The grudges of the tens of thousands of children who were denied even the right to be born gradually started to take human form. Eventually, a very young girl who couldn\u2019t even be called a prostitute wandered the streets of East End without knowing why. Why she was born, why she was sad, why she was cold\u2014she didn\u2019t know anything. She didn\u2019t know, but she at least understood that she wanted something.</p><p>In such a state, she happened to meet a woman.</p><p>When she walked towards the woman and unconsciously called out [Mother], Jack was terribly abused. Getting abused was hard, painful and only left her sad. So she killed the woman.</p><p>Killing her was unexpectedly easy. The organs she took out of her after dismembering her were warm, as if they were a sign of love.</p><p>The next day, there was a huge ruckus when the woman\u2019s corpse was discovered.</p><p>She killed a second woman and then a third. And as she did so, she was given a name by the people.</p><p>Jack the Ripper\u2014It made her happy. Because she hadn\u2019t known her own name either until then.</p><p>When rumors went around saying that \u2018Jack must be a doctor based on his dissection technique\u2019, she was delighted. The people she hated the most in this world were doctors\u2014because they were the ones who kept killing children like her.</p><p>After killing several prostitutes, she then died. It wasn\u2019t due to any significant reason. A certain magus merely noticed that the bizarre murders were crimes done by a demonic being and promptly dealt with her.</p><p>After that, the murders stopped and Jack the Ripper disappeared into the darkness\u2026 But his murders were too bizarre, too incomprehensible, and too mysterious.</p><p>Born due to the fear that persisted even after her death, a serial killer Anti-Heroic Spirit\u2014that was who this girl was.</p><p>While Reika repeatedly sang a lullaby several times, Jack seemed to have completely fallen asleep. Seeing that, Rikudou Reika also felt relieved and closed her eyes.</p><p>Rikudou Reika had been offered as a sacrifice for a Servant summoning ritual by an Yggdmillennia magus, Sagara z Hyouma, but instead became a Master due to Assassin\u2019s betrayal of him. Until that time, she had simply lived by drifting through life aimlessly.</p><p>No, she might be doing so now as well. She might be just going with the flow of this unrealistic situation and vaguely seeking the Holy Grail. She wanted to be happy. That was the only reason she sought the Grail. But she should be able to find plenty of ways to accomplish that just by living. So why had she refused that simple life and purposefully agreed to take part in a war\u2026 and even kept killing people to use as nourishment?</p><p>\u201CIt\u2019s probably because I was bored.\u201D</p><p>What a horrible woman I am, she thought in self-mockery. But she had no intention to stop killing. Because it was absolutely necessary as food for the girl sleeping before her eyes. Because it was necessary in order to live.</p><p>To Reika, Jack was her own child. So she rejected every single ethical view. If it was for the sake of her child, a mother would gladly become the demon Hariti.</p><hr><p>Sieg was surprised at how unexpectedly light the girl he carried on his back was, but he was also surprised at her current state of dress. Having released her armor, she was now dressed in civilian clothes. As expected, it would be too suspicious for her to go into town wearing that battle outfit.</p><p>\u201C\u2026Ah, this is so embarrassing.\u201D</p><p>\u201CDon\u2019t worry about it. It can\u2019t be helped considering your circumstances.\u201D</p><p>Sieg said that as he vigorously stepped on the ground. If what she had confessed about being [summoned by possessing a human] was true, then it was understandable that she would collapse.</p><p>\u201CIn other words, you have the physical abilities of a Servant, but since you\u2019re linked to physical human body through the realm of the unconscious, you have to carry on your life as a human as well.\u201D</p><p>\u201CThat\u2019s how it is. Moreover, I seem to use up an excessive amount of calories while I act as a Servant.\u201D</p><p>\u201CThat\u2019s really inconvenient\u2026\u201D</p><p>Even if she covered her normal human body with a shell, what she did was still no different from overusing and abusing it. She was able to endure this unimaginable situation by coating different parts such as her nerves and muscle tissue, but she couldn\u2019t avoid the fervent consumption of calories that accompanied that method.</p><p>Of course, she wouldn\u2019t die from it. She wouldn\u2019t but\u2014</p><p>\u201CI didn\u2019t think an empty stomach would be this painful. Umm, I even thought I\u2019d be fine with munching on tree roots if it meant eating soon, but what should I do?\u201D</p><p>Her tone conveyed that she was quite serious. Sieg replied while speeding up his feet somewhat</p><p>\u201C\u2026Please endure it just a little longer.\u201D</p><p>I\u2019m not sure eating tree roots is such a good idea, Sieg thought, but Ruler merely feebly responded with \u201CYes\u2026\u201D to his words. At this rate, she would probably start munching on tree roots within less than thirty minutes if she had nothing else to eat.</p><p>Dawn had already come, and they started to see early rising villagers every here and there. Sieg rushed from the mountain to approach the nearest farmer and asked an old man whether there was a shop that supplied food in this village.</p><p>\u201CDid your friend collapse?\u201D</p><p>Seeming to take a break from his early morning manual labor, the man asked that in a worried tone while wiping the sweat from his neck with a towel.</p><p>\u201CNo, it seems she\u2019s unable to take even a single step due to an empty stomach.\u201D</p><p>\u201CThat\u2019s not good\u2026 I was thinking of eating breakfast right about now, but would you like to accompany me?\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2026Thank you. Then I\u2019ll accept your kindness without reserve.\u201D</p><p>Sieg had considered using suggestion magecraft if push came to shove, but since the conversation had gone unexpectedly well, he couldn\u2019t find the timing to do so at all. The old man immediately returned to his house, so Sieg also followed after him.</p><p>\u201CUu. What a nice smell\u2026\u201D</p><p>Having fainted earlier, Jeanne woke up. Sieg sat her down from his shoulder onto a chair in the dining room. The old man immediately placed a plate and spoon in front of her. It was a dish of thick reddish-brown porridge.</p><p>\u201CThis is\u2026\u201D</p><p>\u201CThis is real kasha made from buckwheat. Well, try eating it.\u201D</p><p>Seeming to gasp, Ruler scooped up some porridge with her spoon and brought it to her mouth. Immediately after, she seemed to quickly come back to life, and then ate up the porridge in the blink of an eye, requesting seconds with tears in her eyes.</p><p>Helplessly Sieg heled out some more from next to her, and she ate up that portion almost immediately as well.</p><p>\u201CYou\u2019re a big eater, aren\u2019t you?\u201D</p><p>\u201CY-Yes! No, err, that is\u2026 I\u2019m sorry.\u201D</p><p>With her stomach settled down, she seemed to put energy into thinking again. Her cheeks turned bright red, and she bowed her head deeply in apology.</p><p>\u201CNo, no, go ahead and eat more. You too, young man.\u201D</p><p>He held out another set of plates to Sieg and Ruler. While Sieg hesitated, Ruler decided to happily presume upon the old man\u2019s good will.</p><p>The old man said his name was Serge. He told them how he had been born in this village, raised his son here, seen the boy off when he left, and plowed his fields as he lived by making the most of the present. It was an ordinary life that did not particularly stand out.</p><p>\u201CIt\u2019s been a while since we\u2019ve seen any young people in this village.\u201D</p><p>When the old man treated them to coffee after the meal, the two of them gratefully accepted the drinks after sweetening them with large amounts of sugar and milk.</p><p>\u201CAren\u2019t you going to ask what we\u2019re doing out here?\u201D</p><p>In response to Ruler\u2019s question, Serge shook his head in a gentle manner.</p><p>\u201C\u2026Well. When two young people wander through a town in the middle of nowhere like this with only the clothes on their backs, it\u2019s not hard to figure out what\u2019s going on.\u201D</p><p>Sieg\u2019s body stiffened in shock.</p><p>\u201CWell, I think it can\u2019t be helped since you two are young. But you should properly prepare before you run away next time, okay?\u201D</p><p>It seems that Serge has seen through everything, Sieg thought. He glanced sideways at Ruler, but she looked at Sieg with a somehow embarrassed expression.</p><p>\u201CI understand, we\u2019ll make sure to do that next time.\u201D</p><p>\u201CHuh?\u201D</p><p>Ruler was strangely surprised by Sieg\u2019s reply, which he found curious.</p><p>\u201CSo, what will you do now?\u201D</p><p>\u201COf course, we\u2019ll go back\u2026 There are people waiting for me, after all.\u201D</p><p>Serge seemed a bit surprised by his answer. Shortly after, he nodded several times as if in understanding and sipped at his delicious coffee.</p><p>\u201C\u2026I see. Yeah, that\u2019s good. It really is important to get everyone\u2019s blessing.\u201D</p><p>\u201C?\u201D</p><p>Not understanding what he was talking about, Sieg glanced to his side, and for some reason, Ruler\u2019s eyes had started swimming. He didn\u2019t get it, but Sieg decided to focus on his coffee for now.</p><p>\u2026In the end, since Sieg was also exhausted, the two of them decided to rest at Serge\u2019s house until noon. Serge gladly lent them his son\u2019s room which hadn\u2019t been used since he left the village.</p><p>\u201CEven if we have permission, I wonder if this is all right\u2026\u201D</p><p>\u201CT-That\u2019s true. But I\u2019d feel bad about not willingly accepting his good will\u2026\u201D</p><p>It was a trivial conversation, but Sieg looked at Ruler quizzically. Sieg was a homunculus, and his communication experience was practically zero except for with Rider.</p><p>However, even so, he understood enough to know the appropriate distance between people when they spoke to one another. Ruler was consciously distancing herself from Sieg. The distance between them was about three meters. Rather, she was hiding herself behind the room\u2019s door and wouldn\u2019t come out from there.</p><p>\u201CWhy are you so far away?\u201D</p><p>\u201CAh, err. It seems that Laeticia inside me is bad with men, so I can\u2019t interact normally with you unless I maintain this distance\u2014\u201D</p><p>Ruler spoke apologetically\u2026 but she stayed hidden behind the door.</p><p>\u201CNo, but you didn\u2019t seem that on guard against me when we first met.\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2026It was at night. And I deemed it more important to see what kind of person you were since I didn\u2019t know you. Now that the situation has calmed down, the Laeticia inside me is coming out a bit more strongly.\u201D</p><p>\u201CThe possessed is affecting you the possessor?\u201D</p><p>\u201CYes\u2026. Though this is also a first experience for me. I\u2019m certainly conscious of myself as Ruler, Jeanne d\u2019Arc. However, at the same time, Laeticia\u2019s consciousness remains. In particular, she serves as the base for my knowledge that concerns matters outside of the Holy Grail War.\u201D</p><p>\u201CAren\u2019t there any inconveniences?\u201D</p><p>\u201CLike I said before, besides the necessity of eating and sleeping\u2026 Ah.\u201D</p><p>Ruler took out a book from the bag she carried. It seemed to be some kind of textbook on mathematics.</p><p>\u201CIt\u2019s somewhat inconvenient that I don\u2019t understand mathematics at all.\u201D</p><p>She lightly complained with a bitter smile.</p><p>\u201C\u2026Is high-level mathematics necessary for the Holy Grail War?\u201D</p><p>In response to Sieg\u2019s extremely natural question, Ruler entwined both her hands\u2019 fingers together and replied with a somewhat pouting expression.</p><p>\u201CNo, it\u2019s true that it\u2019s unrelated, but\u2026 I can\u2019t get the equation problems out of my head no matter what I do, and I can\u2019t quite seem to calm down about it\u2026\u201D</p><p>Indeed, one wouldn\u2019t be able to remain calm about that. If Sieg could be of even a little use, perhaps he should help.</p><p>\u201C\u2026Lend me the textbook for a little bit. I might be able to solve them.\u201D</p><p>\u201CEh, really!?\u201D</p><p>When Sieg nodded affirmatively, her expression sparkled brightly.</p><p>\u201CThen, err, I suppose I\u2019ll let you get closer.\u201D</p><p>After giving a single cough, Ruler approached Sieg with somewhat awkward footsteps. They sat down on chairs and faced each other with a small dining table between them.</p><p>\u201CP-Please go ahead.\u201D</p><p>Bowing her head, Ruler held out the textbook and a pencil. Sieg accepted them and opened the designated page. He read it silently for a while, and then filled in the answers into the black spaces in the textbook.</p><p>\u201CI think this is the correct answer.\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2026T-That was admirably well done.\u201D</p><p>After reading the answer, she bowed deeply. It\u2019s not such a big deal, Sieg thought. He had merely had that kind of knowledge since he was born.</p><p>\u201C\u2026\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2026\u201D</p><p>Silence suddenly fell between them. Sieg gazed at Ruler with his red eyes. She seemed uncomfortable with being stared at and nervously glanced around the room.</p><p>In the room Serge had furnished them with, there was a bed, a small table for two, and two sturdily-built chairs. There was nothing else besides a closet in the corner. Most likely, the son who had used this room had taken his personal effects with him when he left the village. But the room was still thoroughly cleaned.</p><p>\u201C\u2026He must really be treasured.\u201D</p><p>\u201CWho?\u201D</p><p>Sieg enquired about the words Ruler murmured to herself.</p><p>\u201CAh, I mean Serge\u2019s son.\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2026?\u201D</p><p>When Sieg tilted his head quizzically, Ruler realized the reason and cast her eyes down somewhat sadly. It\u2019s true that he was endowed with knowledge. He was both logical and intelligent. However, at the same time, there were many things he didn\u2019t understand as well. Rather than ignorant, perhaps it was better to call him pure and innocent.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t just because he was a homunculus. Having been made to serve as a prana supply, he probably lacked many things.</p><p>\u201CDo you understand? This room probably hasn\u2019t been used since his son left the village. That can be surmised from the fact that Serge-san lives alone and the meagreness of this room\u2019s furnishings.\u201D</p><p>\u201CHmm, that\u2019s logical.\u201D</p><p>\u201CSo, normally speaking, this room would be a good room even if it wasn\u2019t clean. No, rather, it wouldn\u2019t be a problem even if this room was covered in dust. And yet, this room has been completely wiped of dust. The one who cleans it can only be\u2014\u201D</p><p>\u201CSerge-dono.\u201D</p><p>It was a logical conclusion. He lived alone and didn\u2019t have the money to hire a maid.</p><p>\u201CIt\u2019s possible that he\u2019s a tidy person, but the first floor is a bit messy and disorderly. Though, of course, not to the point that it could be called unsanitary.\u201D</p><p>Certainly, just as Ruler said, the things he should normally tidy up, like his clothes and farming tools, were still lying scattered about, but it didn\u2019t seem like he didn\u2019t care about them at all either.</p><p>\u201CSo, we can surmise that keeping this room clean is more important to him than tidying up the first floor where he conducts the main part of his daily life. In other words, that can only be an act out of love.\u201D</p><p>Sieg thought it over for a while, and then refuted it with a shake of his head.</p><p>\u201C\u2026No, that\u2019s not the only possibility. It\u2019s also possible that the son is atrocious and has completely enslaved his father Serge-dono, making him do forced labor like cleaning his room every day even after he left\u2014\u201D</p><p>\u201CThat\u2019s impossible.\u201D</p><p>\u201CCertainly, the chances are extremely small, but\u2026\u201D</p><p>\u201CI said it\u2019s impossible.\u201D</p><p>Sieg couldn\u2019t help feeling somewhat unconvinced, but he obediently nodded. He was ignorant, and even if she was a Heroic Spirit, she was a human who bore knowledge of this era. Her logic was probably correct.</p><p>\u201C\u2026Hmph. Well, you are a newborn, Sieg-kun. So I suppose it can\u2019t be helped. But leaning about the subtleties of human relations\u2026 about the heart is also important. If there\u2019s anything you\u2019re unclear about, I\u2019ll teach you about it to the best of my abilities.\u201D</p><p>Ruler puffed up her chest proudly. I think this way of talking is referred to as \u2018acting like a senpai\u2019, Sieg remembered. But there was something that bothered him more than that.</p><p>\u201CHey, wait a minute.\u201D</p><p>\u201CYes, what is it, Sieg-kun?\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2026No, why are you adding [kun] to the end of my name?\u201D</p><p>\u201CBecause Sieg is younger than me, right? So I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any problem with using [kun]. Do you dislike it?\u201D</p><p>\u201CAh, I don\u2019t really\u2014dislike it, I think, but\u2026\u201D</p><p>I don\u2019t think I dislike it, but something seems wrong about it\u2026 Sieg wanted to say that, but since that \u2018something\u2019 was too vague for him to articulate, he couldn\u2019t raise any objections.</p><p>\u201CThen I\u2019ll call you Sieg-kun from now on. Please call me either Ruler or Jeanne as you like.</p><p>\u201CI get it, I get it already. Then, Ruler, I have a question, but\u2026 is it okay if I ask you?\u201D</p><p>\u201CYes, go ahead.\u201D</p><p>\u201CIn the first place, what is \u2018Ruler\u2019? You said it was the class that conducts the management of the Holy Grail War, but\u2026\u201D</p><p>Sieg had been furnished with knowledge about the Holy Grail War to a certain point. But besides knowing that that the crucial class known as [Ruler] existed, everything else about the class was unclear to him.</p><p>He decided that he should at least ask what Ruler\u2019s objective was and what she prioritized.</p><p>\u201C\u2026Yes, that\u2019s an understandable question. Basically, it\u2019s nearly impossible for a Ruler to be summoned in a normal Holy Grail War. There are two big cases where a Ruler like me is summoned. The first case is when a Ruler is summoned due to the Holy Grail War taking place in an extremely peculiar form and an unknown number of consequences would come about as a result. In other words, this refers to cases when the central pillar of the ritual, the Holy Grail, deems that the Servant Ruler, who is under no one\u2019s control, is needed in this ritual. Like now, with the Great Holy Grail War where seven Servants fight seven other Servants\u2014the largest-scale Holy Grail War in history. And the other case is where there is a possibility that distortions will appear in the world due to the effects of the Holy Grail War.\u201D</p><p>\u201CDistortions\u2026 in the world?\u201D</p><p>\u201CYes. In the current Holy Grail War, people who become Masters control Heroic Spirits as Servants and compete for the Holy Grail, but the majority of the people who become Masters are Magi who prioritize the concealment of magecraft and the war. So there are rarely situations that beckon mayhem into the world, and even when there are\u2014they are dealt with as simple disasters in most cases.\u201D</p><p>\u201CDisasters\u2026 huh.\u201D</p><p>\u201CYes. It\u2019s something that shouldn\u2019t happen, but it\u2019s also true that it can\u2019t be helped. Many Holy Grails are forgeries quite different from the real thing. However, their \u2018function\u2019 is another matter. There are more than a few that can function as an omnipotent, wish-granting device. That is something that mustn\u2019t spread through the world as public information.\u201D</p><p>\u201CI suppose that\u2019s true\u2026 The people who are able to have their wishes granted by the Grail aren\u2019t limited to saints.\u201D</p><p>Ruler nodded with a sad expression.</p><p>\u201COf course, I don\u2019t mind if the person isn\u2019t a saint and wishes to fulfill a personal desire. As long as it doesn\u2019t beckon the world\u2019s destruction, I would properly respect the wish. However, there are rare people who would plan to destroy the world itself. They might be magi, or some other kind of person\u2026 Ruler is summoned when that destruction could theoretically come about due to the Holy Grail War and is given the duty of protecting the framework of the Holy Grail War.\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2026When it could theoretically come about? Then, does that mean it\u2019s possible that there is someone planning to destroy the world in this Great Holy Grail War as well?\u201D</p><p>If that were true, it was a serious matter. After all, this time it wasn\u2019t a battle between seven Servants against one another, but a war between two sides with seven Servants each.</p><p>\u201CI wonder about that. It\u2019s true that several of my abilities as Ruler aren\u2019t functioning correctly. Whether that\u2019s due to an abnormal phenomenon in the Holy Grail War or something else completely, I still don\u2019t know\u2026 Also, even if someone is planning something, it could be either the Black camp or the Red camp. Or it could also be another force entirely. There are no precedents of an all-out battle between two sides of seven Servants each. Furthermore, the Holy Grail they are seeking this time is the Greater Grail of [Fuyuki], which served as the original basis for all subspecies Holy Grail Wars. It\u2019s a holy object, an artifact created by three magi. So I can\u2019t still definitely say what the cause for my summoning is.\u201D</p><p>However, compared to the Black camp who merely tried to bring Ruler to their side, the Red camp attempted to assassinate her with Lancer, the Servant who could boast of being the strongest among their camp. Based on the situation, the Red camp was exceedingly suspicious.</p><p>\u201C\u2026It\u2019s really a serious situation. I\u2019m grateful for you assisting me in spite of that.\u201D</p><p>\u201CFufu, it\u2019s fine. You were someone involved in this Great Holy Grail War from the moment you were born. I want to respect your will and determination. Also\u2014\u201D</p><p>There, Ruler\u2019s words awkwardly cut off. When Sieg tilted his head curiously at her, she shook her head softly.</p><p>\u201CI\u2019m sorry. I think it\u2019d be better if you didn\u2019t think anything of my words just now. For some reason, umm, the words I\u2019m expressing are very, like that, and that, and also that\u2026\u201D</p><p>\u201CI have no idea what you\u2019re trying to say.\u201D</p><p>\u201CUmm, it\u2019s just that I have no positive proof yet, so\u2026 please forget about it for now.\u201D</p><p>Sieg decided to agree to her request. In the first place, she was the only person besides Rider he could rely on now.</p><p>\u201CThere\u2019s no reason for me not to believe in a saint like you. I don\u2019t mind, you can talk to me about it when you have the positive proof you need.\u201D</p><p>After Sieg plainly declared that, she blushed and nodded.</p><p>\u201CI don\u2019t know whether I\u2019m embarrassed or happy to hear you say that. But I\u2019ll do my best.\u201D</p><p>Her voice was small, but there was definitely determination in it. A diamond-hard determination that couldn\u2019t be shaken by anything.</p><p>\u201CNow then, since we\u2019ve calmed down, there\u2019s a problem I\u2019d like to clear up.\u201D</p><p>\u201CAh, what a coincidence. I was thinking the same thing.\u201D</p><p>Sieg and Ruler both awkwardly looked at the bed. It was a single bed, and was very cramped. Sieg had gone through the entire morning without even a wink of sleep since his escape in the dead of night, and Laeticia\u2019s body was also near it limits.</p><p>But the bed was only big enough to properly fit one person to sleep on it. If both of them slept on it, they would be glued to each other like affectionate lovers. Of course, it seemed that Serge thought that they were lovers.</p><p>\u201CI\u2019ll sleep on the floor, so you\u2014\u201D</p><p>\u201CI don\u2019t mind sleeping on the floor, though.\u201D</p><p>\u201CB-But. Based on what you said, Sieg-kun, you haven\u2019t slept at all since last night, right?\u201D</p><p>\u201CThat\u2019s true. But perhaps thanks to this heart, I don\u2019t feel that tired.\u201D</p><p>\u201CThat\u2019s a lie. You look totally exhausted. I\u2019m a Heroic Spirit, so it\u2019s no problem for me.\u201D</p><p>\u201CNo, but you said just earlier that you have to eat and sleep. You should sleep on the bed for the sake of the girl whose body you\u2019re using as well.\u201D</p><p>\u201CGuh, it\u2019s unfair to bring up Laeticia as an excuse\u2014Then, how about we at least sleep together?\u201D</p><p>\u201CThe bed is narrow. We\u2019d be glued to each other. Laeticia hates men, right?\u201D</p><p>\u201CNo, it\u2019s fine. She may be inexperienced with men, but she\u2019s a girl that truly feels that it\u2019s bad to be heartless. She has no objections to sleeping together.\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2026Don\u2019t you feel embarrassed?\u201D</p><p>In response to those words, Ruler turned silent and averted her eyes while blushing.</p><p>\u201C\u2026I\u2019m fine.\u201D</p><p>Since she said she was fine, she was probably fine. Sieg finally agreed to it, and the two of them somehow managed to lay their bodies together on the narrow bed. It was cramped, but fatigue settled into them like a log, and they couldn\u2019t help feeling sleepy.</p><p>Ruler\u2019s face was right in front of Sieg\u2019s. She seemed to have reached her limit as her eyes started closing just by laying down. Sieg was also exhausted, and he had been on the verge of closing his eyes for this past while as well\u2026 but, the fear that nested in his chest stopped sleep from taking hold.</p><p>Was this entire reality a dream, where everything would return to the way it was before the instant he fell asleep\u2014and would he awaken in that prana supply tank? Here he had been given much compassion and fortunate blessings. Perhaps the world wasn\u2019t so kind, and instead\u2014</p><p>\u201CGood night, Sieg-kun.\u201D</p><p>His foolish thoughts were drowned out by that whisper and the smile like that of an affectionate mother in front of him. Yeah, this really did seem to be reality. If it were all a dream, that would mean she was a product of his imagination. But there was no way\u2014he could imagine such a smile.</p><p>\u201CGood night.\u201D</p><p>The instant he said that and closed his eyes, Sieg\u2019s consciousness cut off. Without even the chance to see a dream, he slept while feeling as if he were falling. Even so, he felt no fear in it.</p><p>\u2026When they next regained awareness, they found that they had both rolled off the bed onto the floor. Their heavy weariness had been reduced, but their joints hurt due to sleeping on the hard floor.</p><p>\u201C\u2026I guess it really was impossible.\u201D</p><p>\u201CYeah.\u201D</p><p>They smiled wryly at each other and stood up. After that, they told Serge they were leaving now, but he said \u201CWait a bit\u201D and carried over a mountain of luggage from the kitchen.</p><p>\u201CHere, here, put these on.\u201D</p><p>He handed them a bunch of preserved dried meat and bread. He even gave them a thermos of coffee, and Sieg accepted it all in bewilderment.</p><p>\u201CUmm, I\u2019m grateful for you giving us all this, but unfortunately, we don\u2019t have anything to repay you with.\u201D</p><p>\u201CI don\u2019t need any\u2026 But, I know. Make sure to protect the young lady there.</p><p>\u201CEh?\u201D</p><p>Sieg tilted his head with a puzzled expression, and the old man struck his shoulder vigorously while smiling.</p><p>\u201CYou have the ability to do that much.\u201D</p><p>\u201CA-All right! L-Let\u2019s get going now, Sieg-kun!\u201D</p><p>With questions marks still hovering over his head, Sieg was forced to start leaving as Ruler pushed his back. But there was one thing he had to ask Serge. He forcefully stopped his feet and turned around.</p><p>\u201CCan I ask you one thing?\u201D</p><p>\u201CWhat is it?\u201D</p><p>\u201CDo you love your son?\u201D</p><p>Serge blinked upon hearing that crazy question, but then his tanned and rugged face immediately made a satisfied smile and he answered it.</p><p>\u201COf course I do! He\u2019s my pride and joy. He\u2019s working hard right now in another country somewhere.\u201D</p><p>Even Sieg could understand that that smile was from the bottom of Serge\u2019s heart, praying for the well-being of his son who had left the nest and rejoicing at his success.</p><p>Ruler pulled at his sleeve and said \u201CDidn\u2019t I tell you?\u201D with a smile. Sieg nodded, and shouted \u201CThank you!\u201D to Serge.</p><p>\u201CGood luck to you both!\u201D</p><p>After waving their hands back at those words of farewell, the two of them returned to the mountain once more. Walking alongside Ruler who had completely regained her vitality, Sieg tilted his head in puzzlement again.</p><p>\u201CWhat did he mean by \u2018protect you\u2019, I wonder\u2026\u201D</p><p>\u201CSieg-kun, that was just a misunderstanding on his part. You shouldn\u2019t think about it too deeply.\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2026Yeah, I suppose you\u2019re right, but\u2026\u201D</p><p>When Sieg said that, Ruler strangely turned her face away from him as if sulking, confusing him even more.</p><p>In any case, Ruler and the member of her entourage returned to the mountain once more and headed towards the Fortress of Millennia. They would probably reach the forest by nighttime.</p><p>\u201C\u2026How should I convince the other homunculi?\u201D</p><p>When Sieg asked that as he wracked his brain for a solution, Ruler gently admonished him.</p><p>\u201CThat\u2019s something you must think about for yourself. However, you did hear cries for [help], right?\u201D</p><p>\u201CYeah, I\u2019m sure of it\u2026 The other homunculi should have heard those voices as well.\u201D</p><p>\u201CThen how about appealing to that? \u2014Don\u2019t worry, they will surely listen if you speak to them.\u201D</p><p>Her words had a mysterious persuasiveness. Just by hearing her say \u201CDon\u2019t worry\u201D, he felt as if the path to success was guaranteed.</p><p>\u201C\u2026Thank you. I\u2019ll do my best.\u201D</p><p>\u201CYes, I hope that your prayer will reach them.\u201D</p><p>But contrary to the boy\u2019s hopes, the two of them would end up witnessing something unexpected when they were halfway to the fortress.</p><p>And that \u2018something\u2019 was the [meaning] behind Jeanne d\u2019Arc\u2019s being summoned as Ruler.</p><hr><p>As if his mind was creaking, he saw a dream of battle.</p><p>That world was on the verge of death from the start. The malice of the rulers covered the land, and they greedily devoured the meat of the weak who were unable to even resist.</p><p>The weak could only despair. As they continued to be exploited, they eventually found a single thing to rely on\u2014words of salvation filled with love.</p><p>Beautiful words that couldn\u2019t be defeated by starvation, poverty or despair\u2026 But the rulers tried to take even that from them. It was no longer exploitation; it was murder.</p><p>So they rose up. Their fear of having their right to live taken away overcame their fear of dying in battle.</p><p>Among them was a young boy. No one knew whether his presence there was a coincidence or the will of God, but before anyone realized it, the boy was leading them.</p><p>Their battle should have no defeat. And no victory either.</p><p>Because by rising up, they were both losers and victors at the same time. Indeed, they had no fists to swing; all they had left was the power to rise up. However, the act of rising up itself was a necessary act. They rose up for the sake of what they believed in\u2014that in itself was important and what they wished for. The sacrifices would be kept to a minimum, and even if several people including themselves became sacrifices, the world wouldn\u2019t die, but would instead be reborn.</p><p>\u2026That was how it should have been.</p><p>Even God will occasionally exercise malice due to good will. The miraculous power granted to the boy by God brought the possibility of victory that should have been impossible.</p><p>Miracles are, after all, things that only happen rarely. A miracle is a phenomenon that occurs when the heavens, earth and all people mesh together, and even then it still requires that everything be left to the roll of the dice.</p><p>Unfortunately, the boy attained victory.</p><p>Everyone went wild and became excited over the victory. They clung to the boy, who had won a battle where victory should have been impossible, as a child of miracles. That foolish purity of theirs troubled the boy.</p><p>They shouldn\u2019t have won. Winning was not an option. He had been caught up in saving lives in the near future and averted his eyes from the bigger picture.</p><p>They may bite a cornered cat\u2014but after being bitten, the enraged cat would retaliate by slaughtering them. That was the truth of this world.</p><p>I was na\xEFve.</p><p>The cut-off heads of old people, the men chopped up like experimental animals, babies pierced by spears, girls violated in the pursuit of lust and then thrown away afterwards\u2014It was truly a place worthy of being called hell. And the countless lives gathered here were not taken away by the enemy, but by the boy. He was convinced of that\u2014and yet, that made it all the more impossible for the boy to yield and give up.</p><p>The boy, without once changing expression, accepted this result with a will of steel. He merely gazed at this scene of ruin. He revealed no resignation or sorrow and even overcame the pain of his dismembered arms.</p><p>He accepted that he had lost.</p><p>He accepted that he would die.</p><p>He accepted that the responsibility for all their deaths lay with him.</p><p>But the one thing he wouldn\u2019t accept\u2014was that everything would fall to ruins after this. He couldn\u2019t accept it. After having wasted so many lives, he absolutely could not accept that nothing would be gained as a result.</p><p>So, God. Give me another chance. Next time, I won\u2019t lose sight of the bigger picture. I will eliminate all obstacles, enemies and hardships in my way. Next time, I will obtain all the good in the world. A world where everyone is happy, everyone is good, and everyone is perfect. I will exterminate all evil and create a new, pure world.</p><p>\u2014He saw a happy dream of prayer that mesmerized his mind.</p><p>\u2026Shirou Kotomine awoke from a languid dream. Rather than a proper dream, he had simply dragged out faint yet nostalgic memories. He had intended to doze a bit, but it seemed he had fallen completely asleep.</p><p>\u201CSo you\u2019re awake, Master. Rider and Archer have returned.\u201D</p><p><img src="https://i2.lensdump.com/i/1mYhGH.webp" alt=""></p><p>Assassin of Red, Semiramis, seemed to have put his head on her lap and watched over him as he slept. It was an act truly unlike the queen.</p><p>\u201CGuh. Why am I on your lap?\u201D</p><p>He had no memory of doing that. He remembered lying down on the couch, but there should have been no one around then.</p><p>\u201CI am Assassin, after all.\u201D</p><p>She giggled in amusement. Shirou accepted with a troubled expression that laughter which had bewitched men and driven them crazy when she was alive.</p><p>\u201CWhat are we going to do if someone saw us like this\u2026?\u201D</p><p>\u201CDon\u2019t worry, no one saw. Hmph, I finally did something Servant-like on a whim, so what are you dissatisfied with?\u201D</p><p>Her expression suddenly became sulky.</p><p>\u201CIt\u2019s because it\u2019s embarrassing. But thank you.\u201D</p><p>While smiling bitterly, Shirou got up from his prone position. Assassin nodded in satisfaction.</p><p>\u201CWell said\u2026 Leaving that aside, it\u2019s time. Everyone has gathered. Though we\u2019ve lost Berserker.\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2026He\u2019s not a Servant for us to worry over having lost. But he will be a bit of a nuisance if he\u2019s turned against us as an enemy.\u201D</p><p>\u201CYes, the problem is his Noble Phantasm\u2014Crying Warmonger: Howl of the Wounded Beast.\u201D</p><p>They both sighed. They highly valued the unequaled strength of Berserker\u2019s Noble Phantasm in battle. But it was far too difficult to control. The only way to use it was to send him to the frontlines the instant battle started and leave him alone until he died.</p><p>Berserker\u2019s Crying Warmonger was a Noble Phantasm that converted all damage dealt to him into prana and then released it. Since its ability was used on himself instead of the enemy, this Noble Phantasm was tentatively categorized as an Anti-Unit type, but it had substantial potential for massive destruction equivalent to an Anti-Army type Noble Phantasm.</p><p>The problem was that its range was far too extensive. If it was mistakenly used, it would definitely invite the miserable result of bringing about greater casualties on his own side.</p><p>\u201CFortunately, we know of his Noble Phantasm\u2026 It\u2019s unclear to what extent he can invoke it, but any Servant will be able to sense him using it.\u201D</p><p>At that point, they would have no choice but to run away. No matter their dispositions, no Servant enjoyed fighting on top of a bomb, and there was no need to either.</p><p>\u201CEither way, it\u2019s fortunate for us that the other side no longer has their Saber. It\u2019s fine to think that the course of the Great Holy Grail War will be nearly decided through this next battle\u2026 It\u2019s best that there be no Servants who can block the attack of our Lancer.\u201D</p><p>As Assassin murmured that in satisfaction, Shirou frowned slightly and his expression darkened.</p><p>\u201CWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201D</p><p>\u201CYes, it\u2019s certainly just as you say, but\u2026\u201D</p><p>Shirou Kotomine was a priest despatched by the Church, and he also had the duty of being the overseer of this Great Holy Grail War. Therefore, he possessed the [spirit board] that was given to the overseer and could perfectly grasp the state of all fourteen Servants.</p><p>Incidentally, the Yggdmillennia camp had also obtained a [spirit board] through their connections. Thanks to the sub-species Holy Grail Wars, there were abundant means to purchase one.</p><p>\u201CI\u2019ve confirmed that Saber has died with the [spirit board], but it seems his Line hasn\u2019t been completely cut.\u201D</p><p>\u2014So Shirou declared. Assassin frowned and accepted his words.</p><p>\u201CHoh, so he\u2019s alive?\u201D</p><p>\u201CNo, it shows that he\u2019s dying. He\u2019s probably on the verge of death; at the very least, it should be impossible for him to fight\u2026 But the fact that he\u2019s remained in this state since last night is incomprehensible.\u201D</p><p>In addition, he had used familiars concealed inside the bodies of homunculi within the Fortress of Millennia to eavesdrop on the Yggdmillennia Masters lamenting terribly over having lost Saber.</p><p>\u201CThen is he simply hurt?\u201D</p><p>\u201CIt would be good if that were it, but\u2026 In any case, we\u2019ll send out Lancer again in the likely scenario that Saber is revived.\u201D</p><p>After returning from his battle with Saber of Black, Lancer unusually whispered with some slight emotion, \u201CI\u2019d like to fight with him again.\u201D Shirou had decided to respect his wish. In the first place, the only ones who could fight more than an even match against a formidable enemy like Saber were Lancer or Rider.</p><p>However, Rider seemed to be obsessed with facing Archer of Black.</p><p>But then, Saber of Black probably wasn\u2019t alive anymore, and even if he were alive, he would be unable to fight while on the verge of death like this, but\u2014</p><p>\u201CPlease don\u2019t tell Lancer about Saber of Black. It\u2019d be troubling if he went searching for Saber on the battlefield.\u201D</p><p>When they arrived at the throne room, Rider and Archer were relaxing as they pleased. Rider was lying down and looking up at the ceiling, while Archer was sitting on the floor and roasting an animal she seemed to have killed herself, eating the meat on a skewer.</p><p>\u201COh my, I apologize for making you both wait.\u201D</p><p>Assassin shrugged and sighed in exasperation at Shirou\u2019s apology.</p><p>\u201CWhat are you saying, Master? By the look of things, they were just self-indulgently passing time.\u201D</p><p>Rider and Archer turned their faces away with a \u201Chumph\u201D at nearly the same time. It seemed the two of them had no intention of paying respect to Assassin, Queen Semiramis.</p><p>\u201CWell, it\u2019s fine.\u201D</p><p>Nodding generously, she sat down on the throne. Shirou nestled up beside her as if he were her attendant.</p><p>\u201CWhere are Lancer and Caster?\u201D</p><p>Rider responded to the question while still lying down.</p><p>\u201CAh\u2026 Lancer was vacantly gazing outside earlier. Caster is secluding himself in his workshop.\u201D</p><p>\u201CShall I go call them?\u201D</p><p>\u201CHahaha, Master. If you go to summon them, won\u2019t it be like you\u2019re going around running errands? I\u2019ll call them using telepathic communication.\u201D</p><p>She lightly waved two fingers, and soon after the throne room\u2019s heavy doors opened.</p><p>\u201CLancer, I apologize for calling you here.\u201D</p><p>In response to those words, Lancer slowly shook his head. His face was white and deadpan like always. His expression didn\u2019t waver even a little, as if it were frozen in place.</p><p>\u201C\u2026I don\u2019t mind. Did you need something?\u201D</p><p>\u201CI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019ll explain after one more person arrives.\u201D</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014Five minutes later, the last person made his entrance, while receiving irritated looks from everyone in the room. Throwing open the door, he entered with his arms spread exaggeratedly wide and shouted loudly.</p><p>\u201COh, [For I have sworn thee fair, and thought thee bright]! [Who art as black as hell, as dark as night]!\u201D</p><p>Assassin sighed and asked a question.</p><p>\u201CIs that how you think of me?\u201D</p><p>The man she asked that\u2014Caster of Red, the monster of literature Shakespeare nodded.</p><p>\u201CWho else could I be describing, Queen of Assyria! \u2026No, no, sorry about that. I was in high spirits and it just came to me. I had the pleasure of writing for the first time in a while, you see. Ah, by the way, Father Shirou. Though it\u2019s a bit sudden, there\u2019s something I want.\u201D</p><p>\u201CHuh?\u201D</p><p>\u201CAccording to the knowledge I\u2019ve been given, there is a device that lets one type letters with just the strike of a key, is there not?\u201D</p><p>Shirou pondered for a short while, and then struck his fist against his hand in realization.</p><p>\u201C\u2026Ah, you mean a computer.\u201D</p><p>\u201CYes. Could you lend me the money to buy one?\u201D</p><p>\u201CHmm, I don\u2019t mind. I\u2019ll lend you the money the day after tomorrow.\u201D</p><p>Shakespeare nodded in satisfaction. Assassin and the others could only watch this in utter amazement.</p><p>\u201CCaster\u2026 you haven\u2019t forgotten about the Great Holy Grail War, right?\u201D</p><p>\u201COf course not, my dear queen. There can only be one reason for us to be called and gathered like this. For war, correct? Heroes will vie for supremacy and start to kill each other to the extremes of savagery, correct? I, Caster, shall do my best\u2014to watch it all attentively!\u201D</p><p>\u201CYou\u2019re not going to fight?\u201D</p><p>\u201CThat\u2019s right. The truth is that I\u2019m extraordinarily inept at fighting and magecraft. [But you, gods, will give us some faults to make us men].\u201D</p><p>Both Rider and Archer wanted to point out, \u201CYou\u2019re Caster, right?\u201D, but managed to control themselves. In truth, he was right; Shakespeare was a Heroic Spirit that did not commit acts of \u2018battle\u2019. His role was to record the Holy Grail War and spin the story of the hardships, despair, hope and violence of the Masters (protagonists) to accompany the tale. The narrator does not come to the front, but merely supports those who stand at the front.</p><p>\u2026If he had been summoned in a normal Holy Grail War, as long as his Master wasn\u2019t naturally gifted at close combat, he would have probably been destined to be defeated very early on in the war.</p><p>But fortunately for him, in a situation like the Great Holy Grail War, there was plenty of opportunity for him to play an active role. Thanks to the very unique [skill] he possessed.</p><p>\u201C\u2014In any case, everyone has gathered. Now that Saber of Black has fallen and our preparations are complete, the time for us to attack has come. A war with merely repeated skirmishes is not interesting, correct?\u201D</p><p>In response to Assassin\u2019s words, Rider and Archer grudgingly nodded. Certainly, it was just as she said. They tired of mere skirmishes.</p><p>\u201CThis war is a rare occasion. It should be conducted flashily, should it not?\u201D</p><p>Assassin smiled sweetly as she said that.</p><p>\u201C\u2014No, well, that\u2019s true. But aren\u2019t you the one who made the preparations to expressly make this castle and barricade ourselves within it?\u201D</p><p>Rider said that with an amazed expression, but Assassin chuckled and replied.</p><p>\u201CBarricade ourselves? Rider, the premise of your assumption is mistaken. My Noble Phantasm Hanging Gardens of Babylon: Aerial Gardens of Vanity doesn\u2019t exist in order to defend. It\u2019s a Noble Phantasm for attacking.\u201D</p><p>Rider and Archer both tilted their heads. Caster, who knew the details of this Noble Phantasm, smirked at their reactions, and Lancer remained unperturbed as always. Shirou, the only Master present here, smiled bitterly and chided Assassin.</p><p>\u201CAssassin, please show it to us directly without that superior air of yours.\u201D</p><p>\u201CVery well\u2026 Master, you are also comparatively excited about this, it seems.\u201D</p><p>\u201CI am a man, after all.\u201D</p><p>\u201CI see,\u201D Semiramis said in understanding, and then laid her hand on the huge jewel imbedded in the armrest of her throne. Instantly, the ground started shaking slightly.</p><p>The other Servants exchanged glances, wondering if it was an earthquake. The trembling gradually increased in in intensity\u2026 and then suddenly stopped.</p><p>\u201CFufu, go look outside.\u201D</p><p>Following her words, everyone except her left the throne room and rushed outside. The earthquake just now had clearly been intentionally caused by Assassin. But what on earth was the reason\u2014</p><p>\u201CWha\u2014!?\u201D</p><p>Both Rider and Archer became speechless. Caster made an overly moved expression of delight and Shirou, who normally kept his expression calm as much as possible, also had unusually shining eyes of excitement. Even Lancer widened his eyes a little as he gazed down.</p><p>They were standing on a floor of stone that served as a balcony\u2014and beneath it, there was just a wide expanse of empty air.</p><p>In other words, they were floating. Just as its name implied, this garden of vanity was hanging in midair\u2026!</p><p>\u201CYou\u2019re all surprised, correct? \u2026Well, its speed is nothing to praise, though.\u201D</p><p>There was a faint tone of pride in Assassin\u2019s words.</p><p>The Queen of Assyria, Semiramis. Her Noble Phantasm Hanging Gardens of Babylon was a flying fortress. However, it was impossible to manifest it through prana. First, materials consisting of stone and wood from a specific region must be gathered.</p><p>Once having gathered everything she needed, a long ritual needed to be held by Assassin herself, and then it would finally be complete as a Noble Phantasm\u2026 This process stemmed from the fact that, historically, Queen Semiramis did not create the Hanging Gardens in the first place.</p><p>In reality, she had never once seen the Hanging Gardens in her lifetime. However, she knew and instinctively sensed that it had been inscribed as part of her legend. This mystery was added to her legend after her death, but people\u2019s mental image of the Hanging Gardens being built by the world\u2019s most ancient assassin, the legendary queen, was very strong.</p><p>The Hanging Gardens first required materials. Materials that came from this world in the present day. Wood, stone, minerals, plants and water\u2014all from the land she once lived in.</p><p>After gathering and assembling everything together, the ritual she conducted turned the mere \u2018illusion\u2019 into reality. It was a counterfeit turned real, a Noble Phantasm that normally should be absolutely impossible to exist.</p><p>Therefore, it possessed the word [vanity] in its title. People who knew the truth could only feel a kind of scorn for it. Semiramis didn\u2019t build the Hanging Gardens, they would say. However, vanity was not a fragile thing. No, since the materials had been gathered and the Noble Phantasm had managed to be successfully constructed, at the very least, this vanity had been turned into the truth in this day and age.</p><p>And this former illusionary garden\u2014was far more absurd and ridiculous than the real one.</p><p>\u201CThen, let us prepare for battle, everyone. At this speed, we have about an hour until we\u2019re close enough that the ones barricaded in the Fortress of Millennia see us coming.\u201D</p><p>Everyone was silent. Of course, it wasn\u2019t that they were nervous. Due to having been given the concrete number of one hour till battle, a drunkenly high fighting spirit had simply gushed forth within them.</p><p>\u201CCaster. Are you finished with my sword I gave you earlier?\u201D</p><p>\u201CYes, it\u2019s right here.\u201D</p><p>Caster materialized the object from an astral state and respectfully presented it.</p><p>\u201C\u2026Hey, Shirou?\u201D</p><p>\u201CWhat are you going to use that sword for? I don\u2019t want to think so, but\u2014\u201D</p><p>Rider and Archer both wore suspicious expressions. Smiling, Shirou took the sword and pulled the blade from its scabbard. Though the basic shape was the same as a Japanese sword, it bore various aspects due to the soul of the swordsmith. If there were beautiful and lovely blades that possessed a shine worthy of being called works of art, there were also broadminded and deadly blades like the one Shirou held that specialized in cutting something.</p><p>Even from the perspective of Servants who were knowledgeable about every kind of weapon from every time and place, that blade was a great sword worthy of being called first-rate.</p><p>\u201CI will fight in Caster\u2019s place. Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019m quite knowledgeable when it comes to battle.\u201D</p><p>But it was far too simplistic to say that he could fight equally in this battle of Servants just because he had that weapon.</p><p>\u201CNo, no, no, no, no. I won\u2019t say anything bad, but wouldn\u2019t it be better for you to remain holed up here like a Master should?\u201D</p><p>\u201CRider is right, you know. It seems you have accumulated quite a bit of training, but you are still limited to the level of humans. If you come across an enemy Servant, it will be the end for you.\u201D</p><p>Rider and Archer frantically tried to stop him. That was only natural; a normal Master should never head out to the front lines. Servants did not merely aim for other Servants. If the enemy Masters were a rational person, they would have their Servants kill a Master who nonchalantly came onto the battlefield. If the Master died, the countdown to their Servant\u2019s death would begin. At the very least, it would be virtually impossible for them to fight at full power without their Master.</p><p>Moreover, this next battle would definitely be a great decisive battle in the war. It would be a large battle where not only Servants would clash against Servants, but their own pawn pieces, Dragon Tooth Warriors, would be mobilized as well.</p><p>For a mere human like him to endure in a situation like that\u2014. At that point, Caster came between Rider and Archer as if to hold their words back and spoke to them.</p><p>\u201CYou two. I once wrote this in the past. [The better part of valor is discretion]. And I have never seen anyone with as much discretion as Father Shirou here. Furthermore!\u201D</p><p>Acting as if in a play, he gathered everyone\u2019s attention on the blade Shirou held.</p><p>\u201CI have bestowed an enchantment of some note onto this blade. To be blunt, it is now equal to a C rank Noble Phantasm.\u201D</p><p>Including Assassin, everyone besides Shirou stiffened at that proclamation. He had definitely said \u2018Noble Phantasm\u2019. A certain-kill holy relic inscribed in legend, which each Servant possessed\u2014that was what a Noble Phantasm should be.</p><p>\u201C\u2014Huh?\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2026In other words, what? You created a Noble Phantasm?\u201D</p><p>\u201CYour special skill\u2026 is [Enchant], correct? Is it perhaps due to that skill\u2019s ability?\u201D</p><p>Caster answered \u201CPrecisely!\u201D to Assassin\u2019s question and puffed up his chest proudly.</p><p>Strictly speaking, what Caster of Red\u2014Shakespeare\u2014used was not formal magecraft. No matter what kind of Reinforcement magecraft was used, it shouldn\u2019t be possible to strengthen something to the level of a Noble Phantasm.</p><p>In the first place, he hadn\u2019t actually enchanted the blade with magecraft. While gazing at the blade he\u2019d been given, he had merely written down how the blade was magnificently sharp and how much blood it was stained in.</p><p>But if that writing was done by this world-famous literary master, it was a different story.</p><p>In this world, there existed Conceptual Armaments\u2014weapons that did not possess a physical power, but rather manifested an effect through a concept possessed by the item in question. Shakespeare\u2019s texts, which he poured his soul into, were sufficient to imbue a certain-kill concept into even a pebble on the roadside.</p><p>\u201C\u2026Can I ask one thing? Why don\u2019t you fight using that?\u201D</p><p>Lancer, who had remained silent until now, asked that to Caster. His question was only natural. If he could turn an ordinary sword into a Noble Phantasm, he should be able to fight with it.</p><p>\u201C\u2014I can\u2019t write about myself. That would just be an essay. Right now, I only have the ability to spin other people\u2019s tales and cannot write anything besides that.\u201D</p><p>Caster replied with a resolute tone. Lancer understood his words and spoke with a frown.</p><p>\u201CSo in other words, you find it troublesome.\u201D</p><p>\u201CWell, pretty much.\u201D</p><p>Lancer nodded in understanding.</p><p>\u201C\u2026Then it can\u2019t be helped. Your goal is to depict the stories of others instead of yourself. Regardless of whether the end of the story is ruin or tragedy, you must write it to the very end. Therefore, your goal is to survive till the very end. Fighting on the front lines is out of the question.\u201D</p><p>Hearing those chillingly cold words\u2014Caster smiled happily at being understood.</p><p>\u201CYes, that\u2019s precisely right! I want to witness the ending of this Great Holy Grail War! I must witness it! Whether it ends in fortune or misfortune, or even a despairing truth, watching everyone\u2019s story right till the end as a spectator is the duty that I have been charged with!\u201D</p><p>Those were words that were impossible for a Servant summoned in a Holy Grail War. He had declared that he would watch as a spectator right till the end.</p><p>Archer and Rider didn\u2019t know whether to be amazed or angry.</p><p>\u201CEither way, I basically have no battle power. So I wish to entrust the role of fighting to Father Shirou here, the one who possesses the greatest fighting power among our Masters.\u201D</p><p>\u201CI don\u2019t mind\u2026 With this blade, I won\u2019t fall behind on the battlefield.\u201D</p><p>It was just as Shirou said. At the very least, with a blade that equaled a C rank Noble Phantasm, he would have no trouble with the likes of homunculi or golems.</p><p>\u201CNo, no. My own power is trivial. It\u2019s just that your blade was an incredibly famous sword. If not, I would not have been able to make it a Noble Phantasm as high as C rank.\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2026It\u2019s because it was once the favored blade of a certain master swordsman.\u201D</p><p>Shirou muttered that. His expression loosened slightly, showing a mischievous smile.</p><p>\u201C\u2014It can\u2019t be helped. Master, I must control the flight of this garden, so I cannot directly go to the battlefield. I\u2019ll support you as much as possible, but don\u2019t get too deeply involved, okay?\u201D</p><p>\u201CI understand. I also understand my own abilities very well.\u201D</p><p>Even though he said that, Shirou had no intention of slacking at all in this war. He would fight using all his power and take the Greater Grail for himself using all his power. For the sake of that, he was willing to risk his life, and even if he had to commit deeds that were far from just and good, he would do so without any hesitation.</p><p>\u201CNow then. Though we may have our generals gathered, it\u2019s sloppy to have zero troops. Even if the enemy has gathered only a mish-mash of homunculi and golems, they will be somewhat troublesome for us.\u201D</p><p>It was just as Assassin said, they had no troops. Even if their Masters mobilized all their familiars, it would amount to less than ten of them. However, they had the Assyrian Queen Semiramis on their side. She could produce an inexhaustible supply of expendable pawns.</p><p>\u201CYou may use my Dragon Tooth Warriors at your own discretion. Would three thousand be enough?\u201D</p><p>Created using dragon teeth, Dragon Tooth Warriors were disposable rank-and-file troops\u2026 However, no matter how disposable they were, three thousand was just plain abnormal.</p><p>\u201CWell, there\u2019s no such thing as having too much in quantity, but\u2026 even so, Assassin, isn\u2019t making that many impossible?\u201D</p><p>\u201CNormally, it would be impossible. But as long as I\u2019m within these Hanging Gardens, nothing is impossible for me.\u201D</p><p>Assassin smiled in clear confidence at Rider\u2019s words. Yes, even if these Hanging Gardens traveled to another country, they were always treated as her personal field. All her stats were enhanced, and it even became possible for her to use magecraft that stepped into the realms of sorcery.</p><p>Of course, it came with a price. After all, this Noble Phantasm was almost foul play. Assassin of Red was rendered nearly powerless should she leave these gardens. But these gardens were a moving stronghold. It was unlikely that she would ever choose to leave these gardens in the first place.</p><p>\u201CThen who shall cut through the enemy vanguard?\u201D</p><p>At Shirou\u2019s question, Archer, Rider and Lancer exchanged glances. Caster, who had no intention of participating, acted as if it had nothing to do with him.</p><p>Lancer silently shook his head. It seemed he was saying, \u2018You can go first\u2019. Thus, Archer and Rider started glaring at each other. It seemed it couldn\u2019t be helped that they both wanted to cut through the vanguard. Assassin shrugged as if amazed at their behavior, and Caster said, \u201CI\u2019ll dedicate a poem to the one who cuts through the vanguard\u201D, pouring fuel on the fire.</p><p>\u201C\u2026Could you both please discuss it peacefully?\u201D</p><p>Though it probably wasn\u2019t because they obeyed those words, in the end, the two of them agreed to a compromise.</p><p>\u201CI\u2019ll cut through the vanguard.\u201D</p><p>It seemed they decided that Rider would be their vanguard. However, Archer summoned her own weapon, a bow, and hoisted it in the air.</p><p>\u201CBut I\u2019ll shoot the pre-emptive strike. I intended to use my Noble Phantasm from the beginning, after all.\u201D</p><p>\u201CUnderstood. Then let\u2019s do that.\u201D</p><p>\u201CSo this is the first time you two will be working together as a group. Shall I write a love poem, then?\u201D</p><p>Rider\u2019s eyes sparkled with joy at Caster\u2019s suggestion and he responded in agreement.</p><p>\u201CYeah, please do.\u201D</p><p>And Archer scowled unpleasantly.</p><p>\u201CNo, I\u2019d prefer if you didn\u2019t.\u201D</p><p>Caster decided to put together both their requests and make a heartrending poem about a man with unrequited love.</p><p>Watching the exchange with a bitter smile, Shirou turned his gaze towards the Fortress of Millennia, which was starting to become visible far off in the darkness of the night.</p><p>\u2014His heart was beating noticeably fast.</p><p>Yeah, he could tell. He could definitely tell. It was definitely there. The thing he\u2019d sought, sought and sought for so long was in that fortress.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t stop trembling in exaltation, and he desperately held back the corners of his mouth as they tried to loosen into a wild smile.</p><p>\u201C\u2014Even a man like you cannot hide your excitement when what you want is right before your eyes. You\u2019re still a child in that regard.\u201D</p><p>His trembling and smile ceased at the same time. Shirou silently turned his gaze to Assassin next to him with a slightly pouting look.</p><p>\u201CNo, it\u2019s fine as long as you can hold yourself back from jumping in excitement. More importantly, Master, if you should die, I will die, and if I die, all of our plans will come to nothing. You understand that, right?\u201D</p><p>\u201CYes, of course.\u201D</p><p>Her Master calmly replied, making Assassin openly sigh.</p><p>\u201C\u2014Despite that, you intend to go out onto the battlefield. I can\u2019t understand it. Right now, you are a Master who supports a Servant. Normally speaking, you\u2019re in a position where you definitely should not step onto the battlefield. So why are you risking your life by heading to battle?\u201D</p><p>Precisely because Assassin was his Servant, she well understood Shirou Kotomine\u2019s true power. He wouldn\u2019t fall behind the likes of homunculi or golems\u2014though it was unknown how he would do if he fought a Servant.</p><p>In any case, there was no problem as long he was careful. There was no problem, but\u2026 there was still that one-in-a-million chance of something going wrong. Assassin had absolutely wanted to refuse Shirou from heading out onto the battlefield. But no matter how many times she explained her reasoning, he had stubbornly refused to listen.</p><p>Assassin had no interest in his motives and thought he might take back his previous words if push came to shove. But seeing his determination not falter even at the last moment, she couldn\u2019t help but want to ask why he must behave so recklessly.</p><p>Shirou hesitated slightly, but as if resigning himself, he answered in a quiet voice.</p><p>\u201CIf my plan is something that goes against God, then I will definitely be struck down on this battlefield. I might have the misfortune of fighting a Servant and dying, or I might let my guard down and be killed by homunculi or golems. I might even get caught up in the blast of an ally\u2019s Noble Phantasm.\u201D</p><p>People die. And even Servants die. Things like good people getting caught up in something unreasonable and meeting a tragic end were everyday occurrences.</p><p>If he wasn\u2019t in the right, then he would definitely meet his end like that.</p><p>\u201CIf that happens, I will solemnly accept my death. God couldn\u2019t forgive me. That is something that I can\u2019t do anything about. But if\u2014if everything goes well.\u201D</p><p>Assassin was overawed. It wasn\u2019t really because Shirou did anything; he merely stopped his usual smile and directly faced Assassin.</p><p>There was no ominousness, madness, rage or hatred to be found in his eyes. Rather, they were calm like a still lake. So much so that one wouldn\u2019t think he was someone about to head to battle\u2014he was absolutely calm.</p><p>\u201CThen that means God approves of my deeds. That my wish for the Greater Grail, to love\u2026 and heal all humans is just. If I can be certain of that, I will no longer waver. I will know that there is indeed worth in betraying even what should never be betrayed.\u201D</p><p>Shirou spoke in a resolute tone. He was heading to the battlefield in order to confirm whether or not his objective was correct. To Assassin, it was nothing more than a reckless and foolish act.</p><p>But\u2014most likely, this was something Shirou had to do. An extraordinary obsession of his that other people couldn\u2019t understand. It was a ritual that was necessary for him to perform no matter what, in order to solidify his resolution without any doubts.</p><p>\u201C\u2014Hmph, honestly speaking, I can\u2019t understand it at all.\u201D</p><p>\u201CI suppose not.\u201D</p><p>Shirou smiled bitterly. She was right. Other people probably couldn\u2019t understand the idea of heading to the battlefield where death was rampant everywhere in order to decide whether you were in the right or not.</p><p>Just when he thought she would oppose his decision, though, Assassin declared in a manner as if ordering a retainer.</p><p>\u201CHowever, if you don\u2019t do this, you won\u2019t be able to move forward. Then it can\u2019t be helped. I\u2019ll allow it. Fight as you wish, but make sure you survive.\u201D</p><p>\u201CThank you,\u201D Shirou said in gratitude. Immediately after, the Hanging Gardens gently came to a halt. The Fortress of Millennia was just ahead. Between the Hanging Gardens and the fortress was a forest that spread out to both sides and a grass-covered plain in the middle of it.</p><p>In other words, this was their battlefield. The Red Servants and the Master Shirou Kotomine gathered at the prow of the Hanging Gardens.</p><p>\u201CThe other side is probably all frantic right about now.\u201D</p><p>Archer nodded at Caster\u2019s words. Her vision, which she had trained well as a bowman, could see to some extent the state of the fortress despite being several kilometers away and wrapped in the night\u2019s darkness.</p><p>\u201CYes, no Servants have yet been sent out to intercept us. They all seem to be in a panic at our sudden appearance\u2026 They\u2019re giving off that kind of presence.\u201D</p><p>Perhaps due to her animal instincts, Archer seemed to be able to perceive even the presence of the humans inside the fortress.</p><p>\u201CThen let\u2019s use this time to line up our \u2018rank-and-file soldiers\u2019.\u201D</p><p>Assassin waved her hand, and a giant pot that looked to be about three meters in diameter appeared floating in midair. The giant pot floated over the edge of the gardens where Assassin and the others stood, and then turned over.</p><p>At once, slightly yellowed bone fragment poured out from it to the ground below like rain. They buried into the ground and then grew out like plants, and eventually skeletal warriors with lizard like jaws were created one by one.</p><p>\u201C\u2026They look fragile\u201D</p><p>Archer murmured while looking down at them.</p><p>\u201CYes, that\u2019s right. They\u2019re fragile, extremely fragile. But they\u2019re great in numbers. Though they\u2019re no match for Servants, they\u2019re sufficient for fighting homunculi, and if their Caster is a small fry like our Caster, then they might be able to kill him.\u201D</p><p>\u201CHahaha, how harsh. But not all the Casters in the world are superb writers like me!\u201D</p><p>Caster calmly said that in retort. Assassin decided not to say anything else to him.</p><p>\u201C\u2026Hmm, the members of the Black camp have finally come out.\u201D</p><p>No other besides Archer could yet see the members of the other side through the thick darkness. It appeared that the Yggdmillennia clan and their Servants were finally starting to act.</p><p>It was going to be completely different from the skirmishes until now. Now there was a battlefield, soldiers, weapons, commanders, a territory that needed to be captured, and most of all, a [king] that needed to be slain.</p><p>There was just a short time left until the decisive battle with the goal of complete annihilation of the other side began. The Red Servants patiently waited for the moment it started\u2014</p><hr><p>The Yggdmillennia had predicted that the Masters of the Association of Magi\u2026 in other words, the Red camp would attack them and had prepared plans to counterattack from all directions.</p><p>They might suddenly launch an attack from the city of Trifas, or they might attack from the east with a large army. The possibility that they might launch a surprise attack from the sky wasn\u2019t low either. But\u2014</p><p>\u201C\u2026For them to attack with their own fortress is truly beyond expectations.\u201D</p><p>Archer of Black\u2014Chiron sighed. His gaze was locked on Assassin\u2019s prided Noble Phantasm, the Hanging Gardens of Babylon, as it floated in the air far above.</p><p>\u201CArcher, what is that thing\u2019s current status?\u201D</p><p>Fiore asked that in a thin voice from next to him. Archer could perceive a slight tremble in her voice, but that was only because he was a Servant. A normal human would not have sensed even the smallest tremble in her voice. Archer smiled at his Master as she tried to remain as calm as she could.</p><p>\u201CIt has come to a standstill in midair\u2026 This is just conjecture on my part, but it appears that the Erythros camp intends to use these grassland plains as their battlefield.</p><p>\u201CSo it\u2019s going to be an all-out battle.\u201D</p><p>\u201CYes. You and the other Masters should head somewhere safe. The other side likely intends to encamp themselves with their Servants and familiars.\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2014So it seems. They appear to have summoned Dragon Tooth Warriors. Probably in order to face our homunculi and soldiers.\u201D</p><p>Darnic landed on the castle rampart with a soft tap. He seemed to have boldly gone around looking at that floating fortress.</p><p>\u201CGrandfather\u2026\u201D</p><p>\u201CLet\u2019s head inside, Fiore. We have no choice but to leave the battle to them now.\u201D</p><p>\u201CPrecisely, Darnic. What follows from here is the domain of us Servants.\u201D</p><p>Particles of light resolved and gathered together, regaining human form. Lancer of Black\u2014Vlad III wore a savage smile as he gazed at the floating fortress.</p><p>No, it wasn\u2019t just Lancer. Berserker of Black, Frankenstein, and Caster of Black, Avicebron, also stood on the ramparts, glaring at the floating fortress.</p><p>\u201COn top of intruding into my territory in that kind of ugly thing, they\u2019ve scattered filthy skeleton warriors everywhere.\u201D</p><p>Lancer openly laid bare his displeasure. The moment they trespassed on his territory, they were enemies, conquerors, Ottoman Turks. A strong sense of duty that obligated him to massacre them all bound his entire body.</p><p>\u201CMy lord. We will take refuge inside the castle. But if those grassland plains become the battlefield, we will fight with our backs to the town. So you may wield your power to your heart\u2019s content.\u201D</p><p>Darnic respectfully bowed, and Lancer nodded placidly.</p><p>\u201CIndeed. Also, release Rider and Berserker of Red. We\u2019ll have them added to our forces as well.\u201D</p><p>\u201CIs that all right? Leaving aside Berserker, Rider is\u2014\u201D</p><p>\u201CI don\u2019t mind. They\u2019ve come this far seeking an all-out showdown. It is only good manners to throw out all our forces as well.\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2026Understood. I\u2019ll go release them right away.\u201D</p><p>Darnic disappeared from sight. Fiore also followed after him and retreated into the castle.</p><p>\u201CArcher. Take command of the organized formations of homunculi along with Rider.\u201D</p><p>\u201CUnderstood, Lancer. However, should Rider of Red take the field, I will have to go in order to stop him\u2026\u201D</p><p>\u201CI don\u2019t mind. It\u2019s fine as long as you take command at the beginning. The battle will eventually become chaotic anyhow, and the homunculi will merely be expended along with the golems.\u201D</p><p>Archer nodded. Lancer was correct. Once the opening strike of the battle ended, the situation would immediately turn into a battle between Servants.</p><p>\u201CAs for you, Caster, remain on standby here. I\u2019ll leave the timing to release Berserker of Red\u2019s shackles to your judgement.\u201D</p><p>\u201CUnderstood. Ah, that\u2019s right. Lancer, there is no way you can go to battle on foot. I\u2019ve prepared a horse for you.\u201D</p><p>At those words, Lancer looked at Caster with great interest in his gaze.</p><p>\u201COf course, it\u2019s an artificial imitation, but\u2014\u201D</p><p>\u201CThat\u2019s quite satisfactory. An ordinary horse could never accompany me in this war.\u201D</p><p>What Caster brought out was, naturally, a giant golem horse of metal. It was made of a combination of iron and bronze with an uneven design. Its eyes consisted of a red ruby and blue sapphire, which each carried a bewitching shine.</p><p>\u201CQuite satisfactory.\u201D</p><p>Smiling in satisfaction, Lancer climbed onto the horse. The horse didn\u2019t even whinny and obediently stood upright.</p><p>\u201CHuh, Lancer\u2019s riding on a horse? My position\u2019s been taken!\u201D</p><p>That somewhat loud voice made the atmosphere turn tense. It belonged to the Servant who had just been released, Rider of Black\u2014Astolfo. He wore a carefree smile on his face and greeted Lancer, who had ordered him to be imprisoned, with an unconcerned attitude.</p><p>\u201CRider. I won\u2019t ask if you\u2019ve reflected on your actions at this point. Now is the time for you to show your power to me. Your power as one of the Charlemagne\u2019s Twelve Paladins.\u201D</p><p>Rider reassuringly struck his chest.</p><p>\u201CYeah, leave it to me! That is that, and this is this. Fighting in this war is my mission, after all!\u201D</p><p>\u201CIf you\u2019re aware of that, then there\u2019s no problem. Rider, join with Archer in commanding the homunculi.\u201D</p><p>\u201CRoger!\u201D</p><p>Lastly, Lancer turned his eyes to Berserker, who was still glaring at the floating fortress.</p><p>\u201CBerserker. You are free to do as you wish. Fight and wreak havoc until you\u2019re exhausted.\u201D</p><p>\u201CUu\u2026 uuuuui\u2026\u201D</p><p>Berserker gave a single, light nod. She had both her hands on the castle rampart, appearing ready to jump over them even now.</p><p>\u201C\u2014Now then, everyone. Saber has vanished, and Assassin is not on our side. In return, we managed to get a hold of Berserker of Red, but he is merely a disposable [weapon]. In other words, we are the entirety of our battle power.\u201D</p><p>\u201COn the other hand, the other side most likely has all six of their Servants excluding Berserker. Lancer of Red fought evenly with Saber, and Rider of Red did not receive a single wound from Saber\u2019s attacks. Caster and Assassin, who have yet to be seen, are undoubtedly fearsome enemies as well.\u201D</p><p>Those were words that acknowledged the disadvantage of their side. They were inferior in pure numbers, and while the enemy\u2019s overall quality was unknown, at the very least, they no longer had Saber, so it would be a hard battle.</p><p>Yes, they were overwhelmingly outmatched\u2014if this was a normal battle, the difference between their forces was sufficient to guarantee that they would be defeated first.</p><p>\u201CNow then. I have a question for you all. Do any of you intend to accept defeat?\u201D</p><p>Everyone present rejected that notion with their words and actions.</p><p>The difference in battle power was overwhelming, and the chances of their defeat were high\u2014in the face of that truth, Lancer and the other Servants didn\u2019t act agitated at all. Heroic Spirits were such beings. Against an overwhelming disadvantage and a despairing situation, they would laugh and overturn such things. That was what made them worthy of being called heroes.</p><p>\u201CYes, exactly right. We will win! As if anyone who falls before this degree of difference in battle power, this degree of despair could call themselves heroes!\u201D</p><p>His words were correct. After all, Lancer\u2019s true name was Vlad III, the great hero who had protected his country over and over again from the soldiers of the approaching Ottoman Turks.</p><p>What was definite was the fact that, in 1462, the Ottoman Turks invaded. Against the Turks\u2019 forces of one hundred and fifty thousand, the Wallachian army that Vlad III commanded consisted of only ten thousand. However, he had exhausted the Turks with thorough guerilla warfare and scorched-earth tactics, and then evacuated the citizens in order to empty the country\u2019s capital and ambush the enemy.</p><p>The one who had commanded the Turks was Mehmed II, the Ottoman sultan known as \u2018the Conqueror\u2019 who had felled Constantinople with its threefold defensive walls. Even he, widely known for his bravery, paled when he arrived at the capital of Bucharest.</p><p>Countless stakes stood surrounding the citadel. Impaled upon them were his comrades, subordinates, and commanders\u2014twenty thousand members of the Turk army. The instant he saw them, anything like hatred for his comrades being killed was blown away. He was terrified. Someone who could not only think of such a thing, but put it into practice was terrifying. The plunder, violations, and atrocities his own army had committed were merely the result of having their lusts and desires accelerated in the heat of the moment. This was different, committed under a completely different way of thinking.</p><p>This was truly a method of warfare that didn\u2019t treat people as human beings. After all, his men had been skewered merely for the sake of display\u2026!</p><p>The morale of his army having plummeted to nearly zero, Mehmed II had no choice but to withdraw and return home. At that time, Mehmed II muttered this.</p><p>\u2014I fear no human being. But Dracul alone is a separate matter.</p><p>\u201CThose are savages. Fools who dirty my dominion and laugh crudely in arrogance can only die. Kill them while laughing. We must thoroughly re-educate those who lack the knowledge of fear with an ox-hide whip.\u201D</p><p>Lancer\u2019s words were extreme, but were in fact easy to understand.</p><p>Don\u2019t let the enemy go home alive. What he wanted to say was simply that. And that was exactly as the other Servants wished as well.</p><p>\u201CThen, I\u2019ll lead the vanguard.\u201D</p><p>Lancer grasped the reins of his horse and jumped off from the castle ramparts along with his steed. The height of the cliff that rose up beneath the ramparts was over a hundred meters, but the metal horse that Caster of Black had created wouldn\u2019t be damaged by something of that degree.</p><p>Like a lone general with but a single army\u2014Lancer rode his horse towards the enemy formation. The grassland plains were tranquil, but they would probably be transformed into scorched earth by the time this battle ended.</p><p>Resurrected into the present day with new subordinates, the stern king once more challenged the enemy in a disadvantageous battle. But that was how it always was for him, so there was nothing for him to fear.</p><p>Eventually, the homunculi commanded by two Servants and the golems massed together into troops. Archer and Rider\u2019s commands were splendid, and in a flash they were all arranged into orderly formation.</p><p>At the flank of the troops was Caster, who had brought along the still-sealed Berserker of Red. The plan was for him to choose the timing to release Berserker at his own discretion. Berserker\u2019s mind was completely ruined, but he retained just enough reason to distinguish enemies from allies.</p><p>Now that he had changed Masters, his enemy was the Red camp. And standing alone far away from the homunculi and golems was the mad warrior with reason\u2014Berserker of Black.</p><p>The ones who could truly be counted as part of their battle power were the ten golems who had been selected for being especially excellent even among Caster\u2019s creations and all the other Servants besides Caster.</p><p>Caster thought from behind his mask\u2014the situation couldn\u2019t be called that disadvantageous for them. Archer\u2019s strength and discernment were both excellent, and now that Caster had obtained a [core], his own Noble Phantasm was already capable of being activated.</p><p>However, there was but one decisive reason for being confident of their chances of victory.</p><p>Because Lancer of Black was Vlad III. Here in Romania, and moreover in Transylvania, his fame was nearly at its max. The boost in power due to fame was not that great, but here Vlad III\u2019s fame was on the level of devoted piety.</p><p>Yes, he was a great hero who had saved his homeland. And he was a terrifying being. The tragic man who, despite being the cornerstone of this nation, was betrayed and lost everything\u2014this county\u2019s king who was known by everyone from children to the elderly.</p><p>His current form was exceedingly close to that of his heyday. Furthermore, due to his skill [Demonic Defender of the State], the entire surrounding region including these grassland plains had been turned into his personal \u2018dominion\u2019.</p><p>Indeed, Rider of Red\u2019s true identity, which they had all heard from Archer of Black yesterday, was certainly shocking and devastating. He was a Servant who boasted of worldwide-class fame and was as top rank as a Heroic Spirit could conceivably be.</p><p>But even so. Even so, Vlad III still had some degree of advantage over him.</p><p>The two armies advanced towards each other little by little. As Lancer wondered what Servants the opposing side had, he saw only Dragon Tooth Warriors at the front of their forces.</p><p>Puzzled and suspicious, Lancer halted his forces. At the same time, the Dragon Tooth Warriors also stopped moving.</p><p>Knowing that trying to talk to the Dragon Tooth Warriors was pointless, Lancer turned his gaze to the floating fortress above.</p><p>\u201C\u2014Hmm. What are they planning?\u201D</p><p>She couldn\u2019t have heard his mutter, but as if in reply\u2014Archer of Red\u2019s bow fired the first shot.</p><hr><p>Archer of Red\u2014Atalanta\u2014nocked two arrows on her favorite bow, Tauropolos. She aimed not at the ground far below, but at the night sky which shined in the faint moonlight.</p><p>A chilly and dry late-autumn wind shook her hair, and her animal ears twitched.</p><p>It was time.</p><p>\u201CWith my bow and arrows, I respectfully ask for the divine protection of the sun god Apollo and the moon goddess Artemis.\u201D</p><p>The arrows started to shine bewitchingly. Her Noble Phantasm wasn\u2019t her bow, nor the arrows shot by her bow. Those were both merely the catalysts for it. Her Noble Phantasm was the technique itself of nocking and shooting arrows with her bow.</p><p>\u201CI offer thee this calamity\u2014Phoebus Catastrophe: Complaint Message on the Arrow!\u201D</p><p>The two arrows she shot towards the sky pierced through the clouds and disappeared from sight, leaving a glittering trail behind them. This was the starting signal to begin fighting, the first shot.</p><p>\u2026Those arrows were a complaint to the gods. The sun god Apollo and the moon goddess Artemis. They were gods deeply connected to the sun and moon respectively. Apollo was the god of the bow and arrow, and Artemis was the goddess of the hunt.</p><p>In compensation for Archer requesting divine protection from them, they sought a calamity. In other words, their divine protection equated to\u2014a calamity for the enemy.</p><p>A faint light filled the night sky, along with a quiet sound like falling rain. But it wasn\u2019t something as simple as a blessed rain. The malevolent gods sought a sacrifice, and scattered a torrential rain under the name of catastrophe.</p><p>Arrows of light rained down incessantly from the sky and homunculi were pierced and killed by the arrows one after another. Even the strong and sturdy golems had their bodies smashed apart one after another by the countless arrows. The Black Servant naturally evaded, blocked and repelled the arrows, but their battle line still fell into disorder.</p><p>Watching that dreary scene with an extremely cool expression, Archer of Red looked over her shoulder and spoke.</p><p>\u201C\u2014With this, the opening move is over. Time to switch, Rider.\u201D</p><p>\u201CYeah!\u201D</p><p>Rider struck his knees and ran out with an extremely happy expression, jumping off from the Hanging Gardens. He whistled, and a chariot with three steeds appeared tearing through the sky and scooped up the falling Rider.</p><p>He grasped the reins in the driver\u2019s stand and whipped them once. The neighs of the strong-muscled horses roared through the sky above the battlefield.</p><p>\u201CNow then, the battle is starting! I, Rider of Red, shall cut through the enemy vanguard!\u201D</p><p>Saying so, Rider descended his chariot towards the ground below. Homunculi and golems stood in his path. But both the battle-specialized homunculi and the over one-ton golems pulverized in the path of the immortal divine horses gifted to him by the sea god Poseidon.</p><p>The huge chariot was as fast as a bullet and scraped off the ground where it passed. Rider of Red\u2019s chariot trampled the battlefield just by riding it.</p><p>\u201CCome out, Archer of Black! Show us your power! If you think you can stop this chariot of mine, just try it!\u201D</p><p>The ones who answered his provocations weren\u2019t any Servants, but golems.</p><p>Three golems stepped in front of the fiercely galloping chariot. Clicking his tongue, Rider of Red chose to run them over as if it were natural.</p><p>\u201COut of my way, small fry!\u201D</p><p>At those words, Caster of Black, who was watching the battlefield from afar, muttered.</p><p>\u201C\u2014Now then. I wonder how that will go, Rider of Red.\u201D</p><p>The instant Rider\u2019s chariot crashed into them, the three golems split apart. Ignoring the surprised Rider, the golems each entwined themselves with the legs of the chariot\u2019s horses and then instantly hardened themselves.</p><p>\u201CGuh\u2026!!\u201D</p><p>Although it continued its mad charge, Rider of Red\u2019s chariot finally came to a stop. Seeing that, the homunculi swung the halberds in their hands and jumped at him all at once.</p><p>\u201CYou impudent little\u2014!\u201D</p><p>Removing his hands from the reins, Rider of Red took out his sword from the scabbard at his waist with one hand and swung his hero-slaying spear with the other as he jumped out from the driver\u2019s stand.</p><p>The confrontation last a single instant. In that moment, Rider took away the lives of every single one of the attacking homunculi. Blood gushed out from them and poured down on the ground like rain.</p><p>There\u2019s an opening.</p><p>There was a single Servant who saw that moment as an opening. Rider\u2019s body reacted to the killing intent being directed at him then. But the blood of the homunculi was blocking his vision.<br> Passing through a gap between the corpses, an arrow was shot at the nape of Rider\u2019s neck.</p><p>\u201C\u2026Kuh!!\u201D</p><p>Though his reaction was an instant delayed, Rider of Red\u2019s quick-wittedness and agility allowed him to strike down the arrow with his sword. However, he couldn\u2019t completely knock it away and even with its trajectory change the arrow still grazed his neck.</p><p>Vivid red blood dripped down his neck. His surprise at being wounded was turned into joy instead of humiliation for Rider.</p><p>That\u2019s right, there was a Servant who could wound him among the Black camp\u2014Archer!</p><p>Standing back on the driver\u2019s stand, Rider loudly shouted with a majestic and imposing attitude.</p><p>\u201CWhere is Archer of Black!? I\u2019ve come to resume our earlier match! Let\u2019s fight and kill each other to our heart\u2019s content this evening!\u201D</p><p>In place of an answer, another arrow was fired at him. But it was an easy matter for Rider to strike down an arrow as long as his vision was not blocked.</p><p>\u201CWhere are you, Archer of Black!?\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2014I\u2019m closer than you think.\u201D</p><p>The instant Rider turned around, Archer, who had been hidden behind a golem, fired another arrow while concealing everything but his bow and arrow from sight. Due to having additional prana loaded into it, this arrow was far faster than the ones he shot earlier\u2014!</p><p>\u201CGuh\u2026!?\u201D</p><p>The arrow was aimed at his face\u2014to be more precise, at his right eye. Rider raised his sword and used its blade to knock away the arrow. But due to that, his vision was momentarily blocked. Taking advantage of that opening, Archer ran and jumped behind a different golem, and then fired another arrow.</p><p>\u201CYou bastard\u2026!\u201D</p><p>Archer never showed himself, and fired arrows one after another at Rider while running around and hiding himself behind golems.</p><p>\u2014Archer was baiting him.</p><p>Little by little, the golems moved away from the middle of the battlefield. I see, Rider thought in understanding. If Rider of Red and his chariot remained on the battlefield, it would turn into a difficult battle for the Black camp.</p><p>Naturally, he could just ignore Rider. The interior of a forest was the ideal field for a bowman. He could hide around everywhere and fire arrows. Conversely, fighting in a forest was a fatal situation for Rider. After all, he wouldn\u2019t be able to use his crucial chariot within it.</p><p>\u2026But that was limited to normal Servants of the Rider class. At the very least, doing this was an obvious mistake when it came to Rider of Red.</p><p>Certainly, Rider boasted of extraordinary power when he rode his chariot. It was very difficult to stop his chariot, which was firm and rode like lightning. One of his three steeds was simply a fine and famous horse, but the other two were divine horses bestowed upon him by the sea god Poseidon.</p><p>Therefore, if his goal was to defeat the enemy on the battlefield and win, the correct decision would be to ignore Archer\u2019s provocations, cut down the golems entangling his chariot, and continue to trample over the enemy battle line.</p><p>But that logical plan had a single flaw. Was it right for anyone who called themselves a hero for even an instant to choose the option of running away here?</p><p>No, absolutely not. For the sake of the honor of his father who was a great hero, of his mother who was a goddess, and of his eternal friend with whom he shared many joys and sorrows in life, he absolutely could not run away.</p><p>While shouting \u201CWait!\u201D, Rider left the battle following Archer. He returned his chariot to its astralized state and headed into the forest on his own two feet. Rider knew that Archer of Black must be laughing at him. After all, Rider let himself be lured into a terrain advantageous to the enemy and negated his own advantages.</p><p>\u2026Yes, even now, Rider did not know who Archer was. That is, he thought he didn\u2019t know Archer. Perhaps he should have been even a little more attentive and considered even the most meager of possibilities.</p><p>But it was pointless. There would have been barely any difference whether he wavered before or after it happened.</p><p>Rider didn\u2019t fail to hear the sound of a bowstring being drawn back in preparation to fire an arrow, and searched his surrounding with complete concentration. He could definitely feel the presence of a Servant. But he couldn\u2019t pinpoint their exact location. The only thing he knew for certain was that he was in Archer\u2019s attack range.</p><p>Rider swore to himself that he wouldn\u2019t experience the same humiliation as last time. While walking about, he suddenly stepped on a dead branch. The instant the sound of it breaking resounded through the far too quiet forest\u2014an arrow was fired.</p><p>\u2014I already foresaw something like that.</p><p>He struck down the arrow with the butt end of his spear. Rider was already capable of reading through the trajectory of Archer\u2019s arrows. This was the result of calmly repeating the previous battle in his head and thinking over how to match it with his movements.</p><p>\u201CDon\u2019t think you can hit me a second or third time, bowman! This time, I\u2019ll be the one\u2026 heading to you!\u201D</p><p>It only took him an instant. He jumped and advanced forward by kicking off the branches of nearby trees. His physical prowess was abnormal, but it wasn\u2019t an impossible feat for a Servant. But, even taking into account the fact that he was a Servant, his speed still greatly stood out.</p><p>With speed equivalent to instant movement and not worrying about any obstacles in his way, Rider raced towards where the arrow was fired from.</p><p>There was suddenly a faint noise. It seemed the enemy had moved as well. As usual, Archer hid amongst the trees, preventing Rider from seeing about him or her anything besides a faint outline. If Archer of Red was in his place, she could use the enemy\u2019s scent as one means to track them, but Rider\u2019s sense of smell wasn\u2019t that strong.</p><p>Arrows were fired at him one after another\u2026 Their trajectories were far too easy to read and were merely aimed haphazardly. Rider laughed scornfully and repelled them with his spear. It was far too easy for him to parry and dodge them. Rider could really feel that he was cornering him.</p><p>The next arrow. Immediately after the next arrow was fired, Rider would corner him\u2014or her.</p><p>\u2014Shoot, shoot, shoot, hurry up and shoot!</p><p>Rider\u2019s wish was granted. He grabbed the next arrow immediately as it was fired and, with a laugh, brought his face close to Archer.</p><p>\u201CI got you.\u201D</p><p>Archer of Black should have been surprised. No, he had to have been surprised. Archer was completely cornered, had any possible attack sealed, and finally had allowed himself to be approached at a fatal distance for a bowman.</p><p>And yet, that man was so calm that it made Rider somewhat uneasy. He even smiled at Rider despite how close he was.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014No, wait.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014I\u2019ve seen this man before.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014No, I\u2019ve talked with him, learned from him, and shared bed and food with him\u2026</p><p>\u201CY\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014ou.\u201D</p><p>\u201CYes, that is your weak point.\u201D</p><p>Archer of Black said that in a quiet voice and kicked the man in front of him in the solar plexus. Rider\u2019s body went flying back through the air at the strong blow. Landing on the ground, Archer nocked an arrow on his bow with a fluid movement\u2014and fired it.</p><p>\u201C\u2026Kuh!!\u201D</p><p>Rider understood that the arrow\u2019s target was his \u2018vital point\u2019, and immediately he frayed the nerves throughout his entire body. He screwed his body and bent his joints to the limit, trying to at least get it away from the arrow\u2019s trajectory.</p><p>\u2014He succeeded.</p><p>Instead of his vital point, the arrow pierced through his flank. Vivid pain ran through Rider\u2019s entire body, but he paid it no heed. The man standing below him was a bigger problem.</p><p>All the mysteries surrounding Archer of Black had been cleared up. It was only natural that his skill with the bow was equal to that of Archer of Red\u2014Atalanta. After all, he was a teacher to many heroes including Rider himself.</p><p>Rider pulled out the arrow from his flank and tossed it away as he stood up. Archer didn\u2019t move even slightly as he held his bow, as if waiting for Rider to speak.</p><p>\u201C\u2014Why are you here?\u201D</p><p>\u201CWhat a foolish question. I was summoned as Archer of Black in this Great Holy Grail War. And you were summoned as Rider of Red. We each have wishes and regrets that bind us. That\u2019s why we are here. Both me and you.\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2026\u201D</p><p>Rider cast his eyes down and remained silent. Archer sighed and chided him.</p><p>\u201CYou\u2019re truly soft. Has that part of you alone not been cured from your previous life? You\u2019re stern to the end towards those you\u2019ve acknowledged as enemies, but you\u2019re always soft when faced with people who you\u2019ve already acknowledged as \u2018good people\u2019 when they temporarily cease to be your allies. That may be a lovable trait as a hero. But this is the Great Holy Grail War\u2014there is no room for feeling anything like mercy or compassion. Even someone who is called a hero like you understands that, right?\u201D</p><p>\u2014You understand that, right, Achilles?</p><p>Archer spoke Rider of Red\u2019s true name. The young man known as Achilles nodded once with a grave attitude, like a pupil receiving a lesson.</p><hr><p>Lancer of Black was unarmed. He wasn\u2019t wielding his spear, and merely rode his horse.</p><p>Dragon Tooth Warriors became roused up as they sensed the approach of a Servant. It wasn\u2019t just one or two hundred of them. A force of over five hundred Dragon Tooth Warriors tried to swarm him.</p><p>Of course, a pile of small fry soldiers was no problem at all for a Servant like him. But it would still be foolhardy to plunge straight into the midst of them.</p><p>Lancer made his golem horse kick off the ground and jump high through the air. Spreading his arms wide, he declared in a sonorous voice.</p><p>\u201CCome, savages who trample over my territory! It\u2019s time to discipline you! I\u2019ll turn my compassion and rage into red-hot stakes and skewer you all! And these stakes are not limited, but truly infinite, so despair\u2014and gorge on your own blood! Kaziklu Bey: Lord of Execution!\u201D</p><p>The ground shook slightly. The Dragon Tooth Warriors reflexively looked down. Instantly, long and narrow stakes were summoned forth throughout the surrounding area and shot up out of the ground as if trying to reach the heavens, piercing the warriors one after another. Trees were created upon the grassland plain. The stakes were slender tree trunks, and the leaves and branches were made of bone.</p><p>In the three seconds since the moment the Noble Phantasm was activated, all five hundred Dragon Tooth Warriors were annihilated.</p><p>Lancer ignored them all and merely kept heading straight towards the Hanging Gardens.</p><p>\u2026Of course, those who sensed his intention immediately came out to intercept him.</p><p>\u201CSo you\u2019ve come.\u201D</p><p>Lancer sighted two Servants heading towards him at raging speed. One held a bow, and the other held a spear\u2014in other words, they were Archer and Lancer of Red.</p><p>While gripped by a strange joy over fighting a Servant of the same class as himself, Lancer of Black aimed at them and summoned his stakes all at once. Stakes shot up one after another upon the grassland plain they ran across. Though she dashed faster and more nimbly than a horse, Archer of Red\u2019s speed began to dull.</p><p>A stake appeared right before her eyes. Gripping the stake, she coiled her body around it like a monkey and fired an arrow at the horse-mounted Lancer.</p><p>But a stake shot out in front of Lancer and blocked the arrow. While still atop his horse, Lancer calmly remained still there. Archer of Red fired another series of arrows, but they were all blocked by stakes that shot out of the ground.</p><p>This Lancer was able to protect himself with stakes\u2014Archer of Red had to acknowledge that. These stakes appeared to be his Noble Phantasm. In that case, Father Shirou had been right; this man was Lancer of Black, and his true name was\u2014</p><p>\u201CI suppose you\u2019re Lancer of Black, Vlad III, right?\u201D</p><p>Just as Lancer of Red\u2014Karna said, he was Romania\u2019s greatest hero, Vlad III.</p><p>\u201CHoh. Are you, who calls me by my true name, Lancer of Red?\u201D</p><p>\u201CThat\u2019s right. Due to circumstances, I\u2019ll be taking you down. Don\u2019t think ill of me.\u201D</p><p>\u201CNo, no, there\u2019s no need to think ill of either of us. You people must kill me, and I must kill you all. It\u2019s tragic, but that\u2019s how reality is. Besides, it is my duty as a king to kill those who invade my country. So there\u2019s no need to grieve.\u201D</p><p>A stake shot out of the ground right before Lancer of Red\u2019s eyes.</p><p>\u201C\u2014Hmm.\u201D</p><p>But the divine spear that Lancer of Red held easily smashed the stake.</p><p>\u201CI see. These stakes really are your Noble Phantasm\u2014but these enormous numbers are abnormal.\u201D</p><p>Countless Dragon Tooth Warriors had been pierced and hoisted high upon the surrounding stakes. Just like humans who had been left there till the point they turned into skeletons.</p><p>Yes, if it was just a matter of the stakes themselves being his Noble Phantasm, it was still fine. Individually, they didn\u2019t have that much destructive power and their speed was also slow\u2026 But their numbers were too many, already surpassing a thousand. Furthermore, they sprouted out suddenly from the ground, making it difficult to dodge them.</p><p>Quantity\u2014that was the greatest characteristic of this Noble Phantasm. The number of stakes he could potentially summon equaled approximately twenty thousand. This Noble Phantasm was already extraordinary in this regard. Certainly, there existed Anti-Army and Anti-Fortress Noble Phantasms that could kill hundreds and thousands of people.</p><p>But there were very few that could kill over ten thousand people.</p><p>This was not because his Noble Phantasm was a holy sword or divine spear, but rather a reproduction of an [event] that historically occurred\u2014that is, the legend of how he skewered twenty thousand Ottoman Turk soldiers.</p><p>Certainly, a single stake might be insufficient and worthless for this Noble Phantasm.</p><p>But\u2014an overwhelming number like twenty thousand was overpowering even for Heroic Spirits of valor. While it was nothing short of madness, it was also an elaborate display of military force that none could match. It was an act that was no longer possible for human beings to commit.</p><p>And so this Noble Phantasm is called Kaziklu Bey: Lord of Execution, the most fearsome Noble Phantasm with the same title as its owner.</p><p>\u201CLancer!\u201D</p><p>Archer of Red called out to Lancer of Red. Of course, Lancer also understood it well. Prana was whirling and converging together out from Lancer of Black in front them\u2026!</p><p>\u201CNow then, criminals who have trespassed upon my land without permission. It\u2019s time for your judgement. Die on the battlefield along with those garbage Dragon Tooth Warriors.\u201D</p><p>Lancer of Black slightly moved his finger tip\u2014and instantly after.</p><p>Stakes suddenly struck out from the ground, aimed at the two Red Servants. Archer promptly avoided them by jumping into the air, but, as if having predicted that, stakes sprang up after her one after another.</p><p>Lancer of Red also jumped reflexively. He judged that, if he stepped on the ground, the stakes would aim for his feet. But the stakes sprang up all at once in order to pierce his falling body.</p><p>He brandished his divine spear once more\u2014but the stakes he destroyed were replaced by new stakes that seemed to thrust out of the previous ones.</p><p>\u201C\u2014Destroying them is meaningless, huh?\u201D</p><p>As Lancer of Red gripped his lance with one hand, the stakes struck out to attack him once more. It was just like a muddy stream of stakes. Even so, Lancer of Red dealt with the situation without panicking at all.</p><p>In the first place, the armor he wore, Kavacha and Kundala: O Surya, Become Armor, was an absolute defensive Noble Phantasm that possessed the radiance of the sun, granted to him by the gods. It easily repelled the stakes of a king.</p><p>But\u2014</p><p>\u201CWhat splendid armor you have.\u201D</p><p>Lancer of Black\u2019s voice came from closer than he\u2019d expected. Having equipped with himself a spear in one hand without anyone noticing, Lancer of Black finally arrived near the Red Servants.</p><p>Yes. He had ran atop the stakes with his golem horse. And while Lancer of Red was trapped by the stakes and unable to move, Lancer of Black moved to pierce the back of his neck with his spear.</p><p>\u201CBut it\u2019s meaningless if I approach this close.\u201D</p><p>\u201CLancer\u2026!!\u201D</p><p>Archer of Red fired an arrow, but stakes blocked the arrow like protective walls. Not asking for help, unable to even move, Lancer of Red was about to be pierced by the spearhead\u2014and yet, his expression remained completely calm.</p><p>The instant Lancer of Black tried to pierce his throat with his spear, Lancer of Red\u2019s body began to shine dazzlingly as if to pierce through the night.</p><p>The skill possessed by the Heroic Spirit Karna, [Prana Burst]. It had the same name as the skill possessed by Saber of Red, but in his case this skill specialized in [flames].</p><p>The stakes that held him and restrained his body were all burnt away. The scene looked as if the flame god Agni had descended upon the earth. A stream of fire formed around Lancer of Red as if to burn away the ground, yet it didn\u2019t harm even a single strand of his hair.</p><p>Lancer of Red landed upon the now bare ground with a movement that even looked elegant. Watching him, Archer of Red sighed in amazement.</p><p>\u201CYou should have done that from the beginning.\u201D</p><p>\u201CIt wouldn\u2019t have worked as well as you think. My prana consumption as a Servant is quite bad. I can\u2019t maintain doing that kind of thing for even ten seconds.\u201D</p><p>\u201CIt\u2019s quite troublesome,\u201D Lancer of Red added with a sigh. The Heroic Spirit Karna was unmistakably top class. However, with his golden armor that was continuously active, the magnificent divine spear he held, and the [Prana Burst] he used just now, he consumed an extraordinary amount of prana as well. A normal magus probably wouldn\u2019t be able to move even a single finger while supporting him. Even a first-rate magus would be exhausted to the point that they couldn\u2019t use their own magecraft.</p><p>As such, he was grateful that he hadn\u2019t received a single complaint from his Master, but he couldn\u2019t just take advantage of it either. In that regard, it could be said that Lancer of Red had disciplined himself quite well.</p><p>\u201C\u2014It seems you aren\u2019t an ordinary Heroic Spirit.\u201D</p><p>Lancer of Black muttered in a cold voice while dusting soot off himself. There was no sign of even the slightest mental agitation or anger in his countenance.</p><p>\u201CWill you surrender?\u201D</p><p>\u201CRegardless of whether you\u2019re joking or serious, don\u2019t spout stupid words, Lancer of Red. As long as I have a wish to ask of the Holy Grail, I will never surrender. Besides\u2014\u201D</p><p>Lancer of Black waved his right hand, and an intent to kill oozed out from the surrounding ground. There were still more than enough stakes present, which kept watch on the two Heroic Spirits. Furthermore, the Red Servants could sense that [something] more foreboding had started to move from the distant rear of the Black army.</p><p>\u201CAren\u2019t you the ones who should be surrendering? Though, I won\u2019t show mercy to you all who are invaders on top of being pagans.\u201D</p><p>Indeed, Lancer of Red could burn to ash and crush the stakes with his flames and divine spear. But the Red camp\u2019s odds of successfully opposing the Black camp\u2019s overwhelming amount of material resources were fifty-fifty. Fighting a force of twenty thousand was beyond the capacities of even a mighty Heroic Spirit. Even then, there would have been no problems if they were alive, but right now they were Servants. The more they consumed prana in great quantities, the closer they approached death.</p><p>\u201C\u2014That\u2019s true. Please forget that joke just now. Let\u2019s go, Archer.\u201D</p><p>\u201CCome.\u201D</p><p>Lancer of Red swung his divine spear in preparation with both hands and Archer of Red nocked another arrow. Standing in their way was the one who ruled this land, the \u2018Dracul\u2019 Lord.</p><p>At the same time as the golem horse neighed, the clash between three Servants recommenced.</p><hr><p>Though somewhat hesitant, Rider of Black rode his hippogriff towards the Hanging Gardens. The only one who could fly through the sky among the Black camp was himself, so first he should restrain that thing. That was the conclusion he came to after straining his non-existent wisdom.</p><p>However, he had one concern. He had summoned the hippogriff and was simply using it as a mount. At this level, its prana consumption wasn\u2019t that much. A single homunculus was enough to cover the cost. The problem was if he recited its true name and displayed its full power.</p><p>Its prana consumption then would equal that of unleashing the full power of an A rank Noble Phantasm. Moreover, the prana consumption wouldn\u2019t decrease after firing it once. It was a Noble Phantasm with an exceedingly bad fuel consumption that would continue expending prana non-stop as long as he continued to keep the hippogriff deployed.</p><p>\u2026In his mind, he recalled the homunculi who were being sucked dry of prana without their consent. He remembered Sieg\u2019s extremely feeble plea.</p><p>After wavering over it for a short while, Rider of Black decided to seal away the use of his Noble Phantasm\u2019s true name. After all, right now, he didn\u2019t want to use it. So he had no choice but to choose an alternative option where he didn\u2019t need to use it.</p><p>Yes, he truly was a fool. What a foolish thought. And weak as well. He should unleash his Noble Phantasm\u2019s true name without minding the homunculi who served as prana batteries. Even Sieg wouldn\u2019t condemn Rider for it. He wouldn\u2019t ask that much of a Servant who was summoned in order to fight and win.</p><p>But Astolfo was that kind of Heroic Spirit. Since he didn\u2019t want to do it, he wouldn\u2019t do it no matter what anyone said.</p><p>\u201C\u2026All right, let\u2019s go!\u201D</p><p>In front of the floating fortress, Rider lightly clapped the nape of the hippogriff\u2019s neck with his usual carefree manner. The hippogriff responded with a shrill bird-like cry and strongly flapped its wings. And so it flew forward\u2014with particles of light flowing out from the wings along with a raging wind and lighting up the air, like countless fireflies, before disappearing immediately after.</p><p>Rider flew towards the Hanging Gardens\u2026 Though naturally, the mistress of the floating fortress wouldn\u2019t allow his thoughtless actions.</p><p>\u201C\u2014Hoh, it seems the other camp\u2019s Rider also has a mount that can fly across the heavens. In that case, these ones I\u2019ve prepared won\u2019t go to waste then.\u201D</p><p>The only remaining person within the floating fortress\u2014the Hanging Gardens of Babylon\u2014Assassin of Red, smiled faintly and released \u2018them\u2019 into the sky.</p><p>\u201CGo, ugly winged ones. Fly and devour the enemy to your hearts\u2019 content.\u201D</p><p>Along with those words, countless big humanoid [things] flew off from the gardens all at once.</p><p>Rider flew across the sky over the battlefield. He saw that the second powerful clash between the two armies had already begun. Dragon Tooth Warriors, homunculi and golems. Additionally, the other Servants were clashing with each other and fighting life-or-death struggles.</p><p>\u201CAll right. I have to work hard too\u2026!\u201D</p><p>As Rider renewed his fighting spirit, monsters appeared and swooped down to attack him with good timing. Their upper halves were the same as the Dragon Tooth Warriors, but these had wings sprouting from their back and their lower halves were clearly bird-like.</p><p>\u201CHarpies\u2026? No, modified versions combined with Dragon Tooth Warriors?\u201D</p><p>Harpies, avarice-filled flying beasts, were creatures that couldn\u2019t help being easily led astray by their appetite, possessing cruel habits and a cowardly nature that made them unsuitable as soldiers. But Assassin of Red had fused them with Dragon Tooth Warriors. Rather than Dragon Tooth Warriors, perhaps it would be more appropriate to call these Dragon Wing Warriors. Either way, considering they were named after \u2018dragons\u2019, they were very thin and ugly-looking soldiers.</p><p>But they were great in numbers. The sight of over a hundred Dragon Wing Warriors attacking down was just like the scene of a sky burial with birds rushing to eat the offered corpse. With their claws sharper than metal, they swooped down all at once to eliminate the insolent intruder who sought to trespass on the gardens.</p><p>\u2014But they were facing the worst possible opponent for them.</p><p>After all, their enemy was a hippogriff, a creature counted among the Phantasmal Species. There was no way it would lose to mere small fry like them. And the one who rode it was also the worst possible enemy for them as well.</p><p>Rider of Black, Astolfo of Charlemagne\u2019s Twelve Paladins. He, who had gone through many adventures, possessed various Noble Phantasms that displayed effects under restricted conditions. His lance that specialized in throwing down the enemy, his book that destroyed all magecraft, and a phantasmal steed that possessed a power worthy of special mention in regards to a certain point.</p><p>And the hunting horn he currently held in his hand was the most extreme of his Noble Phantasms.</p><p>\u201CPlease line up in a row, won\u2019t you? Here we go\u2014La Black Luna: Magic Flute That Calls Panic!\u201D</p><p>Along with that shout that contained no tension at all, the hunting horn hanging from his waists expanded and became huge.</p><p>\u201CDisappear!\u201D</p><p>He sucked in a huge breath\u2014and then released it all in one breath into the horn. The high-pitched call of the horn resounded through the battlefield. All homunculi and Dragon Tooth Warrior instantly looked up at the sky above.</p><p>The roar of a dragon, the cry of a giant bird, the neigh of a divine horse\u2014an enchanted sound which was comparable to all those things made the Dragon Wing Warriors, who should have numbered over a hundred, vanish like mist in an instant. They had been literally blown away. It wasn\u2019t something as simple as \u201CThe harpies ran away in fear after hearing that sound\u201D as told of in myths. The horn was a genuine weapon of wide-scale destruction.</p><p>\u201CAll right, straight ahead, straight ahead. Let\u2019s go!\u201D</p><p>Hanging his now miniaturized horn back on his waist, Rider of Black once more gripped the reins with both hands\u2014</p><p>\u2014Things won\u2019t go that well for you, lovely battle maiden.</p><p>He noticed a black-clad woman standing at the front of the gardens. She was without a doubt a Servant. Rider of Black guessed her class based on her clothes.</p><p>\u201C\u2026You look to be Caster of Red! Prepare yourself!\u201D</p><p>The black-clad Servant smiled wryly at Rider of Black\u2019s shout.</p><p>\u201CI\u2019m afraid you\u2019re mistaken. I am Assassin of Red. However\u2014just as you surmised, I have some small amount of confidence in my skill with magecraft. Let me test to see if you have the qualifications to enter my [gardens].\u201D</p><p>She snapped her fingers once. Instantly, waves of prana unfolded around her. Perhaps due to the spell having already been set up beforehand, shining purple magic circles that gave the impression of pre-loaded cannons suddenly appeared in the air around her.</p><p>\u201CAh, by the way, there are more of these above and below. Please be careful.\u201D</p><p>Rider of Black reflexively looked at the sky above and below and was left dumbfounded. The magic circles weren\u2019t limited to just the four that had appeared around her. There were four more above him and four more below. They were all loaded with huge amounts of prana and were impatiently waiting for Assassin\u2019s order\u2014!</p><p>\u201C\u2014Fall.\u201D</p><p>With the order to fire given, the cannons fired all at once. With sounds similar to ferocious roars, pillars of light easily broke through the barrier of the air and shot at Rider of Black.</p><p>\u201CJust try it\u2026!!\u201D</p><p>Rider of Black had the continuously-active type Noble Phantasm, Luna Break Manual: Universal Magic Guide\u2014though the name was just temporary\u2014and as such was granted A rank Magic Resistance. In practice, this effectively meant that he couldn\u2019t be harmed by modern magi.</p><p>That\u2019s why he chose to attack like this. If he didn\u2019t have that book, even he would falter over conducting a direct assault.</p><p>But Rider of Black did not know. The Assassin in front him actually possessed a rule-breaking double class that allowed her to simultaneously act as the Caster class as well. And she was currently standing in the Hanging Gardens of Babylon, a great Noble Phantasm which surpassed the highest-grade [Temple] that could be created with the class skill [Territory Creation] of the Caster class.</p><p>In other words, she had basically barricaded herself in a solid fortress that deployed fiendish weapons of mass destruction. Approaching her was the same as throwing oneself before her to be killed.</p><p>Unable to dodge, his entire body was struck by EX rank blasts of prana, and as if unsatisfied with just that, the blasts ransacked the inside of his body and relentlessly and thoroughly violated him.</p><p>\u201CKuaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!!\u201D</p><p>The hippogriff vanished with that cry, and Rider of Black fell towards the ground below. Watching him fall, Assassin of Red murmured with sober eyes.</p><p>\u201CWhat\u2019s this? I did say to fall, but even so, there\u2019s a limit to how quickly you should be defeated. How boring. I thought you had a bit of promise when you instantly annihilated my Dragon Wing Warriors, but\u2014\u201D</p><p>She switched her gaze to the battle below. Seen from above, the flow of battle seemed to be going back and forth between the two sides. Their Rider was facing Archer of Black, while Lancer and Archer were facing Lancer of Black. And her own Master, Shirou was\u2014</p><p>\u201C\u2026Hoh.\u201D</p><p>A smile peeked through her expression as she watched that particular scene. Though it was regrettable that his opponent was Berserker, his expression didn\u2019t look perturbed at all.</p><p>\u201CVery well then. Show me, Shirou, the first bright and clear battle campaign of my Master.\u201D</p><hr><p>Berserker of Black, Frankenstein, didn\u2019t show it much in her expression, but she was troubled.</p><p>Obeying her orders, she had at first prowled the battlefield looking for enemy Servants, and she had leapt into the forest after seeing a human figure there, but what she found there wasn\u2019t a Servant, but instead\u2014</p><p>\u201CIt seems you\u2019re my opponent, Frankenstein. The sorrowful monster created by humans in pursuit of an ideal. In a certain sense, you are both a turning point and a midway being that should be aimed for.\u201D</p><p>The one who whispered those strange words as if subtly mistaking the situation was a human. He didn\u2019t seem to be a Servant. But was the man before her eyes really a human being?</p><p>For some reason, Berserker of Black\u2019s intuitive perception was vague on that point.</p><p>\u201CUu\u2014\u2014\u201D</p><p>Dragon Tooth Warriors were attacking her, but she dealt with them easily. On the other hand, since they never laid a hand on the man in front of her, she was able to comprehend that he was on the enemy side.</p><p>But even so. Why did he know her true name?</p><p>Just like how her Master Caules had been surprised, Frankenstein was generally recorded as being male, and a huge man who could stab the clouds at that. So it shouldn\u2019t be possible for anyone to guess her identity based on her appearance.</p><p>\u2026Had he met her during her lifetime?</p><p>That was also impossible. She was a young Heroic Spirit who had been born right at the very end of the era when mysteries could still come into existence. There were few people who had lived in the same era as her that could have become Heroic Spirits, and even if there were, she had never chanced upon meeting any of them.</p><p>So did someone expose her true name to the enemy\u2026?</p><p>\u201CYes, you truly are distinct. Though a Berserker, you retain a certain degree of higher-order thought. Truly a modern Heroic Spirit.\u201D</p><p>While giving a carefree smile, the man held out his hand to Berserker.</p><p>\u201CI know and understand you quite well. How about it? Would you be interested in coming over to our side to replace Berserker of Red?\u201D</p><p>At those words, Berserker became filled with wariness and growled menacingly. The man let his hand fall back down with a bitter smile.</p><p>\u201CThat\u2019s useless, my Master.\u201D</p><p>Berserker\u2019s wariness increased further. Behind the man, this time someone who was clearly a Servant appeared. There was a thin amount of prana being emitted from him\u2014and his clothing was hardly suited for a battle. Was this the enemy Caster?</p><p>\u201COh my, how rude. I have no intention to fight in the least. The one who will fight is this Master here. I merely watch over and support him.\u201D</p><p>Saying such a thing that was unbecoming of a Servant\u2014he took one step back as if to use the Master as a shield. There was no sign of him using any magecraft to attack. Unbelievably, it seemed this Master\u2026 truly intended to fight her one-on-one.</p><p>\u201CThat\u2019s right. The one to fight will be I, Shirou Kotomine.\u201D</p><p>The instant he let his arms dangle at his side, [hilts] appeared between each of his fingers. Berserker couldn\u2019t tell what kind of weapons they were with her scarce knowledge.</p><p>But those who had seen them before would probably immediately recognize them. They were Conceptual Armaments that dispensed purification and took the form of blades compiled out of prana, known as [Black Keys].</p><p>\u201C\u2014If you ever feel like coming over to our side, please feel free to accept my offer at any time.\u201D</p><p>Saying that with a smile, Shirou launched the Black Keys.</p><p>\u201C\u2026!?\u201D</p><p>While leaping backwards, Berserker swatted the Black Keys with her weapon, the [Bridal Chest].</p><p>\u201C\u2014Naaaaaaaaaaaaaaaooooooh!!\u201D</p><p>With that, her mind was settled. No matter the circumstances, this Master was facing her as an enemy. Regardless of whether it was a trap or not, she didn\u2019t think it would handicap her too much in this situation. Of course, she made sure to never to let herself lower her guard against the nearby materialized Caster. Even then, she didn\u2019t think she was at a disadvantage.</p><p>Berserker did a complete spin and then plunged forward at full speed. Four more Black Keys were thrown from the man\u2019s hands. They moved at a splendid speed for weapons thrown by a human, and if she were attacked by them with her guard down, she would probably be skewered.</p><p>But there was no point in throwing them at her right from the front with such unrefined skill. She repelled them once more and advanced further forward.</p><p>\u201C\u2014As expected of a hero like you.\u201D</p><p>He praised her with a relaxed expression. Irritation slightly gushed forth in Berserker\u2019s mind. Let\u2019s test out whether he would continue acting composed like this even after she smashed that face of his\u2014!</p><p>\u201C\u2014Set.\u201D</p><p>Instantly, impacts like lightning strikes ran through her surroundings. She immediately turned herself along with her [Bridal Chest] around 380 degrees\u2014the Black Keys she should have repelled had returned, aiming at her once again. It seemed such a spell had been inserted into the hilts beforehand.</p><p>\u201CHow disappointing.\u201D</p><p>Was Shirou\u2019s murmur directed at himself? Or\u2014were those words directed at her for knocking them down in a disappointing manner?</p><p>It makes no difference, Berserker thought, instantly discarding that train of thought. From the beginning, she couldn\u2019t put up with complex thoughts for long periods of time. She just thoroughly, determinedly and honestly advanced forward\u2026!</p><p>\u201CNow then. Caster, I\u2019ll use it now.\u201D</p><p>Shirou said that and held out his hand in the air. Suddenly, his personal weapon was summoned into his hand with a burst of prana. As Berserker charged, her gaze focused on the Japanese blade stored in an iron scabbard. At the same time, she felt unbelievable shock. With an enormous amount of prana converging within it, that blade was clearly\u2014a Noble Phantasm!</p><p>\u201CYes, yes. Please go ahead! Use it to your heart\u2019s content! Like a tempest accompanied by raging flames! Like a torrential rain accompanied by lightning! The eternally continuing story begins now!\u201D</p><p>Along with Caster\u2019s excited shout, Shirou ran forward. He instantly pulled out the sword from the scabbard in his left hand, sunk into a deep posture and thrust the blade forward.</p><p>\u201CUuuuuuuuu!!\u201D</p><p>Caught off guard as she charged, Berserker had a patch of skin torn off from her body. That fact made her truly realize that the blade he held was no ordinary object. There weren\u2019t many weapons that could wound a Servant\u2019s body.</p><p>Berserker swung her mace. It turned into a frantic dance of slashes and strikes. A normal sword would probably break or bend if it received a direct hit from her mace, but the blade did not receive a single scratch no matter how many blows were exchanged.</p><p>He didn\u2019t fight with artistic skill and talent. Shirou\u2019s sword technique was almost average. He was above the level of a rank-and-file warrior, but he was far from being a master. But in that case, why were he and Berserker even with each other as they exchanged blows?</p><p>\u2026It\u2019s true that Berserker wasn\u2019t a Heroic Spirit who had won fame as an embodiment of martial prowess. She was a being that fought ferociously and brutally as a Heroic Spirit due to her origins. But even so, her basic specs were exceptional. Able to create an infinite cycle by reproducing a pseudo-Type II Perpetual Motion Machine, she could continue moving at full power in any kind of situation. She would never run out of breath and tire, unlike a human. She would continue hitting perpetually without breathing until the enemy fell\u2014that was precisely why she was given the title of the mad warrior Berserker.</p><p>Yes, any being who was able exchange blows with that Perpetual Motion Machine head-on could not be called \u2018human\u2019. Of course, since this man was the mediator sent from the Church, he had to be human, and it would be natural to simply say he had accumulated a lot of training.</p><p>But even so, the power he displayed stood out too much. Berserker felt a feeling of unease settle in the pit of her stomach.</p><p>She brandished her mace and instantly swung it down\u2014but he dodged it. If it was that alone, it would have been fine. It wasn\u2019t an unavoidable attack for one who had reached the peak in the domain of magecraft. The problem was how he dodged it. Someone who could give faint smile in this situation, without caring about the fact that her mace, which could crush and knock off his head like a tomato, had just passed in front of his nose by a literally paper-thin distance of only a few milimeters, wasn\u2019t human.</p><p>I don\u2019t like that smile, Berserker thought. I don\u2019t like those eyes, Berserker thought. But most of all\u2014I can\u2019t stand his existence!</p><p>Shirou widened the distance between them with a single jump backwards. He gripped his blade in one hand and held Black Keys in the other.</p><p>The mad artificial human pushed through the rain of thrown Black Keys without the slightest hesitation.</p><hr><p>Choosing the moment when Lancer of Black began fighting against two other Servants from the Red camp, Caster of Black released Berserker of Red. Right now, Lancer of Black was the cornerstone of their camp. Caster of Black judged that he mustn\u2019t be allowed to die.</p><p>\u201CBerserker. I am your Master. Do you understand?\u201D</p><p>\u201CYes, I understand. It seems I can\u2019t continue existing without your power. What an unforgivable enslavement.\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2026Then will you kill me?\u201D</p><p>\u201CBut I can\u2019t kill you. After all, I have a mission for which I must remain in this present era for even a little bit longer. I must strike down the oppressors and grasp the hope that lies at the end of despair. And finally, I must slaughter all those greedy powerful people who have gathered in search of the Holy Grail.\u201D</p><p>\u201CI see. But in order to do that, you must first annihilate the enemy side. Go, Berserker. Your opponents are oppressors and the hounds of those in power. That should be sufficient motive for you.\u201D</p><p>Caster released the seal on Berserker. Unable to endure it even a moment longer, Berserker struggled out of his binds and finally took a step forward.</p><p>The instant he regained his freedom, he turned towards Caster with a gentle smile like the calm sea. But Caster didn\u2019t react at all. Due to the mask he wore, it was impossible to tell whether he was afraid or even felt any emotion at all.</p><p>\u201C\u2026Hmph.\u201D</p><p>Seeming to have lost interest in Caster, Berserker of Red turned to face the battlefield. Happily taking a deep breath, he began walking towards the battlefield with his sword that was far bigger than a standard gladius in his hand.</p><p>Watching him leave, Caster sighed in exasperation. If he had acted too high-handed, Berserker probably would have withdrawn his previous words (since there was no other Servant as fickle as Berserker) and killed him.</p><p>\u201CI\u2019m weak, after all\u2026 I would have been killed by a single blow from him.\u201D</p><p>Though his skin was as pale as a corpse\u2019s, that man was composed of nothing but muscle. He would probably trample through the battlefield and throw the battle into chaos like a demon, returning everything to nothing.</p><p>\u201CNow then, next is\u2014\u201D</p><p>Caster had one remaining duty. That was to choose the timing to sacrifice the magus they had chosen and activate his Noble Phantasm. He had Darnic\u2019s permission, so there were no problems in that regard\u2026 He felt confident about his own abilities, but he still felt some unease over how far he would really be able to go when up against the best chosen Heroic Spirits. But if he couldn\u2019t overcome them, he wouldn\u2019t be able to accomplish his wish.</p><p>The wish that Caster of Black, Avicebron, wanted to entrust to the Holy Grail was complicated. Normally, Heroic Spirits fought and killed one another as they advanced through the Holy Grail War in order to grant their wishes. But the circumstances of his case were slightly different.</p><p>His wish was to complete his Noble Phantasm, Golem Keter Malkuth: Royal Crown, the Light of Wisdom. Then wouldn\u2019t his wish be granted once he activated his Noble Phantasm?</p><p>No, it wouldn\u2019t. In the first place, golems were a part of the Kabbalah style of magecraft, with the word meaning \u2018embryo\u2019 or \u2018moulded being\u2019. Therefore, golems were nothing other than an attempt to reproduce the secret mystery of how God created the human Adam.</p><p>In other words, even if it was completed as a Noble Phantasm, it would still be incomplete. Even if it could wield unparalleled power, it wouldn\u2019t be a truly perfected existence.</p><p>A great king who would lead us humans filled with hardship and suffering to the Garden of Eden once more\u2014that was the role he sought in the supreme golem.</p><p>He had assembled nearly all the necessary materials. All that was left was the final [core]; in other words, a magus. It would have been great if they could have at least captured that homunculus, but he wouldn\u2019t ask for too much.</p><p>\u2018\u2014Sensei!\u2019</p><p>Caster heard a voice from far away. When he turned around and looked up, he saw his Master Roche standing on the castle ramparts and waving his arm innocently at him. Though Caster could see him, Roche was obviously too far for his voice to reach him, so he used telepathic communication.</p><p>\u2018I believe coming out like that is dangerous for you\u2026\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes! Umm, when you come back\u2026 won\u2019t you please look at my golems!? I think I managed to make the latest batch well this time!\u2019</p><p>Caster nodded in an impressed manner. The boy\u2019s passion for golems was quite something. When he was given advice, he would immediately try to correct those points and aim to make them better. Back in Caster\u2019s lifetime, Roche might have been able to serve as his pupil with his outstanding talent.</p><p>Most of all, Caster liked that there was a family lineage that still continued to pass on the mysteries of golem-making that he and his forefathers had created.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019ll look it over if there\u2019s time.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Y\u2026Yes!\u2019</p><p>Roche seemed like he still wanted to say more, but he finally hung his head as if embarrassed and drew back into the castle.</p><p>\u201CEven so, I\u2019m bad with children.\u201D</p><p>In the first place, Caster had suffered from many illnesses during his life, and had spent his days with almost zero contact with other humans. He had even purposefully created maid-type golems to take care of the housework in order to maintain his isolation.</p><p>As a result, he had never had any contact with children, and as such, this situation where a child adored and idolized him like this was simply baffling and uncomfortable for him.</p><p>How ironic. He, who was trying to create the original human Adam in order to reproduce God\u2019s miracle, couldn\u2019t help disliking humans.</p><p>\u201C\u2014Good grief.\u201D</p><p>It would be a lie to say that Caster felt no hesitation over using a magus as the [core]. Even so, completing his Noble Phantasm was Caster\u2019s dearest wish. Therefore, it was necessary to have the resolution to sacrifice everything for the sake of winning.</p><p>And besides, he had received permission from Darnic. That man\u2014Gordes Musik Yggdmillennia would probably be passingly adequate as the [core]. Caster personally wanted to aim for something better to use as his Noble Phantasm, but there were no other options besides Gordes available.</p><p>Caster felt just a little disappointment over that.</p><hr><p>Berserker of Red ignored all the Dragon Tooth Warriors that bit at him, and savagely attacked Lancer and Archer of Red. The reason he attacked wholeheartedly like this was probably because of Lancer of Black.</p><p>Though he had switched his Master and changed camps, Berserker would have undoubtedly attacked Lancer if he weren\u2019t restrained by Caster\u2019s Command Spell. His unconscious desire to do so had naturally led him to the fiercest scene of battle on this battlefield.</p><p>Berserker of Red was truly like a time bomb, but his strength was great enough to invoke fear even in other Servants.</p><p>\u201CTch. I knew I should have shot his tendons back then\u2026!!\u201D</p><p>As she said that, Archer of Red repeatedly shot a strafing of arrows. Her arrows, fired at the same speed as a machine gun, all hit their target. Berserker\u2019s knees now looked like hedgehogs.</p><p>With a strange sound, Berserker of Red\u2019s knees changed to an eerie color like that of overly ripened persimmons, but Berserker didn\u2019t fall.</p><p>\u201C\u2014Archer. Please take care of Berserker. I\u2019ll take care of this lord of impalement, Kaziklu Bey, here.\u201D</p><p>Lancer of Red said that to Archer while crossing spears with Lancer of Black.</p><p>\u201CRoger. Hmph\u2026 Now that I think about it, you are quite a pitiful creature, Berserker!\u201D</p><p>Since he was participating in this Great Holy Grail War, Berserker had to subordinate himself under someone. There might also occasionally be cases where he would have to fight as the dog of some tyrant\u2026 If he had been summoned in the Saber class as a proper swordsman, would he have been able to endure the humiliation of that?</p><p>That\u2019s why, if he was going to fight with the Holy Grail as the prize, he couldn\u2019t be anything but a high-risk Berserker. And his Mad Enhancement was deteriorated to the point of being beyond saving. Most likely, no matter which Holy Grail War he was summoned in, he would never be able to have his wish granted.</p><p>But even so, he smote evil while laughing. He searched for the path of rebellion even while being tormented. A hopeless destroyer who pursued the way of suffering\u2014that was precisely the kind of person Spartacus was.</p><p>Archer of Red therefore deemed him pitiful as she shot her arrows at him. To her, Berserker was merely big-bodied. Both the blows of his gladius swung by his strong arm and his charge were equivalent to motionless in the face of her beast-like speed. But Berserker\u2019s steel-like muscles didn\u2019t falter at all despite being pierced by several arrows.</p><p>\u201CSo tough\u2026 Then how about this!\u201D</p><p>Archer stopped trying to maintain distance between them and vigorously ran forward. She dodged the sweeping slash that came to intercept her by sliding on the ground. As if it were chasing after her, Kaziklu Bey: Lord of Execution shot stakes to pierce her in rapid succession, but they didn\u2019t reach Archer as she dashed forward at full power.</p><p>As she passed through the space between Berserker\u2019s feet, Archer fired arrows at his lower jaw, windpipe, solar plexus and abdomen in a single instant.</p><p>\u201CHahahaha! Not enough! Not enough! Nooooot eeeeeeeeenooooough!!!\u201D</p><p>But Berserker simply turned around and kicked Archer in the stomach with all his might. Hit with an impact equal to that of a direct hit from a cannon ball, Archer was sent flying twenty meters away through the surrounding Dragon Tooth Warriors and homunculi.</p><p>\u201CGuuuh\u2026!\u201D</p><p>Fortunately, she\u2019d managed to jump back and escape by a hair\u2019s breadth right before the kick fully hit. If she hadn\u2019t, it wouldn\u2019t have been strange if the impact had been strong enough to tear her torso off from the rest of her body.</p><p>While agonizing over her carelessness, Archer watched as Berserker approached her. Despite all the arrows she\u2019d shot at him, his mad charge hadn\u2019t changed at all.</p><p>But my arrows should have hit him\u2026</p><p>It was possible for high-ranking Heroic Spirits like Rider of Red, who was beloved by the gods, to negate attacks with their skills or Noble Phantasms. She herself also personally knew a hero who possessed such an ability that was nearly foul play in the form of a Noble Phantasm that completely negated all attacks below a certain rank.</p><p>But there was no such ability among Berserker of Red\u2019s Noble Phantasm and skills that Shirou had informed her about. Of course, it was possible that the priest hadn\u2019t told her about it. But in this situation where Berserker was clearly facing them as an enemy, Shirou had no reason to hide such information.</p><p>And besides, most importantly, her arrows had definitely pierced him. She had received such feedback from them. Perhaps irritated by them, Berserker sometimes pulled out the arrows that pierced him, but he was definitely covered in wounds all over his body.</p><p>Yes, there was even blood flowing from them. She was definitely wounding him. Then, he must simply be enduring them. Perhaps she had merely underestimated his extraordinary stamina.</p><p>No\u2026 something is strange here.</p><p>She was a girl who had spent all her life doing nothing but fighting and hunting. Even as she was nocking another arrow, she observed Berserker\u2019s body from afar and finally noticed it.</p><p>His wounds were healing. Rather than healing, though, it was more like over-regeneration. The pierced parts of his body swelled and bulged like tumors. Archer\u2019s arrows should have pierced holes throughout his body. Then this meant\u2014</p><p>\u201CImpossible, is he\u2026 becoming bigger !?\u201D</p><p>It wasn\u2019t just that. She could feel a torrent of prana from him that was greater than it was before. While clad in a dense concentration of prana all over his body, Berserker swung his sword with strength and speed greater than earlier\u2014!</p><p>\u201CTch\u2026!!\u201D</p><p>Archer jumped as she avoided the downward slash by a paper-thin distance. She jumped upon Berserker\u2019s arm and ran straight towards his face.</p><p>\u201C\u2014Then I\u2019ll take your head!\u201D</p><p>Standing atop Berserker\u2019s shoulder, Archer fired arrow after arrow at the nape of his neck. Thanks to her innate sense of balance, she didn\u2019t fall no matter how much Berserker swung around, and she crawled around his back and, grabbing one of arrows that had pierced him, continued using it to slash his neck.</p><p>When the sound of blood gurgling out began, she stopped and put away the arrow, and then firmly stepped on Berserker\u2019s shoulder with both her feet and pulled up his neck with all her might. At the sound of flesh tearing off as she did so, Berserker began running amuck even more in rage.</p><p>Tripping on the blood gushing out, Archer fell to the ground. She rolled over and reset her stance, and looked over to confirm the state of Berserker\u2019s body\u2014and was naturally left dumbfounded.</p><p>\u201C\u2026This is a bad dream.\u201D</p><p>Archer\u2019s mutter was only natural. Berserker\u2019s neck, which should have been torn off, had flesh bulging from it like a spout of bubbles. It was an extremely disgusting and even slightly ridiculous sight. And Archer could tell that the prana overflowing from inside him had increased even further.</p><p>The Noble Phantasm of Berserker of Red, Spartacus, Crying Warmonger: Howl of the Wounded Beast, was an Anti-Unit Noble Phantasm that affects the user, converting part of the damage received into prana and using the accumulated energy to boost one\u2019s abilities.</p><p>\u201CBut I did not hear anything about it grotesquely morphing even his physical form\u2026 guh!\u201D</p><p>His neck now looking like a turtle\u2019s, Berserker grinned with wide open eyes. While dodging the lash-like attacks of his swinging arms, Archer shot at his hand holding his sword this time in order to tear it off. Once three arrows had dug into his wrist, the gladius finally fell from his hand.</p><p>Archer fiercely sprinted forward and picked up his sword, and then swung it with both her hands to stab it into the back of Berserker\u2019s writhing hand and plant it in the ground.</p><p>He didn\u2019t cry out, but his movements stopped due to being deeply stabbed. If his wrist had been torn off he could have escaped, but unfortunately, due to his excessive regeneration, his wrist had already undergone adhesion.</p><p>\u201CAll right, don\u2019t move for a while.\u201D</p><p>Archer looked around to confirm that there were no Dragon Tooth Warriors, homunculi or golems in the surrounding region, and then nocked another two arrows and fired them into the sky.</p><p>She limited the targeted area to a minimum and focused the arrows onto a single point. She was going to use her Noble Phantasm a second time, but this was currently the optimal choice among the attack options she had, so it couldn\u2019t be helped.</p><p>\u2026Fortunately, her Master did not utter a word of complaint either.</p><p>\u201CI offer thee this calamity\u2014Phoebus Catastrophe: Complaint Message on the Arrow!\u201D</p><p>Berserker of Red stared at the sky and smiled. A shining rain fell down to purify him.</p><p>His entire body was thoroughly torn apart and finely hashed up. Muscle tissue, skin, blood vessels, nerves\u2014all of it was damaged. Even a superior Servant wouldn\u2019t be able to escape from being in a near-death state after that. Instantaneous healing was impossible even with a Master who was a first-rate magus.</p><p>But\u2014</p><p>\u201C\u2026No way.\u201D</p><p>As if in response to Archer\u2019s mutter of mute amazement, the torn-up lump of meat in front of her began squirming.</p><hr><p>Achilles. A great hero who rivaled the legendary Greek hero Heracles in terms of fame. There were probably less than ten heroes, including him, whose names were known on a global scale. However, the number of people decreased when it came to those who knew the story of the rushed and short life of this great sprinter.</p><p>Born from the sea goddess Thetis and the hero Peleus, Achilles was blessed by the gods from birth. His mother Thetis, having greatly loved her son, had warmed him within holy flames in order to try and make him immortal. But her husband Peleus had opposed it, saying \u201CThen that would destroy Achilles as a human\u201D, and in the end Achilles grew up while only a certain part of him remained human.</p><p>Eventually, when war broke out between Troia and Achaea, Achilles was asked the following by his mother Thetis.</p><p>\u2014Do you wish to live a long and peaceful life without having your name recognized by the masses? Or do you wish to live the short life of a hero with brilliant achievements in battle?</p><p>Achilles\u2019 choice went without saying. At the same time as his mother felt pride in his decision, she also felt heartbreakingly sad. Because his fate had been predetermined since he was born. If he lived as a hero, he would have a short life, as if sprinting through it at full speed.</p><p>After having grown up, he participated in the Trojan War as part of the Achaean army and continued achieving many great feats. His body, blessed by all the gods, never received any wounds, and the spear that his father had given to him pierced through all other heroes. With his chariot led by three steeds, consisting of two divine horses given to him as a gift from the sea god and a famous horse he stole while assaulting a certain city, no one could chase after him from behind.</p><p>But during the one-on-one fight between Achilles and the greatest hero in the Trojan War, Hector, who was equal in strength and skill with Achilles, his weak point was exposed. Even if Hector was the killer of Achilles\u2019 close friend Patroclus, the way Achilles insulted him by dragging his corpse around with his chariot was a foolish and intolerable act.</p><p>As a result, he incurred the displeasure of the sun god Apollo, but despite being repeatedly warned to restrain himself, Achilles continued slaughtering the Trojan army. So the enraged Apollo aided the Trojan army\u2019s bow expert Paris, and guided him to shoot Achilles\u2019 only weak point\u2014that is, his heel.</p><p>Having his heart pierced by arrows one after another afterwards, Achilles sensed his own death, but continued fiercely fighting and using all his strength to kill the soldiers of the Trojan army around him. Just as predicted, he had a short life, but his legend as a hero was carved into the world.</p><p>A human who was exceedingly close to the level of the gods, a fast-sprinting hero with an invincible body. But his heel alone\u2014was this hero\u2019s vital weak point.</p><p>And Archer of Black, Chiron, served as Achilles\u2019 teacher. When Achilles was a young child, his mother Thetis returned to her home at the bottom of the sea due to discord with his father Peleus. Chiron, who had raised many heroes, was an old friend of Peleus, and happily accepted the role of training Achilles.</p><p>\u2026Yes. It was only natural that Achilles had wavered for an instant. Chiron had been an absolute figure and symbol to his younger self. His gentleness, seriousness and words had been engraved like magic into the young Achilles.</p><p>For nine years\u2014Chiron was a father, teacher, older brother and close friend whom he spent his childhood with, when he was at his most sensitive. For Achilles, who was the son of a hero, had received the blessings of the Olympian gods and had been given looks of awe, respect and admiration from many young warriors, there were few people he could truly call his friends or teachers.</p><p>Chiron was, beyond a doubt, one of those few people. He was someone Achilles could trust just as much as his close friend Patroclus.</p><p>That hero was now blocking his way in search for the Holy Grail.</p><p>As Archer of Black, as an enemy, and as an opponent to be killed\u2014</p><p>\u201C\u2014Here I come, sensei.\u201D</p><p>\u201CSuch words are unnecessary, Rider of Red.\u201D</p><p>Though he withered slightly at being spurned by those harsh words, Rider of Red fiercely swung his spear. The two of them began fighting while keeping sufficient distance between them to talk with each other. In other words, the bowman was allowing the attacking, lightly-armored warrior to get up close to him.</p><p>Even while Rider was gripped by a little regret, his spear tip didn\u2019t dull and aimed at the enemy\u2019s heart. However, with reckless courage like that of a mad warrior who knew no fear, Archer of Black took a step forward at the same time as the spear was thrust.</p><p>The skill of the famous sprinter Achilles with the spear was so great that he would have no trouble being summoned as a Lancer. Normally speaking, he would have had easily gouged out Archer\u2019s heart.</p><p>But Rider had fatally forgotten one point.</p><p>Instead of gouging his enemy\u2019s heart, his spear tip ended up passing by Archer\u2019s flank.</p><p>\u201CWha\u2026!!\u201D</p><p>\u201CDid you forget, Rider? Who gave you this spear and taught you the basics of using it?\u201D</p><p>Rider received a shock from Archer\u2019s words. Just as he said, Rider hadn\u2019t refined his spear skills with self-taught training. In the beginning, he was taught the basics by his teacher Chiron. Therefore, it was only natural that Archer would see through all his body\u2019s movements and habits. Furthermore, this spear was originally given to his father Peleus as a wedding gift for him and his wife, so he could also completely grasp its distance and reach.</p><p>And Archer had displayed an even more shocking technique than that. At the same time as he stepped forward, he had nocked an arrow on his bow. Truly a quick draw. He had set up an unavoidable shot from zero-distance.</p><p>\u201C\u2014You\u2019re going to die, you know, Rider?\u201D</p><p>Fixing his aim on Rider\u2019s skull, Archer fired the arrow without hesitation. Rider bent backwards right away to dodge it. With movements capable of unbelievable quickness and readiness, he managed to just barely avoid it so it only grazed his skin.</p><p>But then Archer shot a kick at him at that moment. With his stance destroyed, Rider was blown away and impacted against a tree. The instant the distance between them had widened, Archer nocked and fired another arrow.</p><p>Within Rider, some kind of switch was thrown. Gritting his teeth, he glared at Archer with determined eyes. He ran straight towards the arrow Archer fired at him. Dodging the arrow by bending forward, he swung his spear in a sweeping slash\u2014but Archer dodged it.</p><p>A feeling of joy ran down his spine. Howling fiercely, he thrust his spear again and again. Archer dodged the continuous bullet-like spear attacks and nocked more arrows while skillfully controlling the distance between them.</p><p>It was impossible for a bowman to fight at close range, and if Rider could get him within the range of his spear, he would win. Rider was furious at his own shallowness for thinking that. His opponent was Chiron, the great sage who had taught not only Rider himself, but other heroes that were like shining stars, such as Heracles, Jason, Castor and Asclepius.</p><p>Getting close up only made them equal. From this point on, if Rider didn\u2019t muster everything he had into his attacks even further, his defeat would be inevitable\u2026!</p><p>Rider attacked Archer while thrusting, slashing and cleverly using feints with his spear. Archer avoided the attacks and occasionally defended with his bow, and furthermore, added in his own kicks and punches while shooting arrows whenever there was an opening.</p><p>Rider\u2019s body was greatly wounded by Archer\u2019s point-blank shots. Even with his body blessed by the gods, he was defenceless against the attacks of Archer who possessed the same [Divinity] as himself.</p><p>All of Rider\u2019s attacks were read, while on the other hand he couldn\u2019t read his opponent\u2019s attacks well. He somehow managed to maintain a balance in the fight with his natural sturdiness, but at this rate he would end up being driven into a corner.</p><p>Rider detached his thoughts from the battle before him for a moment. The reason his techniques were being read was because he had learned the basics from the very Archer in front of him. Everything from setting his stance to timing his thrusts to making sweeping slashes with his spear.</p><p>\u2014Don\u2019t be deceived.</p><p>It was true that Archer had taught him the basics. But Rider hadn\u2019t managed to keep winning since the time he threw himself into battle at a young age with just the basics. He had learned how to apply those techniques in a fight and how to survive in the midst of desperate battles. He had fought many heroes and sharpened his skills in the process.</p><p>How had he found a way to survive in every battle and critical situation? Yes, like that time he\u2014</p><p>Rider\u2019s movements changed. He stopped using basic techniques and trying to overwhelm his opponent with his overwhelming speed, and instead started changing his attacks with tricky moves.</p><p>Just when he seemed to let go of his spear, he kicked Archer and sent him flying using his own fatal weak point, his heel.</p><p>He then kicked up his spear as it fell and grabbed it once more in the air, and then fixed his aim and thrusted with it. The spear grazed against Archer\u2019s neck, causing blood to spout out.</p><p>\u201CKuh\u2026!!\u201D</p><p>Finding himself deeply cornered, Archer widened the distance between them. Rider waved his spear as if to say, \u201CHow\u2019s that?\u201D</p><p>As their eyes met, they both gave fearless smiles.</p><p>\u201C\u2014Hmm. So you really did earn your place as a Heroic Spirit.\u201D</p><p>\u201COf course. Unlike you who simply taught others, I ran through numerous battlefields, after all.\u201D</p><p>He had crossed blades, fought to the death, and exchanged friendships of the soul with many heroes. It was true that he had learned the basics from Chiron. But the corpses that Rider had piled up in battle\u2014were also another truth for him.</p><p>\u201CNo, I\u2019m really glad. It would have left a bad aftertaste in my mouth if I one-sidedly slaughtered a student of mine.\u201D</p><p>Archer smiled, and Rider smiled in return.</p><p>Rider had already thrown away his hesitation over fighting against his teacher. All that was left was the joy of a death match against a strong opponent.</p><p>Rider wavered over whether or not he should close the distance between them. It was standard tactics for him to charge at his enemy, but this might be a good time to throw away those standard tactics.</p><p>The main purpose of the spear he held was originally for throwing. It was a weapon that destroyed all defenses and pierced the chests of heroes. Chiron understood the fearsomeness of that spear better than anyone else. After all, he was the one who had given it away as a gift.</p><p>\u2014Now then, what to do?</p><p>Their gazes met. Both Rider of Red and Archer of Black planned their next moves while watching each other\u2019s every action.</p><p>Rider smiled, and Archer smiled in return. There was definitely a bond between them. Teacher and student, friend and friend who trusted each other from the bottom of their hearts. Even if they trampled on those feelings, vast \u2018joy\u2019 over facing each other that surpassed their other feelings definitely existed in their hearts.</p><hr><p>\u2014Rider of Black by no means had a tough or sturdy body. His stamina was just as could be imagined from his showy appearance.</p><p>\u201COwowow\u2026\u201D</p><p>Even so, he wasn\u2019t all that wounded by the damage from the fall and blasts of prana. That was probably because of\u2014the immense effect of his Noble Phantasm Luna Break Manual: Universal Magic Guide (Temporary Name).</p><p>\u201C\u2014Ah man, I give up. What should I do now?\u201D</p><p>His hippogriff wasn\u2019t dead. It had been injured, but since he sent it back right away, it would be able to recover. But he wouldn\u2019t be able to use it again in this battle.</p><p>When he thought back on it, he couldn\u2019t deny that he\u2019d been a bit too impatient. If he had completely released his hippogriff\u2019s power, he definitely could have gotten through that magic attack.</p><p>The reason he wasn\u2019t able to do that\u2014was because he had decided not to.</p><p>\u201CAh, geez!\u201D</p><p>He scratched his head. Had he hesitated and wavered this much during his life as well? He understood, at least in theory. He truly did understand that they had to win this battle. But his body wouldn\u2019t listen to what he said no matter what.</p><p>\u2014Ah, damn it. I really give up.</p><p>The image that faintly arose in his mind was that feeble hand seeking help. That person\u2019s voice had been thin and fleeting like a mayfly, trembling so frailly.</p><p>\u2014Because we are grave sinners who fatten ourselves by eating the weak like that.</p><p>The words \u2018It\u2019s too late for that\u2019 floated to his mind. Yes, it truly was too late for such sentiments. He was a monster who consumed prana just by manifesting. That was his true form. Who knew how many homunculi might have already died for his sake?</p><p>It truly was too late to start thinking like this. But even so, he wouldn\u2019t do it. He had decided that and resolved himself not to do it.</p><p>\u201C\u2026For now, let\u2019s look for the others.\u201D</p><p>He wanted the Holy Grail, and he wanted to exert himself for the sake of his comrades\u2014that much was fine. But the question of whether or not he could do that while following his heart had become a problem, obstructing his path.</p><p>\u201CHmm?\u201D</p><p>Claaaaaaang\u2014Rider frantically turned around at the high-pitched metallic sound. With bloodstains and dents here and there over its red frame, a conventional American sports car, a Chevrolet Corvette, plunged towards Rider while dodging golems and sending Dragon Tooth Warriors and homunculi flying.</p><p>\u201CNo way!?\u201D</p><p>Though he was shocked at the appearance of such an overly mismatched intruder on this traditional battlefield, Rider was still a Servant, and so he immediately took evasive maneuvers. Passing right by him, the Corvette\u2019s steering wheel was apparently spun with absurd force, as it came to a halt while spinning around as if it were swung by a giant.</p><p>As Rider watched the car in mute amazement, a clattering sound came from the driver\u2019s seat. The driver seemed to be trying to open the door, but perhaps due to having hit something, it appeared to be completely bent shut.</p><p>\u201CGah, how irritating!\u201D</p><p>Along with those words, the door was blown off.</p><p>Slender feet stepped out from the driver\u2019s seat. A girl, with her face dirtied black here and there, came out and hit the roof of the car with obvious displeasure. She wore a vivid red leather jacket and tube-top on her upper body, and cut jeans that exposed her thighs on her lower body. The door of the front passenger\u2019s seat was also similarly blown off a moment later, and a man slowly crawled out from the car. He was a giant of a man who wore black boots with black trousers, and his overall appearance truly made it seem like he lived a showy and destructive life totally unconnected to that of a proper and respectable person.</p><p>\u201CHey, Master, American cars aren\u2019t very sturdy, are they?\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2026The only vehicle that could withstand your driving is a tank. Rather, do you really have B rank in the Riding skill? Do you actually know how to drive? No, it\u2019s fine. There\u2019s no need to answer. This is just your nature. Yeah.\u201D</p><p>The man replied with a tired expression\u2026 In other words, she was a Servant, then? Rider of Black stiffened. It wasn\u2019t that he was surprised by the car. It was because he could tell that the Servant in front of him was incredibly powerful.</p><p>\u201CSaber\u2014of Red.\u201D</p><p>In response to Rider\u2019s murmur, Saber of Red flashed a fearless smile.</p><p>\u201CYo. You\u2019re a Black Servant\u2026 right?\u201D</p><p>\u201CBased on the profiles we were given, he\u2019s probably Rider. Now then, Saber. I leave the rest to you. I\u2019m outta here.\u201D</p><p>\u201CWhat\u2019s with that attitude, Master? Won\u2019t you stay and watch my valorous figure with your own eyes?\u201D</p><p>\u201CI would watch to my heart\u2019s content if we weren\u2019t in the middle of a battlefield\u2026\u201D</p><p>The large man looked over their surroundings while sighing. Not only were there Dragon Tooth Warriors, homunculi and golems everywhere, but he also caught glimpses of clashes emitting absurd amounts of prana between Servants here and there.</p><p>\u201CTch, it can\u2019t be helped. Go on, hurry up and run away!\u201D</p><p>\u201CRoger that. Then, well, make sure to come back alive.\u201D</p><p>Saber\u2019s Master headed over to the driver\u2019s seat, and leaving the door unattached, he forcibly drove off in the Chevrolet Corvette.</p><p>\u201CGood grief. Going off to fight without me, there\u2019s a limit even to joking around\u2026 Well, whatever. The lead actor arriving late on stage and the king joining the battle leisurely are part of how the world works.\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2014Huh, you\u2019re a king?\u201D</p><p>\u201CCorrect. If you surrender, I\u2019ll finish you with a quick and easy decapitation.\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2026No, that\u2019s a bit\u2026\u201D</p><p>Rider had already regained his footing after dodging the car. As he held his lance and prepared himself to fight, Saber of Red looked at him with a doubtful expression.</p><p>\u201CHey, hey, Rider. What about the steed you\u2019re supposed to be riding?\u201D</p><p>\u201CAh, I\u2019m having it rest for a little bit.\u201D</p><p>Saber of Red\u2019s expression suddenly became filled with killing intent. It appeared she couldn\u2019t hold herself back at the way Rider\u2019s attitude seemed to make light of her.</p><p>\u201CAaah? What can a Rider do without riding a steed? That just makes you an amateur on top of being a weak warrior.\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2014Well, I can\u2019t deny that, but\u2026\u201D</p><p>\u201CNo, you should deny it.\u201D</p><p>\u201CNo, no, I\u2019m a really honest guy, you see. Being forced to desperately kill the enemy is the role of a Servant, though.\u201D</p><p>\u201CTch\u2026 can\u2019t be helped then. By the way, Rider. Is it true that Saber of Black has fallen?\u201D</p><p>\u201CIt\u2019s true, it\u2019s true, it\u2019s seriously true.\u201D</p><p>\u201CWhat was the cause?\u201D</p><p>\u201CHmm\u2026\u2026 From an outsider\u2019s perspective, it would look like internal dissent. From his perspective, he just stuck to his beliefs, I guess?\u201D</p><p>\u201CUwah, that\u2019s so archaic. Was Saber of Black some kind of knight from the sticks? He kicked the bucket because he stuck to his beliefs? How ridiculous and stupid!\u201D</p><p>At those words, the atmosphere over the area completely changed. The one who changed was Rider of Black, and Saber of Red\u2019s expression also tightened in response.</p><p>\u201C\u2014I won\u2019t deny that either, you know? I won\u2019t deny it, but don\u2019t you dare talk about him like that. A swordswoman that looks like a delinquent at best has no right to talk about him!\u201D</p><p>\u201CHoh, you howl quite well. In that case\u2014\u201D</p><p>Saber of Red\u2019s appearance changed. The enormous amount of prana hidden inside her was released, and her clothing was exchanged for her armor and helm. In her hand was the wide and broad sword of a knight. It was truly a splendid outfit and equipment worthy of one called Saber.</p><p>\u201C\u2014The chatting ends here. I\u2019ll turn you into sword rust, you damn steed-less Rider!\u201D</p><p>\u201CMy, my, how scary~\u2026\u201D</p><p>The situation was unfavorable for him, and he was also overwhelmingly inferior to her in terms of sheer power as a Heroic Spirit. But even so, a fight between them was unavoidable.</p><p>\u2014Ah, this is bad. I might just die here.</p><p>That was his intuition as a knight rather than as a Heroic Spirit. The image of him dying easily and in obscurity if he fought her arose in his mind.</p><p>Even in the face of such a despairing reality, Rider of Black\u2019s expression and countenance didn\u2019t change at all. He prepared his stance with the lance he had pilfered from the knight Argalia in the past, and readied himself to tackle this all-or-nothing battle.</p><hr><p>A thick fog suddenly appeared in the midst of the battlefield. The homunculi within it were perplexed by it and stopped moving\u2014and then felt an impact like burning sparks from inside their noses.</p><p>As they collapsed and fell to their knees one after another, an innocent and laughing voice like that of a fairy resounded above their heads.</p><p>\u201CThere\u2019s lots, lots and lots and lots, everyone looks so yummy!\u201D</p><p>The homunculi concluded that it was an enemy and tried to ready their weapons, but they had no strength left. Even if they stopped breathing, they had already breathed in the air and their lungs hurt as if they were being pulled up with something like needles.</p><p>It was no good; they had to run away. Throwing away their weapons, they took two or three unsteady footsteps\u2014and fell down. They couldn\u2019t put any strength into their legs. Their heads throbbed as if gushing with insects, and their thoughts fell into messy confusion.</p><p>\u201CHe\u2026 lp\u2026\u201D</p><p>One of them muttered that while wheezing. And in response\u2026</p><p>\u201CUfufu, there are so many I don\u2019t know which to choose first. What should I do~\u266A\u201D</p><p>The cry for help was rejected by the innocent words of a young girl.</p><p>It hurt so much their eyes melted. The air they breathed scorched their lungs. The feeling of having their hearts corrode away was terrible.</p><p>Ah, it hurts, it hurts, it hurts, someone, please, help\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014!</p><p>\u201CThen, let\u2019s dig in!\u201D</p><p>Charming yet cruel words that were as sickly-sweet as sugar. In an instant, the internal organs which were essential for living were gouged out from them. The homunculi, who originally should have had a limited capacity to express emotions, screamed in terror.</p><p>But those screams were covered by the heavy fog and faded away without reaching anyone.</p><p>This fog was truly the stomach of a monster, a space of absolute murder. You died just by being inside it, and even if you tried running away or resisting, you still died. The one who ruled this space was a serial killer\u2014\u2018Jack the Ripper\u2019.</p><p>\u201CThanks for the meal.\u201D</p><p>Night and fog. Always taking the first move without exception, she continued increasing her victims without ever being questioned by anyone\u2014</p><p>The battlefield was already in a state that could only be loved by the god of chaos.</p><p>Arrows of light had fallen down like rain as the opening attack, and a chariot pulled by three steeds had run through the skies. Stakes of death gushed forth one after another in swarms while a spearman clad in flames attacked them. A bowman who seemed to have become one with the forest challenged a mounted warrior who had gotten off his chariot, while a beast-like bow-woman ran about the battlefield and turned a mad warrior, who continued smiling even while being reduced to a disgusting lump of meat, into a hedgehog full of arrows. Another mad warrior continued rampaging without ever running out of breath as if she were a Perpetual Motion Machine, while a mediator who seemed like a monster maintained his calm as he fought her. Stone giants, homunculi whose expressions never changed as they wrecked destruction, Dragon Tooth Warriors who pushed forward no matter how much they were smashed apart. A swordswoman who looked like lump of steel was opposed by a lovely-looking mounted warrior wielding a lance. An ancient queen had launched a surprise attack with her floating fortress in order to oppose magi who had shut themselves inside a sturdy castle, while a serial killer hid herself within the fog\u2014</p><p>The blood of homunculi dyed the grass-covered plains scarlet, and the rubble of golems and Dragon Tooth Warriors fell and piled up everywhere like snow.</p><p>The word [peace] no longer existed in this place where everyone fought and tried to kill one another.</p><p>The Great Holy Grail War was speeding up more and more, coiling around and submerging those who got close to it like liquefied sludge.</p><p>And the ones who appeared on this hellish land of chaos were the supreme referee of the Great Holy Grail War\u2014Ruler, also known as Jeanne d\u2019Arc, and one other person who accompanied her.</p><p>Her companion was the homunculus who called himself Sieg.</p><h2 id="chapter-3" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#chapter-3" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Chapter 3</h2><hr><p>\u2014Now that she thought about it, she had felt that something was \u2018wrong\u2019 from the beginning.</p><p>A large battle consisting of seven Servants versus seven Servants. It was true that this was a state of emergency that warranted summoning Ruler.</p><p>But Ruler couldn\u2019t help but feel that this wasn\u2019t the true objective assigned to her.</p><p>Something inside her chest was urging her on. It was closer to a sense of impending danger than a sense of duty.</p><p>Something that couldn\u2019t be undone was occurring. The instant she saw that giant floating fortress, Ruler\u2019s uneasiness reached its peak.</p><p>Most likely, a large-scale battle was about to start between the Black and Red camps. Ruler would be fine with whichever of them won as long as they asked a correct and proper wish of the Holy Grail. At first, she had felt relieved on this point.</p><p>That was because the Masters in both camps were magi. Magi may be those who are disconnected from human morals, but at the same time they wouldn\u2019t try to grant a purely corrupt wish. The only thing they would wish for is to reach the Root, or perhaps something else related to magecraft\u2014but regardless, almost everything they might possibly wish for was right and proper.</p><p>However, she felt doubts start to form inside her when the Red camp attacked her. The way the Black camp tried to bring her over to their side was fine. That was, in the end, only an act for the sake of achieving victory in the Great Holy Grail War.</p><p>The problem was the Red camp. Ruler could not think of any reason for why they would attempt to kill her. The demerits of it exceeded the merits. And now the Red camp was attacking the Fortress of Millennia, the stronghold of the Black camp, with a floating fortress.</p><p>Ruler had crossed the mountain along with Sieg and took a roundabout path around the fortress\u2019 outer circumference. When they came out from the forest where Rider and Archer of Red had trespassed and fought a fierce battle, they arrived in the middle of the battle. Homunculi and golems were clashing against Dragon Tooth Warriors, and were performing the gruesome act of killing each other. Spells exploded like cannon fire here and there, while battles between what seemed to be Servants were quickly changing the surrounding area into empty plots of land.</p><p>While gazing upon this gruesome battlefield, Ruler focused on the floating fortress that likely belonged to the Red camp\u2026 That thing was far too abnormal even among the many Holy Grail Wars that had occurred in history. The ability to fly itself was a simple piece of magecraft that even ordinary magi could use, let alone Servants.</p><p>But that thing\u2014was on an entirely different level. There weren\u2019t many who were capable of accomplishing feats on such a scale even among magi from the Age of Gods.</p><p>\u201CListen well, Sieg-kun. From here on, I have to cross this battlefield and meet with \u2018someone\u2019 from the other camp.\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2026Why?\u201D</p><p>\u201CThere\u2019s \u2018someone\u2019 I need to meet on this battlefield. I don\u2019t know who it is, or even whether it\u2019s a Servant, Master or someone else entirely. But I must meet with them.\u201D</p><p>Though the homunculus tilted his head in puzzlement, there was a mysteriously strong persuasiveness in Ruler\u2019s words. It wasn\u2019t because her tone was filled with confidence; rather, she was whispering to him quite anxiously. And yet, he still caught a glimpse of a strong will in her that wouldn\u2019t be stopped no matter what.</p><p>\u201CI see,\u201D the homunculus said in understanding. The reason she had been idolized and followed by soldiers in the past wasn\u2019t because she displayed a strong will with strong words. Her words weren\u2019t for the sake of coercing others.</p><p>Her words were simply for the sake of communicating her will, saying [I\u2019m going].</p><p>\u201CI think that\u2019s dangerous, but if that\u2019s your will, it can\u2019t be helped.\u201D</p><p>Saying that, he placed a hand on the hilt of his sword without hesitation. It was, in other words, a declaration of his intention to go with her as well. Even if they had only known each other for a short time, he had quickly come to understand Ruler. The homunculus who had given himself the name Sieg had the kind of personality where, after deciding something even once, he would follow through with his decision till the very end.</p><p>If she told him to not come and went off by herself\u2026 he would probably just follow after her even so. That would be dangerous. He would definitely be viewed as an enemy by the Red camp. And there was no way to know whether or not the magi of the Black camp might react if they saw him as well.</p><p>But Sieg had a different objective from her on this battlefield.</p><p>\u201CWhat do you intend to do?\u201D</p><p>\u201CLeaving aside my comrades who are fighting on the front lines, I might have a chance at having a short talk with the others who are on stand-by in the rear. Depending on the situation, I intend to talk with them and ask for the release of the other homunculi within the castle. After that\u2014\u201D</p><p>\u201CAfter that?\u201D</p><p>Sieg cast his eyes down apologetically and murmured.</p><p>\u201C\u2026No, I\u2019d like to meet with Rider, but there\u2019s no telling whether or not we\u2019d be able to meet. Meeting him in this situation would also cause him too much trouble.\u201D</p><p>\u201CI don\u2019t think she would be troubled by it, though\u2026\u201D</p><p>Either way, Ruler judged that having Sieg accompany her was the most appropriate course of action.</p><p>\u201CIn any case, please come with me then. But\u2026 listen, at least avoid fighting any Servants, okay? If you run into trouble with any magi of the Black camp, use my name. If you do that, you might be able to avoid being immediately executed by them.\u201D</p><p>\u201CThank you.\u201D</p><p>\u2014At that instant, she could somehow intuitively tell that her decision was truly correct under God\u2019s will. That was how deeply she felt doubts carved within her heart. Just what could a mere homunculus like him do on a battlefield ruled by Servants? \u2026He could never become a swordsman like Saber just by having a sword. But she didn\u2019t have the time and liberty to wrack her brain over his fate.</p><p>Because right now, she had to plunge into this chaotic battlefield and search for something fatally dangerous.</p><p>\u201CAll right!\u201D</p><p>Lightly slapping her cheeks with her hands, Ruler summoned a flag into her hand and grasped it tightly. It was a battle flag, the holy flag that had always been by her side in life. \u201CDon\u2019t fall behind,\u201D she whispered to Sieg over her shoulder.</p><p>\u201C\u2014Then, let\u2019s go!\u201D</p><p>Ruler charged onto the battlefield. Sieg also ran after her from right behind her.</p><p>An absurd number of Dragon Tooth soldiers immediately rushed at them. Going as far as to even ignore the homunculi and golems they were fighting, the Dragon Tooth Warriors all focused on Ruler.</p><p>\u201CJust like I thought\u2026!\u201D</p><p>Ruler swung the flag with her hand and smashed the Dragon Tooth Warriors with it one by one. Ruler\u2019s basic motto was to avoid doing anything that directly affected the course of the Holy Grail War, but she couldn\u2019t just stand by and do nothing if they openly treated her as an enemy.</p><p>Along with a sharp yell that seemed to cut through the battlefield, Ruler dashed towards the location of her objective.</p><hr><p>Suddenly, Shirou stopped moving. He clicked his tongue and jumped backwards with a bitter expression.</p><p>\u201CCaster, we\u2019re withdrawing. That girl has \u2018noticed\u2019 it faster than I thought. This must\u2026 be due to some kind of Revelation skill on her part.\u201D</p><p>Berserker of Black was bewildered by Shirou\u2019s sudden widening of the distance between them, and she decided to just wait and see what he did for the time being.</p><p>\u201CI did hear that those chosen for the Ruler class are mostly saints due to their impartial judgement. So she\u2019s one of those types, huh?\u201D</p><p>Caster of Red shrugged in a sarcastic manner.</p><p>\u201CSo it seems\u2026 This is a critical situation, Caster. If she denounces me, the situation will turn extremely chaotic. No, to put it in your words, it would become uninteresting.\u201D</p><p>\u201CTrying to forcibly stretch out parts that aren\u2019t very exciting is a sign of poor writing. That being the case, let\u2019s end the story of my Master of the battlefield for the time being.\u201D</p><p>\u201CYes, let\u2019s withdraw. \u2014Well, to look at it another way: it\u2019s good enough that we managed to weather through this. Very soon, everything will change into a situation that even Ruler won\u2019t be able to do anything about. And it seems I really am in the right, since I managed to avoid \u2018death\u2019 by a paper-thin distance.\u201D</p><p>Saying that, Shirou stabbed Black Keys into the ground, forming a wall in front of Berserker of Black as she tried to step forward. He and Caster then began withdrawing from the battlefield at full speed.</p><p>\u201CMaster. That damn Ruler is pushing her way straight towards you without faltering. Hurry! The Dragon Tooth Warriors can\u2019t hold her back!\u201D</p><p>\u201CI know!\u201D</p><p>Slightly impatient, Shirou quickly shelved away the warning and increased his speed further\u2026 Within the dark forest where there was no light\u2014with not even the moonlight shining well through the trees\u2014Shirou ran at full speed without paying any heed to the near-absolute darkness. His speed was, to put it in a single phrase, beyond abnormal. Easily exceeding sixty kilometers per hour, Shirou simply ran and ran.</p><p>\u2026However, there was someone chasing after him in hot pursuit. Seeing her over his shoulder, Shirou widened his eyes slightly.</p><p>\u201CBerserker of Black\u2026 To think you would chase after me.\u201D</p><p>The instant she saw the wall of Black Keys, Berserker decided to pursue the Master known as Shirou. It was due to something that could be called intuition, which should have had no connection with an artificial human like her.</p><p>Caules had told her to search for other Servants elsewhere if the Master and Servant she faced ran away, but she had refused the order with one of her usual moans.</p><p>In any case\u2014though she herself didn\u2019t really understand what it was that bugged her.</p><p>She felt that it was bad to let this man escape here. That Master was definitely abnormal. No, in the first place, was he really a Master?</p><p>If she were to say what he was based on the feeling running down her skin, it would be\u2014</p><p>\u201C\u2014\u2014uu!?\u201D</p><p>As if stitching her brief moment of thought, four blades shot right at her. The man had apparently thrown Black Keys as he ran away without even looking back at her.</p><p>Berserker of Black instantly grasped the best option here. That is, she ignored them.</p><p>She didn\u2019t feel pain; what she received was only damage as a numerical value. That wasn\u2019t a big deal either. In the end, the blades compiled out of prana possessed meager physical destructive power and weren\u2019t sufficient to defeat a Servant.</p><p>Still, receiving a direct hit from them might slow her down and eat up a little time\u2014If it were anyone besides her, that is.</p><p>\u201CaaaaaaAAAAAAAAAiiiiaaaaaaaa!!\u201D</p><p>With a scream that could make a human\u2019s heart shudder, she released even more speed. She didn\u2019t pay any attention to the direct hits from the Black Keys. Eventually, the prana of the blades dispersed and the hilts slipped off her body, while her wounds immediately closed up.</p><p>\u201C\u2014Unbelievable.\u201D</p><p>Looking over his shoulder, Shirou didn\u2019t know whether to be impressed or stunned. If she had knocked down the Black Keys, then it would have been understandable. If she had held her ground, it would have been convenient for him. But to think that she hadn\u2019t slowed down at all even after several direct hits\u2026!</p><p>\u201CI believe the name of her creator was Doctor Frankenstein, correct? With just what kind of design did he make such a monster?\u201D</p><p>Shirou smiled bitterly at Caster of Red\u2019s words\u2014and then suddenly thought of a crafty plan.</p><p>\u201CCaster, please materialize yourself. I have need of your \u2018theatrical troupe\u2019.\u201D</p><p>Caster instantly materialized along with a single book in his hand.</p><p>\u201COh, I see, I see! Then let\u2019s have her meet the man she both dearly loves and hates! [Life\u2019s but a walking shadow; a poor player. That struts and frets his hour upon the stage!]\u201D</p><p>Caster cried out those words loudly, and then an impossible miracle appeared within the dark forest. Once he confirmed its appearance, Caster went back into spiritual form in order to fall behind Shirou as he ran.</p><p>And then Berserker of Black, who was chasing after Shirou, met it there.</p><p>\u201C\u2026uu\u2026.!?\u201D</p><p>Confusion, that was all she felt. A man who shouldn\u2019t be here spoke to her with a gentle expression that was truly unlike him. In life, he had never once shown such a smile to her.</p><p>\u201C\u2014Stop.\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2026aa, aaa\u2026\u201D</p><p>Berserker, who had not halted even after receiving direct hits from the Black Key\u2014and had even accelerated\u2014came to a stop. She wasn\u2019t good at showing her emotions, but her eyes had widened due to shock and wonder.</p><p>The person in front of her was Doctor Frankenstein. The one who created, her father, the one who she should hate, her\u2014</p><p>Why? How?</p><p>Berserker of Black wasn\u2019t shocked by the fact that he was here. What shocked her was simply his gentle smile. Ever since she first opened her eyes, her father\u2019s expression was twisted with hate and disgust. From his mouth which she thought would give her words of blessing, only words of insult and abuse had come out.</p><p>It was an event that occurred on a lonely November night\u2014</p><p>\u201CIt\u2019s a failure, a failure, a failure, a failure, a failure!\u201D</p><p>\u201CWhat the hell, this is just a worthless doll puppet!\u201D</p><p>\u201CIt has no emotion! Did the lines not connect!? Even the tear glands are no good! Forget the fact that it isn\u2019t the perfect maiden Eve, it isn\u2019t even human!\u201D</p><p>\u2014Ah, it seems I was a failed creation.</p><p>What saddened her wasn\u2019t the fact that she had been judged a failed creation. It was that her father, as he fell into a furious frenzy and tore at his own hair, was far too pitiful.</p><p>\u201CI\u2019m sorry, Father. I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m sorry for being a failed creation. I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019ll correct myself. I\u2019ll properly correct myself. So please don\u2019t be angry. Don\u2019t be angry, don\u2019t be angry, don\u2019t be angry\u2014\u201D</p><p>Though she tried to cry, for some reason, she couldn\u2019t. It appeared that her function to shed tears also didn\u2019t work. Every time she tried to comfort him as he drowned himself in alcohol, he would push her away, hit her, and kick her.</p><p>It didn\u2019t hurt. Just that, every time she was hit\u2026 her heart tightened terribly, for reasons she didn\u2019t understand.</p><p>The girl felt sorrow for her father, who continued doing nothing but lament in regret day after day. She wracked her brain to figure out what she should do. What could she do to comfort her father? Resolving herself, she decided to go out and leave their residence.</p><p>\u2014She found various things outside.</p><p>The green trees, the transparent ponds of water, the shining sun. If she brought these back with her, her father might also become happy. As she thought that, she was suddenly attacked by a stray dog. It had probably reacted to the rotten smell that wafted from her clothes.</p><p>When the dog bit her arm, she tore off its neck. In that instant, she received a revelation.</p><p>\u201CAh, pretty. Pretty. This is pretty. Since I don\u2019t have this inside me, it\u2019s surely pretty\u2014\u201D</p><p>She split open its abdomen and found even more fresh entrails. These were things that she didn\u2019t have. So she thought they were pretty. So she decided to bring it back and show it to her father.</p><p>Pink entrails were pretty, and fresh red blood was beautiful. She never once thought they were ugly or dirty. She didn\u2019t think the stench of blood was unpleasant either.</p><p>\u2026The instant she showed it all to him, her relationship with her father was decisively snapped apart. Because, not only was she a failed creation, she was also clearly a hideous monster.</p><p>A life-form that feels blood is beautiful and is intoxicated by entrails\u2014is what people call a monster.</p><p>\u201CNo, that\u2019s not it, that\u2019s not it. Really, that\u2019s not it. I\u2019m normal. I just wanted to make you happy, Father.\u201D</p><p>Her father ran away from her in fear, never showing her a smile right till the very end. Instead, he left her an absolute curse at the end.</p><p>\u201CYou are a monster! A mad monster!\u201D</p><p>\u2026So, she thought to become normal. She decided to obtain reason and understand common sense. And she decided to have a mate. Because normal humans had families. Now that she had been denied by her father, she needed a mate no matter what.</p><p>But that was not something that could be obtained by wishing for it. Nor was it something that could be obtained by stealing it away. Even so, she kidnapped many men. But none of them could be her mate.</p><p>So she decided to ask her father for one.</p><p>\u201CPlease make someone who will love me, please make someone who will look at me. If I\u2019m supposed to be the perfect maiden Eve, you should have a responsibility to make the original human Adam as well\u2014\u201D</p><p>Her father refused, and the girl was driven mad by anger and sorrow. Her anger was due to her father\u2019s betrayal. Her sorrow\u2014was because she understood that she would be alone until the day she died.</p><p>She just wanted someone to love her. She just wanted to love someone. She just wanted to know love\u2026 No, if even that wish couldn\u2019t be granted, she thought to herself that she at least wanted to be hated. She chased after her father, accused him, was irritated by how he ran from her, and killed his family as a result. Even so, her father ran, ran, just ran away from her.</p><p>Right until his last moments, he just continued to run away from her. He didn\u2019t even think of revenge against the one who had broken his heart and killed the people he loved.</p><p>\u201CWhy won\u2019t you hate me? Why won\u2019t you look at me?\u201D</p><p>\u2026The girl threw herself into hellfire along with her father. And thus ended the story of Frankenstein. All that was left behind was the legend of a freakish, hideous monster.</p><p>And now, the father who had betrayed her was right before her eyes. He was looking at her with a warm expression. It was a moment she had never seen even in her wildest dreams.</p><p>\u201C\u2014Yes, that\u2019s good. Stop fighting. I didn\u2019t create you for the sake of something like that.\u201D</p><p>\u201Cuu, aa\u2026\u201D</p><p>The doctor held out his hand to her head\u2014it appeared he was trying to do what a parent often did to their child. In other words, he was going to pat her head. That was what she had so eagerly wished for.</p><p>She had wanted to be loved. She had wanted someone to love her. She had wanted to love someone.</p><p>That wished was about to be fulfilled.</p><p>But.</p><p>But that was precisely why\u2026</p><p>\u201CuuuuaaaaaaaaaaaaauaaaaaAAAAaaaaaaaAAAAAA\u2014\u2014\u2014!!\u201D</p><p>Berserker fell into a furious frenzy. No, it wasn\u2019t something as simple as a frenzy. With unconcealed killing intent as well, she struck the flank of the man who allegedly looked like Doctor Frankenstein with Bridal Chest: Maiden\u2019s Chastity.</p><p>\u201CWhat, are you\u2026!?\u201D</p><p>Don\u2019t speak, don\u2019t speak, don\u2019t speak, don\u2019t speak, don\u2019t speak, don\u2019t speak, don\u2019t speak, don\u2019t speak, don\u2019t speak, don\u2019t speak, don\u2019t speak, don\u2019t speak, don\u2019t speak, don\u2019t speak, don\u2019t speak, don\u2019t speak, don\u2019t speak, don\u2019t speak, don\u2019t speak, don\u2019t speak, don\u2019t speak, don\u2019t speak, don\u2019t speak, don\u2019t speak, don\u2019t speak, don\u2019t speak, don\u2019t speak, don\u2019t speak, don\u2019t speak, don\u2019t speak, don\u2019t speak, don\u2019t speak, don\u2019t speak, don\u2019t speak, don\u2019t speak, don\u2019t speak, don\u2019t speak, don\u2019t speak, don\u2019t speak, don\u2019t speak, don\u2019t speak, don\u2019t speak, don\u2019t speak, don\u2019t speak, don\u2019t speak, don\u2019t speak, speak, don\u2019t speak, speak, don\u2019t speak, speak, don\u2019t speak, speak, don\u2019t speak, don\u2019t speak, don\u2019t speak, don\u2019t speak, don\u2019t speak, don\u2019t speak, don\u2019t speak\u2014!</p><p>As blood gushed out from the man\u2019s body, she hit him once more in the face. His face was crushed like a popped balloon.</p><p>\u201CaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaauAAAAAAAAaaaaaaaaUuaaaa!!\u201D</p><p>She screamed and screamed as she swung her mace at his entire body. The man was no longer even twitching; he simply surrendered himself to the overwhelming violence.</p><p>Eventually, even the certainty that a person had been there in the first place disappeared. At last, Berserker of Black stopped moving.</p><p>\u201Caa\u2026 aaa\u2026\u201D</p><p>He had spoken the words she wanted to hear when she didn\u2019t want to hear them. She knew the truth. She already understood that this was probably some kind of magecraft created by Caster.</p><p>The corpse faded away. What she had smashed into tiny pieces seemed to be some kind of simple puppet. The best proof of that were the wood chips scattered all over her.</p><p>But still. Ah, but still.</p><p>Once again, I hurt someone precious even while thinking they were precious to me\u2014!</p><p>But just as the artificial girl collapsed to her knees, extremely cool-headed words entered her ears.</p><p>\u2018\u2014I order you with this Command Spell. Berserker, calm down.\u2019</p><p>Instantly, all the wailing, rage, uneasiness and despair disappeared within her head.</p><p>\u201Caa\u2026 aa\u2026?\u201D</p><p>\u2018Good. Have you calmed down, Berserker? They\u2019ve already escaped, so let\u2019s end it here for the time being. There are plenty of other places where you should be fighting. Do you understand?\u2019</p><p>Berserker of Black felt logic spread through her and was gripped by a reassuring feeling.</p><p>That\u2019s right; it was just as her Master said. There were still plenty of places where she ought to be fighting. She had openly laid bare her emotions. Ah, how embarrassing. Her Master\u2019s evaluation of her had probably lowered\u2014</p><p>\u2018\u2026Don\u2019t worry about it. You fought well. What happened just now couldn\u2019t be helped. That Master is simply abnormal. In any case, our maximum-priority objective right now is to kill the Red Servants. Don\u2019t forget that.\u2019</p><p>It seemed her Master hadn\u2019t lowered his opinion of her at all.</p><p>Nodding in understanding, Berserker of Black ran out of the forest. But even after now regaining her calm, somewhere in her thought circuits, she felt regret for letting that Master slip away.</p><p>Caules felt the same way. He had merely seen him from a distance through his familiars, but even so, he clearly felt that Master\u2019s oddness\u2026 his abnormality.</p><p>But he was still just a Master. Shaking off the chill he felt, Caules devoted his attention to directing Berserker.</p><p>Did he regret having to use a Command Spell? \u2026No. Caules felt confidence in his decision. Berserker\u2019s turmoil had been staggering. It was only natural, after having killed her father, whom she both fervently adored and hated. It was possible that it would have lasting effects on her later on. He didn\u2019t think his decision to use a Command Spell to wash it all away at once was wrong.</p><p>\u2026At the very least, he\u2019d think it was more worthwhile than using one to force her to activate her Noble Phantasm or to stop her from doing so herself.</p><hr><p>Explosions, shrieks, screams, spell chanting\u2014all these noises mixed together and became one upon the battlefield, jumping into Ruler\u2019s ears. Those who wished for it, those who didn\u2019t, and even those who didn\u2019t even know the word \u2018wish\u2019 took no notice of it, while Ruler ran even faster across the battlefield.</p><p>\u201C\u2026!\u201D</p><p>Within the huge floating fortress\u2014there was one Servant. The reason she could tell that even from down here was due to the beams of light being shot down from the fortress along with overwhelming killing intent. The Servant there concentrated all that destructive power sufficient to destroy a castle onto Ruler alone.</p><p>But Ruler hoisted her flag without panicking. Her Magic Resistance was EX rank. As such, she who was a saint couldn\u2019t be wounded even by magecraft from the Age of Gods. However, this resistance only turned spells away from her. In other words, it didn\u2019t receive and negate it.</p><p>\u201CSieg-kun, get away!\u201D</p><p>Sieg immediately reacted to those words. After getting away from that spot with a roll across the ground, he saw Ruler disappear in an instant under a beam of light that fell from the sky.</p><p>\u201CRuler!\u201D</p><p>He reflexively shouted\u2014but his voice stopped midway. He was speechless. Being magus right from birth, he understood. The pillar of light that had fallen from the sky just now was a lightning strike filled with malice. With power equal to that of a dropped bomb, even the Saber class which tended to have the highest Magic Resistance wouldn\u2019t be able to just shrug it off.</p><p>But she\u2014avoided it. Though \u2018avoided\u2019 was not the right way to describe it. That spell attack, which totally suppressed, not a single spot, but an entire area, had been diverted away without injuring her.</p><p>The lightning strike, which should have had a will of its own, had lost its malice. Instead, the lightning attacked the surrounding area.</p><p>If she hadn\u2019t called out to him just now, Sieg also would have probably been caught up in the attack. Surrounding her had been the wreckage of golems along with Dragon Tooth Warriors that had been trying to attack her, but now\u2026 every last one of them had completely vanished.</p><p>Not a single piece of rubbish remained\u2026 If she hadn\u2019t called out to him, he might have been reduced to dust that as well.</p><p>\u201CThis is\u2026 the Servant of the eighth class.\u201D</p><p>While murmuring that, he looked to the sky. Though Ruler\u2019s abnormal Magic Resistance was surprising, what was even more shocking was the feat of magecraft just now. Such a spell that was equal to a bomber attack could only be magecraft from the Age of Gods.</p><p>It was probably Caster of Red. That floating fortress was likely the Noble Phantasm or something of a Red Servant. At the very least, such a feat was impossible for a modern magus.</p><p>Either way, it still hadn\u2019t managed to kill Ruler. Both Sieg and Ruler though that the Servant casting the spells from the floating fortress would therefore give up.</p><p>But\u2014</p><p>\u201C!?\u201D</p><p>They were both shocked at the same time. Without caring at all about the fact that their attacks had been diverted, the Servant above continued firing more spell blasts one after another. They were doing a meaningless act\u2026 No, there was meaning to it. This was simply an attempt to buy time. And the means that accompanied it were just too overwhelming.</p><p>\u201CKuh\u2026!\u201D</p><p>Ruler looked at Sieg. Yes, Ruler could still move, but Sieg would always have to get away from her. Sieg spoke without wavering.</p><p>\u201C\u2026Go on ahead. Either way, I have to meet the people I must meet.\u201D</p><p>\u201CI understand.\u201D</p><p>She didn\u2019t wish him luck in battle. The battlefield was not something that could be survived just by having luck. If she had to say anything, it should be a prayer that he would not encounter a Servant.</p><p>But that was impossible. Because he said he would meet with the people he must meet. The first ones he had to meet were the homunculi. Saving them was one of Sieg\u2019s objectives.</p><p>And there was one more person he had to meet. A Servant\u2014Rider of Black, Astolfo. His wish to meet with this Servant wasn\u2019t out of a clear sense of purpose. Perhaps he would just meet him because he wanted to meet him. Ruler thought that was a little charming.</p><p>However, going to meet Rider meant encountering other Servants. He held a sword in his hand, and his body was clearly filled with fighting spirit.</p><p>Therefore, he would probably be viewed as an enemy by the Red camp. By all rights, she should stop him, but he would probably never stop. Even though he knew that meeting Rider was a futile and meaningless act and that he would be betraying Rider\u2019s prayer for him, Sieg would still go meet him.</p><p>Ruler began running. She sensed that the \u2018someone\u2019 she was after was getting further away, so she increased her speed more and more. She abandoned even dealing with the slashes from the Dragon Tooth Warriors and simply ran.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t that she wanted to stop this war. As long as the war between the two camps was tuned correctly, Ruler had no objections to it at all.</p><p>But a strong sense of uneasiness that made her teeth clench and grate urged her to cut across this battlefield. She had to meet them, she had to meet the \u2018someone\u2019 who was getting further away.</p><p>And a Red Servant was intentionally obstructing her. They piled up Dragon Tooth Warriors like a mountain and simply created a wall to block her.</p><p>\u201C\u2014You\u2019re in my way!\u201D</p><p>Of course, even the delay of having to deal with a minor obstruction like this was precious time to Ruler. She aimed the tip of her flag at a single point and broke through the wall without pausing.</p><p>And then, she waved the holy water she carried and displayed the location of each Servant just as she did before. She knew that the Black Servants were not a problem right now, and so she focused her attention on only the locations of the Red Servants.</p><p>Mere Dragon Tooth Warriors were far from effective at stalling for time against her. But Servants were another matter. First, she definitely had to avoid being chased after by any of them.</p><p>Ruler swiftly came up with a route that did not come into contact with any Red Servants, and ran to follow that path. She felt a chill swell up inside her increasingly as time passed.</p><p>And then, the worst possible match-up barged onto her route as if to block her.</p><hr><p>This is fine. Sieg breathed a sigh of relief as he watched Ruler leave. She had her own objective, and it wasn\u2019t something he should hinder. Her objective was more noble and important. Unlike his.</p><p>There was a mountain of things he should be doing instead of thinking as he ran. Dragon Tooth Warriors were coming at him, and though a Servant would be able to beat one with a single blow, they were enemies that he himself had to handle very cautiously one by one.</p><p>Thrusting at them with his sword had little effect, so he charged forward to collide with one and glued himself against it, and then vigorously bisected it from the waist. The Dragon Tooth Warrior crumbled in the blink of an eye. He cut off the arm of another Dragon Tooth Warrior that stepped forward from his flank and softly touched it with one hand.</p><p>\u201CStra\xDFe \\ gehen.\u201D</p><p>He activated his Magic Circuits\u2014investigated, analyzed and sympathized with the material properties of what he touched\u2014and worked out the necessary logic to reverse it all and destroy it.</p><p>Instantly, his palm released a spell that changed the bones of the Dragon Tooth Warrior into the optimal breakable material. Sieg\u2019s magecraft required that he analyze his target by touching it, so it had basically zero ranged capability. However, its destructive power was immense.</p><p>The Dragon Tooth Warrior was turned into a pile of miniscule pieces.</p><p>\u201CRider!\u201D</p><p>His shout was completely swept away in the clatter of the battlefield. While running, he carefully examined the situation of the battlefield. The places where there were noticeably violent clashes of prana were probably where battles between Servants were occurring.</p><p>\u201CWhat are you doing?\u201D</p><p>When Sieg turned around at that voice, he found two battle-type homunculi looking at him with gazes containing reproach. \u2018What are you doing, you must fight too\u2019\u2014that was probably what they meant.</p><p>\u201CEnough, enough, stop fighting you guys.\u201D</p><p>At Sieg\u2019s words, the two homunculi exchanged confused glances.</p><p>\u201C\u2026If you want to die, I won\u2019t stop you. But, if you want to live, go back. Go back and save our fellow homunculi. Both the ones who are being exploited for their prana and the ones who aren\u2019t. You guys aren\u2019t bound to anything.\u201D</p><p>\u201CBut\u2014that\u2019s going against our orders.\u201D</p><p>\u201CThat\u2019s right\u2014the order we were given was to fight and defeat the enemy Servants and their followers.\u201D</p><p>\u201CThat order is impossible. You guys should also understand that well. In the first place, what obligation do you have to obey it?\u201D</p><p>At Sieg\u2019s words, the two homunculi once more exchanged glances. As if to cut into their conversation, a Dragon Tooth Warrior ran at them and swung its sword at Sieg.</p><p>Sieg swiftly unsheathed Rider of Black\u2019s sword and slashed at it from its flank to its neck. The other two homunculi joined with him and crushed the skull and feet of the Dragon Tooth Warrior with their halberds.</p><p>Sieg spoke once more.</p><p>\u201CDo you want to die or live? \u2026We have to choose one of them.\u201D</p><p>That was his last warning. One of the homunculi followed his request and returned to the castle. The other one decided to obey his orders even so, and returned once more to the battlefield.</p><p>This is fine, Sieg thought. If given a choice, homunculi couldn\u2019t help but choose. Their thought processes weren\u2019t so dim that they couldn\u2019t understand it, after all.</p><p>As servants from birth, the option to rebel strangely never came to their minds. But it was a different matter if they were given the choice.</p><p>He had merely given the homunculi in the surrounding area within the rear lines the choice. They would each choose their own path. Sieg wasn\u2019t responsible for what they did after that\u2014or rather, he thought that he shouldn\u2019t be responsible for them afterwards.</p><p>Now he just had to search for Rider of Black. He was so clumsy that he hadn\u2019t thought of what he would do after finding him. Rider of Black would probably lament that of all things, this was the first thing Sieg chose to do with his new freedom.</p><p>\u2014Even so. Even so, there were feelings that maddeningly drove him. There were things he wanted to do and couldn\u2019t forget, and he didn\u2019t have the resolution to seek things like peaceful, ordinary days.</p><p>There were things much, much more precious to him than such a pipe dream. He wanted to save his comrades. He wanted to meet Rider of Black again and repay him.</p><p>He didn\u2019t care if it was useless. Even though he knew full well that Rider hadn\u2019t wished for him to do such a thing and might lament Sieg\u2019s decision. He simply\u2014chose this.</p><p>Yes, since that was what he had chosen to do, he couldn\u2019t turn back. That was the worst thing he could do.</p><p>He took a deep breath. He was terrified; even though he hadn\u2019t been frightened at all when he fell right to the brink of death before. When he thought he might be letting go of what he had temporarily obtained\u2014he couldn\u2019t help but feel terrified.</p><p>\u2026But his heartbeat was stirring up something inside him.</p><p>Gritting his teeth, he tightly clenched his shudderingly cold hands several times. I can do this, he thought, hoped, and prayed\u2014and took his first step forward.</p><hr><p>The battle between the two Lancers was still going on neck-and-neck.</p><p>While they were both Lancers, their fighting styles were completely different. Lancer of Black stabbed stakes at his enemy just by directing them with a single finger, while Lancer of Red aimed to directly smash his enemy with the spear he held in his hands.</p><p>Lancer of Black would throw stakes while maintaining his distance, and Lancer of Red would close the distance between them while breaking every one of those stakes. The battle was a repetition of this sequence.</p><p>Mysteries are negated by stronger mysteries. In that regard, Lancer of Red greatly exceeded Lancer of Black. Based on his strength in life, the great hero Karna was truly exceptional.</p><p>In order to send him to his grave, the thunder god Indra had no other choice but to devise an intricate scheme. Karna was the best and proudest spearman who hadn\u2019t fallen to the ground even after being betrayed by all his allies.</p><p>\u2014However, even against such a hero, Lancer of Black didn\u2019t fall before his attacks.</p><p>Unlike Lancer of Red, whose existence in actual history was unclear, Lancer of Black\u2014Vlad III was a hero who had actually existed in this world.</p><p>He was a patriotic hero who had been feared by all surrounding countries, and even though he was equally feared by his own citizens\u2014he still received great respect and worship from them.</p><p>Without him, their country wouldn\u2019t have existed. The hero who had carved this into the world\u2019s history had been brought back to life in that very same country. His fame and popularity was equal to that of a great in this country.</p><p>His Noble Phantasm Kaziklu Bey: Lord of Execution possessed uncommon power as a result as well.</p><p>True, they were only ordinary stakes. But\u2014the problem was that these stakes could be freely summoned forth according to Lancer of Black\u2019s command.</p><p>Though, even when faced with an enemy with a Noble Phantasm of that level, Lancer of Red was still easily a match for a thousand of them. Without paying any care to the stakes that stabbed countless times all over his body from his feet to his right shoulder to his left flank to his elbow, neither his movements nor his strength changed at all. Right now, his Noble Phantasm Kavacha and Kundala: O Surya, Become Armor was negating 90% of the damage from the stakes. They were reduced to mere scratches that he could heal while fighting.</p><p>However\u2026</p><p>\u201C\u2014Magnificent. You\u2019ve broken one thousand stakes with that spear, burned eight hundred with those flames covering your body and stopped two thousand with that golden armor. Lancer of Red, you are without a doubt worthy of being a hero. With that armor, even a battering ram would have no effect, let alone my stakes.\u201D</p><p>Karna accepted Lancer of Black\u2019s praise with a solemn attitude.</p><p>\u201CThank you for your words, lord of this land.\u201D</p><p>\u201CIf you weren\u2019t a pagan, I would allow you to surrender. That alone is regrettable, that you believe in a fake god.\u201D</p><p>\u201CHmm, how do you know that my god is a fake?\u201D</p><p>\u201COf course I know. God is a pure and untouched absolute. If not, who would believe in him? Who would rely on him? A god who mingles with people and has intercourse with them is merely a hideous monster.\u201D</p><p>\u201CNow, I wonder about that. It\u2019s only natural that any religious faith undergoes innumerable changes depending on the land. If it is a land where floods occur, then one who rules over water is the God there. If my gods and their gods are monsters, then the God you believe is also merely a monster upon whom the ideal of being [absolute] was pressed upon.\u201D</p><p>Instantly, fire seethed in Lancer of Black\u2019s eyes. Even after seeing that, Lancer of Red spoke clearly and calmly.</p><p>\u201C\u2014I see. You\u2019re quite stern and severe, lord of impalement, Kaziklu Bey. To you, these stakes are both attack and defence, both a demonstration of force and an embodiment of fear.\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2026What?\u201D</p><p>\u201CYou use these stakes to establish your domain, your castle and what you must protect; in other words, you try to form a country with just a single person. Is it an act out of love for your homeland, or is it due to your sense of responsibility as the king of a state?\u201D</p><p>Lancer of Red exposed Lancer of Black in an indifferent manner. Not his body, but what was within his heart.</p><p>\u201CBut there aren\u2019t any subjects to obey you here, are there? A king might be aloof and isolated. But there is no such thing as a king without a retinue\u2026 What a blunder, lord of impalement. I am a Heroic Spirit, and do not fear even making an entire country my enemy.\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2014Hoh, how interesting.\u201D</p><p>Lancer of Black smiled. It was an extremely violent smile charged full of anger and fury, hatred and killing intent.</p><p>\u201CYou don\u2019t fear facing my country by yourself, as expected of a hero\u2014I have already punished you three times over for that arrogance. Yes\u2026 My stakes have pierced you three times in total. Therefore, you will die here.\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2014!?\u201D</p><p>Feeling dread suddenly hit his body, Lancer of Red immediately attempted to jump back\u2014but it was no longer an issue of being slow or fast. It was already in the past. The attack was already ending\u2026!</p><p>\u201CYou guessed quickly. Yes, my Kaziklu Bey: Lord of Execution isn\u2019t a Noble Phantasm that creates stakes. It\u2019s the \u2018stakes stabbed into the enemy\u2019 themselves that are the Noble Phantasm. As long as you\u2019re within this territory of mine, no matter how much you fortify your body, if it is a fact that you have received an attack from me\u2014\u201D</p><p>Within Lancer of Red\u2019s body, something was swelling up with violent force. Hard, sharp, repulsively cold, it was\u2014</p><p>\u201CStakes, huh\u2026\u201D</p><p>The golden armor that clad Karna\u2019s body could protect against stakes, blades, hammers, or any kind of attack regardless of whether it was physical or magical. However\u2014attacks from within his body were a single exception. Furthermore, these stakes were manifesting in the state of already having pierced him.</p><p>Even a hornet with strong jaws and stingers that freely danced through the sky and coveted prey was just powerless food when inside a nest weaved by a multitude of spiders.</p><p>Blood trickled down from the three stakes stabbing into him very quickly. This was probably Karna\u2019s first experience of receiving damage while clad in that armor.</p><p>In a flash, Lancer of Black charged forward in order to snatch victory. From the beginning, he never thought even in his dreams that Lancer of Red would be killed by something of this level.</p><p>So he couldn\u2019t overlook this single instant. No matter how great a hero was, there was no way they could resist while stabbed with stakes\u2014!</p><p>\u201CThis is checkmate, Lancer of Red\u2026!\u201D</p><p>Lancer of Black launched an attack with a stream of countless stakes and also the spear he held in his hand. The attack was already closer to a swarm of piranhas than a Noble Phantasm. After all, there was no pause in his prana usage. As long the homunculi squeezed out prana for him, he could continue creating stakes perpetually. Two thousand stakes was simply the maximum limit he could invoke at once. No matter how many stakes were destroyed, they could be recreated as long as he had prana.</p><p>In other words, this battlefield was basically covered entirely by stakes containing his malice. He couldn\u2019t be beaten. There shouldn\u2019t be any way for a single warrior to challenge and beat this king who ruled the land and subdued his nation.</p><p>But\u2014his entire surroundings being his enemy was the most commonplace of commonplace situations for the Heroic Spirit Karna.</p><p>As Lancer of Black thrusted his spear at the crown of his head, Lancer of Red splendidly diverted it away with a sweep of his own spear as if he couldn\u2019t even feel the damage from the stakes stabbing into him.</p><p>\u201C\u2026!!\u201D</p><p>Even Lancer of Black was left speechless. Meanwhile, Lancer of Red displayed his superhuman will power even further.</p><p>\u201CO Agni.\u201D</p><p>A blaze wrapped around Lancer of Red\u2019s entire body. Lancer of Black instantly understood that he was trying to burn away the stakes.</p><p>He was going to laugh in ridicule at him, but stiffened an instant later. The flames went inside Lancer of Red\u2019s body. They burned, burned and burned\u2014until every single one of the stakes piercing Lancer of Red were blasted away.</p><p>Without wasting any time, Lancer of Black attacked with another rain of stakes.</p><p>But what the stakes were trying to destroy was, of all things, an incarnation of fire. He was the son of the sun, who could not be burned even by flame spirits.</p><p>His sturdy spear handed to him by the gods, the golden armor that had been granted to him due to his mother\u2019s supplication, and his blood ties to the sun god\u2014their stats were all listed as half their actual value when checking the stats of the Servant known as Karna.</p><p>Karna\u2019s strongest weapon was his \u2018will\u2019. Possessing a strong will and a strong heart, he was the Hero of Charity who had never resented a single person despite experiencing all kinds of misfortune. He was a man who had been given things more special than that of anyone else, but never once was treated [special] himself.</p><p>Neither proud nor arrogant, he was a hero who merely carried out a way of life that would not shame the name of his father from the moment he was born to when he was finally shot down.</p><p>Therefore, even when his entrails were gouged out and the nerves of his arms were severed by just three stakes. Even when he was attacked by an overwhelming feeling of oppression due to an endless stream of stakes. Even when he had to endure unimaginable agony as he circulated fire through the inside of his body in order to deal with the stakes.</p><p>Lancer of Red would never fear nor bend his knees in submission\u2014!</p><p>Flames surrounded the two Servants. It was exactly the same as earlier. The flames were returning everything to nothing. But that wasn\u2019t all.</p><p>\u201C\u2014Lord of this land, I\u2019ll be taking your head!\u201D</p><p>While clad in flames, Lancer of Red fiercely plunged forward\u2014and without minding the damage from the stakes and flames at all, he landed a direct hit to the tip of Lancer of Black\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>\u201CGuh\u2026!\u201D</p><p>A cry of unconcealed anguish. The struggle for supremacy ended here. Lancer of Red had finally seized Lancer of Black. And in order to increase the success of his finishing blow, Lancer of Red began to wait for the chance to release his other Noble Phantasm that rivaled his golden armor, that is, Brahmastra Kundala: O Brahma, Curse Me.</p><hr><p>The Fortress of Millennia. The Masters there viewed the battlefield through their familiars and Menorah, and either gave directions to their Servants or had nothing more to say and simply watched the battle while holding their breaths.</p><p>Among them, Darnic suddenly spoke up.</p><p>\u201C\u2014I\u2019m going out. Fiore, I leave commanding the Masters to you. Henceforth, you are all to obey her orders.\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2026Grandfather?\u201D</p><p>Darnic didn\u2019t respond to Fiore and leapt out from a window. Flight wasn\u2019t a very difficult spell for a magus. He stepped through the sky as if walking up a set of stairs.</p><p>\u2014Like I thought, I suppose I\u2019ll have to activate it.</p><p>While looking down at his Command Spells, he carefully examined the current situation of his Servant\u2026 Lancer of Black. He considered Lancer of Red, who had fought evenly against Saber of Black, the hero Siegfried, and also Rider of Red, Achilles, who Archer of Black had concluded couldn\u2019t be killed except by Heroic Spirits with the blood of the gods.</p><p>In addition to those two, Saber of Red was also a formidable enemy. Even now, she was one-sidedly fighting against their camp\u2019s Rider. At this rate, Rider of Black would be defeated.</p><p>But Darnic still had a last resort. Lancer of Black\u2019s other Noble Phantasm.</p><p>It was a truly certain-kill Noble Phantasm that, once activated, would allow him to easily tear apart Lancer of Red and kill even a Heroic Spirit with divine blood.</p><p>Of course, the price for using it was high. Rather, it was something that he absolutely did not want to use.</p><p>\u201CLegend of Dracula: Tradition of Blood\u2026\u201D</p><p>Once used, Lancer of Black would transform into a blood-sucking vampire that was only told of in folklore. Instead of a Heroic Spirit, he would be reduced to a literal monster.</p><p>The price of activating that Noble Phantasm was Darnic\u2019s \u2018life\u2019. Because Lancer of Black had formed a contract as a Servant with Darnic in order to erase Vlad III\u2019s blood-tarnished legend\u2014that is, the vampire Dracula\u2014from history.</p><p>\u201C\u2014In other words. Making me use that Noble Phantasm is the same as spitting upon me. Even if I am about to die, I will absolutely not use it. And if you force me to do so with a Command Spell, I don\u2019t need to tell you what will happen to you after that, do I?\u201D</p><p>That was the warning, no, the order Lancer of Black had given immediately after being summoned. In other words, if Darnic made him use this Noble Phantasm, he would pay for it with death.</p><p>\u201C\u2026But if we lose, I\u2019ll die either way.\u201D</p><p>That was the truth. If he ran away, he could probably extend at least his life, but the magus Darnic Prestone Yggdmillennia would die. That alone was an option he would not choose.</p><p>If it was for the sake of grasping victory, Darnic would permit any and all sacrifices. But the problem here was that the Master of Lancer of Black was himself.</p><p>He could force Lancer to use Legend of Dracula with one Command Spell, and then make Lancer kill himself with a second one. This would remove all problems. But if he did that, Darnic would lose his Servant.</p><p>Even if Lancer annihilated all the Red Servants during that time, what followed was a battle between the Masters of the Yggdmillennia clan. Even if Darnic was the clan head, this was a war surrounding the Holy Grail which could grant all wishes.</p><p>Even the most sensible clan members like Fiore and Caules wouldn\u2019t listen to his orders then.</p><p>Then, should he take over another Servant from someone else?</p><p>That was also a difficult problem. Would anyone really comply with an order to hand over their Servant? Also, there was no Heroic Spirit besides the already-vanished Saber among them who could oppose Fiore\u2019s Servant Chiron.</p><p>No matter what he did, it was a situation filled with great risk.</p><p>\u201C\u2014Good grief.\u201D</p><p>He was being cornered. Darnic understood that very well. But he had experienced that many times in the past one hundred years.</p><p>Among those experiences, the Third Holy Grail War sixty years ago had been an uncannily harsh battle, so much so that, even now, he rejoiced at still being alive like this.</p><p>Back then, he had the unexpected fortune of finding a path that led to the Greater Grail from a hole he had happened to fall into. He then enticed the German Nazis with skillful words, getting them to send in, under the direct orders of the F\xFChrer, a huge military force that one wouldn\u2019t expect to be sent to an allied country like Japan, and had them steal the Greater Grail.</p><p>And then, he intentionally arranged for the transport carrying the Greater Grail to pass through Trifas on the way to Germany, and then killed all the magi and soldiers whom he had fought alongside. Following that were days of research and politics. Outwardly towards the Association, he feigned to have the Yggdmillennia clan content itself with the duty of being a receptacle for drop-out magi.</p><p>He altered the Greater Grail little by little to adapt it to Trifas. His achievement in making it possible to summon not only pure Heroics Spirits, but also \u2018those who only have the aspect of a Heroic Spirit\u2019 could be called an unexpected by-product of the alteration process.</p><p>At any rate, time was the one thing he had plenty of. Ten years, twenty years, thirty years, forty years, fifty years, sixty years\u2014</p><p>What was the origin of this tenacity of his?</p><p>The driving force of all magi, to reach the Root? Of course, that played a big part in his reasons. As long as one lived as a magus, to aim for that was natural. But had he really struggled on until this point for such a \u2018pure\u2019 wish?</p><p>\u2026A bitter memory from over eighty years ago surfaced in his mind.</p><p>At the time, he had been decorated with a brilliant debut as an up-and-coming young magus, and had suddenly obtained a marriage proposal. It was a good match for marriage. Darnic would be tying himself to a clan of long lineage that stood amongst the aristocratic Lords of the Clock Tower.</p><p>But then it all came to a halt there. The Yggdmillennia blood was polluted and impure, and couldn\u2019t maintain itself past the fifth generation. \u2018All that\u2019s left is ruin for your clan,\u2019 a certain magus had warned him.</p><p>\u2014Ridiculous. As long as the clan continues past the fifth generation, any number of counter-measures can be thought of.</p><p>But it seemed the only one who thought that way was Darnic. The clan he was about to marry into didn\u2019t like risks, and so to them, he immediately became an outsider that had to be excluded.</p><p>Even his future brother-in-law, who had slapped his back with a smile and sworn friendship with him, and the woman who was to be his spouse, who had shyly whispered her love to him, had both turned away from him.</p><p>\u2014That\u2019s fine. Such things happen.</p><p>But at that very instant, Yggdmillennia was cut off from their dream of rising to the ranks of the Lords. Even if they overcame ruin past the fifth generation, the label that had been once slapped on them would never come off.</p><p>He could live with what happened to himself, but those magi had taken away even the futures of those who followed after him. At that instant, Darnic abandoned the idea of reaching the Root through the normal approach\u2014in other words, by accumulating diligent research as a magus and gradually climbing up the political ladder within the Association\u2014as a wish that would never be granted.</p><p>Therefore, he first had to think of a method to stop the ruin of his clan. And then he had to search for a path to reach the Root.</p><p>There was also the option of simply withdrawing from the Association of Magi and continuing his clan\u2019s research while hiding themselves amidst the world. But Darnic refused to do that.</p><p>Naturally, remaining in the Association was humiliating. But Darnic carved that humiliation into his heart without forgetting any bit of it for even a second\u2014and used it as nourishment.</p><p>At that time, he coincidently learned about the Holy Grail War in Fuyuki City. He involved Nazi Germany, who were interested in the occult, obtained the power of their army, and participated in the war as a Master.</p><p>It was fortunate for him that the situation had turned extremely chaotic due to the Einzberns, who had committed an act of foul play that broke the war\u2019s rules.</p><p>\u2026The Third Holy Grail War concluded with no definite victor, and the exhausted Einzbern, Tohsaka and Makiri families had possessed no means by then to stop Darnic and the German Nazis.</p><p>According to rumors floating around, the Einzberns apparently still hadn\u2019t given up on the Holy Grail and were trying to make a new one. The Tohsaka gave up on the Holy Grail and searched for another method to reach the Root in Fuyuki. The Makiri was a clan that had already begun falling into decay even back then. There was no news of them, but the Third Holy Grail War had most likely dealt a decisive blow to them.</p><p>Darnic no longer felt any resentment towards the clan who had forsaken him. When he considered the present, he even felt like thanking them. Though, they had already fallen to ruin as a clan long ago, without leaving their names in history at all\u2014</p><p>It wasn\u2019t that Darnic had a direct hand in bringing about their ruin. They were simply cornered politically. They had merely invested funds into a futile experiment, leaked the details of the hidden ritual, and the child who had inherited their clan\u2019s Magic Crest had coincidentally and unfortunately died in an accident during the experiment.</p><p>They, who flattered Darnic and were even prepared to sell themselves to him now that they had come to ruin, were the only clan to whom he refused the request to join Yggdmillennia. Following that, he knew that they had headed to Japan in the Far East where the Holy Grail War had once taken place, but their whereabouts were unknown after that. Most likely, they had lived out their lives while lamenting everything until their death.</p><p>Human life consists of continuing to defeat someone else. And right now, the ones he must defeat are the Association of Magi and the other magi of his clan.</p><p>Of course, he felt no hesitation. Whether it be defeating members of his own clan or making his Servant use a Noble Phantasm that he had deemed taboo.</p><p>Darnic\u2019s expression right now was enough to terrify anyone who knew his usual self. It was inhumane and cold, as if frozen in place, with not even a fragment of emotion showing through it.</p><p>Right now, he was thinking of something terribly crafty and vicious. If necessary, he wouldn\u2019t hesitate to fall to any and all sorts of corruption. The reason he purposely went outside was because of this. So that he wouldn\u2019t inspire any unnecessary wariness in the others.</p><p>\u201C\u2014Now then. What to do?\u201D</p><p>He thought it over for a short while. And then, Darnic came to a single conclusion. The decision and determination to not balk at dirtying himself with blood was necessary, but that was surely something that he hardly had to be asked to do at this late hour.</p><hr><p>\u2014One-sided was the only way to describe it.</p><p>From the beginning, the two of them were in different leagues from each other in terms of their status as Heroic Spirits, the age of their mysteries and everything else.</p><p>With bestial instincts, Saber of Red didn\u2019t bother to block Rider of Black\u2019s golden lance and instead continued to cleverly dodge his attacks.</p><p>Although its offensive power was effectively nil, this was the lance that had the extremely fatal ability to \u201Cforcefully make a Servant\u2019s legs vanish\u201D\u2014the Trap of Argalia: Down with a Touch!.</p><p>But that ability was also useless if it couldn\u2019t deliver a direct hit. It wasn\u2019t that Rider of Black was inexperienced with handling a lance. Rather, he had participated in many jousting matches and reached a level where normal knights could not compete with him.</p><p>However, Saber of Red was not a normal knight. She was Mordred, the illegitimate child of Arthur Pendragon, the King of Knights himself, and an uncommon child prodigy who had studied, stolen and altered her father\u2019s techniques to make them her own.</p><p>\u201CToo slow!\u201D</p><p>Saber of Red\u2019s full-body armor was obviously in the heavyweight class even from an outsider\u2019s perspective. Even if it was made of prana, its weight didn\u2019t change. Rider of Black, who had confidence in his nimbleness, tried to completely ransack her with his speed.</p><p>But the one who was falling behind was none other than Rider of Black. He was desperately blocking Saber of Red\u2019s sword with his lance. On the blade\u2019s edge, red sparks of lightning danced before disappearing.</p><p>This was Saber of Red\u2019s prana. Since she was releasing her insane amount of prana that practically gushed out of her entire body, his arms went numb just by blocking the blade of her sword. Rider of Black was terrified. He could feel it each time their weapons clashed\u2014her violent flame-like passion that mixed together madness, hatred and the joy of battle.</p><p>\u201CAh, damn it, I\u2019ve got other things to do, you know\u2026 Just die already!\u201D</p><p>Clicking her tongue, Saber of Red muttered that with a very annoyed tone. In response, Rider of Black did what was his natural specialty and which always annoyed his opponent the most\u2014he smiled.</p><p>\u201CNo, no, don\u2019t say that. How about keeping me company a while longer?\u201D</p><p>\u201CEnough prattling\u2014!!\u201D</p><p>And Saber of Red also had a low boiling point. Overwhelmed with anger, she grated her teeth and launched an even more severe attack.</p><p>It was terrifying. And yet even so, her attacks were just barely within what could be called \u2018sword technique\u2019.</p><p>As he exchanged blows with her, Rider of Black understood. Her sword skills possessed the conflicted yet perfect balance between the ferocity of a Berserker and the skill of a Saber.</p><p>To use a comparison, take a ferocious wild monkey. Say it was taught to fight to receive food and pitted against thousands of \u2018enemies\u2019. Of course, it didn\u2019t have the intelligence to learn fighting techniques. But, if instinct trained it, numerous battles sharpened its mind, and the reward for doing so satisfied it\u2026</p><p>Then what was produced in the end was an ultimate monster that had mastered not fighting techniques, but \u2018something else\u2019.</p><p>Saber of Red\u2019s sword skills were extremely close to that. It was a sword technique that was produced only by those who continued fighting, fighting and killing, throwing away things like etiquette and chivalry and fighting only for the sake of survival and slaughter.</p><p>No one but her could master this technique, and no one but her was compatible with the logic behind it. It was the technique of a lion, created and mastered by Mordred alone.</p><p>\u201CKuh\u2026!!\u201D</p><p>Sparks flew as lance and sword clashed. Since the battle had started, Saber of Red had been overwhelming Rider of Black.</p><p>But Saber of Red was the one who was irritated.</p><p>\u2014Damn it, I can\u2019t deal a finishing blow.</p><p>Saber of Red\u2019s Instinct skill, which resembled psychic perception, was warning her not to let herself be hit by that golden shining lance. Even if she thought that receiving a single blow from the lance\u2019s blunt tip wouldn\u2019t have much effect on her, her instincts wouldn\u2019t allow it.</p><p>As a result, her dodges became slightly bigger and wider, and she couldn\u2019t follow up well with a counterattack using her blade. It wasn\u2019t enough to make her attacks sloppy, but it was true that she couldn\u2019t put her full power behind it.</p><p>Should she just ignore her instincts and try receiving an attack\u2014? That thought came to mind, but she immediately dismissed it. That lance was a Noble Phantasm. And as long as it was a Noble Phantasm, she had to remain cautious of it no matter how low its power was.</p><p>It would be fatal for her if it had some ability like immobilizing what it hit or weakening the enemy\u2019s movements. No, Saber of Red didn\u2019t think that Rider of Black would just charge at an enemy of the most powerful class like her without some plan in mind.</p><p>She shut out her irritation\u2026 Her impatience right now wasn\u2019t out of worry of losing. She was just impatient to get this over with so that the entire battle wouldn\u2019t end before she could fight other Servants, especially that Archer of Black whom she couldn\u2019t conclude her earlier fight with.</p><p>So, shutting out her impatience, Saber of Red determinedly waited for Rider of Black to show an opening.</p><p>\u2014Now!</p><p>And then, that chance came. She repelled the lance upwards with all her power and drove her sword into his defenceless abdomen. His chainmail might as well not have existed in the face of her sword.</p><p>\u201CGah\u2026!\u201D</p><p>At the last moment, Rider of Black put all his power into twisting his body. This act succeeded, at the very least letting him avoid instant death as it only pierced his flank instead.</p><p>But could it really be called a success? Rider of Black no longer had the strength to endure the short time it would take for any healing spells or his own self-healing ability to take effect.</p><p>\u201C\u2014Well, it was fun.\u201D</p><p>Saber of Red said that and raised Clarent over her head to prepare for a big swing. Rider of Black forcibly raised his face, and murmured with a smile.</p><p>\u201C\u2026Preparations, complete.\u201D</p><p>Saber of Red frowned suspiciously at Rider of Black\u2019s words.</p><p>\u201CHey, what preparations are you talking about? Eh?\u201D</p><p>\u2014At that instant. With a speed that truly couldn\u2019t be caught with the naked eye. A strong attack by Berserker of Black, who had received a boost from a Command Spell, hit Saber of Red\u2019s defenceless back.</p><p>Deeming that this was an all-or-nothing battle, Caules had used his second Command Spell. According to Archer of Black\u2019s diagnosis, Saber of Red didn\u2019t have a defensive-type Noble Phantasm that was close to a Conceptual Armament like Saber of Black or Rider of Red did. He had judged that her helmet merely served to hide her true name and abilities, and had no other powers.</p><p>In that case, this attack should, at the very least, get through. Particularly since Berserker\u2019s mace was a weapon that dealt impacts instead of slashes. It was especially useful against enemies covered entirely in armor.</p><p>The impact between the armor and the mace was like the sound of a car being crushed in a car press machine. Berserker of Black felt feedback from her blow. Rider, who watched the attack from beginning to end, was also certain it had hit.</p><p>However.</p><p>\u201C\u2014That\u2019s, impossible.\u201D</p><p>The one who deserved shock and admiration wasn\u2019t Berserker of Black, who had taken careful aim and hit with her mace just as planned. The one deserving awe was Saber of Red, who had received that attack and yet, instead of being blown away, hadn\u2019t moved, as if she were rooted to the ground.</p><p>Caules, who watched through his familiars, the attacker Berserker, and even Rider could not hide their shock.</p><p>\u201CBerserker\u2026 Even if a small fry like you is added to the battle\u2026\u201D</p><p>Saber of Red\u2019s voice was penetratingly cold, as if stifling pain and anger beneath it. She firmly turned the point of her sword towards Rider of Black. Rider of Black, who had tried to stab her with his lance at the same time as Berserker, couldn\u2019t move a single step lest he be skewered.</p><p>\u201C\u2014uu\u2014uu!\u201D</p><p>\u2018This is bad. Get away, Berserker!\u2019</p><p>At nearly the same time as Caules\u2019 order, Berserker, seized by a premonition of \u2018death\u2019, immediately jumped backwards by a full twenty meters. She disappeared amidst the crowd of golems who happened to be standing there.</p><p>And immediately after. Berserker and Rider of Black were made to realize once more just how much Saber of Red towered above them as a Heroic Spirit.</p><p>\u201C\u2014Did you think you could beat me!?\u201D</p><p>She leapt forward. No, it was already at the level where she wasn\u2019t just leaping, but was shot forward. Saber of Red was a loaded bullet, and the gun hammer had just hit the detonator.</p><p>Through Saber of Red\u2019s skill [Prana Burst]\u2014she, the bullet, flew out from the rifled gun barrel while spinning, and shot without wavering straight towards her target, Berserker.</p><p>And the large sword she held ready was a warhead. Even with Saber\u2019s face completely covered by her helmet, Berserker definitely felt it.</p><p>\u2014This Servant is smiling with a sneer on her face right now.</p><p>Saber\u2019s slash swung in an arc and exploded through all the surrounding golems. \u2018Explode\u2019 was truly the right word. A shock wave and red lightning burst out from the blade, and the surrounding golems were reduced to rubble just by the aftershock.</p><p>The Black Masters who observed this scene and the Servants who saw it could only gasp.</p><p>\u201C\u2014No, way.\u201D</p><p>That strained mutter from somebody was a sentiment that everyone there agreed with in the depths of their hearts. That was how amazing and absurd the attack was. And what was more terrifying was that this wasn\u2019t a Noble Phantasm. It was just a normal attack launched with the full power of a Heroic Spirit.</p><p>\u2018Berserker\u2026!!\u2019</p><p>Caules desperately called out to her through their telepathic communication. Berserker gave no sign of responding to it. She wasn\u2019t dead; her Master Caules could tell that much. But\u2014what state was she in after receiving that attack just now?</p><p>Saber of Red cleared away the smoke with a swing of her blade. Catching sight of Berserker and noticing her current state, Saber\u2019s face twisted with hatred.</p><p>\u201CYou\u2014\u201D</p><p>\u2018Hey, did you get her?\u2019</p><p>After her Master cut in with telepathic communication, Saber replied with a displeased voice.</p><p>\u201CI hit her. I hit her, but she\u2019s still alive. She\u2019s alive and struggling unseemly on the ground.\u201D</p><p>\u2018\u2026You\u2019re really in a bad mood, aren\u2019t you? So, have you figured out her true identity?\u2019</p><p>\u201CNot really. But\u2014this girl isn\u2019t human. Rather, I\u2019m doubtful that she\u2019s any kind of living creature. It feels like she\u2019s\u2026 kinda similar to a homunculus.\u201D</p><p>\u2018A homunculus?\u2019</p><p>\u201CThe arm I chopped off has cables running through it instead of blood vessels. Master, is there any Heroic Spirit like that?\u201D</p><p>\u2018An artificial life-form, huh\u2026 I get the feeling that\u2026 I might or might not have heard about such a Heroic Spirit.\u2019</p><p>\u201CHey, which is it, Master? \u2026Well, it doesn\u2019t matter either way. Learning the true name of a Servant that\u2019s about to die is useless knowledge.\u201D</p><p>\u2018Wait, wait\u2026 an artificial life-form\u2026 I\u2019ll ask just in case, but her entire body isn\u2019t that of a machine, right?\u2019</p><p>\u201CHer flesh is full of patched-together defective parts. She\u2019s not a machine\u2026 well, who cares. I\u2019m going to deal the finishing blow now.\u201D</p><p>To \u2018kill\u2019 a Servant\u2019, it was necessary to smash their spiritual core. So she just needed to destroy the organs which connected to it, her heart or brain.</p><p>Without hesitation, Saber of Red stabbed her sword into Berserker\u2019s chest. Berserker of Black received the sword without resisting. She just twitched the instant the blade was thrust in.</p><p>\u201C\u2014It\u2019s over.\u201D</p><p>Now that Berserker had received a fatal wound, Saber no longer cared about her. Her next target was Rider of Black. When she turned around, she saw Rider charging at her with his lance ready.</p><p>He was fast. But with his wounds still not completely healed, his attack was only just slightly above average for a Heroic Spirit. She was confident that she could handle even a hundred of such attacks.</p><p>\u201CCome at me, dog!\u201D</p><p>She was confident. She would block Rider\u2019s lance with her sword and decapitate him in the blink of an eye. And thus the battle would end. Though the rank of her Instinct wasn\u2019t high enough to be called future foresight, it still easily guided her to the optimum answer in this scene.</p><p>The odds were ten-to-one that Rider of Black would be killed. It didn\u2019t seem like any miracle would happen, so now she just had to concentrate.</p><p>Saber of Red was correct. But one of her calculations was insufficient. Not a small fry like a battle-type homunculus or golem\u2014nor even another Servant. But rather, if there was a \u2018fluke\u2019 that shouldn\u2019t exist in this world.</p><p>Then all her calculations would turn brittle and fall apart.</p><p>\u201C\u2014!?\u201D</p><p>First, Rider of Black slowed his charge while making a shocked expression. Next, a small human figure appeared in the corner of her vision.</p><p>Berserker of Black\u2014it was not. It was just a rank-and-file homunculus. He was carrying a slender sword and charging at her just like Rider. His attack was unexpectedly fast for a small fry, though.</p><p>But something like that was still nothing more than a mosquito sting to her. Saber of Red ignored him and focused on Rider of Black.</p><p>If he collided with him, she would just repel his attack and take him down with one hand. Then it would be over. That\u2019s what she predicted, but Saber of Red still felt a lingering unease.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t anything on the level of a premonition. It was just a small and trivial uneasy feeling. So Saber ignored it and prepared herself to kill the charging Rider of Black.</p><p>Rider of Black shook off his shock and, as if driven by some impatience, charged at Saber even faster.</p><p>The first to reach Saber was the homunculus. But his sword thrust would probably bounce off Saber\u2019s full-body armor. There was no way it wouldn\u2019t. At the very least, it was impossible that her armor would lose to the likes of a slash from a homunculus.</p><p>\u2026However, the weapon that the homunculus held was none other than the sword of a Servant. Though not a Noble Phantasm, its sharpness was incomparable with commonplace weapons held by other rank-and-file soldiers.</p><p>Still, there would have been no problem if its wielder was an ordinary homunculus. But\u2014</p><p>\u2014He didn\u2019t act according to any rational thought. Without considering anything, he threw away even his own life.</p><p>Rider of Black\u2019s charge was going to fail. Sieg understood that. The hero who had saved him would be cruelly defeated and killed before his eyes.</p><p>That was the one thing that he absolutely couldn\u2019t stand. His heartbeat had sent blood pumping strongly through his entire body, and put strength into his feet as he firmly stepped on the ground.</p><p>He yelled. I don\u2019t need anything, he thought. Even if this attack was a meaningless act. Even if it would only extend Rider of Black\u2019s life by just a little longer.</p><p>The option to abandon Rider and live a peaceful life\u2014was completely meaningless in Sieg\u2019s eyes.</p><p>Saber of Red\u2019s final mistake in her calculations was concerning her full-body armor. She had forgotten. True, Saber had withstood the fully-powered and Command Spell-enhanced attack by Berserker.</p><p>But that didn\u2019t mean she wasn\u2019t injured. The part of her armor that had directly received the attack by the mace had been bent and caved in.</p><p>Therefore, it was only natural that that part of her armor alone was now brittle. The homunculus\u2019 eyes had definitely grasped the existence of what could be rightly called a catastrophe point in her armor.</p><p>Saber and Sieg each shared a heavy shock. For Sieg, it was the physical collision after charging into her with his shoulder and the resulting terrible pain that wracked his entire body. But Saber wasn\u2019t concerned with that.</p><p>\u201CWh\u2014at?\u201D</p><p>Before feeling any pain, she was dumbstruck. That slender sword had pierced her prided full-body armor. Blood was slowly flowing out from her abdomen. Her rage instantly dissipated, and in its place, a frozen killing intent ruled Saber\u2019s mind.</p><p>\u201C\u2014Who the hell are you?\u201D</p><p>Sieg remained silent as he pulled out the slender sword and readied to use it again. It wasn\u2019t that he didn\u2019t reply, but that he couldn\u2019t. The Servant in front of him wasn\u2019t mad with rage, but was just facing him while her face remained concealed behind her steel helmet\u2014and as a result, Sieg couldn\u2019t even open his mouth to speak.</p><p>\u201C\u2026If you won\u2019t answer, I don\u2019t mind that either. I just decided that I\u2019m going to kill you.\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2014kuh!! Stop, Saber!\u201D</p><p>Rider of Black charged once more. He attacked from a low stance as if gliding forward, but Saber of Red blocked it with her sword and, in recompense for his blind and na\xEFve charge, dealt him a severe elbow strike.</p><p>\u201CGuh\u2026!!\u201D</p><p>She had aimed for the spot that still hadn\u2019t completely healed from the earlier slash, and so even more blood gushed out from his abdomen. Even as he collapsed to the ground, Rider of Black glared at Saber of Red with a desperate expression.</p><p>Saber spoke to Rider with a look that contained a trace of pity.</p><p>\u201CUnfortunately, I\u2019ve already confirmed this guy as an enemy. If he were just a bit weaker, he could have found another path.\u201D</p><p>Saber of Red readied her silver sword, completely focused on her intention to kill. The sword was pointed not at Rider, but at the homunculus. As if in a trance, Sieg gazed straight at Saber\u2019s valiant form. How terrifying, he thought. I\u2019m going to die, he predicted. And yet, somehow his emotions were numbed. He was practically close to a serene state of mind.</p><p>His heartbeat was no faster than usual. It seemed this heart didn\u2019t accelerate its pulse out of fear. As expected of a hero, Sieg thought, admiring in his heart the man who had been Saber of Black, Siegfried.</p><p>\u2026The match was over in a single blow.</p><p>Sieg didn\u2019t even have the time to swing his sword as Saber of Red\u2019s slash tore through his chest. Her blade slashed through him from the shoulder down and eventually reached his heart.</p><p>\u201C\u2014See ya. I\u2019ll carve the memory of you into my heart, nameless homunculus.\u201D</p><p>Those were without a doubt, words of praise by Saber of Red. Vivid blood gushed out, and yet another homunculus fell dying to the ground. It was a scene that had repeated countless times since earlier on this battlefield.</p><p>But at that instant, all the homunculi who had been made to participate in this Great Holy Grail War had their breaths catch in their throats\u2026 All of them knew about him. All of them understood why he had returned as well.</p><p>They were unable to support or assist him. But they sympathized with him. They had wished blessings upon him, the only one among them who had chosen to be free.</p><p>The battle wasn\u2019t over. The golems, Dragon Tooth Warriors, and even the homunculi didn\u2019t rest their hands. But at this moment, the homunculi created by Yggdmillennia felt that everything was over.</p><p>While a gloomy shadow spread among them that no one besides their fellows noticed\u2014the homunculi continued struggling to fight and survive on the battlefield.</p><p>Saber of Red turned to face Rider of Black next.</p><p>\u201C\u2014Sorry for making you wait.\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2026\u201D</p><p>Rider of Black was silent. His head, tilted downwards, had lost any trace of his usual carefree smile.</p><p>\u201CHere I come, Saber of Red. I won\u2019t forgive you.\u201D</p><p>\u201CHah, enough with being moved by feelings! This is a battlefield. Of course I\u2019m going to kill those who face me as an enemy. Even more so for those who wound me!\u201D</p><p>\u201CYeah, I know that. I know that, but there\u2019s no way that I, Astolfo, can agree with that kind of logic!!\u201D</p><p>As Rider of Black yelled, Saber of Red gave a faint smile filled with provocation, planning to intercept him this time, but she couldn\u2019t help stopping her attack due to a sudden telepathic communication.</p><p>The speaker was, naturally, her Master Shishigou.</p><p>\u2018Hey. What happened to Berserker of Black!?\u2019</p><p>Though she felt doubtful over the unclear purpose of this question, Saber of Red replied honestly.</p><p>\u2018What\u2019s with you, Master? If it\u2019s about Berserker, she\u2019s already\u2014\u2019</p><p>\u2018Did you properly confirm that her body dispersed and vanished!?\u2019</p><p>\u2018\u2026No, I didn\u2019t confirm her death that far.\u2019</p><p>But even without doing that, she definitely felt that she had delivered the finishing blow. While remaining attentive to Rider of Black, she turned her head back slightly to look at where Berserker had fallen\u2014and confirmed that there was no one there.</p><p>\u201CWhat\u2026!?\u201D</p><p>Even while shocked, Saber scanned her surroundings. The Servant hadn\u2019t simply vanished after dying. As proof of that, Berserker\u2019s mace was planted upright into the ground. It reminded her of a grave-marker, but she immediately noticed something strange about it.</p><p>When she received Saber\u2019s slash, Berserker of Black should have dropped that mace. And yet, when had that mace been planted into the ground like that?</p><p>Perhaps because the scene of it planted there was far too odd, her attention was caught by the mace. The next instant, as if having timed it, Berserker of Black fell down from the sky and grabbed onto Saber of Red\u2019s back.</p><p>\u201CKuh\u2026 get off!!\u201D</p><p>Saber of Red, having survived upon the battlefield for a long time, understood. This was definitely a suicide attack. Berserker was about to fire off something even if it meant sacrificing herself to do it.</p><p>\u201CNAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014OOU!!</p><p>While screaming like a ferocious beast or a deceased spirit from hell, Berserker of Black still desperately clung to Saber of Red\u2019s back.</p><p>Prana swelled up from within her in a whirlwind, and it began to create a huge twister with her at the center.</p><p>\u201CBerserker!\u201D</p><p>Rider of Black desperately shouted while blocking with one hand the dust that was trying to get into his eyes.</p><p>But the one to respond to him wasn\u2019t Berserker.</p><p>\u2018\u2014That\u2019s enough, Rider. Berserker is activating her Noble Phantasm. Withdraw from there.\u2019</p><p>It was the unpleasantly cold voice of his Master. Naturally, Rider objected.</p><p>\u2018No way. Saber is\u2026\u2019</p><p>\u2018Be quiet. If you stay there, you\u2019ll die, you know? Do you want me to use a Command Spell?\u2019</p><p>Even while gritting his teeth at those words, Rider moved away to somewhere that seemed safe to him. When he cooled his head, he was shocked to realize where he came to a stop.</p><p>He was now more than a hundred meters from where the two female Servants were. In other words, Rider\u2019s body had instinctively judged that it would be dangerous if he didn\u2019t get this far away.</p><p>Rider of Black knew that Berserker had two Noble Phantasms. The first was a continuously-active-type Noble Phantasm, Bridal Chest: Maiden\u2019s Chastity. And the second was\u2014</p><p>\u201C\u2026Blasted Tree: Lightning Branch of Crucifixion.\u201D</p><p>It was a forbidden Noble Phantasm that would drive Berserker of Black herself to death as well.</p><p>Caules didn\u2019t know what he should say to Berserker.</p><p>He just couldn\u2019t stop her. It wasn\u2019t because she was suited to killing Saber of Red or anything like that.</p><p>Caules hadn\u2019t ordered her to do so. He hadn\u2019t been coerced by another Master or Fiore either. Caules just somehow thought that Berserker would probably do so, and Berserker had tried to activate her Noble Phantasm without him even having to use a Command Spell.</p><p>\u2018\u2026Berserker. I\u2019ll back you up with a Command Spell.\u2019</p><p>The Command Spell was neither to protect her nor to make her withdraw. It was a boost. The more narrowly-defined an order was, and the more instantaneous it was, the stronger the effect of the Command Spell was. And if the Servant agreed with the Master\u2019s order, an even greater effect would manifest.</p><p>In this case, if Caules ordered Berserker to use her Noble Phantasm at maximum power, it would be able to exceed its normal output.</p><p>With that much, it would probably be powerful enough to kill Saber of Red.</p><p>\u2018\u2014uu.\u2019</p><p>Her groan of agreement rang through the telepathic link so well it was depressing. At this moment, Caules regretted in the depths of his heart that Berserker of Black was Frankenstein.</p><p>It would have better if she were simply mad. It would have better if she were a mad warrior that didn\u2019t even recognize her Master\u2019s face, couldn\u2019t communicate and just slaughtered the enemy.</p><p>If so, he wouldn\u2019t hesitate so much over using his last remaining Command Spell. From the beginning, he wasn\u2019t even proactively participating in this Greater Holy Grail war, and he had no wish to grant either.</p><p>He should have parted with Berserker without regrets, laments or even sorrow.</p><p>\u2026And yet. What he recalled in his mind was the image of her plucking flowers with a vast expression on her face and throwing them away without picking the flower petals. Of her simply gazing at the ripped-up pieces of the flowers dancing upon the wind.</p><p>His heart hurt as if it were being ripped apart\u2014but he endured it. He didn\u2019t shed tears; from the beginning, he shouldn\u2019t have had the right to do so. The one being killed was her, and the one killing her was him. He couldn\u2019t break that.</p><p>With a voice so cold he hated it, he began speaking the words.</p><p>\u2018The fifth Black Master orders you with a Command Spell.\u2019</p><p>He casted away his meager and short memories of her.</p><p>\u2018\u2014Release all your limiters. Activate your Noble Phantasm Blasted Tree and kill Saber of Red.\u2019</p><p>The sky split apart. The enormous prana that Berserker of Black had gathered up was making the fins on the tail end of her mace spin at high speeds.</p><p>\u201CYou\u2026!\u201D</p><p>Saber\u2019s voice was twisted with irritation. Giving a faint smile, Berserker of Black spoke back to her.</p><p>\u201C\u2014You\u2019re, coming, with me.\u201D</p><p>From the sky to the earth, or perhaps from the earth to the sky, bluish-white light rained down like a waterfall.</p><p>\u201C\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014!!\u201D</p><p>The lightning strike overran the world completely. Everything within a hundred meter radius was completely destroyed, leaving not even a single fragment.</p><p>Anyone who saw it was convinced that Saber of Red had died. Excluding exceptions among exceptions like Rider of Red, no matter how powerful the Servant was, it should have been impossible for them to be all right after being hit by the attack just now.</p><p>The attack Berserker of Black had released by wagering her life was truly tenacious.</p><p>\u201CDid she get her\u2026?\u201D</p><p>But they had forgotten one thing. The ones fighting in this Great Holy Grail War consisted not only of Servants. Though no one caught sight of them on the battlefield, there were still those who had gathered to fight alongside the Servants.</p><p>Yes. Like how Caules had boosted Berserker of Black\u2019s attack with a Command Spell.</p><p>\u201CWha\u2026\u201D</p><p>Rider of Black was stricken speechless by the sight of the Servant who had appeared right before his eyes, surrounded by black smoke and smelling extremely unpleasantly of scorched flesh.</p><p>Saber of Red was before him.</p><p>\u201C\u2026Damn it, I couldn\u2019t dodge it.\u201D</p><p>Saber of Red muttered that in a calm manner.</p><p>\u2018Come on, don\u2019t say that. Shouldn\u2019t you be thinking how great it is that at least you weren\u2019t disintegrated?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Shut up. It would have been better if you used the Command Spell one second sooner, Master.\u2019</p><p>\u2018It wouldn\u2019t have changed anything. In the first place, you shouldn\u2019t have received any injuries when I transported you outside of the danger zone. But that lightning chased after you and even tried to drag you back into the center of it\u2026 Most likely, Berserker was ordered to [kill Saber of Red] with a Command Spell. That\u2019s what caused you to sustain injuries.\u2019</p><p>With the additional support of a Command Spell, it had truly been a fully-powered attack. The only way to have survived it was with a Command Spell of their own.</p><p>Saber of Red\u2019s Master, Shishigou Kairi, hadn\u2019t hesitated to use it. He ordered her to withdraw to somewhere safe with a Command Spell. A \u2018teleportation\u2019 that was nearly equivalent to the concept of time already tread upon the domain of sorcery. The reason Shishigou Kairi, a mere magus, was able to use this highest level of spells that even a witch from the Age of Gods could only use in their personal domain was thanks to the enormous amount of prana contained in the Command Spell.</p><p>\u2026And even after all that, Saber still wasn\u2019t completely unscathed.</p><p>Caules\u2019 Command Spell had also crossed into the concept of space, and as a result had distorted even cause and effect to make the Blasted Tree hit Saber of Red.</p><p>But the Command Spell\u2019s abundant prana was consumed in order to do that, and so hadn\u2019t been able to add its power to the Noble Phantasm\u2019s output itself. As a result, Saber of Red had gotten away with only severe wounds. It would take a bit of time, but healing those injuries was easy.</p><p>\u201C\u2014Damn it!\u201D</p><p>Caules struck the stone wall with his fist, causing the skin to split and bleed. He didn\u2019t even notice the stinging pain due to the heat raging through his head. After confirming that his Servant had died, he had silently left the room where the other Masters were and struck his vexation against the corridor wall. As expected, he didn\u2019t want to show such unsightly behavior in front of other magi.</p><p>\u201C\u2026That wasn\u2019t a mistake.\u201D</p><p>Perhaps noticing her younger brother\u2019s lamenting, Fiore followed him and said that, but Caules shook his head in denial of her words and shouted.</p><p>\u201CNo, it was a mistake! My mistake was betting on a desperate gamble even knowing that the enemy also had Command Spells. If the enemy\u2019s Command Spell had just been a few seconds slower\u2026 if I had just firmly decided to support Berserker with a Command Spell a few seconds sooner, this wouldn\u2019t have happened! Then I wouldn\u2019t have made her\u2026 made Berserker die in vain!\u201D</p><p>I blundered. I made an error in judgement. Caules tortured himself with those thoughts. From Fiore\u2019s perspective, he was half-right, half-wrong.</p><p>As she saw it, that mistake was an unavoidable one. Caules and Berserker had definitely done their very best in confronting Saber of Red. The enemy\u2019s power had simply exceeded theirs.</p><p>\u201CAt the very least, Saber sustained heavy injuries, right?\u201D</p><p>It wasn\u2019t in vain, Fiore thought. That attack, filled with Berserker\u2019s will, shouldn\u2019t have been in vain. But Caules, as a magus, shook his head and denied that.</p><p>\u201CAs long as the enemy Master can use healing magecraft, her injuries can still be healed\u2026 I\u2019m fine, Nee-san, so hurry up and go back to commanding the others.\u201D</p><p>\u201CBut\u2014\u201D</p><p>\u201CIt\u2019s fine, just go already.\u201D</p><p>Caules said that in a forced tone of voice, and in the end, Fiore returned to the room to lead the others. Now alone, Caules leaned his back against the corridor wall and covered his face, thinking to himself.</p><p>\u2026When that first attack didn\u2019t end up being decisive, should I have made her withdraw?</p><p>\u2026Was it a mistake to try and kill Saber of Red with a surprise attack?</p><p>\u2026In the first place, was my decision to try it out with Berserker foolish?</p><p>Naturally, there had been reasons for why he had done so. If they didn\u2019t kill Saber of Red there, there was a high chance that their camp\u2019s Rider would have been killed instead.</p><p>Lancer and Archer, who were fighting with their full power, hadn\u2019t been having as much difficulty with their respective formidable opponents.</p><p>What should he have done? How could he have won; how could he have saved her? He thought and thought it over in agony, and the conclusion he came to was simply the most ordinary and worst one; that there was nothing he could have done.</p><p>They couldn\u2019t afford to lose Rider, and at that time the only one who could quickly rush over there was Berserker. Berserker had also been searching for another enemy to fight after losing sight of Caster of Red and the Master she was chasing.</p><p>No, even if he mourned and lamented, he couldn\u2019t do anything anymore.</p><p>\u2026Berserker of Black had died. Caules\u2019 Greater Holy Grail War also ended here. The Command Spells on his right hand had disappeared after having all been used up. His connection to this war had been completely severed.</p><p>He felt a pain that was bitterer than he had imagined gouging through his chest. Even so, Caules had intended to resolve himself as a magus should. He might die, he might be killed or kill in turn, and at worst, all his other clan members including his older sister might be killed\u2014he had been prepared for that.</p><p>Right now, what was gouging through his chest were thoughts of a completely different kind. It was a pain he hadn\u2019t even imagined until he summoned his Servant and fought in the war. He hadn\u2019t thought that Berserker\u2019s death would carve such a deep wound inside his heart.</p><p>\u2018I wasn\u2019t able to do anything for her.\u2019</p><p>Her wish was something that could be granted by the Holy Grail. She possessed exceptionally high reason for the Berserker class and, more than anything else, she was an easy-to-handle Servant.</p><p>He hated himself for having thought she was just someone who shared mutual interest in obtaining the Holy Grail during those short few days. She was a precious comrade who had established a bond and fought together with him. No, she had become such a comrade to him.</p><p>That\u2019s why her death was so sad.</p><p>But the past could never be changed\u2014and a Servant that went back to the [Throne] could never return either.</p><p>The girl, who, despite having the appearance of a human, had been forced to be a monster, had only the meager wish of wanting a being of the same kind as her\u2014[someone] whom she could love and who would love her back.</p><p>Caules simply regretted that he hadn\u2019t been able to grant her wish.</p><p>Saber of Red was heavily wounded, but it wasn\u2019t enough to hinder her fighting movements as long as Shishigou Kairi applied healing magecraft right away. In other words, just as Caules had said, the use of Berserker of Black\u2019s Noble Phantasm could be considered extremely meaningless as an attack.</p><p>But this Noble Phantasm had one other hidden ability. There was a paragraph in Frankenstein\u2019s blueprints that even Caules hadn\u2019t paid attention to. There, it was written thus.</p><p>\u2018This lightning attack is not simply lightning, but rather a power that has Frankenstein\u2019s will imbedded within it. As long as it exists, she will never perish.\u2019</p><p>At the same time as the lightning attack turned the surrounding area to rubble, Sieg, who had been lying on the ground there, received a sudden shock to his heart. It suddenly contracted and expanded. The blood flow that should have halted resumed. The prana that Frankenstein had released was absorbed into him and blood began circulating through his entire body.</p><p>\u2014The first thing that the boy who had given himself the name Sieg felt was pain.</p><hr><p>\u201CWha\u2026!?\u201D</p><p>Even Ruler, who received knowledge concerning all Servants when she was summoned, couldn\u2019t helped but be shocked by the appearance of what appeared before her.</p><p>\u201CHmm. You over there, you\u2014aren\u2019t a Black Servant, are you? Hmm, Ruler, then?\u201D</p><p>The speaker had a clear voice like the wind, with a body so thin and light it was like a tree leaf swaying in the wind.</p><p>The green girl spun through the air and landed next to Ruler. In her hand was a large bow that didn\u2019t suit her stature.</p><p>\u201C\u2014Archer of Red.\u201D</p><p>Ruler was, of course, on guard. It was only natural after having been attacked by Lancer and (probably) Caster of Red.</p><p>But Archer of Red looked at Ruler as if doubting her and spoke.</p><p>\u201CWhat? You\u2019re a mediator, right? Don\u2019t you understand who you should be on guard against right now?\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2014No. Naturally, I understand \u2026\u201D</p><p>Those words came from the bottom of her heart. Ruler lessened her caution towards Archer somewhat. Most likely, the Red camp wasn\u2019t monolithic. At the very least, Archer and her Master didn\u2019t seem to consider Ruler a target to be killed.</p><p>Yes, right now, the one she should be on guard against wasn\u2019t her.</p><p>\u201C\u2026The second Berserker on the Black camp\u2019s side, Spartacus\u2026 huh?\u201D</p><p>Berserker of Red had been captured by Lancer of Black and forced to change Masters. In other words, despite being Berserker of Red, he was fighting the Red camp as an enemy right now.</p><p>Ruler had no issue with that. In the Holy Grail War, allied Servants turning around and becoming enemies was far from impossible.</p><p>But\u2014</p><p>\u201COoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo\u2014\u2014\u2014!!\u201D</p><p>Was this actually possible? For an instant, Ruler mistook it for a hill. Next, the thought \u2018Is that a pile of corpses?\u2019 flashed through her mind\u2014and finally, she had no choice but to arrive at a conclusion that rejected both those guesses.</p><p>\u201CBerserker\u2026 is it?\u201D</p><p>\u201CYeha. I didn\u2019t think it would become this terrible. I keep shooting and shooting at him, but his body just enlarges and reinforces itself, and now he\u2019s already forgetting his human form. To think that Berserker would go this mad.\u201D</p><p>As a related party, Archer of Red sighed as if amazed.</p><p>What stood in front of the two of them was truly a hill-like monster. If it were simply large, Ruler wouldn\u2019t have become speechless like this.</p><p>What left her at a loss for words was Berserker of Red\u2019s current state.</p><p>He had eight arms. Three of them had no bones in them, let alone joints. They were like octopus tentacles, but when they were swung, they became like whips and smashed through the enemy.</p><p>His log-like legs had multiple insect-like legs sprouting out from them, most likely to divide the weight since two legs alone couldn\u2019t support him.</p><p>His head had sunk into his neck, but upper and lower jaws like that of a Tyrannosaurus rex stuck out from the top of his shoulders.</p><p>\u2014Crying Warmonger: Howl of the Wounded Beast.</p><p>It\u2019s already more like a kind of curse than a Noble Phantasm, Ruler thought. He lived, he moved, and more than anything else\u2026 he still sought the battlefield and victory.</p><p>Part of the damage dealt to him was converted into prana and accumulated to raise his abilities. Most likely, that also included his ability to heal. He received damage, converted it into prana, raised his abilities, and used self-healing. There wasn\u2019t even any room for his Master to intervene.</p><p>The problem was that this form of recycling continued revolving to the point that it was abnormal. Due to his healing ability going out of control, his body broke away from its proper form. And yet his abilities kept being raised due to receiving damage, and so his body rapidly transformed into a grotesque form.</p><p>Height and weight were the easiest factors to use to conjecture the strength of humans. Even those called Heroic Spirits\u2014almost all had the same basic human form.</p><p>But Berserker of Red had already discarded that. Eight arms were stronger than two. If his weight was too great to support, then just increase the number of legs.</p><p>To the mad warrior who believed in the creed that victory came closer, not farther, the more one was wounded, a situation of this degree was probably trifling.</p><p>\u201CThere, you, are\u2014!!\u201D</p><p>Five eyes, located in various places on Berserker\u2019s shoulders, neck and abdomen, all turned to glare at Archer of Red and Ruler. The two female Servants instantly separated to the left and right respectively as if flicked away. Not caring about that, Berserker of Red swung his sword with all his might.</p><p>Pieces of the ground that he blew away and smashed apart flew at Ruler and Archer like high-explosive projectiles.</p><p>\u201CGuh\u2014!\u201D</p><p>\u201CKuh\u2026!!\u201D</p><p>Rocks tore through their skin and even damaged part of Ruler\u2019s armor. An attack without prana accompanying it could never harm a Servant. But prana had been loaded to the point of bursting into the sword he swung, and it had even contaminated the broken pieces of stone.</p><p>It was the same as a Servant throwing dirks with prana loaded into them\u2026 Though, it was the first time Ruler had witnessed of the phenomenon of prana clinging even to fragments smashed apart with a sword.</p><p>\u201CHmm. It seems I ended up dragging you into this. Forgive me, Ruler.\u201D</p><p>Ruler gently shook her head at Archer of Red\u2019s apology.</p><p>\u201CNo, I have a lot of experience with trifles like this\u2026 However, due to my position, I won\u2019t be facing him as an enemy either. Since any damage he does is limited to this battlefield.\u201D</p><p>\u201CHmm. Well, I have no complaints in regards to that, but\u2014\u201D</p><p>Archer of Red looked at Ruler with a sour expression. Ruler\u2019s face stiffened at the sudden chill that came upon her.</p><p>\u201C\u2026What is it?\u201D</p><p>\u201CIt\u2019s an order from my Master. I\u2019m to immediately withdraw from here.\u201D</p><p>\u201CUmm, you couldn\u2019t mean\u2026\u201D</p><p>After sighing, Archer of Red patted Ruler on the shoulder as if to console her.</p><p>\u201CSorry about this, but I leave the rest to you.\u201D</p><p>\u201CWai\u2014\u201D</p><p>Archer of Red, Atalanta, one of the heroes in Greek legend who were boasted of being swift runners. Her feet weren\u2019t something that even Ruler could chase after.</p><p>Before Ruler even opened her mouth to say \u201CAh\u201D, Archer had disappeared into the forest\u2014it wasn\u2019t that she went into spiritual form; she just ran off.</p><p>Ruler silently looked up. There stood a grotesque-looking hero\u2026 no, creature. Berserker aimed his gladius, which was now needle-sized compared to his body, at Ruler.</p><p>That\u2019s right. Berserker of Red\u2014Spartacus was a fighter who rebels against all those with power. Ruler was no exception to that.</p><p>\u201C\u2026I\u2019ve been had.\u201D</p><p>Archer had no animosity towards her. But her Master seemed to have a different opinion.</p><p>The \u2018someone\u2019 she had to meet had already reached the Hanging Gardens. How should she chase after them\u2026? It would have been nice if she had wings that could let her fly.</p><p>However, staying here meant that she would have to fight Berserker of Red, Spartacus. Should she invoke her \u2018privilege\u2019?</p><p>No, he wouldn\u2019t stop unless he was ordered to die. Eliminating other Servants was something that Ruler shouldn\u2019t fundamentally do. Then should she withdraw? That was also another option that she could hardly call desirable. If she were alone, she might have withdrawn from here. But there was someone else she had left on this battlefield. A boy, who was small and weak, yet had a soul that was sturdy like steel.</p><p>At the very least, she had to join up with him, but right now he seemed to be talking with the homunculi back at the rear lines. Most likely in order to save his fellow homunculi, even if it meant doing so alone. Until that was finished, he wouldn\u2019t leave this battlefield.</p><p>In that case, she only had one remaining option.</p><p>\u201C\u2014Buy time, huh?\u201D</p><p>Now that she had lost both the options to retreat and counterattack, the only thing Ruler could do was non-aggressive defence. If she protected herself, Servants from either the Black or Red camp would most likely have to repel him.</p><p>That was the optimistic scenario. In the worst case, neither the Black nor Red Servants would come to help her, instead waiting for Ruler and Berserker to take each other out.</p><p>This feeling of everyone turning against her. This situation, which would probably freeze the spine of a normal person, felt nostalgic to Ruler.</p><p>Scorn, hate, ridicule\u2014even after receiving all those things, her faith had never wavered. To Ruler, who didn\u2019t even have a Master to fight alongside, being alone was normal.</p><p>\u2026No, I\u2019m not alone.</p><p>Though his goals were different, there was a boy who fought without seeking the Holy Grail. There was someone who knew her and had walked alongside her\u2026 Right now, that might be enough for her.</p><p>Berserker of Red howled\u2014and Ruler readied her holy flag, saying, \u201CCome at me.\u201D</p><p>Right before he swung down his gladius, Ruler repelled it with her holy flag. Two of his whip arms attacked her\u2014and she blocked them both. But then, the third one, which had hidden behind them, swung at her\u2014!</p><p>\u201CUgh, kuh\u2014!!\u201D</p><p>She received a direct hit. She was blown away and rolled across the ground. Luckily, the Dragon Tooth Warriors who had been ordered to kill her acted as cushions for her. In compensation for bringing her to a stop, a row of three of them was smashed apart; she would have flown to the edge of the battlefield if not for that. That attack technique been done through Berserker\u2019s physical strength that was so great it was hard to believe and his prana that he had kept stockpiling.</p><p>No, perhaps the attack just now\u2026 shouldn\u2019t be called a \u2018technique\u2019.</p><p>As she stood up, Ruler wiped blood from her lips. Ruler kept a backup of the body she was possessing\u2014of Laeticia\u2019s body. When she achieved her objective or if she was killed midway through the war, at that instant, Laeticia\u2019s body would return to its original form as recorded in the backup and, depending on the situation, would be forcefully transported somewhere safe. With that process, no matter how many wounds this body received, it would immediately regenerate.</p><p>Therefore, it could be said there was no problem no matter how wounded she became, but\u2026 if she had received the blow just now while defenceless, she would have died.</p><p>As if having seen through her doubts, a pillar of light rained down from the sky.</p><p>\u201CWha\u2026!?\u201D</p><p>The seven-colored light, which would have seemed beautiful if this weren\u2019t a battlefield, was aimed not at Ruler, but at\u2014</p><p>\u201COOOOOOOOOOOOOOoooooooooOOOOOOOOOOOOO!?\u201D</p><p>A howl that was mixed with both anguish and joy. Berserker of Red had received damage, and as a result his Noble Phantasm began healing the flesh that had been torn apart. But even the hero of rebellion Spartacus would probably soon be at his limit.</p><p>\u2026No, he had already crossed over his limits. He had endured, endured, and endured every possible torture. All that was left was for him to spit it back out\u2014</p><p>Instantly, Ruler understood the Red camp\u2019s aim in firing that pillar of light from the sky and Berserker\u2019s own aim.</p><p>What this howling man aimed to destroy were oppressors and their vassals\u2026 In other words\u2026</p><p>\u201CHe intends to destroy everything here\u2026!!\u201D</p><p>Of course, the members of the Red camp were not an exception to that, but they were within the floating fortress. It was impossible for Berserker to go to a domain where his hands couldn\u2019t reach.</p><p>The Dragon Tooth Warriors were simply rank-and-file soldiers to the Red camp. They had no intention of mourning the lives of mere artificial constructs.</p><p>On the other hand, the problem was the Black camp. This was probably an unanticipated situation for them as well. Who could have imagined that Crying Warmonger was such a malignant Noble Phantasm?</p><p>The abundant prana that Berserker had accumulated and his body that had been transformed by it were already beyond the binds of the Servant contract. Even using Command Spells, which even Heroic Spirits with A rank Magic Resistance could only endure a single one at a time, probably wouldn\u2019t work on him.</p><p>Because Command Spells were shackles placed on those below by those above. No matter how low one\u2019s rank was as a magus, as long as one was a Master, their position was superior to their Servant\u2019s.</p><p>With the hero of rebellion Spartacus, an order probably wouldn\u2019t be obeyed unless two Command Spells were used even in his normal state. In this situation, even using three Command Spells on him probably wouldn\u2019t work.</p><p>Yes, in other words, Berserker of Red wouldn\u2019t stop. Assuming he swung his next blow with all his might, the damage would most likely extend across this entire battlefield. On the contrary, even the Fortress of Millennia, which lay between the town and the battlefield, wouldn\u2019t be able to escape damage either.</p><p>Now then, what should I do\u2014as Ruler wavered over her next course of action, she received a revelation. She felt numbing pain course through her Command Spells.</p><p>Astonished, Ruler looked off towards a certain direction. Even without being able to grasp it by sight, she could sense it from that overwhelming amount of prana.</p><p>Servant parameters were rewritten. It applied to two Servants. One was changed from being listed as healthy to dead, and the other went from a dying state to\u2014</p><hr><p>There was once a hero. A great hero who killed a dragon.</p><p>Flawless and perfect in all aspects, he was an impeccable great hero. A man whom everyone adored, seeking his power and asking requests of him.</p><p>I was\u2014happy, the hero thought. That didn\u2019t change until just before he died. He neither yielded to overwhelming power nor lost to despair.</p><p>The only thing he received were words and songs of blessing and praise. From the moment he was born till his death. That had never changed, the hero thought.</p><p>The very last wish that was asked of the perfect hero, to whom others continued to make requests, was his own death.</p><p>A request that he carried out ended up coming back to him as punishment. His brother-in-law loved a certain woman and requested that the hero make her capitulate, and so it was settled by having the hero embrace that woman as his proxy. That may not have been a crime, but it wasn\u2019t behavior that could be praised either.</p><p>Due to knowledge of this spreading around, the hero wounded the woman\u2019s honor. He wounded the woman\u2019s pride. And she wasn\u2019t an ordinary woman, but the queen of a country. As a result, he sensed that it would cause a terrible conflict\u2014and so he spoke to the man who he had once called a friend and with whom he should have exchanged cups of brotherhood.</p><p>\u201CAh, the situation is beyond my control. Hagen, I am invincible and so have never once been wounded by you. But even so, if I don\u2019t have you kill me\u2026\u201D</p><p>The man who was once his friend granted the hero\u2019s wish. He tenaciously searched and found out the hero\u2019s weak point, crafted a plan knowing fully well that it was a cowardly act, and aimed for the hero\u2019s back as he drank water. Even while knowing that, the hero stopped himself from resisting.</p><p>Without leaving behind any unseemly figure or stupidity, the hero died as a tragic hero who received a sneak attack due to trickery. His former friend became widely known as a rare villain who had killed the hero through foul play.</p><p>Properly speaking, the story ended here. It should have become a tale where the conflict was resolved and the hero alone died a noble death.</p><p>\u2026But it led to the worst of situations that was beyond what the hero had expected.</p><p>The woman who was the hero\u2019s wife burned with the flames of revenge and, as a result, many men died.</p><p>It was surely because the hero was loved by and befriended everyone. He probably couldn\u2019t truly understand something like a deep-rooted and blind love\u2026 a passionate love that repays the murder of one\u2019s loved one with twice the payback.</p><p>Or perhaps it was because he repeatedly responded to the requests made of him. Perhaps the woman who loved him thought he wouldn\u2019t do something if it wasn\u2019t requested of him.</p><p>As a result, his wish wasn\u2019t granted right until the very end. For the hero who had acted neither to defeat evil nor do good, but instead specialized in simply \u2018granting the requests of others\u2019, it was probably an inevitable conclusion.</p><p>But, right as he was on the verge of death, the hero had a faint thought. As he was confronted with death, \u2018what he wanted to do\u2019 finally became clear to him.</p><p>I lived and died as a hero. I have no regrets about that in itself. I can declare that there was not a single disagreeable thing in my life.</p><p>Even so, I can\u2019t help but think. If I weren\u2019t a prince, if I were just an ordinary man.</p><p>Wouldn\u2019t I have been able to earnestly pursue my own will?</p><p>It doesn\u2019t matter if I\u2019m not acknowledged by anyone. I don\u2019t mind if I\u2019m not praised by anyone. I want to acknowledge myself. I want to have pride in myself. There lies what I sought. What I wished for.</p><p>I want to stand on the side of what I believe in. If I could do that, then surely\u2014I would be able to live with my chest puffed up proudly.</p><p>I won\u2019t fight for the sake of someone else. I won\u2019t fight for my own sake either.</p><p>For the sake of the benevolence that I believe in, the justice I believe in, the loyalty I believe in, and the love I believe in. I will take hold of this sword and fight with this body.</p><p>That is my dream, my wish.</p><p>I\u2014\u2014want to be an ally of justice.</p><hr><p>The strong pain running through the back of his left hand forcibly brought Sieg back to consciousness.</p><p>\u201CUgh\u2026\u201D</p><p>The pain, like that of a smoldering iron being pushed against his hand, gradually started to abate. It appeared that he was alive. Feeling pain probably meant he was alive.</p><p>However, this wasn\u2019t the battlefield he had returned to along with Ruler. He felt the sensation of touching a cold and hard rock surface. It seemed\u2014he had come back to that place he had visited once before.</p><p>Perhaps worried about the vivid pain just now, Sieg unconsciously glanced at his left hand.</p><p>\u201CWh, at\u2026?</p><p>He shivered. Sieg had been born possessing basic knowledge about the Holy Grail War. Therefore, it was natural that he felt so shocked it blew the pain out of his mind.</p><p>\u201CImpossible, these are\u2026!\u201D</p><p>On the back of his left hand were three patterns. He naturally understood what they were. These were the proof of being a Master in the Holy Grail War\u2014that is, Command Spells.</p><p>No, they were slightly different from normal Command Spells. It was natural for the patterns of the Command Spells to differ depending on the Master, but they should always be dyed a red color. But these ones were black instead.</p><p>Standing out on the surface of Sieg\u2019s white skin, the black patterns somehow seemed repulsive.</p><p>Suddenly, he felt the presence of a giant creature behind him. He was paralyzed with fear that numbed the tips of his hands and feet. His reason told him that he mustn\u2019t turn around. He tried not to be conscious of the sound and smell of the raw and deep breaths behind him.</p><p>But\u2014the thing behind him definitely held malice towards him.</p><p>He had to fight it. He had to pick up a sword and fight it. And an ordinary sword was no good. Even the sword he had received from Rider of Black was no good.</p><p>What he needed was a magic sword that could even \u2018slay a dragon\u2019. A blade so great it was extolled and had carved its name into legend.</p><p>\u2014Stupid. Where could you find something like that?</p><p>\u2014Stupid. You already have it.</p><p>The thoughts that appeared in his mind were easily overturned by a whisper.</p><p>\u2026In his right hand was a sword hilt. The blade itself was halfway stuck in the ground. It seemed he had to pull this out. In order to defeat the creature behind him, he had to pull out this sword\u2014</p><p>Sieg didn\u2019t hesitate. He gripped the hilt tightly and tried to pull it out at once.</p><p>\u201CKuh\u2026!\u201D</p><p>But it wouldn\u2019t budge. Even when he used all his might, it wouldn\u2019t move a single millimeter. It was as if the blade was being held there tightly by someone.</p><p>If he didn\u2019t pull it out, he would die. When he saw the repulsive thing that shouldn\u2019t exist in this world, his body would be destroyed and his spirit would die. That would definitely happen if he didn\u2019t obtain the means to oppose it.</p><p>\u2014This sword can\u2019t be pulled out by you.</p><p>\u2014But, if it\u2019s you, you can do it.</p><p>The Command Spells on his left hand flickered ominously\u2026 Command Spells contained abundant amounts of prana. They could overturn even the laws of nature and reproduce all possible phenomena with magic, even crossing into a domain close to that of sorcery.</p><p>In that case, what power was necessary to pull out this blade?</p><p>\u2014The one who it is requested of isn\u2019t you.</p><p>\u2014The one who wishes for it isn\u2019t you.</p><p>\u2026The answer had already been given to him. The heart he had received, the abundant prana he had obtained when he was revived. And the black Command Spells that had appeared on his hand.</p><p>All of it piled up. All of it began to advance in a single direction.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t oppose it. He didn\u2019t intend to either. Even if this might be a path that someone else had given him, he didn\u2019t mind.</p><p>\u2014This is the path I choose.</p><p>\u2014This is the path you chose.</p><p>I see. Then\u2026</p><p>\u201C\u2026I order this body of mine with a Command Spell.\u201D</p><p>One of the Command Spells started shining white. Along with the light that swelled up, Sieg\u2019s body changed. The information of a Heroic Spirit was downloaded into his body. Physical information was expressed, battle experience was stored and accumulated, personal abilities were embodied, and even Noble Phantasms were reproduced.</p><p>But even a Command Spell could only reproduce that miracle for a short time.</p><p>A hundred and eighty seconds. That was the time limit of reproducing a Heroic Spirit with a Command Spell. After that time limit passed, Siegfried would return to being Sieg.</p><p>That\u2019s fine, he thought. Even three minutes is enough if this body can be of use to him, if this body can become the power to save them.</p><p>He didn\u2019t have an ounce of hesitation in him. As long as what he needed to hold in his hand was there. He would happily accept even ruin, decay and a miserable death.</p><p>What was essential wasn\u2019t putting strength in his right hand, but his will, and so he easily pulled out the sword. He returned to the hell overflowing with light.</p><p>Lastly, thinking he should at least see the form of the monster, he turned around\u2014and he saw, for some reason, himself standing still there.</p><p>\u2026He decided to leave thinking about this event for later. Right now, there was something he had to do. Sieg stopped thinking and chose to simply advance forward.</p><p>It was just a short three minutes. But even if it was just a short three minutes, the reproduction was perfect. In terms of physical abilities, Sieg had been perfectly reproduced as Saber of Black.</p><p>On his back was the Phantasmal Greatsword, Balmung. Covering his body here and there was silver armor. His chest had greatly expanded, exposing skin that was dyed brown with the blood of a dragon. That skin was composed of dragon scales that wouldn\u2019t be wounded by any blade or any spell. All except for a single part in the middle of his back\u2026</p><p>What accomplished this miracle was the curse of a dragon, and what allowed that transformation was the heart of a dragon. Therefore, their name was Dead Count Shapeshifter: Dragon Revelation Command Spells. A life crystalized in a hundred and eighty seconds, approaching death each time one was used.</p><p>Thus, a hero of legend\u2014the \u2018dragon-slayer\u2019 returned to stand on the earth.</p><p><img src="https://i.lensdump.com/i/1moAHc.webp" alt=""></p><hr><p>It was an impact so strong that every Servant on the battlefield sensed it and froze. Just when it seemed that the abundant prana dispersed as if having exploded, a tremendous \u2018something\u2019 was born.</p><p>Rider of Red and Archer of Black, who were facing each other intensely, put a temporary hold to their battle and ran out of the forest\u2014</p><p>Caster of Black suspended his control over the golems.</p><p>Lancer of Black and Lancer of Red turned their gaze to the \u2018something\u2019 even while remaining cautious of each other.</p><p>Archer of Red stopped running and looked at the \u2018something\u2019 with a dumbfounded expression.</p><p>Caster and Assassin of Red were unable to hide their shock either.</p><p>Even Berserker of Red stopped moving for an instant.</p><p>Saber of Red, even while doubting what had happened before her very eyes, sent an urgent telepathic communication to her Master.</p><p>\u2018Hey, Master.\u2019</p><p>\u2018What?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Let me confirm. All the Black Servants have been summoned already, right!?\u2019</p><p>\u2018They should be.\u2019</p><p>\u2018\u2026Then who\u2019s this guy standing in front of me!?\u2019</p><p>\u2018\u2026I\u2019m looking at him from the eyes of an owl, but he seems to be a Servant.\u2019</p><p>\u2018As far as I can see, he isn\u2019t Archer, Lancer, Rider, Berserker, Caster, or let alone Assassin. He\u2019s a Saber, the same Saber class as me. What\u2019s the meaning of this\u2026!?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Hmm. Well, this is the Great Holy Grail War. Such things also happen.\u2019</p><p>Shishigou said that in a light tone, and continued speaking without giving the confused Saber any time to give a rebuttal.</p><p>\u2018Go and crush him. I\u2019ve finished healing almost all of your wounds. Even if your opponent is a Saber, he\u2019s irregular\u2026 A normal Servant shouldn\u2019t lose against an abnormal one. Right?\u2019</p><p>Understanding his words, Saber of Red discarded her doubts. She spoke in a light tone that matched Shishigou\u2019s.</p><p>\u2018\u2026I somehow feel like you\u2019re smoothly taunting me, though.\u2019</p><p>\u2018What, I don\u2019t really mind if you retreat. You should do what you want. What, do you want to retreat? Then shall I use another Command Spell to get you out of there?\u2019</p><p>\u2018\u2014Ah, damn it. You\u2019re taunting me, you\u2019re definitely taunting me! But I\u2019ll do it! I\u2019ll do it. If my father was here, he definitely wouldn\u2019t choose to retreat!\u2019</p><p>Saber of Red swung her silver sword, clustering her uplifted battle spirit\u2014and advanced forward to attack the man who looked like Saber of Black.</p><p>And meanwhile, Rider of Black, most likely the only one on this battlefield who understood everything, desperately tried to hold back tears at the corners of his eyes. But he couldn\u2019t stop himself, and so he quietly wept.</p><p>That wasn\u2019t Saber of Black. Saber had definitely vanished back then.</p><p>Then who was that standing there? Who was that facing Saber of Red and gripping a sword in his hands?</p><p>It was obvious; he could only be one person. Rider of Black didn\u2019t know how such an astounding thing had happened, and he didn\u2019t care how either.</p><p>Rider simply regretted that \u2018he\u2019 hadn\u2019t chosen a peaceful life, and cried at the path of hardship \u2018he\u2019 had chosen instead. In life, Rider had never once lamented his own weakness. But right now, he lamented. His weakness, his words and deeds, his decisions had led \u2018him\u2019 astray here.</p><p>\u201C\u2014I\u2019m sorry.\u201D</p><p>In truth, Rider of Black didn\u2019t have something that could be called a wish to make upon the Holy Grail. \u2018Maybe I should ask to be incarnated so that I can enjoy a second life\u2019\u2014that was all he thought of wishing for, at best. Therefore, if any of the other Black Servants had an extremely serious wish, he had thought he would happily turn the Grail over to them.</p><p>But now it was different. He had a wish he wanted to cling to even if he had to defeat the others. He wanted to save \u2018him\u2019. He wanted to save the boy who had desperately whispered [Help me] in a hoarse voice.</p><p>But he wasn\u2019t able to. A lonely sorrow painfully gripped Rider of Black.</p><p>With a calm attitude, Saber of Red took a step forward to attack. Saber of Black gripped his sword and chose to fight her. But his gaze lay on Rider of Black where he rested at Saber of Red\u2019s feet.</p><p>\u201C\u2014Are you okay?\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2026Idiot.\u201D</p><p>He seems well, Sieg, who had become Saber of Black, thought with relief. Now he just had to defeat Saber with this Saber\u2019s power.</p><p>\u201C\u2026Yo, fake Saber.\u201D</p><p>Saber of Red\u2019s snickered beneath her helmet. Sieg, even though he felt the same heavy pressure from her as before, realized that he wasn\u2019t afraid. In spite of being hit by a fighting spirit that even seemed to have its own mass, his mind didn\u2019t waver at all.</p><p>\u201CIt\u2019s true that I\u2019m a fake just as you say. But this sword and this power are beyond a doubt the real thing. There is nothing insufficient for me to be your opponent. If anything is insufficient, it\u2019s only my spirit.\u201D</p><p>\u201CIs that so? Then\u2014how about I test it out!\u201D</p><p>In an instant, Saber of Red closed the distance between them. With steps so nimble it was hard to believe considering her extremely heavy-built armor, she tried to slash Sieg diagonally from the shoulder down.</p><p>That wild yet precise and peerless attack was truly worthy of the name of a hero. So, if he could parry this attack, she would regard him as a Servant\u2014Saber of Red swung her sword with such thoughts.</p><p>Sieg didn\u2019t parry it, nor evade or sidestep it. Amazingly, he took a step forward and blocked it by holding out his gauntlet.</p><p>Saber of Red widened her eyes in shock. What was that frighteningly strong toughness just now? Even a Servant\u2019s armor shouldn\u2019t be strong enough to remain uncut after receiving her slash.</p><p>No, her blade had cut through the gauntlet and reached his skin. But what she couldn\u2019t cut through wasn\u2019t the gauntlet, but the skin. Unbelievably, Saber of Black\u2019s skin was tougher than steel\u2026!</p><p>Even Saber of Red, who had anticipated all his possible actions, needed a little time to recover from that shock. Even though her instincts warned her, her body couldn\u2019t react in that instant.</p><p>It was unfortunate that Saber of Black had to block the sword with one hand in order to create that opening in Saber\u2019s guard. Even if he used his full strength, a one-handed sword slash was slightly inferior in power compared to a two-handed slash.</p><p>Even so, the impact was enormous. As Saber of Red stumbled backwards in retreat, Saber of Black swung his blade in pursuit of her.</p><p>The ringing of blades resounded and blood danced through the air. Saber of Black was easily brandishing that huge sword. No, he wasn\u2019t simply swinging it with all his might. There was technique in his swings. The instant the two blade edges touched, his sword coiled around the other blade like a snake.</p><p>Saber of Red\u2019s sword was on the verge of being knocked away skywards. She immediately put strength into her hands holding the sword hilt and stopped it from happening. But her torso had once more become open\u2014and Saber of Black didn\u2019t miss that opening.</p><p>His next attack was a fully-powered horizontal swing with both his hands gripping his sword.</p><p>With her full-body armor unable to absorb the impact, Saber of Red couldn\u2019t brace herself and was sent flying far away.</p><p>Even as she slid across the ground, Saber of Red somehow managed to fix her posture and stand back up. But she was hit by a sharp pain, and she pressed a hand to her abdomen while groaning.</p><p>\u201C\u2026Ah, damn it. He really is a Servant, that bastard.\u201D</p><p>Saber of Black\u2019s slash had been quite skillful and clever. It was an attack that hadn\u2019t simply relied on power like Berserker\u2019s had, but instead efficiently destroyed a person\u2019s body without any emotion at all. And the way he had flicked away her weapon as a lead up to his attack was also excellent.</p><p>In other words, he wasn\u2019t simply wearing the shell of Saber of Black. It was obvious that he had inherited even the hero\u2019s abundant accumulated battle experience.</p><p>The exceptional battle sense that Servants possessed\u2014especially those of the most powerful Saber class\u2014this homunculus did indeed possess it!</p><p>Suddenly the pain in her flank vanished\u2014her Master had applied healing magecraft. It appeared he had gotten close enough on the battlefield to watch her battle. He was mostly like hiding somewhere on the battlefield. Though she had no idea how he could hide anywhere with that huge body of his.</p><p>\u2018Hey, Master. Be careful, if you approach too close\u2026\u2019</p><p>\u2018Well, I know, but I can react more quickly if I watch with my own eyes than if I rely on the danger sense from the Line that connects us\u2026 Well, I also honestly want to run away, though.\u2019</p><p>He was leaking out idle complaints. Saber of Red imperiously stomped on the ground as if he were grumbling right beside her.</p><p>\u2018Hey, Master. Do you have so little faith in me!?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I mean, after all, Saber of Black\u2014is strong, you know?\u2019</p><p>Shishigou smoothly spoke the harsh truth. Faced with that unhesitating answer, Saber of Red was more speechless than angry.</p><p>\u2018By my rough assessment, he\u2019s almost even with you in terms of stats. To make it worse, he has some kind of troublesome special defensive-type Noble Phantasm or skill. In other words, he\u2019s better than you in terms of defence in a straight up match.\u2019</p><p>Shishigou indifferently spoke the facts and the things he had gleamed from them.</p><p>\u2018\u2026Yeah, even though I cut through his gauntlet, his skin blocked my blade.\u2019</p><p>That was abnormal. Something had clearly obstructed her blade. It couldn\u2019t be some spell by a Master. She was able to normally cut through his armor, so in other words, there must be some secret to that body of his.</p><p>\u2018There are a lot of heroes throughout the world who are said to be immortal and invulnerable. But there aren\u2019t that many heroes who actually have immortal bodies. There should be a stipulation of [However, there is one exception] in all legends of immortality.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Heh\u2026 So, what\u2019s his weak point?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Well, you\u2019re going to have to do your best to find that out!\u2019</p><p>\u2018Shit, I knew it was going to be that way!\u2019</p><p>\u2018But let me give you a proposal, from a Master to his Servant. How about I strengthen you with a Command Spell for as long as you\u2019re fighting Saber of Black?\u2019</p><p>Shishigou\u2019s proposal slightly deviated from the proper way to use a Command Spell. Normally, a Command Spell was used in a more narrowly defined way. For example, a spatial jump equivalent to sorcery, or an impossibly precise attack aimed at a single exact point. If not used in such precisely defined ways, the binding force of the Command Spell would weaken.</p><p>Using the Command Spell in the way Shishigou proposed would probably raise Saber\u2019s power to its max, but that was all. However\u2014</p><p>\u2018No, that\u2019s an excellent idea, Master. With that, my slashes will cut through him. I swear this upon the name of Saber.\u2019</p><p>Saber of Red\u2019s instincts whispered to her. It wasn\u2019t that her slash just now didn\u2019t receive any feedback or was obstructed by another power. The target was purely hard and sturdy. In that case, if she continuously used attacks that were stronger than the one just now, she was confident that she would cut through. If the back-up from the Command Spell was narrowed down to her battle with Saber of Black on this battlefield, it definitely shouldn\u2019t be a foolish plan.</p><p>\u2018I see, then\u2026 I\u2019ll believe in you, Saber.\u2019</p><p>I\u2019ll believe in you\u2014Just by hearing those words, the anger she had felt towards him earlier was completely blown away and an uplifting feeling swelled up in her chest. She was amazed at her own simplicity, but right now, it was pleasant.</p><p>\u2018Yeah\u2026 yeah! Understood, Master.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I order my swordsman with a Command Spell. Use all your power to defeat Saber of Black on this battlefield!\u2019</p><p>An abundant amount of prana surged through the Line connecting them. It was taken into her body at its terminus, and flowed throughout her entire body through her Magic Circuits\u2014</p><p>\u2018That wish shall be granted! In the name of Saber of Red and of Mordred, I will definitely defeat Saber of Black!\u2019</p><p>Instantly, Saber released and emitted her prana. Her appearance was just like that of a steam locomotive in human form. While fiercely emitting the steam known as prana, she readied her sword. She had no fear; there was only a pure and immaculate fighting spirit.</p><p>Words were unnecessary after that. There was no room for negotiation between the Servants of Black and Red. Sieg had made a choice and Saber of Red had responded to it.</p><p>\u201C\u2014Here I come, Saber of Black.\u201D</p><p>In response to the silver Saber\u2019s words, the gold Saber replied.</p><p>\u201C\u2014Come, Saber of Rot.\u201D</p><p>There was no doubt or hesitation. Fear was overcome and killing intent was respectively reacted to. Reward was unnecessary and praise was needless. Each simply following their own choices, they gripped their respective swords with both hands\u2014and began running at each other.</p><p>A bullet charge accomplished through the skill [Prana Burst]. With even more power added to it due to a Command Spell, Saber of Red\u2019s attack was truly as fast as a comet dashing across the earth. Sieg\u2014Saber of Black understood that he couldn\u2019t win with speed after getting a late start, and he moved to meet her attack.</p><p>The bullet and guillotine collided head on. Petals of flames colored over the two of them. A thunderous roar rang through the battlefield with every clash within the maddeningly chaotic hurricane of weapons.</p><p>\u201CHah. Your slashes are pathetic, Saber of Black\u2026!\u201D</p><p>\u201CKuh\u2014!!\u201D</p><p>And then their swords clashed for the thirteenth time in this exchange. The two swords entangled with each other and they proceeded to a contest of pure physical strength. As such, naturally\u2014Saber of Red, with both her Prana Burst and the boost from a Command Spell, was stronger.</p><p>\u201COOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOH!\u201D</p><p>Howling, Saber of Red forcibly pushed back Saber of Black. The distance them widened\u2014and Saber of Red thrust her sword out with a fearless smile.</p><p>\u201CAnd you call yourself \u2018Saber\u2019, one who ought to be the greatest amongst all Servants? What a disappointment. Or perhaps this is as far as a fake can go?\u201D</p><p>Remaining silent, Saber of Black stood back up. The damage he had received\u2026 wasn\u2019t much, Saber of Red judged. As expected, his sturdiness wasn\u2019t normal. She had to absolutely kill him here\u2014Saber of Red hardened her resolve to do that.</p><p>\u201C\u2014O sword, let thee fill.\u201D</p><p>Saber of Black began the steps to unleash his sword. Orange light like a twilight-colored aurora borealis came out from the sword and began to dazzlingly illuminate his face.</p><p>He had activated the ace in the hole that all Servants had\u2014his Noble Phantasm.</p><p>\u201CSo you\u2019re releasing your Noble Phantasm\u2026 Hah, that\u2019s fine with me!\u201D</p><p>\u2018Go ahead, Saber. Show me your trump card Noble Phantasm!\u2019</p><p>Not even voicing any disapproval, her Master gave his permission for her to use it.</p><p>\u201C\u2014Well then, seeing as my Master has given me permission, allow me to respond in kind with my own Noble Phantasm!\u201D</p><p>At the same time as Saber of Red readied her sword, her helmet\u2019s function as a Noble Phantasm was deactivated and it was stored away within her armor. It was said that the King of Knights from Britain, Arthur Pendragon, hadn\u2019t aged during his kingship\u2026and had remained the same fair-looking boy as he\u2019d been when he pulled out the sword.</p><p>Then it was only natural that his child, Mordred\u2014also had the appearance of a delicate and even lovely-looking girl.</p><p>However, her girlish outward appearance couldn\u2019t completely hide her Berserker-like brutal personality. Her green eyes brimmed full of intoxication with violence.</p><p>At the same time as she removed her helmet, her sword also underwent a transformation. The silver blade was dyed crimson, and its form began to distort. As violent and furious sounds rang out from it, red lightning flickered through the sword\u2019s surroundings.</p><p>This phenomenon wasn\u2019t this sword\u2019s original nature. The proof of kingship that King Arthur had obtained and kept stored away, Clarent: Radiant Sword of the King\u2014the sword that Mordred had stolen and used to deal a fatal wound to King Arthur.</p><p>Its transformation into an evil sword was due to that episode in her legend. When Mordred held this sword, the sword of the king transformed into an evil sword of hatred.</p><p>\u201CIt is time for your execution. Come, meet an end worthy of an imitation, Saber of Black\u2014!\u201D</p><p>The overwhelming vortex of prana trampled the surrounding wreckage on the battlefield and rejected anything that lived. It became like this just by having the two of them begin preparing the release of their Noble Phantasms.</p><p>\u201C\u2026Here I come.\u201D</p><p>Saber of Black merely muttered that quietly.</p><p>Two heroes, who had come from the Age of Gods to the present day, who should never have crossed paths. At last, they revealed their \u2018certain-kill attacks\u2019.</p><p>\u201CClarent Blood Arthur: Rebellion Against My Beautiful Father!!\u201D</p><p>Saber of Red howled in rage.</p><p>\u201CBalmung: Phantasmal Greatsword, Felling of the Sky Demon!!\u201D</p><p>Saber of Black roared.</p><p>The orange light rose like a tide, and the red lightning plunged forward. The shining lights clashed and caused frighteningly strong raging winds with ground zero at its center.</p><p>It was like a high-pressure tornado. It engulfed the surroundings and simply continued destroying everything in its path. Not even a single piece of rubble was left behind.</p><p>\u2014And also. In the clash between Noble Phantasms, Saber of Red was slightly superior.</p><p>Between Saber of Black\u2019s Noble Phantasm, which destroyed the entire surrounding area in a wave, and Saber of Red\u2019s Noble Phantasm, which destroyed all existing material in its path in a straight line, Saber of Red\u2019s Noble Phantasm had the advantage in terms of their respective natures.</p><p>Saber of Black fell down to one knee\u2014and Saber of Red went into a fit of rage.</p><p>\u201CWhy are you still alive\u2026!?\u201D</p><p>Yes. To Saber of Red, the fact that he was still alive in the first place was in itself a problem.</p><p>To Mordred, Clarent was a weapon that possessed curse-like glory. She wouldn\u2019t permit herself to be defeated by anyone except her father, and even more, she wouldn\u2019t allow for this sword, which had delivered a fatal blow to her father, to fail to finish killing anyone.</p><p>\u201CDo not dare move, Saber of Black. I, and nobody else, will be the one to kill you\u2026!\u201D</p><p>But there was another big reason that made it worth killing Saber of Black here and now.</p><p>When their Noble Phantasms clashed, Saber of Red had noticed it. Saber of Black still wasn\u2019t in his normal condition at full power. In the first place, he had become a Servant through a ridiculous miracle by transforming with a Command Spell.</p><p>Indeed, his power was definitely equal to that of Saber of Black\u2019s, and he certainly had all of his battle experience as well.</p><p>But, it still didn\u2019t reach his mind and spirit. He was disconcerted by the act of swinging a sword. As a result, she was able to stay one step above him in everything during this battle\u2014this time, that is.</p><p>And also, without a doubt, this was the homunculus\u2019 first battle with the body of Saber of Black.</p><p>Her instincts whispered to her. She had to defeat him in this first battle while he was still inexperienced. She had to cut off his head now while the transformation had come undone.</p><p>Most likely, his resolve would be even greater when he next transformed and he would be strong enough to match her. Then, if he transformed a third time\u2014</p><p>If she was to grasp victory, she had to completely eliminate that \u2018next\u2019 chance!</p><p>I have to cut off his head and stab my sword through his heart by any means possible, or else\u2014Obeying her instincts, Saber of Red took a step forward.</p><hr><p>Assassin of Red\u2019s Fortress Noble Phantasm, Hanging Gardens of Babylon. Though on the battlefield, this fortress was the only place ruled by silence and calm.</p><p>\u201C\u2014Now then, Master. Was that part of your calculations?\u201D</p><p>She smiled nastily. Shirou Kotomine gazed down at the phenomenon that had just occurred with an unusually grim expression.</p><p>\u201CUnbelievable! Saber of Black has revived! Goodness gracious, it\u2019s a great miracle worthy of a saint! Truly, [Hang up Magic]!\u201D</p><p>In response to Caster of Red\u2019s mutterings, Shirou shook his head silently.</p><p>\u201CNo, it isn\u2019t a revival\u2026 If I had to describe it, that is closer to a possession.\u201D</p><p>\u201CA possession?\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2026Among Servants, there are also those who can cause strong effects on the bodies of their Master. Normally, the relationship between Master and Servant is the same as between owner and familiar, but there are those who possess skills that make it possible to share bodies. In those cases, the Master becomes an existence close to immortal. Of course, only for the duration of the Holy Grail War\u2026 And most importantly, it doesn\u2019t mean that their battle power increases, so the only Servant they\u2019d be able to fight is Assassin.\u201D</p><p>\u201CWait. No matter how I look at it, that there is different. He isn\u2019t a Master, and he definitely isn\u2019t a Servant.\u201D</p><p>\u201CYes. That\u2019s why it\u2019s a possession. Most likely, he\u2019s summoning Saber of Black with the abundant prana of a Command Spell. Of course, normally it would be impossible even with a Command Spell, but\u2014\u201D</p><p>Saber of Black and Saber of Red were fiercely clashing against each other. It was an impossible battle even in myth between the \u2018Dragon-Slayer Siegfried\u2019 and Saber of Red.</p><p>\u201CThat homunculus alone is an exception. He has something connected to Saber of Black within his body. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a part of Saber\u2019s body or a holy relic of his. In any case, by using that as an intermediary, he\u2019s making Saber descend from the Throne into his own flesh.\u201D</p><p>\u201CImpossible\u2026 We\u2019re not such low-class evil spirits. We\u2019re Heroic Spirits, you know? The purity, density, strength, solidity and every other aspect of our souls are completely different. Something like possessing someone\u2019s physical body and giving them a Heroic Spirit\u2019s abilities is impossible.\u201D</p><p>Assassin of Red was correct. If Shirou\u2019s words were right, then that was a \u2018shell\u2019, a being who wore the body of Saber of Black. But that was impossible. The physical abilities, magical abilities and, of course, the soul of Saber of Black\u2014no, of any being that was called a Heroic Spirit was incomparable to that of a human\u2019s.</p><p>\u201CIf a body is possessed by a Heroic Spirit, a human\u2019s soul wouldn\u2019t be able to endure it. To say nothing of the soul of a homunculus like him.\u201D</p><p>\u201CIt\u2019s precisely because he is a homunculus. Their souls are very young and therefore pure, as such they won\u2019t be dyed by anything, and their bodies can endure any kind of transformation as well.\u201D</p><p>In the first place, a homunculus was a \u2018molded\u2019 entity using Magic Circuits as the foundation. Since they had no accumulated experience like humans did, their souls were pure and sturdy like an infant\u2019s. A human who had lived twenty years would have twenty years\u2019 worth of accumulated experience, and that experience would sometimes produce magnificent strength under critical duress.</p><p>But, when you possessed another person\u2019s body, that accumulated experience became jammed and obstructed as if by white blood cells. That other person\u2019s accumulated years of experience and your own accumulated years of experience would clash due to lack of compatibility.</p><p>However, the homunculus was different. He had no accumulated experience. He was merely a being created in an already-matured state. Therefore, there was no rejection when he was being possessed.</p><p>\u201C\u2026Though, being possessed by a Heroic Spirit for even one second is equivalent to a miracle. Even with the assistance of a Command Spell, he should only be able to maintain it for a few minutes.\u201D</p><p>\u201CIn other words, you mean this? \u2014That thing is something that we can ignore.\u201D</p><p>Shirou nodded. Certainly, Saber of Black\u2019s revival was astounding. But it was another matter if it was limited by time and number of uses. Even if he still had the maximum number of Command Spells left, he still had only two remaining. He was basically worthless. He probably wasn\u2019t accustomed to battle itself either, so it was hard to say that he perfectly displayed Saber of Black\u2019s true specs.</p><p>And yet. That homunculus\u2019 existence\u2014is awfully irritating to me.</p><p>All those gathered on this battlefield were chess pieces to Shirou. Whether it was those facing him as enemies, those who were his allies, or even himself, everyone was a piece on the board.</p><p>But he alone was clearly different. An unintended piece had suddenly revived and struck the board. Perhaps the growing irritation in his chest was due to that. Or perhaps\u2014</p><p>\u201C\u2026How foolish. Even if he\u2019d have an ephemerally short lifespan, it\u2019d be far better to try and be a perfect existence.\u201D</p><p>Shirou\u2019s whisper didn\u2019t seem to reach anyone\u2019s ears. Assassin of Red questioned Shirou.</p><p>\u201CWell, if that\u2019s the case, he\u2019s not a problem then. More importantly, Shirou, if you don\u2019t hurry up and get to work soon, you won\u2019t make it in time, you know? Ruler has also come to this battlefield. Right now all her energy is devoted to dealing with Berserker, but if she manages to reach these gardens, it\u2019ll be the end of the line for you.\u201D</p><p>\u201CYes, I\u2019ve already received permission from them\u2026 All that\u2019s left is the transfer ritual with the agreement of both parties. It\u2019s an easy procedure\u2026 I have to conduct the transfer, so I will need a bit of time, though.\u201D</p><p>\u201CHmm, if I obstruct her with those three, I\u2019ll be able to buy some time.\u201D</p><p>\u201CGood luck then\u201D\u2014Leaving behind those words with a refreshing smile, Shirou departed. The only ones remaining there were the two Servants who respected him as their Master.</p><p>\u201CBy the way, Caster. Since we have the fortune of being alone together, there\u2019s one thing I\u2019d like to ask you.\u201D</p><p>\u201CAh, I also have something I need to ask. Then, please go ahead first, revered empress.\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2014What are you scheming?\u201D</p><p>While smiling sweetly, Assassin of Red struck to the heart of the matter with cruel and ruthless emotion in her eyes. They were similar to the eyes of a snake ascertaining its prey.</p><p>And Caster of Red saw those eyes, but instead of breaking out in a cold sweat, he merely tilted his head curiously in response. He clearly possessed no ordinary nerves as well. Even if he didn\u2019t have any weapons or magecraft, he had a well-functioning tongue.</p><p>\u201CNothing really. Just as I have stated, I only pursue our Master\u2019s\u2026 Shirou Kotomine\u2019s fleeting and majestic dream.\u201D</p><p>\u201CHah. So you\u2019re that kind of character, storyteller. Indeed, his dream is as fragile as glasswork and also very long. The journey to it is obstructed by many hardships, and even if he can overcome them, it\u2019s still uncertain whether or nor his wish will be granted. But\u2014if our Master should brush aside all those hardships and even reach \u2018that\u2019\u2026\u201D</p><p>\u2014It could only be called a miracle. The dream that Shirou told to Assassin of Red was something any ordinary person would laugh off as ridiculous, something that only abnormal people could seriously talk about.</p><p>\u201C\u2026Your role will cease to exist in this world.\u201D</p><p>\u201CNot just mine, but yours as well\u2014no, the same goes for all Heroic Spirits!\u201D</p><p>Assassin of Red smiled faintly at those words.</p><p>\u201CI am different. I\u2019ll still have a proper role. If not, even I wouldn\u2019t follow Shirou\u2019s plan.\u201D</p><p>\u201CAh, I see. So that\u2019s what you mean! Hmm, it\u2019s true that, if Shirou\u2019s dream is realized, even the need to spin tales will disappear from this world. But\u2014the story to reach it will be a masterpiece. An unprecedented, first and last masterpiece that would be unreachable even if you gave an infinite number of typewriters to an infinite number of monkeys! If I can write it down, well, I won\u2019t have any regrets left.\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2026You make some sense.\u201D</p><p>Still, Assassin of Red didn\u2019t lose her suspicious expression. Honestly speaking, her doubts about Caster had started when he had released Berserker of Red.</p><p>If Shirou\u2019s plan advanced well, this man may carelessly produce hardships himself.</p><p>\u201CAh, that. In that case, have no worries!\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2026What should I have no worries about?\u201D</p><p>Spreading both his arms in an exaggerated manner, Caster of Red spoke as if singing.</p><p>\u201COur Master is already [Against death and all oblivious enmity], and is trying to win against them! There\u2019s no way that no one will interfere with such an extraordinary plan! Even without me planning any underhanded tricks, every single person will come to obstruct him! However! However, I have faith that our Master will surely overcome even them!\u201D</p><p>Watching Caster of Red excitedly talk on and on, Assassin of Red finally let go of her vigilance towards him.</p><p>\u201C\u2014I see. If you put it like that, I can understand your attitude. Caster, you think obstacles will appear? What kind of obstacle specifically?\u201D</p><p>\u201CYou already know what. Right now, it\u2019s that girl who\u2019s bewildered due to ignorance.\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2026Ruler, huh? Certainly, her privilege is astounding. But we\u2019re conducting a counter-measure against that right now, aren\u2019t we?\u201D</p><p>\u201CNo, no. Her privilege is also marvelous, but what should be truly feared is the girl herself.\u201D</p><p>\u201CWhat, do you know who she is?\u201D</p><p>\u201CThere aren\u2019t many Heroic Spirits who are female saints hoisting a flag\u2026 She is my motherland\u2019s beloved enemy. The country girl who was destroyed due to obeying the voice of god and went mad with grief\u2014Jeanne d\u2019Arc.\u201D</p><p>\u201CHoh. So she\u2019s the bitter enemy of your country.\u201D</p><p>Assassin of Red said that with a smile. Just as she said, Jeanne d\u2019Arc had risen up as the savior of France and completely defeated the English army. Though she was arrested in the end due to treachery, their hatred towards her was probably very deep. Many works written in England at that time depicted her as an enemy and denounced her.</p><p>\u201CNo, no, I no longer harbor any such ill feelings. Actually, isn\u2019t our own Master a saint from the Far East? Things like England and France no longer matter. However\u2014if she\u2019s going to obstruct us, we\u2019ll have to crush her without any mercy.\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2026By your hands?\u201D</p><p>\u201CMe? Perish the thought. I\u2019ll leave that to you, revered empress.\u201D</p><p>Caster of Red laughed loudly, and Assassin of Red, though she\u2019d already known it would be that way, sighed.</p><p>\u201C\u2026So? What was it that you wanted to ask?\u201D</p><p>\u201CIt\u2019s about none other than our Master. I naturally know that \u2018Shirou\u2019 is his real name. But where did the name \u2018Kotomine\u2019 come from? There\u2019s no way he simply adopted it because it was suitable.\u201D</p><p>\u201CAh, that. Kotomine is apparently the name of his adoptive father. Needless to say, that man is without a single relative in this world. So apparently he relied on the supervisor who had survived along with him, a priest named Kotomine, and received a certain social status from him.\u201D</p><p>\u201CHaha, I see. So the reason he became the supervisor of the Great Holy Grail War was also thanks to those connections.\u201D</p><p>\u201CSo it seems. Though, that priest has already been dead a long time now, and Shirou apparently doesn\u2019t interact much with the man whom he\u2019s step-brothers with\u2026 What\u2019s with those eyes and that smile you\u2019re making?\u201D</p><p>\u201CNo, no, I just thought that our Master trusts you a lot. When I asked him about it, he just vaguely dodged the question.\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2026Isn\u2019t it probably because you haven\u2019t made yourself trustworthy?\u201D</p><p>When Shirou had carelessly talked to Caster of Red about his origins, Caster couldn\u2019t help seeming as if he were about to spill over and fall from the gossip. Moreover, it was quite possible that he\u2019d publish it as biography.</p><p>\u201CHmph. I am not so much of a fiend that I\u2019d expose people\u2019s privacy, but\u2014whoa there.\u201D</p><p>An impact ran through the ground beneath them from the bottom of the gardens. The whole gardens trembled violently as if affected by an earthquake.</p><p>\u201C\u2026That was?\u201D</p><p>\u201CThe aftershock of Berserker\u2019s attack, probably. It seems he\u2019s about to reach his critical point.\u201D</p><p>Assassin of Red ordered the Hanging Gardens to ascend higher in the air. It would be troubling if these gardens were targeted by that [weapon]. He should be targeting not these gardens, but the Fortress of Millennia.</p><p>\u201CHowever\u2014won\u2019t the Holy Grail break as a result?\u201D</p><p>\u201CHave no fear. The Greater Grail is underground beneath the fortress, and it\u2019s not something that can be turned into rubble anyway. Even if Berserker goes to attack it directly, there\u2019s no problem. And in any case he no longer has such intelligence left in him.\u201D</p><p>Using remote-viewing thaumaturgy, Assassin of Red confirmed that Ruler was fighting Berserker of Red.</p><p>\u201CNow then\u2026 How does Ruler intend to face Berserker? If she gets hit by his final attack, even she won\u2019t be able to walk away unscathed.\u201D</p><p>Just as Assassin of Red said, the champion of rebellion, Spartacus, was about to swing his final blow. He was targeting the Fortress of Millennia where the oppressors were gathered. The mad warrior didn\u2019t even consider that his own Master was there.</p><p>When his body started to collapse due to its own weight as it swelled up with prana, Berserker at last reached enough power for that final and most powerful attack. It was the attack of the end and demise on this battlefield.</p><p>\u2014Here it comes.</p><p>Ruler was certain of it. The next attack would be the most powerful attack that Berserker of Red could unleash. At the same time, it would be his final attack. He was going to use up even the prana needed to tie himself to the present age and disappear as a result.</p><p>If that was the path that the Heroic Spirit Spartacus chose, then she wouldn\u2019t stop him.</p><p>But, as expected, she had to avoid getting swallowed up in it herself.</p><p>She glanced at the Hanging Garden, which existed as if to sneer at her. Next, her gaze turned to where the Sabers of Black and Red were fiercely battling each other.</p><p>She decided. She made a decision not according to a revelation from God, but according to her own will.</p><p>While holding her flag in one hand, she took a huge jump backwards\u2014and once having confirmed that Berserker\u2019s gaze had turned to look at the fortress, she headed towards the two Sabers.</p><p>For the time being, she intended to get their attention and convince them to withdraw. The other Servants had already noticed Berserker of Red\u2019s abnormal state and had retreated somewhere safe.</p><p>Only Sieg, who had transformed into Saber of Black, Rider of Black and Saber of Red were still within range of Berserker\u2019s attack.</p><p>\u2014Not good!</p><p>Saber of Red and Saber of Black had, of all things, unleashed their respective Noble Phantasms against each other. The aftershocks of that tremendous energy naturally reached Ruler, but also Berserker of Red further away.</p><p>Having broken through his critical point, Berserker of Red howled. The countdown reached zero, and the ground shook.</p><p>Ruler shouted.</p><p>\u201CRun away!\u201D</p><p>Just as she was about to deal the finishing blow to Sieg, Saber of Red turned around in shock and caught sight of Berserker right as he was on the verge of exploding. Though she hesitated slightly, she seemed to receive an order from her Master and clicked her tongue, immediately turning into spiritual form.</p><p>It went without saying for Ruler, who was in fact possessing the human Laeticia, but Sieg couldn\u2019t turn into spiritual form and run away either.</p><p>\u201CSieg-kun!\u201D</p><p>Hearing Ruler\u2019s desperate call, the now-empty Sieg silently shook his head. It appeared he couldn\u2019t move due to the pain and damage from being hit by Saber of Red\u2019s Noble Phantasm attack earlier as well as the backlash from his transformation.</p><p>\u201C\u2026Go. You aren\u2019t a Servant who should perish here.\u201D</p><p>And yet, he unhesitatingly told Ruler to run away alone. Ruler sighed in exasperation.</p><p>\u201CDon\u2019t say stupid things\u2026 The one who brought you here was me.\u201D</p><p>\u201CI chose to fight by my own will.\u201D</p><p>\u201CGuh. There\u2019s a limit even to being stubborn!\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2026Isn\u2019t that basically the pot calling the kettle black?\u201D</p><p>Despite being in this kind of situation, Sieg spoke to Ruler with cool eyes.</p><p>\u201C\u2014Do not worry. I don\u2019t intend to let you die. And I\u2019m not going to perish here either.\u201D</p><p>She planted the flag in her right hand into the ground. Peeking at the state of affairs behind her back, she saw Rider of Black, who looked totally exhausted, tightly hugging Sieg as if to protect him.</p><p>She didn\u2019t think his Master would refuse to let him turn into spiritual form and run away. Most likely, Rider himself had refused to do so. Since he possessed the [Independent Action] skill, Rider could continue to survive for a short time even if his prana supply was cut off.</p><p>\u2026However, not running away in this situation was just reckless.</p><p>\u201CAre you not going to escape, Rider of Black?\u201D</p><p>\u201CI don\u2019t want to.\u201D</p><p>\u201CBut\u2014\u201D</p><p>Rider shook his head fervently while hugging Sieg.</p><p>\u201CI said I don\u2019t want to! I don\u2019t want to see him get wounded any further! I absolutely won\u2019t move away from here!\u201D</p><p>Despite his own substantial wounds, Rider didn\u2019t even consider running away. It wasn\u2019t that there was something he could do; he was just going to perish with the two of them because he was trying to protect Sieg.</p><p>It was meaningless. A completely meaningless act.</p><p>If his Noble Phantasms weren\u2019t taken into account, Rider of Black, Astolfo, was a Heroic Spirit that was only somewhere between second and third rate in terms of strength and skill. Astolfo was the only one among Charlemagne\u2019s Twelve Paladins who was famed to be [weak] according to legend.</p><p>But even so, Astolfo was a hero.</p><p>\u201CI don\u2019t want to\u2026\u201D</p><p>Even though he trembled, Rider didn\u2019t stop protecting Sieg. He didn\u2019t falter either. It was only natural for those who were born strong to display courage. Because they were strong. They had pride in their strength, and they had a will that wouldn\u2019t yield to any enemy.</p><p>Astolfo was different. This Servant was weak and could never defeat the enemy known as fate. His strength could neither move mountains nor pierce the heavens. And yet, Astolfo was a brave hero acknowledged by everyone during his lifetime. Even if he was weak, even if his power was insufficient, even if he was defeated. Astolfo was a brave person and had the qualifications to be a hero.</p><p>\u201C\u2014I understand. Then please stay still there. It will be dangerous if you move.\u201D</p><p>If that was this Servant\u2019s will, Ruler had no right to stop him.</p><p>That\u2019s why this was to protect Sieg. She might be slightly deviating from her role as a mediator. But she had been given the discretion to act according to her judgement on the battlefield.</p><p>The Servant who was like neither a beast, human, monster or even a Heroic Spirit, but rather a giant \u2018wrathful god\u2019, at last struck the ground with his final attack.</p><p>Berserker of Red was filled with euphoria that numbed his brain. His final attack would destroy all tyranny and smash all authority.</p><p>Of course, he was mad\u2026 and even he understood that he was mad. But he wouldn\u2019t stop. He was born with this personality that couldn\u2019t endure obeying anyone.</p><p>No, that wasn\u2019t it. Being scorned and wounded felt good to him. Making the stagnating things inside him settle like sediments was an irresistible joy to him.</p><p>So he continued smiling. And when it reached its critical point, Spartacus rebelled. As long as there were oppressors in the world, neither his joy nor his anger could be stopped.</p><p>And now, after having been given a second life, he was trying to throw the most powerful blow of his life. His vision distorted and the pain of having his entire body rearranged by something tortured his mind. But that was also at an end. This wasn\u2019t simply an attack loaded with all his power. It was what could appropriately be called the ultimate destruction that he couldn\u2019t achieve unless he sacrificed all of himself.</p><p>\u201C\u2014Ah.\u201D</p><p>He even let out a sigh of wonder. He didn\u2019t even reflect on how much his flesh had been hideously transformed. The gladiator of suffering who had devoted his entire lifetime to rebellion finally swung that final blow.</p><p>His target was the oppressor with the greatest authority in the Great Holy Grail War: Ruler. And also those in the Fortress of Millennia behind her. An attack that seemed to reach the moon and make the stars fall. The greatest counter punch he had ever made in his lifetime including both before and after his death. Would his fist, his sword really reach those oppressors?</p><p>He neither knew nor cared to find out. The austere gladiator, who had only devoted his life to rebellion, breathed his last breath while smiling.</p><p>Ruler, Rider of Black and Sieg were in the direct path of that attack. Avoiding it was impossible, and no matter how tough a shield one possessed, it couldn\u2019t protect against that attack that Berserker had wagered his life upon.</p><p>But\u2014the one receiving that attack was the absolute mediator of the Holy Grail War, Ruler.</p><p>\u201CLuminosit\xE9\u2014\u201D</p><p>She tightly grasped her flag with both hands and activated its true name.</p><p>The flag that the saint Jeanne d\u2019Arc had kept in place of a sword. That flag, which inspired and uplifted the soldiers who followed her believing that a saint walked amongst them, was said to have continued to protect this female saint who always ran ahead as the vanguard.</p><p>\u201C\u2014Eternelle: God is Here With Me!\u201D</p><p>And when this holy flag was activated as a Noble Phantasm, it converted Jeanne\u2019s EX rank Magic Resistance into a protection against all physical and spiritual harm.</p><p>Berserker of Red\u2019s attack had been unleashed with all his hate and joy. But the flag completely cut off not only Jeanne, but also Rider of Black and Sieg behind her from it.</p><p>She put strength into both her hands. Right now, Ruler\u2019s flag was their only lifeline. Stifling her anguish and simply looking forward\u2014Ruler simply endured the explosive maelstrom of light.</p><p>It was like someone who opposed all the evil in the world.</p><p>It was like someone who opposed a fallen star.</p><p>It was like all humans who, despite being so small, opposed the thing before their eyes that they didn\u2019t consider right.</p><p>Filled with pride, willpower, anger or perhaps something else entirely, humans possessed hearts that could rise up with courage that surpassed their fear even in the face of overwhelming violence that slaughtered thousands of people.</p><p>Watching her small back, Sieg was gripped by a heartbreakingly sad feeling for some reason. He was fully aware that it was arrogant of him, but when he thought of the tragic tale of her life, he couldn\u2019t discard those feelings.</p><p>She had everything taken from her due to betrayal. Receiving the worst treatment conceivably possible for a human, and yet never cursing anything\u2026 the personification of a saint who never despaired.</p><p>It would be fine if she cursed those who betrayed. He could understand if she hated them. But she had felt no hatred, resentment, or even regrets. For some strange reason, Sieg couldn\u2019t stand that.</p><p>\u2026Rider of Black suddenly recalled the myth of an old man who managed to cut the sea in half. The light that completely isolated and cut them off from their surroundings was like that divided water. Just as life had an end, this attack that Berserker had wagered his life on also came to an end. Berserker of Red\u2019s fully-powered attack had half-destroyed the Fortress of Millennia, and killed the many golems, homunculi and Dragon Tooth Warriors that remained on the battlefield.</p><p>But even with that stupendous destructive power, the three of them didn\u2019t receive a single injury. When the light settled down, Ruler sighed with relief and turned around. With a brilliant and shining smile, she let out another sigh of relief and\u2014</p><p>\u201C\u2026Thank goodness you\u2019re unhurt.\u201D</p><p>She murmured that.</p><p>It was closer to a calamity than a sword slash. It was also like an earthquake and tsunami filled with malice. Having converted Berserker\u2019s entire enormous store of prana into pure destruction, it shook the earth and mowed down the Fortress of Millennia.</p><p>Shrieks rose up around the magi. Fortunately, the location where they were watching the battle situation from was not directly exposed to the roaring flames. But everything just a few meters ahead of them was in a miserable state.</p><p>\u201CW-What\u2026 what happened just now\u2026?\u201D</p><p>Gordes\u2019 mutter as if he were seeing a nightmare was only natural. If they had been directly hit by the attack, it would be understandable. But they had only been hit by the aftershocks.</p><p>\u201C\u2026What\u2019s the condition of Berserker of Red?\u201D</p><p>In response to Fiore\u2019s question, Caules sighed and spoke up</p><p>\u201CHe\u2019s vanished\u2026 What about the other Servants?\u201D</p><p>\u201CArcher is still alive. How about Rider?\u201D</p><p>Celenike nodded in an annoyed manner. Despite how much she had told him to turn into spiritual form and come back here, he had, let alone come back, tried to protect that homunculus. Considering the situation, it might be time to finally settle things decisively with him.</p><p>\u201CRider is also alive. Caster?\u201D</p><p>Roche had received a terrible shock over how the golems he and Caster had worked hard to make had been scattered into pieces like wood chips. But he confirmed that the one he was concerned about the most, Caster, was still alive.</p><p>\u201CSensei is safe and sound\u2026 80% of the golems were blown away, and the ones that were kept on standby at the fortress are barely able to operate.\u201D</p><p>\u201CI see. All that\u2019s left is Lancer. It seems grandfather is also alive, but\u2026\u201D</p><p>\u201CMy lord is also fine. His battle with Lancer of Red ended while unsettled. He\u2019s terribly angry. More importantly, there is an emergency.\u201D</p><p>Standing on the broken window frame, Darnic said that with a somehow hoarse voice.</p><p>\u201C\u2026Emergency?\u201D</p><p>Fiore thought that there couldn\u2019t be any situation worse than what they went through just now, but Darnic\u2019s voice was more serious than she expected.</p><p>\u201C\u2014The Hanging Gardens have started to approach the fortress.\u201D</p><p>Saber of Red canceled her spiritual form and examined the state of her surroundings.</p><p>\u2014In the forest that spread out on either side of the grassland plains, many trees had fallen. They were in a wretched state that made it looked as if they had been trampled by a giant.</p><p>\u2014Nearly all the golems, homunculi and Dragon Tooth Warriors had died. That was only natural. That much prana had been concentrated and released all at once. The only ones still alive were those homunculi who had been on standby back in the rear lines or who had sensed the situation and run away.</p><p>\u2014The Servants had all escaped from the battlefield at high speed. At the very least, anyone who was thick-headed enough to get swallowed up by this attack was worse than third-rate.</p><p>In other words, the land was completely empty. That strange monstrous Servant had annihilated this battlefield. Whether she was angry, amazed or sneering\u2026 not knowing what her currently feelings should be described as, Saber simply stood there in a dumfounded daze for a little while.</p><p>\u201CHey, Saber.\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2026Ah, Master. The situation is just as you can see.\u201D</p><p>Turning around at the voice that called out to her from behind her back, she shrugged her shoulders. Her Master Shishigou also let out a sigh of amazement as he looked at the battlefield.</p><p>\u201CSo, what should we do now, Master? Please give me orders.\u201D</p><p>\u201CEven if you say that\u2026 a battle with enemies and allies jumbled together on completely empty land like this will definitely turn out awful.\u201D</p><p>\u201CSo shall we withdraw?\u201D</p><p>Shishigou was about to agree with those words, but he suddenly looked up to the sky and decided to reject that proposal.</p><p>\u201C\u2014No, we won\u2019t be withdrawing. Look, Saber.\u201D</p><p>Shishigou pointed at the Hanging Gardens, a product of the Age of Gods. Shishigou, having carefully investigated information about Semiramis, could tell that it was Assassin of Red\u2019s Noble Phantasm.</p><p>The problem was that the Hanging Gardens were approaching the crumbled Fortress of Millennia.</p><p>\u201C\u2026Hmph. Certainly, if we withdraw now, we\u2019ll be treated as outsiders.\u201D</p><p>\u201CRight? Let\u2019s go, Saber.\u201D</p><p>\u201CUnderstood, Master. So, is flying your speciality?\u201D</p><p>\u201CI\u2019m terrible at it. I don\u2019t want to think about it that much, but it seems I\u2019ll have to rely on you.\u201D</p><p>In response to Shishigou\u2019s grumbles, Saber of Red chuckled. Yes, in other words, it was time for her to use her personal skill, [Prana Burst].</p><hr><p>\u201C\u2026Hmm. I thought that destroying that fortress would be slightly difficult, but we were saved the trouble. I thought we would have to use Lancer\u2019s Noble Phantasm as well, but\u2026\u201D</p><p>Assassin of Red said that and gazed at her fellow Red Servants who had retreated from the battlefield to the Hanging Gardens.</p><p>\u201CThank you very much for all your efforts, everyone. I can see that your boiling blood is still unsatisfied\u2014but just endure it for a little while longer. The battle will resume very soon.\u201D</p><p>Archer of Red shook her head at Assassin\u2019s words.</p><p>\u201CI don\u2019t mind\u2014but what do you intend to do by having us approach the fortress like this? Do you want to go kill the Masters directly?\u201D</p><p>\u201CIt goes without saying. \u2014We\u2019re going to take back the Greater Grail.\u201D</p><p>Instantly, all the other Servants there fell silent. Rider and Archer exchanged glances and even Lancer looked at Assassin with a doubtful expression.</p><p>\u201C\u2018Take it back\u2019? No, in the first place\u2026 how are we going to do such a thing?\u2019</p><p>Assassin of Red pointed at the floor beneath them with a smile.</p><p>\u201C\u2014What allows these Hanging Gardens to float is the concept of [inversion]. Plants grow downward and water flows from downstream to upstream here.\u201D</p><p>The gardens came to a halt in the skies above the Fortress of Millennia. If any citizens in Trifas were to look up at the night sky, what would they think of these giant gardens that hid even the moon from sight? At the very least, they wouldn\u2019t believe their eyes if they were sober.</p><p>\u201CGaze well upon it, you tiny magi. This is the true territory of a magus.\u201D</p><p>Assassin of Red laughed loudly and spread her arms wide as she released a certain spell.</p><p>Roaring wind blew out from the bottom of the gardens. Similar to a tornado, it connected to the fortress below like some kind of pipe.</p><p>\u201CHey, hey\u2026 You mean you really intend to steal it!?\u201D</p><p>At Rider of Red\u2019s words, Assassin of Red nodded and shouted.</p><p>\u201COf course! Because these gardens were designed for the sake of that! Now, come out, Greater Grail! Show us your terrible and beautiful figure that was constructed with god-like magecraft!\u201D</p><p>The ground crumbled and flew upwards as it was sucked towards the Hanging Gardens. More than two thirds of the fortress had already been destroyed. The naked bedrock was smashed up and then, at last, the Greater Grail was exposed to the surface\u2019s air.</p><p>\u201CThat\u2014is the Holy Grail?\u201D</p><p>Archer of Red muttered with a dumbfounded expression. With her eyesight that was as good as the eyes of a falcon, she was certainly able to see the Greater Grail below. But that wasn\u2019t what had truly shocked her.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t just Archer; Lancer, Rider and even Caster could only stand there dumbfounded. The absolute, eternal and colorless abundant prana that had accumulated continuously for more than six decades swirled around in a vortex.</p><p>\u201CThat is the Holy Grail\u2026! Excellent! That is far too excellent! Magnificent! Magnificent, magnificent!! Even I can sense that overwhelming prana from here! I even want to jump in and drown within it, become one with it! And yet, it is hideous like a naked human body! Truly [Fair is foul and foul is fair]!\u201D</p><p>Caster raised cries of joy.</p><p>It was obvious that it was worthy to be called an [almighty wish-granting device], as long as the wish asked of it wasn\u2019t too great. It was only natural that even Servants like them would become excited.</p><p>\u201C\u2026Tch, it\u2019s completely bonded to the ley lines. It seems it will take time to tear it out. However, we don\u2019t have the leisure to remain at ease. They\u2019re coming, everyone.\u201D</p><p>Even without Assassin of Red saying it, all the Servants there sensed it. In order to prevent the plundering of the Greater Grail, the Black Servants were heading there one by one.</p><p>\u201CI have to focus on the Greater Grail for a while. I\u2019ll leave the enemies to you all. If you don\u2019t hold them back here, your wishes will vanish like dew in the morning. Deal with them carefully, understood?\u201D</p><p>In response to those words accompanied by a jeering smile, Rider and Archer of Red retorted without hiding their hostility.</p><p>\u201C\u2014That goes without saying. I should be saying that to you instead. Make sure not to fail.\u201D</p><p>\u201CI\u2019ll do what we have to do. Don\u2019t bother with meticulous instructions like that. You don\u2019t need to tell us.\u201D</p><p>But even in the face of that unabashed hostility, Assassin of Red\u2019s composure didn\u2019t collapse.</p><p>\u201CWell then, as for me, I\u2019m gushing with inspiration thanks to the Greater Grail, so I\u2019ll take my leave here!\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2026You should help at least a little.\u201D</p><p>Ignoring everyone else\u2019s amazed and disgusted expressions, Caster hastily headed towards the workshop made for his personal use\u2014in other worse, his \u2018study\u2019.</p><p>\u201CAh, that reminds. There\u2019s one thing I forgot to say. These gardens aren\u2019t within Romania. You should fight while bearing that in mind.\u201D</p><p>Assassin of Red left those final words and disappeared. The Greater Grail was moving at a constant dull speed, but it was definitely being torn out from Trifas.</p><p>Since the Gardens had approached right beside the fortress, the Black Servants were able to reach this place with a single leap.</p><p>\u201C\u2014I\u2019ll take Lancer of Black.\u201D</p><p>The Red spearman murmured that and readied his divine spear. Rider of Red naturally chose his teacher, Archer of Black, and Archer of Red decided to aim for Caster, whom she was meeting for the first time.</p><p>The offensive and defensive sides had switched. The Black Servants had to take back the Greater Grail before it was stolen. The Red Servants had to protect the Greater Grail until it was completely taken away.</p><p>The situation had also reversed along with the offence and defence. The Fortress of Millennia, which should have been an impenetrable stronghold, was now useless rubbish, and the Red camp were the ones with the overwhelming advantage.</p><p>But there was one thing that would become problem in this current situation. That was the existence of Ruler, who already was in the midst of heading here. But the only ones who knew that were Assassin and Caster of Red along with their Master Shirou.</p><p>The Black camp, Red camp and Ruler all understood that this was a battle against time. In the several minutes it would take for the Greater Grail to be torn out from the ley lines and completely installed inside the Hanging Gardens, they had to fight a desperate battle to the death.</p><hr><p>Ruler had left behind Rider of Black and Sieg and was now running towards the Hanging Gardens by herself at full speed. The closer she got, the more shocked she was by that floating Noble Phantasm. Anti-Fortress Noble Phantasms, which possessed the pure power to destroy fortresses and castles, were rare, but that didn\u2019t mean that there weren\u2019t Heroic Spirit who owned them. However, Noble Phantasms that were fortresses in and of themselves were most likely even scarcer.</p><p>Fortresses that existed as Noble Phantasms, according to the knowledge that Ruler immediately dragged out, were limited to those like the one possessed by Ireland\u2019s Child of Light. And even that was restricted to the borders of his homeland.</p><p>Furthermore, the number of Noble Phantasms that were floating strongholds was nearly zero. And to make things more troublesome, it appeared that the owner of that floating fortress held ill will towards her. She had gone through considerable detours, but in any case, there were many things she needed to verify with the Red camp.</p><p>\u2014However.</p><p>Something, something fatal was starting and about to end. She kept having that premonition. Somehow managing to shake off the chill that took hold of her, she jumped onto the walls of the Fortress of Millennia and ran upwards at full speed.</p><p>From the huge hole that had been bored into the Fortress of Millennia, the Greater Grail was slowly coming into view.</p><p>\u201C\u2026I can\u2019t believe it.\u201D</p><p>Ruler\u2019s murmur was only natural. The oppressive sensation clamping down on her entire body told her that it was without a doubt the real Greater Grail. What she couldn\u2019t believe was that the Red camp was trying to drag it out.</p><p>It was true that this was a war that revolved around the Greater Grail. She also predicted that the Red Camp would end up doing this if they won. But that would normally only happen after the war was over. Why were they hurriedly trying to recover the Greater Grail when the scales of battle were still swaying?</p><p>Most likely, the one causing problems right now was not any of the Red Servants, but a Master. Someone who, at the very least, wasn\u2019t following the will of the Association of Magi\u2026</p><p>After having conjectured that far, she finally managed to arrive atop the floating fortress. Water ran upstream and plants clearly grew not upwards but downwards instead.</p><p>\u201CA reversed flow\u2026 the Hanging Gardens\u2026!\u201D</p><p>\u201CThat\u2019s right, Ruler.\u201D</p><p>Hearing that jeering voice, Ruler turned around\u2014she knew of only two Heroic Spirits who possessed the Hanging Gardens as a Noble Phantasm. The first was Nebuchadnezzar II, and the second was\u2014the legendary empress who, due to oral transmission of ancient folklore getting mixed up, was lavished with the falsehood of having \u2018made the Hanging Gardens\u2019.</p><p>The world\u2019s oldest poisoner\u2014Semiramis.</p><p>\u201CAssassin of Red\u2026 so that\u2019s who you are.\u201D</p><p>\u201CIndeed. Now then, Ruler. Do you have some business in my gardens? I don\u2019t believe I have violated any particular rules, though.\u201D</p><p>Perhaps due to the dimness of the nearby torches, her black and glamorous dress was halfway merged with the darkness of the night. Ruler felt it was terribly\u2014eerie.</p><p>\u201CNo, you have.\u201D</p><p>\u201CHoh,\u201D said Assassin of Red, displaying interest.</p><p>\u201C\u2014Then tell me. What rule have I violated?\u201D</p><p>\u201CIf you have not a single smidgeon of guilt on your conscience and you are obeying the rules of the Holy Grail War as you say\u2014then please let me meet your Master.\u201D</p><p>Instantly, the look in Assassin of Red\u2019s eyes switched from sneering to cautious. Ruler knew from those eyes that the path she had followed here wasn\u2019t mistaken.</p><p>\u201C\u2026Unfortunately, my Master is occupied right now. Furthermore, while he isn\u2019t a coward at all, I won\u2019t let him meet with other Servants.\u201D</p><p>\u201CI see. He\u2019s hiding somewhere within these gardens, isn\u2019t he?\u2019</p><p>Ruler easily pointed that out. Assassin of Red was already preparing to fight. As if to stop her from doing so, Ruler stuck forward her flag and spoke.</p><p>\u201CYou should understand that fighting me is useless, Assassin of Red. The pillars of light shot from the Hanging Gardens were the work of your spells, correct? In that case\u2014\u201D</p><p>\u201CHmph. It\u2019s true that my magecraft can\u2019t pierce through your Magic Resistance. Is that one of your privileges as Ruler, I wonder?\u201D</p><p>\u201CI have still more privileges\u2026 Assassin of Red. Please don\u2019t make me use this.\u201D</p><p>Ruler\u2019s entire body shined slightly with pale light, and even Assassin of Red couldn\u2019t stop herself from grimacing in response.</p><p>\u201C\u2026The greatest privilege of the Ruler class; Command Spells that can be used on all Servants, huh?\u201D</p><p>This was the greatest reason that Ruler could act as a mediator. Ruler possessed two Command Spells for every Servant. In this case, that added up to a total of twenty-eight Command Spells. It was only natural that the Black camp had tried to get her as an ally.</p><p>In extreme cases, she could end the majority of Servants by ordering them to kill themselves. Of course, a Command Spell could be counteracted by another Command Spell. If she ordered Servants to kill themselves, their Masters could simply use a Command Spell of their own to stop them from killing themselves.</p><p>But that meant that two Command Spells were uselessly expended. If they kept one Command Spell in reserve to take into account the betrayal of their Servants, it actually become impossible for them to use any Command Spells afterwards.</p><p>Additionally, the camp that Ruler sided with would be able to use a sum total of four Command Spells for each Servant with Ruler\u2019s Command Spells also included. Ruler, who could overturn the superiority or inferiority of any side, was naturally a capable person whom everyone wanted. Though Heroic Spirits who would fall for such temptation shouldn\u2019t be fit for the Ruler class in the first place.</p><p>\u201CBut don\u2019t bother. Even if we have to exhaust all our Command Spells, I won\u2019t betray my Master. If you order me with a Command Spell, my Master will stop it.\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2026Your Master isn\u2019t your puppet, is he?\u201D</p><p>\u201COf course not. No matter what my first life was like, I am now a Servant and I will selflessly support my Master.\u201D</p><p>Ruler took a step forward and spoke.</p><p>\u201CIn that case, right now you are my enemy.\u201D</p><p>Having reached here, she at last clearly confirmed that Assassin of Red and her Master were her enemies. Even Assassin of Red couldn\u2019t help turning nervous at that step.</p><p>From the beginning, the specs of Assassin and Ruler weren\u2019t even comparable. Additionally, magi had fatally bad compatibility with Ruler. Even without using a Command Spell, she could immediately defeat Assassin.</p><p>\u2014In the first place, Assassin of Red and her Master didn\u2019t wish to fight Ruler.</p><p>What was more important was that Lancer of Red and Lancer of Black would soon come into contact to resume their battle, and that Lancer of Black\u2019s Master would become aware of the situation. She just needed to buy a few minutes of time by talking with Ruler until then.</p><p>Shirou, knowing quite well the cruelty and inhumanity of Lancer of Black\u2019s Master Darnic Prestone Yggdmillennia, was certain that he would definitely activate the Noble Phantasm that reproduced that legend if the situation became disadvantageous for Lancer of Black.</p><p>\u201CHoh, I see. So I am your enemy, am I? But it\u2019s unfortunate. Starting from this very moment, we must share the same interest.\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2014!?\u201D</p><p>Ruler turned around. There was no sound or disturbance of prana. But in just a few seconds, the worst possible situation would occur\u2014she received such a revelation.</p><p>\u201CThere, you should get going now. What, I\u2019ll also help. We must oppose that together\u2014because that\u2019s how extremely troublesome it is.\u201D</p><p>Ruler gritted her teeth slightly. But Assassin\u2019s words were correct.</p><p>Something had already been \u2018born\u2019 along with an enormous outpouring of prana. Something that didn\u2019t belong in the Holy Grail War and could be considered fatal.</p><p>Ruler turned her back to Assassin and began running with all her might.</p><hr><p>\u2014It was overwhelming.</p><p>\u201C\u2026As I thought.\u201D</p><p>\u201CKuh\u2026!\u201D</p><p>Speaking with a dispassionate voice, Lancer of Red was cornering Lancer of Black. His precision, which didn\u2019t show the slightest bit of mercy, was truly cold-hearted, suitable for a great hero.</p><p>However, the hero Vlad III, who had equally fought against him just a little bit earlier, was greatly inferior to him.</p><p>Lancer of Black himself could also sense that abnormality. He had become weaker. If his earlier self was rated 10, his current self was at best a 6.</p><p>Stakes were being created from Lancer of Black\u2019s own body. But their force and sharpness were not as great as before. Even without covering himself in flames, Lancer of Red was able to repel all of them with just his spear and armor.</p><p>\u201CThese Hanging Gardens are the domain ruled by our camp\u2019s Assassin. It\u2019s not your territory. In other words\u2014as long as you are within these gardens, you aren\u2019t the great patriotic hero who saved his country.\u201D</p><p>Assassin of Red\u2019s Noble Phantasm, Hanging Gardens of Babylon, was a fortress Noble Phantasm that ruled a defined domain. To put it another way, that place wasn\u2019t Romania where Vlad III was revered as a hero. Accordingly, the level of his fame became equal to zero.</p><p>Naturally, Lancer of Red, Karna, also had close to zero fame here. But there was a difference in basic power between Karna and Vlad III.</p><p>Even if his fame was equal to zero, as long as his legend existed somewhere in the world, Karna was unmistakably a great hero. On the other hand, outside of Romania, Vlad III was only known as a blood-sucking vampire.</p><p>Having been summoned with the characteristics of a hero, Lancer of Black\u2019s fame didn\u2019t give him any power. Rather, it inhibited his ability to display his original specs.</p><p>As he faced against Lancer of Red who wielded a spear, Lancer of Black had lost the refinement, splendor and even sternness that he had always maintained. Only the fact that he had pride and dignity as a hero supported him.</p><p>That alone gave him the power to fight.</p><p>But it was far from enough to cut off the head of Lancer of Red.</p><p>If the fighting spirit that Lancer of Black had due to his pride as a hero weakened even slightly, the battle would end with the force and speed of an avalanche.</p><p>The two Lancers understood that very well. In that case, Lancer of Black should just retreat, turn back and run away. Though, if he could do that, he wouldn\u2019t have become a Heroic Spirit in the first place.</p><p>\u2014I\u2019m going to die.</p><p>That thought, dyed with certainty, suddenly welled up inside Lancer of Black. His defeat would naturally mean the defeat of the entire Black camp. But it couldn\u2019t be helped. He had been unable to win and had chased the enemy too far. Most of all, he had never imagined that the Greater Grail would be stolen.</p><p>If only Saber of Black was alive. He had such thoughts as well. Shame, despair and regret threw his heart out of order like an overflowing river.</p><p>But\u2014</p><p>It really couldn\u2019t be helped.</p><p>The moment he thought that, was certain of it, and resolved himself to it, the Master who had contracted with him appeared there as if through magic and whispered to him like a devil.</p><p>\u201CNo, we can still win. \u2014If you release that Noble Phantasm, that is.\u201D</p><p>All the Servants present there stopped moving. The one standing there was a single Master, the head of Yggdmillennia, Darnic.</p><p>Lording over the Servants from atop a temple-like pillar some distance away from the open space where the Servants were in the midst of fighting, Darnic was strangely irritated by Lancer of Black.</p><p>But what he had said just now was a far greater problem. With a strong blow, Lancer of Black took distance from Lancer of Red and glared at his Master.</p><p>\u201C\u2026Darnic. What did you say to me just now?\u201D</p><p>He wasn\u2019t playing around this time; he was radiating genuine killing intent. Receiving it coolly, the magus continued speaking even more disrespectful words.</p><p>\u201CMy lord, I said to release that Noble Phantasm. We have no chance of winning besides that.\u201D</p><p>\u201CWhat are you saying!? I told you I wouldn\u2019t use that Noble Phantasm, have you forgotten!? I will die here! I will crumble away in death with regret! But that is the fate of the defeated! Darnic! I will never even consider using that and turning into an unsightly existence! Never, never!\u201D</p><p>\u201CYou\u2019re the one who has forgotten. We must obtain the Greater Grail by any means possible! In order to turn it into a symbol and retaliate against the Association of Magi. Or to reach the Root. As a king, your wish should be fervent as well. In that case\u2014there\u2019s no other way but to use that Noble Phantasm.\u201D</p><p>Saying that, Darnic held out one hand. On top of it were three red and shining Command Spells.</p><p>\u201CYou\u2026!?\u201D</p><p>As Lancer of Black widened his eyes, Darnic laughed at him and spoke in a penetratingly cold voice.</p><p>\u201CI order you with a Command Spell. Heroic Spirit Vlad III. Activate\u2014your Noble Phantasm, Legend of Dracula.\u201D</p><p>\u201CDarnic\u2014you bastaaaaaaaaaaaard!!\u201D</p><p>Even Lancer\u2019s shout, which was filled with the deepest hatred and despair, didn\u2019t reach Darnic.</p><p>\u201C\u2014I\u2019m, not, a vampire\u2026 I\u2019m, not\u2026!\u201D</p><p>That trembling mutter was the last of the reason of Heroic Spirit Vlad III. And then his Master Darnic smashed it into tiny pieces.</p><p>\u201CNo, you are a vampire. The vampire Dracula, a creature pitifully burdened with infamy due to literary works. I order you with a second Command Spell. Continue to survive until you obtain the Greater Grail.\u201D</p><p>Lancer of Black howled and leapt at his Master Darnic. While giving a faint smile, Darnic let himself be struck in the chest.</p><p>In the span of a second, his chest was pierced through. His body collapsed. Fresh blood flew through the air and rained down on Lancer\u2019s face. And the one who laughed loudly at it\u2014was Darnic.</p><p>\u201CHahahahaha! How rude of me, my Servant! As an apology, you can drink my blood! You really are a blood-sucking vampire, the king who rules the night! Your wish is unnecessary. I will bequeath you my dream, my wish, my very existence! I order you with a third Command Spell. Engrave my existence into your soul, Lancer!\u201D</p><p>\u201CWh\u2014at?\u2019</p><p>Did that whisper came from one person or everyone present there? Regardless, they were all shocked by Lancer of Black killing his Master and the third order that Master had spoken with a Command Spell.</p><p>Servants could devour the souls of humans and convert them into prana. This was their privilege as spiritual beings. Humans could only transfer souls between vessels or observe them.</p><p>But this magus Darnic was an exception. He had devoted his attention to the soul which should have been impossible to convert and transform with magecraft and was useless as nourishment.</p><p>\u2026Most likely, it was due to having fought alongside a Servant in the third Holy Grail War. Or perhaps he had accomplished this great exploit out of fear of that prediction a certain magus had told him.</p><p>Darnic had worked out a spell to turn the souls of others into nourishment for himself\u2026 However, it was a form of curse that was exceedingly close to being taboo. It wasn\u2019t a matter of ethics. If it was for the sake of his own life, he wouldn\u2019t balk at even crushing the head of a baby.</p><p>But this spell was far too dangerous. It was a risky piece of High-Thaumaturgy that, if something was off even by only a few millimeters, would instantly lead to his own death. The actual number of times he had consumed souls during the past sixty years was only three times.</p><p>He had held the ritual under as perfect conditions as conceivably possible each of those three times, but even so, the precision ratio of his body and soul had been reduced to sixty percent. \u2018Someone\u2019 who wasn\u2019t himself was gradually coming to rule over him little by little.</p><p>Most likely, even if he perfectly accomplished the next ritual, he would no longer be \u2018Darnic Prestone Yggdmillennia\u2019, but someone else instead. Even if he had his memories, even if every detail was perfectly recorded\u2014it wouldn\u2019t be him.</p><p>In other words, for Darnic to consume the soul of Lancer, a Servant, without even conducting the ritual was nothing other than a genuine suicidal act.</p><p>After all, it was the soul of a Heroic Spirit. A vast and enormous soul of the finest quality that could activate the Greater Grail with seven of them. Therefore, it should have been impossible for a human who wasn\u2019t a [vessel] or anything else to consume such a thing.</p><p>\u201CNo way, that\u2019s impossible\u2026!!\u201D</p><p>That\u2019s why it was only natural for Archer of Black to murmur in shock.</p><p>\u201C\u2014A Command Spell. No, even with that it\u2019s impossible. Darnic\u2026 no, the current you\u2026 is neither Darnic nor Vlad III.\u201D</p><p>Lancer of Black\u2026 no, the \u2018person\u2019 who was neither Lancer nor Darnic smiled fearlessly.</p><p>\u201CExactly, Archer. Even if, with, the third, Command Spell, I took the soul of the, Heroic Spirit Vlad III into myself, to the utmost limit\u2026 it isn\u2019t possible to control a Heroic Spirit. Let alone take one into oneself.\u201D</p><p>His thin sneering voice was already difficult to distinguish between that of Darnic\u2019s or Vlad III\u2019s.</p><p>\u201CBut, but. I can engrave into it. I can engrave, my thoughts of a hundred years\u2026 my tenacity for the Holy Grail\u2026 I am no longer either Darnic or Vlad III! I am just a monster that only seeks the Holy Grail, and I don\u2019t care about being one\u2026!\u201D</p><p>In the first place, even if the summoning of the Heroic Spirit was accomplished using a holy relic as the foundation, their spiritual nature tended to be close to that of their Master. Darnic and Vlad III, who wanted to wipe away their disgrace and infamy\u2026 in other words, held excessive confidence and pride in themselves, resembled each other closely on the level of the mind and soul.</p><p>Furthermore, even if it was for a short time, they had spent many days together as Master and Servant. If the binding of the third Command Spell was added to that, it became possible to even engrave the identity of [Darnic Prestone Yggdmillennia] into the tremendous soul of a Heroic Spirit.</p><p>The tenacity of this magus had, even if just slightly, surpassed that of the Heroic Spirit.</p><p>\u201CStop!! Stop, stop, stop, stop, please stop\u2026!! I am the King of Wallachia, the son of Vlad II\u2014don\u2019t enter inside meeeeeeeeeeeee!\u201D</p><p>Lancer of Black cried out, his form already filled with hatred. But his face was already rearranging to an extremely vague visage that was both like that of Darnic and of Vlad III. It was just like an amorphous monster.</p><p>\u201CNow with this, you are me and I am you. My lord! No, vampire! Your power will become our shared property! Everything is for the sake of the Holy Grail! My dream, my wish will take root within you and continue on for eternity!\u201D</p><p>Darnic Prestone Yggdmillenia. He had now become a parasite within the soul of the Heroic Spirit Vlad III with the viciousness of a cancer.</p><p>\u201CY-You bastaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaard!!\u201D</p><p>\u2014This isn\u2019t good.</p><p>As someone who had devoted himself to [looking at others], Lancer of Red immediately drew near and with his spear, tried to pierce through Lancer of Black\u2019s chest from the back. He didn\u2019t think it was cowardly; in the first place, the one who had looked away in the middle of battle was Lancer of Black.</p><p>He pierced the heart where the spiritual core was. Almost all servants would die without question at this point. Heroic Spirits who were recognized for their stamina could still remained connected to the current age even after that, but Vlad III, who had unfortunately lost his fame, wasn\u2019t such a powerful Servant.</p><p>That\u2019s right. If the Servant that Lancer of Red had stabbed was Vlad III, that is.</p><p>\u201C\u2026!!\u201D</p><p>Lancer of Red should have definitely pierced the heart of this land\u2019s lord who had shown his defenceless back.</p><p>But he neither vanished nor even turned around. Instead of blood, a black shadowy something began leaking out from the spot he had stabbed.</p><p>Lancer of Red stared his spear and murmured.</p><p>\u201C\u2026I definitely felt feedback, but attacks like that have been reduced to having no effect, huh?\u201D</p><p>\u201CLancer, your spear had no effect?\u201D</p><p>Archer of Red couldn\u2019t hide her shock. Like her bow, Lancer\u2019s spear was a great weapon bequeathed from the gods. For it not to have any effect after being driven into an enemy Servant\u2019s spiritual core meant\u2014</p><p>\u201CIf it was before he became a vampire, it probably would have destroyed his spiritual core like normal and killed him.\u201D</p><p>Bats gathered together and combined together into the form of a person.</p><p>\u201CBut what stands before us is not Lancer of Black, Vlad III. It is the creature known and feared throughout the world\u2014a vampire.\u201D</p><p>Vampires called Dead Apostles existed in this world. Some slipped in among people and sucked their blood while others remained in isolation without coming into contact with anyone, but either way, Dead Apostles possessed their own unique concepts and culture and lived quietly in the shadows of the world.</p><p>Right now, the one in front of the gathered Servants wasn\u2019t such a vampire. In terms of the concept of mystery, it was only a hundred years old. But the terror of it covered the entire world. When people heard the word \u2018vampire\u2019, what they first thought of wasn\u2019t the Dead Apostles who hide themselves from the rest of the world, but the one who had been created using the great hero of Romania, Vlad III, as a base\u2014the \u2018vampire Dracula\u2019.</p><p>\u201C\u2014It\u2019s a monster.\u201D</p><p>Lancer of Red\u2019s frank feelings were agreed with by all the Servants gathered there.</p><p>Having completely regained human form, the vampire faced the Servants. There was cruelty in his eyes, but his gaze wasn\u2019t brimming with intelligence.</p><p>His elegant, black aristocratic clothes were torn to shreds\u2014and from within them, shadows with mass began to spill out instead of blood or flesh.</p><p>The spear Lancer of Black had held vanished like dust at the same time as his aspect as a hero was extinguished.</p><p>\u201C\u2026Now then, return my Holy Grail. I must grant my clan\u2019s dearest wish with that Greater Grail. Yes, in order to grant my longstanding desire, I must infinitely and inexhaustibly survive. I must increase my bloodline. I must gather talent, effort and a nurturing environment and give birth to those who will follow after me. So, give back the Greater Grail\u2026 give it back, give it back, give it back, give it baaaaaaaaaaaack!!\u201D</p><p>\u2014That shout had Darnic\u2019s selfish dream and his instincts as a vampire mixed together into it.</p><p>He had thrown away all of his humanity not for the sake of reaching the Root, but rather for the preceding step\u2014to increase one\u2019s clan.</p><p>He had to increase his bloodline\u2014for the sake of his clan.</p><p>He had to become stronger\u2014for the sake of his clan.</p><p>The wish he would ask of the Greater Grail was to propagate himself, augment himself and increase himself. The man who had confused his love for his clan and his own deep-rooted and delusional convictions refused to understand how destructive his dream was.</p><p>All that was left was merely a creature that didn\u2019t hide his cruel, blood-red eyes and bared his fangs. He slowly looked around as if surveying his surroundings and then focused on a single point.</p><p>This \u2018nameless creature\u2019 had already sniffed out the location of the Greater Grail where it had been brought into these gardens.</p><p>\u201CHah. Regardless, the fact that you\u2019re a monster far off from the gods doesn\u2019t change!\u201D</p><p>Rider of Red stepped forward. Holding his hero-slaying spear in one hand, he closed the distance between himself and the vampire in an instant with his swift feet. He threw his spear at the same time as he leapt forward, and it closed in on the vampire with the speed of a bullet.</p><p>\u201CNo!\u201D</p><p>The voice of restraint came from Archer of Black. But it was too late. The spear had already been brought to a halt.</p><p>\u201CWha\u2026!?\u201D</p><p>It was a sure-kill spear that he had thrown fast enough to surpass the sound barrier. And yet the spear that should have been close to impossible to evade had been stopped by one of the vampire\u2019s hands.</p><p>It was like grabbing a flying missile bare-handed. Naturally, his hand\u2019s flesh was torn to shreds, his nerves were snapped apart, and his bones were smashed loudly.</p><p>But the vampire\u2019s regenerative ability worked far faster than the speed at which he was wounded. Even the sight of his hand regenerating from its snapped ends looked disgusting.</p><p>The vampire laughed and jumped at Rider of Red. Having just jumped himself, Rider couldn\u2019t stop himself from being pushed down to the ground. But even so, Rider was still composed. As long as the enemy didn\u2019t have the blood of the gods, no attack would affect his body, so it was only natural he would feel that way.</p><p>The instant the vampire bared his fangs, Rider immediately held out his arm to protect himself, most likely due to his abundant accumulated battle experience and survival instincts warning him. The moment he was bitten, he felt a strange itchiness.</p><p>\u2014Poison!?</p><p>The next instant, he was sent flying by a strong kick from Archer of Black. The fangs came out of his arm and the itchiness disappeared.</p><p>After standing up while groaning, Rider of Red protested to his teacher Archer.</p><p>\u201CWhat are you doing all of a sudden, sensei!?\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2026It\u2019s true that attacks against you won\u2019t have any effect without the [Divinity] skill. And due to your Bravery skill, not even bewitching spells that interfere with the mind will affect you. But even without the blood of the gods, there exists ways to turn you into an ally.\u201D</p><p>Archer nocked an arrow to his bow and, without hesitation, fired it at the vampire who should have been his ally only minutes ago. But even after the arrow pierced him, the vampire calmly pulled it out. Not a single drop of blood came out, and his wound closed at once.</p><p>\u201CThat wasn\u2019t an attack just now, but rather the act of blood-sucking. It wasn\u2019t intended to kill you, but to transform you into his comrade. Your body is virtually invincible against ill will and killing intent. But it was requested that part of you be weak. Yes, in other words\u2014\u201D</p><p>Rider of Red\u2019s\u2014Achilles\u2019 mother, the goddess Thetis, had tried to extinguish his human blood and turn him completely into a god by bathing him in holy flames when he was a baby. Though it had been stopped midway by her husband Peleus, his entire body except his heel became immortal.</p><p>As a result, no form of attack would have any effect on Achilles, but\u2026 that special characteristic of his had two pitfalls. First, he could be wounded by those with the blood of the gods like himself. And second, when faced not with an attack, but instead\u2014</p><p>\u201C\u2026Against an act that displays friendship, my invincibility does not apply.\u201D</p><p>Rider of Red made a displeased expression as he finished Archer\u2019s explanation himself. Archer of Black nodded without smiling.</p><p>The vampire turned to face an unexpected direction with a twitch. He grimaced with displeasure and threw Rider of Red\u2019s spear from his hand. He aimed not at any of the gathered Red and Black Servants, but at a girl who had just come running here.</p><p>\u2014There was a shining flash that seemed to tear through the darkness.</p><p>Rider of Red\u2019s spear was knocked down without reaching the girl. Her flag that fluttered in the wind was a first-rate holy weapon that could smash any kind of darkness.</p><p>\u201CRuler\u2026!\u201D</p><p>At Archer of Red\u2019s shout, everyone else turned to gaze at her. Lancer of Red, who had tried to kill her once before, was also among them, but Ruler took no notice of him\u2014she just glared fervently at the vampire that had just been born here.</p><p>\u201CVlad III\u2026 no, you are a vampire, and Darnic as well\u2026\u201D</p><p>The vampire, who had abandoned even his existence as a Servant, couldn\u2019t be bound with Ruler\u2019s Command Spells. Lancer of Black was in a state close to vanishing, and even if she ordered him to kill himself with a Command Spell, the parasite within him, Darnic, could reject it.</p><p>Ruler had already deemed this vampire as being the greatest threat that could destroy the Holy Grail War.</p><p>He was neither a proud Heroic Spirit nor even a Servant. He was simply a \u2018nameless creature\u2019 that had gained the power of a vampire and lost any trace of morality.</p><p>The most troublesome part of all was his \u2018concept\u2019. Even under normal circumstances, Vlad III\u2014was mixed with the legend of Kaziklu Bey, the Lord of Impalement, and the legend of a vampire that was associated with him. It was possible that the power and fame of Vlad III would be adopted by the vampire here as well.</p><p>If he reached the Greater Grail and he was released from the Hanging Gardens\u2026 Romania would likely turn into hell in a single day.</p><p>It was something that mixed, joined and fused together history and legend. It would become a Grand Guignol that simply slaughtered the people who dwelled in this country. Someone with a heart might call this tragedy thus.</p><p>That is\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014the [Night of Wallachia].</p><p>Just as Assassin of Red had said, Ruler had to take him down before anything else.</p><p>\u201CIn order to safeguard the conductance of the Holy Grail War, I ask that you all temporarily join forces.\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2026Hoh. So our enemy is this vampire, huh?\u201D</p><p>Ruler nodded at Archer of Red\u2019s words.</p><p>\u201CYes. I request that we maintain a truce amongst each other until he is defeated. We cannot let this vampire reach the Holy Grail\u2026 Absolutely not.\u201D</p><p>The vampire seemed to wait in anticipation even as he heard those commands, simply glaring at Ruler. Ruler raised her left hand and spoke clearly.</p><p>\u201CIn the name of Ruler\u2014of Jeanne d\u2019Arc. I order all Servants gathered here with my Command Spells! Defeat the vampire who was once Vlad III!\u201D</p><p>The Command Spells engraved on her left hand released an intense light. Chains of commandment coiled around Archer of Black, Caster of Black, Archer of Red, Lancer of Red and Rider of Red.</p><p>Those chains weren\u2019t an impediment if they fought the vampire\u2014rather, they would raise the abilities of all the Servants as long as they were fighting him. But if they tried to fight the group that had temporarily joined together to oppose the vampire, their movements would dull, and the strength to wield their weapons would weaken at once.</p><p>In that case, it was obvious whom they should fight. In the first place, they were heroes, men and woman of valor who fought to defeat monsters, demons and man-eating fiends.</p><p>\u201C\u2014Very well. I\u2019ll provide support along with Archer of Black. Rider, Lancer, you two move as you wish.\u201D</p><p>\u201CRoger that, Nee-san. So that\u2019s how it is, Lancer.\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2026I don\u2019t mind.\u201D</p><p>\u201CCaster. Can you make shackles with golems like you did when we captured Berserker of Red?\u201D</p><p>\u201CIt\u2019s not that I can\u2019t, but it won\u2019t work like it did with Berserker. It will only dull his movements a bit. Also, it\u2019ll be pointless if he changes form into mist or bats.\u201D</p><p>Caster of Black manipulated his fingers in the air, and ten golems started moving smoothly. One finger for each golem. With just that, the ten golems attacked the vampire, each with completely different movements.</p><p>Compared to this, the golems that had operated autonomously on the battlefield were mere puppets.</p><p>While dodging the arms that the vampire lashed out with, the golems struck at him with their bronze fists. Even after being hit by strong blows that would considerably damage even a normal Servant, he just casually counterattacked.</p><p>But now that Ruler had given an edict with her Command Spells, he had not a single ally, and everyone that stood around him was his enemy.</p><p>Rider and Lancer of Red matched their timing and attacked with each of their spears. On one hand was a hero-slaying spear bequeathed from Rider\u2019s teacher, and on the other was a spear of light that was said to be capable of even killing gods.</p><p>Furthermore, the two Archers, who boasted of talent that reached the domain of the gods, fired arrows in succession through the gaps between their two spearmen allies without minding them as they approached the enemy.</p><p>And in addition to this, Ruler, Jeanne d\u2019Arc, was also added to their forces. She used her holy flag which the vampire was weak against and systemically knocked down the vampire\u2019s arms as he tried to extend them.</p><p>They were six in total. Six Servants who were all worthy of being called the strongest. However, there was not the slightest bit of relaxation shown on any of their faces. It wasn\u2019t in order to stop themselves from being negligent. They really were desperate.</p><p>\u201CKuh, he\u2019s turned into mist again\u2014!!\u201D</p><p>Vlad III had been summoned as Lancer of Black, and had been given the Noble Phantasm Kaziklu Bey: Lord of Execution that came from his affinity as the Lord of Impalement as long as he was within his dominion.</p><p>By becoming a vampire and taking in Darnic, those had all been sealed away, but he had been given new weapons. The various unmatched abilities possessed by those known as vampires.</p><p>A black cloak that melted into the night and stakes that stabbed out from inside it had been summoned forth. Since they weren\u2019t summoned from the ground, there was no fear of a surprise attack, but\u2014the stakes were thrown with the superhuman strength of a vampire, breaking the sound barrier as if it were extremely natural.</p><p>\u201CTch, how troublesome\u2026!!\u201D</p><p>Rider of Red stepped into range and rapidly snapped them away with his spear. Generally speaking, there was no one among these Servants present who could beat him in terms of speed. It was the same even if he wasn\u2019t mounted on his chariot. There was no one, either before or after his death, who had beaten the great hero Achilles of the Trojan War in speed.</p><p>Though he was one step slower than Rider, Lancer of Red was also quick-witted and agile. He smashed all the stakes that had been shooting at him since earlier.</p><p>But\u2014at last, one of the mass-produced spears seized Lancer of Red\u2019s foot. It pierced through the top of his foot with power equal to that of a Noble Phantasm. The moment he tried to pull it out, Lancer\u2019s movements stopped slightly.</p><p>With his terrifying superhuman strength, the vampire simply hit him with a punch. Just that was enough to send Lancer flying into a wall. The damage itself was insignificant, but Lancer couldn\u2019t hide his surprise at how the vampire had overpowered him with just his overwhelming physical strength.</p><p>Rider of Red reflexively turned his gaze to the wall that Lancer had collided against. When he did that, the vampire attacked Rider as if he had intentionally aimed for that. He bared his fangs in order to suck Rider\u2019s blood and turn him into one of his kind.</p><p>Lancer of Red prevented him from doing so by throwing his spear at him.</p><p>\u201C\u2014Tenacity, malice, or perhaps conviction based on flawed beliefs. Neither a magus nor a hero, you are no longer anyone now. Your agony over having become \u2018something not yourself\u2019 isn\u2019t half-hearted. Don\u2019t leave any regrets or lingering attachments behind, monster. Just swiftly disappear.\u201D</p><p>It was true that, just as Lancer of Red had pointed out, the creature\u2019s agony was extraordinary.</p><p>The sensation of his very self completely disappearing. It couldn\u2019t be helped that even his own name, which could be called the foundation of a human being, felt like someone else\u2019s to him.</p><p>Who am I, what am I\u2014even those questions faded away.</p><p>What he clung to was solely the order that had been given to him with the second Command Spell. Even when surrounded by six Servants and with his core self fading away even now, the vampire still howled loudly.</p><p>\u201C\u2026Ha, haha! No! As if I\u2019ll let myself die or be killed yet! No, I won\u2019t die until I obtain the Greater Grail!\u201D</p><p>When arrows pierced him, he would turn completely into mist and bats, and on top of that would turn into a giant savage dog baring its fangs. He continuously changed his form, and his superhuman strength and claws tore through not only the golems, but even occasionally the two Archers, approaching them with speed that resembled teleportation.</p><p>\u2014However, with all six Servants attacking him together, the situation wasn\u2019t at a disadvantage for them. Considering the battle as a whole, the Servants led by Ruler could be said to be the ones dominating in this situation. After all, it would be fine as long as they could buy time. When dawn came, the vampire\u2019s power would drop sharply. It would be easy to kill him then.</p><p>The problem was that he was trying to head towards where the Greater Grail was stored. Even while fighting, the vampire continued to remain obsessed on the Greater Grail due to the second Command Spell his Master Darnic had used and also Darnic\u2019s own will.</p><p>What should happen if he reached the Greater Grail? What would he wish for with that swirl of prana that had been accumulated over sixty years? If he had even a fragment of reason left, his wish would be definitely be the final goal of magecraft\u2014in other words, to reach the Root.</p><p>But, if even that fragment of reason had been lost, his wish would probably be something exceedingly destructive.</p><p>\u2014It will definitely be the latter.</p><p>And Ruler had a premonition. That he would wish for destruction with the Greater Grail. As long as the Greater Grail wasn\u2019t completely activated, there was a chance it wouldn\u2019t grant his wish, but Ruler was not so foolish as to simply hope for the best.</p><p>The six Servants split into vanguard and rear guard and continued fighting efficiently.</p><p>We can do it.</p><p>All the Servants gathered there were certain of it. It was slow going, but the speed of their attacks had started to win against the regeneration of his wounds. Even when he turned into mist, the flames from Lancer of Red\u2019s [Prana Burst] didn\u2019t give him the leisure to run away.</p><p>The vampire unleashed an attack with a hateful gaze, but it was blocked by Lancer of Red coming to the forefront. However\u2014</p><p>Far too abruptly and without any warning, all the Red Servants fell to their knees with anguished expressions and stopped moving.</p><p>\u201CGuh\u2026 what\u2026!?\u201D</p><p>\u201CIs it, our Masters\u2026!?\u201D</p><p>Though it was only for an instant, their existences terribly weakened. The vampire didn\u2019t overlook that short opening and jumped over them to begin running towards the Greater Grail.</p><p>\u201C\u2014Wait!!\u201D</p><p>Ruler and Archer of Black began running after him at the same time. Was the chill Ruler had felt since earlier due to fear of the vampire having his wish granted?</p><p>Casting aside such thoughts, she concentrated on running with intense speed and chasing after the vampire. Fortunately, the prana of the Greater Grail could be sensed even from here. There was no way they could miss it.</p><p>But\u2014the vampire was fast!</p><p>\u201CArcher of Black, stop his legs!\u201D</p><p>At Ruler\u2019s order, Archer nocked arrows on his bow without saying anything or decelerating at all, and shot five of them in succession as strafing fire. All the arrows pierced through the vampire\u2019s legs and waist, just as he had aimed for. But then the vampire changed into bats.</p><p>His speed had dulled a little, but it hadn\u2019t managed to stop him. Shaking his head, Archer of Black focused on pursuing him.</p><p>\u201C\u2026Archer of Black, do you know the reason why the Red Servants stopped moving just now?\u201D</p><p>\u201CNo. I thought the effect of your Command Spells might have worn off, but\u2014it doesn\u2019t seem so.\u201D</p><p>Archer of Black sensed power gushing from inside his body that was separate from the prana supply from his Master. This was most likely the boost effect from Ruler\u2019s Command Spell.</p><p>Ruler was also bothered by it. Had the Red Masters disagreed with fighting together with the Black camp? \u2026No, in that case, they would have first told their Servants. What happened just now was if\u2014</p><p>The bats flying ahead of them were suddenly shot down one by one. Contracting lights like fine threads were shot one after another from far down the hallway ahead.</p><p>\u201CKuh\u2026 so she doesn\u2019t care if they hit us either!\u201D</p><p>However, those lights were also inevitably strafing Ruler and Archer who were chasing after the vampire. The shooter, Assassin of Red, probably didn\u2019t take that into account at all. She seemed to think that her own power alone was enough to take down the vampire.</p><p>But that was negligent. The bats returned to the form of the vampire once more and, even with his entire body being torn apart by the lights, he regained his speed by prioritizing the regeneration of his feet alone.</p><p>Rather than running, he simply advanced forward determinedly by repeatedly crashing into walls like a flexible ball. Eventually, the vampire found a door. If he passed through it, he would find what he sought there. The almighty wish-granting device that would release the violent emotions gushing inside his chest was behind that door.</p><p>\u2014Just a little more, and my wish will be granted.</p><p>Three Servants, consisting of Berserker of Black, Berserker of Red and Saber of Black, should already be stored in the Lesser Grail. Saber of Black had been re-summoned due to a miraculous phenomenon, but there were still two Servants collected in the Lesser Grail. If it was a small-scale wish\u2014in other words, as long as it wasn\u2019t a wish as great as wishing for the world itself to change and transform, he should be able to forcefully activate the Greater Grail and have it grant his wish.</p><p>The propagation, augmentation and supplementation of his flesh. There should be no problem with a wish of that level.</p><p>Darnic Prestone Yggdmillennia. That name already seemed like that of someone else to him now.</p><p>But he understood that that man had sought the Holy Grail and he was now here at the end of that search. So\u2014rejoice, Darnic. Your wish will soon be granted!</p><p>He opened the door without hesitating for an instant, and there lay precisely what he wished for. The broad stairway of sun-dried bricks before his eyes headed straight down and, at the bottom there was a gigantic structure standing there that seemed to pierce through the top floor of the building in which it was contained.</p><p>Filled with pale white light, it was the almighty wish-granting device\u2014Fuyuki\u2019s Greater Grail.</p><p>\u201C\u2014Ah.\u201D</p><p>He had stolen the march on not only many Servants, but even Ruler. The vampire had reached it at last. Now he just had to forcefully activate the Greater Grail and grant his wish\u2026</p><p>\u201CThat\u2019s far enough, Darnic Prestone Yggdmillennia.\u201D</p><p>A person stood halfway down the steps to the Greater Grail. Judging that it was a Master and not a Servant, the vampire had decided to kill him.</p><p>But he reflexively came to a stop when he heard those words, as if held back by them. Though it would have been better to just go down and kill him without breaking a sweat, \u2018something\u2019 about that voice bothered him.</p><p>\u201C\u2026Who are you?\u201D</p><p>At the sound of the person\u2019s footsteps, the vampire reflexively drew back. He felt a chill. His instincts were telling him that he mustn\u2019t meet with the person in front of him. It was a bomb. The fuse had already been lit and a shattering explosion was less than a few seconds away.</p><p>Standing before the vampire was a tanned-skinned youth. He wore a gentle smile and declared thus solemnly.</p><p>\u201COr perhaps I should call you the remains of Darnic. I honestly admire that tenacity of yours. But I\u2019ll never hand over the Holy Grail to you. Much less now that you\u2019ve been reduced to a vampire.\u201D</p><p>It exploded. Within Darnic were memories of the past that he absolutely wouldn\u2019t forget even if he forgot his own name. The Third Holy Grail War that he had desperately fought to the bitter end in as a magus\u2014he would absolutely never forget that battle which had been the start of everything.</p><p>That\u2019s why he was shocked now.</p><p>\u201C\u2026That\u2019s, impossible.\u201D</p><p>\u201COh my. Those are truly banal words, coming from you, Darnic. Since you managed to survive, then there\u2019s nothing to be surprised about me surviving as well.\u201D</p><p>\u201CThat\u2019s, impossible! No way! Why!? Why are you here!? Why are you still alive\u2026!?\u201D</p><p>The youth shrugged his shoulders and spoke in a very aloof manner.</p><p>\u201C\u2014Naturally, it\u2019s because I\u2019m participating in this Great Holy Grail War. As a Master of the Red camp.\u201D</p><p>It was an absolutely impossible declaration to the vampire. Ignoring the speechlessness of vampire, the youth shouted in an increasingly louder voice.</p><p>\u201CI\u2019ve waited for this moment, Darnic! Fuyuki\u2019s Greater Grail belongs to me! Whether you be a magus or a vampire\u2014I will never hand over this Greater Grail to the likes of you who can do nothing but drive the world to destruction!\u201D</p><p>At those words, the vampire was freed from the shackles of fear that had unconsciously bound him.</p><p>\u201C\u2026Don\u2019t screw with meeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!!\u201D</p><p>Enraged, the vampire took a step forward to rush at him\u2014and fell down in an ungainly manner.</p><p>\u201CGuh\u2026!?\u201D</p><p>When he looked down, something sharp and pointed was stabbed into his knees. These were the thrown-type Conceptual Weapons that were favored by agents of the Church\u2014 [Black Keys].</p><p>\u201CYou are a vampire. Unfortunately, vampires must also have various weaknesses as compensation for their unmatched strength. Sunshine weakens them, and they are weak against holy symbols. And\u2014they are also weak against weapons meant for purification like Black Keys.\u201D</p><p>Yes, what the youth said was certainly correct. A Church agent\u2019s Black Keys were Conceptual Weapons strong enough to purify Dead Apostles.</p><p>But the power of his Black Keys was far too extraordinary\u2026 no, abnormal.</p><p>Coolly and solemnly, the tanned-skin youth spoke in praise of another.</p><p>\u201CNo, compared to Ruler who was chasing you, someone like me is worthless. I\u2019m just a worthless, unacknowledged sham of a saint. However, I have enough power to pulverize your current self.\u201D</p><p>His red holy shroud fluttered, and silver blades flew out. The Black Keys stabbed around the vampire, suppressing any counterattack, and the youth grabbed the vampire\u2019s face.</p><p>The youth\u2019s presence suddenly transformed. He was no longer a Master now, but someone different. Yes, this was the one who had fought to the death against the Servant Darnic had summoned in the past\u2014</p><p>\u201CThen, it\u2019s time for prayer. \u2014Nameless vampire.\u201D</p><p>\u201CI will kill. I will let live. I will harm and heal. None will escape me. None will escape my sight.\u201D</p><p>The vampire shrieked and struggled with his limbs.</p><p>But the hands grasping him tightened on the face of the vampire as if in a vice.</p><p>\u201CBe crushed. I welcome those who have grown old and those who have lost. Devote yourself to me, learn from me, and obey me. Rest. Do not forget song, do not forget prayer, and do not forget me. I am light and relieve you of all your burdens.\u201D</p><p>The youth quickly lifted the vampire up the stairs and dashed through the hallway while still holding him. Physical strength wasn\u2019t an issue here. This was a clash of conviction and faith.</p><p>So there was no way that this \u2018unknown person\u2019, who had been reduced to a vampire, could match this youth\u2019s faith that was as hard as steel and as sharp as a sword.</p><p>\u2014His existence was being erased with just a few words. The Greater Grail that should have been in reach of his hand just earlier was getting further and further away before his eyes. That filled him with regret.</p><p>\u201CDo not pretend. Retribution for forgiveness, betrayal for trust, despair for hope, darkness for light, dark death for the living.\u201D</p><p>The youth\u2019s dark and ageless eyes, together with the chant, stabbed into the vampire like a blade. It was an extraordinarily powerful Baptism Rite that wasn\u2019t possible for a human.</p><p>\u2014And why did he have to be killed by him of all people? The vampire could understand if it was a Servant. He would be tormented by regret if it were a Master. But this was too incomprehensible. A meteorite crashing into his head would be more understandable than this.</p><p>\u201CRelief is in my hands. I will add oil to your sins and leave a mark. Eternal life is given through death. \u2014\u2014Ask for forgiveness here. I, the incarnation, will swear.\u201D</p><p>\u2014Ah, ah, ah! My Holy Grail, my dream (illusion)! My Holy Grail! My dream (wish)! It\u2019s still unfulfilled, unfulfilled, unfulfilled!!</p><p>The vampire crashed against a door as he was pushed along. Not minding the details, the youth simply continued running forward at full speed. The door was smashed apart and the youth stepped inside. The room was a chapel. The youth ran through the chapel\u2019s nave\u2014and, in the presence of God, he spoke the final holy words with a gaze filled with compassion and pity.</p><p>\u2014But why?</p><p>\u201CKyrie Eleison: I grant compassion onto this soul.\u201D</p><p>The entire body of the [nameless monster], who had once been a devout believer and king of a land and who had also once been a magus before becoming no one in the end, began to emit white smoke. He was melting. Not his flesh, but his very existence was melting away.</p><p>While leaving behind moans of regret and gasps of despair, the vampire evaporated away right down to the final fragment of himself. The hero who saved his homeland and the leader of a clan who commanded many magi were already dead.</p><p>The past kings were dead, and the current king raised a loud song of victory.</p><p>And it was then that Ruler and the other Servants that had been chasing the vampire stepped into the chapel.</p><p>\u201CHere\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026!?\u201D</p><p>Strangely enough, those two met in a chapel, a place suitable for the two of them. The vampire, having melted away in the center of the chapel nave, no longer moved or spoke. He had evaporated away. His soul had returned to where it should be.</p><p>Standing calmly beside his corpse was a youth. He had tanned skin and white hair like silver, and he wore a red stole and mantle over his cassock.</p><p>The instant she saw him, Ruler understood everything.</p><p>\u201C\u2026No, way.\u201D</p><p>Because she understood, she gasped. Impossible, it couldn\u2019t be. The youth in front of her\u2014was a Servant. No, if it were just that, it would be fine. A Master being a Servant deviated from the rules, but at the very least, it would be a conceivable possibility.</p><p>But the problem was his class. He wasn\u2019t Saber, Archer, Lancer, Rider, Berserker, Caster or Assassin.</p><p>\u201C\u2014How do you do? Ruler of this war.\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2026A sixteenth Servant\u2026!?\u201D</p><p>Even the calm and collected Archer of Black couldn\u2019t hide his surprise. The same went for the Red Servants who had arrived after frantically following behind Archer and Ruler.</p><p>The youth they had thought was a Master was definitely openly exuding the spiritual nature of a Servant from himself.</p><p>\u201CI\u2019m not the sixteenth, Chiron. The sixteenth is Ruler beside you. Strictly speaking, I am the first Servant.\u201D</p><p>\u201CMaster of Assassin\u2026 What have you done to our Masters!?\u201D</p><p>In response to Archer of Red\u2019s enraged question, the youth chuckled and held up one arm, rolling back the sleeve covering it. Everyone gasped as they looked at it.</p><p>Engraved on it was all the respective Command Spells for Archer of Red, Lancer of Red, Rider of Red, Berserker of Red, Caster of Red and Assassin of Red\u2014eighteen Command Spells in total.</p><p>\u201CI peacefully had them turn over their rights as Masters and each of their three Command Spells. Don\u2019t worry, the prana necessary to keep you all in this world is a trivial amount to supply now that I\u2019m connected to the Greater Grail.\u201D</p><p>\u201CPeacefully\u2014?\u201D</p><p>The youth nodded at the murmur spoken by someone, and spoke while glancing at Lancer of Red.</p><p>\u201CAfter all, our camp\u2019s Lancer is a hero of charity who excels at seeing through people\u2019s lies. That\u2019s why I had to have things proceed according to our plan without lying as much as possible. The reason I purposefully had my orders conveyed via your Masters was for the sake of that. Yes, your Masters didn\u2019t lie. They think that they gave directions according to their own judgement\u2026 even now.\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2014Yes. What I sensed, what God warned me of was you, I see now.\u201D</p><p>\u201CI wonder about that. I have no intention of defying God, though.\u201D</p><p>Even without thinking deeply about it, everything about Jeanne d\u2019Arc\u2019s summoning had strange from the beginning. A possession summoning by borrowing a human\u2019s body. At first she had thought it was because this war had an unprecedented summoning of fourteen Servants, but when she thought about it, it was the opposite. If it was a situation where it was inevitable that chaos and mayhem would be caused by fourteen Servants, the Greater Grail would have correctly accomplished Ruler\u2019s summoning at all costs.</p><p>The reason it couldn\u2019t do so was because the Greater Grail\u2019s identity recognition was confused by the absolutely impossible situation of there being two Rulers existing at once.</p><p>In that case, it was obvious that it would be confused how to properly summon the one being summoned second. And the reason this priest had run away from her was also because she was Ruler. Because of the skill that Ruler possessed as one of her privileges\u2014[True Name Discernment].</p><p>This skill, which exposed the class and true names of other Servants, was naturally effective even on Servants that had achieved incarnation. In the worst case scenario, if he had met her on the battlefield, the youth\u2019s plan would have failed.</p><p>\u201CYou are\u2026 the Ruler who was summoned in the Third Holy Grail War in Fuyuki.\u201D</p><p>Every Servant gathered there gasped at Ruler\u2019s words.</p><p>\u201CYes. It would have been troublesome if I met you face-to-face before I became their official Master. After all, you have Command Spells. If you realized who I was, everything would have come to nothing, right? I won\u2019t let you get in the way of my dream.\u201D</p><p>There was no hatred in the youth\u2019s voice. But there was a resolute will in it. Persuading him was impossible, and this youth wouldn\u2019t stop unless he was killed\u2014Ruler was certain of that.</p><p>Ruler gazed at the youth with her amethyst-like eyes, and called him by his name.</p><p>\u201C\u2014What is your objective, Amakusa Shirou Tokisada?\u201D</p><p>\u201CThat\u2019s obvious. It\u2019s the salvation of all humanity, Jeanne d\u2019Arc.\u201D</p><p>The boy and the girl were famed and extolled for creating \u2018miracles\u2019 by the unrewarded masses and the soldiers who chased after their backs.</p><p>Unable to forgive each other\u2019s existence, they quietly glared at each other.</p><p><img src="https://i2.lensdump.com/i/1mojrZ.webp" alt=""></p><h2 id="afterword" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#afterword" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Afterword</h2><h3 id="haganeya-jin" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#haganeya-jin" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Haganeya Jin</h3><hr><p>\u2014Let me tell you about a certain man.</p><p>From the time we first met, he was connected to pathology.</p><p>Dual pistols, doves, the church. Zombies, chainsaws, bloodbaths.</p><p>Other people scorn those dumb things. He rejoices at those dumb things.</p><p>Satisfaction, doting, dead drunk, climaxes.</p><p>The reason for such slovenly tastes is because of this good-for-nothing business where karma comes back to bite you.</p><p>But well, it\u2019s not such an unusual thing.</p><p>Coveting B-rated material of bad taste is the taste of otakus.</p><p>Of course, I\u2019m talking about Higashide Yuuichirou. And I\u2019m also reminiscing about the past.</p><p>The time was truly right at the end of the century. Though I say that, society wasn\u2019t in the midst of decay, freedom and violence and it wasn\u2019t such a crazy time, but in any case, we met at the dawn of the stagnant internet.</p><p>The trigger for our encounter with it was a certain game maker. In other words, the company that made the works with \u201CDid the radios waves reach?\u201D, \u201CI will kill you\u201D, \u201CHawawa~\u201D (*Not referring to Koumei from Koihime Musou) and, though the work for this still hadn\u2019t been published back then, \u201CI slept with Touya-kun\u201D. Well, in short, the game company Leaf. It was a series of short stories derived from their works. We had each written a piece at the time that we met.</p><p>The reason to why I\u2019ve stuck with him this long is probably because our interests match\u2014it wouldn\u2019t be wrong to say that, but I feel that\u2019s not accurate either. For instance, I had no interest in B-rated movies (especially horror). The reason I was tainted is 100% Higashide Yuuichirou\u2019s fault. He\u2019s just like a priest of joy and pleasure.</p><p>By the way, at the end of last year as well, he brought me to see the movie [Cabin] without any prior explanation at all (moreover, it was the English-version), so there\u2019s absolutely no difference in what he does now fifteen years after we first met. What is he doing on Christmas?</p><p>Well, getting back to the main subject. As for why I\u2019ve stuck with him this long, well, at the very least, I personally think that it\u2019s because Higashide Yuuichirou is an extremely interesting man. And the greatest proof of this is the existence of this book.</p><p>And so everyone, it\u2019s what you\u2019ve all been waiting for! Scattering both sparks and the flowers of life through the air! Crossing weapons, tragedy and comedy! The second volume of the Great Holy Grail War! Delivered more brilliantly and grandly than ever!</p><p>\u2026Or rather, it\u2019s more like, you know. The author himself said it in the first volume\u2019s afterword, but the book really conveys the feeling that he enjoyed writing it.</p><p>\u2014Yeah, he hasn\u2019t changed at all. Just like back then, he writes what he truly likes truly as he likes to. That is Higashide Yuuichirou\u2019s [Origin].</p><p>This work is like a love letter to the story. As long as he doesn\u2019t lose sight of his [Origin] of [Like], he will never be betrayed by the story. Both the feelings of the author and the feelings of the readers will one day reach the Cup of Heaven.</p><p>Like how his feelings from back then have bloomed and born fruit now like this.</p><p>\u2014Just before the end of the century. The month of December in the year 2000.</p><p>A certain doujin game sent waves of agitation through the world.</p><p>[Tsukihime].</p><p>It was produced by an amateur group known as Type Moon.</p><p>I was wrapped up within that frenzy, and naturally, so was Higashide Yuuichirou.</p><p>It was something he [liked]. That\u2019s why he definitely wanted to write up his love for this story in some form.</p><p>Of course, there was no way of knowing back then that Higashide Yuuichirou\u2019s [Fate/Apocrypha] would be born.</p><p>But well, it was definitely at that moment. The decisive turning point of his life.</p><p>In other words.</p><p>\u2014That day, the good-for-nothing Higashide Yuuichirou encountered fate.</p>', 4016);
