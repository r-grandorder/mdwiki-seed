But I don&#39;t have the power to beat Kuzuki, and he&#39;s not our only enemy.</p><hr><p>Behind Kuzuki are Caster and the betrayer, Archer.</p><p>...No, in the worst case, Saber might also become our enemy.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>Was there no exit to begin with?</p><p>There is no miracle that will let us escape from here.</p><p>I want Tohsaka to escape at the very least, but even that would require so much luck that it makes me sick\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>&quot;That&#39;s it. I was surprised by your intrusion, but the result does not change.</p><p>...Yes, it looks like you have given up. You came out, so you don&#39;t mind dying, right?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;I shall end it here. It would be troublesome to keep you alive, so\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015!&quot;</p><p>...She&#39;s coming...!</p><p>I&#39;ll resist with all my powers.

I thought you would know that you have no right to say anything here.&quot;</p><p>&quot;No, there is something I forgot to tell you. I want to give one condition for me to side with you.&quot;</p><p>&quot;...A condition?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Yes. I gave you my freedom without resistance.</p><p>As compensation, I would like for you to let them go.</p><p>They are useless as Masters now. There is no merit to killing them.&quot;</p><p>His proposal sounds objective.</p><p>Tohsaka watches it intently.</p><hr><p>&quot;Let them go? ...Heh, you are more good-natured than you act.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I was born as a human. It will leave a bad aftertaste if I kill my master right after I betray her.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh. You are a traitor, but you say such a thing in front of the one you betrayed?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...Fine. I shall let them go this time. But I will kill them if they get in my way again, no matter who stops me.</p><p>Is that fine, Archer?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Of course. If they are stupid enough to continue fighting in this situation, they deserve to die.&quot;</p><hr><p>...That must have concluded the negotiation.</p><p>The intent to kill filling the temple goes away, and the restraining enmity fades.</p><hr><p>&quot;So that&#39;s it, you two. I will let you go this time.</p><p>Now, run like the dogs you are.&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015!&quot;</p><p>I glare at Caster.</p><p>...But.</p><p>Tohsaka pulls on my arm silently.</p><hr><p>&quot;Let&#39;s go.

It&#39;s irritating, but I agree with Archer. There&#39;s nothing for you to regret.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Why? Caster is doing whatever she wants, and even Archer lost faith in me. This is because my policy was a mistake, right?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;It&#39;s just that you were unsuccessful. You haven&#39;t made a mistake.

I&#39;m deceiving myself with all the patchwork, but you go and completely destroy it with a straight face.</p><p>You&#39;re breaking even. You only get depressed once in a while, but what comes after is scary in your case. I think you will go to the one that got you depressed and get them to be even more depressed.&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Ugh. What is that, are you trying to finish me off?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yeah, I thought I&#39;d strike while your guard was down.</p><p>Well, isn&#39;t that true? I&#39;m sure you don&#39;t intend to give up now.&quot;</p><hr><p>I look up at the night sky and say so as if talking to myself.</p><p>Tohsaka doesn&#39;t answer.</p><p>But I think that...</p><p>She smiled, getting herself together.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>And silence follows.</p><p>Tohsaka must have said everything she wanted to, as she stops talking.</p><hr><p>I aimlessly look up at the night sky.</p><p>...We should be going home... But neither one of us can stand up to break the moment, so we just keep our backs to each other.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015Oh yeah. Why did you come help me, Shirou?&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>I can&#39;t explain.</p><p>There are many reasons.</p><p>I think it&#39;d be stupid to explain each one.</p><p>So I say something I have to tell her.</p><hr><p>&quot;You remember this pendant, right?&quot;</p><p>I show her the pendant.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>I hear her gasp behind me.</p><p>...I thought so. I bet she intended to keep this a secret, but she made a mistake again.</p><hr><p>&quot;Hey... where did you get that?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I found it in your room. Oh... You might get surprised when you get home, but I&#39;m sorry. I tipped over your dresser.&quot;</p><p>I return her the pendant behind my back.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Heh. So what about it?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Well, I have the exact same pendant at my house.</p><p>I picked it up when I found it after being killed by Lancer.&quot;</p><hr><p>I casually hint about that night.</p><p>Then\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015There&#39;s an identical one...?&quot;</p><p>Tohsaka gasps as if she&#39;s heard something she shouldn&#39;t have.</p><hr><p>&quot;Huh? Did I say something strange?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Uh... no, it&#39;s nothing. But why would that be a reason to come help me? That pendant means nothing, right?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Right. ...It&#39;s just a reason I made up afterwards.</p><p>To confess, I&#39;ve been admiring Tohsaka Rin for a long time.</p><p>And this is a problem, but I got to like you even more after I talked to you. So I didn&#39;t want you to die, and I jumped down even before I realized it.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;!! \u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015H-Hey now. Don&#39;t say it so directly! You&#39;ll create misunderstandings if you talk without thinking!&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;I won&#39;t create misunderstandings. I really do like you.&quot;</p><p>I obstinately reply at once.</p><p>It&#39;s not a lie, so there&#39;s no misunderstanding to be made.</p><hr><p>&quot;Y-You idiot...! That&#39;s why you jumped in suicidally, you big idiot!&quot;</p><hr><p>Tohsaka keeps calling me an idiot.</p><p>She&#39;s criticizing mercilessly, but I strangely don&#39;t feel bad.</p><p>The night sky is beautiful, and I feel calm.</p><p>And I&#39;m just really happy that Tohsaka&#39;s back to normal.</p><hr><p>&quot;All right. Let&#39;s go home like you said.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Here, give me your hand. It should be hard for you to stand up with that wound of yours.&quot;</p><p>I grab her hand with my right.</p><p>Tohsaka pulls me up.</p><hr><p>&quot;Then we don&#39;t owe each other anything now. Let&#39;s not count today&#39;s incident.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>That would really help me out.</p><p>I don&#39;t know what the pendant meant to Tohsaka.</p><p>I bet I would have felt more guilty towards Tohsaka if I found out.</p><p>Tohsaka didn&#39;t want that and said the incidents offset one another.</p><p>So Tohsaka shouldn&#39;t feel bad about getting helped earlier.</p><hr><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015And we leave the foreigners&#39; cemetery.</p><p>And on the way...[r]</p><p>&quot;...Thanks for helping me, Shirou.

But I have not given such an order.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I acted arbitrarily, Master.</p><p>After that, I attacked the church to obtain the &#39;vessel&#39; of the Holy Grail.

You must not have returned because you could not find the Holy Grail. ...Hm. But it is a place you obtained after much trouble. It would be meaningless to abandon it without finding what you are after.&quot;</p><hr><p>Kuzuki&#39;s words are not criticizing her.</p><p>But Caster can only be ashamed of herself.</p><p>She killed the priest who knew where the Holy Grail was, but she still does not have the Holy Grail.</p><p>Furthermore, she has revealed her own action which should have been hidden from him. What else can she call it but a total failure?</p><hr><p>&quot;I understand the situation. Can you explain why you did this, Caster?&quot;</p><p>&quot;...I am sorry. But this is all for you, Master. My goal is to lead you to victory. I have no other reason.&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>A long silence.</p><p>After hearing Caster&#39;s declaration, Kuzuki Souichirou murmurs, &quot;I see&quot;.</p><hr><p>&quot;Then I cannot move away from here. Your troubles will be for nothing if other Masters find the Holy Grail while we are absent.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Then, Master...&quot;</p><p>&quot;You can search this place until you are satisfied. I shall remain here until you are done. You alone are not fit for fighting. You will need a guard until Saber is under your control.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Huh\u2015\u2015\u2015? N-No, there is no need for that. I do not need your help, and I do not know how long the search will take.</p><p>And this place is dangerous. You will be safer if you return to the Ryuudou Temple.&quot;</p><p>&quot;That is true. But if I do that, I cannot fulfill my objective.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;?&quot;</p><p>Those words are unexpected even for Caster.</p><p>What kind of an objective does this man have, who has no interest even in the Holy Grail which can grant any wish?</p><hr><p>&quot;Souichirou-sama, then...&quot;</p><p>&quot;Hurry. I do not care if it is not here. Just make sure you come up with a clear result.&quot;</p><p>With that, Kuzuki goes back up the stairs.</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>Caster watches him go in blank amazement.</p><p>The dark room is still silent.</p><p>The footsteps going up the stairs still cannot be heard.</p><hr><h2 id="scene-15" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#scene-15" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Scene 15</h2><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>I open my eyes.</p><p>My eyes are not the only things that wake up, as my sleeping mind wakes up as well.</p><hr><p>&quot;The wound is\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015not a problem.&quot;</p><p>I check the wound on my left shoulder.</p><p>It still hurts, but there&#39;s no intense pain like last night.</p><p>The heat in my body has gone away somewhat.</p><p>It shouldn&#39;t be a problem for me to move around.</p><hr><p>I eat breakfast and satisfy my hunger.</p><p>Food comes before anything else.
