A member of Raikou\u2019s Shitennou.<br> He is the exact same person as the Kintoki who is summoned as a Berserker.<br> It has often been confirmed that in cases where a Heroic Sprit is summoned into another Class there would occur a change not limited to their abilities, but also to their disposition, personality, Saint Graph, and so on. However\u2026for Kintoki\u2019s case, the extent of his close resemblance to his Berseker counterpart has resulted to a joke going around perpetuated among Chaldea staff: \u201CHe probably just changed his hairstyle and outfit.\u201D</p><p>In reality, this has become a summoning in which his disposition as Raijin\u2019s child is emphasized.<br> At the same time, because the aspect of him being the child of Yamauba is also emphasized, there is a possibility that he may become an even more \u201Cdangerous man\u201D than his Berserker counterpart.<br> One could also see him as the Kintoki who is riding in excitement from riding his monster machine.<br> Yes, he is much groovier than the usual Kintoki.<br> In a way, his current condition can be likened as to having received the best toy; the condition of peak happiness.<br> As a result of having obtained knowledge of the modern world from here and there, he seems to have mixed up multiple meanings of \u201CRider\u201D, and built a contemporary \u201CRider Belt\u201D of his original design.</p><h2 id="standard-weapons" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#standard-weapons" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Standard Weapons</h2><p>Coming from his apparent misunderstanding of something, he now fights with his bare hand according to the honest and straightforward Rider Action*.<br> They are strong attacks weaved with lightning.</p><p>*the opening and ending of the first Kamen Rider</p><h2 id="golden-huge-bear-mk-i" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#golden-huge-bear-mk-i" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Golden Huge Bear Mk.
