Towards his/her missions, d\u2019\xC9on is earnest to the point of being very stern, and he/she will occasionally not hesitate where even if it will cause a scene, he/she will feel obliged to choose a ruthless conduct to act upon. On the other hand, he/she has a gentle nature at times of peace. The likes of an expression that shows him/her being hard at work in domestic chores while he/she is looking forward to afternoon teatime can probably be seen too.</p><p>The loyalty d\u2019\xC9on devoted to the French Royal Family is truly everlasting, and even if he/she materializes as a Servant, that will never change. As a Heroic Spirit related to the Royal Family, he/she will surely display the state of his/her loyalty that had remained changeless since when he/she was alive. For example, even if the White Lily of the Royal Family has been lost, as long as France exists in the world, d\u2019\xC9on will take his/her sword into his/her hand without any doubt. All for the sake of guarding France and the world.</p><h2 id="attitude-towards-master" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#attitude-towards-master" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Attitude Towards Master</h2><p>In the case that he/she is summoned in a normal Holy Grail War, depending on the position of his/her Master, a situation where d\u2019\xC9on revolts against them could happen should his/her Master be \u201Csomeone who opposes France\u201D. On the contrary, it seems d\u2019\xC9on will offer his/her clear allegiance to a subject who is closely connected to France or the French Royal Family.</p><p>Whether he/she is a Heroic Spirit or a human being, and whether his/her body is a man\u2019s or a woman\u2019s, there is only one path for d\u2019\xC9on to take. To continue to be the Knight of the White Lily.

A figure of the 18th~19th Century. A legendary figure who was either talked about as a man who was a woman, or a woman who was a man. A swordsman and writer accomplished in both the military and literary arts. D\u2019\xC9on left behind as many meritorious services as possible in his/her career, such as playing an active role as a spy of the secret channels that conducted themselves against many of the world\u2019s major powers, a French plenipotentiary minister, a commanding officer of a dragoon regiment, and so forth.</p><p>It is said that, despite having dressed formally and behaved like a man, d\u2019\xC9on was endowed with such good looks to the extent that he/she can be called an innocent pretty girl. In fact, before becoming an adult, he/she agreed to wear a dress, gathering rumours among high society that d\u2019\xC9on is a \u201Cbeautiful girl\u201D, and later on as an adult, when he/she infiltrated the Russian Empire for an objective regarding his/her secret mission, d\u2019\xC9on even interacted with the Russian Empress as Mademoiselle Lia de Beaumont, leaving behind an anecdote where his/her beauty was praised by the Empress and her servants.</p><p>In later years, a secret was publicly revealed\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014d\u2019\xC9on was not a man, but a woman. Consistently thereafter, he/she spent the days as a woman, and it is said that d\u2019\xC9on was given a dress for \u201Ca female knight more suited as a folding fan than a sword\u201D by Marie Antoinette, who was the French Queen at that time.</p><p>Born as a female, brought up as a girl, grew up to be a man, and serving the Royal Family\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014D\u2019\xC9on speaks of his/her own life as such. There is also an anecdote where d\u2019\xC9on was definitely raised up as a girl in his/her early childhood and was then raised up as a man thereafter his/her childhood. The truth is, was he a woman, or was he a man? His/her way of life, in which even the opinion of the doctor who performed the examination of his/her body after his/her death was divided into two, is full of beautiful and mysterious glamour, similarly like the impressions he/she kept on giving off to the many men and women around him/her. Therefore, Charles Genevi\xE8ve d\u2019\xC9on, as a Heroic Spirit in \u201CFate/Grand Order\u201D, has got the figure of \u201Ca beautiful woman disguising herself as a man\u201D as the form that symbolizes his/her own life.</p><h2 id="standard-weapons" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#standard-weapons" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Standard Weapons</h2><p>A sabre. A one-handed sword.

Marie is also his/her acquaintance from when they were both alive as well as naturally his/her master. D\u2019\xC9on loves her. He/she wants to have tea together with Marie. Though sometimes, her smile is awfully scary.</p><p><strong>Amadeus</strong></p><p>A person closely connected with d\u2019\xC9on\u2019s master, Marie Antoinette. Although he/she knows in his/her head that Amadeus is a musical prodigy he/she should respect and love, d\u2019\xC9on is fairly poor at doing that. \u201CWhat a perverted devil\u2026 Why do you continue to treat me as a friend\u2026? If you were at least a French citizen\u2026\u201D</p><p><strong>Sanson</strong></p><p>Although Sanson is a French citizen and a person of a family lineage that continued to pledge their allegiance to the Royal Family for generations, he is also the companion who dyed the demise of the White Lily in blood. A subject who d\u2019\xC9on harbours love and hate for and one who he/she finds hard to cut off from. Someone difficult to deal with. However, if it is the case that Marie forgives Sanson, then it is not something d\u2019\xC9on can raise an objection to\u2026</p><p><strong>Robespierre</strong></p><p>Although Robespierre is a bitter enemy of the Royal Family, d\u2019\xC9on recognizes that\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014he is also a person who was concerned about the future of France. A subject of his/her love and hate similarly like Sanson. D\u2019\xC9on has mixed feelings about Robespierre.</p><h2 id="comment-from-the-illustrator" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#comment-from-the-illustrator" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Comment from the Illustrator</h2><p>Since the first rough draft, I wandered off course, which felt like I was swiftly running the wrong way with all my energy, but after receiving advice from Mr. Takeuchi, I was able to correct my course somehow. At first, it was more blatant that d\u2019\xC9on was a woman, but as I was doing adjustments on him/her, he/she settled down into a considerably more androgynous state. On the contrary, I should have reflected his/her Strength A stat more in his/her outward appearance, huh\u2026 Even when he/she appears in this way, his/her Second Stage that is inlaid with lily motifs is a favourite of mine. (Moriyama Daisuke)</p><h2 id="tl-notes" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#tl-notes" aria-hidden="true">#</a> TL Notes</h2><p>D\u2019\xC9on has a 3rd version of his/her Noble Phantasm. As seen in Agartha, it\u2019s called \u201CFleur-de-Lis: The Profusion of a Hundred Flowers that Flutters Lily Petals\u201D, which is a more potent version of his/her 2nd Noble Phantasm. It\u2019s a hidden Noble Phantasm that, by releasing all the Magical Energy in his/her body, causes lilies to dance for however long d\u2019\xC9on wishes them to in order to fascinate his/her enemies. Compared to his/her 2nd Noble Phantasm\u2019s maximum number of targets being fifty people, this version can target a hundred or even a thousand people, creating just enough dancing lilies to potentially affect everyone in an enemy camp regardless of their number.</p><h2 id="material-images" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#material-images" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Material Images</h2><p><img src="https://github.com/Assets-I/Materials/blob/main/fgo-material-I/i-090.jpg?raw=true" alt=""></p><p><img src="https://github.com/Assets-I/Materials/blob/main/fgo-material-I/i-091.jpg?raw=true" alt=""></p><p><img src="https://github.com/Assets-I/Materials/blob/main/fgo-material-I/i-092.jpg?raw=true" alt=""></p><p><img src="https://github.com/Assets-I/Materials/blob/main/fgo-material-I/i-093.jpg?raw=true" alt=""></p><p><img src="https://github.com/Assets-I/Materials/blob/main/fgo-material-I/i-094.jpg?raw=true" alt=""></p><p><img src="https://github.com/Assets-I/Materials/blob/main/fgo-material-I/i-095.jpg?raw=true" alt=""></p><p><img src="https://github.com/Assets-I/Materials/blob/main/fgo-material-I/i-096.jpg?raw=true" alt=""></p><p><img src="https://github.com/Assets-I/Materials/blob/main/fgo-material-I/i-097.jpg?raw=true" alt=""></p><p><img src="https://github.com/Assets-I/Materials/blob/main/fgo-material-I/i-098.jpg?raw=true" alt=""></p><p><img src="https://github.com/Assets-I/Materials/blob/main/fgo-material-I/i-099.jpg?raw=true" alt=""></p><h2 id="dialogue" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#dialogue" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Dialogue</h2><table><thead><tr><th style="text-align:left;">Occassion</th><th style="text-align:center;">English</th><th style="text-align:center;">Japanese</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style="text-align:left;">Summoned</td><td style="text-align:center;"></td><td style="text-align:center;"></td></tr></tbody></table>', 78);
