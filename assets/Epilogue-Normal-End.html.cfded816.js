Senpai&#39;s only hiding.&quot;</p><p>No way.</p><p>It&#39;s impossible for nobody to be here.</p><p>Because that was just a bad dream-</p><hr><p>But the last time I saw him...</p><p>...His body was breaking apart.</p><hr><p>&quot;No\u2015\u2015\u2015it&#39;s just a lie, right, Senpai?&quot;</p><p>Yes, it has to be a lie.</p><p>A body that wasn&#39;t human.</p><p>There&#39;s no way he can move with that body, so he should be waiting for me somewhere around here\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>&quot;Senpai\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Senpai\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>But.</p><p>The date I saw in the living room was\u2015\u2015\u2015ten days since that event, the end of February.</p><hr><p>&quot;Ah\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015no......&quot;</p><p>I fall to my knees.</p><p>I understand everything now.</p><p>No, I knew it the moment I woke up, but I pretended not to notice.</p><hr><p>&quot;No\u2015\u2015\u2015please, please come out, Senpai...!</p><p>I-I can&#39;t be alone! I need to be with you, Senpai! Senpai, Senpai, Senpai...!!!&quot;</p><hr><p>My mind whites out.</p><p>It&#39;s painful not to be able to go crazy. All I can do is cry.</p><p>That&#39;s all.</p><p>I&#39;m a coward and a crybaby, and I don&#39;t know how else to make up for it, so I can&#39;t even appreciate the fact that I&#39;m alive.</p><hr><p>That&#39;s the end of the long winter.</p><p>I&#39;m freed from the chains that bound me for eleven years, but I lost my only guide.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Man, you&#39;re really obstinate. To be honest, I was taking you lightly.&quot;</p><p>The boy bluntly said this.</p><p>An amazed expression and a deep sigh.</p><p>...She was prepared for that.</p><p>The girl associated herself with the boy knowing that she was going to be hated.</p><hr><p>But somewhere in her mind...</p><p>...Was a thought that she didn&#39;t want to be hated by the boy, and at the same time...</p><p>&quot;Oh, but we have to redo this before that. I&#39;m the one going to be causing you trouble, so I should be the one asking you.</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015Please give me your best regards, Sakura. I&#39;ll have you take care of me until my wound heals.&quot;</p><p>...As she watched him cough to hide his embarrassment, she wanted to value that thought.</p><hr><p>It&#39;s spring.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Phew. We can finally settle down for the time being, Sakura.</p><p>The Association&#39;s inquiry is finished, Kirei&#39;s successor is a good person, and nobody blames us for any of it.</p><p>I guess this is a happy end.&quot;</p><hr><p>Nee-san&#39;s strong.</p><p>She was more sad than I was, but she got her energy back as spring arrived.</p><hr><p>&quot;By the way. Do you want to come to my house, Sakura? If you&#39;re going to give up the Matou mansion, it&#39;s going to be better if you come to my house, right?&quot;</p><hr><p>I appreciate her concern.</p><p>I&#39;ve always dreamed of being able to live with Nee-san in her house.</p><p>I can&#39;t bear spending the night by myself, and I don&#39;t know what&#39;ll happen to me after Nee-san goes home today.</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015But.</p><p>That&#39;s why it&#39;s even more important to grow up.</p><hr><p>&quot;...I see. So you&#39;re going to manage things by yourself? I won&#39;t force you, then. I&#39;ll be at my place until I graduate, so at least come over when there&#39;s no school.&quot;</p><hr><p>Before heading home, Nee-san tells me she&#39;ll be waiting for my visit.</p><p>...It must&#39;ve been caught in her hair when she came here.</p><p>A pink flower petal flutters through the air.</p><hr><p>&quot;Hm? Oh, is this your first time cooking, Sakura?&quot;</p><p>It wasn&#39;t true, but I wasn&#39;t skilled enough to say I was good at it.</p><p>I read a lot of books before I came here, and I&#39;d had my share of cooking classes.</p><p>But I was really, really scared of having someone eat something I&#39;d made.</p><hr><p>&quot;That&#39;s not true. I can make easy dishes.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Well, that&#39;s not what I mean... Hmm, I guess you&#39;ll get used to it.</p><p>All right, let&#39;s start with the basics. It&#39;s hot, so watch out.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;The basics&quot; turned out to be riceballs.</p><p>We made them together.</p><p>I thought he was making fun of me.</p><p>I sulked a bit.</p><p>But when I looked up, I saw he was serious, and I couldn&#39;t get mad at him.</p><p>And\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>&quot;Then we&#39;ll trade. I&#39;ll give you mine, so I&#39;ll have the ones you made.&quot;</p><p>He ate the riceballs I&#39;d just made.</p><p>He ate something I made and thanked me for the meal.</p><hr><p>I don&#39;t know what he wanted to teach me.</p><p>But I felt less awkward starting the next day, and I wanted him to eat my meals again.</p><hr><p>It&#39;s spring.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Really, Sakura-chan? It&#39;ll help me out if you&#39;re the manager, but...&quot;</p><hr><p>I got much more money than I expected when I sold the mansion.</p><p>It&#39;s more than enough to maintain this house.</p><p>I went and asked Fujimura-Sensei&#39;s father to give me the right to the land, making sure I can keep this house.</p><hr><p>&quot;...I&#39;m glad to know how much you like him, but...</p><p>Sakura-chan. Shirou&#39;s not going to come ba\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><hr><p>I just shake my head.</p><p>Fujimura-Sensei shrugs,</p><p>&quot;All right. I&#39;ll leave this house to you.&quot;</p><p>...and leaves the house with a motherly smile.</p><hr><p>I recall a painful memory.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Sakura. Let&#39;s go somewhere far away once this is all over.</p><p>We&#39;ve never gone anywhere for fun, right? It&#39;s good to go off and enjoy ourselves once in a while.&quot;</p><hr><p>In dead seriousness, he said there&#39;s nowhere we can&#39;t go if we put our minds to it.</p><p>I smiled, since he was so pure.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015All right. Then it&#39;s a promise. Let&#39;s go there together once you get well and once this whole mess is over.&quot;</p><hr><p>Yes\u2015\u2015\u2015the promise is...</p><hr><p>It&#39;s spring.</p><p>I think I haven&#39;t seen someone for a while now.</p><hr><p>It&#39;s painful to be alone.</p><p>My memories keep looping in my head, and I want to turn the power off.</p><p>It&#39;s fortunate that I don&#39;t miss people, but then, why...</p><hr><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015Of course. You took lives, so take responsibility, Sakura\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>...Yes, I have to do something.</p><p>It&#39;s painful to be by myself or to be with others, but I have to do something I can.</p><hr><p>But I don&#39;t know how I can atone.</p><p>I can&#39;t think of anything I can do for others.</p><p>So this will be for myself.</p><p>I&#39;ll grow one flower every year for the promised day.</p><hr><p>It&#39;s spring.</p><hr><p>I&#39;m getting used to being alone, and it&#39;s getting fun to be with others.</p><p>But it&#39;s still scary.</p><p>Talking to someone makes it feel like the whole world is condemning me as punishment.</p><hr><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015But I&#39;ll protect you. I&#39;ll protect you from everything. It may be hypocrisy, but my ideal has always been to protect the one I love\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>He&#39;s really selfish.</p><p>I think it&#39;s the worst when he says whatever he wants and doesn&#39;t actually protect me.</p><p>So I&#39;m not going to forgive him.</p><p>I&#39;m going tell him a lot of selfish things to bother him.</p><hr><p>Hm\u2015\u2015\u2015but I&#39;ll forgive him.</p><p>He says it&#39;s hypocrisy, but his words alone calm me down so much.</p><p>He&#39;s irresponsible, but I love him, and he loves me.</p><hr><p>It&#39;s spring.</p><hr><p>It&#39;s spring.</p><hr><p>It&#39;s spring.</p><hr><p>It&#39;s spring.</p><hr><p>No one comes here.</p><hr><p>I&#39;m not sad.</p><p>But I&#39;m waiting so calmly for the spring that I sometimes doubt my sanity.</p><hr><p>I&#39;m not sad because I have certainty.</p><p>I believe I&#39;ll be compensated for all my pains.</p><p>But there&#39;s one worry.</p><hr><p>&quot;...You&#39;re late, Senpai. I&#39;m going to get old at this rate.&quot;</p><hr><p>I hope I can be healthy until that day.</p><hr><p>It&#39;s spring.</p><p>I haven&#39;t been able to move my body to my satisfaction recently.</p><p>I go out into the yard and sprinkle water like always.</p><hr><p>&quot;Sensei\u2015\u2015\u2015! I&#39;m here to help!&quot;</p><p>My student comes.</p><p>A student came and asked for instructions, even though I taught myself and don&#39;t have much skill.</p><p>The Tohsaka&#39;s new heir is a good girl, just like Nee-san.</p><hr><p>The lights are scattered.</p><p>I sit in my usual rocking chair and stare at the yard.</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh. Please don&#39;t sleep, Sensei. I want to hear about the old days after I&#39;m done.&quot;</p><hr><p>That&#39;s something that&#39;s fun for me too.</p><p>I can only recall words now, but words become stories, repeating the good old days.</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh, you smiled. I like your smile. You&#39;re really beautiful, not like my greedy grandma.&quot;</p><hr><p>The sun&#39;s warm, and time passes by gently and sometimes like torture.</p><p>I keep planting seeds for the promised day.</p><p>Flowers of redemption.</p><p>I&#39;ll wait for spring here until I&#39;m absolved.</p><hr><p>And it&#39;s spring again.</p><hr><p>The years are as long as a blink of an eye.</p><p>I close my eyes and open them.</p><p>The hill is covered with cherry blossoms.</p><p>The boy, appearing just like he was before, is waving his hand on the familiar hill road\u2015\u2015\u2015</p>', 267);
