However, by means of the existence of his Noble Phantasm he gained an ability equal to it. The created (taken out from his Noble Phantasm) tools are all &quot;treasures from within the vault of Babylon.&quot;<br> By using this Skill, he is able to make use of various magic tools and miracle drugs.</p><p><strong>Territory Creation: [A]</strong></p><p>Not only can he produce tools as a magus, he is even able to manufacture constructions. To begin with, the stronghold of Uruk was by Gilgamesh&#39;s design. Due to the limit of stone and clay constructions, &quot;I need more lumbers. I suppose it would not do to not visit the cedar forest....&quot;<br> he muttered.<br> The king wished not to go to the cedar forest, where one matter regarding Enkidu left its traces there.</p><p><strong>Divinity: [B] ([A+])</strong></p><p>Originally he possesses the highest Divinity rank of A+, but due to him not harboring any good impression in regards of the gods, the rank declines.</p><h2 id="personal-skills" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#personal-skills" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Personal Skills</h2><p><strong>Golden Rule: [A]</strong></p><p>The wise king who had returned from his journey for immortality, growing as a king.<br> Increases star generation value to all allies.</p><p>(TL note: description obviously should have been for King&#39;s Return. I guess this skills represents the state of mind and revelation and what not as a sage king, like the whole episode told in CCC turned as a skill.)</p><p><strong>Charisma: [A+]</strong></p><p>The charisma of Gilgamesh, most excelling of kings, as that of a wise king. He possesses an exceedingly powerful charismatic nature, already akin to that of a charm or a curse.</p><p><strong>Ruler of Magic Wands: [EX]</strong></p><p>A skill that denotes Gilgamesh&#39;s way of being as a Caster who manipulates a diverse amount of magic mystic code. Grants bonus to attacks of magical type.<br> He takes tender care of his tools should he fight while being mindful to them.

In the magic wands and mystic codes, the great thaumathurgy of the age of the gods is loaded. Due to the display of effects and invocation that mostly does not consume the user&#39;s magic energy, it is a Noble Phantasm that excels in its extraordinary cost performance.<br> Utilized in normal attacks, its True Name release is not utilized in FateGO.</p><h1 id="melam-dingir-king-s-signal-gun" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#melam-dingir-king-s-signal-gun" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Melam Dingir - King&#39;s Signal Gun</h1><ul><li>Rank: B</li><li>Type: Anti-Army/Anti-Fortress Noble Phantasm</li><li>Range: 99</li><li>Maximum target: 700 person</li></ul><p>Melam Dingir.<br> Long distance raid bombing from the stronghold of Uruk. An amazing bombardment that concentrates the total force of not only the wise king Gilgamesh, but also the people of Uruk who lived in the age of the gods. In FateGO, it possesses the effect of raising allies defensive power after attacking all the opponents.</p><p>Gilgamesh with great sorrow loads the catapults with his personal collection, then leaves it at the hands of the soldiers.<br> &quot;Broken Phantasm? I did that already more than 4000 years ago!&quot;</p><p>(TL note: Melam Dingir&#39;s name presumably comes from melam (melammu in akkadian), a concept of ancient Mesopotamian divinity, which is a &quot;mantle of radiance&quot; type of blazing light that is worn like a garment depicted like a light aura that surrounds a deity or demon, and dingir which is simply Sumerian words for god, used to denote religious names and related concepts. So literally Godly Divine Radiance? I dunno how SUmer grammar works. But weird choice of name, considering Gil denounces the gods.<br> So looking back at Babylonia</p><p>Dingir was used as a furigana for \u795E\u6A29\u5370\u7AE0, lit. Seal of Divine Right (not lock seal, more like stamp sort of seal) when describing the canon itself<br> which is also the name of that clay tablet thing CasGil have<br> its also count as one of the King&#39;s Treasure too. THe canons, i mean.</p><p>Merlin also said further that &quot;Dingir&quot; denotes deification.<br> Deification is by merit. A god did not become a god by being approved by a god, but by man. Faith of humanity makes of the gods.</p><p>Gil called his cannons Dingir as a way to say that if deification comes from humanity, than using this Dingir canons to protect Uruk signifies that humanity would be the source of what protects humanity itself.<br> Also this is another of Gil&#39;s selfnamed NP.</p><p>Also we still don&#39;t know whether this is an RM like NPs that summons even the citizens of Uruk for sure, damn this ambiguity.

He is also quite different from the author type of Casters that writes of words that composes into poems or novels and fold into a book their very own worlds-----<br> That figure of his, is so to speak a magus (Caster) in shape only.</p><p>There was an opinion left in the Chaldea leftover unofficial records:<br> &quot;I think that&#39;s probably just his own insinuation.
