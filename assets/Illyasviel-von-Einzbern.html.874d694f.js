Because there&#39;re already stages of form change that fits the game system, curiously I didn&#39;t need to puzzled over it too much and just put the orthodox finishing touches. Because the normal form is the design from back then, I feel like some parts are really shoddy. But still, now that I have drawn for many years, I no longer fumble with the balance. The big mantle is a respect of sort to the first generation Kaleidoruby. By the way, Illya already has, like, 8 different battle costume already, so...wouldn&#39;t there be a Costume Dress unlock in the future? Please?
