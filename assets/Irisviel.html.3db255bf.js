Due to some circumstances, she is a person who experienced the Holy Grail War in the past, and from that standpoint, she had assumed that some sense of distance should be kept between Master and Servant; it is possible to say that she has a tendency to maintain that distance appropriately.</p><h2 id="dialogue-examples" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#dialogue-examples" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Dialogue Examples</h2><p>\u201CI\u2019m Irisviel.

Someone who is the same as the terminal of the Holy Grail.</p><p>That is to say, by what kind of cause did this miracle happen? A terminal of the Holy Grail. An infant who returned to the Greater Holy Grail\u2026 had transformed into a Servant as its Divided Spirit. Here, Irisviel continues to protect a certain Guardian cursed by fate, being close to this person, yet far away from that same person, no matter where they are.</p><p>Unlike the nature that signifies the contaminated Holy Grail\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u201CAll the World\u2019s Evils\u201D \u2013 that is hidden within Fuyuki\u2019s Holy Grail, Irisviel is strongly being endowed with the profile of the mother \u201CIrisviel von Einzbern\u201D as a wife. She is in no way a proper Divine Spirit, but if one were to apply her as a Divine Spirit for argument\u2019s sake, she is probably an existence that is endowed with a disposition of an Earth Mother Goddess.</p><p>Why has Irisviel materialized? What will she do as a Holy Grail when she comes into contact with a person who has the qualifications? An answer has yet to appear for either enigma.</p><h2 id="related-characters" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#related-characters" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Related Characters</h2><p><strong>Emiya (Assassin)</strong></p><p>\u201CMy beloved dear.

Given that her design was where I simply put all of my own designs that I had already made for her together, I took more time drawing her than the other characters\u2019 pictures I was responsible for. I believe the people who have Iri also knows this, but because she was used for an event distribution reward as a welfare, her outward appearance in her Ascensions is constant; however, to tell you the truth, she was initially not supposed to be distributed as a welfare, and I had even drawn the pictures of her 3 stages similarly like the regular Servants. In the future, Mr. Takeuchi accompanied me in her specification changes, and I got to draw up a rough design in which I picked the best points in each of her 3 stages, which then resulted in her present appearance. Because she is a distribution character, it appears many people have obtained her, and I am very happy for that.
