The reading of the word suppa [\u6C34\u7834] is the same as the word suppa [\u900F\u6CE2], which is the name for the ninja located in Kai and westward of it, but when speaking of the word suppa [\u900F\u6CE2] in the same time period back then with those characters in mind, it is a word associated with what is called the Koshu Suppa, who were employed by the Takeda House as spies, so rather, judging from the character [\u7834] in its word, it seems a suppa [\u6C34\u7834] was a spy whose existence is closely related to the Soshu Rappa led by Fuuma Kotarou, who was employed by the Later Houjou House. The Soshu Rappa were considered to be a group of 200 ruffians that were led by Fuuma Kotarou. After the downfall of their employer\u2019s house, it is said that the remnants of the Soshu Rappa became bandits and raised havoc in and around Edo, but they were captured due to the secret information provided to the shogunate\u2019s law enforcement force by Kousaka Jinnai \u2013 who was said to be a dependent of the Takeda House\u2019s Chief Vassal Kousaka Masanobu as well as a disciple of Miyamoto Musashi \u2013 and executed.</p><p>Regarding Katou Danzou, she is known by nicknames such as \u201CFlying Katou\u201D and \u201CKite Katou\u201D, and given that there are even books that reference only her name and no one else\u2019s, it seems certain that she actually existed. Regarding those deeds of hers however, they are only mentioned in things like writings with a high degree of fiction and tales, so likewise, she is often an unclear figure because of those as a matter of fact. In those tales, Katou Danzou frequently displays the skills of a Puppeteer. The origin of this seems to be from an illusion technique that was mentioned in section 8.2-3 of the Bussetsu Juuou Kyou Jikidan (Personal Account of the Sutra of the Ten Rulers of the Afterlife) \u2013 titled \u201CFulou-koku Genjutsu-jin (The Illusionists of the Country of Fulou)\u201D \u2013 where it reveals a puppet hanging several cuns[1] from the center of an illusionist\u2019s hand and makes it sing without any trouble.</p><h2 id="character-in-fgo" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#character-in-fgo" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Character in FGO</h2><p>In regard to Katou Danzou, there are legends where she operated puppets and karakuri dolls, but those were legends derived from the fact that \u201CDanzou herself was a karakuri doll\u201D\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014or so how she is set in this work.</p><p>A ninja who follows the school of the Fuuma, a clan that played an active role during the closing years of the Warring States Period. And the true form of hers is that of a karakuri doll that was constructed by the Sorcerer Kashin Koji. Danzou is an artificial female ninja (kunoichi) who was formed under the collaboration of Kashin Koji and the First Fuuma Kotarou, and she is not a human being that has life. Nevertheless, as a result of accomplishing plenty of her duties and being often talked about even in the books of posterity, that existence of hers was carved into human history as a Heroic Spirit.</p><p>\u25C6</p><p>In \u201CThe Seven Duels of the Heroic Spirit Blademasters\u201D, Danzou found herself on the side of a Sorcerer as \u201Cthe Katou Danzou from her lifetime.\u201D It was not the case that she has been embedded with a Karma like the Heroic Spirit Blademasters, but that her incomplete mentality was being manipulated by the Caster Ashiya Douman.</p><p>There is really no difference in regard to the personality and the behavioural principles of both the Danzou who appeared during the Seven Duels \u2013 which is a kind of Pruning Phenomenon \u2013 and the Servant Danzou of Pan-Human History who was summoned at Chaldea. Both are similarly Ninja whom are serious in their loyalty to their lords, and both are similarly mothers whom treat the Fifth Generation Fuuma Kotarou with tender loving care.</p><h2 id="standard-weapons" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#standard-weapons" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Standard Weapons</h2><p>Danzou can carry out attacks with mainly a large number of edged tools and shooting-type wires that are built into her limbs. She is able to use both short-distance attacks and long-distance attacks.

What the heck is this \u201Ccertain incident\u201D that the Katou Danzou from her lifetime actually perpetrated on the Takeda House?</p><p><strong>(The Fifth) Fuuma Kotarou</strong></p><p>When she had been living under the Fuuma clan\u2019s roof for a period of time, Danzou became the foster parent of a certain red-haired infant. The reason is because Danzou, who has the skills of the First Fuuma Kotarou built into her as a database of some sort, was the best \u201Ctransmitter of the Fuuma skills.\u201D</p><p>Sometimes guiding him as his ninjutsu mentor, and sometimes treating him with tender loving care like a mother, this little child was surely none other than\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014the future Fifth Generation Fuuma Kotarou.</p><p>At first, Danzou herself did not recognize Kotarou during their unexpected reunion in Chaldea, but\u2026?</p><h2 id="comment-from-the-illustrator" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#comment-from-the-illustrator" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Comment from the Illustrator</h2><p>I received the responsibility for Katou Danzou\u2019s design. About the theme called \u2018karakuri dolls\u2019, I was tormented in all sorts of ways at the time of receiving it. Regarding the things that are called dolls, their limbs are usually being constructed longer than the normal length, so I tried to make Ms. Danzou\u2019s limbs longer to some extent too, enough for her to give off just a little uncomfortable feeling to others. I came to carry out many trials and errors for this and that and so forth, but thanks to God\u2019s scenario, this very attractive character was finished in the end.
