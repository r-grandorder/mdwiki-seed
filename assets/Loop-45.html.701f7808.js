He woke up early in the morning, helping his father in the forest, carrying back the yield of the day to the village.</p><p>The world of his was simple. The days he spent didn&#39;t change.</p><hr><p>That work had gone on for decades.</p><p>His father and his father&#39;s father probably entered the forest and lived under the grace of the mountain the same way. Just like his father and grandfather, he was also going to live a dull and boring life.</p><p>There was the restlessness of youth, but he knew that would leave him as the years passed.</p><p>A roof to sleep under, enough food not to starve, and the warmth of his neighbors; that was all he could ever ask for.</p><hr><p>But why, why did it have to turn out like that?</p><p>Villagers were at least entitled to this dull life. It hadn&#39;t been a rich village, but it brimmed with the rightness of being able to live normally and die quietly.</p><p>The other villagers weren&#39;t any different from him.</p><p>The other villagers thought he was one of them.</p><hr><p>...He couldn&#39;t let it go.</p><p>Nothing had suddenly gone wrong.</p><p>There was no mistake anywhere.</p><p>The choice that was made had been, undeniably, the will of humanity, including himself.</p><hr><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015That&#39;s why he still couldn&#39;t let it go.</p><p>Had it at least been the will of heaven, he could have cursed god&#39;s cruelty and been done with it.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015Filthy demon\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>It came without any warning.</p><p>As naturally as saying &quot;good morning&quot; to another.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015First, the eyes\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>Leaving the house and going to the woods, like always.</p><p>He said &quot;hello&quot; to a passing neighbor, but was ignored.</p><p>A disaster in the middle of the village.</p><p>Villagers he had never met surrounded him, and he would never return there again.</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015Hey, save the left one for later\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>The ceremony was performed calmly.</p><p>Apparently, he was the spawn of the devil.</p><p>This newly found fact left people in grief and disgust. Finally, their anger rose up, and his fate was decided.</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015Damn noisy he is. Should&#39;ve taken care of the throat\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>There was more doubt than fear within him.</p><p>Why?</p><p>Why do this?</p><p>Why did this happen?</p><p>Why did it have to be me, of all people?</p><p>Come to think of it, there isn&#39;t a trace of a pretext anywhere.</p><p>...Then why?</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015Yeah.

Only the tendons, his body belongs to everyone in this village, you must leave it whole.\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><p>Several men took care of the ceremony.</p><p>Cursed by almost everyone he knew, his arms and legs are just barely retaining their shape.</p><p>To punish him for not endowing their lives with abundance, they meted out appropriate punishment to every part of his body.</p><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015Cut his tongue off too. We can&#39;t afford to let him die.\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><p>Scolded by many of those he knew, he was covered in filth.</p><p>&quot;This is what you get for threatening our lives!&quot; they said, while venting their dissatisfaction all over his body.</p><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015Serves you right, you damned demon!\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><p>That was the end of him as a human.</p><p>His emotions decayed from the pain of losing his body.</p><p>His rational mind decayed from the sadness of losing his dignity.</p><hr><p>And so...</p><p>He had been kneeling for who knows how long.</p><p>There wasn&#39;t even a single moan.</p><p>The piece of wood piercing through his throat had started to rot.</p><p>His tongue was ripped out long ago.</p><p>His vocal organs were inflamed after a night of screaming.</p><hr><p>People that knew him, people that didn&#39;t know him, he was abused by everyone alike.</p><p>The administering of justice needs no reason.</p><p>They, with their righteous anger and morals, hated the demon confined atop the mountain without feeling embarrassed to anyone.</p><p>&quot;The likes of you should not live,&quot; they said.</p><p>They continued to laugh, mercilessly keeping him alive.</p><hr><p>Hatred begets more hatred.</p><p>Going beyond terror and suspicion, a hatred was eventually born within him.</p><p>But who must this hatred be directed at?</p><hr><p>Why?</p><p>No matter how many times he thought about it, no matter how many times he put it into words, he could not understand.</p><p>Even as one of his eyes was crushed, and as his fingers were cut off by some scissor-like tool, the words he managed to squeeze out of his throat were, &quot;Why did it have to be me?&quot;</p><p>None of the villagers ever mentioned anything about it.</p><p>Please stop.</p><p>Please send me back.</p><p>Please save me.</p><p>He did not voice out those wishes he had already given up hope on.</p><p>He finally realized it when the last finger he had left, the thumb on his left foot, was cut off by the person who was his father.</p><p>That he had only a single wish left.</p><p>WHY DID IT HAVE TO BE ME? That was his only final request, one that nobody ever answered.</p><hr><p>By the time he reached the answer, he had become a real demon.</p><p>There was no reason as to why he was a demon.</p><p>There was no reason for him to be sacrificed.</p><p>To begin with, the village elders\u2015\u2015\u2015the people in power never even knew him.</p><p>Anyone would have been fine.</p><p>It was not that he was hated because of his sins,</p><p>Neither was he isolated because of his good deeds.</p><p>As a completely dull, ordinary person, he was chosen completely by chance.</p><p>...Just for the sake of a one-day luxury, people he never met ended the life of a human that they never knew.</p><p>That&#39;s all there is to it.</p><p>Merely to fulfill the desires of a single night, his life, fostered well for decades, was trampled upon and crushed.</p><hr><p>This world is governed by things that aren&#39;t people.*</p><hr><p>The moment he realized that, he decided upon the target of his hatred.</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;<ruby>All the Evil of the World.<rt>Angra Mainyu</rt></ruby>&quot;</p><p>The revered effigy thus became a true demon.</p><p>An egg that will never hatch.</p><p>An anti-hero of this small world that would rid it of all sins.</p><hr><p>He had no limbs to struggle in pain.</p><p>His limbs were completely severed.</p><p>Only his heart was still alive.</p><p>No arms, no legs, no dignity left. He had no functions as a human, and only his sense of pain continued to work faithfully.</p><p>He has taken on a countless amount of hatred.</p><p>While bringing forth hatred just as infinite.</p><hr><p>His collapsed personality gained order in its own broken way.</p><p>He was a stone.</p><p>Never going outside the stone prison, his body wasn&#39;t allowed to move at all.</p><p>The eyelid of his remaining left eye was fixed, not allowing it to close.</p><p>His dry, cracked eyeball continued to stare at the outside world.</p><p>He was just like a stone statue. A stone statue that was conscious.</p><p>Without taking a single step, he watched the unchanging scenery for a month, a year, decades.</p><hr><p>He could neither avert nor close his eye.</p><p>Before his soul collapsed to the boredom, the treatment that made him forget the fact that he was still alive, in reality, continued until his death.</p><p>What frightened him, however, was the fact that this torture, difficult to bear for even a single day, would last for his entire lifetime\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><p>Sanity would fall apart in no more than seven days.</p><p>And yet, it was the very destruction of his sanity that made him endure it, that made him preserve his soul.</p><hr><p>Unchanging scenery wouldn&#39;t break him.</p><p>That which spread beneath his eye was his hometown.</p><p>The people that called him a demon as they turned him into a real one; the village that the hatred came from - he could take it all in one sweep.</p><p>Prospering by sacrificing the weak, a repulsive herd of good will.</p><p>He will continue to hate as long as he lives.</p><p>This absurdity.</p><p>The hidden repulsiveness of humankind.</p><p>The overly tolerant world that approved of it.</p><hr><p>All that&#39;s left in this stone prison is burning hatred.</p><p>There is neither a person nor a body in here.</p><p>The soul in his physical body had been annihilated long ago.</p><p>That is already something else.</p><p>Only the hatred born from within him continues to smolder like this\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>Who knows how many years passed like that.</p><p>Having lost his sense of time, to him, the world continued its dizzying transformation even as it stagnated.</p><p>The ties he had from back when he was human were no exception.</p><p>The people that chose him, the people that took away his legs and arms, the people that were his blood relatives, the people that hated him, the people that loved him.</p><p>Their hatred did not last as long as the one held by the human they sacrificed.</p><p>Those who stole everything from him disappeared from this world before he did.</p><hr><p>...Like shooting stars.</p><p>The strong merciless flicker of the ever-coming days burned into his eyeball.</p><p>For a long time.</p><p>He was left in that sunny spot.</p><hr><p>He had seen so many lives.</p><p>The result of too many meaningless lives.</p><p>Consuming time and space, burning up their own lives recklessly, bearing children, amassing riches, yet ending without a trace.</p><p>Hollow it may be, it was not void.</p><p>Although it had ended, it wasn&#39;t as though it could not continue.</p><hr><p>The wheel of time keeps rolling on.</p><p>Lives wither, then bloom again.</p><p>The cycle of prosperity and decay.</p><p>The scenery before him kept on spinning.</p><p>There were times of destruction, overrun by different believers.</p><p>There were times of expansion, taking in fresh blood.</p><p>Throughout it all, he continued to stare with hatred.</p><p>Hatred was all the connection that he had.</p><hr><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015There is evil atop this mountain, breathing malice into all of us.</p><p>That became a teaching passed down in the village since old times.</p><p>As long as there is hatred, as long as he is hated, he will not die.</p><p>The new villagers hated, worshiped, and thanked him as their everyday enemy.</p><p>There wasn&#39;t even a demon adolescent there anymore.</p><hr><p>Hatred that gives birth to nothing.</p><p>The vacuum that existed to help life advance smoothly, day after day.</p><p>A hole that opened up in everyday life, a junk yard that received all the overflowing emotions.</p><p>What a convenient\u2015\u2015\u2015false void that cannot become anything.</p><hr><p>That village also disappeared in a flash.</p><p>Neither decaying, nor prosperous.</p><p>Times changed, people changed, and the mountain village, having fulfilled its role, went back to being an open field.</p><p>Everything he hated disappeared without a trace.</p><p>His name and body lost, he even lost sight of his soul.</p><p>In the end, even hatred left him behind.</p><hr><p>;rep\u76F4\u5F8C\u306Estophaze\u3067time&gt;0\u3092\u6307\u5B9A\u3059\u308B\u3068\u3001\u5B58\u5728\u3057\u306A\u3044\u30EC\u30A4\u30E4\u30FC\u306B\u5BFE\u3059\u308Bhaze\u51E6\u7406\u304C\u884C\u308F\u308C\u3066\u3057\u307E\u3046\u3002\u3053\u308C\u3092\u4FEE\u6B63\u3002</p><p>And yet, he is still connected to this place.</p><p>Many years passed.</p><p>People perished, the village perished, but even after his own body died, he cannot move from here.</p><p>The scorching hatred is unchanging and undying.</p><p>As long as the world of humans continues on, it will exist forever.</p><p>In this empty wasteland.</p><p>Forever gazing at the end of the world\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015Like that.

More than halfway towards death, I kept on screaming until the remains of my life were all used up.</p><hr><p>To that,</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015If you become my Master...&quot;*</p><p>A mysterious and strange something,</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015For as long as the contract holds, I&#39;ll grant you that wish.&quot;*</p><p>Someone heard it in the end.</p><hr><p>Perhaps that was the Holy Grail.</p><p>Inside the Holy Grail smashed by the winner of the fifth Heaven&#39;s Feel was a formless void.</p><p>By all rights, once the Grail had been destroyed, it ought to have returned to the Throne of Heroes.</p><p>But\u2015\u2015\u2015that thing lived inside the Holy Grail.</p><p>No, what was inside the Grail that granted people&#39;s wishes had finally taken the form of a &quot;Heroic Spirit&quot; - just as everyone wished.</p><p>That is the Servant reborn inside the Holy Grail.</p><p>The one called &quot;all the evil in the world,&quot; having become the demon that grants people&#39;s wishes, had answered my call.</p><hr><p>However much of an embodiment of the Holy Grail he may be, he is a Servant. Without a Master, he will disappear.</p><p>An impossible miracle becoming a Heroic Spirit - just like everyone wished him to - in an accident that will never happen again. And yet, he will disappear, having lasted not even one night.</p><p>Our mutual interests happen to coincide in the fact that neither one of us has a future.</p><p>...But then...</p><p>I had already met my end.</p><hr><p>I was delirious.</p><p>I had no time to contemplate that being&#39;s nature.</p><p>It&#39;s just that, after my death...</p><p>My body will rot, decay, and eventually become nothing. I was terrified.</p><p>That&#39;s why\u2015\u2015\u2015only one thought remained burning in my mind as I laid on the verge of death.</p><p>I don&#39;t want to die.</p><p>I want to extend the contract.</p><hr><p>Thus, the old shell - known as the &quot;Holy Grail&quot; - now lost, I made a new one by forming a contract with that thing.</p><p>I lost consciousness the very next moment.</p><p>That is, I died.</p><hr><p>Therefore, it is my own corpse that I see here.</p><p>A pitiful misconception, a forever looping four-day playground inside a walled garden.</p><p>...Had my last wish been &quot;I want to be resurrected,&quot; I doubt he&#39;d grant it even then.</p><p>He said,</p><p>&quot;The dead cannot revive the dead.&quot;</p><p>To give form to the dead is a privilege reserved only for the living.</p><hr><p>...That&#39;s why the most he can do is deceive the soul.</p><p>Separating soul from the body, for as long as the contract is in force, he will be playing this convenient dream, with real life set as its stage.</p><p>This is more than just a mere ornament.</p><p>Building up at the depths of this slumber, a cradle-like void.</p><hr><p>...That&#39;s right.</p><p>This neverending Heaven&#39;s Feel is what Bazett wished for.</p><p>The wish that this Servant can grant, my very own Holy Grail\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>I finally get to the church several minutes behind Bazett.</p><p>I knew this fleet-footed lady ought to seek refuge here.</p><p>For Bazett Fraga McRemitz, this church is the last bit of support she can rely on.</p><p>It is also a place fraught with dangers for an unwise intruder.</p><hr><p>\u201C...Tch. Sounds like someone&#39;s fired up that moldy old organ. I could have done without this particular pain in the ass.\u201D</p><p>Even though, judging by her good mood earlier, I can expect to meet with instant death if I face her right now, I&#39;m not the kind of Servant who would abandon his Master when she&#39;s at her most desperate.</p><p>Preparing myself for the possibility that my head is about to part ways with my body, I fumble in the darkness until my hands find the door.</p><hr><p>Inside the abandoned building, there&#39;s a woman that&#39;s feeling down.</p><p>And at the altar, silver flowers bloom.</p><hr><p>\u201CYo. Looking at&#39;cha, seems like you&#39;ve remembered it all now.\u201D</p><p>The woman doesn&#39;t answer.</p><p>Looks like she calmed down, but guess she&#39;s still mad at me.</p><hr><p>\u201CMy, my. Still in a stormy mood, are we?</p><p>Can&#39;t be helped, here&#39;s a special bonus. Actually, it isn&#39;t something I&#39;d normally tell unless you asked, but here, I&#39;ll let ya know how this world really works.\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015There is no need.</p><p>There are only two things you need to answer.\u201D</p><hr><p>She cuts me short.</p><p>There was no emotion in the words she shot at me.</p><p>The woman became a machine.</p><p>In that case, there&#39;s no need for me to stay human, either.</p><hr><p>\u201CWill the Heaven&#39;s Feel continue for as long as I wish?\u201D</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015<em>Yes</em>.</p><p>\u201CWill I not die for as long as the Heaven&#39;s Feel continues?\u201D</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015<em>Yes</em>.</p><hr><p>&quot;That&#39;s fine, then.&quot;</p><p>She passes me as she heads out of the church.</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015I can&#39;t believe it.</p><p>Right now, I&#39;m really shocked.</p><hr><p>\u201C...Hold on. What do you mean, &quot;fine&quot;? Are you just going back to the start after coming this far?\u201D</p><p>\u201CWe always return to the first day, do we not? What are you saying now, of all times?\u201D</p><p>...This is troublesome.</p><p>The tables have been turned.</p><hr><p>\u201CI don&#39;t get it. You&#39;ve found out the trick, haven&#39;t you?</p><p>Then this should be it. This world is dying. It won&#39;t end, but it won&#39;t continue, either. Nothing will come out of staying here.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CThat is the same for the outside world, as well.</p><p>Myself, the world around me, the world that allowed it to happen, it&#39;s all started crumbling long ago.</p><p>I will not return to life. All that remains is to see just how far the destruction can be delayed.\u201D</p><hr><p>She&#39;s terrified.</p><p>She said she was terrified of the inevitable death.</p><hr><p>\u201CWe live in a world without future or hope. I would rather repeat it over and over in here than to come back to such reality.</p><p>...That&#39;s right. I wish I had realized this sooner. I am not upset at being betrayed. I had nothing to begin with. It is far better to stay here, repeating nothing but these four days, than to continue living in such a place.\u201D</p><hr><p>That&#39;s wrong.</p><p>Being weak is fine. But stalling in here is a bit of a waste.</p><p>What was it that you endured all the hardship up until now for?</p><hr><p>\u201CFar better, huh. What are YOU saying now?</p><p>Did you not know how merciless reality is from the moment you were born?\u201D</p><p>Falling into pessimism is weak.</p><p>However, it&#39;s swallowing up that weakness and dying that&#39;s the number one sign of being human; that&#39;s what the priest was saying.</p><hr><p>\u201C......The discussion ends here. Let us continue the fight.</p><p>You are my Servant. You ought to follow my directions.\u201D</p><p>Bazett is leaving the church.</p><p>It is completely beyond my expectations.</p><p>I did think that once she regains her memories, she would reject this farce once and for all.</p><hr><p>\u201C......Gonna need a little push here, methinks.\u201D</p><p>Unfortunately, I can&#39;t really think of one.</p><p>...Well, whatever.</p><p>If the Master intends to fight, the Servant ought to just follow along.</p><p>The one last push will be a job left for the hero of justice.</p><hr><p>\u201CWill you still go on?\u201D</p><p>There is a woman standing at the altar.</p><p>She&#39;s so sensitive she might just die if I get any closer.</p><p>The ultimate distance between us.</p><p>It&#39;s not like we could ever talk or touch each other to begin with.</p><hr><p>\u201CWhat can I say? The one who&#39;s in charge of the contract told me to go on with it. A familiar like me couldn&#39;t turn defiant and rip that contract up themselves, now could they? Huuuuge violation of the basic rules of magic there.\u201D</p><p>\u201CYes, I understand. For one of your standing, that certainly would be the best course of action.\u201D</p><hr><p>Her tone is cool and indifferent.</p><p>Though neither one of us cares much for the other&#39;s existence, it&#39;s not as though just talking is a waste of time.</p><p>However, I do wonder what happened.</p><p>\u201C...It was a great pleasure meeting you.\u201D</p><p>Now she says something unnecessary.</p><hr><p>\u201CAh... \u2015\u2015\u2015Well, I guess that&#39;s good.\u201D</p><p>I give a vague reply.</p><p>Whether I should show joy or bitterness, react with surprise or with sorrow...</p><p>Honestly, I have no idea.</p><hr><p>\u201CMaster&#39;s waiting outside. I&#39;ll be going soon.\u201D</p><p>The atmosphere&#39;s getting awkward, so let&#39;s get this over with.</p><hr><p>\u201C...Allow me to offer you a piece of advice.</p><p>Whether the contract is canceled or whether it runs out, she will not be saved either way.</p><p>Thus, you should rather...\u201D</p><p>I don&#39;t want to hear it.</p><p>Her statement isn&#39;t even correct in the first place.</p><hr><p>\u201CNo way. Ain&#39;t no one who can&#39;t be saved, so long as they seek help.</p><p>No matter who you are, salvation will always come in the end.\u201D</p><p>\u201C...I&#39;m astonished. Is that really something you could say, Angra Mainyu?\u201D</p><p>\u201COf course. Well, my idea of &quot;salvation&quot; may differ from the human one a tad.\u201D</p><hr><p>Ain&#39;t got no clue about bringing salvation while alive, unfortunately.</p><p>Those that fell into despair cannot be changed.</p><p>So instead, let&#39;s just switch that despair with something more meaningful.</p><p>And as one lies on their deathbed...</p><p>Being able to savor the illusion of a well-spent life in their final moments ought to bring happiness to any human.</p><hr><p>\u201C...Say. Do you really want to end that wish, even now?\u201D</p><p>\u201CYou bet. How many million times do you think this makes? The future sure looks bleak to me.\u201D</p><p>\u201CLiar.\u201D</p><p>The woman is going up the stairs.</p><p>In the end, I&#39;m the only one left in the chapel.</p><hr><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015Many million times, huh?\u201D</p><p>A string of ordinary days that I already know everything there could possibly be to know about.</p><p>Dimming ever so slightly with every new event,</p><p>A world where there is nothing to experience, where everything is known.</p><p>...There are still some cracks in it, but even those are just worthless daily life.</p><p>Well, anyway.</p><hr><p>\u201CWho do you think you&#39;re calling a liar? Ain&#39;t a more honest person than Avenger, dang it!\u201D</p><p>Being accused of lying really pisses me off.</p><p>Who the hell does that woman think I am?</p><hr><h2 id="day-1" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#day-1" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Day 1</h2><h3 id="caren-quo-vadis" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#caren-quo-vadis" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Caren Quo Vadis</h3><h3 id="caren-iii-angra-mainyu" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#caren-iii-angra-mainyu" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Caren III/(Angra Mainyu)</h3><hr><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015In the end, I&#39;ll go visit the church.</p><hr><p>I can&#39;t remember how many times I&#39;ve dragged myself here.</p><p>The rule and order of the four days do not apply here; you can meet and part however many times you wish.</p><hr><p>The two of us would eventually run out of things to talk about, though.</p><p>New elements do not enter here.

Built way before the war, it was renovated after incurring heavy damage during the third Heaven&#39;s Feel.</p><p>A person named Kotomine Risei was dispatched as a qualified candidate who was particularly familiar with the land.</p><p>Kotomine Kirei&#39;s father, the predecessor.</p><hr><p>\u201C..............................\u201D</p><p>Kotomine Risei, despite his young age, acted the role of supervisor in the third Heaven&#39;s Feel. In recognition of his achievements, he was entrusted with this church.</p><p>Plenty of experience under his belt, he strove for an even better outcome in the fourth Heaven&#39;s Feel, but passed away due to unforeseen circumstances.</p><p>The noble magi of the city he assisted suffered unexpected defeat, and the war ended in chaos.</p><hr><p>The fourth Heaven&#39;s Feel... the battle that caused Shinto&#39;s great fire.</p><p>The third one fifty years before, right after the wartime devastation, and the fourth one just as the newly modernized economy was about to stagnate.</p><p>And then the battle Emiya Shirou was involved in, bringing an end to Fuyuki&#39;s Heaven&#39;s Feel.</p><hr><p>Up to that point, it&#39;s been two hundred years.</p><p>It&#39;s amazing how these holy sacraments have been carried out until now at such a far eastern land.</p><p>The tenacity of the participants that tried to reach the miracle is near fanaticism.</p><p>Speaking of obsession, the Holy Church and the Mage&#39;s Association are not much different.</p><p>...I do wonder, though.</p><p>Is it really so good over there?</p><hr><p>But enough of that.</p><p>\u201C..........................................\u201D</p><p>\u201CAlright. Let&#39;s talk about something.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CGo ahead, then. There is nothing I need to tell.</p><p>The promise is only valid once you have told your part.\u201D</p><p>\u201CGuh, starting from me?\u201D</p><hr><p>There&#39;s no way around it. Having been outlasted in a contest of silence, it is now my job to suggest the topic of discussion.</p><p>...But I&#39;ve run out of things to say.</p><p>There&#39;s nothing I could chat about with her, nor do I have anything worth asking.</p><hr><p>Even among the things that still bother me\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><p>\u201CAh, come to think of it.\u201D</p><p>There&#39;s one matter of great interest to me!</p><hr><p>\u201CAbout what?\u201D</p><p>\u201CNo, I mean, I noticed your clothes are different.</p><p>You didn&#39;t wear the vestment at night, did you?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CThat is correct. Is there a problem?\u201D</p><p>\u201CWell, I just wondered why would you change.</p><p>They&#39;re really a lot different from regular vestments, aren&#39;t they. You&#39;re looking the part of a Sister right now, but you looked nothing like a priest at night.\u201D</p><hr><p>No, it was a completely different outfit.</p><p>She must just be thinking it&#39;s passable because it&#39;s also black like a cassock.</p><hr><p>\u201C...Are you saying that it was too light of a dress for a priest?\u201D</p><p>\u201CIt&#39;s not that... you&#39;re too lightly dressed, it&#39;s more a problem of your image. Those clothes, aren&#39;t they just a little too gaudy? They&#39;re all black, and make you look like a villain. If only you were always in your vestments, then there would be no awkward misunderstandings.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C......Back then, I went to exorcise demons.</p><p>It is my battle clothing, so it&#39;s no surprise it would have a different vibe from the vestments.\u201D</p><p>\u201CAah, so it&#39;s a combat uniform for exorcism.</p><p>...Hmmm, I guess it is easy to move around in. Since you&#39;re pretty much naked.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C......In other words, you have some sort of personal opinion regarding my clothing?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CMore like a question than an opinion. Sure, it is easy to move in, but something like that ought to make you uneasy to no end. Whose idea was that anyway?</p><p>Well, um. It&#39;s even more sketchy than a skimpy swimsuit. It&#39;s like absurdly arousing, I guess. It&#39;s not easy to just say it, so I can&#39;t really explain it well, but...\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015Uhh, have you forgotten to put on the bottom part?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><p>No answer. Does she mean &quot;yes&quot;?</p><hr><p>\u201CThat is by design. There was no skirt to begin with. Please cease your wicked thoughts.\u201D</p><p>Gah. That woman is really reading my mind.</p><hr><p>\u201CI-I guess. Yeah, there&#39;s no way it could be like that. You&#39;re a Sister at any rate, seduction would naturally be forbidden.</p><p>Sorry, it ought to have been obvious. A combat uniform like that seems pretty outrageous, so I just got curious and asked.</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015So. Whose idea was that?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CIt isn&#39;t anyone&#39;s preference.</p><p>It&#39;s just something I picked out from the ritual clothing and revised myself.\u201D</p><p>\u201CAh. So you&#39;re the one who picked it.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CIt&#39;s a result of seeking functionality. What I sought was mobility, not protection.</p><p>Also, it is no surprise you&#39;d find it lascivious. It was made for the purpose of seducing men to begin with.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CHuh?\u201D</p><p>I am stunned.</p><p>For seducing men. Is she serious...!?</p><hr><p>\u201CWhat&#39;s with that, didn&#39;t you say seduction was strictly forbidden!?\u201D</p><p>\u201CYou&#39;re the one who said that. I haven&#39;t said anything about it being prohibited.\u201D</p><p>\u201CGuh... B-But didn&#39;t you say it was blasphemy? If someone thought you weren&#39;t wearing bottoms on purpose...\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CWearing clothes for luring men, and taking your clothes off in public are different matters. You are putting it as if I am an exhibitionist.\u201D</p><p>It seems she&#39;s mad at my rudeness.</p><p>From the standpoint of a man, neither seems very different, but exhibitionism certainly would be bad. As it&#39;s a crime.</p><hr><p>\u201C...But why do you seek to charm men in the first place?</p><p>Sisters are supposed to remain chaste, aren&#39;t they? Or are you fine with anyone when it comes to men?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CIf a man wishes it, I won&#39;t refuse.</p><p>For example\u2015\u2015\u2015if you feel the thirst to uncover a woman, in response, I shall quench it.</p><p>That, too, is my work.</p><p>This body is meant to respond to pain. You would not suffer punishment.</p><p>I would be getting violated not by you, but by a demon. You, the human, would not bear the weight of the crime.\u201D</p><hr><p>I see.</p><p>If you think about it, even when she&#39;s not doing anything, she&#39;s always tinged with the taint of demons.</p><p>Even if nobody dirties their hands, she automatically gets aroused and comes anyway.</p><p>Masturbation akin to self-mutilation.</p><p>If that&#39;s an everyday routine, then of course it wouldn&#39;t make much of a difference who her partner is.</p><hr><p>\u201CWoah. So what you&#39;re saying, your daily praying and being violated by men is the same work.</p><p>...I give up. Maybe you regularly invite them over too?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CYes. If you so desire, then I will be your partner.\u201D</p><p>\u201CReally!? Lucky me! Because, you see, I have no desire for it, so it&#39;s all good!\u201D</p><hr><p>No, I&#39;m glad, very glad that I could get by without humiliating a girl.</p><p>No matter what anyone says, I am not the slightest bit inclined to try it. Even if she asked me I would want no part.</p><p>But seeing as there is a condition that it can&#39;t happen unless I feel like it, there&#39;s no problem.</p><hr><p>\u201C...Is that because I have yielded my body to many of the opposite sex? Do you prefer females that are pure and innocent?\u201D</p><p>\u201CNo, I&#39;m not picky about that.</p><p>If you&#39;re doing it because they want to, then why don&#39;t you just go at it all day and night and forget about being chaste? To &quot;love thy neighbor&quot; is your selling point.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CI\u2015\u2015\u2015I think that&#39;s different from my work, though.</p><p>I&#39;d say my actions are closer to those of a prostitute.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CThat&#39;s all the more noble.</p><p>Casual relationships and relationships of monetary exchange aren&#39;t bad, either. Way better than being some stuck-up woman that just leaves you hanging.\u201D</p><p>I look over the church with a glance.</p><p>There aren&#39;t any statues here. Doesn&#39;t look as if I&#39;ll be held in contempt.</p><hr><p>\u201CDo you get it? Even if you are, as you say, a prostitute, there&#39;s no need to feel down over it.</p><p>It&#39;s not that I don&#39;t want you physically, it&#39;s an emotional problem. I may have the desire, but so long as there is no love, I don&#39;t want to get involved.\u201D</p><hr><p>Although if she keeps wandering around before my eyes in an outfit like that, there&#39;s no telling how things will turn out.</p><p>Forget the preferences of a normal adult male; to me, those clothes are a little intense.</p><hr><p>\u201C...I understand what you are thinking. I&#39;ll keep that in mind from now on.\u201D</p><p>\u201COh? Are we done with talking about the clothes already?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CYes, that is enough. I did not want to know, but I do understand you now.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015Really, you&#39;ve become quite weak, haven&#39;t you?</p><p>To me, you look small enough to be blown away. Do you hate yourself that much?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015Huh?\u201D</p><p>Her outright provocation produces a burst of energy within me.</p><p>What did you try to see of me with those dead eyes, you...</p><hr><p>\u201CWhy&#39;s that? I don&#39;t really hate myself. If that&#39;s your way of preaching to me, mind keeping your nose out of my business?\u201D</p><p>\u201CThat is my thanks for praising my civilian clothing. Just give up and take it.</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015So. Why is it you hate me?\u201D</p><hr><p>The point we were getting to.</p><p>Following her lead, I blurt out,</p><p>\u201CWell, I just can&#39;t stand people with no desire of their own, you see.\u201D</p><p>I ignore the mountain load of minor flaws and go straight for the killer one.</p><hr><p>\u201CSee. That&#39;s why you hate yourself.</p><p>Because the Emiya Shirou who destroyed the Holy Grail did not desire anything in return.</p><p>A pattern of dedication to your neighbors and neglect for yourself, like praying for the world to be just. That, no doubt, is your way of life.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C...Yet I wonder why.</p><p>Why can you not feel the beauty of it?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CWell, I mean...\u201D</p><p>It&#39;s not beautiful or anything.</p><p>It&#39;s a problem that comes even before judging good and evil.</p><p>For starters, I&#39;m not trying to live that sort of a good-for-nothing life.</p><hr><p>\u201CNobody is blaming Emiya Shirou anymore, yet he makes no attempt to find a desire of his own.</p><p>Say... does ordinary happiness really bore you that much?\u201D</p><hr><p>Ah\u2015\u2015\u2015I get it.</p><p>My way of life is, in short, an existence for which that isn&#39;t enough.</p><p>Have as much happiness as you have life.</p><p>Just a tiny amount is not worth the trouble, it screams.</p><hr><p>\u201C...You sure put it nicely.</p><p>As expected of the substitute priest, an irrefutable paradox. If you get the chance, scold me properly next time.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CRight. I don&#39;t think my nagging will change a sense of justice you&#39;ve held for over ten years, but if you so wish, I shall attempt to persuade you once again.\u201D</p><hr><p>I take my leave.</p><p>I should have left earlier, as soon as the organ stopped.</p><p>What I wanted was a vigorous hatred.</p><p>Realizing my disgust for myself, I lost all of that motivation I had.</p><hr><p>\u201CSee ya. Looks like you&#39;ve got other things to do, so let&#39;s end it here.\u201D</p><p>If I go in any further, I&#39;ll be venturing outside my domain.</p><p>If these four days are someone&#39;s recreation of a Heaven&#39;s Feel, then Emiya Shirou and this woman, Caren, cannot meet.</p><p>If I keep meeting people who were not in the battle, Emiya Shirou&#39;s existence will collapse.</p><hr><p>\u201CYou are going to go look for the Grail, aren&#39;t you?</p><p>Have you discovered the way to end this world?\u201D</p><p>A voice rings out behind me. Even turning around is a pain.</p><hr><p>\u201CWell. According to what Tohsaka Rin says, it&#39;s just a matter of me defeating the holder of the Grail, but...\u201D</p><p>With the intelligence I have at my disposal, it just ends with a &quot;Defeat&quot; no matter how many times I try.</p><hr><p>\u201CIndeed. To accomplish that, you need to have the complete picture.</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015Unless you discover the meaning of your existence...\u201D</p><p>Meaning self-awareness, recognizing what it is that I must do.</p><p>&quot;Don&#39;t have someone tell you, find it by yourself,&quot; is what this woman is saying.</p><hr><p>\u201CFind the enemy&#39;s stronghold. The key to the beginning should be there.\u201D</p><p>\u201CThanks, but I&#39;ve already investigated that mansion a long time ago, if that&#39;s what you&#39;re referring to.\u201D</p><p>\u201CThere&#39;s something you have overlooked. Go and ask the Tohsaka heir about London.\u201D</p><hr><p>A straightforward piece of precise advice.</p><p>I don&#39;t want to look back, but my feet stop and my neck turns.</p><p>See. That&#39;s why I didn&#39;t want to look.</p><hr><p>\u201CIt&#39;s a violation of contract. Even though it was only about exchanging information.\u201D</p><p>\u201CThis time is an exception.</p><p>I said it, did I not. If you are still lost the next time you come, I shall point out the way.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><p>Did she really make a promise like that by herself?</p><p>Really, she&#39;s a woman that goes and does anything and everything.</p><hr><p>\u201CThanks. This means our business is really settled now, right?\u201D</p><p>\u201CYes. This is as close as I can get involved with Emiya Shirou.\u201D</p><hr><p>I leave the church.</p><p>Emiya Shirou had not met Caren Ortensia to begin with.</p><p>It&#39;s always been an impossible event.</p><p>I have no reason to grieve, even if this was our final farewell.</p><hr><h3 id="emiya-residence\u30FBstart-of-night-things-to-do" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#emiya-residence\u30FBstart-of-night-things-to-do" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Emiya Residence\u30FBStart of Night Things to do</h3><h3 id="emiya-residence\u30FBnight-map-in-london" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#emiya-residence\u30FBnight-map-in-london" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Emiya Residence\u30FBNight Map In London</h3><hr><p>Come to think of it, she&#39;s been all the way to England and back, so why not take the opportunity to ask her what it was like?</p><p>Even if I&#39;m not very good, I&#39;m still a magus. I&#39;m interested in what the headquarters of the Mage&#39;s Association, the &quot;Clock Tower&quot; in London, is like.</p><hr><p>\u201CWhat kind of place? It&#39;s just an ordinary museum, really.</p><p>Oh, you want your souvenir?\u201D</p><p>With that, Tohsaka takes out an super thick book and offers it to me.</p><p>It&#39;s a cheap and worthless art catalog, something that could be bought with a discount at the British Museum.</p><hr><p>\u201C...Well, I&#39;ll take it.\u201D</p><p>I accept the present, giving her my thanks.</p><p>\u201CYou&#39;re welcome. After all, I&#39;ll expect you to work hard if I ever have money troubles. You should start learning how to project things other than weapons. If sculptures are too bulky, why not aim to project pictures?\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><p>That&#39;s Tohsaka for you. Even a souvenir is an investment for her.</p><hr><p>\u201C...I won&#39;t support criminal activities.</p><p>First of all, there are certified appraisers who deal in magic, aren&#39;t there? It wouldn&#39;t take them much more than a glance to see through my counterfeits.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CAh, you don&#39;t seem to fully understand your unique skill yet. There&#39;s no one who can see through your projections at first glance.</p><p>Experts who check the composition would be the first to fail. Spiritual practitioners may sense something out of place with it, but only items with a shady history are sent to the Department of Spiritual Invocation. If you just sell the artwork and escape, you can make a fortune.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CEh, really...?\u201D</p><p>\u201CReally, really. So much so to make me proud as your teacher as well.\u201D</p><p>Ugh. It&#39;s a bit complicated, but I actually might be feeling pretty good about this.</p><hr><p>\u201CWell, the frightening part is after doing something like that.</p><p>We&#39;re not Bonny and Clyde. I couldn&#39;t take being on the wanted list even in exchange for a huge fortune.\u201D</p><p>\u201CI couldn&#39;t bear that either. I treasure my life more than money.\u201D</p><p>Plus, being treated as an accomplice when I was only dragged into it would also be intolerable.</p><hr><p>\u201CLet&#39;s see... It might be fun to earn money in a showy way like that, but it all means nothing if you&#39;re exposed instantly. It&#39;s a business that doesn&#39;t require any capital or resources, so let&#39;s just steadily do something low-key instead.\u201D</p><p>\u201C..................\u201D</p><p>A joke. That was just a typical Tohsaka joke.</p><p>I repeated that three times in my mind, then decided to abruptly change the subject.</p><hr><p>\u201CLet&#39;s save the business talk for later.</p><p>Back to London, was there anything that left a strong impression on you? Something like the prices being cheap, the cooking being bad, or making a new friend there?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CSo you want travel stories instead of souvenirs?</p><p>...Let&#39;s see, the Clock Tower was exactly as the name suggests, but most of the workshops there were underground.</p><p>It was exactly like a dungeon where the level of insanity goes up the deeper you descend.</p><p>They label Egypt&#39;s Association as a hole in the ground, but those at the Clock Tower are pretty much moles themselves.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C..Hmm. So, anything else? Don&#39;t you have some <em>normal</em> stories to share?\u201D</p><p>\u201CAnything else... Well, I didn&#39;t really have the time to go sightseeing.</p><p>I scraped together materials to make up for the Jewel Sword incident, reserved laboratories, spoke to the higher-ups in the Department of Mineralogy countless times, narrowed down the nobles who seemed like they could become sponsors for me, searched for an apartment to use next year, and just in case, went to look at the student dormitories which are said to have cheap rent\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CWhat&#39;s the matter? You look like you just bit into something sour.\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015Well... When I went to check out the student dormitories, I met a disagreeable woman.</p><p>Thanks to that bitch, I was expelled from the dorm and forced to look for a regular apartment.\u201D</p><p>A vein is pulsing on her forehead.</p><p>Tohsaka can be harsh at times and yet, I think this was the first time I&#39;ve ever heard her call someone a &quot;bitch.&quot;</p><hr><p>\u201CCould it be that this disagreeable woman you&#39;re talking about is around the same age as us?\u201D</p><p>\u201CHuh\u2015\u2015\u2015W-Why do you say that?\u201D</p><p>\u201CNo, just a hunch. Seeing you talking like that is a little, you know...\u201D</p><p>The way she spoke about her with such disdain sounds like the kind of thing you&#39;d expect between equals or, to be frank, similar people.</p><hr><p>\u201C...Well, it&#39;s as you said.</p><p>I came across her at the reception desk. At first she spoke normally. She greeted me politely, and the conversation with her was quite agreeable.</p><p>Well, I did wonder a bit about the way she dressed, but you could tell at first glance she was rich and there was nothing <em>yet</em> to make me realize she had such bad taste.\u201D</p><hr><p>I felt a tinge of hatred in the word &quot;yet.&quot;</p><p>The intensity of Tohsaka&#39;s irritation is steadily increasing, and now even her magical energy is pulsing along with the vein on her forehead. It seems like she&#39;s just venting.</p><p>...Now then.</p><p>As Tohsaka&#39;s story becomes nothing but a continuous stream of dirty phrases beyond this point, let&#39;s go to a flashback instead.</p><hr><p>\u300A...Of my entire time in the student dorms, that incident was by far the worst.</p><p>Miss Tohsaka and Lady Luviagelita.</p><p>There&#39;s no point in debating which one of them is the culprit.</p><p>The only thing we should leave for future generations is the fact that we should never allow those two ladies to be in each other&#39;s presence\u2015\u2015\u2015\u300B</p><p>August 8th, 200X. Receptionist Octavia Leyland&#39;s testimony.</p><hr><p>\u201CYes. That should be all.</p><p>I will inquire about rooms that fit your requirements, please wait a moment.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CPhew, I somehow managed to make it.</p><p>Now just to wait for the outcome... Hm?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CPardon me, may I?</p><p>This is the registration desk for next year&#39;s residents, correct?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CY-Yes, please go ahead. Sorry for the obstruction. If you&#39;re here to register, you should hurry\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CI am aware of that. There are seven minutes remaining, right?</p><p>You and I, we are not quite used to this place&#39;s time, are we?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CPardon me. I&#39;ve brought the necessary documents. Will that be all?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CAh, yes, this is sufficient, madam.</p><p>Then I will take these and register you. You should return home for today... Oh my, did our maximum capacity increase by one?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CMy apologies. Please wait a moment.</p><p>I shall confirm this right away.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C..................\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C..................\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C..............................\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C..............................\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C..............................um,\u201D</p><p>\u201C..............................hey,\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CSorry, please go ahead.</p><p>Or would you prefer if I go first?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CNo, since you went through the trouble to offer, I shall humbly accept your consideration.</p><p>Would it be alright if I ask a question?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201COf course.</p><p>It seems we are both bored, and it feels like the work of some fate that we should meet like this.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CI feel the same way... Fufu. It may have been a simple intuition, but I had a feeling we would get along from the moment I first saw you.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CThough, for those who practice magic, relying on one&#39;s intuition based on a first impression is the same as making a premonition without any basis.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CNot at all. If it is a premonition instead of a prediction, then it is an incredible feat to rely on your intuition alone.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CBesides\u2015\u2015\u2015I trust your intuition has never lead you astray before, correct?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201COh? Could that be your intuition?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CYeah. It&#39;s not so unusual to let your guard down around someone you feel is similar to yourself.</p><p>After all, it&#39;s that way for me too.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CYou&#39;re saying your intuition is never off the mark?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C...Fufu. Yes, there is no error in your intuition.</p><p><em>I</em> have never misjudged another&#39;s personality, even on the first meeting.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CThat&#39;s quite some self confidence.</p><p>So, what&#39;s the impression you get from me?</p><p>What sort of person do you see me as?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CStubborn, but a rival worthy of respect\u2015\u2015\u2015someone like that, I suppose.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CFrom your appearance, you seem to be a first year as well, but this is the first time I&#39;ve spoken to an oriental person.</p><p>I know this is impolite, but are you Chinese?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CThat&#39;s quite a baseless assumption. What makes you think that?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CThe way you move your feet and shift your center of gravity, perhaps. In the past, I received lessons from someone who gave off that same kind of feel.</p><p>And of course, that person was an expert of your homeland.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CI see.</p><p>However, to say, &quot;homeland&quot;... I beg your pardon, but I haven&#39;t answered your question yet...\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CUnfortunately, I&#39;m Japanese.</p><p>However, I&#39;m not purely Japanese, as a quarter of my bloodline is foreign.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C...So you were Japanese.</p><p>Well, such mistakes can happen. Perhaps this is yet another sign for us to deepen this friendship during our time here.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CGreetings, freshman from the Orient.</p><p>My homeland is Finland.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CCompared to yours, it&#39;s practically right next door.</p><p>Japan is at the other side of the earth, isn&#39;t it? Surely, you didn&#39;t come here all by yourself?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CMy parents have already passed away. That&#39;s not the reason why, but I&#39;ll be coming by myself to enroll at the Clock Tower next year.</p><p>Are Asians a rare sight in London?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CI&#39;ve heard there aren&#39;t many. However, those that have left their names behind are all top of the line magi apparently.</p><p>You should see there&#39;s no handicap based on race.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CI see, that&#39;s good news.</p><p>Frankly speaking, I was a little disheartened until now.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CI&#39;m only here for a month to get a feel for this place, yet everyone I meet here is a monster, you know?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CWell, even a Tengu&#39;s nose can break... though I suppose you aren&#39;t familiar with that saying.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CAh, I have heard of Tengu.</p><p>The hermit of Japan, with the long nose, right?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CThe proverb, &quot;A Tengu&#39;s nose can break,&quot; refers to a powerful and talented person bowing before an even greater power... is that correct?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CYes, you got the nuance right.</p><p>I was brimming with confidence in my home town, but once I ventured outside, I had to reaffirm my resolve.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CYou too?</p><p>Actually, I had been thinking the same thing myself.</p><p>...We really are going to get along well.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CSay, we&#39;ve both come to study abroad by ourselves, right?</p><p>In that case\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CExcuse me.</p><p>Luviagelita Edelfelt-sama, could I have a moment of your time?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C...Of all the times to interrupt.</p><p>What? Is there some problem with the documents?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CNo, there&#39;s nothing wrong with the documents, but... um, the situation has changed from what it was a week ago.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CTo put it bluntly, we cannot comply with your request.</p><p>Your request was for the entire top floor, but there is a new applicant wishing to move in...\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CWishing to move in...?</p><p>Even though it&#39;s already widely known that an Edelfelt had chosen this dormitory?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CJust who exactly is the country bumpkin that would move in here for the sole purpose of ruining my mood?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CUm... That would be the young lady next to you.</p><p>We received a recommendation from a Lord in regards to her about half a year ago, can&#39;t the Edelfelt&#39;s override it with their authority?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C......That&#39;s alright.</p><p>I cannot allow for my family&#39;s crest to be inferior to another, but if she&#39;s just sharing a room with me, I may consider it.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CUmm... She won&#39;t be sharing a room with you. She will be using only one of the 28 rooms you booked\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C? Is not that what sharing a room is?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CTwo humans living on the same floor, if that is not room-sharing, then what is?</p><p>She isn&#39;t my servant, is she?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CAh... haha, ha...\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C...Well, that can&#39;t be helped either.</p><p>I normally wouldn&#39;t allow for such a thing, but fortunately, this gives us the opportunity to deepen our friendship even further.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CHow does that sound? If it is with you, even sharing a room does not sound bad, wouldn&#39;t you say?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CNo problem... I wouldn&#39;t say I have any complaints... but you sure are rich.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CThen it&#39;s decided.</p><p>You there, she and I will be sharing a room... Ah, come to think of it, we still haven&#39;t introduced ourselves.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CI am Luviagelita Edelfelt. And you are...?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CTohsaka Rin. A Japanese magus studying in the Department of Mineralogy.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C...<em>Tohsaka</em>...?</p><p>Wait a moment, that name...

That&#39;s, one hell of a story.\u201D</p><p>Her opponent was impressive, but the same goes for Tohsaka who jumped into the fray without any hesitation.</p><p>As expected from a frequent offender.</p><p>It may have been the student dormitory instead of the school building, but that wasn&#39;t the first time Tohsaka had rampaged on school grounds.</p><hr><p>\u201CSo then, you guys rushed into a second round of mudslinging?</p><p>By the time you realized it, the reception area had collapsed and you were both punished for fighting... Tohsaka, wasn&#39;t it your own fault that you ended up banned from the dorm?\u201D</p><p>\u201CIt wasn&#39;t just my fault.</p><p>If Luvia hadn&#39;t charged at me like that, I wouldn&#39;t have gotten such a disgraceful nickname before school even started!\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C..................\u201D</p><p>I am interested in that disgraceful nickname she mentioned, but... Oh well, it&#39;s probably something along the lines of &quot;monster&quot; or &quot;hurricane.&quot;</p><p>\u201C...What are you grinning about? If you have something to say, just say it.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CAlright, but don&#39;t get angry. This is just what I feel.</p><p>Umm, her name was Luvia right? Isn&#39;t that girl a lot like you, Tohsaka?</p><p>I think you guys get along well, Oow!?\u201D</p><p>I saw them!</p><p>The stars I hadn&#39;t seen in a while!</p><hr><p>\u201C...Kuh, that ended too quickly.</p><p>If only I had lashed out like this back then, she wouldn&#39;t have pulled off that back-drop...!\u201D</p><p>Her fists shake with self-satisfaction.</p><p>I see, so Miss Luvia&#39;s deathblow was a suplex.</p><hr><p>\u201CSo, and why did that blow pay me a visit?\u201D</p><p>\u201CHehe. When I heard the words I didn&#39;t want to hear the most, my body just responded on its own.\u201D</p><p>...Like they say, one rotten apple spoils the barrel.</p><p>It seems that, due to meeting this Miss Luvia, Tohsaka&#39;s level of violence has risen considerably.</p><hr><p>\u201C...Hmph. I will say this before you make any weird misunderstandings. I will never ever get along with Luvia.</p><p>That girl hates Japanese people and loves bullying them. In the end, I threw down my glove as well.\u201D</p><p>\u201CWow, throwing down your glove? That&#39;s really old-fashioned.\u201D</p><p>But then again, I&#39;ve heard people from over there act that way.</p><p>If Tohsaka were to have grown up in England as well, I don&#39;t doubt that she would hurl one of those at me.</p><hr><p>\u201CHowever, isn&#39;t that a little too extreme? Does that girl have a grudge or something against Japan?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CYes, that Girl... Luviagelita Edelfelt. It is said that the Edelfelts are a well-known and relatively prestigious noble house.</p><p>Although they are aristocrats, they hold mercenary-like precepts in their family. Whenever there&#39;s a conflict, they would happily show up and snatch the best parts away. They are said to be feared as, &quot;the most elegant hyenas on earth.&quot;\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C......Say, don&#39;t you think this sounds more and more like a certain someone, Tohsaka?\u201D</p><p>\u201CBe quiet and listen!</p><p>And so, because they like fighting so much, they participated in a ritual in a far east island country out of idle curiosity.</p><p>This is a tale from over sixty years ago. A pair of twin sisters headed the Edelfelt family and although they were very famous magi, they were utterly defeated. The younger sister was killed in action, while the eldest somehow survived and returned back to her country.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C..................\u201D</p><p>This entertaining story suddenly took a stark turn.</p><p>Edelfelt.</p><p>The twin heads of the family.</p><p>And also, a ritual that was performed sixty years ago in a far east island country.</p><hr><p>\u201CTohsaka, you mean...\u201D</p><p>\u201CI&#39;m referring to the third Heaven&#39;s Feel. As a result of that, Luvia hates Japanese people.</p><p>But then, we were also underestimated by them. It&#39;s said that the twin heads back then didn&#39;t get along with each other to an unusual degree. There&#39;s even a rumor that the younger sister died because she got into a fight with the elder sister.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C...Oh yeah. If I recall, they built a western-style house somewhere over here due to an insinuating remark by the Einzberns. Something like a hideout deep in the forest.</p><p>That house was actually built for a single sister. Although siblings, it seems that they hated the idea of even breathing the same air.\u201D</p><hr><p>...A hideout in the forest...?</p><p>...Moreover, it was built just for one sister, that means...?</p><hr><p>\u201CA western house built sixty years ago... So, that Luvia girl owns a villa over here?\u201D</p><p>\u201CAh. I see, I guess she would inherit it.</p><p>But wouldn&#39;t anything here have been abandoned ages ago? The Edelfelts apparently said they would never step onto Japanese soil again. So, I think they would have handed everything over to the Mage&#39;s Association.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><p>It&#39;s all falling into place.</p><p>I don&#39;t quite know what &quot;it&quot; is yet, but in any case, I&#39;ve obtained another important piece of the puzzle.</p><hr><p>\u201C...I wonder if that was used as a magus&#39; hideout?</p><p>Could this be related to the Master that Kotomine ambushed in the Heaven&#39;s Feel half a year ago?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CThat&#39;s right. The magus who was dispatched by the association and had his command spells stolen by Kotomine.</p><p>I&#39;ve told you about how I found that hideout while searching for Lancer&#39;s Master, right?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CYeah. Also about the bloodstains and a hand from which the command spells were stolen... Wait, so if that hideout you found was the house that belonged to the Edelfelts, does that mean that there are <em>two of them</em>?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CThat&#39;s right. Those sisters built those houses in order to enter a battlefield in a foreign land, so they are famously known as the Twin Houses of Edelfelt.</p><p>Well, the one I discovered was near my house. I don&#39;t know where the other one is.\u201D</p><p>\u201CWait. When you say it&#39;s near your house, you mean it&#39;s in Miyama?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CCorrect. The darkest place is right under the candlestick. Building a house under the very nose of the Tohsaka family, the supervisors of this town, what nerve.\u201D</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015That&#39;s exactly right.</p><p>Looking back on it, that was definitely a mistake, but it&#39;s also the single biggest <em>mislead</em> for a certain &quot;someone.&quot;</p><hr><p>\u201CWhat, are you interested, Emiya-kun?</p><p>If you like, shall we visit that place during the holidays next week?\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015Hm. If it sorts out this mess, that might not be a bad idea.\u201D</p><hr><p>I give her an absent-minded reply while holding back my dizziness.</p><p>Tohsaka&#39;s souvenir stories continue.</p><p>The story of Edelfelt though, didn&#39;t come up again.</p><hr><h3 id="emiya-residence\u30FBstart-of-night\u30FBgood-night" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#emiya-residence\u30FBstart-of-night\u30FBgood-night" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Emiya Residence\u30FBStart of Night\u30FBGood Night</h3><h2 id="day-2" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#day-2" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Day 2</h2><h3 id="emiya-s\u30FBday-2-light-hearted-promise" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#emiya-s\u30FBday-2-light-hearted-promise" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Emiya&#39;s\u30FBDay 2 Light-hearted promise</h3><hr><p>\u201CShirou, did you do your homework?\u201D</p><p>Says Fuji-Nee as she calmly eats her rice crackers.</p><hr><p>See, even though Fuji-Nee is always lazy and laid back, deep down, she&#39;s actually a diligent and honest English teacher.</p><p>She gets energized when things get exciting around her, but she also calms down when it&#39;s tranquil, the usual party type.</p><hr><p>\u201CYeah. It&#39;ll be all done by the time holidays end.\u201D</p><p>\u201CReally? That&#39;s good, but you won&#39;t show it to any other students, right? Copying the work of others doesn&#39;t count as your own, so you also have to reject anyone who asks to see your work.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CI&#39;ll do my best.\u201D</p><p>Nevertheless, I&#39;m certain that anyone who would actually ask to copy my work is absolutely hopeless.</p><p>Because I&#39;m wrong more than half the time.</p><p>If they do acknowledge all that and ask me anyway, I&#39;ll probably end up lending it... at their own risk.</p><hr><p>\u201CGood. It&#39;s not that you&#39;re going to get punished if you fail to do so, I&#39;m just telling you not to think you&#39;re doing anyone a favor. The problem is, when those skills become necessary, the person who you helped will be all on their own.\u201D</p><hr><p>Like the teacher that she is, her view on this is serious.</p><p>Of course, her hand is already reaching out on the table in search of another pastry. Her eyes are still directed at the TV screen, however.</p><p>Rotating the pastry plate, Saber moves the crackers within the hand&#39;s reach.</p><p>Munchmunch, goes another rice cracker in the Tiger-sensei&#39;s jaws.</p><hr><p>\u201CShirou.\u201D</p><p>\u201CWhat is it, Saber?\u201D</p><p>\u201CYou and Taiga were talking about matters regarding the schoolhouse, were you not?\u201D</p><p>\u201CYeah.\u201D</p><p>Turning away from the laid-back TV-watching Fuji-Nee, Saber is now facing me.</p><hr><p>\u201CWhile it is not a particularly meaningful question, I would like to ask what kind of place is this schoolhouse that you and others regularly visit.</p><p>No, having visited it on several occasions, I am familiar with the building itself...\u201D</p><p>\u201CUmm\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><p>What kind of place... I&#39;m not sure how to answer that.</p><hr><p>\u201CI think it&#39;s just a regular school, nothing special.</p><p>Well, we may be putting a little less attention on club activities than other schools, though.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CJust normal, is it?\u201D</p><p>\u201CYeah, can&#39;t think of any other way to describe it. It&#39;s not like we have any prominent gangs or anything.</p><p>What else is there to say\u2015\u2015\u2015hmm?\u201D</p><p>Taking a sip of tea, I suddenly thought of something.</p><p>Fuji-Nee is right there, so I whisper to Saber.</p><hr><p>\u201C...Hey, didn&#39;t you say that when Servants are summoned, they gain knowledge of their current location?\u201D</p><p>\u201CThat is correct. However, I am not asking what a school itself is, I am asking what kind of a school is Homurabara.\u201D</p><p>\u201CHm\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><p>I see. If that&#39;s the case, I might still have a way of explaining it.</p><hr><p>\u201CThen, Saber-chan...\u201D</p><p>Fuji-Nee, who was just watching TV, suddenly turns her head towards us.</p><hr><p>\u201CWhat is it?\u201D</p><p>\u201CIf you&#39;re curious, why not come visit sometime?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CIs that all right, Taiga?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CNo problem at all. I know you won&#39;t cause any trouble, Saber-chan. Well, we still can&#39;t let you walk around all by yourself, though.\u201D</p><p>...Of course. We need someone to show her around.</p><hr><p>\u201CHey, Fuji-Nee, who do we usually have showing visitors around the school?\u201D</p><p>\u201CHmm... Well, whenever we have any important guests, it&#39;s usually the teachers that show them around.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CFuji-Nee, you need to think this through carefully.</p><p>We can&#39;t hand Saber to just anyone. It ought to be someone we can trust.\u201D</p><hr><p>While it may be best for Saber to go with Fuji-Nee, it doesn&#39;t really put me at ease.</p><p>Among others that I can count on to look after Saber, the ones who could possibly show her around include the student council&#39;s chairman, Issei, or maybe its advisor, Kuzuki-sensei.</p><hr><p>\u201CWhat are you saying, Shirou?\u201D</p><p>\u201CI&#39;m saying that if Saber were to come to our school, we&#39;d need to get a trustworthy person to guide her around.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CSo why does it absolutely have to be someone else?</p><p>Shouldn&#39;t showing Saber-chan around be left to you, Shirou?\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015Huh? Um, can I?\u201D</p><p>Is it alright for a regular student to show a visitor around...?</p><hr><p>\u201COf course. Unless you don&#39;t want to do it?\u201D</p><p>\u201CWhat are you saying? It&#39;s nothing like that.\u201D</p><p>It&#39;s actually the exact opposite. I&#39;d love to, if I could, it&#39;s just that I didn&#39;t think it was appropriate.</p><hr><p>\u201CProblem solved, then. Really, you&#39;re overthinking the oddest things sometimes, Shirou.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C...Taiga, is it really okay?</p><p>I would rather not visit if it would cause you trouble.\u201D</p><p>\u201CSaber-chan, when an adult says it&#39;s all right, children shouldn&#39;t keep worrying about it.\u201D</p><p>Wow, Fuji-Nee is in full-on adult mode this morning.</p><p>It&#39;s truly fortunate that only Saber and me are around.</p><hr><p>\u201CYou&#39;re fine with that, right, Shirou? Then I&#39;ll leave the tour to you.\u201D</p><p>\u201CYeah. I bet you&#39;d prefer it was someone you knew, too, Saber?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CYes, indeed.\u201D</p><p>\u201CAlso, Fuji-Nee. What are you grinning for?\u201D</p><p>...Crap.

If I do not use my lance, Fragarach is just gonna be a low-level Noble Phantasm. Of course, if she keeps hitting me with it, the &#39;No Noble Phantasm&#39; policy might become a tad annoying.\u201D</p><hr><p>Lancer&#39;s glance tells me that there&#39;s no way he would lose with this strategy.</p><p>...Indeed, amateur magecraft and regular ranged attacks, like arrows and knife-throwing, won&#39;t even scratch him.</p><p>His combat skill is also superior to Bazett&#39;s. Should he fight consistently, victory should not be a problem.</p><p>However.</p><hr><p>\u201CThat woman and I are gonna settle everything with our Noble Phantasms.</p><p>It&#39;ll be over soon, so just stay back and watch.\u201D</p><p>Fragarach is undefeatable.</p><p>Despite this fact, Lancer still rose to the sword&#39;s challenge.</p><hr><p>Up the hill, and towards the makeshift arena.</p><p>The dim moonlight muddies the view slightly.</p><p>Whether the moon is dark, or the stars are close tonight.</p><p>In the void of the night where one can touch the darkness with a stretch of hand, there were two figures waiting for our arrival.</p><hr><p>No longer knowing how many times this had occurred before.</p><p>The lady magus, followed by a <ruby>dark shadow<rt>Avenger</rt></ruby>, fixed her stare onto the enemy, as always.</p><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><p>As if she beheld a ghost, her sight became transfixed on Lancer&#39;s shape.</p><hr><p>Lancer did not pay any attention to the magus.

That&#39;s the prerequisite for releasing the Fragarach.</p><p>The enemy will always move first.</p><p>Accordingly, even if Fragarach defeats the enemy in one blow, the lady magus will be simultaneously destroyed by the opponent&#39;s Noble Phantasm.</p><p>What sounds like a certain kill is a mutual attack made with the premise of one&#39;s own death.</p><hr><p>However, Bazett&#39;s sword reverses all of that.</p><p>It is released immediately after the activation of the enemy&#39;s Noble Phantasm, yet no matter how fast the opposing weapon is, it will always reach its target first, taking the enemy&#39;s life.</p><p>A Noble Phantasm that delivers the final strike in a needle-thin concentrated blast, that alone deserves praise.</p><p>But its truly dreaded power lies in its special ability.</p><p><em>Unleashed last, yet strikes first.</em></p><p>Like those words imply, Fragarach warps the idea of cause and effect, rewriting its own attack as the &quot;event that occurred first.&quot;</p><hr><p>And the result?</p><p>No matter how great a Noble Phantasm may be, the dead can not use it.</p><p><em>For one who is killed before attacking, all later actions would become void.</em></p><p>Fragarach&#39;s magic exaggerates this fact.</p><p>It is a curse that distorts the concept of fate.</p><hr><p>That weapon is a demonic sword of reversal that can nullify any attacks.</p><p>With time as its blade, this weapon of gods has no equal.</p><p>And therefore,</p><p>Lancer, who had just released his spear, will not be made an exception\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><p>The sword of the war god is approaching.</p><p>Once Fragarach is let out, it cannot be stopped.</p><p>When Gae Bolg meets Fragarach, the former will shatter. The spearman is well aware of this.</p><hr><p>To survive an attack made by the sword of the war god, one needs to possess an auto-resurrecting Noble Phantasm, or more than one life.</p><p>In other words, &quot;something that is resurrected after being killed&quot; would be Fragarach&#39;s natural enemy.</p><p>Of course, Lancer does not have anything of the sort.</p><p>The spearman knew the conclusion of the battle he entered before it even started.</p><hr><p>At that moment.</p><p>It was only a split second, but the man in front of me seems to have faltered.</p><hr><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015It&#39;s not like I wanna say this.</p><p>But I&#39;m kinda in a pinch.

His son that grew up in a distant foreign land.</p><p>But even before that, a single woman must have been murdered.</p><hr><p>Thinking back, it was a life full of wrong turns.</p><p>Though it&#39;s impossible to swap one&#39;s life for another, the chance to save someone means the regrets of his youth could finally be left behind.</p><p>His lips curve into a resolute grin.</p><p>A grimace of a shattered heart on the spearman&#39;s face,</p><p>\u201CAh, but\u2015\u2015\u2015why don&#39;t I ever have any luck with good women?\u201D</p><p>Only now is there a complaint about his fate.</p><hr><p>\u201CGotcha......!\u201D</p><p>And so the lady magus is confident in her victory.</p><p>The sword of the war god has hit its target before the enemy&#39;s lance.</p><p>At that moment, the enemy&#39;s attack became an &quot;impossible event&quot; will disappear back in time.</p><p>This is the world&#39;s fundamental law.</p><p>A natural result, protected by the absolute order called &quot;time.&quot;</p><hr><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015Huh?\u201D</p><p>Yet there is more to unfold.</p><p>A law is defeated by another law.</p><p>The presence of the curse of time, the spearman being no exception,</p><hr><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><p>Won over.</p><p>Like a flash of lightning, the sharp tip pierces through her ribcage.
