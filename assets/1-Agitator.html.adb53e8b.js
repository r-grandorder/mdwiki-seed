Probably because of overexertion during the day. There is something wrong with this much heat.&quot;</p><p>I had heard that Japanese summers were hot, but I had not thought it would be this bad.</p><p>The heat shining back from this town is too strong even for me, a child of the desert.</p><hr><p>I thought I would sleep through the heat of the day, but it seems I could not control the time of my awakening.</p><hr><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;...... A cold night. I must have slept too long?&quot;</p><p>Whatever the case, confusion is for certain.</p><p>Not sleeping properly and not ordering all this information is setting myself up for failure.</p><hr><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;......

Then, all that&#39;s left is this?&quot;</p><p>I come out to an unfamiliar clearing.</p><p>A small clearing apart from the office buildings.</p><hr><p>Until a short while ago everything was another large city park but it now transitions into private property.</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Wow. From down here it really looks impressive.&quot;</p><hr><p>I look up at the building under construction.</p><p>I heard the monumental architecture would be finished next spring.</p><p>Nobody seems to be sure exactly what it&#39;s going to be, but it&#39;s something important.</p><p>I&#39;ve heard everything from a big department store to the corporate office of a powerful electronics company.</p><hr><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;The area around it is also being landscaped. Maybe I don&#39;t have to go this far.&quot;</p><p>The land all around the building is perfectly flat like a mirror.</p><p>The name of the building, Shrine, may be appropriate... but it&#39;s going a little too far.</p><hr><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500Well...&quot;</p><p>I hold my breath and scan the area.</p><p>No sign of anyone else around.</p><p>Of course there are less and less people as night falls, thanks to the rumors of the vampire murders starting up again, but...</p><hr><p>I can understand why no one would be in the park, or the back alley, but this place is empty of people for another reason.</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;...... Well, after all, this is private property. The only people around would be trespassing, so why should I expect to see anybody......?&quot;</p><p>\u2500\u2500\u2500And then,</p><p>I suddenly get assailed by nausea.</p><p>My fingers are numb and my throat is parched.</p><p>My pulse quickens.</p><p>A feeling like poison creeping from the back of my brain.</p><p>Without even realizing it, my right hand reaches into my pocket and soundlessly takes out my knife.</p><hr><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500This... sensation.&quot;</p><p>...... I&#39;ve felt these chills so many times before.</p><p>Am I just disposed to this?</p><p>Before I meet up with something unworldly, I always get assailed by this sensation.</p><hr><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;............&quot;</p><p>...... I sense someone.</p><p>Someone standing right behind me.</p><p>Someone (a human?) on this private property where no one should be.</p><p>A faint chill.</p><p>And...... the vampire has returned\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500!</p><hr><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;...... But, something is......&quot;</p><p>It feels a little different.</p><p>Are my reactions weak?</p><p>It simply feels &quot;different from usual&quot;, a discomfort that indicates the presence of an outsider.</p><hr><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;\u2500\u2500Well, show yourself......!&quot;</p><hr><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Hello? Is someone there?&quot;</p><p>I speak with my knife hidden behind my back.</p><p>\u2500\u2500\u2500And then,</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Good evening. Do you have business with me?&quot;</p><p>Even though it was all so sudden, the girl speaks so calmly.</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500&quot;</p><hr><p>Seeing her, I was startled.</p><p>That distinctive dress and hat.</p><p>Definitely a foreign look, and I&#39;m almost afraid to say it, but she looks really cute.</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;What is it?&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Oh, ah... well, no, nothing really.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Um\u2500\u2500Sorry, I mistook you for someone else. Sorry to be so rude.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;You do not have to apologize.</p><p>But that is not the way to greet someone, is it?&quot;</p><hr><p>Her tone is so smooth.</p><p>...... Now that she mentions it, it makes total sense.</p><p>Lately, I seem to be off-kilter.</p><hr><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;...... You&#39;re right. It&#39;s a little late, but, good evening.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Yes, nice to meet you.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;So, what are you doing here?</p><p>Are you looking for something at this hour?&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Eh? ...... Ah, yeah, something like that.</p><p>And what about you? You couldn&#39;t have not heard about how dangerous it is at night\u2500\u2500&quot;</p><hr><p>Oh, right.</p><p>If she&#39;s a foreigner, she wouldn&#39;t have heard the rumors circulating this town.</p><p>Since she&#39;s probably just sightseeing, she wouldn&#39;t know anything about the vampire murders last year, either......</p><hr><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;It&#39;s nothing...... Um, I don&#39;t know why you are here, but it&#39;s better to not hang around places where no one is around. You never know what might happen.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500&quot;</p><hr><p>She just stares at me.</p><p>...... It&#39;s only natural.</p><p>There&#39;s no way she can understand me if I keep suddenly blurting out all this stuff.</p><hr><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;No, you cannot say I don&#39;t know what will happen. Whatever shape he takes, the vampire will appear. Even you are patrolling in order to find him, are you not, Tohno Shiki?&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;W\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500what?&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;You could say we are looking for the same thing, Tohno Shiki. ...... Although our reasons are very different.&quot;</p><hr><p>She speaks devoid of any expression.</p><p>Those chills return.</p><p>Pain in my temples like a stabbing needle...</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;An irregularity like you throws the equation out of balance. Unless I move quickly to root out any problems, the results this time will also be undesirable.&quot;</p><p>Her arms swings forth and I hear an unfamiliar click.</p><p>She holds a black gun in her hand.</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500Please, resist if you wish. My name is Sion Eltnam Atlasia. Your freedom now belongs to me.&quot;</p><p>And with that, she jumps towards me.</p><p>This foreign girl I&#39;d never met before attacks me with almost unspeakable speed.</p><hr><h2 id="shiki-vs-sion" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#shiki-vs-sion" aria-hidden="true">#</a> <em>Shiki vs Sion</em></h2><h2 id="shiki-wins" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#shiki-wins" aria-hidden="true">#</a> <em>Shiki wins</em></h2><hr><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Ahh......&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;That&#39;s enough. I don&#39;t know what you&#39;re trying to do, but it&#39;s meaningless to continue.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Yes. I admit defeat. Even though I collected all your data I could not finish reading it. ...... Even if everything was walking on a tightrope I can&#39;t believe I&#39;m finished before even had a chance to start.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;...............&quot;</p><hr><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;What&#39;s the matter? I have no strength to resist. This may be a selfish request, but please end it as cleanly as possible.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;...... Cleanly as possible? Look...... You seem to know something about me, but aren&#39;t you making a big mistake here? I&#39;m no killer out for blood. Even if you asked me I wouldn&#39;t kill you.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Not... a killer?&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Yeah. I&#39;m not going to hit someone while they&#39;re down. I don&#39;t have a quarrel with you so there&#39;s no need to take it all the way. If you promise you won&#39;t attack me I&#39;ll let you go. \u2500\u2500You don&#39;t look like a vampire anyway.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;...... This is troubling. I may keep quiet, but I will not lie. Therefore I can&#39;t promise not to attack you again.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Eh? ...... You can&#39;t... then you mean... um...&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;That&#39;s right. Once my wounds heal, I will bind you.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500&quot;</p><hr><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;If you don&#39;t like it, then you just have to kill me. For someone like you it would be very easy.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;......... Idiot, what do you mean, easy?&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Eh? Did you say something, Tohno Shiki?&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Yeah, I said something. I was complaining about being involved in something weird again! ...... For crying out loud, if it&#39;s not one thing it&#39;s another\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500&quot;</p><hr><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500I cannot understand. This seems to be causing you pain.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;You&#39;re the one who isn&#39;t understandable. But you don&#39;t look like you&#39;ll go back on your word.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Yes. As long as I am not mistaken, I will not change.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;I see. Your expression speaks for you. (Why do I only meet these kinds of people?)&quot;</p><hr><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Well, anyway...... Um, can you tell me about your situation? You&#39;ve been telling me what to do, so maybe you can at least tell me why?&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;...... My situation ... You mean my purpose here?&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Yeah. For some reason, you don&#39;t seem like a bad person. If you could tell me about your situation, I&#39;ll listen... Um, I&#39;m also kind of curious why you attacked me.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;...... I understand. I was told you were not a bad person, and this confirms it. I should have explained the circumstances from the very start, Tohno Shiki.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;?&quot;</p><hr><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;My goal is to find a cure for vampirism. I have been researching a way to return humans bitten by a vampire back to normal.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;A cure for vampirism......?&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Yes. As you know someone who became no longer human after being bitten by a vampire, you can understand, right? The result of someone being desecrated by a vampire is death. Of course, we know how a human could become a vampire, but we don&#39;t know if a vampire could return to being a human. Many magi have attempted to research this problem and failed, but I do not intend to. I will make the impossible possible. That is what Atlasia means.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;...............&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Tohno Shiki, I believe you can understand how I feel. Like me, you have seen a friend become a vampire before your eyes.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500You seem to know a lot about that.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Ah...... That was inconsiderate of me. This is upsetting you.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;...... No, it&#39;s okay. I&#39;m just being childish.&quot;</p><hr><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;I understand what you&#39;re saying. You want to find a cure for vampirism\u2500\u2500I can&#39;t hate you for something like that.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;But why did you attack me? I&#39;m not turning into a vampire, and I don&#39;t know a lot about them, either.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Of course. I did not come here to make you a research specimen. I came to this country to ask the cooperation of the True Ancestor.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Eh\u2500\u2500\u2500True Ancestor, as in Arcueid?&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Yes. If I want to find a cure for vampirism I have to study the source of Dead Apostles, a True Ancestor. If I merely needed data on the Dead Apostles, The Church has compiled much of that. However, that is insufficient. I need to investigate an unaltered True Ancestor.&quot;</p><hr><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;...... I see. But I&#39;m not sure Arcueid would go for that. She&#39;s kind of fickle that way.</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;I know that. A noble True Ancestor would not grant the request of a mere mortal. I need you to negotiate for me.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Me? Negotiate?&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;(Nod)&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Idio-That&#39;s not going to work! You think she&#39;d listen to me? Where&#39;d you get an idea like that!?&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;W-well, you... the True Ancestor... aren&#39;t the two of you... l-l-lovers?&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500&quot;</p><hr><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;With you as a mediator, perhaps I could speak with her a little. That is why I wanted to secure you first...... This is all the result of my carelessness.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Wha...... carelessness? You mean before?&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Yes. I drew in all your data. The numbers indicated we were evenly matched, but my thorough knowledge meant my chances of winning were high. However, my loss means my abilities were the slightest fraction lower.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;......? Um, then that isn&#39;t being careless...... doesn&#39;t that just mean your fighting ability is\u2500\u2500\u2500&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Wha, what are you sayinggg! I only lost because of carelessness! Excessive carelessness! My performance was far below my standard! I admit I miscalculated your power, but under normal circumstances, I would be the victor! You see, an hour ago, I calculated every single one of your maneuvers. Doesn&#39;t this just mean my evasion rate data was off by less than 0.5%!? If not for that one small mistake, our positions would have been completely reversed! Can you not understand such a simple thing!?&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Eh\u2500\u2500\u2500right. Sorry I doubted you.&quot;</p><hr><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Ah...... no, I was being a little rude. I would appreciate it if we just changed the subject.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;(......Hmm. She seems totally different from before.)</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;To get back to your problem, you really just want me to bring Arcueid to you?&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Yes. My intent was to formally request the True Ancestor&#39;s cooperation.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;I see. So you won&#39;t give up even now? ...... Okay...... if that&#39;s the case, oh well.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;? Oh well? What do you mean?&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;I mean, I can act as a middle man between you and Arcueid. ...... In all likelihood she&#39;s going to say no, but you wouldn&#39;t give up unless we tried, right?&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;(Nod)&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;C&#39;mon, it&#39;s just asking for cooperation, right? So, I&#39;ll lend you a hand. To be honest, I&#39;d like to cheer on someone doing your kind of research.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Eh......... cheer... on......?&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Yeah. Suddenly attacking me out of nowhere was surprising, but we can call it even. ...... If your research is successful, I feel like\u2500\u2500\u2500I could finally help her.&quot;</p><hr><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;..................&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;I&#39;ll do something about Arcueid. Actually, I&#39;m looking for her right now. I figured she would know something about these disturbances happening. I went to her place, but\u2500\u2500\u2500&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;So she has concealed her location.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Yeah. And by patrolling the town, I thought I&#39;d find the rumored vampire, or at least Her Highness the fickle princess.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;...... I understand. Then I can lend you a hand in your purpose. If you&#39;re tracking down the rumors, I can find the vampire more quickly than you can.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Eh? Really?&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Yes, if the rumored vampire does exist. Data gathering is my specialty. If I have at least a backup, I can scan the minds of everyone in this town in one day.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;\u2500\u2500\u2500Hmm, I don&#39;t really quite understand, but you don&#39;t have to go that far, do you?&quot; (...... She has a scary look in her eyes.)</p><hr><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;But, yeah. I&#39;d appreciate any help. I was feeling kind of hopeless by myself.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Then I will chase down these rumors. And you?&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;It&#39;s alright if I look for Arcueid and bring her to you isn&#39;t it? But, there&#39;s one other thing before that.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Before that?&quot;</p><hr><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;It&#39;s Sion, right? If we&#39;re going to be partners, we should call each other by our first names, shouldn&#39;t we?&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;You have a point. Very well. You may call me Sion. And you\u2500\u2500\u2500&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Ah, Shiki&#39;s fine.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;...... Shi-Shiki.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Yeah. That&#39;s much better, isn&#39;t it?&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;...... Shiki...&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Yeah.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Shiki.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Yeah, I said that&#39;s fine.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;..........................................&quot;</p><hr><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;............... Then I will go start gathering information on the vampire. Please prepare for the negotiations with the True Ancestor, Shiki.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Yeah. But we don&#39;t have to go right away, you know.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;That would be the best, I think. We&#39;ll both need some time. Let&#39;s meet again tomorrow night right here, in front of this building.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Okay. I think I can manage something by then.&quot;</p><hr><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Shiki. Can you... hold on for a minute?&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Eh......? Did I have something on my head?&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;...... Something like that. Well then, see you tomorrow night.&quot;</p><hr><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Yeah, see you tomorrow\u2500\u2500\u2500Hm. This seems a little familiar.

You are right on time, Shiki.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Same for you. A big difference from someone I know.&quot;</p><p>...... Actually, she would come extremely early and then go hide.</p><hr><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Shiki. How did things turn out with the True Ancestor?&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Well, it can be pretty hard to get hold of her sometimes. But I left a note in her room. Maybe tomorrow will be different...&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Is that so? So she covers her tracks well. This won&#39;t be easy.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Right, right. As fickle as she is, she might just have decided to go off and play around for a while without even knowing what&#39;s going on.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Perhaps. Do you not think she left you intentionally, Shiki?&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;\u2500\u2500\u2500Intentionally? What do you mean, Sion?&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;I mean that the returned vampire could possibly be the True Ancestor.&quot;</p><p>Shiki:&quot;That&#39;s impossible. Arcueid would never do the kinds of things they&#39;re talking about.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;...... Never? You really are a wonderful person, denying it so completely like that, Shiki.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Er, well, thanks...&quot;</p><p>I stammer a reply.</p><p>For some reason, her words don&#39;t seem sarcastic, and almost have a ring of admiration to them.</p><hr><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;A-anyway, Arcueid doesn&#39;t drink human blood. You might not know that, Sion, but she\u2500\u2500\u2500&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;She isn&#39;t the vampire in the rumors, right? If you say so.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;However, if the vampire has returned to this town, then isn&#39;t it strange that there is no other vampire around besides the True Ancestor? There has to be something which was a model for all these rumors.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;A model for the rumors......? Wouldn&#39;t that be the incident from a year ago?&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;That isn&#39;t the model, but the source. The rumors have been very clear about that. No one has actually seen or heard anything themselves. Putting aside what is true or false, does there not have to be some &#39;shadowy figure wandering the night&#39; on which to base these rumors?&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;......?&quot;</p><p>Sion is a little hard to follow. No, in the first place\u2500\u2500\u2500</p><hr><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Sion, I&#39;ve been wondering. You talk about research and studying vampires... who exactly are you?&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;I am an alchemist. You know about magi, do you not? The one named Ciel belongs to The Church, but there is another organization called the Mage&#39;s Association.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;I am a member of the Mage&#39;s Association. There are three separate branches. I belong to Atlas.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;The Church views vampires as their enemy, but they have an agreement with us, the Mage&#39;s Association. ...... You could say we&#39;re a military force that isn&#39;t black, but not white either.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;...... Mage&#39;s Association......&quot;</p><p>...... Hmm. If that&#39;s the case then maybe Sensei is also in this Association.</p><p>Maybe Sion even knows her.</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;I do not. Your Sensei is London&#39;s problem child, so it is natural for a member of Atlas like me to not have met her.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;W-what did you say, Sion? How did you...&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;I can tell what you&#39;re thinking. You&#39;re someone whose face is easily read.&quot;</p><p>...... Hmph.</p><p>I&#39;m used to Akiha and the others saying that, but it is a bit of a shock to hear it from Sion, whom I&#39;ve just met.</p><hr><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;...... Whatever. Then what do we do from here? It isn&#39;t fair if you don&#39;t tell me the results on all the information you gathered before.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;I don&#39;t mind. But what I gathered was not really any different than the rumors you heard. So I have nothing to tell you.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;My. That&#39;s a little troubling.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Isn&#39;t it? So now we will just have to confirm it with our own eyes after all. If we&#39;re going to find the rumored vampire and the source behind it, we have to search the city at night.&quot;</p><p>...... So we&#39;re back to that. I didn&#39;t expect anything better.</p><p>This reminds me more and more of what happened last year.</p><hr><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;So...... This is my plan, Shiki. Why don&#39;t we look together? I don&#39;t know this town very well. I would be wasting my time without a guide.</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Eh? ...... Well, they say two heads are better than one but is it alright? Your purpose is to research vampires, so......&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;We cannot declare for certain the source of these rumors isn&#39;t the True Ancestor, correct? Reason stands that if we fulfill your goal, it would be easier to find the True Ancestor. It would be meaningless if only I found the True Ancestor, and you would become free much quicker. I think that goes without saying.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500&quot;</p><p>I see, that&#39;s what she&#39;s thinking.</p><p>Well, we&#39;ll see, I guess.</p><hr><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Alright. Give-and-take, then.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Yes. As much as I can, I will help you with your agenda.&quot;</p><hr><h4 id="park" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#park" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Park</h4><hr><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;We&#39;ve walked so far and still we haven&#39;t found anything. The town is strangely quiet, but there&#39;s no odd feeling to the air.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;We haven&#39;t gone into the areas mentioned in the rumors. I hate to say this, but more victims will appear as time passes.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Huh?

Sen, pai......?&quot;</p><p><strong>Ciel</strong>: &quot;Tohno-kun......!? Wh-why are you with her\u2500\u2500&quot;</p><p><strong>Ciel</strong>: &quot;\u2500\u2500Sion Eltnam. Don&#39;t tell me, you...&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;I think you misunderstand, agent. I asked for Shiki&#39;s help, so he accompanied me.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;No one forced him. As for what you&#39;re thinking about, no.&quot;</p><p><strong>Ciel</strong>: &quot;...... Is that so? So he has nothing to do with you, then. So you won&#39;t ask for his help when we fight.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500&quot;</p><hr><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Se, Senpai, hold on! This may look like something is going on, but you don&#39;t have to bring out your Black Keys like that all of a sudden.&quot;</p><p><strong>Ciel</strong>: &quot;Tohno-kun please be quiet! ...... Goodness, why do you always show up in these bothersome situations? Or is it that you can&#39;t resist the request of a cute girl?&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;T-that&#39;s definitely not it!&quot;</p><p><strong>Ciel</strong>: &quot;At any rate, stand aside, Tohno-kun. I will not listen any longer. If you get in my way, prepare to be punished.&quot;</p><p><strong>Ciel</strong>: &quot;Sion Eltnam Atlasia. An order has been issued by The Church to take you into protective custody, or failing that, to capture you by any means necessary. A similar request has been issued by the Atlas Institute. Do you have anything to say in your defense?&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;\u2500\u2500I have nothing to say. But I will not let you capture me. If you try, you will be destroyed.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Yeah, saying that all of a sudden is a little\u2500\u2500 W-wait, Sion... What did you just say!?&quot;</p><p><strong>Ciel</strong>: &quot;You will not comply with The Church&#39;s orders? Very well, then. As an agent of The Church, I am placing you under arrest.&quot;</p><p><strong>Ciel</strong>: &quot;I will make you reflect on your actions. Your partner will also have quite the painful experience.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Uwaaa!

Furthermore, since he is helping you, it would be best to let sleeping dogs lie.&quot;</p><p><strong>Ciel</strong>: &quot;Sion Eltnam Atlasia, I entrust your monitoring to him now. Your involvement in this is disturbing, but it is foolish for me to be distracted from my main task.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;That&#39;s a strange thing to say. Shiki and I are partners. He doesn&#39;t mind my involvement.&quot;</p><p><strong>Ciel</strong>: &quot;Yes, you may be right, you may be right. He is nice to everyone, so I will not get in the way. But no matter what, you will not be able to do anything bad when you are with him. You&#39;d best keep that in mind.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;?&quot;</p><hr><p><strong>Ciel</strong>: &quot;\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500Tohno\u2212kun.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Y\u2212yes! ...... What is it, Senpai?&quot;</p><p><strong>Ciel</strong>: &quot;You don&#39;t have to be so apprehensive. Since you chose to associate with her, you will have to supervise her until the very end. You can&#39;t leave her alone half\u2212way through.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Me, supervise Sion?&quot;</p><p><strong>Ciel</strong>: &quot;Yes. Since she is investigating vampires, she will need your protection. I will not be able to help you until I have killed the Dead Apostle, so you have to protect her until then.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Until you kill the Dead Apostle...... wait, are you looking for the vampire from the rumors, too?&quot;</p><p><strong>Ciel</strong>: &quot;Of course. I am on formal orders from The Church and a powerful Dead Apostle is hiding somewhere in town. So I ask you to not do anything foolish, Tohno\u2212kun.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;...... If The Church is involved...... then, that\u2500\u2500must have already begun......&quot;</p><p><strong>Ciel</strong>: &quot;Just as you say, Sion Eltnam. I understand you feelings, but hunting Dead Apostles is the business of The Church. You should stay out of it.&quot;</p><hr><p><strong>Ciel</strong>: &quot;...... And as for apprehending you, that is the duty of the Mage&#39;s Association. For me, everything else is secondary to the hunt for Dead Apostles.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;I am... being overlooked?&quot;</p><p><strong>Ciel</strong>: &quot;Of course not. Because as soon as the Dead Apostle hiding in this town is disposed of, you will definitely be of top priority.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;You are saying I should leave Japan then, agent? ...... I&#39;m surprised you would be so soft. I heard from the Knights that the Burial Agency was one of the most bloodthirsty groups of killers around. Was that information wrong?&quot;</p><p><strong>Ciel</strong>: &quot;No, they were right. I just don&#39;t feel good tonight.&quot;</p><p><strong>Ciel</strong>: &quot;Even if I am part of the Burial Agency, I am still human. ......

All we did was simply push back dealing with the problem until later in the future. And Sion... we really did just make Senpai really angry......)</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Hm, let&#39;s not think about the unpleasant future right now. More importantly, what was that thing Senpai was saying earlier?&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Thing? What do you mean, &#39;thing&#39;?&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;The thing about the order to arrest you! And then protective custody and...... well, maybe that&#39;s not so bad, but the &#39;capture by any means&#39; part is a little much, isn&#39;t it? You told me you were a Mage from Atlas, but you never said you were on some wanted list.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Of course not. I felt no need to speak of it.&quot;</p><hr><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Y\u2212you felt no need? You don&#39;t just hide something like that!&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Shiki, please stop yelling so much. You are drawing attention.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;But, it certainly was a mistake on my part. I did not think even The Church was searching for me. It seems the Mage&#39;s Association is really intent on returning me.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;...... Alright, I can accept that. But what in the world did you do? For Senpai to really attack someone like that is rare\u2500\u2500&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;\u2500\u2500Um, I mean it doesn&#39;t happen often. Are you sure you didn&#39;t do something to make her angry, Sion? If so, it would be troublesome if you didn&#39;t tell me, you know.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Troublesome......? Shiki, why?&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;If we&#39;re going to work together, we have to have an understanding between us. ...... We&#39;ve got to be able to rely on each other. There can&#39;t be any more secrets.&quot;</p><hr><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Is that... part of being a partner?&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Yeah. That&#39;s really important between partners.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Sion?&quot;</p><hr><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;...... Shiki. Atlas is hunting me because I turned my back on their doctrine. Objectively, I have not done anything wrong. You are not an accomplice, so there is no need to worry.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Eh? Uh, no, I wasn&#39;t asking if you did something wrong. I was just wondering why Senpai was after you?&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Please believe me. I didn&#39;t do anything for you to despise me.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Yeah, I believe you.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;... Thank you. I appreciate that.&quot;</p><hr><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Let me explain the rest. The Mage&#39;s Association I come from is the Atlas Academy. There is one overall Mage&#39;s Association, but different places have different academies.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;I know. The largest Mage&#39;s Association is in London. Senpai said that earlier.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;That is the &#39;Clock Tower&#39;, hidden within the very famous British Museum. They are one of the most respected associations. Many magi try to imitate their stances.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;But I am from a place far away from there, an alchemist of Atlas in Egypt. Other academies encourage learning and experimentation in a wide variety of disciplines. In Atlas, there is only one path, and those who venture off it are severely punished.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Severely punished... Sion, don&#39;t tell me\u2212&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Yes. I broke their one commandment. Atlas strictly forbids the dissemination of knowledge, but I traveled to other academies and exchanged information with their researchers.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;You mean, you traded away secrets from this place Atlas?&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;No. I would never reveal Atlas&#39;s own secrets. The information I traded was the fruits of my own personal research.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Well, they shouldn&#39;t have gotten angry about it if it was just your own work.&quot;</p><hr><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Atlas does not see it that way. They believe that the results of one&#39;s own work should be revealed only to oneself. That is their absolute law, and consequently, they view my actions as a serious transgression.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Perhaps it is very unbecoming for an alchemist. But getting answers to my questions was more important to me than Atlas&#39;s restrictions.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Answers to your questions about a cure for vampirism?&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;...... Yes, exactly. Questions about the Dead Apostles, the thought process of those humans who sought immortality, the underlying fate of those humans avoiding such a contradiction... what drives them...... why I carry such doubt within me... those are my chains.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;? Um, sorry, but could you be a little more clear? Your explanation is a little (extremely) hard to follow.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;......! Well excuse me, your inability to comprehend things is really something! Just dumbing down my words to meet your vocabulary takes forever, now you want me to somehow match everything to your limited intelligence!? No, in the first place, my explanation was not lacking. The only thing lacking here is your ability to understand anything!&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500&quot;</p><hr><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;A\u2212anyway, the point of my crimes was to find a cure for vampirism! Don&#39;t you want that, too!?&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Well sure, that would be great. But Sion, you...&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;What, what is it Shiki?&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;It&#39;s not a question of your motives. Didn&#39;t Senpai say you had a connection to this vampire mess?&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Of course, I am entrusted to gathering information for you.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;.....................&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: <em>Stares</em></p><hr><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;I\u2212I don&#39;t know. I don&#39;t have any connection to it! Why is it so hard to believe that I don&#39;t have any connection to this trivial, inconsequential vampire affair in such a Far East country like this!?&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Wow. &#39;Trivial&#39; is pretty harsh, isn&#39;t it?&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Ah, no, that isn&#39;t what I meant. I mean at its current stage it is trivial! These rumors have not been verified, nor have there been any victims, right? In other words, it will be serious once real victims turn up.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Hm, uh\u2212huh. Just some rumors, it really is pretty trivial. Haha, maybe I was a little stupid to investigate it just because it seemed interesting\u2500&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;You&#39;ve got it all wrong! &#39;Trivial&#39; isn&#39;t the right word. We will be lucky to end this before victims do appear. Look, Shiki, you can&#39;t just ignore the rumors that a vampire has reappeared in town\u2500\u2500&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Don&#39;t ignore the rumors, Sion? I thought you came here to see Arcueid, not because of those rumors.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;......! D\u2212didn&#39;t I say that before? I\u2212I came to this town to meet with the True Ancestor. And then a totally unrelated Dead Apostle just started to appear here!&quot;</p><hr><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;..................................................Well, whatever.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;What do you mean by &#39;whatever&#39;, Shiki?&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;You have your secrets, but I can see you&#39;re not really a bad person.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;...... You can&#39;t understand anything at all. As a matter of fact, you really get on my nerves. Shiki, I really do want to explain it all to you, but\u2500&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;No, it&#39;s alright. I think I understand your situation better now, so we can just end it here.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;More importantly, it&#39;s almost sunrise. The sun will be up soon. The vampire only comes out at night, you know.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Shiki, your family will be up soon, right? It would be meaningless to continue our search any longer.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;...... Hey, Sion. How do you know that much about me?&quot;</p><hr><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Because your thoughts are very strong. &#39;I don&#39;t want Akiha to find out about my night patrols,&#39; is your highest priority.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Akiha is very important to you, but you&#39;re a little scared of her, aren&#39;t you? You seem to think about her a lot. If you think about her so much, I wonder what kind of person she is?&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Um, let&#39;s just stop here.&quot; (Please, stop)</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;At any rate, let&#39;s go our separate ways for now. We can meet again tomorrow night at the same place. We might be able to catch Arcueid next time.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500Eh?&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;And it would be better if you hid yourself in daytime. Despite what Senpai said, she may just come looking for you if you are alone.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500I was, going to do that, um...&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;See you later then! Meet you at the usual place tomorrow night!&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 ...... Troubling. How can he just trust me so completely like that?&quot;</p><hr><p>...... I&#39;m dreaming.</p><p>For me it is a waste of time...</p><p>Even if sleep is necessary for resting the brain, to have to see these pointless thoughts...</p><p>Probably because my body is weakening.</p><p>I can&#39;t control it.</p><p>...... Isn&#39;t this a contradiction?</p><p>If I am so exhausted, I should be too tired for dreams.</p><p>All the same, why is it that I bring up these meaningless thoughts?</p><hr><p>The name Eltnam. Something of a scar on the face of Atlas.</p><p>Awe. Loathing. Avoidance. Criminal.</p><p>No one said that, but that&#39;s how I was viewed.</p><p>A family known for their long devotion to alchemy.</p><p>Once considered distinguished nobility, respected figures who commanded great influence.</p><p>When did that all change?</p><hr><p>I shared information.</p><p>My father did the same. And his father, and his father before him.</p><p>That is how we increase our knowledge.</p><p>Those of Eltnam do not take their knowledge from books, but from other humans.</p><hr><p>That is the result of a rational pursuit of knowledge.</p><p>If you want to know something, you don&#39;t necessarily have to study just that one thing.</p><p>It is more efficient to copy the knowledge of someone who has studied it and more. Then you will have the whole of his knowledge, not just one piece of it.</p><p>So thought our ancestors, who created the means by which we can read data directly from the human mind.</p><p>Using the Etherlite, the artificial nervous system constructed of ether, hacking into the soul is possible.</p><hr><p>When the Etherlite touches another human being, it merges with their nervous system and links their mind with that of the user.</p><p>You might say it takes over that person&#39;s hardware.</p><p>Thought directs the body; and ordinarily, the brain is its only control center.</p><p>The Etherlite hacks into this process and becomes a second control center, sabotaging the original. It hacks orders to the body, which believes they came from its own brain.</p><p>The Etherlite penetrates to the deepest level.</p><p>From the brain, it takes information.</p><p>It creates a blueprint of the soul from which thought processes are derived.</p><hr><p>Of course, to completely seize someone requires the breach of reason, instinct...... thousands of barriers.</p><p>It truly is a talent.</p><p>With this ability to invade the information of others, the House of Eltnam can overcome any obstacle with ease.</p><p>The target has no choice but to yield their knowledge.</p><p>Other powerful methods of collecting a person&#39;s knowledge; drugs, the hypnotic gaze of a vampire... those methods can damage the information so that perfect playback is impossible.</p><p>Certainly, they damage the target itself.</p><hr><p>But our method is different.</p><p>Our way does not leave a scar in the mind. Thoughts are invaded, downloaded, and even rewritten without the person being aware.</p><p>Even morally bankrupt alchemists consider this heresy.</p><p>So Eltnam kept its great power a close secret.</p><hr><p>...... But even close secrets inevitably become open ones.</p><p>By the time I was born, the Eltnam name was no longer a distinguished one.</p><p>Three generations ago our secret was discovered, and we were estranged from Atlas for violating its rules.</p><p>I suspect the other alchemists were also afraid of our methods.</p><hr><p>In that way, people distanced themselves from the Eltnam.</p><p>But that is not necessarily a bad thing.</p><p>My grandfather, my father, and I did not receive the kind of persecution that might otherwise have been expected.</p><p>Our methods are rational ones, no matter how feared and disliked they may be right now.</p><p>No alchemist could deny our accomplishments or our power, nor could they surpass us.</p><p>So instead they attempted to ignore us.</p><p>We could not be penalized.</p><p>So we were treated as if we did not exist.</p><p>In the pit that was the Atlas Academy.</p><p>The House of Eltnam resided in the deepest darkness.</p><hr><p>But even that was not a problem.</p><p>Others may view us as fallen, but the pride of Eltnam never wavered.</p><p>I worked hard as a proud daughter of Eltnam.</p><p>Truly.</p><p>I was superior.</p><p>Despite my past, I would soon return and demonstrate my abilities.</p><hr><p>...... No, not a problem at all.</p><p>All those who could not oppose me, could only ignore me.</p><p>And I, who possessed abilities worthy of the name Eltnam.</p><p>There were no doubts about my future.</p><p>None at all.</p><p>No reason for doubt anywhere.</p><hr><p>But...</p><p>I was a slave to my doubts.</p><p>What kind of doubts?

You look like you&#39;ve overdone it...&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;No need to worry. Management of one&#39;s own body is a basic skill for alchemists. More importantly, how about the True Ancestor, Shiki?&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Ah, about that. I couldn&#39;t catch her today, either. I think she may be deliberately avoiding me.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;You may be right. Maybe she is trying to act like some kind of a perfect honor student, just like that agent yesterday.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Heh. No way, that&#39;s not Arcueid at all. She is probably just concerned about me.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;...... Indeed. The workings of the heart are truly foolish, aren&#39;t they?&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Just as well. So no results today, either.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Well, I wouldn&#39;t go that far. I did leave a note in her room. &#39;I have something important to tell you. You know what I&#39;ve been doing, so come to the park after midnight. If you don&#39;t come, I won&#39;t make breakfast for you anymore!&#39;&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;...... Shiki. Do you really think the True Ancestor will take that seriously?&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Oh, she will. A while ago she and Akiha got in a big fight. However it looked, Arcueid was the one at fault and I told her to apologize.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Of course Arcueid said there was no reason to, but as soon as I threatened to stop cooking her breakfast, she apologized to Akiha properly. That is the best bargaining tactic with her.&quot;</p><hr><p>I puff my chest out confidently.</p><p>Sion stares at me in amazement.</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;I see.

You have some business with me?&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Yes. My name is Sion Eltnam Atlasia. As an alchemist, I seek your cooperation for a great undertaking, Princess of the True Ancestors.&quot;</p><p><strong>Arcueid</strong>: &quot;Cooperate with me? How rare for someone outside The Church to say that. ...... Fine, let&#39;s hear it. I&#39;ll listen if you don&#39;t bore me.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;...... Yes. I am researching the process of vampirism. Those who had their blood drank by True Ancestors and became Dead Apostles. Against this one\u2212way process I\u2212&quot;</p><p><strong>Arcueid</strong>: &quot;Hmm? Then, you mean...&quot;</p><hr><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Yes, nothing short of curing vampirism. There is some abnormality in your kind&#39;s blood that causes humans to change. If so, then there has to be something which could cause them to turn back. For that, I need the blood of an original True Ancestor\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500&quot;</p><p><strong>Arcueid</strong>: &quot;Oh, that? No, no way. That&#39;s boring, so we&#39;ll just stop here.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;......! You can&#39;t just dismiss that as boring.

You two may have teamed up or something, but that doesn&#39;t mean you can beat me.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Agh......&quot;</p><p><strong>Arcueid</strong>: &quot;Goodness. The fact that you take her side really ticks me off. Right when I shouldn&#39;t be wasting even a little of my strength.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Wha...... waste... your strength?&quot;</p><p><strong>Arcueid</strong>: &quot;Yes. If that thing keeps running around loose it&#39;ll be quite an eyesore, won&#39;t it? Even if it is just like a mere insect buzzing around, it&#39;s still a bother.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;...... Unbelievable. You know what it&#39;s true form is?&quot;</p><p><strong>Arcueid</strong>: &quot;Of course. I was going to clean up the mess by myself. Shiki is too easily deceived, so I couldn&#39;t just let him fight that pathological liar.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;......?&quot;</p><p><strong>Arcueid</strong>: &quot;So, Shiki. Why the heck did you call me and then show up with that woman? ...... Don&#39;t tell me you&#39;re actually the fake?&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Fake... Isn&#39;t that my line? What&#39;s that mountain of dead bodies then? What about you, are you really Arcueid?&quot;</p><p><strong>Arcueid</strong>: &quot;That wasn&#39;t me. You did it before you came here.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Eh......? I, I did it......?&quot;</p><hr><p><strong>Arcueid</strong>: &quot;Yeah. Although when I watched it, you looked a little fake. ...... In any case, it seems like we all have been influenced by that thing. If you don&#39;t watch out, you just might turn into a true killer.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Turn into a true killer? ...... You mean, um...... what do you mean?&quot;</p><p><strong>Arcueid</strong>: &quot;The realization of anxiety. You were the one who stacked this pile of dead bodies. Isn&#39;t Ciel looking for you right now? ...... Although in the first place, you can&#39;t really call this murder.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Stup\u2500\u2500what are you doing, Arcueid! It&#39;s already too late, stop kicking those bodies around like that!&quot;</p><p><strong>Arcueid</strong>: &quot;Oh Shiki, you&#39;re still tricked. Just take a closer look at all this, won&#39;t you?&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;A closer look, you...... huh? What is this? ...... Just some scraps of food and trash?&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Huh? Huhhhhh!? What is this!? I swear there were bloody corpses right here...... !?&quot;</p><p><strong>Arcueid</strong>: &quot;See? You were deceived. Shiki, you&#39;ve had some very bad experiences so you are more likely to make this stuff real.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;......... Is it okay if I ask a question, Arcueid?&quot;</p><p><strong>Arcueid</strong>: &quot;Yeah, sure.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;...... Um, what&#39;s going on?&quot;</p><p><strong>Arcueid</strong>: &quot;Isn&#39;t it obvious? A pile of trash you mistook for a mountain of bodies. The work of a killer\u2500\u2500\u2500no, a vampire.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;A vampire? The model for all of these rumors around town? Ciel\u2212Senpai was looking, but I should&#39;ve known you would be too.&quot;</p><p><strong>Arcueid</strong>: &quot;What&#39;s this? You already spoke with Ciel? ...... That&#39;s strange, then even if it does appear it may not be a bad time......&quot;</p><hr><p><strong>Arcueid</strong>: &quot;Oh, I see. Because I&#39;m here it hasn&#39;t decided on a form yet. ...... That idiot. So greedy, yet it can only end in self\u2212destruction.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;...... Arcueid. You&#39;re the only one understanding everything... can&#39;t you just help me out a little?&quot;</p><p><strong>Arcueid</strong>: &quot;That girl over there has all the details. I can&#39;t really explain about the Dead Apostle this time, and isn&#39;t better to hear from somebody involved in all this?&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Involved... you mean Sion?&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;..................&quot;</p><p><strong>Arcueid</strong>: &quot;Exactly. You know, I really want to kill her, but you would probably get in the way, right?&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Are you stupid? Of course I would. What&#39;s with this crazy merciless attitude all of a sudden?&quot;</p><p><strong>Arcueid</strong>: &quot;Hey. I said I&#39;m letting you go, Alchemist. Until I&#39;ve confirmed the strength of this vampire, I won&#39;t be wasting any of my power.&quot;</p><hr><h2 id="distant-farewell" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#distant-farewell" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Distant Farewell</h2><h3 id="stardust" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#stardust" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Stardust</h3><hr><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;About what Arcueid said earlier...&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;............&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;When Arcueid said you were involved, what was she talking about?&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;..................&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Sion, you said you didn&#39;t know much about what was happening, but you really do, don&#39;t you? I don&#39;t know why you were hiding it, but......&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;I was not hiding it. It was the truth that I only knew as much as you did about the rumors.&quot;</p><hr><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;...... But, yes. I do know more than you do about the Dead Apostle hiding in this town.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;I knew you&#39;d be difficult. If you knew about it how come you kept quiet?&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Because you were just looking for the rumored vampire. For example, it would be like just buying medicine whenever you were sick. You didn&#39;t buy the medicine because you wanted to find out what was in it, right? So it was meaningless to explain everything about that Dead Apostle.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;...... Hey, there IS a meaning to it. If you don&#39;t know your opponent, you won&#39;t know how to counter him. He&#39;s just a rumor after all, so we don&#39;t know if he&#39;s really that bad. And if we can resolve this by talking it&#39;ll be much better.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;How laid back. If you think you can talk with it then you are so wrong it gives me the chills.&quot;</p><hr><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;...... This is against my better judgment, but consider it a reward for agreeing to help me. Right now you seem to simply want peace with that vampire. But if you die on me because of it, my ability to finish this may be in question.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Shiki. The source of the rumors in town, the Dead Apostle that the True Ancestor and the agent of The Church are searching for is the one called &#39;Tatari&#39;.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Tatari......? You mean, like a curse?&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Yes, the etymology derives from this country&#39;s word for &#39;curse&#39;. The Dead Apostle Tatari is a vampire lacking independent individuality. It pieces together anxiety from the bits of rumors to appear real and feeds in cycles.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;A rumor that appears real and feeds in cycles?&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Yes. A criminal that revels in the reactions of others to its deeds. Dead Apostles are normally not content with simply drinking blood as the years pass. They make their own rules and take pleasure not only in drinking blood, but in protecting those rules.&quot;</p><hr><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;To make matters worse, Tatari has the ability to gather up rumors. Similar to the True Ancestor&#39;s Marble Phantasm, Tatari is able to materialize the imagination of humans. So the more uneasy humans are and the more bad rumors spread, the more its power grows.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;...... Hey. Then... you mean in the absence of bad rumors he can&#39;t exist?&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Yes, a curse&#39;s strength is extreme anxiety, and operating on this principle, it can transform general rumors into reality. That which is called Tatari truly does have the ability to materialize rumors. It is one kind of what we call a Reality Marble. Strong Dead Apostles are able to create within themselves a differing reality from the outside world. This Reality Marble is a separate world created from one&#39;s imagination. Usually its form is constantly fixed, but Tatari&#39;s Reality Marble is something which &#39;takes form from nearby humans&#39;. Because of that, the contents of the Reality Marble are separate from that of the world around it.&quot;</p><hr><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Reality Marbles are also very short\u2212lived. No matter how strong a Dead Apostle is, he can not maintain one for more than a single night.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;...... A single night is the limit...... Is that why the rumors of the killer are only at night?&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;No, Tatari has not yet occurred. In order to take form, the rumors must spread through town in order to increase their probability. Right now, Tatari is only a rumor. But just rumors cannot kill anyone in reality, right?&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Tatari is spreading roots through this town, permeating it with unpleasant rumors. As time passes, the rumors start to turn to reality and it can occur due to the bizarre circumstances. ...... That means the likelihood of a true killer or vampire serving as a model is high. In any case, thanks to all of those incidents which occurred before, I think it is only natural for the people of this town to feel uneasy about it.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;\u2500\u2500Oh? In other words, this Dead Apostle named Tatari hasn&#39;t drunk blood in this town yet and he has to wait until the rumors become closer to reality before he can?&quot;</p><hr><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;To put it succinctly, yes. For Tatari, the town in which he appears is only one stage and the audience has just arrived. Their imaginations fuel the play, and when the seats are filled\u2500\u2500&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Tatari appears. \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500The curtain rises?&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Yes, for one night. In the past, Tatari would claim victim after victim in the town in which he occurred until it was morning. At times, it would be given to preying on everyone in the whole town. At any rate, he was the &quot;unpleasant rumor&quot; everyone in town believed in. Humans cannot fight back against their own nightmares, their worst fears given shape. Because they cannot fight back, it truly is a nightmare. And\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;...... Once the curse begins, there&#39;s no stopping it?&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Correct. And you are also part of the audience. No, you might just be the guest of honor. There is a high possibility whatever unpleasantness you think of will become Tatari.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Eh? Wh\u2212why me?&quot;</p><hr><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;You are the human most tied to the True Ancestor. You are the one receiving the True Ancestor&#39;s...... favor, so this town is considered quite desirable for an appearance.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;The True Ancestor&#39;s favor......? If, if that&#39;s what you think, you&#39;re a little mistaken... but why would that make me such a desirable target?&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;You know the True Ancestor very well, right? If you think about it, it is very obvious. The absolute worst &#39;nightmare&#39; in this town would be a True Ancestor gone mad.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Eh\u2500\u2500Then, um...... if I get worried about Arcueid indiscriminately drinking blood, or think that Ciel\u2212senpai and Akiha getting in a fight would be bad, then......&quot;</p><hr><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Then the chances of that becoming reality is high. Curses work more on the principle of changing things which exist rather than creating something out of nothing. Please think of Tatari as a sort of Dead Apostle who uses &#39;curses&#39; as familiars. In this case, wouldn&#39;t it simply be easier for Tatari to take possession of the True Ancestor and start rampaging rather than truly becoming a rampaging True Ancestor? Consequently, your image of unpleasantness is much more clearly defined than anyone else&#39;s. Having seen so many real vampires, you provide a far more vivid image from which to construct a false one.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500Hey, wait a minute.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Then, if I imagine that guy, for instance...&quot;</p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/lwlc9Ur.png" alt="Nrvnqsr"></p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;If I get troubled thinking about that...&quot;</p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/8WmX4Hr.png" alt="Nanatsu Yoru"></p><hr><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500!&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Sion......?&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Ah...... oh, ghh\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500!&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Sion, what&#39;s wrong!? Are you hurt from your fight with Arcueid......!?&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;No\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500that is not, it.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;I just suddenly became nauseous, no need for concern. More importantly, Shiki, what are you going to do now?&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;......? Why do you ask that?&quot;</p><hr><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Our efforts to negotiate with the True Ancestor failed. But there still remains the possibility. Her top priority is dealing with Tatari, so we may still use it as a bargaining chip.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;In other words, there is no need for you to act as a mediator. You can just go back to\u2500\u2500&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Hm? Ah, in that case, then let&#39;s do it together. I&#39;m looking for the vampire anyway, and you have to do something about Tatari before you can talk with Arcueid.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;And we are partners after all. You&#39;re a help to me too.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;\u2500\u2500\u2500I am surprised. Shiki, you still intend to help me?&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;?&quot;</p><hr><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Well, I...... I do not have any more information for you. And\u2500\u2500\u2500I&#39;m still hiding so much.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Haven&#39;t you answered whatever I asked? If I don&#39;t understand anything, all I have to do is ask, right?&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Anyway, let&#39;s just roam around for a while.

Myself or even our Ancestors are but frail beings before an exception like you. Perhaps an irregularity like you can even summon the Princess and bestow upon me that form.&quot;</p><p><strong>Nrvnqsr</strong>: &quot;Very well. Being one of the 27 Dead Apostle Ancestors has lost its flavor. \u2500\u2500\u2500Being an original would be much more appropriate for my final form.&quot;</p><hr><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;\u2500\u2500\u2500I can&#39;t believe it.&quot;</p><p>Even if it is pointless, that statement escapes my lips.</p><p>The eyes of Tohno Shiki see Death.</p><p>Not the death of substance, but the death of meaning, of existence itself.</p><p>I knew that from reading his data.</p><p>But I didn&#39;t understand it.</p><hr><p>He truly is a God of Death.</p><hr><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;......

Yes, it is finished. You have destroyed the vampire you were looking for, Shiki.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;\u2500\u2500For real?&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Yes. Well done, Shiki. You destroyed Tatari before there were any victims.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500&quot;</p><hr><p>...... I lied.</p><p>With such an obvious lie, he might be able to tell.</p><p>But, he really has no way of denying it.</p><hr><p>I am his only source of information regarding Tatari.</p><p>If I say &quot;it is finished&quot;, then all he can do is nod.</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;I see. Got it.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Well then, what are you going to do, Sion? That Dead Apostle Tatari... he&#39;s gone now.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;As the True Ancestor will not cooperate with me, I have no need for this town, or for you. I will soon be leaving.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;? Is it really okay? About Arcueid?&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Yes. In the first place, I knew my chances of gaining her cooperation were low. Our negotiations failed, so there is no second time. Rather than waste time negotiating, it would be better for me to return to my research. That has always been my goal.&quot;</p><hr><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Oh.

Because the vampire causing disturbances in this town is now gone, our cooperative relationship is now finished.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Yeah, that&#39;s true.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Then, we will part here.

Until we both met our objectives, that we would cooperate? So, it&#39;s not quite over yet.

I see.</p><p>In short, he saw through everything and was playing dumb.</p><p>I am a little surprised.</p><p>My Etherlite is detached, so I don&#39;t know what he is thinking.</p><p>But I truly know just how good of a person he is.</p><p>Because he knew he didn&#39;t destroy the vampire, and that I was hiding something from him.</p><p>Yet he still waited for Sion Eltnam just like before.</p><hr><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;...... Certainly, there still remains one of my objectives, but that is my problem. Your objective was met last night, so I do not think there is any reason for you to wait for me.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Oh, yeah. Sorry, but please don&#39;t worry about it. After all, I couldn&#39;t quite rest easy unless it was completely confirmed. If the vampire was still here, it would be bad.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;I&#39;m not finished yet so there&#39;s no reason for me to go back. ...... Well, since our goals are pretty similar, can&#39;t we just team up like before? So, let&#39;s stay together a little longer.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;I do not mind, but I cannot bear responsibility for what happens. It will get deadly, and I will look out for myself more than for you. Are you still okay with that?&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Sure. I do the same thing, so I won&#39;t mind one bit.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Hm, I wonder.&quot;</p><hr><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Hm? Did you say something, Sion?&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;I cannot believe what you just said, but I do not mind.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Because, I can believe in you, Shiki.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500&quot;</p><hr><p>And, the two of us enter the building.</p><p>My legs which were shaking so hard earlier slip into an easy gait as if my trembling from before never happened.</p><p>Probably because I am happy.</p><p>To not fool myself and say it bluntly, I am overjoyed.</p><p>......

Yesterday, we defeated the Tatari that became Nrvnqsr. Yet he&#39;s still here. ...... Does that mean we have to defeat the true Tatari?&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;No. When it comes to Tatari, there is no such thing as &#39;true Tatari&#39; or &#39;fake Tatari&#39;. ...... Yes, not even you can completely kill Tatari. It is special among all the 27 Ancestors of th Dead Apostles.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Huh?&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Tatari can exist forever through others. The same as Roa, the Infinite Reincarnator.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Wait, wait a minute, Sion......! What did you say just now......!?&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Hm? Ah, about Roa. You were connected to him, weren&#39;t you?&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Yeah, I was...... wait, that&#39;s not it! What you said before! Um, what did you say exactly about Tatari!?&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Tatari is one of the 27 Ancestors of the Dead Apostles. ...... Hm, come to think of it, I never did tell you.&quot;</p><hr><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;No, you didn&#39;t!\u2500\u2500\u2500Those 27 Ancestors of the Dead Apostles are the strongest, aren&#39;t they!? I never knew he was one of those!&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;That was an omission on my part. I will explain everything, so please do not be angry.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Simply put, Tatari is an unprecedented vampire. The Dead Apostles are only humans who became vampires. They are second generation vampires who are their own breed of vampires apart from the True Ancestors. The highest among these are called the 27 Ancestors.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Among these 27, there are those whose true form is unknown. Even other Dead Apostles do not know of them, and not even The Church pursues them. Because they are Ancestors, the others of the 27 do not face them either. Their existence is strange even among vampires. Enigmas which stray from the norms of the 27. That is Tatari\u2500\u2500\u2500Number 13. The vampire called &#39;The Night of Wallachia&#39;.&quot;</p><hr><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;The Night of Wallachia? ...... I&#39;ve heard something about that from Senpai. The Church knows where the lairs of the 27 Ancestors are, with the exception of one of them......&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Yes. Tatari\u2500\u2500No, &#39;The Night of Wallachia&#39; does not have a lair. In the first place, it is something that does not even exist in this world.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;...... Something that doesn&#39;t even exist in this world......? You mean, he&#39;s dead?&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;No. There are those among the Ancestors that exist even though their bodies have been destroyed. Simply, you cannot destroy the 27 Ancestors by destroying just their bodies. But that is not what I meant. &#39;The Night of Wallachia&#39; truly does not exist. A Dead Apostle that cannot exist unless certain conditions are met. But as long as they are met, it is a Dead Apostle that can live forever. That is the form of the immortality possessed by &#39;The Night of Wallachia&#39;.&quot;</p><hr><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Immortality? ...... Not even Dead Apostles last forever, yet they still yearn for eternity...... right?&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Those are the words of the Infinite Reincarnator Roa. Yes, &#39;The Night of Wallachia&#39; resembles him terribly. It does not independently exist eternally, only by others.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Dead Apostles are immortal, but not eternal. An immortality which requires them to drink the blood of others means they will not age, but does not mean they will not die. Most Ancestors work to perfect that incomplete immortality, but they all fall short. Among them, there are those who seek eternity not from themselves, but from others. One was Michael Roa Valdamjong. A Dead Apostle who reincarnated into those with ability. Another is &#39;The Night of Wallachia&#39;, Zepia Eltnam Oberon. He took another approach from Roa, but still obtains eternity through others.&quot;</p><hr><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Zepia Eltnam Oberon...... Wait, his name is the same as......!&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Quiet. The details of his name have nothing to do with this explanation. It would take too long to explain that.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500&quot;</p><hr><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;He had his eye on using others to obtain eternity. No, you must say a circumstantial eternity. His life does not reach eternity, but his &#39;phenomenon&#39; does.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;No matter how strong a life form is, it can only know defeat against a life form which exceeds it. If its life is destroyed... if it dies, it will disappear. But, if its origin is a &#39;phenomenon&#39; that occurs after a certain set of circumstances, then it cannot truly die. Because as soon as those conditions are met, it will occur once again.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Zepia chose his occurrence conditions to be based on human conceptions. ...... Yes, to carry this analogy to the extremes, he is like a typhoon. A typhoon stems from low pressure, and is a continual menace, occurring over and over as long as conditions are met. But even if you could destroy the phenomenon of a typhoon, it will still reoccur within this world. That is what Tatari is like. \u2500\u2500\u2500A societal phenomenon, a rumor relying on information, which will continue as long as the human world continues. What is born from that is Tatari, the vampire called &#39;The Night of Wallachia&#39;.&quot;</p><hr><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;\u2500\u2500Sorry, Sion. Could you explain it in terms a little easier to understand?&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;There truly is no such orientation, but please think of it as a kind of energy that gives things orientation. The Dead Apostle Zepia failed in his attempts to gain the arcane secret called The Sixth. ...... But as expected from a Dead Apostle, he did not fail completely. He was unable to rewrite The System, but he was able to remain inside. After failing to gain The Sixth, Zepia&#39;s body was dispersed. But, it was dispersed according to his wishes. The diffusion of his strong spiritual elements caused them to remain in this world. Normally, the separation of these spiritual elements...... the soul&#39;s seperation from the body causes it to fall into nothing. Whether it happens quickly or slowly, it is all the same. A natural process one cannot resist. Released from the prison of the flesh, the spiritual elements with no intent of their own or salvation to orient them, perhaps fall into nothingness until they are once again transformed. ...... But before that happened to Zepia, he mastered the &#39;Tatari&#39; equation. As long as the certain conditions are met, his dispersed spiritual elements converge upon &#39;rumors&#39; and are born anew in this world. In the span it takes for a human to disappear, the alchemist Zepia calculated the place where Tatari would occur. All that was left was to chart his journey over a thousand year cycle and send his body along such a route. Of course, that route is an endless, one\u2212way trip. Zepia placed himself into that cyclical route so that even after the intent called Zepia ceased to exist, his scattered parts would continue along that program. The Dead Apostle named Zepia no longer exists. So the 13th slot has no name. The Dead Apostle called Tatari isn&#39;t actually a Dead Apostle, but is nothing more than a phenomenon.&quot;</p><hr><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Nothing more than a phenomenon......? But, a phenomenon that just enters reality from unpleasant rumors is just...&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Yes. The dispersed Dead Apostle does not have anything left of its former self. No, in the first place, there is no way for such a thing to come back. Where the Dead Apostle called &#39;The Night of Wallachia&#39; went is simple. It has to do with mastering the system of authenticating rumors and realizing them in his own body. When a community of people imagines one thing at the same time, there emerges a consensus of the village, a legend. When such a legend becomes universally established, The Night of Wallachia becomes that legend, and disappears in the same manner. ...... And it appears that the first appearance was in Romania\u2500\u2500\u2500occurring in Wallachia.&quot;</p><hr><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;...... Occurring in Walachia?&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;...... Yes. The Wallachia region of Romania was once home to the feudal lord Vlad Tepes. It is said that while he was lenient to his people, Vlad was incredibly brutal towards his enemies, the invading Turks. Doing the unthinkable to other people. Not only killing the enemy, but going even farther by using their flowing blood in his strategy. Despite going so far to protect his own people, rumors began to say he was a vampire. Of course, those were just rumors. Yet in a civilization blanketed in darkness, vampires did exist. And people feared that Vlad Tepes was a vampire. It had nothing to do with reality.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;And after Vlad Tepes died, the town still circulated the rumor. \u2500\u2500If the lord is a vampire, then during the full moon he will return to drink our blood, won&#39;t he?\u2500\u2500 Vlad, rumored to be a vampire even while he was alive, was still feared for being a vampire after he died. The rumor of a vampire in such an isolated place was very useful to Zepia. He chose Wallachia, the place of the death of Vlad Tepes, as his best sample case to begin from. ...... On the night of the full moon. He transformed into the rumored &#39;Vlad the vampire&#39; and began massacring the people. After the Knights of The Church arrived, there was not a single body with any liquid left. From street to street, human skins were spread all over the ground. Vlad, the vampire rumored to &#39;drink until there is nothing left&#39; drank not only their blood, but all the water within their bodies. Every one of the Knights must have thought it was a true nightmare. That event, that massacre was so terrible, The Church could only call it one thing. \u2500\u2500\u2500The ultimate nightmare, the gathering of all terror, Just, &#39;The Night of Wallachia&#39;.&quot;</p><hr><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;The Night of Wallachia? ...... And? What happened to him after that?&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;He disappeared. With the death of all those who feared his curse, his curse could no longer spread. After The Night of Wallachia kills all those who made him, he vanishes. Well, he was only able to appear for one night, so it is possible for people to survive.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;I don&#39;t get it. That Night of Wallachia materializes curses, right? So if he left the people alone that first spawned him, wouldn&#39;t he be able to last forever?&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;...... No. Tatari receives the form of a curse. Unless he acts according to that conceptualization, he will not be able to exist. After crystallizing into the object of the people&#39;s dreaded wishes, he kills them all an then vanishes according to those wishes. Appearing as a curse, Tatari must be above all else, a curse.&quot;</p><hr><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;\u2500\u2500I guess I understand a little. Then, it was humans who made The Night of Wallachia into a curse, so\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500&quot;</p><p>Tatari could be made into something bad or something good.</p><p>Kind of like that story about the monkey&#39;s paw, where it granted your wishes in all too simple of a manner.</p><p>So\u2500\u2500\u2500If humans thought of something good, then it wouldn&#39;t turn into a vampire, right?</p><hr><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;We have arrived at the rooftop, Shiki.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;...... Then, right here is where, um...&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Yes. At midnight, The Night of Wallachia will begin. \u2500\u2500\u2500You cannot die, Shiki, so please discard any useless thoughts right now.&quot;</p><p>Sion pushes the control panel.</p><p>The not\u2212quite finished elevator groans as the door opens.</p><hr><h4 id="shrine-skyscrapper-rooftop" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#shrine-skyscrapper-rooftop" aria-hidden="true">#</a> <em>Shrine Skyscrapper - Rooftop</em></h4><hr><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;The rooftop is still being constructed......&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;It seems no one is around...... hmm...... There probably has not been anyone around these past few days.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;? Sion, what are you doing? Spinning around like that... is that ballet?&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;No! I am using my Etherlite to draw information from the surroundings. Joking around at a time like this, you really are\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500!&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500!&quot;</p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/wawGCgF.png" alt="ball"></p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;It has begun. ...... That is, Tatari......&quot;</p><hr><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;This isn&#39;t good\u2500\u2500\u2500I can&#39;t really see them.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Of course. Right now, you cannot see any lines of death there. Even you cannot kill words. Inside there, it is still nothing but words. You cannot kill that which has yet to exist. At this stage, the only thing which can kill it is something like Arcueid Brunestud.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Arcueid......? You mean, only something that is so recklessly strong can break it?&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;\u2500\u2500\u2500You really are quite direct. ...... I have been wondering for quite a while, but how come you are only so direct when it comes to the True Ancestor?&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;No, that&#39;s not it. She won&#39;t understand unless you really spell it out for her.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500(Click). ............ I see. That is how Akiha feels. It may be wishful thinking, but I may get along with her.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Um...... What are you saying over there, Sion?&quot;</p><hr><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Can you not tell? I am just thinking aloud to myself.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Let us move on, Shiki. ...... It seems Tatari is taking shape.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500!&quot;</p><p><strong>???</strong>: &quot;\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;I knew it\u2500\u2500\u2500You chose to take the strongest form by drawing upon the thoughts of the person who knew of vampires in this town.&quot;</p><p><strong>Arcueid(Tatari)</strong>: &quot;But of course. The Night of Wallachia&#39;s goal has nothing to do with being a curse. Zepia&#39;s goal was to become a True Ancestor. Zepia never knew things would turn out like this, but in this town the method to become a True Ancestor, the answer he was seeking, has emerged. As a backup plan, Zepia investigated places where the Princess of the True Ancestors would appear, which is why I am now here. \u2500\u2500\u2500There&#39;s been a lot of ups and downs, but Zepia&#39;s goal is within my grasp. Tonight, the name The Night of Wallachia will end.&quot;</p><hr><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500&quot;</p><p>Without even thinking, I hold my breath.</p><p>This is Tatari......</p><p>The Night of Wallachia not only took her appearance, but took Arcueid&#39;s personality and mannerisms.</p><p><strong>Arcueid(Tatari)</strong>: &quot;Oh, you&#39;re here too, Shiki?&quot;</p><p><strong>Arcueid(Tatari)</strong>: &quot;Wow\u2500\u2500\u2500I thought you would have come by yourself, so I&#39;m pretty surprised Shiki is with you, Sion. You&#39;ve gotten a little softer over these past three years. Yeah, Riesbyfe was the one to protect you back then.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Bastard......! Don&#39;t speak so lightly about her......!&quot;</p><hr><p>Sion&#39;s whole body is shaking.</p><p>Arcueid\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500No, The Night of Walachia seems to enjoy seeing her like that.</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Wait, Sion. Can I try and talk for a little bit?&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Shiki......!? It&#39;s dangerous. That may look like the True Ancestor, but is totally different on the inside! Trying to hold a conversation, that&#39;s just being\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;I know. But there&#39;s something I want to ask. ...... The Night of Wallachia, right? If you&#39;re the vampire who truly takes the form of others, then answer me. You\u2500\u2500\u2500have you even once not had the will to drink someone&#39;s blood?&quot;</p><p><strong>Arcueid(Tatari)</strong>: &quot;\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500&quot;</p><hr><p><strong>Arcueid(Tatari)</strong>: &quot;I see now. Shiki, even though it&#39;s me, you&#39;re really concerned about that.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;...... I&#39;m just asking you a question. You can take the form of people&#39;s wishes, right? Then, maybe... Maybe once, you can actually become something good.&quot;</p><p><strong>Arcueid(Tatari)</strong>: &quot;Huhu...... Ahaha, Ahahahahahaha! Oh, you&#39;re so good. To ask me something so nice like that, it&#39;s wonderful! Wonderful!&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Don&#39;t poke fun. If you&#39;re in that form, then I know you&#39;ll answer me. Well, then? Has that ever happened?&quot;</p><p><strong>Arcueid(Tatari)</strong>: &quot;Yeah, it happened. Not once, but many times. When people wish for a bumper crop, or for arguing villagers to become friends, or for the god of a sacred tree, or to have a plague lifted. Of course, I grant each and every one of those. After all, I am the vampire who appeared according to everyone&#39;s wishes, right? Then I have to at least grant their wishes, don&#39;t I?&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;...... Then if you become something evil, it is because of people. You don&#39;t have any will of your own, so you can only do what people wish upon themselves, right?&quot;</p><p><strong>Arcueid(Tatari)</strong>: &quot;Yeah, that&#39;s right. Even now, I am the result of your uneasiness, Shiki. I never thought once from my own will to harm other people, you know.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;That is a lie. You, you have always killed people because you wanted to.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;...... Sion?&quot;</p><hr><p><strong>Arcueid(Tatari)</strong>: &quot;Oh? That&#39;s terrible, Sion. I even let you go, so that&#39;s news to me.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Then I&#39;ll ask, Night of Wallachia. You said there was a village that wanted a bumper crop. How did you make that happen?&quot;</p><p><strong>Arcueid(Tatari)</strong>: &quot;Simple. Without the proper agricultural conditions, you cannot have a great harvest, right? So I provided plenty of fertilizer. The dead bodies of everyone in the village, of course.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;And for the quarrelling townspeople? How did you make them friends?&quot;</p><p><strong>Arcueid(Tatari)</strong>: &quot;That was also simple. Everyone had a different opinion so that is why they were quarrelling, right? So I granted their wish. In the end, they all tried to escape from me together.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;...... And the village wanting their local god?&quot;</p><p><strong>Arcueid(Tatari)</strong>: &quot;I became their god. And because their god demanded it, I took the heart of each and every one of them.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;And the town praying for release from the plague......!?&quot;</p><p><strong>Arcueid(Tatari)</strong>: &quot;I helped them from the plague, too. The quickest way to end someone&#39;s suffering from the plague is for them to die, you know.&quot;</p><hr><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500Why... you\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500&quot;</p><p><strong>Arcueid(Tatari)</strong>: &quot;What are you so surprised about, Shiki? If you&#39;re that rude, I&#39;ll just kill you. Well, I&#39;ll kill you no matter what, actually. I am a vampire, and according to you all, I will drink the blood of everyone in this entire town.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;That is how things are, Shiki. The Night of Wallachia grants nothing other than the sucking of blood. A vile demon that broadly interprets every desire of the people into &#39;killing everyone and sucking their blood&#39;. The Night of Wallachia...... No, the man named Zepia who made it, will always kill everyone because he enjoyed it......!&quot;</p><p><strong>Arcueid(Tatari)</strong>: &quot;Of course. I wouldn&#39;t do it if it wasn&#39;t interesting. I appear according to everyone&#39;s desires, and then I leave in the manner that they wish. Huhu, the irony, the irony. Humans are so ironic! It&#39;s so wonderful that only humans are filled with this much irony, isn&#39;t it? A perfect, beautiful setting where everything goes right would be a boring play. What humans really enjoy is not a happy ending, but tragedy, right? What is beautiful is dirty, what is dirty is beautiful. If you cannot understand that, then you really can&#39;t take my place, Sion.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Eh\u2500\u2500\u2500What did, he just say?&quot;</p><hr><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Don&#39;t be ridiculous. I have nothing to do with you!&quot;</p><p><strong>Arcueid(Tatari)</strong>: &quot;Is that so? But your body is already at its limit. I don&#39;t know why you keep resisting it, but you should just hurry up and dirty yourself. If you become the Night of Wallachia, it&#39;s alright if Tatari never occurs again. Zepia may not have gained anything, but if it is you and The Night of Wallachia, you may achieve everything. At least the rate of success will increase.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;............&quot;</p><p><strong>Arcueid(Tatari)</strong>: &quot;What I introduced you to and the fact that you understand me will not change. I do not have to be the one in charge. As long as the Sixth is obtained, I will be satisfied. It isn&#39;t a bad thing, is it? With the two of us together, you could wield a veto over any orders from The Night of Wallachia. After all, you would be The Night of Wallachia. After that happens, all you would need to worry about is how you intake sustenance. If attacking humans is not to your liking, there are other ways. You could find a compromise between your dignity and The Night of Wallachia.&quot;</p><hr><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500I am amazed. You have created quite the useless formula, Wallachia. After all these hundreds of years, you&#39;ve just managed to gain a strong host. Your intelligence is being controlled by the intelligence of Arcueid Brunestud. ...... My. For one such as you, becoming a True Ancestor is impossible.&quot;</p><p><strong>Arcueid(Tatari)</strong>: &quot;\u2500\u2500\u2500What!?&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;I do not even need to consider your proposal. I came here to destroy you by my own hand. It is entirely a matter of my own personal grudge. Attempting to do business with me by appealing to emotion rather than calculation is the height of folly.&quot;</p><p><strong>Arcueid(Tatari)</strong>: &quot;\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Now please disappear, Wallachia. This night will not dance to the tune of your lies. Before they can permeate this town, I will destroy you now that you have taken shape.&quot;</p><p><strong>Arcueid(Tatari)</strong>: &quot;\u2500\u2500\u2500Oh? As one of my kind, I thought you would have sympathized with me. But, I was mistaken.&quot;</p><p><strong>Arcueid(Tatari)</strong>: &quot;The feeling is mutual, and you have ruined all the fun, Sion.

For you, defeating me is impossible.&quot;</p><p><strong>Arcueid(Tatari)</strong>: &quot;Shiki, you&#39;re very unfortunate. There are no restrictions to bind me here. Even if you killed Arcueid once, you will meet nothing but despair.&quot;</p><p><strong>Arcueid(Tatari)</strong>: &quot;Well then, this town is much bigger than usual.
