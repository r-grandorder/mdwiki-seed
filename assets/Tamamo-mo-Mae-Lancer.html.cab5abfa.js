But thanks to being in a vacation, she has completely exhausted her magical energy, turning into the beast of summer. That is the reason for her abnormally high physical ability. Perhaps due to having full flexibility and leeway, she seems to be more refined and high society than the usual Tamamo. She\u2019s under the assumption of being an elegant mannequin herself.

A solar explosion.<br> With wet T-shirt and a swim ring as her weapons, Lancer Tamamo-chan, shining like the sun on southern countries!<br> ...To understand her enthusiasm, let me explain. Tamamo-no-Mae is good-wife aspirant miko shaman. She was a peerless beauty who served Emperor Toba as his most favored court lady at the end of the Heian period. She was also said to be the Golden Fur White Face Nine Tailed Fox and the bunrei of the great goddess Amaterasu in the Throne of Heroes.
