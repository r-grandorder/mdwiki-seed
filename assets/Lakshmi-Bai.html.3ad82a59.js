They say there were many female soldiers in the rebel army who were inspired by Lakshmi.<br> The struggle of the rebel forces lead by Lakshmi were so admirable, that even the commander of the British army sent to subjugate them, Hugh Rose, left behind words of praise for them.</p><p>In 1858, the castle of Jhansi finally fell at the hands of the subjugation army, but Lakshmi managed to escape. She joined up with the other rebel forces and continued her resistance at Gwalior\u200B. However, the momentum of the rebellion did not spread further and, two months later, the British army launched an all-out attack on the castle of Gwalior.<br> Lakshmi fought bravely in that struggle but was reportedly killed in battle after being shot while leading her forces from the front line.</p><h2 id="character-in-fgo" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#character-in-fgo" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Character in FGO</h2><p>While a Servant from the modern times, through being caught up in the events of the Indian Lostbelt, she was endowed with divinity.<br> This is because, due to special circumstances, the Hindu goddess Lakshmi&#39;s bunrei is dwelling within her body and she turned into something akin to a semi-Pseudo Servant.<br> Their names matching also increased their magecraft-oriented affinity which helped with this outcome.</p><p>...However, that is not correct, as the one dwelling within her is the elder sister of Lakshmi, the goddess of misfortune and misery, Alakshmi (there is also a theory that she is the same existence as Lakshmi, just a different aspect of her).<br> It also said that Alakshmi is the second wife of the demon Kali who appears during the Kali Yuga.</p><p>What is inside her is truly a portion of a goddess, and her personality is almost the same as that of Lakshmi as a queen.<br> &quot;the engine (fuel) known as divinity&quot;<br> &quot;the impulses (of Alakshmi) seldom felt from within the depths of her body&quot;<br> &quot;the failure factor (light dojikko[1] disposition) that occasionally leaks out as a goddess of misfortune&quot;<br> Such are the goddess-like elements possessed by Lakshmibai.
