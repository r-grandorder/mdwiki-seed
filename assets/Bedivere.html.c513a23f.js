As you are aware, Chaldea is isolated from the rest of the world, and located in an extreme environment.</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> Our bodies and minds are under incredible pressure... We must always be aware of this.</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> Of course, we face the unprecedented threat that is the Incineration of Humanity.</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> And while the flames we face and the biting cold of Chaldea&#39;s environment are quite different in nature...</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> They can both be said to be exceptionally difficult environments.</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> That is the challenge that everyone here in Chaldea faces. Yourself included, Master.</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> As such, frequent checkups are of critical importance. Understood?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Okay!</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> Very good.<br> A most excellent response.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Thanks for looking out for me.</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> ...Your words humble me.</p><hr><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> Permit me to remind you once more:<br> I am here as a substitute for Miss Mash today.</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> As such, please ask me for anything. I am your attendant, your butler. I am your Servant today in every possible sense of the word.</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> How about training in the simulator? Or observing and monitoring the remnants from the Singularities would be appropriate as well.</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> ...Battling to gain something is what will lead to further growth for you, Master.</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> Battles for the sake of the Grand Order...</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> Or rather, battles to continue your survival,<br> will eventually wear you down.</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> Your soul. Your psyche.<br> Or speaking in modern terms, your nerves.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Nerves wearing down...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Modern terms? That&#39;s more of a medical term.</p><hr><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> There is one thing that crossed my mind, Master.</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> Normally, I wouldn&#39;t dare mention something like this to others...but in your particular case...</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> I&#39;m sure HE would be happy about it,<br> without a doubt. He is that kind of knight.</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> While any such approval given would be...ex post facto, unworthy though I am, I shall eventually gain it.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> He?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> When you said knight...?</p><hr><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> Yes. Actually...</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> My comrade, the man who is the epitome of freedom,<br> Sir Tristan, heads out to a certain place in every free moment he has.</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> Occasionally, I accompany him.<br> I believe it is a wonderful place to relax.</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> But please, keep that to yourself...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I will!</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> Thank you very much.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Where is it? The Rec room?</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> Haha.<br> Is that where you think it is?</p><hr><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> Let&#39;s head over there right away.<br> I will leave a note for Sir Tristan.</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> Let&#39;s go!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> The sea...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> So it&#39;s not outside, but in the simulator.</p><hr><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> You&#39;re less enthused than expected...<br> My apologies...</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> Perhaps I built up your expectations too much...<br> I must reflect on my presentation.</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> As you can see, this is a virtual creation in the simulator. We are not actually outside Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> Still, it gives me a sense of peace.<br> I hope it works for you as well, Master.</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> Initially, even I was skeptical about whether or not this would work.</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> I accompanied Sir Tristan to watch him go fishing and listen to his ranting that was nothing but difficult to understand...</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> There was nothing in particular to do except to spend time just watching the sky and sea.</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> But...surprisingly, doing so felt peaceful,<br> or rather, it calmed me.</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> And I wanted you to experience that same sense of peace, or at least calming effect.</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> ...Have I...overstepped my boundaries?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> No, taking a break sometimes is nice.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> No. Let&#39;s relax together, Bedivere.</p><hr><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> Thank you, Master.</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> Then...how about this?<br> Would you like to try night fishing?</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> Sir Tristan uses his Failnaught so skillfully to catch a great many fish.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Darn, we don&#39;t have fishing gear.</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> Ah, but we do.<br> I had Miss Da Vinci prepare us some.</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> In that much, I planned ahead. I am excited to provide you with the best fishing experience ever.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Don&#39;t we need to have entered that data beforehand?</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> Do not fret.<br> I requested Miss Da Vinci&#39;s help on that front.</p><hr><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> I believe I open up the multipurpose window...</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> Now I equip the extra item...and we&#39;re all set.</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> Well, I&#39;m sure there are other ways to do so, but I don&#39;t have as much experience with the simulator...</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> I understand Miss Jing Ke is quite well-versed in such things. She even brings things like alcohol with her, I am told.</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> But let&#39;s do it this way for today.<br> After you, Master.</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> The bait is already on the hook, so please cast it out to sea with all your might.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Hi-yah!</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> Wonderful.<br> Excellent, Fujimaru.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Arraaaghh!</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> Such bold and brazen movement...!<br> Amazing!</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> Wonderful!<br> Have you by chance tried fishing before?</p><hr><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> And now...the main event.</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> Well, there is nothing special to do now. At night, when the boundaries between the sky and sea are blurred, we just listen to the waves...</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> And please relax.<br> There&#39;s no need to feel rushed or impatient.</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> Please, sit back and enjoy this leisure time.<br> I will watch your line, so please do not worry.</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> ...This is something that I&#39;ve never said before...</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> Nor did Tristan say this...</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> But at times, I find myself thinking this:</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> Tristan was torn between the two Iseults.<br> And his fate led him to lose his life by the water.</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> Or rather, his soul...</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> Perhaps that is why he cannot be apart from the water. Even now, he could be waiting for that ship with the shining, pale white sail...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Bedivere, tell me a story.</p><hr><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> ...Shh, Master.<br> Empty your thoughts...your mind.</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> I am not saying you must enter an Eastern meditative state. Just...let yourself go. Calm. Peace.</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> Just watch the boundaries of the sea and sky to melt together, and doze into the blanket of night...</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> Let your daily stresses wash away.</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> !!!</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> Something&#39;s biting!<br> It&#39;s splashing!</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> It must be a big one...!<br> It&#39;s like Sir Kay swimming amongst the fishes!</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> This may be even bigger than that!<br> I&#39;ve never seen such an intense tug on a fishing line!</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> It could be a red snapper, mackerel, or even a tuna!</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> Let&#39;s reel it in, Master!</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> Just like humans take pictures of fish to record their greatest catches, we can capture its data and show it off to Miss Mash and Sir Tristan!</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> It&#39;s sure to make them smile!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Okay, let&#39;s do this!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Reeeeeel!</p><hr><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> !!!</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> You did it!<br> The fish just popped out of the sea!</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> ...That&#39;s...</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> The fish we caught is...actually, not a fish...</p><p><strong>Fish?:</strong><br> Gueeeeeeeeeaaahhh!!!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> What the hell is this!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> It&#39;s an enemy!</p><hr><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> Oh I&#39;m so embarrassed...</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> I must have made some kind of mistake when I set up the system. Doing something one is unaccustomed to can cause such trouble...</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> I pulled an all-nighter studying the manual...but I am no good at learning new things...</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> No, now&#39;s not the time for lamentations!<br> Master, your commands!</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> I am prepared to make amends for my misconduct. Or, rather, I am prepared to accept whatever punishment you deem fitting. But first, we have an enemy to fight!</p><p><strong>C\uFF1ABedivere:</strong><br> I swear by my Airgetl\xE1m that I will dispose of this immediately!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Of course! Let&#39;s do this, Bedivere!</p><hr><p><strong>C\uFF1ABedivere:</strong><br> Switch On - Airgetl\xE1m!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>B\uFF1ABedivere:</strong><br> Dead End, Airgetl\xE1m!</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> Please, allow me to apologize once more.</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> Even thought it was only in the simulator,<br> my most important job is to keep you safe...</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> It appears my efforts were fruitless once again...I&#39;m sorry, Fujimaru.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> There is nothing to forgive, Bedivere.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Nobody got hurt, so no problem.</p><hr><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> Thank you very much.<br> I am undeserving of such kindness.</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> Now...</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> It would be a waste to leave this, so let&#39;s eat it.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Pardon?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I don&#39;t really understand.</p><hr><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> I have memories from my previous life. For instance, from Round Table analects, King Arthur, number eight:</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> \u201CFood is all the same.<br> Nutrition is nutrition, even monster meat!\u201D</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> Now, Master...repeat!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Oh right...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Bedivere&#39;s kind of crazy like that!</p><hr><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> What are you talking about? Master?<br> Why are you backing away? Master!?</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> ...Once again, my apologies.</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> But I&#39;m glad. You cleaned your plate completely.<br> Now that I&#39;ve learned more about your food preferences...</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> In order for you to enjoy my dishes more in the future,<br> I will continue to hone my skills.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> By the way...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Where are we...?</p><hr><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> The seaside we visited is Sir Tristan&#39;s place of relaxation. Now we are at mine.</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> It&#39;s quite similar to a certain place in Britain.</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> A place of peace... Well, admittedly this tranquil place is where I allow my mind to race.</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> It is a place that helps me renew my resolve and reinvigorate my soul. So it may be a stretch to call this place a place of peace.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Bedivere?</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Care to share?</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> ...Yes, Master.</p><hr><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> Our Britain was a nation under constant threat of attack, never peaceful or stable.</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> Many fell victim to that strife,<br> and I could do nothing to save them.</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> The Giant of Mont Saint-Michel. A fearsome giant was wreaking havoc on Mont Saint-Michel of Brittany...</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> ...and kidnapped Princess Helena,<br> the niece of the King of Brittany.</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> Our King Arthur took Sir Kay and myself to hunt the giant down and rescue her.</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> On that quest...to be honest...I was of no help to the two of them.</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> King Arthur and Sir Kay defeated the giant in a gruesome battle and brought some peace to Brittany.</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> On the other hand, I...</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> ...I could not save the princess.</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> I was too late, powerless as I am.<br> All too little, too late.</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> Princess Helena, known for her grace, had her young and promising life plucked away, and we found only her pitiful corpse.</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> I couldn&#39;t save the people dear to me.</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> First, Princess Helena.<br> Then, the Battle of Camlann, my king...Arthur...</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> I failed...not once, but twice...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...Bedivere...</p><hr><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> ...This place...it reminds me of where Princess Helena drew her last breath.</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> Every time I stand here, it reminds me...that I am a powerless knight.</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> I am but a man who lost the two people he swore to protect.</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> This is the place where I vowed never to repeat those mistakes. Ever.</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> Master, I am a weak, powerless man who does not deserve to be numbered among the Knights of the Round Table.</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> And yet\u2013No, because of that, I offer you this vow, knowing that my manifestation here was truly a miracle:</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> I shall protect you, Master, who fights these brutal battles to defend humanity&#39;s future.</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> No matter how powerful our coming enemies may be...no matter how cruel the fate we face may be...</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> Your life...your heart...your body...<br> I shall protect you till the very end.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Thank you, Sir Bedivere.</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> ...Yes, Fujimaru.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I believe you.</p><hr><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> I swear that I will live up to your expectations, Fujimaru.</p>', 242);
