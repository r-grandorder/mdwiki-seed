Nothing, but...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> How to put it... I&#39;m feeling uneasy in a way I have not experienced before.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Now that I think about it, we&#39;ve really had a lot of unexpected Rayshifts so far.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> But what is about to happen is incomparable.<br> It looks like a wonderous, amazing experience...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Perhaps not so much a shift as it will be a drift?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Ah, I&#39;m sorry.<br> That doesn&#39;t make any sense.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Please don&#39;t worry about it, Senpai.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Mash, are you sick?

We should assume one or two unexpected events will occur.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> Meat tastes better when there&#39;s some tendon in it. Challenges are more fun when they&#39;re difficult.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> Hmm. I don&#39;t think we should expect bad things to happen. However...</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> I agree with her. There&#39;s no need for concern.<br> No matter what happens, we will be by your side.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Oh, Altria... Yes, I suppose you&#39;re right.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> And we&#39;ll be backing you up as much as possible from the Command Room.

But... this isn&#39;t a simple value fluctuation, it&#39;s a trap!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> There&#39;s a big hole in front of our usual Rayshift point!

Hmph, hah!<br> ...Owwww!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> The doctor goofed around at the wrong time, so I sent him away!

This is an unknown enemy type!<br> It&#39;s quite violent, but we have to fight back, Master!</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> Heh heh. Unknown enemies on an unknown land...<br> Now this is getting very convenient for me!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Phew. It seems we&#39;re safe for now.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Let&#39;s get back to assessing our situation.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes, let&#39;s. Does anyone know anything about this place?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Who here knows where we are?</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> Hmm. Unfortunately, I have no recollection of this place.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> Same here. To tell you the truth, I have no idea where this is. At the very least we are not in Japan.</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong><br> I&#39;m not sure either, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s France.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> I&#39;ve seen many places... but this doesn&#39;t seem to be one of them. It&#39;s a nice beach, though...</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> I agree.

I do feel a little uneasy because we can&#39;t get in touch with the doctor and Chaldea, but...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> With this many Servants around,<br> I am sure nothing can stop\u2014</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> Hey! Hey, hey, heeeeey!</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> I&#39;ve been standing here forever, and you didn&#39;t even notice me!</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> You went and broke-oro my fragile kokoro!<br> Imma need someone to give me a hug!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> Sheesh, even my tamed self is gonna go Caribbean Smash on you! A whole hour of waiting and all you&#39;re doing is staring at the girls...</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> Ah, wait. Actually, I guess anyone&#39;d do the same...and thus so would I.</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> ...But still, don&#39;t ignore me!<br> Notice me!</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong><br> Hahaha, aren&#39;t you being a little hasty, Mr. Beard?</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong><br> In situations like this, we must not outshine others; we may glow, but only discreetly.</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong><br> After all, yes, there are too many attractive ladies gathered here!</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong><br> If we sparkle too much, all kinds of slightly troublesome incidents might occur!</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong><br> Polygamy, swinging, and orgies, to name a few!</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong><br> ...Don&#39;t you think so, Diarmuid?</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> Yes. As expected from my liege... You really understand your...self well. Really keen observation.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> (Sigh) Does your Cycle always have to start with a skit?</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> ...I apologize. Despite his behavior, he is rather excited about all of this.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Yeah, I understand how he feels. To be taken adrift and arrive at an unknown island is nothing short of dangerous.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> No, what my lord is happy about is not the adventure that awaits us, but being able to develop a deeper bond with all the heroes here...</p><p><strong>Kojirou:</strong><br> Hahaha. Well, when the time comes, things will happen. We should just enjoy the view, don&#39;t you think?</p><p><strong>Kojirou:</strong><br> The beautiful sea, the gentle breeze, crabs you can&#39;t help but run your sword through... It&#39;s a curious little beach, isn&#39;t it?</p><p><strong>Karna:</strong><br> ...Crabs have it rough, don&#39;t you think? I mean, only being able to walk sideways all the time and all that?</p><p><strong>Karna:</strong><br> Still, the way they always look their opponent dead in the eye, that strong spirit... It&#39;s something all martial artists should learn from.</p><p><strong>Karna:</strong><br> And what about those hermit crabs, eh? Carrying your house on your back, like a mobile shut-in... Jinako should learn from them.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Hmm. It seems the men are all gathered over there.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> There were more people when we departed, but looks like we got separated. I hope they&#39;re safe.</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong><br> I&#39;ll ask because we&#39;re both pirates.<br> Blackbeard, do you know where we are?</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong><br> Oi, I&#39;m talking to you!</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> Oh, please excuse me! It&#39;s just... it&#39;s been so long since I last spoke with you, Missy Mary! It&#39;s like we&#39;re... touching each other with our words... It just makes me so excited!</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> Your voice is so irresistible! How do I put it... I like the way it passes through my ears, all slippery yet sticky!</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong><br> That does it, I&#39;m going to murder him.</p><p><strong>Anne:</strong><br> Yes, let&#39;s. We&#39;ll cut him into pieces.</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> Wait, wait, wait! You want to know about where we are, right!? To tell you the truth, I can&#39;t tell just by our current situation.</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong><br> I knew it, he&#39;s useless.<br> Now I won&#39;t feel bad when I slit his throat.</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> Don&#39;t jump to conclusions!<br> You really can&#39;t judge porn by its thumbnail you know!</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> I was going to say we might get a better idea if we take a look from the sea!</p><p><strong>Anne:</strong><br> Yes... You&#39;re right. We pirates remember continents and their shapes by how they look when viewed from a ship at sea.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Then... could you go and check?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> We&#39;re counting on you, Blackbeard.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes, that is probably the best option we have.</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> Whaaat? No way?<br> You really going to tell me that, Master?</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> I can&#39;t believe you&#39;re telling the super kawaii Blackbeard to go into the unknown sea alone...</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> I don&#39;t even have a ship...<br> I don&#39;t want to use my Noble Phantasm for this...</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong><br> What are you talking about?<br> You do have a ship, see?</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> Isn&#39;t that just a plain ol&#39; log that drifted to the beach!?<br> A lonely log!</p><p><strong>Anne:</strong><br> Here you go. Now you have an oar, too. It&#39;s perfect!</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> ...That&#39;s just a plank! A plain ol&#39; piece o&#39; wood!</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> If I go out to sea with this... I&#39;ll die!<br> Me, a Servant! I&#39;ll definitely die!</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong><br> Ugh, shut up already.<br> Why do you have to make such a big deal out of this?</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong><br> ...Fine. If you go, I&#39;ll give you a reward.</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> Say what!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> He just did a complete 180!<br> Look at that twinkle in his eye!</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> Hah... Hah... Hah... (Gulp)<br> \u201CReward,\u201D Missy Mary? What kind of reward?</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong><br> Let&#39;s see... I&#39;ll let you touch my body one time.<br> How about that?</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> Anywhere!?</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong><br> Anywhere you want.</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> YAS! It&#39;s finally my time to shine!<br> Back in a jiffy, dohoho, hahahahaha!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Um, there he goes... Just straddled the log, grabbed the plank, and rowed right out.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> All it took is eight small words...<br> I don&#39;t really know what to say. Is this really okay?</p><p><strong>Anne:</strong><br> I&#39;ll ask the same thing, but for slightly different reasons: is this really okay, Mary? For you?</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong><br> Of course not, but I don&#39;t mind. It&#39;s just a hunch, but I can feel something abnormal about this sea.</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong><br> I doubt he&#39;ll come back in one piece.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> ...!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...! More enemies!</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong><br> Hmph.<br> Attacking us while we&#39;re busy looking at the sea, huh?</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong><br> Looks like the island&#39;s inhabitants understand battle.<br> Not by knowledge, but by instinct.</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong><br> Master Fujimaru, what shall we do?<br> We could always just abandon Mr. Beard and flee...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> We have to annihilate them!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes.<br> Mash Kyrielight, going in!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Let&#39;s believe in Blacky and run!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Master, it&#39;s wonderful you have faith in Blackbeard&#39;s fighting spirit, but that won&#39;t do!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> We have to take them out!<br> Just in case Blackbeard comes back!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...It&#39;s really quiet here, Senpai.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Yes...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Feels like it&#39;s just the two of us here...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Ah, and what a nice sky.<br> All those stars, shining so bright...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> It really is beautiful.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> It&#39;s perfect, a sky full of stars.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes. I looked up at the sky in other Rayshift destinations, too, but...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I think this is the first time seeing so many stars without other light sources getting in the way.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...I feel a little strange.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Since I met you, Senpai, I&#39;ve experienced many things I never thought I would experience...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...and seen many things I never thought I would see.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> After all, until we met, Chaldea was all I ever knew.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Now, everything is new and colorful...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I&#39;m sorry, Senpai.<br> I... I don&#39;t know what I&#39;m saying.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The stars are so beautiful, and silent, and I guess I spoke without thinking.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I&#39;m glad I get to spend time like this with you, Mash.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes, Senpai. I&#39;m really glad, too.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It was an unexpected accident which brought us here. Honestly, there&#39;s no telling how things will pan out.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> At this very moment, however, I feel very lucky to have seen this starry sky with you, Senpai.</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Mary:</strong><br> Hmm... I kind of expected Blackbeard to be back by now, too...</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> My blood&#39;s pumping and I&#39;m ready for some action, but there&#39;s nothing to do. What to do, what to do...</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> Oh? Aching for some action, hmm?<br> I&#39;ll go a round or two with you, if you want.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> ...!?</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Look, if I try to kill time with you, the only thing getting killed... will be me!</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> I don&#39;t want to badmouth you, my mentor.<br> But try to read the room a little, would ya?</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> This ain&#39;t the Land of Shadows where violence rules, so try and adapt just a bit, kay?</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> Urk! Why you...! What a flippant disciple...<br> Still, you have a point... Rrrrr...!</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Good. Now that I shut her up, maybe I&#39;ll go fishing.<br> It&#39;s been a while, but I&#39;m sure it will come back to me.</p><p><strong>Kojirou:</strong><br> Heh... Martha. You don&#39;t need to hold back.<br> You can&#39;t hide the truth from these eyes.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> Huh!? Wh-What are you talking about!?</p><p><strong>Kojirou:</strong><br> We&#39;re by the sea, and it&#39;s summer. In a place where everyone lets themselves go, I can tell... You&#39;re getting really worked up, aren&#39;t you?</p><p><strong>Kojirou:</strong><br> Hahaha, no need to keep it all inside. What do you say? Shall we go at it right now?</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> Worked up? Go at it!? Why you...! That&#39;s enough sexual harassment, thank you very much!</p><p><strong>Kojirou:</strong><br> Alas, that&#39;s not what I was getting at. What I desire is the combination technique from you and Tarasque.</p><p><strong>Kojirou:</strong><br> There are no other saints around.</p><p><strong>Kojirou:</strong><br> I thought you would be able to show me your forbidden technique if there&#39;s no one around to mock you. Was I mistaken?</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> Oh, there you go again, techniques and battle once more...</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> Still... It&#39;s pretty boring just waiting for the return of our one-man scout party.</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> I need something to keep myself preoccupied, too...</p><p><strong>Karna:</strong><br> ...Wait. All of your desires are about to come true.<br> Look over there at that shore.</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> Mikon! Really!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Yes, Tamamo. Something is definitely coming.<br> I can see it, too.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...It&#39;s a large group of giant crabs!</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> ...Umm, that&#39;s not what I desired...</p><p><strong>Karna:</strong><br> ...It is impressive how fast they scuttle along with their multiple legs. As a time-killer, they&#39;re really more than we deserve.</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> Oh, the gods! That&#39;s so typical of you, Karna, but still... Still...!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The crabs aren&#39;t changing course!<br> It seems we&#39;ll just have to fight them!</p><p><strong>Anne:</strong><br> Sweet, merciful heaven, it&#39;s too hot for this business!</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> Agreed. But never mind the enemy and their numbers...<br> I mean, look at me!</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> Tch. This ain&#39;t beach armor, that&#39;s for sure.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> Oh well. Crustaceous monsters from the sea have appeared... Heh heh heh, this kind of feels like old times!</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> ...Ah. Is this what that hack samurai was referring to?</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong><br> What&#39;s that? Over there on the shore?</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> As always, my liege has good eyes.<br> It appears some seaweed washed ashore... or not.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> It&#39;s a dead body! The man must have drowned and quietly drifted ashore during that frenetic battle.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> I suppose we should give him proper rites and bury him.</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> YES to beautiful girls, HELL NO to burial.<br> I&#39;m...still...alive... (twitch twitch)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It&#39;s Blackbeard! He came back while we were fighting!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Let&#39;s ask him what he found out.<br> While we still can...</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong><br> Blackbeard, tell us what you know.</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> Ah, a girl&#39;s voice penetrates my dizzy head... Aye, that reminds me. The reward... Where&#39;s my reward?</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong><br> After we hear your report. Now spill!</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> Hahehue, you&#39;ll be squirming after that, Missy Mary.<br> I bet your heart&#39;s already poundin&#39; with anxiety an&#39; anticipation!</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> I can hardly wait myself.<br> But report first, then fun.</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> Based on my observation of this land from the sea,<br> I don&#39;t have a single clue of where we are.</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> The alignment of the stars in the sky makes no sense.<br> It doesn&#39;t help pinpoint our location at all.</p><p><strong>Anne:</strong><br> Any other information?</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> Ah, cripes, me vission is getting blurry...<br> All the blood rushin&#39; elsewhere?</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> ...The open ocean... High, battering waves... Even the tide is complicated and mysterious. Impossible for any ship to make a decent journey.</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> And then... (cough cough) ...Oh, it&#39;s my fav doujin! What&#39;s it doin&#39; here? I thought I lost it... Shiver me timbers!</p><p><strong>Anne:</strong><br> Hey! Please don&#39;t voyage into the afterlife before you&#39;ve told us everything!</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> Reward... If I only had my reward... I could hang in there...</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong><br> I guess we don&#39;t have a choice. ...Oh, Blackbeard.<br> I&#39;m so impressed that you made it back here.</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong><br> (monotone) Nice recon. You&#39;re the greatest pirate that ever sailed. I&#39;m so in awe. Yay.</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> Uh... Y-Yay...?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Mary just reached out to the trembling Blackbeard... and he responded...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Like a high-five.</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong><br> There, you touched me. That&#39;s your one touch.<br> I held my end of the bargain, now keep talking.</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> ...Ooooh... Oooooh...!</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> Even while I&#39;m trembling in despair, you appeal to me with the touch of a wee, soft palm.</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> Despair... Aye, despair! I, the fearsome Blackbeard, will show you all the true meaning of despair!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> He&#39;s suddenly gone into serious mode!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> \u201CDespair\u201D?</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> Heh heh, heh heh heh. I figured it out after investigating this land from the sea. The final conclusion\u2014</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> This is... a desert island!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...!?</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> Haha lololol. A desert island... Impossible to escape...<br> A harem lifestyle&#39;s inevitable. Men&#39;ll be mobbed by the ladies!</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> ...And yet... And yet, why...</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> I&#39;m the one who worked the hardest, yet I can&#39;t participate!? That&#39;s like, RNG luck!</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> You&#39;ve trampled on my dearest wish! May my blood stain this woooorrrld! May the Holy G-Cup be cursed!</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> Strange... I suddenly feel a deep affinity to him...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...How unfortunate.<br> He didn&#39;t make it after all.</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong><br> Going by what he said, it doesn&#39;t sound like a normal ocean. And... a desert island...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Communications with Chaldea are down... and it&#39;s just us, on a desert island in the middle of who-knows-where.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Just...<br> Just what are we supposed to do in a situation like this?</p><h2 id="section-2-life-is-beautiful" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2-life-is-beautiful" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 2: &quot;Life is Beautiful&quot;</h2><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> Uggghhh... Once I heard there was no one here, I think this island started to feel even hotter.</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> I think foxes shine brightest when there&#39;s snow and cold, don&#39;t you, Master?</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> My poor tail is soaked with sweat.<br> You know what I&#39;m talking about, right, Fou?</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Foou.</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong><br> The food we took with us when we left is almost gone.</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong><br> Even if we just use it to keep Master alive, who knows how much is left...</p><p><strong>Anne:</strong><br> The way you shiver when you realize there&#39;s a long time till you hit port, and you&#39;re almost out of food...</p><p><strong>Anne:</strong><br> It reminded me of that.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...I should&#39;ve studied how to get by when you arrive on a deserted island with nothing.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fooou...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Wh-What do we do?</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> Don&#39;t worry.<br> There&#39;s no need to think too much about it.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I&#39;m sure it&#39;ll work itself out.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> That&#39;s right. No need to think too much about it, Mash.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Sc\xE1thach... Do you have a plan?</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> I don&#39;t know if you could call it a plan, but we have to do what we must.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> Our first priority needs to be to try and contact Chaldea.<br> And then we can request help.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes... That&#39;s right. But the problem is that we can&#39;t get through. I don&#39;t think the system is broken...</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> Is it possible that if we leave this island and go elsewhere, the system will come back online?</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Foufou!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That&#39;s... a possibility.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> We lost the connection once we arrived on this island, so if we leave, it might be restored.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> But if we can&#39;t leave the island...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> We mustn&#39;t forget Blackbeard&#39;s noble sacrifice...</p><p><strong>Anne:</strong><br> I think a good way to start may be trying to find a way off this place.</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong><br> Yeah. Blackbeard told us that an ordinary ship wouldn&#39;t be enough.</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong><br> ...Which means that a good, proper ship just might.</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong><br> But...this island is uninhabited, right?<br> Surely we wouldn&#39;t be able to procure such a ship?</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> We can make one.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...Come again?</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> I said we can make one, Master.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Is a ship something you can...make?</p><p><strong>Anne:</strong><br> We may be able to steer a ship...<br> But we don&#39;t know how to make one.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> Don&#39;t worry. I know a thing or two about it.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> By combining my runes, I can make almost anything.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> I need time, and materials, though.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> S-So dependable!</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> As far as I can tell, this island should have what we need.<br> It seems very bountiful.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> Thus, we probably don&#39;t need to worry about resources.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> ...It&#39;s the monsters that surprise me. I didn&#39;t expect to see this many stomping around like they own the place.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> An island&#39;s supposed to have a ruler, see.<br> Be it human, beast, or god.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> So either the ruler has abandoned his duties, or he has forgotten them... It&#39;s a sad thing, either way.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That was... Fou&#39;s subtle warning that monsters are approaching!</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> Oh, they&#39;re back! Stop talking and help!<br> Damn it! It&#39;s so hot in this armor!</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> That&#39;s what you get for wearing such heavy protection.<br> It&#39;s foolish to try and dress up to intimidate an opponent.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> You should take this opportunity to pick armor that suits your frame. Of course, even if you do\u2014</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> That still won&#39;t be enough to bring your grade as a knight above negative.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> Grrrrrr...!</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> Either way, we can talk more after we beat them into the ground... I mean, drive them off!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> All right, where were we?</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> It&#39;s going to take time to build a ship.<br> It&#39;s not something you can do in an afternoon.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> Our goal\u2014</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> Needs to be to find a way to live on this island while we gather the materials we need.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Live here?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes. I&#39;m a little worried about that too.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Materials?</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> Wood, stone, iron... Other things as well. Don&#39;t worry.<br> I can modify them once I have them.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I&#39;m more worried about living here.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The climate and topography here are both completely different from that in Chaldea. Who knows what kind of natural phenomena we might encounter?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It is also unclear what we&#39;ll face with the environment. And there&#39;s the problem of food and water... Will we be okay?</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> Don&#39;t worry. I can make almost anything you need\u2013including ships.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> Some of the knowledge I&#39;ve acquired includes how to survive, even on an uninhabited island.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> If you need anything, you can count on me.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> It might be inconvenient at first, but as we make what we need, life will get easier.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> Heh. It&#39;ll be a form of training.<br> You&#39;ll need to give it your all.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> ...Now then.<br> I have a suggestion for everyone\u2014</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> Hmm. Not bad.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> What do you mean!? It&#39;s great!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> What do you mean!? It&#39;s great!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> U-U-Um! Sc\xE1thach?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Wh-Why... swimsuits?</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> Why? First, this island is hot.<br> Even if you&#39;re not wearing armor like Mordred.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> Too much heat dulls the body, even if you&#39;re a Servant. And the heat affects you in combat too.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> A master warrior must adjust their appearance to match their location and conditions.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> I&#39;ve altered your Spirit Origins to accommodate our surroundings. It&#39;s not bad, is it?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> Ya got that right. It&#39;s nice and cool, and easier to move around. Hehe.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> I can swing my sword around more than usual now. Without my armor, I may be stronger than King Arthur!</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> Hmm. I need to prepare appropriate weapons for this outfit.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> I think I still have what I picked up that one time at Waku Waku. A knight must always have the most appropriate weapon.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> (What is that!? She took out this weird gun like it was the most ordinary thing in the world!)</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> (And it looks really summery, too! That&#39;s not fair!)</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> Oh, right. I need to change my weapon too!<br> I&#39;ll bring out this special item I&#39;ve been saving!</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> (Yeah, it&#39;s gotta be this: the shield that also becomes King Arthur&#39;s ship... I&#39;m glad I swiped it!)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Those two aren&#39;t talking to each other, but they are.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I&#39;m not getting in between them...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes, Master. Their relationship is extremely complicated, and who knows what will happen if you get involved.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It&#39;s best to just go with the flow and watch what happens.</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> Come take a look at me.</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> If you can&#39;t endure the heat, enjoy the heat.<br> If the sun is strong, then use the sunlight...</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> That&#39;s the way of a proper lady.<br> What do you think, Master?</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> I can use my parasol as a spear, and become Lancer Tamamo-chan! \u2661</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> Hehe! I&#39;m in a swimsuit!<br> On a tropical island! With Master!</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> We&#39;re not just stuck here.<br> We&#39;re not just stranded on an empty island.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> For me and Master, this is...yes...<br> This is our honeymoon...</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> Hehe...hehehe...hehehehehehe...</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> It&#39;s a little embarrassing to show so much skin...<br> But I can&#39;t help it.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> Given the situation, I must forget my role as a saint, and deal with this trouble as just plain old Martha.</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong><br> I&#39;ve never done anything like this.<br> It&#39;s a little exciting, isn&#39;t it?</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong><br> I spend a lot of time on the water, but it&#39;s been a while since I&#39;ve dressed up to swim.</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong><br> Master, do I look weird?</p><p><strong>Anne:</strong><br> It&#39;s very cute, and it looks great on you, Mary\u266A</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You&#39;re all such free spirits...</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Foufou.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes. When she said swimsuits, I was thinking competition ones. You all look great!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> (Blush and look away)</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> Hey, Master.<br> No one minds if you look at their swimsuit.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> If you weren&#39;t allowed to look at it, it would be no different than being naked.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> Averting your gaze is no different than refusing to look someone in the eye when you speak. It&#39;s rude.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> And so I say to you: gaze upon it all!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> (That seems like an amazing thing to say...)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I agree that a swimsuit is better suited for this environment.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> But my one concern\u2014</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> ...!</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> I understand.<br> It&#39;s whether we can fight in these outfits or not, right?</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> No need to worry. Even in our tropical island versions, we&#39;re still powerful Servants.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> This is true even if our classes have changed due to our unfamiliarity with swimsuits.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> Now then, Master, your orders!<br> I shall show you the power of summer!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I&#39;m sorry. To be honest I didn&#39;t really believe it, but... way to go, everyone!</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> That battle was an offering I made to our future together... Did you see it, Master?</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong><br> It&#39;s fun to have a different role than usual.</p><p><strong>Anne:</strong><br> I agree, Mary.<br> This isn&#39;t a bad change of pace.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> All right! I landed a nasty strike right on their body!</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> The beach really does make things feel more exciting! Not having my staff does make me a little uneasy, though! (Fwoosh fwoosh)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> (Even as she said that, Martha was shadowboxing...)</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong><br> ...Heh. Fate must truly love me.</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong><br> Everything&#39;s going my way...<br> That&#39;s just how things work out for me.</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong><br> Don&#39;t you think so, Diarmuid?<br> By the way, which one is your type?</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong><br> I hope you don&#39;t like the same one I do. Like what happened with Gr\xE1inne. Or what happened with Gr\xE1inne.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> Um, well... that&#39;s kind of a hard question to answer...<br> I couldn&#39;t say, really...</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> Also, I don&#39;t know why you had to say that twice.</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong><br> Hahah! Don&#39;t worry. It was just a joke.</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong><br> The thing with Gr\xE1inne was just something the people around me set up. To be honest, I was surprised too.</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong><br> But this time, conditions are the same for both of us.<br> It&#39;s a fair fight, I guess you could say.</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong><br> No, that&#39;s not right. It&#39;s not fair.<br> You&#39;ve got that Love Spot!</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong><br> You&#39;re going to show it off by winking at all of them, aren&#39;t you?</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong><br> Wink! Wink!</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> I&#39;ll do nothing of the sort! Moreover, I would ask that you, my liege, keep your thumb out of your mouth!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> That&#39;s right, the guys are here, too...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Um, where are your swimsuits?</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong><br> Don&#39;t worry about it.<br> Diarmuid&#39;s basically wearing a swimsuit already.</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong><br> Even if the girls&#39; outfits have changed, our position hasn&#39;t. You just focus on the girls.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Yes, that&#39;s right. I agree.<br> We men will do our best not to stand out.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> ...Sheesh. My mentor&#39;s pretending to be calm, but she&#39;s more excited than anyone.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> She didn&#39;t need to change too...<br> That combat outfit was water-resistant anyway.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> That settles it. I&#39;m staying as far away from her as possible. I&#39;m not getting close. Forget about the beach.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> I&#39;m going to the mountains.<br> Maybe I&#39;ll plant a field or something...</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Foufou.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> What happens now?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> This is going to be thrilling in a lot of ways...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Yes. But I think the basic plan is just as Sc\xE1thach said.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Our goal needs to be to get resources to escape.<br> And to survive until we do.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> For that to happen, I think we&#39;re going to need to build some new facilities.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> At first, it&#39;s going to be hard, I think\u2014<br> But I&#39;ll support you with everything I have.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I&#39;ll help you make the escape ship, and I&#39;ll help you make our life here better.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Let&#39;s search this island and gather materials and supplies!</p><h2 id="section-3-food-fighter" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-3-food-fighter" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 3: &quot;Food Fighter&quot;</h2><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> We built a place to live, and a place for water.<br> I thought we were doing well, but...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> This is the biggest mistake I&#39;ve ever made.<br> How could I have not noticed?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...We&#39;re almost out of food.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> Servants don&#39;t need to eat.<br> If anything, food is like a mood stabilizer for us.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> However, that&#39;s not the case for Master...<br> This is a big problem. How did you guys get by so far?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> We&#39;ve been eating the rations we brought from Chaldea, but they&#39;re about to run out as well.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> We tried to conserve them, but...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I guess they had to run out eventually...</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> That just means... we&#39;ll have to procure food ourselves.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> A lack of food is a serious issue. It doesn&#39;t just affect our Master, but it lowers our morale as well.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I thought Sc\xE1thach might be able to help, but I haven&#39;t seen her for a while...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> So for now, we&#39;ll have to rely on ourselves.<br> Let&#39;s see if we can find something to eat!</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> Hmm... all the plants are so different from the ones in Bethany. I&#39;m not sure which ones are safe to eat...</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> But alas, it is best to remain calm in situations like this. Nothing will go wrong if we stick to our instincts.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> (I&#39;m nervous...)</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> Humph. Master, why do you look so nervous?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> (I have a bad feeling about this...)</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> Humph. Master, why do you look like you have a bad feeling about this?</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> There&#39;s no need to worry. I used to feed all kinds of weird things to my little brothers, and they were mostly fine.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> In fact, they prayed even harder after they ate.<br> They even had tears in their eyes when they did.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> The look on all those tough little boys&#39; faces reminded me of how He prayed over the suffering and sins of mankind.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> So don&#39;t worry. And don&#39;t disobey me. My gut feeling is pretty good at times like this, you know?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> (I don&#39;t know what their tears really meant, but I do know that whenever that happened, Martha didn&#39;t eat any of those things herself!)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> F-For now, I&#39;ll get going!<br> Please wait for me, Master!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...I&#39;m sorry, Master.<br> I should&#39;ve read up on how to survive outdoors.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I could barely find anything... All I managed to do was bring Fou back with me. He was wandering around over there.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> ...?<br> Fo... Fou!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Looks like Fou just realized something!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Oh, th-that&#39;s not what I meant, Fou!<br> I brought you back here because you&#39;re fluffy and fun.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I didn&#39;t bring you back here for your calories!</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> I can&#39;t say I found much either...<br> Just a few different kinds of fruit.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Ooh... Well done! What are they?<br> I&#39;ve never seen these shapes and colors before.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> ... (Grin)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Oh no! I don&#39;t trust your instincts!</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> You&#39;ve got a problem with my instincts!?<br> It&#39;s never been wrong! It&#39;s fine!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> They all look like coconuts... but upon closer inspection, one has thorns, one is fluorescent pink...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> And one smells terrible... I&#39;m getting kind of worried.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> At the very least, I don&#39;t think you&#39;ll die instantly from eating them. Just spit it out if your tongue feels numb, got that?</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> Do the same if your stomach feels strange after you swallow.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> If you&#39;re having trouble regurgitating it, let me know.<br> I&#39;ll use a special method to, um, knock it right out of you.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou, foooou!</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> Ahem. Anyway, that will tell us whether it&#39;s something ominous and deadly, at least.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> As a saint, I can swear that to you.<br> Trust me.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> ...Okay, looks like you have no objections, so let&#39;s get started. Go ahead, Master.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> (So I really have to eat these on my own...?)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> O-Of course, I&#39;ll try them with you, Senpai.<br> We&#39;re in this together.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Oh, but wait. These look like coconuts, so their shells must be made like coconuts too.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I&#39;ll go get something to cut this open\u2014</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> Haiiee-yaah!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> She chopped the top off... with... just her hand!</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> Okay, you should be able to drink from it now.<br> No need to thank me.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...Okay... here I go... GWAH!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Th-This is... It&#39;s spicy! Just as you&#39;d expect from something covered in thorns! It&#39;s spicier than a habanero!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> My whole body started to sweat instantly!</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> Well that&#39;s a shame. Still, I suppose it&#39;ll make some good seasoning... Anyway, let&#39;s try the pink one next.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> MATTHEW!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> H-Here I go... Uwagh!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...It&#39;s tasteless. It&#39;s completely tasteless!<br> And the texture is all weird and dry.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> If I had to compare it to something...<br> It&#39;s like eating an eraser.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It&#39;s probably okay if it&#39;s nutritious... but it&#39;s not something I&#39;d eat on my own... ever...</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> ...Huh? That&#39;s strange.<br> Normally, at least one thing I find turns out to be edible.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> Maybe my intuition&#39;s grown dull...<br> Well, on to the last one.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> MOSES!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> O-Okay, let&#39;s try this... Mgaaghh...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> Hey, why aren&#39;t you saying anything!?</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> I&#39;m pretending not to notice the horrible stench that came after I opened it.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> This is... It&#39;s edible. I... guess.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> What? Then it&#39;s fine, right?<br> What&#39;s with that look on your face?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I guess the best way to describe the taste is...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Spicy salted squid.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Fermented soybeans.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It really doesn&#39;t taste like something... that you&#39;d expect from a fruit...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I suppose you could eat it... if you forced yourself to.<br> But that actually just makes it all the more disgusting.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> But it IS edible, right?<br> That means more choice in an emergency. Good.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> I have to say, Fujimaru, Mash,<br> you&#39;re both too picky anyway.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> People in the past ate things that tasted a lot worse, you know. Just be grateful to the Lord that your food tastes like anything at all.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> (That didn&#39;t sound very convincing.)</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> But to tell you the truth, it wasn&#39;t just instinct this time. There was a reason that I thought this last one might be safe to eat.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> What&#39;s that?</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> I saw a crab eating one that fell on the ground.<br> It wouldn&#39;t do that if it was poisonous, right?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Doesn&#39;t that mean, though... that it&#39;s crab food?</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> ...That&#39;s right.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> And we&#39;re spreading this smell everywhere.<br> Which means...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I knew it! There they are!</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> Oh, more hungry lost lambs over there, too.<br> Maybe they&#39;re in the same situation we are...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> But let&#39;s take them out before we get eaten, Master!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I don&#39;t think Master&#39;s food shortage can be solved with those mysterious fruits.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Considering the taste and the fact that enemies attack every time we bite into one... At most, we can use it as emergency rations.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> As for other sources of food... well...</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong><br> Oh no, I didn&#39;t know we were in that much trouble.<br> I guess we don&#39;t even have any bread.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong><br> ...? I&#39;m sorry, but I can&#39;t help you even if you keep staring at me like that, Master. I wish I could be of some help...</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Huh? You were all looking for some food?</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> I&#39;m just about to go freshwater fishing.<br> Wanna come with me?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Fishing, huh? That does sound like a solution.<br> But I have no experience... Besides, what about the equipment...?</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> What, are you afraid you won&#39;t be able to reel any in? Don&#39;t worry, the best thing about fishing is even a beginner can catch some.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> I can make rods for you. One each for Mash and Fujimaru, right? Piece of cake!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> As expected of a member of The Backspears Boys!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Okay, everyone! We&#39;re all going fishing!</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong><br> I&#39;ve never been fishing myself,<br> but it sounds like so much fun!</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> Freshwater style? Oh, what refined taste! There&#39;s no way I can pass this up. It&#39;ll be like summer vacation in Japan all over again!</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> I was thinking to go find some wild grass for Master, but you changed my mind. I&#39;d like to come with you, too.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Wow, got a lot more people now... Gotta make four more rods, huh? Well, I don&#39;t mind. The more the merrier!<br> That&#39;s fishing for ya!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Uh, I see.<br> So this squirming thing is the bait...</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Yep. Recommended for beginners, too.<br> Once you get enough experience, you can do without it.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Can you put it on yourself, Mash?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes, I&#39;ll try!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Do you want me to put it on for you, Mash?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...<br> N-No, I&#39;m fine. Thank you though.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I can manage something like this by myself.<br> I don&#39;t want to cause you any trouble!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...You put it on a hook like this...<br> It&#39;s okay, Mash, just relax...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I did it! I did it, Senpai!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Good job! Headpats for you...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Oh, no... you don&#39;t have to... I only did what everyone else should be able to do... I was just too inexperienced...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Now let&#39;s go fishing!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes, I&#39;ll try my best!</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> Fishing is a hit-or-miss business.<br> Taking it easy is the right manner to enjoy it.</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> Sitting next to Master, looking out over the water together as time passes us by...</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> For me, that alone is enough.</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> Fishing can be such an elegant, upscale pastime as well.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Oh, I see someone here gets it. I agree with you.<br> I guess knowledge does come with age.</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> Twagh! I-I dare you to say that to Sc\xE1thach as well!<br> And you know what? How about you DROP DEAD!</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> Oops, well, pardon me\u2606<br> Today, Tamamo is elegant and classic\u2606</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong><br> This is my first time... It&#39;s okay to try without bait, right?<br> Maybe I&#39;ll go ahead and do just that.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> I meant it&#39;s okay for experienced fishermen like myself, though... Well, anyway, up to you.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Like what Miss Fox there said, you should be fine as long as you give it a try and keep a line dropped.</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> Well, Master, let&#39;s sit back and enjoy ourselves.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I&#39;m quite serious here. We must catch some big fish so Senpai can get some proper nutrients!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I can&#39;t catch any at all...</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Try to hide your presence, Shieldy.</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> Mmmm... It&#39;s soooo frustrating...</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> Though I said spending time with Master would be enough, the fact that it is taking so long to catch something is making me a little...</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> What, are you giving up already?<br> You&#39;re less patient than I thought you were.</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> You haven&#39;t caught any yet, either!</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> I&#39;m fine because I&#39;m enjoying the process.<br> Besides, I&#39;m not hungry yet.</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> ...It might be a problem with the rod. Maybe I should get in the stream directly and try my luck at spearfishing like a true Lancer would...</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> Oh. That&#39;s not good. A sophisticated woman wouldn&#39;t do that, and to be frank, it&#39;s a job more suited for the Cat...!</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> I, as a fancy mannequin, cannot stoop to that level!</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Also, it seems you haven&#39;t noticed yet, so I&#39;m gonna tell ya. The princess over there caught something.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The princess over there...?</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong><br> ...Here you go! Hehe, I&#39;ve just caught another one.</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong><br> ...Oh, look at you, staring at me with those<br> \u201CDon&#39;t eat me!\u201D eyes... All right, all right.</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong><br> I&#39;ll let you go, so don&#39;t get caught ever again, okay?</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> That&#39;s what she&#39;s been doing for the whole time. Looks as if fish come willingly to get caught. So being unselfish is the secret of fishing after all?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I don&#39;t think ANY fish have \u201CEat me!\u201D eyes, Marie...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Wait, something is wrong.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Look at that bend of the rod!</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong><br> Eek! Wh-What is...this...?</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> A big one!? Let me give you a hand!<br> I&#39;m coming right now, so hang in there!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Master!</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> We should help her out, too!<br> It looks kind of fun!</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong><br> I feel I&#39;ll be dragged into the river if I lose my concentration...!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> All together now! One, two, three!</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Good! I see it now! One more should do it!<br> Here we go now!</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> It&#39;s a whopper of a fish!</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong><br> Hmm... Definitely not \u201CDon&#39;t eat me!\u201D eyes.<br> Would you say this one looks like it wants to eat us?</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> What on earth have you reeled in!?</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> I guess I&#39;ll hang around and help you look for food. After inviting you all out on that unsuccessful fishing trip, it&#39;s the least I can do.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Well, thank you, C\xFA Chulainn.<br> Your help means a lot to us.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> ...You know, the normal way to \u201Cprocure food\u201D is to hunt.<br> So, let&#39;s go hunting!</p><p><strong>Anne:</strong><br> I see, so that&#39;s why you asked us to tag along.</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong><br> This&#39;ll be a walk in the park.<br> ...Oh, Your Majesty. Why are you here?</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> It&#39;s useless asking me that question. Hunting is a knight&#39;s hobby. Especially since I am an Archer now. I will not let any prey escape me.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> It would be perfect if my trustworthy horses Llamrei and Dun Stallion were here. My hound Cavall too.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Well, well, let&#39;s see how good you are then. Oh, I just got a glimpse of a deer in the lee of the mountain right over there.</p><p><strong>Anne:</strong><br> What shall we do? Should I have Mary chase the deer so I can shoot at it when it jumps out\u2014</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> No, let me try this time around. I would like to warm up since I have not been hunting for a while.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> Now, watch me.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> Ex\u2014</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> !?!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Stop! Stooooop!</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> What?</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Don&#39;t you \u201Cwhat\u201D me! What the hell are you doing?</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> Well. When your game hides in the lee of a mountain or a dense forest...</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> ...then completely eradicating the surroundings would be one way to get at it, wouldn&#39;t it?</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> It&#39;s not something I always do, you know?<br> ...There are times when I need to, though. That&#39;s all.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> Child of Light, am I breaking Celtic hunting etiquette in some way?</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> This goes way beyond simple etiquette!<br> No one bothered to bring it up to you?</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> Don&#39;t be ridiculous.<br> Are you saying this is an absurd thing to do?</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> When Agravain came with me on hunts, he would say with his lifeless eyes, \u201CImpressive, Your Majesty. You certainly gave it your all.\u201D</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> Are you saying that was all just lip service?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Well, not lip service per se... How should I put it...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Wow, so ex(tra), much calibur... Nothing, I said nothing.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Wow, the king thinks big.</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong><br> A-Anyway, we should ban the use of Noble Phantasms.<br> Let us deal with that deer.</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong><br> Come on, Anne. It&#39;s hunting time!</p><p><strong>Anne:</strong><br> Yes, ma&#39;am\u266A<br> Let&#39;s show everyone how skilled we are!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> As expected of Altria!<br> Birds... rabbits... you caught a lot!</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> Well, I did pretty good for a class I&#39;m not used to.<br> You did a good job, too, Mash.</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong><br> Anne is good at shooting birds, too. I mean, out on the open sea, that&#39;s the only target there is.</p><p><strong>Anne:</strong><br> For the time being, this game should be enough.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> So Anne and Mary shot the deer... That&#39;s wonderful.<br> This was a good hunt!</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> I think all this should temporarily solve our problem with food shortage...</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> ...C\xFA Chulainn. Is that spear of yours an ornament?<br> You looked like you slept through the whole thing.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Hmph. I was thinking about lending a hand, but I sniffed something out, so I was thinking about that.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Sniffed something out?</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> See, here comes a big one.<br> Looks like this is its hunting field, too!</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Seeing as how we snatched its prey, it&#39;s not like we can slip away quietly.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> I&#39;ll pay the hunting fees with a thrust of this spear!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Sign:</strong></p><ul><li>The First Ever Happy BBQ Fiesta for Master Fujimaru &amp; Servants -</li></ul><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I&#39;m not opposed to the idea of having a barbecue, considering all the extra meat we got...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> But still, that sign seems very unnecessary...</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> No, no! What&#39;s important is the feel of it,<br> the atmosphere!</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> Hm. Meat roasted over rune fire sure has a unique taste... (munch munch)</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> We were wondering where you went, but didn&#39;t think you&#39;d be off hunting alone... So much for us running around.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> She did come back with a huge deer on her back.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Yes, and now we have so much meat we can&#39;t even finish...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> She already noticed that we were short on food...<br> She&#39;s so amazing...</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> Oh, Master... I cannot believe I did not notice you were starving. Shame on me.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> The next time you cannot bear your hunger any longer, will you please let me know?</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> I am prepared to give up this body anytime for you...<br> I recommend my tail first.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> W-Well, there&#39;s still a lot of meat left right now!</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> That is quite true. Then, here, Master. Please have some deer meat that I slowly roasted with my fire.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> Say, \u201Caah\u201D...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> \u201CRune fire\u201D this, \u201Cmy fire\u201D that...<br> Such unfamiliar terms flying around...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I guess starting a fire is a simple task for those two.</p><p><strong>Kojirou:</strong><br> Well, they are indeed very talented individuals.</p><p><strong>Kojirou:</strong><br> However, does the flavor actually differ depending on the fire used?</p><p><strong>Kojirou:</strong><br> I did try to compare them, but with my unsophisticated palate I could not tell.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I agree...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> M-Maybe it&#39;s just the feel of it...?</p><p><strong>Kojirou:</strong><br> Well then, how about something like this? Karna? (whisper whisper)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...!</p><p><strong>Karna:</strong><br> ...Understood.<br> If that&#39;s what the Master desires... I shall be glad to help.</p><p><strong>Karna:</strong><br> !!!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Eye beams!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> A real hero will roast meat with just their eyes!</p><p><strong>Kojirou:</strong><br> Hahaha.<br> This would be charred meat, not chargrilled meat.</p><p><strong>Kojirou:</strong><br> I tried to add to the types of fires, but dear me.<br> \u201CMore than enough is too much,\u201D I suppose.</p><p><strong>Karna:</strong><br> ...I miscalculated the temperature.<br> I apologize, Master.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> Hey! Do not waste food!</p><p><strong>Kojirou:</strong><br> Oh, Martha has finally put up her fists! That stance isn&#39;t jujitsu... It must be some form of street fighting!</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> Why are you so happy about it!? I&#39;m not going to hit you just because you over-roasted some meat!</p><p><strong>Kojirou:</strong><br> Really?<br> Are you sure?</p><p><strong>Karna:</strong><br> ...I apologize.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> ...Nom, nom.<br> I have to say, all of the meat tastes great.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> But, as a cooking method, barbecue is simply a bit too sloppy. Surely there&#39;s no denying that now?</p><h2 id="section-4-catcher-in-the-farm" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-4-catcher-in-the-farm" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 4: &quot;Catcher in the Farm&quot;</h2><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou, Fooou\u266A</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Fou is in a good mood too.<br> Maybe Fou knows that we&#39;re going to harvest the crops.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Harvest... is a good civilization.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Heh heh, are you copying Altera, Senpai?<br> It does seem like something she would say.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Isn&#39;t it exciting?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes. It has a nice ring, \u201CHarvest.\u201D</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It took us a while to make them, but now that we have some crops, our line of produce has become stable.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> Yes. However, there&#39;s a lot more work ahead for us. First of all, in farming, what&#39;s important is the nitrogen in the soil\u2014</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> (Sc\xE1thach can really become absorbed in things...)</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> (Fou...)</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong><br> Hahaha. Your words tend to slip from my ears, queen of the Land of Shadows.</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong><br> Knights like us couldn&#39;t do anything even if you told us about our grandmother&#39;s secret in farming.</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong><br> We can swing swords, but we knights couldn&#39;t swing a hoe right even if we wanted to. The most we could do is help out with the harvesting where it requires power.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> Humph. It sounds as if you&#39;re calling me a babbling nitpicky old lady...</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> Am I correct, the guardian of Erin?<br> I hope it was me mishearing things... but how about it?</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong><br> Of course not, I would never.<br> However, if that was how you took it, I am to blame.</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong><br> I was told that I was not good at reading the room...<br> Isn&#39;t that right, Diarmuid?</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> Yes... No, um... Yes...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> (He&#39;s struggling over the fact he can&#39;t confirm nor deny the claim!)</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> But Fionn mac Cumhaill, you are a hero of the Celt.<br> I hear you hold some superior wisdom, do you not?</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong><br> As I mentioned earlier, farming is not my specialty.</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong><br> I&#39;m sure if I think hard enough, I could find a way to maintain the crops. However, I did not think of using my thumb for this.</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong><br> If we were facing a serious matter where my wisdom was required, then I would not mind using my thumb of course.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> Hm. Well, if that happens, I&#39;ll look forward to it.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Anyway, the crops have become an important asset to us.

What happened?</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> There are monsters near by! Is it them!?</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> Hmm... I cast runes around the field so no beasts could bring harm to it. It is a mystery indeed.</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong><br> Anyway, we need to rid the enemies before us.<br> Let us investigate after we have defeated them!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> I&#39;ve cut the beast&#39;s bowel open, but I did not find our crops.

It&#39;s an unbelievably condensed DHA reaction not possible on Earth!</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> I don&#39;t know what I&#39;m saying myself, but the analyzing skill obtained from the Wisdom of D\xFAn Sc\xE1ith is telling me that!</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong><br> Phew... Good. Everyone, salmon is very good.<br> Let us all eat salmon.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Normally, blue-backed fish contain a higher percentage of DHA than salmon. But what on earth is this... Salmon of Wisdom...?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> A-Anyway, Fionn.<br> Did you find anything?</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong><br> Yes. First of all... we have firm evidence that some kind of beast destroyed our crops.</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong><br> A clear mind is sensitive to smell as well.<br> The faint smell of an animal can support my claim.</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong><br> There is no mistake. The culprit is a beast, not a human. From the footprints, it is likely a four-legged beast.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou fou!? Fooou!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It&#39;s all right, Fou, nobody thinks you&#39;re the culprit here.</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong><br> And also... Yes, I see, I see.</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong><br> After analyzing everything,<br> we&#39;re only left with one option.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Wow! And what might that be?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Salmon DHA is just awesome...</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong><br> Diarmuid, we must stay up and watch over this crop field. What came before will come again.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> Say that again? ...Yes, my liege.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> You mean... act as a lookout?</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> Wait. Did you find out who the culprit was?</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong><br> No. I did not.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> ...What?</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong><br> The culprit is a beast.<br> But I do not know what kind or where it is right now.</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong><br> So we have to see it with our own eyes...<br> That&#39;s the answer my wisdom has led me to.</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong><br> My wisdom can help me solve mysteries, but it can&#39;t unconditionally tell me something completely unknown.</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong><br> If that were the case, I would have already known about this island or how to get back to Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Well... that&#39;s true.</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong><br> Now wait a minute. You&#39;re thinking that was just a normal conclusion and that I didn&#39;t need to use my Noble Phantasm, aren&#39;t you?</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong><br> ...Wrong. I did need to.</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong><br> We must stay up and watch over the crop field...<br> That was the conclusion I came to after analyzing all the clues. That&#39;s the important part.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Huh? I&#39;m sorry, I still don&#39;t understand...</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong><br> Good grief. Then let me whisper it into your ear.</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong><br> There are many attractive, scantily clad women on this island. It&#39;s not just you and Lady Sc\xE1thach here.</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong><br> To be honest, I was thinking it&#39;s probably about time for me to run into some kind of lady trouble at night.</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong><br> Therefore, I am doing this to also keep us away from the ladies and cool down for a bit. I think.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I-I see...</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> Hey. Do you need help with the lookout?</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong><br> Oh, no, leave this to the glorious Knights of Fianna.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> I see. Then that&#39;s what we shall do.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I don&#39;t really understand... But it seems Fionn and Diarmuid have their own troubles to deal with... I mean, their own way of showing consideration.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> For now, let&#39;s leave it to them for tonight, and come back tomorrow to take a look at the crops, Master.</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> The night is through.<br> I wonder if the field is all right.</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong><br> I see, so that happened.<br> How sad.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> It&#39;s absolutely reprehensible that someone would destroy a field. It&#39;s a felony in my country. Someone is going to have to pay for this.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> Master and I gazed into each others&#39; eyes while we worked on the crops, watching as the pistils and stamens came together...</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> In other words, they were like our children!<br> So to assault them like that... Unforgivable!</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> You wanted anyone who had some free time to come along, but is it really necessary for me to be here?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> I know you&#39;re probably going to say it&#39;s part of a knight&#39;s duties to patrol one&#39;s territory, but...</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> ...But I thought we said just the two of us... Maybe not... Eh, who cares anyway.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> Yep, it doesn&#39;t matter!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> With these numbers, we can handle anything.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Lots of people for a simple field visit...</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou, fou.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes, Master.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> To be fair, we let Fionn and Diarmuid, two people with extensive combat experience, watch over the field.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...As such, this isn&#39;t about bolstering defenses. I think everyone just wants to check on the field since they have a stake in it.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> We&#39;re almost there.<br> Let&#39;s ask those two how things went last night.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...!?</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> H-He&#39;s dead!</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> ...It&#39;s a mortal wound.<br> There&#39;s nothing we can do.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> Looks like he&#39;s barely hanging in there.<br> ...Hey! He&#39;s trying to say something!</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong><br> Oh, it&#39;s you... I&#39;ve made a grave mistake...<br> If they got to me first, no amount of water would...help...</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong><br> Oh... Fionn...</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> ...And what about this one?</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> Diarmuid! Diarmuid Ua Duibhne!<br> Get a hold of yourself!</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> ...Argh...</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> What&#39;s wrong!? Who could&#39;ve done this to a great warrior like yourself!?</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> ...B...</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> B?</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> ...A b-boar...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Fionn... Diarmuid...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> This island has taken yet another life!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I&#39;ve confirmed the departure of both Fionn mac Cumhaill and Diarmuid Ua Duibhne...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Their Spirit Origins are still intact, so I think you can just resummon them when we&#39;re back in Chaldea...</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> We can grieve later.<br> Did you hear what he said with his dying words?</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong><br> If I&#39;m not mistaken... I think he said \u201Cboar.\u201D</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> Yep, he did.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> That&#39;s what I heard as well.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> Boar... As in the animal?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Who knows? The pig-looking mammal...<br> That&#39;s the only kind of boar that came to my mind...</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> Hm? Over there!</p><p><strong>Boar Piglet:</strong><br> ...Oink!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...It&#39;s a boar.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...That it is. Just a regular boar.<br> Cute, in fact...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> So maybe we should call it a boar piglet?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> ...A boar piglet.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes, Master. A cute baby boar...<br> That&#39;d make it a piglet.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> Hm. Piglet or not, it&#39;s still a boar.<br> There&#39;s no question about that.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> ...Don&#39;t tell me that Fionn mac Cumhaill and Diarmuid Ua Duibhne were killed by this thing?</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong><br> That just can&#39;t be, can it?<br> Look at it... So tiny and adorable.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> No. Unfortunately, we have all the evidence we need here. First, this is a crime scene.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> Second, the dying Diarmuid even said himself that the culprit was a boar.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> We have no choice but to suspect the animal. It is the most basic rule of combat to not get fooled by your enemy&#39;s appearance.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> I think it goes without saying, but boars are typically harmful to crops. Their existence won&#39;t be beneficial to us either way.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> That&#39;s true. You often hear of farmers trying hard to drive them off their lands.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> Just because something&#39;s small, doesn&#39;t make it weak.<br> You don&#39;t know until you try.</p><p><strong>Boar Piglet:</strong><br> ... (tremble)</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong><br> Hey! Your scary glaring is making this little one frightened!</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong><br> It&#39;s okay, here, I have some nuts for you.<br> Come on, come on... There&#39;s a good boy.</p><p><strong>Boar Piglet:</strong><br> ...O-Oink...?</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> Don&#39;t do it, Marie! You mustn&#39;t underestimate the strength of a charging boar!</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> It might just be a child, but it&#39;s got meaty...<br> Yes, it&#39;s got meaty legs with a nice layer of fat on top!</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> You need to be careful.<br> We should all surround it and finish it off.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> I agree. If this piglet really did violate the product of love that is our crops, our children, then... Heh, heh.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> We can&#39;t just let it get away, now, can we?<br> How should we cook it? Medium? Rare? Well-done?</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong><br> Come on! Just take a look at its eyes. They&#39;re beautiful eyes. This little one hasn&#39;t done anything wrong!</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong><br> You think so too, right, Master?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You have to punish it for its crimes.</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong><br> You&#39;re going to go that far too, Master?<br> Boo...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Boar piglets sure are cute...</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong><br> Right? Aren&#39;t they?</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong><br> ...Oh! Of course! If there was something to feel guilty about, it would have run far away from here by now!</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong><br> The fact that it&#39;s sitting here like this is all the proof you need that it&#39;s innocent\u2014</p><p><strong>Boar Piglet:</strong><br> O... Oink!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> What were you saying? It&#39;s running off at full speed!</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> What acceleration!<br> I&#39;m not going to underestimate you, piglet!</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> ...Hmm? There must be a reason for its flight.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> GURRR...!</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> Monsters at a time like this!? The piglet must have been driven away by their stench and murderous aura!</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> In any event, we can&#39;t let it get away with destroying our field. We&#39;ll pursue it once we take care of these beasts!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> ...\u201CSplit up and look for it,\u201D huh...</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> This is a pretty big island. If we lost sight of it during the battle then who knows how far it&#39;s gone...</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> Father\u2013I mean King Arthur\u2013seriously works other people too hard. I guess he really doesn&#39;t understand people&#39;s feelings... Yep yep.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> Ya know what, I am done! What&#39;s the point of looking this hard anyway? It&#39;s not like I&#39;m gonna get rewarded or anything!</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> I&#39;m just gonna go back and say I couldn&#39;t find anything... Hmm?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> What&#39;s that in the bushes?</p><p><strong>Boar Piglet:</strong><br> Oink...!?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> ...Looky here! Got ya!</p><p><strong>Boar Piglet:</strong><br> ... (tremble)</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Boar Piglet:</strong><br> ... (tremble tremble)</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> ... (Glance)</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> Oh, so what?<br> You know me or something?</p><p><strong>Boar Piglet:</strong><br> ...?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> Hah! If you don&#39;t then make sure you remember this name. I am the Treacherous Knight, Mordred.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> A disgusting order from a disgusting king...<br> Of course I&#39;m gonna rebel against it!</p><p><strong>Boar Piglet:</strong><br> Oink... (hug)</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> Oh, you&#39;re surprisingly soft...</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> All right! Feels great to ignore the king&#39;s orders!<br> Maybe I&#39;ll head to the beach and ride some waves!</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> Oh yeah, I got some nuts from Marie to help lure out the target, but I don&#39;t need them at all.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> I guess I&#39;ll get rid of them here.</p><p><strong>Boar Piglet:</strong><br> Oink... (Sniff, sniff)</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> Someone or something might just find these and eat them, but oh well, I don&#39;t care. I suppose doing so will fill them up a bit, though...</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> Don&#39;t come to the field again, got that?<br> Well, I&#39;m just talking to myself. See ya.</p><p><strong>Boar Piglet:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> I see, I see... So that&#39;s what happened while I was relaxing on the beach.</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> I suppose that means I have no choice but to help you watch the field.</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong><br> I don&#39;t know a lot about how things work on land, but can&#39;t we just harvest the rest of the crops?</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> We might be able to do that now, but if our next patch of crops also gets eaten then we&#39;ll be in trouble.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> We either need to eliminate the root cause completely...<br> Or come up with a solid defense.</p><p><strong>Anne:</strong><br> So we need to think about the future, huh?<br> That makes sense, I guess.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> It&#39;s true, we can&#39;t ignore this issue. Although I do question your story about how those two got defeated by boars...</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong><br> Exactly. I still don&#39;t believe these little ones are the culprits. I am here to prove that.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> I&#39;ll tell you again: you shouldn&#39;t underestimate boars.<br> I remember there was once a terrifying boar in Britain.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I just remembered.<br> The reason Diarmuid died in his legend was also...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...Gored by a boar... So it&#39;s his second time, huh?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> He&#39;s famous for being a hero killed by boars...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...No. For the sake of Diarmuid&#39;s honor, let&#39;s not talk about things we can&#39;t be sure about.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It&#39;s not certain that he really was killed by a boar, anyway.</p><p><strong>Anne:</strong><br> Hmm... I was just thinking about C\xFA Chulainn&#39;s face when he said, \u201CI&#39;m going to protect our base. You handle the field.\u201D</p><p><strong>Anne:</strong><br> Did you see it?</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong><br> Yeah. He had a sad look in his eyes.</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong><br> It&#39;s like they were saying, \u201CIf I, a fellow Celtic male, were to defeat that boar... it would cause him great shame...\u201D</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> He may look violent, but he can be quite nice...<br> And compared to him, that stupid samurai...!</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> \u201CA boar? It doesn&#39;t clone itself, or go backwards in time, or split space or anything like that, right?\u201D</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> \u201CI&#39;m not interested in it at all.\u201D</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> He doesn&#39;t care about his friends at all, does he!?</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> ...Everyone, enough talking.<br> Something&#39;s getting closer.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> ...I&#39;m certain it&#39;s something that wants to destroy this symbol of the love between Master and me.</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> Hmm. So it&#39;s here, huh?</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> Even a fancy lady like me can be a little bit of a wild animal at night!</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> In other words... it&#39;s hunting time.<br> Let&#39;s get rid of this pest!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That&#39;s...!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I knew it!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> But I believed in you...!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Foufou!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> What&#39;s wrong, Fou? I know you&#39;re excited to be around another small animal, but...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Wait? Huh?</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> There&#39;s more than one!?</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong><br> Oh my! They&#39;re even cuter when there&#39;s more of them!</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> Yes! I smell blood in the water!<br> ...Hmm?</p><p><strong>Anne:</strong><br> Wait. Something seems strange.</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong><br> They&#39;re all lining up on top of each other...It&#39;s as if they&#39;re protecting our field, isn&#39;t it?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> Wait! Something else is here!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Something jumped out and knocked down the wall of boar piglets!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Is that...</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Grwaaffhh!</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> Well, well... It&#39;s a demon boar.<br> A regular boar with a demon inside.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> ...A demon boar?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Is that what attacked Diarmuid?</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> It&#39;s very likely, Master.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> From the looks of it, it has enough power to be a match for a Servant.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> If they were caught off guard, even the two Knights of Fianna could be defeated.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> It looks like it wants to eat us!</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> Do you see now why I told you not to underestimate boars, Master?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Demon boars... They don&#39;t show up as often as dragons, but they are common creatures in heroes&#39; stories.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> Indeed. Demon boars are trials for a hero. Heroes who aren&#39;t strong enough are killed without mercy.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> I used to send my own students up against them all the time.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> They&#39;re a very eco-friendly enemy, because you can eat them once they&#39;re dead.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> The one in front of us right now has a little too much fat to be a good opponent, though...</p><p><strong>Boar Piglet:</strong><br> Oink!</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong><br> Oh... no! Stop bullying them, you meanie!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Marie went to fight it!<br> We have to go, too!</p><p><strong>Demon Boar:</strong><br> GRRRRAAAARGH...?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> Look at those scraps of food around its mouth.<br> Those are from our field, right?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> It seems the thing that ransacked our field just confessed.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> And it looks like it wants to eat us, too!</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> Bring it on! If it wants a fight I&#39;ll smash it into the freaking sky! ...Uh, I mean... yeah.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> Unfortunately, I must resist against your act of violence. The reward for sinning is death, haven&#39;t you heard?</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> Begone! If you will not, I will show you a new meaning to \u201CBible thumping\u201D!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> It&#39;s quite powerful, however...</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> Hahh!</p><p><strong>Demon Boar:</strong><br> GRRRRAAAARGH... GRRRAAAARTHUR...</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> ...? Did it just...?<br> Did I imagine that?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Good work, everyone!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> That&#39;s the end for that boar!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Hehe.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> What is it?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Oh, nothing. I was just thinking how that&#39;s something the doctor would say...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It just reminded me...<br> I haven&#39;t heard his voice in a long while.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Oh, no. It isn&#39;t anything that serious.<br> I mean, we will be off the island soon anyway.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Really, he just popped into my head somehow, that&#39;s all... In any event, we were able to protect the field, so we have no problems here.</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong><br> Yes, Mash. It was pretty strong, but I&#39;m glad we won.<br> To think there are boars like that on this island...</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> ...I am sorry, Marie.<br> You were correct.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> I have to apologize too. We jumped to conclusions and assumed the boar piglets were the culprits.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> Knowing you&#39;re wrong and not admitting to it is the same as lying. And I hate lying.</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong><br> Hehehe. It doesn&#39;t bother me.</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong><br> And if you&#39;re going to apologize, apologize to the little ones you chased... Huh?</p><p><strong>Boar Piglet:</strong><br> Oink, oiiiink!</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong><br> Oh my! Oh my! Hehehe!</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong><br> Oh, that&#39;s right... You were protecting our crops from the demon boar, weren&#39;t you?</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong><br> You knew you couldn&#39;t win, and you still tried your hardest anyway... Why?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> Probably because you gave them food yesterday, right?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> That demon boar must&#39;ve been preventing them from getting any food. They would&#39;ve been starving.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> So they felt like they owed you one...<br> Hah. It&#39;s like they&#39;re knights or something, huh?</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong><br> They seem to like you, too.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> Wh-Whatever! I don&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking about! Go on, get lost! Shoo! Shoo!</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> Hmm... Still, boar piglets are wild animals.<br> They&#39;re a threat to our crops, too.</p><p><strong>Boar Piglet:</strong><br> Oink oink!?</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> But look.<br> It seems like they kind of understand human speech.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> We may not have to exterminate them after all; we can use them instead. Let me try this...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> What&#39;s she doing, crouching down in front of them like that?</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> ...The deal is made. The contract is sealed.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Y-You can talk to them!?</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> All I&#39;m doing is imitating Animal Communication.<br> The most I can do is get the general feeling.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> It&#39;s similar to what you do with that white creature.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Well, I kind of get the feeling that I can understand what Fou says... sometimes...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> What do you mean by \u201Ccontract\u201D?</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> They will leave our field alone.<br> And when we&#39;re not here, they&#39;ll watch over it.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> If another threat like that demon boar shows up, they&#39;ll tell us immediately. They&#39;ll be a warning system.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> In exchange, we&#39;ll give them food. ...What do you say, Master? We can still call the whole thing off...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Sounds good to me.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> They&#39;re our new friends on this island.</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong><br> Oh my! I think that&#39;s wonderful!<br> That means I can pet them all I want, right?</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> I&#39;m all right with it too.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> Giant boars who eat our crops are one thing, but little boar piglets? I&#39;m willing to leave them alone.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> Me? I... I don&#39;t care. It&#39;s your decision, Master.<br> Don&#39;t ask me.</p><p><strong>Boar Piglet:</strong><br> Oink! Oink\u266A</p><p><strong>Anne:</strong><br> So instead of watchdogs, we&#39;ve got watch-boars?<br> I&#39;m okay with that.</p><p><strong>Anne:</strong><br> A ship without rowers isn&#39;t going anywhere, they say.</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong><br> If Anne and you are okay with it, Master, then so am I.</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong><br> (...It makes me feel so much safer to have a ready source of protein nearby...)</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> Yes, we&#39;ve made some very cute friends.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> (He did say, after all, that there were no forbidden foods.

But...</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> I&#39;m sorry. There&#39;s one thing I want to make clear...</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> ...Foxes prey on boar piglets.</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> At certain times, and in certain conditions... for example, if I was starving and one of them was defenselessly waddling right past me...</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> I might suddenly find my mouth filled with delicious meat juice! Mmm, so good... I&#39;d better share this with Master... (Gasp!)</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> Something like that might happen, so do be careful, okay?</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> You see, I&#39;m in summer mode right now, so I&#39;m even more elegant and more of a beast than usual!</p><p><strong>Boar Piglet:</strong><br> O-Oink...!</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> ...That&#39;s right. I should apologize to you.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> Boar piglet, I apologize for chasing you for a crime you didn&#39;t commit.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> Your courage when you fought that huge boar was real. You deserve praise.</p><p><strong>Boar Piglet:</strong><br> Oink?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Altria...</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> I hope we&#39;ll get along.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> Don&#39;t be ashamed because the demon boar was oppressing you.

They ran away again...<br> You mustn&#39;t scare them like that.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> I&#39;m sorry. I just said what I was honestly thinking when I saw them, and...</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> Either way, our field is safe now.<br> Let&#39;s get back to work.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Is there a problem?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Let&#39;s eat when we get back.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> N-No, Master! I don&#39;t just think about food all the time.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> I was just thinking that this island is huge.<br> There may be more than one boar.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> This might not be the end.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> I hope I&#39;m wrong, but please keep that in mind\u2014</p><h2 id="section-5-island-detox" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-5-island-detox" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 5: &quot;Island Detox&quot;</h2><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> We&#39;ve got a small elite force today, huh?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> You said there was something we had to check...<br> What did you mean, Sc\xE1thach?</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> Yes. It&#39;s due to a report from that one over there.</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong><br> Me?</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> ...No, the one in your arms.</p><p><strong>Boar Piglet:</strong><br> Oink, oink.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Foou.

I couldn&#39;t just ignore that information.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> Somehow I always manage to scare the piglets away just by looking at them.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> It&#39;d be quite troublesome to have my guide always run away from me, obviously. That&#39;s why I brought you here.</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong><br> I see... You are very beautiful, but you always have this stern look on your face.</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong><br> I&#39;m sure that&#39;s just how warriors and knights are, but you&#39;re wearing a swimsuit now. You should smile.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> She said what we&#39;re all thinking!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I was thinking the same thing... Somehow she still has a very intimidating look even though she&#39;s in a swimsuit.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I guess Sc\xE1thach will be the same no matter where she goes.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Also, I think she&#39;s still treating the boar piglets like some kind of vermin...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> But I like it. I want her to glare at me.</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong><br> Is that how it works?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Senpai...</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou...</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong><br> ...You&#39;re the Queen of the Land of Shadows.</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong><br> With the amount of responsibility you have, I think you&#39;d be much better off smiling more.</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong><br> Oh... Perhaps it&#39;s because I&#39;ve never ruled a nation? Would I be more like you if I did?</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> It&#39;s just who I am... There&#39;s nothing I can do.<br> I was, after all, a gatekeeper.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> The Land of Shadows gets all kinds of nasty visitors.<br> It was my job to drive them away.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> Besides, there are different kinds of queens out there. Medb, for example, is more similar to you than me.</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong><br> Medb looks like she&#39;s having fun every day.<br> I actually quite like her.</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong><br> But all her talk about love... might just be a little too difficult for me to understand...</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> By the way, what am I doing here?<br> I mean, if I have a role to play, I don&#39;t mind, but still...</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> Oh, there may be something I want to ask you to do.<br> You might be better suited for it than me.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> Better suited for it... Do you mean something that needs bare hands, not a spear?</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> I see... So someone you want to hurt, but not kill...<br> Yes. We shall not commit murder.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> Or maybe it&#39;s a holy oil death match, where you&#39;re not allowed to use weapons...</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> Hehe... I can&#39;t wait...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Boar Piglet:</strong><br> Oink!</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong><br> Looks like we&#39;re close.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I can smell something in the wind...<br> A pungent, rotten odor. Let&#39;s go.</p><p><strong>Boar Piglet:</strong><br> Oink-oink!</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> I see. So that&#39;s it?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> A poisonous-looking... puddle?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> It&#39;s a damage zone...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes, Master.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It&#39;s only about the size of a manhole... but it&#39;s causing all the plants in the area to wilt.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That&#39;s where the stench is coming from, too.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> Master, you&#39;ll probably be okay, but don&#39;t breathe too much in.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> That&#39;s poisonous ground.<br> The miasma from it could rot a normal person&#39;s lungs.</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong><br> So this is what the boar piglets told us about, huh?<br> But where did it come from?</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> Oh... There are enemies nearby.<br> Think they&#39;re the cause?</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> No, the miasma probably just brought them here.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> They&#39;re all ones we&#39;ve seen before anyway.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes. I don&#39;t think any of them could have created this poison.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> What&#39;s the cause, you think?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I don&#39;t know...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> For now, we need to get rid of them before we can look into this.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Let&#39;s chase them off, Master!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> I see, so that&#39;s why you brought me here.<br> You want me to purify this place.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> I don&#39;t know if it can be done, but let me try.<br> First I&#39;ll sprinkle a little holy water...</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> ...Hmm, how about this.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That&#39;s amazing! The poisonous puddles are disappearing... The stench in the air is clearing up too!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Nice purification!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> How much do you charge for your holy water, Martha?</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> I can give you as much as you want, but what&#39;s more important is faith.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> Without faith, the water is meaningless.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fouu!</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> Obviously, a withered plant could not be revived. Unfortunate as it is...</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> But something else will take root again in this place now, and surely bloom.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> That poisonous ground was meant to molder the island&#39;s land. It was fortunate that we could purify it this early.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> I feared that, if neglected, the island would have transformed into a land of death that could not grow a single weed in the end.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> At the very least, this island is rich in its natural resources. I cannot see them all gone to waste.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> ...I can&#39;t believe this. Not only are you asking others to take care of the monsters for you, you&#39;re even asking the same people to take care of your environment?</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> I don&#39;t know if the ruler has forgotten about this island or just abandoned it, but I just added one more entry to the list of items I want to complain about.</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong><br> Huh? Where are you going, little one?</p><p><strong>Boar Piglet:</strong><br> Hoink, oink! ...Oi?</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> Selfish behavior will only lead to your own demise.<br> What are you after? Tell me, look me in the eyes and spit everything out.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Er, pointing your spear is a bit excessive, no?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Don&#39;t be a hero that kills with your eyes!</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> ...Ugh! How base of me. I still have the notion that boars are vermin. Well, they actually are, but...</p><p><strong>Boar Piglet:</strong><br> Oi...oi!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fouu. Fou, Foou!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Oh no... Not you too, Fou!<br> I&#39;ll go after them.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...? Oh, I see.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Judging from Fou&#39;s behavior, it doesn&#39;t look like the boar piglet was trying to flee.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It seems there&#39;s another place the piglet wanted to take us to. In other words, another place plagued by the poison.</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou!? Fou... (Blech)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Ugh... What&#39;s going on here!?<br> The miasma has spread wider than the previous place.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The entire area has been completely transformed into a poisonous swamp!</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong><br> How terrible! The air in the Palace of Versailles was considerably poisonous, but this is even worse.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> To accumulate this much poison... What!?<br> Ya wanna mess with a holy maiden!?</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> ...Keep your voice down.<br> Be cautious, we are not the only ones here.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Yeah. An eerie dripping sound...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I have another bad feeling about this...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Oh, take a look over there, Master.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I can see something rolling in the swamp. Could it be some animal that was affected by the miasma?</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong><br> No, that&#39;s not it...</p><p><strong>Boar Piglet:</strong><br> Oink!?</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong><br> A demon boar! They&#39;re still around!</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> That must be a mud bath. Something boars do to remove the dirt and parasites from their bodies.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> That place is called a marshy field. Those conditions are said to be the etymology for the expression \u201Cwrithe in agony\u201D in the Far East.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> S-So knowledgeable!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Tell me more! Ms. Sc\xE1thach!</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> If the poisonous swamp created the marshy field for that thing... Wait, it&#39;s the opposite. It was that rolling around on the ground that created the swamp.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> The puddle we ran into earlier was a mere coincidence.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> This is the real thing. That monster will come back here again and again. I guess you can call this place its favorite bathtub.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> Either way, poison is produced from that thing&#39;s body right?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> In that case, the true culprit behind this land of poison, the one the boar piglets wanted to show us was...</p><p><strong>Demon Boar:</strong><br> Grr... Grrrph!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It noticed me!</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> Hmm, a demon boar that releases poison from its body...</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> I won&#39;t say anything if you catch prey or do something else with that.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> However, I cannot overlook how you&#39;ve ruined and eroded this island, since that is an act that violates our lives here.</p><p><strong>Demon Boar:</strong><br> Grr, grrrph!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Demon Boar:</strong><br> Ghhhaa...!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It could be problematic if there are more boars like that who can produce miasma and corrupt this island...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Eventually we might have to do this all over again.</p><p><strong>Boar Piglet:</strong><br> Oinkkyy...</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> All right then. First let&#39;s do something about this impure swamp first. Here&#39;s some holy water, then...</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> What!? I can&#39;t purify it!?<br> My prayers haven&#39;t been heard, hmm!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> ...Ahem. Sorry you had to see that.<br> It seems I didn&#39;t pray enough to prove my faith.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> I&#39;m sure it&#39;s because I was using the coastal rocks as punching bags to train myself...</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> And ended up changing the landscape a bit because I was going at it too hard... Please forgive me...</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong><br> In other words, you can&#39;t make this place beautiful again?</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> The previous one was rather small in scale, but this one&#39;s corrosion is too severe... I can&#39;t get rid of it.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> If it&#39;s impossible for Martha...searching for a different way isn&#39;t going to help...</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> Hmm... Yes, it will be difficult, but it&#39;s better than doing nothing. Here, let me help.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> I happen to have these ash tree seeds with me. I&#39;ll make it so that they grow by absorbing the poison in the ground.</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong><br> Those seeds will clean up the surface, you say?<br> How wonderful!</p><p><strong>Boar Piglet:</strong><br> Oiiink!</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> The effects won&#39;t be immediate, though.<br> As Martha said, the poison is deep.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> Plants also take large amounts of time to grow strongly. If you rush things, they will lose to the miasma and quickly wither away.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> They need to carefully absorb each drop of poison, slowly but surely. It&#39;ll take a long, long time...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Exactly how long is a \u201Clong, long time\u201D?</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> Well, roughly 1,000 years?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> That&#39;s long!</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> But, in that case, the land will eventually be able to return to its original state.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> Only the next best strategy can be taken if nothing can be done immediately.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> If we combine her holy water with these seeds, we&#39;ll at least be able to prevent the poisonous swamp from expanding any more than now.</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong><br> Right. It&#39;s better than doing nothing, surely.<br> We may not be around anymore at that time though.</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong><br> Since we&#39;re guests here, it would be a form of giving back to the island, no? To take back its future, so to speak.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes. I think that&#39;s a wonderful prospect.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou, fou.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> Then, let&#39;s get to work. It&#39;ll be our first job; one worth commemorating later.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> Hmm. It would be safe to say that there are still demon boars around.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> Fortunately, however, we still have a few ash tree seeds.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> If we find more poisonous swamps like this, or more other demon boars that produce them,</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> we&#39;ll need to deal with them in the future too.<br> Try not to miss any, Master...!</p><h2 id="section-6-village" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-6-village" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 6: &quot;Village&quot;</h2><p><strong>Marie:</strong><br> Phew, playing with beach balls is fun, but I&#39;m a bit tired.

Maybe I&#39;ll go ride some waves!</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> Now, there are still many tasks left for us to do.<br> Which one shall we start with... Heh heh...</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> ...Hmm? What is with this feeling of excitement?</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> Perhaps it&#39;s the sea, the beach, and the shining sun.<br> This is rare indeed...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It appears that everyone is starting to get used to life on this island.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> At first, everything was inconvenient and everyone was feeling dissatisfied, but maybe now all the hard work has finally paid off.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> However... something strange has been happening.

It&#39;s a holy and sacred act of confirmation!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> You know, that just makes you sound even more nosy...</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> They&#39;re moving deeper and deeper into the island...</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> Looks like they&#39;re trying not to get noticed. That can only mean... they are trying to do something suspicious...</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> Let&#39;s be cautious. We can follow their trail even if we lose visual. More importantly, we don&#39;t want them to find out they&#39;re being stalked.</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> There must be a reason for them to be this secretive...</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> I don&#39;t want to know what would happen if they found out that we are...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Don&#39;t scare me.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> We&#39;re all allies... RIGHT!?</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> You&#39;re too naive!<br> Even more naive than a baby!</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> I&#39;ve been paying attention to see if there are any traps along the way and here you are, being naive.</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> Listen, Master. Don&#39;t you ever underestimate the lengths which men with a guilty conscience will go to.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> You are exactly right. Yes, they will run away... lie to you... It truly is... terrible...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> (I&#39;m getting chills down my spine!)</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> Somehow I&#39;ve lost sight of them. It&#39;s not like we can&#39;t track them anymore, but there&#39;s one problem...</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> Even if there are no traps, it looks like there is a gatekeeper... You there! Isn&#39;t that right?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...!</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> Come out, whoever you are!<br> I know you are there!</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> I see... very impressive.<br> Then allow me to show myself...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Th-This voice is...!</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> This voice... It can&#39;t be...!</p><p><strong>E\uFF1A???:</strong><br> My name is... Island Mask!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...Oh. No. Who. Can. It. Be.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> What are you doing, Mr. Swallow Reversal?</p><p><strong>E\uFF1A???:</strong><br> My name is Island Mask. I have no relationship with that refined swordsman and renowned gatekeeper.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> ...Oh, um, okay. Look.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> You can call yourself whatever you want.<br> I don&#39;t care.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> But that getup... It&#39;s basically a sign that I can punch your face in until your mask breaks, right?</p><p><strong>Island Mask:</strong><br> Hahaha. Only you, Lady Martha, would get that kind of impression upon seeing this mask!</p><p><strong>Island Mask:</strong><br> Unfortunately, it&#39;s something that I borrowed, so I must ask you not to break it. And while I&#39;m at it, I&#39;ll add that I&#39;d rather you not punch me with those gauntlets of yours.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> I see. Well then I&#39;ll aim solely for your stomach. I&#39;ll punch it so hard you won&#39;t be able to digest anything for three days. Just think of it as fasting.</p><p><strong>Island Mask:</strong><br> So it has come to this. I suppose you are a holy maiden who educates others with an iron fist.</p><p><strong>Island Mask:</strong><br> Well, be that as it may,<br> a gatekeeper must perform his duty.</p><p><strong>Island Mask:</strong><br> You may only go through once you have defeated me... That is what I am trying to say.</p><p><strong>Island Mask:</strong><br> I am the great forest incarnate. An enigma.<br> My existence transcends good and evil, and so forth.</p><p><strong>Island Mask:</strong><br> In short, do not hold back on me.<br> Come, Lady Martha, come at me!</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> So, seeing me in my swimsuit, all out of control, has made him lose control as well?</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> What a sinful holy maiden you are!<br> You must be kind of be happy to be that sought after?</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> Huh? Well, um...<br> Maybe this bikini is a little too attractive?</p><p><strong>Island Mask:</strong><br> Oh no, I do not desire you in any way. What I truly desire is the armored dragon Tarasque, you know?</p><p><strong>Island Mask:</strong><br> Now, hurry! Bring that towering and intimidating Tarasque before me... HURRY! (Excited)</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> That does it! I won&#39;t pull any punches!<br> I will face you as if I am facing an angel!</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> As you wish! The emptiness of conflict... I will hammer that concept into your bones with this iron fist!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Kojirou:</strong><br> Ugh!</p><p><strong>Tarasque:</strong><br> Boss! Why are you getting all salty with me too!?</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> Oh, sorry, Tarasque. I sorta lost my cool and kinda went with it. Sorry, tee hee\u2606</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> No. Way. It&#39;s. Sasaki. Kojirou. (Deadpan)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Island Mask, defeated!</p><p><strong>Kojirou:</strong><br> ...Hah. Heh heh. Well well, I&#39;ve lost.<br> I&#39;ve lost to you completely.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> ...Satisfied? Now I&#39;ll ask you again...<br> What were you trying to do?</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> As the victor... I mean, as the one preaching God&#39;s words on the emptiness of conflict, I think I have the right to ask.</p><p><strong>Kojirou:</strong><br> I... I...</p><p><strong>Kojirou:</strong><br> I WANTED TO PLAY, TOO!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Huh!?</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> ...Come again?</p><p><strong>Kojirou:</strong><br> It&#39;s summer! We&#39;re on a deserted island! As someone who appreciates elegance, of course I wanted to enjoy this occasion!</p><p><strong>Kojirou:</strong><br> I was thinking it should be okay for me to go wild for a bit... But unlike you, my friends...</p><p><strong>Kojirou:</strong><br> I was not given the privilege to go wild in a swimsuit!</p><p><strong>Kojirou:</strong><br> Why, you ask? Because I am a mere 1-star Servant.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...I feel like I just heard something I shouldn&#39;t...</p><p><strong>Kojirou:</strong><br> Therefore I was left with no other choice but to transform and add excitement to the occasion. That was the purpose of the mask... you know? YOU KNOW?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> By the way, where did that mask come from...?</p><p><strong>Kojirou:</strong><br> Heh. You would know nothing about it, my Master... About the zealous union of us common Heroic Spirits! The 1 Star Alliance!</p><p><strong>Kojirou:</strong><br> This mask was handed to me by Lord Amadeus.<br> He told me to use it \u201Cif something comes up.\u201D</p><p><strong>Kojirou:</strong><br> Lady Martha&#39;s fist shattered it...but it was the symbol of our determination...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I see... I&#39;m just glad it wasn&#39;t Spartacus&#39;s mask...</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> Fine. I do understand that you wanted to vent your frustration and regret...</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> However, let me ask you one more time.<br> Why did you get in our way?</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> The men that went on ahead weren&#39;t common rarity, right? In that case, you didn&#39;t have the obligation to help them, now did you?</p><p><strong>Kojirou:</strong><br> Hmm. I asked them to hire me since I thought it&#39;d be a nice chance for Island Mask to play a part...</p><p><strong>Kojirou:</strong><br> But I think it would be easier for me to show you what I mean rather than tell you.</p><p><strong>Kojirou:</strong><br> A defeated gatekeeper has no choice.<br> I will show you the way.</p><p><strong>Kojirou:</strong><br> ...We might run into some monsters along the way, but that won&#39;t pose any issue for you, now will it, Master?</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Karna:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Huh? Hey, bodyguard, what are you doing?<br> Why the hell would you bring them here?</p><p><strong>Kojirou:</strong><br> I apologize. I was having too much fun fighting and I lost.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Tch. Well, it was only a matter of time until they found out about this place...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Th-This is...!</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> This place...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> There are buildings...?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> And a crop field...?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That&#39;s right, Master. It&#39;s on a smaller scale... but it looks just like our village.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Well, the cat&#39;s out of the bag now.<br> This is a village created just for the men.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> They got buildings and even a crop field. Although the direction they went in is slightly different than ours.</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> Hmm... Hmmmmm... This place is more organized than I thought. Some structures are even built better than ours...</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> I do feel like we&#39;ve lost a game...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> But why would you hide this place?</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> It has to be hidden.<br> You see, boys do like their little secret bases, right?</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Although the place you guys got there is getting a lot more convenient than here.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Either way, Diarmuid, Fionn, and I talked about how building a village with our own hands would also serve as good training.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> And so, even with those guys gone, we&#39;ve decided to continue building this place in secret.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> How should I put it... Fionn said it best...</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> It makes us feel nervous when there are girls in swimsuits around all the time.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Uncle Fergus, on the other hand, would&#39;ve loved that place. He&#39;d do as he pleased, without a care in the world.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I see... Does this village have a name?</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Hmm? Well, it&#39;s...</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Both Fionn and Diarmuid entrusted their dying wish to us.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> In order to honor the noble Lancers who built this place, we call it... \u201CBackspear Village.\u201D</p><p><strong>Kojirou:</strong><br> Heh heh. I am just a farmer with a hoe, a support member if you will.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...So a spin on your boy band name.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Hahaha, that&#39;s a funny joke you got there.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Still, if even the ever-calm Karna would go wild with the base, we might be able to create some good tunes there.</p><p><strong>Karna:</strong><br> I will shred the bassline like a wild beast\u2013whatever that means\u2013and tear into my Master&#39;s enemies.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> It&#39;s just a joke. Well, I&#39;m sure there&#39;s a version of me who&#39;s in a band somewhere.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> But that&#39;s a different me,<br> and a different Backspear Boys.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> We are the summer edition of Backspear, and we&#39;ll be burning up the charts all summer long!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I feel like C\xFA Chulainn is just blurting nonsense right now.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> All I got is that the men here are really enjoying themselves.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> This place is their haven, their paradise.<br> Let&#39;s leave it alone for now.</p><h2 id="section-7-tusk" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-7-tusk" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 7: &quot;Tusk&quot;</h2><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> We&#39;ve gathered a lot of materials.<br> If we keep it up, we&#39;ll be able to build a statue soon.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> Hmm. I still don&#39;t see the point, to be honest...</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> However... We already made that decision as a whole.</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong><br> We&#39;ve entered the final phase of preparations for construction of our escape ship.</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong><br> A statue is a beacon of hope; it&#39;ll keep morale up.<br> I think it&#39;s important we build one.</p><p><strong>Anne:</strong><br> Could it be like the figurehead placed in front of ships to pray for safe sailing...?</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> That&#39;s right. Giving form to our determination will make it easier to rally everyone together.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> But most of all, it gives us something to offer our prayers to.</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> Hee. Prayers and beliefs? That&#39;s where I come in! I&#39;m pretty sure it&#39;s obvious what kind of statue we want to build, right?</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> Well, Master will have the final decision.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> It&#39;s too embarrassing to see my own statue, so no thanks.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> Although, if Master were to secretly carve a small wooden bust of me and sleep with it every night... Ehehehe, just thinking about it makes me excited.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> That statue would serve the same purpose as a war god statue right? In that case, shouldn&#39;t we base it on the most powerful one here? I ain&#39;t gonna tell you who, though.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...It&#39;ll be quite an undertaking\u2013one that will really change the island&#39;s appearance.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Please take your time and choose carefully, Master.<br> Now, let&#39;s start the preparations\u2014</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...!</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> That&#39;s...!</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> ...I see. The big boss is here.</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong><br> An unbelievably huge enemy! It&#39;s on its way here!</p><p><strong>H\uFF1A???:</strong><br> GRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRF!!!</p><p><strong>Boar Piglet:</strong><br> O-Oink...!?</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong><br> The boar piglets are panicking!<br> I can&#39;t blame them, what with all this pressure...</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> Damn, the big one decided to show up now, huh?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> All the other demonic boars must be its young!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Who are you!? State your name!</p><p><strong>H\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Grrrhhahahahaha...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It&#39;s laughing... It can understand us?<br> ...No, it must be my imagination...</p><p><strong>Karna:</strong><br> That towering body... It&#39;s just as intimidating as Varaha&#39;s, the avatar of Vishnu...</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> That thing is evil. You can tell just by looking at it.<br> Just an evil creature, nothing more.</p><p><strong>Kojirou:</strong><br> We need to take it down.<br> That goes without saying.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> The fact that the existence of such a creature is even allowed is just... Ugh.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> This island must have some sort of protection. Without it, the demonic boars would&#39;ve sunk it a long time ago.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> The land here provided such wonderful foundations, yet it is now abandoned. I truly want to express my anger to the ruler of this island.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> Such evil, allowed to run rampant... Only my homeland could match the extent to which... Hmm?</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> Hey, you! We&#39;re about to start work on our giant Tamamo statue! One that&#39;ll live on in the annals of history!</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> That massive body of yours will cast a shadow over its construction! You&#39;re a giant nuisance!</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> Well, I quite like it.<br> A huge body like that is worth punching!</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong><br> In the end, you are just a king that is oppressing these boar piglets, right?</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong><br> You&#39;re so big and you look so strong, yet the way you treat these little ones... I can&#39;t forgive it. Shame on you!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> There is no choice left but to fight.<br> Let&#39;s go, Master!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Gaaaaah!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It went into the ocean and fled as fast as it could!?</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> It sure is a stubborn creature. As resistant as its hide.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> ...However, we have hurt it pretty badly.<br> It won&#39;t meddle with us for a while.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Let&#39;s hurry up and finish that escape ship.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Hopefully it will never come back...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I agree. We might need to speed up our schedule.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Luckily, it seems like construction is almost complete... Right, Sc\xE1thach?</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Sc\xE1thach?</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> ...Hmm? Oh, uh, right.<br> Soon. Well, let&#39;s go back to work...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...?</p><h2 id="final-section-farewell-beloved-uninhabited-island" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#final-section-farewell-beloved-uninhabited-island" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Final Section: &quot;Farewell, Beloved Uninhabited Island&quot;</h2><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> Hmm. That should do it.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> We... we finished!<br> We finally finished the escape ship, Master!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou, Foou!</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> It was a pretty long, hard journey.<br> I have no other way to describe it.</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong><br> I think it&#39;s a good ship. Although we really won&#39;t know how she handles the sea until we take her out.</p><p><strong>Anne:</strong><br> Don&#39;t worry about who&#39;ll take the helm either.<br> You can leave that to us.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> This time I am going on a cruise with Master...<br> Romance on the high seas... Hee hee hee...</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> Oh that reminds me! We have to do that at the bow! What was it...? Right, that Titanic thing!</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> Come on, let&#39;s do that together, dear!<br> Oh, you don&#39;t have to embarrassed about it!</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> Wouldn&#39;t it be cooler if we stuck some metal plates onto this thing? Some horns...or maybe spikes?</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> I guess our fun vacation is about to end.</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> Oh well, it doesn&#39;t matter. I&#39;m sure the image of my beautiful summer self has been seared into my Master&#39;s mind.</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> Once we&#39;re back in Chaldea, I will activate my secret move: Tamamo Subliminal Message! Master won&#39;t be able to rest again without seeing swimsuits!</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> ...Hmm? Hehe, the boar piglets seem to be happy for us.</p><p><strong>Boar Piglet:</strong><br> Oink, oink, oink!</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong><br> Well. It&#39;s almost as if they are all clapping.<br> Thank you...</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong><br> Say, Sc\xE1thach?<br> Can&#39;t these little ones ride with us?</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> Impossible.<br> I didn&#39;t design this ship with their numbers in mind.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> I&#39;ve cast runes on the ship&#39;s body so it may adapt to all kinds of situations. However, that means it also required very delicate magical adjustments.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> We won&#39;t be able to set sail with them onboard.</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong><br> Is that so... Too bad...</p><p><strong>Boar Piglet:</strong><br> ...Oink...</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong><br> But that big demonic boar is still on this island, right?<br> If we leave these little ones here...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> They might be attacked.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> They might not be able to live safely.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That&#39;s right. That possibility does exist. I would have liked to rid them of that problem, but... well...</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> Hmph. Would you look at that. The solution came to us.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> \u2014Grrrrrrrrrrrrrfffffffffff!</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> Back for more?</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong><br> But look, the wound we inflicted earlier hasn&#39;t healed yet.</p><p><strong>Anne:</strong><br> We can do it now. We just might be able to kill it!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Master.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> If we jump aboard right now,we can finally leave this place...</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong><br> Master.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...But...</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> ...Master.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> We owe a lot to these boar piglets.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> ...Hah.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Let&#39;s fight! For the peace of this island!</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> Heh... I expected nothing less from ya!</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> Well said, Master.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> The Knights of the Round Table are not assembled, my beloved hound Cavall is not here, there&#39;s no army under my command...</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> But nevertheless, for the briefest of moments, this island was our kingdom... And those little ones behind us were its people.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> How can I call myself a king...<br> without fighting for the people!</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Grrrrrrrrrrrrrrfffffffff!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Let&#39;s go, Master!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Ugh...

It&#39;s quite a tough enemy.<br> Its presence here... must mean that, yes, this\u2014</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> GGGRRRR... GRR?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That glance... What&#39;s it looking at?<br> ...Oh no! The escape ship!</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> GRRRR, GRRRRRRRRRRFFFF!</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> It&#39;s charging!

Still, thanks to them, at least we made it in time!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> We&#39;re in position now! Leave it to us!</p><p><strong>Boar Piglet:</strong><br> Oi...nk...</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong><br> ...Even with your combined strength, there was no way you could have defeated such a huge beast...</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong><br> You knew that, didn&#39;t you?<br> ...And yet you still protected our ship.</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong><br> Silly piglets...

I know. You&#39;re big and they&#39;re small.</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong><br> You both eat to survive, and then eventually you die. You&#39;re both the same animal.</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong><br> So why do they get the island, not you?<br> You&#39;re thinking how unfair it is, right?</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong><br> ...I know how you feel, but I can tell you exactly why.</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong><br> ...Because they&#39;re weak, they&#39;re short-lived.<br> And because they surely can&#39;t oppose your strength.</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong><br> We are strong and have the power to protect them, so that is what we will do. Our purpose is to protect the weak.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> ...!?</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong><br> Yes. In a word, I suppose that&#39;s just my selfishness.</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong><br> The weak die out, and those with power control the land.<br> It&#39;s like that everywhere.</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong><br> ...But you know what?<br> I&#39;m Marie Antoinette.</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong><br> I&#39;m known as the most selfish girl in the world!</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> GR...GRRR...

I guess even a big boar like that isn&#39;t enough to kill me. Not like death by boar is a common occurrence, anyway...</p><p><strong>Boar Piglet:</strong><br> ...O-Oink...oink.</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong><br> ...Ah. Yes, that&#39;s right. Everything will be fine now.<br> That big bully&#39;s gone.</p><p><strong>Boar Piglet:</strong><br> Oink, oink.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fouu.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Oh no. Fou&#39;s got that \u201CDon&#39;t replace me!\u201D look in his eyes again...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I-It&#39;s okay, Fou!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I&#39;m looking at you in celebration of our victory, just like always!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou? Foufou.</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> At first I was thinking to myself, \u201CHow inconvenient. What kind of island is this?\u201D</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> Now it actually feels nostalgic.<br> Who knew I&#39;d be this emotional...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You&#39;re right...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I&#39;ve grown quite attached to this island.</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> Yes, it&#39;s amazing.</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> I guess that&#39;s because we all put in the effort to make this place easy for us to live in.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Marie, it&#39;s time to say goodbye.</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong><br> Yes, I understand.<br> It is quite regrettable but...</p><p><strong>Boar Piglet:</strong><br> Oink...</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong><br> Oh, don&#39;t cry like that.<br> Please live a happy life here.</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong><br> From your perspective, we may have very well ruined this island with all the things we built...</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong><br> However, please feel free to enjoy the food and all that in the field. If you feel like it, you can even do something new with all of it.</p><p><strong>Boar Piglet:</strong><br> Oink...</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong><br> ...Goodbye.</p><p><strong>Boar Piglet:</strong><br> ...Oiiinnnk! Oii!</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong><br> Farewell! It was fun!</p><p><strong>Boar Piglet:</strong><br> ...Oi...!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> It&#39;s kind of sad with them not around, huh?</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong><br> Is that so? I&#39;m... I&#39;m fine...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Here&#39;s hoping they have a happy life.</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong><br> Yes. I pray that island becomes a tropical paradise for those little ones.</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong><br> However, it seems we still have a problem. The ship has been rocking really hard. Is it really going to be okay?</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> It was the best ship I could build with the alloted time. It is properly protected by runes as well. No need to worry.</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong><br> ...Perhaps you were questioning our skills at the wheel? Just so you know, the ship&#39;s running fine.</p><p><strong>Anne:</strong><br> We haven&#39;t really decided what course it will take, though.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> No worries. I am sure we will reach somewhere if we just sail straight ahead.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> You just say whatever you want, don&#39;t you? Is that compass even working? Lying is not good, you know?</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> At any rate, we have plenty of food stored up. Since nothing is more important than food, I made sure of that personally.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> I don&#39;t mind where we end up.<br> Just as long as it allows us to contact Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> You&#39;re right. Let me try right now.<br> It wouldn&#39;t surprise me if we could already.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> So you&#39;re saying you don&#39;t even know when we&#39;ll be able to get in touch with them again? Man, now this is gonna be a long voyage...</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> Well, we&#39;ve had our relaxing island vacation, so why not an elegant ocean vacation next?</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> You people are still gonna be in swimsuits, yeah?<br> We know how to take a hint...</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> It means we men are still supporting roles.<br> We&#39;ll be good and sit on the sidelines.</p><p><strong>Kojirou:</strong><br> I already had enough fun on that island in my own way.</p><p><strong>Kojirou:</strong><br> Perhaps I will quietly stay in my cabin and play hanafuda.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> The Japanese card game? Hm, for some reason I remember playing it. Yeah, that&#39;ll help us kill some time.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> So there you have it. You probably won&#39;t see us again until we&#39;re back in Chaldea. Don&#39;t worry, we&#39;ll behave.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Hehe... Maybe Tamamo has the right attitude.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> If there&#39;s no way of knowing when we&#39;ll reach land, why even worry about it at all?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> As long as we just relax and enjoy ourselves on this ship, like we did on the island, then we may not have a problem.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Senpai, is there anything you want to do out in the open waters?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Fish, I guess.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Well, we did a lot of fishing back on the island... But you&#39;re right. Saltwater fishing would be a different experience entirely.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I wonder what kind of fish we&#39;ll catch...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I guess... we can pretend we&#39;re pirates.</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong><br> What? Don&#39;t tell me, Master...<br> You always wanted to be a pirate?</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong><br> Why didn&#39;t you tell me earlier!? Very good, very good!</p><p><strong>Anne:</strong><br> Hehe, I will teach you everything about being a pirate personally! Very personal, day and night!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Hey you two, at least one of you,<br> focus on steering the ship!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fouu.</p><h2 id="brilliant-summer-going-out-with-tamamo" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#brilliant-summer-going-out-with-tamamo" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Brilliant Summer - Going Out With Tamamo -</h2><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> Lalala!

From my BWH measurements, to what gifts I want the most at this moment...</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> I&#39;ll give you all the latest Tamamo news, if that&#39;s what you want! Ask away!</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> ...Our destination? Oh, nowhere fancy...<br> I think about here will do, even...</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> All right. Take out the parasol, spread the sheet over there, get the basket out...</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> Okay, that should do it.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> This... This setup is...</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou, fouuuu\u266A</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> This is a picnic...right?</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> Why yes, it is something like that.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Come to think of it, I&#39;m hungry.</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> That&#39;s perfect! Now don&#39;t be shy. Come! Come!</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> It&#39;s not every day you get to have a picnic, so I kind of went all out in the kitchen... Dig in!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Wow... There are so many dishes here you normally wouldn&#39;t see back at the base!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You are good at this!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Looks delicious!</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> Hehehe, I figured you already know this but I&#39;ve been training night and day to become a good wife!</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> I&#39;ve been taking cooking lessons as well, so hopefully I&#39;ve properly displayed those skills.</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> You see, my cooking teacher Uzume-chan and I have been friends since the events of the Kojiki, one of Japan&#39;s oldest legends.</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> She thus possesses the necessary culinary knowledge to survive in the wild like this. And so, figuring a day like this would come...</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> ...I asked her to teach me how to be self-sufficient and cook dishes that would win my dear Master&#39;s heart!</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> When it comes to what can be eaten or not, Sc\xE1thach might know a thing or two, HOWEVER...</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> I am confident that I am better at turning those ingredients into a delicious dish.</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> Now come try these acorn cookies.<br> There&#39;s bread made from acorn flour too.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Can you eat acorns?</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> Not normally, no. Their high toxicity produces a bitter, astringent sensation.</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> There ARE some kinds you can eat directly, though.<br> As for the others... well, you can get by as long as you get rid of the astringency.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I-I see... This is really educational.</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> This here is tochi mochi, made with Japanese horse chestnut. Of course, it too needs to have its harsh taste removed.</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> Oh, and this is some tea made from a unique blend of medicinal herbs I gathered myself. It&#39;s delicious and healthy.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> This is amazing... I think I&#39;ve gained a newfound respect for you, Tamamo.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> She&#39;s never been this into cooking before...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Me too. I wonder what happened?</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> I was actually going to go for a \u201Cwell-to-do fox at the beach\u201D vibe at first, since we&#39;re on a tropical island and all...</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> However, you&#39;ll just ignore me if I all I do is relax elegantly under a parasol. Nothing would change.</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> Even if that actually is the case, I thought you&#39;d forget about me if we don&#39;t have some sort of physical contact from time to time...</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> Well, at least that was the idea.</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> Besides, come to think of it, I never got the opportunity to explain my current style. That was also one of the reasons.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You&#39;re Lancer now, right?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> You&#39;re Tamamo Summer Version, right?</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> Well, yes.<br> But there&#39;s something more important than that.</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> Since we&#39;re on a summer vacation, I&#39;m rerouting all my magical energy to my body, strengthening it. I&#39;m a veritable beast of summer.</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> This time I wouldn&#39;t be a close-minded and unattractive spellcaster, I thought. No, I&#39;d be an elegant socialite instead...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Hmm... I don&#39;t really understand how those things connect... but I understand why you&#39;ve been fighting at close quarters now...</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> So anyway, since I am a summer beast, I thought I should let that wild side out from time to time.</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> And as an added bonus, I decided to offer Master a picnic and some recreation like this. That&#39;s why I guided you here, you know?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Recreation?<br> All of a sudden I have a bad feeling about this.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou, fou.</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> Now that our tummies are full, let&#39;s head over there.</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> Sorry, but if we get any closer, this foul stench will totally ruin my appetite...</p><p><strong>Demon Boar:</strong><br> Grrrrr...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> A demon boar! ...And this is its poisonous swamp!</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> Obviously, my nose can pick up smell better than before.</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> So I just happened to find this monster earlier than the boar piglets.</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> Now, Master. This is the end of our picnic.<br> That&#39;s a worthy opponent!</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> Let&#39;s release our pent-up wildness!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Nothing is pent-up for me, you know!?</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> Good good, I&#39;m feeling much better!</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> Now I can focus on showing off my glamorous body like an elegant socialite should... all while hiding my monstrous side.</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> I&#39;m a beachside beauty... Definitely not desperate...<br> Yes, I can see it now! By the end of summer, you who failed to notice me...</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> ...will realize for the first time that you&#39;ve actually been in love with me all along! Tee hee!

Growf...</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> It doesn&#39;t appear to have noticed us yet.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> It looks... like it&#39;s on its way back to its den.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> We&#39;ve had to clean up several poisonous swamps already. Could this be another one?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> For the sake of the island&#39;s wildlife, we can&#39;t ignore it.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> For the sake of the boar piglets, we can&#39;t ignore it.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> You are so considerate, Master... You are exactly right.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> But what should we do? It might disappear somewhere if we don&#39;t keep our eyes on it.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> If we lose sight of it, we have no guarantee that the boar piglets will find it.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> At any rate, let&#39;s follow it,</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> But...that means we have to cross this river.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> If we jump over, the boar will notice us.<br> We must swim across it stealthily.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> The current becomes much faster in the middle.<br> You&#39;re in danger of being washed away, Master...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Can you give me a hand?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I&#39;d like you to assist me.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> Oh... Ooh! Of course! Of course!</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> When we looked at each other just now, I understood. That confirmed it.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> You have faith in me!</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> Our hearts are bound together. There is nothing to fear with trust and love like ours.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> Now... Hold my hand, Master, and don&#39;t ever let go.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> I mean, naturally, I have no intention of letting go of you either...for all eternity... Hehehe.

Me, as beautiful as a mermaid?<br> You&#39;re too generous...</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> As I was saying earlier, I never used to be able to swim.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> But when I was fervently chasing after Anchin, I suddenly found myself slithering across the Hidaka River...</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> Somehow I was able to swim!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> N-Never mind that! Watch out for the demon boar!</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> Oh, that&#39;s right. Let&#39;s go after it before we lose it.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> We found it. Just as we suspected, it&#39;s relaxing in a poisonous swamp.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> ...We did it, Master. That demon boar doesn&#39;t look like it will be moving for a while.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> Let&#39;s remember this location and hurry back to camp. If we grab everyone quickly, I think we can make it back in time.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> Then... you&#39;ll have front-row seats to observe me as I gracefully put my naginata to use.</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> The demonic boar has been defeated. Let the others handle any leftover business. All right, Master. Shall we have a swim together?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I... I think I&#39;m too tired for a swim right now...</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> Oh, really?<br> But there&#39;s no need to worry, Master.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> You see... In the end, while thinking of Anchin, I went to the bottom of the river.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> It was cold... and quiet...<br> The water seemed to engulf my burning feelings for him.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> It was me, and Anchin within my heart...<br> Just the two of us... at the bottom of the river.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> ...But what if it had been the real Anchin there with me?<br> I have often wished it were so.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> Therefore, Master, being alone with you at the bottom of the river might not be so bad either.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> If you ever tire of your life... feel free to let me know, all right?</p><h2 id="brilliant-summer-an-expedition-with-anne-and-mary" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#brilliant-summer-an-expedition-with-anne-and-mary" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Brilliant Summer - An Expedition With Anne and Mary -</h2><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fouu!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> This...is a big one!</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong><br> ...!</p><p><strong>Anne:</strong><br> Wow!

Perhaps that is the reason.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...?</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong><br> When I became the queen, and entered into the royal family, I wasn&#39;t allowed to lose my way any longer.</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong><br> What I needed to do had been predetermined, and things I couldn&#39;t do were also decided for me. I went through a lot.</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong><br> But in a maze, you&#39;re allowed to not know where to go. Like a child, you get lost, and just simply search for the exit.</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong><br> So perhaps that ended up being a way to relieve stress for me?
