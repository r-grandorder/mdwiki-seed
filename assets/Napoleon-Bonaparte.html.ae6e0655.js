He was appointed as an artillery officer in 1785. Several years later, the French Revolution broke out, but, holding no particular interest in France&#39;s internal affairs, Napoleon returned to his birthplace, Corsica, for a long while.<br> After he was driven out of Corsica along with his family due to political strife on the island, they migrated to Southern France and, in 1793, he returned to his unit. Napoleon, who was a &#39;Corsican noble&#39; to some extent, was immediately promoted to Captain, and joined the Siege of Toulon as an officer of the Southern Army lead by General Carteaux. At this time, thanks to, in part, the good fortune of having his predecessor being sent to the rear due to an injury, Napoleon went on to achieve success without a hitch.<br> That conspicuous service drew the attention of the National Convention who was searching for a young hero. At the age of 24, he was promoted to brigadier general (equivalent to major general) and &#39;General Bonaparte Napoleon&#39; was born.<br> Afterwards, he was faced with misfortune due to his friendship with Augustine Robespierre (the youger brother of Maximilien Robespierre), and, after he was put under for a short time, he went through the bitter experience of being demoted and relegated to service in the first reserve.<br> However, the times were favouring Napoleon. When Vend\xE9miaire 13, a counter-revolt of the royalist faction, occurred in Paris, in 1795, Paul Barras, army commander of the National Convention, gave Napoleon command of the troops. Napoleon used a bold tactic of firing cannons at civilians in the urban area of the capital and suppressed the royalist insurrection. Thanks to this achievement, he quickly rose in the ranks from G\xE9n\xE9ral de Corps (equivalent to the rank of Lieutenant General) to the rank of Commander of the Interior, and celebrated as the hero, &#39;General Vand\xE9miaire&#39;.<br> Having attained status and fame, Napoleon leapt into battle as Commander of the Army of Italy, piling up victory after victory. In late 1797, after thoroughly crushing Austria, the triumphant Napoleon&#39;s return was met with the jubilant cheers of the citizens.</p><p>After returning to France, he proposed the invasion of Egypt that was under Ottoman rule to the French Directory. Apart from the military objective of keeping in check England that they couldn&#39;t strike at effectively up till now, there were other things to take into consideration, like the French Directory&#39;s growing distrust of Napoleon or the person in question holding an interest in Egypt due to his admiration for Alexander the Great (Iskandar).<br> Napoleon&#39;s military exploits had been successful in Egypt, but before the great anti-France coalition formed at the behest of England, France fell into a crisis and became isolated. As a result of Italy taking back Austria, criticism of the Directory began to rise, so Napoleon returned to France, accompanied only by his close aides; with the coup of 18 Brumaire, he established a ruling government in 1799 November. He took the position of First Consul, and became a dictator.<br> The course of events afterwards are the following:</p><p>Year 1800: Dramatic victory against the Austrian army, establishing of the Banque de France</p><p>Year 1801: With the Treaty of Lun\xE9ville between France and Austria the Second Coalition collapses<br> Concordat of 1801</p><p>Year 1802: Treaty of Amiens, the founding of the Legion d&#39;honneur order of merit<br> Napoleon is made consul for life by constitutional amendment</p><p>Year 1804: Execution of Lous Antoine from the royal family<br> An imperial system based on the Roman model (Napoleonic Code) is created<br> Through a national referendum decreed by the Consulate, Napoleon was elected as the Emperor of the French</p><p>During his coronation, Napoleon did not receive the crown from the Pope, but crowned himself in the presence of Pope Pius VII. This served as an expression of his pride that he &quot;became the emperor with his own strength&quot;.</p><p>Napoleon was an accomplished villain of the turbulent times, but also a capable ruler. Under Napoleon I&#39;s rule, France, which was devastated by the revolution, would gradually recover.<br> Furthermore, the Battle of Trafalgar (waged against the British Navy led by Admiral Nelson) that was said to be akin to the symbol of Napoleon&#39;s fall also occurred during this period (1805 October). The news of the loss were snuffed out by Napoleon in France and they did not attach much importance to it even in the enemy nations. At the Battle of Austerlitz, also known as the Battle of the Three Emperors (1805 December 2), Napoleon achieved a complete victory. To commemorate this victory, the Arc de Triomphe was constructed in Paris.<br> The collapse of the Holy Roman Empire due to the Holy Roman Emperor Francis II&#39;s abdication of the throne (though he kept his position as the Emperor of Austria) in the subsequent power struggle was quite an impactful event. Although it was a part of the Coalition, Napoleon became the man who destroyed the &quot;Roman Empire&quot;.</p><p>Napoleon was drunk on his own glory.<br> In May of 1805, with Bourbon Spain rife with internal strife, Napoleon attempted to instate his elder brother, Joseph, as the King of Spain, who was already the King of Naples. However, with strong local opposition, the French military found itself swamped in endless battles with the civilian partisan forces. And so, one by one, the internal conflicts began to pile upon Napoleon, who was at the peak of his career.<br> Meanwhile, many countries were preparing for revenge. The first wave among these was Russia. In 1812, Napoleon sent a large army of 600,000 to desolate Russia (the Russian campaign), but the one-eyed veteran general Mikhail Kutuzov exhausted Napoleon&#39;s forces with his scorched-earth strategy. Although Napoleon managed to capture Moscow, their supply lines were in tatters and he couldn&#39;t hope to advance further.</p><p>The enemies did not overlook their chance to strike down Napoleon who lost his elite Grande Arm\xE9e that supported his glorious feats, and, under a great siege, on March 31, 1814, Paris fell. Napoleon was forcibly deposed by the insurrection of the generals, and, given the symbolic position of a minor feudal lord on the island of Elba that was situated between Corsica and mainland Italy, he was exiled from France. This was the second exile of his life.</p><p>After the Treaty of Fontainebleau&#39;s conclusion, the Congress of Vienna was held in 1814 to discuss what would ve done with France. However, since the interests of each nation greatly entangled, the congress would only progress at a snail&#39;s pace, akin to a quagmire, aptly symbolized by the words of Charles-Joseph de Ligne of Belgian descent that &quot;The Congress does not march, it dances.&quot;<br> Louis XVIII, who was elected as the new king, wasn&#39;t popular with the populace and the internal discomfiture remained unceasing within France.<br> Meanwhile, Napoleon escapes from Elba and heads for France.<br> &quot;O citizens of France, I have heard your lamentations and wishes on the island of my exile. You demand a government of your own choice, the only thing that is orthodox. I have crossed the seas to regain my right which is also your right.&quot; &quot;Victory will march forth in a rush. Along with the national flag, the eagles will fly from bell tower to bell tower, all the way to the Notre Dame.&quot;<br> On March 1, Napoleon landed at Golfe-Juan near Cannes and sent forth a manifesto before beginning his advance.<br> On March 7, the forces of the royalist faction sent by La Mule and lead by general Marchant, commander of the 7th Regiment stood in Napoleon&#39;s way. However, when he shouted &quot;Soldiers, my friends, it is I! If among you, there is somebody who wishes to kill me then be my guest, I am right here!&quot;, the soldiers responded with &quot;Vive L&#39;Empereur!&quot; and joined his forces. The same thing occurred at Grenoble too.<br> And in such a manner, Napoleon reached Paris without encountering a single battle.<br> On the night of March 19, it as raining heavily.<br> While Paris was eagerly awaiting the Emperor&#39;s return, Louis XVIII escaped the city via a horse-drawn carriage. Napoleon entered Paris at 9 PM the following day.</p><p>Napoleon proclaimed a new liberal constitution and attempted to make compromises with the opposing internal forces.<br> However, the Coalition rejected the reconciliation. Lacking the majority of the generals who supported his Empire, and scraping together an army of only 600,000, Napoleon rushed into war.<br> Although he was victorious at the beginning of hostilities, on June 18, 1815, at the battle near Waterloo in Belgium, he is faced with a crushing defeat at the hands of the Coalition army made up by English, Dutch and Prussian forces, drawing the curtain on Napoleon&#39;s 98 days (Hundred Days).<br> Cornered into abdicating the throne once again, Napoleon is confined to the island of Saint Helena, a solitary island on the South Atlantic Ocean, where he remains until his death.</p><h2 id="character-in-fgo" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#character-in-fgo" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Character in FGO</h2><p>The man of possibilities.<br> Or, the idol of a hero created by the expectations of the people.<br> The first French emperor.
