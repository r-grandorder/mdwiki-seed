She was beautiful and clever, as well as spellbinding to everyone around her, even winning the favor of the legal wife of Minamoto-no-Tsunemoto with her talent for playing the koto. Koyo eventually gained the affection of Tsunemoto as well, but she was later accused of trying to kill his wife. For this, she was sentenced to execution. However, she was already pregnant with Tsunemoto&#39;s child, and so she was banished to Shinano province of Japan. Koyo was welcomed by the villagers in the village of Minase (later called Kinasa), but she was later feared as a &quot;kijyo&quot; who led a group of bandits.</p><p>The general Taira-no-Koremori was ordered to kill Koyo, but he had difficulty when he finally encountered her. Koremori then prayed to the gods for aid, and was given a spiritual sword to repel evil. He then disguised himself as a travelling monk, and managed to kill Koyo after confronting her alone.</p><p>Koyo was said to be born after her parents prayed to the Demon King of the Sixth Heaven for a child, and so she possessed many abilities in mystic arts from a young age. Mt. Tokakushi in Shinano province where Koyo was banished to was a sacred mountain blessed by the nine-headed dragon deity Kuzuryushin, and was opened up for pilgrimages. Additionally, the neighboring Mt. Iizuna was a land with deep belief in tengu and was known to be a land full of mystic arts and outlaws.</p><p>Koyo thrived in such an environment, and she eventually took in many members from the army of Taira-no-Masakado who held grudges against the imperial court. She also took another kijyo named Oman of Oni, who was known for her strength and stamina, under her wing.</p><h2 id="character-in-fgo" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#character-in-fgo" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Character in FGO</h2><p>Her odd appearance as a dinosaur is caused indirectly by the Kuzuryuu faith and its relation to Mount Togakushi where dragon bones (fossils) were found. In Chaldea and around her Master, she is almost always in Dino-form and she avoids being in her Kijyo form as much as possible. Others can call her Koyo, but being called Momiji tends to hurt her feelings a bit. The wounds on her dino-form&#39;s face cannot be hidden or changed with magic, for they are reminders of her fatal battle with Taira-no-Koremori.</p><h2 id="standard-weapons" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#standard-weapons" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Standard Weapons</h2><p>With her huge body, she unleashes Dynamic Tyrannoaction.</p><h2 id="related-characters" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#related-characters" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Related Characters</h2><p><strong>Shuten Douji/Ibaraki Douji/Watanabe no Tsuna</strong></p><p>I have heard much of the name Shuten Douji of Mt. Ooe causing revelry in the capital. The capital...such a bitter feeling. That place is now my past. Incidentally, is their retainer, Ibaraki Douji, the one Kijyo know as &quot;Hashihime&quot;? Or is that another person, or rather, oni? How many arms has Watanabe no Tsuna cut down? Is he a collector of such? Ogh, perish the thought...</p><p><strong>Tawara Touta</strong></p><p>Is that the man who is said to have defeated that Masakado! Gruorrr...even in my human form, I acted out a bit...Taira-no-Masakado is not so pitiful...They would surely be able to evade through an enemy who would only utilize bags of rice as a weapon.</p><p><strong>Utusmi Erice</strong></p><p>While memories of them I possess not, Erice claims of one I should know well. Indeed, it is an impossibility. I simply must meet this &quot;Karin&quot; that she speaks of!</p><p><strong>Voyager</strong></p><p>What a beautiful boy. With such soft, gently draped garments, he is like a child that was sent by the gods or the Buddha. Perhaps I should wash him in the bath. Then, scrub that head of his. And brush his teeth as well. Yes. I shall!</p><p><strong>Yang Guifei</strong></p><p>...She has quite a peaceful talent. The sounds of her biwa alone are enough to quell me.</p><h2 id="comment-from-the-illustrator" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#comment-from-the-illustrator" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Comment from the Illustrator</h2><p>When I drew Koyo, I had figures, books, and a dino-loving guy to reference her upper half. Nailing the standing pose for her first Ascension took a lot out of me. It was tough...I fixated on her ascensions, kimono pattern, and general feel a bunch, but ultimately I&#39;m very happy with what I made.</p><h2 id="material-images" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#material-images" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Material Images</h2><p>(Lib will add after publish)</p><h2 id="dialogue" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#dialogue" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Dialogue</h2><table><thead><tr><th style="text-align:left;">Occassion</th><th style="text-align:center;">English</th><th style="text-align:center;">Japanese</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style="text-align:left;">Summoned</td><td style="text-align:center;"></td><td style="text-align:center;"></td></tr></tbody></table>', 70);
