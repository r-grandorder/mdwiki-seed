How is it?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Perfect.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Every pot you make comes out better than the last.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I&#39;m glad to hear that.<br> Okay, I&#39;ll pour myself a cup too\u2013</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...?</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong><br> OMG! I, like, can&#39;t even! You&#39;re MY Master,<br> Master, so you&#39;ve gotta, like, do something!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Suzuka, what&#39;s wrong?<br> Here, have some tea first.</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong><br> Tea? OMG you&#39;re like, so considerate! I&#39;m so touched knowing Mash can really look after people.</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong><br> This Jasmine tea is delish! BTW, this tea actually goes really well with Japanese sweets...</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong><br> ...AND THAT&#39;S NOT WHY I&#39;M HERE!<br> The tea is, like, so good though...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Then...why are you here?</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong><br> Why? Do you even have to ask!?<br> Isn&#39;t it freakin&#39; obvious? I am literally...</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong><br> ...bored AF!!!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Huh?</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong><br> I have got, like, nothing but time here.<br> I mean, I&#39;m a high school girl!</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong><br> We should like...not ever have entire days in our planners empty!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I-I see... A teenage girl, huh...</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong><br> We can&#39;t fall even one day behind! We gotta, like, keep up with the trends and stuff or we&#39;ll end up looking like total losers!</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong><br> It&#39;s how us high school girls gotta live!<br> It&#39;s, like, an actual war!</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong><br> Now that I&#39;m all, like, materialized, I&#39;m not wasting another second hanging around this boring dump! YFM?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> R-right...</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong><br> Hm? Hold up...<br> (Staaare)</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong><br> ...You said your name&#39;s Mash, right?<br> How old are you again?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Me? Well, it&#39;s sort of complicated in my case...</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong></p><p>Really!? Aren&#39;t you, like, at LEAST high school age!?<br> Such a waste... Oh wait, maybe this is actually, like, perfect?</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong><br> &#39;Cuz, like, you&#39;d be perfect for what high school girls do. You know, like cliques and stuff!</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong><br> All right Mash, you come with me.<br> Oh, I guess you can come too, Master.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Huh? Where are we going?</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong><br> Dunno. We don&#39;t, like, have to have a destination, do we?</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong><br> We can figure that out later. I just wanna get outta here and chat a little and stuff.</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong><br> It&#39;d rock if there was someplace we could chill, like a mall, but since there isn&#39;t, we&#39;ll just have to settle for walking around this Chaldea place.</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong><br> I mean, you could even, like, show me around if you wanna. I don&#39;t know this place at all.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Well, I don&#39;t mind giving you a tour, but,<br> it doesn&#39;t have to be right NOW, does it...?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Senpai and I were just enjoying a nice,<br> relaxing teatime while we\u2013</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong><br> C&#39;mon, let&#39;s GO already!<br> We&#39;re burning daylight or whatever! (Tug, tug)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Well...umm...I guess I can&#39;t refuse...</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong><br> Haha! It&#39;s not every day you get to go on a walk with two cute high schoolers hanging all over you.<br> Isn&#39;t Fujimaru like the luckiest [\u2642 guy /\u2640\uFE0F girl] out there?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I... I&#39;m a staff member of Chaldea, not a student...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Um, Suzuka, please don&#39;t take this the wrong way,<br> but you&#39;re not really in high school, right...?</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong><br> Hey, don&#39;t get hung up on the details, Mash.</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong><br> It&#39;s like they say, you&#39;re only as old as you feel,<br> right? And I am for sure a teenager at heart!</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong><br> Now shut up about all that age crap and show me around! Oooh, where&#39;s the nearest cr\xEApe stand? Real high school girl walks totes need munchies!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I&#39;m afraid we don&#39;t have any food stands here...<br> But there is a tearoom up ahead.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> See the sign that says \u201CMoonlight\u201D? It used to be an empty storeroom until Dr. Roman fixed it up.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I&#39;m told it has AV equipment, soundproofed walls,<br> and even a karaoke machine.</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong><br> Karaoke! Oh that is just, like,<br> a perfect place to stop for our walk!</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong><br> Besides, you&#39;ve gotta have mad karaoke skills when you go out to mixers and stuff!</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong><br> Not gonna lie, I&#39;m pretty good when it comes to music. So good I drew out Takamaru when he was hiding in a cave.</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong><br> Oh but to set the record straight, karaoke isn&#39;t about who&#39;s the best singer.</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong><br> The most important part about karaoke is having fun and making sure everyone can enjoy it.</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong><br> Oh this will totes help me max out my high school girl game! C&#39;mon, what&#39;re we still doing here!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Okay, let&#39;s go pay it a visit. But I don&#39;t know much about singing, so I&#39;ll probably just stick to listening.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> (Speaking of which, I remember asking about this karaoke machine...)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> (...Da Vinci was deadly serious when she said it would be better if I don&#39;t go near it for a while... I wonder why?)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Here we are.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...? I think I hear something inside...<br> Maybe someone&#39;s already using it?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I&#39;ve got a bad feeling about this.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Oh great, here we go...</p><hr><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong><br> Oh? Is another high school girl in there?<br> C&#39;mon Mash, Fujimaru, let&#39;s go meet them!</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong></p><p>I am the\u266A...per... p-p-p-per!</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong></p><p>Perfectest emperOR\u266A (Bleat)</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong></p><p>Bloody, bloody, nice and bloody\u266A</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong></p><p>Hyper Idol ShowTIME\u266A (Squawk)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...!</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong><br> Th-the hell...!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> GAAAAAAH!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> (Go into shock)</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Senpai!? Hang in there, Senpai!<br> Please, get a hold of yourself!</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Heh, your lovely singing voice gave my goosebumps goosebumps, Lancer! I am reminded once again why you are my rival!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> I&#39;m impressed by your devilish singing too, Saber. I never would&#39;ve guessed you had an auditory train wreck like that up your sleeve, given your adorable looks.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> That was good. Great, even! So awful it was perfect!<br> And you were so off-key you were like a locked door.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> As in the door to success!? Please, stop!<br> You&#39;ll make me blush!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> And I love your Tyrant Burning Shout!<br> It&#39;d be the perfect...for a top idol like me!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It&#39;s...Nero and Elisabeth. They seem to be smiling and glaring at each other simultaneously...</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong><br> Wha... What WAS that singing? That was, like, the ACTUAL WORST! My brain is trying to shut off my sense of hearing...</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Hm? And just WHAT do you mean by that?</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> You there, Fox Ears! Just because you are a devoted fan lured by the siren song of my beautiful music does not give you the right to simply listen for free!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Yeah! Where do you get off sighing during our recital!? Beat it, before we start charging admission!</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong><br> Yikes... Admission? For karaoke?<br> That is, like, so not funny.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I&#39;m afraid it&#39;s no joke, Suzuka. Hard as it must be to believe, they are both completely serious.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> As far as they&#39;re both concerned, singing gives their lives purpose. They would never joke about it.</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong><br> Oh... Okay...<br> So that&#39;s these chicks&#39; deal, huh...</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong><br> ...Chill... I must stay chill... Their songs might&#39;ve almost knocked me out cold but karaoke isn&#39;t about who&#39;s the best singer!</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong><br> ...Not just me, but EVERYONE has to enjoy karaoke... Yeah...we should be having fun. All right!</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong><br> Ahem... What you two think about your singing is like totally not my business, and it&#39;s not my place to critique it or anything, y&#39;know?</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong><br> Some people might call your singing...unique.<br> But as long as you two are having fun, who cares?</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong><br> Anyway, if you&#39;re done...<br> I think it&#39;s our turn to use this room.</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong><br> I&#39;m a high school girl, so I gotta do some serious karaoke training. My social life DEPENDS on it. Now get outta the way!</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Huh? Do not be ridiculous, Fox Ears.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> My performance has only just begun. How can you expect me to step off the stage after only twenty hours?</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> And I still have over a hundred songs to get through!<br> Even if most of them are just remixes.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> There&#39;s my Halloween standard arrangement, my Halloween demon realm arrangement, my Halloween Goderi arrangement, my Halloween sound arrange\u2013</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong><br> ...I see. So you&#39;re saying you aren&#39;t going anywhere, aren&#39;t you?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Um, Suzuka? What if you sang with them?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Of course, Master and I just remembered something urgent we have to attend to, so we definitely won&#39;t be joining you.</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong><br> Uh, what? Are you nuts? I&#39;m not singing with them!<br> I&#39;m trying to improve my skills, not make them worse!</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong><br> Besides, I don&#39;t wanna sing with just ANYONE! You&#39;re the only other high schooler here besides me, Mash!</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong><br> There is, like, not enough money in the world for me to sing with Little Red Tone-Deaf Hood and her creepy idol wannabe sidekick.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Um, as I said before,<br> I may technically be a teenage girl, but\u2013</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> What was that!? You dare refer to a great emperor like myself as \u201CLittle Red Tone-Deaf Hood\u201D!? I have a most beautiful singing voice!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Creepy idol wannabe...sidekick!?</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Heh, hehe, hehehe.<br> Now I get it, Saber.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> This girl must be...jealous of our immense talent!</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Aha, so that is it! She must be a contrarian\u2013a \u201Chater\u201D who despises things that are popular.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> This only serves as proof that my singing is spreading beyond its intended audience!</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Still... Umu, it is sad that we cannot see eye to eye,<br> even after becoming Servants...</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> ...but that does not mean I shall be relinquishing this mic anytime soon. All that matters is that I am enjoying myself!</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> You there, Fox Ears... Hm? Fox Ears...? For some reason, that appellation fills me with dread, but no matter.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong></p><p>If you wish to claim this mic as your own,<br> you shall have to pry it out of my hands!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> True. In the idol world, everything comes down to power and violence eventually.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> And since I am the top idol, if you&#39;re going to try and steal my mic, you&#39;d better be ready for a world of hurt!</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong><br> Ha! What are you two talking about? I don&#39;t even... Whatevs, if you&#39;re hoping for a fight then I&#39;m totes down!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Oh no. These incredibly powerful Servants are about to fight for an incredibly insignificant reason...!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Khh... I suppose my performance must have taken a greater toll on me than I realized... (Thud)</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Aw man, if only I hadn&#39;t put in those two hours of high touch practice before singing... (Thud)</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong><br> Hehe...<br> Teenagers are totes the best at being greedy!</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong><br> Now let&#39;s get this karaoke party star\u2013Huh?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It seems our battle ended up destroying the machine...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> War! What is it good for? Absolutely nothing...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Too bad we didn&#39;t get to hear you sing.</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong><br> Y-yeah, that sucks. I wish I could&#39;ve shown you guys what real singing sounds like.</p><hr><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong><br> (Sigh)... Oh well, guess there&#39;s nothing we can do now that it&#39;s broken.</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong><br> But hey, it&#39;s not like there aren&#39;t a bunch of other things we&#39;ve still gotta do!</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong><br> C&#39;mon, Mash and Master, let&#39;s blow this popsicle stand and find somewhere else to go!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Hold on, let me just finish submitting the damage report and repair request... Okay, done. Although, now that I think about it, we may be better off if the machine is never repaired...</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong></p><p>(Standing up) What? The machine is broken?<br> In that case...</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> ...we shall now test our singing might free of the confines of musical accompaniment! Lancer, I challenge you to an a cappella contest! La la laaa!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong></p><p>(Standing up) Challenge accepted! A true idol has no problem keeping her fans enthralled with the power of her voice alone! Laaa!</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong><br> ...UGH, whatevs.<br> Just get me away from this freak show...</p><p><strong>--ARROW--:</strong></p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong><br> Hey, Master? Mash? I&#39;ve said this before,<br> so I&#39;m pretty sure you know what the deal is, but...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes?</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong><br> I wanna be the cutest girl ever.<br> That way I&#39;ll be gucci when I finally meet \u201Cthe one.\u201D</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong><br> Like...I&#39;ve got no idea if any other versions of me already met \u201Cthe one\u201D somewhere, or if I&#39;m gonna meet him myself one day...</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong><br> ...but I am totes certain he&#39;s out there.</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong><br> He&#39;s, like, gotta be perfect. Someone I can devote all my love and stuff to. And be a killer hot bae.</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong><br> Sooo, if there&#39;s any chance I might meet him, I can&#39;t just slack off on being awesomely cute, can I?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I, uh, I see. So that&#39;s why you want to,<br> uh...polish your skills.</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong><br> Yup! So karaoke is pretty much off the list now...but I can totes hone other skills on our walk!</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong><br> ...Besides, the way I see it, a top-tier high school girl&#39;s gotta know how to play the game, which means she&#39;s gotta be used to hanging out with guys.</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong><br> If my future boyfriend gets away &#39;cause I end up freezing at a crucial moment, that&#39;d just be the worst, right?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I...guess you might be right.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Wouldn&#39;t a naive, innocent girl have her own appeal?</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong><br> Um, no. Obviously.</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong><br> I mean, you HAVE heard about the whole, like, missed connection thing, right? You get ONE shot to say the right thing, and if you blow it, it&#39;s all over!</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong><br> So I can&#39;t just sit in my tower waiting for Prince Charming or whatever! I gotta go on the ATTACK!</p><hr><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong><br> So! My next goal on this walk is to find a certified hottie and chat him up\u266A</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> A, uh, certified hottie, huh...<br> Well, there are a good number of other Servants here.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...While we&#39;re on the subject, what sort of things are you looking for in a romantic partner, Suzuka?</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong><br> Ooh, you wanna talk about boys?</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong><br> Hehehe, I KNEW we were totes on the same page, Mash!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> N-no, I don&#39;t think so.<br> I was just asking purely out of curiosity. I&#39;m not\u2013</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong><br> Right, yeah, anyways... Hmm, I don&#39;t really have a clear picture, you know? I mean, if I did, that&#39;d sure make finding \u201Cthe one\u201D way easier.</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong><br> So I guess I&#39;ll know what I&#39;m looking for when I see it.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...I see. So you can&#39;t say anything for sure until you&#39;ve actually met him...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Does that mean you can&#39;t tell if it&#39;s fate or not until it&#39;s actually happening?</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong><br> Oh, yeah, totally! That&#39;s it exactly!<br> Don&#39;t overthink it and all, right?</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong><br> If you wanna talk, talk. If not, don&#39;t.<br> You just gotta figure it out as you go.</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong><br> Now come on!<br> I wanna see what sorta guys this place has!</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> Hello Master, Mash. Are you out for a walk?<br> ...May I ask who your new friend is?</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong><br> Hmm...nah. He might be handsome, but he looks like he&#39;s got hella bad romantic luck. Plus, for some reason I feel like a boar would kick his ass.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> ...!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Oho, is the mongrel out for a walk? You must be starved for stimulation. Very well. I am in fine spirits today, so I shall grant you an audience.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Just this once, I will permit you to regale me with the tales of your many comedic failures. Be certain to make them entertaining.</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong><br> Hmm...nah. It&#39;s cool to be an influencer, but he&#39;s way too stuck-up for me. I think I&#39;d prefer the kid we saw earlier who looks kinda like him.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> ...!</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Hmm? What&#39;s going on? Huh? Huh?</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong><br> ...Nah, not really my type. Plus, nobody likes a guy who&#39;s cuter than her. Nobody!</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> ...!</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong><br> What. The. Hell!? There are tons of good-looking guys here, so how come all I can do is swipe left? There&#39;s just something wrong with all of them!</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong><br> Forget finding a boyfriend! There&#39;s not even someone worth practicing my flirting on here!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I feel oddly bad about that...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Maybe you should try changing things up?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Maybe don&#39;t limit yourself to handsome young guys?</p><hr><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong><br> Hmm... You might be onto something there. Maybe I should try older guys. Silver foxes are totes a thing.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Ah. Speaking of which...</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong><br> Hm? If it isn&#39;t Mash and Master.<br> I&#39;m glad to see you both in good health.</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong><br> And...I don&#39;t believe we&#39;ve met?</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong><br> &#39;Sup. I&#39;m Suzuka, a Saber.<br> I&#39;m outie five thousand. Peace.</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong><br> Oho, a Saber, you say? What a coincidence!<br> The name&#39;s Fergus and I&#39;m a Saber myself.</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong><br> Hmm... (Staaare)</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong><br> ...?</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong><br> I must say, Lady Suzuka...<br> You are one fine woman.</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong></p><p>Eh? A-ahaha, for real?<br> Aw, that&#39;s so sweet.</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong><br> I guess that super jacked look can work.</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong><br> Haha, I see, I see. In that case, Lady Suzuka...maybe we should have ourselves a little \u201Csparring\u201D session?</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong><br> You seem like you have energy to spare.<br> I would love to have you as my partner.</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong><br> Oh... You mean that thing swordsmen like to get up to? Hmm... Yeah, why not? I was getting kinda tired of just strolling around.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Senpai. Senpai!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Is it just me, or are the two of them speaking English and still somehow managing to not be speaking the same language?</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong><br> Then you accept? Wonderful.</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong><br> So where do you wanna do this thing? I passed a training room earlier if you wanna go at it there.</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong><br> Oho, the training room, you say? I was thinking either your room or mine...but I see you prefer someplace a little...roomier! Very well, I gladly accept.</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong><br> Ahh, I can&#39;t wait to get started. Despite your flippant demeanor, I knew from the moment I laid eyes on you that you were ripe for the plucking.</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong><br> Between your full, perky breasts, your shapely bottom, and those childbearing hips, I can tell I will truly enjoy some vigorous lovemaking with you! Wahaha!</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong></p><p>Huh!? W-wait. When you said \u201Cpartner,\u201D you meant...<br> Wh-what are you, stupid or something!? What the ACTUAL HELL, creeper!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...I knew it.</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong><br> Forget it!<br> I take back literally everything I said before!</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong><br> Now, now, there&#39;s nothing to be embarrassed about.<br> Come on. Come on. (Approaching determinedly)</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong><br> Wh-why you... Dammit, I knew this place was a freak show! Left swipe. Left swipe! LEFT SWIIIIIIIIPE!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong><br> Ugh, that sucked ass.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I&#39;m so sorry. Usually, he&#39;s a paragon of Sabers, and highly dependable, but he can get...carried away...</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong><br> You don&#39;t need to apologize!<br> It&#39;s that old freak with the drill who&#39;s way out of line!</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong><br> And where the hell&#39;s he get off calling me \u201Cripe\u201D!? Can&#39;t he talk about how I&#39;m a cute teenage girl in the prime of my fricking youth!?</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong><br> ...It&#39;s un-freakin&#39;-believable!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> N-now, now, at least it&#39;s all over. There&#39;s a break room right over there. How about we rest a bit?</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong></p><p>...Hehehehe. I&#39;ve lost count of how many drinks this is.<br> But who cares? Bottoms up!</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong></p><p>Yeah!<br> Wine shared with you is always special wine, Shuten!</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> And the snacks we stole off of the green Archer are sooo deliciously sweet! Mmm...</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Now, what were we talking about again?<br> Oh, right. So I gave those humans an earful.</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> I said ... from the bottom of my heart...so you all must be ...! So there!</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> My, my, you must have scared them out of their minds, Ibaraki. Your transformations surprise even me sometimes.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> Fufu... What could be scarier than a sudden, unexpected, and dramatic transformation...? I don&#39;t know WHAT I&#39;d do if I ran into a big oni with a completely blank face...</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> ...Right!? Kind of a masterstroke from me, don&#39;t you think? I wish you could&#39;ve seen the looks on their faces! Ehehehehe...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I&#39;m surprised to find them drinking here.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> No wonder the hallway stank of alcohol.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The two oni?<br> They do seem to be thoroughly intoxicated.</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong><br> Tch, it&#39;s the oni! And I was already in a bad mood... What gives...!</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong><br> ...Mash.<br> Do they do this kinda crap often?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes, I&#39;d say so.<br> I&#39;ve seen them like this several times before.</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong><br> Dammit, this is exactly why\u2013</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong><br> Ugh, they&#39;re annoying and I just can&#39;t with this freakin&#39; stench! Hey! Oni!</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Hm? Do I know you...?</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong><br> Do you, like, not know what a total pain you are being with all this drinking!? Get outta here!</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong><br> This is TOTALLY why people always say oni suck, or that they&#39;re clueless, or that they just like to attack when you&#39;re minding your own business...</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong><br> I mean, okay, so, like, that might&#39;ve led to a couple romantic encounters or something, but that really doesn&#39;t matter anymore!</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong><br> Just...shape the hell up and quit making trouble for me already, oni!</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> So you say we suck? That we are clueless?<br> Big words from a little fox! ...Wait... You&#39;re not actually a fox, are you...?</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> Well, well... If it isn&#39;t that Demon King&#39;s princess.<br> I&#39;m deliiighted to meet you.</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Hm? You know her, Shuten?</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> It&#39;s Suzuka Gozen, daughter of the Demon King of the Fourth Heaven.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> She lived in Japan long before I set foot in Ooe, so I haven&#39;t had the pleasure, but I&#39;ve heard aaall about her.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> ...Care to join us for a drink? Oni have sooo much in common with the daughters of Demon Kings. We should get along reeeally well. What do you say?</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong><br> Tch... So you know who I am.<br> Then I have A LOT more to say to you now.</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong><br> Your lazy asses are why I got sent to Japan in the first place. You caused me no end of trouble.</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong><br> Japan is just a few tiny islands. You could have turned it into a demon kingdom in a week if you actually cared! But nooo! You failed to do so.</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong><br> Easy to believe all you did was get drunk even then! I suspect you only bothered attacking humans when you were bored and felt like it!</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong><br> An oni who doesn&#39;t know her place is bad,<br> but a lazy oni is just infuriating.</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong><br> You&#39;ve got some nerve showing your lazy side to me. If you cannot be of service, then go take your useless hide somewhere and disappe\u2013</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> U-um...Suzuka?</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong><br> What?</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> Oh my, Suzuka. Listen to yooou!<br> It sounds like the reeeal you is starting to show!</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> I guess seeing an oni must have jolted you back to your true self, hmmm?</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong></p><p>...! I-I was...<br> That was just, like, an accident, &#39;kay?</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong><br> I just, like, could NOT be bothered to say how much you guys suck\u2013though you still totes suck!</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong><br> Ugh, I am, like, embarrassed AF. Wait, I mean...no I&#39;m not! Being a teenager is totes the best! We&#39;re cute, and awesome... We&#39;re just the best! Totes!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> S-Suzuka? You seem a little flustered.<br> You&#39;re also blushing bright red.</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong><br> I slipped... I can&#39;t believe I slipped...!<br> Being around those things forced my old self out...</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong><br> ...That side of me is old news; this is the real me now... But since I haven&#39;t been manifested here for long, I&#39;m still weak and immature... Even though...</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong><br> I decided that this time, I was gonna find true love...and stick with it...to the end... (Mumble)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Sh-she&#39;s just facing the wall and mumbling to herself!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I think we should, like, give her some space.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> She&#39;s, like, freaking me out.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Um, Senpai, I think her speech pattern may have...rubbed off on you a bit?</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong><br> ...Hra! There, I&#39;m back!<br> And I am a thousand percent better!</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong><br> Which is good, &#39;cause I&#39;m, like, gonna need all the energy I can get for this next part.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> N-next part? I&#39;m glad to hear you&#39;re feeling better now,<br> but...what comes next...?</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong><br> Oh come on, even you can totally figure that out, right?</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong><br> ...Put the fear of god into these punk-ass oni for sending me on a cruddy trip down memory lane!</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Mwahahaha. Did you hear that, Shuten?<br> I think the little demon princess is angry at us.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> Oh, how annoying.<br> I don&#39;t see why she doesn&#39;t just join us for a drink.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Uh-oh... I think we&#39;re about to get drawn into another battle. Be careful, Senpai!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Tch... I guess they&#39;re too tough for us.<br> C&#39;mon, Shuten. Let&#39;s go somewhere else.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> Hmm, maybe I had a little too much to drink...?<br> A little hair of the dog should help...</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong><br> (Sigh)...</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong><br> ...Just so you guys know, Master,<br> they were basically right about me.</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong><br> I&#39;m the daughter of the Demon King of the Fourth Heaven. I&#39;m just another Servant, just another Saber.</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong><br> But...that doesn&#39;t change the fact that I&#39;m a high school girl at heart. That&#39;s just who I am now. Capisce?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...Why did you pick that of all things?</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong><br> It&#39;s not about a choice!<br> It&#39;s about being true to myself above all!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Actually I&#39;m curious about that too.<br> If you don&#39;t mind, would you please tell us why?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Got it. All that matters is that you&#39;re cute.</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong><br> Aha, so you DO get it, Master.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Still, I&#39;m curious why you chose this of all things to begin with.</p><hr><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong><br> (Sigh)... Look, a lot of real crazy stuff went down while I was alive.</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong><br> Then, after I became a Heroic Spirit, I found out what modern high school girls are like, right?</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong><br> They&#39;re, like, the embodiment of popularity,<br> beauty, and cuteness. It&#39;s just, like, super fab.</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong><br> Plus, they enjoy life to the fullest! So I thought, this is it. This is what I&#39;ve been looking for.</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong><br> ...Totally makes sense, right?</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong><br> So my wish is to find the best boyfriend ever, have the best romance ever, and get the whole happily ever after thing, &#39;kay?</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong><br> So, to do that, I decided to be the best teenage high school girl ever.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Aha... Now I understand, Suzuka.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> You just really, really...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...REALLY want to find romance.</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong><br> ...Pretty much.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Hehe.</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong><br> Hey, don&#39;t you know it&#39;s, like, rude to laugh in people&#39;s faces!? C&#39;mon, let&#39;s go to this damn break room of yours.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Sure. I&#39;ll show you where it is.</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong><br> Well, well, now look who&#39;s all high and mighty...<br> I think it&#39;s, like, truth or dare o&#39;clock.</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong><br> So, as a fellow teenage girl, you&#39;re gonna tell me the truth about your experiences with boys when we get to the break room! C&#39;mon let&#39;s go.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Huh? Huh!? I...I never agreed to that...!</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong><br> Aha, don&#39;t bother running! You&#39;re not going anywhere!<br> Just, like, resign yourself to your fate!</p><h2 id="a-foxy-moron" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#a-foxy-moron" aria-hidden="true">#</a> A Foxy Moron</h2>', 340);
