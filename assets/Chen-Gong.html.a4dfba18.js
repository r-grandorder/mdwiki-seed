Although Chen Gong is cold-hearted/cool-headed, he is also endowed with the beliefs and passions of a military man just like that. An oath from his soul to \u201Cdie for the sake of his lord\u201D and to \u201Cdie together with his lord.\u201D In other words, that became the long-cherished desire of the strategist.</p><p>It is a \u201CHero Creation\u201D that can be done by Chen Gong, but limited to only Berserker-Class Servants.</p><h2 id="noble-phantasm-s" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#noble-phantasm-s" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Noble Phantasm(s)</h2><h1 id="jijiao-yizhen-the-two-pronged-single-formation" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#jijiao-yizhen-the-two-pronged-single-formation" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Jijiao Yizhen (The Two-Pronged Single Formation)</h1><ul><li>Rank: C</li><li>Classification: Anti-Army Noble Phantasm</li><li>Range: 10~50</li><li>Maximum Number of Targets: 1~60 people</li></ul><p>Chen Gong\u2019s wretched Noble Phantasm that uses the surplus parts of the Five Soldiers of the God of War that were made at the time of developing that weapon\u2026 as an ultra-small Magic Circuit super accelerator, something that would not be noticed by anyone either\u2026 and it temporarily super-strengthens an ally, granting them super attack power as it makes them reach a supercritical state. It is something that gives big damage to his opponents by sacrificing one Servant from his own army.

Despite appearing to have a scholarly bent of mind, Chen Gong is aggressive. A rational person who is like iron, suppressing fear on the battlefield with rationality and indifferently conducting himself in a dignified manner. He is a gallant warrior, a cold-blooded strategist, and a stubborn person who would never bend his own beliefs. Although he is also good at fighting on the frontlines, he will further make use of betrayals, surprise attacks and the like as reasonable schemes too if it is for the sake of victory.</p><p>Although he impartially receives his opponents\u2019 opinions/principles, Chen Gong will flatly reject them with \u201CBut I do not think that\u201D and crushingly defeat them thoroughly. It seems that figure of his that does not appreciate the hearts of men is seen as a ruthless machine.</p><p>That sort of Chen Gong further holds that \u201Cbehaving cold-bloodedly as a military man\u201D and \u201Cbehaving cold-bloodedly as a human being\u201D should be differentiated as well. During war, Chen Gong nonchalantly carried out all kinds of secret schemes, and yet he has attached an importance to \u201Cthe propriety of a human\u201D regarding people whom are not involved in the battles. He perceived Cao Cao to be a talented person of the same type as himself and served him, but during the time when he became aware of Cao Cao as a person who does not think that those two types of people should be differentiated, Chen Gong broke his friendship with Cao Cao during that same day to the extent that he left him then and there.</p><p>In addition, although Chen Gong has talent as a strategist, he was an expert with the bow in the first place. But he could not obtain all under Heaven by merely being skillful with the bow. He cast away the bow and studied military tactics in depth, saying \u201CSomething like one\u2019s individual armed might for example was of no importance.\u201D That premature plan was crushed precisely at the time when he saw L\xFC Bu, who could aim at all under Heaven with merely \u201Chis individual martial arts\u201D, and thereafter, it came to be that Chen Gong would act together with L\xFC Bu.</p><h2 id="attitude-towards-master" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#attitude-towards-master" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Attitude Towards Master</h2><p>The wish Chen Gong wants to make on the Holy Grail is complicated; there is\u2026 the ambition he gave up on during his lifetime\u2026 \u201CTo rule over the country and make (as far as he is concerned) the ideal society\u201D\u2026 but on the other hand, there is also the joy he has as a strategist: \u201CTo serve (as far as he is concerned) the ideal lord through thick and thin.\u201D</p><p>From the standpoint of Chen Gong, who is a realist that has an aggressive personality and hates pointless toil, modern society was an answer of sorts to him. When that matter is examined from his viewpoint, he says \u201CAh, it turned out like this, yes? In that case, is this not alright? If it is assured that the number of people in society dying pointlessly is less than half the total population, then it is possible to say that society is going smoothly.\u201D</p><p>One can say with confidence that ever since he became a Servant, the wish Chen Gong has as a strategist is being somewhat prioritized over his other wish, and he pushes his great expectations on his Master, his employer.<br> \u201CPlease, take care in being my Lord so that you can brilliantly run through the \u201Cplans\u201D that I myself had thought of but given up on.\u201D</p><h2 id="dialogue-examples" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#dialogue-examples" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Dialogue Examples</h2><p>\u201CGeneral L\xFC Bu, what are you doing?

Those last moments of his were a dialogue with Cao Cao in person and the execution of his penalty.</p><h2 id="character-in-fgo" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#character-in-fgo" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Character in FGO</h2><p>Chen Gong, whose year of birth, origin and lineage were assumed to be unknown, is a descendant of China\u2019s oldest civilization/the Xia Dynasty, and he is an engineer who inherited the documents and technologies of that civilization. Be that as it may, the weapons of the Xia Dynasty are not things humans can handle. Because they are merely things that cannot be handled by one if there is no Mystery (that is to say, no Magic Circuits) within their body, Chen Gong had ridiculed even those weapons, saying \u201CThis is such pointless knowledge\u201D, but upon observing L\xFC Bu having indications of his whole body being filled with lightning, his stance became \u201CAh, I discovered a qualified person\u201D, and it came to be that he was working hard on the development of Chinese gadgets. As L\xFC Bu had been tormented by a vigour that even he could not completely control by himself, the weapons provisioned to him by Chen Gong became altogether familiar to him, and since those weapons moreover appeased his anger for him as a result, it reached the point that L\xFC Bu was placing his trust in Chen Gong more and more.</p><h2 id="standard-weapons" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#standard-weapons" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Standard Weapons</h2><p>Since Chen Gong is a strategist, his attacks are basically something like \u201CHe points at his opponents \u2192 Things such as arrows and thrown stones fly over there to attack them.\u201D Because said person is also an expert with the bow, he will personally attack once in a while. He uses not only a bow, but also straight swords in a two-sword style.

In order to ascertain that fact, Chen Gong rushed over to Chaldea.</p><p>\u201CHahahahaha. Well, depending on how you look at it, that thing can even look like Lord L\xFC Bu. As one would expect, the anecdotes of the Flying General under Heaven are profound. As long as you can even self-destruct for me, yes\u2026 I do not in the least care about anything else then.\u201D</p><p><strong>Sima Yi</strong></p><p>Regarding the strategists whom appeared in the Three Kingdoms Period, this person was the most successful one among them. Even for Chen Gong, who finds out the flaws of someone without fail \u2013 no matter what sort of magnificent figure they are \u2013 and euphemistically points out those flaws, he can only hold his tongue in front of Sima Yi.</p><p>\u201C\u2026 Well, if I was still alive back then, I might have criticized him by saying \u201CIt is difficult to approach him because that flawlessness of his which surpasses Kongming is too impeccable\u201D, but\u2026 goodness gracious, for him to select a good-looking girl as his vessel is something unexpected.

His face is a rendition of Sugishita Ukyou\u2019s face from around the time where the detective appeared in the AIBOU preseason!!! I decided on making him sexy, given that I was given a specification in designing him as though he was a fiendish strategist with glasses. It\u2019s my own subjective view of the specification given to me. During his FGO debut, finding out that he was really that kind of character was so unthinkable to me, I laughed very, very hard so much.
