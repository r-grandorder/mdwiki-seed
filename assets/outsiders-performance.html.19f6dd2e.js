They rescue a puppy.</p><p><strong>Track 1</strong></p><p><strong>Rider:</strong> What\u2019s wrong, kid? Ever since we left the feast, you don\u2019t seem to have said much. Ate something bad?</p><p><strong>Waver:</strong> I didn\u2019t. I\u2019m just thinking about the battle from now on.</p><p><strong>Rider:</strong> Ohh, you got a little motivation now?</p><p><strong>Waver:</strong> [Sigh]</p><p><strong>Taiga:</strong> Whoaaa! You two over there! Get away from there right now! Whoa\u2013</p><p><strong>Waver:</strong> Ah? What\u2019s going on? There\u2019s a girl yelling something on the roof\u2026ah\u2026in Japanese, so I don\u2019t know what she\u2019s saying. Rider, what\u2019s she saying?</p><p><strong>Rider:</strong> She\u2019s telling us to get away from here.</p><p><strong>Waver:</strong> Huh!? You should tell me this kind of thing sooner\u2026 Aaaaaahhhh\u2013</p><p><strong>Taiga:</strong> [Falls]</p><p><strong>Sound Drama Fate/Zero Anthology Drama 3, The Outsiders\u2019 Performance</strong></p><p><strong>Taiga:</strong> Sorry!</p><p><strong>Waver:</strong> Ow, ow, owww\u2026 Just why would there be someone on the roof at this hour? Ah, Rider, translate for me!</p><p><strong>Rider:</strong> Hmm\u2026 Little girl, it\u2019s late at night, so why did you climb up onto the roof?</p><p><strong>Taiga:</strong> Um, I was chasing a thief. I followed that guy\u2019s path of escape and then for some reason I ended up on the roof of that house. Just when I was looking around to see if there were any more clues that the criminal left, since it\u2019s nighttime, I slipped, ehe~</p><p><strong>Rider:</strong> \u2026ehe~ \u2026was what she said.</p><p><strong>Waver:</strong> You don\u2019t need to translate that part! \u2026More importantly, she said she was chasing a thief\u2026? Was something stolen?</p><p><strong>Rider:</strong> Have you had something important stolen from you? (TL: Iskandar Stole the Precious Thing.)</p><p><strong>Taiga:</strong> Ah\u2026 The one who was stolen from was my friend. She manages my family\u2019s bar, and just now, they told us that someone smashed a reeeeeeeeeeally big hole in the wine cabinets!</p><p><strong>Rider:</strong> \u2026was what she said.</p><p><strong>Waver:</strong> \u2026Hey, Rider. The culprit she\u2019s referring to seems rather obvious\u2026</p><p><strong>Rider:</strong> \u2026I\u2019m afraid she means us.</p><p><strong>Waver:</strong> What the heck are you talking about it\u2019s absolutely certain you moron! Also, don\u2019t just include me as a criminal like it\u2019s nothing!</p><p><strong>Taiga:</strong> And then after they checked, they found that the entire barrel of high-class red wine they were going to give to my family was stolen!</p><p><strong>Rider:</strong> \u2026was what the girl said. Ah, girl, that\u2019s a misunderstanding. The wine barrel wasn\u2019t stolen, but plundered-</p><p><strong>Waver:</strong> Awawa\u2013 It\u2019s nothiiiing, just carry on\u2026 You, don\u2019t say unnecessary things!</p><p><strong>Taiga:</strong> Hmm? Ah, so then I thought that the thieves who took something as eye-catching as a wine barrel can\u2019t have run too far, right? So then, I thought I should chase down the criminal and take the barrel back!</p><p><strong>Rider:</strong> \u2026was what she said. Oh, your spirit of putting yourself on the line for your friend is worthy of praise! Your passion will certainly be rewarded and allow you to eventually find the person you seek!</p><p><strong>Waver:</strong> You\u2019re meeting him right now anyway\u2026</p><p><strong>Taiga:</strong> The criminal seems like he was on something like a horse carriage, since there were hoof marks and rutting on the ground, but for some reason, the tracks just disappeared halfway! The way they disappeared, it looks like they flew straight into the sky! Hey, you guys! Did you see something like a carriage on the street?</p><p><strong>Rider:</strong> \u2026was what she said.</p><p><strong>Waver:</strong> Uh, no, we didn\u2019t? We didn\u2019t see a carriage or anything\u2026</p><p><strong>Rider:</strong> Oh\u2026that\u2019s true. Anyway, that was originally a war chariot an absolutely not a horse carriage.</p><p><strong>Waver:</strong> That kind of thing is fine either way\u2026!</p><p><strong>Taiga:</strong> If they were really wandering around on the street in a carriage, it should be easy to run into them\u2026</p><p><strong>Waver:</strong> \u2026W-well, they did fly up into the air. \u2026A-anyway, if this is all, then it isn\u2019t good for us to disturb you, so we should really be\u2026</p><p><strong>Taiga:</strong> Ahaha!! There! Look at that river!</p><p><strong>Rider:</strong> Hmm?!</p><p><strong>Waver:</strong> What is it?</p><p>[Dog barking]</p><p><strong>Rider:</strong> That\u2019s\u2026 a puppy. There\u2019s a puppy in the shallows.</p><p><strong>Waver:</strong> The way it\u2019s going it\u2019s only a matter of time before it sinks completely\u2026 There\u2019s no other way, let\u2019s find a rope or something\u2026 Wait, hey\u2013</p><p><strong>Taiga:</strong> [Jumps into water] Eep, it\u2019s cold\u2026! And the current is too fast\u2026! Here, doggie, here! Hey stop moving around I\u2019ll slip and fall in\u2026woah! Aahhh! Don\u2019t\u2026</p><p><strong>Rider:</strong> Oh dear, such a reckless girl. Let\u2019s go, kid, we\u2019re going to help her, can\u2019t just leave her alone like that.</p><p><strong>Waver:</strong> Honestly\u2026 Where does all that energy come from\u2026</p><p><strong>Narrator:</strong> Right then, the mastermind causing chaos at the bottom of the sea near Fuyuki fell silent for a moment. At a time when clerics, communication engineers and magi were in a panicked frenzy, the butterfly effect which she started out of goodwill ultimately saved mankind. At this time, nobody knew of this fact.</p><p><strong>Track 2</strong></p><p>[Dog barking]</p><p><strong>Taiga:</strong> Ah\u2026 Just now, I thought I\u2019d die\u2026In the end you\u2019re OK as well, so it\u2019s great, just great~ Thanks, you two! If you didn\u2019t come and help, I might have drowned too~</p><p><strong>Rider:</strong> It\u2019s nothing, we just pulled you and the dog out of the river, it doesn\u2019t count for that much. \u2026Hmm? What\u2019s wrong, kid?</p><p><strong>Waver:</strong> [Panting] I\u2026I\u2019m not good at physical labour\u2026</p><p><strong>Taiga:</strong> Hmm~~ You over there, are you out of energy? That\u2019s not good~ You have to start exercising more every day~ If something bad really happens, the most reliable thing is your own strength~</p><p><strong>Rider:</strong> \u2026was what she said.</p><p><strong>Waver:</strong> [Panting] I don\u2019t mind. Apart from that, you actually jumped straight down, just what were you thinking!? Shouldn\u2019t you think about whether there are any other solutions first, before acting? This time you were lucky that we were next to you, but if you really got washed away, what were you going to do!?</p><p><strong>Rider:</strong> \u2026was what this kid said.</p><p><strong>Taiga:</strong> I did think it through first before going~</p><p><strong>Waver:</strong> When did you think about it?!</p><p><strong>Taiga:</strong> It\u2019s because I trusted you guys to save me if I was in danger that I jumped down!</p><p><strong>Waver:</strong> \u2026You\u2019re really too\u2026trusting of others. Don\u2019t you think you were being used when you were sent to find the wine barrel?</p><p><strong>Taiga:</strong> That won\u2019t happen~ My friend was in trouble~ It\u2019s natural to help out~ Either way I can\u2019t leave troubled people behind, so any bystanders might see it a what you said.</p><p><strong>Waver:</strong> Sacrificing yourself for a passer-by is too foolish. Here\u2019s some advice, if you don\u2019t learn to suspect others, one day you\u2019ll be punished for it.</p><p><strong>Taiga:</strong> What are you saying?! We\u2019re all friends! Isn\u2019t it natural to help each other in times of need? Suspecting them\u2026is something I can\u2019t possibly do. Even if it\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve met someone, I\u2019ll still believe in their kindness!</p><p><strong>Waver:</strong> That\u2019s\u2026sophistry.</p><p><strong>Taiga:</strong> You can say what you want, but this is what I believe in and I don\u2019t plan to give it up. Ehe~</p><p><strong>Waver:</strong> Honestly\u2026 What the heck, I\u2019m starting to think you\u2019re a little cute now. Hey, in that case, it\u2019s fine for me to like you, right?</p><p><strong>Taiga:</strong> Hmhmm~? You think I\u2019d surrender to you so easily~? First\u2026</p><p><strong>Waver:</strong> Oi\u2013 You must have translated what I said in a weird way! Translate properly for me!!</p><p><strong>Rider:</strong> Hmm\u2026 It\u2019s pretty boring to translate it that way\u2026 Out of consideration for you, I wanted to give you a chance to enjoy a romantic experience\u2026</p><p><strong>Waver:</strong> I don\u2019t need that unnecessary consideration from you! Anyway, I hate coarse and careless-</p><p><strong>Taiga:</strong> Aahhh\u2013!!</p><p><strong>Waver:</strong> What is it this time?!</p><p><strong>Taiga:</strong> That way! Second floor of that building! That must be the underwear thief that\u2019s infamous all over town! You two! Hurry up and get behind the building! I\u2019ll chase him from the front! Stop right there, you perverted thief\u2013!</p><p><strong>Waver:</strong> Hey\u2013 Whoa\u2026 She\u2019s gone already\u2026 What kind of speed is this\u2026?</p><p><strong>Rider:</strong> It\u2019s really lively this evening\u2026 Let\u2019s go to the alleyway and catch the perverted thief. Hurry up, kid!</p><p><strong>Waver:</strong> [Sigh]</p><p><strong>Narrator:</strong> Right then, the unprecedented giant earthquake that was about to happen under Fuyuki City was avoided. At a time when prophets, geologists and magi were in a panicked frenzy, the butterfly effect which she caused saved mankind from danger. At this time, nobody knew of this fact.</p><p><strong>Track 3</strong></p><p>[Dog barking]</p><p><strong>Taiga:</strong> [Humming]</p><p><strong>Waver:</strong> \u2026Alright, since we\u2019ve handed the underwear thief to the police, what are we still doing here?</p><p><strong>Rider:</strong> We\u2019re just helping the puppy find its owner while we\u2019re here. The owner\u2019s name is on its collar, and the police said that it would be better to give it straight to the owner\u2026</p><p><strong>Waver:</strong> [Sigh] \u2026I keep thinking we\u2019re just running in circles with her\u2026 Hmm? What\u2019s wrong, Rider? Why do you look so cheerful?</p><p><strong>Rider:</strong> Heheh, nothing. When I look at that girl, for some reason I think of someone I used to know. It was when I was a kid, back then there was also a guy who dragged me around like this.</p><p><strong>Waver:</strong> \u2026You had this kind of friend, too\u2026</p><p><strong>Rider:</strong> I guess so, and because of him, I expanded my horizons. Apparently, he began to show his talent after my death. As expected, he was an amazing man.</p><p><strong>Taiga:</strong> Hmm\u2026 The address they gave me should be right here\u2026 Ah! Found it!</p><p>[Dog barking]</p><p><strong>Rider:</strong> Hmm?! The puppy ran up to the door!</p><p>Girl: Biliz!</p><p><strong>Waver:</strong> What\u2019s going on?!</p><p>Girl: Biliz! Where were you\u2026? I was really worried!</p><p><strong>Taiga:</strong> I guess you\u2019re\u2026 This doggie\u2019s owner?</p><p>Girl: Uh, mhm. Was it you guys who brought him here, big sister?</p><p><strong>Taiga:</strong> Mhm! It got lost, but the owner\u2019s name was on its collar, so we went to the police station to ask for an address and brought it here. Ah, these foreigners helped a lot, too!</p><p>Girl: Thank you! Big sister! Big brothers! Thank you so much!</p><p><strong>Taiga:</strong> This kid is saying thank you to you~</p><p><strong>Rider:</strong> Hmm, you should understand this without a translation\u2026</p><p><strong>Waver:</strong> I wasn\u2019t really\u2026 I just happened to pass by\u2026 I just couldn\u2019t leave it alone.</p><p><strong>Rider:</strong> You can just honestly be happy, you know. Heheh, is it that you don\u2019t know how to react?</p><p><strong>Waver:</strong> Y-you\u2019re annoying!</p><p><strong>Narrator:</strong> Right then, the giant asteroid heading for Fuyuki City changed its course. At a time when end-of-the-world theorists, astronomers and magi were in a panicked frenzy, the butterfly effect which she caused saved mankind from danger. At this time, nobody knew of this fact.</p><p><strong>Track 4</strong></p><p><strong>Taiga:</strong> As~ I thought\u2026 It was right to go to her home~ It\u2019s great that she\u2019s so happy~</p><p><strong>Waver:</strong> [Sigh] Such a cheerful girl. You keep running around like this for other people, don\u2019t you have any troubles of your own?</p><p><strong>Taiga:</strong> Hmm\u2026 I still do, since I am, after all, a girl with lots of worries? For example, love, school, my future, with things like these I have plenty to worry about.</p><p><strong>Rider:</strong> \u2026was what she said.</p><p><strong>Waver:</strong> Your future, huh\u2026 It\u2019s true that your energy to act and ability to lead are commendable, even though sometimes you\u2019ll waste your effort, but even counting those times, it shows your charm. It wouldn\u2019t be a bad idea to consider those your strengths and make good use of them\u2026 Maybe you\u2019ll be suited to a profession where you instruct others. For example\u2026teaching, or something.</p><p><strong>Rider:</strong> \u2026was what this kid said. It\u2019s true that when I see you working hard to justify yourself, I can get what he\u2019s saying. In the past, my governor was also someone like you\u2026 Yeah, if you work a bit harder, soon you can become a teacher and guide those who seek knowledge. You may become a model teacher even better than that man!</p><p><strong>Taiga:</strong> Huh~~ Who\u2019s that? In any case, who\u2019s this governor you\u2019re comparing me with?</p><p><strong>Waver:</strong> Then, since everything\u2019s been resolved, we can part ways here. Go back home quickly, OK?</p><p><strong>Taiga:</strong> Ah, you two are going home? Then I\u2019ll continue looking for the wine barrel thief~ Thank you for your help! You really helped a lot!</p><p><strong>Waver:</strong> Is, is she still talking about looking for the criminal? Hey, Fuyuki hasn\u2019t been very safe lately, so wouldn\u2019t it be a bad idea to carry on searching? \u2026Ah, it\u2019s not like I\u2019m\u2026worried about you\u2026</p><p><strong>Rider:</strong> \u2026was what this dishonest kid said. Girl, on this subject, I have the same opinion. It\u2019s about time you went home, don\u2019t you think so?</p><p><strong>Taiga:</strong> But\u2026 I still don\u2019t know what happened to the wine barrel\u2026</p><p><strong>Rider:</strong> It\u2019s fine. Even though I\u2019m the King of Conquerors, to those who treat friendship with sincerity, I will still give a reward. Even though I don\u2019t know when it\u2019ll happen, please allow me to promise that the wine barrel will return to your side.</p><p><strong>Taiga:</strong> Huh? What do you mean?</p><p><strong>Rider:</strong> Then, let\u2019s leave now. Tonight really made me happy. After your goal is accomplished, let us meet again!</p><p><strong>Taiga:</strong> Ah, wait, I haven\u2019t told you my name yet. I\u2019m\u2026 Huh!? What\u2026was I going to say\u2026I\u2026Ah, that\u2019s right, I have to go home\u2026</p><p><strong>Waver:</strong> Alright, it seems like the suggestion worked. Then let\u2019s go, Rider!</p><p><strong>Rider:</strong> [Sigh] Say, kid, is this really OK?</p><p><strong>Waver:</strong> It\u2019s alright. The Grail War is heating up now, so we have to avoid contact with normal people, right? Anyway, from now on Fuyuki will become more and more dangerous at night. More importantly, I don\u2019t like coarse and careless girls.</p><p><strong>Rider:</strong> Heheh, let\u2019s just call it that. But your panicked look when you\u2019re with an outstanding girl like her is very memorable.</p><p><strong>Waver:</strong> That\u2019s, that\u2019s not true at all! Speaking which, you idiot! That thing with the barrel! Is it really alright to make a promise like that?</p><p><strong>Rider:</strong> No problem~ If it\u2019s just a barrel or two, we can just plunder the market over there-</p><p><strong>Waver:</strong> Hey\u2013 I\u2019ll think of something, so don\u2019t cause any more trouble!</p><p><strong>Track 5</strong></p><p><strong>Taiga:</strong> \u2026and in the end, I couldn\u2019t find the criminal who stole the wine barrel. For some reason, though\u2026 Some anonymous person sent a dozen barrels of high-class red wine to my friend\u2019s home. Ah~ We were really surprised back then~</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong> So this is what happened. Then, was it that encounter which became the moment you decided to become a teacher, Taiga?</p><p><strong>Taiga:</strong> Hmm~ After meeting that weird duo, I thought that communicating with people is really important~ So I started seriously learning English, and after that I just carried on to become an English teacher. \u2026Hmm, the ones who made me realise that I could become a teacher might have been them, after all.</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong> \u2026I see.</p><p><strong>Taiga:</strong> Huh~ What is it, Saber-chan~? Why do you look so happy~? Ah, is it that you know who those two are?</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong> About that\u2026 No, it\u2019s a secret.</p><p><strong>Taiga:</strong> Eh~ You\u2019re so cunning~ If you know something, tell me~ Please, pretty please~ If you don\u2019t, I\u2019ll tickle you~ Come on, Saber-chan~~</p>', 135);
