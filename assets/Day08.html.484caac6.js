I have to go thank her.&quot;</p><p>I get out of my futon and change into my uniform.</p><hr><p>I bet she&#39;s still sleeping, so I&#39;ll thank her during breakfast.</p><p>It&#39;s seven o&#39;clock already, so I&#39;ll go greet Sakura in the living room.</p><hr><p>&quot;S-Senpai.&quot;</p><p>Sakura has her bag.</p><p>Breakfast is ready as well.</p><p>The table is wiped clean, ready for us to eat at any time.</p><hr><p>&quot;Huh? Breakfast&#39;s already prepared?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh, yes. I made some for you and Saber-san, since I had the time.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...? For me and Saber? What about you?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh... um, I&#39;m fine. I&#39;m going to school, so please have breakfast with just the two of you.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;......&quot;</p><p>What&#39;s wrong, Sakura? It&#39;s weird for you not to eat when you&#39;ve made some for us. ...Did something happen yesterday?&quot;</p><hr><p>...It seems like I guessed right.</p><p>But nothing happened yesterday.</p><p>Sakura went to her room after dinner, and that&#39;s all.</p><p>I think something happened after that, but I don&#39;t remember too well because of my nausea.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Oh. I think you and Saber were talking here. I didn&#39;t hear it too well, but did something happen then?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...I said something awful. I got angry because of the terrible condition you were in.&quot;</p><p>&quot;You said something awful to Saber...?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...Yes. But I was in no position to tell her such a thing. But I treated Saber-san as if she was the only one at fault.</p><p>...I can&#39;t face her today, so...&quot;</p><p>That&#39;s why she made breakfast and wants to leave before Saber wakes up?</p><hr><p>&quot;...I&#39;m sorry, Senpai. I realized my foolishness right away and apologized to her. But Saber-san apologized to me instead. Even though I&#39;m at fault, she said it&#39;s because of her carelessness.&quot;</p><hr><p>She hangs her head.</p><p>...I see.</p><p>She must feel more self-hatred because Saber apologized to her when she should be the one apologizing.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Man, you two are stupid. It&#39;s my fault since I&#39;m the one who got hurt. You two shouldn&#39;t have fought over such a thing.&quot;</p><p>&quot;But, Senpai, I...&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;It&#39;s fine. Look, she doesn&#39;t give in if the other person is at fault. She&#39;ll yell back at you if you&#39;re being unreasonable. If she&#39;s apologizing, it means she sees your point.</p><p>I&#39;m sure Saber won&#39;t say it, but she likes you. She cares for anyone that tries hard.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015Yes. But I should reserve myself all the more.</p><p>Since Saber-san didn&#39;t scold me, I have to scold myself or I&#39;ll get carried away.&quot;</p><p>Sakura bows to hide her embarrassment.</p><p>It seems she&#39;s going to school early no matter what.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Man. I won&#39;t stop you if you say so, but what are you going to do at school so early? Morning practice is suspended right now.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;It&#39;s fine. I&#39;m going to clean the dojo. I said such an awful thing to Saber-san, so I&#39;m going to scrub the floor as punishment.&quot;</p><p>Sakura leaves with a goodbye.</p><hr><p>&quot;Cleaning the dojo? But that&#39;s pretty hard on you to scrub the floor during wintertime.&quot;</p><p>...Well, I suppose that&#39;s the point.</p><p>What did she say to Saber to make her go so far?</p><hr><h2 id="scene-01-challenging-the-shadow" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#scene-01-challenging-the-shadow" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Scene 01 Challenging the shadow</h2><p>&quot;What? A quarrel between Sakura and me?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Huh? Didn&#39;t you two argue? Sakura was apologizing.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...Now that you mention it, it may have seemed that way. But Sakura was correct, and she merely pointed out my lack of consideration...&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>Wow.</p><p>Saber is deep in thought.</p><p>Not only that, she&#39;s pondering so much that she&#39;s eating at incredible speed.</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh, I&#39;m sorry if I said something weird. Sakura seemed so worried about it that I ended up worried too. If it&#39;s not a big deal, just forget about it.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...Geez. You and Sakura are saying the same thing. Do not tell me you two are playing a prank on me.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Hey, we wouldn&#39;t play such an elaborate prank on you! What good would that be for us?&quot;</p><p>I don&#39;t even want to think of what&#39;d happen if I did play a joke on her and she found out about it.</p><hr><p>&quot;That is true. Then you must simply have been concerned for each other.&quot;</p><p>Nodding to herself, Saber digs into another omelet.</p><p>It&#39;s good to be able to eat a lot in the morning.</p><hr><p>&quot;But what did Sakura say? It takes a lot to get her that depressed. Is it all right if I ask?&quot;</p><p>&quot;U-Um. She merely pointed out my inadequacy as a Servant. In short, she told me I could not protect you because I did not have the skill.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...You&#39;re doing more than I can ask.</p><p>What happened last night was my own fault. You can&#39;t blame yourself for it.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;That is true, but... Sakura&#39;s criticism is correct. The problem is me, because I cannot assent.</p><p>I will continue taking you into battle, no matter what she tells me.&quot;</p><hr><p>She looks away awkwardly.</p><p>&quot;...?&quot;</p><p>Something is strange.</p><p>Why is Saber so preoccupied with something that they&#39;ve agreed on?</p><hr><p>&quot;...The residents grew suspicious and requested that the area be investigated\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><hr><p>The news is on.</p><p>I turned on the TV and found it broadcasting about an incident last night.</p><hr><p>&quot;...They found over thirty unconscious people, who were immediately taken to the hospital.</p><p>This is the seventh such incident this month, and the medical examination still believes the cause to be similar to food poisoning\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><hr><p>I finish breakfast and get ready for school.</p><p>I&#39;m going to go see Tohsaka.</p><p>I have to talk to her about what happened last night\u2015\u2015\u2015about Matou Zouken and that black shadow.</p><hr><p>&quot;...As the incident has spread to South Miyama 4th Avenue, the police believe the cause may be a spreading chemical spill\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><hr><p>South Miyama 4th Avenue.</p><p>That&#39;s the direction Tohsaka was staring at yesterday.</p><p>...Archer said the shadow is the cause of the incidents.</p><hr><p>...Over thirty people are in comas.</p><p>I&#39;ve experienced what they&#39;re going through firsthand.</p><p>That shadow is sucking magical energy from the people in this town, just like Caster.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>No, it&#39;s worse than that.</p><p>Caster was gentle and considerate compared to that thing.</p><p>Caster took care not to harm her victims, so that she could continue to drain them.</p><p>It&#39;s like collecting blood with a syringe.</p><hr><p>...But that thing is different.</p><p>That thing was not collecting blood like Caster. That thing was &quot;eating&quot;.</p><p>The black shadow was mercilessly feeding on magical energy along with people&#39;s minds.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015Saber. I want to talk to you before I go to school.&quot;</p><p>&quot;What is it, Shirou?&quot;</p><hr><p>Saber is watching the news as well.</p><p>Saber quietly questions me like always, even though she should know what I want to talk about.</p><hr><p>&quot;It&#39;s about our future plan of action. You saw that thing too, right?&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Yes. I have never seen its like, not resembling any of the fantasy race.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...Right. I don&#39;t know what that thing is.</p><p>But it&#39;s our enemy. It didn&#39;t look like a Master or a Servant, but it attacked me and Tohsaka, and now it&#39;s sucking magical energy out of the people in town.</p><p>Then\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...So our current priority is searching for that shadow?</p><p>We are to fight something that is neither a Master nor a Servant?&quot;</p><hr><p>Saber&#39;s stare is painful.</p><p>...Her goal is to obtain the Holy Grail.</p><p>But I&#39;m asking her to get involved in something completely unrelated.</p><p>It&#39;s natural for her to protest.</p><p>But still\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>&quot;Yes. I can&#39;t ignore that shadow. I think this is more important than the Holy Grail War.&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>Saber silently stares at me.</p><p>And when I start to think I can&#39;t bear it any longer...</p><hr><p>&quot;...Geez. I knew this was going to happen. I do not want to concern myself with that shadow, but...&quot;</p><p>&quot;Eh, Saber...? Um, is it all right...?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;My opinion does not matter, because you will try to do something by yourself even if I refuse.</p><p>I will be putting the cart before the horse. I cannot stay in this world if you die.</p><p>I can only obey, even if I am against your proposal.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Uh, you&#39;re right, but...&quot;</p><p>&quot;And I do not know how many more times you will be reckless if I leave you by yourself. It was the second time last night, so the third will certainly happen. I will have to apologize to Sakura again if that happens.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Then...&quot;</p><p>&quot;I am very reluctant, but Servants obey their Masters. I will lend you my sword if that is your decision.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Saber.&quot;</p><p>&quot;But Shirou, that shadow is no ordinary opponent. It would be easier to fight Berserker than it.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Ugh... Yeah, I felt that too.</p><p>It&#39;s not a matter of it being strong or not. That thing is just ominous. I don&#39;t think we can beat it merely by striking it.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;If you understand, then there is nothing else to say.</p><p>...But Shirou. To oppose that thing is to go down the most difficult path. Please keep that in mind.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;......? Well, of course I&#39;ll be careful. But why are you saying such a thing? Do you know what that shadow is, like Archer does?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...No. Like you, I know nothing about it.&quot;</p><hr><p>Saber looks away.</p><p>And Saber says...</p><hr><p>&quot;I vaguely feel that it is the ill star itself. It is like an inescapable curse that destroys everything.&quot;</p><p>...As if to express her ominous premonition.</p><hr><h2 id="scene-02-foreseeing-the-future" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#scene-02-foreseeing-the-future" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Scene 02 Foreseeing the future</h2><p>&quot;Let&#39;s start homeroom.</p><p>Go ahead, day duty... Wait, Aikawa-kun&#39;s absent, and Aimono-san&#39;s absent too? All right, I guess I&#39;ll go ahead. Stand up, every one.&quot;</p><hr><p>...Homeroom starts.</p><p>There are more absent people, giving the room a listless feel.</p><p>Well, I think the whole school is probably like this.</p><p>Fuji-Nee lightly continues homeroom, but I don&#39;t see her usual spirit either.</p><hr><p>&quot;So, you can&#39;t have any club practices after school.</p><p>That&#39;s all I have to tell you. Oh, your first period teacher, Kuzuki-Sensei, is absent, so you have self-study. I brought you all a handout, so work on that, everyone.&quot;</p><hr><p>Everyone unanimously cheers and starts moving their desks.</p><p>Fuji-Nee doesn&#39;t care if people work on the handout or not, so everyone&#39;s free to do anything as long as they don&#39;t go out of the classroom. But\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>&quot;Shirou.&quot;</p><p>...So why is she beckoning me to come see her in the hallway in such a suspicious manner?</p><hr><p>&quot;What, Fuji-Nee? It&#39;s class time, you know?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yeah, but I couldn&#39;t go see you this morning, right? So I got really worried and was wondering if you&#39;re all right.&quot;</p><p>&quot;...? What is it all of a sudden? What are you uneasy about?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Hmm, I don&#39;t really know. I just have this hunch.</p><p>Any time I get this hunch, you could get run over by a car or fall off a bridge. So I&#39;m wondering if you&#39;re all right.&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Man. That&#39;s normal. If you call that dangerous, I&#39;ve been in danger all my life.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Yeah, but I&#39;m just worried.</p><p>It feels like there&#39;s a train we have to get on together, but you&#39;re still at the platform and I&#39;m waving goodbye to you.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Hmm. That&#39;s pretty concrete... So you woke up after that?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh, you can tell? I woke up late because of that.&quot;</p><p>&quot;......&quot;</p><hr><p>I&#39;m speechless.</p><p>So she didn&#39;t come to my house because she just woke up late?</p><p>...Well, I&#39;ll forgive her, since that&#39;s what I expect from Fuji-Nee.</p><hr><p>&quot;Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;m like always. You&#39;ve got dark circles under your eyes, Fuji-Nee. You need more sleep.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Huh? ...Well, yeah. It was busy yesterday, and it looks like it&#39;ll be busy today as well. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll be able to go over to your place, since I&#39;ll be working overtime for a while. Much as I hate to say it, you don&#39;t have to make meals for me.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;What...?&quot;</p><p>&quot;That&#39;s all. Go and work on the handout. You&#39;re not doing too well in social studies, so you might fail if you don&#39;t go study hard.&quot;</p><hr><p>Fuji-Nee cheerfully waves goodbye and leaves.</p><hr><p>&quot;...I don&#39;t have to cook for her? Well, that makes it easier, but...&quot;</p><p>It&#39;s disappointing as well.</p><p>I feel empty as if my normal everyday life has disappeared.</p><hr><h2 id="scene-03-rin-s-advice" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#scene-03-rin-s-advice" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Scene 03 Rin&#39;s advice</h2><p>&quot;Yeah. I agree with you.</p><p>I can&#39;t ignore that shadow either. I don&#39;t know the magus behind it, but I can&#39;t let him run freely on my land.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Then can we still keep our peace?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Of course. We don&#39;t have much of an option until we eliminate the shadow.&quot;</p><hr><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015Our conversation ends really quickly.</p><p>I went to Tohsaka&#39;s classroom, class 2-A, during lunchtime to go get her.</p><p>I told her I want to do something about that &quot;black shadow&quot;, and her answer was simple.</p><hr><p>&quot;What do you want to do? Should we patrol together starting tonight or do things separately?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Let&#39;s see... I agree, we should divide the workload.</p><p>You can keep doing your nightly patrols. Investigate any place that you or Saber think is strange.</p><p>And I&#39;ll go after Zouken while you move around in the open.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...Matou Zouken? Does he have something to do with the shadow?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Who knows? It doesn&#39;t seem likely, since Zouken was more terrified than any of us, but something&#39;s bugging me.</p><p>...Well, we can&#39;t let him be, regardless. He&#39;s acting suspicious, controlling Caster&#39;s corpse and making a non-magus like Shinji into a Master.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015I see. You&#39;re right. Come to think of it, we joined hands against Caster. So we can&#39;t ignore that old man.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Right. Let&#39;s fight that shadow after everything else is taken care of. Even if you find it, don&#39;t fight and just investigate it. We have to prepare before we go for the kill.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Okay, but what are you going to do? You say you&#39;re going to follow Zouken, but do you know where he is?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Huh...? Oh, I don&#39;t know where he is, but I&#39;m going to go to the Matou household. My family is connected to them, so I&#39;m more qualified.&quot;</p><p>Tohsaka states it simply.</p><p>But her plan isn&#39;t that simple.</p><hr><p>&quot;G-Go to the Matou household!? That means you&#39;re going into the enemy base!&quot;</p><p>&quot;I know. What are you so surprised about? I&#39;m not going there to fight. I&#39;m just going to investigate.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;What\u2015\u2015\u2015are you stupid!? What if Zouken ambushes you!?</p><p>I can&#39;t let you go alone. I&#39;ll go too, so don&#39;t be so reckless!&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Hey, you&#39;re the one being rash here.</p><p>I told you, I know the Matou family. I know their magecraft, and I can tell how strong Zouken is from yesterday&#39;s battle. He&#39;s no match for me.</p><p>That old magus is using most of his magical energy to maintain his body, so he doesn&#39;t have a direct way to attack me.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;It&#39;d actually be convenient if he came at me head-on. And Shinji&#39;s harmless because he&#39;s not a Master anymore.</p><p>You can leave the stale fight between magi to me. You go ahead and collect information.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Mm.&quot;</p><p>I can&#39;t talk back if she can declare it like that.</p><p>...Archer will be with her, so I shouldn&#39;t worry that much.</p><hr><p>&quot;...All right. I&#39;ll leave Matou Zouken to you. Saber and I will look for the shadow.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes, please do. ...And Emiya-kun. Sakura is at your house, right?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...? Yeah, she&#39;s staying over. What about it?&quot;</p><p>&quot;No, it&#39;s nothing. I&#39;m just relieved to hear that.</p><p>It wouldn&#39;t be good if she happened to be at the mansion when I go, right?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh, you&#39;re right. ......I&#39;m surprised. You&#39;re really thoughtful.&quot;</p><p>&quot;H-Hey, why are you looking so surprised? What kind of a person did you think I was?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Well, um...&quot;</p><p>I thought she was like a storm, coming and going in a flash.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Humph. I don&#39;t care what you think of me.</p><p>Anyway, I&#39;m going to take care of Matou, so you stay quiet in your house until nightfall.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;All right. I&#39;ll leave it to you and go train with Saber. There&#39;s still some time until the sun sets.&quot;</p><p>I get up and head to the door.</p><p>Lunch break is almost over, so I should go back soon.</p><hr><p>&quot;Bye, Tohsaka. Let&#39;s meet here again tomorrow.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes. Let&#39;s exchange what we&#39;ve learned.</p><p>Oh, but Emiya-kun.&quot;</p><p>Tohsaka grins.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>...It&#39;s bad when she smiles like that.</p><hr><p>I get this bad feeling and hurry to the door, but...</p><p>&quot;I don&#39;t know about training.</p><p>Isn&#39;t there something else you could do with your free time?</p><p>Like caring for the girl living under your own roof?&quot;</p><p>...I&#39;m within her range.</p><hr><p>&quot;W-What are you saying, you idiot...!!</p><p>S-Sakura&#39;s nothing like that, and I&#39;m just having her stay over while Shinji&#39;s in a bad mood\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh. I meant you should let Saber get some rest. That&#39;s unexpected. Sakura&#39;s the first one to come to your mind when I mention the word &#39;girl&#39;?&quot;</p><p>She grins.</p><hr><p>&quot;Ah\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015, um, ugh\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>I can feel my face burning.</p><p>I feel like my brain is boiling. I half-expect steam to come shooting out of my ears.</p><hr><p>&quot;I&#39;m just joking. I&#39;m just getting back at you. Did you like that?&quot;</p><p>&quot;......Hey now. I would doubt your sanity if you liked such a thing.&quot;</p><hr><p>Strength escapes my body.</p><p>I feel like a marionette whose strings have been cut.</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh, right.

You didn&#39;t have a Magic Circuit even though you were born to the Matou family. But that&#39;s not your fault. The Matou blood was fading away anyway.

What? Stop that, Tohsaka. Why are you talking about Emiya!?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Because he&#39;s stronger than you. And he has the right qualities to be a magus. Emiya Shirou has something Matou Shinji does not.</p><p>...Yes, he doesn&#39;t have the talent, just like you. But he has the quality to be a magus. He is the best at it, and it&#39;s something he won&#39;t lose in.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;He&#39;s the best!? Him!? Hah, don&#39;t make me laugh, Tohsaka...!</p><p>There&#39;s nothing he has that I don&#39;t have! He&#39;s the one who&#39;s got nothing! He&#39;s just a lucky bastard that made a contract with Saber...!&quot;</p><hr><p>Shinji&#39;s hatred for Shirou must have blown his fears away, as he now faces Rin straight on.</p><p>The girl sighs and shrugs her shoulders.</p><hr><p>&quot;......I see. I guess you really are beyond help if you don&#39;t understand after all this. I thought I&#39;d hold you responsible, but you&#39;re not even worth it. I&#39;ll let you go, so go run to the church before Emiya-kun beats you.&quot;</p><hr><p>She turns her back on him.</p><p>Telling him she has no business here.</p><p>She heads for the door, not even bothering to treat Shinji as an enemy.</p><hr><p>&quot;I\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015I&#39;m inferior to Emiya...?&quot;</p><p>His voice burns with hatred.</p><p>But he can do nothing but watch her go.</p><p>He&#39;ll surely be killed if he attacks her here.</p><p>Even Matou Shinji can see the difference in their powers.</p><hr><p>&quot;Tohsaka\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015you, you......!&quot;</p><p>A voice filled with deep resentment.</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Geez, I guess it can&#39;t be helped.&quot;</p><p>She stops, and says goodbye to the boy that used to be the successor.</p><hr><p>&quot;Fine, this is the end, so I&#39;ll tell you.</p><p>Those who aim farther for others&#39; sake. Those who think of others before themselves. ...And those who hate themselves more than anyone.</p><p>These are the qualities of a magus. There is a place you can&#39;t reach, no matter how much talent you have.</p><p>...Humph. I never thought anyone would meet this condition. This is a contradiction you can only have if you&#39;re born broken.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Shinji. You&#39;re a good example of someone who nurtures a needless inferiority complex by despising others. You love yourself so much that you believe everyone else is below you, even when they are superior in every way.</p><p>...You&#39;re empty inside. The only one who thinks you&#39;re full is you, and you&#39;re just like a balloon.

Ever since she came, you&#39;ve been getting injured all the time. Now everything&#39;s back to normal.&quot;</p><p>&quot;What?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Isn&#39;t that right? I won&#39;t ask you what you were doing, but you were going out to help Saber-san, right?</p><p>Now that she&#39;s gone, you&#39;re not going to be exposed to danger anymore.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;You&#39;re wrong. I&#39;m going to keep going out at night, even though Saber&#39;s gone. ...Um, it&#39;s not that I was helping Saber. Saber was helping me.&quot;</p><hr><p>I stand up.</p><p>My tension is gone now that the treatment is over.</p><p>I&#39;m getting really sleepy.</p><hr><p>&quot;Eh\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Senpai?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Good night, Sakura.</p><p>And while we&#39;re on the topic... I&#39;ll be leaving my house a lot more often starting tomorrow, but you can keep using this place like you&#39;ve been.</p><p>I&#39;ll come home late, like tonight, but I don&#39;t want you to worry and go to sleep. Please don&#39;t wait by the door for me like you did tonight.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;............Okay. Good night, Senpai.&quot;</p><hr><p>I rest my body.</p><p>...I didn&#39;t feel it until now, but I&#39;m dead tired.</p><p>Drowsiness overtakes me the moment I lay down.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>But before I do so, I glare into the darkness to prepare myself.</p><p>What Saber lost against, and what I should be fighting...</p><p>I have to accept them here and now.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>...It hurts just to think about it.</p><p>My body is trembling, and my mind is about to lose against anger or fear.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015What I have to fight against...&quot;</p><p>It&#39;s that shadow.</p><p>That &quot;thing&quot; that attacks people without discrimination.</p><p>The black shadow that even Saber and Archer fear.</p><hr><p>...I know with certainty, even though I didn&#39;t see it.</p><p>That is what defeated Saber.</p><p>Assassin cannot defeat Saber.</p><p>So if there is something at the temple that can defeat her, it&#39;s that shadow.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>I have to beat the thing that beat Saber.</p><p>On top of that, I&#39;ll have to deal with Matou Zouken and Assassin.</p><p>Zouken said there&#39;s no more use for me now that I&#39;m no longer a Master.</p><p>But so long as I stay in the Holy Grail War and search for the shadow, Zouken will continue to haunt me.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>A shiver runs through my body.</p><p>Saber&#39;s not with me anymore.</p><p>I have no miracle that heals my wounds, and the only weapon I have is magecraft as a half-ass magus.</p><p>I know this is a reckless, suicidal choice.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015But I decided to fight. I said I&#39;ll become a superhero.&quot;</p><p>I lost Saber because of that.</p><p>I&#39;ve walked in Kiritsugu&#39;s footsteps ever since the fire because of that.</p><hr><p>My only option is to stop the war so such a disaster will not occur again.</p><p>...So this will be the only night that I&#39;ll tremble in fear.</p><p>When my wound heals and morning comes...</p><p>I have to act strong so the girl who disappeared can be proud of me.</p><hr><h2 id="scene-22-pupa-h" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#scene-22-pupa-h" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Scene 22 Pupa [H]</h2><p>The girl returns to her room.</p><p>She walks with heavy steps to her bed and sits on it.</p><hr><p>&quot;......Senpai. He&#39;s so badly injured, and still...&quot;</p><p>She doesn&#39;t know what happened.</p><p>The boy looked as lifeless as a starving man, and his body was covered with wounds.</p><p>The golden-haired girl who first appeared here several days ago has not returned.</p><p>From this, she can tell something has happened that can never be undone.</p><p>The boy is hiding something, and the golden-haired girl will not return as a result.</p><hr><p>&quot;......&quot;</p><p>But such things don&#39;t matter.</p><p>For her, such things are trivial.</p><p>She doesn&#39;t know what happened, but it&#39;s fine as long as the boy is safe.</p><p>For her, having Emiya Shirou come home is an unparalleled joy.</p><hr><p>&quot;......Wait... is it cold today...?&quot;</p><p>She shivers and brings her hand up to her forehead.</p><p>...It&#39;s hot.</p><p>Her body is burning up, and she has to fight to remain conscious.</p><p>It must be a light cold.</p><p>She rarely gets sick, but after waiting in the hallway for nearly three hours, it&#39;s hardly a surprise.</p><hr><p>&quot;.........Mm...&quot;</p><p>With sluggish movements, she reaches over and turns off the light.</p><p>She lets herself fall to the bed, lacking even the energy to change clothes.</p><hr><p>&quot;...It&#39;s fine. This is nothing compared to what Senpai is going through\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>The girl recalls what she saw a few minutes ago.</p><p>...The wounds on his back, almost as if the flesh had been grated.</p><p>...The blackening bruise on his stomach.</p><p>...His eyes, still strong and clear in spite of his condition.</p><hr><p>&quot;......Ah..... Mm, fu\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>Her temperature rises as she remembers.</p><p>The girl pretends not to notice that it stems from the hatred she feels.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Who could do such a thing?&quot;</p><p>...Yes.</p><p>She doesn&#39;t know who did it, but she can&#39;t forgive this person.</p><p>It&#39;s not temporary dislike or annoyance.</p><p>He has been wounded all this time, but he has stayed beautiful.</p><p>She cannot forgive anyone that hurts someone important to her.</p><hr><p>&quot;Hm... but... Senpai&#39;s back was amazing...&quot;</p><p>She reaches out her hand in a daze.</p><p>...It&#39;s been a while since she last saw his naked skin so close.</p><p>When they first met, he was small as a boy and was about as tall as her.</p><p>But in the two years since then, he has grown into a man.</p><hr><p>&quot;............Hm\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>Something stirs beneath the sheets.</p><p>Trapped between her body and the bed, her hand slowly creeps down between her legs.</p><hr><p>It&#39;s different from when he collapsed from a cold.</p><p>Back then, it was a cold and nothing more.</p><p>Tonight, it was the body of a wounded man.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Senpai.&quot;</p><p>Thinking about it causes her to space out.</p><p>He must train without a day&#39;s rest.

It has the beauty of having inner strength, one that allows it to jump up precipices, that is not apparent.</p><hr><p>&quot;Yeah... His chest was broad\u2015\u2015\u2015he was a real man.&quot;</p><p>Her outstretched fingers run across the chest that is not here.</p><p>She unconsciously runs her fingers across his body.</p><p>They run from his chest down to his stomach.</p><p>Crawling across the bedsheets, her fingers travel below her belly button and...</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Oh.&quot;</p><p>Her face turns bright red.</p><hr><p>&quot;S-S-S-S-Stupid me...!</p><p>I-I&#39;m sorry, Senpai...!&quot;</p><p>She quickly pulls her hand back.</p><p>She even turns her ears red and curls up on the bed.</p><p>It shouldn&#39;t be this embarrassing, but her memory is too vivid.</p><p>The feel of his skin beneath her fingertips only made her imagination more concrete.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Huh\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015?&quot;</p><p>But...</p><p>Is that what caused her to heat up?</p><p>&quot;Ah\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015mm, fuh......\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>Her heart starts to beat faster.</p><hr><p>&quot;Mm......

Hm, ah... Ah, mm... Fuh\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>...Her breaths are unbelievably hot.</p><p>Is it because the heat is escaping from her body?</p><p>The heat invades her brain and melts her memory, intelligence, reason, and morals, making her think of only one thing.</p><p>&quot;Ah, hah... Senpai... Hm...&quot;</p><p>The heat takes over her body, and the limbs are out of her control.</p><p>But dirty desire creeps up from within her.</p><hr><p>&quot;Ah\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015haa, ah, hm\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015!&quot;</p><p>She doesn&#39;t stop.</p><p>She moves her fingers, which were just tracing Shirou&#39;s body, down between her legs.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Senpai... Senpai, Senpai, Senpai...!&quot;</p><p>...Her fingers start to move wildly as if to match her breathing.</p><p>The wet sound slowly gets louder into something indecent.</p><hr><p>&quot;Ah\u2015\u2015\u2015hm...

Thinking about the blood on his back makes her dizzy.</p><p>The girl who won&#39;t be coming back. The realization that, once again, he is all hers. Many lies.</p><p>The dark emotions, unthinkable for her usual self, draw her down into a darker passion.</p><hr><p>&quot;Hah, haa, ha, mm...! Sen... pai... Ah, I, I\u2015\u2015\u2015ah... Hm... no...!&quot;</p><p>But those are trivial matters.</p><p>What she&#39;s truly glad about is that the boy has come back to her.</p><hr><p>&quot;Nhaa...!

Is this a lot from the supervisor&#39;s perspective, Kotomine?&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015I can&#39;t say much as of this moment. This is the first instance of large-scale unconsciousness, but there&#39;s no problem if it stays this way.

It should not be an amateur, so it should know its limits.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Is that so? That worm-user does not seem like it, but such a person will become a curse if you do not take care of it quickly. It is not my style to watch people in this town die.&quot;</p><hr><p>This statement takes Kotomine by surprise.</p><p>This man, who does not care about anyone else, is concerned for the people.</p><hr><p>&quot;I&#39;m surprised. What is going on, Gilgamesh?&quot;</p><p>&quot;It should not be surprising. I do not like it when people are killed by someone besides me. People will lose their way with boring crime and punishment. Such pain is not entertaining at all.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...I see. Then you are indeed a heroic spirit.</p><p>You use death to save people from the agony of life. Then your wish is death?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Of course. This age is filled with meaningless, worthless people.

The only thing I have is the desire for clear pleasure.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Ha\u2015\u2015\u2015Hahaha, I see, so you only have pleasure\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015!&quot;</p><hr><p>The man starts laughing at the simple answer.</p><p>It&#39;s as if he&#39;s delighted and proud of his partner.</p><hr><p>&quot;All right. I shall kill because they are disgusting, and you shall kill because it is fun. Our motives are different, but we seek the same thing from the Holy Grail.

I shall do as I please.&quot;</p><p>The man&#39;s presence disappears.</p><p>The priest glances at the exit of the silent stone room.</p><hr><p>&quot;He seems insane, but he is sane at the core.
