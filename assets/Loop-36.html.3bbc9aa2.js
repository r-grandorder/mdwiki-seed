Here, the money.\u201D</p><p>Caster took the triangular crepe box without looking back, casually handing me a 500 yen coin.</p><hr><p>\u201CUm... that&#39;s not quite enough. It was 80 yen more than that.\u201D</p><p>\u201C............\u201D</p><p>Hey.</p><p>No good. She&#39;s not listening.</p><hr><p>It can&#39;t be helped, I&#39;ll just eat my own portion.</p><p>Mine is the clerk&#39;s recommendation: Banana with fresh chocolate caramel cream.</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015Delicious. This is really tasty.</p><p>Even considering how hungry I was, it&#39;s superb.</p><p>The name&#39;s way too long though. I guess it has to do with the crepe&#39;s luxurious taste.</p><hr><p>I only thought about it after leaving, but the food cart seems to have a good reputation. I think Sakura might have mentioned it before.</p><p>However, even though it seems abnormally high in calories, it&#39;s easy on the stomach. Sakura had better avoid it.</p><hr><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015Now then.\u201D</p><p>Caster on the other hand, as if the taste was unimportant, stuffed her mouth greedily, crushed the wrapper into a ball and threw it behind her.</p><hr><p>\u201CUghhh...\u201D</p><p>I let out a sigh while catching her garbage,</p><p>and lovingly sent it into the waste bin with an overhead shot.</p><p>Glued to a van parked along the street, she&#39;s secretly spying on two people walking together a little further away.</p><hr><p>The first: Caster&#39;s silent husband, Kuzuki Souichirou.</p><p>The other: My unfaithful older sister and a teacher, Fujimura Taiga.</p><p>For the time being, they&#39;re behaving like work associates... yeah, that makes sense. Good.</p><hr><p>Come to think of it, while on the way to meet Issei at the temple, I&#39;d been caught by this witch, forced to stand-up my appointment, and had been marching around the city like this for about an hour and a half.</p><p>Right about now, Issei&#39;s probably furious.</p><hr><p>Before I realized it, somehow we had left Miyama city and were in the middle of Shinto.</p><hr><p>We made our way across the big bridge, moving from pillar to pillar on the roadway to hide ourselves, all while being continually peppered with blaring car and truck horns.</p><p>If those two haven&#39;t noticed us already, I can&#39;t help but think there is some sort of magic at work.</p><p>The saying, &quot;a young maiden is blinded by love&quot; seems to hold true.</p><hr><p>......Hmm?</p><p>What&#39;s with this sudden sense of unease?</p><p>Maybe I should just tell this &quot;maiden&quot; in love to reluctantly give up.</p><hr><p>Along with the target, we continue to move forward.</p><p>I poke Caster&#39;s shoulder as she&#39;s standing in the shadow of a bus-schedule sign.</p><hr><p>\u201CHey, Caster?</p><p>Personally, I think we should just give up following them any further...\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><p>No response.</p><hr><p>\u201C...Hey, Caster.\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><p>Again, no response.</p><hr><p>\u201CHey, Casty, come on already.\u201D</p><p>..................!!!</p><p>Your heel...!

Naturally, when a man and a woman are alone together, an extreme situation is very possible to occur.</p><p>Maybe it&#39;s too early for a boy like you to understand?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CSo you&#39;re saying that\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><p>\u201CAh!

I&#39;ll turn you into a pig!\u201D</p><p>Hiiee...!</p><p>Stop saying those things with such a serious face!!!</p><hr><p>\u201CWait, calm down Caster.</p><p>Listen. As far as I know, within Fuyuki city, no, all of western Japan, the last person you&#39;d need a &quot;marital investigation,&quot; &quot;household search,&quot; or whatever for, is the person who doesn&#39;t care about marriage or the other sex: none other than Miss Fujimura Taiga.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015Achoo!

Oah\uFF5E\u201D</p><p>\u201CWhat&#39;s this, Neko-kun? Caught a cold? It&#39;s a good idea to drink at times like these.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CHuh...? That&#39;s strange, which one&#39;s which?</p><p>No, whatever the case is, it&#39;s just too unrealistic!\u201D</p><hr><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015But, facing her with such fervor, Caster&#39;s eyes don&#39;t show even a trace of understanding.</p><p>\u201CYou&#39;re trying to insist that this female tiger is harmless!?</p><p>However! In reality, those two setting such an obvious tryst on display makes you not convincing in the slightest!\u201D</p><p>\u201CAs I said, that&#39;s\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><hr><p>...Wait a minute, what&#39;s Fuji-Nee doing?</p><p>Early this morning, she left for no specific reason I thought.</p><hr><p>\u201CWell, I thought it had to do with work. Preliminary inspections or something.\u201D</p><p>\u201CToday&#39;s supposed to be a day off for Homurabara. If he&#39;s doing extra work or overtime, Souichirou-sama tells me without fail!\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201COooh. That&#39;s a newlywed for you, how considerate.\u201D</p><p>\u201CYes, that&#39;s right\uFF5E</p><p>&quot;I&#39;ll be late. Eat without me please.&quot; he would say.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201COh.

Then, treat this like a rehearsal.</p><p>Just like we would heading to the staff room, let&#39;s give them a small greeting.\u201D</p><p>Then, no sooner than I started walking, my arm is pulled back.</p><p>Turning around, I see Caster shaking her head vehemently from left to right.</p><hr><p>\u201C*N-*<em>No</em>, absolutely not!\u201D</p><p>\u201CWhy not?\u201D</p><p>\u201CI-Ignorant child!</p><p>While awaiting the return of their husband, a wife should\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><p>The moment Caster raised her voice, Kuzuki-sensei abruptly turned around.</p><hr><p>\u201CAh, Sensei, hay fever?</p><p>Lately it seems even autumn is difficult right? I don&#39;t have any problems, though.\u201D</p><p>\u201CNo. Just for a moment, I thought I heard a familiar voice.\u201D</p><p>\u201CThe more you gossip, the worse the pollen gets they say.\u201D</p><p>\u201C......Is that... a new urban legend?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CHah... hah... too close...\u201D</p><p>\u201CAs I thought, Kuzuki-sensei is suspicious.\u201D</p><p>\u201CWha!\u201D</p><p>Hiding behind a shop&#39;s clothing display, Caster scowls.</p><hr><p>\u201CWho dares to say such a thing!?\u201D</p><p>\u201CSo, &quot;if it&#39;s about the husband in question, I don&#39;t want to hear it,&quot; it&#39;s like that, huh?\u201D</p><p>\u201C......I wonder what you&#39;re talking about. I think you were a little cuter when you were being obedient.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CAre you saying I&#39;m gullible?\u201D</p><p>That&#39;s kind of upsetting.</p><p>However, they say you should take a fresh look at a man you haven&#39;t seen for even three days.</p><hr><p>\u201CEven I have changed.</p><p>Getting caught up in a household that has become absolute pandemonium, whether I like it or not...\u201D</p><p>\u201CReally, what could those two be doing?</p><p>Ah, they&#39;re moving again.\u201D</p><p>\u201CCaster?\u201D</p><p>...isn&#39;t listening.</p><p>She just goes wherever she wants...</p><hr><p>\u201C............\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C...Seriously though, I&#39;m getting hungry.

For a man, it&#39;s just unsightly!\u201D</p><p>\u201CWell then, good luck on the rest.\u201D</p><p>\u201C...ghh...!</p><p>W-Wait, wait, waiiiit\u2015\u2015\u2015!!\u201D</p><hr><p>Holding onto my leg, Caster gets pulled along, sliding across the smooth floor like a snow sled.</p><p>I disregard her and walk briskly.</p><hr><p>\u201CIt&#39;s not like I don&#39;t understand your worries, Caster.</p><p>However, it isn&#39;t a good hobby; following people around like this.\u201D</p><p>\u201CBu-...Buuut...\u201D</p><p>\u201C...But?\u201D</p><p>Shocked at seeing Caster sitting formally on her knees and in tears, I finally stop moving.</p><hr><p>\u201CB-But for me to keep following them alone is\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><p>I would be some strange person, no, more like someone&#39;s wife following her husband&#39;s illicit love affairs!\u201D</p><p>\u201CThat&#39;s exactly what you&#39;re trying to do though.</p><p>...But okay, I don&#39;t mind.

Tomorrow the morning newspaper&#39;s front page is mine!\u201D and Saegusa&#39;s, \u201CEh? What is it Maki-chan?\u201D and Himuro&#39;s, \u201CHmm.\u201D but now was not the time to worry about that...</p><p>...Au-...aaauuuuuouou...(crying)</p><hr><p>\u201CWHERE THE HELL DID THEY GO!?\u201D*</p><p>Now that we&#39;ve run as far as halfway around the mall, the parking lot security guard has started yelling at us.</p><p>I already don&#39;t care how this looks anymore.</p><hr><p>\u201CIsn&#39;t that them?\u201D</p><p>The two of them right then, climbing up the log staircase of what looked like a cottage style store, disappear inside the door.</p><hr><p>\u201C...A coffee shop... it seems?\u201D</p><p>\u201CAppears so. Aah, what a relief.</p><p>It&#39;s not a love hotel.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CNow, let&#39;s go.\u201D</p><p>\u201CYeah, of course.\u201D</p><p>My bangs are important,</p><p>but as it turns out, my life is even more important.</p><p>That mysterious sword, it cuts better than expected.</p><hr><p>With precise timing, we slip in through the shop&#39;s open door right as another customer is leaving.</p><p>\u201CWelcome!\u201D The waitress attempts to greet us, but becomes completely rigid after the first word.</p><p>Almost as if being stared down by Rider.</p><p>From the back, I put my index finger to my mouth, appealing to her with desperate eyes.

Changed jobs again?\u201D</p><p>As I remember, even though my recollection is extremely vague on this matter, Lancer was working somewhere else wasn&#39;t he?</p><hr><p>\u201CThe last store managers begged me in tears.</p><p>Pleading me to take somethin&#39; like flowers or the stuffed toys strewn about instead of the usual severance pay.\u201D</p><p>\u201CI see.\u201D</p><p>Aren&#39;t they just making him clean up?</p><hr><p>\u201CWhatever, just get your dirty fingers off me.\u201D</p><p>\u201CWhoops, my bad.</p><p>I wanted to try feeling those ears. Just once.\u201D</p><p>\u201CI know what you mean, Lancer.\u201D</p><p>\u201CRight?\u201D</p><hr><p>Involuntarily, just as he was letting go, Caster&#39;s ears twitch.</p><p>\u201C\u201CThey moved!\u201D\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CHow rude. Souichirou-sama is the only one who can touch my ears!\u201D</p><p>\u201CHooh? He&#39;s touched them has he?\u201D</p><p>\u201CShut your mouth, you stray mutt! Mongrel! Cur!</p><p>Dogs that can&#39;t be tamed should be chopped up and used as shark bait!\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CThe equivalent nowadays would be a gas chamber.\u201D</p><p>\u201CThat&#39;s fine as well.\u201D</p><p>\u201CHahaha. That&#39;s the spirit, Miss Witch! Now aren&#39;t ya acting more like yourself?</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015So. You&#39;re not actually gonna tell me you came here to order water right?\u201D</p><hr><p>Taken aback, Caster makes eye contact with me.</p><p>Bringing up a menu as a shield, we quickly hide our faces behind it.</p><hr><p>\u201CHmm? Looks like there&#39;s some noisy customers today.</p><p>Even after going through all the trouble of trying to find a place that looked quiet.\u201D</p><p>\u201C............\u201D</p><p>\u201CBy the way, how is it, Sensei? That Noodleberry&#39;s flavor?\u201D</p><p>\u201CIt&#39;s &quot;Nilgiri.&quot;\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CWe weren&#39;t found out... I think?\u201D</p><p>\u201C...Apparently...\u201D</p><p>Caster&#39;s face comes very close to mine and I can see her break into a cold sweat.</p><p>Though she had been crying and fuming for the last while, now that I look closely at her, she really is an unbelievable beauty. Who would leave a wife like this alone to go fooling around with another woman...?</p><hr><p>\u201CWhat&#39;re you two doing?</p><p>Hm? Don&#39;t want another customer to spot you?\u201D</p><p>Lancer smirks as he watches us.</p><p>\u201CActually, the truth is...\u201D</p><p>\u201C...tch... Don&#39;t say anything unnecessary.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201COkay, boy. Order anything you like. We&#39;ll look suspicious otherwise.\u201D</p><p>\u201CThis is your treat right?\u201D</p><p>\u201CWe&#39;ll take separate bills, obviously.</p><p>I didn&#39;t come here for a date with you, boy.\u201D</p><p>Then, why we came here,</p><p>was to commit a crime?</p><hr><p>\u201CHow about this?</p><p>The Kenya and Rwanda blends. I tried them, and they&#39;re surprisingly splendid.\u201D</p><p>\u201CFine, we&#39;ll go with that. Two of them.\u201D</p><p>Caster tries to shoo Lancer away.</p><p>What staggering rudeness.</p><hr><p>\u201CUnderstood. Just one moment please.\u201D</p><p>Lancer steps back in a very well mannered fashion.</p><p>He&#39;s acting like a genuine waiter. He&#39;s so courteous, it makes me wonder if he isn&#39;t more suited toward the service industry rather than fighting.</p><p>Then, after getting distracted by thoughts of the Servant next to me, reality comes crashing down as I study the menu carefully.</p><hr><p>One, seven, circle, circle.</p><p>Eh? What? 1,700 yen?</p><p>There are beverages that are expensive enough to have commas in their prices?</p><hr><p>Possibly, they provide a whole pot. However, one cup still shouldn&#39;t cost more than 500 yen.</p><p>Not to mention, the bottom of the menu is filled with prices over 2,000 yen.</p><p>Do they even drink several servings of this a day?</p><p>Ireland, what an amazing country!</p><p>That explains how cheap junk food like Fish and Chips became a staple in their diet.</p><hr><p>Now then, I concentrate on listening in on the conversation at the table of the two in question.</p><p>As usual, Kuzuki-sensei isn&#39;t saying anything while Fuji-Nee is talking up a storm.</p><p>Still, something seems completely out of place with her tone.</p><p>There&#39;s tension mixed in with her voice. Like she doesn&#39;t know how to bring up what she really wants to talk about.</p><hr><p>Caster throws them a glance while stooping downward.</p><p>\u201CFor a while now, it seems like they&#39;ve been avoiding places where there are students or others who may know them, don&#39;t you agree?\u201D</p><p>\u201C...If you think so, probably.</p><p>Though with the mistakes Fuji-Nee tends to make, she could just as easily head to a restaurant and end up at a laundromat.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CIs that even possible?\u201D</p><p>\u201CMore likely, she was just lured in here by the &quot;Grand Opening Sale&quot; sign.\u201D</p><p>\u201CFor such a reason...\u201D</p><p>\u201CThat&#39;s even if there was a deeper meaning to her actions. Personally, I think the &quot;human&quot; known as Fuji-Nee has always been beyond comprehension.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C...Then, even when she came out of that model shop shouting, it was probably because the epoxy was sold out\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><p>\u201CHuh? They stopped by such a place?\u201D</p><p>\u201CThat&#39;s right.\u201D</p><p>Epoxy?</p><hr><p>\u201CWhy is Souichirou-sama, with such a woman...?\u201D</p><p>Caster bites her nails.</p><p>\u201CNo, like I said, don&#39;t look too deep into it.\u201D</p><p>\u201CJust because they were out of stock...\u201D</p><p>\u201C............\u201D</p><hr><p>Even though this is such a high-class shop, I&#39;ve never been so uncomfortable.</p><p>Fuji-Nee, this is all because you didn&#39;t take action early on to clear up this misunderstanding.</p><p>Quickly, even one of your typical teaching stories would ease the tension.</p><p>I&#39;m depending on you. Do it!</p><p>...Then, at the side of my elbow resting on the table as I prayed, a face appears.</p><hr><p>\u201CIt&#39;ll get cold.\u201D</p><p>\u201CUugh\u2015\u2015\u2015L-Lancer...\u201D</p><p>\u201CWhen did... I didn&#39;t even notice you...\u201D</p><p>Steam rises from the cups as Lancer sets up tea for two without so much as making a sound.</p><hr><p>\u201CWho do you think I am?</p><p>The Son of the Light of Ulster. The Waiter of the King&#39;s Spear!</p><p>Drink up before it gets bitter.\u201D</p><p>\u201CDid <em>you</em> brew this?\u201D</p><p>\u201CAs I just said, I&#39;m the waiter.</p><p>The brewing was done by that demon of an old man hidin&#39; back in the kitchen.\u201D</p><hr><p>Squatting near the table without drawing attention, Lancer&#39;s eyes narrow.</p><p>\u201CYour targets are those customers?</p><p>That&#39;s Kuzuki, ain&#39;t it?\u201D</p><p>\u201C......tsk.\u201D</p><hr><p>The atmosphere changes.</p><p>While not looking away from the teacups, the spear user&#39;s overpowering presence comes flowing to us.</p><hr><p>\u201COi, oi. Stop it.\u201D</p><p>While acting innocent, Lancer freely pours from the pot of tea.</p><hr><p>\u201CI&#39;d be ruined if I turned my lance against a customer.</p><p>I&#39;d get canned again, which I&#39;d rather avoid if possible.\u201D</p><p>\u201CBe serious.\u201D</p><p>\u201CGot it! I am a diligent soldier.\u201D</p><p>\u201COnly those with no merit have to wag their tail to an employer.\u201D</p><p>\u201CYeah yeah. Ah, it&#39;s best if you don&#39;t mix anything in.\u201D</p><hr><p>Keeping her stiff expression, Caster brings the cup to her lips.</p><p>Then, her expression softens with a surprised look. Her ears twitch again.</p><p>\u201C...It&#39;s good!\u201D</p><p>\u201CIt&#39;s true. This is... I see, something this pricey should be.\u201D</p><p>\u201CRight? What&#39;d I tell ya?\u201D</p><p>He says with a self-satisfied smile.</p><hr><p>The tea swirling inside the cup has a very dark copper-like color, yet is also completely transparent. There is barely even a hint of bitterness in the flavor as well.</p><p>There&#39;s even a slight sweetness. With this, it&#39;s actually better without milk. This flavor brings out the very essence of tea.</p><p>The malicious aura surrounding Caster dissipates as she lets out a sigh, the tension in her shoulders is slipping away.</p><p>The background sounds return.</p><hr><p>\u201CBy the way...</p><p>It&#39;s the first time meeting your Master, but I recognize the lady he&#39;s sitting with.\u201D</p><p>\u201CEh?\u201D</p><p>\u201CShe&#39;s my fishing pal after all.</p><p>That girl, the only thing she&#39;s concerned with is food.\u201D</p><hr><p>Aah, so that&#39;s why... Embarrassed, I bury my face in my hands.</p><p>\u201CSounds just like her, that thieving tiger.\u201D</p><p>Sorry. I&#39;m an accomplice.</p><hr><p>\u201CHey, lad. It&#39;s about time you fill me in.</p><p>All this. What&#39;s going on?\u201D</p><hr><p>I give a brief recount of running into Caster and the circumstances leading to us tailing Fuji-Nee.</p><p>\u201CI see now. Caster&#39;s anxiety is only natural then.\u201D</p><p>\u201CYour understanding is appreciated. However, you say that with an <em>unpleasant</em> persuasive power.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CAlright. Then, I guess I&#39;m off to do a bit of snooping.\u201D</p><p>\u201CWai... Lancer...!\u201D</p><p>\u201CWhaat? The investigation service is on the house.\u201D</p><p>He&#39;s playing detective.</p><hr><p>\u201CHow about another serving of tea?\u201D</p><p>\u201CGimme anoth... I mean, please. It was really delicious.</p><p>But, are refills included?\u201D</p><p>\u201COn this day of the week at this time, we offer refills to customers wearing stripes.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CEh, striped service?\u201D</p><p>\u201CYep.\u201D</p><p>\u201CThat&#39;s too bad. Next time you wear stripes too, Sensei!\u201D</p><p>\u201C...Indeed.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CSouichirou-sama, your underwear is striped!\u201D</p><p>\u201CListen, I shouldn&#39;t even have to tell you what&#39;s wrong with that.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CExcuse me, the young wife here, have we met before?\u201D</p><p>\u201CEh? W-W-Wiiife!?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CTh, T-That&#39;s not\uFF5E ...uhaah, oh my.\u201D</p><p>\u201COh? Did I jump to the wrong conclusion?</p><p>Just like your tea set, you match each other well. Perfectly.\u201D</p><p>\u201CB-But, you know\uFF5E. What to do\uFF5E\u201D</p><p>\u201CHaah.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CT<em>ThaAaa</em>T<em>tw</em>woOm<em>aAAaN.\u201D</em></p><p>\u201CShe stabbed the table, she stabbed through it!</p><p>Put it away! Put away that strange blade!\u201D</p><p><ruby>It&#39;s a state of emergency<rt>Run For Your Life</rt></ruby> Fuji-Nee!</p><p>Requesting heavy support, ASAP!</p><p>The table won&#39;t hold her much longer!</p><hr><p>\u201CWhat&#39;s this, could you possibly be, Mr. Aloha Shirt?\u201D</p><p>\u201CAh, it seems you finally noticed.\u201D</p><p>\u201CWah, You&#39;re completely different! I could barely recognize you.\u201D</p><p>\u201CAn acquaintance of yours?\u201D</p><p>\u201CYes. I&#39;ll introduce you.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CWe often meet at the wharf, and he shares the fish that he catches with me.</p><p>He&#39;s an amazing fishing expert, Mr. Aloha!\u201D</p><p>\u201CAh.\u201D</p><p>\u201CHahahaha, you speak too highly of me.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CIt seems like you don&#39;t have any fish today. Ah, where&#39;s your shirt?\u201D</p><p>\u201CThat&#39;s because I&#39;m in the middle of my shift. By the way, the shirt has nothing to do with fishing itself.\u201D</p><hr><p>Like that, Lancer and Fuji-Nee start talking about the different kinds of black porgy caught at the harbor, enthusiastically discussing different methods to gut and drain the blood. In an instant, the complexions of nearby customers turn pale.</p><hr><p>Eventually, the young waitress we met earlier poked Lancer in the back, and lead him back to the restaurant&#39;s interior.</p><p>And so, I wait a few minutes.</p><p>Smiling brightly, Lancer made his way back to our table.</p><hr><p>\u201CAlright, I think I&#39;ve got the gist of things now.\u201D</p><p>\u201C...Really?\u201D</p><p>\u201CYou probably saw me get in a bit of trouble back there as well.\u201D</p><p>\u201CJust a little.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CWell, now it&#39;s like this...\u201D</p><p>Bending over again, he brings his face close to Caster&#39;s.</p><p>\u201CIf you be quiet and watch carefully, you&#39;ll figure it out.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201COnly that much is not acceptable.\u201D</p><p>She hits the tip of Lancer&#39;s nose with the menu.</p><p>\u201CHeh, you saw through me, huh?\u201D</p><p>\u201CIndeed. I know your type especially well.\u201D</p><p>\u201COoh? Actually, I have a good nose for sniffing out the intentions of others.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CBut to be honest, I have no flippin&#39; clue what that strange lady is thinking!\u201D</p><p>He forcefully asserts this.</p><hr><p>\u201CHowever, Kuzuki&#39;s another matter, and I think I get the gist of it.\u201D</p><p>\u201CYou didn&#39;t get a single word out of him though?\u201D</p><p>\u201CEven so.\u201D</p><p>\u201C...Tell me what you found out.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CHm. Let&#39;s see...</p><p>Weeell, he&#39;s the type who&#39;s happy being used by women.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CHe&#39;s acting too helpful; listening to selfish requests and opening his wallet too easily.</p><p>Unhappiness feels good, like he&#39;s some kind of masochist.\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015Wha-\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CAfter all, before being a man and woman, there&#39;s the relationship between Master and Servant. You shouldn&#39;t just do things on a whim. Right?\u201D</p><p>\u201CSo, you&#39;ve been watching me?\u201D</p><p>\u201CHaahaahaa...\u201D</p><hr><p>Caster bites her lips and turns away.</p><p>\u201CSelfishly saying whatever you want...\u201D</p><p>\u201COh? Mad?\u201D</p><p>\u201CI am simply ashamed of myself, for listening to your thoughtless words seriously.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CHarsh.</p><p>Have you caught wind of the rumor then, that the married couple at Ryuudou Temple are just <em>playing pretend?</em>\u201D</p><p>\u201CPlay......ing...\u201D</p><hr><p>For a moment, she was about to lash out in anger.</p><p>However, she faltered, turning her face away again.</p><p>Probably \u201CIt&#39;s not pretending!\u201D, was what she wanted to say.</p><p>However, she was not able to.</p><p>Seeing this, Lancer kept going.</p><hr><p>\u201CGive it up.</p><p>No matter how much you say it, people are going to get suspicious after a while. It&#39;s best to do it properly.\u201D</p><p>\u201C............\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CLancer, are you trying to throw the Kuzuki household into disorder?\u201D</p><p>\u201CAh? Oi oi. Don&#39;t you make that face too, lad.\u201D</p><p>Lancer scratches his head, disheveling his hair.</p><hr><p>\u201CMy bad. I didn&#39;t mean to play dirty.</p><p>In short, my point is to take it easy. When you&#39;re married you don&#39;t need to be so stiff. You&#39;ll just be tired all the time.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CIt&#39;s finally time to relax and have fun.</p><p>If you make the same mistakes again, are you going to be able to keep standing back up?\u201D</p><p>\u201CLancer!\u201D</p><p>\u201CWell, listen. Even I&#39;ve been a married man. The father of one child.</p><p>People will have many different ways of thinking. If you find yourself at a loss, it&#39;s not like you can&#39;t keep learning.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CJust for example. Let&#39;s say he&#39;s having an affair.</p><p>After all, anyone would see that as a mistake. Would you break down, dispelling your anger in a fit of rage?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CIf you did that now\u2015\u2015\u2015it would certainly be unforgivable.</p><p>If that happens, you probably won&#39;t know what to do.</p><p>However, with only one mistake, is it really alright to let go of everything? That&#39;s one fragile relationship.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C...A strong couple then, is one who can compromise on anything?\u201D</p><p>\u201CExactly. The Japanese Rowan branches are very flexible, which makes them strong. Neither storms nor snow can break them.</p><p>Let&#39;s say you have a lake and build a little dam. If you only let a little water through, the lake below will dry up and the pressure will soon burst the dam no matter what you do.\u201D</p><hr><p>It seems Lancer is encouraging her in his own way.</p><p>That said, a drawback of having three people talking while ducking low and clinging to a table is that it&#39;s impossible to create a serious atmosphere.</p><hr><p>\u201CThe other partner should also have a safety valve. So, even if I were to have an affair, it shouldn&#39;t matter\u2015\u2015\u2015That seems to be the conclusion in your evasive words.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CHowever, even for you, there&#39;s a sacred oath, right? By no means can you yield. Though I think that might only exist in the world of men.\u201D</p><p>\u201CA sacred oath, eh...? There was something like that, the unbreakable kind and all. What was it called again? It&#39;s definitely not something to <em>think too hard about</em>.</p><p>That kinda thing should simply be kept. You should look back on the right or wrong only on your deathbed.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><p>The binding of oneself is not something that can be handed over to another.</p><p>Lancer&#39;s saying it&#39;s not something to be analyzed when received, but something to be protected in silence.</p><p>...This is where the greatest difference lies between the user of the spear and the user of the bow.</p><p>Though both are obliging people, this person here will follow that advice at every error, attempting to continually adapt himself.</p><p>This person will tolerate even the errors, and in turn do his best to help, following in silence.</p><hr><p>\u201C......Hmph. For how many human lifetimes do you think I&#39;ve been alone?</p><p>One who lives like a vagabond without an established Master like you has probably never felt truly alive, right?\u201D</p><p>\u201CWell, maybe. Life is a cycle after all.</p><p>That aside\u2015\u2015\u2015Those two over there seem ready to start the main event.\u201D</p><hr><p>Certainly, taking a look I can see Fuji-Nee&#39;s clumsy elbow position and fingers locked together.</p><p>As one would expect from a sentry and scout prodigy. No matter what the situation his eyes are always alert.</p><hr><p>\u201CBy the way, um, about today.</p><p>Everything went pretty well today, didn&#39;t it?</p><p>There&#39;s actually, something I want discuss with you, Kuzuki-sensei.\u201D</p><p>\u201C............\u201D</p><p>\u201CUm, me being a single woman... what do you think about that?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015!\u201D</p><p>Fuu, Fuji-Neeeee\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015EEE!</p><hr><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015!!!\u201D</p><p>With a dull sound, Caster grips Lancer&#39;s ear fiercely.</p><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015! \u2015\u2015\u2015!!\u201D*</p><p>Lancer looks like he&#39;s screaming, but no sound is coming out. His piercing is going to be ripped out. It&#39;s a relief I&#39;m not sitting beside her.</p><hr><p>\u201CChahaah, I said it.</p><p>M-My apologies.</p><p>There must&#39;ve been a better way for me to say it, but you know me.\u201D</p><p>\u201C............\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CTruly, I&#39;m sorry.</p><p>It was a bit sudden, I know. But, I think it&#39;s best to put your honest feelings out there.\u201D</p><p>\u201C...My feelings, right?\u201D</p><p>\u201CYeah, it&#39;s no good if it&#39;s not from you.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015! \u2015\u2015! \u2015\u2015!\u201D*</p><p>\u300AI-I-Give! I said I give!</p><p>Hey, Caster!\u300B</p><p>Uwaaah, it&#39;s being torn right off.</p><p>Caster&#39;s eyes are wide open, but somehow my worried face and Lancer&#39;s image contorted in agony aren&#39;t in her field of vision at all.</p><p>He&#39;s trembling and flailing his arms all over.</p><hr><p>\u201C.............</p><p>I&#39;m not seeing the full story. Could you please walk me through from the beginning?\u201D</p><p>\u201CAh, aah, that&#39;s true. I&#39;ll tell you.</p><p>Geez, I keep doing that...\u201D</p><hr><p>Fuji-Nee slapped her cheeks and downed her tea in one gulp.</p><p>That&#39;s right. I&#39;m begging you Fuji-Nee, calm down.</p><p>The existence of Lancer&#39;s ear is in a precarious state.</p><hr><p>\u201CThe truth is, the other day, I had a consultation with a student.</p><p>It was a girl. Love troubles, you could say.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CI&#39;ve had these kind of discussions in the past before.</p><p>It&#39;s definitely not the first time. Though it doesn&#39;t happen regularly either.</p><p>Well definitely, they relied on me because of my position as a teacher I think.</p><p>Giving it my best in my own way, I listen patiently and then offer to think things through with them together.\u201D</p><hr><p>From what we could hear, considering the worst that could have happened, I was a little bit relieved from what I was hearing.</p><p>In response, Lancer&#39;s ear was also released and he was soon squatting on the floor and holding the side of his head.</p><p>The spearman suffered an atrocity. It&#39;s a relief that it was only an ear, he savors this happiness.</p><hr><p>\u201CBut, y&#39;know...</p><p>the other times they were really thankful, so I guess I kinda got ahead of myself?\u201D</p><p>\u201CMeaning you weren&#39;t successful.\u201D</p><p>\u201CYeeeah.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CIt&#39;s not as though they went so far as to hate me, but even when we talk now, they no longer confide in me like before.</p><p>Like they had lost faith in me.\u201D</p><p>\u201CI won&#39;t say a word of this to anyone.\u201D</p><p>\u201CThank you.\u201D</p><p>Fuji-Nee is starting to tear up a little.</p><p>...Something like that happened? I never knew.</p><hr><p>\u201CAnd ever since then, I&#39;ve been wondering about what she told me. I thought this time, I&#39;d be the one to ask someone else for help\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><p>Well, it&#39;s pretty shameful of me though.\u201D</p><p>\u201CWhat were you told?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CWell, that child said to me,</p><p>&quot;You don&#39;t have a boyfriend, and you&#39;re not divorced. Everything you say is meaningless.&quot;\u201D</p><p>\u201C...Meaning, you can&#39;t give good advice with poor life experience.\u201D</p><p>\u201CRight.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CHmmm, hmm.</p><p>So then, like an adult playing with fire, she especially singled out Kuzuki.</p><p>She seems to be enjoying her steamy immoral adult life to the fullest. Way to go, Nee-chan.\u201D</p><p>The blade of a knife is suddenly held just under the nose on Lancer&#39;s self-satisfied face.</p><hr><p>\u201CHow&#39;d you like these two nostrils to become one?\u201D</p><p>\u201CHee\uFF5E heheheeiheaa\uFF5E\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CI agree that I&#39;m really inexperienced, but...</p><p>Even so, she also said something else that hit home...\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C&quot;Since Sensei likes and is liked by everyone, you wouldn&#39;t understand,&quot; &quot;No one&#39;s ever told you &#39;I don&#39;t think anything about you,&#39; right? You can&#39;t even imagine people avoiding you, right?&quot;...\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CI know what it&#39;s like to like somebody, whether it&#39;s about a boy or a girl. But what she wanted to say wasn&#39;t that, but\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CIf not like, then hate, or nothing at all.</p><p>Looking for a clear decision, without any middle ground.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CWell, if you want to be blunt about it, that&#39;s right. Ahaha.</p><p>I&#39;ve never heard such a story in the world around me.</p><p>Here in Fuyuki city, no, maybe even in all of Western Japan, I might be the most unlikely person to get married.\u201D</p><p>N-No, something... like that... is...</p><hr><p>\u201CThat doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;ll be helpful.\u201D</p><p>\u201CThat&#39;s it.</p><p>There are plenty of other teachers with experience dealing with romance, but for them it&#39;s, forgive me, something in the past. For me to ask them for help when it&#39;s like that makes me a bit... you know, uneasy.\u201D</p><hr><p>I must have wanted to think this was a worry that would have solved itself in time.</p><p>That Fuji-Nee is holding the same feelings as the students who asked her.</p><p>Even though I think it&#39;s good to have more self-confidence...</p><hr><p>\u201CKuzuki-sensei has just been married.</p><p>In other words, I should mean pretty much <em>nothing</em> to you.\u201D</p><p>Caster agrees strongly.</p><p>Even Lancer is nodding together with her.</p><p>Thankfully, he still has two nostrils.</p><hr><p>\u201CSo that&#39;s why, today\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><p>Not as a teacher, but as a woman, I want to hear you say you have <em>no interest</em> in me.\u201D</p><p>\u201C............\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CNo, I&#39;m already aware that this is a completely unreasonable request.</p><p>But, Kuzuki-sensei was the only one that would seriously think about this.</p><p>You know, even if you &quot;think nothing&quot; about someone, you&#39;d normally think something about them right?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CLike &quot;she&#39;s rude,&quot; or &quot;she has no fashion sense,&quot; or &quot;she eats too much,&quot; or &quot;she eats and then just falls asleep,&quot; or &quot;she&#39;s a tiger.&quot;\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CSo, haah, sorry.</p><p>I&#39;m just rambling endlessly on my own, geez. Let&#39;s drink some tea?\u201D</p><p>\u201CYes.\u201D</p><p>That&#39;s just Kuzuki-sensei being his quiet self\u2015\u2015\u2015but more importantly...</p><p>This... is going to be difficult.</p><hr><p>Fuji-Nee called over a waitress and ordered another one of the strange teas.</p><p>When I turned my line of sight back in front of me, Caster, now free from her suspicions, wore an expression as clear as the Autumn weather.</p><p>Lancer, on the other hand, continued to look intently at Fuji-Nee, as though trying to work through a difficult problem.</p><hr><p>\u201CAaah, Souichirou-sama.</p><p>You could have just said you were going to assist a <em>colleague</em> with her troubles, I can keep a secret. Still, that&#39;s so kind, to be looking out for a <em>coworker</em>.\u201D</p><p>\u201CHmm, I wonder if that&#39;s really the case.\u201D</p><p>\u201C...What?</p><p>We have no need for a laundry pole salesman.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CBamboo\uFF5E Bamboo\uFF5E\u266A</p><p>As if! My lance is not something you dry your underwear on!\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CBut we can&#39;t be sure it&#39;s just about hearing her troubles.\u201D</p><p>\u201CYou mean, there&#39;s something else?\u201D</p><p>\u201CDunno. Really not a clue.</p><p>I&#39;ll be blunt. How could things go wrong...?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C......Hmm.</p><p>You just like riling people up, don&#39;t you? Didn&#39;t you want to say you figured out something in hindsight?\u201D</p><p>\u201CHahahaa. Fufufuu.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CHaha...\u201D</p><p>Anyway.</p><p>There&#39;s no man who could answer Fuji-Nee&#39;s question easily.</p><hr><p>For starters, even if there&#39;s nothing behind it, you&#39;d at least hold back a bit.</p><p>To begin with, why can&#39;t a simple neighbor turn into a romantic interest?\u2015\u2015\u2015That&#39;s just not how people usually think.</p><p>To begin with, people aren&#39;t conscious about it.</p><p>Fuji-Nee is asking the impossible out of whoever she asks. Seriously.</p><hr><p>So, assuming that you can answer\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><p>if you are ready to experience life in its own way,</p><p>if you have the peace to look back at your past,</p><p>if you have the sincerity, or perhaps the cruelty to point out the other&#39;s flaws... would that be the right person?</p><p>For all I know, the man in question...</p><hr><p>Lancer...</p><p>Absolutely not.</p><hr><p>I wonder if... that&#39;s Kuzuki-sensei after all.</p><p>Well, but,</p><p>what they&#39;re talking about now, like &quot;they might hate me&quot; or &quot;it&#39;s troubling for them&quot; are normal anxieties for people.</p><p>As long as they&#39;re not extremely self-centered\u2015\u2015\u2015or extremely naive like a certain somebody.</p><p>Maybe it would end up as shock therapy for that certain someone?</p><hr><p>Taking a sip of his fresh tea, Kuzuki-sensei sternly spoke up.</p><hr><p>\u201CWhether or not I am capable of solving your problem I do not know, but I believe I am capable of answering enough to respond to your request.\u201D</p><p>\u201CP-Please.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CAs you have said, I have no interest in you.\u201D</p><p>\u201CY-Yeah...\u201D</p><p>Caster makes a small triumphant pose.</p><hr><p>\u201CAs a man, I also have no feelings of desire towards Fujimura Taiga. Of course, that is also as a target of romantic interest.\u201D</p><p>\u201CY-Y-Yeah...\u201D</p><hr><p>Fuji-Nee, having a hard time as expected.</p><p>Beside the triumphantly beaming Caster, Lancer was shaking his head and grinding his teeth.</p><hr><p>\u201CI would not mind if I were to accompany you out, but only as coworkers.\u201D</p><p>\u201CR-Right...\u201D</p><p>Fuji-Nee visibly shrinks.</p><p>Please, please have mercy already.</p><p>It hurts. Just listening hurts more than I expected.</p><hr><p>\u201CThat is how I thought.\u201D</p><p>\u201C...&quot;Thought&quot;?</p><p>You &quot;thought&quot;?\u201D</p><hr><p>Lancer rises abruptly as he hears this.</p><p>There is a fiery glint in his eyes.</p><p>As I thought, he likes this kind of stuff after all.</p><hr><p>\u201CI am not interested in things such as human beings in general.</p><p>The joy and suffering in life. What do others think of themselves? Is there love here or has it turned to hatred?</p><p>How things weigh on a person&#39;s mind, whether or not one is dead or not, things such as that.\u201D</p><p>\u201CEh, eeeh\u2015\u2015\u2015!?\u201D</p><hr><p>Fuji-Nee&#39;s voice could be heard over the entire store as she leans heavily onto the table.</p><p>\u201CB-But, don&#39;t you have a wife?\u201D</p><p>\u201CYes, I am married, but it was not a marriage of love.\u201D</p><p>\u201CEh...? Th-Then, a marriage interview?</p><p>Or maybe your family forced this marriage on you?\u201D</p><p>\u201CIf I were to say, it was like an arranged marriage.</p><p>However, rather than being forced upon from one side, it was more accidental.\u201D</p><hr><p>I fearfully watched Caster.</p><p>Caster&#39;s head was tilted downwards to the point where her facial expression, concealed behind her bangs, could not be seen. Lucky.</p><p>Even Lancer backed away a little, as if flinching.</p><hr><p>\u201CWh... wh-wh-wh... wh-wh-wh...whhh... wha...\u201D</p><p>With massive effort, Fuji-Nee takes a deep breath and somehow manages to calm herself, becoming as serene as the time she listened to a recital of Kenji Miyazawa&#39;s poetry.</p><p>She inquired again, with a still tremulous voice.</p><hr><p>\u201CW-What do you mean?\u201D</p><p>\u201CEven being indifferent to other people, I am able to live.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CIn my class, I teach that a human is a creature that cannot live alone, nowadays you can say that it&#39;s referred to as mutual security.</p><p>Though in practice, if you think you can do everything individually, you don&#39;t need others.</p><p>Tools, or objects even. Partners too; you need to think of other people as such at all times.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CFor example, with an efficient craving for possession, an animal consciously hunts alone, claims its own territory, mates with a partner to leave offspring, and drives others from its territory. In some cases, killing.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CAah. They say that female spiders eat the male after mating.\u201D</p><p>\u201CIt would be typical to use the opposite sex for survival, don&#39;t you agree?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CHowever, can it be said that the relationships which use love are efficient?</p><p>If you lose the favor of a partner you perform work together with, wouldn&#39;t you not be able to make a living?\u201D</p><p>\u201CI-I suppose so.</p><p>The need to consider the <em>self-interests</em> of your partner... is not necessary. You can survive.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CYes. It should be sufficient. If you just live alone.\u201D</p><p>\u201CYeah...\u201D</p><hr><p>Looking back, I was astounded.</p><p>Lancer was moving his fingers towards the brooding Caster&#39;s bangs, all while smiling teasingly.</p><p>No, no way.</p><p>There&#39;s a bit of morbid fascination, even.</p><p>Is he planning on unleashing hell here?</p><hr><p>I lean forward to try and prevent any reckless actions. I reach forward, but it was too late.</p><p>And in the next moment...</p><p>A fingertip slips into place and raises her bangs.</p><p>And what appeared\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><p>didn&#39;t look upset at all.</p><hr><p>What appeared\u2015\u2015\u2015was a firm set of blue eyes.</p><p>It was a gentle smile full of confidence.</p><hr><p>\u201CTh\u2015\u2015\u2015That&#39;s no good!\u201D</p><p>Fuji-Nee stood up abruptly, shaking her chair.</p><p>\u201C......\u201D</p><p>\u201CYou have to cherish your wife!\u201D</p><p>Her face was turning red, and she was flailing her arms.</p><p>The tiger had appeared.</p><hr><p>\u201CI&#39;ve never met her before\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><p>But I&#39;ve seen the lunchbox you were eating in the staff room!\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CIt wasn&#39;t extremely well made like our Shirou does it but, um well, if I had to say, well, it didn&#39;t look very good, or there was a real issue with its quality\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><p>But, it was something she poured her heart into!</p><p>I can tell, because I can&#39;t cook either!\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CAh, wait, I&#39;m not trying to say that she&#39;s not being helpful to you!\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CBesides, I heard from Shirou!</p><p>About how she&#39;s a foreigner, but she&#39;s still trying her best to get used to Japan. About how elegant and graceful you two are together\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><p>\u201CSensei. Please put your cup down.</p><p>If it spills, you might burn yourself.\u201D</p><p>\u201COh, sure, sorry about th-\u201D</p><hr><p>Fuji-Nee tilts her head blankly.</p><p>\u201CEh... What the?</p><p>Umm, is this turning into one of those lovey dovey conversations where it&#39;s like I&#39;m asking you to move on...?\u201D</p><p>\u201CNo.\u201D</p><p>\u201CI&#39;m sorry!\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CI-Is that so? You&#39;re right.</p><p>Again, I&#39;m such a thoughtless person.</p><p>But... Phew, I&#39;m glad.\u201D</p><p>\u201CMe too.</p><p>I do not know how to respond to such a varying conversation.\u201D</p><hr><p>Kuzuki-sensei stretched his back, and took his hands from his lap and clasped them on the table.</p><p>Shining faintly on his ring finger, was a silver ring.</p><hr><p>\u201CHonestly, I don&#39;t have any words to answer your question directly.\u201D</p><p>\u201CThen, what you said a moment ago...?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CThat was simply what I believed in the past.\u201D</p><p>\u201CI-I see.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CAs your students have pointed out, you may be experiencing the anxiety of being single.</p><p>While recognizing what you lack yourself, you continue as a teacher\u2015\u2015\u2015wondering whether or not you can come to terms with yourself. That anxiety.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CIf that is the case, I as well have anxiety.</p><p>What should I do as a man with a wife?</p><p>What are the surrounding expectations?</p><p>How should I treat other women?</p><p>These matters are not clear to me.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CThe reason why such thoughts came to exist is for no other reason than meeting my wife.</p><p>We have no past with each other.</p><p>From the beginning, we simply were in the form of spouses.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CThere is a saying, &quot;In form only.&quot; This is it exactly.</p><p>I was hollow. There was nothing to support my brittle existence. Thinking back now, I was saved by that form.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CBut now, can you say you love your wife?\u201D</p><p>\u201C............\u201D</p><p>\u201CW-Was that something I shouldn&#39;t have asked?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C...I&#39;m sorry.</p><p>I do not understand my own feelings. Or rather, it is that I do not have faith in them.</p><p>They are... something I should not have. For this reason, it is not possible for me to speak clearly of my own opinions.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CHuh? So it&#39;s no good to have faith in yourself?\u201D</p><p>\u201CNo, don&#39;t worry, my own self is one of the few things I have faith in.</p><p>...Well, I cannot definitively express this in words with the current state of things, but\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><p>&quot;Ahem,&quot; Kuzuki-sensei coughs softly.</p><hr><p>\u201C...Feelings, are a foolish and idle thing.</p><p>Right now, you may feel strongly about something, but to have those feelings wither by the next day would not be unusual.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CFor that reason, within this constant repetition of days, even if little by little, perhaps I am starting to recognize sentiments of my own.</p><p>However, instead of relying on the heat of the moment\u2015\u2015\u2015if I do not nurture them closely, they may not come to fruition.</p><p>Perhaps someday, even my hollowness will change. Yes, that is what I believed.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CIt might even be called, a weakness.</p><p>If there is nothing to protect, nothing to be lost, there is nothing to lose.</p><p>However, while you may be just as much alive\u2015\u2015\u2015it&#39;s also the same as being dead.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CEven if I do not say it, my wife and I are a couple.</p><p>I am not a capable person, so maintaining the form of a couple requires all my effort.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CI am not talkative, so I most likely look like a calm person, but I still feel that same anxiousness in front of my students.</p><p>However, to understand one&#39;s own imperfection and to continue to work one&#39;s hardest, is an admirable thing, is it not\u2015\u2015\u2015?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CYup. So it&#39;s a &quot;fight&quot; until the day I become a splendid teacher?\u201D</p><p>\u201C...And so the talk turns to martial arts...</p><p>Perhaps in this short life, the path to teaching others will be an endless road.</p><p>I think that it is a reliable attitude to continue devoting oneself tirelessly to study without losing one&#39;s head in pride.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CThat is all of the story that I am able to tell you, Fujimura-sensei.</p><p>It is an unpleasant tale, but if this helps you overcome your weakness as a teacher, I am satisfied.\u201D</p><hr><p>As he says this, Kuzuki-sensei lightly bows to Fuji-Nee.</p><p>Fuji-Nee&#39;s eyes begin to fill with tears.</p><hr><p>\u201CH-How refined! I want to get married! Aaaah, um, er...\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CThank you very much.</p><p>I received an amazing energy boost!</p><p>Same here, as long as I can be of any help!\u201D</p><p>Fuji-Nee suddenly bowed deeply, banging her head and arms on the table.</p><hr><p>\u201CAs expected, that sure is an interesting woman.\u201D</p><p>Lancer laughs freely.</p><p>\u201CEven though she&#39;s a long way off from Souichirou-sama, she sure did cause a fuss.\u201D</p><p>This one was laughing as well, but she was most likely seething with rage inside.</p><hr><p>\u201CHah hah hah. Well, he&#39;s an honest man after all, I knew from the start.\u201D</p><p>\u201C...Lancer. His &quot;Luck&quot; ranking was just now updated from E to F.\u201D</p><p>\u201CWhat a fool. Hah hah hah.\u201D</p><p>\u201CYou&#39;re paying for the tea. Since you were such a bother (whisper)\u201D</p><p>\u201CHa ha hah... what?\u201D</p><hr><p>So as not to be noticed, we would slip out from the front entrance.</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015but as that was impossible, while stealthily creeping across the floor, we head towards the toilet, and tumble out from a narrow window, somehow or other succeeding in our plan.</p><hr><p>\u201CI caused some trouble, for you as well.\u201D</p><p>I smile bitterly while dusting off my pants.</p><p>\u201CHonestly.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CHowever, I was happy to see another side of Fuji-Nee.\u201D</p><p>\u201CThat person? She&#39;s such a bother.\u201D</p><p>Caster shrugs, but somehow looks content.</p><hr><p>\u201CBe sure to serve her the largest dinner possible to fatten her up.\u201D</p><p>\u201CI will. And you too, don&#39;t be so mean to Issei... Issei...?\u201D</p><p>\u201CI can&#39;t guarantee anything. I am a witch after all.</p><p>...What&#39;s wrong? Your eyes are bulging.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201COh crap......</p><p>I completely forgot about Issei......\u201D</p><p>\u201CYou had an appointment? It can&#39;t be helped. I&#39;ll help smooth things over for you.\u201D</p><p>\u201CAck... S-Sorry...\u201D</p><p>T-The shame. All the debt she owes has instantly gone back to zero.</p><hr><p>After I saw Caster off, I recall the image of Lancer as a waiter.</p><p>I get the impression that he&#39;s going to have some trouble at his part-time job early on, but I feel that somehow, this one could last a while.</p><hr><h3 id="emiya-residence\u30FBstart-of-night-things-to-do" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#emiya-residence\u30FBstart-of-night-things-to-do" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Emiya Residence\u30FBStart of Night Things to do</h3>', 1092);
