Her magic energy absorption efficiency increases when drawn from summer-related environments, such as water from a lake summer spot or dazzling sunlight. This method may seem unbecoming of a blood-feeder, but Yu herself doesn\u2019t seem bothered by it.<br> Her preferences have not changed at all, so you might see her out sunbathing all the while complaining about the heat.</p><p><strong>The Conqueror\u2019s Consort: EX</strong></p><p>This is a skill she reacquired after having reunited with Xiang Yu at Chaldea. It defines her position as the Hegemon-King of Western Chu\u2019s wife/lover, as well as signifies the strong bond they share.<br> Changing into a swimsuit has garnered more unwelcomed attention from others, to which Yu responds with an even stronger assertion: \u201CI am this man\u2019s wife!\u201D In a sense, this may perhaps be a manifestation of her faithfulness.</p><p><strong>Dance From the Bygone Days: EX</strong></p><p>This skill represents the sword dance she once performed before Xiang Yu. While she is firm with her distaste for human culture and sees no point in imitating them, she would occasionally bend that mindset for her beloved.<br> She can\u2019t tell if she\u2019s objectively decent at it. She doesn\u2019t give a damn about how others evaluate her for it. What she does know is that dancing was, at times, necessary. Xiang Yu\u2019s evaluation of her dance and the look on his face as he watched her were between the two of them. That moment, along with this skill, was deeply engraved into her Spirit Origin as a precious memory.<br> This skill was designed to be sealed and unusable without Xiang Yu nearby. But this time around, the impact of his spear being loaned to her has broken the seal and made it usable through the spear functioning as Xiang Yu\u2019s substitute of some sort.<br> It has now been arranged to be a spear dance.</p><h2 id="noble-phantasm" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#noble-phantasm" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Noble Phantasm</h2><h1 id="anti-fling-rondo-the-spear-dance-to-end-summer-monsters" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#anti-fling-rondo-the-spear-dance-to-end-summer-monsters" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Anti-Fling Rondo (The Spear Dance to End Summer Monsters)</h1><ul><li>Rank: A</li><li>Classification: Anti-Army NP</li><li>Range: 1-10</li><li>Maximum Number of Targets: 20</li></ul><p>Anti-Fling Rondo. Fling is slang for \u201Caffair\u201D or \u201Cone-summer love,\u201D and by extension points to the summer monsters mentioned in the event. The spear Xiang Yu loaned to her, (or as she believes to be) the embodiment of his love, serves as an anti-summer monster measure. It packs an anti-male attack bonus stemming from her over-the-top prejudiced view.<br> Although Yu had no experience in martial arts or tactics, her love for Xiang Yu turning up a notch was what evoked the memories of the sword dance she once performed before him. This then gave her the idea of rearranging the choreography into a spear dance. For some reason, this Noble Phantasm turned out to resemble pole dancing.<br> It works in the same way as her original Noble Phantasm \u201CEternal Lament\u201D in that she lets her magical energy run amok to generate abnormal weather as she destroys her physical form. What makes it different, however, is the use of Xiang Yu\u2019s spear as the axis of her movements: Gaining a spinning trajectory generates a tornado-shaped curse instead of a rain of blood.<br> Her eternal lament has transformed into a rondo of death.</p><h2 id="character" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#character" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Character</h2><h3 id="pronouns" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#pronouns" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Pronouns</h3><ul><li>First-person pronoun: watashi</li><li>Second-person pronoun: omae/kisama/anata (when referring to certain characters such as Xiang Yu)</li><li>Third-person pronoun: aitsu/yatsu/Master</li></ul><h3 id="personality" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#personality" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Personality</h3><p>She\u2019s not much different than usual, except that she is feeling slightly giddier after Xiang Yu loaned her his spear.

Death to flirts.<br> [Her Noble Phantasm] activates on those (she accuses of) making eye at her even if they never did hit on her.<br> Simply put, expect the possibility of a spear flying your way just by catching a glimpse of her swimsuit form. \u201CWell, what can I say?

Unfortunately, Xiang Yu\u2019s calculations led him to the conclusion that, even if he must deceive her, it would be best she Rayshift without him. Shaken, her pillar of support in all this was the spear Xiang Yu loaned to her beforehand as well as the love it emanated.<br> After all, he did warn her about the dangers of summer monsters.<br> Yu found herself wondering what the so-called \u201Csummer monsters\u201D are, later on finding out that the term is sometimes used to refer to the tendency of getting carried away and being prone to making mistakes such as hookups during the summer. \u201CIn other words, Lord Xiang Yu was worried I\u2019d get hit on, so he gave this to me as protection!?\u201D The love she felt has her at a fever pitch.</p><p>(The truth remains unknown\u2026 Xiang Yu\u2019s calculations did initially inform him of the \u201Cpresence of threat/s\u201D and the \u201Cpossibility of said threat/s being monsters,\u201D but he may have phrased it as such simply because it was summertime, not necessarily aware of the definition of the slang.)</p><p>While she was utterly dejected that Xiang Yu was not around, she did not dwell on it completely. Using his love as her driving force, she was set on clearing this Singularity ASAP so that the two of them can finally go on a leisurely vacation together\u2026 Thus Yu commandingly led her unreliable Kouhai by the hand.</p><p>She ended up dying multiple times.<br> Again and again and again as if on a spree.<br> She even split herself in two like a planaria.<br> From the very start of this event, in fact.</p><p>\u2014\u2014That summer may have been Consort Yu\u2019s summer.</p><h3 id="equipment" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#equipment" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Equipment</h3><p>Xiang Yu\u2019s spear</p><h3 id="related-characters" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#related-characters" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Related Characters</h3><p><strong>Xiang Yu</strong></p><p>Of course, I love my Lord Xiang Yu.<br> If I may, what do you think\u2026of this swimsuit\u2026?</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling</strong></p><p>Is that your summer attire?
