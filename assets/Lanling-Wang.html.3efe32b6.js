It&#39;s something I had to devise on my own.</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong><br> As a general, I was so busy studying politics and warfare that I only had time to learn the bare minimum of martial arts.</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong><br> All the techniques I use now were moves I developed on the battlefield. I turned out to be much more adept at dodging than defense, so that&#39;s what I tended to focus on.</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:</strong><br> I see. So your sword dancing was forged in the heat of battle.</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong><br> Your swordplay, on the other hand, was breathtakingly refined, Lord Yagyu. I learned a great deal from this sparring session.</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:</strong><br> My Otomeryu is not ordinarily meant to be seen by outside eyes...</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:</strong><br> But that was a concern for my living self. Now that I am a Servant\u2013a shadow sworn to serve a new Master\u2013it is no longer relevant.</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong><br> I see. Now that humanity itself is in crisis,<br> we can&#39;t be choosy about how we fight back.</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:</strong><br> Be that as it may, I am afraid I cannot allow myself to copy your style.</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:</strong><br> My son, Mitsuyoshi, would have no compunctions about claiming any technique he liked as his own, but no matter.</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong><br> Does that mean your son has a different style than you, Lord Yagyu?</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:</strong><br> Oh yes, very different. His talent with the blade came to him naturally, and his technique can only be described as flawless.</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:</strong><br> Nonetheless, the world is a big place. There is surely someone somewhere strong enough to rend steel with their bare hands.</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong><br> Ah yes, like the ones descended from living, breathing gods.</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong><br> Good point. Then I suppose we will just have to train hard enough to keep up with them.</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:</strong><br> Indeed.</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong><br> Oh, it looks like the next group is here.<br> I&#39;d best be on my way then.</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:</strong><br> Very well. Until the next time.</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:</strong><br> Hmm. It seems he noticed my warrior&#39;s instincts getting the best of me. What a pity.</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:</strong><br> Now then, you there.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>Urk.</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:</strong><br> What have you been doing this whole time?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>After being called out by the nonsubject male,<br> I decided to make a swift and quiet getaway.</p><p><strong>--ARROW--:</strong></p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> 12:00 p.m.<br> Lunchtime.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> However, the subject heads to the underground library rather than the cafeteria.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Oh, just for the record...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I&#39;d like you all to know that the library&#39;s name was recently changed to:</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> ...\u201CThe Great and Terrible Yet Beautiful Murasaki Shikibu Library\u201D I&#39;ve heard so much about!</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> Oh, hello, Prince of Lan Ling.<br> What sort of book are you looking for today?</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong><br> Good question...</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> Well, we did just get in a few grimoires and valuable antique books thanks to a certain, um, anonymous donor...</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong><br> I see.</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong><br> (Despite getting new books, she seems rather preoccupied...)</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> I&#39;m afraid we have yet to receive the new shipment of military strategy books I&#39;ve been expecting...</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong><br> Oh, I know. What about a book that Master would like?</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong><br> I could bring it with me the next time I visit [\u2642 him /\u2640\uFE0F her].</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> Oh, what a lovely idea.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> Okay then, wait here, please.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> Um, let&#39;s see...<br> I think it was above this shelf...</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong><br> Uh-oh.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> Aah!</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong><br> Forgive me. This was the only way I could think to help in the short time I had to act.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> O-o-oh gosh, I&#39;m so terribly sorry!</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong><br> Not at all. The important thing is that you&#39;re okay.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> O-oh, yes, I&#39;m fine. Besides, it&#39;s all my fault for not being more careful...</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong><br> Accidents happen to the best of us.<br> Please, pay it no mind.</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong><br> So, is this the book you were looking for?</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> Y-yes, that&#39;s it.</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong><br> Then I&#39;ll go ahead and check it out straight away.<br> Thank you for your help.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> My pleasure.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> ...And so our subject makes a graceful exit, apologizing for his intrusion in touching Murasaki Shikibu&#39;s body even as his gentle smile makes it clear he meant no harm.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> (Sigh)...</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> That may well be the most beautiful man I&#39;ve ever met, in multiple senses of the word.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> Even with the mask on, he had my heart pounding. I shudder to think of what may have happened had he not been wearing it.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> ...H-hang on. I think I might be able to use this feeling in a story! I&#39;ll go write it down in my idea notebook right now.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> 4:00 p.m.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> The subject strikes up a conversation with two passersby.</p><p><strong>Paris:</strong><br> I see...<br> So that&#39;s why you wear that mask.</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> Man, it&#39;s a good thing you weren&#39;t born in Greece.</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> Back there, good looks like that would either get you cursed or blessed, and there&#39;d be hell to pay either way.</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong><br> I can understand the downside of being cursed...<br> but wouldn&#39;t a blessing be a good thing?</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> Hardly. Sure, a blessing might mean you&#39;d be living the good life for a while, but one wrong word and bam, the gods go divine retribution on your ass.</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> Hell, maybe they just decide to go retribution on you &#39;cause they think you&#39;re getting too full of yourself.</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> Either way, the only ending you&#39;d get is a bad one!</p><p><strong>Paris:</strong><br> Oh yeah, that sort of thing happened all the time!</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong><br> I see. It sounds like Greece had its fair share of troubles as well...</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> Then again, you wouldn&#39;t be the first to hide your face under a mask. Pency used to do the same thing.</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong><br> Pency?</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> You know, the Berserker who&#39;s always flying off the handle?</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> Real short?<br> Abs that could grate cheese?</p><p><strong>Paris:</strong><br> (Apollo&#39;s getting a bad feeling about this!<br> Abort! Abort!)</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> What was her real name again?<br> Oh, right!</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> Pencil-Lilia!</p><p><strong>Penthesilea:</strong><br> You mangled my name on purpose! DIE!!!</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> Huh\u2013WAAAH!</p><p><strong>Penthesilea:</strong><br> (Huff, huff...)</p><p><strong>Penthesilea:</strong><br> (Glare)</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong><br> For the record, I swear on my honor that I never said anything untoward about you.</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong><br> That said, I should have stopped Lord Jason before he shouted your mangled name. For that, I sincerely apologize.</p><p><strong>Penthesilea:</strong><br> ...Very well. But I should mention that I have no desire for there to be any bad blood between us.</p><p><strong>Penthesilea:</strong><br> Come with me to the simulator.</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong><br> Does that mean you wish to fight?</p><p><strong>Penthesilea:</strong><br> I would have let you go if you were a Caster, but as you are a Saber, you should be capable of defending your honor yourself.</p><p><strong>Penthesilea:</strong><br> Unless, of course, that sword of yours is just for show?</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong><br> ...I suppose you&#39;re right.</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong><br> Besides, I could learn a great deal by facing one of Greece&#39;s fiercest warriors in mortal combat.</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong><br> Very well then, let us do battle.</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Penthesilea:</strong><br> I have seen the truth of your words in the strength of your sword arm. Very well then, our battle is concluded!</p><p><strong>Penthesilea:</strong><br> I accept you as a fellow warrior and now trust your word that you meant no disrespect!</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong><br> Thank you, Lady Penthesilea.</p><p><strong>Penthesilea:</strong><br> By the way, that mask of yours...</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong><br> Yes?</p><p><strong>Penthesilea:</strong><br> I assume you do not get moisture buildup on your face when you are fighting while wearing it? That must be nice.</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong><br> That&#39;s right, I don&#39;t. This mask only covers my eyes, so there&#39;s plenty of room for air to circulate.</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong><br> Of course, it also extends up past my face, so I have to be careful when going through doors and such.</p><p><strong>Penthesilea:</strong><br> Hmm... I see.</p><p><strong>Penthesilea:</strong><br> The climate may have been largely responsible for this, but I always found quite a lot of moisture built up in my mask when I wore it in battle.</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong><br> Was it the kind that covers your entire face?</p><p><strong>Penthesilea:</strong><br> It was. I cannot tell you how terribly I felt the urge simply to scratch my nose on countless occasions.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> And so Penthesilea and our subject continued their pleasant conversation about masks.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>When it was over, they both went merrily on their way, much to my relief.</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> I-I only mangled it on purpose a little bit...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>Jason, of course, remains clueless.</p><p><strong>--ARROW--:</strong></p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> 6:00 p.m.</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>The subject suddenly goes silent.</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong><br> I&#39;ve been looking the other way since you didn&#39;t seem to mean any harm, but now that you&#39;ve been following me around all day, I feel compelled to ask.</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong><br> What is it you want with me, Lord Blackbeard!?</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You wanna run that by me again?</p><hr><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> I just told you! What&#39;s the freaking deal with that pretty boy!?</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> Prince of Lan Ling?<br> More like Prince of OP Super Hotties!</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> I mean, I know Chaldea&#39;s always had more than its fair share of hunks, but he just takes it too far!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou. Fooou...</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> Take Bartholomew. He might act all dandy, but it doesn&#39;t take long to see he&#39;s a gross creepfest on the inside!</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> So you just know that Lan Ling guy&#39;s got to be hiding something too!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> So you&#39;re jealous of him? Is that what this is about?</p><hr><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> Me? Jealous? Of him?<br> Pfft. No way. Not in a million years.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou.</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> I just figure nobody could actually be that perfect,<br> so there must be something we&#39;re not seeing.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I don&#39;t know. He seems pretty perfect to me.</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> Well, I don&#39;t buy it. Guys like that always end up having some kind of weird fetish or something they don&#39;t wanna tell anyone else about, guaranteed.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> So what if there is?</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> Well, if there&#39;s something we&#39;re not seeing, I wanna see it, dammit!</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> Besides, it&#39;s just human nature to want to find fault with anyone who seems too good to be true!</p><hr><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> Which is why I&#39;m not going to rest until I&#39;ve uncovered the truth about him!</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> Wooo, let&#39;s do this thing!<br> Gimme a C! H! A! L! D! E! A! Gooo Chaldea!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> What was that all about...?</p><hr><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> And so, I have returned with my findings!</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> Long story short:</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> He&#39;s handsome on the inside too!!!</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> (Sigh) What a letdown.</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong><br> Th-that&#39;s why you were following me around all day?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I have to admit, you really were a perfect gentleman...</p><hr><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong><br> Now don&#39;t you start too, Master!</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> Right!? Just look at how carefully he placed his hands when he caught Murasaki!</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> See how he did his best to avoid touching her skin even as he made sure to support her head?</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> If I didn&#39;t know better, I&#39;d have sworn I was watching a scene straight out of a visual romance novel (the kind that induces serious blushing).</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> Incidentally, scenes like that are called \u201CCGs\u201D in some games, depending on the genre.</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> The more you know, amirite!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I-it really is like poetry in motion...</p><hr><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong><br> When did you even record that?</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> Oh yes, I&#39;m not too proud to admit that my inner badump circuit was running like crazy while this was going down.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I didn&#39;t even know you had a...whatever that is.</p><hr><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> Oh sure. It&#39;s right between my heart and my stomach.</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> Once it spins up, you get palpitations, flop sweat, fever, flushed skin, dizzy spells, weak knees, and hyperventilation, though not necessarily in that order.</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> You know, now that I think about it, I really should look into getting that circuit removed!</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong><br> Um... Master? Could we please make that...man stop?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Yeah, I guess we should. (That circuit sounds like seriously bad news)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> True, this has definitely gone on long enough.</p><hr><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> Oh yeah? Then let&#39;s take this outside! I know I might not look it, but I&#39;m still an ultra badass pirate!</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong><br> (The fact that it&#39;s true only makes him that much more difficult to deal with...)</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> Hehehe... What a lucky break for me,<br> getting to fight on a ship.</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong><br> Are you sure you didn&#39;t touch the simulation&#39;s settings!?</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> Heh heh heh.</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> If you think that&#39;s all I&#39;ve got in store for you,<br> you&#39;re gravely mistaken.</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong><br> What?</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> Let&#39;s just say that Blackbeard is never alone!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You mean there&#39;s another one of you? Oh gods, please no.</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> Thank you for your honesty, Master.<br> It&#39;s much appreciated.</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> We hope you&#39;ll continue to enjoy Blackbeard brand products for many years to come.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> You mean you&#39;ve still got crew members!?</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> Hehehe. You won&#39;t find the sad sack Blackbeard who used to lie on the ground weeping tears of loneliness here anymore.</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> Er, not that he ever existed to begin with, of course.</p><hr><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> All right, tactician, come forth!</p><p><strong>Chen Gong:</strong><br> Good day, everyone. I am Chen Gong, the tactician Lord Blackbeard just spoke of.</p><p><strong>Chen Gong:</strong><br> I&#39;m a busy man, of course, but as I was told this is a time-sensitive matter, I decided to leave my errant tasks for later and drop by.</p><p><strong>Chen Gong:</strong><br> And by time-sensitive matter, well...<br> I trust you know of what I speak?</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong><br> (Um, Master?)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> (I think I can already see where this is going...)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> (Just be ready to run for it at a moment&#39;s notice!)</p><hr><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> All right, let&#39;s do this thing! By the way, tactician,<br> can I ask why you&#39;re standing directly behind me?</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Chen Gong:</strong><br> I know what you&#39;re thinking, so before you even ask:<br> it was a necessary sacrifice.</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong><br> If you say so...</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> Gaaah! I really thought I was done for!</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> Who knew just activating Guts took so much energy...</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong><br> Easy there. Are you all right, Lord Blackbeard?</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> THIS is the music they&#39;re playing now!?</p><hr><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> Oh man, I finally got that event CG I wanted after all...</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> I can feel my badump circuit whirring around... Pretty soon, I&#39;ll be my own little Blackbeard Restoration Labyrinth...</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong><br> (No earthly idea what he&#39;s talking about)</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong><br> This has been a very tiring day...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I bet!</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong><br> Lord Blackbeard seemed very dejected when he left...</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong><br> I do hope he&#39;ll be okay.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> It was kind of refreshing seeing you perturbed for once, though.</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong><br> You know, you can be kind of mean-spirited sometimes, Master.</p><hr><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong><br> Still, I haven&#39;t had a day like this in a long time.<br> For that, I owe Lord Blackbeard my thanks.</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong><br> Having your day turned upside down by someone you least expected may seem exhausting from the outside...</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong><br> ...but if nothing else,<br> there&#39;s certainly never a dull moment.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Welcome to my life.</p><hr><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong><br> Oh, right! I guess you do experience that all the time, don&#39;t you?</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong><br> In that case, Master, would you like to swap war stories with me tonight?</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong><br> I suspect that both of us have plenty of tales of hardship we could tell.</p>', 271);
