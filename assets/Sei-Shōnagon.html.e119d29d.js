First the historical context behind it. China&#39;s Hangu Pass was a fortified checkpoint that opened its gates for transport early in the morning upon the rooster&#39;s first crow. Lord Mengchang, then a fugitive, once escaped Qin by imitating a rooster to get this gate to open.</li></ol><p>Fast forward twelve centuries and Fujiwara no Yukinari visited Sei Shounagon but quickly left saying he had things to do in the imperial court. They then exchanged messages that went like</p><ul><li><p>Yukinari: &quot;Sorry, the crow of the rooster hurried me.&quot;</p></li><li><p>Sei: &quot;That&#39;s not true, it was an imitation of a rooster, like in the Hangu Pass incident.&quot; (Meaning: I&#39;m not buying your excuse)</p></li><li><p>Yukinari: &quot;The Hangu Pass gateway and Ousaka&#39;s gateway are not the same checkpoint.&quot;</p></li></ul><p>Sei Shounagon then contributed to Ogura&#39;s compilation with the following entry:</p><blockquote><p>The rooster&#39;s crowing<br> In the middle of the night<br> Deceived the hearers;<br> But at Ousaka&#39;s gateway<br> The guards are never fooled.</p></blockquote><p>Unlike the Hangu Pass, her Ousaka checkpoint will never open to liars trying to fake the rooster&#39;s crow before the sun rises. The pun in the exchange is that Ousaka&#39;s kanji roughly means &quot;hill of (romantic) encounters&quot;, so she basically dumped a guy in the middle of the most important poetry event of her time. The skill description also takes the &quot;gates of love&quot; angle, with an open question implying the first to pass the impregnable checkpoint was Teishi.</p><ol start="2"><li>From a short Pillow Book entry.</li></ol><blockquote><p>The best stars are the Pleiades, Altair, and Vesper. Comets also have their charm, but could be improved from not having the long trail behind them.</p></blockquote><ol start="3"><li><p>Okashige, most commonly seen in its adjective form &quot;okashi&quot;, is the concept of beauty as portrayed by Sei Shounagon&#39;s writing. It proposes cheerful, intellectual, and guttural sentimentality, as opposed to the subdued atmosphere of elegant melancholy prevalent in, say, Murasaki Shikibu&#39;s works. Uncoincidently, Type-Moon web designer and assistant writer OKSG names himself after okashige.</p></li><li><p>&quot;Run, Melos!&quot; is a short story by Osamu Dazai where Melos is given the sunset as a time limit to save his friend Selinuntus&#39;s life.
