Probably because of overexertion during the day. There is something wrong with this much heat.&quot;</p><p>I had heard that Japanese summers were hot, but I had not thought it would be this bad.</p><p>The heat shining back from this town is too strong even for me, a child of the desert.</p><hr><p>I thought I would sleep through the heat of the day, but it seems I could not control the time of my awakening.</p><hr><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;...... A cold night. I must have slept too long?&quot;</p><p>Whatever the case, confusion is for certain.</p><p>Not sleeping properly and not ordering all this information is setting myself up for failure.</p><hr><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;......

Then, all that&#39;s left is this?&quot;</p><p>I come out to an unfamiliar clearing.</p><p>A small clearing apart from the office buildings.</p><hr><p>Until a short while ago everything was another large city park but it now transitions into private property.</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Wow. From down here it really looks impressive.&quot;</p><hr><p>I look up at the building under construction.</p><p>I heard the monumental architecture would be finished next spring.</p><p>Nobody seems to be sure exactly what it&#39;s going to be, but it&#39;s something important.</p><p>I&#39;ve heard everything from a big department store to the corporate office of a powerful electronics company.</p><hr><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;The area around it is also being landscaped. Maybe I don&#39;t have to go this far.&quot;</p><p>The land all around the building is perfectly flat like a mirror.</p><p>The name of the building, Shrine, may be appropriate... but it&#39;s going a little too far.</p><hr><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500Well...&quot;</p><p>I hold my breath and scan the area.</p><p>No sign of anyone else around.</p><p>Of course there are less and less people as night falls, thanks to the rumors of the vampire murders starting up again, but...</p><hr><p>I can understand why no one would be in the park, or the back alley, but this place is empty of people for another reason.</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;...... Well, after all, this is private property. The only people around would be trespassing, so why should I expect to see anybody......?&quot;</p><p>\u2500\u2500\u2500And then,</p><p>I suddenly get assailed by nausea.</p><p>My fingers are numb and my throat is parched.</p><p>My pulse quickens.</p><p>A feeling like poison creeping from the back of my brain.</p><p>Without even realizing it, my right hand reaches into my pocket and soundlessly takes out my knife.</p><hr><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500This... sensation.&quot;</p><p>...... I&#39;ve felt these chills so many times before.</p><p>Am I just disposed to this?</p><p>Before I meet up with something unworldly, I always get assailed by this sensation.</p><hr><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;............&quot;</p><p>...... I sense someone.</p><p>Someone standing right behind me.</p><p>Someone (a human?) on this private property where no one should be.</p><p>A faint chill.</p><p>And...... the vampire has returned\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500!</p><hr><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;...... But, something is......&quot;</p><p>It feels a little different.</p><p>Are my reactions weak?</p><p>It simply feels &quot;different from usual&quot;, a discomfort that indicates the presence of an outsider.</p><hr><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;\u2500\u2500Well, show yourself......!&quot;</p><hr><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Hello? Is someone there?&quot;</p><p>I speak with my knife hidden behind my back.</p><p>\u2500\u2500\u2500And then,</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Good evening. Do you have business with me?&quot;</p><p>Even though it was all so sudden, the girl speaks so calmly.</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500&quot;</p><hr><p>Seeing her, I was startled.</p><p>That distinctive dress and hat.</p><p>Definitely a foreign look, and I&#39;m almost afraid to say it, but she looks really cute.</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;What is it?&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Oh, ah... well, no, nothing really.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Um\u2500\u2500Sorry, I mistook you for someone else. Sorry to be so rude.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;You do not have to apologize.</p><p>But that is not the way to greet someone, is it?&quot;</p><hr><p>Her tone is so smooth.</p><p>...... Now that she mentions it, it makes total sense.</p><p>Lately, I seem to be off-kilter.</p><hr><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;...... You&#39;re right. It&#39;s a little late, but, good evening.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Yes, nice to meet you.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;So, what are you doing here?</p><p>Are you looking for something at this hour?&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Eh? ...... Ah, yeah, something like that.</p><p>And what about you? You couldn&#39;t have not heard about how dangerous it is at night\u2500\u2500&quot;</p><hr><p>Oh, right.</p><p>If she&#39;s a foreigner, she wouldn&#39;t have heard the rumors circulating this town.</p><p>Since she&#39;s probably just sightseeing, she wouldn&#39;t know anything about the vampire murders last year, either......</p><hr><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;It&#39;s nothing...... Um, I don&#39;t know why you are here, but it&#39;s better to not hang around places where no one is around. You never know what might happen.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500&quot;</p><hr><p>She just stares at me.</p><p>...... It&#39;s only natural.</p><p>There&#39;s no way she can understand me if I keep suddenly blurting out all this stuff.</p><hr><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;No, you cannot say I don&#39;t know what will happen. Whatever shape he takes, the vampire will appear. Even you are patrolling in order to find him, are you not, Tohno Shiki?&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;W\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500what?&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;You could say we are looking for the same thing, Tohno Shiki. ...... Although our reasons are very different.&quot;</p><hr><p>She speaks devoid of any expression.</p><p>Those chills return.</p><p>Pain in my temples like a stabbing needle...</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;An irregularity like you throws the equation out of balance. Unless I move quickly to root out any problems, the results this time will also be undesirable.&quot;</p><p>Her arms swings forth and I hear an unfamiliar click.</p><p>She holds a black gun in her hand.</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500Please, resist if you wish. My name is Sion Eltnam Atlasia. Your freedom now belongs to me.&quot;</p><p>And with that, she jumps towards me.</p><p>This foreign girl I&#39;d never met before attacks me with almost unspeakable speed.</p><hr><h2 id="shiki-vs-sion" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#shiki-vs-sion" aria-hidden="true">#</a> <em>Shiki vs Sion</em></h2><h2 id="shiki-wins" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#shiki-wins" aria-hidden="true">#</a> <em>Shiki wins</em></h2><hr><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Ahh......&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;That&#39;s enough. I don&#39;t know what you&#39;re trying to do, but it&#39;s meaningless to continue.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Yes. I admit defeat. Even though I collected all your data I could not finish reading it. ...... Even if everything was walking on a tightrope I can&#39;t believe I&#39;m finished before even had a chance to start.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;...............&quot;</p><hr><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;What&#39;s the matter? I have no strength to resist. This may be a selfish request, but please end it as cleanly as possible.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;...... Cleanly as possible? Look...... You seem to know something about me, but aren&#39;t you making a big mistake here? I&#39;m no killer out for blood. Even if you asked me I wouldn&#39;t kill you.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Not... a killer?&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Yeah. I&#39;m not going to hit someone while they&#39;re down. I don&#39;t have a quarrel with you so there&#39;s no need to take it all the way. If you promise you won&#39;t attack me I&#39;ll let you go. \u2500\u2500You don&#39;t look like a vampire anyway.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;...... This is troubling. I may keep quiet, but I will not lie. Therefore I can&#39;t promise not to attack you again.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Eh? ...... You can&#39;t... then you mean... um...&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;That&#39;s right. Once my wounds heal, I will bind you.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500&quot;</p><hr><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;If you don&#39;t like it, then you just have to kill me. For someone like you it would be very easy.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;......... Idiot, what do you mean, easy?&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Eh? Did you say something, Tohno Shiki?&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Yeah, I said something. I was complaining about being involved in something weird again! ...... For crying out loud, if it&#39;s not one thing it&#39;s another\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500&quot;</p><hr><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500I cannot understand. This seems to be causing you pain.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;You&#39;re the one who isn&#39;t understandable. But you don&#39;t look like you&#39;ll go back on your word.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Yes. As long as I am not mistaken, I will not change.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;I see. Your expression speaks for you. (Why do I only meet these kinds of people?)&quot;</p><hr><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Well, anyway...... Um, can you tell me about your situation? You&#39;ve been telling me what to do, so maybe you can at least tell me why?&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;...... My situation ... You mean my purpose here?&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Yeah. For some reason, you don&#39;t seem like a bad person. If you could tell me about your situation, I&#39;ll listen... Um, I&#39;m also kind of curious why you attacked me.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;...... I understand. I was told you were not a bad person, and this confirms it. I should have explained the circumstances from the very start, Tohno Shiki.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;?&quot;</p><hr><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;My goal is to find a cure for vampirism. I have been researching a way to return humans bitten by a vampire back to normal.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;A cure for vampirism......?&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Yes. As you know someone who became no longer human after being bitten by a vampire, you can understand, right? The result of someone being desecrated by a vampire is death. Of course, we know how a human could become a vampire, but we don&#39;t know if a vampire could return to being a human. Many magi have attempted to research this problem and failed, but I do not intend to. I will make the impossible possible. That is what Atlasia means.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;...............&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Tohno Shiki, I believe you can understand how I feel. Like me, you have seen a friend become a vampire before your eyes.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500You seem to know a lot about that.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Ah...... That was inconsiderate of me. This is upsetting you.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;...... No, it&#39;s okay. I&#39;m just being childish.&quot;</p><hr><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;I understand what you&#39;re saying. You want to find a cure for vampirism\u2500\u2500I can&#39;t hate you for something like that.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;But why did you attack me? I&#39;m not turning into a vampire, and I don&#39;t know a lot about them, either.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Of course. I did not come here to make you a research specimen. I came to this country to ask the cooperation of the True Ancestor.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Eh\u2500\u2500\u2500True Ancestor, as in Arcueid?&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Yes. If I want to find a cure for vampirism I have to study the source of Dead Apostles, a True Ancestor. If I merely needed data on the Dead Apostles, The Church has compiled much of that. However, that is insufficient. I need to investigate an unaltered True Ancestor.&quot;</p><hr><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;...... I see. But I&#39;m not sure Arcueid would go for that. She&#39;s kind of fickle that way.</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;I know that. A noble True Ancestor would not grant the request of a mere mortal. I need you to negotiate for me.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Me? Negotiate?&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;(Nod)&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Idio-That&#39;s not going to work! You think she&#39;d listen to me? Where&#39;d you get an idea like that!?&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;W-well, you... the True Ancestor... aren&#39;t the two of you... l-l-lovers?&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500&quot;</p><hr><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;With you as a mediator, perhaps I could speak with her a little. That is why I wanted to secure you first...... This is all the result of my carelessness.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Wha...... carelessness? You mean before?&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Yes. I drew in all your data. The numbers indicated we were evenly matched, but my thorough knowledge meant my chances of winning were high. However, my loss means my abilities were the slightest fraction lower.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;......? Um, then that isn&#39;t being careless...... doesn&#39;t that just mean your fighting ability is\u2500\u2500\u2500&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Wha, what are you sayinggg! I only lost because of carelessness! Excessive carelessness! My performance was far below my standard! I admit I miscalculated your power, but under normal circumstances, I would be the victor! You see, an hour ago, I calculated every single one of your maneuvers. Doesn&#39;t this just mean my evasion rate data was off by less than 0.5%!? If not for that one small mistake, our positions would have been completely reversed! Can you not understand such a simple thing!?&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Eh\u2500\u2500\u2500right. Sorry I doubted you.&quot;</p><hr><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Ah...... no, I was being a little rude. I would appreciate it if we just changed the subject.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;(......Hmm. She seems totally different from before.)</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;To get back to your problem, you really just want me to bring Arcueid to you?&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Yes. My intent was to formally request the True Ancestor&#39;s cooperation.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;I see. So you won&#39;t give up even now? ...... Okay...... if that&#39;s the case, oh well.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;? Oh well? What do you mean?&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;I mean, I can act as a middle man between you and Arcueid. ...... In all likelihood she&#39;s going to say no, but you wouldn&#39;t give up unless we tried, right?&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;(Nod)&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;C&#39;mon, it&#39;s just asking for cooperation, right? So, I&#39;ll lend you a hand. To be honest, I&#39;d like to cheer on someone doing your kind of research.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Eh......... cheer... on......?&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Yeah. Suddenly attacking me out of nowhere was surprising, but we can call it even. ...... If your research is successful, I feel like\u2500\u2500\u2500I could finally help her.&quot;</p><hr><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;..................&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;I&#39;ll do something about Arcueid. Actually, I&#39;m looking for her right now. I figured she would know something about these disturbances happening. I went to her place, but\u2500\u2500\u2500&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;So she has concealed her location.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Yeah. And by patrolling the town, I thought I&#39;d find the rumored vampire, or at least Her Highness the fickle princess.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;...... I understand. Then I can lend you a hand in your purpose. If you&#39;re tracking down the rumors, I can find the vampire more quickly than you can.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Eh? Really?&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Yes, if the rumored vampire does exist. Data gathering is my specialty. If I have at least a backup, I can scan the minds of everyone in this town in one day.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;\u2500\u2500\u2500Hmm, I don&#39;t really quite understand, but you don&#39;t have to go that far, do you?&quot; (...... She has a scary look in her eyes.)</p><hr><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;But, yeah. I&#39;d appreciate any help. I was feeling kind of hopeless by myself.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Then I will chase down these rumors. And you?&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;It&#39;s alright if I look for Arcueid and bring her to you isn&#39;t it? But, there&#39;s one other thing before that.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Before that?&quot;</p><hr><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;It&#39;s Sion, right? If we&#39;re going to be partners, we should call each other by our first names, shouldn&#39;t we?&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;You have a point. Very well. You may call me Sion. And you\u2500\u2500\u2500&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Ah, Shiki&#39;s fine.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;...... Shi-Shiki.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Yeah. That&#39;s much better, isn&#39;t it?&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;...... Shiki...&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Yeah.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Shiki.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Yeah, I said that&#39;s fine.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;..........................................&quot;</p><hr><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;............... Then I will go start gathering information on the vampire. Please prepare for the negotiations with the True Ancestor, Shiki.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Yeah. But we don&#39;t have to go right away, you know.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;That would be the best, I think. We&#39;ll both need some time. Let&#39;s meet again tomorrow night right here, in front of this building.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Okay. I think I can manage something by then.&quot;</p><hr><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Shiki. Can you... hold on for a minute?&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Eh......? Did I have something on my head?&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;...... Something like that. Well then, see you tomorrow night.&quot;</p><hr><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Yeah, see you tomorrow\u2500\u2500\u2500Hm. This seems a little familiar.

You are right on time, Shiki.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Same for you. A big difference from someone I know.&quot;</p><p>...... Actually, she would come extremely early and then go hide.</p><hr><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Shiki. How did things turn out with the True Ancestor?&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Well, it can be pretty hard to get hold of her sometimes. But I left a note in her room. Maybe tomorrow will be different...&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Is that so? So she covers her tracks well. This won&#39;t be easy.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Right, right. As fickle as she is, she might just have decided to go off and play around for a while without even knowing what&#39;s going on.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Perhaps. Do you not think she left you intentionally, Shiki?&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;\u2500\u2500\u2500Intentionally? What do you mean, Sion?&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;I mean that the returned vampire could possibly be the True Ancestor.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>:&quot;That&#39;s impossible. Arcueid would never do the kinds of things they&#39;re talking about.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;...... Never? You really are a wonderful person, denying it so completely like that, Shiki.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Er, well, thanks...&quot;</p><p>I stammer a reply.</p><p>For some reason, her words don&#39;t seem sarcastic, and almost have a ring of admiration to them.</p><hr><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;A-anyway, Arcueid doesn&#39;t drink human blood. You might not know that, Sion, but she\u2500\u2500\u2500&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;She isn&#39;t the vampire in the rumors, right? If you say so.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;However, if the vampire has returned to this town, then isn&#39;t it strange that there is no other vampire around besides the True Ancestor? There has to be something which was a model for all these rumors.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;A model for the rumors......? Wouldn&#39;t that be the incident from a year ago?&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;That isn&#39;t the model, but the source. The rumors have been very clear about that. No one has actually seen or heard anything themselves. Putting aside what is true or false, does there not have to be some &#39;shadowy figure wandering the night&#39; on which to base these rumors?&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;......?&quot;</p><p>Sion is a little hard to follow. No, in the first place\u2500\u2500\u2500</p><hr><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Sion, I&#39;ve been wondering. You talk about research and studying vampires... who exactly are you?&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;I am an alchemist. You know about magi, do you not? The one named Ciel belongs to The Church, but there is another organization called the Mage&#39;s Association.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;I am a member of the Mage&#39;s Association. There are three separate branches. I belong to Atlas.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;The Church views vampires as their enemy, but they have an agreement with us, the Mage&#39;s Association. ...... You could say we&#39;re a military force that isn&#39;t black, but not white either.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;...... Mage&#39;s Association......&quot;</p><p>...... Hmm. If that&#39;s the case then maybe Sensei is also in this Association.</p><p>Maybe Sion even knows her.</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;I do not. Your Sensei is London&#39;s problem child, so it is natural for a member of Atlas like me to not have met her.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;W-what did you say, Sion? How did you...&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;I can tell what you&#39;re thinking. You&#39;re someone whose face is easily read.&quot;</p><p>...... Hmph.</p><p>I&#39;m used to Akiha and the others saying that, but it is a bit of a shock to hear it from Sion, whom I&#39;ve just met.</p><hr><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;...... Whatever. Then what do we do from here? It isn&#39;t fair if you don&#39;t tell me the results on all the information you gathered before.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;I don&#39;t mind. But what I gathered was not really any different than the rumors you heard. So I have nothing to tell you.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;My. That&#39;s a little troubling.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Isn&#39;t it? So now we will just have to confirm it with our own eyes after all. If we&#39;re going to find the rumored vampire and the source behind it, we have to search the city at night.&quot;</p><p>...... So we&#39;re back to that. I didn&#39;t expect anything better.</p><p>This reminds me more and more of what happened last year.</p><hr><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;So...... This is my plan, Shiki. Why don&#39;t we look together? I don&#39;t know this town very well. I would be wasting my time without a guide.</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Eh? ...... Well, they say two heads are better than one but is it alright? Your purpose is to research vampires, so......&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;We cannot declare for certain the source of these rumors isn&#39;t the True Ancestor, correct? Reason stands that if we fulfill your goal, it would be easier to find the True Ancestor. It would be meaningless if only I found the True Ancestor, and you would become free much quicker. I think that goes without saying.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500&quot;</p><p>I see, that&#39;s what she&#39;s thinking.</p><p>Well, we&#39;ll see, I guess.</p><hr><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Alright. Give-and-take, then.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Yes. As much as I can, I will help you with your agenda.&quot;</p><hr><h4 id="park" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#park" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Park</h4><hr><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;We&#39;ve walked so far and still we haven&#39;t found anything. The town is strangely quiet, but there&#39;s no odd feeling to the air.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;We haven&#39;t gone into the areas mentioned in the rumors. I hate to say this, but more victims will appear as time passes.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Huh?

Don&#39;t tell me, you...&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;I think you misunderstand, agent. I asked for Shiki&#39;s help, so he accompanied me.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;No one forced him. As for what you&#39;re thinking about, no.&quot;</p><p><strong>Ciel</strong>: &quot;...... Is that so? So he has nothing to do with you, then. So you won&#39;t ask for his help when we fight.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500&quot;</p><hr><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Se, Senpai, hold on! This may look like something is going on, but you don&#39;t have to bring out your Black Keys like that all of a sudden.&quot;</p><p><strong>Ciel</strong>: &quot;Tohno-kun please be quiet! ...... Goodness, why do you always show up in these bothersome situations? Or is it that you can&#39;t resist the request of a cute girl?&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;T-that&#39;s definitely not it!&quot;</p><p><strong>Ciel</strong>: &quot;At any rate, stand aside, Tohno-kun. I will not listen any longer. If you get in my way, prepare to be punished.&quot;</p><p><strong>Ciel</strong>: &quot;Sion Eltnam Atlasia. An order has been issued by The Church to take you into protective custody, or failing that, to capture you by any means necessary. A similar request has been issued by the Atlas Institute. Do you have anything to say in your defense?&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;\u2500\u2500I have nothing to say. But I will not let you capture me. If you try, you will be destroyed.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Yeah, saying that all of a sudden is a little\u2500\u2500 W-wait, Sion... What did you just say!?&quot;</p><p><strong>Ciel</strong>: &quot;You will not comply with The Church&#39;s orders? Very well, then. As an agent of The Church, I am placing you under arrest.&quot;</p><p><strong>Ciel</strong>: &quot;I will make you reflect on your actions.

Ciel, if you do not leave at once, I will burn up Shiki&#39;s brain.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;The artificial nervous system implanted in Shiki, my Etherlite, is connected to me through my bracelet. I can destroy his brain at any time if you do not agree to leave me alone.&quot;</p><p><strong>Ciel</strong>: &quot;Etherlite...... I&#39;ve heard of that before. I thought it sounded familiar, but the name Eltnam is related to that man... typical of Atlas. I&#39;ll accept this temporarily.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;You should not speak of knowledge gained from Roa. I am different from that man you speak of.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;But, we are getting ahead of ourselves. This Etherlite is connected to Shiki&#39;s brain. Before you could stop me, his brain would be fried.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Sion, you......&quot;</p><p><strong>Ciel</strong>: &quot;...... I see. So you enlisted him for purposes of using him as a hostage all along.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Of course.

Please try and make the best of a bad situation.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500!&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Eh\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500Um, Senpai?&quot;</p><p><strong>Ciel</strong>: &quot;You agreed to cooperate with Sion Eltnam, so you brought this on yourself. Well, it is probably good policy to stay in the good graces of the one who could fry your brain, Tohno\u2212kun.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Uwaaa, Senpai, you&#39;ve really said it now!&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;............&quot;</p><p><strong>Ciel</strong>: &quot;\u2500\u2500\u2500It would be easy if it was this simple, though. Unfortunately, I cannot believe all of that, Sion Eltnam.&quot;</p><p><strong>Ciel</strong>: &quot;Certainly you would turn him into a vegetable if I tried anything. No matter what I did, I could not stop you.&quot;</p><p><strong>Ciel</strong>: &quot;However, it would not be anything that could not be healed. After I brought you down, I could simply heal him.&quot;</p><p><strong>Ciel</strong>: &quot;...... But, your control over him is different. I cannot win as long as Tohno\u2212kun is restrained. In the worst case, I could not even escape.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500&quot;</p><hr><p><strong>Ciel</strong>: &quot;It&#39;s not impossible for us to start over here. Certainly I received an order to arrest Sion Eltnam, but it is just one of many orders. My priority mission is to deal with the Dead Apostle that is hiding somewhere in this town. I can deal with your case after that mission is over.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;The Dead Apostle hiding in this town...... Senpai, so you are looking into the rumored vampire after all!?&quot;</p><p><strong>Ciel</strong>: &quot;The Church has decided to investigate, and the job of eliminating it has fallen to me. That mission takes precedence over her arrest. However, do not think there will be a second time... I will not let you off next time.&quot;</p><p><strong>Ciel</strong>: &quot;Okay? By then, please cut your ties with her. ...... Really, Tohno\u2212Kun, even though you already have so many loose ends, you voluntarily stick your neck out for even more......&quot;</p><hr><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Senpai\u2500\u2500\u2500seems to have let us go.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;A wise move. If she tried to force the issue, the cost in terms of time and effort would be greatly damaging to efficiency.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;What is it, Shiki? You seem like you wish to say something.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Sion. Was what you said really true? You&#39;re connected to my head?&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;It is not exactly like that. The Etherlite, the artificial nervous system, is simply linked with your nervous system. It will not cause any problems with your brain.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;That&#39;s not what I meant. Why did you do that?&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;I did it so I could locate you when I needed you. And to get information from you.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;And what about your threat? Could you really burn out my brain?&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Yes. It would take some work, but the chances of success are very high.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;...... That pisses me off. This isn&#39;t exactly what you call a cooperative relationship.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;...... You are right. I understand how you feel. But that is why I decided not to tell you.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;You deliberately hid this?&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Yes. I thought you might refuse to cooperate if you knew, and I didn&#39;t want to lose a valuable partner. I decided it was best to conceal it.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;...... I see. You just certainly know everything about what I would do.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Of course. But it is a last resort. If I did use it, there would be no going back.&quot;</p><hr><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;I understand if you want to part ways here.

Let&#39;s just drop it.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Eh?&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Let&#39;s just forget about what happened earlier. ...... Well, it was a pretty good plan after all.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Huh?&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;I&#39;m saying, you were right, it might really have been the best course of action after all. With your bluff, you were able to drive Senpai away.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;...... Wrong, it was not a threat. I was not lying earlier, I really was\u2500\u2500\u2500kyaa!?&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Stupid, at times like this, you should just go with it. You should just say &#39;yes&#39; like you normally do, Sion.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Y...... yes, if you say so, Shiki\u2500\u2500\u2500&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Alright, then that&#39;s how we&#39;ll look at it. But I have a few things to ask you, and I don&#39;t want you leaving out the details.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;.......................................................................................&quot;</p><hr><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Alright. Senpai said you were a wanted criminal. What&#39;s that about? Aren&#39;t you just researching a cure for vampirism?&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;As you say, I am just researching a cure for vampirism. But, that went against the doctrine of Atlas.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;The Magi Association I belong to makes no exceptions for breaking its precepts. In my research, I had to do just that. That is why they are after me.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Breaking its precepts... Sion, did you kill someone in your experiments?&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Of course not. The Atlas Academy only has one precept. The results of one&#39;s research are not to be shared with anyone other than the researcher. ...... But I could not complete my research with just Atlas&#39;s resources alone. I needed the help of other associations. I traveled to them, and traded my research for theirs. To Atlas, that is an unforgivable sin. I knew they were chasing me, but it is surprising they even went so far as to reach an agreement with The Church. Then again, I have been out of touch for half a year.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;...... Hm. What you&#39;re saying is, your school doesn&#39;t permit you to study abroad?&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;...... Yes. You could put it that way. By doing so, I have been branded a traitor.&quot;</p><hr><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;A traitor, isn&#39;t that a little...... much? Senpai was pretty serious, I couldn&#39;t imagine why. ...... But your explanation about breaking the rules makes sense. Still, why did you have to go so far if you knew what kind of trouble you&#39;d get into?&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;...... There was no other way. If I stayed in Atlas, I couldn&#39;t finish my research on vampires. Staying would have been a mistake. I must find a cure for vampirism, by any means necessary\u2500\u2500\u2500!&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Well, then, I guess it can&#39;t be helped. (Sion&#39;s really not the type to back down.)&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Alright. Well, let&#39;s get started finding Arcueid then.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Eh?&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Well, Sion, you said you need Arcueid&#39;s help to complete your research, right? So we have to hurry up and talk to her. I promised you that I&#39;d see this through to the end.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;...... You mean, maybe I cannot say it directly...... that you still plan on helping me?&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Yeah.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;But I used you as a shield. And if I decide it is the best course of action again, there&#39;s no way you can stop me from doing it! Even knowing that\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500um.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;It&#39;s alright. It would be tough for me to find the rumored vampire without you, Sion.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Yes. I understand, Shiki.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Well, our partnership is renewed...... Ah, that&#39;s right.&quot;</p><hr><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Partners usually shake hands to mark the occasion, but we kind of skipped that part.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Here.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;?&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Yeah, a handshake. Maybe we should do that, Sion.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;............ (open, close)&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;? Sion, you&#39;re just opening and closing your hand. Maybe... you think my hand is dirty or something?&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;............... (Open, close. Open, close.)&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;???&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;(Stops)\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500Shiki.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Uh, eh? Wha, what is it? D\u2212did I do something wrong!?&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;...... There&#39;s no need for you to touch me excessively. I may be on the run from Atlas, but I am still the successor of the House of Eltnam. In the future, please bear that in mind.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Ah\u2500\u2500\u2500yeah, got it.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;The operation will commence at once. In the daytime I can gather information on my own, but at night, we are better off patrolling the town together. I will not be able to do anything if I find the True Ancestor alone, and it would be dangerous for you if you encountered the rumored vampire alone.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Eh\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500slow down there, Sion! I need to rest a little from that fight!&quot;</p><hr><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;......

If Arcueid is the source of these rumors, then they can&#39;t be believed, right?&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Of course. They are just rumors after all. But, if rumors converge, then they become real. The True Ancestor seems to walking around town aimlessly. That is why the rumors about her are increasing...... There are also rumors about a girl with red hair searching for her prey.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;G\u2212girl with red hair!?&quot;</p><hr><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;...... That is just what was said. At any rate, the rumors indicate that the True Ancestor is the serial killer. Please act accordingly, Shiki.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;...... Got it. Anyway, let&#39;s go to the park for now, Sion. We can probably meet up with Arcueid.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;............ That is true. It might be better to have a painful experience at least once.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Hm? Did you say something?&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Yes, but I was merely thinking aloud.

Because you were so late, I wanted to have a little fun. So I trapped five or six people here and played around with them. But, you don&#39;t need to worry. I didn&#39;t drink their blood. I won&#39;t do anything that makes me lose control like drinking blood.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500You...&quot;</p><p><strong>Arcueid</strong>: &quot;What, you&#39;re upset?

This is the vampire that has been stalking the town. Looking at her, in this situation, there is no other explanation.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;What...... No, that&#39;s wrong. That, has to be wrong. Because Arcueid would never\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;This is not Arcueid Brunestud. Is that not right, Arcueid Brunestud?&quot;</p><hr><p><strong>Arcueid(?)</strong>: &quot;Yeah, I&#39;m really not Arcueid. I&#39;m just an Arcueid, Shiki. ...... Ah, is this confusing you? Would it be easier to understand if I said I was a fake Arcueid?&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;A fake...... I can understand that, but you\u2500&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;A fake is not exactly correct. Because it really is Arcueid Brunestud. In the first place, that Dead Apostle...... &#39;Tatari&#39; cannot be described of in terms of real and fake. It is just the manifestation of rumors about a sinister vampire\u2500\u2500\u2500&quot;</p><p><strong>Arcueid(Tatari)</strong>: &quot;Hmph, after three years it&#39;s still the same old thing.

Yes, it really was a good idea to let you live.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;If your intent is self\u2212destruction, then you are correct. I came here to stop you, Tatari.

In this town, there&#39;s a killer more suited to Tatari than the True Ancestor?&quot;</p><p><strong>Arcueid(Tatari)</strong>: &quot;...... That&#39;s rough. I thought this me would be the best, but it&#39;s hard to pass up your power. Hmmm, which one should I choose? Which one, which one......&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500&quot;</p><p><strong>Arcueid(Tatari)</strong>: &quot;Oh, you don&#39;t have to worry you know.

It&#39;ll be hard to keep this body like this.&quot;</p><p><strong>???</strong>: &quot;\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500Very well. The True Ancestor&#39;s capacities are superior, but not impossible to reach.

I wasn&#39;t able to do it that well every time\u2500\u2500\u2500but that doesn&#39;t really matter. There&#39;s some things we do have to talk about.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Things, such as what?&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;That vampire from before. Do you two know each other? You called it Tatari.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;It is not a matter of knowing each other. I only encountered Tatari once before.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;So you know what the heck that is?&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Yes. That is the Dead Apostle named Tatari and the rumored vampire you are looking for.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;That was!? ..... you mean, Arcueid is the one that rumors are being made about!? Well, of course it&#39;s not the real Arcueid, but that fake Arcueid. It really was just like Arcueid though.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;No, you have it backwards. The rumored vampire is Arcueid, so Tatari became Arcueid Brunestud.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Eh? (Sorry Sion, I&#39;m totally confused.)&quot;</p><hr><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;In other words, Tatari is a Dead Apostle that dons the largest curse within a closed area. In simpler terms, one who makes rumors into reality. Widespread rumors gradually start to feel real. Such as when you believed in the rumor that there is a killer in the park, you mistook these things for bodies.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Eh...... Whaaaat!? What is this, just scattered trash bags!? The dead bodies and blood was nothing more than trash\u2500\u2500\u2500!?&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Yes. When a rumor collects enough momentum, the probability of it becoming real increases until it reaches a certain point and it becomes Tatari. Tatari probably became the True Ancestor because many people believed the rumor about the killer being a blonde vampire. Of course, the True Ancestor really did not kill anyone. Consequently, Tatari has yet to kill anyone. Until the complete realization of a rumor, Tatari cannot truly resemble the rumor.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;...... So it just makes copies of others? It&#39;s a pretty troublesome guy. You seem to know a lot, Sion.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500I have done a lot of research on vampires, so I at least know about the Dead Apostles.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;.....................&quot;</p><p>Perhaps.</p><p>It seems like there may be another reason why Sion knows about Tatari.</p><p>..... I have to figure it out.</p><hr><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Sion. You and that vampire...&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;\u2500\u2500More importantly, I have to warn you, Shiki. Unfortunately, Tatari did not choose the True Ancestor, but an irregular like you. ...... No, &#39;choose&#39; is not the correct word. Tatari does not have the power to do that.&quot;</p><p>Sion exhales in utter exhaustion.</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Eh? Choose me? For what?&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;The vampire chose you. It wanted not a True Ancestor who does not drink blood, but a true killer. Tatari is a Dead Apostle that emerges from rumor and information. If Tatari copies the killer named Shiki, many people will die.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Copies Shiki\u2500\u2500\u2500you mean, Roa SHIKI!?&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Not Roa. Maybe the rumors are based on the vampire Roa, but the one believed to be the killer is you. Even you fear the possibility of you becoming a killer. The more a rumor spreads, the more people will fear. Tatari uses that pattern to find an easy form to assume. Once someone is killed, those rumors will become completely true.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Li\u2212like I would let that happen! Sion, you really know a lot about him, so you know where he went, right!?&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;I cannot say it will for sure happen, but if Tatari wishes to become &#39;Shikiller&#39;, it will have to go where he is recorded the most vividly.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Where he is recorded most vividly\u2500\u2500\u2500&quot;</p><p>In other words, where he appeared the most.</p><p>That means\u2500\u2500\u2500</p><div class="custom-container tip"><p class="custom-container-title">TL Note</p><p>Shikiller (i.e. Satsujinki) is written \u6BBA\u4EBA\u8CB4, not \u6BBA\u4EBA\u9B3C, it&#39;s a play on words.<br> \u6BBA\u4EBA\u9B3C just means &quot;a bloodthirsty killer&quot; or &quot;a homicidal maniac&quot;, things to that effect.<br> It&#39;s literally \u6BBA\u4EBA\u9B3C (satsujinki) with \u9B3C (ki) replaced with the \u8CB4 (ki) from \u5FD7\u8CB4 (shiki)<br> It&#39;s a god awful pun and you can blame Nasu for that</p></div><hr><h4 id="alley-1" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#alley-1" aria-hidden="true">#</a> <em>Alley</em></h4><hr><p>We run to the back alley.</p><p>No one is around.</p><p>As usual, it is totally quiet.</p><p>The hot summer night air flows through this place.</p><p>Right there, in the middle of it all, like a chick emerging from an egg, it stands there covered in viscous night.</p><hr><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;\u2500\u2500\u2500I knew it.

It&#39;s too much for the vampire Tatari that prefers blood, but isn&#39;t it human to want to try things at least once?&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Foolish. Like that, you cannot reach your goal. You will run away from your ultimate goal for just momentary pleasure?&quot;</p><p><strong>Nanaya Shiki(Tatari)</strong>: &quot;Hmph. Easy for you to say. Certainly this time is the best yet. I will not have this opportunity again. But, that is not to say never.&quot;</p><p><strong>Nanaya Shiki(Tatari)</strong>: &quot;This time I will enjoy the Mystic Eyes of Death Perception, and next time I will pursue my goal as Tatari.
