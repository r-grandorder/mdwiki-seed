She hides her true feelings without letting anyone know, due to her always taking the surrounding mood into consideration\u2014the very picture of a perfectly common girl.<br> Spending her time doing nothing but studying magecraft, she is a practical researcher who runs around the fields just like a young boy.<br> As the Child of Prophecy, she sets out in response to the expectations of those around her, journeying for the sake of saving Britain, thus taking on the role of the story&#39;s protagonist.<br> ...At least ostensibly, this is her personality and disposition.</p><p>The Artoria from Pan-Human History had a personality without facades, but Artoria Caster is not so strong. On the inside, she is a pessimist with an extremely frail and timid disposition.<br> Two factors\u2014the Fairy Eyes which let her see the lies of all the world, and being a Fairy of Paradise meant to put an end to Britain\u2014made Artoria Caster have such a despondent, not to mention pessimistic, disposition.<br> (This was further fueled by the apathetic influence of the childhood teacher who taught her magecraft)</p><p>In her heart, she lets out a sigh, thinking that both she herself, the &quot;Child of Prophecy&quot;, as well as the people around her who self-destruct by placing their hopes on someone like her, are all fools.<br> (It is not like she has burned out or is looking down on them. She is merely feeling heavy.)</p><p>Still, since she is mindful about the surrounding mood, Artoria does not reveal those inner aspects of herself, and instead ends up keeping up appearances by saying &quot;Okay, leave it to me!&quot; and behaving exactly as those around her expect.</p><p>She wasn&#39;t always the strong heroine you see today. She&#39;s a hard-working commoner who is bad at the essentials, makes a lot of blunders, and stumbles all over her path. Her only merit is the fact she is quick to get up after a fall. One can say that the very fact that her personality\u2014worrying about her surroundings, without falling to evil nor forgetting about decorum\u2014does not waver, no matter what sort of harsh circumstances or cruel treatment she faces, serves as proof that she is a noblewoman. This is the definitive difference between her and the Fairy King Oberon.</p><p>\u25C7</p><p>During the pilgrimage portion of \u201CRound Table of the Fairy Realm - Avalon le Fae\u201D, the false Child of Prophecy, Mashu, was motivated by a thought such as \u201CI\u2019m scared, but I need to do the best I can in order to help everyone\u201D. Meanwhile, the true Child of Prophecy, Caster, was motivated by a thought such as \u201CI\u2019m scared, but I have no choice but to continue, since everyone would be disappointed if I said anything\u201D.</p><p>She kept hiding this negative mental state in which &quot;everyone is scary, society is disgusting, and I can&#39;t keep my motivation up even if you tell me to save the world. But since going against those around me is also unpleasant, I&#39;ll work hard as a savior&quot;.</p><p>Although that ended up becoming a noble deed in the eyes of others, &quot;the same way of being as King Arthur&quot;, Artoria Caster&#39;s inner aspects are awfully abject, pessimistic and negative. As such, she is always finding faults in herself.<br> &quot;I was able to persevere this time, but most likely, next time, I will probably end up giving up on everything...&quot;</p><p>If the Fairy Kingdom is a fairy tale imagined by Morgan, the journey of pilgrimage is a fairy tale describing Artoria&#39;s growth. Despite appearing to fill the same role as Dorothy\u2014the protagonist of &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;\u2014she actually possesses a weakness akin to an aggregation of the scarecrow that can&#39;t walk properly (can&#39;t see his own feet, has no wits), the woodcutter with a hollow heart, and the lion that doesn&#39;t want to display courage.<br> Why was this Artoria able to remain as the Child of Prophecy to the very end?

However, she doesn\u2019t tell anyone that she received Artoria\u2019s name.<br> During the final part of the opening scenario, when the main character is discovered to be human, and the fairies are pushed to the brink of savageness, she helps the main character and Artoria escape to the outskirts of the forest, but upon reaching her own limit, she turns into Moss, attacks the main character, and is then defeated.</p><p>Her true name is Hope.<br> She is a savior-type fairy, born to spread hope to the people (or rather, to the fairies).</p><p>\u25C7</p><p>Like the name \u201CHope\u201D implies, she is a fairy in charge of spreading hope throughout the world, and for a long time, she carried out her irresponsible duties (the unreasonable act of \u201Cmaking everyone happy\u201D without any form of concrete plan!), but people demanded hope endlessly, and before long, hope became something taken for granted. No matter what good deed she performed, no one appreciated her.

At least, when the name Hope is mentioned at the end, I would really like it for people to react with an \u201CAh...\u201D)</p><p>She lost her value to society, her role ended in fatigue, she became disappointed in herself, and both her place in the world and her name were lost.

Her second ascension design was drawn up as a rough sketch during the early stages of the second part [of the game]. When imagining a Caster-class Artoria, the idea that came to mind was \u201Can Artoria sneakily stealing Merlin\u2019s staff and traveling in secret, disguised as a magus\u201D. Both the silhouette, and the pose itself, were almost done already at that point. When it came to formally creating her character, I made her first ascension based on what I saw of her role in the script and such. I also wanted to give her a fitting final stage, so her third ascension had its concept completely revamped, attempting to give her a new design based on \u201Can Artoria who mastered magecraft\u201D. As work on this design progressed, I really did feel like all the different experiences I\u2019d gotten via FGO came together, and it gave me a sort of special emotional attachment to this project.

And elf ears!!! While her back is hidden behind her wings, the rounded back gives a sense of romanticism...and also, short-cut frizzy hair just makes it even better!! I was super happy that I got an OK in response when I submitted the final drawing where I had stealthily added her drawers for the hell of it. If she was ever going to fly, that addition would really put my mind at ease. When the request for this illustration came in, the lines for the setting were like \u201Ca fairy girl who loves flowers\u201D and \u201Cseeming rather hapless, admirable, and modest\u201D, so it turned out to be quite the unusual silhouette from what I normally like to draw! There just came more and more decorations! It felt so weird! I was also a bit...worried that the bouquet around her neck would turn out too flashy, but I absolutely wanted to include that flower element, and I\u2019m glad I was daring enough to do so. I guess I was also fortunate to have the luxury of coming up with the design while being able to fantasize about her standing next to Caster Artoria-chan...
