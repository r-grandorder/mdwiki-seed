After the Roushigumi was disbanded, he, Kondou, Hijikata and many others formed the Shinsengumi, where he was entrusted the position of First Troop Captain.</p><p>He displayed his sword talent in numerous battles, like the Ikedaya incident, and made the Shinsengumi\u2019s name famous in the Bakumatsu era Kyouto. But at that time, Okita\u2019s body started being consumed by his disease, and his condition was gradually getting worse. Eventually, he retreats from the frontlines to get treatment.</p><p>After that, he parts ways with companions and continues his treatment, but in 1868, he died before recovering in Sendagaya, Edo.
