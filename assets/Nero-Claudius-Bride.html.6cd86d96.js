Both magnanimity and delicacy are equally important.</p><p><strong>Nero Bride:</strong><br> Or rather, are you capable of complimenting your partner? Master, do you possess THAT within your heart?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...You mean tolerance?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> ...You mean resourcefulness?</p><hr><p><strong>Nero Bride:</strong><br> So you do understand.<br> From now, I will tangibly measure that virtue.</p><p><strong>Nero Bride:</strong><br> They&#39;re drawn here by the alluring fragrance of flowers.<br> Use me well, and defeat them.</p><p><strong>Nero Bride:</strong><br> I&#39;m an exquisite instrument playing sublime music. That instrument is for you to play.</p><p><strong>Nero Bride:</strong><br> Deftly take down your enemies to satisfy me.<br> I want us to make an oath to celebrate our meeting\u2014</p><p><strong>Nero Bride:</strong><br> Hmph, don&#39;t be so nervous.<br> In modern terms, it&#39;s simply an arranged marriage!</p><p><strong>Nero Bride:</strong><br> Let&#39;s go, Master!<br> This will be memorable...our first team effort!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Nero Bride:</strong><br> You fought well, but your instruction wasn&#39;t perfect.<br> I&#39;ll give you a passing grade, though barely.</p><p><strong>Nero Bride:</strong><br> I won&#39;t blame you for being a immature mage.<br> Actually, there&#39;s more anticipation.</p><p><strong>Nero Bride:</strong><br> Seeing just how much my Master will thrive is the privilege of the bride beside him.</p><p><strong>Nero Bride:</strong><br> Now, about the dowry... Don&#39;t make such a sour face.<br> Fujimaru, I&#39;m aware how empty your coffers are.</p><p><strong>Nero Bride:</strong><br> Perfect, I&#39;ll just take their jewelry instead.<br> This ring is just a toy, but it&#39;ll do for now.</p><p><strong>Nero Bride:</strong><br> Fit for a Servant that the bouquet of encounter is a battle.</p><p><strong>Nero Bride:</strong><br> Whether you&#39;re the ring to decorate my finger, or I&#39;m the jewel to decorate yours\u2014</p><p><strong>Nero Bride:</strong><br> That will be determined by the fights to come.<br> Let&#39;s see what you&#39;re made of, Master.</p><h2 id="the-bouquet-of-resolve" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#the-bouquet-of-resolve" aria-hidden="true">#</a> The Bouquet of Resolve</h2><p><strong>Nero Bride:</strong><br> So this is the place where the so-called Greater Grail was. Hm... I knew it. This spot would make an ideal forge.</p><p><strong>Nero Bride:</strong><br> Now then, Fujimaru.<br> I brought you here for a reason.</p><p><strong>Nero Bride:</strong><br> As we have grown quite accustomed to each other,<br> I&#39;m considering taking our contract to the next step.</p><p><strong>Nero Bride:</strong><br> To be specific, we&#39;re here to increase my strength. Now, I am well aware that you have no complaints about me.</p><p><strong>Nero Bride:</strong><br> I know I am a dependable Servant. Or, more accurately, the number one, most trustworthy Servant!</p><p><strong>Nero Bride:</strong><br> But...you know... Well... That&#39;s not enough for me.<br> I want you to rely on me even more!</p><p><strong>Nero Bride:</strong><br> So, to make that wish a reality, I&#39;ve created a situation where I am indispensable!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Um...?</p><p><strong>Nero Bride:</strong><br> Don&#39;t you understand!? I am going to be the ultimate Servant under your command!</p><p><strong>Nero Bride:</strong><br> That&#39;s right! I hereby declare it!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> You&#39;re already indispensable, Nero.</p><p><strong>Nero Bride:</strong><br> Umu! I knew it. I knew it!<br> Why you, stating the obvious! Yooou!</p><hr><p><strong>Nero Bride:</strong><br> ...Oops. This isn&#39;t the best place to raise one&#39;s voice.</p><p><strong>Nero Bride:</strong><br> To business, then!<br> Our task today is to strengthen my sword.</p><p><strong>Nero Bride:</strong><br> My sword is beautiful and excellent, but unlike many other Heroic Spirits&#39; weapons, mine has no specific legend of its own.</p><p><strong>Nero Bride:</strong><br> ...Umu. This is just between you and me.</p><p><strong>Nero Bride:</strong><br> I actually made this sword myself, by hand. That on its own makes it a most desirable weapon, but it doesn&#39;t make it very powerful.</p><p><strong>Nero Bride:</strong><br> So, I&#39;ve decided to reforge it, here on a new leyline! This iron meteorite is a spiritual stone that fell to Earth in the distant past.</p><p><strong>Nero Bride:</strong><br> What did Simon call them... Tears of the stars?<br> Things not of this world...</p><p><strong>Nero Bride:</strong><br> ...Fragments of hope that even the stars themselves could not know? ...Something like that. No matter.</p><p><strong>Nero Bride:</strong><br> We shall place it on the powerful leyline in the heart of this cavern, stoke it with fire, and infuse it with life.</p><p><strong>Nero Bride:</strong><br> ...There&#39;s just one problem.<br> I am sure I need not even say it, but...</p><p><strong>Nero Bride:</strong><br> Well, as you can see, this cavern is a den of wicked beasts! While I am strengthening my sword, I want you to protect me.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Leave it to me.</p><p><strong>Nero Bride:</strong><br> Umu, I&#39;m counting on you, Master!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> We can&#39;t fight together?</p><p><strong>Nero Bride:</strong><br> Urgh. Don&#39;t give me those abandoned puppy dog eyes.<br> I want to fight with you as well!</p><p><strong>Nero Bride:</strong><br> But the task of reforging this sword must be mine alone. I must refrain from battling alongside you.</p><hr><p><strong>Monster:</strong><br> ...!</p><p><strong>Nero Bride:</strong><br> They&#39;re here. I leave the rest to you!<br> Don&#39;t worry. I&#39;m a genius. I can finish it up in a day!</p><p><strong>Nero Bride:</strong><br> Commit yourself to a full day&#39;s worth of battle for me, without rest or sleep!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Are you done yet!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I&#39;m getting exhausted!</p><hr><p><strong>Nero Bride:</strong><br> Hmmmm... It&#39;s done, but something&#39;s missing...<br> I&#39;m not happy the way this is curved.</p><p><strong>Nero Bride:</strong><br> Okay, that settles it!<br> Rejoice, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Nero Bride:</strong><br> This will be an item of great sentimental value between us! It must be absolutely perfect! No compromises! Time to start over from scratch!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> What incredible professionalism!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> What are you thinking!?</p><hr><p><strong>Nero Bride:</strong><br> Hahaha, don&#39;t praise me so much. It&#39;s embarrassing!<br> All right, back to protecting me, Master!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Are...are you done this time!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> ...Um, I&#39;m getting REALLY tired!</p><hr><p><strong>Nero Bride:</strong><br> Hm. Damn. I cannot believe I of all people would make such a rudimentary mistake!</p><p><strong>Nero Bride:</strong><br> I forgot to engrave our names on the sword!</p><p><strong>Nero Bride:</strong><br> Good thing I caught the mistake!<br> I truly am a genius, and a lucky one at that!</p><p><strong>Nero Bride:</strong><br> That&#39;s okay! I&#39;ll just start over again!<br> I&#39;m really getting in the zone now, Master!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Like engraving our initials inside a heart!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Okay, Nero, what the hell?</p><hr><p><strong>Nero Bride:</strong><br> Don&#39;t get so excited. This will be the last one!<br> This will be an absolute masterpiece!</p><p><strong>Nero Bride:</strong><br> But it seems fate has finally caught up with us.</p><p><strong>Nero Bride:</strong><br> My beautiful sword, infused with the May wind...<br> It seems the creation of something so exquisite cannot be easily accomplished.</p><p><strong>Nero Bride:</strong><br> That is one peak of the Septem Montes!<br> An awakening of extreme greed from the capital of sin!</p><p><strong>Nero Bride:</strong><br> The dragon of the overflowing fountain of demonic energy: Avaritia! Hm? Why do I know this...?</p><p><strong>Nero Bride:</strong><br> ...Hm, I suppose it just kind of slipped out.<br> That does happen with me sometimes, you know...</p><p><strong>Nero Bride:</strong><br> Regardless, I can assure you that it is a terribly powerful enemy! It is truly an offering worthy for the creation of my Noble Phantasm!</p><p><strong>Nero Bride:</strong><br> If you have any pride as my Master, show me you can claim that creature&#39;s crown!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Nero Bride:</strong><br> Sorry to make you wait! After seven attempts, a new sword is finally born!</p><p><strong>Nero Bride:</strong><br> I call it, Fervence Ardeo! I have made it into a blazing holy fountain based on this great cavern!</p><p><strong>Nero Bride:</strong><br> Come on. Don&#39;t be bashful! Take a good look!<br> You can come closer. Come closer!</p><p><strong>Nero Bride:</strong><br> Right here. Look closely at the handle.<br> See how our names are so beautifully engraved?</p><p><strong>Nero Bride:</strong><br> Hee hee. Don&#39;t be so embarrassed, or I&#39;ll get embarrassed too! Now you really can&#39;t help but be crazy about me!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Yep, you&#39;re right.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I keep telling you I&#39;m already crazy about you!</p><hr><p><strong>Nero Bride:</strong><br> U-umu... An excellent response, Master!<br> Now, let us head to a new battlefield!</p><p><strong>Nero Bride:</strong><br> I can wait no longer to show off the power of my new blade!</p>', 115);
