Have you experienced that?</p><p><strong>B\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Do not answer. There is no need for you to.</p><p><strong>B\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Peer inside your heart. Do not turn your eyes from what you see. For that is what every heart holds. None can escape it.</p><p><strong>B\uFF1A???:</strong><br> It is what leads us to covet and begrudge one another, then shed tears of regret.</p><p><strong>B\uFF1A???:</strong><br> The sin of envy.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Senpai?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Um, is something the matter?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Why do you ask?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Oh, it&#39;s just...

No, it&#39;s all right. Don&#39;t speak. I don&#39;t actually wish to hear your opinions.</p><p><strong>B\uFF1A???:</strong><br> It was but an automatic reflex of hospitality.

A part of a tale that you should know quite well.

You are not Christine!</p><p><strong>Phantom:</strong><br> Here, my soul and my voice are bound up as one!<br> Which is to say...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> He&#39;s attacking me now?!</p><p><strong>B\uFF1AAvenger:</strong><br> Of course he is!<br> I already told you he was a monster that would kill you!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Could it be due to a Mental Corruption skill?</p><p><strong>B\uFF1AAvenger:</strong><br> No, not at all! Hahaha! Try listening for a change!<br> He has dominion over this room, and is here to kill you!</p><p><strong>Phantom:</strong><br> Look not upon my face! Look not! Look not!<br> You are not Christine, so I cannot bear it!</p><p><strong>Phantom:</strong><br> Whoever you may be,<br> I... I...cannot let you live.</p><p><strong>Phantom:</strong><br> Oh, Christine! My love!<br> Oh, Christine! My masterpiece!</p><p><strong>Phantom:</strong><br> Let me dig my nails into a voice the equal of yours! Let me rip apart a throat the equal of yours and see it gush red!</p><p><strong>Phantom:</strong><br> How I want... And want... And want... I am inconsolable tonight.</p><p><strong>Phantom:</strong><br> ...Oh, how I envy all people, near and far!</p><p><strong>B\uFF1AAvenger:</strong><br> Take a good look, Master. This is man. This is a caricature of the human beings your world is overrun with!</p><p><strong>B\uFF1AAvenger:</strong><br> Fight. Kill. You don&#39;t have time to hesitate. Because\u2014</p><p><strong>B\uFF1AAvenger:</strong><br> It makes no difference whether you believe me or not. There&#39;ll be no reasoning with him. He will kill you!</p><p><strong>B\uFF1AAvenger:</strong><br> Hahaha! Look! Just look! He can barely contain how badly he wants to add your throat to his collection!</p><p><strong>Phantom:</strong><br> Sing! Sing, my angel! Tonight, there&#39;s no song better than your dying scream!</p><p><strong>B\uFF1AAvenger:</strong><br> What will you do? Only defend yourself?<br> Or will you fight?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...I&#39;ll defend myself.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> ...I&#39;ll fight.</p><p><strong>B\uFF1AAvenger:</strong><br> Then take my hand! We will show this black-haired masked demon a true dance of death!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Avenger:</strong><br> How fragile! How fragile! You poor thing, all you can become is naught but an ugly monster!</p><p><strong>Avenger:</strong><br> Ch\xE2teau d&#39;If is not the place for your soul!<br> You are far too pitiful to be a murderer!</p><p><strong>Phantom:</strong><br> From the end of time... I see a light...<br> Does it open...an emotionless hole in my heart?</p><p><strong>Phantom:</strong><br> Oh, my heart... Where are you?<br> Oh, my love... Where are you?</p><p><strong>Phantom:</strong><br> Christine... I offer my heart to you...<br> Christine... I offer my love...to you...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You&#39;re singing of love, huh?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> What a sad song...</p><p><strong>Avenger:</strong><br> Are you certain? Listen carefully.<br> That is the other song that black-haired murderer sings.</p><p><strong>Avenger:</strong><br> My vengeful strike has shattered his Spirit Core and he has little time left, but his song will last till the very end.</p><p><strong>Phantom:</strong><br> Christine... My love... I love you, but... Christine... I simply cannot endure...</p><p><strong>Phantom:</strong><br> Noble Christine... The people who live with you... Beloved Christine... Everything in your world...</p><p><strong>Phantom:</strong><br> The people who spend time with you... The world where the morning sun rises... I...

Hahahahahaha!<br> Hahahahahahaha!</p><p><strong>Avenger:</strong><br> Phantom of the Opera, I have witnessed your envy.<br> I have killed you, and I shall carry your ugliness in my heart and move onward!</p><p><strong>Avenger:</strong><br> Be proud in hell.<br> For you are a true human.</p><p><strong>Phantom:</strong><br> ...Please, be careful.<br> Fujimaru, my Christine.</p><p><strong>Phantom:</strong><br> There is only one who will protect you in this twisted Ch\xE2teau d&#39;If.</p><p><strong>Phantom:</strong><br> And that one may not necessarily be good.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> What do you mean?</p><p><strong>Phantom:</strong><br> I&#39;m sorry, Christine, my love.<br> I can say no more.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Weren&#39;t you just killed?</p><p><strong>Phantom:</strong><br> I was indeed slain in the Hall of Judgment.<br> But what died was my ultimate ugliness.</p><p><strong>Phantom:</strong><br> However, we never...</p><p><strong>Avenger:</strong><br> Hahahahahah!

Me! An Extra Class, an Avenger, no less!</p><p><strong>Avenger:</strong><br> Now, on to the second Hall of Judgment!<br> Six more Lords await!</p><p><strong>Avenger:</strong><br> Roar like a tiger.<br> For you are allowed to do everything.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...Hold it.</p><p><strong>Avenger:</strong><br> ...Hmm?</p><p><strong>Avenger:</strong><br> Oh? Are you scared to go with me?<br> Are you uncertain you&#39;re walking the right path?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Can I really get out of here?</p><p><strong>Avenger:</strong><br> ...Heh.</p><p><strong>Avenger:</strong><br> Very well.

Yes, there are\u2014</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I figured this was coming.</p><p><strong>Avenger:</strong><br> Very perceptive.<br> No, I suppose it&#39;s to be expected.</p><p><strong>Avenger:</strong><br> The one who remains shall become the new Abb\xE9 Faria.</p><p><strong>Avenger:</strong><br> They will end their life as one who shatters despair and guides towards hope. It&#39;s a meaningful way to end one&#39;s life.</p><p><strong>Avenger:</strong><br> You, or me.<br> One of us will survive and one of us will die.</p><p><strong>Avenger:</strong><br> \u2014Come, my temporary Master.

I&#39;ll make you a second Abb\xE9 Faria, and live.</p><p><strong>Avenger:</strong><br> Your story will end. It&#39;s that simple.</p><p><strong>Avenger:</strong><br> Let us end this. In the last act of the play, your soul shall truly die.</p><p><strong>Avenger:</strong><br> But if...</p><p><strong>Avenger:</strong><br> If you say you will continue!<br> If you have not yet lost hope!</p><p><strong>Avenger:</strong><br> \u2014Then slay me!</p><p><strong>Avenger:</strong><br> To me belongeth Vengeance!

You have guided me to victory\u2014</p><p><strong>B\uFF1AAvenger:</strong><br> You don&#39;t understand?<br> ...Yes, I&#39;m sure.</p><p><strong>B\uFF1AAvenger:</strong><br> I knew naught of victory.<br> Even as I found my place in history as an Avenger...</p><p><strong>B\uFF1AAvenger:</strong><br> Because Edmond was saved at the end...</p><p><strong>B\uFF1AAvenger:</strong><br> I, the one who failed to taste victory and achieve his revenge, continued to exist.</p><p><strong>B\uFF1AAvenger:</strong><br> But...you, Fujimaru. I guided you to victory, and you overcame the obstacles and escaped the prison tower.</p><p><strong>B\uFF1AAvenger:</strong><br> What an ending...<br> ...filled with hope.</p><p><strong>B\uFF1AAvenger:</strong><br> I was without victory, and you allowed me to guide you, and earn that victory.</p><p><strong>B\uFF1AAvenger:</strong><br> You&#39;re so generous\u2014Haha, Fujimaru!</p><p><strong>B\uFF1AAvenger:</strong><br> \u201CWe\u201D have won!

You may speak of the King of Mages, but do not use his True Name carelessly.</p><p><strong>B\uFF1AAvenger:</strong><br> That name has become a curse. Just saying it aloud is enough to place that curse on you.</p><p><strong>B\uFF1AAvenger:</strong><br> That is how you came to be in this hell.</p><p><strong>B\uFF1AAvenger:</strong><br> You stared into his eyes in London, did you not?<br> That was enough for him.</p><p><strong>B\uFF1AAvenger:</strong><br> It&#39;s called the Evil Eye.<br> You were given a fatal poison then.</p><p><strong>B\uFF1AAvenger:</strong><br> He didn&#39;t let you go.<br> He decided that you were already finished.</p><p><strong>B\uFF1AAvenger:</strong><br> But\u2014Haha!

Keep struggling! You have been released...from this prison of the soul!</p><p><strong>B\uFF1AAvenger:</strong><br> Someday you shall save the world!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Will you disappear forever?</p><p><strong>B\uFF1AAvenger:</strong><br> ...You would wish to meet me, an Avenger, once more?</p><p><strong>B\uFF1AAvenger:</strong><br> Hahaha!
