As a Santa, her dreams and ideals of being merry and scattering smiles has resulted in her heart of ice, as if it was permafrost, being removed. Nonetheless, there are no changes in her Spartan doctrines, that being unaffected and sincere. She runs about for the sake of giving presents to good children, and although she gives punishments to bad children, she throws presents to them later on after they become good children.</p><h2 id="attitude-towards-master" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#attitude-towards-master" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Attitude Towards Master</h2><p>Santa Alter gathers unconditional trust in the Master and tells them of an aspiration, of playing an active role as Santa together. The thickness of that trust is an important part, and yet, extremely harsh\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014to the extent that the Master is entrusted the role of reindeer, the central part of Llamrei II. And it goes without saying that the Master chosen as her reindeer will be anticipating heavy labour extending over a period of one week. Although Alter is greatly pleased with herself as a Santa, there is absolutely no need for the Master to interrupt that mood. Because there is no need to speak well of her as a Santa. If one says something the likes of \u201CYou\u2019re an excellent Miss Santa, aren\u2019t you?\u201D to sympathize with her success, one will think that it might be the day the sleigh rises to the stratosphere.</p><h2 id="dialogue-examples" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#dialogue-examples" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Dialogue Examples</h2><p>\u201CMerry, excuse me for entering from the chimney.

Well, when I was trying to get into her design, a design that gets through the words called \u201CSanta Alter\u201D could not easily come into sight, and that proved to be very difficult. Concerning the result, I am thinking, \u2018I wonder if I came to indicate in one way or another a \u201CMs. Santa who differs from the usual\u201D that I aimed for in the beginning.\u2019 (Takeuchi Takashi)</p><h2 id="material-images" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#material-images" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Material Images</h2><p><img src="https://github.com/Assets-I/Materials/blob/main/fgo-material-II/i-314.jpg?raw=true" alt=""></p><p><img src="https://github.com/Assets-I/Materials/blob/main/fgo-material-II/i-315.jpg?raw=true" alt=""></p><p><img src="https://github.com/Assets-I/Materials/blob/main/fgo-material-II/i-316.jpg?raw=true" alt=""></p><p><img src="https://github.com/Assets-I/Materials/blob/main/fgo-material-II/i-317.jpg?raw=true" alt=""></p><p><img src="https://github.com/Assets-I/Materials/blob/main/fgo-material-II/i-318.jpg?raw=true" alt=""></p><p><img src="https://github.com/Assets-I/Materials/blob/main/fgo-material-II/i-319.jpg?raw=true" alt=""></p><h2 id="dialogue" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#dialogue" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Dialogue</h2><table><thead><tr><th style="text-align:left;">Occassion</th><th style="text-align:center;">English</th><th style="text-align:center;">Japanese</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style="text-align:left;">Summoned</td><td style="text-align:center;"></td><td style="text-align:center;"></td></tr></tbody></table>', 61);
