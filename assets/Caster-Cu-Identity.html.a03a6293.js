It\u2019s not a private account, the name being used was Moro, and it was only discovered because he was tweeting information and behind-the-scenes stories about a Servant that was going to be strengthened, which only those involved should know about. This account has now been deleted. However, it was clear he was on Twitter based on his behaviour.

In the case that he truly materializes as the hero Cu Chulainn, he will no longer possess this Skill, but instead will possess the Noble Phantasm Gae Bolg.</p><p><strong>(In other words, a situation where the materialized hero Cu Chulainn does not possess either this Skill or the Noble Phantasm Gae Bolg\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014should be essentially impossible.)</strong></p></div><p>Setanta was implemented in FGOAC.
