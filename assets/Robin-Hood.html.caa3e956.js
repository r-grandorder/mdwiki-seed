He held no love for the villagers, yet he did not hate them so much that he would abandon them.</p><p>Rather than death in sacrifice for honor and ideal, he thinks that it is better to simply respect life, survive, and left behind a warm result.</p><p>But he did not manage to obtain such a life; and so he shrugged his shoulder as he thought that \u201Cthose sort of things ain\u2019t more than pipe dreams\u201D.</p><p>His speaks in a way that does not tackle things in sincerity, and due to his principle to let sleeping dogs lie and an \u201Cis that so?\u201D sort of attitude towards everything, people tend to hate him from when he had been alive. And yet at his core, he likes humans. In a cheery gathering, he would join them nearby, eventually settling down as someone not quite friend yet not a stranger as well.</p><p>A frivolous and sarcastic man with a sharp tongue to boot, but at his root he is a man of virtue. Due to him being somewhat timid and concealing his immature fixation on justice, his behavior comes off as insincere. He has a complex in regards of the guilt and shame of his own lowly way of life and way of fighting; but due to that, ridiculing other people\u2019s endeavour and futile effort is the one thing he would never do.</p><h2 id="attitude-towards-master" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#attitude-towards-master" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Attitude Towards Master</h2><p>He hides his true nature from when he was alive and fights with cowardly means such as using trap, tricks, and surprise attacks; due to that, his compatibility with Masters that prefers a fair and square battle is bad.</p><p>In the Holy Grail War of the moon, there had been a discrepancy of combat policy between the Master that wishes for battles that conform with chivalrous ideals who had summoned him and Robin Hood himself who dislikes such upright battles. However, while seeming to think that he too wish for such a battle that his Master desires, he made best use of the Archer Class\u2019 special characteristic of the Independent Action Skill and assiduously working from the shadow where his Master would not see him. That too, sounds tiresome.</p><p>He is a man who, while not having the stock of a hero and bragging that he would simply do what he wants to do, ends up acting as a hero anyway and reached the Throne of Heroes.</p><h2 id="dialogue-examples" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#dialogue-examples" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Dialogue Examples</h2><p>\u201CPride, eh.

The original Robin Hood was a chivalrous thief who had resided in the Sherwood Forest and opposed the tyrant John Lackland, but died out of excessive bleeding due to the scheme of a prioress of Kirkless.</p><p>His true nature is the imaginary chivalrous thief, the result of Orion of Greek mythology and the fairy (Robin) of Celtic legend combined with the druidic faith. He is the faceless hero born out of the prayer of the people of England, which had been repeatedly invaded by foreign countries. And although there was a figure who had served as the base, Robin Hood appears to be an existence which came to be from the amalgamation of many others.</p><p>This Robin Hood, too, is no more than one of the \u201Cnumerous Robin Hood\u201D. Originally a burden to the village, he had been a youth without a single relative living in the outskirt of the village yet due to the unexpected he ended up concealing his true nature and fighting the army of the feudal lord; during the course, he became known as the \u201CGreen Man\u201D.</p><p>He was not able to abandon the village suffering under the feudal lord\u2019s tyrannical rule; at first, he had only able to save them and repel the feudal lord\u2019s army by chance, but from the second time on he started fighting hard while bearing the hopes and wishes of the villagers on his back.</p><p>Setting traps in the forest and covering his face with a hood all the time, not even the villagers were privy of his origin. He is one of the nameless heroes, throwing away his identity as a human for the sake of justice.</p><p>But the villagers, for the sake of self-protection, conveyed to the feudal lord that in no way was he related to them; they pushed all the responsibilities to him and turning him into a common enemy, yet still he continues to fight. However, in just short of two years he had died after being shot by an assassin. Receiving such a death without any reward, he was then turned into a Heroic Spirit as Robin Hood.</p><h2 id="character-in-fgo" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#character-in-fgo" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Character in FGO</h2><p>In the fifth chapter, \u201CNorth America\u2019s Mythological Great War E Pluribus Unum\u201D, he makes an appearance by opposing both the Celtic army and the federal army as one member of the resistance. His partner is his fellow outlaw, Billy the Kid.</p><p>Even casted away from the nation known as United State of America, Geronimo, an original inhabitant of the land loves it still. One can say that the outsider Robin Hood joining force with Geronimo in fighting the army of the ruler of the land is an inevitable outcome.</p><h2 id="depiction-in-previous-works" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#depiction-in-previous-works" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Depiction in previous works</h2><p>He appears in Fate/EXTRA. His Master is Dan Blackmoore. He abides by his Master\u2019s instruction unwillingly, but not out of antipathy; it is that he is disconcerted with his Master\u2019s humane righteousness. Due to his Master, who values the spirit of chivalry, simply would not hear of his forte of smoke-and-mirror sort of methods, before long he made the expression of \u201CI got involved with another pain in the neck, geez.\u201D In Fate/EXTRA CCC, too, he ends up as the subordinate of the exasperating mastermind.
