How has everything been going since Fujimaru summoned you?</p><p><strong>Vishnu:</strong><br> Is there anything you feel is missing,<br> or do you have any immediate concerns?</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> No, Master is always kind to me.</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> Master treats me not as a king,<br> not as [\u2642 his /\u2640\uFE0F her] retainer, but as a friend.</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> I have not had any complaints since I have been summoned.</p><p><strong>Vishnu:</strong><br> ...I see. That was a quick response.<br> How about during battle?</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> Hahaha. I&#39;m all good on the fighting front!<br> I would love to show you my power, Vishnu!</p><p><strong>Vishnu:</strong><br> Oh, really? Is that so? That&#39;s some big talk.<br> I never took you for the type to talk that way.</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> Eh?<br> V-Vishnu...?</p><p><strong>Vishnu:</strong><br> Rama...<br> Oh, Rama...</p><p><strong>Vishnu:</strong><br> Think back, Rama. Back to when you manifested as a Servant, to when you were given your Noble Phantasm...</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> Eh? Are you talking about another, different Noble Phantasm than my Brahmastra...?</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> Vishnu Baazoo, the Arm of the Great One...oh!</p><p><strong>Vishnu:</strong><br> Rama...<br> Oh, Rama...</p><p><strong>Vishnu:</strong><br> You! Have! Forgotten! The Noble Phantasm!<br> With! My! Name! You! Forgot! You can&#39;t use it!!!</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> Gyaaaaaahhh!!!<br> I-I-I-I&#39;m terribly sorry, great Vishnu!</p><p><strong>Vishnu:</strong><br> Well, that won&#39;t do, will it?<br> What&#39;s the deal, Rama?</p><p><strong>Vishnu:</strong><br> Did you really not realize until I just reminded you that your Noble Phantasm was sealed!? What have you got between your ears!? Marshmallows!?</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> A-absolutely not! I d-didn&#39;t forget It&#39;s just... W-well, um, I&#39;ve never encountered any enemies strong enough to require using your power...</p><p><strong>Vishnu:</strong><br> Oh-ho. I suppose I shouldn&#39;t be surprised, knowing your power. But then, I suppose you must not have any use for this Noble Phantasm, either.</p><p><strong>Vishnu:</strong><br> Even without your Brahmastra, you&#39;ll be fine.</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> But...!<br> P-please do not go, great Vishnu!</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> I...I was mistaken!<br> Please, at least leave me my Brahmastra!</p><p><strong>Vishnu:</strong><br> ...Very well. If you&#39;re that desperate,<br> I shall give you a chance.</p><p><strong>Vishnu:</strong><br> However, understand that to succeed, you must repeatedly shout my favorite word.</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> Y-yes! Certainly and swiftly!</p><p><strong>Vishnu:</strong><br> Very well. That is the lifestyle that you must always be mindful of. They say that swiftness and decisiveness are most important to a soldier.</p><p><strong>Vishnu:</strong><br> Now, then. I have somewhere for you to travel with your Master. There, you will find the trial I have set for you.</p><p><strong>Vishnu:</strong><br> Know this: should you fail in this trial...you will no longer receive my blessing.</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> You can count on me!</p><p><strong>Vishnu:</strong><br> You must always mind me, and never again forget me... Use your Noble Phantasm properly (...erly...erly...)</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> ...And that was my dream.<br> Please, Master, you gotta help me! Mash, you too!!!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Well, in that case...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Do gods really act like that?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Th-that sounds suspicious...</p><hr><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> Hm. Well, actually... The being I spoke to was both the great Vishnu, and not Vishnu at the same time.</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> It&#39;s the Vishnu that I envision, since I&#39;ve never really MET them personally!</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> Besides, the great Vishnu who appears in my dreams doesn&#39;t seem to have a fully formed personality and is maybe a bit wacky.</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> But this much I&#39;m certain of: I receive a message from the great Vishnu whenever I lose my way or forget something.</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> It could be my subconscious trying to make me realize that I had unknowingly blinded myself to something...</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> Or perhaps the real great Vishnu is truly sending me a message... I&#39;m honestly not sure.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> So, you have no clue.</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> Pretty much!</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> Regardless, I&#39;m sure there is some truth to the notion that something is about to happen to me!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> True...there may be some truth in Rama&#39;s dream.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Doctor, what do you mean?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> A few hours ago, a minute Singularity formed, and we detected it in America, on the island of Alcatraz.</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> Alcatraz, huh?</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> That&#39;s where Sita was...<br> That place must have something to do with my dream.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> With the Sixth and Seventh Singularities remaining, leaving it alone could endanger humanity.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Let&#39;s take care of it. Swiftly.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Roger that, Doctor.</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> Obviously, you&#39;ll take me with you, right?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Of course!</p><hr><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> Ah, my friend!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> What is it, Fou?<br> You&#39;re saying it&#39;s a friendship of self-interest?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That can&#39;t be true, Fou.<br> Right, Master?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I hope not.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Friendship must be true.</p><hr><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> A-anyway, let&#39;s get a move on, quickly!<br> Our trial awaits...probably!</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> A trial, huh? Now that I reflect back,<br> it seems like my life was full of them.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> According to the Ramayana, Rama was first exiled from his homeland when he was a prince.</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> Indeed.</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> My stepmother Kaikeyi suspected that I would treat her unfairly if I became king.</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> Most conspiracies have their genesis in tiny doubts.<br> I count myself lucky that I wasn&#39;t killed, at least.</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> Luckily, my younger brother Lakshmana also came with me. It felt like I was heading out on a long journey rather than getting exiled.</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> And above all, since I had Sita with me, my exile wasn&#39;t so bad.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> And if I remember correctly, Bharata, who was supposed to be king, refused to ascend the throne, and waited for you.</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> Yes. I was fortunate in all respects. I must admit that the fun was confined to the beginning of my journey, though.</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> Everything went downhill after Sita was taken.<br> Hey, Master...</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> You fight all your battles to restore humanity. I have no hesitation offering my life for that purpose.</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> However, had I been summoned for a proper Holy Grail War, I may have wished for the following:</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> To change the past.<br> To undo the past where Sita was taken from me.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Rama...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> It&#39;s true that a normal Holy Grail War might be able to grant that wish.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> But it could create various distortions. For example, Sita may not have been taken, but the curse may still be there...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Or perhaps, in consequence of your group being saved, your homeland may have met a different fate.</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> ...Distortion, huh? I suppose that&#39;s what happens when things are changed.</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> In any case, that&#39;s all hypothetical.<br> Let&#39;s concentrate on the matter at hand.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> We&#39;ve arrived at the coast.<br> This was where we headed to Alcatraz by boat.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It feels so long ago.<br> I wonder if the old man we met back then is well.</p><p><strong>F\uFF1A???:</strong><br> I hear he is in good health. But I had him evacuate, because this place is about to become a battlefield.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> !</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> A hero sent to test me!</p><p><strong>F\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Indeed.</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> I am King Rama of Kosala!<br> Hero that I must overcome, please show yourself!</p><p><strong>F\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Understood.<br> I did have every intention of doing so eventually...</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> ...!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It can&#39;t be... Karna?!</p><p><strong>Karna:</strong><br> I am your first trial. I shall demonstrate a piercing stare...<br> I mean, the proper bearing of a hero.</p><p><strong>Karna:</strong><br> A real hero kills with his eyes.<br> King of Kosala, receive my Brahmastra!</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> Got it. If you&#39;re my first opponent, then I have no complaints!</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> I will push my power to its limit!<br> Let&#39;s do this, Master!!!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Karna:</strong><br> ...Splendid. This is the end.<br> I have seen enough of your indestructible blade.</p><p><strong>Karna:</strong><br> I wish I could emulate the valiant, and yet disarmingly honest moves that you retain as a result of being summoned as an inexperienced hero.</p><p><strong>Karna:</strong><br> Move on to the second trial, but proceed with caution.<br> It may not be as easy as this one.</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> Thank you, Lord Karna. It was an honor to cross blades with a famed hero like you.</p><p><strong>Karna:</strong><br> Compared to the hero awaiting you at the second trial,<br> I was but a trifling opponent. Go, board the boat.</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> A hero that Karna thinks makes him seem insignificant...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Do you think he&#39;s being humble?<br> Karna is quite modest...</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> I hope that&#39;s all it is. These are, after all,<br> heroes gathered specifically for this trial...</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> Which means the next hero is...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Master, watch out!</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> An arrow!<br> So, we&#39;re looking for an Archer!</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong><br> You are correct. I am the gatekeeper for this second trial...</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Rest assured, I will not allow my personal feelings to interfere with this trial.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong><br> No matter what happened in the past, even if I was on your side...please do not think too much of it.</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> Now we&#39;re up against Arjuna...!</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> Now, show me this indestructible blade of yours.<br> I will judge whether you are worthy of wielding it!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> ...Well, it seems you pass.<br> Something is still missing, but that&#39;s hardly a surprise.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> Of course, any Heroic Spirit would find himself lacking when standing in comparison to me.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> Don&#39;t you agree?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Well you&#39;re not...not entirely...not incorrect...?</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> Puzzling...which is it!?<br> Do you believe it&#39;s true, or not?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Nope.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> ...Really.<br> Then shall we battle once more?</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> Waitwaitwait!<br> I&#39;ll have you declare that I&#39;ve overcome my trial!</p><hr><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> Ah. That may have been somewhat childish of me.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> Rama. You are quite perplexing.<br> You overcame so many trials in your lifetime.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> And, in doing so, you became a full and complete hero.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> Had you not been summoned as your youthful self,<br> these trials now would be unnecessary.</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> You may be right.</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> It&#39;s possible that I could be summoned as an older king, one who would remember Sita, but had also come to terms with what happened to her.</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> Had that version of me been more compatible with Master, it might have been summoned...</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> But it appears that this form was best suited to my Master.</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> And knowing that makes me happy.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> Hm. How heartwarming.<br> I mean...ahem.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> That is precisely why one must grow stronger.<br> Even Servants.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> That is the purpose of this trial.<br> Grow stronger, Lord Rama.</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> ...Okay.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> I shall bid you farewell.<br> The final hero awaits you.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> ...He will be your greatest challenge of all.<br> He is not one to hold back.</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> A hero who doesn&#39;t hold back...<br> I wonder who could that be?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It should be all right. Karna and Arjuna were both great and famous heroes.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> And you defeated both of them, Rama.<br> You should have more confidence as you go forward.</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> ...Yeah, you&#39;re right.<br> Okay, I&#39;m ready for anyone!</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> No matter who the opponent, I&#39;ll squash them!</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong><br> ...Oh? What&#39;s this?<br> It seems a yammering mongrel approaches.</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> Wha...!?</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Nothing to be surprised about.<br> You summoned me here.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> I am Gilgamesh, King of Heroes,<br> and I crush you underfoot.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Battle with Sabers\u2013any Saber\u2013never fails to excite me.</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> Ugh...Gilgamesh!!!<br> They always save the greatest challenge for last...</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Fuhahaha! Do you think this trial is just about going up against a tough opponent!? Wrong!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> The true trial isn&#39;t just a matter of defeating me. As if a mongrel like you could ever defeat the likes of me!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> (Nice to see he&#39;s still completely full of himself...)</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> One who still needs to prove his strength through battle will be of no use in the Restoration of Humanity.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> So show yourself!</p><p><strong>Sita:</strong><br> Rama...<br> Lord Rama, is that you?</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> That voice...<br> It can&#39;t be. Sita!?</p><p><strong>Sita:</strong><br> Yes, it is I.</p><p><strong>Sita:</strong><br> It seems the great Vishnu arranged for me to be summoned on this land once again.</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> I&#39;m so glad...!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Hahahaha. Excited, are you not, King of Kosala?<br> Why do you think your wife is on my side?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> She&#39;s a hostage...?</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Fool! What use would I, who is sure to be the victor here, have for a hostage!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> She&#39;s our enemy...?</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Exactly.<br> Your final trial is a trial of love.</p><hr><p><strong>Sita:</strong><br> Lord Rama...<br> The great Vishnu has lifted our curse.</p><p><strong>Sita:</strong><br> We can be together now...forever.</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> What...!?</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> Th-that is most generous of Vishnu...<br> I&#39;m grateful, sincerely...</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> But Sita, why are you on his side?</p><p><strong>Sita:</strong><br> The great Vishnu was kind enough not only to lift our curse, but also to grant my wish...</p><p><strong>Sita:</strong><br> I wished that my Lord Rama would never be hurt...would be spared these endless battles.</p><p><strong>Sita:</strong><br> Please, join us, Lord Rama.<br> Leave the Restoration of Humanity to the others.</p><p><strong>Sita:</strong><br> If there are as many heroes as stars in the sky, what is one fewer? We should be able to have our peace, to have our happiness...</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> Are you saying, that I can be with you as long as I break my contract with Master?</p><p><strong>Sita:</strong><br> Yes, it is I.</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> Then I know that you are a fake.</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> I could never deserve such a reward without overcoming my trials.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Oh?</p><p><strong>Sita:</strong><br> If you&#39;re calling me a fake,<br> then the same must be true of you...</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> This is not about being a Servant or Heroic Spirit.</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> First of all, you&#39;re not even a Servant.</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> ...Yeah, I know... I understand, and I know this is an offer I must refuse.</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> But...well...you know...Master...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I get it.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Are you all right?</p><hr><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> Rejecting loved ones is so hard.</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> How, in my past life...even if it was to avoid unnecessary bloodshed...</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> How did I manage to go through with this?</p><p><strong>Sita:</strong><br> ...I see. So you mean to reject me.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> (Even though his rank as a Heroic Spirit is far beneath mine, he does not waver in his beliefs. Impertinent mongrel.)</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> I can&#39;t do it, Sita.<br> That is the one thing I cannot do.</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> To break my contract with Master would mean doing the same thing I did to you, Sita.</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> I know I&#39;m not supposed to let go this time.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Heh. What will you do, queen?<br> You heard what your husband said.</p><p><strong>Sita:</strong><br> If he rejects my love, then the only thing left to do is to devour him...! That&#39;s my only option!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> ...What?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Um, does it look like Gilgamesh is also surprised?</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Fuhahahaha! Why, humanity&#39;s on the brink of collapse. This sort of strangeness is to be expected.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Now, small king of a smaller nation. It is time for you to face your final trial: this monster...and me!</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> Yeah, let&#39;s do this!</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> Brahmastra!<br> Shine...like you did back then!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> ...Hmph.<br> Battle&#39;s over.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> You may be bleeding from a hundred wounds,<br> but your trial is over.</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> (Pant...pant...pant...)</p><p><strong>Sita:</strong><br> Rama...<br> My dear Rama...</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> ...Next time...we meet...I&#39;ll go...see you...I&#39;ll be sure to walk tall and proud...</p><p><strong>Sita:</strong><br> ...Okay...</p><p><strong>Sita:</strong><br> If you tell the real Sita...she&#39;ll likely...</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Sheesh. I heard somewhere that even Lancers (better known as dogs) prefer to stay out of lovers&#39; spats.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Lancers...?</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> You had to be there.<br> Anyway, this is the end of your trial.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Young king of a small nation, it&#39;s all right to agonize over this kind of thing, but not in public. Understand?</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> Trials...</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> This might have been for the best.<br> This body and psyche of mine are both still immature.</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> A fake Sita agitating me so much proves that.</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> But hear me out, Master: I will show you my strength in overcoming adversity.</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> And if that helps me grow stronger to protect you and Sita...that just means I&#39;m going in the right direction.</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> Now, Master, our journey to restore humanity continues.</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> Let&#39;s go!</p>', 246);
