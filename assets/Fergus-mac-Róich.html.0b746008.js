Is this it?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> We&#39;re closed today...</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong><br> Hm, just as I thought.<br> But I&#39;m begging you. It&#39;s urgent, you see.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Yes and no?</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong><br> Hah hah hah. You deny and say it isn&#39;t so, but your face tells me you&#39;ve given up on refusing, Master!</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong><br> You&#39;re probably fed up with indulging the selfishness of Servants day after day. I sympathize with you.</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong><br> So now, I&#39;d like you to just give up again. I&#39;ve got an urgent problem.</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong><br> Could you hear me out?</p><hr><p><strong>Fergus:</strong><br> Hah hah hah, don&#39;t be so shy!</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong><br> War is important, but whispering words of love to a woman is equally important to me.</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong><br> Of course, I&#39;d never force myself on an unwilling woman. Understand that I just want to look at her and hit on her.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Senpai, Senpai!<br> I found sweet rice cakes in the Doctor&#39;s room!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> These are quite exceptional.<br> Let&#39;s eat them before anyone finds out.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> But of course, the main topic is investigating the Doctor.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> We must solve the mystery of how the Doctor stockpiles sweets in this time of scarcity...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Oh? Is that you, Fergus?</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong><br> Oh, hello Mash.<br> Well, I want to ask you, too.</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong><br> You see...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I understand the circumstances,<br> but maybe that&#39;s not such a good idea.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I mean, we are fighting to prevent humanity&#39;s destruction...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> If you carelessly start hitting on other Servants, it may end in a bloodbath...</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong><br> Hmm, what a mess...</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong><br> If at least I could tell which Servants are okay to hit on...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Heh, leave stuff like that to me.<br> More like, why didn&#39;t you come see me about this?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Hey, those sweet rice cakes look pretty tasty.<br> Let me try one, nom nom...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Oh, this is as tasty as the one from my own collection,<br> or rather, it tastes exactly the same...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Senpai&#39;s sweet rice cake!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Mash&#39;s sweet rice cake!</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> You two get along so well.<br> That aside, Fergus.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I installed several Servant profiles into the virtual training system.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> They&#39;re a bit robotic, but they should at least respond to you.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> So try this out first, and if it looks good, you can go hit on them for real. How does that sound?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> It will be good for future reference.<br> I&#39;ll use the results for personal reference.</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong><br> Hmm... An interesting proposal.<br> Let&#39;s give it a shot!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Senpai, Senpai. I&#39;m not sure why, but I have a bad feeling about this.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou, foou...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Okay, transfer confirmed.<br> Why don&#39;t you try sweet-talking the first one?</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong><br> All right, bring it on!<br> Now, what kind of perky lass will appear\u2013</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Uhh.<br> What&#39;s a \u201Cperky lass,\u201D exactly, Senpai?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Maybe a beauty that makes his crotch perk up?<br> Oh, here she comes!</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong><br> Well, if it isn&#39;t Brynhild, the Valkyrie!<br> ...Hey, wait, wait, wait!</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong><br> Don&#39;t you already have a boyfriend?<br> I&#39;m not a fan of stealing another guy&#39;s woman...</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong><br> Hmm. Well, I don&#39;t like it, but exceptions must be made for lust.</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong><br> Brynhild. I want you.<br> Why don&#39;t you spend the night with me?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> (...A very straightforward and completely unambiguous approach...)</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong><br> Oh...I don&#39;t know how to respond to such a frank confession of love\u2013</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong><br> Hmmm.</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong><br> I guess I&#39;ll just have to kill you...</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong><br> Yup, I don&#39;t get why, but so be it!<br> You&#39;re even more ferocious in love than the Celts!</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong><br> I have no idea who you are, but thank you.<br> Now let us fight to the death...</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong><br> Fujimaru, Mash, my bad!<br> I was so close, but I failed!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> We can see that.<br> Oh geez, Master, get ready for battle!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That was quite the ordeal...</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong><br> Hah hah hah, if you get depressed by one or two failures, you&#39;re gonna have a tough life.</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong><br> After all, everything, even life, is just a night&#39;s dream. You&#39;ve got to live decisively.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> How reliable... You are a teacher, no,<br> I must say, a guru of smooth talkers...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> All right, Guru Fergus!<br> I will prepare the next Servant!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> This time it&#39;ll be fine. Based on looks,<br> I chose a charming, peaceful woman!</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Senpai, Senpai, I think he will strike out.</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong><br> I think so too, but I can&#39;t help it when met with such beauty! Hey there, foreign lady!</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> Ah, are you referring to me?<br> I beg your pardon. Do you need something?</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong><br> Yes. I liked you the moment I saw you.<br> How about it? Spending the night with me.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> Oh, my.<br> What shall I do...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Wait, he actually has a chance?</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong><br> Hahaha, no need to be shy.</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong><br> I don&#39;t mean to brag, but I, Fergus, am an acknowledged authority on how to make women happy\u2013</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> What did you just say?</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> An acknowledged authority on making women happy?<br> So, in other words\u2013you mean \u201Cinfidelity.\u201D</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong><br> ...Hmm. Hah hah hah!<br> My bad! It seems I&#39;ve stepped on a land mine, Master!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Guru Fergus\u2014!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> As I expected!<br> You keep stumbling at the first hurdle!</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> Destroy infidelity!<br> Destroy womanizers!</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> Go repent in hell!<br> Hi-yah!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong><br> Hmm, it&#39;s not going too well.<br> I hope this time a compatible Servant will show up.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Senpai, we should make a bet.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> MUDA MUDA MUDA.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I think it&#39;s no use.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes, I think so as well.</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong><br> Hah hah hah! Master, you&#39;re quite harsh.<br> However, rest assured. This is a tent, thus, the wild.</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong><br> Being here means it will most likely be a ferocious woman, a warrior!</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong><br> I know well how to woo such a woman. Well now, Doctor!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> An unshakable heart of steel...<br> That is our hero Fergus!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Honestly, I&#39;m starting to realize this is useless, so I want to go back to work... But I hope for the best this time!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> The Servant up next is\u2013her!</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> ...Huh?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Senpai, I think we should run.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> To the ends of the earth.</p><hr><p><strong>Fergus:</strong><br> Oooh, is this not the nurse that took care of us in America?</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> I only have business for the wounded. Please leave.</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong><br> Don&#39;t be so cold.<br> Actually... I have a serious illness.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> ...Let&#39;s hear it. What is wrong?</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong><br> Uh, it&#39;s like a gaping hole has opened in my chest...</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> Is it pneumothorax?<br> Or perhaps heart failure?</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong><br> Nothing like that, it&#39;s more of a mental problem. I&#39;ve got an emptiness from the lonely nights spent alone.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> ...Meaning?</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong><br> Yes, I refer to the disease of love...<br> My heart is unspeakably cold and empty!</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong><br> But, my beautiful lady with bosom so supple and buttocks so round!</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong><br> I do think you are capable of filling the gap in this chest. If you would, please!</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Nightingale, um, it&#39;s fine if you just flat out refuse him...</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> No. On the battlefield, it&#39;s just an unavoidable instinct for warriors to seek proof that they have lived.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> Assaulting helpless nurses is one thing.<br> But, if I am the one nominated, that&#39;s a different story.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Huh\u2013!?<br> S-So, that means!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> You&#39;re going to give him the okay!?</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> Yes.<br> I will respectfully counter his attack.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> After all, I am currently a nurse who possesses combat skills.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Oh, so that&#39;s what you meant!</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong><br> Hah hah hah hah! In other words, you mean if I win the battle, I can have you!</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong><br> Fine by me, I&#39;ll take you on!<br> Master, this will be a decisive battle... Let&#39;s go!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong><br> Yes, victory is mine!</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong><br> By the way my beautiful lady, is it my imagination,<br> or were all your attacks concentrated solely on me?</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> No, you&#39;re not imagining things.<br> ...Be that as it may, I will admit defeat.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> Do as you wish, Fujimaru.<br> My body is yours.</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong><br> Don&#39;t you mean mine!?</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> ?</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> The winner is not the Servant,<br> but the Master who commanded them, is it not?</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong><br> That logic is so sound I don&#39;t know what to say!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> N-Now wait just a minute!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Y-Yes!<br> It&#39;s not like Master fought with such an idea in mind!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Isn&#39;t that right, Master?<br> ISN&#39;T. THAT. RIGHT?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I&#39;m sorry, some other time!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Exactly!<br> Senpai is on a mission to save the world.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Getting sidetracked is, well...all sorts of danger, I think!</p><hr><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> I can&#39;t believe this... You&#39;re the winner, yet you don&#39;t want your prize.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> Well then, until next we meet.<br> Goodbye, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Whew... That was close.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Well, if you asked me what was so close,<br> I wouldn&#39;t know the answer myself...</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong><br> Hmm, so my last chance also ended in failure after all.<br> I can&#39;t help but feel my self-confidence dwindling.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Ah, um... Er, well. Whatever the reason, I think your straightforward courtship is wonderful.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Please don&#39;t be discouraged, and keep trying.</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong><br> Miss Mash. If you&#39;d like, after this\u2013</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Oh, that would be a no, thank you.</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong><br> Rejected...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Guru Fergus...</p>', 156);
