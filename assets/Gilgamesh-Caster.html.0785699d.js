What do you think, King Gilgamesh?</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Honestly, I&#39;m dumbfounded. Saying this is the group that will save humanity is a bold, bold claim.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Staff morale is at its absolute limit.<br> Is this meant to be some sort of endurance contest?</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Uruk was in better shape after being attacked by Gugalanna than this place is now.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Ah well, I suppose I will retract that. Forget it.<br> I cannot imagine you wanting to be compared to THAT.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> While I appreciate the wise king&#39;s thoughtful criticisms, please understand that we receive no outside help.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> We&#39;ve operated for an entire year with only Chaldea&#39;s own stockpile of supplies. I hope you&#39;ll take that into consideration. Besides...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...the difficult battles have almost come to an end. This next one is our last. We just have to keep going a little bit longer.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> That might be fine with you, but know that life goes on even after the King of Mages is defeated.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> It is the duty of the commander, who is responsible for the lives of so many others, to always be thinking of the future.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> If you cannot do that, then turn command over to that Heroic Spirit over there.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Oh, are you talking about me?<br> Oh, King Gilgamesh, how do you do?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> I&#39;m not really one of his defenders, but the acting director is doing a great job.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Chaldea could easily have been utterly destroyed when it lost its director.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> But Romani was the one who helped everyone back to their feet. Had I been at the helm, well...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> I may have gotten more impressive results, but we would likely have lost more people doing so.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Buuut, I do understand what Gilgamesh is getting at. Romani works too much.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Take some time to rest before our last mission. All jokes aside, the way you&#39;re going, you&#39;ll end up killing yourself from overwork.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That would be a grave situation indeed!<br> If the Doctor collapses on us now...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Doctors can&#39;t medically examine themselves...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Yeah, I guess there&#39;s that bit about practicing what you preach. Don&#39;t worry. I don&#39;t work THAT much.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I rest whenever I get tired,<br> and my staff backs me up. Don&#39;t worry.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> And we can&#39;t ask Ereshkigal for a favor...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> No. Since we&#39;re in Chaldea, even if his soul leaves his body, we can&#39;t ask Ereshkigal to send it back...</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Overwork, huh? I think I just felt a chill.<br> Not that such a concept has any meaning to me...</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Ah, but I suppose there&#39;s always a chance...<br> Best to be careful. You too, Romani.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> It&#39;ll be fine. I don&#39;t intend on collapsing anytime soon.<br> I&#39;ll pace myself.</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> You know, if I&#39;m being honest, King Gilgamesh taking a personal interest in my health is a little bit unnerving, really.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Does that mean...he considers me to be worthy?</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Fool. The number of humans I consider to be worthy must always remain very small.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> All I am saying is that you are Chaldea&#39;s Achilles&#39; heel. Keep that in mind.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> And if you cannot do something even that simple, then I have nothing else to say. I&#39;ll send you to the underworld myself.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> H-hey! He&#39;s unleashing his Noble Phantasm right here in the Command Room! Even when you get more mature, you&#39;re still alarmingly childish!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Now, now. Grow up, both of you.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Why don&#39;t you rest for today, since King Gilgamesh is insisting? Fortunately, there&#39;s nothing that needs your attention right now.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...(Sigh) I suppose. Well then, I suppose I&#39;ll rest after I check for Magi\u2606Mari updates...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> That&#39;s part of the problem!<br> Skip the distractions part!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Yes, yes. Fine, fine.<br> I&#39;ll go turn in for the night.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> ...That man&#39;s unbelievable. He cannot even manage something as simple as going to sleep.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Fine. I have an understanding of how Chaldea works, and now I shall rest. Don&#39;t bother me, mongrel.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> King Gilgamesh has gone back to his room.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> You did a good job showing him around today, Senpai. Will you also take a rest?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Dealing with him has me exhausted.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That&#39;s understandable.<br> He may not look like it, but he can be quite the handful.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> He had so many questions... \u201CWhat&#39;s that?\u201D \u201CHow do you use that?\u201D And on and on... Well, they weren&#39;t actually questions, but...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> It was almost more like a test, right? It&#39;s his way of seeing how much Fujimaru knows Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes. That&#39;s exactly what I thought he was trying to do.<br> I think he was actually enjoying himself, though.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> No wonder I&#39;m tired. I&#39;m gonna take a nap...</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Understood. I will wake you up for dinner.<br> Good night, Senpai.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Senpai, I&#39;m sorry for interrupting your rest, but something terrible has happened!<br> The Doctor... The Doctor...!!!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> He didn&#39;t collapse, did he?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> He didn&#39;t die from exhaustion, did he?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> No. One of the staff members went to the Doctor&#39;s room to give him something to look over...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...but since he didn&#39;t answer, and the door was open, they went into his room. He&#39;s nowhere to be found!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The Doctor is not anywhere in Chaldea!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> You&#39;re late! How long were you planning on snoozing!? Well, I did just awaken, myself...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Shouldn&#39;t you be resting?</p><hr><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> You&#39;re four thousand years too young to be worrying about my welfare! Besides, any time spent not fighting the King of Mages is time spent resting to me!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> You just worry about the matter at hand. Leave worrying about the future to those with Clairvoyance.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Thank you.<br> So, King Gilgamesh...where is the Doctor!?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Alright. Let me give you a quick briefing.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> First, seven staff members mysteriously fell unconscious. The condition doesn&#39;t seem to be life-threatening, but we also can&#39;t seem to wake them.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> And...Romani has disappeared from Chaldea. We even tried looking in the tea room behind the storage room.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> ...What&#39;s that?<br> I was not shown this room. Well, no matter.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Are there any other clues, Da Vinci?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Apparently somebody Rayshifted to Fuyuki in 2004.<br> So, to Singularity F.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Oh? That place somehow sounds familiar.<br> Fuyuki... Fuyuki... It&#39;s similar to Uruk. No...that&#39;s not it.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> And? Is that all you know?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Those who collapsed were analysts.<br> That&#39;s all we know.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> If we piece together what we know so far, it looks like Romani somehow rendered these staff members unconscious...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> ...and then Rayshifted... At least,<br> that&#39;s what the facts seem to point to.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> (Dr. Roman had the aptitude to Rayshift?<br> We&#39;ve never really verified\u2013no, but even if he did...)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The Doctor is not the type of person to do something like this. Are there any other possibilities, Da Vinci?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> You say that, but the only other possible culprit would be me...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> But I&#39;m here, and there&#39;s no reason for me to Rayshift to Singularity F in the first place.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Strange things happen in Chaldea all the time. We need to respond swiftly even to the worst of scenarios.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> At times like this, I wish Holmes was here...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> At times like this, I bet Holmes is elsewhere...</p><hr><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> What&#39;s this about some detective?<br> Have you forgotten that I&#39;m here!?</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> I can solve something so trivial as this in a heartbeat.<br> You hear me? A heartbeat!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> However, even I can&#39;t see into the past.<br> We&#39;ll need to be more proactive.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> We must go to the scene of the crime ourselves,<br> Fujimaru!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Y-yes! I will make the preparations immediately!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> No, Mash. Not you. You&#39;re staying behind.<br> A Rayshift requires an operator, yes?</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> The usual operators are unconscious,<br> and so we shall need a replacement.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Luckily, we still have half of the operators.<br> Ask them to teach you, as their kouhai.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> ...It will probably be useful later.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That&#39;s... But someone must protect Master during Rayshift missions!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Did I not say I was going?<br> Or do you not trust in my strength?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I-I do!<br> There&#39;s no need to worry with King Gilgamesh there!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Good response.<br> It appears I will have to be careful.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Now, begin the Rayshift! We&#39;re going to head to the scene of the crime, Fujimaru!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Understood, Boss!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Leave the Doctor to me, Mash!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Rayshift successful. I&#39;m glad there was an instruction manual that covered emergency procedures.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> It helps that we have plenty of data on Fuyuki.<br> But that Romani...where did he run off to?</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Now then. Did he elect to do this himself, or did someone make it look like that was the case?</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> What do you think, Fujimaru?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Dr. Roman wouldn&#39;t just up and disappear like this.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I don&#39;t think he chose to do this.</p><hr><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> I see. If you are so certain, it must be true.<br> ...Hm?</p><p><strong>E\uFF1A???:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Bloodlust that can even be felt when using Presence Concealment. How boorish. How impudent. I suppose I should expect as much in such a hellish place.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Hah! Trying to take my measure with an attitude like that. Absolutely laughable.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Stand back, mongrel. I&#39;m going to capture that thing and drag the information we need out of it.</p><p><strong>E\uFF1A???:</strong><br> ...Commencing operation.</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Hmph!</p><p><strong>E\uFF1A???:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> It appears you&#39;ve put too much energy into concealing your identity and made yourself weak in battle.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Or have you underestimated me because I&#39;m a Caster? Fool. I may be a mage, but never forget that I am the King of Heroes!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Fuhahaha, hahahahahahaha!</p><p><strong>E\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Retreat.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> ...Hm. Escaping the instant I let down my guard with my boisterous laughter. Such insolence. A coward who refuses to show their face is not an enemy to be taken seriously, in any case.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The enemy concealed their identity completely.<br> We tried to analyze them from here, but...</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> I see. Mongrel, of the Servants you have summoned, can any conceal their own identities?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Jack!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I wonder...</p><hr><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Someone who can fight while remaining anonymous...Jack the Ripper would be at the top of the list.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> HOW CAN THIS BE!?</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> What&#39;s going on!?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Sorry. I just realized that a handful of Servant readings have disappeared from Chaldea, too.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> It took us some time to confirm since we&#39;re missing some of our staff...I usually make it a habit to check on the Spirit Origin graphs...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I ran a quick check, and Jack is indeed missing.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The Spirit Origin pattern still shows it&#39;s in an excited state, which means she is still summoned...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> We&#39;re trying to sort out which Servants are missing.<br> Hold on a moment, okay?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> It&#39;s hard to believe the Servants would betray us...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> (...This is all really convenient...)</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Senpai, I&#39;m picking up a Servant nearby.<br> Please proceed with caution.</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong><br> ...I head out of Chaldea to hide a bit as usual, and next thing I know, I&#39;m alone in this burning city...</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong><br> Oh? Why, if it isn&#39;t Master and King Gilgamesh.<br> What are you two doing here?</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> That is what I would ask you.<br> And answer truthfully. Fail to do so and die.</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong><br> Let us simply say that I wished for everyone to have an opportunity to rest.</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong><br> Everyone is under orders to rest in shifts, but I wonder, can one really call it \u201Crest\u201D when it is made mandatory?</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong><br> To be free of their distress and rest their minds...<br> I believed that to be in their best interests.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Master...<br> I regret to inform you of this, but...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It appears the unconscious staff members were all in contact with Paracelsus last night.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> We found little medicinal satchels that read \u201CSafe, Cutting-edge, Forward-thinking Von Hohenheim Brand\u201D under each of their pillows...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> At least it didn&#39;t say \u201CConceited.\u201D</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> ...Never seen a shadier Servant...</p><hr><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> And? What exactly did you do?</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong><br> The staff members were all exhausted, so I simply gave them special medicine, is all I can say...</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong><br> Please rest assured. Leaving aside the question of ingredients, the medicine is both potent and effective. Until they have had adequate rest, nothing can wake them.</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong><br> ...Well, as to how exhausted they were...that is beyond my knowledge.</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong><br> So if, for example, they were exhausted from three days of constant work, they will remain asleep for three days.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Fool! If they sleep for three straight days, they will wake up dead! What about water and nutrients!?</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong><br> Yes, yes... Well, we will simply have to rely on their natural resilience...</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Fine. Before we address the main problem,<br> let us deal with this fool. Understand, mongrel?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Yes, my King.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> He&#39;s going to regret this!</p><hr><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> That should take care of matters.<br> Have you learned your lesson, Hohenheim?</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong><br> It...hurts...very much.<br> So much so that I want to try my own medicine...</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong><br> They were homunculi that I raised myself, but were not strong enough to compensate for my rather unremarkable fighting ability.</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong><br> It pains me to use them as mere pawns...</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Hm?</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong><br> I&#39;m leading you into a trap.<br> Would you still care to accompany me?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Wait, Paracelsus!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> We&#39;d better stop Dr. Feelbad over there!</p><hr><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Hold it. I understand how you feel, but calm down, mongrel. There&#39;s no need to rush in like fools.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> He&#39;s a Caster. Unlike the Assassin we encountered, he will be easy to track.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> However, we should try to discern their intent before we do anything.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...Does he want to separate us from something?</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Correct.<br> See, you can do it if you try.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> ...He doesn&#39;t want to get scolded?</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> ...Unbelievable... So this is the level of idiocy I should expect from today&#39;s youth...</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Think, mongrel. He is trying to lure us to follow him, so what is the one thing he would not want us to do?</p><hr><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> His retreat is an obvious diversion. Don&#39;t you think there is somewhere else we should be searching?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...The Greater Grail!</p><hr><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Right. There&#39;s nothing else more valuable than that here.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Do you think that&#39;s the key in figuring out why Jack and Paracelsus are acting strange?</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>A\u014Bra Mainiiu:</strong><br> What the hell, guys? So you just came straight here? Skipped the clever diversion and everything?</p><p><strong>A\u014Bra Mainiiu:</strong><br> Shoulda figured casting the low-energy dweeb as a decoy was a crap decision from the word go.</p><p><strong>A\u014Bra Mainiiu:</strong><br> Anyway! Guess it&#39;s greeting time! Hiya, Master and Lord King Sparkly! Nice job getting here and stuff.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Is that...the Servant detected at the Greater Grail during the Zero incident?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> His Spirit Origin isn&#39;t registered at Chaldea.<br> What is he doing here?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Were you the one who abducted Dr. Roman?</p><p><strong>A\u014Bra Mainiiu:</strong><br> Doctor, huh?<br> Nope, no doctor or scientist friends here.</p><p><strong>A\u014Bra Mainiiu:</strong><br> But that guy?<br> Doctor Roomy...was it?</p><p><strong>A\u014Bra Mainiiu:</strong><br> Well I&#39;ve got him, obviously!<br> Cuz I accepted that job!</p><p><strong>A\u014Bra Mainiiu:</strong><br> Anyway, you wanna go, punks?<br> I better warn you, though...</p><p><strong>A\u014Bra Mainiiu:</strong><br> Eh? Warn you what, you ask? Well, I&#39;m super weak!<br> So don&#39;t bitch when you kill me with that first punch!</p><p><strong>A\u014Bra Mainiiu:</strong><br> But y&#39;know... If you kill me with one punch,<br> you&#39;ll never find that Doctor of yours!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> What!? If we just attack, we&#39;ll never get the information we want!?</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> That is quite the novel hostage tactic, mongrel! A Servant putting his life on the line for negotiations alone...unbelievable!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Take it eas\u2013no, go all-out!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Mash will find the Doctor!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes! I&#39;m scanning the surrounding area right now!<br> So please deal with this enemy, King Gilgamesh!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Oh? Is that so? Did you hear that, Avenger who even I didn&#39;t expect here? What&#39;s your next move?</p><p><strong>A\u014Bra Mainiiu:</strong><br> Hmmm, well, I really liked the bit where you don&#39;t care if I die. Not bad.</p><p><strong>A\u014Bra Mainiiu:</strong><br> Honestly, this was supposed to be an ambush.<br> I was never super worried about living or dying.</p><p><strong>A\u014Bra Mainiiu:</strong><br> As long as my words held your attention, that&#39;s all that matters.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Master!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Behind you, King Gilgamesh!</p><hr><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> You call that a warning!? That was close!<br> It would&#39;ve been fatal had it hit anyone but me!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> I suppose I&#39;ll let it go.<br> Show yourself...third Servant!</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong><br> It appears I missed my opportunity. I should have moved a heartbeat earlier for a proper surprise attack.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong><br> Or was it a matter of execution?<br> Was our teamwork, perhaps, not so great?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Impossible... You too, Amakusa? Please tell us...<br> What did you do the Doctor, and why?</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong><br> Well, you see...<br> Avenger, do you have something to say about this?</p><p><strong>A\u014Bra Mainiiu:</strong><br> You&#39;re askin&#39; me? Wasn&#39;t it something like...Operation Eradicate Chaldea, or something?</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong><br> Well, that&#39;s not exactly artful, but I suppose it will do. Yes, it&#39;s exactly what he said.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong><br> It was the opportune moment...let us leave it at that.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Always vague and guarded, I see.<br> Is this the second time we&#39;ve met?</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> I suppose it was not ME, specifically, who met you,<br> but our connection is engraved on my Spirit Origin.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> I really must give it to you, apocryphal saint...<br> I heard you died very easily in Uruk&#39;s jungles.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> It never occurred to me that you&#39;d have the spine to rebel. Did the ways of modern man wear on you?</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong><br> Hahahaha! You may have made some valid points, but I&#39;ll leave the particulars to your imagination.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong><br> The one thing I can tell you is that I am and always will be myself, no matter where I am.</p><p><strong>A\u014Bra Mainiiu:</strong><br> Hey! Now that your surprise attack failed, hurry up and get this over with. Our opponent&#39;s not the type to be convinced in conversation.</p><p><strong>A\u014Bra Mainiiu:</strong><br> Besides, these two are used to hearing your speechifying.</p><p><strong>A\u014Bra Mainiiu:</strong><br> Anyway, it&#39;s just one dinky Caster. Instead of wasting your energy talking, how about you just kick his ass?</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Fine. I&#39;ll bite, Avenger.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> This magical staff is another of my precious treasures. I&#39;m going to give you a taste of its power!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>A\u014Bra Mainiiu:</strong><br> Yeowch! That REALLY stings!<br> Hurts like hell, but you didn&#39;t kill me, King of Heroes!</p><p><strong>A\u014Bra Mainiiu:</strong><br> Now brace for this! It&#39;s time for the Avenger&#39;s grudge...a curse that doubles the pain you caused and returns it to you!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Avesta&#39;s reversal, is it?<br> How dare you... I won&#39;t let you!</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong><br> Ha!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Tch! Impudent...!<br> But it was a good shot!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> I imagine your battle at Fuuma&#39;s side was quite the sight to behold. And yet, you were still defeated.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Perhaps you met some terrible monster?<br> Was your enemy a beast beyond your imagination?</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong><br> Yes. I can never look at a leopard again.<br> That Servant defeated me utterly.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong><br> But what about you? You have the same sort of priorities and manner of thinking as I do...</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong><br> ...so I understand your train of thought. And if I know what you are thinking, I can find an opening.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Hmph. It appears that rationality and cool-headedness of yours went out the window in that jungle. It&#39;s all well and good to be reasonable in your analyses.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> But you are not strong enough to take initiative!<br> You are what they call a pushover!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> I will crush you both!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> By my order, ready the arrows! Use my treasures to show them the power that protects Uruk! My resolve shall flood the earth...</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong><br> Yes, I know. And I am going into this battle with every awareness...</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Hm!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Divine Judgment!?</p><hr><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Calm yourself! He&#39;s taken his turn, so now we&#39;re on a level field. Now it is your turn!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ! (Use Gandr on Amakusa Shirou...!)</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong><br> ...!</p><p><strong>A\u014Bra Mainiiu:</strong><br> Oof, you went THERE?</p><p><strong>A\u014Bra Mainiiu:</strong><br> Well, Super Amakusa&#39;s Noble Phantasm is super strong... I don&#39;t wanna die to the splash damage!</p><p><strong>A\u014Bra Mainiiu:</strong><br> Well, my only target is Gilgamesh.<br> You, on the other hand, will be spared...!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> ! (Use Gandr on A\u014Bra Mainiiu...!)</p><p><strong>A\u014Bra Mainiiu:</strong><br> Aw man...!<br> Ouch! Even Gandr hurts!!!</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong><br> So you managed to stop his Verg Avesta... A wise decision, as I would expect from my Master.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong><br> His curse returns attacks much stronger to its victim. Had it not been stopped, the King of Heroes surely would have fallen, but...</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong><br> ...what about after that? My Noble Phantasm will hit the King of Heroes before he can act.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong><br> Allow me to demonstrate. Heaven&#39;s Feel, activate.<br> Bring an end to all things...</p><hr><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Hah! I can&#39;t stop laughing! Forget about me!<br> You have underestimated my treasures!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Even if I can&#39;t move, my treasures know and enact my will! Take this...Melammu Din\u2013</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Hey, hey, HEY!<br> What are you all doing out there!?!?!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Eh!? Doctor!?</p><hr><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Romani just barged in...<br> We actually don&#39;t know what&#39;s going on ourselves...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Where the heck were you all this time?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Where? Actually, I was wondering what&#39;s going on here...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I was just taking a nap in my room...for about four hours...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I had a really great dream...but a nap shouldn&#39;t make me a missing person or anything!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> That&#39;s a lie! You didn&#39;t show up on the surveillance cameras in your room!</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong><br> ...Phew. It looks like we can end our battle here now that Dr. Roman is awake.</p><p><strong>A\u014Bra Mainiiu:</strong><br> Guess so. Saintly here is awfully quick to throw in the towel. Ain&#39;t it a shame that you were THIS close to taking him down?</p><p><strong>A\u014Bra Mainiiu:</strong><br> Welp, guess I better just disappear.</p><p><strong>A\u014Bra Mainiiu:</strong><br> Ahhh...but it was my chance to kill something that resembled a human...didn&#39;t matter who it was...</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> ...Hmph. Does Merlin think I&#39;ll be grateful? I can&#39;t believe he&#39;d stop this at the moment I was in mortal peril!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> No matter.<br> If he woke up, there&#39;s no reason for us to remain here.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> We can talk more when we get back to Chaldea.<br> Mash, prepare to Rayshift us back.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> (Sigh) I hope you know Rayshifting isn&#39;t free...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Fine. I still don&#39;t understand the situation, but prepare for their return. Da Vinci, Mash, help me out.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong><br> Please do not forget to collect Jack the Ripper and Paracelsus, too.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong><br> And Jack in particular listened to us very well, so please take especially good care of her later.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Let me get straight to the point. This whole crisis was, in actuality, a drill. Everything happened according to my design and guidance.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> I made it look like Romani left Chaldea by Rayshifting, made the staff members fall asleep...</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> ...and arranged for three Servants to act as enemies.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> O-okay. Um, why would you do such a thing?</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> After touring Chaldea with Fujimaru,<br> I got the general grasp of Chaldea&#39;s vulnerability.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> I have tons of things to point out,<br> but the biggest issue is the humans.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> This place&#39;s operation is dependent on each individual&#39;s skills. The organization would collapse the moment someone goes out of commission.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> And while everyone seems to know this, there has never been any countermeasure of contingency in place.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> A solution...well, it may be difficult to find one until humanity is restored since there is presently no way to replenish lost personnel.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> So plans must be made to prepare for even the worst case scenarios.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Consequently, I anticipated certain possible crises.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> The King of Mages could attack Chaldea directly, for instance. So this was to prepare for such an eventuality as well.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I see...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> (So that&#39;s why the King looked like he was enjoying himself...)</p><hr><p><strong>Jack:</strong><br> Hey, hey Mr. King.<br> What about my reward?</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Just a moment longer. I have never failed to reward those who deserve it. The longer you wait, the greater your joy will be when you receive your reward.</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong><br> Okay!<br> Don&#39;t forget Nursery&#39;s gift too!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Now then. While the scenario did not quite go as planned, you all worked hard. You were like organs in a body compensating for other, missing organs.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Seeing how this has gone, even those who have fallen asleep may wake up and drift back off from sheer ease of mind.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> And what about Paracelsus&#39;s medicine...?</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong><br> I would like to reiterate that this medicine simply makes people sleep until they are rested.</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong><br> A single dose should have no significant side effects.</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong><br> I have prepared a stimulant, but that appears to be unnecessary. Everybody should awaken shortly.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> But what you said in the Singularity was more than a little disturbing...</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong><br> I was only speaking of the effects of an overdose.</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong><br> This may have only been an exercise,<br> but I would never lie to Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong><br> ...Well, if you don&#39;t believe me, I suppose I am to blame for that. Try not to dwell on it too much...</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> I selected those who had the highest probability of turning on you. I wanted to test you all to see how you would react to the situation.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> But you all managed to determine the cause of the issue and successfully executed a Rayshift. Even with some hiccups on the way, you all still pass.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> So that&#39;s what happened...now I see the big picture.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I understand your concern, but don&#39;t you think you went a little overboard with all this?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> What would you have done if the King of Mages had actually attacked during this drill?</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> I planned that part as well. Had there been an actual emergency, I arranged it so that everything would return to its appropriate place.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> You fell asleep and no one was able to find you because Merlin assisted me.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> I knew it! That no-good Caster would definitely do something like that with a big smile on his face!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> After all, the Illusion power of that swindling mage can fool humans AND electronic devices! He&#39;d have no trouble tricking our cameras!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> But Chaldea wasn&#39;t the only thing that I tested during this drill. Mongrel...</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> ...how could you not anticipate a situation where one of your Servants betrayed you? You&#39;re unbelievably naive and soft-hearted.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> But they won&#39;t betray me.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I&#39;ll do my best so that never happens!</p><hr><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> ...I see. It seems I am the fool for once.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> There&#39;s no sense trying to convince an idiot. And I suppose that makes me an idiot today for failing to consider that.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> What are you talking about, King Gilgamesh?<br> This is Chaldea...humanity&#39;s final stronghold.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Infighting and backstabbing...those are concerns for after humanity is restored.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Whether we are human or Heroic Spirit, everyone has assembled here for the same single goal.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> ...I suppose that is true.<br> If it wasn&#39;t, I wouldn&#39;t be here, either...</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Fine. Forget betrayals.<br> The rest...well, we shall see...</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> By the way, mongrel.<br> I quite enjoyed watching your reactions to all this.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> While far from ideal, your decisions were fascinating. Reflect back on your responses here later.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Sooo...it sounds like I was the one who benefitted most from this? Not only did I get ample rest, but I had the best dream...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> In my dream, Magi\u2606Mari did...ahh, nonono.<br> Better if I keep that secret.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Quit your daydreaming.<br> You&#39;re making it sound like I did all this for you.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Oh, you didn&#39;t? This was actually the first time I had a different dream from my usual one...</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> ...Hmph. I&#39;m going to sleep. Wake me up if something happens. No, don&#39;t bother. I&#39;ll wake up on my own.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Annnd, he left angry...<br> Well, I&#39;m sure he&#39;ll be in a good mood again soon.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> That king has a lot on his mind.<br> He&#39;s not one to dwell on one single thing for too long.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> But anyway...I&#39;m sorry, everyone.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> If I were more dependable,<br> I&#39;d have woken up earlier...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> It&#39;s fine. It&#39;s good that you got enough sleep for a change. And we realized how much we value you.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes. We wouldn&#39;t know what to do without you, Doctor. You&#39;re the one who&#39;s pulled everything together and led Chaldea this far.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Yep. We&#39;ll be together forever.</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Yeah, of course.<br> We&#39;ve all been fighting to reclaim our future.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I know I caused you all trouble this time, but I still want to thank you. Thanks. I feel like I slept well.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Are you sure it wasn&#39;t thanks to Magi\u2606Mari?</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Uh...n-no...of course...not...<br> Well, maybe just a little...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Anyway! We need to finish up our work for the day!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> It&#39;s almost dinnertime. Let&#39;s get our work wrapped up, and then all go to the cafeteria together!</p>', 399);
