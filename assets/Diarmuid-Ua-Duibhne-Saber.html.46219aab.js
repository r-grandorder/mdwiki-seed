Bringing certain death in one blow \u2013 bringing certain victory on the first strike. This unsheathed magic sword bestows certain victory to Diarmuid and brings about defeat and death to his opponent.</p><p>This sword, as if it can manipulate even fate, was gifted to Diarmuid by Manann\xE1n[1], who was to the Celts the God of the Sea and the Otherworld. Manann\xE1n was surely the deity who bestowed Noble Phantasms such as Fragarach to the Sun God Lugh and an existence who owned and offered Noble Phantasms in great numbers.</p><p>After making use of a super jump that goes beyond human understanding \u2013 which became apparent due to his materialization in the Saber Class \u2013 Diarmuid executes a falling attack at the moment of its True Name Release. At this occasion, M\xF3ralltach becomes three blades \u2013 resembling even the \u201Clegs of the god Manann\xE1n\u201D that were spoken of in legends \u2013 and cuts the opponent to pieces.</p><p>According to anecdotes, it is said that Diarmuid would carry the magic sword M\xF3ralltach and the magic spear G\xE1e Dearg when betaking himself to adventures where life and death truly hung in the balance, and in cases where he judged the danger of the trip to be little, he would take the magic sword Beagalltach and the magic spear G\xE1e Buidhe.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014When Diarmuid died, the equipment he had been carrying was the latter set.<br> If Diarmuid went into the mountains with the former set of equipment, the Demon Boar would have been killed, and he might have lived a long life.</p><h1 id="beagalltach-rippling-waves-of-passion" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#beagalltach-rippling-waves-of-passion" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Beagalltach: Rippling Waves of Passion</h1><ul><li>Rank: B+</li><li>Classification: Anti-Personnel Noble Phantasm</li><li>Range: 1</li><li>Maximum Number of Targets: 1 person</li></ul><p>A defensive Noble Phantasm.

It is a defensive Noble Phantasm that increases Diarmuid\u2019s own defensive power, while simultaneously, it raises his overall combat performance when he handles it alongside his First Noble Phantasm \u2013 the magic sword M\xF3ralltach.</p><h1 id="character" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#character" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Character</h1><h2 id="pronouns" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#pronouns" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Pronouns</h2><p>First Person Pronouns: ore / watashi<br> Second Person Pronouns: kisama / \u25CB\u25CB (without honorifics) / anata [kanji characters] / anata [hiragana characters] / omae<br> Third Person Pronouns: kisamara / \u25CB\u25CB (without honorifics) / kare / kanojo</p><h2 id="personality" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#personality" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Personality</h2><p>A noble Heroic Spirit who is fervent with loyalty and endowed with faithfulness. Although Diarmuid is basically the same person as when he was a Lancer, his self-awareness as a \u201Cknight\u201D has particularly gotten stronger when he was summoned as a Saber. He enjoys battling formidable enemies and is not afraid of what others may think of himself in pursuing such things. Whether he is aware of it or not, his self-esteem is somewhat stronger when compared to the times where he was a Lancer.</p><h2 id="attitude-towards-master" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#attitude-towards-master" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Attitude Towards Master</h2><p>Basically the same as when Diarmuid was a Lancer.</p><p>Even regarding the Holy Grail, Diarmuid does not intend to use it for himself from the way it seems.

A peerless handsome man who was raised by the Sea God Manann\xE1n and the Fairy King as well as the God of Love Aengus. Diarmuid Ua Duibhne was the best knight among the Knights of the Fianna whom were led by Fionn mac Cumhaill, and it is said that he greatly played an active role in the united front between the knight order and the Fairy King Abarta. The tale of the blighted love between him and Princess Gr\xE1inne is even said to have become the model for the later tale of Lancelot and Guinevere.</p><p>On this occasion, Diarmuid has further materialized with the Saint Graph of a Saber. This is because he considers not only spears, but also swords as his strong points, and yet\u2026 in this Saint Graph, his aspect as a \u201CMythological/Legendary Hero\u201D has been strongly emphasized, so perhaps since he possesses several Noble Phantasms that were owned by the gods, the cost/difficulty level regarding his summoning is higher when compared to the case where he is summoned as a Lancer. (Still, if specific conditions are not satisfied for his Saint Graph, it would not be established and will end up vanishing like mist.)</p><p>Diarmuid\u2019s Noble Phantasms are the twin magic swords M\xF3ralltach and Beagalltach. During the times he was a Lancer, he also possessed Skills that were apparently sealed. In legends, it is said that Diarmuid chose to equip himself with one magic spear and one magic sword at a time, but just like how he was equipped with \u201Cpaired spears\u201D as a Lancer, he got \u201Cpaired swords\u201D with him as a Saber. Once he is summoned, there is no doubt that he will flourish as a powerful knight of the \u201Ctwo-sword style\u201D.</p><h2 id="related-characters" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#related-characters" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Related Characters</h2><p><strong>Artoria (Especially Saber Artoria)</strong></p><p>Saber Diarmuid is delighted to meet with the Knight King again. Seeing that there are no legends in Pan-Human History where the Knight King and Diarmuid \u2013 the Chief Knight of the Fianna \u2013 encountered each other, one can conjecture that they have met in some Holy Grail War. Although they do not speak of the details\u2026 Saber Diarmuid dreams and smiles of the day where they can cross swords once more.</p><p><strong>Miyamoto Musashi</strong></p><p>Diarmuid is quite aware of Musashi\u2019s existence. That is to say, is the reason because they are both dual blade wielders as one would expect?\u2026 Or perhaps\u2026 Is it because Diarmuid is experiencing over again the fate of a man being picked up by a woman?\u2026</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn</strong></p><p>A companion Diarmuid reveres. For the best master of swordsmanship among the Knights of the Fianna, it seems that the existence of the Great Celtic Hero from a different Cycle is about to be on his mind.</p><p><strong>Fionn mac Cumhaill</strong></p><p>A companion Diarmuid once served. Since he is strongly self-aware that he, as of now, is a Servant who serves the Master, Saber Diarmuid does not call Fionn \u201CMy Master\u201D.</p><p><strong>Yagyuu Tajima-no-Kami</strong></p><p>A friend Diarmuid took up at Chaldea.</p><p>According to Tajima-no-Kami, he recalls his seven sons from his early years whenever he looks at Diarmuid.</p><h2 id="comment-from-the-illustrator" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#comment-from-the-illustrator" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Comment from the Illustrator</h2><p>As Diarmuid is said to be a Saber with paired swords, I at least did his image and design with a nimble look to them. In addition, I added to him armour, which plays a role in his appearance so that he appears like a swordsman. Even though I was nervous in being able to take and being entrusted with a handsome character like Diarmuid, I remembered that I drew him while silently praying to myself, \u201CBecome a handsome man~~ Become a handsome man~~!\u201D However, although I assuredly drew him in advance by myself, the impression that Diarmuid and his Saint Graph is slightly at a distance from me is indeed there, and I even slowly came to ridicule myself for that.
