Her manner of living with gilded splendour is sufficient for her to be a millionaire. The fact that she managed a wealthy dynasty while constantly being requested for aid from many kings and Rome\u2019s influential people has granted her this Skill. Second, it shows Cleopatra owning a natural and perfect goddess-like body. It is a unique Skill that combines two kinds of \u201CThe Golden Rule\u201D.</p><p>*The Golden Rule (Wealth &amp; Body) Skill is B-rank in the game</p><p><strong>Divine Protection of the Goddess: [C]</strong></p><p>A Skill that demonstrates the divine protection of the Goddess Isis.</p><h2 id="noble-phantasm-s" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#noble-phantasm-s" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Noble Phantasm(s)</h2><h1 id="uraeus-astrape-o-serpent-who-finishes-the-time-of-daybreak-come-here" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#uraeus-astrape-o-serpent-who-finishes-the-time-of-daybreak-come-here" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Uraeus Astrape: O\u2019 Serpent Who Finishes the Time of Daybreak, Come Here</h1><ul><li>Rank: A</li><li>Classification: Anti-Army Noble Phantasm</li><li>Range: 5~50</li><li>Maximum Number of Targets: 50 people</li></ul><p>Uraeus Astrape (Rearing Cobra\u2019s Lightning). Cleopatra summons an enormous monster, a serpent with a striped pattern of gold and blue. The serpent is coiled around with flames over its whole body. Because she does not possess the Riding Skill, Cleopatra is unable to manipulate it. Consequently, the serpent can absolutely do nothing but destroy the surroundings (Cleopatra also receives damage from this). If one possesses the Divinity Skill, damage received is reduced in proportion to their Skill\u2019s rank.</p><p>Cleopatra calls this serpent a \u201CDivine Beast\u201D, but it is strictly not a Divine Beast of the Phantasmal Kind, and it is something that embodied the concept of ancient Egypt\u2019s demise. Her regret and anguish during her lifetime where she had no other choice but to choose the option of shutting down the history of Egypt that spanned over thousands of years by severing her own life was changed into a Noble Phantasm connected with the serpent (Uraeus) that symbolizes the divinity of the Pharaohs. The symbolic serpent is the cobra, and was it by coincidence, was it by intention, or was it according to a predetermined destiny that it was the cobra that Cleopatra had chosen as her means of suicide?</p><h1 id="character" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#character" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Character</h1><h2 id="pronouns" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#pronouns" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Pronouns</h2><p>First Person Pronouns: warawa / watakushi<br> Second Person Pronouns: anata / \u25CB\u25CB-sama<br> Third Person Pronouns: kare / kanojo / \u25CB\u25CB-sama</p><h2 id="personality" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#personality" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Personality</h2><p>Domineering, very sadistic, and kind. Cleopatra\u2019s words, deeds, and behaviour are altogether unprecedented for a queen. Dashingly, a top lady who lives on coolness. With her utmost nice nature, there are also traits from her that are seen as foolish because of her speeches and conducts further exaggerating that nature. Acknowledging nothing but heavenly beauty. With the exception of that, everything else is to be disparaged. Nevertheless, she does things such as showing consideration, advising, looking after, and holding receptions for companions on their health and prospects. She loves receptions. She holds self-confidence in her own beauty, and declares loudly that almost all things are \u201Cbeneath me\u201D, but she is also a hard worker who devotes her present self to her studies day after day just under the point of it being tiresome. Although she usually abuses others, it is not \u201Cto act as a fool to others.\u201D It is obvious that she is beautiful. It is obvious that except for herself, the others are not beautiful. That being the case, Cleopatra herself simply talks about what seems to be obvious to be an obvious reality, and in her words, she does not express \u201Cunpleasant feelings to the others.\u201D</p><p>In a public place, Cleopatra behaves arrogantly as a queen, but when it is the private Cleopatra, that unprecedented style becomes reserved, well-bred and often prudent, and she becomes a cool high-class lady. To say it in a few words, her attributes are domineering, extremely S, and kind. She is kind, despite having sadistic tastes. And although she has sadistic tastes and is very sadistic, it is not because she gets a pleasant feeling in tormenting another person. She does not disparage others for the sake of making herself feel good, but her disposition is merely like that.</p><p>Cleopatra\u2019s true nature is of a person of character who tries to discern decorum, pay attention to the surroundings, and keep the peace. Even when the delegations of foreign countries came around, the usual state of things is that she does things such as abusing them first before showing consideration for their health, such as with \u201CIn my country, I myself am the absolute standard, and those unattractive are no different than slaves, no matter who they are. Hah, you ugly men of an inferior and low quality, prepare yourselves! Do continue to relax to your hearts\u2019 content here!\u201D, thanking the delegations afterwards with a hospitality of the highest quality.</p><p>Cleopatra has a bad habit of catching every hardship given that she thinks about trying to do everything perfectly as well, her perfectionist temperament being a misfortune. \u201C\u2026 Troublesome\u2026\u201D She speaks to herself.</p><h2 id="attitude-towards-master" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#attitude-towards-master" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Attitude Towards Master</h2><p>Cleopatra comes into contact with her Master with a condescending attitude in a straightforward manner. However, her \u201Cattentive attribute\u201D \u2013 which is her basis \u2013 is fully displayed, vigorously paying attention to the ways of how to take care of her Master.</p><p>The wish Cleopatra wants to make on the Holy Grail is \u201Cto acknowledge Caesar and their son Caesarion.\u201D Towards the world far and wide, she wants to vigorously announce that her child, Caesarion, is a child spun from the result of the love between the couple\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><h2 id="dialogue-examples" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#dialogue-examples" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Dialogue Examples</h2><p>\u201CTroublesome\u2026\u201D</p><p>\u201CDo look up at me reverently!\u201D</p><p>\u201CMy fingers got dirty. But if it was the case of crushing something with them, at best, a fruit would have been fine with me.\u201D</p><p>\u201CWords to represent master and servant? Guess what I have decided?

A figure of 1st Century BC. The last Queen of Egypt\u2019s Ptolemaic Dynasty, and essentially known as the Last Pharaoh of ancient Egypt. Cleopatra called herself the incarnation of the Goddess Isis and excelled in many groundings, having spent her whole life to protect Egypt\u2019s Ptolemaic Dynasty to the end, but\u2026 she was not able to oppose the raging era whirling in the Mediterranean world, and in the end, she gave up her own life; thus, the dynasty reached its demise.</p><p>Although Cleopatra has a certain image of reigning over Egypt by means of her beauty, it is in fact the exact opposite. She was deeply intelligent, manipulated multiple languages, and regarding especially her economic skills, it was by far absurd. It was said that she raised Egypt\u2019s Ptolemaic Dynasty, a country inferior in military strength, to a world-leading economic state according to her directions.</p><h2 id="character-in-fgo" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#character-in-fgo" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Character in FGO</h2><p>The Great Top Lady Pharaoh. Being self-conscious of her charm, Cleopatra turned it into her greatest weapon to seduce others, and on the topic of becoming intimate with a seduced partner, it would be nice if he was a lovely man. The word \u201Clovely\u201D here is not necessarily about his appearance, but what is inside of him that is most important. If one cuddles close together with another, then it is good to devote their life. Marriage is something neat. To ascertain love peacefully, birth children, and wish for proper acknowledgement. One among the two people who devoted their greatest love to her in her lifetime, the general Caesar of the Roman Empire, was even charmed by her ambitions and intellect that were so far as fierce, but Caesar was a fine figure of a man, or something like that, to the extent that Cleopatra herself thought \u201CI lost\u2026!\u201D</p><p>Cleopatra got close to two men in her lifetime. First, Caesar. Towards him, she clearly fell in love. The state of their passions and affections made even the wind fluttering in the Mediterranean Sea appear to be sparkling, but\u2026 he died. Although the unification of the Mediterranean world was right before his very eyes, he was assassinated. He left their son Caesarion. And then, there was a person who appeared before Cleopatra while she was lost in tears. The Roman general Antonius, the man who told her that he will protect Cleopatra and Egypt\u2019s Ptolemaic Dynasty. Her country and people, and two men\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014Rome\u2019s Caesar and Antonius whom she loves; in the end, she committed suicide.</p><p>She got close to two men, and died.</p><p>It was love. It was the result of her feelings. Was it also something like a product of her self-interest?\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014However, posterity, not to mention even in those days, unanimously whispered that \u201Cthis devilish woman seduced the Roman generals\u201D, and as a result, becoming a Heroic Spirit and subsequently materializing as a Servant nowadays, Cleopatra acquired an existence as \u201Ca woman of seduction endowed with a devilish beauty.\u201D Even so, as per her dignity\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014she only gets close to lovely gentlemen. A person endowed with sincerity inside and who believes in having no regrets even if they died together; only this kind of partner \u2013 similar to the men she loved before \u2013 can, utterly, seduce her.</p><p>\u25C6</p><p>In \u201CFate/Grand Order\u201D, Cleopatra appears in modern garments such as in leather shorts and a jacket, but this is the expression of her maiden power of \u201Csimply not displaying her true self with such an appearance.\u201D When the time comes where she trusts her Master and their bonds have been deepened, she will probably display \u201Cher appearance in accordance with historical fact\u201D for the first time.</p><p>During moments of combat, Cleopatra will soon be in high spirits; to the extent that she will be ridiculing loudly during those moments. She also had a wild temperament while alive, and she had even taken lessons in swordsmanship and hand-to-hand fighting techniques in jest, but now that she has transformed into a Servant, she attained and displays genuine hand-to-hand fighting techniques because of her Imperial Privilege Skill. Although she is an Assassin that mainly tries to do surprise attacks as per typical of the Class, if it is a Saber or Lancer opponent of an average ability, it becomes possible for her to endure and even exchange blows with those kind of opponents from right in front of her.</p><p>Cleopatra loves Alexandria, the capital where she was born and raised in, and she deeply respects and adores the Great King Iskandar of Macedonia who in addition, became the origin of the name Alexandria and the Ptolemaic Dynasty.</p><p>Cleopatra herself really gets angry and becomes depressed when she is called a \u201Cbeautiful courtesan\u201D, given that was not her intention. For Cleopatra herself, she has only devoted herself to love \u2013 similar to getting fired up \u2013 in regard to men who, upon giving their word, protected her and her country while simultaneously endeavouring for the sake of defending her beloved native land of Egypt and the city of Alexander; with that purpose, in no way was she a courtesan and the like.</p><h2 id="others" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#others" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Others</h2><p>Strictly speaking, the \u201CLast Pharaoh\u201D is proven to be Cleopatra\u2019s own child, Caesarion, who Cleopatra had chosen as a joint ruler in her last several years. This is because after Cleopatra\u2019s death, Caesarion lived longer for at least a few days. However, Caesarion was only 9 years old[1] during the time he lost his life. Thus, the de facto \u201CLast Pharaoh\u201D who ruled over the country and fought against fate was surely Cleopatra.</p><h2 id="related-characters" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#related-characters" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Related Characters</h2><p><strong>Boudica</strong></p><p>\u201CUnlike me, you chose to be hostile to Rome, huh?
