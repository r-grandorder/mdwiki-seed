Mm, maybe I&#39;ve said too much. I know the truth, to be perfectly honest. (ok it said \u30DB\u30C3\u30C8 but i bet dollars to donuts its a typo and it actually supposed to be \u307B\u3093\u3068\u3000because otherwise it just doesnt make sense.)</p><p><strong>Kogil</strong></p><p>Somehow or other, he is the same on the inside, right?

There are some areas where I and Illya also overlap with, so I can symphatize.</p><p><strong>Irisviel</strong></p><p>Is Mama an airhead, simple of mind, or all knowing instead? She&#39;s really hard to understand, but... mm, yeah, in the end I know she is totally one-of-a-kind.</p><h2 id="comment-from-the-illustrator" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#comment-from-the-illustrator" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Comment from the Illustrator</h2><p>Being a welfare character, she only has 1 clothing set and it&#39;s decided to be her usual piece without any debate. Were she to have 3 stages appearance instead, she would have a bikini armor with armor parts jutting here and there on it. Too bad, so sad. Since, the same with Illya, her design is from the old days, even I am kinda forgetful about it, but the foundation is Emiya&#39;s arrangement. Her dark skin is also Emiya&#39;s influence. Her breastplate is cut in the image of heart shape.
