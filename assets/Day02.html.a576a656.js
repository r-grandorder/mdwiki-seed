On top of that, if you commit a crime with magecraft, the heretic hunters of the church will come after you.</p><p>...That just means that whatever you use magecraft for, lack of care will create enemies.</p><p>I, Emiya Shirou, just have to study independently, taking that into account\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>&quot;...Hm.&quot;</p><p>I wake up to see the sun shining in through the window.</p><p>The sun may have just risen as it&#39;s still a bit dark outside.</p><p>&quot;...Hm.

I told you to come home early since it gets dark early in the winter.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I am home early.

It looks like dinner&#39;s ready, but...&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Sakura-chan went home early. She said she had something to do today, so she just cooked dinner and left.&quot;</p><p>Fuji-Nee says so happily.</p><p>As far as she&#39;s concerned, anyone who cooks for her is a good person.</p><hr><p>&quot;I see. That might be a good idea for a while. It&#39;s been dangerous recently, so maybe I should just cook dinner myself until next term.&quot;</p><p>&quot;What? I protest! You come home so late, Shirou. If you don&#39;t cook until after that, we won&#39;t eat until after ten.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...Hold on. Can&#39;t you just eat at home?&quot;</p><p>&quot;What? I am at home.&quot;</p><p>Fuji-Nee seems puzzled.</p><p>Honestly, I&#39;m not sure if that makes me happy or sad.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Alright, I understand. I can&#39;t exactly expect you to cook for yourself, can I?</p><p>...Anyways, what&#39;s that thing by your feet? Don&#39;t tell me you&#39;ve been picking up junk again.&quot;</p><hr><p>Fuji-Nee has a terrible habit of leaving junk at my place.</p><p>Large bowls from restaurants, a heavy teapot she got in the shopping district, a strange guitar that plays by itself...

Uh, it&#39;s a poster that was left over at my place....&quot;</p><p>Fuji-Nee hands me the poster.</p><p>It&#39;s probably some infamous idol or something.</p><hr><p>&quot;Let&#39;s see...&quot;</p><p>Here we have, a military-style guy with his thumbs up, on a cheap looking blue sky background.</p><p>In letters like blood, it reads:</p><p>&quot;Love&#39;s Lovely Ranger Land.</p><p>Please join the Self-Defense Force&quot;[r]</p><p>...Hold on, this is an army recruiting poster...!</p><hr><p>&quot;I don&#39;t want it, so you can have it.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Whoa, I don&#39;t want this either!&quot;</p><p>I roll up the poster and hit Fuji-Nee with it.</p><hr><p>&quot;Heheh, missed.&quot;</p><p>But.</p><p>Fuji-Nee deflects my attack with a poster she had hidden, and counterattacks mercilessly.</p><p>Bam.</p><p>The poster lightly knocks my\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>&quot;Guhhh!?&quot;</p><p>Stars! I saw stars!</p><hr><p>&quot;Heheh, don&#39;t imagine you can hit me with your skills. You need to practice more.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Guh... t-that&#39;s not the problem. What was that? Why does a poster make a crash like that...?&quot;</p><p>Could this be the skill of a master...!?</p><hr><p>&quot;Huh? Oh, sorry, this poster is the special first edition made from steel plate.</p><p>...Shirou, is your head all right...?&quot;</p><p>&quot;...Fuji-Nee, your personality is going to kill someone one day...&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Hehe. I&#39;m not worried. Shirou would marry me if that happened.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Huh, I completely refuse. I have no intention of marrying such a thoughtless killer.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Hey... I don&#39;t think I&#39;m that dangerous of a person.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I knew it. So it&#39;s true that people never know themselves.&quot;</p><p>How true, how true.</p><p>I&#39;ll have to watch out or I&#39;ll be killed.</p><hr><p>&quot;Huh, just keep saying that. Anyways, I&#39;m hungry, Shirou. I&#39;ve waited all this time, so let&#39;s have dinner.&quot;</p><p>Fuji-Nee stands up.</p><p>...How strange. Fuji-Nee is helping out (even if it&#39;s only setting up the dishes). She must be really hungry.</p><hr><p>&quot;Okay. Then you can get the dishes out. You can pour rice, right?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I can. Hey, Shirou, can I use a bowl?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I guess so. Sakura isn&#39;t here today, so there&#39;ll be some left over anyway.&quot;</p><p>&quot;All right. I&#39;ll use the same for you, then.&quot;</p><p>Fuji-Nee pours rice into two bowls.</p><hr><p>&quot;......&quot;</p><p>Oh well. I was going to have seconds anyway. And besides, if I argue with Fuji-Nee, she&#39;ll take my dinner away.</p><p>And to add...</p><p>Chaotic dinners like this have been common scenes for many years now.</p><hr><p>...The day ends.</p><p>Finishing a rowdy dinner and seeing Fuji-Nee off, I take a bath.</p><p>After that, I practice my daily routine in the shed.</p><p>I complete it as usual and go to sleep.</p><p>It is one in the morning.</p><p>The day ends peacefully without any troubles.</p><hr><h2 id="scene-03-signs" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#scene-03-signs" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Scene 03 - Signs</h2><p>&quot;Yeah. I have time, so I&#39;ll make something else.&quot;</p><p>I open the refrigerator.</p><p>All that&#39;s left are some cucumber and potatoes.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Hmmm. I could cut and salt the cucumber, or cut the potatoes and serve them vinegared....&quot;</p><p>But those are both things I could do in a couple of minutes, and they&#39;re better fresh.</p><p>It&#39;ll be half an hour until Fuji-Nee and Sakura arrive, so I should make a dish right before they get here.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Hmph.&quot;</p><p>In that case, this is free time I can&#39;t make much use of.</p><p>Is there anything I can do in thirty minutes...?</p><p>&quot;There&#39;s some chicken, so...&quot;</p><p>I could cook some bite-sized meat rolls with vegetables, or something like that.</p><hr><p>I cut the meat and tenderize it.</p><p>At a glance, the meat tenderizer is really evil. It&#39;s like a hammer, but it&#39;s flat on four sides and has lots of spikes coming out of it.</p><hr><p>If it were bigger, it would make a great instrument of torture.</p><p>I flatten the meat with the scary object, put some carrots and kidney beans on it, roll it up, cook it in the pan, and steam it with wine.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Huh!? Hold on, what am I doing...!?&quot;</p><p>At that point, I regain my sanity.</p><p>I was trying to make a side dish, as the saury was already the main dish.</p><p>So what am I doing, making another main dish...!?</p><hr><p>&quot;...Honestly. I must have let my guard down, cooking just to pass the time.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Eh? You were cooking just to pass the time, Senpai?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yeah. The thing is, I was trying to make a side dish. But before I realized it, I was using the knife. Well, I guess habit is a scary thing... of course, that&#39;s just an excuse.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;But isn&#39;t that alright? It&#39;s a bit big for breakfast, but since you made it, I don&#39;t think there&#39;ll be any leftovers.&quot;</p><p>&quot;You think so? No, that&#39;s not the problem.</p><p>There&#39;s no need for two suns in the sky. I&#39;ll have to ask one of them to leave.&quot;</p><p>&quot;What!? You&#39;re not going to eat it, Senpai?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;I will. I wasn&#39;t planning to, but I&#39;ll pack lunch today. That way, it won&#39;t be a waste.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Wow... Senpai, you&#39;re going to make lunch right now?&quot;</p><p>&quot;It&#39;ll be close, but I think I can at least get my\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><hr><p>And then.</p><p>I finally realize someone&#39;s behind me.</p><hr><p>&quot;Good morning, Senpai. I&#39;m here again today.&quot;</p><p>Sakura greets me with a smile.</p><p>It&#39;s not unusual for Sakura to come into the kitchen at this time.</p><p>She always rings the bell as she comes in, but sometimes I don&#39;t notice, like this morning.</p><hr><p>&quot;G-Good morning, Sakura. Breakfast&#39;s ready, so you can relax in the living room. There&#39;s some tea there.&quot;</p><p>I answer her, staring at the frying pan.</p><p>On the table is a pot of hot water, a teapot, and some snacks.</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh, yes. You&#39;re perfect again today, Senpai.&quot;</p><p>Sakura&#39;s voice is lively, as if she&#39;s happy about something.</p><p>...And Sakura comes into the kitchen instead of going to the table.</p><hr><p>&quot;Senpai? You&#39;re making lunch, right?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Hm? Yeah, it turned out that way. It&#39;s a good dish for lunch, so I thought I&#39;d make some side dishes.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Um, then can I help? I&#39;ll make my own, so...&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh, wait. If you don&#39;t mind having the same thing, I can give you some of mine.&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015Yes. I was watching and I wanted to have some of yours.&quot;</p><p>&quot;All right. Can you cook the rice, then? We don&#39;t have enough for two. There should be a fast rice cooker over there.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes, I&#39;ll take care of it. I&#39;ll go and start that, then.&quot;</p><hr><p>I hear the sound of her footsteps, and of her tying her apron.</p><p>&quot;Senpai? We&#39;re okay with two cups of rice, right?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Hmm, I think that&#39;ll be enough.&quot;</p><p>With quick movements, Sakura comes to help in the kitchen.</p><hr><p>&quot;Morning! Well done, it smells great!&quot;</p><p>A little past six-thirty.</p><p>Thirty minutes after Sakura, Fuji-Nee arrives as usual.</p><hr><p>&quot;Good morning, Sensei. Please wait a little longer for breakfast.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yep, I&#39;ll wait. ...Oh, Sakura-chan, are you making breakfast with Shirou?&quot;</p><p>&quot;No, Senpai made breakfast on his own. We&#39;re making lunch right now.&quot;</p><hr><p>Sakura&#39;s voice is really lively.</p><p>We&#39;re not doing anything particularly fun, so I don&#39;t know what she&#39;s so happy about.</p><hr><p>&quot;I see, so of course you&#39;re in a good mood. Cooking and Shirou, so much fun stuff. Okay, we don&#39;t have much time, but take it easy.&quot;</p><p>Laughing, Fuji-Nee sits at the table and pours some tea.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Geez, she must still be off dreaming. What&#39;s so fun about cooking for school?&quot;</p><p>I put the pan back onto the rack.</p><p>The food&#39;s made, so all that&#39;s left is to pack the lunchboxes.</p><hr><p>&quot;Sorry, Sakura. I made you do extra work before club activities.</p><p>I wanted you to relax since you did a lot yesterday.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Huh? Don&#39;t worry about that at all. Like Fujimura-Sensei said, I find cooking fun.&quot;</p><hr><p>She smiles.</p><p>Well, I know she likes cooking... but still, it must be hard for her getting up at five o&#39;clock to make lunch.</p><p>Besides, Sakura comes and makes dinner often.</p><p>So if I&#39;m getting her to cook in the mornings too, she might have no free time at all.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Phew. I&#39;m grateful for the help, but you should relax, Sakura. You should sleep in during the mornings, and after school is for playing around. You don&#39;t have to come and help around my house.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Well, I am relaxing. You made breakfast today, and I got some food from you for lunch too.&quot;</p><hr><p>She smiles.</p><p>...Sigh.</p><p>It&#39;s been a year and a half since Sakura started to help out. Now, she keeps coming back like this no matter what I say.</p><hr><p>&quot;That&#39;s different. You have your own life too, so you can&#39;t just take care of me and Fuji-Nee. If you&#39;re taking care of us, you won&#39;t be able to do all the things you want to.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Ahaha, that&#39;s fine. My only hobbies are archery and cooking. In fact, my goal is to beat you at cooking, and I think I&#39;m almost there.&quot;</p><p>Sakura puffs her chest out boastfully.</p><p>...Gah.</p><p>I want to argue back, but it&#39;s true as she is about to beat me.</p><hr><p>&quot;So please don&#39;t worry about it. I like cooking here, and improving is fun.</p><p>I&#39;m helping you to pay you back for showing me this great pleasure, and for my own benefit.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...Hm. Does that mean you&#39;re stealing some of my skill every day, Sakura?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes. I improve quickly just by helping you. So please be ready. I&#39;ll make you admit defeat someday.&quot;</p><p>Whoa.</p><p>I can&#39;t believe she said it so bluntly!</p><hr><p>&quot;...Man. If I&#39;d known this was coming, I would never have taught you to cook. You never even heard of oil before coming here, but now you&#39;re after me like an enemy. Really, why are you chasing me like this?</p><p>Can&#39;t you just be happy making food?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Of course I&#39;m after you. You can&#39;t be better than me.&quot;</p><p>&quot;...?&quot;</p><p>I&#39;m not sure what&#39;s so bad about that, but we should start setting the table for breakfast.</p><hr><p>&quot;Alrighty.&quot;</p><p>I check the saury.</p><p>Placing my chopstick on the well grilled stomach, I check how cooked it is.</p><hr><p>&quot;I guess that&#39;s done. Here, Sakura, can you take this to the table?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes, thank you Senpai.&quot;</p><hr><p>I hand the plate of saury to Sakura.</p><p>Then, as if remembering something important, Sakura stops dead.</p><hr><p>&quot;Sakura? What&#39;s wrong, did you leave something at home?&quot;</p><p>Sakura may seem shrewd, but she actually forgets things a lot.</p><p>It&#39;s not unusual for her to remember something and stop like this.</p><p>But... it seems like that&#39;s not the case this morning.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Sakura?&quot;</p><p>&quot;......&quot;</p><p>There&#39;s no answer.</p><p>She just blankly stares at my hand like she&#39;s still in a daze, then...</p><hr><p>&quot;Senpai... what&#39;s that bruise on your hand?&quot;</p><p>She asks me a strange question.</p><hr><p>&quot;Huh?&quot;</p><p>I look down at the hand she&#39;s talking about.</p><hr><p>&quot;Huh...? You&#39;re right, there is a bruise. That&#39;s weird, I don&#39;t remember hitting it anywhere.&quot;</p><hr><p>For some reason, there&#39;s a big bruise on the back of my left hand.</p><p>It&#39;s quite an impressive welt, and it looks like it came from some sort of a cut.</p><p>Even on my own hand, it looks bad.</p><p>Perhaps Sakura&#39;s not feeling well as she&#39;s very quiet.</p><hr><p>&quot;Sorry, can you handle the rest? I&#39;ll go put something on it.&quot;</p><p>I let Sakura take care of the kitchen and head for the dojo.</p><p>I don&#39;t know if I did this during my sleep, but I&#39;ll have to treat it.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>But for some reason, I&#39;m worried about Sakura, who looked awkward and downcast.</p><hr><p>&quot;I&#39;ll go on ahead, then.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Sakura, are you sure you&#39;re all right? You can skip your club if you&#39;re not feeling well.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;No, I&#39;m fine. It&#39;s just a light headache, so you shouldn&#39;t worry about it. I only look bad because you imagine it. I&#39;m doing really well today.&quot;</p><p>She says so with a smile.</p><p>...But anyone can tell she&#39;s just bluffing.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015Really well, huh? Even though you couldn&#39;t eat any breakfast?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh....&quot;</p><p>She looks away awkwardly.</p><hr><p>Without looking up, she replies...</p><p>&quot;...Please excuse me. You&#39;re the one who should be resting, Senpai.&quot;</p><p>With those words, she leaves.</p><hr><p>The table is cleared.</p><p>But on the plate in the kitchen, Sakura&#39;s meal remains untouched.</p><hr><p>&quot;Honestly, what&#39;s wrong with her?&quot;</p><p>She had been in such a good mood, but after seeing my bruise, Sakura suddenly became quiet and started to make lots of mistakes.</p><hr><p>She overfilled the tea, drenched the omelets with soy sauce, and sat down at the table with her apron on.</p><p>And on top of that, she ate nothing and went to school looking pale.</p><hr><p>&quot;Maybe she caught a cold or something.&quot;</p><p>I mutter to myself while cleaning up.</p><p>It&#39;s the first time I&#39;ve seen Sakura like this.</p><p>I got to know her during the summer four years ago, and she started coming here to help a year and a half ago.</p><p>In that time, I&#39;ve never seen her look this ill.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>...Fuji-Nee will be at the archery range, so I don&#39;t think there&#39;ll be a problem there.

It&#39;s a waste to keep it like this.&quot;</p><p>It&#39;s a large area, so if they retiled it, the park would get bigger.</p><p>Thinking absent-mindedly, I sit down on a bench.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>I stare at the burned land to pass the time.</p><p>I don&#39;t remember what happened here back then.</p><p>I probably don&#39;t remember because I was a kid, and it wouldn&#39;t have been an easy scene to memorize.</p><p>All I can remember is that it was hot and I couldn&#39;t breathe.</p><p>And that people died trying to save others.</p><hr><p>&quot;I wonder why....&quot;</p><p>For example, an adult that tried to save a child from a burning house. He saved the child, but died in its place.</p><p>For example, there were people who had their throats burned, but they gave what little water they had to one guy, and the others died.</p><p>For example, there was someone who ran alone to get away from the fire as fast as possible, and everyone that he passed on the way died.</p><hr><p>And for example...</p><p>People who died because they gave away something that was saving them, only to save others they didn&#39;t even know.</p><hr><p>&quot;......&quot;</p><p>I didn&#39;t like things like that.</p><p>It makes me mad that those who tried hard were sacrificed.</p><p>Am I greedy to want an ending where everybody is safe and happy?</p><p>All I wanted was to see people relax peacefully, so why couldn&#39;t I manage such a simple thing?</p><hr><p>&#39;That&#39;s difficult. What you want is to save everyone.&#39;</p><hr><p>Kiritsugu answered so to the question I asked as a child.</p><p>Of course, as a child, I denied it.</p><p>Because Kiritsugu saved me. I knew he was a sorcerer who could do anything.</p><p>I knew he was a superhero who couldn&#39;t ignore people in need, who saved them for no benefit.</p><p>So I believed Kiritsugu could have saved everyone back then.</p><hr><p>When I told him that, he made a troubled expression and said something that I remember to this day.</p><hr><p>&#39;Shirou, saving one person means not saving others. Look, a superhero can only save the people he has saved. It&#39;s obvious, but that is the definition of a superhero.&#39;</p><hr><p>I understand that.</p><p>It&#39;s obvious, now that he&#39;s said it.</p><p>Let&#39;s say there&#39;s a robber and some hostages, and the robber intends to kill the hostages.</p><p>With normal methods, most of the hostages will be killed.</p><hr><p>Even if you use a miraculous method to save all the hostages, there will still be one person who isn&#39;t saved.</p><p>That, of course, is the robber whose hostages were rescued.</p><p>The people a superhero saves are only those he decides to save.</p><p>That&#39;s why even God cannot save everyone.</p><hr><p>&quot;All the more so if it&#39;s a natural disaster. No one could have saved everybody.&quot;</p><p>The fire ten years ago was like that.</p><p>It&#39;s not something I, who was miraculously saved from it, can talk about now.</p><hr><p>&quot;But I don&#39;t want that.&quot;</p><p>I don&#39;t want such a thing.</p><p>I don&#39;t want help that has a limited capacity.</p><p>You have to help, no matter how impossible it is.</p><p>I can&#39;t stand to have strangers dying around me like back then.</p><hr><p>So if I had been there ten years ago, even if it was impossible, I would have gone into the fire and...</p><p>&quot;I would certainly have died in vain.&quot;</p><p>That&#39;s for certain.</p><p>Geez, I&#39;m hopeless.</p><hr><p>&quot;Gah, it&#39;s five o&#39;clock already.&quot;</p><p>The five o&#39;clock bell rings.</p><p>I stand up and quickly make my way to my work.</p><hr><p>When my job&#39;s done, the sun has already set.</p><p>It&#39;s a bit before eight.</p><p>I finished ten minutes early because I worked too hard.</p><p>It seems I worked frantically since I went to that place before work.</p><hr><p>Here in front of the station, the night&#39;s just getting started.</p><p>There are lots of people, and a constant flow of cars on the road.</p><p>The buildings are still lit up, and just looking at them makes me feel like I&#39;m watching a grand festival of illumination.</p><hr><p>&quot;I guess I don&#39;t have to buy anything for Fuji-Nee.&quot;</p><p>I walk while looking up at the lighted building.</p><p>It&#39;s the biggest building in Shinto, so I can&#39;t see the top clearly.</p><p>I just gaze up the building, just enjoying the night&#39;s scenery...</p><p>&quot;...?&quot;</p><p>...When I think I see something out of place.</p><hr><p>&quot;What was that?&quot;</p><p>I stop and stare at the rooftop.</p><p>I focus my eyes, looking at the thing as small as a grain of rice.</p><hr><p>&quot;...What the...&quot;</p><p>It looks like someone I know.</p><hr><p>Why is she there?</p><p>What would she be doing there?</p><p>With her long hair fluttering and doing nothing, she looks down at the town.</p><hr><p>&quot;......&quot;</p><p>It doesn&#39;t seem like she notices me down here.</p><p>No, there&#39;s no way she could see me.</p><p>She&#39;s so high up that I, with better eyesight than most, can barely see her by improving my vision with magical energy.</p><p>I can recognize her since she&#39;s standing there alone, but there&#39;s no way she would notice me down here among all these people.</p><hr><p>She&#39;s just looking down at the town.</p><p>Maybe she&#39;s looking for something, as I can feel her sharp stare even down here.</p><p>&quot;......&quot;</p><p>I forget about time and keep looking up at the girl standing in the sky.</p><p>She is on top of a tall tower.</p><p>She&#39;s like a witch, looking down at the earth with the moon behind her.</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh...&quot;</p><p>And then.</p><p>She must be done with whatever she was doing, as she disappears.</p><p>Her figure has disappeared and the scene returns to the beautiful view of the night.</p><p>&quot;That was Tohsaka, right?&quot;</p><hr><p>I have no proof, but I think I&#39;m right.</p><p>There aren&#39;t many girls with looks that stand out that much, and more than that, I&#39;m not stupid enough to mistake a girl I secretly admire.</p><hr><p>&quot;...I see.

You get so cold when talking about the archery club.</p><p>You&#39;ve got it nice. You left Shinji behind and just quit. Couldn&#39;t you think about those who were left, like me and Sakura?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Hmm. Did Shinji do something again?&quot;</p><p>&quot;A day doesn&#39;t pass when he doesn&#39;t do something.</p><p>...But still, yesterday was a bit too much.[l]</p><p>He even made a guy from the first year quit.&quot;</p><hr><p>Mitsuzuri sighs seriously.</p><p>It&#39;s rare for her to make a face like this, but even more than that, I can&#39;t ignore what she just said.</p><hr><p>&quot;What&#39;s that? A student quit? Why?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Shinji took his anger out on him. He got loads of female students around and made the kid, who has barely started handling bows, shoot. He laughed at him until he hit the target.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Huh!? And you let that happen!?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Of course I didn&#39;t! But a captain&#39;s busy, you know? I can&#39;t always be in the dojo. You know that.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...That&#39;s true, but what the hell was Shinji thinking? He does teach very harshly, but he&#39;s not the type to make fun of people like that.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...I&#39;m surprised. You really are like that.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Hm, what do you mean by that? Were you just thinking badly of me?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh, I was just thinking objectively about the truth. So it&#39;s up to you if you want to feel angry about it.&quot;</p><p>&quot;...Stop copying me.[l]</p><p>Fine, but what about Shinji? Why did he act like that?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Hmm, from what I heard, it was something like getting turned down harshly by Tohsaka.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Huh? You mean, that Tohsaka?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;There&#39;s no other Tohsaka at our school.[l]</p><p>I&#39;m talking about the honor student in class 2-A, Miss Perfect, Tohsaka Rin.&quot;</p><p>&quot;...I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve heard that nickname before.&quot;</p><hr><p>It&#39;s the first time I&#39;ve heard the nickname, but I would probably agree with it.</p><p>With Tohsaka involved, I can understand even Shinji getting turned down, and most of all...</p><p>If it was Tohsaka, I can see her refusing him mercilessly.</p><hr><p>&quot;Anyways, Shinji&#39;s been like this since yesterday.</p><p>That&#39;s why I&#39;ve had to keep an eye on the dojo until now today.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Shinji has a nasty temper. I know it&#39;s hard, but keep up the hard work, Mitsuzuri.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Okay, okay. But Shinji never knows when to stop, you know? I feel like he&#39;ll do something really bad if he asks her out again and gets turned down again.&quot;</p><p>&quot;No, even Shinji wouldn&#39;t approach someone who turned him down. He&#39;s pretty good about that kind of thing.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;But he can&#39;t help it if the person who turned him down comes near him. I don&#39;t know why, but Tohsaka comes and visits the dojo pretty often. You quit, so you wouldn&#39;t know.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Hm?&quot;</p><p>That&#39;s the first I&#39;ve heard of it.</p><p>Tohsaka Rin doesn&#39;t do any club activities for personal reasons. I thought she went straight home since she even turned down the recommendation to join the student council.</p><hr><p>&quot;Well, maybe that sort of thing is good every now and then. He has a haughty attitude, so it might be good for him to have a hard time for once.&quot;</p><p>Mitsuzuri says some dangerous things.</p><p>...Come to think of it, I heard that Tohsaka has many enemies. Could Mitsuzuri be one of them?</p><hr><p>&quot;Hey Mitsuzuri, that&#39;s going too...&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh, it&#39;s almost time. Bye Emiya, come and see my archery skills sometime.&quot;</p><p>Mitsuzuri hurries off.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015She&#39;s just like always.&quot;</p><p>But I like that part of her.</p><p>Feeling calmer now, I head for the classroom.</p><hr><p>It&#39;s lunchtime.</p><p>Our school has a splendid cafeteria and most students eat there.</p><p>But there are some old-fashioned students who bring their own lunches. Two of them happen to be me and the student council president in front of me.</p><hr><p>&quot;Emiya, could you give me some of that fried chicken? My lunch is desperately lacking in meat.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Sure, but why is your lunch so plain? You live in a temple, but there aren&#39;t any teachings prohibiting meat or alcohol, right?\u201D</p><hr><p>&quot;Such an anachronism. It&#39;s just my father&#39;s way.</p><p>He says there&#39;s no luxurious foods for a young priest, and that I should have to work for what I want. I&#39;m thinking of running away and joining the circus.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh, yeah, that sounds like that guy.&quot;</p><hr><p>Issei&#39;s father is the priest of the Ryuudou Temple, and a bold guy who&#39;s old friends with the old man at Fuji-Nee&#39;s place.</p><p>You can&#39;t expect a normal personality when he&#39;s friends with a guy like that.</p><hr><p>&quot;That&#39;s great.

This too is part of my religious training.&quot;</p><p>Issei bows deeply.</p><p>...How can I put this? I never know what to say when things like this remind me that he&#39;s the son of a priest.</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh, by the way, Emiya. Did you know there was something going on around the 2nd avenue? It&#39;s right around the intersection where we part.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Intersection...?&quot;</p><p>The intersection this morning... he must mean that clamor with all the police cars.</p><hr><p>&quot;I heard there was a murder. I don&#39;t know the details, but of the family of four, only the child survived. They say the older sister and the parents were stabbed to death. But what&#39;s strange is that they think the weapon was a long one, not like a knife or something.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>A long weapon?

Unjust violence. A one-sided pillage like an accident. Slashed parents. The sister killed without even knowing what&#39;s going on. To the side, the child covered in their blood.</p><hr><p>&quot;Issei, have they caught the murderer?&quot;</p><p>&quot;It doesn&#39;t seem like it.

The guy who draws a line against his classmates and even his teachers is letting his guard down with Kuzuki.</p><hr><p>&quot;Maybe they get along because they&#39;re both so serious.&quot;</p><p>Kuzuki Souichirou, the teacher in charge of class 2-A, is serious and stubborn.</p><p>Probably that aspect helps him get along with Issei, who prizes order and discipline.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>The two continue to talk.</p><p>All the while, I can&#39;t get the story of the murder out of my head.</p><hr><h2 id="scene-08-tohsaka-rin-i" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#scene-08-tohsaka-rin-i" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Scene 08 - Tohsaka Rin(I)</h2><p>I&#39;m worried about the conversation I had this morning, so I&#39;ve made my way to the archery club before I knew it.</p><p>&quot;Geez, what am I doing?&quot;</p><p>According to Mitsuzuri, Tohsaka Rin comes here often.</p><p>Well, I really don&#39;t care about that, but I know that Shinji getting angry at her is going to be a problem.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Shinji just doesn&#39;t stop when he gets angry....&quot;</p><p>It&#39;s bad if Shinji gets violent just because she turned him down.</p><p>...I don&#39;t know why it&#39;s bad, it&#39;s just bad.</p><p>It makes me feel bad just thinking about it, so I have to stop it from happening.</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh, Tohsaka&#39;s not here.&quot;</p><p>Tohsaka isn&#39;t around.

You&#39;re playing an unrewarded role again. ...I don&#39;t really care, but you have a bad taste, Emiya.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;It&#39;s not unrewarded since I haven&#39;t done it. But Issei, didn&#39;t you say something strange?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Huh? You mean that going after Tohsaka is in bad taste?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Yeah. Tohsaka is really popular. I haven&#39;t heard any bad rumors about her.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes, none. And that&#39;s exactly what I don&#39;t like about it.&quot;</p><p>Issei looks away, snorting.</p><hr><p>&quot;What don&#39;t you like about it?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Everything. The woman is a fox, a schoolgirl, a monster. I just don&#39;t like her physiologically. I won&#39;t say anything bad, but you should try to hate her too.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Issei, don&#39;t you always say we shouldn&#39;t talk badly of people behind their backs?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Idiot, this doesn&#39;t count as talking behind their back. I&#39;m speaking so that she can hear it.&quot;</p><hr><p>Ah, no wonder I feel someone&#39;s eyes from the archery dojo.</p><p>...Thank God.</p><p>I&#39;m so glad Tohsaka is absent today.</p><hr><p>&quot;Please, Issei. Please restrict yourself to talking behind people&#39;s backs.&quot;</p><p>&quot;All right, if you say so.</p><p>But I wasn&#39;t insulting her at all. I was only saying that I&#39;m on guard against her. That should be within my rights.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;But you were saying things like monster and fox...&quot;</p><p>...And I think the term schoolgirl is discrimination.</p><hr><p>&quot;No, that was just praise. There are good foxes and monsters too.</p><p>I only applied the terms to describe Tohsaka.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Katsu.&quot;</p><p>Issei laughs.</p><hr><p>&quot;Well, I&#39;ll be going. I&#39;m going back to the student council room, but you&#39;re going to work, right? You shouldn&#39;t have time to play around like this.&quot;</p><hr><p>He must feel refreshed now that he&#39;s said everything he wanted, as he leaves calmly.</p><p>I&#39;ve known him for 2 years now, but I still don&#39;t understand his personality.</p><hr><p>Twenty minutes after taking the bus from my school, I arrive at the neighboring town of Shinto across the bridge.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Oh, it&#39;s not five o&#39;clock yet? I guess I still have some time.&quot;</p><p>Miyama City is a residential district, so it&#39;s hard to find part-time jobs there, but the developing Shinto has many available.</p><p>The school rules allow for part-time jobs, so I work a few easy ones.</p><hr><p>Within them, I prefer hard physical labor that ends as quickly as possible.</p><p>It&#39;s killing two birds with one stone, as it builds my body while I get paid for it.</p><hr><p>Today&#39;s job is a simple loading job from five to eight o&#39;clock.</p><p>Even though it&#39;s only three hours, there&#39;s six hours worth of work to do. They make you run around without a minute&#39;s rest.</p><hr><p>So I should rest when I can, even if it&#39;s just for ten minutes.</p><p>It&#39;s a waste of energy walking around until my job, so I guess I&#39;ll rest in the park.</p><hr><p>This park among the buildings is like a big field.</p><p>A park should be filled with people like families and lovers on weekends, but it&#39;s empty here now.</p><p>No... this place is always desolate.</p><hr><p>&quot;This place is the same as always.&quot;</p><p>I&#39;m a bit sad.</p><p>The utterly neglected ground looks awful compared to the neatly organized surroundings.</p><p>The desolate area makes the wind feel cold.</p><p>This is the remains of the conflagration ten years ago, and this is the place where I was saved from burning to death.</p><hr><p>&quot;I wonder why they don&#39;t plant grass here. It&#39;s a waste to keep it like this.&quot;</p><p>It&#39;s a large area, so if they retiled it, the park would get bigger.</p><p>Thinking absent-mindedly, I sit down on a bench.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>I stare at the burned land to pass the time.</p><p>I don&#39;t remember what happened here back then.</p><p>I probably don&#39;t remember because I was a kid, and it wouldn&#39;t have been an easy scene to memorize.</p><p>All I can remember is that it was hot and I couldn&#39;t breathe.</p><p>And that people died trying to save others.</p><hr><p>&quot;I wonder why....&quot;</p><p>For example, an adult that tried to save a child from a burning house. He saved the child, but died in its place.</p><p>For example, there were people who had their throats burned, but they gave what little water they had to one guy, and the others died.</p><p>For example, there was someone who ran alone to get away from the fire as fast as possible, and everyone that he passed on the way died.</p><hr><p>And for example...</p><p>People who died because they gave away something that was saving them, only to save others they didn&#39;t even know.</p><hr><p>&quot;......&quot;</p><p>I didn&#39;t like things like that.</p><p>It makes me mad that those who tried hard were sacrificed.</p><p>Am I greedy to want an ending where everybody is safe and happy?</p><p>All I wanted was to see people relax peacefully, so why couldn&#39;t I manage such a simple thing?</p><hr><p>&#39;That&#39;s difficult. What you want is to save everyone.&#39;</p><hr><p>Kiritsugu answered so to the question I asked as a child.</p><p>Of course, as a child, I denied it.</p><p>Because Kiritsugu saved me. I knew he was a sorcerer who could do anything.</p><p>I knew he was a superhero who couldn&#39;t ignore people in need, who saved them for no benefit.</p><p>So, I believed Kiritsugu could have saved everyone back then.</p><hr><p>When I told him that, he made a troubled expression and said something that I remember to this day.</p><hr><p>&#39;Shirou, saving one person means not saving another. Look, a superhero can only save the people he has saved. It&#39;s obvious, but that is the definition of a superhero.&#39;</p><hr><p>I understand that.</p><p>It&#39;s obvious, now that he&#39;s said it.</p><p>Let&#39;s say there&#39;s a robber and some hostages, and the robber intends to kill the hostages.</p><p>With normal methods, most of the hostages will be killed.</p><hr><p>Even if you use a miraculous method to save all the hostages, there will still be one person who isn&#39;t saved.</p><p>That, of course, is the robber whose hostages were rescued.</p><p>The people a superhero saves are only those he decides to save.</p><p>That&#39;s why even God cannot save everyone.</p><hr><p>&quot;All the more so if it&#39;s a natural disaster. No one could have saved everyone.&quot;</p><p>The fire ten years ago was like that.</p><p>It&#39;s not something I, who was miraculously saved from it, can talk about now.</p><hr><p>&quot;But I don&#39;t want that.&quot;</p><p>I don&#39;t want such a thing.</p><p>I don&#39;t want help that has a limited capacity.</p><p>You have to help, no matter how impossible it is.</p><p>I can&#39;t stand to have strangers dying around me like back then.</p><hr><p>So, if I had been there ten years ago, even if it was impossible, I would have gone into the fire and...</p><p>&quot;I would certainly have died in vain.&quot;</p><p>That&#39;s for certain.</p><p>Geez, I&#39;m hopeless.</p><hr><p>&quot;Gah, it&#39;s already five o&#39;clock.&quot;</p><p>The five o&#39;clock bell rings.</p><p>I stand up and quickly make my way to my work.</p><hr><p>When my job&#39;s done, the sun has already set.</p><p>It&#39;s a bit before eight.</p><p>I finished ten minutes early because I worked too hard.</p><p>It seems I worked frantically since I went to that place before work.</p><hr><p>Here in front of the station, the night&#39;s just getting started.</p><p>There are lots of people, and a constant flow of cars on the road.</p><p>The buildings are still lit up, and just looking at them makes me feel like I&#39;m watching a grand festival of illumination.</p><hr><p>&quot;I guess I don&#39;t have to buy anything for Fuji-Nee.&quot;</p><p>I walk while looking up at the lighted building.</p><p>It&#39;s the biggest building in Shinto, so I can&#39;t see the top clearly.</p><p>I just gaze up the building, just enjoying the night&#39;s scenery...</p><p>&quot;...?&quot;</p><p>...When I think I see something out of place.</p><hr><p>&quot;What was that?&quot;</p><p>I stop and stare at the rooftop.</p><p>I focus my eyes, looking at the thing as small as a grain of rice.</p><hr><p>&quot;...What the...&quot;</p><p>It looks like someone I know.</p><hr><p>Why is she there?</p><p>What would she be doing there?</p><p>With her long hair fluttering and doing nothing, she looks down at the town.</p><hr><p>&quot;......&quot;</p><p>It doesn&#39;t seem like she notices me down here.</p><p>No, there&#39;s no way she could see me.</p><p>She&#39;s so high up that I, with better eyesight than most, can barely see her by improving my vision with magical energy.</p><p>I can recognize her since she&#39;s standing there alone, but there&#39;s no way she would notice me down here among all these people.</p><hr><p>She&#39;s just looking down at the town.</p><p>Maybe she&#39;s looking for something, as I can feel her sharp stare even down here.</p><p>&quot;......&quot;</p><p>I forget about time and keep looking up at the girl standing in the sky.</p><p>She is on top of a tall tower.</p><p>She&#39;s like a witch, looking down at the earth with the moon behind her.</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh...&quot;</p><p>And then.</p><p>She must be done with whatever she was doing, as she disappears.</p><p>Her figure has disappeared and the scene returns to the beautiful view of the night.</p><p>&quot;That was Tohsaka, right?&quot;</p><hr><p>I have no proof, but I think I&#39;m right.</p><p>There aren&#39;t many girls with looks that stand out that much, and more than that, I&#39;m not stupid enough to mistake a girl I secretly admire.</p><hr><p>&quot;...I see.

Do you have some business here?&quot;</p><p>&quot;No, I have nothing to do here. I was just worried about you. You seemed a bit sick this morning.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;......&quot;</p><p>Sakura makes a gloomy face.</p><p>She&#39;s clearly not doing well.</p><hr><p>&quot;Sakura, if you don&#39;t feel well, you should go home.

I don&#39;t feel bad.</p><p>I&#39;m going to go to the club as usual and have dinner at your place after that.</p><p>I&#39;m okay, so please don&#39;t worry.&quot;</p><p>She picks up her bag and starts to walk like she&#39;s running away.</p><hr><p>&quot;Idiot, what are you saying with a face like that?

You know it&#39;s pointless to go to the club like that.&quot;</p><p>&quot;...You&#39;re right.

Oh yes. I know myself that I can&#39;t shoot right now.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;I see. So you&#39;re basically just preserving Shinji&#39;s authority.&quot;</p><p>I pull out a chair and sit on it.</p><p>I also pull another chair out from the desk next to it.</p><hr><p>&quot;Um... Senpai?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Just sit down. I won&#39;t try to stop you from going to the club, but rest for a while. You can tell Shinji I held you up and made you late.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;I-I can&#39;t say that...! If I do, Nii-san will, uh...&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Shinji messes with me all the time.</p><p>It&#39;s nice that he has something to talk about every day.</p><p>And it&#39;s not a lie, so you shouldn&#39;t feel guilty saying it.&quot;</p><p>I urge Sakura to sit down.</p><hr><p>&quot;......&quot;</p><p>Sakura sits down quietly.</p><hr><p>&quot;All right. Then, wait here for a while. I&#39;m going to go and steal some tea from the student council room. You&#39;re forbidden from standing up until I come back.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...Huh? But you might get into trouble...&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Only if a teacher finds me. Hey, I&#39;m used to this. There&#39;s no problem unless I run into a teacher in the hallway, so you can wait here.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I-I can&#39;t. I can&#39;t wait here while you&#39;re doing something dangerous. Senpai, I don&#39;t care about the tea.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;I&#39;m saying it&#39;s not dangerous. Just sit down. Drinking tea in the classroom is a good thing to try once.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh...&quot;</p><hr><p>I jump out into the hallway.</p><p>The student council room isn&#39;t far away.</p><p>I&#39;ll get the tea set quickly and surprise Sakura.</p><hr><p>...Time passes.</p><p>While we do something silly like drinking tea together in a classroom, we just stare outside.</p><p>Outside the window is a glowing sunset that hurts my eyes.</p><hr><p>&quot;......&quot;</p><p>Sakura stares blankly at the sunset.</p><p>I have nothing to talk about, so I follow Sakura&#39;s example and keep my mouth shut.</p><hr><p>Time passes slowly since we&#39;re not talking.</p><p>Sakura isn&#39;t the talkative type, and she often just stares at the scenery.</p><p>I guess she&#39;s more relaxed by herself.</p><p>Come to think of it, Sakura wants to be alone a lot.</p><p>It&#39;s not like she&#39;s excluding herself from the crowd, but she wants to isolate herself within the crowd. She looks outside the crowd more than in it.</p><hr><p>That must be why she stayed here in the classroom.</p><p>Sakura doesn&#39;t actively try to spend time with others.</p><p>Fuji-Nee and I are special.</p><p>Even I wouldn&#39;t have known her if I hadn&#39;t met Shinji.</p><hr><p>&quot;......&quot;</p><p>I sneak a glance at Sakura.</p><p>When Shinji introduced me to her 4 years ago, she was just a small girl.</p><p>Now she&#39;s my junior who comes to help around the house, and her childish image is disappearing.</p><hr><p>Sakura has grown beautiful.</p><p>...No, she was beautiful before, but I think she&#39;s become too beautiful as a member of the opposite sex.</p><p>On top of that, she&#39;s thoughtful and gentle.</p><p>With that many good qualities, I can understand her being called beautiful alongside Tohsaka Rin.</p><hr><p>&quot;......&quot;</p><p>But it&#39;s strange, I don&#39;t understand it.</p><p>Sakura is alone often.</p><p>She doesn&#39;t seem to have any friends in the archery club, and seeing how she&#39;s alone in this classroom, she might not have any friends in her class either.</p><hr><p>...Come to think of it, I only know Sakura from the archery club and from my place.</p><p>I don&#39;t know how she is at school or at home.</p><hr><p>&quot;......&quot;</p><p>While I think about this, looking up at the red sky...</p><p>&quot;Senpai, do you remember?&quot;</p><p>Looking outside, Sakura asks me a question.</p><hr><p>&quot;...? Remember what?&quot;</p><p>&quot;It was a long time ago, back before I met you...&quot;</p><p>&quot;Um, you mean before we knew each other...?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Yes. It was four years ago, right when I entered this school.</p><p>I wasn&#39;t used to the school, and I was walking about aimlessly when I saw something strange.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Yeah, I really wonder how it ended up like that.</p><p>Even though it was after school and the track team had left, someone was still running around alone. When I looked closer wondering what he was doing, I realized that he was doing high jumps by himself.&quot;</p><hr><p>A smile.</p><p>It must be a lovely memory, as Sakura is smiling happily.</p><hr><p>&quot;It was a really red sunset. Everything was red and beautiful, but so lonely.</p><p>In it, he just continued to run alone. Running, jumping, dropping the pole, and repeating. There was no one around and he clearly couldn&#39;t jump over it, but he kept on trying.</p><hr><p>&quot;It wasn&#39;t something that could be done with effort. The pole was way over his head.</p><p>Even I could tell that it was impossible, so he must have known as well.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...?&quot;</p><p>I understand, but I wonder what she&#39;s talking about.</p><p>I don&#39;t think it&#39;s strange to see someone practicing even after school.</p><hr><p>&quot;I was a bad girl back then. Something bad had happened to me, and I just wanted to take it out on someone. I wanted to see this person fail, give up, and be discouraged, so I kept watching him.</p><p>But he wouldn&#39;t give up.</p><p>He repeated it over and over, even though it was impossible for him. Not complaining at all for all that time.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...Wow. Maybe he was on the edge? Like the next day was the test, and he wouldn&#39;t get chosen unless he could jump that high?\u201D</p><hr><p>&quot;No, that wasn&#39;t it. He wasn&#39;t on the track team or anything.&quot;</p><p>Oh, I see.</p><p>...Well, that&#39;s fine... But why are you smiling, Sakura?</p><hr><p>&quot;And then, while I was watching him, I realized. He didn&#39;t care about what he was doing. He just happened to run into something he couldn&#39;t do, and he was obstinate about not losing.</p><p>The sun set, and he just cleaned up and went home. He must have been really tired, but he walked away calmly like nothing had happened.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;I don&#39;t get it. If he quit, that must mean he jumped over it, right? So how high was it?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Ahahaha, well, the thing is, he couldn&#39;t jump over it. He tried for 3 hours, but he was convinced at last that he couldn&#39;t jump over it.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Man, that&#39;s some ending.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;He was so earnest that I even worried about him.</p><p>He&#39;s probably someone very dependable.</p><p>But that made me feel uneasy and lonely.&quot;</p><p>Her voice itself sounds so lonely, it seems like it will be swallowed by the red in this room.</p><hr><p>&quot;Okay, I understand the story... But what about it, Sakura?&quot;</p><p>&quot;No, it&#39;s okay if you don&#39;t understand. That just means that even though it looked that way to me, it was just an everyday thing for him.&quot;</p><p>Despite her gloomy mood earlier, Sakura smiles sweetly.</p><hr><p>&quot;......&quot;</p><p>...And then, even though I&#39;m pretty dull, I understand when she puts it like that.</p><p>I don&#39;t remember it myself, but four years ago was right after my father died.</p><p>Back then, I did lots of reckless things, so I guess I did something like that.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Uh, Sakura, so that was...&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes, he is the senior before me now.</p><p>Back then, he was so small that I thought he was my age.&quot;</p><p>...Ugh.</p><p>I wish she wouldn&#39;t talk about my height back then.</p><p>Well, I&#39;m not that tall even now, but I did grow, you know?</p><hr><p>&quot;That&#39;s it. I&#39;ve known Senpai since then.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I-I see. That&#39;s the first time I heard that.&quot;</p><p>I look away. She saw me during an embarrassing moment.</p><hr><p>Then.</p><p>&quot;Yes, we were both looking at the same thing.&quot;</p><p>With a gesture like a prayer, Sakura says something strange.</p><hr><p>&quot;Huh...?&quot;</p><p>I ask, feeling worried.</p><p>But as if to drown it out, the familiar bell echoes through the school.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015Oh, the bell.&quot;</p><p>It&#39;s been thirty minutes since I stopped Sakura. The clock says four-thirty.</p><p>&quot;I guess I held you up too long. I&#39;ll clean up, so you can go on ahead. You feel better, right?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Yes, I feel great thanks to you. Please look forward to dinner tonight.&quot;</p><p>Sakura gets up.</p><p>It doesn&#39;t seem like she&#39;s bluffing as she really seems well.</p><hr><p>&quot;Yeah... oh, sorry Sakura. I have to go to work now. I&#39;ll be late today, so you don&#39;t have to push yourself to come to my place.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I understand. Then I&#39;ll just cook your dinner and leave.&quot;</p><p>Sakura bows and leaves.</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh well.&quot;</p><p>Fuji-Nee will be at my house, so she should be able to take Sakura home when she leaves.</p><p>I have to make a living too, so I should go to work quickly....</p><hr><h2 id="scene-13-trivial-changes" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#scene-13-trivial-changes" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Scene 13 - Trivial changes</h2><p>...My awakening is dark.</p><p>Perhaps I just don&#39;t dream much, but unless something really special happens, I always seem to have the same dream.</p><hr><p>...What I imagine are swords.</p><p>I don&#39;t know why it is, but this is the only thing that comes into my mind.</p><p>There&#39;s no meaning or reason to it.</p><p>It may just be one of the aspects making up Emiya Shirou.</p><hr><p>There are no dreams to dream.</p><p>The only things I recall from sleep are things I was taught a long time ago.</p><p>For example, about magi.</p><p>Even if I&#39;m an amateur, if I&#39;m a magus, it&#39;s only natural for me to understand the kind of world I live in.</p><hr><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015To put it simply, a magus is an exception in conflict with modern society.</p><p>But even exceptions must band together to survive.</p><p>Father told me that the group of magi is called the &quot;magecraft Association&quot;.</p><p>...He also said that I shouldn&#39;t associate with them.</p><hr><p>The group called the magecraft Association hides magecraft and organizes magi.</p><p>They basically keep watch to see that magi do not affect society with magecraft, but the strange part is that they do not prohibit misuse of magecraft.</p><hr><p>According to Kiritsugu, the magecraft Association is only interested in the concealment of magecraft.</p><p>Even if a magus carries out his research at the expense of the lives of many ordinary people, the magecraft Association will not punish him.</p><p>Their priority is that magecraft should not become public, so they do not ban magecraft.</p><p>So, they&#39;re crazy people who think you can do anything as long as you don&#39;t get caught.</p><hr><p>Anyway, the surveillance of the magecraft Association is thorough.</p><p>Most magical research would cost the lives of ordinary people, and as a result, the existence of magecraft would become public.</p><p>So, the Association does not allow research that would harm society.</p><hr><p>So magi stay at home and research quietly, while the normal world carries on unmolested.</p><p>Hence, magi only try to hide themselves to escape the Association.</p><p>...So perhaps I just don&#39;t know it, and a magus lives in this town.</p><hr><p>I hear Fuyuki City is a spiritually excellent area.</p><p>Such an area always has a distinguished magus with a history.</p><p>They are called the &quot;Second Owner&quot;, an elite, and the Association entrusts the area to them.</p><p>Magi who would live in the area must visit them and obtain their permission to construct a workshop.</p><hr><p>...Looking at it like that, we&#39;re thieves living here without the permission of the landlord.</p><p>Father was an outlaw who cut his ties with the Association and moved here without the consent of the administrator of Fuyuki.</p><hr><p>The Owner doesn&#39;t know that Emiya Kiritsugu was a magus, and Kiritsugu didn&#39;t know who the Owner was.</p><p>With reasoning like that, I think our position is ambiguous.</p><hr><p>Father, the real magus, has passed away.</p><p>And I, his son and pupil, don&#39;t know the magecraft Association and have not the skill to be a magus.</p><p>...From the Association&#39;s point of view, they would want to catch an amateur like me doing things, but I&#39;ve seen no movement yet.</p><p>No, I&#39;ve heard that Japan is relatively hidden from the eyes of the Association, so I think I&#39;ve just not been found out.</p><hr><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015But that doesn&#39;t mean I can let my guard down.</p><p>People say that the eyes of the Association are everywhere. On top of that, if you commit a crime with magecraft, the heretic hunters of the church will come after you.</p><p>...That just means that whatever you use magecraft for, lack of care will create enemies.</p><p>I, Emiya Shirou, just have to study independently, taking that into account\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>&quot;...Hm.&quot;</p><p>I wake up to see the sun shining in through the window.</p><p>The sun may have just risen as it&#39;s still a bit dark outside.</p><p>&quot;...Hm. I&#39;m really not good in the mornings.&quot;</p><p>I get up, trying not to be defeated by the morning chill, and quickly fold up my futon.</p><hr><p>It&#39;s five thirty.</p><p>One of my strengths is waking up at this time, no matter how late I go to sleep. I do sometimes make mistakes and wake up late like yesterday, but I usually wake up early.</p><p>I think alarm clocks are degenerate, so I haven&#39;t used one since I was a kid.</p><hr><p>&quot;Alright, breakfast...&quot;</p><p>Since I let Sakura do all the work yesterday, I have to return the favor this morning.</p><p>I should finish preparing before Sakura arrives.</p><hr><p>I cook rice and make some miso soup.</p><p>It was radish and carrot yesterday, so I make onion and potato miso soup today.</p><p>I also make the usual broth egg and broth boil, and I&#39;m done.</p><p>I cut and salt the saury, and stop just before cooking it.</p><hr><p>&quot;All right, that should do.&quot;</p><p>It&#39;s almost six o&#39;clock.</p><p>I finished earlier than expected, so I have some extra time.</p><p>So, what should I do?</p><hr><ol><li><p>I&#39;ll do my daily routine at the dojo.</p></li><li><p>I&#39;ll make one more side dish since Sakura&#39;s coming.</p></li></ol><hr><h2 id="scene-14-old-man" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#scene-14-old-man" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Scene 14 - Old man</h2><p>I return to Miyama City.</p><p>Unlike Shinto, it&#39;s really quiet here as if it were midnight already.</p><hr><p>&quot;I wonder if Sakura&#39;s okay.&quot;</p><p>She seemed to be feeling better, but since she came to my place to make dinner, I think I&#39;ve made her push herself again.</p><hr><p>&quot;I guess I&#39;ll go check on her.&quot;</p><p>It&#39;s not like I&#39;ll achieve anything by going to her house now, but it should make me feel better than doing nothing.</p><hr><p>There&#39;s nothing wrong at her house.</p><p>There&#39;s no sign of the &quot;strange foreigner&quot; Sakura was talking about, and the lights are on only in Sakura and Shinji&#39;s rooms as usual.</p><hr><p>&quot;Huh?&quot;</p><p>...Wait a minute.</p><p>Then what was that light yesterday? Was there someone other than Sakura and Shinji in the house?</p><hr><p>&quot;Excuse me. Do you need something?&quot;</p><p>&quot;...!?&quot;</p><p>I spin around.</p><p>...In the darkness of the night, as if hiding in the sound of the bugs, a figure is standing.</p><hr><p>He&#39;s an unfamiliar old man.</p><p>He must be really old, but he has sharp eyes and a presence that doesn&#39;t match his small body.</p><p>Perhaps it is the difference in the years we have lived, but he has a dignity that pressures me.</p><hr><p>&quot;What is wrong, young one, why don&#39;t you answer? If you don&#39;t answer, I shall jump to conclusions. Hmm, so, can I assume you&#39;re the stranger Sakura was talking about?&quot;</p><p>Sakura...?</p><p>...Then, could this person be....</p><hr><p>&quot;Geez. Since it is my granddaughter&#39;s wish, I can&#39;t just let you go. I&#39;m sorry, but I will have to hurt you a bit.</p><p>Just to be sure, you don&#39;t intend to hand yourself over to the police graciously?&quot;</p><hr><p>The unknown old man asks me such a question.</p><p>T-There&#39;s no mistake.</p><p>This is the first time I&#39;ve met him, but he must be...</p><hr><p>&quot;Ah... no, you&#39;ve got it wrong...! My name is Emiya Shirou. I&#39;m in the same class as Shinji, and I&#39;m an acquaintance of Sakura, and I just came to see how they were doing...!&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh. I see, you&#39;re their friend. Then I&#39;m sorry for stopping you. Well, I can go and get them. Or would you like to have dinner with us?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;N-No, I was just stopping by, so I&#39;ll be going. By the way, is Sakura home already?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Zouken.&quot;</p><p>The old man says an unfamiliar word.</p><hr><p>&quot;Huh?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Matou Zouken. It is wrong for me to not name myself when you have done so.&quot;</p><p>Matou Zouken says so and walks toward the entrance.</p><p>It seems like he doesn&#39;t care about me any more.</p><p>&quot;......&quot;</p><p>Overwhelmed, I see him off without a word.</p><hr><p>...And then.</p><p>&quot;Sakura is home.</p><p>More importantly, Emiya Shirou. Is the daughter of the Einzberns doing well?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...Huh? Ein-what?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Do not play dumb. It is natural for the daughter of the Einzberns to go and see Emiya. I am asking you how well it is this time around.&quot;</p><p>&quot;...???&quot;</p><p>Um, I don&#39;t understand at all.</p><p>...I&#39;m sorry Sakura, but your old man is pretty hard to deal with.</p><hr><p>&quot;......Hm, it seems you really don&#39;t know.&quot;</p><p>Zouken sighs.</p><p>He looks so shocked that I feel kind of sorry for him.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Well, I don&#39;t really understand, but I&#39;m sorry.&quot;</p><p>&quot;No, no, it&#39;s nothing you should feel bad about. It was a mistake on my part. I&#39;m sorry to bore you with such things.</p><p>Here, if you want to see my grandchildren, do not hesitate. The old man will go away, so please do not reserve yourself.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Um, no, I really just stopped by today. ...But, um... do you live here?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I do. But as you can see, I am old. So I just lie in the rear tatami room all the time.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;......&quot;</p><p>...I see.</p><p>I came to their house until about a year ago, but it seemed then that no one other than Sakura and Shinji lived there.</p><hr><p>&quot;Then excuse me, Emiya Shirou. Please stay friends with my grandchildren.&quot;</p><p>Despite his appearance, he leaves with light footsteps.</p><p>There is no change in the house.</p><p>But the sound of the bugs has suddenly stopped.</p><hr><p>...The day ends.</p><p>Finishing a rowdy dinner and seeing Fuji-Nee off, I take a bath.</p><p>After that, I practice my daily routine in the shed.</p><p>I complete it as usual and go to sleep.</p><p>It is one in the morning.</p><p>The day ends peacefully with no troubles.</p><hr><h2 id="scene-15-morning-in-the-emiya-household" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#scene-15-morning-in-the-emiya-household" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Scene 15 - Morning in the Emiya household</h2><p>&quot;Good morning, Senpai. Have you finished preparing breakfast already?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yeah, breakfast is done. All that&#39;s left is setting up the table and cooking the fish.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh, I&#39;ll help then. I&#39;ll prepare the dishes.&quot;</p><hr><p>Sakura is cheerful.</p><p>And behind that admirable junior...</p><p>&quot;Oh, this is the smell of Shirou&#39;s omelet. I see, you&#39;re making breakfast this morning.&quot;</p><p>Fuji-Nee moves slowly to the table.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Well, that aside...&quot;</p><p>First, I have to cook the fish I&#39;ve prepared.</p><p>&quot;Sakura, can you use the dishes in the middle? That will make it look better.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Huh.....? Um, this one with bumps?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Yeah, that. You have to think about the plates too or you&#39;ll be too one-sided. Oh, and the radish is already grated.&quot;</p><p>Sakura takes out a dish from the back.</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>I think I saw a faint bruise on her wrist when she leaned forward.</p><hr><p>&quot;Hold on, Sakura.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes, what is it Senpai?&quot;</p><p>&quot;What&#39;s that mark on your wrist?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh...&quot;</p><p>She looks away awkwardly.</p><p>And that tells me who caused that bruise.</p><hr><p>&quot;Shinji again, huh? What does he think he&#39;s doing, beating on his sister...!?&quot;</p><p>&quot;T-That&#39;s not it, Senpai...! Um, well... I fell and hurt myself. I&#39;m a bit slow, you know?</p><p>So I fall and get hurt a lot.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Don&#39;t be stupid. How can you get a bruise like that from falling over? It seems Shinji isn&#39;t tired of getting beat up yet...!&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;N-No, Senpai...! This doesn&#39;t have anything to do with Nii-san. I really did this myself, so you can&#39;t get mad.&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>Sakura falls silent.</p><p>...Sakura looks calm, but she is pretty obstinate. It&#39;s useless to say anything to her now.</p><hr><p>&quot;...All right. If you say so, I&#39;ll leave it at that. But if I see it again, I won&#39;t be able to hold back.&quot;</p><p>&quot;...Yes. I&#39;m sorry, Senpai.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Why are you apologizing? It&#39;s Shinji&#39;s fault.&quot;</p><p>&quot;......&quot;</p><p>At the mention of Shinji&#39;s name, Sakura looks away awkwardly.</p><hr><p>In other words, he is the cause of that bruise.</p><p>Matou Shinji has a bad habit of being hard on his sister, Sakura.</p><p>I first noticed it about a year ago.</p><p>Sakura was injured sometimes, and she just evaded my question when I asked about it.</p><p>When I asked Shinji about it, of all things, he said he was the one who hit Sakura.</p><hr><p>When I asked him why he hit her, he said that he just hit her because he felt like it.</p><p>After that, I got pissed and did to Shinji what he did to Sakura.</p><p>Since then, we&#39;ve been estranged.</p><p>I still don&#39;t regret punching him.</p><p>But I think it&#39;s my fault that Sakura is being treated worse.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Senpai, did you... um, work things out with Nii-san?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Huh? Yeah, I did. We didn&#39;t have a fight or anything, so it&#39;s not like there was anything to work out.&quot;</p><p>&quot;...Uh, it might be like that for you, but Nii-san thinks you guys got in a fight. So... well, please be careful.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Hm?&quot;</p><p>Sakura says strange things sometimes.</p><p>&quot;Be careful... you mean, of Shinji?&quot;</p><p>&quot;...Yes. I think Nii-san thinks of you as an enemy... um, and he thinks that you quit the club because of him....&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;That&#39;s not true. Me quitting the club had nothing to do with Shinji. Well, maybe a bit, but it&#39;s still not something you should worry about. Like Shinji says, this is certainly indecent.&quot;</p><p>I point at my right shoulder.</p><p>There&#39;s a scar there.</p><hr><p>It happened a year and a half ago.</p><p>A shipment collapsed on me during work and I hurt my right shoulder. I got out with just a broken bone, but the shipment was a hazardous one and I got a burn on my skin.</p><hr><p>After that accident, I quit the archery club.</p><p>My school archery club emphasizes formalities as they let us shoot formally even as students.</p><p>The men expose their right shoulder when they shoot.</p><p>Shinji commented that it might be indecent for someone shooting formally to have a scar on their shoulder. Since I was getting busy with work, I quit the archery club right then.</p><hr><p>&quot;Um, Senpai? I might be persistent, but are you really not shooting anymore? Fujimura-Sensei said your injury shouldn&#39;t be a problem.&quot;</p><p>&quot;What are you saying!? Fuji-Nee wouldn&#39;t think it&#39;s a problem even if I broke every bone in my body.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Senpai, I&#39;m being serious.&quot;</p><p>Sakura glances up at me, like she wants to say something.</p><p>&quot;...Hmm.&quot;</p><p>I should answer seriously too, but I can&#39;t give her the answer she wants.</p><hr><p>&quot;I don&#39;t have time to do club activities for now. I like archery, but it&#39;s not something I prioritize, so I&#39;m taking some time off from it.&quot;</p><p>&quot;...How long is &#39;some time&#39;?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I guess until I feel like it. Well, I&#39;ll try to make it back before you graduate. Welcome me then, Sakura.&quot;</p><p>I pat Sakura&#39;s shoulder.</p><hr><p>Sakura stares blankly for a while, and then...</p><p>&quot;Oh, yes...! I&#39;ll be waiting, Senpai!&quot;</p><p>And she nods so powerfully that it seems she might drop the plates she&#39;s holding.</p><hr><h2 id="scene-16-pipeline" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#scene-16-pipeline" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Scene 16 - Pipeline</h2><p>Classes end and it&#39;s time to go home.</p><p>I cannot go anywhere as I have work today.</p><p>I should leave school and go straight to the neighboring town, but...</p>', 1513);
