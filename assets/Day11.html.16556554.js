You&#39;ll still grow.&quot;</p><p>&quot;...I&#39;m glad to hear that, but what&#39;s the reasoning behind that?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Huh? Um, well... you have a firm build, so you&#39;ll grow if you get the right nutrition, right? I thought you&#39;d grow if you used photosynthesis.&quot;</p><p>&quot;What plant are you talking about? Don&#39;t treat me like some kind of a flower.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh. Are you mad...?&quot;</p><p>&quot;No. I&#39;ll ignore it. ...Well, I guess I can look forward to it if you say so.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Yeah.

You have my guarantee on that, Shirou.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Wha\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>W-Why does she have to say such an embarrassing thing!?</p><hr><p>&quot;Hah, you&#39;re so embarrassed. I like you since your emotions show up on your face.&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015!&quot;</p><p>S-She&#39;s playing around with me.</p><p>She&#39;s definitely playing around with me.</p><hr><p>&quot;Guh, you evil woman! Is it fun to tease a guy your own age!?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Of course. It would depend on who, but your reactions are great.&quot;</p><p>......God.</p><p>Please show her your wrath with divine punishment.</p><p>Not just for my sake, but for the sake of all the guys at my school.</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh, let&#39;s stop playing around with Shirou and get on with the date. Do you want to let some stress out before lunch?&quot;</p><p>She fists her hand and swings it.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Could it be...?&quot;</p><p>I&#39;m sure of it. She&#39;s making &quot;that&quot; gesture.</p><p>But would a girl come out and say she wants to go to such a place...?</p><hr><p>&quot;It&#39;s a batting cage, of course. Don&#39;t tell me you don&#39;t know it.&quot;</p><p>The (former) school idol asks me seriously.</p><hr><p>&quot;Of course I know!</p><p>What I want to say is that batting cages aren&#39;t for girls\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>Saying that, I imagine Tohsaka going into the batter&#39;s box.</p><hr><p>&quot;............&quot;</p><p>...Crap. It does look strange, but why does she seem so reliable?</p><hr><p>&quot;What, do you want to go to an aquarium instead? I think they had penguin army versus the giant seal, the flaming freezing match, but it&#39;s a third rate attraction.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>I think it&#39;s second-rate, but I don&#39;t know about going to an aquarium when it&#39;s so sunny out.</p><hr><p>&quot;Rin. What is this batting you are talking about?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Huh? Well, it&#39;s something you should be good at. It&#39;s an integration of all your physique, considered to be training in some cases.&quot;</p><p>Wow.</p><p>Tohsaka&#39;s putting it in a ridiculous way.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015Hm. I cannot ignore that.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yeah, you should try it since it feels so good. I bet you&#39;ll be able to win all the prizes there.&quot;</p><p>She agitates Saber irresponsibly and starts walking again.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Sigh.&quot;</p><p>I watch her, then run after her since it can&#39;t be helped.</p><p>There&#39;s no point arguing against Tohsaka&#39;s energy.</p><p>I can&#39;t stop her, and I also kind of like being pulled around like this.</p><hr><p>So that&#39;s what it means.</p><p>My nervousness went away because it&#39;s fun.</p><p>I was taken to many places without rest, and my anxiety was gone before I knew it.</p><p>Tohsaka urges me to go to the next place, I respond reluctantly, and Saber quietly watches over us.</p><hr><p>...It was really fun.</p><p>The town I only used to walk by...</p><p>I didn&#39;t know all the things I didn&#39;t involve myself in were so meaningful.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>As soon as I think so, something like a cage falls on me, and I understand.</p><p>I don&#39;t deserve this.</p><p>I&#39;m unworthy of all this.</p><p>It tells me so from deep down within me.</p><hr><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015I-I&#39;m tired.</p><p>I never expected to play five games, with thirty balls each game, for a total of 150 swings.</p><p>It&#39;s all because...</p><hr><p>&quot;W-What is it, Shirou? It is troubling if you look at me like that.&quot;</p><p>...She hated losing.</p><hr><p>&quot;That was a miscalculation... I didn&#39;t think Saber would be so concerned about winning.&quot;</p><p>Tohsaka sighs next to me.</p><p>She also...</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh, I&#39;ll only play one game. My hands will get rough if I swing the bat too much.&quot;</p><p>...Said something like that, but ended up playing another game with Saber, and ended up complaining afterwards about how her shoulders and hands were tired.</p><hr><p>&quot;What are you saying? You only played twice. I played five times. And with the fastest speed too!</p><p>...Man. Saber would get mad if I went easy and sulk if I beat her too bad. It was a hellish hour.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;I-I did not sulk! I was only filled with spirit. First of all, this is nothing compared to the fights in the dojo. It is your fault for getting that tired.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;I get it. Saber&#39;s one that gets mad when she gets beaten in games, huh?&quot;</p><p>I sigh and wobble on.</p><hr><p>So here&#39;s what I found out today. One, do not gamble with Saber.</p><p>Two, a rule where the winner is the one to have ten more hits than the opponent can end up in an infinite hell if the ones playing are at about the same level.</p><p>And lastly, Saber is physically weaker than us if she does not use her magical energy.</p><hr><p>...Or rather, is Tohsaka the strange one for hitting back 120kmph balls like nothing?</p><p>It&#39;s natural since Saber is the smallest one out of all of us, but I guess Tohsaka is rather strong for a girl.</p><hr><p>&quot;How rude. Batting doesn&#39;t equal strength.</p><p>Even a girl can hit if the swing speed and the angles are right.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Well, that&#39;s for one or two pitches. The problem is after that. Your arm would usually cramp up. Do you do push-ups or something before you go to bed? That&#39;s the only reason I can think of.&quot;</p><p>My voice is heavy with sarcasm.</p><p>But.</p><hr><p>&quot;...I-I do. What? Is that bad?&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Uh, no. ...Nice.&quot;</p><p>She replies like that, so I&#39;m the one that gets beat.</p><hr><p>&quot;L-Let&#39;s have lunch. It&#39;s past two already. I&#39;m starting to get dizzy since I haven&#39;t eaten.&quot;</p><p>A family restaurant by the bridge should be a good place around here.</p><p>There are lots of choices on the menu, so I&#39;m sure Saber won&#39;t complain.</p><hr><p>&quot;Is that fine with you, Tohsaka? It&#39;s not like you had a plan on where to go eat, right?&quot;</p><p>I call out to Tohsaka.</p><hr><p>&quot;I-I do have a plan. I have it all planned out.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh, okay. So where is this place you want to go to?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;......Here.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Huh? What do you mean by that?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I mean here. It&#39;s so sunny out, so we&#39;re gonna eat here in the park.&quot;</p><hr><p>...I look around.</p><p>I don&#39;t see any cafe, nor even a hotdog stand.</p><hr><p>&quot;Tohsaka. Don&#39;t tell me you&#39;re going to get delivery or something.&quot;</p><p>&quot;...Hey now. What do you think is in that tote bag you&#39;ve been carrying all this time?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Huh\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015?&quot;</p><hr><p>Oh.</p><p>Come to think of it, she did hand me a bag to carry this morning.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Hm. This kind of smells like mustard. So this must be...&quot;</p><p>&quot;It&#39;s lunch, of course. Didn&#39;t I tell you that I prepared some?&quot;</p><hr><p>She glares at me.</p><p>...I think she did say something like that.</p><hr><p>&quot;Wow, I&#39;m surprised. I didn&#39;t think you would put so much effort into this.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Of course I would. I invited you, so I prepared accordingly.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh, the mystery&#39;s solved now. You used the bread for this, huh?</p><p>I thought you ate it because you got hungry at night. It sounds like too much to eat a whole loaf, but I thought it might be possible in your case.&quot;</p><hr><p>Wow, everything&#39;s solved now.</p><p>There are no more worries on my chest now.</p><p>&quot;Oh.&quot;</p><p>When I look back up, Tohsaka is making a scary face.</p><hr><p>&quot;Emiya-kun?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Y-Yes? What is it, Tohsaka?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Can you stop talking and start preparing for lunch? Everything&#39;s in that tote bag. Oh, and I&#39;ll kill you if you&#39;re too slow.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015yes, I&#39;ll do my best.&quot;</p><hr><p>I quickly make a space on the grass.</p><p>...Man, that was scary.</p><p>It&#39;s bad for my heart to have her say something that doesn&#39;t sound like a joke with that big smile...</p><hr><p>So.</p><p>Lunch starts two hours late.</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh, what&#39;s wrong, Shirou? Why are you spaced out?</p><p>...Oh, do you hate spicy food?&quot;</p><p>She&#39;s right next to me.</p><p>Tohsaka says so from a close distance.</p><p>&quot;Eh\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015no, it&#39;s fine. It&#39;s really strong, but this is good.&quot;</p><p>I say so and take another bite.</p><hr><p>&quot;Really? That&#39;s good. It&#39;s a talent to be able to make a bad sandwich, right? I thought for a second I got that useless talent.&quot;</p><p>Tohsaka laughs.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>If I looked spaced out, it&#39;s probably because she&#39;s dazzling to my eyes.</p><hr><p>We&#39;re eating lunch on the grass under the clear blue sky.</p><p>This is peaceful enough, but it&#39;s too much once Tohsaka&#39;s added to the picture, and my nervousness is returning.</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh, you have a piece of tomato on your lip. Should I get it off for you?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Bu...! W-W-W-W-W-What are you saying!? I can do it myself!&quot;</p><p>I wipe my mouth with my sleeve.</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh.&quot;</p><p>...Crap.</p><p>I got a red stain on my sleeve now.</p><hr><p>&quot;Geez, I guess I played around too much. I&#39;m sorry, it was too funny because you gave me the exact reaction I wanted.&quot;</p><hr><p>Tohsaka hands me a napkin. I don&#39;t know if she&#39;s laughing or apologizing.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Heh. I don&#39;t care. It&#39;s been like this all day today.&quot;</p><p>I take the napkin and wipe my sleeve with it.</p><p>The red stain isn&#39;t coming out.</p><p>...Hm. Looks like Tohsaka&#39;s using some original sauce.</p><p>The stain is in there and doesn&#39;t look like it&#39;ll come out easily.</p><hr><p>&quot;But just you watch. I&#39;m going to learn from today&#39;s experience and be less perturbed starting tomorrow. Don&#39;t think it&#39;ll go your way forever.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh. Does that mean I don&#39;t have to hold back starting tomorrow?</p><p>That&#39;s good. I was getting bored with putting a mask on.&quot;</p><p>The red devil smiles back.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Uh, I take that back. It&#39;ll take some time, so it&#39;ll help me if you keep it as it is now.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Really? If you say so. But tell me when you want me to go to the next level, okay? I&#39;ll knock you out without reservation.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Damn. I&#39;ll get you someday.&quot;</p><p>I&#39;m not making excuses, but it sounds like an excuse.</p><p>...It&#39;s somehow really vexing, so I decide to take it out on the sandwich in front of me.</p><hr><p>I eat the sandwiches.</p><p>I was hungry and it&#39;s Tohsaka&#39;s handmade meal, so I&#39;m going to eat all of it myself.</p><p>...Well, actually, Saber already ate about a third of it.</p><hr><p>So Saber and I munch down the sandwiches.</p><p>Tohsaka must be full, as she just stares at us.</p><hr><p>&quot;Your body seems to be doing well. I guess I don&#39;t have to hold back in the afternoon.&quot;</p><hr><p>She makes an evil smile again.</p><p>It&#39;s that smile.</p><p>She&#39;s more looking forward to seeing me worn out then what she&#39;s actually going to do.</p><hr><p>&quot;Heh, don&#39;t take me too lightly. I won&#39;t be exhausted just by having you pull me around. With yesterday aside, I&#39;ve been doing well all day today.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;I see. Then I guess you&#39;re all right.&quot;</p><p>Tohsaka sighs with relief and reaches out for a sandwich.</p><p>It&#39;s as if she&#39;s saying her burden&#39;s gone now.</p><hr><p>&quot;......?&quot;</p><p>The moment I wonder why she said that...</p><p>&quot;Oh.&quot;</p><p>Everything fits together.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>Come to think of it, it was really unnatural.</p><p>The reason Tohsaka came to my house...</p><p>Archer knew about my body.</p><p>He must have heard that I projected his swords and knew that there&#39;s something wrong with my body.</p><hr><p>That&#39;s fine.</p><p>But Archer, the one who wasn&#39;t there at that time, knew about the projection because Tohsaka told him about it.</p><p>Then.</p><p>As Tohsaka told Archer about our battle against Caster, wouldn&#39;t Archer tell Tohsaka about the penalty on my body\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015?</p><hr><p>&quot;Tohsaka.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Uh, what?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Why did you come to my house yesterday? And it&#39;s strange for you to stay over. I didn&#39;t notice all this yesterday because of Fuji-Nee.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>A brief moment.</p><p>But I hear Tohsaka gasp.</p><hr><p>&quot;I don&#39;t have a reason. It was just a whim. I thought that it might be fun once in a while.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I see. It was certainly fun last night.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Right?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yeah. But thank you.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015!&quot;</p><p>Wow.</p><p>She turned red in an instant.</p><hr><p>&quot;W-W-W-W-What are you thinking...!? I-I wasn&#39;t concerned about you\u2015\u2015\u2015!&quot;</p><p>&quot;I know, it&#39;s not good to have your ally die. That&#39;s why you came to check up on me, right?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Uh... T-That&#39;s right. You&#39;re pretty smart.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yeah. But I&#39;m still thankful.</p><p>I don&#39;t know what your intentions were, but I&#39;m sure you cared for me.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;......&quot;</p><p>She groans in dissatisfaction.</p><p>Her gesture&#39;s so cute that it makes me smile.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015I see, I get it.&quot;</p><p>I kind of understand now how Tohsaka feels.</p><p>It feels really great embarrassing someone you like.</p><hr><p>The weather changes once we finish lunch.</p><p>The sky is filled with clouds, and it looks like it could start raining any moment now.</p><hr><p>&quot;...I guess it can&#39;t be helped. We don&#39;t have any umbrellas, so let&#39;s go home.&quot;</p><p>There&#39;s no objection.</p><p>It&#39;s Tohsaka who started this, so it&#39;s her duty to finish it as well.</p><hr><h2 id="scene-05" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#scene-05" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Scene 05</h2><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>I nod.</p><p>I mentally apologize to Tohsaka, who is staring at me, and obey Caster.</p><hr><p>&quot;</p><p>!&quot;</p><p>Saber looks away at my choice.</p><hr><p>&quot;......&quot;</p><p>Tohsaka doesn&#39;t say anything.</p><p>We promised to beat Caster together, but she doesn&#39;t yell at me and just bites her lip.</p><hr><p>&quot;That&#39;s a smart decision, boy. That is what I expect from a Master chosen by the Holy Grail. This is a battle you have no chance of winning. It is best for you to obey me.&quot;</p><hr><p>...Caster raises her arm.</p><p>The fingers that were grabbing Fuji-Nee&#39;s neck go for my heart.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Hold on. Promise me one thing before you do as you wish.&quot;</p><p>&quot;......Fine. It doesn&#39;t seem like you understand your position, but I will listen. What compensation do you want, boy?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...It&#39;s Tohsaka. You sound like you want to kill Tohsaka. Promise me you will not lay a hand on her until she gets home.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Shirou.&quot;</p><hr><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015Caster doesn&#39;t answer.</p><p>The purple-robed figure stares at me without moving, and...</p><hr><p>&quot;Fuh\u2015\u2015\u2015fufu, ahahahahahahahaha!</p><p>I was wondering what you would say, but you obeyed me for such a thing!? That is wonderful, boy! How many years has it been since I laughed so hard...!?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...What&#39;s so funny, Caster?</p><p>It&#39;s a stupid condition all right, but you have no right to laugh at Shirou.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Yes, you&#39;re right, little lady. You are the only one that can laugh at him. That is why this condition is acceptable.</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015All right. I was going to kill her here, but I shall make an exception and let her live. It is a wish of my ally. It is sad if I don&#39;t grant it.&quot;</p><hr><p>The magus laughs.</p><p>Glaring at her, Tohsaka slowly retreats.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Tohsaka.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Goodbye. It was going to end up like this anyway. We&#39;ll be enemies next time we meet, Emiya-kun.&quot;</p><p>...I hear her leaving footsteps</p><p>Before they disappear...</p><hr><p>&quot;Well\u2015\u2015\u2015the farce ends here, boy.&quot;</p><p>...The magus&#39;s finger cuts out my mind.</p><hr><p>...I&#39;m in a deep darkness.</p><p>I don&#39;t know how many hours have passed.</p><p>I&#39;m trying to count to keep track of time, but I can&#39;t think of any number above ten.</p><p>...Everything is vague.</p><p>I don&#39;t feel my limbs, and it&#39;s calm as if I&#39;m floating on water.</p><p>Algae must have filled up my skull, and I want to laugh at this darkness.</p><p>&quot;......&quot;</p><p>Saber looks away every time I see her.</p><p>I think we obtained the Holy Grail quite some time ago.</p><p>But she doesn&#39;t seem happy at all, and she repeats &quot;I am sorry&quot; every time I see her.</p><p>&quot;How do you feel, Shirou? We obtained the Holy Grail thanks to you. Tell me if there&#39;s anything you want. I can create anything for you, even if it is Saber or that girl.&quot;</p><p>...Something I want, something I want...</p><p>Nothing comes to mind. I&#39;ve never wanted anything, and even if I did want something, it does me no good now.</p><p>If anything, I want a colder place.</p><p>A deep darkness that will freeze the algae in my skull and make me want to start dancing.</p><p>&quot;Long time no see, Emiya-kun. I finally found you.&quot;</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015I hear a familiar voice.</p><hr><p>&quot;Caster was right. You were turned into that to let me go.

We can&#39;t move right now.&quot;</p><p>She&#39;ll be killed if any one of us moves.</p><p>I&#39;ll lose the person that was with me until now, a person that is like an older sister to me.</p><p>I can&#39;t allow that.</p><hr><p>&quot;...But Shirou.&quot;</p><p>&quot;...You idiot.

How unfair, are you going to kill Shirou when he is not resisting!?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Of course not. I will not take his life. I am just going to take his rights as a Master.

I can transplant it if there is no intrusion, but I don&#39;t think I can wish for that here. Transplanting it would be impossible unless we go to a better place. So...&quot;</p><hr><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Cut that arm off here.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>The black witch says so with a smile.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015That is it.</p><p>Shirou, please give up on Taiga. I cannot let Caster do as she wishes...!&quot;</p><p>&quot;I feel the same way. First of all, she&#39;s not one to release a hostage. She&#39;ll use you until the very end if you obey her.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>The two have a point.</p><p>So I can only apologize to them in my head.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Take it.

There&#39;s no need to go that far to save someone else!&quot;</p><p>&quot;There is. If I can save Fuji-Nee at the cost of just one arm, I don&#39;t even need to think about it.&quot;</p><p>I point my left arm at Caster.</p><hr><p>&quot;...All right. Come here, Emiya Shirou.</p><p>I don&#39;t know what you&#39;re intending, but my finger is faster than any of your surprise attacks.&quot;</p><p>Caster still must not trust me, as she puts some distance between us.</p><hr><p>&quot;.........&quot;</p><p>I walk to her.</p><p>...Caster&#39;s right in front of me, and the other two are far away from me.</p><p>I walk to the place where I won&#39;t be able to get away and hold out my arm.</p><hr><p>&quot;Ha\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>The black witch watches me in astonishment.</p><hr><p>&quot;Haha.

Fine, I shall give you back this woman in deference to your good faith!&quot;</p><p>Her robe flutters.</p><p>Caster keeps a hold of Fuji-Nee with her left hand and takes out a strange dagger with her right.</p><hr><p>&quot;This is amazing. I didn&#39;t need to go through so much trouble if it was going to be like this!</p><p>You really are a stupid boy. You are annoying, so a softhearted person like you should die...!&quot;</p><p>She swings her dagger.</p><p>It goes not for my arm, but my heart, and\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>&quot;Caster\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015!&quot;</p><p>She explodes.</p><p>Saber charges in with such speed that I thought she exploded.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015!?&quot;</p><p>The speed must have been faster than Caster expected, as her dagger is repelled.</p><p>Caster retreats and Saber follows her.</p><p>She must have figured out that she can&#39;t get away.</p><hr><p>&quot;I see, then\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>Smiling happily, Caster puts power into her right hand and\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015No, stop, Saber...!!!!&quot;</p><p>I pray from the bottom of my heart and reach out with my left arm.</p><hr><p>&quot;Wha\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015you used your Command Spell\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015?&quot;</p><p>Saber stops.</p><p>Her movements are stopped by the absolute obedience enforced by the Command Spell.</p><hr><p>There,[r]</p><p>the dagger is stabbed as easily as making footprints in snow.</p><hr><p>&quot;Wha\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>It feels like time has stopped.</p><p>Saber is looking down at her chest in blank amazement.</p><hr><p>&quot;Caster, you...&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes, this is my Noble Phantasm, Saber.

I don&#39;t know what you&#39;re thinking about, but honestly tell me it was fun if it was. You&#39;re being rude to the one that escorted you.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Huh...? No, that&#39;s not what I meant.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes, that&#39;s what you meant. You&#39;re unconsciously putting brakes on. ...Heh, I don&#39;t know what happened to you before, but why don&#39;t you just forget it if it&#39;s so painful?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>...My breath stops.</p><p>It feels like she stuck a knife into my wound with amazing precision.</p><hr><p>&quot;Tohsaka, that&#39;s...&quot;</p><p>&quot;It&#39;s not something I care about. ...Well, I fulfilled my original objective, so it&#39;s all your problem now.&quot;</p><p>With her hair trailing behind her, Tohsaka heads to the hill road.</p><p>Not towards the Western-style houses, but to the Japanese-style houses.</p><hr><p>&quot;......&quot;</p><p>I stand there in a daze.</p><p>&quot;Shirou, are we not going home?

Didn&#39;t you learn from previous experience...!?&quot;</p><p>Tohsaka&#39;s angry.</p><p>...That&#39;s surprising. Archer told Tohsaka about it, huh?</p><hr><p>&quot;Learn from previous experience? Yes, I usually would not be interested in someone who refused already. But that depends on the person, little lady.&quot;</p><p>Caster&#39;s watching me.</p><p>As if saying she&#39;s not interested in Tohsaka.</p><hr><p>&quot;You are very interesting, boy. This is the fifth Holy Grail War, but I don&#39;t think a case like you has existed before.</p><p>It&#39;s easy to kill you. But you&#39;re a valuable sample, so I would like to obtain you alive if possible.</p><p>Do you understand? I am doing such an inelegant thing because I want you to be on my side alive.&quot;</p><hr><p>That means...</p><p>She will kill if I refuse.</p><hr><p>&quot;I came here disobeying my master. I value you that much, so can you not trust my enthusiasm?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Don&#39;t say ridiculous things...! You&#39;re just doing whatever you like without obeying your Master\u2015\u2015\u2015!&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh, are you jealous? But I&#39;m sorry. I&#39;m not interested in you. You seem to be a strong magus, but you are far from being able to match me. I do not want complete omnipotence, but an incomplete unique ability.</p><p>...In that regard, this boy is ideal. He is an amateur magus and it will be easy to control him.&quot;</p><hr><p>A charming laugh.</p><p>Caster urges me for my reply while digging her fingers into &#39;s neck.</p><hr><p>&quot;...How troubling. You should not need to think about it.</p><p>Nobody other than me will obtain the Holy Grail. This town is already mine.

I am telling you it is useless.</p><p>Look, the one here is only my shadow.</p><p>The source of my power is everybody in this town.

Even people without magical energy have souls, right?</p><p>We are soul-eaters to begin with. We can get unlimited magical energy if we suck magical energy called &#39;life&#39; from our Masters.</p><p>...I can even use your great Noble Phantasm as many times as I want.&quot;</p><hr><p>An unlimited source of energy.</p><p>Magical energy she sucks out of everybody in this town.</p><p>...That&#39;s why she&#39;s going to win?</p><p>She&#39;s saying she&#39;s invincible because she controls innocent people like ?</p><p>It&#39;s the same.</p><p>She is saying she will laugh on top of others&#39; sacrifices\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>The firing hammer rises.</p><p>Heat returns to my calm mind.</p><hr><p>&quot;Now, let me hear your answer, Emiya Shirou.</p><p>You have no chance of winning. Will you, along with Saber, obey me?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Let go of Fuji-Nee.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...Did you not hear me? I told you to come under my control.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Shut up. Let go of Fuji-Nee.&quot;</p><p>There&#39;s nothing else.</p><p>I have nothing to give to her.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>A gritting sound.</p><p>Caster grits her teeth in annoyance and sighs as if to calm herself down.</p><hr><p>&quot;......All right, so the negotiation is denied? Only one Master can obtain the Holy Grail. So you have no intention of cooperating with another Master?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;I don&#39;t care about the Holy Grail. I just won&#39;t cooperate with you.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I see. I must really be hated.&quot;</p><p>There&#39;s no sarcasm in her voice.</p><p>There&#39;s only anger.</p><hr><p>&quot;...This is really disappointing. I really did like you.</p><p>I could have shared the Holy Grail with you if you had cooperated with me.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;That&#39;s none of your concern. I decided to fight so that I can stop people like you. The Holy Grail has nothing to do with this.</p><p>Just let Fuji-Nee go.&quot;</p><hr><p>I glare at Caster.</p><p>Taking my stare full of enmity, Caster\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015[r]</p><p>&quot;Fufu\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015ahaha, ahahahahaha!&quot;</p><p>...Laughs for some reason.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015You.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh, did I get on your nerves?

You are a victim of the Holy Grail.</p><p>The moment you say the Holy Grail has nothing to do with this\u2015\u2015\u2015proves that you detest the Holy Grail.&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>At that instant...</p><p>My mind freezes.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Shirou?&quot;</p><p>I don&#39;t understand anything since my mind&#39;s frozen.</p><p>Not even Tohsaka, who&#39;s watching me with worry. Not even Saber, who looks down painfully.</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>Not even the nausea that fills me up.</p><hr><p>&quot;I know, Emiya Shirou. The previous war was ten years ago, right? You lost everything at that time. You were left alone in the fire and all you could do was wait for death. And Emiya Kiritsugu found you at that time.</p><p>So you&#39;re not a real child of this house.</p><p>But you were forced to become a magus and you&#39;ve suffered all this time, right?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>&quot;...No way. Emiya-kun, is that...&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Yes. The Holy Grail is an enemy you have to detest. It&#39;s ironic that you&#39;ve entered this war.&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;I understand how you feel. Everyone has to curse something if their happiness is taken away unreasonably.</p><p>...Yes, I like the past you carry, Emiya Shirou.&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;You are qualified to take revenge. You have the right to obtain the Holy Grail and to settle what happened ten years ago. That&#39;s why I considered having you on my side.&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015Now, think again, boy.</p><p>I don&#39;t want to fight. Battles are stupid, right? If the Holy Grail has infinite wealth, it should not run out no matter how much we split it.</p><p>Then can you not share the Holy Grail with those you trust?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>She&#39;s probably not telling a lie.</p><p>Caster must seriously think so.</p><hr><p>&quot;Take revenge, Emiya Shirou.</p><p>The Holy Grail is practically in my hands already. It will be easy to make your wish come true.&quot;</p><p>&quot;That is nonsense, Caster...! The Holy Grail will not appear until there is only one Servant left. Do not insult my Master with such talk...!&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;No, there are ways to obtain the Holy Grail without fighting, Saber. Even if it may be impossible for other Servants, I, as Caster, can see the trick of the Holy Grail.</p><p>Yes, if you, the one with enormous magical energy output, will help me, it should be possible to summon the Holy Grail right now.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Wha\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>It creates a crack in Saber&#39;s resolve.</p><p>It&#39;s because Saber feels that Caster is telling the truth.</p><hr><p>&quot;This is your final warning, boy.</p><p>You want to avoid needless battles, right? Then obey me. I shall give you the Holy Grail if you give me Saber and cooperate with me.&quot;</p><hr><p>The final negotiation.</p><p>Saber is perplexed.</p><p>It&#39;s because avoidable battles should be avoided, and it will be best if the Holy Grail can be obtained that way.</p><hr><p>And besides, the enemy has &#39;s life in her hands.</p><p>There&#39;s only one answer.</p><p>Even Tohsaka is biting her lips as if she has given up.</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015I...</p><hr><h2 id="scene-09" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#scene-09" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Scene 09</h2><p>I&#39;m curious as to why there&#39;s no reply, but Tohsaka might be one of those rare people who sleep with earplugs on.</p><p>...Well, knowing her, she might be sleeping because she stayed up late last night for unknown reasons. I guess I can let her be.</p><hr><p>&quot;Yeah..... First of all, you can&#39;t go into a girl&#39;s room without permission, you idiot.&quot;</p><hr><p>I scratch my head and walk away from the forbidden door.</p><p>...That was meaningless.</p><p>It&#39;s not too late, so I&#39;ll go to the shopping district and buy some tofu.</p><hr><h2 id="scene-10" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#scene-10" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Scene 10</h2><p>I head to the tofu shop under the clear blue sky.</p><p>I buy three tofu with the 300 yen that was on the table.</p><p>&quot;Oh, Shirou-kun.

You are at ease this morning.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Hm? Oh, morning, Saber. I can relax since it&#39;s Sunday and there&#39;s no school today. I feel good, so let&#39;s go to the dojo after breakfast.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes, that will be great. So your numbness has healed?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh, you&#39;re right.</p><p>I was able to walk from the shopping district without a problem, so I guess it&#39;s pretty much healed. ...It&#39;s a bit heavy, but it should be fully healed by tomorrow.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;That is good. I cannot be at ease if my Master is wounded. I can relax if I see you in the kitchen like always.&quot;</p><hr><p>Saber takes a seat in her usual position beside the table.</p><p>Fuji-Nee and Tohsaka are sleeping, but since it&#39;s Sunday, I should let them sleep in until breakfast&#39;s ready.</p><hr><p>&quot;Good morning, Rin. It seems you were able to sleep well last night.&quot;</p><p>Oh.</p><p>It seems Tohsaka&#39;s awake.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Morning. It wasn&#39;t really like that. The light was bright and there were people moving about even past midnight.&quot;</p><p>...Tohsaka answers Saber as she goes into the living room.</p><hr><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015Well.</p><p>I don&#39;t want to complain so early in the morning, but I have to know why she took all of the bread.</p><hr><p>&quot;Good morning, Tohsaka.

Have some tea while you&#39;re waiting.&quot;</p><p>I put the cups in front of Saber and Tohsaka.</p><p>But.</p><hr><p>&quot;Why are you so slow? We&#39;re going out today, so get ready quickly.&quot;</p><p>Tohsaka glares at me as if breakfast can come later.</p><hr><p>&quot;Huh\u2015\u2015\u2015? Um, where are we going?&quot;</p><p>&quot;To the neighboring town. I want to go somewhere far away, but we don&#39;t have such time, right? So it&#39;s a compromise.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...?&quot;</p><p>Is this some sort of new surprise attack?</p><p>I don&#39;t get what Tohsaka wants.</p><hr><p>&quot;Okay. I get it, but why are we going there?&quot;</p><p>&quot;We&#39;re going to go have fun, of course.

Why are we going!?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Because I feel like it. You don&#39;t mind, right? We&#39;re not doing anything during daytime anyways. I won&#39;t let you run away now.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015I certainly don&#39;t mind, but\u2015\u2015\u2015yeah, what about Archer!?

I saw a strange bird, so I cut it. But it did not spill blood nor scream. Is this one of yours, Caster?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;......! ...I see, this must have been a familiar spying on us. It must be Berserker&#39;s Master or that young lady. Either way, this place will not last long.&quot;</p><p>Caster walks to the forest and looks down at the &quot;thing&quot; on the ground.</p><p>It is the corpse of an owl.</p><p>It is a bird made from crystal. It is simple, but suited for spying, and must have been made by Archer&#39;s Master.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Heh, that lady is unlucky. I could have made her my student if she were less talented.&quot;</p><p>She steps on it.</p><p>The amethyst crystals are crushed to powder, scattering star-like dust.</p><hr><p>&quot;There are people like this, so I leave you in charge to protect my Master. I will disappear if my Master dies. If that happens, you cannot exist either.</p><p>If you do not want to disappear, protect the gate and be prepared even for death.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Well\u2015\u2015\u2015it is hard to be prepared for death. I have never felt that I was &#39;alive&#39;.</p><p>Is it not meaningless to ask that of one such as I?&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Stop your impudent talk.</p><p>Do not misunderstand, Assassin. You are a Servant I summoned. A slave should act like a slave.</p><p>If you cannot swear your loyalty, you can disappear right now.&quot;</p><hr><p>Caster&#39;s words are filled with enmity and contempt.</p><p>For her, Assassin is only a tool.</p><p>It is annoying for a tool to talk, so it is natural for her to get mad when it starts to speak cynically.</p><hr><p>&quot;I see. Good heavens. My life is like a heat haze, but it is problematic if I disappear now. I have made a promise. If I can, I would like to fulfill this promise.&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Then hold your tongue. You only need to protect this place.</p><p>If you&#39;re able to do so, I can make you real. A low-class like you without a Noble Phantasm can become a heroic spirit, so it should be worth risking your life, right?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;You do not need to worry. I have belonged to the other world from the beginning. I will act out my role.</p><p>But is it all right, Caster? I am not loyal to my master, but you are dishonest as well. Tonight&#39;s matter is a secret to your Master, right?&quot;</p><p>At that instant, Assassin&#39;s body explodes.</p><p>A thumping sound.</p><p>The curse that was put into his body upon summoning has exploded.</p><hr><p>The trees sway.</p><p>Assassin is flung into the forest, his chest pierced from within by his own ribs.</p><p>His figure is like a bloomed flower.</p><hr><p>&quot;Guh\u2015\u2015\u2015geez. You are getting worse every day, Caster.&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Quiet. If I have to tell you one more time, I will eliminate you before waiting five days.&quot;</p><p>&quot;...Geez. They say women and mean people are unmanageable, but you have gone too far.&quot;</p><hr><p>The flashy Servant gets up.</p><p>This Servant does not lose his elegance even if he shows his ribs or if his body is covered in blood.</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh, do not glare at me like that. You are wasting your beautiful face, Caster. I know, everything is to be a secret from your Master, right? I will hide the fact that you caught Saber and that I am guarding this place.</p><p>It is a moving story. I wish that your caring spirit would reach him.&quot;</p><p>&quot;</p><p>Assassin, you...&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;I am just being a poor loser. I cannot attack you, so allow me to joke around like that.</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015I will protect the gate. I will protect it no matter what.</p><p>But where are you going? Do you not trust my protection?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Of course not. You&#39;re just insurance.</p><p>But that&#39;s at an end as well. Once I have control of Saber, I don&#39;t have to use this rustic place as my temple.&quot;</p><p>&quot;...Hm, so you will relocate? Then I am certainly not needed. Is there a sacred ground superior to this place?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes. It is inferior to this place, but there is a place suited for me. And\u2015\u2015\u2015I will be going there in the near future anyways. There is no problem if I go now, right?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>Assassin&#39;s expression, which had been cool up to now, clouds up.</p><p>Caster smiles as if she&#39;s satisfied.</p><hr><p>&quot;Yes.

There are two Servants under Caster now. Don&#39;t you have anything else to say?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I cannot think of a way to beat her at the moment. But we should consider it fortunate that we know her Noble Phantasm now.</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015Break the contract between the Servant and the Master, huh? We should be able to do better if we know that ahead of time.&quot;</p><p>&quot;That is true.</p><p>...But you sure sound uninterested, Archer. Weren&#39;t you supporting Saber?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015I don&#39;t think I ever showed interest in her. What makes you think so, Rin?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Let&#39;s see. Would woman&#39;s intuition be a good enough reason?&quot;</p><p>&quot;No. You are not of an age to be called a woman. First of all, you do not have enough charm.</p><p>You lack elegance as well.</p><p>And most of all\u2015\u2015\u2015yes, this is fatal... your charm is hard to understand.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Heh. I see. You&#39;re finally back to par now.&quot;</p><p>She smiles pleasantly.</p><p>Archer has to be like this.</p><p>An unemotional person isn&#39;t the partner Rin trusts.</p><p>Her partner has to always be composed and has to speak cynically against anyone.</p><hr><p>Rin knows that is the kindness of this knight.</p><p>Speaking cynically is like indirectly telling others to fix that part of them.</p><hr><p>&quot;I see. Then here&#39;s the first proof.</p><p>You went easy on Saber the first time you met her.</p><p>Even though Saber may be strong, I don&#39;t think you, the one good at defending, would be beaten in one blow.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;That was a surprise attack. I am weak against unexpected things, like you are.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Heh, shut up. So, here&#39;s the next proof.</p><p>You provoked Saber after the incident with Rider.</p><p>That wasn&#39;t like you at all.</p><p>I realized after I looked at it from a different angle. You were scolding Saber back then, right?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;............&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh, am I right? I thought so. I don&#39;t know if you knew her from your previous life, but it&#39;s rare for you to act so coldly.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Really? I think I act that way towards everyone.&quot;</p><p>&quot;You&#39;re the only one who thinks so. I think you&#39;re really clumsy when it comes to anything that concerns you. Everyone&#39;s tricked because you&#39;re not clumsy towards others.&quot;</p><hr><p>Archer frowns.</p><p>He must have been self-conscious of it.</p><p>The knight in red ponders with a troubled expression, and his master looks at him in pleasure.</p><p>And suddenly...</p><p>&quot;So, do you remember which hero you are now? If you&#39;re related to Saber, you must be a hero from around that age, right?&quot;</p><p>She says so as if testing something.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015No, my past is still hazy.</p><p>But I do remember Saber as you say. She doesn&#39;t seem to know me, so I guess we didn&#39;t have a deep connection.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Hm. So I guess you two weren&#39;t friends or lovers.</p><p>That&#39;s too bad. I would&#39;ve found out Saber&#39;s true identity if that were the case.&quot;</p><p>She doesn&#39;t sound disappointed.</p><p>It&#39;s just an offhanded remark.</p><hr><p>&quot;Well, I&#39;ll remember eventually.</p><p>By the way, Rin. How is the one you brought here doing? Is that one doing fine?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...Yeah, he survived. His wounds healed up automatically until yesterday, but this wound isn&#39;t healing at all. I think Saber&#39;s self-healing powers went away because the contract came to an end.</p><p>But he survived. Fortunately, he didn&#39;t get hit in any vital points, so he should be able to get up and eat in about three days.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;No, not that one. I meant the other person.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Huh? Oh, Fujimura-Sensei? I let her sleep in the guest room. I think Caster used a sleeping magecraft on her, but she&#39;s still doing really well. I did treat her, so it shouldn&#39;t be a problem even if she sleeps for a week.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015I see. But she might turn into a sleeping beauty with Caster&#39;s magecraft. That woman&#39;s spells are more like curses. The simplest way to dispel her is to kill Caster.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yeah. Either way, the Holy Grail War won&#39;t last much longer. We&#39;re going to beat Caster as fast as possible, and knowing Fujimura-Sensei, she might wake up on her own.&quot;</p><p>Archer nods.</p><p>And after a brief pause in the conversation...</p><hr><p>&quot;Beating Caster comes first. Even though there is one less Master now, Saber still exists. ...We do not have time to spare, Rin.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I know. We&#39;ll go out to town immediately.</p><p>Even Caster should take some time to completely control Saber. If possible, we have to beat Caster before Saber is fully controlled.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;All right. \u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015So the contract about that kid ends here, huh?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Huh\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Emiya Shirou isn&#39;t a Master anymore, right?</p><p>Then he will be of no help and there will be no need to protect him. The second Command Spell can be lifted off me now, right?&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>&quot;What? Don&#39;t tell me you&#39;ll take care of him because he cooperated with you.&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Of course not. I&#39;m not that good a person.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Then...&quot;</p><p>&quot;But it&#39;s not over yet. I won&#39;t break the promise until he himself says he&#39;s out of this war.</p><p>...I&#39;ll try to get him out, but we can&#39;t end it until he gives up.&quot;</p><p>She declares stubbornly.</p><p>What can he reply to that?</p><hr><p>&quot;That&#39;s my course of action. Do you have any objections, Archer?&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015It cannot be helped. I&#39;m fully aware that you are like that.&quot;</p><p>His voice sounds cynical.</p><p>She just laughs it off and makes an order.</p><p>&quot;Let&#39;s go, Archer. I don&#39;t know why, but Caster isn&#39;t back at the Ryuudou Temple.</p><p>Then\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015let&#39;s find her and defeat her before she goes back to the temple.&quot;</p><p>There&#39;s no need to answer.</p><p>The knight in red nods and follows his master.</p><hr><p>Gloomy clouds are still overhead.</p><p>A moonless night.
