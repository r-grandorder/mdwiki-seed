As a creator in my forties, the media I experienced from my teens to my twenties has left permanent scars on me. The first shock I experienced was \u201CNeon Genesis Evangelion\u201D. It had everything that appealed to me, so I naturally took both damage and influence from it. While I was still reeling from \u201CEva\u201D, along came \u201CMartian Successor Nadesico\u201D, and then \u201CUtena\u201D. I was assaulted by a barrage of brilliant, highly charismatic anime in those days.</p><p><strong>\u2014What was your impression of the first episode?</strong></p><p><strong>Nasu:</strong> My friends (all men, naturally) kind of reflexively rejected it: \u201CWhat the hell\u2019s with this artstyle?!\u201D I was used to shoujo manga, so my first impression was \u201CI like these character designs. But I guess it\u2019s true that they\u2019re a bit too aesthetic for anime\u2026\u201D I wasn\u2019t too resistant to it probably because I loved Takemiya Keiko\u2019s \u201CToward the Terra\u201D.</p><p>But once I actually watched it, it wasn\u2019t the artstyle but the subject matter itself that was in a completely different cultural field, and I couldn\u2019t wrap my head around it. And yet I couldn\u2019t help but watch it again and again. Behind the aesthetic and abstract world it presented at first glance was something very sensitive and allegorical. From its very first episode, \u201CUtena\u201D boldly opted to take things that normally the viewers would demand to have explained to them and express them while remaining abstract.</p><p><strong>\u2014\u201DExpress them while remaining abstract.\u201D</strong></p><p><strong>Nasu:</strong> Yes. \u201CUtena\u201D, \u201CMawaru Penguindrum\u201D, and \u201CYuri Kuma Arashi\u201D all have something definitive at their core, and it\u2019d be possible to definitively state \u201Cthis means such-and-such\u201D. But once you say that, it\u2019s all over. If you turn to someone who\u2019s struggling with something \u201Cabstract\u201D and tell them your own subjective conclusion, all you\u2019ve done is push someone else\u2019s viewpoint on them. It\u2019s very difficult to convey an image while keeping it as-is. Communicating abstract concepts while keeping them as such is something Director Ikuhara has been doing since back then.</p><p>\u201CUtena\u201D\u2018s dialogue was sensitive and abstract, but the direction and art were all so vivid. The imagery of the shell representing the world was so powerful, it was like I\u2019d seen an amazing work of art\u2014that may be an exaggeration, but that feeling overcame me when I watched the first episode, and it got me hook line and sinker. The \u201CZettai Unmei Mokushiroku\u201D stock sequence played, there was a battle, the ending theme played, and I thought with certainty, \u201CThis is a masterpiece. But it\u2019d probably be impossible to explain how amazing it is to ten people and have all ten of them understand.\u201D I think now that the people who hold this work in their heart forever are either the female viewers who likely share the same gender-related hardships, or the people who think \u201CI want to create something, I want to express something\u201D. Once you\u2019ve been shown something like this, you can\u2019t ignore it. It felt like peeping on someone\u2019s secrets, like I\u2019d seen something I shouldn\u2019t have.</p><p><strong>\u2014Are there any specific episodes that left an impression on you?</strong></p><p><strong>Nasu:</strong> I love the \u201CBlack Rose arc\u201D. It fits the whole kishotenketsu structure into one episode. Professor Nemuro (Mikage Souji) says \u201CThe path before you has been prepared\u201D, there\u2019s a fight scene, Utena wins, the coffin falls into the incinerator\u2026 Those repeating scenes were a lot of fun. Once I began writing scripts for anime, I understood even more clearly how amazing that structure was.</p><p>The stock sequences and the Black Rose arc\u2019s structure arose from the creators having constraints on what they were able to do. Ikuhara-san may say that he just felt like if they had to use stock sequences he might as well make them fun to watch, but how many people do you know of who could actually pull that off? Today\u2019s anime industry is so advanced that you can make a 22-minute episode without any stock sequences. Back then there were fewer people, very few digital tools, and it wasn\u2019t like you could just Google for resources. It\u2019s astounding that he was able to create something so perfect in that environment. He\u2019s superhuman, no joke. While I\u2019m sure this is the case in all the arts, the people from the previous generation must have gone through twice as much hardship as us. The creativity that arises from a lack of resources produces something with such density, it\u2019s beyond our wildest imaginings.</p><h2 id="the-villains-of-ikuhara-s-work-are-completely-evil-yet-the-most-pitiful" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#the-villains-of-ikuhara-s-work-are-completely-evil-yet-the-most-pitiful" aria-hidden="true">#</a> THE VILLAINS OF IKUHARA\u2019S WORK ARE \u201CCOMPLETELY EVIL, YET THE MOST PITIFUL\u201D</h2><p><strong>\u2014What was your impression of the characters? Were there any in particular that struck a chord with you?</strong></p><p><strong>Nasu:</strong> Of course, I like all the characters. Not one of them felt out of place. If I had to say which ones I particularly like, it\u2019d be the two main characters. I\u2019ve always liked crossdressing girls and crossdressing boys, but Tenjou Utena and Himemiya Anthy had me going \u201CWoah, they\u2019re doing this in this time period!\u201D Utena tries to break away from how women have women\u2019s restrictive role forced upon them, while Anthy is like the embodiment of that. Anthy is a frightening character, who you think of as a doll at first but who gradually becomes more terrifying as you begin to understand her. \u201CUtena\u201D is the story of the rapport between these characters\u2014or rather the swordfight disguised as a rapport\u2014and when you get down to it (Ohtori) Akio-san is nothing more than a backdrop to them!</p><p>Utena loses the battle in the end, but Anthy puts an end to her own wounds in that way. Watching the opening again after watching all 39 episodes is dazzling. Everything from the opening of episode 1 to the end of episode 39 forms a circle, so you find yourself going round and round rewatching it. Just like \u201CEva\u201D, \u201CUtena\u201D is an anime that can stand up to a hundred viewings.</p><p><strong>\u2014How did you feel about episode 33, \u201CThe Prince Who Runs Through the Night\u201D, in which the relationship between Utena and Anthy greatly changed?</strong></p><p><strong>Nasu:</strong> Oh, \u201CThe Prince Who Runs Through the Night\u201D. It depicts Akio-san on a highway at night, talking on the phone. You think \u201Cwhat\u2019s going on with this direction?\u201D as it drags on for an almost tedious twenty minutes. And then the shocking two minutes at the end. I remember dropping my jaw and thinking \u201CWhat\u2019s going to happen next week?\u201D. Since I\u2019m a man, the fact of the heroine who had protected her chastity up until that point suddenly having sex with Akio-san\u2014didn\u2019t inspire much of an unpleasant feeling in me, actually.</p><p><strong>\u2014That\u2019s unexpected. I had thought it might be more shocking for men.</strong></p><p><strong>Nasu:</strong> Well, that kind of thing was a staple of Yamada Fuutarou and Kikuchi Hideyuki\u2019s supernatural stories, you see\u2026 Actually, I thought \u201COf course you\u2019re gonna get preyed upon if you go for a nighttime drive with a dangerous monster like that!\u201D. But for such a seemingly inviolable heroine who practically had purity as a main theme to fall like that made me prepared, made me think \u201CAh, they aren\u2019t going to go easy on anyone,\u201D and straighten up to take things more seriously. This was something I watched for evening entertainment, but it was stepping into literary territory.</p><p>Part of the definition of a \u201Cstory\u201D is that the characters develop, right? In that sense, Utena didn\u2019t develop so much as shed her skin. Her mask comes off over the course of the story whether she wants it to or not. If she didn\u2019t fall to Akio-san at that time, Utena might not have lost to the story. But then she would have been unable to touch on Anthy\u2019s darkness, and Akio-san\u2019s fun story would have never ended. Because she lost the protagonistic attribute of purity and became an \u201Cextra\u201D, she was freed from the bias of the story and was able to put an end to the dream of the prince however indirectly\u2026 that\u2019s what I thought at the time.</p><p><strong>\u2014Listening to you speak, I can feel a kind of affection towards Akio.</strong></p><p><strong>Nasu:</strong> Yes, that\u2019s because Akio-san had a ton of impact on me. How do you come up with a character like that? He\u2019s overwhelming as an antagonist and fascinating as a character, but the lowest you can go as a human being. The villains in Ikuhara-san\u2019s works are all completely evil, but at the same time they\u2019re the most pitiful. He\u2019s undeniably a cool adult, but is the most hopeless as he creates that world and preys on children. What that means is that he can\u2019t shine outside of that world.</p><p>Among the male characters, other than Akio I also like Saionji Kyouichi. I think everyone probably had some inkling of this, but the design for Matou Shinji from \u201CFate/stay night\u201D originated with me thinking \u201COh yeah, the male friend character\u2019s definitely gotta have wavy hair!\u201D (laughs)</p><h2 id="the-movie-that-bowled-me-over-as-a-writer" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#the-movie-that-bowled-me-over-as-a-writer" aria-hidden="true">#</a> THE MOVIE THAT BOWLED ME OVER AS A WRITER</h2><p><strong>\u2014The anime series was broadcast in 1997. In 1999, the movie \u201CAdolescence of Utena\u201D was released.</strong></p><p><strong>Nasu:</strong> The anime series of \u201CUtena\u201D had a huge impact on me, but even still, I thought of it as like a giant on the opposite shore. Sure it was a huge deal to those in the world of anime, but I was safe on the other side of the river, I thought.</p><p>Then a few years later, I saw the movie (a little late) and was bowled over as a writer. The frightening thing about the movie is that even while having the same relationships as the TV anime, it tells you in the first five minutes that \u201COh, this is a dystopian world after the TV version was destroyed. It\u2019s a story where the ghosts trapped in Ohtori Academy try searching for answers once more.\u201D And it pulls off something that sophisticated in an hour and a half. The leftover story details from the TV anime and the sort of guilty feeling of \u201CCouldn\u2019t there have been a better ending?\u201D do remain in the hearts of \u201CUtena\u201D\u2019s viewers, but the movie version struck a chord with me as a powered-up \u201Cwhat-if\u201D scenario.</p><p>In the movie, Utena and Anthy are in in opposite positions than they were in the TV anime. In the TV anime\u2019s world, the egg\u2019s shell was broken but there could be no revolution \u2013 the chick definitely hatched from the egg, but it died. In the movie version, the two of them broke the shell and were trying to flap their wings.</p><p><strong>\u2014Kawakami Tomoko, who voiced Utena, played Ryougi Shiki in the drama CD version of \u201CKara no Kyoukai\u201D.</strong></p><p><strong>Nasu:</strong> To me, Kawakami-san is Utena. Before I knew much about voice actors, I worked with her just once. What I\u2019m most grateful to Kawakami-san\u2019s associates for is the \u201CUtena\u201D DVD box set and Blu-Ray box set booklets. In the DVD box set there\u2019s a comment from Kawakami-san, and in the Blu-Ray box set there\u2019s a comment from Kawakami-san\u2019s mother. It\u2019s true that we can\u2019t meet Kawakami-san again or hear her voice, but there are still things she left behind both in concrete form and in the hearts of her fans. It really hit me that that\u2019s what it means to create something. A creator\u2019s work is their child. The \u201CUtena\u201D box sets made me realize that as long as people love your child, there\u2019s meaning to what you\u2019re doing.</p><p><strong>\u2014So your works are like children to you.</strong></p><p><strong>Nasu:</strong> That\u2019s how serious I am about creating them. I think there are two types of creators: the type who focus all their affection on the next child once their first child becomes independent, and the type who want to care for their child until they die, because that\u2019s their child. I\u2019m the latter. Even if my child goes off to get married, I worry that they might be mistreated in their new home, and I want to solve their problems for them. \u201CMy child is a swimmer, but they might be forced into pro wrestling\u2026 Then I\u2019ll train my child to be a pro wrestler too!\u201D \u201CFate/Grand Order\u201D might be a conspicuous example of this. If I wasn\u2019t like this, my life might have been a lot easier.</p><h2 id="the-story-of-someone-who-wasn-t-loved-unconditionally-mawaru-penguindrum" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#the-story-of-someone-who-wasn-t-loved-unconditionally-mawaru-penguindrum" aria-hidden="true">#</a> THE STORY OF SOMEONE WHO WASN\u2019T LOVED UNCONDITIONALLY: \u201CMAWARU PENGUINDRUM\u201D</h2><p><strong>\u2014Let\u2019s talk about \u201CPenguindrum\u201D. You wrote your impressions of the first episode on your website \u201CBamboo Broom\u201D when it aired, right?</strong></p><p><strong>Nasu:</strong> \u201CPenguindrum\u201D had a high level of polish to it. Its character designs and colour scheme had more universal appeal, but it was bursting with the same Ikuhara aesthetic, and on top of that, the theme was \u201Clove\u201D. Someone who had been loved unconditionally versus someone who had not been loved unconditionally\u2014he did something great by fully depicting this in a story about boys and girls. It had true style, communicating abstract concepts while keeping them abstract.</p><p>But just like \u201CUtena\u201D, it was so advanced. Unless someone seriously sticks with the story or has a lot of knowledge, they might not understand its flavour right to the end. First you\u2019re lured into the Ikuhara world with coolness and eccentricity, and then how much further you venture in is up to you\u2014I feel that\u2019s its policy.</p><p>When the PV for the new anime aired after a few years, I was excited, thinking \u201CThis is an omen of Ikuhara-san\u2019s return!\u201D, but I still only half believed it. Then I watched the first episode, and was moved by how much it rocked (laughs) If someone unfamiliar with Ikuhara\u2019s works saw the Princess of the Crystal\u2019s \u201CSurvival Strategy\u201D, they\u2019d be caught off guard a little. But we know from \u201CUtena\u201D that this stock scene will be core to what\u2019s to come. The phrase \u201Csurvival strategy\u201D is normal in reference to nature, but when it\u2019s a pretty girl dressed like a penguin saying it, it sounds like some incredible magic words. In a world that\u2019s becoming increasingly easy to live in, she thrusts this survival strategy at two teenage boys and declares, \u201CIf you keep living like this, you will die without ever realizing you were alive. You will never amount to anything. But\u2014seek something out.\u201D The stock sequence is so cool and never gets old after seeing it dozens of times, but it\u2019s very important too.</p><p><strong>\u2014The work had \u201C1995\u201D as a keyword, using the subway sarin attack as a motif.</strong></p><p><strong>Nasu:</strong> To be honest, I had my doubts about why he would be handling the sarin attack then. There were so many victims, and I felt like it was too early to use it as a basis for fiction. But when I learned that Ikuhara-san himself strongly felt \u201CThere\u2019s no point if we don\u2019t do it before the memory fades. The scars have to remain as scars,\u201D I had to concede defeat twice over.</p><p><strong>\u2014What did you think of the characters?</strong></p><p><strong>Nasu:</strong> I like every character in \u201CPenguindrum\u201D as well, but this time instead of the protagonists I have to declare Sanetoshi-sensei (Watase Sanetoshi) the winner. Man, what an amazing character concept. Right in the opening sequence you see this pink-haired man in a white longcoat coming at you like a gale. He\u2019s clearly the main antagonist, and you can tell at a glance that he\u2019s human trash of a different sort than Akio, but he\u2019s cool as hell. If I were still in middle school maybe I\u2019d have thought \u201Csomeday I wanna dye my hair pink, put on a white coat and say \u2018shibireru nee\u2019!\u201D\u2026</p><p>Everything in the final episode was so beautiful, and I still cry my eyes out when I rewatch it on Christmas. \u201CPenguindrum\u201D is the story of the protagonists who weren\u2019t loved by the family that should have loved them unconditionally, as they band together to live their lives as fellow strays. Kanba and the others leave a bond, but Sanetoshi-sensei is left behind again.</p><p>He represents those who were never loved unconditionally. He\u2019s a parallel to (Oginome) Momoka-chan, who loved everyone unconditionally. The two did meet, but Momoka said \u201CBut I\u2019m going now\u201D and went off somewhere, leaving Sanetoshi-sensei behind. He should have cast away his pride and said \u201CI\u2019m coming too!\u201D, allowing himself to be loved. But being unloved for years was the only thing he had pride in, so he couldn\u2019t yield that. Even after all that talk about love, he prioritized his self-preservation. But I see romanticism in that, and it resonated with me the strongest. It\u2019s a very harsh and heavy story, told in a catchy way with penguins and strong keywords. It\u2019s cute when you enter, but the further you venture inside the more it beats you down. I think it was more intent on conveying a message than \u201CUtena\u201D was.</p><p><strong>\u2014What do you think of the Princess of the Crystal\u2019s line, \u201CYou lowlifes who will never amount to anything\u201D? I think that phrase may have felt like a gut punch to many people aiming to become creators.</strong></p><p><strong>Nasu:</strong> I see, so you interpreted it as meaning \u201CYou\u2019ll end as a viewer and never become a creator\u201D. I\u2019m in the position of being a writer, so I might have had a subconscious safety barrier there. But if you ask me, I took it to mean \u201CIf you can\u2019t obtain true love, everything\u2019s just for show. If you\u2019re never loved and cannot love another, you\u2019ll never amount to anything.\u201D</p><p>Creators sometimes choose their own work over love. Just like Sanetoshi-sensei, you might destroy with your own hands the person who might have shared the apple of fate with you, or eat the apple by yourself. That might be what it means to live for your hobbies or your work, but if you look only at yourself you\u2019ll never amount to anything\u2014that\u2019s how I interpreted it. It\u2019s a harsh message.</p><h2 id="yuri-kuma-arashi-contained-all-of-director-ikuhara" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#yuri-kuma-arashi-contained-all-of-director-ikuhara" aria-hidden="true">#</a> \u201CYURI KUMA ARASHI\u201D CONTAINED ALL OF DIRECTOR IKUHARA</h2><p><strong>\u2014\u201DYuri Kuma Arashi\u201D was broadcast in 2015.</strong></p><p><strong>Nasu:</strong> \u201CYuri Kuma Arashi\u201D fit all of Director Ikuhara\u2014all his Ikuhara Gimmicks\u2014into a compact single cour. The town scenery with the Ikuhara filter over it making it look super cool, the stock sequences you never get tired of watching, the magic words, the scenes that actually overtly talk about the themes, the protagonists gradually distancing themselves from society\u2019s system\u2026 The way strong phrases like \u201Ckuma shock!\u201D come up with what would normally be the worst possible timing makes things feel funny and pleasant, which I think is also part of Ikuhara-san\u2019s unique sense.</p><p>I think there are a lot of different interpretations of the story, but I take the man-eating bears as a metaphor for gay and bisexual people. They sent the world the message \u201CPlease understand that some beings can\u2019t live any other way than this\u201D, but received overwhelming persecution and harsh punishment from society. \u201CUtena\u201D had a similar theme, but tried to revolutionize the world. \u201CYuri Kuma Arashi\u201D\u2018s story goes \u201CWe couldn\u2019t change society in the end, so we\u2019ll disappear from this world\u201D. It probably would have been boring to tell the same story twice, and I do think it\u2019s alright as long as the characters themselves are happy, but as a viewer I was sad to see them defeated by the world. But that might have been a good way to end it since it was only one cour long.</p><p><strong>\u2014Did any episodes leave a strong impression on you?</strong></p><p><strong>Nasu:</strong> It felt to me like all twelve episodes were a single story. Oh, but the episode that I watched several times\u2014\u201DIkuhara-san\u2019s as great as ever, I can\u2019t believe he could do all that in fifteen minutes\u201D\u2014was the fourth episode, \u201CI Can\u2019t Get a Kiss\u201D. Lulu\u2019s episode. It\u2019s a flashback that shows where the story is leading, and it\u2019s very allegorical, so people will see it differently based on their own perception. Even a hippo could become a philosopher if you showed it this episode! Lulu seemed like the most selfish one at first, but she turned out to be the most thoughtful and an upstanding girl.</p><h2 id="the-influence-ikuhara-s-works-had-on-nasu-kinoko" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#the-influence-ikuhara-s-works-had-on-nasu-kinoko" aria-hidden="true">#</a> THE INFLUENCE IKUHARA\u2019S WORKS HAD ON NASU KINOKO</h2><p><strong>\u2014You have a reputation for depicting women\u2019s emotions, like in the Sakura route of \u201CFate/stay night\u201D (Heaven\u2019s Feel), or \u201CFate/EXTRA CCC\u201D.</strong></p><p><strong>Nasu:</strong> I think having sisters was a big part of that. We had shounen manga and shoujo manga on the same shelf, and I read them the same. As I read more and more, the idea that \u201Cshounen manga are fun to read; shoujo manga have interesting stories\u201D established itself in my mind when I was in elementary school. I always got the sense that shoujo manga depicted people\u2019s inner workings more in its storytelling.</p><p>What\u2019s more, shoujo manga had both sci-fi shoujo manga like Takemiya-sensei\u2019s, as well as delinquent shoujo manga (laughs). I read both of those a lot when I was little. I moved away from shoujo manga for a time, but in university I encountered Hiwatari Saki-sensei\u2019s \u201CPlease Save My Earth\u201D and Nasu Yukie-sensei\u2019s \u201CHere Is Greenwood\u201D. It reminded me once again of how interesting it was.</p><p>On top of that, I also read Himuro Saeko-sensei for the first time, a bit late. I started with \u201CNante Suteki ni Japanesque\u201D. The writing style was light and easy to read, and the characters\u2019 thought processes were to my liking. \u201CBut I ain\u2019t no Heian buff, so this don\u2019t really turn my crank,\u201D I thought, but then my friend\u2019s older sister said \u201CI get the feeling these ones would suit Nasu-kun better\u201D and lent me some books. They were the short story collection \u201CSayonara Arurukan\u201D, containing Himuro-sensei\u2019s debut work, and 1981\u2019s \u201CKoisuru Onnatachi\u201D. I got super hooked and devoured them. \u201CClara Hakusho\u201D is still my bible; I have one copy to read and one for safekeeping, but both are all yellowed now. It\u2019s still the apex of girls\u2019 school fiction in my mind, and I always wanted to write a story like that. That\u2019s how \u201CKara no Kyoukai\u201D was born.</p><p><strong>\u2014Hmmm? \u201CKara no Kyoukai\u201D\u2018s \u201COblivion Recorder\u201D did take place in a girls\u2019 school, but something\u2019s\u2026</strong></p><p><strong>Nasu:</strong> Something\u2019s not quite right there, right? (laughs) But if there\u2019s anything resembling girls\u2019 novels in the foundations of my writing style, I think that\u2019s when it came to be.</p><p><strong>\u2014The novel you wrote as the model for the \u201CFate\u201D series (the prototype version of \u201CFate\u201D) was similar to a girls\u2019 novel, with a woman as the protagonist and King Arthur as the hero. Did that work originate around the same time?</strong></p><p><strong>Nasu:</strong> I wrote Prototype in high school, so it was before I rediscovered girls\u2019 novels. Until high school, the only novels I read were Kikuchi Hideyuki\u2019s supernatural stories, and I wasn\u2019t allowed to watch TV or anime. My first anime was \u201CNadia: The Secret of Blue Water\u201D. Takeuchi Takashi, my fellow otaku since back then, suggested: \u201CNasu, you don\u2019t watch anime? You gotta at least watch the newest thing made by these people called Gainax!\u201D, so I watched it in secret and got hooked. And with \u201CEva\u201D, which I watched based on the Gainax connection, I learned how fun anime could be.</p><p><strong>\u2014Many fans didn\u2019t watch \u201CEva\u201D, \u201CNadesico\u201D, and \u201CUtena\u201D as they were airing. What kind of impact did watching them in real-time have on you?</strong></p><p><strong>Nasu:</strong> Enough of an impact that I thought: \u201CI don\u2019t care if it messes up my whole life. I want to step into this industry.\u201D Everyone is scared up until they reach that point, right? I had dreams, and was relatively confident in my abilities, but I couldn\u2019t answer the question: \u201CIs this industry great enough that even if my dreams are crushed and I\u2019m ruined, I can still laugh in the end and say \u2018Oh well, it happens\u2019?\u201D So I might have had the option of living out my life as a regular salaryman. But while I had been solely devoted to novels up until then, \u201CEva\u201D and \u201CUtena\u201D made me genuinely think \u201CI could work in this world even if it killed me. I\u2019d even die happy.\u201D Fortunately for me, being as secluded as I was, Takeuchi said to me \u201CLet\u2019s make a game, I\u2019ll help you\u201D, so I didn\u2019t die and was able to feed myself instead. But a lot of people entered this industry because of something they admired. It\u2019s a driving force\u2026 Well, I guess it did mess up my whole life (laughs)</p><p><strong>\u2014Are there any aspects of Ikuhara\u2019s work that directly influenced yours? For example, I feel like the particular kind of scariness in \u201CFate\u201D\u2018s Matou Sakura or \u201CTsukihime\u201D\u2018s Kohaku stems from Anthy.</strong></p><p><strong>Nasu:</strong> Not Sakura, as far as I\u2019m aware, but the way Kohaku is scariest when she\u2019s smiling was something I made right after my \u201CUtena\u201D shock so there might be some influence there. Our styles are different so there\u2019s not much influence in terms of character creation, but I forever admire his visual artistry. Even his backgrounds tell a story.</p><p>The visual novel medium I use for my work is fundamentally like kamishibai. It\u2019s a matter of trying to capture the readers\u2019 hearts with only text and static images. When I think about that, what comes to mind is the scene in the latter half of \u201CUtena\u201D where Anthy is being stabbed with a million swords of hatred. Sure, everyone uses solid blacks and reds in their direction, but the sense of it was overwhelmingly different. \u201CEven if I can\u2019t reach that level, aim for art, make something that will stay in people\u2019s hearts and minds\u201D\u2014I think that feeling made me the person I am today. Writers write because we don\u2019t quite trust the power of images. Animators and directors express things visually because they don\u2019t quite trust the power of words. The two groups are normally unable to understand one another, but \u201CUtena\u201D just had so many things that work as a reference.</p><p>For example, a theme of the game \u201CFate/EXTRA CCC\u201D is \u201Cgirls are monsters\u201D. I wanted to make an RPG that reached the height of passion. The way the key background art is dark pink, gothic, and retro-yet-fetishistic is an homage to \u201CUtena\u201D, a sign of my respect for it.</p><p><strong>\u2014On the other hand, the backgrounds in the adaptations of \u201CKara no Kyoukai\u201D or the \u201CFate\u201D series tend more towards realism.</strong></p><p><strong>Nasu:</strong> That\u2019s true. I do think abstract background art that\u2019s pretty but has a do-not-enter atmosphere might be more fitting, but all the other members of the staff shot me down because \u201CThat doesn\u2019t fit Nasu-san\u2019s style\u201D (laughs)</p><p>Once a work is released into the world, it doesn\u2019t belong only to the creator but to the readers as well, so if every reader thinks \u201CThe realistic style is more fitting\u201D, I think that\u2019s the correct choice for the visuals. If I were a novelist, all the responsibility would be on me, so I could make it suit my own tastes. I could write for just one reader, and if it doesn\u2019t sell I could just live on corn snacks for a year (laughs). But I\u2019m making games. I have 15 staff members working on my script along with me, and if we fail, I\u2019m not the only one taking the fall. So I want to listen to the staff\u2019s opinions and make something that will be as widely accepted as possible.</p><h2 id="director-ikuhara-the-swan-emperor" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#director-ikuhara-the-swan-emperor" aria-hidden="true">#</a> DIRECTOR IKUHARA THE SWAN EMPEROR?</h2><p><strong>\u2014Games and anime are different mediums, but one thing they have in common is that they are group productions. What makes Director Ikuhara great from your perspective as a manager and leader?</strong></p><p><strong>Nasu:</strong> An individual can share their visual sense, themes, and ego with five other people. Maybe even ten. But you know, it\u2019s pretty much impossible once you get to thirty people. If you try to force thirty people to share your vision and make a work out of it, the result just becomes something people will vaguely remember having seen somewhere. There\u2019s no getting around that.</p><p>Now, then, that brings us to the works of Ikuhara\u2014why do his works always stand out from the crowd?! I think it\u2019s probably because Ikuhara-san controls everything to communicate his aesthetics and and ideas to the staff. That\u2019s an unbelievable magic power, practically demonic.</p><p>I\u2019ve met Ikuhara-san before, and I asked him \u201CHow do you share your vision?!\u201D, to which he answered, \u201CWell, I just can?\u201D (laughs) What\u2019s amazing about Ikuhara-san is not just that his visuals and themes are beautiful and his characters are powerful, but the directing power that lets him input those things into the staff and get a consistent output.</p><p>I think Anno Hideaki-san is the type to burn himself out in battle\u2014\u201DDevote thyself wholly unto this work\u201D\u2014while Ikuhara-san is more like a beautiful (at least at first glance), swanlike ruler. In Anno-san\u2019s case he\u2019s the one shedding the most blood, so everyone else is like \u201CWell, we gotta stand by him. If we don\u2019t, Anno-san\u2019s a goner.\u201D Ikuhara-san is the opposite extreme, so even if he\u2019s suffering under the surface he never shows it to the staff, and never lets down the image of the beautiful emperor throughout the entire long production process. So everyone trusts him and follows him. When I met him he reminded me of Yang Wen-li, but when it comes to production he\u2019s Reinhard. He\u2019s unbeatable.</p><p><strong>\u2014So which type of leader are you? I can picture you on the front lines with a sword.</strong></p><p><strong>Nasu:</strong> Maybe Job Tr\xFCnicht\u2026 Let\u2019s not go there! (laughs) If it had to be between Yang and Reinhard, I think I\u2019d be Yang. I\u2019m not cut out to be a dictator. Instead, I guess I clean up the problems in everyone\u2019s plans so that they can keep going the direction they want to. When a project gets tough, I\u2019ve always gone \u201CI\u2019ll do the rest myself, so go on to something new and give it your all\u201D, and that\u2019s kind of ingrained into me, but my successors can\u2019t develop if I keep doing this. I\u2019m having trouble with that now. I did plan to back off from \u201CFGO\u201D after one year.</p><p><strong>\u2014Currently \u201CFGO\u201D is releasing a chapter 1.5 by the other main writers.</strong></p><p><strong>Nasu:</strong> That\u2019s right. I thought it would be nice if all four writers could be accepted by the players through their own unique methodologies, so I try to interfere as little as possible. I want the players to understand \u201C\u2018Fate\u2019 isn\u2019t just Nasu Kinoko, the other writers are amazing too.\u201D Otherwise, the series can\u2019t branch out.</p><p>Ikuhara-san and Anno-san, who came before me, have kind of a powerful sense of self and can completely operate the whole staff. Obviously their work is overwhelmingly better for it, but it\u2019s extremely physically taxing, and you might only get the chance for a venture like that once in a lifetime, right? But they\u2019ve done it over and over (laughs) I\u2019m not in the same profession and don\u2019t stand on the same battlefield as them, but inside of me they\u2019re too holy for me to want to approach too closely. I love them, but if I get too close they\u2019ll melt away.</p><p><strong>\u2014In 2016, \u201CShin Godzilla\u201D was released and became a smash hit. Does it energize you to see the creators who influenced you in your student days taking on these big challenges?</strong></p><p><strong>Nasu:</strong> It was really encouraging. Once I\u2019d finished watching it, I felt like running all the way home for no particular reason (laughs) As you age, your stamina and concentration start to run out. I\u2019m always worrying \u201CI used to be able to write for six hours straight, but now I can\u2019t concentrate after three hours. Is my productive power going down?\u201D But seeing the people who have been at it ten years longer than me still creating amazing things proves to me that I can keep going another ten years.</p><p><strong>\u2014Director Shinkai Makoto\u2019s \u201CYour Name\u201D became a hit at the same time. Director Shinkai\u2019s creative career started around the same time as yours, didn\u2019t it?</strong></p><p><strong>Nasu:</strong> While we were working on \u201CTsukihime\u201D, he released \u201CShe and Her Cat\u201D. Though we were in a different field, we were trying to create something just by ourselves without the backing of a big company as well. It made me feel like we were on the verge of an age where people with a shared vision would be able to create things together without any excess background noise mixed in.</p><p><strong>\u2014Thank you very much. In closing, do you have any hopes for Director Ikuhara\u2019s future work?</strong></p><p><strong>Nasu:</strong> You\u2019re asking what I\u2019d have Director Ikuhara make for me if I was a rich oil magnate? Hmmm\u2026 first off, something filled with messy interpersonal relationships and missed connections that still shows something beautiful would feel best, so a human drama. After that, I might want to see some retro-futuristic 80\u2019s sci-fi, like \u201C2001: A Space Odyssey\u201D. Also, I\u2019m not familiar with the \u201CSailor Moon\u201D-era Director Ikuhara, so some corny eye-popping entertainment. I\u2019d also like to see him break out of the shell of his existing work, so a stylish period piece might not be a bad idea. If it was something with courtesans as a theme I bet we\u2019d see something really beautiful\u2026</p><p>But Director Ikuhara wouldn\u2019t be Director Ikuhara if he didn\u2019t attack me from an angle I never expected. I\u2019ll eat anything he puts in front of me. To the lovable fools who thought \u201CI\u2019m going to step into this industry\u201D, Ikuhara-san is the brightest star in the sky. Forever.</p><p>(Nasu Kinoko, author; Aoyagi Mihoko, writer)<br> Recorded March 24, Tokyo</p>', 93);
