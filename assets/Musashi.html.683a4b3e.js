You were cheating! I didn&#39;t even see when you drew your sword!</p><p><strong>A\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Seriously, cut that out! What kind of nonsense is a move I can&#39;t see even after I already saw through your movement!? You think people can just swing their swords around like chopsticks or something!?</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Strength is not from the body alone, but from a state of perfect zen, and absolute purity. That was the ultimate strike, one I spent my entire career as a swordsman perfecting.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> And yet, you were able to parry it somehow. I didn&#39;t pay much attention to this twaddle about \u201Cthe greatest swordsman under heaven,\u201D since it sounded like you made it up...</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> ...But now, I must cut you down. No matter what, I must cut you down.</p><p><strong>A\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Wait! Waitwaitwait! No way, I don&#39;t fight when I can&#39;t win!</p><p><strong>A\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Besides, you tricked me! What do you mean the name \u201CYagyu of Edo\u201D is meaningless!?</p><p><strong>A\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Your skill with a sword is godlike! The people who told me your style was child&#39;s play lied!</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> ...Of course. Only the one who rules our nation knows the truth of my skill. Such is not meant for the likes of lowly peasants.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> If you want to curse anything for being cut down in the middle of the street, curse your own aura as a swordsman.</p><p><strong>A\uFF1A???:</strong><br> ...Well, I can&#39;t really complain since I was the one who picked a fight with you... Wait, no, I will complain!</p><p><strong>A\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Shouldn&#39;t a powerful swordsman and government official like you just ignore taunts from a wanderer like me!?</p><p><strong>A\uFF1A???:</strong><br> But no! Not only did you ambush me, but you weren&#39;t even taking the fight seriously!?</p><p><strong>A\uFF1A???:</strong><br> That&#39;s not fair! You bully! Bullying the weak is bad!</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>A\uFF1A???:</strong><br> (...Looking at him, it seems nothing I say will matter anymore. This old geezer is unlike any opponent I&#39;ve faced before.)</p><p><strong>A\uFF1A???:</strong><br> (I can&#39;t see his attacks. I can&#39;t win. I guess this is the end of the road for me... Hm?)</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> ...Hm.</p><p><strong>A\uFF1A???:</strong><br> YES! It&#39;s that thing again! Thank you, O merciful bodhisattva!</p><p><strong>A\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Since it looks like luck is on my side, I better take advantage of it and run! Sorry, but our fight ends here, Yagyu...something!</p><p><strong>A\uFF1A???:</strong><br> I won&#39;t taunt you again, so just forget about me! Bye!</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>A\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Phew, that worked! I&#39;m getting so dizzy right noooooow!</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> ...She&#39;s gone. To think she would be versed in the demon arts as well as swordsmanship.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> I may have injured her, but her head is still on her shoulders... To survive my secret technique not once, but twice...</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Shinmen Musashi-no-Kami Fujiwara-no-Harunobu. I will never forget your name.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...Wait...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> ...This is...</p><hr><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...I&#39;ve seen this place before?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> ...This looks familiar...</p><hr><p><strong>A\uFF1A???:</strong><br> ...Ugh... Hmmm... Argh, my head hurts...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Someone has collapsed!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Hey, are you okay!?</p><hr><p><strong>A\uFF1A???:</strong><br> ...! This is nothing, I can still fight!</p><p><strong>A\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Wait... Huh? Who...are you? Where&#39;s that scary old geezer?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...You... You were about to kill me...</p><p><strong>A\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Sorry about that! Y&#39;know, if you tell me what&#39;s going on, I&#39;ll be even MORE apologetic. I&#39;ll even buy you a bowl of udon after!</p><p><strong>A\uFF1A???:</strong><br> But, before that...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> ...No, who are YOU?</p><p><strong>A\uFF1A???:</strong><br> I asked the question first. You&#39;re dressed funny... Hmm, looks like you&#39;re from another country?</p><p><strong>A\uFF1A???:</strong><br> In any case...</p><hr><p><strong>A\uFF1A???:</strong><br> You, unfamiliar foreigner! Before you name yourself, you must answer this!</p><p><strong>A\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Who in the world am I!? And where exactly is this!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...You lost your memories?</p><hr><p><strong>A\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Yes, it seems that way. I must have hit my head hard, and forgot who I am.</p><p><strong>A\uFF1A???:</strong><br> So, I&#39;d appreciate it if you could tell me my name. Oh, but if you don&#39;t know, that&#39;s fine too.</p><p><strong>A\uFF1A???:</strong><br> If you could just point me to a nearby tea shop, I&#39;ll handle the rest myself.</p><p><strong>A\uFF1A???:</strong><br> So? Do you know my name? Do you know anything about this place?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...I&#39;m sorry...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I&#39;m afraid I don&#39;t know either...</p><hr><p><strong>A\uFF1A???:</strong><br> I see... Yup, then nothing I can do. This stuff happens.</p><p><strong>A\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Sorry for asking so much. Anyway, let&#39;s get back to the introduction.</p><p><strong>A\uFF1A???:</strong><br> What&#39;s your name? My memories don&#39;t matter, but I can&#39;t call someone I just met \u201CHey You,\u201D right?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Fujimaru.</p><hr><p><strong>A\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Okay, Fujimaru. I&#39;m sorry about slashing at you just now.</p><p><strong>A\uFF1A???:</strong><br> You revived me, right? After I passed out? Well, it looks like no one stole anything off me...</p><p><strong>A\uFF1A???:</strong><br> It seems luck is on my side again this time. For someone as cute as you...</p><p><strong>A\uFF1A???:</strong><br> ...No, for someone as pure-hearted as you to wake me up.</p><p><strong>Oni B:</strong><br> Heh...hehe! This new year is starting off great for us!</p><p><strong>Oni B:</strong><br> Hey, partner! We&#39;ve got some humans washed up over here! TWO OF THEM!</p><p><strong>Oni B:</strong><br> Look at that one, tasty-looking meat and nice clothes! She even got swords around her waist!</p><p><strong>Oni B:</strong><br> That [\u2642 guy /\u2640 girl] over there, though... No flair at all. No swords, no fancy getup...</p><p><strong>Oni B:</strong><br> But perfect for physical labor! Let&#39;s grab [\u2642 him /\u2640 her] so [\u2642 he /\u2640 she] can make our meals!</p><p><strong>Oni A:</strong><br> ...Not bad. It&#39;s about time we started aiming higher.</p><p><strong>Oni A:</strong><br> A full-fledged oni has human slaves. It will keep those weirdos staying at the gate in check.</p><p><strong>Oni A:</strong><br> Hey, you two humans there. If you don&#39;t want to die, come quietly and do as we say.</p><p><strong>Oni A:</strong><br> If you resist, we won&#39;t have any choice: we&#39;ll have to hurt one of you. Real bad.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...Go on! Run!</p><p><strong>A\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Of course. If running would take care of it, I&#39;d be happy to. But, it doesn&#39;t seem like running will do the trick.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Can you fight?</p><p><strong>A\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Hmm... My memory&#39;s hazy... Can&#39;t even remember my own name... Still, I&#39;m guessing this isn&#39;t something we can just run away from, so...</p><hr><p><strong>A\uFF1A???:</strong><br> I mean, those are real oni, right? Here we go again... I always end up in weird places like this.</p><p><strong>A\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Fine, I shall fight! Fujimaru, I&#39;ll trust you to cover me!</p><p><strong>A\uFF1A???:</strong><br> I don&#39;t know where you idiots came from, but you sure have guts, talking weird trash like that to a couple of strangers who washed up on a beach!</p><p><strong>A\uFF1A???:</strong><br> I can tolerate thieves, miscreants, oni, centipede monsters...even Osakabe-hime! But I just can&#39;t stand evil jerks like you!</p><p><strong>A\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Now, an honest match, you oni-looking villains! Playtime is over. I&#39;ll send you back to hell!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Oni B:</strong></p><p>Eeeeeek! What&#39;s with this human!? She&#39;s super strong!</p><p><strong>Oni A:</strong><br> That dual sword stance... Ferocious, yet perfectly controlled... The flexibility and ability to adapt to any and all situations...</p><p><strong>Oni A:</strong><br> This woman... Don&#39;t tell me... She&#39;s the famous Miyamoto Musashi! The one who killed off all the disciples of the Yoshioka school!</p><p><strong>Oni B:</strong></p><p>Whaaat!? You know of her, partner!?</p><p><strong>Oni A:</strong><br> Indeed. I once devoted myself to the way of the sword. I&#39;m familiar with all the famous swordsmen.</p><p><strong>Oni A:</strong><br> This woman is Miyamoto Musashi, without a doubt! No, but... Woman... A woman...?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Miyamoto Musashi...!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> ...Mmm, I guess that&#39;s my name. Sounds right to me.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Do you know about me, Fujimaru? Is the name Miyamoto Musashi famous or something?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Apparently your name is Musashi.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Yeah. Sounds about right to me, so let&#39;s go with that.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Although... I can&#39;t remember what kind of person this \u201CMusashi\u201D is... Well, she&#39;s probably a good-for-nothing person!</p><hr><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> In any case, we&#39;re still in the middle of a match. Hey, oni, thanks for telling me my name.</p><p><strong>Oni B:</strong></p><p>Eeek! If that&#39;s Musashi, there&#39;s no way we&#39;d win! Sorry, Sukeroku, die for me!</p><p><strong>Oni A:</strong></p><p>Whoa, don&#39;t push me to the front! What are you, an evil oni!? Oh... Wait... Yeah...</p><p><strong>Oni A:</strong><br> Ugh arrrgh! I&#39;m going to die here!</p><p><strong>Oni A:</strong><br> ...Hm? I&#39;m not dead? I&#39;m still alive?</p><p><strong>Oni A:</strong><br> You mean Musashi let me live? The same Musashi they say kills everyone she meets?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Where did you hear that?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> My memory is still hazy right now, but I won&#39;t cut down an opponent who&#39;s lost the will to fight.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> We&#39;re not at war or anything. Isn&#39;t it a bit barbaric to kill someone on first sight?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> If I can scare away my opponent through intimidation, that&#39;s a perfect victory.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> All I want&#39;s money and fame. Killing my opponents will only make people hate me!</p><p><strong>Oni A:</strong><br> I-is that so...? You say that, but each of your attacks was powerful enough to kill...</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Well, yeah. Obviously. I didn&#39;t practice my bladework just so I could go easy on opponents.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> That said, I don&#39;t need a trail of blood and corpses following me. Only a true swordsman can stop a slash mid-strike.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> I don&#39;t fight if there&#39;s nothing in it for me. Lemme see...</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Weeell, if you have a bounty on your head, I&#39;mma cut it off and get that bounty! But you don&#39;t... Do you?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> You don&#39;t look like you got a lotta money, or like someone&#39;d be paying for your head.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Okay, then! Hate the sin, not the...um...oni. You know what? Just consider yourself lucky, and forget about me!</p><p><strong>Oni A:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Right! Since I think I know my name now, let me reintroduce myself. I am Miyamoto Musashi! Probably.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Nice to meetcha, Fujimaru! For now, let&#39;s head to the tea shop I see on top of that ridge!</p><h2 id="interlude-first-gate" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#interlude-first-gate" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Interlude : First Gate</h2><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> I see. Chaldea, Servants, and Rayshifts, oh my...</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> I&#39;ve never heard of any of those, but I have an idea of who you are now.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> And you&#39;re saying I&#39;m one of those so-called Servants?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> With that dual-wielding stance? Definitely.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Musashi was a famous hero and swordsman.</p><hr><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> ...Hmm... That doesn&#39;t sound right... I definitely don&#39;t remember getting treated like a hero, or a famed swordsman...</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> And it&#39;s not just &#39;cause I don&#39;t remember much about myself, y&#39;know?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> That kinda...makes my nose itchy. I can just feel that something about that&#39;s a bit off.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> I don&#39;t think I&#39;m the same swordsman you know of, Fujimaru. That&#39;s for sure, but...</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Eh, the little stuff can wait! Let&#39;s fill up our tummies first!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Miss, bring more dumplings! Also, bring me some udon! Plain or not doesn&#39;t matter, just gimme what you got!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Losing your memory doesn&#39;t bother you?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Tee hee hee. Just knowing my name&#39;s making this better.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Besides, there&#39;s no use worrying about what you don&#39;t know, right?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Do you have any money?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> ...! Don&#39;t tell me... Fujimaru, you don&#39;t have any money?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Hmm... Okay, let&#39;s just sell the shop owner something of ours! This sword guard is quite well-crafted, no?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Don&#39;t worry, if I sell it, it&#39;ll cover travel expenses for a while. I&#39;ll share some with you too, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> I mean, selling it&#39;ll kinda ruin its legacy and stuff... Eh! Luckily, I still have other swords.</p><hr><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Anywho, you woke up on this island, and you remember having being here before... Am I correct?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> How did you get back to your original world before? I wonder if that strange hole is somewhere on this island, too?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Original world...?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Don&#39;t tell me... You, too?</p><hr><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Yep! Already got used to it. Happens to me a lot. I just kinda meander into weird worlds.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Last time, I ended up in the western part of this place called \u201CAmerica.\u201D I had to fight a bunch of guys with pistols.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> The priestess that took care of me then said that I was a stranger.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Apparently, I&#39;m the sort who gets spirited away all the time. That&#39;s why I end up in all sorts of places.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Usually, there&#39;s a hole to return to the original world nearby. So, long as I can find it, I can get back to the previous world.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> A swordsman who Rayshifts without realizing it...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Isn&#39;t that a big deal...?</p><hr><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Naaah! That&#39;s just how things have always been for me! It&#39;s not like I&#39;m dying or anything!</p><p><strong>B\uFF1A???:</strong><br> I see. Openhearted and cheerful like in all the stories.</p><p><strong>B\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Even in a predicament that would kill an ordinary person, she just shrugs it off... I&#39;m at a loss for words.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> The oni from earlier!</p><hr><p><strong>B\uFF1A???:</strong><br> No, hold on, Master from Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Sukeroku:</strong><br> I am Sukeroku. Raiden-no-Sukeroku. Caretaker of the fields and farms on this island.</p><p><strong>Sukeroku:</strong><br> An oni making a meager living in Onigashima, a land that lost its master and is now fated to disappear.</p><p><strong>Sukeroku:</strong><br> I couldn&#39;t help but be concerned about that woman saying she was Musashi. That&#39;s why I followed you...</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Oh, right. Don&#39;t just stand there. Care to sit next to me?</p><p><strong>Sukeroku:</strong><br> No, I can&#39;t sit next to Miyamoto Musashi, even if you&#39;re only claiming to be him. I&#39;m afraid my head would come toppling off my shoulders at any moment.</p><p><strong>Sukeroku:</strong><br> I think I&#39;d prefer to stand. ...Also, I came here bearing good news.</p><p><strong>Sukeroku:</strong><br> Onigashima is an island someone created, then abandoned. This place doesn&#39;t exist in the real world anymore.</p><p><strong>Sukeroku:</strong><br> This is the boundary of dreams and illusions.</p><p><strong>Sukeroku:</strong><br> These days, the only visitors we get are oni with nowhere else to go... Just like us...</p><p><strong>Sukeroku:</strong><br> But today must be quite the special day. Many travelers have wandered into this dream.</p><p><strong>Sukeroku:</strong><br> Three great oni occupying the gates. A Master of Chaldea washing up ashore.</p><p><strong>Sukeroku:</strong><br> And, a lady swordsman calling herself Miyamoto Musashi tumbles into a place she&#39;s wholly unconnected to.</p><p><strong>Sukeroku:</strong><br> Each of you with unknown origins, but doubtless foreigners. If so, you want to return to your native worlds, yes?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Yes. The dumplings here suck!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I really do need to get back to Chaldea...</p><hr><p><strong>Sukeroku:</strong><br> Well, then matters are simple. Head for the summit of Onigashima.</p><p><strong>Sukeroku:</strong><br> \u201CHer\u201D shrine still sits on the summit of Onigashima. A sanctuary shrouded in her divine aura.</p><p><strong>Sukeroku:</strong><br> This world&#39;s god will reject anything that&#39;s deemed unnecessary.</p><p><strong>Sukeroku:</strong><br> Given that, foreigners like you should get \u201Cbounced back\u201D to your original world the moment you reach the summit.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> That&#39;s splendid. Thanks for the advice, Lord Raiden-no-Sukeroku.</p><p><strong>Sukeroku:</strong><br> S-sure, you did spare my life, so I owed you one. No need to than\u2013</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Okay! I, Fujimaru, and Lord Sukeroku, shall proceed to the summit of Onigashima!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> We just need to go past that gate in the distance, right? You can guide us, hold our luggage, and make our meals!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Oh, and I&#39;m not really asking. I&#39;m telling.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Defy me, and I&#39;ll give you some PAIN! So, better just do what I say!</p><p><strong>Sukeroku:</strong></p><p>Whaaaaaat!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> (Politeness x oppression = Musashi&#39;s power...!)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> (And now we have yet another weirdo Saber...)</p><hr><p><strong>Sukeroku:</strong><br> In the first place, Miyamoto Musashi is known as the most powerful swordsman in the history of Japan. He is said to have lived in the early Edo period.</p><p><strong>Sukeroku:</strong><br> The \u201CNiten Ichiryu\u201D he created is a style that utilized both long and short swords, and is considered the quintessential \u201Cdual-wielding style\u201D in Japan.</p><p><strong>Sukeroku:</strong><br> The many duels Musashi fought with other swordmasters while he was in his twenties are known across the land, and serve as inspiration for a great deal of literature and entertainment.</p><p><strong>Sukeroku:</strong><br> Among us oni, Musashi is synonymous with the dual-wielding style, and is both feared and loved at the same time.</p><p><strong>Sukeroku:</strong><br> So much so that many oni children would swing around two clubs pretending to be Musashi.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> The Niten Ichiryu... The Book of Five Rings... The Throne of Void... Ah... I am starting to remember things...</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> I haven&#39;t reached the fifth blade yet.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> When I was out in the Sagami area in hopes of training, I met a strange old man in a gazebo while sheltering from the rain...</p><p><strong>Sukeroku:</strong><br> ...I see. They say Musashi was born in Ohara, Sakushu.</p><p><strong>Sukeroku:</strong><br> His father&#39;s name was Shinmen Munisai, the martial arts coach of the Shinmen clan in Takeyama Castle. His lord was the one who gave him the name \u201CShinmen.\u201D</p><p><strong>Sukeroku:</strong><br> Munisai set up a dojo for jitte skills in Miyamoto, Yoshino. Musashi considered this home, so later used Miyamoto as a surname...</p><p><strong>Sukeroku:</strong><br> Stories of Miyamoto Musashi are popular, but Shinmen Munisai was incredibly skilled as well.</p><p><strong>Sukeroku:</strong><br> Consider that the name he gave himself is \u201CMuni,\u201D which means \u201Cunique.\u201D You have to be quite skilled to consider calling yourself that!</p><p><strong>Sukeroku:</strong><br> To be unique is to be the singular, ultimate one. In other words, it&#39;s a show of a powerful ego asserting none follow in his footsteps.</p><p><strong>Sukeroku:</strong><br> Musashi, his son, calling his own style \u201CNiten\u201D is surely respect for his great father\u2014</p><p><strong>Sukeroku:</strong><br> Hmm? I&#39;m getting a chill somehow. Do oni catch colds as well?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Musashi is totally glaring at you!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I don&#39;t know why, but don&#39;t talk about her dad!</p><hr><p><strong>Sukeroku:</strong><br> Oh! Right! There&#39;s not much point in trying to recount Musashi&#39;s history with her standing right here, is there? It&#39;s certainly nothing she doesn&#39;t know!</p><p><strong>Sukeroku:</strong><br> Sorry about that. A slip of the tongue. It&#39;s just, none of the oni are interested in stories of this sort, so...</p><p><strong>Sukeroku:</strong><br> I... I can&#39;t help but be attracted to swords. Because of that, I&#39;ve spent a lot of time rifling through books and documents alone.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Well, I&#39;ve never heard of any oni versed in swordsmanship. On the other hand, I have heard of people becoming oni-like in pursuit of swordsmanship.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Oh well, I already knew that was the version of the story in your world.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Wait, what do you mean?</p><hr><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> In my world, Shinmen Munisai was as violent as a storm,</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> and his child was abandoned simply because she was a girl.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> But wait! She wasn&#39;t discouraged by the abandonment! Nope! She built a shed to live right under that bastard father&#39;s nose!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> I don&#39;t know what kind of swordsman Miyamoto Musashi was in the worlds of Lord Sukeroku or Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> But in MY world, \u201CMiyamoto Musashi\u201D is still a nameless swordsman that lives each day in self-indulgence.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> ...Well, someone once told me I was from a world that went toootally off the rails\u2013a Pruning Theoretical Phenomenon. That&#39;s why I&#39;m different than the other Musashi, they said.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> But the Musashi in your world became famous? That&#39;s pretty awesome.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> When you get down to it, Miyamoto Musashi is just a careless sorta fellow. But in his version, he was at least able to touch the Throne of Void.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Pruning Theoretical Phenomenon?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Throne of Void...?</p><hr><p><strong>Sukeroku:</strong><br> Pruning Theoretical Phenomenon...? I&#39;ve never heard the term before. What does it mean?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Who knows? Perhaps it&#39;s a destiny like the morning dew. I don&#39;t know all that much myself.</p><p><strong>Sukeroku:</strong><br> This is the first great gate. This was the gate Kazakoemaru guarded in the past...</p><p><strong>C\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Hoooooohohoho! How dare you show up, seedy bald oni and country girl who doesn&#39;t even have a long-sleeved kimono!</p><p><strong>C\uFF1A???:</strong><br> It&#39;s the New Year! The first dawn of the year! The neighborhood overflows with New Year gifts and the pharaoh&#39;s sun!</p><p><strong>C\uFF1A???:</strong><br> No day is as joyous as today! In other words... Yes, in other words, it&#39;s MY turn!</p><p><strong>C\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Hiiiyah!</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong><br> Hiiiyah!</p><p><strong>Sukeroku:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong><br> Eh... What is this... This quiet as if this was a mall where every store was shuttered and closed...</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong><br> ...That was a mistake. Making an elegant and conservative entrance just because it is the New Year... What was I thinking!?</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong><br> Right! A pharaoh must be brazen like the glimmering sun for any and every occasion!</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong><br> Just like the great Ozymandias! And Nitocris!</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> You know I&#39;m not like that.</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong><br> Yes! I appreciate your support from the bottom of my heart, Pharaoh Nitocris!</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> That&#39;s... That&#39;s really not...what I meant...</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong><br> All right! Now that I have my support, let&#39;s try this again!</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong><br> Hiiiiyah!</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong><br> Hooohohoho! Surprised you made it here, scrawny ugly oni and girl with three Buster Cards!</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong><br> But your advance ends here! I will not allow any further violence!</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong><br> That&#39;s because... Yes, that&#39;s because... I&#39;m going to turn this island into my second castle!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Second castle...!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> She...she wouldn&#39;t repeat the nightmare of Castle Csejte!</p><hr><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong><br> Right! I couldn&#39;t borrow a pyramid from Pharaoh Ozymandias this time...</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong><br> ...But I have superior money management skills! Give me three days, and this gate will be renovated into a classy spa!</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong><br> Once I&#39;m done, you will all be able to rest to your heart&#39;s content! The first three days of the year are special, so take it easy!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Really? We have no money but you&#39;ll let us stay in an inn?</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong><br> Heh, of course, samurai girl. That obi you have is quite exquisite! I am always looking for new girlfriends!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> So she says. No idea what she&#39;s talking about, but she seems awfully generous, I guess?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> It&#39;s the New Year, right? How about we forget about going to the summit and just rest here?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You realize she&#39;s going to put you to work, right?</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong><br> Heh... To think you would call me out on that. I expect nothing less from the Master who saved humanity.</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong><br> Six hours per shift, two shifts a day, each separated by a six-hour break.</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong><br> With this miraculous labor law, I can turn a single working day into two. That&#39;s how you lot will build my new castle!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Our New Year&#39;s vacation will end!</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong><br> ...!</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong><br> N-no, you can take longer than those special three days. I mean, some schools are taking the entire week off, no?</p><p><strong>Sukeroku:</strong><br> Who knows? I heard people are starting to work a lot sooner now.</p><hr><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> ...I knew it! She runs a shady business!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> The only real miracle in the world should be udon! Let&#39;s defeat her and move on!</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong><br> She holds her head so high...! Not only do you not go with my plan, but you accuse me of running a shady business! Now I MUST fight!</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong><br> I am the final heir of the Pharaoh Fighting Style... The very incarnation of beauty, Cleopatra VII Philopator!</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong><br> I don&#39;t know what Heroic Spirit you are, but I&#39;m not just a supreme beauty!</p><p><strong>Sukeroku:</strong><br> What... Pharaoh Fighting Style...!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You know of it, Raiden!?</p><hr><p><strong>Sukeroku:</strong><br> Yes... In a land far to the west, someone devised a magical attack strengthened by pompous acts and laughs!</p><p><strong>Sukeroku:</strong><br> The more pompous and cocky you act, the greater king you become... To think those are the requirements to inherit such a fighting style...</p><p><strong>Sukeroku:</strong><br> Obviously, I don&#39;t need to tell you that once you inherit the style, you always look at people with your head held\u2014</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Okay, stand back, Lord Sukeroku! That girl&#39;s weapon is a sickle chain as big as Baiken&#39;s!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong><br> Kyaaah...!</p><p><strong>Sukeroku:</strong><br> Amazing! The match is over!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Winner, Shinmen Musashi-no-Kami!</p><hr><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Ah, hearing that declaration of the victor felt so good! Thanks, Fujimaru!</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong><br> Tch... You people don&#39;t know a good opportunity when you see one!</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong><br> This is where you should be praising me! This is your chance to receive the greatest New Year gift ever: my unparalleled beauty!</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong><br> But I will not give up! My dream of a fitness boot camp island\u2014</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong><br> For the sake of my dear Caesar, I will make Cleopatra Fitness Island a reality!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Huh? She disappeared. I didn&#39;t even hit her that hard, though...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> She went back to Chaldea.</p><hr><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> I see. Glad I didn&#39;t end up killing her. Okay, moving on!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> From the look of things, these, um... Servants, you call them? I bet they&#39;ll be at the other gates, too.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> It&#39;ll be good if we can talk things out with them, but if we have to fight, that&#39;s fine too!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Wielding my sword will probably restore my memories, and I&#39;m happy for any chance to fight a strong opponent!</p><h2 id="interlude-second-gate" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#interlude-second-gate" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Interlude : Second Gate</h2><p><strong>Tamamo Cat Woof:</strong><br> Hahaha! Master here on New Year&#39;s, welcome! I am the dream cat guarding the second gate.</p><p><strong>Tamamo Cat Woof:</strong><br> My name is Tamamo Cat Woof! There will be no lounging around a kotatsu eating mandarin oranges here!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Now it&#39;s a fox-girl? Fujimaru, your friends are weird.</p><p><strong>Tamamo Cat Woof:</strong><br> Of course! Master has an A Rank in Endurance, and will listen to even the ramblings of a wild cat with patience!</p><p><strong>Tamamo Cat Woof:</strong><br> However. However...! This cat is ticked!</p><p><strong>Tamamo Cat Woof:</strong><br> I&#39;ve been carefully getting ready for a nice traditional New Year&#39;s meal since the end of last year...</p><p><strong>Tamamo Cat Woof:</strong><br> I was willing to skip the last battle for it. Honestly, being an all-star is so annoying.</p><p><strong>Tamamo Cat Woof:</strong><br> So I was peeling my shrimp, resolved to duck out of any battles...</p><p><strong>Tamamo Cat Woof:</strong><br> When Master... Master... Master ordered the New Years meal at a convenience store!</p><p><strong>Tamamo Cat Woof:</strong><br> And [\u2642 he /\u2640 she] even ordered one for me! So considerate! But that turned out to just really make me angry!</p><p><strong>Sukeroku:</strong><br> Ah... That&#39;s no good. Don&#39;t you know why New Year&#39;s meals are so elaborate, kid?</p><p><strong>Sukeroku:</strong><br> They&#39;re made of food that lasts so that the lady of the house doesn&#39;t have to cook for three days straight.</p><p><strong>Sukeroku:</strong><br> And they&#39;re made elaborately and lovingly with as many of the husband&#39;s favorite foods as possible. It&#39;s their way of showing their gratitude at the end of the year.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Huh?</p><hr><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Yes... They say New Year&#39;s Day dictates the rest of the year, you know. So traditionally for the wife, pleasing her significant other with a homemade New Year&#39;s meal...</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> ...is a way to infuse the relationship with love, spirit, joy, and mutual support for the whole year ahead!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> And you just went out and got a store-bought one...? Even my jerk dad gets quiet in front of a New Year&#39;s meal...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Huh!?</p><hr><p><strong>Tamamo Cat Woof:</strong><br> That&#39;s right! This kitty&#39;s chest is about to burst with sadness!</p><p><strong>Tamamo Cat Woof:</strong><br> Actually, it did burst. And the result was\u2014</p><p><strong>Tamamo Cat Woof Woof:</strong><br> Happy New Year, Master! I am Tamamo Cat Woof Woof, the hawk!</p><p><strong>Tamamo Cat Woof Woof Woof:</strong><br> Never get store-bought meals! I&#39;m Tamamo Cat Woof Woof Woof, and I&#39;m taking it to the danger zone!</p><p><strong>Tamamo Cat Woof:</strong><br> As you can see, the sadness split my heart into three pieces! And the result was the raging feline, Tamamo Cat.</p><p><strong>Tamamo Cat Woof Woof:</strong><br> Hehehe. One&#39;s good enough, and now there&#39;s two more of us. You&#39;re gonna need a whole lot of carrots!</p><p><strong>Tamamo Cat Woof Woof:</strong><br> Now we have no choice but to open up a maid caf\xE9, or rather a maid CATf\xE9! But where do we get the cats?</p><p><strong>Tamamo Cat Woof Woof Woof:</strong><br> Impressive, a maid enterprising enough to open up a caf\xE9! How modern! Does that make Master the caf\xE9 owner?</p><p><strong>Tamamo Cat Woof:</strong><br> That&#39;s right, kitties! So let&#39;s grab our Master!</p><p><strong>Tamamo Cat Woof:</strong><br> Open Caaaaaats! Eagle, Jaguar, Bear... LET&#39;S COMBINE!</p><p><strong>Tamamo Cat Woof:</strong><br> Let&#39;s go, Master!

You should be ashamed of yourself!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Yeah. Dual-wielding isn&#39;t a Saber style at all.</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> That is correct. I knew you were the type of Master who would understand, Fujimaru. Hello!</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> Here&#39;s your New Year&#39;s present. It&#39;s red bean paste balls they sell at a station on planet Guntama.</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> Anyway, did you hear that, newbie!?

No way! Ninjas don&#39;t stand out like that.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> And her skill with the sword seems like the real deal. It&#39;s a style I&#39;ve never seen before.

I&#39;ve never met anybody so deserving of my blade!</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> Umm... When you say that with a smile on your face, it&#39;s like you&#39;re telling me you like me. You&#39;re making me blush!</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> ...This is bad... I get the same sense from this Saber as I did from that kimono-clad street murderer!</p><hr><p><strong>X:</strong><br> Either way, I&#39;m going to attack like I&#39;m the victor of this fight!

Saber Ninja Technique, you say!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I knew you would know about this, Raiden.</p><hr><p><strong>Sukeroku:</strong><br> Yes, it&#39;s a demonic technique some traveler taught to the King of Knights\u2013after the latter crossed the sea by mistake and got lost on Mt.

I mean, would actually exist!</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> Heh. I may not have Nameless Red or Babbagen with me this time, but I do have barbaric techniques that can only be used alone!</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> Get ready, dual-wielder! And be careful, Fujimaru!</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> Don&#39;t underestimate me just because it&#39;s New Year&#39;s!

Sure, I&#39;ll do whatever I need to in order to win, but my policy is to master a single technique!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Niten Ichiryu is an attempt to challenge and overcome an absolute \u201Cone\u201D!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> I&#39;ve set my eyes on your weakness!

It was enough to drive me mad, had I let you go.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> ...And you defeated me.

I&#39;ll kill someone for that reason.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Indeed. So then you defeated me, and I wandered the world harboring a grudge.

That&#39;s not it, Musashi.</p><p><strong>Oni:</strong><br> There are no doubt better swordsmen, greater masters than you.</p><p><strong>Oni:</strong><br> But that is not what I mean by your greatest foe.</p><p><strong>Oni:</strong><br> It&#39;s the path that you seek. To a swordsman, the greatest foe is one who has mastered the path, the Origin opposite to their own.</p><p><strong>Oni:</strong><br> But...but, that will never be fulfilled. Such a person doesn&#39;t even exist.</p><p><strong>Oni:</strong><br> The Swordsman of the Heavenly Eye. That path where zero rivals one is, in other words, infinity.</p><p><strong>Oni:</strong><br> No swordsman has ever reached infinity. Such a path is something no one can ever reach.</p><p><strong>Oni:</strong><br> Thus...your journey will never end. You are just like a drifting boat\u2014</p><p><strong>Oni:</strong><br> Oh... How I pity you, Musashi. How sad you are, Musashi.</p><p><strong>Oni:</strong><br> All your talent will never pay off. Even with all your training, you will never get a chance to truly use it...</p><p><strong>Oni:</strong><br> Like a flower blooming in the twilight, you will only scatter idly.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Begone to your next life. Someday, I will join you.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> ...Musashi.</p><hr><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> All right. Now that the pain in the neck is gone, it really is time to say goodbye.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> That oni said I can&#39;t go back to my old world, but don&#39;t let it bother you too much.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> If nothing else, I can go back to the world I was in before I came here. Just like how you&#39;ll wake up in Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Oh, if you do make it safely back, immortalize me in a journal or something.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Well, we were companions for a while. A really, really short while, though...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I want you to remember, too.</p><hr><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> ...Yes, of course! Anyway, goodbye, Master!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> ...Oh, right! I&#39;m so dumb. How could I just realize this now?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> A once-a-year joyous and happy event\u2014 of course it was fun!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> This was the first dream you had in the new year!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Yeah. See you later, Musashi!</p><hr><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou, foou?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Good morning, Senpai. Happy New Year.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> As I promised last night, I am here for your seven o&#39;clock wake-up call!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> You&#39;re going to help Da Vinci with her mochi-making party, right?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I can&#39;t wait to\u2014Master?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Um, is something wrong? It looks like you were crying...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...I don&#39;t know.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> ...I think I had a strange dream...</p><hr><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou, fooou?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I see. But it wasn&#39;t a bad one, was it?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> How do I know, you ask? I can tell. You look very happy.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It was sad, but there was also something good... That&#39;s the look you always have when that happens.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou. Fou!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...I see. Happy New Year, Mash.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Let&#39;s go see Da Vinci!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong></p><p>Right! I&#39;ll accompany you on our first mission of 2019, Master!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou, fouuu!</p>', 590);
