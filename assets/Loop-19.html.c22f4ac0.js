Let us decide, once and for all, which one of us is the king of this harbor!\u201D</p><hr><p>Archer is in high spirits, while Lancer just looks fed up with the whole thing.</p><p>...Told you, haven&#39;t I?</p><p>Speak of the devil and he doth appear.</p><hr><p>I leave the harbor as quietly as possible, so as to not get between them.</p><p>....Praying, in my heart, that the guy in red won&#39;t have cause to change his name from Archer to Angler any time soon.</p><hr><h3 id="emiya-residence\u30FBstart-of-night-things-to-do-1" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#emiya-residence\u30FBstart-of-night-things-to-do-1" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Emiya Residence\u30FBStart of Night Things to do</h3><h2 id="day-3" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#day-3" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Day 3</h2><h3 id="school\u30FBday-3-36-invisible-servant" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#school\u30FBday-3-36-invisible-servant" aria-hidden="true">#</a> School\u30FBDay 3-36 Invisible Servant</h3><hr><p>Afternoon at the schoolyard.</p><p>Maybe it&#39;s just the timing, but I see no signs of club activities.</p><p>As I look over the deserted grounds... I think I just saw somebody, standing with their back to me.</p><p>\u201CNo way, could that be...?\u201D</p><hr><p>She followed me all the way here.</p><p>\u201CHm? I knew it.\u201D</p><p>My eyes weren&#39;t playing tricks on me, after all. Yep, that&#39;s Rider.</p><hr><p>\u201CHeeeey, Rider?\u201D</p><p>\u201C...Oh, is it you, Shirou?\u201D</p><p>I call out to her as I step on the dry grass.</p><p>With the rustling sound of my footsteps, Rider would notice me approaching even if I stayed silent.</p><hr><p>\u201CIt sure is unusual to see you come all the way to school on a day off.\u201D</p><p>\u201C............\u201D</p><p>\u201CIs it something to do with Sakura?\u201D</p><p>Usually, when Rider comes to school, it is somehow related to Sakura.</p><p>There&#39;s no point in Rider being here otherwise.</p><hr><p>\u201CYes, but I have already finished my errand. Now I am just waiting for her to return.\u201D</p><p>\u201CIn a desolate spot like this? How about somewhere a little more lively?\u201D</p><p>\u201CLoitering at the range or another public place is bound to cause trouble for Sakura.\u201D</p><hr><p>I see, so that&#39;s why...</p><p>And still... Keeping her waiting in here just isn&#39;t right.</p><p>It would be great if Rider could come to the archery dojo too... Hmm, what&#39;s a good excuse to let an outsider stay at a dojo...?</p><hr><p>\u201CAh, that&#39;s right. Do you want give the bow a try as well, Rider?\u201D</p><p>\u201CMe? I am not very good with ranged weaponry...\u201D</p><hr><p>Because of her &quot;Rider&quot; class, I guess.</p><p>But since one Heroic Spirit may fall into many different classes, there are ones that possess multiple abilities as well.</p><p>I look her over from head to toe.</p><p>Given that she already has strength and experience with martial arts, I see no problem with having her start archery training.</p><hr><p>\u201C...You&#39;ve got the muscles, and I&#39;m sure Sakura would be glad to teach you. That way, there&#39;d be no problem being at the archery dojo either.\u201D</p><p>Rider has been teaching Sakura magic lately, but I&#39;m sure it&#39;d be nice to have the roles reversed once in a while. It&#39;d be a good incentive for Sakura too.</p><hr><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015Then would you teach me, Shirou?\u201D</p><p>\u201CHuh?\u201D</p><p>\u201CYou were tutoring Sakura, were you not?</p><p>Acquiring skills while training under an accomplished master is key to achievement.\u201D</p><p>\u201CU-Uh, I wouldn&#39;t really...\u201D</p><hr><p>Giving private lessons to Rider does sound attractive. And exactly because it is attractive, it would be problematic.</p><hr><p>\u201CLook, Sakura&#39;s the captain of the archery club, and she&#39;s pretty good at teaching. I may manage the bow and arrow part, but explaining it to someone else isn&#39;t\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><p>\u201CIs that so?</p><p>Indeed, your speech is rather sparse. However, is it not because of your guidance that Sakura now excels in cooking skill?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CI appreciate that, but... See, Sakura would be glad to see you start archery training, and it wouldn&#39;t be nice for me to butt in.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CI see... Then I will try asking Sakura for advice.</p><p>It is true that she was the one who suggested learning to be able to cook, but learning archery does, in fact, suit me.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CAh. Uh, there&#39;s no reason why you can&#39;t be studying both...\u201D</p><p>\u201CNo. I lack the ability to manage two things at the same time.</p><p>I will inform Sakura that you have kindly recommended archery rather than cooking, Shirou.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CUh...\u201D</p><p>...I may have literally stirred up a hornet&#39;s nest... Oh well, I&#39;ll have to think of a way to follow up on this later.</p><p>\u201CAlso, being at Homurabara isn&#39;t out of the question... as a transfer student, maybe?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C......No, that is not possible.</p><p>It may be possible for Saber, but a school uniform cannot possibly fit me.\u201D</p><p>It would sure be interesting to try, though... no, wait a moment.</p><p>That&#39;s not the only type of uniform we have at Homurabara.</p><hr><p>\u201CThat&#39;s right, Rider, you could be a school nurse.\u201D</p><p>\u201CPardon me?\u201D</p><p>\u201CThe person at the infirmary. A white robe would look good on you, right?\u201D</p><hr><p>So what would happen if Rider did become a nurse?</p><p>There&#39;d be a long queue at the infirmary, for one thing. A school nurse as beautiful as that will make all the male students quite excited, no doubt.</p><p>Rider in her tight-fitting body suit, with a white robe on top, sitting with her legs crossed.</p><p>Yep, that&#39;s perfection.</p><hr><p>\u201C...Shirou. I am afraid I do not have the qualifications for that.</p><p>In addition, I am incapable of instructing people. This role may be fundamentally unsuitable for me.\u201D</p><p>Says Rider, throwing a cold sidelong glance.</p><p>That&#39;s it. The embodiment of perfection itself.</p><p>Naturally predisposed to being a doctor, a title of a King, no, a Queen of Joy wouldn&#39;t be too farfetched.</p><hr><p>\u201C...Oh no, no. That&#39;s not it at all.</p><p>Rider. Even Fuji-Nee qualified for English teacher&#39;s position. And in your case, I think you&#39;d have much greater persuasive power as a nurse.\u201D</p><p>But they won&#39;t let you pass on just looks alone, sadly.</p><p>Rider at the school&#39;s infirmary. As good of an idea that was\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>\u201C...I guess that&#39;s a no-go, after all.\u201D</p><p>\u201CIndeed. While I worry about Sakura, watching her 24 hours a day would be a burden for both of us.</p><p>It would be better if she could leave the world of magic behind and be at ease while at school.\u201D</p><hr><p>Dry grass rustling beneath her footsteps, Rider starts walking. There is no point in continuing this conversation in these woods.</p><hr><p>\u201CThen I will be talking a walk. This &quot;infirmary&quot; you have told me about, Shirou, has piqued my interest.\u201D</p><p>\u201CYeah. Being a day off, I don&#39;t think there&#39;s anyone there, but should you be interested, I&#39;ll be happy to help.\u201D</p><p>\u201C......I shall think about it.</p><p>Until later, then. I will be waiting at the gate, so let us all go back together with Sakura.\u201D</p><hr><p>And with that, Rider leaves me behind.</p><p>...As for me, I could either go to the student council room or just stick around and kill some time\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><hr><h3 id="school\u30FBday-3-snake-princess-in-the-evening-sun" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#school\u30FBday-3-snake-princess-in-the-evening-sun" aria-hidden="true">#</a> School\u30FBDay 3 Snake princess in the evening sun</h3><hr><p>I promised Rider that the two of us and Sakura will go home together, didn&#39;t I?</p><p>\u201CNow then... I wonder if I&#39;m not going to be the last one.\u201D</p><hr><p>However, the only one waiting at the gate is Rider.</p><p>\u201CHuh? Rider, where&#39;s Sakura?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C...I have a message from her.\u201D</p><p>That can mean only one thing.</p><p>\u201CThe preparations for the archery club&#39;s next tournament are not yet complete.</p><p>She is very sorry, and requests that you go home ahead of her, Shirou.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CI see. Sakura&#39;s really got it tough with all the work she has to do as club captain.\u201D</p><p>\u201CThat is not the end of the message. May I continue?\u201D</p><p>Hm? There&#39;s more?</p><p>She probably wanted to tell me to buy milk and eggs on the way home, or that we&#39;re running out of tofu.</p><p>As I urge Rider to go on, she continues in a halfhearted tone.</p><hr><p>\u201CSince she would be late, she asks that you go home together with me.\u201D</p><p>\u201C...Is that okay?\u201D</p><p>It&#39;s Sakura who Rider ought to go home with, not me. It seems she understands that too, as she says her next words through gritted teeth.</p><hr><p>\u201CAlthough I said I could wait, Sakura did not listen. As she does not know how long it will take, she did not want to make you wait too long, and requested that I go back first.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C...Thus, please give up and let me accompany you on the way home.</p><p>I do not wish to be a cause of Sakura&#39;s worries.\u201D</p><p>\u201CI got it, I&#39;ll go with you. I&#39;ll come back and pick her up later.\u201D</p><p>\u201CPlease leave the night escort to me, Shirou.\u201D</p><hr><p>...Come to think of it, this has never happened before.</p><p>I&#39;ve walked down this sloping road with Sakura, Tohsaka, and Issei, but never with Rider.</p><p>But we&#39;re going home together today.</p><p>Of course it would feel like a new experience.</p><hr><p>...Also, it&#39;s great that today is a holiday.</p><p>If this were a regular school day, I&#39;d have to face the curiosity and criticism of my classmates after being seen walking home with such a beauty.</p><hr><p>\u201CIs being accompanied by me a bother to you, Shirou?\u201D</p><p>\u201CNo, it&#39;s just that this is the first time this has happened, and I&#39;m a bit bewildered.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CThen, does the fact that we left Sakura behind trouble you, Shirou?\u201D</p><p>\u201C...That&#39;s right. I was wondering if there was anything I could have helped her out with.</p><p>But Sakura&#39;s the archery club captain, and it isn&#39;t good for me to meddle in her business too much.\u201D</p><hr><p>It&#39;s been a while since I withdrew from the club.</p><p>To the first-years, even though I&#39;m an acquaintance of Sakura&#39;s, I&#39;m just an outsider.</p><p>I&#39;m a nobody compared to the former captain, Mitsuzuri... which reminds me of something, and I turn to Rider walking next to me.</p><hr><p>\u201CRider, how were you introduced to the archery club members?\u201D</p><p>\u201CAh... yes, as a friend of Sakura&#39;s family.\u201D</p><p>\u201CA relative from abroad or something?\u201D</p><p>\u201CWith Illyasviel and Saber already here as a precedent of sorts, nobody has ever made any further inquiries.\u201D</p><p>I guess they wouldn&#39;t.</p><p>If you think about it, it would seem like the archery club at Homurabara has a had a lot of unrelated foreign guests going in and out lately.</p><hr><p>Illya made quite an impact when she first showed up there... no wonder, for a silver-haired little girl who looks like a heroine from a picture book or a movie.</p><hr><p>\u201CIf there were any problems to speak of, it would be the way that Mitsuzuri Ayako behaves whenever I happen to be present. That is, she seems to be rather shy.</p><p>...Honestly. She acts almost the way a frog being stared down by a snake would. I would really like a chance to give her some training.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CNo... uh, it&#39;s not Mitsuzuri&#39;s fault...\u201D</p><p>In fact, Rider herself is the main cause there.</p><p>The memory of being attacked, then having her blood sucked out remained in her mind, but who did it is still not known.</p><p>So...</p><p>There&#39;s no doubt that Rider was the attacker.</p><p>\u201C...Isn&#39;t it exactly like a frog being stared down by a snake?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CSuch rudeness from you as well, Shirou? To swallow up one who interests you in one gulp would be extremely bad form.</p><p>Also, rather than a frog, Ayako is more like a mouse, or, no, a cute little fox cub.\u201D</p><p>\u201C...You&#39;re the one who mentioned the frog, you know.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CA figure of speech.</p><p>...Anyway, although there were a number of unfortunate incidents between us, I would like to reconcile with her one day.</p><p>I&#39;ll be counting on you when that time comes, Shirou.\u201D</p><p>\u201C...All right, I&#39;ll help out where I can. I can at least serve as a mediator for the two of you.\u201D</p><hr><p>We slowly make our way down the hill road, chatting idly all the while.</p><p>Going back quietly like this isn&#39;t bad at all.</p><hr><p>\u201CEven Rider...\u201D</p><p>\u201CIs something wrong, Shirou?\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015No, it&#39;s nothing.\u201D</p><p>When she turns back to me with that smile on her face, I go silent.</p><p>I&#39;d have no problem getting a conversation going with anyone else, but there&#39;s still a definite sense of formality between the two of us.</p><hr><p>Still, we did get to talk quite a lot today... her presence used to make me recall some rather frightening past incidents, but I&#39;m starting to trust Rider a lot more lately.</p><p>She&#39;s like an elder sister\u2015\u2015\u2015in a different sense of the word than Fuji-Nee. The contrast between trustworthiness and an aura of danger gives her a certain charm.</p><p>She can be quite frightening and difficult to approach at some times, yet also have a sense of familiarity at others.</p><p>Without saying a word, I simply gaze at the ribbon swaying in Rider&#39;s hair, until\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015we arrive home.</p><hr><p>\u201CI have escorted you home, Shirou, and my mission is now complete.\u201D</p><p>\u201CThanks, I appreciate it. I&#39;ll go on in and get dinner started before Sakura gets home.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CRider, what about you? Would you like some tea?\u201D</p><p>\u201CNo, I must go back to pick up Sakura soon.</p><p>I shall be going then, Shirou.\u201D</p><p>Rider&#39;s gallant loyalty to Sakura remains unchanged.</p><p>It gets dark out so quickly in autumn, and it&#39;s reassuring to know that Sakura will have Rider to see her home.</p><hr><p>\u201CI see. In that case, let her know that I&#39;ll take care of dinner tonight.\u201D</p><p>\u201CUnderstood. Then\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><p>\u201CWelcome back, Shirou.
