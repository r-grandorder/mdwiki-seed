What were you doing at the harbor?\u201D</p><p>Something doesn&#39;t feel right.</p><p>Seeing her face from dawn to dusk, then bumping into her at a place like this just seems rather unusual.</p><hr><p>\u201CHmm, skipping school just to wander around here is no good, Shirou!\u201D</p><p>\u201CSpeaking of which, aren&#39;t you supposed...\u201D</p><p>\u201CWell, guess I&#39;ll have to let it slide for today... it&#39;s right before the long weekend, after all.\u201D</p><hr><p>I thought she&#39;d drag me to school by the ear, but it looks like she&#39;s in a good mood today. Safe for now.</p><p>...No, wait. Even in a good mood, it&#39;s not like Fuji-Nee to forgive skipping school. Rather, she probably isn&#39;t feeling that well.</p><hr><p>\u201C...You don&#39;t seem to be in character...\u201D</p><p>\u201CYou think so?\u201D</p><p>\u201CWell, you know, the usual Fuji-Nee is, like...\u201D</p><p>Stepping onto the pier, I strike a dramatic pose.</p><p>Something sailor-like, with a pipe in his teeth - a grizzled seawolf, or the guy in the <ruby>Wataridori<rt>Rambler</rt></ruby> series.</p><hr><p>\u201CI am a woman of the sea, fall in love with a bird of passage and you&#39;ll be burned\u2015\u2015\u2015stuff like that.\u201D</p><p>\u201CAhaha, it&#39;s amusing, but I suppose it does fit.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C...I don&#39;t know, but now this feels even more strange.\u201D</p><p>It&#39;s just a brief image; it&#39;d be odd to see actual sailors at this harbor, after all.</p><p>But then, with Fuji-Nee here, that wouldn&#39;t look particularly out of place.</p><hr><p>\u201CSo, are striped shirts and sailor&#39;s trousers still around nowadays?\u201D</p><p>\u201CHm, a sailor uniform might even look kinda good on me, yeah?\u201D</p><p>\u201CIt was like that back in the day... ah, pardon me for not bringing a set.\u201D</p><hr><p>The image of someone over 20 in a sailor uniform is a bit severe.</p><p>At this port, a real sailor&#39;s uniform might actually look good on Fuji-Nee, though.</p><hr><p>\u201CSpeaking of the sea... I went chasing after Kiritsugu-san around the time I was still wearing one, too.\u201D</p><p>Gazing at the distant sea, she mutters something longingly.</p><hr><p>He went overseas on a freighter that he boarded at this harbor. I wonder what Kiritsugu was thinking.</p><p>When I told him to go by plane, he said, &quot;No, no, Shirou, hiding among cargo on a boat is what makes the trip such a novel adventure, don&#39;t you think?&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>\u201CYeah, it&#39;s a good thing you didn&#39;t follow him, I think.\u201D</p><p>\u201CIndeed. And I had no passport, I&#39;d have been sent right back home, anyway.\u201D</p><p>\u201C..................\u201D</p><hr><p>Would she have followed him if she had one?</p><p>And not just the passport, she&#39;d need a visa and all that, too. Even then, I still wouldn&#39;t recommend being Kiritsugu&#39;s companion on one of his reckless adventures.</p><p>Fuji-Nee is a girl, after all.</p><hr><p>\u201CWhen Kiritsugu was about to leave, I chased him all the way to here, but I couldn&#39;t ask him to take me along...\u201D</p><p>\u201C...So that&#39;s how it was.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CHis parting words were &quot;Take care of Shirou!&quot;, and nothing else.</p><p>Maybe I should have done the impossible and paid him a visit, just to see what he was up to while abroad.\u201D</p><hr><p>She laughs weakly.</p><p>Even through my own perspective, it&#39;s not as though I could tell what he had been doing overseas.</p><p>He&#39;d just come back with all kinds of nonsense stories that I looked forward to. Neither of us knew when he would come back, so we waited for him together.</p><hr><p>\u201CMaybe I should have gone, too...\u201D</p><p>\u201CYeah, surely it wouldn&#39;t have killed him to bring us along, for once.\u201D</p><p>\u201CYou&#39;ve no idea where the old man could have been going, though.</p><p>A place like Europe would be fine, but what if it&#39;s, say, somewhere in the middle of Africa, solving an ancient mystery left behind by an alien race?\u201D</p><hr><p>...Wouldn&#39;t be quite that absurd, but there&#39;s a good chance it wasn&#39;t that far off.</p><p>Andes, Amazon, Kiritsugu went everywhere.</p><p>Some of the odd souvenirs that he brought back looked as if a trapped spirit was about to emerge from them.</p><hr><p>\u201CAfrica? Hey, they have tigers there, don&#39;t they?\u201D</p><p>\u201CI have a feeling they don&#39;t. And if they do, I doubt having one jump out in front of you is a good time to take a picture.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CIt&#39;s okay, Big Sis will take care of a tiger in one blow... Or will she...? A 3rd dan in kendo on one side, but a wild animal on the other is almost like a gun... Hmmm...\u201D</p><hr><p>Who do you think you are, <ruby>Katou Kiyomasa<rt>Toranosuke</rt></ruby>? To fight a tiger on equal terms, you&#39;d have to be at least on Saber&#39;s level.</p><p>Fuji-Nee&#39;s already started sparring with an imaginary tiger. Looks like she does think her odds of defeating a tiger are high enough already.</p><hr><p>\u201C...This is hard. If only I had a fine ancient sword...\u201D</p><p>\u201CAh, don&#39;t you dare bring up the old man&#39;s collection over this. Besides, Kiritsugu is\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><hr><p>A magus, so Fuji-Nee&#39;s a warrior?</p><p>...Perhaps it&#39;s the dock&#39;s atmosphere that caused memories of dad to resurface eventually.</p><p>Perhaps Fuji-Nee got a little nostalgic, too\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>\u201C...But Kiritsugu... Oh well, let&#39;s stop there.\u201D</p><p>\u201CYeah, we should.</p><p>Say, how about we go overseas sometime together instead, Fuji-Nee?\u201D</p><p>Oops.</p><p>I think I just said something stupid.</p><hr><p>\u201CNope! I&#39;ll be the one to take you abroad instead. You&#39;ll have a trip after graduation, right?\u201D</p><p>\u201CUgh, travel in the company of a teacher right after graduation... I think I&#39;ll pass\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><p>\u201COh you, don&#39;t be shy, Shirou!\u201D</p><p>\u201CD-Don&#39;t be ridiculous, it&#39;s nothing to do with being shy! Totally inappropriate, that&#39;s what it is!\u201D</p><hr><h2 id="day-3" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#day-3" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Day 3</h2><h3 id="ryuudou-temple\u30FBday-3-adventures-of-himuro-kane" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#ryuudou-temple\u30FBday-3-adventures-of-himuro-kane" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Ryuudou Temple\u30FBDay 3 Adventures of Himuro Kane</h3><hr><p>The gate at the top of Ryuudou Temple&#39;s long, long stairs.</p><p>The gatekeeper here, a swordsman from another time, Assassin Kojiro, does not reveal himself.</p><p>Instead, the one watching the gate is\u2015\u2015\u2015known as &quot;Madame&quot; among friends, a cool-eyed girl.</p><hr><p>\u201C...Not yet here, as I thought.\u201D</p><p>\u201CYou mean... Issei?\u201D</p><p>Although it just doesn&#39;t seem likely that she would have anything other than student council matters with Issei.</p><hr><p>\u201CAh, it&#39;s you, Emiya. So you&#39;re a close friend of the Son of the Temple.\u201D</p><p>\u201CAn undesirable yet inseparable relationship, I guess... Do temples interest you as well, Himuro?\u201D</p><p>Something on the temple gate she was watching must have piqued her interest.</p><p>Perhaps that Aun statue is the work of the famous Buddhist image maker of the Kamakura period... is that what she&#39;s thinking?</p><hr><p>\u201CYukika did say that she saw him.\u201D</p><p>\u201CSaw?\u201D</p><p>\u201CA person that looked like a samurai\u2015\u2015\u2015Makidera thought it was a ghost and got scared. Something odd.\u201D</p><p>...That would be Kojiro.</p><p>It&#39;s not like I could tell her, but her guess isn&#39;t that far off.</p><p>But why would Saegusa be able to see him...?</p><hr><p>\u201CHowever, I can&#39;t imagine a ghost inhabiting a temple gate. But if there is one, wouldn&#39;t that mean this temple has a serious lack of virtue?\u201D</p><p>\u201CIt would mean it&#39;s not their specialty. That prayers and exorcism are their weak points.\u201D</p><p>\u201CDon&#39;t know about sects, but had there been a monk of high virtue, he&#39;d clean up any mischievous apparitions in no time.\u201D</p><p>\u201CShouldn&#39;t ghosts be only visible at night, though?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CIt&#39;s the opposite. You can easily mistake some other illusion for a ghost when it&#39;s dark out.</p><p>Whereas in broad daylight, you&#39;d easily see what might have confused you at night\u2015\u2015\u2015a ghost might end up being just some withered pampas grass.\u201D</p><p>I see, that&#39;s the voice of reason.</p><p>Unfortunately for an intellectual like Himuro, there is indeed a ghost here.</p><p>Himuro is looking around the temple gate once again\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>\u201CExcept, there wasn&#39;t anything to mistake for it. A puzzle, indeed.\u201D</p><p>Thus, being unable to find a logical explanation for this phenomenon bothers her.</p><hr><p>\u201CMaybe there is one, after all. Legends of desperate defeated soldiers fleeing to the temple and whatnot.\u201D</p><p>\u201CAre you the kind of guy that believes in those things, Emiya\u2015\u2015\u2015?\u201D</p><p>\u201CYou can&#39;t really prove they don&#39;t exist, either.\u201D</p><p>Illya or Tohsaka could probably give you a ton of model evidence that they do, in fact.</p><p>I get a feeling that she would try to bring all magic under one grand unified Himuro theory.</p><hr><p>\u201CYou probably think they don&#39;t. I guess you&#39;re an atheist, or rather, a materialist?\u201D</p><p>\u201CThat&#39;s mean. I just need the reason why they would exist\u2015\u2015\u2015saying it&#39;s the gods&#39; will isn&#39;t good enough.\u201D</p><hr><p>I listen to her in amazement.</p><p>As if being lectured by a chemistry or physics teacher, my head drops.</p><p>No man should be able to match wits with her.</p><p>Well, we do have pretty deep conversations sometimes.</p><hr><p>\u201CAssuming that it does exist, someone from local history or Ryuudou Temple&#39;s death registry would be my first guess.\u201D</p><p>\u201CSo if you find a matching historical figure, that would be it?\u201D</p><p>\u201CIt would certainly make me feel a bit better if I did.\u201D</p><p>I see\u2015\u2015\u2015it&#39;s the lack of certainty that makes her anxious.</p><hr><p>\u201CAs Yukika said, it&#39;s a mystery, after all. Disappointing.\u201D</p><p>Saegusa&#39;s report isn&#39;t one she can just dismiss, it seems.</p><p>But what will Himuro do if Makidera starts acting up?</p><hr><p>\u201CSay you do discover a ghost. What then?\u201D</p><p>\u201C...Haven&#39;t thought that far yet.\u201D</p><p>...Presume that you&#39;re about to meet an unknown something that may or may not exist - is that too tall of an order?</p><p>Himuro appears to be considering her options.</p><hr><p>\u201CNo, it&#39;d be worrisome but not a problem.</p><p>That&#39;s when we turn it over to the specialists.\u201D</p><p>\u201CLike Tohsaka?\u201D</p><p>\u201CWhat are you saying? There are experts right over here\u2015\u2015\u2015should a ghost appear out of nowhere, they&#39;ll figure it out.\u201D</p><hr><p>I see, so that&#39;s how.</p><p>Did no one tell her that there&#39;s nothing resembling the &quot;power of Buddha&quot; kind of abilities at Ryuudou household? Tohsaka&#39;s talent runs in the family, at least.</p><hr><p>\u201CAlright, I&#39;ll go look around the temple grounds. If I see the Son of the Temple or someone, I&#39;ll be sure to make them talk.\u201D</p><p>\u201CI don&#39;t think Issei knows about the ghost, though.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CCan&#39;t see the forest for the trees, perhaps. If that&#39;s the case, I might as well just quietly have a prayer while I&#39;m here.\u201D</p><p>\u201CLike, for academic success and stuff?\u201D</p><p>Someone as determined as Himuro got to wish for something to that effect.</p><p>However, turning around suddenly\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015For true love.\u201D</p><p>\u201CHuh?\u201D</p><p>Words I couldn&#39;t imagine hearing came out.</p><p>Love? Himuro? I mean, who?</p><hr><p>\u201CYou seem to be surprised again, Emiya.</p><p>Does the fact that I desire a good match offend you?\u201D</p><p>\u201CWell, of course not, but...\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CThat time in the park, when I spoke about a love affair, you seemed to have thought it strange, too. What do you really think?\u201D</p><p>It&#39;s just that it was completely out of the blue.</p><p>I mean, much like the one now.</p><hr><p>\u201C...I don&#39;t want you to take it the wrong way, but asked like this, it&#39;s not like I&#39;m interested in you.\u201D</p><p>\u201CIt&#39;s alright. Essentially, I have neither charm nor sex appeal, I get it.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CYou got it all wrong.</p><p>Oh well. Ghosts, love, same thing. Unexplored, unseen things are what captivates me.</p><p>Because both are picture perfect.\u201D</p><p>\u201C?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CDo not ask.</p><p>Even if I do wish for true love at this temple, it&#39;s for the good of the sweethearts I&#39;m watching over\u2015\u2015\u2015I have not yet thought about my own love.
