Sorry for the short notice, but we have a problem. I&#39;ve just detected the development of a peculiar Singularity.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Thought so. Where is it?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Well, about that...<br> It&#39;s in Japan.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Really... Again?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Yes, again. What&#39;s more, it&#39;s not that far off in time from when you were in Kyoto.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Normally, this era of Japan would have nothing to do with the Foundation of Humanity\u2013</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> However, if left alone, this abnormality could contradict that.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> We&#39;ve encountered unusual circumstances before, but this one takes the cake.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I can&#39;t even predict what kind of situation awaits you at your Rayshift destination.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> All I can do is prepare for whatever you encounter.<br> Will you still go, Fujimaru?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Of course.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> You can count on me!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Excellent! That&#39;s very reassuring. At this rate, I can&#39;t really call you a rookie Master anymore.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Foou... Foooou!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Fou will be coming with us too?<br> That would be great!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Haha, according to Mash, Chaldea&#39;s very own lucky animal.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Only Mash really knew Fou before Fujimaru arrived, huh? Even named him. I guess he&#39;s an essential member of the team now.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> All right, Fou, please take care of these two.<br> I&#39;ll give my best to support you guys from here as well.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou, foou!</p><h2 id="act-1-three-animal-companions" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#act-1-three-animal-companions" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Act 1: &quot;Three Animal? Companions&quot;</h2><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Imaginary existence defined.<br> Rayshift completed.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Where are we?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Oh! I&#39;m getting a clear visual from you.<br> That&#39;s great!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I have confirmed the coordinates as well.<br> You&#39;re located on an island near Honshu.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Remember when you Rayshifted to Kyoto before?<br> It&#39;s that island you could just barely see then.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I see. So it&#39;s from that time...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> What&#39;s the situation in the surrounding area?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The situation? Let me see.<br> From an overall view of the island...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Mash?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...It&#39;s nothing. You see...<br> My frame of reference may not be accurate.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Since we&#39;ve brought someone more knowledgeable about Japan this time, I want to ask her opinion.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Heh heh heh. If our battlefield is the Land of the Rising Sun, then it is only natural for me to lead the charge.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> I am unaccustomed to killing monsters, but there is no finer warrior across the Land of the Rising Sun than I!</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> I will leap even when there are no ships! Your humble Servant, Ushiwakamaru, has hastened here knowing my Master&#39;s in danger!</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Well, the truth is Fou led me me here, but that&#39;s another story. I really wanted that sweet red bean jelly.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> (Ohh, so that&#39;s why there was some jelly in the Coffin...)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I appreciate your support, Ushiwakamaru. It&#39;s very reassuring having you here. It makes sense too, settings-wise.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Of course. I believe so as well.<br> I have a feeling that I will play a great role this time!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fo\u2014u!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes. Now then, Ushiwakamaru, does anything on this island look unusual to you?</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Anything unusual?<br> Let me see...</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> !!!</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> I can&#39;t believe this... quite mystifying.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> The shape...of this island.<br> Can this be the rumored...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...I knew it. There is something wrong here.<br> The shape of this island is inconceivable.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It is just like an illustration from a children&#39;s book.<br> So simple... it is like that island\u2013</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Wait, a reading I&#39;ve never seen before is approaching your location! What&#39;s this... I can&#39;t even tell its shape!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> It&#39;s like an illustration of birds and beasts dancing, frolicking, and playing sumo...</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Ooooo... Ooooohhhhhhhh!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou!?</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> How utterly strange!<br> It&#39;s like the oni in paintings, my lord!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> They&#39;re attacking!<br> We have no choice but to treat them as an enemy.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Orders, please, Master!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Ugh, how disappointing.<br> Oni or not, their heads roll all the same.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fo\u2013u...</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> However, the fact remains that they were extraordinary opponents.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Oni are far stronger than humans and are driven by stronger desires. You can call them the manifestation of evil.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Fortunately their numbers are few.<br> However, the problem is\u2013</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Yes. It has become more apparent that there is definitely something wrong with this island.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It looks like it came straight out of a fairy tale.<br> On top of that, menacing oni actually live on it.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Based on this information, this place must be\u2013</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Can it be... Onigashima?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I knew it... Onigashima?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes. It only makes sense to assume so.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> No wonder the data on this island doesn&#39;t match that of the previous Singularities. I know it&#39;s unbelievable, but it seems we&#39;re in the world of fairy tales.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Oni-type Servants aside, the fact that there are plain and simple oni living on this island is all the evidence we need.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> It goes without saying, but there is no record of this island in the seas around Japan.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I can&#39;t even pinpoint the temporal coordinates of that island. Well, something similar happened last time in Heian-period Kyoto...</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Foufou.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> That&#39;s correct. Even I am not aware of this island.<br> It probably did not exist during my brother&#39;s lifetime.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> ...What a waste. If islands this interesting truly existed,<br> I am certain I could have pleased my brother this time around...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Hmmm. Something that shouldn&#39;t exist is there.<br> A fantasy that&#39;s never meant to be is manifesting.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> That island is also part of the abnormality.<br> In other words, there&#39;s a possibility it was created.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> An island of this size?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> It is not impossible. In Japanese mythology, the islands that make up Japan were created by the gods.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Have you heard the tale of Amenonuboko? The gods formed the island and created the nation with their Authority.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Anyway, I can tell you about that later.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Even though that island was mentioned in human history, it didn&#39;t actually exist in history.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> So someone made fairy tales, fantasy, into reality?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Yes. That also means whoever made that island must be quite powerful.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Building an island that never existed before...<br> That most certainly is not something a human could do.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> It would be difficult for my brother as well. Politically. Which means... Yes, our enemy is clear.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Both oni and the island Onigashima...<br> Yes, I would agree the answer is clear.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> But it is still too soon to draw any conclusions.<br> I want you to investigate with extreme caution.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Okay.<br> Let us proceed with care, Master.</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> The Singularity response I&#39;m picking up is located at the highest, most remote part of the island.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> From what I can see, it looks like a steep, rocky mountain is the highest point of the island.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It looks like it won&#39;t be easy to reach from here.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Even the longest journey begins with a single step!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes. You&#39;re right, Senpai.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> We should progress steadily, one step at a time\u2013<br> Like the journey we&#39;ve been on so far.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Let&#39;s see how far we can get.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Hehe... That&#39;s right. Senpai, you always inspire us to go down the right path with your words.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That may indeed prove to be the shortest way to reach our goal.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou, foou\u266A</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> By the way, Ushiwaka.<br> Are you familiar with folklore?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Not just tales from your time, but those popular after that as well.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Yes. You need not worry about that. I, Ushiwaka, have been diligently studying such things in Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Naturally, the tale of Onigashima, as well as Kobutori Jisan, Shita-kiri Suzume, The Crab and the Monkey, the Thief Ninja Jiraiya,</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> and many others. I love them! So speaking of Onigashima, the tale of Momotarou is definitely what comes to mind.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Exchanging millet dumplings to gain three companions: a dog, a monkey, and a pheasant, and then defeating the oni of Onigashima\u2014</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Heh heh! Master, if you are Momotarou, then I must be the dog, eh?</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> I myself am a dog person, so all the better. A cat ignores commands, but a dog is devoted to its master.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> If you order me to, I will gladly line the island shore with the heads of all the oni.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...Ushiwaka, it definitely doesn&#39;t sound like a joke when you say it... Besides, you ARE a master of combat...</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou! Foufou!</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> What? You would like to play the dog as well, Fou!? Well, for certain... You do have the qualifications...</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> But I shall not be outdone! Whichever of us can perform most like a dog shall be the winner! Let&#39;s go!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Oh... Ushiwakamaru and Fou have gone running off.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Oh, well. We&#39;ll just have to leave the scouting up to those two.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Uh!? It seems Ushiwakamaru has found something.<br> She&#39;s rushing back in a hurry... What&#39;s the matter?</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> My lord! I have news!<br> There is someone lying unconscious over there!</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> This... This is a Servant response.<br> He&#39;s a Servant! And\u2013</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Oni! The person on the ground is surrounded by oni!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Let&#39;s rescue them, Mash!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Defeat the oni!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes. Master, orders, please!</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> My lord, I shall obey your orders to the very fullest! Come, demons! Quench my Usumidori&#39;s thirst!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Ugh! There are so many!</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Ohhh...</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> My lord! This one on the floor has regained consciousness.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Who...are...you?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Let&#39;s talk later!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> We are Momotarou and friends!</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> ???</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> ...I don&#39;t understand, but...<br> I do know...that you&#39;re fighting the oni.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> All...to save...me.<br> In that case...</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> ...Even though I&#39;m physically and mentally exhausted... Even though I&#39;m weak...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> One of the oni just went down!<br> What happened!?</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> A knife! Nay, a ninja kunai! What a swift, clean throw... Who are you?</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> ...Apologies. Although I&#39;m not anyone of note...</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> ...My name is Fuuma Kotarou. For some reason that is beyond me, I am the fifth Kotarou.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Fuuma Kotarou!? The leader of the Fuuma ninja and disruption brigade of Soshu province that served under the Hojo clan?</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> ...Yes, that one. I really don&#39;t want to get boiled in a pot. However, for now\u2014</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> I will repay your help and do what is right. Do not expect much of me, but I will begin exterminating the oni.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> You are a young man oddly lacking in spirit, but that is unimportant! Continue, I will leave any backup to you!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> Here we go...!</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Ooh! Another kunai between the eyes!<br> Now that&#39;s flawless accuracy! Well done, Kotarou!</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> Oh... Thank you. You look awfully cold, but your agility is unparalleled.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Hahaha! To think you&#39;d worry about me on the battlefield! Continue to watch my back, Kotarou!</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Those quick and daring movements... So that&#39;s a ninja!<br> I have only ever heard of them before.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> I too have learned similar arts from the Tengu, but I can tell the real deal is different.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> I wonder if my brother would be happy if I mastered such skills? ...After this, please train me!</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> No, I cannot... I&#39;m no good at teaching people...<br> Um, and you are?</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Oh, I beg your pardon.<br> My name is Ushiwakamaru.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> Ushiwaka... Ohh, samurai of the Minamoto clan. I don&#39;t really like samurai...but... you&#39;re a comrade. And if it&#39;s Minamoto... things are different.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> We can speak later!<br> The third enemy wave is approaching!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Damn, there are too many! They&#39;re like a swarm of mosquitoes! They just keep popping up one after the other!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> We&#39;re completely surrounded!</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> It seems that all the oni in the area have gathered here... Sorry. I should have been more cautious.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> That doesn&#39;t matter anymore.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Just as Master says. We should only focus on fighting our way out of this!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> No, it is my fault as well.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes. If we had known so many would come, we could have handled it differently...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> If only we&#39;d made withdrawing our priority from the start. But, well... Would&#39;ve, could&#39;ve, should&#39;ve...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> We just have to watch for our chance now!<br> Fujimaru, give them orders!</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Haaa!</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> ...It&#39;s a problem that there is no enemy general either. One sure way to victory is to take out the leader first.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> My lord, if you command it, I, Ushiwakamaru, am willing to face ten thousand foes to take an enemy general&#39;s head\u2013</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> ...But if there&#39;s no general to begin with, there&#39;s nothing that can be done. The problem is simply numbers now.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Is there any way to stop them?</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> ...There&#39;s no point in keeping this a secret any longer considering the situation...</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> Ushiwaka, girl in the dark armor...<br> and you, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> I am a lone Servant whose fate has called me to this place.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> I am still neither your ally nor your enemy.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> As such, I have hesitated to show you my trump card... my Noble Phantasm.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> But you have, in truth, concerned yourselves over me, a novice. Therefore\u2014</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> I, Fuuma Kotarou, shall live up to my duty, and loyally honor your sincerity.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> This is not our sacred Mt. Ashigara, and none of my invisible and swift disruption brigade are present.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> I, Kotarou, will entrust you with our secret...<br> Not as the leader of the Fuuma clan, but as a friend.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Uh, which means...?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Senpai, this is a serious situation!<br> The poor lonely fellow is plucking up his courage for us!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Wow! You really can speak properly!</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> My lord! This is serious!<br> It&#39;s an important moment for Kotarou!</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> ...Um, may I continue?</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> ...Then, once again...</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> Master. My Noble Phantasm has the ability to summon the Fuuma clan...my followers&#39; spirits into battle. Their numbers alone won&#39;t be outdone by these oni.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> Although it won&#39;t annihilate them, it will create a diversion.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> Understand that this could be the chance to turn the tables on them. Upon your signal, I will release my Noble Phantasm.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> I see. So you will distract them.<br> However...even if there is that chance...</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> We need a burst of heavy firepower to cut through the enemy ranks. My Noble Phantasm is Anti-Personnel, and Mash&#39;s is for protection...</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Kotarou, it pains me to say this, but we don&#39;t have the strength to overcome the situation\u2014</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Huh!?<br> What&#39;s that sound\u2014!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> S-Something is approaching!<br> With immense intensity, too!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It&#39;s coming from...the top of that cliff!</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> That&#39;s...</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> That&#39;s...!?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> He jumped...right off...the top of that cliff!?</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou!</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Hey there! I came here to see what&#39;s stinkin&#39; up the place and what do I find?</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> It&#39;s a golden party, guys!<br> Don&#39;t you agree, Boss!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> You&#39;re\u2014Kintoki the Axe Bearer!<br> No, I mean, Mr. Golden!</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> What? Kintarou?<br> Where is he, Mash?</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> The only thing I see is a disgusting creature who&#39;s trying too hard to look like a foreigner...</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> What!?<br> That&#39;s...Sakata...Kintoki?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes. You may find it hard to believe,<br> but that there is Mr. Golden.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> We were shocked by him at first too!<br> Oh, but... today he&#39;s worse than usual...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Th-That&#39;s right. What the heck is that metal, shiny, motorcycle-like thing!?</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> ...Tch! Can&#39;t you hear that? Listen! Listen to it!<br> You know you can hear it! Listen to this bad boy!</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Come on! Clean out your ears and listen to this!<br> This here is my one and only partner!</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> The awesome acceleration blasts it across a hundred miles in an instant! This jet engine would blow away a hundred bears if they stood in your way!</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> This is\u2014 This is truly goooooooolden!<br> This baby here is the legendary bear on Mt. Ashigara!</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> This is the Hyper Ultra Dangerous Machine\u2013<br> Golden Bear!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Th-That&#39;s... SO COOOOL!</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Heh heh! I knew you&#39;d get it, Boss!<br> This Bear here is one hellavuh beast, isn&#39;t he!?</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Foufou!</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Hey, pup! You get it too, huh? You show promise!<br> How about I dye your fur gold, huh?</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> ...Foun...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Dang... You guys... Yeah, I know, I know...</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Everyone is the same at first... This baby is so impressive that you can hardly breathe, let alone speak...</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> That&#39;s what makes Bear here so awesome...<br> He even frightens me deep down...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> You really are an idiot, aren&#39;t you?<br> Enough of that, Kintoki!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Would you take a look around!? Quit acting like some high-school kid who just got their drivers license!</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Hey! I&#39;m an adult, man!<br> I&#39;ve got my license for large motorbikes!</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> ...Wait, that&#39;s not the point.<br> Okay, fine! Say no more, Mad Doc!</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> I heard about everything at the mountain pass teahouse!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> What? Mad Doc?<br> Me?</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Hey, what the hell are those oni over there!?<br> Is that some kind of joke? Some face they got there!</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> I&#39;m an expert in killing oni, ya know! But even I never saw anything with such a cartoonish, dopey face!</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Dang! I don&#39;t know why, but that is hilarious!<br> This is so funny, I&#39;m dying of laughter! Gyahahahaha!</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> Is that... really... Sakata...Kintoki!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Stop! Stop, Mr. Golden!<br> This is no time to be laughing your head off!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Only the bad guys do that kind of stuff!<br> You&#39;ll disappoint the children!</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> What? Really?<br> The last thing I want to do is disappoint the kids...</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> ...Ah, well, gee. Sorry.<br> I wonder what got into me...</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> For some reason, I couldn&#39;t help laughing when I saw those guys. I must have seen them somewhere before...</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Ya know... It&#39;s like one of those strange memories from childhood that hits you right in the funny bone.</p><p><strong>Oni:</strong><br> Gahr... Gaaaaaaahhrrr... Gyaaaaaaaaarrrrrr!</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Oh, I guess this is no time for me to be laughing.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> As usual, I have no idea why I was summoned, but it&#39;s obvious what I have to do.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> I&#39;m needed at this instant!<br> That&#39;s what my Rider Suit is telling me!</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> It&#39;s saying, \u201CYou must ride faster than the wind, Golden!\u201D</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Then the only thing left to do is to exterminate those oni! Right, Boss? Right, missy with the shield!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes! Kintarou the Axe Bearer\u2014<br> You&#39;re needed front and center, Mister!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Okay! We&#39;ll break through with that golden Noble Phantasm!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes. Let&#39;s go, Master!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> It&#39;s a golden attaaaack!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> M-Master?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I&#39;m a little surprised by your unusually high spirit...<br> In any case!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Kotarou, please!</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> Oh... Right!</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> My immortal shinobi, I shall prep you here once more\u2013<br> Go! Immortal Chaos Brigade!</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Hey! Hey! What the heck is that, you...</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> Oh... I&#39;m sorry.<br> Have I...done anything to offend you?</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> That&#39;s one hellavuh cool name for a Noble Phantasm!</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> You&#39;ve got damn good taste, dude! Just stick a \u201CGolden\u201D in there, and it&#39;ll be perfect!</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> R-Right... Thanks...</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Hah! But I won&#39;t be bested\u2013<br> I&#39;m blowing these guys away!</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Come on, you stinking oni!<br> Imma send you back to hell!</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Quick as lightning, faster than a bullet, with a body as bright as gold! My sacred steed, Bear!</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Anyone who can keep up, follow me!<br> Ride behind if you&#39;d like!</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> But make sure you&#39;re insured if you do!</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Because I ain&#39;t got no brakes! If you get thrown off, you&#39;ll end up in the depths of hell!</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> !!!</p><h2 id="act-2-attack-on-onigashima" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#act-2-attack-on-onigashima" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Act 2: &quot;Attack on Onigashima&quot;</h2><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Now that we&#39;ve come this far, we should be all right.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Whew... Somehow we made it.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Let me express our gratitude again, Kotarou, Kintoki.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> ...No. I...should be the one thanking you.<br> I was the reason we got into that mess to begin with...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Hmm. Now that we have the opportunity, let me ask you. Why were you surrounded by them back there?</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> I was...summoned to this island not long ago.<br> I don&#39;t know the reason...but I can speculate.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> \u2013It&#39;s the oni. It&#39;s because I...am a Heroic Spirit deeply connected with oni.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> What do you mean by that?</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> A secret technique of the Fuuma... is to turn into an oni. That is why... there are tales of me... as an oni.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> You can...turn into an oni?</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> ...Not as of this moment.<br> That Noble Phantasm is sealed.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> However... There were oni right in front of my eyes.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> I thought if I could observe them, study them up close, I might be able to absorb their behaviors and unleash my Noble Phantasm...</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> Now I know it was a mistake. One group of oni called in another, and that turned into a chain reaction\u2013</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> And things ended up like that.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> I haven&#39;t even fully grasped the layout of the island yet...</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> It was a reckless move for me to make... Usually someone else would do the scouting for me...</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> So I&#39;m not used to doing it myself...<br> I feel so embarrassed right now...</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Come on! Don&#39;t worry about it, kid! What happens in Onigashima stays in Onigashima, right!?</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> So what if you lost your way?<br> Speaking of which, I got lost too!</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Anyway, I&#39;ve got to see some more of those fancy ninja moves you have. You&#39;re as fantastic as you look!</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> Oh...um, I&#39;m honored...to hear you say that, Kintoki.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> (He&#39;s becoming even more embarrassed...)</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> That&#39;s right, thank you Kintoki.<br> You really saved us out there.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Nah, I didn&#39;t do anything for you to thank me, Doc.<br> I just enjoyed blowing them away with my ride.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> ...But ya know. Like that time at Rashomon, things might be complicated here.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...You&#39;re right.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> We&#39;re out of trouble for the time being, but we&#39;re simply back to where we started.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> What is with this Onigashima? What is up with the oni? The mystery still remains.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Precisely. Kintoki, Kotarou. Our purpose here is to solve the mystery behind this island.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I realize I&#39;m asking you this again, but will you help us?</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> Yes. I am indebted to you. I shall help you.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> ...Besides, I think fighting the oni will help me further develop the secret arts of the Fuuma clan.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> The same with me. This sounds sappy, but companions make journeys, and kindness makes the world better.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> You&#39;re already my comrades and riding buddies. Once your butt is on my machine, we go all the way together.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> But just like I said with those oni\u2013 I&#39;m not responsible for what happens to you if you fall off!</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Besides, I can&#39;t just ignore the evil these oni are up to. Ya know, I got a reputation to keep.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> As Kintarou, if I don&#39;t hunt oni, then what am I doing here? Well, I guess I could ride my bike!</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> ...I&#39;m sensing a very passionate gaze. Who is it?</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Here, it&#39;s me! Please forgive me! I am deeply moved seeing how the great Sakata Kintoki is standing right in front of me!</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> What? You know me?</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Yes, of course. You are one of my ancestor&#39;s... Minamoto-no-Raikou&#39;s Four Heavenly Kings! The brave exploits of Kintoki are renowned!</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> There is nothing more heroic than the tales that were made by Kintarou of Mt. Ashigara!</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> I read all of your stories back in Chaldea!</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> (Kotarou is also nodding silently.)</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> (...Actually, I was shocked by the foreign-looking blond hair... But it must be some madness.)</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> (I&#39;m sure it&#39;s... you know, like teenage rebellion against his mother or something like that.)</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Ehh...well, all I did was go wild with my boss...</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> You lookin&#39; at me like that is kinda embarrassing. But if my old boss is your ancestor, then you&#39;re a Minamoto too?</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Yes! My father is Yoshitomo, my mother is Tokiwa, and of course, my older brother is Yoritomo. I am Ushiwakamaru!</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Heh-heh! I see, I see... Hold on! Hey!<br> Don&#39;t get so close! Quit your jumping up and down too!</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Oh! I&#39;m terribly sorry. I&#39;m just so excited!</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> (Her armor is way too flashy!<br> Is that because she&#39;s a Rider!? Is that why!?)</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> (Is this the default style for later Minamoto generations? I can practically see everything! And on her hips... Those are her panties!)</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> (Dang! Talk about an aggressive outfit... the Minamoto armor is great, dangerous, and revolutionary!)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Kintoki started blushing and turned away.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> His hair is different and he&#39;s riding a motorcycle, but he&#39;s not any different than the usual Kintoki.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Most of all, he&#39;s still a companion that we can rely on. Anyway, I&#39;d like you to start by gathering information\u2013</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> ...Wait, something is coming!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Yes! Oni are approaching! But there aren&#39;t that many... Probably a scouting party. Stop them before they can call their friends!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Whew, we got through that somehow...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> You really are an amazing ninja.<br> Your ability to detect enemies is unparalleled.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> He did notice the enemies before you, Doctor.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Simultaneously! It was simultaneous!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> There&#39;s a time lag, you know, so he has the advantage.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I think I&#39;d like his help from now on.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> I&#39;m very sensitive to the presence of others...</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> I will do my best to be of assistance to you.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> What seems to be the matter, Kotarou?</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> ...No, it&#39;s nothing.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> (...I sensed someone looking at me just now...<br> Was it just my imagination?)</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> All right, I&#39;ve sent Kotarou and Kintoki out on a recon and scouting mission.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> As for us, we should go to check on the safety of the area.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes. First of all, let&#39;s take a peek over that cliff and get a look around.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Good idea. If the view is good, we might be able to see something.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> I, Ushiwaka, have great confidence in my vision.<br> That&#39;s because I was raised on Mt. Kurama!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> How is it? Can you see anything?</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> ...Yes. I can see oni... and humans as well, gathering in an open space.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Humans? I see, so there are some on the island.<br> What is the situation like?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> A forced labor camp... It looks like oni are supervising the humans and making them work.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Yes. They&#39;re wielding whips and shouting\u2013 It looks like there are some oni that understand human language.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> The humans there are digging holes in the ground, and carrying dirt and logs...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Hmm. That really does sound like a forced labor camp.<br> I wonder why the oni are making humans do that?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I don&#39;t know. All I know is there are a lot of oni gathered there.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Even if we want to free the people working there, we&#39;ll just end up in the same mess as before.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> ...That&#39;s right. And there&#39;s more than just that one place where oni are forcing humans to work.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> To try and free everyone from all those camps...<br> I wouldn&#39;t say that&#39;s a realistic idea.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> It would be best to keep making our way inland, and do something about the mastermind... I think.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Gah! Don&#39;t sneak up on us like that!</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> I&#39;m sorry... I&#39;m a ninja so...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Welcome back. What did you find?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> E-Even when Kotarou sneaks up like that, you&#39;re still not phased. You really are something, Master.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> The information I have is just as I said.<br> I found several work locations, and...</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> A way to get to the middle of this island\u2014to the highest point.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Oh, so you&#39;ve found a route there?</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> Simply put, there is an easy path.<br> It is not difficult to traverse. But\u2013</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...But what?</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> To get to the top, we have to go through three gates that the oni have constructed along the way. There is no way around them.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> And...they seem to be closed at all times.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> To open those gates, you need the keys from three great oni who appear to be the gate keepers.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Three great oni guarding the three gates... I see.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> They also appear to be the ones commanding the lesser oni...</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> They are far more powerful than the lesser oni, with strength I&#39;ve never seen before.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> And what&#39;s more, I think...the oni have hired a terrifying guard.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> Unfortunately, that&#39;s when it got away from me...</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> It got away?</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> The oni that I extracted this information from.<br> I&#39;m sorry, but I&#39;m not very good at interrogation.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> However, that oni didn&#39;t seem to be lying, so I believe it was a good trade-off...</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Hahaa! You didn&#39;t have the desire to go after it and kill it, huh? You are very kind, Kotarou.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> If it had been me, I&#39;d have gone right after it, and made it regret its cowardice.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> No, that would have been a waste of time...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...Ushiwakamaru, who grins while speaking of violence, and Kotarou, always calm and unnervingly rational...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Japan&#39;s Heroic Spirits are, how to put this... They look approachable enough, but are actually terrifying...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I know what you mean.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Kotarou is a ninja after all.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> ...No, I&#39;m terribly sorry. I should have been more diligent with my work...</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> I should have finished it off.<br> You see, this is what happens\u2014</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> The beasts have been set upon us.<br> No matter how pitiable they are, oni are still oni.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> No, it isn&#39;t wrong to be compassionate, Kotarou! The ones to make a mistake are the oni coming to retaliate!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Attack! We&#39;ll cut our way through them, Master!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Kintoki should be back here soon.<br> Where is that guy?</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> I wonder if something happened to him...<br> I should have been the one to do all of the scouting.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> I mean...that thing he rides... It&#39;s so...noisy...</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> (Nods in agreement.)</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> No, it&#39;s presumptuous to think he would ride the whole time... I mean, seriously, why would he do that...?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Hahaha! I&#39;m really glad you have common sense, Kotarou.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> Uh?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Let&#39;s not be negative all the time and think something positive. We have to give some credit to the mobility of that Bear.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> He could be cruising around the lower part of the island at full speed. Let&#39;s wait a little longer.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> You&#39;re right. It is presumptuous of me to worry about him...</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> Shh! Quiet. Mr. Roman, do you detect anything?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Spot on, Kotarou. Something is approaching.<br> It definitely isn&#39;t Kintoki.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Understood. Let&#39;s hide for the time being and watch.</p><p><strong>Oni 1:</strong><br> Whew! ...What a pain. I&#39;m beat...<br> This is rough... This is hell, man...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...They&#39;ve come from the labor camp.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It seems they really can communicate. They look a little bit higher-ranked than those earlier ones...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...They&#39;re probably like middle management.<br> But I can&#39;t be sure right now.</p><p><strong>Oni 2:</strong><br> Whew! ...It sure ain&#39;t easy making humans work.<br> They start slacking off if you aren&#39;t watching...</p><p><strong>Oni 3:</strong><br> Then again, if you so much as whip them, they die.<br> I wish they&#39;d learn to be more brawny like us.</p><p><strong>Oni 3:</strong><br> What the heck do they eat anyway?<br> ...They should eat rocks! That&#39;ll build up their grit...</p><p><strong>Oni 1:</strong><br> Absolutely right! To be honest, I&#39;d rather do the work...<br> I mean, that&#39;d finish the castle way faster, right?</p><p><strong>Oni 1:</strong><br> The boss should&#39;ve just asked us to do it...<br> We&#39;d get the work done in less than two days.</p><p><strong>Oni 1:</strong><br> Then we could go party in town!<br> I&#39;m dying for some girls...</p><p><strong>Oni 2:</strong><br> Gyahahaha! With a face like that, your mom wouldn&#39;t even wanna be around! Anyway, I&#39;m hungry. I&#39;m gonna have some of that liver I brought.</p><p><strong>Oni 3:</strong><br> Seriously? You brought a lunchbox? You never forget, do you? And you&#39;re only a prison guard!</p><p><strong>Oni 2:</strong><br> I didn&#39;t bring this. I plucked the head off that useless old guy back there. It&#39;s a lame liver as well.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...These oni... We might be able to talk with them, but oni and humans...</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Stay calm, Mash. Oni have lives too, so they have complaints as well.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Well, at any rate, my lord, if you order me to do so, I will slice their heads off right away. How about it?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...So there are oni even here...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> W-Wait, Ushiwakamaru!<br> Let&#39;s observe a bit longer\u2013</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> ...No, let&#39;s wait and see a little longer.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That&#39;s right. This could be an ambush.<br> Let&#39;s observe for a little longer\u2013</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...Hmm? I&#39;m detecting something... Is this a Servant?<br> But Kintoki hasn&#39;t returned yet. What&#39;s this?</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> Ah!<br> Fujimaru, over there!</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> You there! What do you think you&#39;re doing?</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> ...How dare you kill an innocent old man for no reason! Like I thought, you&#39;re rotten to the core.</p><p><strong>Oni 1:</strong><br> Gya!?<br> Y-You&#39;re...</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> My blade is unwavering. Swift as thunder, glittering like the snow, and merciful like the raining heavens.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> \u2013Here is your punishment!<br> May you die in incredible agony!</p><p><strong>Oni 1:</strong><br> Gyaaaah!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> S-Senpai! A black-haired beauty is cutting down all the oni!</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> (What incredible swordsmanship!<br> She slices through an oni&#39;s hard flesh like it was tofu!)</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Foufou!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> We have no choice but to follow her lead!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> We can&#39;t let her fight alone!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> R-Right!<br> Let&#39;s go, Master!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I&#39;m not detecting any more enemies...<br> But...I don&#39;t know...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Is something bothering you?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Is something different than usual?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Yes. I&#39;m not sure how to put it, but there wasn&#39;t as much punch to them...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Looking at the data, it seems they&#39;re made up of spiritual bodies on the inside.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> They appear rough and crude, but in reality they could just be beings of higher spiritual existence.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I can&#39;t say all of the phantasmals in Japan are like this. Ushiwaka, what&#39;s your take?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> You were raised by Tengu, right?</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Hmm, I was often told it was forbidden to speak about my masters, so I can&#39;t really give you the details, but...</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Mystical creatures from this land are not terribly different than those from the West. They are mostly categorized as spiritual beasts or spirits of the dead.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Spiritual beasts are physical existences hidden from the human world. The other is born into this world as a living curse without physical form.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> These oni are the latter.<br> When I cut into them, there is no substance.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> They are like smoke that would kill you if inhaled.<br> They are born of a curse created by human deeds.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> So they&#39;re not a living creature of any proper ecosystem. Okay, then that makes sense.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> But this is no time to be talking casually! Fujimaru, put that pretty woman on camera!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I&#39;ve got to talk to her! She&#39;s got huge boo... I mean, she&#39;s got to be a huge source of information!</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> My, where is that voice coming from?</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> I sense someone both sensitive and discreet, and though he is timid, has high marks in versatility and reason...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Hate to break it to you, but he&#39;s a real chicken.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Oh, shush Fujimaru, you don&#39;t have to compliment me like that.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Who in the world are you...?</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Fufufu... Don&#39;t mind me too much.<br> I am merely a warrior passing by.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Either way, let me express my gratitude for your efforts, nameless foreigners.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Such unusual attire. How did you come to this island? There won&#39;t be any ship coming into the harbor for a while...</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> \u2014Oh my! Oh, my oh my oh my!<br> Such a preciously cute warrior. Who might you be?</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> My name is Mi... I mean, Ushiwakamaru. I admire how you did not give any ground when facing the oni.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> You appear to be no ordinary swordsman.<br> You look as if you are a warrior of great renown.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Well...fufufu... (Pat Pat)</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Wha!? ...Uhm, uhh...</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Honestly, though, you really shouldn&#39;t pay me any attention.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> This time, I was only doing things for my own ends, and you only did what you did for yours\u2013</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> As a result, our paths just happened to cross.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> If fortune brings us together once more, then so be it.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Now then, I will be going.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> She left...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> You should&#39;ve stopped her!<br> Aww man, I really wanted you to stop her!</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> ...No, we never could have stopped her. To question the activities of someone of such high rank is tantamount to rudeness.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> ...I am a man that lives in the shadows, but even I could tell what her rank is.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> She was a woman with an odd aura.<br> A magnanimous, maternal aura.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Uhmmm... That person... Hmmm?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> So you know her?</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> No, it&#39;s definitely the first time I&#39;ve met her.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> But her aura is one that I seem to know from somewhere, her aroma... How can I put it... It&#39;s kind of nostalgic... Hmm?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> (She&#39;s moving her hands like she could physically rewind her brain.)</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Well, there&#39;s no use pondering over what we don&#39;t know. At any rate, right now we\u2013Huh?</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Sorry about that! I&#39;m a little late.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Bear here is getting way out of hand!<br> We rode way further than I originally planned.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Ah, Kintoki.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> ...You&#39;re all right.<br> It&#39;s good to...see you back again...</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> ...Huh? What&#39;s this? Have you had yourselves a fight? Damn! I missed out on the fun. That&#39;s not fair, you guys.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Actually, we ourselves aren&#39;t entirely satisfied with the battle either...</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Most of this was handled by an armored warrior that just happened to be passing by. We hardly participated at all.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> An armored warrior?<br> There was someone like that here?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Yes. You could say she had terrific skill, as well as terrific va-voom... she was in many ways the essence of maternity...</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> \u2014Huh?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Though she wore armor, she stood slender and tall, and she was soft...or you could say attractive, I guess.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> At any rate, she carried herself with such charm that she gave off a lovely aroma. It appeared as if she was a warrior with renown, but...</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> ...What? You sure?<br> Could it be...?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Yes, Kintoki?</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Oh, no, it&#39;s nothing. Forget about that.<br> What&#39;s the situation now?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> You&#39;re right. Let us compare notes.<br> First\u2013</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> So... we can&#39;t get to the top without taking out three great oni, huh? And those dudes are golden strong.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> All right, this is getting interesting! There&#39;s nothing better than an easy-to-understand situation!</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> I knew you&#39;d say something like that, Kintoki!</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> I...agree.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Ahh... It&#39;s always like this with people that are always ready for a fight... Kintoki, what did you find out on your recon?</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Oh, yeah. Well, you already know about the labor camps where the oni are making humans work...</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> But I also found a place similar to a human settlement.<br> I only got a glimpse of it from far away though.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> A settlement, huh? Obviously it would be inefficient to keep them working constantly. It&#39;s necessary to give the humans a place to live as well.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> It&#39;s dangerous, but we might be able to get more information if we go there.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> We&#39;ll defeat the great oni defending the gates, and get their keys. Then we&#39;ll go to the settlement for information.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> We have a mission for the moment.<br> Let&#39;s be careful, Master!</p><h2 id="act-3-the-first-great-oni-appears" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#act-3-the-first-great-oni-appears" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Act 3: &quot;The First Great Oni Appears!&quot;</h2><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> By the way, my lord.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Thanks to your integrity, you have gained both Kotarou and Kintoki as companions.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> When we arrived here, we went over this once, but how about we discuss our roles one more time?</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> I say this as I believe if we settle it beforehand, we will be able to better fulfill our roles.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Our roles?</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Yes! The three animal companions of Momotarou, obviously! The original famed oni-exterminating companions!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Oh, you mean like Momotarou&#39;s companions...</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Yes, that&#39;s exactly right. Since we are exterminating oni, then it is a great honor!</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> First of all, naturally I am the dog\u2013</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou! Foufou!</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Oh, that&#39;s right. Fou and I are still in competition.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Regardless, whether we aim for the same role or not, we should declare which one we desire.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> From here onward, I think it best for our lord to decide which role is appropriate depending on our actions.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Now then, Mash, what about you?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> What? Me?<br> I&#39;m not particularly...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Mash is also very much like a faithful dog.<br> How about that?</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Really...</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fouu?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Doctor! You keep out of this!<br> I don&#39;t need any kind of role!</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> You have no desires, Mash?<br> Then, how about the pheasant role...</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> Uh?</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> On close inspection, you seem like you might be a bird, Kotarou. Your hair style and color kind of remind me of one.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> ...Are you happy with being the pheasant?</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> A bird... Yes, that&#39;s nice. If you don&#39;t mind me playing that role, then I don&#39;t mind.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Oh, that was a quick answer. Well, that settles the role of the pheasant. Next is Kintoki\u2013</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> No can do, Ushiwaka. That&#39;s not something I&#39;m going to do. I just ain&#39;t into it.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> What? Why not? (He must have known I was going to make him the monkey!?)</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> My name is Golden. Call me Golden. I mean, you and I have fought together in many battles.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> We&#39;re already best buddies, right?<br> So just call me by my True Name.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Isn&#39;t that right, Kotarou? You&#39;re thinking the same!</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> ...W-Well, yes. Golden...does have a nice...ring to it,<br> I think...</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> Also, Ushiwakamaru, I&#39;m not so sure about making Kintoki the monkey. I mean, there isn&#39;t a monkey as strong as he is.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> If there were, then that would be the end of Japan. The future Nikko Edomura Park is still to come, you know.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> W-Well, yes, I understand that, but...<br> Why do you have to get so defensive, Kotarou?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> (Yes, when it comes to Kintoki, Kotarou&#39;s eyes become quite serious...)</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> ...Hmm. What you say does make sense though, Kotarou.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Kintoki... I mean, Golden is best suited for the role of Momotarou.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> But our Master is in that role. Perhaps we will have to employ a double-Momotarou system\u2013</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> What? The monkey role? Nothing wrong with that. I&#39;ll take it. I was raised in the mountains, so I&#39;m perfect for it.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> That was unexpected...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I thought he wouldn&#39;t like it.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> I don&#39;t mind at all. You don&#39;t realize how strong a monkey is, do you?</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> The monkeys that lived on my mountain were crazy strong.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> They&#39;re on par with bears. There was even this one monkey I had a damn long sumo battle with.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> He had wicked thick arms and pitch-black hair.<br> But he had these sad eyes with a deep understanding.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> That one was a wise mountain sage.<br> But when he got excited, he was like a storm!</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> He&#39;d pound his chest like a drum and walk like a beast, dragging his huge fists on the ground.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> It was like all his wisdom transformed into muscle... Dang, thinkin&#39; about this has me in the mood for some sumo!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Hmm, that probably wasn&#39;t a monkey, but more likely a mountain goril...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> What kind of ecosystem was on that mountain that you grew up on?</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> ...Wow. I had no idea animals like that lived on the mountain... my training is still far from finished...</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> At any rate, we&#39;ve settled all three of the companions&#39; roles! Now we can make headway as oni exterminators!</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> All right, let&#39;s be going, my lord!<br> First we go to the great oni that&#39;s nearby!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It seems...we&#39;re on the right track.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I&#39;ve identified a conspicuously large heat source! It&#39;s him! Just looking at this I can tell it&#39;s different than other oni!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...No, wait!<br> There&#39;s also\u2013a Servant there!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Could this be the formidable guard that we heard about? Who is\u2013</p><p><strong>Kojirou:</strong><br> ...Aah.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Kojirou:</strong><br> Would it be all right if we spoke first?<br> I have a little something I wish to ask.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Yes.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Go right ahead.</p><p><strong>Kojirou:</strong><br> I am Sasaki Kojirou. The radiance of my secret technique was requested, so I was hired by the oni as a guard\u2013</p><p><strong>Kojirou:</strong><br> Then, based on the absurd... Nay, bold idea that \u201CSwallows and pheasants are all birds so they are basically the same, right?\u201D</p><p><strong>Kojirou:</strong><br> ...I was given the role of a 1-star pheasant-terminator, with the mission to slay the evil bird that could shoot beams out of its beak.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Kojirou:</strong><br> ...Now, where&#39;s the pheasant?</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> He is right here.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> ...Hello.</p><p><strong>Kojirou:</strong><br> You&#39;re a person!<br> What? Where is your beak!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That&#39;s what you&#39;re upset about?</p><p><strong>Kojirou:</strong><br> Of course I&#39;m angry! I may be a recluse, but I don&#39;t have that much free time!</p><p><strong>Kojirou:</strong><br> You see... I came here seeking a swallow that is equal to the one I fought that day...</p><p><strong>Kojirou:</strong><br> But all I find is a spy with hair that looks like a bird!<br> This isn&#39;t what I was promised!</p><p><strong>Kojirou:</strong><br> You&#39;d think you&#39;d at least bring a Heroic Spirit that&#39;s a falconer, or one that turned into a bird in legends, or has some connection to birds!</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> Ohh...I&#39;m sorry... I don&#39;t think I can shoot beams, nor do I have beak...</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> ...Uhm, My name is Fuuma Kotarou. I&#39;m the pheasant of the group. If it&#39;s ninjutsu you need, I might be able to do something...</p><p><strong>Kojirou:</strong><br> What? Fuuma Kotarou? The Fuuma Clan that&#39;s second only to Iga and Kouga ninjas?</p><p><strong>Kojirou:</strong><br> Well well, my apologies. If I could cross swords with the leader of the Fuuma, that would be enough to satisfy me.</p><p><strong>Kojirou:</strong><br> You have a good name, too. Kotarou. Kojirou. A peerless pair of names we have, and the beginning of a friendship.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> No, there will be no beginning.<br> From now on, I shall become the Kojirou-terminator.</p><p><strong>Kojirou:</strong><br> Why!? We are both Japanese Servants, right!?</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> Silence! Timid I may be, but there are three things that I cannot forgive!</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> One, people who don&#39;t take care of their weapons.<br> Two, subordinates who chase away the deliveryman.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> And finally, three\u2014 Anyone who dares to rank my Fuuma Clan lower than Iga and Kouga!</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> You, sir, have crossed the line! As the fifth leader of the Fuuma ninja, I shall take that rare sword as a trophy!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> There&#39;s a bit of self-interest in that anger, Senpai!</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Whoa! That&#39;s pretty dang impressive! Maybe we outta change your role from the pheasant, eh?</p><p><strong>Kojirou:</strong><br> I see. I may not have stepped upon the tiger&#39;s tail, but it seems I have ruffled the bird&#39;s feathers. Disappointing, yet pleasing as well.</p><p><strong>Kojirou:</strong><br> Enough talk. Now we fight to the death.</p><p><strong>Kojirou:</strong><br> However, my good Kotarou, as an apology for my impolite remark earlier, let me give you some advice.</p><p><strong>Kojirou:</strong><br> This great oni&#39;s name is Kazakoemaru. According to the Oni King, he is heralded as the embodiment of speed.</p><p><strong>Kojirou:</strong><br> He cannot be beaten when it comes to speed. Even up against my sword. Heed that when you face him.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Hey, hey! His speed can&#39;t be beaten? We&#39;ll see about that when he faces me and my Bear here!</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> All right! It&#39;s time to challenge him to a speed battle!<br> You climb on that oni and ease up to the line!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> No, I don&#39;t think he means that kind of speed.<br> Probably...</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> That is so like you, Kintoki. Overcoming an opponent in their area of expertise, that is what you would call a true victory\u2013Isn&#39;t that right?</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> It is an attack they won&#39;t see coming.<br> It&#39;s bound to deal a huge blow to them psychologically.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> However, our opponent seems pretty confident in its ability. It might be difficult to beat it if we charge recklessly\u2013</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> In fact, if we are to take it on with speed, then I think we need to make the appropriate preparations.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Do we fight against its strong point, or do we try some other method? I leave the decision about that up to you, Master.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Whatever you choose, I will support you completely.<br> This could be a long fight, so let&#39;s all do our best, Master!</p><h2 id="act-4-kazakoemaru-repelled-decisive-battle" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#act-4-kazakoemaru-repelled-decisive-battle" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Act 4: &quot;Kazakoemaru Repelled!&quot; [Decisive Battle]</h2><p><strong>Kojirou:</strong><br> Ugh...

With this many, there&#39;s really nothing we can do for them.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> We can&#39;t prepare a ship to take them to the mainland anytime soon, and we&#39;re not equipped as a rescue team to begin with.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> With our limited numbers, the best we can do is eliminate the cause.

What a blessing it would be! Ho ho!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I know that Benkei is already quite powerful...<br> but he seems a lot more powerful than usual...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Sumo matches aside, please answer my questions first. Why are you here?</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> A retainer must follow his lord at all times. Of course,<br> I am here to aid the Master and Lord Yoshitsune.</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> There is another settlement higher up, so I went looking for you there, but couldn&#39;t find you.</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> I went elsewhere and searched about for you, and eventually ended up here.</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> I am very glad we could meet up.<br> Let us march forth and exterminate these oni!</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> Oh, there&#39;s no need to worry.

Actually, make that a literally meaningless collection of weapons.</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> Sakata Kintoki.

In the end, all we can do is get rid of the one behind everything.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Tch! ...They&#39;ve all got eyes like dead fish.<br> The food here must be pretty damn awful...</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> If I had the time, I&#39;d go around and knock some golden energy into every single one of them.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Actually before that, they need breakfast.<br> You can&#39;t get any energy if you got nothing to burn.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> If only Tawara was around...<br> That way I could at least make some rice balls...</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> ...Kintoki...making...rice balls!?<br> Kintoki can cook!?</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> S-So what, you got a problem with that? It&#39;s just rice balls, of course I can make them. I&#39;m a man after all.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> I mean, despite the way I look, I was brought up by a wealthy samurai general.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Even if we did nothing, we&#39;d get served one hellavuh meal for breakfast. That just ain&#39;t my style.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> I get really nervous if I gotta worry about table manners starting from breakfast, ya know? Rice balls are enough for me.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> Yes, I know how you feel!</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> I always say something simple for breakfast is best, yet my subordinates somehow always got obsessed over it and would bring me too much!</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Ain&#39;t that right! I wanted to get out and play as fast as I could. I didn&#39;t want to just sit around eating all day!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Yeah, sounds like the kind of things said by boys that really gave their mothers a headache...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> At any rate, Kotarou, you and Kintoki seem to get along well. Are you fine with that?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> You are the head of the Fuuma clan, right? Don&#39;t you think it would be bad for you to be getting along with an outlaw?</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> Oh...well, I..I guess so...<br> But, I mean, Kintoki is, well...</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> (Good, good... I am not being lumped in as one of the outlaws. That&#39;s only natural, but still...)</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> (Again, someone is watching us...)</p><h2 id="act-6-master-and-servant" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#act-6-master-and-servant" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Act 6: &quot;Master and Servant&quot;</h2><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> Um... Fujimaru.<br> I suggest that we stop our advance.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> There is what appears to be a checkpoint ahead.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Hey, you there, sweaty Benkei. You came from the settlement ahead. How did you get around this?</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> I&#39;m embarrassed to say... I didn&#39;t get through the checkpoint. I lost my footing and fell down the cliff.</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> It was a fortunate mistake. Thanks to that, I was able to arrive at the settlement you were at.</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> Dear me, am I ever embarrassed about that. If I hadn&#39;t been in good shape, I would have died instantly.</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> With age, my eyes have been opened to the greater truth: that muscle trumps wisdom!</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Hmm.

Praising me as a genius in front of other people like that... It&#39;s pretty embarrassing...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...With her kind of one-way dependence and affection... I have no problem understanding just how difficult it was for Ushiwakamaru&#39;s brother...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> But I don&#39;t think that the path Benkei took was necessarily foolish.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> With mountains of this scale, you may as well ignore the roads when going down. Jumping off a cliff means you can forget about the gates.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> \u2013The problem for us is having to go up the mountain.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> These are cliffs we cannot scale; even if we have the strength as Heroic Spirits,</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> if the oni spotted us while we were climbing up, it would be the end of us.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Ultimately, the only choice we have is to follow this mountain trail to the top.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The path is narrow, and there are steep drops on either side... There&#39;s no other way around. What should we do, Master?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Can&#39;t we force our way through?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> The checkpoint itself is smaller than the gate guarded by the great oni...but the number of oni I&#39;m detecting is quite high.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> There&#39;s a lookout as well, so it&#39;s nearly impossible without a plan.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Is there any way to get through?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Well, I&#39;m detecting a large number of oni from over there. It&#39;s too dangerous to try to force our way through.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> You know...the one thing that my Bear can do is to bust into them at full throttle!</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> Well then...how about this?</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> We&#39;ll distract the lookout and then sneak into the checkpoint.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> After that, we&#39;ll cause a commotion to throw them into confusion, and then right at that moment, Kintoki charges in\u2013</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> Basically, we&#39;ll conduct attacks from inside and out simultaneously.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> You mean I&#39;ll show up at the very end?<br> Now that&#39;s what I call being a golden hero, man!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Let&#39;s try it out!</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> Got it. Just let me prepare a little for this...</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> All right. How does this look?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Wow! That&#39;s an amazing disguise! As expected of a ninja... Is that also part of Fuuma&#39;s secret techniques?</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> No, it&#39;s simply a kind of makeup\u2013 I&#39;m simply mimicking their looks. It&#39;s not that difficult at all.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> The secret technique of the Fuuma is to wield the power of a true oni, so that\u2013 Never mind, that&#39;s not important right now.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> Let&#39;s infiltrate by acting as if we&#39;re bringing in fresh human laborers.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> I&#39;m sorry, everyone, but please let me tie this rope around your waists.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It needs to look as real as possible. If you would, please.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> Excellent. Now, then\u2013</p><p><strong>Oni:</strong><br> \u2013Gah!? Halt! Who are you!?</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> Gah ha ha! By the Great Oni&#39;s orders, I&#39;ve captured more humans and I&#39;m bringing them in. Let me through.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> (He talks like them, too!)</p><p><strong>Oni:</strong><br> Nobody told me about this...</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> You know how bad communication is.

Yeah, well, I guess it&#39;s fine.<br> I&#39;ll just note what kind of humans you brought along...</p><p><strong>Oni:</strong><br> First, there&#39;s a fairly healthy human that&#39;s pretty darn pale...</p><p><strong>Oni:</strong><br> A powerful male that looks like he&#39;ll work hard.</p><p><strong>Oni:</strong><br> Is this a monk? I guess even humans need your type to relieve their discontent, huh?</p><p><strong>Oni:</strong><br> ...Dang, you really caught one here...<br> This one&#39;s like a tsuchinoko...</p><p><strong>Oni:</strong><br> Oh! And this female certainly looks soft! Kyahaha!<br> I guess you&#39;ll be fixing meals for the humans, eh?</p><p><strong>Oni:</strong><br> And then\u2013</p><p><strong>Oni:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Oni:</strong><br> ...Wait.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> ...What is it?</p><p><strong>Oni:</strong><br> That one there just isn&#39;t right!<br> What the heck is with that shameless outfit?</p><p><strong>Oni:</strong><br> She&#39;s far too small to be doing any work that needs muscle. And I sure don&#39;t think she can do any woman&#39;s work.</p><p><strong>Oni:</strong><br> Just look how shameless she is! Are you sure the Great Oni said to bring this one!?</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> ...(Not good!)</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> Hold it right there, Mr. Oni! Though I am a captive, let me, a monk, ask you a question!</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> You say there&#39;s a woman dressed shamelessly...<br> But is that what you really see?</p><p><strong>Oni:</strong><br> ...Huh?</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> With all my training as a monk, I might sense her presence... However, I am not sure about the others... (Glance)</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> R-Right. What the heck are you talking about!?<br> There&#39;s nobody like that here.</p><p><strong>Oni:</strong><br> No, hold on. That one right there\u2013</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> But still you insist? Then it must be true.<br> \u2013She is a seductress!</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> Even an oni cannot resist being captivated by a seductress. Dangerous, dangerous. Far too dangerous. In that case, I shall eliminate the threat!</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> \u2013Take that!</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Ouch!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> (H-He just gave Ushiwakamaru a really nasty punch!)</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> ...Whew. I have eliminated the threat. Namo.</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> Even if she was a seductress, then this should have taken care of it, right? Now then, I beg your pardon.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> (He&#39;s dragging along the completely unconscious Ushiwakamaru...)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> (Passing the flabbergasted guard\u2013)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> (A-At any rate, we&#39;ve passed into the checkpoint!)</p><p><strong>Oni:</strong><br> ...Wait. Wait, wait, wait!<br> There really is something odd about you\u2013!</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> We&#39;ve made it this far. Now that we&#39;re inside the guard will be easy.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> We just set off a false alarm, destroy the facilities, and lead them into infighting. We&#39;ll cause all kinds of confusion\u2013</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> It&#39;s about time. I&#39;ll send Kintoki the signal!</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Hah! Finally! That&#39;s the signal...<br> Let&#39;s rock! You and me, Kotarou, let&#39;s rumble!</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Use that incredibly cool Noble Phantasm to mess them up!

It is an honor for a Fuuma to be summoned by you, Kintoki! Take this! Immortal Golden Brigade!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> He&#39;s totally gotten into it!

Especially you, Kotarou.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> ...Not at all. I couldn&#39;t have done it alone.<br> We defeated them because we worked together.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> There were a couple of times that felt like we weren&#39;t going to make it. Especially when... Um...</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Okay, the time has come. You, Benkei!<br> Right there! On your knees! Head down!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> (Ushiwakamaru already has her hand on her sword! Senpai! You have to stop her!)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Impossible, I mean...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I. TRUST. USHIWAKA.</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> Hahaha! All right, I see.<br> This brings back memories!</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> What?</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> Subscription list, you know. The subscription list.<br> This is just like that time. You remember that, right?</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> On our way to Hiraizumi, when we crossed the border of Kaga, and that Togashi fellow spotted you, Lord Yoshitsune.</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> I read a false subscription list, and later I ended up having to slap you around\u2013</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> ...You dare to speak of the subscription list? Do you even understand the meaning behind the tears shed by Benkei?</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> Of course I understand.<br> I am not Benkei just for the fun of it.</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> My body, my spirit, my belief are all true. If I ever make a mistake, then you may dismiss me on the spot.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> ...Fine. That was quite a feat you accomplished with that dunderhead.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> W-Well, at least we got past that difficult spot.<br> Why don&#39;t we keep on moving ahead, okay?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Ushiwakamaru, I understand how you feel, but...</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> I&#39;m not angry. It was all thanks to Benkei that we got past that point.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> ...However, the mystery continues to deepen.<br> How come Benkei is so powerful on this island?</p><h2 id="act-7-big-brother" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#act-7-big-brother" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Act 7: &quot;Big Brother&quot;</h2><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> You look troubled, Ushiwakamaru.<br> Is there something bothering you?</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Of course. It&#39;s Benkei.<br> Also what happened at the gate back there.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> My lord, was he that strong before?<br> He certainly looks like he&#39;s larger...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> It&#39;s better than becoming weaker.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Well, yes, that&#39;s true.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> But it seems awfully unnatural.<br> I wonder if he ate some strange herbs...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Do you suspect him of using drugs!?</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> Hahaha! Nice joke! I do nothing that would shame me before the Buddha.</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> I had some delicious tea at the teahouse, though.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Tea...you say? On this island?</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> Yes. I think it&#39;s just before the next gate. There is a teahouse at the first settlement that I went to.</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> It was bright inside, and the customers weren&#39;t gloomy like the people in that settlement, but very lively.</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> How about we go there to gather information?<br> We might be able to hear some interesting news.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I like that. Let&#39;s go!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Come to think of it, Kojirou said something about that too...</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Foufou!</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Ooh! Taking a break at a rest stop during a trip is a real pleasure. I have no complaints about heading there first.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Yes. Actually, I&#39;m thirsty too.</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> Oh, that&#39;s not good.</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> Come to think of it, the tea was so good that I had the teahouse fill my flask with it. Go ahead, have some.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Oh, you&#39;re very kind. Thank you for this.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> (Glug glug) Hmm... This tea has a strange flavor...<br> It is definitely delicious, but...</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> ...Hiccup!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Huh!? U-Ushiwakamaru? What&#39;s the matter?</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> What are you talking about, Mash.<br> There&#39;s nothing wrong with me at all.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Okay, now that we know where we&#39;re going, let&#39;s get moving. Ooh! Have a look at that, my lord.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> There is a jizo statue at the side of the road here.<br> It appears that some humans here still have faith.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...It appeared as if her complexion was off, but...<br> She seems normal...</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I don&#39;t think so... She&#39;s been standing there and staring at that jizo statue for a while now. What&#39;s going on...?</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Ah... My older brother!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Huh!?</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> This...this statue&#39;s face!<br> It looks just like my brother!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> A-Are you serious?<br> It just looks like an ordinary jizo to me...</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Yes. It&#39;s nothing more than a standard jizo.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> (...Nod nod)</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> That&#39;s because none of you know my brother! This smooth skin, this stone-like appearance, this special presence...and this expression!</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> This is exactly what my brother&#39;s face looks like when he peers at me with those cold, dead eyes!</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> I guess if you say so, Lord Yoshitsune, then it must be true.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Well, who&#39;d have thought I&#39;d find such a fine gem in a place like this? ...It must be the work of a renowned stonemason or a monk.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> But this is Onigashima. Who knows when some oni with no sense of worth might come along and crush it?</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Then I must protect my dear brother.<br> You&#39;re coming with me. Up you go!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Ushiwakamaru has tucked the jizo under her arm... She&#39;s picked it up and is walking off with it. I-Is that all right?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Well, no, I don&#39;t think so, but there doesn&#39;t seem to be anyone around who might claim ownership of it...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> But, you know, Ushiwakamaru seems to have suddenly started saying and doing odd things, and her attitude has changed a little\u2013</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Hm? She appears normal, but something is odd about her... Didn&#39;t something like this happen before?</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> And now unexpected enemies!<br> I&#39;m ready for you!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> What? Enemies?<br> But how?</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Isn&#39;t it obvious\u2013?<br> So I can offer the heads of our enemies to him!</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> With enemies appearing so soon after finding my brother, it means only one thing! My brother wants the enemy leader&#39;s head\u2014</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> 1, 2, 3\u2013 Look at them all!<br> Yes! The more, the merrier!</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> I will offer a mountain of freshly taken oni heads dripping with blood to my brother, and he will praise me!</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> He&#39;ll say, \u201CAgain, Yoshitsune? Well done. Now get back to the battlefield before Masako comes in here shouting!\u201D</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Master!

It&#39;s a counterattack!</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> This is no attack! Hah!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Look at that! She dodged with such swiftness...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Huh? Something is rolling around at Ushiwakamaru&#39;s feet...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Ah!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Well, it was bound to happen with her bouncing around and fighting like that. There must have been quite an impact on the jizo she was carrying too...</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Ah! ...My brother&#39;s head has come off!</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Why you...! How dare you do that to my brother!</p><p><strong>Oni:</strong><br> Skreeee!?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Unacceptable!</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> My brother&#39;s head... Where is it?<br> ...There it is! S-Stop!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The jizo&#39;s head is rolling away at an incredible speed.<br> It&#39;s like a rice ball rolling along...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> And ahead of it there&#39;s\u2013Uh-oh!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That&#39;s a...Japanese traditional man-made agricultural fertilizer production facility\u2013</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> You mean a cesspit.</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> And it&#39;s fallen in.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Poor Jizo...

My, my, Kintoki!<br> What a delightful toy you&#39;re riding there.</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> (Sigh) How nice it must be to be you. Whenever, wherever, you&#39;re always so straightforward and pure.</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> Rather than the niceties of the heart, you are satisfied with the enjoyment of the practical. Yes, yes! You are so admirable!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Wh-What&#39;s gotten into her?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> She seems to be sulking...<br> She has a glazed look in her eyes.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Fox! What&#39;s going on here?<br> Have you sided with the oni?</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> Oh, do you need to know?<br> Do you need an explanation?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> If you would, please.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> ...I have a pretty good idea why already.</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> How fortunate for you. That would bring tears to this hot-headed, animal-ear-wearing, high-flying Tamamo.</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> ...But if you&#39;ve already figured it out, then I wish you&#39;d have done something about it sooner!</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> I... I have...been waiting here forever.</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> I&#39;ve been thinking how unfair it is that Nero is so lucky!<br> I want a grand stage made just for me, too!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...What?</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> Onigashima! It&#39;s Onigashima! This Japanese-style stage! Onigashima means Momotarou. And when you think of Momotarou, how can you forget his three companions...</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> But then, why?<br> W-H-Y\u2013!!</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> Why am I not in the role of the dog!?</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> Look at these! What do you think these ears are for, huh? Do you understand!?</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> Is there anyone more suitable than me to play the part of the dog? If there is, then let them come forward!</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Uh...my lord. To be perfectly honest, I&#39;m feeling some pretty dreadful pressure here.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> That glint in her eyes, it&#39;s just like an oni! That&#39;s the look of an oni god! The same type as Masako-sama!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou...</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> \u201CThey&#39;ve probably just forgotten, that must be it.\u201D I kept lying to myself, but of course, no matter how long I waited, the offer never came.</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> I just couldn&#39;t put up with it any longer.</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> That&#39;s when I thought I would just go to Onigashima myself, and force my way onto the stage.</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> But, that is where a heroine&#39;s self-respect comes in.<br> Yes, I do have pride.</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> I couldn&#39;t exactly do it sober, so I got hammered with some wine from some teahouse.</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> I let myself go and decided to stand in your way. Since you wanted to know, that&#39;s what&#39;s going on here\u2606</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> As usual, you&#39;re only faithful to your own lusts, you animal! If you want to play, then do it somewhere else!</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> Buzz off! Mine is a problem that a leading character like you, Kintoki, wouldn&#39;t understand. I&#39;ve got a poem for people like you.</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> Don&#39;t assume that you / Will always have a part to play / As Master&#39;s Servant!</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> So let&#39;s fight. Who wants to battle me for the dog role?</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> Despite how I look, I&#39;m a real carnivore...<br> I&#39;m a savage honey badger.</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> That attitude that makes you disregard me while you proceed with the story\u2013 I&#39;ll straighten it out right now!</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> \u201CDespite how you look\u201D? Huh... Don&#39;t you mean<br> \u201CNo matter how you look at it\u201D?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Don&#39;t do it, Kotarou! Tamamo may not seem like it, but she is easily hurt and easily angered!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The rule in dealing with her is to not comment on anything you think is odd with her!</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> My, my, Mash!

That&#39;s why.</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Damn, this really threw me off.<br> Either way, I shall not have a change of heart.</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> You bastards are still my enemies.<br> \u2014Especially when that guy is around.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Yeah? The feeling is mutual, Ibaraki. You want to take another shot at me, huh? To finish what we started?</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> Who is it that can make Kintoki talk like that...<br> Fujimaru, just who is that oni?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Well, he...I mean, she is Ibaraki-Douji.<br> The one next to her is Shuten-Douji.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Not that long ago we were involved in something together. We spent several days battling at Rashomon in Kyoto.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> I can&#39;t believe this.<br> She&#39;s the rumored Great Oni of Mt. Ooe...</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> Hm! Is that so?<br> It seems that my training is lacking.</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> I was convinced they were merely friendly and gracious teahouse girls that served delicious tea!</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> So that&#39;s who the mountain pass serving girls were, old man? You said they were total babes, so I was totally expecting\u2014</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> \u2014Who were you expecting?</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Nobody! Just forget about it!<br> My clutch just slipped a little, that&#39;s all!</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Anyway, back to the main issue, Ibaraki and Shuten! What the heck are you plotting by building this island?</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> \u2014Huh?</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> \u2014I knew it.<br> It&#39;s just like I told you, Ibaraki.</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> \u2014Hah. Haha! Gahahahaha!</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Foolish, you are such a fool, Kintoki! We are your greatest enemies! Why would we answer your\u2013</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> That&#39;s right! We&#39;re not going to tell you aaaanything.<br> I mean, we have nothing to do with this island.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You have nothing to do with it?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Well, it does seem that way...</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Sh-Shuten!<br> Why would you go ahead and tell them that!?</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> They&#39;d figure it out soon enough. It&#39;s not that important. (Sigh) You still don&#39;t know how to push people&#39;s buttons do you, Ibaraki?</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Ah! Ugh...B-But we&#39;re enemies... and even if you talk about buttons, I don&#39;t know anything about sewing...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Don&#39;t you worry about it, Ibaraki-Douji.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I think when Shuten-Douji talks about pushing people&#39;s buttons, she&#39;s also including you.</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Y-You think so?<br> ...You know, for a human, you don&#39;t smell half bad. There&#39;s no nastiness in you.</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> ...So you must be Mash. That&#39;s a nice name. Sounds like what an oni would call their wine in Japanese.</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> ...Anyway, it&#39;s like Shuten said.<br> We didn&#39;t even notice when this island was made.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> So you&#39;re really not involved with it at all? So the oni on this island are from a different clan than you?</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> Clan? ...Yeah, they&#39;re from a different clan.<br> It looks like the oni here are from somewhere else.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> I don&#39;t know who&#39;s behind this, but it&#39;s a disgrace to us if someone can build an island like this overnight.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> Ibaraki and I got really angry about it.<br> We came here to sightsee, and crush the place.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> We can&#39;t be having this botched Onigashima, these oni, or humans hanging around. We came to this island to turn it upside down!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Then why are you running a teahouse?</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> Fufufufu. If we&#39;re going to do it, we may as well have fun. Just coming in to smash and kill is so... unrefined.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> Especially when we&#39;re up against these ugly oni. We want to have fun and put an end to this with elegance.</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> That&#39;s right. So for our first step, Shuten and myself sneaked into the island&#39;s treasure room.</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Stealing treasures is what oni do. When it comes to lock picking and sneaking, I&#39;m better than any oni around.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> When we were in there, we found an interesting cup.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> To try it out, I poured some wine in and drank it, and it tasted familiar\u2014</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> I had a realization and understood how this all started. I knew it wouldn&#39;t be good for just us to go crushing this island.</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> That&#39;s right. After taking a drink she said<br> \u201CWhy don&#39;t we wait for Kintoki to join us?\u201D of all things.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> Would you shut up, Ibaraki? Anyways, since we had some good wine, naturally we had to have a banquet.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> That&#39;s why we&#39;re out here serving wine.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> I don&#39;t know what it&#39;s like further up, but now there&#39;s a spell on all the oni and humans from here on down.</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Wahaha! Did you catch her grandiose plan? Fear her! Prostrate yourself! Cry in despair!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Well, no, that wasn&#39;t all that frightening...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> But there are several things that bother me about what you said. You poured wine into a cup? It tasted familiar? Could it be\u2013</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> If it isn&#39;t the spineless Onmyouji.<br> Fufu, yes, it&#39;s just as you predicted.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> This is the same kind of \u201Cwish granting\u201D cup from back in Rashomon. But it&#39;s not as powerful as it was back then.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> What did you say!?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> True... There isn&#39;t any mist like back in Rashomon. So I guess it doesn&#39;t have the power to make anybody in the surrounding area drunk anymore.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> That&#39;s right. But... If you directly drink the liquor, it might have some effect.</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> In that case, the delicious tea I&#39;ve had here was\u2013</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> Argh... I can&#39;t believe you&#39;ve tricked me into breaking my vow of abstinence! I suppose it&#39;s fortunate that it had little effect on me!</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Then that means what was in Benkei&#39;s flask was also... No wonder it tasted so funny.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> But it seems that I did not act oddly from the effects of the alcohol! It must be because I am a genius!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Hmm... Benkei&#39;s appearance...<br> And how she acted with that jizo statue...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Mash, let&#39;s forget about what happened.<br> Talking about it won&#39;t do anybody any good.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> So then... What shall we do, boy?</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> About what?</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> You&#39;re still as dense as ever.<br> Or are you just acting stupid?</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> I&#39;m suggesting we work together.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> What!?</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> There&#39;s no need to act so surprised.<br> We just want to eliminate the oni on this island.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> And you too want to do something about the mastermind who created this island, do you not?</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> Thanks to this cup, we still owe you for what happened before. I am sure our interests won&#39;t cause a conflict...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...I suppose so. Based on what she said, the mastermind behind Onigashima and the incident at Rashomon...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> These two events are most definitely connected somehow. What should we do, Master?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I think it&#39;s fine.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Hold on. Sorry, but I can&#39;t agree with that.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Well...</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> With these two, you&#39;re right to be suspicious, Boss.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> These two are oni. Just because they are the enemy of this island&#39;s oni, that doesn&#39;t make them our friends.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> It&#39;s not a matter of whether we can trust them or not. Nothing good will come out of oni being together with humans.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> ...It&#39;s different when humans betray each other. Humans are like... you know... They reason things out before a betrayal.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Oni are different. They will betray you without any reasons. They slit your throat and take your treasure while you sleep. To them it&#39;s like breathing.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> They&#39;ll even go as far as destroying something they consider dear if it suits them.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> ...That&#39;s what an oni is. Oni are the kind of monsters you don&#39;t want to sympathize with.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> Are you saying you want to put a collar on me? Fufu. Boy, you have unexpectedly abnormal taste...</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Don&#39;t be stupid! Even with a collar on you, I wouldn&#39;t feel at ease!</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> Ohhh... Then how about the other way &#39;round?</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> It might be nice if we put you in a collar, boy.<br> That way we can have a nice, peaceful alliance.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> Then we could walk, fight, eat, drink together, and pick your bones all we want. Yes, that&#39;s a possibility. Let&#39;s do that.</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Gah hah! I thought you were joking when you said you wanted to cooperate with these guys\u2013But in this case...</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Killing the oni on this island will sure make us hungry. This way, we can chew on these guys&#39; bones while we&#39;re at it!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou!?</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Ugh... Such fearsome aura!</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> So these are the great oni of Mt. Ooe...<br> Ibaraki-Douji and Shuten-Douji...</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Oh, this I like! It&#39;s easy to understand! We won&#39;t work with you, but we can&#39;t leave you alone either!</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Your tour of Onigashima ends here, Shuten! I&#39;ll see you oni in hell, because that&#39;s where I&#39;m sending you!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Ugh...</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> I cannot believe the power they have with those bodies!</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> Ohh, how charming. I wonder... why am I feeling more excitable than a usual murder spree...</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> Perhaps it&#39;s because of the Master? I sure want to know the feeling of being commanded by this [\u2642 boy /\u2640 girl].</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Hah! You drunkard, are you jealous!?</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> You were all talk earlier, now what? Thinking about switching sides? Sure you&#39;re an oni, but I might reconsider if there&#39;s a Master with you!</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> That&#39;s because you&#39;ll be under the binding of Command Spells! You wouldn&#39;t be able to do jack about it!</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Naturally, with your twisted personality, Boss here probably wouldn&#39;t even trust you with anything!</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> Hey! You watch out!<br> How dare you interfere with my business!</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> Or are you just jealous?<br> If that&#39;s it, then perhaps it isn&#39;t so bad.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> Don&#39;t you worry, I won&#39;t forget about it either, boy.<br> I will take everything you give to me as well...</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> Ooh! This is fun! So much fun!</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> I love this kind of deep, deep tangling of the flesh with handsome men...</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> It&#39;s like partaking of beautiful wine from the heavens.<br> It&#39;s so intoxicating that I could become addicted to it forever...</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Gya hah hah!

No, I&#39;m still able...</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Heh heh! Gah hah hah! I know it. I know it well.<br> Your swordsmanship and smell.</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> You&#39;re\u2014a Minamoto!</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> ...So what if I am, oni?</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Keh keh, keh keh keh, keh keh keh keh keh! Oh, I see! Now this is getting interesting, Shuten!</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> We have business with the entire Minamoto clan...<br> Not just Sakata Kintoki over there!</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> This is a good chance for payback. Can you block my attacks with that meager physique of yours!?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Uh-oh! She&#39;s going to use her Noble Phantasm!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Ushiwakamaru is so exhausted that she doesn&#39;t have her usual agility!</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Can you dodge ten straight blows from my blazing fist? At the count of ten, you&#39;ll be nothing but bone\u2014 The Great Flame of Mt. Ooe!</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> Lord Yoshitsune, forgive me!</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Ah!</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> How loyal! But I am just getting started!</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> One, two, three, four, five\u2013!</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> Ugh! Oof! Gah!</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Benkei! What are you doing!? Withdraw!</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> I can still fight! There&#39;s no need to stand tall in front of me to protect me!</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Six, seven, eight...</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> Ugh! Ah! Namo...!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Master! If this keeps up, Benkei will...</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Benkei... You... You\u2013</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> You foooooool!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> !!?</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Yes, that&#39;s right! You&#39;re a fool!<br> What will you accomplish by dying here?</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Your wish is to make the renowned name of Musashibou yours forever\u2013</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> But I know that doesn&#39;t mean for you to die as Benkei!</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> ...Ugh!</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> This is the end\u2013 Nine, ten!</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> ...Tch, I miscalculated.</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> I thought they&#39;d go running off at the end, so I split the flame in two. Thanks to that, it lost power.</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> If I&#39;d left the last flame whole, at least one of them would have been burned to a crisp.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Amazing... Ushiwakamaru jumped up on Benkei&#39;s shoulders, spun around like a top...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...split Ibaraki-Douji&#39;s flame in two, and dispersed it!</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Secret technique... Wandering Tales of Shana-oh, Fifth Act Gaiden, Sudar\u015Bana Icicle Drill...</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Do not underestimate me, you thieving oni. This is not the first time that I have crossed to the island of oni.</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> Ooh... Lord Yoshitsune... You&#39;ve used one of your precious secret techniques on someone like me\u2014</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> ...Not really. If you had fallen, I would have been incinerated next.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> To be honest, I wanted to use it in a tough spot to save my lord so I would get complimented... but there&#39;s always a next time.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> More importantly, Benkei! It&#39;s been bothering me for a while now, but you stink of alcohol! Go wash that smell off, you fool!</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> Ooh... OOOOHHHHHHH!<br> Yes, you&#39;re right, my lord!</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> There&#39;s no better way to get rid of alcohol than exercise! I shall work so much even the oni will fear me!</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Yes. That aside, you, come behind the temple later. I&#39;ll pay you back for the beating you gave me during the subscription list episode.</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> Oooh! Your grudge is so deep! You&#39;ve been holding a grudge a long time after all, Lord Yoshitsune!</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> Ibaraki, you sure made quite a scene.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> Now... If I don&#39;t get serious myself, it won&#39;t be balanced...</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Bring it on! I&#39;ve just finished warming up my engine.<br> I&#39;ll take you all down at top speed!</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Let&#39;s do this, Boss! Step on it!<br> We will end this right here!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Leave it to me! Rev that engine!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Ready to overheat!</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> All right! I&#39;m ready to blast off! Say your prayers, oni! Beg for the Buddha&#39;s mercy!</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> This golden lightning will blow you all the way to hell! It&#39;ll be more than enough to knock you sober!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Ugh... Won&#39;t these guys ever give up!?<br> They were like this back at Rashomon, and now here...</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Not only that, they&#39;ve adapted to my movements! They&#39;re not powerful, but their tactics have gotten way too complex!</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> This isn&#39;t looking good... We&#39;re being pushed back...<br> In that case, why don&#39;t I show my true nature?</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> You mustn&#39;t! I won&#39;t allow you to show your true nature in front of mere humans!</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Rather than that, I shall become a great oni once again! Shuten, hand me that cup!</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> Hmm... If you&#39;re going to go that far then I won&#39;t stop you. Here, take it...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Master, it&#39;s that wine! If Ibaraki-Douji turns into the oni she was at Rashomon once more, then...</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> I won&#39;t let you! I&#39;m splitting that cup in two, Ibaraki!</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> You can&#39;t reach it, you Ashigara monkey!<br> Did you think you were a match for me in agility?</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Just you watch! This time I&#39;ll drink down double, nay, triple the wine!</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> In the stories you humans made up, wasn&#39;t the leader of the Onigashima oni called Ura?</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> He was a great oni that measured more than four meters tall! Just watch as I grow to that same stature\u2014</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> Ibaraki! Behind you! Duck!<br> Or your head&#39;ll fly!</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> \u2013What did you say!?</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Oh dear... She dodged it.<br> That&#39;s too bad.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Y-You&#39;re the one...from before!</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> It&#39;s you!</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> ...I knew it. I thought it&#39;s about time for you to show up.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> ...I didn&#39;t think it was possible.<br> What the hell are you doing here, Boss Raikou!?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Raikou... Wait, you mean Minamoto-no-Raikou!? The one whom Kintoki served under as one of the Four Heavenly Kings!?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Then... She&#39;s actually a really beautiful woman with an amazing body! Isn&#39;t that deviating from history way too much!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I understand how you feel, Doctor, but please keep quiet! You can talk about that later!</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> That&#39;s naughty, Kintoki. Didn&#39;t I tell you before?<br> You should always watch your manners around others.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> And... \u201CWhat the hell are you doing here.\u201D How rude is that? It&#39;s almost like you&#39;re treating me as a nuisance.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> ...If...</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> If that&#39;s really how you think about your mother...<br> I am going to cry, you know?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...Mother?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I don&#39;t think it&#39;s nice to make your mother cry!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Another troubling statement!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I can hardly believe the most powerful Mystic Slayer of the Heian era, the most renowned demon-killer in all of Japan, is a woman...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...On top of that, what did she just say?<br> Kintoki, what&#39;s her relationship with you!?</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Of course she&#39;s not my real mother.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> But it&#39;s true that I&#39;m indebted to her for taking me in and raising me\u2013</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> This is what Boss Raikou was like from the beginning. She said, \u201CI will support you as a mother rather than an older sister.\u201D</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> So, well, you see,</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> I guess you could say she&#39;s like a stepmother to me, as well as my mentor...</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Oh my! ...Calling me your stepmother...<br> I don&#39;t remember raising you to be like that...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Hey, can&#39;t you see her eyes are filled with tears? Come on, Kintoki, don&#39;t you think you should say something to her?</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou...</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Well, you&#39;re not really a nuisance! Actually, I am really happy to see you after so long, Boss Raikou!</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> My, Kintoki, you sure know how to make your mother happy.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Fufufu, I am happy too. Seeing you healthy and energetic fills my heart with joy.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> \u2014Really, if there weren&#39;t any annoying insects flying around you, I&#39;d be even happier.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> Aren&#39;t you the same as ever, Raikou. Children don&#39;t like it when their mothers can&#39;t let them go, you know?</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> But that&#39;s about as far as your suffering will last.<br> It&#39;s about time for you to go...</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Shuten!</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> I have no intention of exchanging words with an insect. Begone! Begone this instant!</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> \u2013Let the slaying begin!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I-It&#39;s started!</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> We have no choice but to join in!</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Don&#39;t worry, I can promise you she&#39;s powerful. She&#39;s more powerful than a hundred, a thousand\u2013 Nah, ten thousand troops!</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> So she&#39;s Raikou... Then that explains her swordsmanship.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> To think I&#39;d be able to fight alongside not just Kintoki, but Raikou as well!</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> As another Minamoto, I cannot let myself be shamed.<br> To battle, Ushiwakamaru!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> Not good, this is getting too rough...<br> I played a little too much.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> Ibaraki, time to run.</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Guh... You say that like it&#39;s no big deal, Shuten!</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> You can&#39;t do it? Then we&#39;ll just give up. I just thought maybe my dear Ibaraki would be able to do something about this situation...</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> I-I-I-I didn&#39;t say that!<br> There&#39;s no way I would disappoint you!</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> With my skills, I can get us out of any predicament with ease! Grab on to me, Shuten!</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> Ah, thank you kindly.<br> I knew I could count on you, Ibaraki.</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Flattery will get you nowhere.<br> ...I didn&#39;t stay stop, though.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Goodness, what a tremendous leap!<br> They withdrew from the battlefield in an instant!</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> If even a single insect remains, they will breed without limit. I will go and crush them.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> What about you...?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I doubt we can catch up with them...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Sorry, but we have other things that we must do.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Just like the boss said, Boss Raikou...<br> I guess I can&#39;t call you both that, huh?</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Using \u201Cboss\u201D for both of you is just lame. It&#39;s a bit old-fashioned now, but can I call you Lord Raikou instead?</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> ...That makes me sad, but I guess it can&#39;t be helped.<br> To be honest, I really wanted you to call me \u201Cmother\u201D...</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> We&#39;ll talk about this later! We have more important things to take care of than those two!</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> ...I guess I have no choice. Then, my Kintoki, will you give your mother your support as I chase after them alone?</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> My support? Well, yeah... Huh? What the!?</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Then I will take your support\u2013as my power source. (Nuzzle)</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> D-Don&#39;t be hugging me here, Boss! They&#39;re watching me! And quit rubbing my head too! Hey!</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Quit squirming. Are you that rebellious now? ...Ahh, now I see. You&#39;re worried about what your other boss will think.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Anyone would be embarrassed at this!<br> This isn&#39;t Parents&#39; Day!</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> And aren&#39;t you forgetting something, Lord Raikou? Those two are getting away the longer you&#39;re like this!</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Oh, that&#39;s right. It is sad to part, but I must be going.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> \u2013Until we meet again, everyone.<br> Please take care of my Kintoki.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> ...Sigh. I can&#39;t believe this.<br> Even Boss Raikou has been called out to battle...</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Wait, if I&#39;ve become a Heroic Spirit, then there&#39;s no way that Lord Raikou wouldn&#39;t become one too...</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> So...that&#39;s the kind of person she was.<br> Oh, wait! I didn&#39;t mean that in a bad way!</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> It&#39;s just that she&#39;s a little different than I imagined, and I said that because I was surprised...</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Yeah, that&#39;s Boss Raikou, without a doubt.<br> That&#39;s her character, and that&#39;s the kind of person she is.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> ...And all of ya forget about what she did to me just now. You didn&#39;t see a thing. Understand?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Just now? Oh, when she hugged you and rubbed your head...</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Say that again!?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Nope, I didn&#39;t see a thing. Not a thing.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> Same here... Of course I didn&#39;t see anything.<br> All I saw was the dauntless Kintoki fighting bravely.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Shuten-Douji and Ibaraki-Douji\u2013<br> We cannot forget that those two are here on Onigashima.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> We have orders to find out who the mastermind is that created this island.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> We&#39;ll keep those two at the back of our minds while we continue to move ahead with what we must do, Master.</p><h2 id="act-11-the-third-great-oni-appears" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#act-11-the-third-great-oni-appears" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Act 11: &quot;The Third Great Oni Appears!&quot;</h2><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...This is the last gate.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> And of course, I detect a Servant here.<br> Who is that over there\u2013</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> Red... the color of passion.<br> The color of an everburning flame.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Kiyohime...

Namo...</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Now this is more like Onigashima.<br> So finally we can face the one behind all this.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Precisely. This is the climax of my lord&#39;s oni extermination. It&#39;s almost time for the conclusion.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> Uh! Look, everyone.<br> Over there...!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> In the center of that open space, something...</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> ...What a sinister cup. Hmm?<br> The one standing in front it is\u2013</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> That is Raikou. I thought she went after Shuten-Douji.<br> I wonder if she has finished them off...</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Raikou, what in the world are you...</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> ...Hold on.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Kintoki?</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Don&#39;t get too close.<br> They&#39;re different.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> ...Ahaha. Kintoki, you&#39;re finally here.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> \u2013Tch! Now I see. I should have know this was the case if Shuten was here.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Thinking &#39;bout it, I knew that selfish oni wouldn&#39;t show up here for something as trivial as fighting over a territory.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> The only opponent she couldn&#39;t ignore would be a true standout of an oni.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> You\u2013 Why?<br> Why have you returned!?</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Hehe, hehehe, hehehehehehehe! You can tell?<br> So is that the power of love!?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Wha...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Th-This evil presence...</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Raikou... What are you?</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> ...That&#39;s not Raikou. She might look the same, but her existence is completely twisted.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Isn&#39;t that right, boss of all demons?<br> Suzugamori&#39;s Ushi Gozen!</p><p><strong>Ushi Gozen:</strong><br> Hehe. Raikou and I are not so different.<br> You should know that, no?</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> No, you&#39;re wrong. You lost and were sealed away.<br> By your own hand, even.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Ushi Gozen!? I&#39;ve heard of that name before.<br> If I remember correctly, Ushi Gozen is Minamoto-no-Raikou&#39;s brother\u2013</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> A cursed child born from prayers to Gozu Tenno.<br> The story goes that ultimately Raikou eliminated him\u2013</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Yeah, that&#39;s the story. Ushi Gozen here is something similar to Lord Raikou&#39;s older brother.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> But Gozen is the title for a woman.<br> You should be able to figure the rest from that.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> ...Lord Raikou has never talked about her origins.<br> Even I had to do a little digging myself.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> I will tell you the truth. A child was born as the child of the god Tenjin. Her power was feared so much that she was seen as a cursed child, and thus sent to a temple.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> If only that was where it all ended. That child&#39;s father... Well, he probably had some regrets.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> He regretted letting go of her talents. It&#39;s predictable what would happen. He welcomed his imprisoned daughter back as his newborn son.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> You all know the rest of the story. Minamoto-no-Raikou lived up to her father&#39;s expectation, and became a warrior who protected Kyoto.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> You mean Ushi Gozen and Raikou weren&#39;t siblings, but one and the same person!? But there is a tale that Raikou exterminated Ushi Gozen!</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Right. That is actually true.<br> I know because I was there.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Just a moment ago you said...she had been sealed away.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Yes, when she became the leader of the Minamoto family, Boss Raikou tried to cut away that deranged side of her.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Well, after a lot of trouble, it ended with her sealing Ushi Gozen deep inside of herself.</p><p><strong>Ushi Gozen:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> ...Tch. That&#39;s enough.<br> I can&#39;t believe I let you see a lame side of me.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> That&#39;s Boss Raikou&#39;s story, and you ought to hear it straight from her. I shouldn&#39;t be yammering about it.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> What needs to be handled now is right here. Why?<br> Why are you here? You should&#39;ve been sealed away.</p><p><strong>Ushi Gozen:</strong><br> You want to know why your mother is here?<br> Easy. To declare \u201CI am here.\u201D</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...You&#39;re the one who made this Onigashima, aren&#39;t you?</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> Eh!</p><p><strong>Ushi Gozen:</strong><br> Yes. I, the one who acquired that cup, made it.<br> I made it to build a kingdom entirely for oni.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I said that you&#39;d need Authority like that of the gods who created this island nation, but... Now I see, if you had the power granted to the incarnation of Gozu Tenno then...</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> A kingdom of oni? That doesn&#39;t sound peaceful at all. Why would you create a demonic kingdom like that?</p><p><strong>Ushi Gozen:</strong><br> ...Hmmm, you want a reason? Well...<br> Umm... Oh, how about this?</p><p><strong>Ushi Gozen:</strong><br> What if I said it is to be a place where the uncelebrated ones, like myself, can take back their rights?</p><p><strong>Ushi Gozen:</strong><br> Even though we have lived here since ancient times, oni and spider-yokai alike are exterminated because of their strange appearance.</p><p><strong>Ushi Gozen:</strong><br> Raikou somehow thought that this was terribly cruel.</p><p><strong>Ushi Gozen:</strong><br> For that reason, she decided to create this demonic kingdom... Does that sound believable enough?</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> But Raikou exterminated all the oni on this island. Including Ibaraki-Douji and Shuten-Douji.</p><p><strong>Ushi Gozen:</strong><br> Yes, well, that&#39;s because both Raikou and I hate oni.</p><p><strong>Ushi Gozen:</strong><br> They&#39;re a workforce to create this demonic kingdom, but if I see them, I kill them. Humans are worth keeping around as food, but...</p><p><strong>Ushi Gozen:</strong><br> Oni, you see, are only ugly and have no value at all.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> ...Are you saying that your own subordinates are worthless? Even though they follow you and work for you?</p><p><strong>Ushi Gozen:</strong><br> Of course they&#39;re worthless. After all, all the oni on this island are nothing more than my own creation.</p><p><strong>Ushi Gozen:</strong><br> The ones that I happened to draw well I dubbed Onimaru, the rest are just disgusting scribbles.</p><p><strong>Ushi Gozen:</strong><br> It&#39;s difficult to observe your own incompetence. As soon as this island is completed, I plan on destroying them all completely.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> So that&#39;s what they are...<br> Damn, I completely forgot about them.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> I knew that I&#39;d seen them somewhere before... They were the drawings of oni that Lord Raikou drew for me when I was a kid...</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> Then what about Ibaraki-Douji and Shuten-Douji?<br> I know they aren&#39;t oni you made, but...</p><p><strong>Ushi Gozen:</strong><br> Oh, Shuten-Douji... That was just an insect.</p><p><strong>Ushi Gozen:</strong><br> An evil insect that tried to get close to my dear boy. It&#39;s only natural I would crush them, stomp them, and then kill them, right?</p><p><strong>Ushi Gozen:</strong><br> By the way, I beheaded Ibaraki just a moment ago, and cut open Shuten&#39;s belly. That felt good.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Tch...</p><p><strong>Ushi Gozen:</strong><br> What do you think, Kintoki?<br> This island is really quite something, isn&#39;t it?</p><p><strong>Ushi Gozen:</strong><br> You and I both are the whims of gods and men.<br> It&#39;s been difficult living in the human world, right?</p><p><strong>Ushi Gozen:</strong><br> But here on this island you need not worry about the eyes of anyone. I really didn&#39;t want to have to go to all this trouble, but...</p><p><strong>Ushi Gozen:</strong><br> If I had turned Honshu into a demon land without thinking, then I&#39;m sure you would have come to despise me, Kintoki.</p><p><strong>Ushi Gozen:</strong><br> One must do everything they can to protect their child&#39;s playground.</p><p><strong>Ushi Gozen:</strong><br> There&#39;s not much I can do about what happens on Honshu, but the least I can do is intoxicate these evil insects with evil wine so they kill each other off.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> So you&#39;re the culprit of the Rashomon incident!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...A Heroic Spirit that creates a fake Singularity with their own desire... No, as Ushi Gozen, you&#39;re just an evil spirit.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> This is a disaster of the same class as a Demon God Pillar! Kintoki! I hate to say this, but\u2014</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> ...No, I should be the one apologizing, Doc.<br> Both these times are my responsibility.</p><p><strong>Ushi Gozen:</strong><br> Kintoki? Why are you so hostile toward your mother?</p><p><strong>Ushi Gozen:</strong><br> I told you that I built this island for you, didn&#39;t I?</p><p><strong>Ushi Gozen:</strong><br> To tell the truth, ever since the main castle keep was built, I&#39;ve wanted to brag, but I can only keep this a secret so long.</p><p><strong>Ushi Gozen:</strong><br> O Four Heavenly Kings! My limbs, my armor, my pawns. Do not worry, the time has come for you all to return to your lord&#39;s place.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> Kintoki...<br> Your mother, that\u2014</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> I know. Sorry I got you worried, Kotarou, but I&#39;ll handle this. It doesn&#39;t change what I gotta do.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Isn&#39;t that right, Boss?<br> This is the climax of the oni extermination!</p><p><strong>Ushi Gozen:</strong><br> Kintoki\u2014</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> You, Ushi Gozen! I know well that you and Lord Raikou are pretty much the same.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Minamoto-no-Raikou&#39;s great feats are thanks to you, and Ushi Gozen&#39;s wicked deeds are Minamoto-no-Raikou&#39;s sins.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> ...And I got a huge debt to you that I can never repay. You raised me, so you&#39;ve got my respect.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> However... Let me say this one thing\u2013<br> You&#39;re not needed anymore!</p><p><strong>Ushi Gozen:</strong><br> What... What did you say?</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> I mean that I&#39;m not afraid of you in the least! When Boss Raikou gets seriously angry, that&#39;s a million times more frightening!</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> What are you talking about, making this island for me? It&#39;s nothing more than a place for a loner like you to hide.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Even if Raikou grew horns and became an ox god, she&#39;d never really run from anything!</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Minamoto-no-Raikou would cry, lose her nerve and throw a tantrum, but she would eventually get it together and make Kyoto her home!</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> You&#39;re nothing but a loser cow, an oni that&#39;s eating dirt! Hurry up and bring back Raikou!</p><p><strong>Ushi Gozen:</strong><br> ...All right then. I understand the image of Raikou that you hold inside yourself.</p><p><strong>Ushi Gozen:</strong><br> I thought you would understand me, since you are a fellow demigod. But if you cannot be convinced, then you are nothing more than a human.</p><p><strong>Ushi Gozen:</strong><br> Normally I would overlook such a thing... but I know that you won&#39;t allow me to just go.</p><p><strong>Ushi Gozen:</strong><br> To protect the human world means that you will only allow humans to rule it.</p><p><strong>Ushi Gozen:</strong><br> I can&#39;t tell which one of us is the oni anymore.</p><p><strong>Ushi Gozen:</strong><br> You have reached the conclusion that wiping out everyone is the only solution too, right?</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Hey! Now you&#39;ve said it, you fiend.<br> All right, Ushi Gozen.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> I&#39;m gonna thrash you good!<br> But don&#39;t get the wrong idea.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> That&#39;s not because I am the oni-slaying Kintarou, nor is it because I am Momotarou\u2013Boss&#39;s comrade.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> As a son, I must stop my mother&#39;s crazy nonsense.<br> Don&#39;t be mistaken about that.</p><p><strong>Ushi Gozen:</strong><br> Ah!</p><p><strong>Ushi Gozen:</strong><br> ...Ah, ahhh... Dear me, this is no good... Even though I am your mother. Ohhh... Deep inside me... I feel so hot... So hot!</p><p><strong>Ushi Gozen:</strong><br> I&#39;m so glad, so glad, so glad, Kintoki!<br> That truly is\u2013love!</p><p><strong>Ushi Gozen:</strong><br> With that, I can get serious! The reason being that I can completely accept your feelings\u2013</p><p><strong>Ushi Gozen:</strong><br> \u2013and therefore love you...to death!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Uh!</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> ...Here it comes!<br> An opponent that I can&#39;t defeat if I hold back.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> My lightning is Golden\u2014 But Boss Raikou&#39;s lightning is the pitch black threads from the Naraka hells!</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> I&#39;ll need to finish this before I&#39;m burned to a crisp.<br> I&#39;m counting on you, Boss Momotarou!</p><h2 id="final-act-ushi-gozen-s-true-form-decisive-battle" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#final-act-ushi-gozen-s-true-form-decisive-battle" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Final Act: &quot;Ushi Gozen&#39;s True Form&quot; [Decisive Battle]</h2><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> Ugh...

Then what you&#39;re saying is, to eliminate Ushi Gozen, we just need to...</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Yeah, you just need to knock her out.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Ushi Gozen and Boss Raikou are the same person.<br> It&#39;s impossible to separate them from the start.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> So, a long time ago, I\u2013</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> I stepped into the fight between Boss Raikou and the part she wanted to cut off, Ushi Gozen.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> ...I floored Raikou with a blow when she was trying to kill herself. I told her to stop being a dumbass.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> I even got on my knees, wept, and begged her to stop.<br> The situation back then was much worse, but...</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> In the end, it was Ushi Gozen that gave in. She jumped in front of my lightning strike and got knocked out.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Like, literally out. That Ushi Gozen side never came back.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...But what about this time? Raikou might wake up and still be Ushi Gozen, right?</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> I know. We can only wait and see what happens. Anyway, this isn&#39;t something like the luck of the draw or a random bet.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Ushi Gozen comes out when Minamoto-no-Raikou builds up too much divine energy inside.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> You saw how much energy she released, right? Going crazy like that would make even Gozu Tenno tap out...</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Ohhh... Wh-Where...<br> Where am I?</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> See. Not a single trace of oni left.<br> Hey, Boss. Wake up.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> My, if it isn&#39;t Kintoki! It&#39;s been a long time.<br> How are you doing?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> A long time?<br> Kintoki, don&#39;t tell me she&#39;s...</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> (She doesn&#39;t remember anything about being Ushi Gozen! Not a word of this to her! It&#39;ll throw her into a deep blue funk!)</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> ...Oh dear. It seems as if I&#39;ve caused you some trouble...</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Kintoki...and everyone gathered here... Though I don&#39;t remember, it is clear what the situation is from the looks of things.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> ...My weakness and my wretched nature have surely caused harm to everyone.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> I know this cannot be excused by just apologizing, but I beg of you, please forgive me.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Whoa, whoa, whoa!<br> ...Lift up your head, Lord Raikou!</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> A Japanese warrior such as myself will be left struck dumb if you do something like this! Breathe, I must breathe!</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> My, what a cute outfit you have on.<br> Might you...also be a Minamoto?</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Yes. Though for certain reasons I go by my childhood name, I am a relation of yours, Lord Raikou.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Well then... How fortunate I am to have my madness subdued by a warrior of the Minamoto family.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> ...I feel nothing but shame... As your ancestor, I should be a more shining example to you...</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> No, no. Don&#39;t say such a thing. Even if you were taken with madness, I have the deepest respect for your valor, Lord Raikou.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> I-I agree... The elegant way you carry yourself, your formal way of sitting that gives off a glowing aura...</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> I believe we all see that the Raikou from before is different from the one now...</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Oh, everyone... You are so kind to one such as myself...<br> I can see that Kintoki has been blessed with good friends.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> She&#39;s overflowing with motherly love... I can even sense it through the screen, so much so that it makes me sit up straight, you could say...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes... I wouldn&#39;t know myself, but this must be what it feels like to have a mother around...</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> I know. I guess you&#39;d call it magnanimity.<br> Lord Raikou&#39;s ability to give comfort is incredible.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> No matter how rowdy the person is, they will sit properly and listen to her talk... Well, she&#39;s like a Bodhisattva.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I see. So this is Minamoto-no-Raikou&#39;s true nature. It wasn&#39;t the power of a warrior that bound the Four Heavenly Kings, but the power of peace!</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> (No, that was definitely the power of a warrior.)</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Dear me... I am not worthy to be called a mother.<br> I&#39;m terribly sorry, Kintoki.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Don&#39;t apologize to me. I&#39;m simply the monkey in this tale. The one in the lead role this time is the boss here.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Oh, so you must be the Momotarou! And your name... You say it&#39;s Fujimaru?</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Thank you so much for taking on this much danger for another person... I really am terribly sorry for what happened.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> No trouble at all. It could happen to anyone.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> My... It could happen to anyone?<br> The same thing Kintoki said to me that day\u2014</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> You must be very kind, as well as strong. Oh, Fujimaru... Fufu. I did get your name right, yes?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Give me a hug and I&#39;ll forgive you.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> A hug? You must mean an embrace. Of course.<br> I don&#39;t mind at all.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Master? You&#39;re kidding, right? Aren&#39;t you?</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Ah...</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Well, it seems that my role here is done.<br> But I will never forget what you&#39;ve done.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> I, Minamoto-no-Raikou, as the head of the Minamoto family, and as a warrior, promise to repay the debt that I owe you.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> The next time we meet, I shall be your sword.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Feel free to use me as one of your Servants.<br> I shall obey your orders, no matter what they may be.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Okay, then how about a hug...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Master!?</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Fufu. Of course. I don&#39;t mind.<br> I&#39;ll hug you like a mother anytime you want.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> I promise to embrace you.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> She left. As another Minamoto, there are so many things that I wanted to talk about.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> ...Not like she&#39;d ever spend time with a country bumpkin such as myself anyway...</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Hmm? No need to worry about that.<br> You see, Lord Raikou actually is kinder to country folk.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> You&#39;re a Minamoto, plus you&#39;re tiny. The next time you meet, she&#39;ll spend all the time you want together.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Really? That makes me so happy!</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> (...Still, I feel she would have the same sweet smile as she drew her sword if she thought you were an insect buzzing around Kintoki...)</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> (I shall pray that I am mistaken. Namo...)</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Ah, how nice, a hug...<br> Oh, Kotarou, you too!?</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> An oni-related Heroic Spirit drawn to Onigashima...<br> I suppose I fall into that category.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> How to deal with the monster within...<br> I think I now know the answer. Well, part of it, at least.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> ...I know I wasn&#39;t a whole lot of help...<br> but thank you very much, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> I too would like to lend you a hand, so give me a shout.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> Rather than working as a ninja in a world of warriors, it was more fun playing the role of the pheasant under you.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> You see, a bird is free. It&#39;s unfortunate that I couldn&#39;t shoot light beams from my beak, but still...</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Hold on! It&#39;s too soon for you to be going back home, ninja boy. I have one final thing I want to ask you.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> You always took a real humble attitude toward me. Why did you do that? I don&#39;t ever remember deserving that.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> So, you really don&#39;t know, do you?</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> My clan&#39;s village is located on Mt. Ashigara.<br> Growing up, I heard a lot of stories about you.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> The legendary Kintarou of Mt. Ashigara...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> You&#39;re a renowned wild child that did great deeds in his hometown, then went on to have a successful career...</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Jeez! Why didn&#39;t you say that sooner!?<br> We&#39;re from the same mountain!?</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> ...I messed up... Had I known you were my kouhai,<br> I would&#39;ve tried to act cooler...</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> But I&#39;m glad to see that you&#39;ve been raised strong! And your Noble Phantasm has one hell of an awesome name!</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> Thank you. It was an honor to fight alongside you.<br> Until we meet again.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Well, that settles this abnormality.<br> It won&#39;t be long before this Onigashima disappears.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Nice work, everyone.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> All right, Senpai. Shall we return to Chaldea?<br> We&#39;re done with exterminating oni.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Oh, that&#39;s right! I think it best that I make this one final announcement.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I promise you. This is it for the oni extermination stories.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> \u2013And they lived happily ever after. The end!</p><h2 id="challenge-the-neverending-tale" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#challenge-the-neverending-tale" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Challenge: &quot;The Neverending Tale&quot;</h2><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Ummm, sorry to interrupt your \u201Chappily ever after\u201D ending... May I borrow some time from you?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Raikou! Um, weren&#39;t you just sent back!?</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Actually... Foolish me, I forgot something here.<br> So as embarrassing as it is, I came back.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Wait, you came back from the Throne of Heroes!?<br> That isn&#39;t even self-summoning, it&#39;s self-manifestation!</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Well, I hadn&#39;t actually made it all the way back, so the rest was fighting spirit. Like, \u201CEeeeyaaa\u201D\u2661</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> So you were able to hold out against a banishing with fighting spirit... Kintoki, what&#39;s going on with your mother?</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Don&#39;t ask me, Doc.<br> I can&#39;t explain it.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> When Lord Raikou makes up her mind, she just manages to slip through the cracks.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Despite her looks, she&#39;s got ten times my spirit. When it comes to forcing her way through, she&#39;ll get through, no matter who&#39;s in her way.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> She follows her own rules! Whatever the other person&#39;s circumstances are, her own circumstances are absolute...</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Like they say, an oni god can move mountains! When I think that I have inherited that blood... How promising!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Yes, indeed...</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Yes! I too am devoting myself to being able to suddenly appear if you&#39;re in dire straits, even without being summoned, Master!</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> Y-Yes... Certainly, in that way, Yoshitsune and Raikou are similar.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Although your... bodies aren&#39;t...</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> ...I see... Master, you don&#39;t know me as an adult, do you?</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Servants can&#39;t grow, so therefore don&#39;t age, but you never know. There may come a time when I do become my mature self.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Heh. Please look forward to that day, Master.</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> Uh? Oh, even if you do become mature, Yoshitsune, you will never match Raikou&#39;s majestic bosomAaaarrghh!</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Forget waiting for a beating behind a temple!<br> We&#39;ll finish this in the shade of yonder rock, Benkei.</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> Aiieeee\u2014!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...There is safety in silence...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> That aside, Raikou.<br> What is it that you forgot?</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Actually... It&#39;s the three great oni that are left on this island.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The great oni that were guarding the gate, right?<br> Senpai already disposed of them.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> No, those monsters are connected with this island.<br> As long as the island exists, they won&#39;t go away forever.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> The problem is... the more those great oni are defeated, the stronger they get.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Right about now, they&#39;re probably reviving from your slaying. And they may try to get off this island.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> They&#39;re evil oni and they&#39;ve got their eye on total destruction.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> If Onigashima ceases to exist, they&#39;ll vanish for good, but if left ignored, they could do real harm.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Wh-Why did you give them power like that!?</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Actually... I wanted to please Kintoki...</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> You know, with prey, the stronger, the better, right?<br> So, foolish me, I got a little carried away...</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Oh... Holy shit...</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> But listen, Kintoki isn&#39;t the only one here.<br> Fujimaru is here, too!</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Aren&#39;t you entrusted with restoring humanity or something like that? Then why not put your skills to the test here?</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Yes, yes, in fact, that&#39;s a great idea! Ah, despite the fact that I created them, there is no need to hold back.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> It will make a thousand... even ten thousand oni seem like millet served in a bowl.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Please enjoy slaying the great oni until Onigashima vanishes\u2661</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> What if we slack off?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> What if I said I just wanted to go home?</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Oh. In that case, I myself will become an oni. (Grin)</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Young people mustn&#39;t pick up the bad habit of laziness. Therefore, insolent children will be punished.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> This is hard on your mother, too... but naughty children require discipline.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> A sweet voice delivers harsh words!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> What&#39;s going on with Kintoki&#39;s mother!?</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Ah, sorry, Boss.<br> As I said, this is the kind of person Raikou is.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> And if you refuse, she&#39;ll cry.<br> In public or wherever, she&#39;ll bawl her eyes out.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> It&#39;s more embarrassing for anybody standing next to her. So all you can do is obey.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Awful... Oh, Kintoki, you talk about your mother like that again... when I&#39;m just thinking of all of you...</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> There, you see? ...Sheesh, the fact that she doesn&#39;t mean any harm is what makes her hard to deal with.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Well, I guess we&#39;ll just have to resign ourselves to it!<br> Besides, it&#39;ll be fun putting Raikou in our debt!</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Let&#39;s do this, Boss! We can have a chicken race to see which of us kicks more oni ass!</p>', 1710);
