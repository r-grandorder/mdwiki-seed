Penthesilea can be communicated with under ordinary circumstances, but what sanity she possesses is obliterated before Achilles.

All those who stand with her as fellow warriors are blessed with valour, as though they were led by the war god himself. The war cry of the Amazons was said to have shaken the Aechaeans to their core.</p><p>\u201CIncreased attack vs Males of Greek Mythology\u201D in practice means that, because any opponents who \u2018smell\u2019 like Achilles may in fact be Achilles, Penthesilea judges them fit for slaughter and fights all the harder.

She slashes, crushes and tears with every weapon in her arsenal, including her bare hands, before delivering a savage bite \u2013 a finishing blow worthy of a true beast.</p><p>The ultimate Anti-Achilles battle skill.</p><p>As an aside, \u201CPenthesilea\u201D, an opera by the 18th-century German playwright Heinrich von Kleist, takes inspiration from the legend of Penthesilea and Achilles. It tells of the lovestruck Achilles, who (with the intent of being captured) goes unarmed to his duel with Penthesilea, only for her to kill him in her vengeful madness. Her Amazon followers were said to have watched her crawl on all fours as she accompanied rabid dogs in savaging his body.</p><h1 id="upon-my-howl-ride-forth-ye-mighty" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#upon-my-howl-ride-forth-ye-mighty" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Upon My Howl Ride Forth Ye Mighty</h1><ul><li>Rank: B</li><li>Type: Anti-Army</li><li>Range: As far as voice is audible</li><li>Max Targets: N/A</li></ul><p>Troian Reinforce</p><p>This Noble Phantasm summons the Amazon warband that Penthesilea once led to the defence of Troy: Clonie, Polemusa, Derinoe, Evandre, Antandre, Bremusa, Hippothoe, Harmothoe, Alcibie, Derimacheia, Antibrote and Thermodosa. Each is equal to a thousand soldiers, and all twelve, themselves warriors of noble blood, swear undying loyalty to their queen. Their affinity with Penthesilea\u2019s Howl Of The War God skill is extroardinarily high, and they receive manyfold the effects it would confer upon other Amazons. They also function as relays that increase the range of the skill.</p><p>This Noble Phantasm is firmly bound to her participation in the Trojan War; Penthesilea the Berserker, who suppresses all memory of the instant she was shamed by Achilles, is fundamentally incapable of using it. It is possible that she might possess it were she to manifest in another class. If she were to use this Noble Phantasm while summoned as a Berserker, the paradox would cause her to momentarily transform into her mature self, complete with her goddess-like beauty \u2013 before the self-contradiction instantly inflicted irreparable damage to her Saint Graph.

Because of her trauma at Achilles\u2019 hands, words like \u201Cpretty\u201D and \u201Cbeautiful\u201D are particularly taboo around her.

Her fury is such that she chooses the brand of madness of her own will.</p><p>As a warrior, she fought a duel to the death with Achilles. Once the battle was decided, he stripped away her helm \u2013 and she heard the words he spoke.</p><p>And stood aghast.</p><p>\u201CImpossible\u201D, she seethed.</p><p>She had fought him as a warrior. She had never once intended to show him her face as a woman. Had he truly wagered his life in a duel between equals, had he truly weathered a battle to the death, the hero before her should have felt relief at the face of his foe. \u201CFinally, I best you\u201D, he would have said. \u201CThank the gods I survived.\u201D \u201CI pray that you stay dead.\u201D</p><p>And yet \u2013 and yet -</p><p>Just what was that Achilles uttered?</p><p>\u201CBeautiful\u201D? \u201CBeautiful\u201D, did he say?</p><p>That single whispered word was the greatest disgrace Achilles could possibly have inflicted upon her self as a warrior, and queen of the Amazons. For it was incontrovertible proof that from the beginning he had never even regarded her as a warrior.</p><p>She had seethed, boiled, raged, gone beyond rage. In the end, all that she could do was laugh. In the end, all that she could do was utter a spiteful curse.</p><p>\u201CThen I curse you, Achilles. May someone you love one day perish at the tip of your spear.\u201D</p><p>Did her words come to pass? What kind of meaning did they hold for the legend of Achilles? Such things were beyond Penthesilea\u2019s concern.</p><p>That curse will become a lynchpin.</p><p>Remember, Achilles, every time you look upon your spear. Remember the Amazon queen who fell by your hand. Remember the shame you brought upon her.</p><p>You consigned her and her dying moments to a historical footnote, indistinct from any of the thousands of other Trojans who fell on the field of battle.</p><p>And that can never, ever be forgiven.</p><p>She has sworn a vow. The shame of her defeat at Achilles\u2019 hands has been engraved on the core of her being. And so she has no choice but to face him once more at her full strength, and slay him.</p><p>If her feminine beauty is an obstacle to their duel, then she has no choice but to remake herself so that it does not show.</p><p>Hence, the Penthesilea summoned to Chaldea manifests as she was during her youth, before her beauty was fully realised. Even so, she retains her strength as a warrior. She fights now as a true queen of the Amazons, lusting so fiercely after strength and victory that she has fallen into madness - all in the belief that at the end of this road lies her final battle with her nemesis, Achilles.</p><h2 id="related-characters" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#related-characters" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Related Characters</h2><p><strong>XXXXXXXX:</strong></p><p>[Unprintable.
