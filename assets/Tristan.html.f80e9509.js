When he&#39;s sad, a sad song. He can express even the most complex of emotions with his harp.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> Aww, Bird Boy is sad again?<br> That&#39;s a switch.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Mordred!</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> Mordred, do you have any idea why Sir Tristan is so melancholy today?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> &#39;Course not.<br> ...Ehh...maaaybe...</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> If that dork, a guy so dense he could sleep through a parade, is sad...</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> It&#39;s gotta be because of our king or some girl.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> Either one of those&#39;ll set him off real fast.</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> That&#39;s true...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> He slept through a parade?</p><hr><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> Yes...</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> After a victorious expedition,<br> we returned home in triumph with our king.</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> We received a joyous reception from the citizenry.</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> But...while we were riding through the fanfare...<br> Sir Tristan was asleep on his horse.</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> Sir Lancelot obvious reprimanded him, but he may even have been sleeping through the lecture.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> Eh, looking at that guy you can&#39;t hardly tell if he&#39;s asleep or awake anyway!</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> Unless something is REALLY serious, he&#39;s always got his eyes closed. Somehow he&#39;s still aware of his surroundings, though.</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> I read somewhere that animals like bats and whales possess an ability called echolocation.</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> Perhaps Sir Tristan is like that.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That is...certainly a theory.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> Well then, he&#39;s got to be a bat! We&#39;re already not sure whether he&#39;s a bird or a human anyway!</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> Well, that is quite rude, Sir Mordred.<br> But Sir Tristan&#39;s nerves are truly mystifying.</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> He possesses sensitivity, impudence,<br> transience, and incorrigibility...</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> An animal that is tranquil, unreadable, but is said to shed tears at times...indeed, I suppose comparing him to a whale is appropriate.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> ...Sir Bedivere.<br> Sir Mordred.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> Ack!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Oh, Tristan.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> I have come, Master.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> I&#39;ve heard my name bandied about with some unkind words.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> It&#39;s those two.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Something about a bat or whale...</p><hr><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> That is...hmmm. A bat is out of the question because they are lacking in eloquence, but I suppose a whale isn&#39;t so bad.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> Eh? Seriously!?</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> See what I mean?<br> That&#39;s what this whale-man is like.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> What the heck!? Bats fly and they suck blood! They are SO much cooler than whales! They&#39;re freakin&#39; badass!</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> ...Ah, I am suddenly stricken with sadness.<br> So, a bad man is what you see as beautiful...</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> As knights, I believe we must change that perspective. The same goes for the heartless Sir Bedivere.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> Haha...my fingers are itching to play music.<br> It&#39;s been a while, but shall I play some battle songs?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> Um...it&#39;s time for my training!<br> See ya!</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> And I remembered I need to return the books I borrowed from the library.

Sir Bedivere really knows how to push my buttons...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> By the way, that harp...</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> Ah, I see you&#39;ve noticed.<br> ...I was remembering the past.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Did something sad happen?</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> How direct of you. Yes...I was remembering something very sad from very long ago.</p><hr><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> I was thinking of Iseult.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Isn&#39;t Iseult your...</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> There were, in fact, two Iseults in my lifetime.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> One was the Iseult I loved.<br> The other was the Iseult with white hands who loved me.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> ...Most people get the wrong idea about this story if I tell it.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> They think of it as a story of an immoral two-timer, figuring that makes sense for a handsome man like me.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Well...</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> It&#39;s fine.<br> No need to sugarcoat your words.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Didn&#39;t you love them both?</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> Yes.<br> And that is the problem.</p><hr><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> Ultimately, did I really love someone?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Eh...!?</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> According to legend, my falling in love was the work of a love potion.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> That mad, passionate feeling...I never once felt it with the Iseult with the white hands.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> But that was just the effects of the potion. Could it have been a mistake...a fleeting dream one night?</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> Yes. And all this seems to come from the fact that I was never loved once, not from the moment I was born.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> As I never knew love during my childhood,<br> perhaps I never learned to love others.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> Thinking on such things immediately drags me down, and the next thing I knew, I was playing this music.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> No, I don&#39;t think that is true.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Tristan, you&#39;re the sort who would never think twice about sacrificing his life for others.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> Ah, that is simply how a knight should be.</p><p>But...ah, however...</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> As Sir Bedivere mentioned,<br> maybe I do fail as a human being?</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> As a melancholy dragon who never knew love, I can&#39;t help but to think I may well end up crushed under Martha&#39;s foot!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> STOP!</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> But I&#39;m not moving.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Calm down!!!</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> I am calm.<br> My heart is beating at a normal rate.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> I can check my pulse if you would like.</p><hr><p><strong>Gawain:</strong><br> Haha, Tristan&#39;s up to his old tricks. Once he gets started on a self-loathing rant, there&#39;s really no stopping him. He&#39;ll be at this for a while.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Gawain!</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> Sir Gawain...</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> But...I&#39;m sure even you would not understand my suffering.</p><p><strong>Gawain:</strong><br> Of course I wouldn&#39;t understand. Not so much your sadness as WHY you are always getting so sad.</p><p><strong>Gawain:</strong><br> Nobody can best you when it comes to loving someone...at least that&#39;s what I think.</p><p><strong>Gawain:</strong><br> Love is a shapeless thing to begin with.<br> Even loyalty is a type of love, wouldn&#39;t you agree?</p><p><strong>Gawain:</strong><br> It has nothing to do with physical lust.<br> The intensity of passion is also meaningless.</p><p><strong>Gawain:</strong><br> For example, let&#39;s say that there is a man who was weak and mild-mannered. He then took a woman to be his wife...</p><p><strong>Gawain:</strong><br> But then, a powerful entity threatened his life, unless he would trade it for his wife. And the man, sadly, complied.</p><p><strong>Gawain:</strong><br> Would you say that he did not love his wife?</p><p><strong>Gawain:</strong><br> Who are we, who are much better able to fight such a being, to say that such a man did not love his wife?</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> Well...</p><p><strong>Gawain:</strong><br> Love is not just about not wanting to let go.<br> It&#39;s not that you don&#39;t know love...</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> I...</p><p><strong>Gawain:</strong><br> ...My apologies. I may have overstepped my bounds...<br> I got too aggressive, just as I do in battle.</p><p><strong>Gawain:</strong><br> Master. Please do not trouble yourself about Tristan&#39;s lamentations.</p><p><strong>Gawain:</strong><br> This cloud of sadness can simply be blown away by force. Working up a sweat in the simulator should distract him.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You&#39;re right.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Care to try, Tristan?</p><hr><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> ...I suppose.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> It feels a touch impulsive and perhaps even brutish, but I suppose I should try Sir Gawain&#39;s idea.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> Very well, then, Master, please give me your orders.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> In my present wavering state, it&#39;s best if I ask you to make the decisions here.</p><p><strong>Gawain:</strong><br> Then use a simulation of me for his opponent.<br> Please make him as strong as possible.</p><p><strong>Gawain:</strong><br> After all, the intention here is to distract Sir Tristan from his perpetual melancholy.</p><p><strong>Gawain:</strong><br> His opponent should be a knight with all the force and power of the sun!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> A full-power Gawain!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...I&#39;m having trauma flashbacks, too, Senpai!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> For Tristan&#39;s sake, let&#39;s give him all our support!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Good luck Tristan!</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> Yes, I am well aware of how terrifying a full-powered Sir Gawain can be.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> I shall set aside my inner anguish for now and concentrate on fighting!</p><hr><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Good work, Senpai.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...He was strong.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> What a brute. So much so that I nearly lost the melody that has been in my head this whole time.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> Fortunately, that let me concentrate on the battle.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> Still, I can hardly believe the pain that even a Servant can feel!</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> No wonder others call this a second life.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Don&#39;t get too hung up on it.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> I will try.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> I cannot forget that if I become a burden to my Master,<br> I am a failure as a knight.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> I shall set my sadness aside.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> If you want to talk...</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> Yes, I know I can come to you, Master.<br> I have no intention of keeping secrets from you.</p><hr><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> My song has a certain bounce to it now.<br> It seems tonight I will be playing a pleasant tune.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> Good night, Master.<br> May we both have pleasant dreams.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> ...I dreamt I became a bird and flew through the air.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I&#39;ve always felt that dreams of this sort are philosophical in a way.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Something about seeking freedom.<br> Or something like a bird is dreaming about you.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> But that is not possible.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> My name is Tristan. A Knight of the Round Table...<br> No, I am a Heroic Spirit. A Servant. An Archer.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I open my eyes with conviction.<br> I know Master is before me.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Master does not look bewildered.<br> [\u2642 He /\u2640\uFE0F She} looks straight at me.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> [\u2642 He /\u2640\uFE0F She} is not strict like my king,<br> but also not gentle like a saint.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I was captivated by those intensely human eyes.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Master, am I dreaming?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> In response, [\u2642 he /\u2640\uFE0F she} nodded.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> I see.<br> So we&#39;re in my dream.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> That&#39;s how this usually goes, yeah...</p><hr><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> I see.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> In brief, this is more the inside of a Servant&#39;s mental world than it is a dream.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> I had no idea that you fought for any purpose other than restoring humanity, whether in or outside Servants&#39; dreams.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> You work so much, Master.<br> So hard and so tirelessly.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Not really.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> Is that so?</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> But when you do awaken,<br> please use me as you would a manservant.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> This is actually fun.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> ...What? Your mental fortitude is enough to cause even me to open my eyes in shock.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> No...could it be that after so many harsh battles,<br> you are simply always mentally prepared for more?</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> That is impressive all on its own. I should like to be so strong, but that is a difficult thing to be...</p><hr><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> So this grassy plain is my mental world?<br> It&#39;s peaceful, but boring.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> ...No, I&#39;m being too harsh.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> If there is some entity lurking in my psyche,<br> then danger is sure to be nearby.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> We must cautious, even of something so small as a rabbit. After all, even a tiny, innocent rabbit may turn out to be the dreaded vorpal bunny.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> Its got sharp...well, it bites HARD! Even the eleventh of our number, Sir Bors, was decapitated by a single attack from the dreaded vorpal bunny.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> Under the light of the sun, Sir Gawain was forced to use all his strength to hold the rabbit down while Sir Lancelot beat it with Arondight!</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> And then Sir Mordred darted in and kicked it viciously! And Merlin just...kept talking about the king like a broken record.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> And, finally, we defeated this greatest of foes!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> That&#39;s...really a thing?</p><hr><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> My apologies, Master. I may have embellished a bit.<br> I was just trying to lighten the mood.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Keep your day job, Tristan.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> How odd...<br> Sir Bedivere always found that story hilarious.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> Could it be...that he was faking it?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I-is that so...?</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> During our next Round Table discussion,<br> I will definitely try to make Master laugh.</p><hr><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> Ah, it seems the real beast has come upon us while we were japing.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> Is that a beast within my heart,<br> or is it my malicious thoughts given form?</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> Either way, Master.<br> Let&#39;s fight together.</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> They were not so tough.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> If that is the evil that dwells in my heart,<br> it is...unimpressive.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> But I thought all would be resolved when we defeated those enemies...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> We&#39;re not waking up, though...</p><hr><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> I&#39;m terribly sorry.<br> It&#39;s almost nightfall.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> How odd for night to come even in my dreams.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> You must be tired.<br> Let&#39;s find an inn so you can rest.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> But to be honest,<br> I&#39;m not sure where we are in the first place.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> We have no choice but to wander aimlessly. Aside from the beast we encountered, we haven&#39;t come across a single living being.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Troubling.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I asked Master whether a ritual of some sort was needed to wake us up, but [\u2642 he /\u2640\uFE0F she} did not have a definitive answer.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Rather, [\u2642 he /\u2640\uFE0F she} asked if anything rang a bell to me.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I was asked, so I thought.<br> Something necessary to wake up...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I thought of two options.<br> First was suicide.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> In other words, if I slit my own throat, I would probably wake up. However, I doubt that was the answer to our troubles.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> If this was, by chance, an illusion established by the enemy, I would be a fool who abandoned my master.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> The second option: find my true enemy.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> It was hard to believe that that beast was the enemy who dwelled within my heart. There must be an entity...a source...that had given life to that beast.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> ...Hm?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Is that...a city?</p><hr><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> Let&#39;s check it out, Master. That may at least spare us having to camp outside for the night.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> It&#39;s...empty...<br> And this city is...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> A faint memory seems to be stirring...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> My instincts were screaming,<br> warning me not to set foot in this place.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> Master. Let&#39;s get out of here immediately.<br> This city is dangerous.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> But...</p><hr><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> You are right in thinking this place is deserted,<br> but that is precisely why it is so dangerous.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Isn&#39;t this Camelot?</p><hr><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> ...!!!</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> How...do you know the name of this city?<br> No, I guess it&#39;s obvious.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> We are in the Singularity...Camelot.<br> It should have been restored already...</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> ...But that person is not here!</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> Even if they were here, I would...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Choose.</p><hr><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> ...Master?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> It is surprising how much can be learned from the sound of breathing alone.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> It can tell us whether someone is calm, angry, or sad...whether they are lying, happy, or even waiting for a chance to strike and kill.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> But the breath that you, Master, just drew when you spoke, was not that of a human being.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> You are not Master.<br> If you are not Master...</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> YOU were the one who was dwelling within me!</p><p><strong>Gawain?:</strong><br> Hahaha. You, sir, get overeager and make a terrible mistake at the crucial moment.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> !?</p><p><strong>Gawain?:</strong><br> See, this is what happens when you abandon your attack to simply wait and see what happens.</p><p><strong>Gawain?:</strong><br> You wouldn&#39;t be in this mess had you already taken down the unknown entity disguised as Master.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> You are...no, not Sir Gawain.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> To take his form disgraces us all.<br> You must disappear immediately.</p><p><strong>Lancelot?:</strong><br> Ah, Sir Tristan.<br> What led you to that conclusion?</p><p><strong>Lancelot?:</strong><br> You have no basis for saying so. We are mere Servants who are not even Heroic Spirits.</p><p><strong>Lancelot?:</strong><br> We are degraded imitations that manage to establish our existence with Master acting as an anchor.</p><p><strong>Enforcement Knight?:</strong><br> ...But that is not the case for you.</p><p><strong>Enforcement Knight?:</strong><br> You are the Knight of the Round Table himself. You have sworn your loyalty to a certain individual.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> Shut up.</p><p><strong>Bedivere?:</strong><br> No, I will not.</p><p><strong>Bedivere?:</strong><br> The more you wish to silence us,<br> the more we must speak.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> ...Nnngh!</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> Do not talk of our brotherhood!<br> Do not slander our loyalty!</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> Every time you change forms, you besmirch the honor of the Knights of the Round Table!</p><p><strong>Agravain?:</strong><br> Then tell us your name.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> Tristan. Tristan of Sadness.<br> What of it?</p><p><strong>Mordred?:</strong><br> Yeah, that&#39;s right. But you&#39;re missing something, dumbass. You&#39;re a Knight of the Round Table.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> That&#39;s right. A Knight of the Round Table.<br> Though in the end, I relinquished that seat...</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> And by relinquishing that seat, you must have renewed that vow of yours. Vowed that you would offer your everything to THAT person...</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> That&#39;s...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> It was like opening up an old wound.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Every accusations they throw at me reminded me I was back in that Singularity.</p><p><strong>Enforcement Knight?:</strong><br> Why do you quarrel, sir?<br> Didn&#39;t that massacre feel good to you?</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> Quiet!</p><p><strong>Gawain?:</strong><br> \u201CNightless.\u201D</p><p><strong>Lancelot?:</strong><br> \u201CFierce.\u201D</p><p><strong>Mordred?:</strong><br> \u201CRampage.\u201D</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I&#39;m dizzy.<br> I feel like throwing up.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Don&#39;t remember...remember...

It would hardly show up as even a tiny stain on the tapestry of history.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> It&#39;s more like a little piece of lint. Even the faintest breeze would blow it off of the fabric of history.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> On the flip side...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> It means that Tristan is in the most dire of all situations because he&#39;s in a place that could disappear at any moment.</p><p><strong>Everyone:</strong><br> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Want to come with me?</p><hr><p><strong>Gawain:</strong><br> Obviously.</p><p><strong>Lancelot:</strong><br> Leave it to us, Master.</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> I&#39;ll accompany you.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> Pass. You&#39;ve got plenty of help.<br> Should be fine.</p><p><strong>Gawain:</strong><br> Mordred...I see...you&#39;re not quite in top form because you...ate something strange...</p><p><strong>Gawain:</strong><br> No matter how wild and strange of an animal you may be, you are still a member of the nobility...and so I can understand why you&#39;ve responded as you have.</p><p><strong>Lancelot:</strong><br> By God!</p><p><strong>Lancelot:</strong><br> Sir Mordred. Are you not feeling well?<br> Did you eat too much ice cream this summer?</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> Or are you still angry at Sir Tristan for accidently shooting you the other day?</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> That was an unfortunate accident. You know Tristan makes foolish mistakes like that sometimes.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> You&#39;re all wrong!<br> Shut-up, tri-fold-man!</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> And Bedivere!<br> Is THAT what happened the other day!?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> I knew something was funky when I felt like something was cutting into my back...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> So she didn&#39;t even notice...</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> (Ack, I put my foot in my mouth...!)</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> Actually, I have a bad feeling about this.</p><p><strong>Gawain:</strong><br> Hm. Sir Mordred&#39;s animalistic instinct has never led us astray...which means this will be difficult.</p><p><strong>Gawain:</strong><br> Remember how you were lucky enough to run into me while I was in terrible shape because I hadn&#39;t fully healed after Lancelot?</p><p><strong>Gawain:</strong><br> I&#39;d normally beat you without even breaking a sweat, even at night. That defeat was due entirely to my own bad luck.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...!</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> That wasn&#39;t bad luck. You&#39;re just a freakin&#39; idiot. You were the one who let the king go without even arguing the point.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> If you had two brain cells to rub together under all that muscle, I might not&#39;ve had such an easy time defeating you.</p><p><strong>Gawain:</strong><br> Oh?</p><p><strong>Gawain:</strong><br> Oh, so you say that might&#39;ve made it harder, hm?<br> Tell me this: Would you have a harder time fighting me without your head!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> U-um...excuse me...!</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> ...Calm down, Mash.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> We&#39;re not gonna fight...<br> We&#39;re all just messing around!

Okay, time to head out!</p><hr><p><strong>Gawain:</strong><br> This is...!</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Lancelot:</strong><br> Yes...it&#39;s Camelot, the holy city.<br> But it&#39;s empty.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I&#39;m not detecting any enemies nearby.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I am getting a Servant reading up ahead, though.</p><p><strong>Gawain:</strong><br> Wouldn&#39;t that be Sir Tristan?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Actually, the Spirit Origin values are fluctuating. Whatever it is, it&#39;s not stable.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Please be careful, everyone.<br> You too, Master.</p><p><strong>Lancelot:</strong><br> No point standing around.<br> Let&#39;s go see if we can talk to him.</p><p><strong>Lancelot:</strong><br> Let&#39;s go...!</p><p><strong>Gawain:</strong><br> !?</p><p><strong>Lancelot:</strong><br> Ugh...!</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> What!?</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> ...I have been waiting for you all.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Tristan...!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> This aura...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Something&#39;s...different about him.</p><hr><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> Master.<br> I...I&#39;m no longer just.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> The moment I deemed that killing innocent citizens was fine, I should have ceased to exist as a Heroic Spirit.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> The gift of Inversion is simply an excuse.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Tristan, are you saying that your memories from the Sixth Singularity have...!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> That wasn&#39;t you!</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> No, THAT was the real me!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> But you were reversed!</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> What of it if I was reversed!?</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> It was still me!</p><hr><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> I don&#39;t quite understand the situation...</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> But Sir Tristan, open your eyes. No matter how terrible your actions, there is no sin that cannot be redeemed.</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> So long as you are truly remorseful...even if you are never forgiven, you still have a chance at atonement.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> Sir Bedivere, my comrade.<br> You do not know.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> Moments ago, I experienced the reversed version of myself.</p><p><strong>Lancelot:</strong><br> ...!</p><p><strong>Gawain:</strong><br> What!?</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> I now understand why I know nothing of love.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> A monster so evil as me should never be loved.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> I should be killed.<br> Please, destroy me!</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> A fool like me deserves no more than having his comrades lop his head off.</p><p><strong>Gawain:</strong><br> That is absolute nonsense, Sir Tristan!<br> That is no reason for us to draw our swords against you!</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> Then I shall kill Master.</p><p><strong>All Three:</strong><br> !!!</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> There&#39;s no cause for surprise here.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> As I said before...

Sir Tristan, we may be at least partially the cause of your madness...</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> Honestly...</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> Master, please get behind us.<br> This...may turn into an astonishingly violent battle.</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> My Airgetl\xE1m knows no mercy.<br> I shall destroy that sinister harp&#39;s sadness at its source!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Lancelot:</strong><br> Ungh!</p><p><strong>Gawain:</strong><br> Even after the beating we&#39;ve given you, you&#39;re still standing! Where are you getting this endurance?</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> In addition to my Gift of Inversion, I have also been given the Gifts of Nightless and Rampage.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Who gave them to you!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It certainly shouldn&#39;t be the Lion King.<br> She should already have disappeared!</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> I do not know myself.<br> It must be some cruel and unfathomable being.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> But even that bit of ridiculousness made me realize something: I am truly a monster.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> And I never even realized it, all while I lamented over my own origin, crying about my own inability to understand human emotion!</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> That&#39;s why...I could never be loved.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That&#39;s not true!<br> Tristan, you&#39;re...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Mash, it&#39;s no use.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Tristan, I believe in you.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> You&#39;re wrong, Tristan.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> Then in order to prove my villainy...</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> I shall...I shall lop your head off...Master!!!</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> Tristan!!!</p><hr><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> What the hell are you whinging about, Bird Boy?</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> !?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Mordred!?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> Yo, Tristan.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> I see you did not come with the party.<br> How unlike you, wild dog that you are, to cower in fear.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> Okay, everyone, STOP CALLING ME A DOG!</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> Ugh. Fine. If I&#39;m a dog, what&#39;s that make you?<br> A little bug?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> A tiny bug buzzing about...<br> A pissant that doesn&#39;t know what love is?</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> As ever, your provocations are the most grating of insults.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> Oh, I got plenty more for you when you get back.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> You&#39;re given all those gifts, then you bitch and bitch and bitch, then fall into some desperate madness!? What a damn wimp! Pathetic!</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> What would you know?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> Hell if I know.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> But now I know the reason why I didn&#39;t tag along.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> ...?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> The real expert in self-flagellation is the damn king.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> Your quibbling and all that whining would REALLY piss her off!</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> And if SHE&#39;s going to put in an appearance, all I could do is stay the hell away, or we might all end up killing each other.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> What are you saying...<br> No...impossible...</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> It can&#39;t be!!!</p><p><strong>F\uFF1A???:</strong><br> I have come in answer to a call from afar.</p><p><strong>F\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Sir, I see you are lost.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> ...King of the sacred lance!</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> Even for you, I will not compromise!</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> Then as your king, I will have your submission,<br> even if I must beat it into you.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> I am a king, but also a member of the Knights of the Round Table.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> Should my knights disagree,<br> I am fully prepared to handle their quarrel.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> Sir Tristan, show me your bow and its infinite arrows. With my sacred lance, I shall annihilate the source of your melancholy.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> ...Very well.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> Sing, my Failnaught.<br> Sound the melody of my lament!</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> Sacred lance, removing restraints.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> Master of Chaldea, I ask of you:<br> please take temporary command.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> I need to give this thickheaded knight a moment of silence and reflection.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Of course!</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> I appreciate your willingness to help.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> ...Let&#39;s go!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Thanks!</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> No need to thank me.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> After all, this is my duty.<br> Now, let&#39;s go!</p><hr><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>B\uFF1ATristan:</strong><br> Ungh!<br> My King! You do not understand me!</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> No, it is you who does not understand yourself.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> No... It&#39;s not that you don&#39;t understand,<br> but that you refuse to.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> The light of Rhongomyniad will pierce through your blessings. And then...</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> Master will destroy your hesitation.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> Master of Chaldea.<br> Do you know of Tristan&#39;s legend?</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> While he did learn what love is, deep in his heart, he averted his gaze from it.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Tristan...</p><hr><p><strong>B\uFF1ATristan:</strong><br> I...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Love and guilt are two different things.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Didn&#39;t you want to love?</p><hr><p><strong>B\uFF1ATristan:</strong><br> !</p><p><strong>B\uFF1ATristan:</strong><br> I...I...</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> It&#39;s a black sail, Sir Tristan.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Even as my eyes grew dim from poison,<br> my hearing did not fail me.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I heard a trembling voice,<br> a whisper like one confessing their crimes.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Regret, sorrow, hatred. And yet another pure emotion remained, untainted by them.</p><p><strong>B\uFF1ATristan:</strong><br> Ah, I see. It was inevitable.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I was truly very sorry.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I must have hurt her so much...enough that it compelled her to say those words.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Iseult. My Iseult with the white hands...the one who was by my side as I died.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> As my wife, you were loyal even while I was not.<br> And now the only thing I can do is believe.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Yes. The black sail must have come.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> There was gratitude.<br> There was compassion.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> There was atonement.<br> Was there...ever love?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> My thoughts grow calmer. Is an inconstant man like me truly worthy and able to love such a good woman?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> No. I realized that at the moment of my death.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> That wild, passionate love I felt was the product of a love potion, not something within me.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> But I believed that was love. I believed it, and so continued to betray my Iseult of the white hands.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I am truly a monster that does not know love.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I was only ever loved by others,<br> never able to love another myself.</p><p><strong>B\uFF1ATristan:</strong><br> ...No. That can&#39;t be true. I remember.<br> At the time, I was thinking...</p><p><strong>B\uFF1ATristan:</strong><br> \u201CIt would be my greatest regret if I died right here...\u201D</p><p><strong>B\uFF1ATristan:</strong><br> \u201CWhile leaving the most gentle woman I know to be so lonely and sad. I want to apologize to her...to talk to her...to tell her...\u201D</p><p><strong>B\uFF1ATristan:</strong><br> \u201CAnd I want to ask her: &#39;May I love you?&#39;\u201D</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> And without having a chance to ask that myself, I made her tell me those words.</p><p><strong>B\uFF1ATristan:</strong><br> That&#39;s right...I...</p><p><strong>B\uFF1ATristan:</strong><br> I should have asked my question.<br> Even if the only answer would have been a curse or insult.</p><p><strong>B\uFF1ATristan:</strong><br> Even had it led to me losing my love,<br> I would have accepted that as just...</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> (...The evil Gift has disappeared. But...the fairy princess, my older sister...does this mean she has manifested somewhere...?)</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> Sir Tristan. I ask of you:<br> Do you still think you have never loved anyone?</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> ...No.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> What I lacked in life was not love, but courage.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> I was constantly fearful of losing love, and therefore could not allow myself to love anything.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> I loved two women. And that is fine.<br> And I will not discuss what that led to.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> Thank you, Master.<br> And my king.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> I can finally awaken from my dream.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> Gawain, Lancelot, Tristan...and...</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> You must continue to dedicate yourselves to restoring humanity. Never forget to be proud of being Knights of the Round Table!</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> Oh, good, she&#39;s gone. Okay, Tristan.<br> I&#39;m gonna give it to you straight:</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> Iseult of white hands and blondie Iseult? I&#39;m pretty sure they&#39;d have kicked a two-timing ass like you to the curb given half a chance.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> Before you died of that poison, you should&#39;ve gotten a big damn smack to the face!</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> Ha... I never imagined you of all people would be the one to point out the truth.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> It&#39;s quite vexing, so remember this one thing when we get back:</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> I shall rain limitless arrows upon your unnecessary and demeaning personal attacks!</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> Yeah, firing off a buncha arrows while running away like a bitch is pretty much the definitive Archer move.</p><p><strong>Lancelot:</strong><br> Heh. Hold it right there, Sir Mordred.<br> There&#39;s still one last thing that Sir Tristan needs to do.</p><p><strong>Lancelot:</strong><br> Yes, a very important thing.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> Huh?<br> What&#39;re you...</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> ...?</p><p><strong>Gawain:</strong><br> Haha, yes, indeed, hahaha.</p><p><strong>Gawain:</strong><br> He was beyond confused...only able to snap to his senses after our king attacked him...he even attacked us with his Gift.</p><p><strong>Lancelot:</strong><br> And even the King was so focused on lecturing Sir Tristan, she only glanced toward us at the very end.</p><p><strong>Lancelot:</strong><br> No, no...<br> It&#39;s not that that made us jealous.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> Sirs?<br> I mean, guys?</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> Are you...super pissed?</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> Well, okay, this did get out of hand enough that everyone had to get involved...</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> But at least...at least the conclusion was heartwarming, right...?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I understand how they feel...</p><hr><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> Indeed. All sins can be atoned for, Tristan.<br> Whether you will be forgiven is another matter.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> Master.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Yeah.</p><hr><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> Please...see to my funeral...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Is that another Round Table joke!?</p><hr><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> Not a joke...!</p><p><strong>All Three:</strong><br> Brace yourself!</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> Sorry I took over.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Oh, I don&#39;t mind. But do you think Tristan and the others are all right?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> What do you mean, all right?<br> They&#39;re all set to come back whenever.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Um, I mean...is anyone holding a grudge?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> Grudge? &#39;Course not.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> It&#39;d be different if we went after each other all serious and stuff.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> But they&#39;re just bickering with each other.<br> Just playing around.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Playing around?<br> Really?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> Yeah.<br> Wanna bet on it?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> By tomorrow night, the four of them will be rolling around on the floor like a bunch of morons laughing like this was the funniest damn thing ever.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> Honestly, the Knights of the Round Table are all complete nutjobs!</p>', 609);
