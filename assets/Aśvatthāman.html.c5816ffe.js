I guess being angry<br> might make fighting a little easier for me.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> In that case, it would most likely behoove you to remain angry during battle.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> That being said, if this anger is having<br> a negative affect on your mind...</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> ...then we cannot simply ignore it.<br> I suspect Master feels the same way.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Yeah... That&#39;s true.<br> I nod along in agreement.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> Anger and rage are necessary emotions for anyone.<br> We Servants are no exception.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> Indeed, I&#39;m sure that some heroes were only summoned here due to feats that were driven by righteous anger.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> However, anger also requires fuel.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> It costs both physical and mental energy to be angry.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> So it is surprisingly difficult to remain in a<br> perpetual state of either anger or grief.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> Is that not the case for you?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>I cock my head and think about Chiron&#39;s question.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>He&#39;s right. It is difficult to stay perpetually angry.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>But for some reason, I still have plenty of anger to go around.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> Hmmm.<br> What about the strain it puts on your mind?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>...I don&#39;t know.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> You don&#39;t know?</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> So you have no idea whether your anger<br> puts any strain on you whatsoever?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>I nod.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> This emotion\u2013this burning, all-consuming rage\u2013has never been a burden.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>If anything, it&#39;s only given me energy to spare.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>It keeps my mind constantly elated, to the point where I don&#39;t even realize I&#39;m tired.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> Very good. In that case...</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> I think we&#39;d better talk to Master.</p><p><strong>A\u015Bvatth\u0101man:</strong><br> So now, I need your advice!<br> What should I do? Huh?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You three make, um...quite the combination.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> Hahaha, I suppose we do.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> We may all be Archers, but we come from very different times, regions, and cultures, to say the least.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I feel like I&#39;m looking at RGB personified.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> As in red, green, and blue?<br> ...Yes, I suppose I can see that.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> I guess I must be green, Chiron blue,<br> and A\u015Bvatth\u0101man red.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> Though it&#39;s still hard to say as to whether we complement each other or not.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I see...</p><p><strong>A\u015Bvatth\u0101man:</strong><br> It&#39;s not healthy for me to always be angry all the time.<br> That makes sense.</p><p><strong>A\u015Bvatth\u0101man:</strong><br> But right now, I can&#39;t do anything unless I&#39;m angry.<br> At least, I think so.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> But, um, aren&#39;t we talking normally now, without you being angry?</p><p><strong>A\u015Bvatth\u0101man:</strong><br> I can keep it in check for a little bit.</p><p><strong>A\u015Bvatth\u0101man:</strong><br> But that&#39;s not the same thing as getting rid of it completely, right?</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> Besides, we wouldn&#39;t be here asking for help if this issue could be managed by simply having him keep it in check.</p><p><strong>A\u015Bvatth\u0101man:</strong><br> Exactly.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Do you want to keep your anger in check?</p><p><strong>A\u015Bvatth\u0101man:</strong><br> Well, I definitely want to do something about it before I end up making trouble for someone...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> So you wouldn&#39;t rather just stay the way you are?</p><p><strong>A\u015Bvatth\u0101man:</strong><br> I don&#39;t think this is a good way to be.<br> It&#39;s not natural to be angry all the time.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Maybe you should talk to P\u0101rvat\u012B.<br> She might have a good idea.</p><p><strong>A\u015Bvatth\u0101man:</strong><br> Ulp.</p><p><strong>A\u015Bvatth\u0101man:</strong><br> ...Sorry, Mash, but I&#39;d really rather not do that.</p><p><strong>A\u015Bvatth\u0101man:</strong><br> It&#39;s like, uh... How can I put this...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You don&#39;t want to ask your mom for help now that you&#39;re grown up?</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> Hahaha. That&#39;s certainly one apt way to put it.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> You don&#39;t want to worry her?</p><p><strong>A\u015Bvatth\u0101man:</strong><br> Basically.<br> Please, I&#39;m begging you here!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Keeping anger in check...<br> What about facilitated relaxation?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> You could try forest therapy to calm your mind, get a massage to relieve the tension in your muscles... I&#39;ve heard things like that can work wonders for relaxing!</p><p><strong>A\u015Bvatth\u0101man:</strong><br> I got no idea what the hell forest therapy&#39;s supposed to be... But okay, let&#39;s give &#39;em a shot!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> All right, let&#39;s do it!</p><hr><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> I think I will come with you then. What about you, Tristan? Will you be joining us as well?</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> Forest therapy... I like the sound of that.<br> I was just thinking I could use a good nap.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> No sleeping during therapy.</p><hr><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> Yes, Master.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Okay then, I&#39;ll go get the simulator ready!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Forest therapy.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> They say it&#39;s a kind of, well, therapeutic treatment that involves going into a woods to relax.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Apparently, it&#39;s all &#39;cause of things like phytoncides and air quality and a change of environment and such.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Well, if nothing else, it ought to be good for the mind.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Except...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> ...it doesn&#39;t seem to work that well in dense South American jungles.</p><p><strong>A\u015Bvatth\u0101man:</strong><br> Frick, it&#39;s hot here.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I&#39;m sorry. I think I got one of the settings wrong...</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> So much for taking a nap.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> Hehe. Now that I take a closer look, I can see there are all sorts of insects happily buzzing about the air here.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> Well, I can&#39;t actually see them, since I&#39;m too scared of bugs to open my eyes, but I can still sense them.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You&#39;re scared of bugs!?</p><hr><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> Yes. I&#39;ve always hated bugs. They just look much too much like fairies for my liking. That, and vampiric horses...</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> Oh? I&#39;ll have you know that some insects are actually very nutritious. They&#39;re essential eating when it comes to wilderness survival.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> What? You mean some people have to eat bugs to survive? I can&#39;t even imagine it... So I won&#39;t. I&#39;m just going to pretend I never heard that...</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> I see. Well, you certainly don&#39;t HAVE to eat them, especially if you have access to meat, fruit, and veggies.</p><p><strong>A\u015Bvatth\u0101man:</strong><br> Never mind that.<br> What do we do about this?</p><p><strong>A\u015Bvatth\u0101man:</strong><br> Forget about relaxing! All this heat and humidity&#39;s only cranking up my anger energy!</p><p><strong>A\u015Bvatth\u0101man:</strong><br> Good, perfect timing! Sorry guy, but like it or not, I&#39;m taking my anger out on you!</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> Here, let us help.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> A-all right! Initiating simulation battle!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>A\u015Bvatth\u0101man:</strong><br> Eat this!</p><p><strong>A\u015Bvatth\u0101man:</strong><br> Dammit. I thought that might help<br> get my anger under control...</p><p><strong>A\u015Bvatth\u0101man:</strong><br> But thanks to how damn hot these things were,<br> I&#39;m more pissed off than before!</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> I&#39;m sorry to hear that.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> In that case, I think it&#39;s time we tried some real forest therapy.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> I would appreciate that. I don&#39;t think I can<br> stand much more of this heat, either.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> R-right.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Okay, I&#39;ll make sure to set the next environment to a proper forest that you can use for therapy.</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> That&#39;s it.<br> This is just what I had in mind.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> It really is peaceful here. Forests are green,<br> and of course, I am synonymous with green.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Really? &#39;Cause when I think of green, I think of Robin Hood.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> No, it&#39;s me.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> (He really doesn&#39;t want to let this go!)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Isn&#39;t Chiron more closely associated with green?</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> ...<br> ...(Zzz).</p><p><strong>A\u015Bvatth\u0101man:</strong><br> Stop sleeping!</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> Oh, I wasn&#39;t sleeping. That&#39;s just the sound I make when I&#39;m not ready to admit defeat.</p><p><strong>A\u015Bvatth\u0101man:</strong><br> Uh...</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> When it comes to Tristan, I&#39;ve found it&#39;s best to just not think about him too hard.</p><p><strong>A\u015Bvatth\u0101man:</strong><br> ...Gotcha...</p><hr><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> All right, since there don&#39;t seem to be any Demonic Beasts nearby, let&#39;s try some deep breathing exercises to complement the forest therapy.</p><p><strong>A\u015Bvatth\u0101man:</strong><br> Got it.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> Okay everyone, line up, please.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> Now, let&#39;s take some deep breaths.<br> Inhale...</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> Exhale...</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> Inhale...</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> Exhale...</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> Inhale, then expel all of your breath at once,<br> building up power throughout your entire body...</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> And stick out your fist...</p><p><strong>A\u015Bvatth\u0101man:</strong><br> Ha!</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> Hra!</p><p><strong>A\u015Bvatth\u0101man:</strong><br> ...How&#39;s that supposed to help us relax?</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> I&#39;m sorry. Old habits.<br> All right, let&#39;s try meditation next.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You ready?</p><hr><p><strong>A\u015Bvatth\u0101man:</strong><br> Hell yeah!</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> Start by sitting down in a comfortable position,<br> then close your eyes.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> Now, look for the source of your anger.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> That statement takes me a little by surprise.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Anger... The source of my anger.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> That cowardly plot, unbefitting of warriors.<br> The enemy army that decided to carry it out.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> My pathetic self, unable to stop it.<br> My comrades, falling one after another.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> That was why I got so mad that I broke the rules<br> of warfare and massacred them during the night.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> That&#39;s not the only reason.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> That statement sends me reeling.<br> I want to jump down his throat...but I resist.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> Anger like that would never last the way yours does.<br> There must be something more to it.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You mean he&#39;s angry at something else?</p><hr><p><strong>A\u015Bvatth\u0101man:</strong><br> I...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Yeah... He&#39;s right.<br> I mean, I really was angry back then...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> But the anger I feel now is different.<br> It takes over my whole body, tormenting me.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Where does this anger come from?<br> What in the world is it?</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> That anger isn&#39;t right for you.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> If it were, you would be able to understand it.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> ...This anger isn&#39;t right.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Is it the anger I felt for being punished?<br> ...No, it&#39;s not that.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I agreed with that punishment.<br> In fact...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I remember thinking it didn&#39;t go far enough.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> That&#39;s right. I wasn&#39;t punished enough.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I&#39;ve never felt like I fully atoned for what I did. I just kept wandering around wearing myself down until the next thing I knew, I was a Heroic Spirit.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I remember thinking I was sure I was going to keep being punished.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> And yet...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> That&#39;s right.<br> Chaldea&#39;s way too good for a sinner like me.</p><p><strong>A\u015Bvatth\u0101man:</strong><br> I see it now.</p><p><strong>A\u015Bvatth\u0101man:</strong><br> I&#39;m angry at myself.</p><p><strong>A\u015Bvatth\u0101man:</strong><br> I&#39;ll never be able to atone for what I did in a paradise like this.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> ...You&#39;re wrong.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> That&#39;s it. That guilt is the indescribable<br> source of your anger.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> That rage you feel towards yourself<br> is what you need to fight!</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> Concentrate. You&#39;re a warrior, are you not?</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> Then you should be used to fighting yourself.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Yeah. I am. But...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> ...I&#39;m not at all confident I can win.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> After all, I&#39;ve been holding on to this anger for thousands of years.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> Hahahaha.<br> No need to worry about that.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> Did you forget who&#39;s there beside you?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> ...Yeah. Good point.<br> In that case...</p><p><strong>A\u015Bvatth\u0101man:</strong><br> So Master, I hate to ask you this...but would you mind giving me a hand fighting my own redemption?</p><p><strong>A\u015Bvatth\u0101man:</strong><br> Listen well, my millennia-old anger.<br> I will vanquish you in the name of duty.</p><p><strong>A\u015Bvatth\u0101man:</strong><br> I&#39;m here to help save humanity. To help set it right.<br> It&#39;s natural to be angry at any and all injustice.</p><p><strong>A\u015Bvatth\u0101man:</strong><br> But in your case...you&#39;re much too big for a simple archer like me to carry by myself.</p><p><strong>A\u015Bvatth\u0101man:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>A\u015Bvatth\u0101man:</strong><br> So it&#39;s time for us to go our separate ways,<br> even if it should cost me my life!</p><p><strong>A\u015Bvatth\u0101man:</strong><br> Here I come!!!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>A\u015Bvatth\u0101man:</strong><br> All right! We won!!!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> B-but I didn&#39;t do anything...</p><hr><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> ...I see.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> As a first-rate warrior, he must be able to simulate a battle where you were there giving him orders, Master.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> Well? Is your anger gone now?</p><p><strong>A\u015Bvatth\u0101man:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>A\u015Bvatth\u0101man:</strong><br> It&#39;s not that simple.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> Perhaps not, but you can tell your relationship to it has changed, no?</p><p><strong>A\u015Bvatth\u0101man:</strong><br> Yeah, I can.</p><p><strong>A\u015Bvatth\u0101man:</strong><br> My anger wasn&#39;t just directed at other people.<br> It was also directed at me.</p><p><strong>A\u015Bvatth\u0101man:</strong><br> And just being aware of that<br> makes a world of difference.</p><p><strong>A\u015Bvatth\u0101man:</strong><br> Thanks, Master.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Uh, you&#39;re welcome, but I really didn&#39;t do anything!</p><hr><p><strong>A\u015Bvatth\u0101man:</strong><br> Hahahaha!</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> And so\u266A<br> His Master\u266A</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> Birthed a new legend\u266A<br> By winning despite doing nothing\u266A</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> Ahh, how very jealous I am\u266A<br> Strum strum, strum strum\u266A</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Would you please stop singing that song already!?</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> I&#39;m sorry. Your bewildered face was just so amusing that I couldn&#39;t help myself.</p><p><strong>Gareth:</strong><br> That&#39;s enough, Sir Tristan!<br> Zip it!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Ugh! Stupid Tristan!</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> I see. Insults, is it?<br> Well, that&#39;s okay. They don&#39;t bother me\u266A</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> For a poet is not truly a poet\u266A<br> Unless they are also a nuisance\u266A</p><p><strong>Gareth:</strong><br> You&#39;re not even the least bit sorry, are you, Sir Tristan? I never could tell what you&#39;re thinking.</p><hr><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> How are you, A\u015Bvatth\u0101man?</p><p><strong>A\u015Bvatth\u0101man:</strong><br> You know, I&#39;m doing all right.</p><p><strong>A\u015Bvatth\u0101man:</strong><br> The time I&#39;m spending here in peace, laughing and having fun with these guys I now call my friends... That&#39;s all the atonement I need.</p><p><strong>A\u015Bvatth\u0101man:</strong><br> And it&#39;s not unpleasant for me,<br> so I&#39;m not gonna ruin the mood.</p><p><strong>A\u015Bvatth\u0101man:</strong><br> My suffering&#39;ll last as long as I live, but I&#39;ll also be able to enjoy the good things in life.</p><p><strong>A\u015Bvatth\u0101man:</strong><br> &#39;Cause they&#39;re both perfectly valid ways<br> for me to be who I am.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong><br> Wonderful.
