Because her attributes are piling up high just at the time of her setting, I can design her straightforwardly without worrying much. The large sword is a ceremonial sword she possesses as a miko, and the short ninja sword is what she uses in combat. In her Final Ascension picture, even in that sort of situation, I wonder if that is her mentality appearing when she is touching her ninja blade with her left hand. Furthermore, the sashes twining around her whole body are also her defensive armaments, her weapons and her tools, and it was supposed to be something that symbolizes \u201Cthe curse that tightens itself over her body\u201D, but um, um, no matter how you look at it, it is a HOT LIMIT; I am thankful.
