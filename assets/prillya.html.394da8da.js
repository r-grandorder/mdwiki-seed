We&#39;ve just arrived, and we know nothing about this strange world.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> We&#39;re in the same boat, since we just came from Chaldea too. Still, one thing&#39;s for sure...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> They came here from a parallel world that&#39;s different than our Earth.</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> Oh! By the way, I may not look it, but I&#39;m Japanese.<br> You have a Japan where you&#39;re from, right?</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> Fujimaru, Mash, what&#39;s your Earth like?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> We&#39;ll... We&#39;ll tell you some other time.</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> Oh, that&#39;s right. I need to hurry and go save Miyu!</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> But please! I&#39;d like to hear about it!<br> About that Chaldea place!</p><hr><p><strong>Ruby:</strong><br> Earlier when we slammed into each other, I took the liberty of analyzing you.

I just noticed a moment ago!</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> I can&#39;t install the class card, Ruby! What should I do?</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> Then Miyu can&#39;t either... Oh, I&#39;m sorry.<br> Mash was in the middle of saying something.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> No, it&#39;s all right. But a spell to let a Heroic Spirit temporarily into your body is very unusual.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> There are cases as Pseudo-Servants, but they are an exception only used during the Grand Order...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Maybe you yourself are special, Illya.<br> If Miyu uses the same kind of magecraft...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> There may be a connection to why Miyu was captured.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Wouldn&#39;t that be a possibility, Master?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Hmm...</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Master?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Isn&#39;t a Demi-Servant similar to a magical girl?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Right...

(Gulp)</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I have news for you. Please don&#39;t be alarmed, but you&#39;re\u2014You&#39;re all inside someone&#39;s Reality Marble!</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> Huh.</p><p><strong>Ruby:</strong><br> Oh my.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Umm...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> What&#39;s a Reality Marble again?</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Oh, I&#39;ve gotta explain it from there?<br> Right, I guess I do.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> A Reality Marble is one of the deepest secrets of magecraft.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Basically, it&#39;s magecraft that manifests the interior world of the caster, and paints over reality with what&#39;s inside their heart.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> It&#39;s one of the most forbidden of all techniques and just a step below True Magic. Like Unlimited Blade something-or-other.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> But of course, under normal circumstances, something that crazy could never last.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> A Reality Marble is a stain on reality. The world itself detects that foreign body, that inconsistency, and moves to fix it.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> So unfortunately, a Reality Marble usually only lasts a few minutes.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Did that make sense to you, Fujimaru?<br> And you, cute little lady?</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> Umm... so basically, this entire world is just someone&#39;s creation?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Yup. I&#39;ve never heard of a Reality Marble of this size, though.</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> ...I-I see...</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> When I jumped to this world, for an instant I saw what looked like many castles and kingdoms...</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> They were all very clearly visible, and very large.<br> And there was an area surrounded by a black wall...</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> And all of that was a single spell...<br> A world that someone made...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Yup yup. It&#39;s so satisfying to see the surprised look on your face.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Fujimaru seems to have gotten used to things lately, mostly just reacting with \u201CEh, it&#39;ll work out\u201D and the like.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> By the way... (Grin)<br> I haven&#39;t introduced myself yet, have I? (Big grin)</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I am Romani Archaman.<br> Call me Dr. Roman.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Cute little lady, what&#39;s your name? Who represents you? And what are your hobbies?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> You have a Spirit Origin like a Servant, but you&#39;re quite clearly human.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> You&#39;re not a Demi-Servant or a Pseudo-Servant.<br> And this powerful magical energy...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Could you be the owner of the Reality Marble?<br> And would you finally tell me your name?</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> N-No! I-I&#39;m just a magical girl!<br> Th-Though I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s much better!</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> Also, sorry for not introducing myself!<br> I&#39;m Illyasviel von Einzbern.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Thank you for the polite introduction!<br> Sorry for rushing you!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> But... Einzbern... Einzbern, huh...?<br> I guess that got shot down before it even started...</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> Hmm? Dr. Roman, do you know the Einzbern fam\u2013<br> I mean, do you know my mom?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> No, I&#39;ve just seen that name before.<br> But looking at you, I assume you&#39;re a different person.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Doctor, can you get us back to Chaldea?</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Yeah. If Mash is with you, it should be fine.<br> You&#39;ll be able to come back.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I hope you do ASAP. Who knows what effects that space will have on you.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Can you let Illya take refuge in Chaldea too?<br> Just temporarily?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Hmm... Sorry, but that&#39;s impossible. Given the way the Rayshift works, it just can&#39;t happen.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Only Fujimaru and Mash can come back.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> We might be able to if she were one of Fujimaru&#39;s contracted Servants...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> And, hypothetically, even if it were possible...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> That would go against our goal of guarding humanity. This is why we&#39;ve spent so much effort trying not to intervene in other eras.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> No, Doctor. Listen. She&#39;s from a parallel world, different than our own.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> And if this is all inside a Reality Marble, there should be no danger of us interfering.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Can&#39;t you ask Da Vinci for help and just\u2014</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> Mash, Mash. Um... I&#39;m fine.</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> Thank you. (Bowing)But it&#39;s okay.</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> I have to save Miyu. I can&#39;t go escape someplace safe on my own.</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> So I&#39;ll do my best, even if I&#39;m all by myself.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Illya...</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou, fou!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Kyuuuu...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Fou...</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> Awah!? What&#39;s this fluffy thing?<br> It&#39;s sooooo cute! I want to pet it! I HAVE TO PET IT.</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> ...Eep! I-I&#39;m really fine!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Fujimaru. You understand, right?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> This might be a good chance to power up Mash.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Ah, so indeed you do. Good... What?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> MG cuteness is greater than Earth&#39;s mass?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Fujimaru! I didn&#39;t know you had the same tastes as me!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Oh, no. No. All the staff are looking at me with cold eyes. Please stop, guys...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> No! I came to Chaldea to practice my Zen Buddhism!<br> I don&#39;t know anything about otaku culture!</p><hr><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> I like it! I think it&#39;s fine!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Wait, Da Vinci!? You can&#39;t just\u2013</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> I&#39;ve been listening to your conversation.<br> I&#39;ll give you all the help I can offer.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> From the values I&#39;m seeing, Mash isn&#39;t currently able to use her full power.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> I think it&#39;s because the Reality Marble is deciding that she doesn&#39;t fully meet its conditions.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> That world has its own rules, and its own unique Mystic Codes.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> A lot of good could come from adapting to it, learning from it, and putting all that into practice.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> It should be a good experience, both for Mash, and for Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Aside from rescuing this captured magical girl or whatever.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Man, you&#39;re cold... Oooohh, fine!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> We&#39;ll continue to monitor that world and the Rayshifts.<br> If it&#39;s just you two, you should be able to go back and forth. I promise that.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> So come back to Chaldea temporarily so we can regroup. That&#39;s an order.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Thank you, Doctor.</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ... (Sigh)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Master, I&#39;m staying here.<br> Someone has to protect Illya.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Even if it&#39;s difficult for me to fight magical girls, I can still fight magical creatures!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> So just come back here later, please.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Got it. I&#39;ll be back as soon as possible.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Right, Master! Thank you!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I thought you&#39;d say that.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Th-Thank you...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I-I guess you knew exactly what I was thinking...<br> Oh, d-don&#39;t laugh at me!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Doctor! The summoning circle&#39;s ready!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Okay! Leyline connection confirmed.<br> You can Rayshift anytime.</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> Fujimaru, Mash, thank you!</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> I wasn&#39;t lying when I said I&#39;d even do my best on my own.</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> But this makes me very happy!<br> This is reassuring!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I&#39;ll be back soon. You two take care.</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Welcome back, Fujimaru. Once all your gear&#39;s ready, you&#39;re going to head back out again.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> As the guy in charge, I&#39;d prefer you took a break first... But I guess that&#39;s not an option.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> At least pack some snacks for Mash and Illya.<br> Something they&#39;d enjoy eating.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Did you find the cause of our Rayshift?</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I have of course been investigating, but... well...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...To tell the truth, it may have been best that you came back alone, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Sorry. It&#39;s just that... Here. There&#39;s something I want to show you.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> This is the video of you two just before you disappeared from Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> It starts with you taking a nap here in the Command Room.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> And then Mash comes by, spots you, and tries to wake you up.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> \u201CSenpai? Oh my. You&#39;re sleeping in a place like this again?\u201D</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> \u201CSheba, Trismegistus, and the rest of the observation equipment will get upset.\u201D</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> \u201CSenpai...\u201D</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Is Mash...? What is this...?</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...We can interpret this later.<br> I&#39;ll let you judge how to deal with Mash.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Da Vinci seems to have noticed something, but when I ask her she just laughs and says, \u201CIt&#39;s still a secret\u266A\u201D</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> And there&#39;s also the matter of Illyasviel.<br> I will remind you...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> That above all else, you&#39;re a member of Chaldea, and the one Master who can bring about the preservation of humanity.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> We&#39;ll be ready to take you back any time.<br> Just don&#39;t forget about Chaldea&#39;s mission.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Be cautious in your judgments. And at times, be cold. Understand, Master Fujimaru?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...Hey, where&#39;s Da Vinci?</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> In her lab.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> She said she had something to give you, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Swing by before you go.</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> I heard it!

So we&#39;ll make them deader than dead.<br> Got it.</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> Come on, Magical Ship in a Bottle, release!</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> But... please forgive me. I didn&#39;t know how much to prepare for the ship...</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> All I managed was five dozen Dragon Tooth Warriors and a ram bearing a curse that decays the enemy&#39;s keel.</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> That&#39;s all I have on hand.<br> My apologies.</p><p><strong>Mini Jason:</strong><br> ...So you always carry all that around? How terrifying. I&#39;m curious as to what your definition of a peace-loving heart is.</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> Yes! I&#39;m not good in battle, but I&#39;ll do my best!<br> All right everyone, charge!</p><p><strong>Mini Jason:</strong><br> ...Okaaaay, so you&#39;re not listening at all, but that&#39;s awesome! My wife is the best of the best!</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> M-Master! Now there&#39;s a galley charging at us!</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> What? There&#39;s more? They don&#39;t have any intention of talking at all!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Even if we were the ones who trespassed into their territory first, they&#39;re still so aggressive!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Just hang in there, you two!</p><hr><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> I powered up with a yummy lunch, so I&#39;m fine!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Are you still alive, Fujimaru!? I know it&#39;s tough already, but now you&#39;ve got a Servant to deal with!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> We&#39;re winning, but they won&#39;t let up!<br> They&#39;re closing in on us!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Is it this kingdom&#39;s magical girl?<br> She&#39;s a very cautious and well-prepared opponent.</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> Yup, I can feel them getting closer.<br> We have Nursery&#39;s stone to thank for that.</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> Wah! That&#39;s them! That&#39;s...</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> Greetings, visitors from another world.<br> I am Medea...</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> The Magical Girl of Love and Healing, Medical\u2606Medea.<br> A pleasure to meet you.</p><p><strong>Mini Jason:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> Th-That outfit...! Ruby, is she...!</p><p><strong>Ruby:</strong><br> Yup! It&#39;s a liiittle different, but that formal-yet-naughty slit is definitely Caster!</p><p><strong>Ruby:</strong><br> Caster, the mage Servant! Illya&#39;s first real opponent!</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> Yes, that&#39;s right!</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> I&#39;m sorry about what happened!<br> I&#39;m Illya! Illyasviel!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Illya, do you know her?</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> Yes, but she may not know me...<br> Oh, but who&#39;s that handsome doll?</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> Are we acquaintances?<br> Oh my...</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> I wouldn&#39;t have been so rough if I&#39;d known. I&#39;m sorry.</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> I don&#39;t dwell on the past... So even if we were friends...</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> Why don&#39;t we forget about it and focus on the present? It&#39;s easier to forget the bad things that happened in the past, right?</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> Huh...?</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> Yes. So let&#39;s forget about our battle just now.<br> We can just chalk it up to a mistake on both sides.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...She lowered her staff... Whatever the case, I&#39;m glad the fight&#39;s over.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I think we can resolve this by talking, like magical girls are supposed to!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I&#39;m not so sure...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> If we can actually talk to her...</p><hr><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> Talking? That&#39;s a wonderful idea.</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> If you could take an opponent&#39;s life just through conversation, that&#39;s better than fighting.</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> That&#39;s how you obtained that jewel, isn&#39;t it?<br> That jewel covered in the blood of its former owner?</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> Which kingdom&#39;s magical girl did you kill?<br> I&#39;m sure it was a very difficult fight.</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> Would you tell me how you did it?<br> I&#39;d like to know... just for reference, of course.</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> Th-That&#39;s not how it happened, Medea!</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> I did end up battling a magical girl, but...</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> We didn&#39;t try to kill each other.<br> Nursery gave this to me.</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Mini Jason:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> I see. I understand. So you came from Nursery Rhyme&#39;s kingdom.</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> And now you&#39;ve come to take my jewel.<br> Hehe. How energetic and strong-minded you are!</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> As a magical girl, you&#39;re not someone I can welcome, but as a queen, you&#39;re not someone I can ignore either!</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> Am I right, Lord Jason?<br> They say they&#39;re gathering jewels.</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> I would like to praise you for your bravery and recklessness. Everyone, would you come to my castle?</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> Tell me of your travels on the way. It&#39;s been centuries since I&#39;ve been able to talk to a magical girl!</p><h2 id="_2wei-the-land-of-dragons-and-sea-iii" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_2wei-the-land-of-dragons-and-sea-iii" aria-hidden="true">#</a> 2wei! The Land of Dragons and Sea III</h2><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> This castle belongs to me and Lord Jason.<br> Please come inside.</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> (Psst... \u201CLord Jason\u201D? Does she mean that doll?)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> (I think so...)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> By the way, Medea...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Can I ask you a question?</p><hr><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> Anything you like, as long as it&#39;s something I remember. Oh, but I already know what you&#39;re going to ask.</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> You&#39;re thinking I might be Medea, the Heroic Spirit of the Princess of Colchis. Correct?</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> Well, hehe, you&#39;re wrong. It&#39;s true that I was born from Princess Medea, yes...</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> But I&#39;m not the Servant you think I am.<br> Even if she exists in your world, it&#39;s a different person.</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> I was merely modeled after Princess Medea.<br> I am but a young girl&#39;s fantasy.</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> I act like Medea, I get sad like her, laugh like her, and I live happily in the tiny world I was given.</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> The Servant System is an active summoning system, but we are passive, and born from the unconscious.</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> Our purpose was different from the start.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> A different purpose? You didn&#39;t come here because you were summoned?</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> That&#39;s right. I was wished to be this way.</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> And there is no final goal in this wish.</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> There&#39;s only a sudden end. Even if we saved the world, we weren&#39;t able to end.</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> Because as long as we were sought, the next story would soon begin.</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> But that&#39;s all in the past, now that I&#39;ve found myself here.</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> I see. I understand your situation.</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> So unlike Illya, you wandered here from a different world, did you, Fujimaru?</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> To find oneself in a strange land, and not know what to do... That helpless feeling is something I know well.</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> So I won&#39;t just turn you into a pig. To tell you the truth, that was my original intention when I invited you here.</p><p><strong>Ruby:</strong><br> Oh, I knew it. I knew this castle reeked of ash.</p><p><strong>Ruby:</strong><br> Probably has all the walls ready to scatter special caustic lime.</p><p><strong>Ruby:</strong><br> Stuff that would turn you all into little piglets.</p><p><strong>Ruby:</strong><br> As expected from a priestess from the Age of Gods, her magecraft is on a different level than ours.</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> Hyah!? Ruby, you should&#39;ve said that earlier!</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> Oh, but, but... if you&#39;re going to leave Fujimaru be, then you can do the same for me...</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> No. You&#39;re different. You&#39;re a magical girl.<br> I&#39;m very cruel to magical girls.</p><p><strong>Mini Jason:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> What? But I don&#39;t want to be betrayed anymore.<br> That girl won&#39;t betray me? I should trust your eyes?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> She&#39;s talking to Jason again...<br> We can&#39;t hear him though...</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> Very well... This is what Lord Jason says:</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> \u201CThat magical girl isn&#39;t smart enough to lie. Her heart is as free of deceit as her chest is of breasts.\u201D</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> Excuse me, but can I karate-chop him?</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> What? No! I&#39;m the only one who can have my way with Lord Jason, so please don&#39;t.</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> Anyway, Lord Jason is being gentlemanly for once.</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> He&#39;s saying to call off the sneak attack and talk with you instead.</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> Oh, uh... That&#39;s what we were planning from the start, so we can talk all you want.</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> No, I&#39;m not interested in your problems.<br> I don&#39;t care about other magical girls.</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> What I&#39;m going to offer you is a peaceful trade.</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> This island and this castle remind me of Corinth.<br> I simply want to continue my tranquil life here.</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> Whatever you do outside this land, I promise I won&#39;t interfere.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> That&#39;s fine with me. Does everyone agree?</p><hr><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> Yup, of course! If we weren&#39;t just attacked out of nowhere like that, we wouldn&#39;t have...</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> Right, Mash?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> But what about the jewel&#39;s guidance?<br> And what did you mean by \u201Ctrade\u201D?</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> I meant that, just as I won&#39;t interfere with your business, you won&#39;t interfere with mine.</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> And no, no matter how much you want it, you can&#39;t have this jewel. I&#39;ve named it the \u201CTomoi Stone.\u201D</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> This stone is what supports this oceanic kingdom, and gives me my power.</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> This world is big, but it&#39;s also tightly closed.<br> There were once many more magical girls here.</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> They all wanted a kingdom of their own, and so fought with and stole from each other.</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> I was one of those girls.</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> I am a healer. A medical magical girl.<br> I have barely any means of attacking.</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> The most I have is mental offense and divine punishment\u2013things like pig transformation, tiny world confinement, and so on.</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> The battle was very difficult. I was a relatively weak magical girl, after all.</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> Ugh... It&#39;s like hearing an amazing swimmer say,<br> \u201CBut I don&#39;t know how to fly.\u201D</p><p><strong>Mini Jason:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I&#39;m not sure, but I think Jason is saying,<br> \u201CThere&#39;s nobody as scary as you!\u201D</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> Silence, you barbarians, you who specialize in destruction! ...Speaking of which, I want to try a Buster Noble Phantasm too!</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> Ahem. Excuse me. I&#39;ll get back on topic.</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> The magical girls fought each other in pursuit of their own ideals for peace and order. It was a clash of values and worldviews.</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> I tried to run from the fierce combat, but it was impossible.</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> Each time an enemy came I would just stab, stab, and stab some more...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Medea...</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> That&#39;s awful... Medea...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Stab what now?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Master, it&#39;s probably best to ignore that.<br> Who knows when Rule Breaker might show up?</p><hr><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> Before long, this stone that appeared in my hand grew in weight and shone brighter each time I fought.</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> I can tell. This stone is the catalyst that supports this fantasy.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> What of the area outside the kingdoms&#39; jurisdiction?</p><hr><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> You must be talking about the areas where the magical girls&#39; influence doesn&#39;t reach.</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> That&#39;s the neutral zone: a buffer zone born from the balance of power that all the fighting gave rise to.</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> You cannot receive the blessings of your power there.</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> Do you understand? This jewel is the only small hope I have left.</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> Taking this from me would be equivalent to my death.</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> So the only thing I can give you is a promise to leave you alone. Illya, I won&#39;t try to steal your jewel.</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> So please leave. With that jewel you can create whatever land you want.</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> If you want something, use your stone to get it instead.<br> If you want friends, make a land of friends.</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> I&#39;m sure it&#39;ll be wonderful. A place where everyone who visits becomes your friend.</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> That isn&#39;t right.</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> I don&#39;t want more friends.<br> I want to be with one I already have.</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> We go to school together... We laugh together...</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> Sometimes we fight and go our separate ways, but even then, before long our desire to see each other again becomes too great.</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> I was able to meet someone like that, someone as important to me as myself.</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> So I don&#39;t need anything else.</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> Compared to you and your wish to just live in peace,<br> I know it&#39;s a very greedy and selfish goal, but...</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> I&#39;m sorry! Please! I came here to save my friend!</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> I&#39;m not here to steal your jewel!<br> I don&#39;t even really know what they do!</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> You know a lot about this world.<br> If you could just give us some clues...</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> ...A way to get out?</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> It may seem cruel, Illya, but you cannot leave this world now.</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> Not only can you not save your friend, there&#39;s no exit for you either. As long as you&#39;re a magical girl.</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> No, you won&#39;t even have the will to leave...<br> That&#39;s how desperate this place is.</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> In the end, you will always be a weak magic user, a weak magical girl...</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> One who could only make miracles happen for the sake of her friends.</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> So in the end, you will definitely come to rely on the power of that jewel.</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> Just like we did, burning each other to ash as we clung to that tiny hope...</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> In the end, I&#39;m going to rely on this jewel?</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> Give up on this Miyu girl. If you want to know how to make friends, I&#39;ll happily teach you.</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> That is the one thing I can do for Nursery Rhyme, the girl who gave you that jewel and disappeared.</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> Huh? Wait, what does that\u2014</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> The jewels are where our wishes dwell.<br> They are the last light that keeps us alive...</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> When Nursery Rhyme let hers go, she quickly vanished into nothingness.</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> Of course, there&#39;s no need for you to be sad.<br> That was her choice.</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> And even without waiting for her destruction...</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> That greedy Medb, Queen of the Land of Snow and Honey, would never ignore her.</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> The Land of Sweets will fall to Medb&#39;s forces sooner or later.</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> Perhaps Nursery let you escape from Medb&#39;s clutches.</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> No...</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> No... I&#39;m sorry...</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> I didn&#39;t know... I&#39;m sorry, Nursery...</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> But I...! I have to... I have to save Miyu no matter what...!</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> Oh dear. It was probably your stubbornness that drove Nursery to action.</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> Or maybe she&#39;d given up herself, and was on the verge of disappearing.</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> Even if she could not do it, she entrusted her hope to someone promising who still\u2014<br> Aargh! Geez!</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> It&#39;s so stupid! That&#39;s the problem with sugar-brained magical girls who come from fairy tales!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Medea!? What is this dangerous aura around her?</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> Half-assed hope! How many times do you have to get betrayed before they&#39;re satisfied?</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> Wake up, Lord Jason! Let me hear some of those nasty little comments you always make!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Huh? Jason changed...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> She&#39;s finally shown her true self!</p><hr><p><strong>Mini Jason:</strong><br> Ha! This is great! The type of person Medea wants to see least in the world has come to visit her.</p><p><strong>Mini Jason:</strong><br> Someone who keeps going, even towards uncertainty. Someone who tries hard, even if they don&#39;t know how.</p><p><strong>Mini Jason:</strong><br> Someone who does their best no matter how battered and bruised they get! Someone who doesn&#39;t even think about compensation!</p><p><strong>Mini Jason:</strong><br> Medea! Just like you when you were in the temple, before you joined me!</p><p><strong>Mini Jason:</strong><br> That&#39;s why you&#39;re showing your true self!</p><p><strong>Mini Jason:</strong><br> What you feel isn&#39;t anger born of hatred.<br> It&#39;s righteous rage, born of sorrow!</p><p><strong>Mini Jason:</strong><br> Don&#39;t tell me that, after all this, you&#39;re feeling sorry for yourself and wishing you&#39;d tried a little harder!</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> N-No! I wasn&#39;t... I didn&#39;t...</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> I am the Queen of the Land of Dragons and Sea!<br> A priestess of the goddess Hecate!</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> You were never able to become king, no matter what you did, so I built a kingdom for you and settled down!</p><p><strong>Mini Jason:</strong><br> Yes, that&#39;s right. That&#39;s right. You couldn&#39;t even kill yourself. So that&#39;s what&#39;s right for you.</p><p><strong>Mini Jason:</strong><br> Which means now, you must follow your own fate!</p><p><strong>Mini Jason:</strong><br> You can work, work hard, or work even harder! A magical girl is all about doing things all the way! Right?</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> Oh, um... Th-That&#39;s... That&#39;s right!<br> I&#39;ll do it! I&#39;ll get to work!</p><p><strong>Mini Jason:</strong><br> Good answer! Let&#39;s see, to start with...</p><p><strong>Mini Jason:</strong><br> The Spartoi Family&#39;s \u201CAdventure on Siren Island\u201D diorama has a long ways to go!</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> Right, Lord Jason!</p><p><strong>Mini Jason:</strong><br> Plus that 1/48th scale Argo kit and the Supermobile DX Talos are still in their boxes!</p><p><strong>Mini Jason:</strong><br> You&#39;re not going to call yourself Greece&#39;s greatest builder without completing those two, are you? Aren&#39;t you embarrassed?</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> I&#39;m sorry, Lord Jason! But I gave Talos to Europa...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> What are they talking about?</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> Huh? I&#39;m having trouble following this...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Maybe they used to be hardcore scale modelers?</p><p><strong>Mini Jason:</strong><br> The God Nipper that Hephaestus forged for you is crying!</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> Yes, Ultimate! You&#39;re right, Lord Jason!</p><hr><p><strong>Mini Jason:</strong><br> All right, you&#39;re finally fired up! It was worth making you talk to those people, even if it was a pain!</p><p><strong>Mini Jason:</strong><br> That non-aggression pact is useless now! We&#39;re dang lucky a jewel came to us before Medb arrived!</p><p><strong>Mini Jason:</strong><br> You lost the will to fight, so this is truly your last chance!</p><p><strong>Mini Jason:</strong><br> All you can do is heal? Don&#39;t be stupid, ignoramuses!<br> I think you&#39;re great!</p><p><strong>Mini Jason:</strong><br> Right, my pretty little Medea?</p><p><strong>Mini Jason:</strong><br> Show me once more how violent it is to not be able to die in battle!</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> R-Right! Thank you! I will! I will!</p><p><strong>Ruby:</strong><br> ...Um.</p><p><strong>Ruby:</strong><br> It looks like she couldn&#39;t handle her guilty conscience as a healing-type magical girl, and pushed all her will to fight onto her familiar.</p><p><strong>Ruby:</strong><br> It&#39;s common for magical girls in puberty to be dependent like that.</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> I didn&#39;t want to know that! And Medea looks like she really wants to fight!</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> Oh, Mash... Are you going to transform!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Medea won&#39;t be an easy opponent!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> If we have to, we can use the Rayshift to at least get Master out of here and\u2014Doctor?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Doctor? Doctor!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> The connection with Chaldea&#39;s been cut!?</p><hr><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> Of course it has. Don&#39;t underestimate a modeler. When I use an airbrush, I always mask things up properly.</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> I severed your link with the outside world the minute you arrived at this castle.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Ungh! I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve noticed, Master...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> But the castle&#39;s surrounded not just by humanoids, but by large creatures as well!</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> Here we go again!?</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> Aren&#39;t magical girls supposed to become friends after they talk to each other?</p><p><strong>Ruby:</strong><br> Hahaha! You&#39;re one to talk, aren&#39;t you?\u2606</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> We&#39;ll have to fight them!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I know how you feel, but don&#39;t give in!</p><hr><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> Fujimaru...<br> (That&#39;s right.

Even as words of concern spilled from your mouth, you specifically went for a head shot...</p><p><strong>Mini Jason:</strong><br> Is that you telling me you haven&#39;t given in yet, my Medea? Maybe you still have another card up your sleeve?</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> Of course! It&#39;s natural for magical girls to have two stages of transformation!</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> I don&#39;t want to, but I have no choice but to unleash my forbidden power! To be specific, I will no longer be Lily!</p><p><strong>Mini Jason:</strong><br> Hey, whoa, wait. Let&#39;s slow down.<br> If you&#39;re not going to be Lily, you&#39;re going to be THAT?</p><p><strong>Mini Jason:</strong><br> It&#39;s that form that burned down the castle in Corinth. That&#39;s bad. That&#39;s really bad! It&#39;s too monstrous!</p><p><strong>Mini Jason:</strong><br> We&#39;re having a magical girl party, so if a magical old hag appears, I&#39;ll be sued for false advertising!</p><p><strong>Mini Jason:</strong><br> And believe me, you would be the one who gets hurt if that happened!</p><p><strong>Mini Jason:</strong><br> I&#39;m telling you this for your own good. I&#39;d much rather become an indescribable pillar-like thing than have that happen! Oof!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Quiet, Lord Jason!<br> Medea is serious, Master!</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> I wouldn&#39;t get hurt at all!<br> And I won&#39;t be an \u201Cold hag\u201D 10 years from now!</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> I&#39;m sure I will be a lovely, elegant adult woman!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> A beautiful woman, yes, but elegant?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Leave her be. She&#39;ll self-destruct.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> No, let&#39;s stop her, Senpai! If she becomes any sadder, the situation will get out of control!</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> That&#39;s enough!</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> The battle ends here!</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> I just came here to save Miyu, not destroy the entire kingdom!</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> B-But a magical girl is supposed to fight!<br> And besides, my modeler soul has been ignited...</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> I&#39;ll defeat you, make a mold of you, and mass-produce it for our country&#39;s new fall lineup...</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> Please don&#39;t come up with a convoluted plan within minutes of our first encounter! Are you psycho!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Uuuuuuh-ooooohh...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Somebody finally said it...</p><hr><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> I don&#39;t understand this world, these jewels, or any of you!</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> I hate this kind of stuff! And I don&#39;t need any jewels!<br> I&#39;ll find another way!</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> That&#39;s why, Medea... I don&#39;t want to fight you!<br> I don&#39;t want to fight anymore!</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> After all, we&#39;re both magical girls!<br> Medea, I don&#39;t know why you created this land...</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> But I at least understand that you have something you hold dear! Something you&#39;ve been fighting for!</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> Illya... Um, that...is very moving, but...</p><p><strong>Mini Jason:</strong><br> Medea fights for no special reason.<br> It&#39;s not for the sake of something she \u201Cholds dear.\u201D</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> Lord Jason!?</p><p><strong>Mini Jason:</strong><br> She created this land because she felt indebted to me. And she&#39;s been protecting the jewel out of fear of other magical girls.</p><p><strong>Mini Jason:</strong><br> She made an excuse to live a quiet life because she believed that would keep her from becoming a menacing witch.</p><p><strong>Mini Jason:</strong><br> I tell you, she&#39;s frivolous about everything. The only time she gets serious is when she&#39;s building models.</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> I...admit that. But it was you, Lord Jason, who commanded me to confine myself here.</p><p><strong>Mini Jason:</strong><br> Well, of course. If you leave your own land, you&#39;ll become a witch. That&#39;s your fate.</p><p><strong>Mini Jason:</strong><br> And if you become a witch, you turn into just another Echo. That&#39;s why I advised against going to other lands.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> (Echo?)</p><p><strong>Mini Jason:</strong><br> But you don&#39;t need to worry anymore. Here, young lady. You want this, don&#39;t you? Take it.</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> A-Are you sure!? After all, without this, um, lots of things...</p><p><strong>Mini Jason:</strong><br> Spare me the details.</p><p><strong>Mini Jason:</strong><br> If we beat you, then I win.<br> But if we lose, then Medea loses... Get it?</p><p><strong>Mini Jason:</strong><br> I&#39;m twisted that way. I wouldn&#39;t give that stone away to anyone who wants it.</p><p><strong>Mini Jason:</strong><br> I will, however, push it into the hands of a noble fool who says they don&#39;t. Whether they like it or not.</p><p><strong>Mini Jason:</strong><br> That&#39;s okay with you, isn&#39;t it, Medea?<br> Either way, we&#39;d lose if we went to war against Medb.</p><p><strong>Mini Jason:</strong><br> Before that happens, it feels better to pass it all on to a fool who is a lot like you in the past.</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> I... don&#39;t mind. But are you sure about this, Lord Jason?</p><p><strong>Mini Jason:</strong><br> I&#39;m not happy, but I&#39;m used to it.<br> Fading away while indulging in past glories...</p><p><strong>Mini Jason:</strong><br> But not becoming a witch is more important than that. Even if your dreams are dashed, it&#39;s better to pass on as a girl.</p><p><strong>Mini Jason:</strong><br> Isn&#39;t that right, my Medea?</p><p><strong>Mini Jason:</strong><br> And I think of this as my life coming to a close at one final stop in an unknown land before returning to my home.</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> I understand. As it is Lord Jason&#39;s wish, I will give her the jewel.</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> However, I won&#39;t tell you anything.<br> If I talk, it will only bring back sad memories.</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> Like all of the girls I have slain, my fate will end here.</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> Medea. Um, you&#39;re going to disappear here, too?</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> Yes. But even without \u201Chope,\u201D I still have<br> \u201Clingering attachments,\u201D so it will take a while.</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> After all, I still have 287,000 plastic models to finish.</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> At three models a day, it&#39;ll take me 250 years!<br> Go, go, Medea!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I see. So Princess Medea&#39;s magecraft was what interfered with the transmissions.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> So what happened? Were you able to get any new information?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> We learned about the hidden side of Medea Lily.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes. That Medea and the Heroic Spirit Medea have separate existences, but plenty of things in common.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I think what we got a glimpse of in battle this time applies roughly to both Medeas.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> We got the jewel.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Illya obtained the second jewel.<br> But that&#39;s all.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Medea said we&#39;d better investigate the basics of this world on our own.</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Hmmm... From what I&#39;m hearing, it sounds like Princess Medea knows everything, but kept her silence.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Was that a dig against Illya, or was it out of thoughtfulness?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Either way, I&#39;m glad no one was hurt.<br> Huh? Where is Illya? I don&#39;t see her.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Illya said it was too windy here, so she went to the stern. Ruby is with her.</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> Um, Ruby...</p><p><strong>Ruby:</strong><br> Yo ho! You called?</p><p><strong>Ruby:</strong><br> What&#39;s this? You seem down in the dumps.<br> Even after a major victory of a sort.</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> That was no major victory.<br> Medea wasn&#39;t going all-out to begin with.</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> She fought because she had to, because we muscled our way into her land.</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> ...And in the end, I took that jewel away from her...</p><p><strong>Ruby:</strong><br> I think you&#39;re looking at it the wrong way.</p><p><strong>Ruby:</strong><br> Sometimes people have no use for something, but can&#39;t throw it away because that would be a waste.</p><p><strong>Ruby:</strong><br> I think that&#39;s what this jewel was to Medea.</p><p><strong>Ruby:</strong><br> She&#39;s a very powerful magical girl, you know.</p><p><strong>Ruby:</strong><br> Even without the jewel, she would&#39;ve been able to create her own land.</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> ...Yeah. But despite her power, Medea was glum and haunted by dark memories.</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> She said I wouldn&#39;t be able to escape from this world... so long as I&#39;m a magical girl.</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> I wonder if that&#39;s true...</p><p><strong>Ruby:</strong><br> Well, I can&#39;t say for sure either.<br> But what will you do if it is?</p><p><strong>Ruby:</strong><br> When you get Miyu back, want to create the Land of Squee-Squee-Hee-Hee Love or something for the two of you?</p><p><strong>Ruby:</strong><br> I&#39;ll be willing to cooperate, heeheehee!</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> Hey! What are you talking about, Ruby!? Sheesh...</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> Ahhh, I wish Chloe were here at a time like this!</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> ...This is a weird world. It&#39;s cute on the surface, but I think there&#39;s more to it.</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> We have to hurry up and find the owner of the Reality Marble. If we can do that, we should be able to find a clue as to Miyu&#39;s whereabouts.</p><h2 id="_3rei-the-land-of-dead-bookshelves-i" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_3rei-the-land-of-dead-bookshelves-i" aria-hidden="true">#</a> 3rei!!

I&#39;m not seeing any signs of life.<br> I guess the area lives up to its name.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It&#39;s so quiet. It&#39;s not like the other lands we&#39;ve been to.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It&#39;s empty, but unlike the neutral zones, there&#39;s a sternness to it.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Senpai, Illya, look. There&#39;s a huge black wall over there...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> It&#39;s gently curving into a dome.</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> That appears to be a completely different area next to the Land of Dead Bookshelves.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> It worries me that that I can&#39;t get any readings from beyond the wall.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That&#39;s strange. It feels deliberate, doesn&#39;t it?</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> Could there really be a magical girl in a place like this?</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> EEEEK!!</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> A-A ghost!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Get back!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Have you never seen a ghost-type enemy before, Illya?</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> Aah...

So what?!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> So we&#39;ll avoid combat then?<br> Roger. It doesn&#39;t seem like it wants to hurt us.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It left without doing anything.

That was scary.</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> But thanks, Mash.<br> For not hurting the ghost.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Illya...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> No, thank Senpai instead of me. Hehe.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Are you worried about that ghost?</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> Yeah.

That&#39;s a good idea. This is a tiny land, and I don&#39;t think there are any flying creatures.</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> It&#39;s okay then? Alright, off I go!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Okay. Just be careful.</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> Right!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Illya&#39;s flying is so graceful.

I didn&#39;t realize something so strange had happened.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> While it&#39;s true that my memories from the time I visited the control room up until our Rayshift jump are hazy...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I didn&#39;t really worry about it. Was I swept up in the aura of this strange world...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Or did something change within me, somehow?</p><p><strong>B\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Eeek! D-Don&#39;t pull me!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That&#39;s Illya&#39;s voice!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Senpai, enemies are coming through the walls of the buildings!

And a librarian. I&#39;m not a queen, and I haven&#39;t been a magical girl for a long time.</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> Magical girl... g-ghosts!? Ahhhh!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Will you tell us your name?</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Ghosts don&#39;t need names, do they?<br> But it would be difficult to talk without a name.

Could it be...<br> A leyline directly linked to a parallel world?</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> So that&#39;s it. She found a foothold out to the outside world.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Wait, what does that mean?<br> Don&#39;t just satisfy your own curiosity!</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> \u201CShe\u201D?

This is not the best place to talk.<br> Come to my library.</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> And undo your transformations.<br> It&#39;s better that way.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> U-Um, Illya can, but I&#39;m not a magical girl...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> But if that last fight was just an accident, I&#39;d like to say that we are not here to fight you. I&#39;ll disarm temporarily.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Is that alright, Master?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Roger that.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Okay. Come, Illya, let&#39;s accept her invitation.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Mash!

I don&#39;t own the Reality Marble.</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> Then you&#39;re already aware that this world is inside a vast Reality Marble.</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> This world was created by a single magical girl.<br> She&#39;s called the First Lady.</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> That&#39;s what the Echoes whisper to me.<br> I&#39;ve never met her myself.</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> It&#39;s said that the First Lady is in a sealed space at the center of this world, beyond the black wall.</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> No magic can destroy that black wall, and there&#39;s no way to know what&#39;s inside.</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> Wait, then what about Medb?<br> The one from the Land of Snow and Honey?</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> Medb is a magical girl. A very powerful one.<br> But she&#39;s not the First Lady.</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> Illya, right? Tell me the rest of your story.<br> Why are you so focused on Medb?</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> Don&#39;t tell me you&#39;re asking if it&#39;s okay to defeat her...</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> N-No!<br> Actually...</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> I see. A fellow magical girl was kidnapped.<br> That&#39;s a shame.</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> But that&#39;s strange. Is that possible?</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> I thought Medb wasn&#39;t interested in anything but the jewels. Did changes in the First Lady have an effect on Medb too?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I&#39;d like to ask a question too.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> You seem to know an awful lot about parallel worlds.</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> Of course I do. Part of it is my knowledge of theosophy, but...</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> We magical girls were originally invited here from many different parallel worlds.</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> We were girls who, for various reasons, couldn&#39;t be magical girls in our own worlds anymore.</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> We had no choice but to come here. We had nowhere else to go. Here, we could continue being magical girls.</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> This is, in a sense, our paradise.<br> And it&#39;s the final stop on our journey.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Then what about Illya and her friend?</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> I don&#39;t know. Why not ask the First Lady?</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> Although... This may sound cruel, but...</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> Girls who can&#39;t accept what&#39;s happened to them end up like the Echoes outside.</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> ...!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> It&#39;s a Throne of Heroic Spirits for magical girls?</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> The Throne of Heroic Spirits that&#39;s said to be a hall of records within the void? Unfortunately, it&#39;s nothing so noble and innocent as that.</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> They pathetically clung to being magical girls and fought until they ended up as mere ideas... as Echoes.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I&#39;d really rather not know this, but... there&#39;s something I have to ask.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Is it possible that I was summoned here as a magical girl too?</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> Isn&#39;t that what makes the most sense?<br> You&#39;ve got a familiar with you.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I&#39;m the familiar!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> So I really was the cause...<br> That&#39;s a big shock. How do I face Senpai...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I wouldn&#39;t mind being a Mashcot, fou!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Senpai, you stay my Mashter...!<br> I mean... no! I-I&#39;m not correcting myself!</p><hr><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> It&#39;s nothing for you to worry about, Mash Kyrielight. No...</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> The Dangerous Beast-type Magical Girl, Squishy\u2606Mash, was it?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It&#39;s Demi-Magical Girl! I mean... Demi-Servant!</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> All right. That&#39;s all I have to say.</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> Do you want the jewel?<br> Very well. It&#39;s yours. Take it.</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> I named the stone<br> \u201CVril.\u201D But that doesn&#39;t matter now.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> But...!</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> Helena, if you don&#39;t have that jewel, won&#39;t the Echoes outside attack you?</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> It doesn&#39;t matter. At some point, Medb will come.</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> I&#39;m not a magical girl anymore. Just a gravekeeper.<br> I don&#39;t care about the power of the stone.</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> But...</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> There&#39;s no need to hesitate. After all, you will eventually meet the same fate.</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> The time will come when the world will abandon you, Illya. When you lose your wish.</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> I&#39;ll tell you the most important thing.<br> It&#39;s about your friend, Miyu Edelfelt.</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> This is a guess, but I don&#39;t think it was Medb who kidnapped her. It was the First Lady.</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> I&#39;ve always assumed that she was silently monitoring this world from beyond the black wall...</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> ... by transforming her familiars to blend in with those of the other magical girls.</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> If you ask Medb, you&#39;ll get closer to the truth.<br> That is, if she allows you to survive.</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> Thank you Helena. Miyu was who I wanted to know about most!</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> But I don&#39;t need the jewel.</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> Even if you needed all the jewels to get beyond the black wall?</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> What? All of them?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> All the jewels?</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Wait. Are you saying we need to take the stones from all the magical girls, including Medb&#39;s?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> The jewels have enough power to alter the First Lady&#39;s Reality Marble?</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> Yes. The Echoes whispered to me...</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> The jewels are crystallized emotions that grant wishes. They should be able to cross the wall, and even reach the outside world.</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> But that may be part of what the First Lady wants, too. Even so, there&#39;s only one way to find out: get all the jewels.</p><p><strong>Ruby:</strong><br> See? It&#39;s just like I said.</p><p><strong>Ruby:</strong><br> Well, if my theory&#39;s right, the First Lady&#39;s familiars are capable of crossing the black wall.</p><p><strong>Ruby:</strong><br> I can&#39;t imagine her being dumb enough to let someone else take control of them, though.</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> That means the First Lady is deliberately making the magical girls fight!</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> That&#39;s awful! We have to stop her!<br> But how?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I agree. We are a part of this fight, even if we didn&#39;t intend to be...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Illya, you haven&#39;t been abandoned by the world.</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> Fujimaru...</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> Yeah...</p><hr><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> You&#39;re going to fight against the rules of this world?<br> It&#39;s useless.</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> Illya, how strong do you think your friend is?<br> She obviously hasn&#39;t been able to resist.</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> In this world, the First Lady&#39;s power is absolute.</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Helena, you aren&#39;t washed up either.</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> What are you talking about?</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> That&#39;s right! It&#39;s not over for you!<br> There are still more things you can do!</p><hr><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> Stop it! Don&#39;t insult us!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> All the grimoires on the shelves... They&#39;re shaking...</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> Do you think all these girls just accepted their fate, and didn&#39;t try to do anything?</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> But I... I can&#39;t stop here!</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> I can&#39;t just accept someone else&#39;s despair until I&#39;ve tried everything for myself!</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> Miyu... Miyu isn&#39;t weak either! She hasn&#39;t given up yet!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Helena, you...</p><hr><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You were here to bring hope to Illya.</p><hr><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> Empty consolation...just like Al.</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> What do you... What could the likes of you know about my story!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Senpai...</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> I&#39;m tired. I want this to be over!<br> Just take my jewel already!</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> Otherwise, I&#39;ll put you to sleep here! Forever!</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> Ruby!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Illya...!</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> I&#39;m sorry for transforming without asking, Mash, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> But I&#39;m a little mad right now!</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> You&#39;re about to learn that your hollow wishes are nothing but a fantasy!</p><h2 id="world-end-match-mahatma\u2640helena" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#world-end-match-mahatma\u2640helena" aria-hidden="true">#</a> World End Match: Mahatma\u2640Helena</h2><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> (Humph)</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> Helena&#39;s pouting...</p><p><strong>Ruby:</strong><br> Her cool demeanor from a moment ago has all gone to waste...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Illya was a little rough, but I think what she was trying to say got through.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> But what shall we do now?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Illya&#39;s not going to want to take the jewel from Helena and expose her to danger.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I don&#39;t know if I like that idea either.<br> You look like you want to say something, Master.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Well...why don&#39;t you come with us, Helena?</p><hr><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> That&#39;s it!

What kind of magical girl is Connacht\u2606Medb?</p><hr><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> An intense woman.<br> She&#39;s a magical girl of blazing ice.</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> Fierce and merciless. A giant mass of possessiveness. Her rigid nature is like a castle that molds her.</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> She holds the reins of all kinds of contradictions, tightly knotted together.</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> If the root of a magical girl&#39;s power lies in her strength to believe in herself, she must be the strongest one.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Does that mean...she&#39;s almost insane?</p><hr><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> Medb? Of course not. Her sanity is beyond doubt.<br> She&#39;s absolutely in her right mind.</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> Perhaps she was the only decent one among the rest of us.</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> In this warped world, she was probably the only person who managed to keep being herself till the end.</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> She had been in this world since before I arrived.<br> There was a time when we journeyed together...</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> But I put some distance between us when she became obsessed with her lust for control.</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> After that, she dialed up on her madness.<br> Or maybe I&#39;m just flattering myself thinking that.</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> Most likely, she hadn&#39;t changed.<br> Not at all.</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> Helena...</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> Medb said she was ready to accept me as a member of her invincible army.</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> That&#39;s why I mistakenly thought Miyu had been abducted by her.</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> The formation of Little Witch Codes to rebel against the First Lady&#39;s rule.

Oh?</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Fujimaru, everyone, are you guys all right!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Doctor! What a relief. I was worried for a moment.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Unfortunately, it&#39;s too soon to be relieved.<br> Chaldea has been attacked.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> What!? This can&#39;t be happening...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> It is happening. Using our Leyline connection, they sent several hostiles over!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> They sent enemies... directly to Chaldea!?</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> That&#39;s right. We were apparently hacked.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> The disconnection you experienced a short while ago was intentional.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> We barely managed to deal with the enemies that attacked us thanks to some on-call Servants, but we can&#39;t keep this up.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Fujimaru, Mash, I need you both to return immediately.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> So that means...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> That said, knowing Mash and Fujimaru,</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I&#39;m sure you two won&#39;t say yes so easily.<br> I know that.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> But I still need you to understand this is an urgent matter.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> For now, I&#39;ll cut the connection again, to prevent any effects from your side.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I will contact you again in five minutes.<br> Make a decision by then.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Senpai...</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> Oh...</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> It&#39;s snow.

Why, Ruby?

That&#39;s right, Ruby. You do have something useful to say sometimes.</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> You can trust us, Mash!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That&#39;s true. So this is what happens... when the connection with Chaldea is shut down.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Understood.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> But what should we do now, Senpai?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I think we should try to pinpoint the cause.</p><hr><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> As the longest inhabitant of this world, I agree with Fujimaru&#39;s opinion.</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> Running back to your parallel world as it is now will not fundamentally solve this issue.</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> The threat will not go away on its own.<br> This irregular state of danger will continue.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> And with Chaldea at risk, it certainly sounds like we need to resolve this.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> But are you really okay with that, Senpai? That means that we&#39;re going to continue accompanying Illya, right?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Well, I mean, I&#39;m not complaining at all!<br> I am also happy to help you, Illya.</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> I...

You&#39;ll end up in trouble if you run out of magical energy at a critical moment!</p><p><strong>Ruby:</strong><br> She may not look it, but Illya is familiar with an efficient technique to charge magical energy.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Really? That&#39;s our magical girl!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Please teach me, Illya. If it will help us augment our strength, I&#39;m willing to learn anything!</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> U-Um... (Whisper)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Okay... O...

Lightly open your mouth!</p><p><strong>Ruby:</strong><br> Don&#39;t worry, this is a type of medical procedure!<br> It is appropriate for any age!</p><p><strong>Ruby:</strong><br> Here you go, kiss! Kiss!<br> Come on, do it!</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> What is this?</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> Hey, Ruby! This is awkward enough without you butting in!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> So you&#39;ll do it when the time is right?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> S-Senpai... This is... out of my... control...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> But I... I&#39;m okay, so...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Charge magical energy.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Don&#39;t charge magical energy.</p><hr><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> Oh, a transmission.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> All right, let me hear your decision.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> What&#39;s going on there?

They were making a big deal discussing a primitive way to charge magical energy.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Hm? A magical energy recharge method with the contractor?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> The contract made between Mash and Fujimaru was an irregular case, but...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> As always, no special ceremony should be necessary. If you consume an extreme amount of magical energy, just use a Command Spell.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> But don&#39;t we have something much more crucial to discuss right now?

The Land of Snow and Honey III</h2><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> Dr. Romani looked disappointed.</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> This is all our fault. I&#39;m sorry.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> No, there&#39;s no need for you to be sorry. Romani Archaman is Chaldea&#39;s current commander in charge.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> If he felt there was real danger, he would have forced us to transport back.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> He didn&#39;t do that, which means the doctor understands how important this matter is as well.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Yep.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> If anything, he was just sulking.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes. He&#39;s been left out in the cold more than ever this time, so let&#39;s thank him again when we get back.</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> (That&#39;s what she says, but Mash looks like she&#39;s sulking a little too.)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Anyway, until the next planned contact, we will have no method of communicating with Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Since we&#39;ve chosen to accompany Illya, we must now be even more on our guard.</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> How long do you two plan on staying upset?<br> We&#39;re almost near the border.</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> (She&#39;s sure straightforward!!)</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> Fujimaru, the same goes for you.<br> If you&#39;re a Master, then get a grip.</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> Even if you guys are acting out a magical girl fantasy, that doesn&#39;t mean your heart has turned into a familiar.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> We&#39;re here!</p><hr><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> This is Medb&#39;s kingdom?</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> It&#39;s not as cold as it looks, but it still seems like a magical land.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> If the situation was different, this would be some very beautiful scenery.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> No, wait a minute! We were supposed to be heading towards the Land of Sweets!</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> Th-That&#39;s right!<br> What happened?</p><p><strong>Mini C\xFA:</strong><br> Try using your brain for once. It&#39;s simple. This place just became a part of the Land of Snow and Honey.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...What!?</p><p><strong>Mini C\xFA:</strong><br> The transfer of territory. Reallocation of resources. Nothing new. But I&#39;ve had enough of the cutesy names, though.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Medb&#39;s familiar!</p><hr><p><strong>Mini C\xFA:</strong><br> And now my job as a gatekeeper covers a huge area.</p><p><strong>Mini C\xFA:</strong><br> Medb isn&#39;t home. I&#39;m the only one who will be tearing you apart. Be thankful.</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> The power of that familiar is overwhelming! He&#39;s a familiar, but he can summon magical creatures.</p><p><strong>Mini C\xFA:</strong><br> Oh. I thought something smelled dingy. It&#39;s Helena.<br> Got bored of counting the bookworms in the library?</p><p><strong>Mini C\xFA:</strong><br> Then we gotta pick up our game. According to Medb, she says it&#39;s the first step in molding her army.</p><p><strong>Mini C\xFA:</strong><br> Can&#39;t stop what&#39;s already started.<br> We want no regrets.</p><p><strong>Mini C\xFA:</strong><br> So I can&#39;t have you interfering at this point.</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> I don&#39;t think Medb is a woman who&#39;ll falter from the likes of us.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Are you the ones who sent soldiers into Chaldea?</p><hr><p><strong>Mini C\xFA:</strong><br> O-ho. So Medb finally reached it.</p><p><strong>Mini C\xFA:</strong><br> I see.</p><p><strong>Mini C\xFA:</strong><br> Then there&#39;s no need to steal the powers of the First Lady. Medb will do as much as she can in her own way.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> If we&#39;re already inside enemy territory... Does that mean?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes, Senpai. Queen Medb said it during the battle.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> There&#39;s a possibility my attacks won&#39;t work again!</p><p><strong>Mini C\xFA:</strong><br> That&#39;s right. Your powers will be halved.<br> No hard feelings.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Urg. Even still, there&#39;s something I can do!</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> Oh no, Mash... I&#39;ll just have to fight harder!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> (Panting)</p><p><strong>Mini C\xFA:</strong><br> Whoa, you guys are pretty good.<br> Nice teamwork.</p><p><strong>Mini C\xFA:</strong><br> You guys must be starting to synchronize after a few battles. The Shielder is a bit annoying too.</p><p><strong>Mini C\xFA:</strong><br> I guess I should take one down.<br> Which means...</p><p><strong>Mini C\xFA:</strong><br> Time to use this!<br> Gentle Bite Coinchenn!</p><p><strong>Mini C\xFA:</strong><br> No hard feelings, little girl.<br> Medb wanted you for her army.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> This familiar can even use a Noble Phantasm!?</p><p><strong>Mini C\xFA:</strong><br> Yeah. Sorry, but I&#39;m a thousand times stronger than I look. No need to brace yourself. You&#39;ll die instantly.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> She wants Illya?</p><p><strong>Mini C\xFA:</strong><br> Yeah. Seems she&#39;d make the perfect vessel for her wishes.</p><p><strong>Mini C\xFA:</strong><br> The more you desire, the more thirsty you become.<br> That&#39;s greed. Now, sorry, but...</p><hr><p><strong>Mini C\xFA:</strong><br> I&#39;m takin&#39; you out.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Urg!</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> Mash!<br> You protected us again...!</p><p><strong>Ruby:</strong><br> Oh? Illya, look over there!</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> Ruby, we don&#39;t have time for... Hmm?</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Illya! Ruby! I&#39;m sorry I&#39;m late!</p><p><strong>Ruby:</strong><br> Yahoo! You&#39;re safe, Sapphire!\u2606</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> Sapphire!? It&#39;s just you!?<br> Oh, this is Miyu&#39;s stick, everyone!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> But where&#39;s Miyu?</p><hr><p><strong>Ruby:</strong><br> Good timing, Sapphire! Make a temporary contract with Mash over there!</p><p><strong>Sapphire:</strong><br> She must be Illya&#39;s ally. Understood.</p><p><strong>Sapphire:</strong><br> Please excuse me.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> My! I feel kind of strange.</p><p><strong>Mini C\xFA:</strong><br> Hm. You&#39;ve become a lot like a magical girl all of a sudden.</p><p><strong>Mini C\xFA:</strong><br> That means my fun ends here.<br> I guess I&#39;ll retreat.</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> You do that, C\xFA. And go tell Medb...</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> That Illya already has two of the jewels.</p><p><strong>Mini C\xFA:</strong><br> Yeah, I could tell by the smell.<br> There&#39;s one in your pocket too.</p><p><strong>Mini C\xFA:</strong><br> Got it. Sounds like a sweet situation Medb would be happy about.</p><p><strong>Sapphire:</strong><br> First, please see this. It&#39;s a message from Miyu.</p><p><strong>Miyu:</strong><br> (Panting)</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> Miyu!</p><p><strong>Ruby:</strong><br> Ohh! (Sob) Miyu, what a humiliating position you are in!</p><p><strong>Ruby:</strong><br> However, this bondage thing is somewhat sexy, like...<br> Ack! Ow, ow, ow, I give up! I give up!</p><p><strong>Miyu:</strong><br> Illya. Or to anyone who knows of Illya.</p><p><strong>Miyu:</strong><br> I am Miyu... Edelfelt.<br> I am a m-magical girl...</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> (I guess Miyu is a little embarrassed too.)</p><p><strong>Miyu:</strong><br> I came to this world with Illya.</p><p><strong>Miyu:</strong><br> I am a prisoner of the First Lady.<br> It was she who created this Reality Marble.</p><p><strong>Miyu:</strong><br> Inside the black wall, located in the center of the Reality Marble, is the First Lady&#39;s castle.</p><p><strong>Miyu:</strong><br> Only one of her familiars can pass through the black wall.</p><p><strong>Miyu:</strong><br> Medb, the woman who attacked me and Illya, was also unable to penetrate the wall.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Queen Medb was eyeing Miyu from the beginning, too.</p><p><strong>Miyu:</strong><br> The First Lady is probably the reason why we&#39;ve been lured into this world.</p><p><strong>Miyu:</strong><br> She seems to have found technology that could interfere with parallel universes.</p><p><strong>Miyu:</strong><br> I don&#39;t think it&#39;s for a peaceful purpose.<br> There must be a connection with why I&#39;m held captive.</p><p><strong>Miyu:</strong><br> We must do something. We must stop her plan.</p><p><strong>Miyu:</strong><br> This castle is like a labyrinth of mirrors.<br> The familiars have established a solid defense as well.</p><p><strong>Miyu:</strong><br> Still, I believe Sapphire will be able to escape and guide you here.</p><p><strong>Miyu:</strong><br> But... if... it&#39;s you, Illya...</p><p><strong>Miyu:</strong><br> Illya, you musn&#39;t come. Find someone to help you.<br> Have them come instead.</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> What!? What are you saying, Miyu!?<br> Why do you always...</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> Now, now. It&#39;s just a recording.<br> Calm down.</p><p><strong>Miyu:</strong><br> The patrolling familiar is back!</p><p><strong>Miyu:</strong><br> Sapphire, go now! And please be safe!</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> ... (Gloomy)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Oh no, Illya is extremely depressed...</p><p><strong>Sapphire:</strong><br> Illya. Miyu is waiting for you.</p><p><strong>Sapphire:</strong><br> Please don&#39;t be upset. I shall help as well.</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> Yeah, you&#39;re right. Thank you, Sapphire.<br> I&#39;m glad to see you again safe and sound.</p><p><strong>Sapphire:</strong><br> Yes. I should be with Miyu at all times, yet I returned alone. I truly regret this!</p><p><strong>Sapphire:</strong><br> And the ones from Chaldea. I don&#39;t know how to thank you for protecting Illya.</p><p><strong>Sapphire:</strong><br> Please, I beg you... Save Miyu!</p><p><strong>Ruby:</strong><br> According to Sapphire, who sneaked inside the castle...</p><p><strong>Ruby:</strong><br> Even though Sapphire is away from Miyu, Miyu&#39;s transformation never lifted.</p><p><strong>Ruby:</strong><br> The First Lady must have special powers over magical girls.</p><p><strong>Ruby:</strong><br> This is dangerous! I am worried about Miyu too!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> We can&#39;t overlook the First Lady&#39;s plan.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes. Let&#39;s all go rescue Sapphire&#39;s Master, Illya&#39;s friend!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> So the rival friend is the cool type, huh?</p><p><strong>Ruby:</strong><br> You sure know your magical girl stuff! With a clumsy and cute character, a cool and refined one is always needed!</p><p><strong>Ruby:</strong><br> But with a secret fetish that&#39;s kept hidden underneath...</p><p><strong>Sapphire:</strong><br> Sister. No further.</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> Wait, what are you talking about?</p><hr><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> But... Hey, Sapphire... Why did Miyu say something like that?</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> That I shouldn&#39;t come...</p><p><strong>Sapphire:</strong><br> I do not know either.</p><p><strong>Sapphire:</strong><br> However, it seems that Miyu noticed something regarding the First Lady&#39;s true identity.</p><p><strong>Sapphire:</strong><br> That was probably why she worried for you, Illya.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The First Lady&#39;s true identity?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Do you know anything about it, Helena?</p><hr><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> ...We&#39;ve made a few guesses.</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> The First Lady... The owner of this entire magical girl Reality Marble.</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> She is said to be the very first magical girl.</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> Just as the King of Heroes originates the existences of the many other heroes who illuminate human history...</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> ...so too was there someone who first defined the concept of \u201Cmagical girl.\u201D</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> I have spoken with Medb about such things in the past.</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> Huh? Do you know, Ruby?</p><p><strong>Ruby:</strong><br> Uhhhhh... I just know that this is a dangerous topic!</p><p><strong>Ruby:</strong><br> By that logic, we are just imitations that have been continuously copied...</p><p><strong>Ruby:</strong><br> ...so we would be at a great disadvantage in magecraft and the like!</p><p><strong>Ruby:</strong><br> Hehehehe, Ruby is getting fired up!</p><p><strong>Sapphire:</strong><br> That&#39;s my sister.</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> Haha. That&#39;s heartening, but I&#39;m still worried.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> However...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Is that the real reason Miyu tried to keep Illya away?</p><h2 id="_4ier-the-land-of-snow-and-honey-iv" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_4ier-the-land-of-snow-and-honey-iv" aria-hidden="true">#</a> 4ier!!!

I&#39;ve been waiting, Illya.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> And the Chaldea Master and Servant, too.<br> That&#39;s you, right?</p><p><strong>Mini C\xFA:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> It was only for a moment, but I took a peek inside your world through the familiar I sent.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> It was so boring! So boring!<br> Such a stupid world!</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Why not forget that world and come join me?</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Or are you that stupid as well? Do you want to die drunk on your own self-satisfaction?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Mash, calm down.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> But...</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Heheh.

You&#39;re arrogant enough to think you can save the world all by yourselves.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> You just want an excuse. You just want to say that you tried to fight back. You&#39;ll never really rule your own fate.</p><hr><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> It&#39;s fine.

I&#39;ll help you.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> But I want you and Miyu to both join me. We&#39;ll make this Chaldea pair our slaves.</p><p><strong>Mini C\xFA:</strong><br> It&#39;s fine to be greedy about things that don&#39;t matter.<br> But don&#39;t get too greedy when it counts, Medb.</p><p><strong>Mini C\xFA:</strong><br> Kill them. They&#39;re worthless to be slaves. They may not look it, but they&#39;re no different than Spartacus.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Oh, Mini C\xFA! Even shrunken down you&#39;re still so cold and cruel!\u2661</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> But I&#39;m not going to listen to you.<br> I&#39;m the queen.

That&#39;s just self-righteous nonsense!</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Or is this your way of begging for your life?</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> Are you trying to forgive a selfish person like her, who&#39;s caused so many problems?</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> Even if it wasn&#39;t Medb who kidnapped Miyu, she was the one who made it possible by attacking us!</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> She&#39;s even trying to invade Chaldea, the place where you live!</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Heheheh.<br> Shut up. Shut up! Shut up!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> It&#39;s the First Lady who&#39;s at fault, not Medb.</p><hr><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Don&#39;t talk to me. Don&#39;t look at me.

What did you say?</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> Because of what you just said.</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> \u201CI get saved, I get satisfied, I&#39;m cute, and I&#39;m the most important!\u201D</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> I think that&#39;s also what Nursery and Medea wanted.</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> But you didn&#39;t say that you only wanted that for yourself.</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> You didn&#39;t say it aloud, but you saw the other magical girls who disappeared as comrades, didn&#39;t you?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> The castle&#39;s falling apart!?</p><hr><p><strong>Mini C\xFA:</strong><br> And there&#39;s the straw that broke the camel&#39;s back. Thanks for finishing her off, little lady.</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> What!?</p><p><strong>Mini C\xFA:</strong><br> That broke Medb&#39;s heart.<br> The castle falling apart is proof of that.</p><p><strong>Mini C\xFA:</strong><br> Isn&#39;t that right, Medb? You realized your own weakness and this time, you really killed yourself.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> I&#39;m sorry.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> But I&#39;m not worthy of you, Mini C\xFA... I&#39;ll die and come back again...</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> I&#39;ll come back as a magical girl who&#39;s more evil, more debauched, more wicked and even more amazing!</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Wait for me until then, Mini C\xFA\u2661</p><p><strong>Mini C\xFA:</strong><br> If fate brings us together, maybe. Well, if that does happen, this time I&#39;ll kill you myself.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Hehe. That&#39;s right. That&#39;s our relationship, isn&#39;t it?</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Anyway, I guess it&#39;s time for me to leave the stage.<br> For a villain, I think I lasted pretty long.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> You. Pig. The one from Chaldea.<br> What was your name?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Fujimaru.</p><hr><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Fujimaru. What a boring name.<br> I don&#39;t want to remember it, so get lost.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Take that little puppy dog with you. Don&#39;t stay here.<br> Go save your stupid world.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> See this out until the end.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Medb.<br> Master! The castle&#39;s falling apart!</p><p><strong>Sapphire:</strong><br> Everyone, please evacuate the castle.</p><p><strong>Ruby:</strong><br> Illya! What are you doing!</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> Medb, come with us!</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> With Helena&#39;s help, we can heal you!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> That&#39;s right, Medb! Come with us!</p><hr><p><strong>Mini C\xFA:</strong><br> That won&#39;t work. She can&#39;t escape.</p><p><strong>Mini C\xFA:</strong><br> This is backlash.</p><p><strong>Mini C\xFA:</strong><br> She built up quite a tab forcibly interfering with other worlds, and now all that stress is coming back to her.</p><p><strong>Mini C\xFA:</strong><br> Trying to deny that is an insult to her. She played the villain knowing what she was getting into from the start.</p><p><strong>Mini C\xFA:</strong><br> You can have her life and her heart, but you can&#39;t have her pride. Now get out of here.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Master!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Sorry, Medb.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Mini C\xFA:</strong><br> They left, huh?<br> Tch, I&#39;m done for, too.</p><p><strong>Mini C\xFA:</strong><br> Medb, what little magical energy you had is gone now.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Mini C\xFA:</strong><br> I always wanted to ask.</p><p><strong>Mini C\xFA:</strong><br> What&#39;s the happiest thing in the world to you?</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> I already have it... Mini C\xFA...</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> The greatest happiness a woman can have... is being next to the one they love... when they die.</p><p><strong>Mini C\xFA:</strong><br> What? The hell did you say, Medb? Wake up.</p><p><strong>Mini C\xFA:</strong><br> Seriously? Wow. I guess in the very end, you won.</p><p><strong>Sapphire:</strong><br> The castle has completely collapsed.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The jewel! It&#39;s in my hand...</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> I see. So Medb became an Echo.</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> Then someday, I&#39;ll see her in my library.<br> Though I&#39;ve never heard of her liking books.</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> Helena. Just as I promised, I&#39;ll give back your jewel.</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> Thank you.<br> Oh, don&#39;t worry about Medb.</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> She was more than willing to kill you.<br> There&#39;s no need for pity.</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> And Medb entrusted you with that jewel. Not to you, Illya, but to Mash.</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> At last. We have all four jewels.<br> Which means...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> We can go inside the black wall?</p><hr><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> To the First Lady&#39;s kingdom...!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The jewels...

Be careful!</p><p><strong>Ruby:</strong><br> Ho-hoh? So that&#39;s the First Lady&#39;s kingdom, huh?</p><p><strong>Ruby:</strong><br> It&#39;s cold, like time itself is frozen.<br> And there&#39;s a solitary castle in the middle...</p><p><strong>Ruby:</strong><br> It&#39;s like the mind of a magical girl had taken form!</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> What kind of mind is it?</p><p><strong>Sapphire:</strong><br> The castle feels different from when I made my escape.</p><p><strong>Sapphire:</strong><br> So not only did the wall come down, there was a change inside, too?</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> A change? Hm? Something&#39;s flying towards us.</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> Is it... a bird?</p><p><strong>Sapphire:</strong><br> Huh? That&#39;s...!</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> I feel a great flow of magical energy...</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> The magical energy that filled this world is gathering where the First Lady is.</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> Does she have a vessel capable of holding all that magical power?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Master, if we&#39;re on schedule, then now...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Yeah, Chaldea should be... there it is!</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Hey, you&#39;re all looking good!<br> I was worried, but I&#39;m glad you&#39;re safe!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Huh? Where&#39;s Illya and Ruby?<br> D-Don&#39;t tell me...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> They&#39;re both fine. We also met up with Ruby&#39;s little sister, Sapphire.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Doctor, tell us what is happening there!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Little sister? A Mystic Code has a little sister?<br> No, I can&#39;t think about it now. We&#39;re in a hurry.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I had a meeting with Da Vinci and we came up with an engineering solution.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> That world is very dangerous.<br> But we&#39;ve become very involved with it.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> At this point, we&#39;re a part of this too.<br> We can&#39;t just ignore it.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> And personally, I can&#39;t just leave Illya when she needs help.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Does that mean Chaldea is going to provide us full operational support?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> That&#39;s right!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Of course, personally I&#39;m extremely interested in that grotesque... I mean, strange world.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> That space should normally be... hmm... I guess you could call it a dumping ground for thoughts and feelings.</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> You don&#39;t need to be so careful with your words. Yes. This place is purgatory itself.</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> This is a dumping ground for magical girls who dreamed an endless dream, and failed to reach it!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Brava! All right, no need to explain!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It&#39;s not wonderful! Nothing is all right!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> No, this is good! It&#39;s very good!<br> A magical girl is an extremely unstable being.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> They have overwhelming magical energy, and sometimes can use magecraft intuitively, and without the proper rituals.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> But for those who lose their possibilities and give in to despair, their obsession becomes a flow of unformed magical energy.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> A stagnant pool forming in a chaotic waste dump.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> The First Lady became the locus of those chaotic thoughts and feelings, and the Reality Marble formed mostly on its own.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> I assume that&#39;s about what happened.</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> Are you... a genius?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Of course I am. I apologize.<br> I should&#39;ve told you so earlier.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Then that means...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> If she disappears, everything will return to normal?</p><hr><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> That&#39;s right! That&#39;s what I&#39;m after, you see!<br> It&#39;s the best way to solve the root problem here.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> But I don&#39;t know what that active magical girl with you will think. Or the residents of that world.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Man, you can be harsh. Though that may be the most realistic solution.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> But let me say one thing.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> You guys have done all kinds of things that I thought were impossible.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> You can&#39;t make a miracle happen if you&#39;re worried about safety, efficiency, or a plan B.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> If you&#39;ve made it this far, you should do what you want to do.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I&#39;m grateful, Doctor.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Thank you.</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> Illya came back.</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> Fujimaru!

Is she shy?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Or maybe she&#39;s in a hurry to try something?</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> Yes. It has something to do with the jewels we&#39;ve been gathering. That&#39;s my guess.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> You mean it was the First Lady herself who disengaged the black wall? Not the power of the four jewels?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Does that mean she has been intentionally pitting the magical girls against each other from this isolated space?</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> It&#39;s contradictory. As if two wills are at war with each other.</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> Either way, to learn her true motive, we&#39;ll just have to ask the First Lady herself.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Maybe she doesn&#39;t actually want to fight Illya...</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> And remember what Miyu said at the end of the message...

That&#39;s right. Right now, I have my own stone, so I can fight to some extent.</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> Still, I&#39;m not your Servant.<br> I&#39;m here as a magical girl and that&#39;s all.</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> So...

What&#39;s this!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Part of Miyu&#39;s restraints are transforming...!?</p><hr><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> It&#39;s a defensive reaction of the Voile de Deuil.</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> It&#39;s an Anti-Magical Girl Mystic Code.<br> Even you wouldn&#39;t escape unscathed, Mash.</p><p><strong>Ruby:</strong><br> What, an Anti-Magical Girl Mystic Code!?<br> That&#39;s impossible! It&#39;s way too niche!</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> You&#39;re one to talk, Ruby, you cheerful-type something-something spirit... But never mind that now!</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> What&#39;s going on, Chloe? If it&#39;s a joke, it&#39;s gone too far! Release Miyu right now!</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> Oh, what should I do? I mean, I went to all the trouble of making her mine.</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> It used to be so annoying how you would always monopolize her, Illya.</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> Heh... This feels nostalgic. Yes. Maybe this is closer to my true self.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Illya? Is Chloe being controlled by the First Lady?</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> Ulp... She could be. But she seems to be acting pretty naturally to me...</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> Chloe always did love pranks like this...</p><p><strong>Ruby:</strong><br> I&#39;m not picking up any strange magical energy.<br> This is the normal Chloe.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> How did she get her supply of magical energy?</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> Ah! That&#39;s right! If she was controlling those familiars, it would&#39;ve taken a lot of...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Um, Illya... Miyu&#39;s magical energy... Could it be being harvested?</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> Huh? Ah, yes... It&#39;s possible.<br> That&#39;s why Miyu is tied up like that!</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> I&#39;m a little jeal... No! I mean, that&#39;s terrible harassment!</p><p><strong>Sapphire:</strong><br> My apologies for butting in. I don&#39;t think that&#39;s what Fujimaru meant...</p><p><strong>Sapphire:</strong><br> You don&#39;t find it questionable that Chloe isn&#39;t draining magical energy from us magical sticks?</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> My mind immediately went there? Aughhh!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I-I&#39;m sorry, Master! I went off the rails!</p><hr><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> Whew... You people certainly are noisy...</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> I don&#39;t want you getting the wrong idea, so let me dispel your doubts.</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> Illya, when you and Miyu went to the Mirror World...</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> I was actually with you.</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> You two were in a hurry to get something there, so it seems you didn&#39;t notice my presence.</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> Flustered, I did a little tuning and jumped into the Reality Marble. In retrospect, that probably wasn&#39;t a good idea.</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> The next thing I knew, I was in this world.<br> And all alone.</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> You were here... before us?<br> In this world?</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> That&#39;s right. Ever since, I&#39;ve been alone here.<br> Like a time warp from the unstable jump?</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> When I looked out over this world, I saw magical girls at war with each other, and I didn&#39;t know which were allies.</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> Even just concealing my presence consumed more and more of my magical energy.</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> It got to the point where I almost disappeared.<br> And I was very... lonely.</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> But then I met Her.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> You mean the First Lady...?</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> Her familiar, to be precise.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Illya?</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> Wha...!?</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> You were that reckless!?<br> Chloe, you dummy!</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> Huh? How about you two? The ones who set off for the Mirror World without even telling me!</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> But we had an errand to do for Rin and we were in a hurry.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Chloe, we&#39;re from Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> Stop. There&#39;s no need for introductions.</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> You&#39;re Fujimaru and Mash.</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> I&#39;ve gathered what&#39;s going on, more or less, through Illya&#39;s senses. So I know your circumstances as well.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Then why didn&#39;t you join us, Chloe?</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> That was because...</p><hr><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> Because I was hoping that Rin or Luvia would come and save us.</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> But since they didn&#39;t notice I was gone in the first place, of course they didn&#39;t come to save me.</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> But...that wasn&#39;t it. My appearance in this world was inevitable.</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> The First Lady told me something. She was brutally honest. It was like a knife sliding through my ribs.</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> \u201CIs the meaning of your life to be an accessory to Illya? You&#39;re like a wildcat that&#39;s been declawed.\u201D That&#39;s what she said.</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> That&#39;s not...!</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> Yes, yes, I know. You deny it. Of course.<br> You&#39;re Illya.</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> More importantly, I don&#39;t see it that way, either.<br> That being said...</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> I did realize that some part of me thinks of you as \u201Cnumber one.\u201D</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> After all, I would even be friendly with Miyu for your sake. It&#39;s for my sake, too, so it&#39;s only natural.</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> Chloe...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Master... Chloe&#39;s mood is shifting...</p><p><strong>Ruby:</strong><br> Eeeek! MG Power just shot up! How many transformations does she have left!?</p><p><strong>Sapphire:</strong><br> But we still don&#39;t have an opening.<br> We need to somehow get to Miyu.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Servility and trust are two different things, Chloe.</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> I know that! I know the essence of the world is how unfair it is!</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> And I know that you&#39;re an extremely decent person, so much that being sarcastic to you makes me feel like a fool!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Tanned skin and pale eyes are great charm points!</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> Wha... Huh!?</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> T-That&#39;s right! Beautiful tanned...<br> That&#39;s not the point!</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> Chloe, I&#39;m the one who idolizes you! You&#39;re strong and have your act together infinitely more than me!</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> That&#39;s not what I&#39;m talking about. I don&#39;t think you&#39;ll ever be able to understand it, Illya.</p><hr><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> But even I have a wish that I want to come true.</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> For my sake alone. My own wish that would reach the world.</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> Chloe is... projecting a weapon!</p><p><strong>Ruby:</strong><br> Oh my. This is definitely battle mode, isn&#39;t it?</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> Oh, Chloe, how could you!?</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> Fujimaru, Mash, and Sapphire too, please!</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> Please give me just a little time!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> T-Take it easy, though.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> If that&#39;s your wish, Illya.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> This is a sisterly fight, right? Knock yourself out!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> A full throttle magic combat with the sisters&#39; supremacy on the line... I&#39;m kind of captiva... N-No!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> If it becomes dangerous, I&#39;m going to stop you both!</p><hr><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> Thank you.<br> Ruby!</p><p><strong>Ruby:</strong><br> Yes\u2606 Can I punch the mischievous Chloe once?</p><p><strong>Sapphire:</strong><br> Come on, there&#39;s not a moment to lose.<br> Let&#39;s just use my brainwashing device...</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> No! I&#39;m going to turn off the switch that made her weird!</p><p><strong>Ruby:</strong><br> Yeah, yeah\u2606 Beat her with your conviction, right?<br> I know full well what you&#39;re going to do!</p><p><strong>Ruby:</strong><br> But I also think you should apologize to her later for neglecting her.</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> Ulp...<br> Any way, get away from Miyu, Chloe!</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> Forget it! Miyu is mine now!</p><h2 id="world-end-match-first-lady" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#world-end-match-first-lady" aria-hidden="true">#</a> World End Match: First Lady</h2><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> (Panting)</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> I guess it&#39;s hard for us to have a decisive showdown, Illya...</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> There&#39;s a limit to how much I can bear my shared pain with you.</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> Chloe!? What&#39;s wrong? Your body...!</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> Isn&#39;t it obvious? It&#39;s the First Lady.</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> She doesn&#39;t just want Miyu. She wants you, too.<br> Who knew there was someone greedier than me.</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> W-What are you talking about, Chloe!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Chloe. It was the First Lady&#39;s idea to abduct Miyu, wasn&#39;t it?</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> I&#39;m not...sure about that...</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> Chloe? Chloe!?</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> Unhhh... Wait, not yet... Stop... it...!</p><p><strong>E\uFF1A???:</strong><br> As promised... I waited until after your duel with Illya, Chloe.</p><p><strong>E\uFF1A???:</strong><br> As a vessel, you are impeccable.<br> However, it seems you fall short of Illya&#39;s heart.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Chloe&#39;s body... Even her voice has changed completely!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> The First Lady...!?</p><hr><p><strong>E\uFF1AFirst Lady:</strong><br> That&#39;s right. It&#39;s a pleasure to meet you.<br> I am the First Lady. The first magical girl.</p><p><strong>E\uFF1AFirst Lady:</strong><br> Shall I introduce myself further? Perhaps in an amiable, courteous way, as befits a magical girl?</p><p><strong>E\uFF1AFirst Lady:</strong><br> I was born in the Demon World, but raised in the human world.</p><p><strong>E\uFF1AFirst Lady:</strong><br> I hid my identity and fought for people. But because of that, I lost my homeland and was forgotten by both humans and my brethren in the Demon World.</p><p><strong>E\uFF1AFirst Lady:</strong><br> Now no one knows who I am. There is no longer anyone around who will call my name.</p><p><strong>E\uFF1AFirst Lady:</strong><br> But I didn&#39;t hate humans or my brethren. I definitely didn&#39;t sink to the level of becoming a witch.</p><p><strong>E\uFF1AFirst Lady:</strong><br> Right now, my only desire is to keep making girls&#39; wishes come true.</p><p><strong>E\uFF1AFirst Lady:</strong><br> I want to spread the magic of magical girls... of love and hope... throughout the world.</p><p><strong>E\uFF1AFirst Lady:</strong><br> Those feelings attracted Echoes to this Reality Marble.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Are you an Echo?</p><p><strong>E\uFF1AFirst Lady:</strong><br> Yes. Until Chloe came here, I suppose my existence was ephemeral like that.</p><p><strong>E\uFF1AFirst Lady:</strong><br> To form and sustain this Reality Marble, I needed to have an invisible presence.</p><p><strong>E\uFF1AFirst Lady:</strong><br> I gave the girls temporary bodies and magical energy to act as materials for them to create towns, castles, and kingdoms in this world.</p><p><strong>E\uFF1AFirst Lady:</strong><br> But it wasn&#39;t the same. To really make my wish come true, I needed a real magical girl. That&#39;s where Chloe came in.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Why did you set the magical girls on each other?</p><p><strong>E\uFF1AFirst Lady:</strong><br> Ah... I regret that.</p><p><strong>E\uFF1AFirst Lady:</strong><br> It wasn&#39;t supposed to happen like this.<br> It&#39;s too late now, though.</p><p><strong>E\uFF1AFirst Lady:</strong><br> There&#39;s not enough space! This Reality Marble isn&#39;t big enough for all of us.</p><p><strong>E\uFF1AFirst Lady:</strong><br> That&#39;s why I won&#39;t let you interfere.<br> We need another world!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Why did you need Chloe?</p><p><strong>E\uFF1AFirst Lady:</strong><br> Why did Chloe appear before me?</p><p><strong>E\uFF1AFirst Lady:</strong><br> It doesn&#39;t matter. That&#39;s not the issue. I have no intention of letting this opportunity get away from me.</p><p><strong>E\uFF1AFirst Lady:</strong><br> Yes Mash, that&#39;s why I reached out to you as well, an employee of Chaldea.</p><p><strong>E\uFF1AFirst Lady:</strong><br> With Miyu, I can do it. I can give all of the Echoes new incarnations.</p><p><strong>E\uFF1AFirst Lady:</strong><br> And not inside this empty cage that is this Reality Marble, but in the real world.</p><p><strong>E\uFF1AFirst Lady:</strong><br> Infinite parallel worlds host infinite crises. That&#39;s where you&#39;ll find real enemies who need to be defeated.</p><p><strong>E\uFF1AFirst Lady:</strong><br> There are miserable people who sincerely need magical girls!!</p><p><strong>E\uFF1AFirst Lady:</strong><br> Hence the Little Witch Codes... Nay, Prisma Codes!</p><p><strong>E\uFF1AFirst Lady:</strong><br> We&#39;ll race to even the farthest parallel worlds!<br> Because my wish will come true!</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> This is...</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> Just like Medb... No, this is different... It&#39;s more evil... Darker...</p><p><strong>Ruby:</strong><br> Exactly. And she still tells herself that the means justify the end.</p><p><strong>E\uFF1AFirst Lady:</strong><br> Illya... You would deny me my one and only, non-negotiable wish.</p><p><strong>E\uFF1AFirst Lady:</strong><br> After seeing the way you behaved towards the magical girls of this world, I finally realized that.</p><p><strong>E\uFF1AFirst Lady:</strong><br> I will allow no interference.<br> Soon, I will absorb Miyu.</p><p><strong>E\uFF1AFirst Lady:</strong><br> Miyu is a stubborn one. And Chloe, who&#39;s already a part of me, resists assimilation even now. She is a truly disobedient girl.</p><p><strong>E\uFF1AFirst Lady:</strong><br> Even so, it&#39;s only a matter of time.</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> Ms. Lady...</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> I can tell that you believe in the magical girls.<br> But there&#39;s one thing I know.</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> No wish is worth sacrificing Miyu!</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> And not only Miyu! Chloe, too.<br> Chloe is my precious other half!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> That&#39;s right! A selfish wish like that will never come true.</p><hr><p><strong>E\uFF1AFirst Lady:</strong><br> Is it because I&#39;m an Echo? Nothing more than an echo that doesn&#39;t resonate within anyone&#39;s heart?</p><p><strong>E\uFF1AFirst Lady:</strong><br> You&#39;ll forget me too, won&#39;t you?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I have no intention of consoling you.</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> Fujimaru...</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> I can&#39;t go that far in rejecting The First Lady...<br> I can&#39;t repudiate her...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Deep down, everyone has their own magical girl.</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> How could you say a crazy line like that with a straight face!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> B-but that sounds a little... like you are trying to cheer up the First Lady!</p><hr><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> Ms. Lady, you are my Senpai as a magical girl, and a major Senpai at that.</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> But that&#39;s even more reason for not being able to overlook this. If you&#39;re making a mistake, I have to tell you so.</p><p><strong>E\uFF1AFirst Lady:</strong><br> Heeheeheehee.</p><p><strong>E\uFF1AFirst Lady:</strong><br> The same thing. Chloe told me the same thing.<br> And now you too!</p><p><strong>E\uFF1AFirst Lady:</strong><br> Do you really want to consign me to the past that badly?</p><p><strong>E\uFF1AFirst Lady:</strong><br> When I can save the world... When I can become queen...</p><p><strong>E\uFF1AFirst Lady:</strong><br> Illya, eventually, so could you.</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> Listen to me, First Lady! Your wish would only turn into a curse!</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> We magical girls are always getting involved in half-baked, outrageous trouble.</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> But even so, there are good things...<br> Wait? ...Were there good things? Um...</p><p><strong>Ruby:</strong><br> Excuse me, Illya? At this point, you should be completely candid.</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> Ah, t-that&#39;s right! There are moments where I thought it was a good thing!</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> I got to meet Miyu, whom I just love. And with Chloe,<br> I got a sassy yet dependable little sister.</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> With Ruby, Sapphire, Rin, and Luvia, I had reservations at first...</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> ...but they&#39;ve become dear friends for whom I could give up everything.</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> That&#39;s the best treasure of all, isn&#39;t it?</p><p><strong>E\uFF1AFirst Lady:</strong><br> I had friends, too. But the world abandoned me.</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> Huh?</p><p><strong>E\uFF1AFirst Lady:</strong><br> Fujimaru, what about you?</p><p><strong>E\uFF1AFirst Lady:</strong><br> I suspect you actually want to be forgotten. Perhaps that&#39;s the kind of person you are.</p><p><strong>E\uFF1AFirst Lady:</strong><br> But... what would you do if you could save the world?</p><p><strong>E\uFF1AFirst Lady:</strong><br> Right now, it&#39;s tougher and more painful than ever before and you want to run away, but you&#39;re still alive, right?</p><p><strong>E\uFF1AFirst Lady:</strong><br> The moment you save the world, you would die.</p><p><strong>E\uFF1AFirst Lady:</strong><br> And Mash Kyrielight, what about you?</p><p><strong>E\uFF1AFirst Lady:</strong><br> Will your bond with Fujimaru last forever?<br> Really?</p><p><strong>E\uFF1AFirst Lady:</strong><br> Would you be able to endure if you were abandoned?</p><p><strong>E\uFF1AFirst Lady:</strong><br> If you could be with your Master for eternity, would you cling to that hope?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> No. That isn&#39;t hope.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Ms. Lady, you&#39;re very hurt.<br> No one was able to heal or protect you.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> You&#39;ve fought cruel destiny all this time, haven&#39;t you?<br> I respect you. I definitely don&#39;t pity you.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It&#39;s a miracle that you and I met. I won&#39;t forget you.<br> Even if you forget me.</p><p><strong>E\uFF1AFirst Lady:</strong><br> Ah... You... lie... That&#39;s ...a lie!</p><p><strong>Miyu:</strong><br> ... Ill... ya...</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> Miyu! You&#39;ve come to!</p><p><strong>Sapphire:</strong><br> Miyu!</p><p><strong>Miyu:</strong><br> Help... The First Lady... Help Chloe...</p><p><strong>Miyu:</strong><br> Her words... are false... She&#39;s hiding a wish... that won&#39;t come true deep in her heart...</p><p><strong>Miyu:</strong><br> Please... She&#39;s crying on the inside. Take her hand... Just as Illya... Just as you did for me...</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> Okay. Hold on just a little longer, Miyu!</p><p><strong>Miyu:</strong><br> Also... um...</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> Huh? W-What?</p><p><strong>Miyu:</strong><br> Being with Chloe all this time... It&#39;s been awkward...</p><p><strong>Miyu:</strong><br> I mean, not knowing what to talk about... But silence is... painful...</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> Huh?</p><p><strong>E\uFF1AFirst Lady/Chloe:</strong><br> Excuse me, what was that!? When I&#39;m doing everything I can in here to fight her!!</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> Oh, Chloe&#39;s back.</p><p><strong>E\uFF1AFirst Lady/Chloe:</strong><br> I tried to be on my best behavior with you! So if you&#39;ve got something to say about me, say it to my face! Oh, you&#39;re such a pain!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> D-Don&#39;t, Chloe!<br> If you show hatred towards Miyu.</p><p><strong>E\uFF1AFirst Lady/Chloe:</strong><br> Oh, shoot...! Come on... Illya, do something!</p><p><strong>Miyu:</strong><br> Ah... I&#39;m... sorry...</p><p><strong>E\uFF1AFirst Lady:</strong><br> Heh... Heh-heh...</p><p><strong>E\uFF1AFirst Lady:</strong><br> By seeking out Miyu, Chloe and I have become one.</p><p><strong>E\uFF1AFirst Lady:</strong><br> Thanks to that, I&#39;ve broken through Chloe&#39;s mental wall. Now I can fight with all my might in this body!</p><p><strong>E\uFF1AFirst Lady:</strong><br> Once I defeat all of you in front of Miyu, her last emotional support will crumble, and I will reach infinite worlds!</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> And then, when you get to those worlds, what are you going to sacrifice next?</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> After all, Miyu&#39;s fighting you.<br> And I can&#39;t lose!</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> Because the magical girls of Kaleid are two people in one!</p><p><strong>Ruby:</strong><br> That&#39;s right! Now I&#39;m moved, too!</p><p><strong>Sapphire:</strong><br> Illya, everyone, please!</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> Fujimaru! Mash!</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> Please, just one more time! Let&#39;s fight together!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Mash. Mash Kyrielight.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes, Master. Our feelings are one.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> For the longest time, I wondered why I wanted to become Illya&#39;s ally... but now I know.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Nursery and Medea, too.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Despite wielding amazing power and beset by their own despair, they refused to walk away.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Every time, I felt choked up. I thought to myself,<br> \u201Care magical girls really that sad?\u201D</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> But Illya didn&#39;t give up. Even if her wish was immature, there was nothing to be ashamed of!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Yeah, we&#39;ll side with those that persevere.</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> Fujimaru...<br> Thankyou...</p><p><strong>Ruby:</strong><br> Mash and Fujimaru, you&#39;re both the best!<br> I will always be grateful, too!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Have you learned something about strength from Illya?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes, Senpai.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> With magical girls, I&#39;m sure they don&#39;t get all of their strength from using magic!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Illya. This is my fight now, too.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Let&#39;s get Chloe and Miyu out of here!<br> And then we&#39;ll help the First Lady, too.</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> Okay! Thank you!</p><p><strong>E\uFF1AFirst Lady:</strong><br> I&#39;m going to chant magic words.</p><p><strong>E\uFF1AFirst Lady:</strong><br> Words for the unhappy, unfulfilled worlds beyond the reflective pathways of dimensions!</p><h2 id="epilog-the-windflower-blooming-in-the-breeze" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#epilog-the-windflower-blooming-in-the-breeze" aria-hidden="true">#</a> epilog: The Windflower Blooming in the Breeze</h2><p><strong>E\uFF1AFirst Lady/Chloe:</strong><br> Ugh...</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> (Panting) We wore her down... right?</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> Are you the First Lady now?

Miyu!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Mash, take care of Miyu!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Right! I&#39;ll help her immediately!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Miyu, can you stand? Please grab on to me.</p><p><strong>Miyu:</strong><br> Yes, I&#39;m fine... but... Let me hold onto your arm for a moment, Mash.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> (Never said it but actually prefers Miyu) You okay, Miyu?</p><p><strong>Miyu:</strong><br> Yes. Thank you for helping Illya.</p><p><strong>Miyu:</strong><br> I&#39;m fine now. Now please, go to her... Help Chloe...</p><p><strong>Miyu:</strong><br> Um... I&#39;m fine.</p><p><strong>Miyu:</strong><br> I&#39;m fine, really. You can put me down now...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Master?</p><hr><p><strong>Miyu:</strong><br> Whew. Thank you too, Sapphire.</p><p><strong>Sapphire:</strong><br> Miyu...</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> I&#39;m so glad, Miyu...</p><p><strong>First Lady:</strong><br> What is the big idea, Illya?</p><p><strong>First Lady:</strong><br> If you don&#39;t finish me off... You won&#39;t win.</p><p><strong>First Lady:</strong><br> I&#39;ll never give up... I can&#39;t give up...</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> It&#39;s not about winning or losing, Ms. Lady.</p><p><strong>Miyu:</strong><br> That&#39;s right. It&#39;s not.</p><p><strong>Miyu:</strong><br> What you&#39;re doing isn&#39;t about obsession, or ideals.<br> It&#39;s about atonement.</p><p><strong>Miyu:</strong><br> First Lady, you just can&#39;t accept it.<br> What you have is different from Illya&#39;s pure feelings.</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> M-Miyu...</p><p><strong>Miyu:</strong><br> Illya, tell her how you feel.</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> What? Me!?</p><p><strong>Miyu:</strong><br> Yes. Tell her everything. Honestly.<br> So that it will reach her heart.</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> Got it, Miyu.</p><p><strong>First Lady:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> Ms. Lady... I-I...</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> I&#39;m always so busy dealing with what&#39;s going on around me... So I&#39;ve never thought about saving the world...</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> No, to be honest, I forced myself to think it had nothing to do with me because things were far away.</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> But if I was in your place, Ms. Lady...</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> If I had such an incredible power that it became my duty to help people who relied on me...</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> I wouldn&#39;t know what I&#39;d do... Or who I would chose.</p><p><strong>First Lady:</strong><br> ...I see.</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> But, if my friends and family that I love were in danger, I&#39;d use my magic without hesitation.</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> I&#39;d use my magic to protect everyone&#39;s smiles.</p><p><strong>First Lady:</strong><br> Even if it meant that you yourself had to cry?</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> ...(Nod)</p><p><strong>First Lady:</strong><br> Illya... I&#39;m jealous of you.</p><p><strong>First Lady:</strong><br> But at the same time, I think you&#39;re foolish.<br> It&#39;s like looking at the old me.</p><p><strong>First Lady:</strong><br> I couldn&#39;t save... the friend I cared about...</p><p><strong>First Lady:</strong><br> I had to choose between her and the world and I chose...the world.</p><p><strong>First Lady:</strong><br> I couldn&#39;t save... my best... friend...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That&#39;s...</p><p><strong>Miyu:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> You sacrificed... your friend?<br> Was she a magical girl, too?</p><p><strong>First Lady:</strong><br> ...No.</p><p><strong>First Lady:</strong><br> She refused to be a magical girl. She became an enemy of the world, and brought despair to everyone.</p><p><strong>First Lady:</strong><br> That&#39;s why I... I had to stop her... myself...</p><p><strong>First Lady:</strong><br> I&#39;ll never see her again... I couldn&#39;t tell her... that I was sorry!</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> I don&#39;t know about that.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...!?</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> Helena!?</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> Helena! And Mr. Lion, too!?</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> Yes. I unfortunately survived. Just like the First Lady? No, that&#39;s not right.</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> Not only did I fail to become something, I failed to die, too. I really fail at everything, don&#39;t I?</p><p><strong>Mini Edison:</strong><br> Don&#39;t worry, self-deprecation is a habit of hers.<br> Just ignore her.</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> Al...! Keep your mouth shut...</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> When your battle started for real, the First Lady&#39;s familiars ceased to be a threat.</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> It was tough just getting to this throne room.<br> The barriers on this castle are too strong, and she can&#39;t get in.</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> If Miyu&#39;s okay, let&#39;s take the First Lady and go outside.</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> While we move, can you tell me about the girl the First Lady is possessing?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Of course, but who is \u201Cshe\u201D?</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> Eeee...!</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> Are you that ghost from before?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> What are you doing here?</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> This Echo is probably the one that was often wandering around the black wall.</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> After the wall fell, I found her heading for the castle.</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> Wait a minute, First Lady, do you know her?</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> She looks like she wants to say something to you.</p><p><strong>First Lady:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Echo:</strong><br> ...!</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> It looks like she&#39;s really mad.</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> She trying to tell the First Lady something?<br> But I don&#39;t know what she&#39;s saying!</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> Ruby, can&#39;t you do something?</p><p><strong>Ruby:</strong><br> Just leave it to me! Try my special ghost medium potion! Here! (Stab)</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> Oooh!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> She didn&#39;t even ask for permission!</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> Did the ghost really posess her? That was easy. I know it&#39;s redundant to say it, but that Mystic Code has some crazy functions.</p><p><strong>Miyu:</strong><br> Well... Illya? I mean, Ghost?</p><p><strong>First Lady:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> ...ou...</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> ...You...</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> You... dummy!</p><p><strong>E\uFF1AFirst Lady/Chloe:</strong><br> Oww...She just hit me! What was that for...?</p><p><strong>E\uFF1AFirst Lady/Chloe:</strong><br> Ow! That really hurt...!</p><p><strong>Ruby:</strong><br> Oh-ho? The defensive response brought Chloe halfway back.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Who are you?</p><hr><p><strong>Miyu:</strong><br> The girl possessing Illya...</p><p><strong>Miyu:</strong><br> I may know her. If she&#39;s the girl from my dream...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Your dream?</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> But it just looks like Illya and Chloe are brawling.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Um, Illya?</p><hr><p><strong>A\uFF1A???/Illya:</strong><br> I&#39;m calling you a dummy because you&#39;re a dummy!</p><p><strong>E\uFF1AFirst Lady/Chloe:</strong><br> The way you&#39;re talking...</p><p><strong>E\uFF1AFirst Lady/Chloe:</strong><br> Mila? Is that you!?<br> Are you one of the Echoes here?</p><p><strong>A\uFF1AMila/Illya:</strong><br> Yes, got a problem with that?</p><p><strong>A\uFF1AMila/Illya:</strong><br> It was only for a short while, but I was a magical girl. That&#39;s why I have the right to be here.</p><p><strong>A\uFF1AMila/Illya:</strong><br> And right now, you&#39;re the First Lady.<br> The first magical girl. Right?</p><p><strong>Miyu:</strong><br> It is her.</p><p><strong>Miyu:</strong><br> Mila? Are you the First Lady&#39;s special friend?</p><p><strong>A\uFF1AMila/Illya:</strong><br> That&#39;s right, Miyu.</p><p><strong>A\uFF1AMila/Illya:</strong><br> I am a former magical girl who was slain by the First Lady.</p><p><strong>Ruby:</strong><br> Wait, that means you were the first corrupted magical girl.</p><p><strong>Sapphire:</strong><br> Sister, be quiet.</p><p><strong>A\uFF1AMila/Illya:</strong><br> First Lady... You did your best as a magical girl.</p><p><strong>A\uFF1AMila/Illya:</strong><br> You gave everything you had to the world so that everyone could be happy.</p><p><strong>A\uFF1AMila/Illya:</strong><br> But the harder you worked, the more people&#39;s smiles disappeared.</p><p><strong>A\uFF1AMila/Illya:</strong><br> You were worn down by their greed and dissatisfaction, until you were crying even as you smiled.</p><p><strong>A\uFF1AMila/Illya:</strong><br> I didn&#39;t think that world was worth saving.<br> I chose you, not the world.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Mila...</p><p><strong>E\uFF1AFirst Lady/Chloe:</strong><br> Were you here the whole time, Mila?<br> And I just didn&#39;t notice?</p><p><strong>A\uFF1AMila/Illya:</strong><br> That&#39;s right. I&#39;m just a shadowy Echo.</p><p><strong>A\uFF1AMila/Illya:</strong><br> Without borrowing Illya&#39;s body, I can&#39;t maintain my consciousness.</p><p><strong>A\uFF1AMila/Illya:</strong><br> But I always felt your presence, because this world is the manifestation of your regrets.</p><p><strong>A\uFF1AMila/Illya:</strong><br> That&#39;s why I always wished I could go beyond the black wall, so that I could bring peace to your heart.</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> ...!?</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> Mila, you were the one who opened a Leyline outside the Reality Marble!</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> It wasn&#39;t a coincidence that summoned Chloe to this world. Mila, it was your wish.</p><p><strong>A\uFF1AMila/Illya:</strong><br> I&#39;m not aware of that, but... If I did, I apologize.<br> I caused you a lot of trouble.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> T-Then what about my sleepwalking at Chaldea?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> That was probably Medb.</p><p><strong>E\uFF1AFirst Lady/Chloe:</strong><br> Yes. That was her doing.</p><p><strong>E\uFF1AFirst Lady/Chloe:</strong><br> For a very brief moment, Medb&#39;s power rivaled mine.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Was that the First Lady&#39;s doing too?</p><p><strong>E\uFF1AFirst Lady/Chloe:</strong><br> No, that was Medb.</p><hr><p><strong>E\uFF1AFirst Lady/Chloe:</strong><br> Medb used her vast magical energy to open up a Leyline.</p><p><strong>E\uFF1AFirst Lady/Chloe:</strong><br> I just tried to use that opened Leyline.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I see.</p><p><strong>E\uFF1AFirst Lady/Chloe:</strong><br> The pressure from the First Lady feels like it&#39;s about to disappear...</p><p><strong>E\uFF1AFirst Lady/Chloe:</strong><br> At this rate, no matter how much I hold back, she&#39;s going to be pushed out.</p><p><strong>Miyu:</strong><br> Helena, how are you doing?</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> I don&#39;t feel a change yet.</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> But something&#39;s already happening in the Land of Dead Bookshelves. I can feel it through the jewel.</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> The collapse is probably starting at the lands furthest from the First Lady&#39;s castle.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> So the Reality Marble can&#39;t sustain itself after all...</p><p><strong>A\uFF1AMila/Illya:</strong><br> Illya, Chloe, Miyu. I&#39;m sorry for getting you caught up in the collapse of the Reality Marble.</p><p><strong>Miyu:</strong><br> There has to be something we can do...!</p><p><strong>Miyu:</strong><br> No, I don&#39;t care what happens to me.<br> But...</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> First Lady, may I take over the Reality Marble from you?</p><p><strong>Miyu:</strong><br> The Reality Marble? Is that possible?</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> Unfortunately, I&#39;m serious.</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> This world is needed as a place for wounded magical girls to go.</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> It&#39;s not a nice way to say it, but it&#39;s the same way you need a soldier&#39;s home for wounded soldiers.</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> No, forget that example. It makes me think a dangerous antibacterial magical girl might show up.</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> Anyway. First Lady, in order to stop more girls from ending up like you...</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> ...would you let me start over with your first wish?</p><p><strong>E\uFF1AFirst Lady/Chloe:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>E\uFF1AFirst Lady/Chloe:</strong><br> Helena. Magical Girl of Wisdom and Mystics.</p><p><strong>E\uFF1AFirst Lady/Chloe:</strong><br> Yes. If that is your true wish, then... I will grant it!</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> Thank you, First Lady. I&#39;ll do it right this time.</p><p><strong>Sapphire:</strong><br> The First Lady&#39;s magical energy is fading.<br> So is Mila&#39;s...</p><p><strong>A\uFF1AMila/Illya:</strong><br> Oh no... Mila&#39;s going to disappear.</p><p><strong>A\uFF1AMila/Illya:</strong><br> Listen, First Lady.</p><p><strong>A\uFF1AMila/Illya:</strong><br> You were abandoned and forgotten by the world.<br> And you feel terribly betrayed.</p><p><strong>A\uFF1AMila/Illya:</strong><br> Magical girls aren&#39;t witches.<br> And they aren&#39;t queens.</p><p><strong>A\uFF1AMila/Illya:</strong><br> They don&#39;t seek rewards for their miracles.<br> They don&#39;t use magic for themselves.</p><p><strong>A\uFF1AMila/Illya:</strong><br> They just put the feelings that well up in their hearts into spells, for people that they will never know.</p><p><strong>A\uFF1AMila/Illya:</strong><br> Otherwise, their impossible wishes become curses.</p><p><strong>A\uFF1AMila/Illya:</strong><br> Their emotions get trapped in the gaps between worlds and turn into purgatory.</p><p><strong>E\uFF1AFirst Lady/Chloe:</strong><br> I still... And Mila, you...</p><p><strong>A\uFF1AMila/Illya:</strong><br> No, First Lady.</p><p><strong>A\uFF1AMila/Illya:</strong><br> You&#39;ve cast enough spells. You cast them until your throat went hoarse.</p><p><strong>A\uFF1AMila/Illya:</strong><br> You read the book of magic all the way to the last page.</p><p><strong>A\uFF1AMila/Illya:</strong><br> It&#39;s true that new dangers and new enemies will never stop threatening the people.</p><p><strong>A\uFF1AMila/Illya:</strong><br> But even so... That&#39;s why new magical girls, like Illya, are born.</p><p><strong>A\uFF1AMila/Illya:</strong><br> They&#39;re still incomplete magical girls, and maybe you can&#39;t totally rely on them...</p><p><strong>A\uFF1AMila/Illya:</strong><br> But that&#39;s why, in their hands...</p><p><strong>E\uFF1AFirst Lady/Chloe:</strong><br> ...the future lies within them!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> A new jewel appeared in Helena&#39;s hand...</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Ruby:</strong><br> Oh-ho? They&#39;re holding hands like lovers.</p><p><strong>Ruby:</strong><br> But now you&#39;re both back to normal.</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> Y-Yeah. I&#39;m fine. What about you, Chloe?</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> Ugh... where am I... who am I...?</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> I don&#39;t know... I can&#39;t remember any of the wicked things I&#39;ve done... So you can&#39;t ask me to be responsible for them...</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> I think I forced Miyu to give me magical energy in a way that violated FCC standards, but it was consensual so that doesn&#39;t count.</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> And no one knows that I used the First Lady&#39;s power to make a world where I was the star...</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> ...and lived a lovey-dovey life with my brother, but then I was accused by the ESRB army of justice, and I turned evil, and was defeated...</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> Anyway, a lot&#39;s happened, but well done, Illya!<br> That&#39;s my heroic magical girl! I believed in you!</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> Whoa... I know it&#39;s not Chloe&#39;s fault, but I think she should be a little more repentant...</p><p><strong>Sapphire:</strong><br> In a sense, she has the same MG Power as Illya, that lets her never doubt herself. Her alignment&#39;s chaotic, though.</p><p><strong>Ruby:</strong><br> Chloe, that&#39;s why you can never be the main character.</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> Hey! This is where you&#39;re supposed to say, \u201CIt must&#39;ve been so hard for you, but you&#39;re still lovely\u201D!</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> I worked hard too!</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> Don&#39;t you understand that it was only my iron-clad self-control that kept the First Lady in check?</p><p><strong>Miyu:</strong><br> That&#39;s... true. Chloe and the First Lady had a very high compatibility.</p><p><strong>Miyu:</strong><br> It was only thanks to Chloe&#39;s strong mind that she was able to stop the First Lady from assimilating her completely.</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> Right? Right? My heart of justice isn&#39;t so bad, is it?\u266A</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> I like fun things, mischief, my brother, and also being mean to the weak.</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> But I hate sadness more than anything. That was the one thing the First Lady and I couldn&#39;t agree on.</p><p><strong>Miyu:</strong><br> (Yeah. I understand how the First Lady feels.<br> If she had possessed me...)</p><p><strong>Miyu:</strong><br> (I wouldn&#39;t have thought to hear someone out like that... She acts wicked, but Chloe had the same heart as Illya.)</p><p><strong>Miyu:</strong><br> (That&#39;s why it was Mila and Illya who saved her.<br> And also Chloe, who played with her...)</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> Am I imagining it, or is there a gentle look in Miyu&#39;s eyes? What? Do you see me in a new light or something?</p><p><strong>Miyu:</strong><br> Not at all. I&#39;m going to be billing you for the psychological pain I suffered, Edelfelt-style.</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> That just means you want money!<br> You Edelfelts really are obsessed with money!</p><p><strong>Sapphire:</strong><br> That&#39;s only Luvia and Rin. Miyu has pure and proper ideas about finances.</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> Done making up? Then let&#39;s finish this.</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> I have the First Lady&#39;s jewel now.<br> If I use it for myself, nothing would change, but...</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> If I make a world where wishes can circulate, instead of a closed world for just one person...</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> I get it! So you just have to use the jewels for someone else&#39;s sake, huh?</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> Yes, that&#39;s right. You pick this stuff up fast.</p><p><strong>Ruby:</strong><br> If you add in Nursery&#39;s and Medea&#39;s jewels, and the one from Mash, that&#39;s three of them!</p><p><strong>Ruby:</strong><br> The magical energy is flowing through them equally, and now we can go back to our old world!</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> Um... Does that mean we each take a jewel?</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> Illya uses one for Miyu, Miyu uses one for me, and I use one for Illya.</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> We all face the other person and wish that they&#39;ll be able to go home?</p><p><strong>Miyu:</strong><br> Is it that easy? That seems too easy...</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> Don&#39;t think about it too hard!<br> Let&#39;s just focus on going home, Miyu!</p><p><strong>Miyu:</strong><br> Y-Yeah...<br> If you say so, Illya...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Helena. Are you staying here?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> You&#39;re going to take the First Lady&#39;s place, and serve as host to the magical girls who come here?</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> Yes. I&#39;ll work to be the best I can.</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> I&#39;m sure I can find Medb and Nursery&#39;s Echoes as well.</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> Also, Medea. If she&#39;d stop being depressed and cheer up, she&#39;d be good to have around.</p><p><strong>Mini Edison:</strong><br> Indeed. When you say you&#39;ll work at something, I know you&#39;re going to commit youself to it your whole life.</p><p><strong>Mini Edison:</strong><br> But this world is unstable.<br> It will probably fall apart eventually.</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> Maybe. The end will come someday.</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> And when it does, I&#39;ll go to some out-of-the-way world and live in a haunted house with the Echoes.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That... Hehe. That sounds kind of fun.<br> Good luck.</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> Of course, Mash Kyrielight.<br> Become a great magical girl, okay?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I&#39;m a Demi-Servant!</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> Hahaha...</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> Fujimaru, Mash.</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> You are very nice people, so I was scared to bring it up, but...</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> You&#39;ve been fighting for your world for a long time now. And risking your life.</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> I could tell from your conversation with Mr. Romani.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> You have a far more important tasks than I do, but you saved me, Chloe, and Miyu anyway.</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> That&#39;s not something you could do on a whim.<br> Look, Fujimaru is smiling like it&#39;s a joke again, though.</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> You&#39;re suffering more than anyone, but you can still offer help to others. That&#39;s a miracle that no magic could create.</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> Only someone like that can save the world.</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> Come on, Chloe. You&#39;ve got something to say too, right?</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> I&#39;m sorry for causing you trouble,<br> Mash, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> You guys have it rough, but don&#39;t stress out too much.</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> You could be more polite, Chloe!<br> Jeez...</p><p><strong>Miyu:</strong><br> Fujimaru. I&#39;m really grateful.</p><p><strong>Miyu:</strong><br> I... I can&#39;t even imagine what kind of strong will you need to try and save the world.</p><p><strong>Miyu:</strong><br> But you did all this for us anyway.<br> I can really feel your warmth.</p><p><strong>Miyu:</strong><br> You can work so hard to fight for others...<br> I&#39;m sure seeing you do that is what saves people.</p><p><strong>Miyu:</strong><br> I&#39;m sure that that&#39;s what gave this world meaning. That&#39;s... what I think.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You&#39;re so mature, Miyu.</p><p><strong>Miyu:</strong><br> No, I&#39;m a powerless child.<br> I can&#39;t do anything on my own.</p><p><strong>Miyu:</strong><br> I&#39;m useless without Sapphire.</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> I don&#39;t care if you&#39;re a child or a grown-up.</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> If I was going to take a student, I&#39;d choose Miyu.</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> Those two probably can&#39;t even make a satisfactory cup of tea.</p><p><strong>Illya &amp; Chloe:</strong><br> Aw...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> You could probably be a little more selfish.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That&#39;s right. It&#39;s not bad to say what you&#39;re really thinking.</p><p><strong>Miyu:</strong><br> I&#39;m fine.<br> Now that I have Illya and Chloe with me.</p><p><strong>Miyu:</strong><br> Mash, do you ever ask Fujimaru for what you want?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Huh? I-I...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...I&#39;ll do my best...</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> And it doesn&#39;t count if you rely on alcohol.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> R-Right...</p><hr><p><strong>Ruby:</strong><br> Are you ready, everyone? We&#39;ll be going first.</p><p><strong>Sapphire:</strong><br> Farewell, Helena, Mash, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> I don&#39;t even know how to thank you... Someday I&#39;ll pay you back for this. (Bowing)</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> That would be impossible, Illya.

What about Illya and Miyu and the others?</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> Oh, that? Don&#39;t worry about that, Mash.</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> The other me made it back to my old world with them.</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> That&#39;s the one thing I know for sure.</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> Oh, right.</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> In Chaldea, Fujimaru is the only mage and Master, right?</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> So let me reintroduce myself to my official Master...</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> I am Chloe von Einzbern.
