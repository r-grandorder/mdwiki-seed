I suppose you would call it the path every sentient being travels.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Every single building, every single dish of food... It all contains a vast amount of our ancestors&#39; knowledge.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> In that case, this landscape of destruction represents the end of said path.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> The extravagant buildings, the entertainment, the technology infused within glorious inventions...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> None of that can be found here.<br> A 2,000-year-old obsession crushed them all.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> We have no hope.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> We have no heroes, no brave warriors. We have no way to defeat them because the idea of fighting never even occurred to us.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> So all we can do is pray.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Pray that the Nine Sisters, the goddesses who taught us of civilization and loyalty, visit this world someday.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Senpai...<br> Senpai...

Isn&#39;t that right,<br> Twrch Trwyth!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Twrch Trwyth!?<br> From King Arthur&#39;s legends?</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> Yes, the King of Demon Boars. One who transformed into a boar and ate his way across Britain with his seven piglets.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> Hmph. To think you drifted all the way to a land like this...</p><p><strong>Twrch Trwyth:</strong><br> ...I was once defeated by Arthur, King of Knights.<br> But that brat did not consider me a formidable enemy.</p><p><strong>Twrch Trwyth:</strong><br> He should have treated me like a fellow king... But no!</p><p><strong>Twrch Trwyth:</strong><br> It&#39;s like I was a mere rodent to him the entire time!<br> He bested me and drove me right out of the realm!</p><p><strong>Twrch Trwyth:</strong><br> All just to save the suffering, and to retrieve my giant razor, scissors, and comb!</p><p><strong>Twrch Trwyth:</strong><br> I could never forget such humiliation, even after 2,000 or even 3,000 years!</p><p><strong>Twrch Trwyth:</strong><br> I wandered all over and finally ended up on this island.<br> I embraced the Holy Grail and, by doing so, became a behemoth fit to be a divine beast.</p><p><strong>Twrch Trwyth:</strong><br> In other words, I became Twrch Trwyth...!!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> A mecha!</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Good god!

He has fallen into the oblivion between both.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> Either way, I never thought I would encounter a legendary demonic beast in a place like this!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> We will not let you disrupt the lives of the boar piglets.

Just as it&#39;s only natural that you&#39;d die here too.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> That was your fate from the moment you first decided to steal.</p><p><strong>Twrch Trwyth:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> Do not hate us, Twrch Trwyth! That would be a pathetic end for one who became a divine beast.</p><p><strong>Twrch Trwyth:</strong><br> I see... Now that you mention it...

I&#39;m ready!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Sound echoes in the cave. You can tell how good their teamwork is just by listening.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Is something wrong?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> You&#39;re good too, Altria!</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> I can say this because they&#39;re not here, but their teamwork is impressive.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> Even I admit it.<br> Those two are like one being.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> They trust each other with their lives\u2013 and that creates a greater power than they each have on their own.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> That&#39;s what it means to have a true partner, I suppose.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You had comrades too, Altria.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> What about the Knights of the Round Table?</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> The Round Table... They were trusted comrades, but they were knights, and I was their king.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> They were different than partners.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Did you want a partner?</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> No. I&#39;m simply observing at something I don&#39;t have.<br> A king does not desire a partner.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> ...Perhaps I had something similar, at one time, in a world different from this one.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> Someone with whom I fought side-by-side.<br> Someone I would have called a partner.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> There&#39;s someone here who could be your partner.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> ...!</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> Yes, you&#39;re right. I&#39;m a king, but I&#39;m also just a Servant.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> Master, if I could become a partner you can build a trusting relationship with... That would be truly wonderful.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I-I&#39;m here too! I think you can have that kind of relationship with three people!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I mean, I may be a Demi-Servant, so strictly speaking, um...</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> That&#39;s right. You&#39;re here too, Mash.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> Now, let&#39;s work together, like partners, so that we don&#39;t let the other side beat us!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> We&#39;re in an open area! This is...</p><p><strong>Anne:</strong><br> Oh my...</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong><br> Oh, I guess it connected to the same place.</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong><br> Who got here first?</p><p><strong>Anne:</strong><br> It was us, right?</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> Wait. The tip of my gun entered this space first.<br> The victor is clear as day.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> (She really is competitive...)</p><p><strong>Anne:</strong><br> The deciding factor has to be whose body entered first. And since I jumped forward, that means my\u2013</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> Tch!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> F-Forget that!<br> Look over there!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou!</p><p><strong>Boar Piglet:</strong><br> Piggy!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> A poisonous swamp at the back of the cave!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes, and\u2013</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong><br> There&#39;s two of them!</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong><br> Oh... The boar piglets probably remembered both of their scents. That&#39;s how we got here.</p><p><strong>Anne:</strong><br> They&#39;re coming... We&#39;ll have to fight both of them together, but we should be able to handle them!</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong><br> No problem. We can do it.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> Of course, I&#39;ll fight too!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Time for some teamwork!</p><p><strong>Anne:</strong><br> ...!</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong><br> ...!</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> ...!</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong><br> Hehe. You&#39;re right.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes. Let&#39;s show them the power of partnership!</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> I guess you remembered.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That&#39;s right.<br> The demon boars ran off during the battle.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou!</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> Right. We couldn&#39;t bring things to an end, but they stopped using this cave as a home, and peace was restored.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Does that mean there&#39;s nothing left in this cave?</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> No, not at all... In fact, it looks like our 2,000-year-old battle is about to resume!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Demon boars...?</p><p><strong>G\uFF1AAnne?:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>H\uFF1AMary?:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> You two...?</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Fou, I know.<br> Those two are not them.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> Anne Bonny.<br> Mary Read.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> ...They took their forms, then?</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> They kept the memory of their defeat, and now they&#39;ve managed to recreate it.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> But...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> They didn&#39;t copy you, Altria.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Master... Don&#39;t say that!</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> That&#39;s right. Absolutely right.<br> Why not me?</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> Those two pirates count as one Servant.<br> Were they chosen because of their number?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Altria may not look it, but she&#39;s actually one of the most powerful Servants of all...</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> Demon boars, you&#39;re about to learn that you made a fatal mistake!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> She really is competitive!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> Okay, Master!<br> This time we killed them for sure!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You&#39;re the best, Altria!</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> Of course I am.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> I may be limited with the sacred sword, I may not be a Saber... But even so, there&#39;s no doubt I&#39;m still the best Servant around.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> I&#39;m glad that you understand that, Master. Yes.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> At any rate, we were able to liberate this cave, too.</p><p><strong>C\uFF1ABoar Piglet:</strong><br> Maybe there&#39;ll be a mineral vein or something, yup.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1ABoar Piglet:</strong><br> It feels like we&#39;ll find jewels or something, yup.</p><p><strong>E\uFF1ABoar Piglet:</strong><br> Jewel, oh jewel, who&#39;s the happiest of them all?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> As usual, the boar piglets don&#39;t engage their brains before they speak...</p><h2 id="brilliant-summer-legend-of-the-21st-century-savior" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#brilliant-summer-legend-of-the-21st-century-savior" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Brilliant Summer - Legend of the 21st Century Savior -</h2><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> We&#39;re almost there, Martha.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> I see.<br> So these are the ruins Beowulf holds dominion over.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes!
