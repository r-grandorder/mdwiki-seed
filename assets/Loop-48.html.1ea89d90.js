Talking to you here will have no effect whatsoever on the me that is outside.</p><p>...People like Emiya Shirou and Tohsaka Rin, who were there from the start, will retain memories in the form of dreams or deja vu, but my memories will stay here.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CHmmm.

We cannot touch each other, but I am a real entity nevertheless.</p><p>You, of all people, should know that well. How many times have you been pierced with my claws now?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CI see. Now that you mention it, that&#39;s the kind of relationship we had, isn&#39;t it</p><p>...Mmhmm. So isn&#39;t it kind of hard for you now? You seem rather vague.</p><p>I imagine it must be unbearable.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CI-I am putting my utmost effort into enduring it right now.</p><p>...Please do not worry about me.

That&#39;s a nice name, isn&#39;t it.\u201D</p><p>I say something I don&#39;t really think.</p><hr><p>\u201CYes.

Soon I&#39;ll stop coming to here, you know\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><p>There is no need to say. No need to ask.</p><p>No need to wonder why.</p><p>\u201CAre you going to live like that from now on, too?\u201D</p><p>I am curious at the obvious reply.</p><hr><p>\u201C...Yes. I do not know of any other way.</p><p>If it is my fate, then I am simply to abide by those rules.\u201D</p><p>Hydrangea flower.</p><p>A beautiful song of silver.</p><p>An early dawn prayer battered countlessly by rain.</p><hr><p>\u201CDon&#39;t make me laugh. What, you&#39;re fine with being a living sacrifice?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CIt may be harsh, but it is a meaningful sacrifice.</p><p>I don&#39;t grieve for the irrationality of the fact that I am alone. Victims of possession will be saved by my body.\u201D</p><hr><p>Only those other people will be saved by that.</p><p>It won&#39;t be just the anguish of cutting open flesh.</p><p>The organs, destroyed from the inside out, will become altogether useless.</p><p>Those dull golden eyes, too.</p><p>Along with her right thigh, which is incapable of even running.</p><p>Even her pliant fingertips that were playing a prayer just now.</p><p>Sooner or later, they will all cease to function ever again.</p><hr><p>And yet she says she is fine with that.</p><p>Taking it all in like some kind of idiot.</p><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015Crap.

I don&#39;t care. It&#39;s going to be a battle of strength then. I entwine her legs and get closer to the beat.</p><p>It is more entangling than embracing.</p><hr><p>Entwining the woman&#39;s flesh, arms, legs and torso.</p><p>Everywhere beneath her robes is soft. Pressing down, my fingers readily sink into her breasts, stomach and buttocks. Hah, I thought she had barely any flesh, but she&#39;s actually pretty fine.</p><hr><p>\u201C..., ah\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><p>Our bodies pressed together, I force my lips onto hers, contorting the shape, and pour all of my foreign self into her mouth.</p><p>\u201CNo, don&#39;t...!\u201D</p><p>I grasp her jaw and force her teeth open.</p><p>To melt her from the inside, I pour in my sopping heat.</p><hr><p>\u201Ckh......!\u201D</p><p>Though it is only a mouth, the fact that it&#39;s the inside of a living being does not change.</p><p>We make sloppy sounds and exchange tongues.</p><p>Our taste sensing organs greedily sample each other&#39;s fluids.</p><hr><p>\u201CHah... Nn, nnaa, nn...!\u201D</p><p>Her breath is mixed with resistance and embarrassment.</p><p>Though a truly feminine response, it&#39;s not as if I wished for that.</p><p>What I wanted was desperate and meaningless destruction.</p><hr><p>I let our fluids bubble and entwine together, our tongues on the verge of dissolving.</p><p>Wheezing from lack of oxygen, her attempts to breathe stimulate my tongue and send a numbing sense of lewdness down my spine.</p><p>Raw.</p><p>I tussle and get jostled in her mouth, pouring in everything and stealing away everything.</p><hr><p>\u201CHaa\u2015\u2015\u2015nn, kh\u2015\u2015\u2015kh!\u201D</p><p>There is neither love nor pleasure.</p><p>It is simply an action to violate the woman, a pact to force her into submission.</p><hr><p>To a demon, intimidation is that kind of a thing.</p><p>To drag out her soul and to drive in my life force.</p><p>Not to switch it out, but to stain completely.</p><p>A sexual act beginning with the desire to destroy that human being.</p><p>In the case of a creature who knows only hate\u2015\u2015\u2015I guess you could call it lust.</p><hr><p>\u201CHah, ah...! Please let go of me, I already said we can&#39;t touch each other...!\u201D</p><p>She struggles to untangle the arms that I&#39;ve seized.</p><p>It&#39;s not just an act of self-defense.</p><p>It&#39;s dangerous to even stay close. If we keep touching like this, the woman&#39;s endurance will falter and she will likely pierce through me.</p><hr><p>\u201CControl yourself. It&#39;s not like you&#39;re some cat in heat, stop getting all turned on by yourself.\u201D</p><p>\u201C...What are, you...\u201D</p><p>&quot;planning to do,&quot; or something cute along those lines.</p><p>No need to even say it at this point.</p><hr><p>\u201CWhat do you mean, &quot;what&quot;? I&#39;m going to violate you now.\u201D</p><p>\u201C...Why? You said you have no such desires before.\u201D</p><p>\u201CWho knows. It seems to be the same as an appetite. Kind of like eating when you&#39;re hungry. I was simply\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><p>Something finally snapped inside me, and I just had to hold this woman.</p><hr><p>\u201C...!\u201D</p><p>I twist the seized arms.</p><p>I hold that hated woman to my chest.</p><p>\u201CNo... with the current you, my body, it will...\u201D</p><p>Give in and murder me, huh?</p><p>Something like that matters not at this time.</p><p>If you&#39;re going to kill me, then kill me. If I&#39;m going to die, then I&#39;ll die, I&#39;m fine with it.</p><hr><p>\u201CYeah, okay. You have to take what you&#39;re given, right? I&#39;m like you, too. We&#39;re two of a kind, and I&#39;m going to have you keep me company until the end.\u201D</p><p>\u201C...!\u201D</p><p>I pick up her bandaged body and ascend the stairs.</p><hr><p>\u201CAh... ya, ah, hah...!\u201D</p><p>The woman seems to be restraining her body with all her might.</p><p>Making no effort to resist my hold, she grits her teeth painfully.</p><p>...My mind fills with violent emotion.</p><p>All the human reasoning I&#39;ve managed to keep together until now is collapsing.</p><hr><p>Just as this woman holds back the effects of possession, I am stopping my mind from crumbling altogether.</p><p>The woman&#39;s problem is simply her body.</p><p>On my end, the issue is my troublesome heart.</p><p>She is only concerned with the transfiguration of her body. The fact that I&#39;m about to violate her doesn&#39;t seem to bother her at all.</p><p>Like a scapegoat harlot. Complying with all desires.</p><hr><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Your body&#39;s gonna split open, huh?</p><p>Alright, it&#39;s a contest of endurance. It&#39;ll be interesting to see who breaks first.\u201D</p><p>...The moment I said it, it finally hit me.</p><p>My brain feels like it would crack at the hatred and desire.</p><p>If she says I can mess her up, I shall grant that wish.</p><hr><p>Up the narrow staircase to the woman&#39;s room.</p><p>As expected, a wholly uninteresting, gray room.</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015Haa... haa... haa...\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>The woman idly falls into disarray.</p><p>Perhaps enduring the pain of being ripped from the inside, or maybe fearing the terror being introduced from the outside.</p><p>There&#39;s no point in guessing.</p><p>Regardless of which it is, the agony will only intensify.</p><hr><p>\u201CWhat a boring room.</p><p>But, I see\u2015\u2015\u2015that light was from your room, huh?\u201D</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015Ah... ha... ah... ah... ha\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><p>She doesn&#39;t have the strength to resist, either.</p><p>The woman is desperately trying to bear the pain while being held.</p><hr><p>\u201CDon&#39;t put on such airs.

I doubt the answer is &quot;nothing.&quot;</p><p>Whenever Emiya Shirou died, he was surrounded by demons.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CHah... What, are you, trying to say?\u201D</p><p>A hoarse voice.</p><p>It&#39;s as if she&#39;s a feverish patient on the verge of death. And yet she cuts in despite that.</p><hr><p>\u201CNothing, really. I&#39;m just asking if you&#39;re a chaste sister, not blaming you.</p><p>I&#39;m just stating the truth.

I, won&#39;t stop it, anymore.\u201D</p><p>That&#39;s not sentiment I can share.</p><p>Both of us are well lubricated by now, but our feelings differ.</p><p>\u201CAh... yu...n, ah, one, more, time\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><p>Interlocking sensations.

It was nothing more than a whim. I&#39;ve done what I wanted to, all that&#39;s left is to go away.\u201D</p><hr><p>One hell of a murderous intent.</p><p>The sort of glare that would likely result in me being stabbed if there were any sharp objects around.</p><p>Thus, it would be best to leave as fast as possible.</p><hr><p>\u201CWell, just think of it as being bitten by a dog or something.</p><p>Either way, this is the end. I won&#39;t have any more to do with you, so you could even think of this as a parting gift.\u201D</p><p>I leave the stone chamber.</p><p>I retreat before having my true colors revealed any further.</p><hr><p>\u201CStop. That isn&#39;t even an excuse.</p><p>...I&#39;ll change my question. Why did you stop?</p><p>I thought I would be consumed at that rate.\u201D</p><p>\u201CBah, that&#39;s what you wanted!?</p><p>But I apologize, I slipped out of consciousness, so I don&#39;t remember.\u201D</p><p>\u201CAvoiding the worst, I see... I, who posed you the question, was utterly foolish.\u201D</p><hr><p>The woman lets me pass, clearly not in the mood to ever see me again.</p><p>..................Now then,</p><p>before her mind changes and I get punished,\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000so that the two of us,</p><p>never meet again, I depart.</p><hr><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015Ah. But come to think of it, why&#39;d <em>you</em> do that, anyway?\u201D</p><p>A simple question.</p><p>\u201CNothing, really. I just thought it would be good to be gifted with your child.\u201D</p><p>A quiet reply.</p><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><p>I force my suddenly heavy legs to move and go towards the stairs.</p><hr><p>\u201CNow that is a joke.

You don&#39;t seem to have any abilities worth recognizing in the first place, anyway.\u201D</p><p>That&#39;s for certain.</p><p>I bring our chance encounter to an end while smirking at the unforgiving woman&#39;s words.</p><hr><p>\u201CSee ya.

Now go and repent, beast.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015With that, the guidepost to the surface disappears.</p><p>No more will I, the regular visitor, appear here again.</p><hr>', 865);
