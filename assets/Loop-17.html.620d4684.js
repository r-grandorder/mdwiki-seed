Not that there was anything wrong, I mean.\u201D</p><p>\u201CWho cares, as long as she&#39;s got the looks.\u201D</p><p>\u201C...Did I see that right? Her ears looked kind of... long...\u201D</p><hr><p>I come to a halt.</p><p>I&#39;m pretty sure I have a good idea of how many good-looking foreigners there are around town. But, ones that could come here?</p><hr><p>I wanted to ask about the details, but the bunch disappeared towards the other end of the hallway before I could get a chance.</p><p>Issei, who was walking alongside, has stopped as well.</p><hr><p>\u201CWhat is it, Issei?\u201D</p><p>\u201COh, nothing. I was a little bothered by what the group just now said.\u201D</p><p>\u201CIt sure is surprising to see you bothered by such gossip.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CNo, it&#39;s just that... something about that caught my attention.</p><p>However, it is not a matter that shall require action on my part.\u201D</p><p>With a nod, he just accepts whatever he accepts and walks away in a hurry.</p><hr><p>I ought to follow his example and get going, but it still keeps bothering me.</p><p>\u201C...I should go ask, after all.\u201D</p><p>\u201CBoss, the investigation has been completed.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CAaack!\u201D</p><p>Someone suddenly starts talking to me.</p><p>Startled, I see Goto-kun, my classmate, appear with an opened student planner in his hand.</p><p>...Seems like he watched another detective TV drama yesterday.</p><hr><p>\u201CThe target&#39;s features are as follows: foreigner and a beauty. When asked about their impression, the witnesses testified that she looks stylish and with a purple hue.\u201D</p><p>There&#39;s nothing written down in the planner, but he recites it with no hesitation.</p><hr><p>\u201CPurple...?\u201D</p><p>No way, could it be Rider?</p><hr><p>\u201CGoto-kun, where was the target spotted?\u201D</p><p>\u201CLet&#39;s see... the witnesses report that she has come in through the main entrance and was heading down the first floor hallway.\u201D</p><p>So the target is moving.

I&#39;ll be there even if I&#39;m late.\u201D</p><p>\u201CUnderstood!\u201D</p><p>Goto-kun responds with a salute. I throw a glance at him and go down the stairs.</p><hr><p>It did not take long to reach the objective.</p><p>Frankly, I was originally going to turn right around and hurry back to the classroom, but I could not just abandon a person in trouble.</p><p>Issei&#39;s fleeting doubt was Caster.</p><hr><p>But she sure does stand out. She&#39;s not doing anything outright suspicious, she&#39;s just conspicuous. And very much so.</p><p>Not sure of her destination, she checks the room numbers one by one as she walks down the hallway.</p><hr><p>\u201COh come on, Caster.\u201D</p><p>\u201COh my, it&#39;s the boy from Saber&#39;s place.\u201D</p><p>Caster seems unfazed, but I&#39;m feeling quite tense myself.</p><p>...Right about now, people are saying, &quot;Who is that?&quot;, &quot;It&#39;s Emiya from third year.&quot;, &quot;It&#39;s him again!&quot;, &quot;Why does the universe revolve around him?&quot;, &quot;Let&#39;s get to killing him now.&quot; and so forth...</p><hr><p>\u201C...So, what are you doing?

Why would you need to go to the staff room anyway?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CIt can&#39;t be helped. It all looks the same everywhere, so I never really paid attention to the details. What a bother.\u201D</p><p>\u201C..................\u201D</p><p>She complains with a sigh.</p><p>Just now, I finally got a glimpse of her true character.</p><hr><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015What are you doing, Emiya?</p><p>The bell rang. Return to class.\u201D</p><p>\u201CSouichirou-sama.\u201D</p><p>Whether he had a first-year class or just overheard the noise we were making, Kuzuki-sensei has silently appeared out of nowhere.</p><hr><p>\u201CI have come to bring your lunch, Souichirou-sama!\u201D</p><p>\u201CIs that so? Thanks.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CIt was a busy morning... I did not notice that you had left it behind, I&#39;m sorry.\u201D</p><p>\u201CNo, I was negligent, too.\u201D</p><p>With both hands, Kuzuki-sensei receives the lunchbox wrapped in a fancy kerchief. For a moment, the two gaze at each other, lunchbox between them.</p><hr><p>Caster&#39;s passionate eyes, aimed at Kuzuki-sensei. Kuzuki-sensei, looking at the lunchbox. Suddenly, Caster looks down, bringing her hands together in front of her.</p><hr><p>\u201CI understand you are busy, but since it has been prepared, wasting it... and also, I thought you may be troubled by having to purchase and have your lunch alone...\u201D</p><p>\u201CI see.\u201D</p><p>Well, I saw him wolfing down a yakisoba bread a while back.</p><p>The image of Kuzuki-sensei with a lunchbox prepared with loving care by his wife just doesn&#39;t seem to fit.</p><hr><p>\u201CToday&#39;s side dish is fried lotus root.\u201D</p><p>\u201C...Hm.\u201D</p><p>Oh? That was Toyoetsu&#39;s special yesterday.</p><hr><p>\u201CAnd cherry tomatoes, pickled in honey lemon.\u201D</p><p>\u201C...Oh?\u201D</p><p>Yeah, that too.</p><hr><p>\u201CLast time, I bought a little too much, but you ate it all up and I thought you must have taken a liking to it\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><p>\u201CIndeed.\u201D</p><p>No, which is it? Did he like it or not?</p><hr><p>But you did well in buying that, Mrs. Magical Lady.</p><p>Right. The side dish shops at Toyoetsu are extremely popular with housewives, and always go out of stock by one in the afternoon. Did she camp out there?</p><hr><p>\u201CBy the way, Souichirou-sama. Would you mind if I took a moment of your time?\u201D</p><p>Kuzuki-sensei nods.</p><p>I see, he wasn&#39;t actually going to class, but just happened to be passing by.</p><p>\u201CUm, actually...\u201D</p><hr><p>I finally notice that Caster is glaring at me.</p><p>\u201C...What is it, boy? Why don&#39;t you go home if you&#39;re done here?\u201D</p><p>\u201COh, I have class.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CThen why don&#39;t you get to it? Don&#39;t just stand there staring like a stray cow.\u201D</p><p>\u201COkay, okay, I got it.\u201D</p><p>Definitely my bad. It was me who stopped her in the first place!</p><hr><p>\u201CNow, shoo, shoo.\u201D</p><p>I don&#39;t care about Caster, but let&#39;s get going before I get scolded by Kuzuki-sensei as well.</p><hr><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015Souichirou-sama.</p><p>Now that I ended up visiting your workplace, perhaps I should go and introduce myself to your hard-working colleagues, if that is alright... Um, so the staff room...\u201D</p><p>\u201CI will lead you there.\u201D</p><p>Kuzuki-sensei turns around abruptly.</p><hr><p>\u201C...Y-Yes. B-But I was so preoccupied with making the lunch that I have not prepared even a single gift\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><p>I, I really should do it next time!\u201D</p><p>\u201CIt doesn&#39;t matter. There is no need to worry about that.\u201D</p><p>\u201CY-Yes. I shall gladly take your kind offer.\u201D</p><hr><p>With a reddened face, as if trying to hide behind Kuzuki-sensei&#39;s back, Caster follows along.</p><p>Still apologizing, she&#39;s straightening her hair frantically while looking in a mirror. I&#39;m deeply impressed by a woman&#39;s desire to not cause any embarrassment for her dear husband.</p><p>Caster making her appearance in the teachers&#39; lounge... impressive indeed.</p><hr><p>\u201CAs far as conversations go, just having a beautiful wife show up is a gift in itself.\u201D</p><p>\u201CYeah. This will be a hot topic for the whole week... eh...?\u201D</p><p>My head that was about to turn stiffens up.</p><p>The unforgiving, all-scathing Tiger Claw!</p><hr><p>\u201COooh, boy\u2015\u2015\u2015!</p><p>Neglecting a class that&#39;s more important than your own life, just because of a single rumor about a wandering beauty... Your teacher won&#39;t overlook this!\u201D</p><p>The voice alone sends goosebumps crawling all over my skin.</p><hr><p>\u201CUh, no, this is, is just, that grip, m-my head, have mercy, p-police\u201D</p><p>\u201CMm\uFF5Ehmm\uFF5E? Your brain huurts?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CQ-Question, head chief!\u201D</p><p>\u201CWhat is it?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CW-What happened to Goto-kun, my backup!?\u201D</p><p>\u201CIdiot.

I&#39;d like to have a word with you in the classroom.\u201D</p><p>\u201C?\u201D</p><p>Fuji-Nee stops me, a serious look on her face.</p><p>At times like this, she&#39;s &quot;Fujimura-sensei.&quot; As one of her students, it would be wrong for me not to respond with the same.</p><hr><p>\u201CWhat is it, Fujimura-sensei?\u201D</p><p>\u201CIt&#39;s not &quot;what.&quot;</p><p>Emiya-kun, I bet you still haven&#39;t decided what college you&#39;re going to attend.

Um, I still need more time, would that be okay?\u201D</p><p>\u201CThat&#39;s no good. I want it submitted by the end of the day. The only seniors who haven&#39;t done it yet are you and Makidera-san. Get yours in before her.</p><p>Well, even if it&#39;s kind of a makeshift one, I can overlook that.\u201D</p><p>&quot;Here you go,&quot; she takes out the &quot;Higher Education Aspirations&quot; report form.</p><hr><p>\u201C...By &quot;makeshift,&quot; you mean just fill out the lines with something?\u201D</p><p>\u201CThat&#39;s right. Being your teacher and your guardian gives me a headache. But if you don&#39;t write that report, it&#39;ll be off to the principal&#39;s office with you.\u201D</p><p>Fujimura-sensei, I mean, Fuji-Nee, breathes a deep sigh of exasperation.</p><hr><p>\u201CGot it. Alright, I&#39;ll think it over.\u201D</p><p>\u201CGood. Since I have the time, I&#39;m going to accompany you until sunset.\u201D</p><p>About that...</p><p>Until last year, I thought I&#39;d go to a local university, but a lot of things have happened since then.</p><p>She said it could just be a makeshift one, but isn&#39;t this supposed to be a pretty serious report...?</p><hr><p>After getting lost a few times, I finally manage to fill out the whole &quot;Higher Education Aspirations&quot; form as sincerely as I can.</p><hr><p>\u201CSorry for the wait.

Is there a reason?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CIt&#39;s not that I lost interest, it&#39;s just that other priorities had become more important.</p><p>Like, they all have some percentage... I guess that&#39;s no good?\u201D</p><p>\u201CCertainly not the clear answer I&#39;d like to hear. Is &quot;undecided&quot; also a percentage? Working after graduation?\u201D</p><p>\u201CIf I find a good place, I&#39;d like to work, but I may be spreading myself too thin trying to be useful everywhere.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CHmph... Okay, so what&#39;s with number two, &quot;study abroad&quot;? Shirou, your English grades are nothing to write home about. Listening, you may get around with. But pronunciation will be a lot of work, right?</p><p>I don&#39;t get it. Why would you study abroad? Is it Tohsaka-san&#39;s influence?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CUh, not so much &quot;influence&quot; as it is &quot;resolution.&quot; If I really put an effort into studying, someday I won&#39;t have to rely on Tohsaka anymore. And so I thought I really ought to study the genuine stuff.\u201D</p><p>\u201CI see. By &quot;really put an effort,&quot; you mean like Kiritsugu-san?\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><hr><p>For a moment, I was speechless.</p><p>Wandering from place to place somewhere abroad like dad, is that what she meant?</p><p>Fuji-Nee knows how much I admired Kiritsugu. Better than anyone else, in fact. So when I say &quot;I&#39;ll go abroad&quot; without mentioning Tohsaka, she can guess what it means.</p><hr><p>\u201CWho knows. I don&#39;t know much about it, but mine will be a different path, I think.\u201D</p><p>\u201C...Mmh. I see, so you&#39;ve already decided.\u201D</p><p>And so with &quot;number two it is, then.&quot;</p><p>She puts a red checkmark next to number two on the report form.</p><hr><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><p>The commotion of afterschool club activities in the yard resounds throughout the school.</p><p>And yet the classroom remains lifelessly silent.</p><p>Despite the fact there&#39;s me, sitting at the desk, and Fuji-Nee, standing at her platform and looking at the higher education form, the silence persists.</p><hr><p>\u201CEr, you know... as a teacher, I can&#39;t suppress the students&#39; independence, but can I ask one thing?\u201D</p><p>\u201CSure.\u201D</p><p>That&#39;s...</p><p>\u201CShirou, are you coming back?\u201D</p><p>As if making plans for tomorrow, or maybe yesterday... gazing into the distance.</p><hr><p>\u201C...I&#39;ll be back for sure.

At times of trouble, she can definitely be relied upon.</p><hr><p>\u201CSo the weak point is... groceries, perhaps?\u201D</p><p>\u201C...You saw right through me.\u201D</p><p>She nods dejectedly.</p><p>Seeing such a beauty hang her head, feelings of guilt overcome me.</p><hr><p>\u201CBut you do have a list, right?\u201D</p><p>\u201CYes, Sakura has kindly made one for me.\u201D</p><p>If you have the list from Sakura, the household&#39;s Kitchen Authority herself, there should be no difficulties...</p><hr><p>\u201CHere it is...\u201D</p><p>Rider shows me her notes.</p><p>In Sakura&#39;s meticulous handwriting, I see a list of &quot;lettuce: 2 heads,&quot; &quot;chicken legs,&quot; and other things.</p><hr><p>\u201COh. This should be pretty simple.\u201D</p><p>\u201CIt may be for you, being able to cook by yourself.</p><p>But for someone as inexperienced as I am, this is just too vague.\u201D</p><p>...?</p><p>You lost me.</p><hr><p>\u201C...Let&#39;s see. For example, tomatoes, over there.\u201D</p><p>Looking in the direction Rider is pointing, I see a bunch of bright-red tomatoes, 3 for 312 or 6 for 530 yen.</p><p>...I guess I&#39;d go for six. Any less than that and it won&#39;t be enough even for a salad... ah, wait.</p><hr><p>\u201CThey come from different places and with different prices. As a result, it is difficult for me to pick the ones that would satisfy Sakura&#39;s expectations.\u201D</p><p>\u201C...Why not just get the ones with the cheapest unit price?\u201D</p><p>Our household isn&#39;t that picky about tomatoes.</p><p>Tohsaka might have an opinion about it, but Sakura certainly wouldn&#39;t.</p><hr><p>\u201CTomatoes and lettuce I can still manage. But when it comes to potatoes, there is Irish cobbler, May Queen, and I am greatly perplexed trying to pick the ones suitable for cooking.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CAnd with meat, there is domestic or foreign-produced. But within domestic, there is Japanese beef and different brands. Finally, there is a whole range of prices per gram, on sale or not. The number of choices astounds me.\u201D</p><p>\u201C...I see. I understand the problem now.\u201D</p><p>In other words, creating a shopping strategy is difficult without a vision of the meal.</p><hr><p>Like, today we&#39;ll have a steak, or maybe a stew.</p><p>For kitchen commanders like me or Sakura, changing and following the new strategy on the spot is easy. But for the rank and file combatants like Rider, deciphering the commanding officers&#39; intentions can cause a great deal of anxiety.</p><hr><p>\u201CI am sorry to trouble you, Shirou.\u201D</p><p>\u201CIt is troublesome, indeed. Ah, but you know...\u201D</p><p>I&#39;ve just remembered about the other Servant in our household.</p><p>She goes shopping quite often, too, yet I don&#39;t recall hearing anything of the sort from her.</p><hr><p>\u201CSaber doesn&#39;t seem to have any problems with grocery shopping, does she?\u201D</p><p>\u201C...Pardon me, but there is one big difference between us.\u201D</p><p>\u201CWhat kind of a difference?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CShe has an excellent appetite. Therefore, she is able to make shopping decisions on an entirely different level.</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015That is, she is able to choose the foods that look most delicious.\u201D</p><p>\u201CYeah\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><p>Simple is best.</p><p>That&#39;s right, Saber possesses a very straightforward kind of grace.</p><p>Of course, that includes the &quot;nevermind the cost&quot; type of grace, as well.</p><hr><p>\u201C...I guess I&#39;ll ask Sakura to make a more specific list next time.\u201D</p><p>\u201CI have received such a list once, but a different problem appeared...\u201D</p><hr><p>Most likely, Rider became worried that she might be buying something different from the list&#39;s specifications.</p><p>No, this problem needs a more drastic solution.</p><hr><p>\u201CYou should also remember what the planned menu is. Then you&#39;ll be able to come up with your own decisions.\u201D</p><p>\u201CI am but a beginner, with no confidence in my sense of taste, unable to match up to you two. Despite the fact that Sakura tells me that I have to...\u201D</p><hr><p>That would be Sakura&#39;s sympathy for a fellow woman, definitely.</p><p>No matter how much I tell Rider to improve her cooking skills, my words simply don&#39;t have enough persuasive power to produce any result.</p><hr><p>\u201C...Alright.</p><p>I have some time to spare, so let&#39;s forget about the menu for now, I&#39;ll just accompany you for a while.\u201D</p><p>\u201C...Is that really okay, Shirou?\u201D</p><p>\u201CYeah. I get to use the stuff in the fridge, too, so it&#39;s better to get it all done together, rather than each on our own.\u201D</p><hr><p>And as we do so, I can try teaching her some of the finer shopping techniques.</p><p>Like choosing vegetables, meat, the right time to look for special sales - there are a lot of small tricks that would make her life easier.</p><hr><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015That is a great help. You have my gratitude, Shirou.\u201D</p><p>Straightening up her back, she bows politely.</p><hr><p>\u201CSome day, I will have the privilege of repaying this favor to you.\u201D</p><p>\u201CThere&#39;s no need to go overboard, it&#39;s just grocery shopping...\u201D</p><p>...I&#39;m feeling slightly embarrassed.</p><p>Having Rider suddenly become timid and rely on me is extremely rare, after all.</p><hr><p>\u201C...What is wrong? Your face is red?\u201D</p><p>\u201CI-It&#39;s nothing.\u201D</p><p>\u201CCould it be that it is the same kind of face that you have while shopping together with Sakura?\u201D</p><p>\u201CI&#39;m telling you, it&#39;s nothing, really!\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C...That is good...</p><p>Then let us take care of this task, starting from the closest one. First, the vegetables...\u201D</p><p>\u201CRight\u2015\u2015\u2015step by step.\u201D</p><hr><h3 id="emiya-s\u30FBday-2-sugar-candy-teatime" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#emiya-s\u30FBday-2-sugar-candy-teatime" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Emiya&#39;s\u30FBDay 2 Sugar candy teatime</h3><hr><p>It&#39;s almost 3 o&#39;clock, let&#39;s make some tea.</p><p>For now, I&#39;ll make enough for myself, then... I guess I&#39;ll invite Sakura or Saber or whoever&#39;s around.</p><hr><p>\u201COh.\u201D</p><p>Great, someone&#39;s in the living room.</p><p>There&#39;s no point in taking a break alone. Whoever that is, let&#39;s join them for a while.</p><hr><p>\u201CHuh? Illya?\u201D</p><p>\u201CGood afternoon. Sorry for a sudden intrusion, Shirou.\u201D</p><p>\u201CMake some noise when you come in, at least I could greet you... Well, whatever. Good timing, we&#39;ll have it together.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CMm? Have what, Shirou?\u201D</p><p>\u201COh, I&#39;m just about to prepare some tea. Sorry for not having a proper welcome.\u201D</p><p>What should I do... She doesn&#39;t care for bitter or spicy stuff, so black tea it is.</p><hr><p>\u201CIt&#39;s okay, just sit down over here.\u201D</p><p>\u201C...?\u201D</p><p>For now, I just do as I&#39;m told.</p><hr><p>\u201CReally, now. Shirou, as the head of the household, you ought to be calm and composed.\u201D</p><p>\u201C...Ugh. Well, that&#39;s...\u201D</p><p>It&#39;s just my opinion, but I thought, as the head of the household, that not greeting a guest is rather impolite.</p><p>Honestly, I don&#39;t think I can sit here all the time, looking proud and important.</p><hr><p>\u201COnii-chan. You said you were going to prepare some tea, right?\u201D</p><p>\u201CY-Yeah. Can&#39;t relax without tea. Ah, would you like a senbei or something?\u201D</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015Wait a minute.</p><p>I&#39;ve noticed something just now.</p><hr><p>There is someone in the kitchen.</p><hr><p>\u201CTea it is\u2015\u2015\u2015Liz.\u201D</p><p>\u201CYes, Illya.\u201D</p><hr><p>Waaahhh!*</p><p>I-It came out! A ghost! I mean, Illya&#39;s housemaid! Why, here!</p><hr><p>\u201CDarjeeling for Shirou, and hot chocolate for me, okay?\u201D</p><p>\u201CYes, understood.\u201D</p><hr><p>The white-clad maid disappears into the kitchen in an instant.</p><p>...I&#39;m speechless.</p><p>It&#39;s no wonder. Having a maid suddenly spring forth from the kitchen would get anyone.</p><hr><p>\u201C...Shirou, what are you so surprised about?\u201D</p><p>\u201CT-T-That, of course! Why are Illya&#39;s maids in my house!?\u201D</p><p>\u201CSee, isn&#39;t it improper for a lady to go out without her escort.\u201D</p><p>Illya smiles radiantly.</p><p>...Not having them would not be proper manners... Just what century are we talking about?</p><hr><p>\u201C...Wait a second, didn&#39;t you say that you don&#39;t actually like having a maid escort with you?\u201D</p><p>\u201CWhen I come just for fun, yes.</p><p>But they&#39;re quite useful at times like these, don&#39;t you think?\u201D</p><p>\u201CUh... Well, but this...\u201D</p><hr><p>Peeking inside the kitchen... they really are hustling around the kitchen noisily, taking care of various chores.</p><p>The surrealism of the sight makes me slightly dizzy. The high-class dignified maid clothes from the castle are far too showy for this house. Heck, they look like the household masters themselves.</p><hr><p>\u201CWhat is it? Hmmmm, Shirou, could it be that...\u201D</p><p>\u201C.........\u201D</p><p>\u201C...The kitchen is your turf, and you don&#39;t like others intruding on it?\u201D</p><p>\u201CEh...?\u201D</p><hr><p>...Now that she mentions it, that&#39;s not it at all.</p><p>With everyone&#39;s using the kitchen, there&#39;s no way I&#39;d get possessive over it...</p><hr><p>\u201CHeheh. Sella and Liz are complete strangers to you, so they are liable to rise the intruder alert, aren&#39;t they?</p><p>Sakura is part of the family, so you don&#39;t mind her.\u201D</p><p>\u201C...I see. Indeed, that may be it. Had it been you, I probably wouldn&#39;t mind, either.\u201D</p><p>Illya in the kitchen... Well, she may be a little short.</p><p>While I&#39;m thinking, a white shadow materializes nearby.</p><hr><p>\u201CMilady, the tea is ready.\u201D</p><p>\u201CHere, Illya. Be careful. Hot.\u201D</p><p>Liz, the maid that has difficulty with language, places the cup in front of Illya.</p><p>But... when did our household get such high-class saucers?</p><hr><p>And now, to my side,</p><p>\u201C...Emiya-sama.\u201D</p><p>\u201CAh, right...\u201D</p><p>Sella, the training chief, and by no exaggeration Einzbern Castle&#39;s greatest threat, is now attending to me.</p><hr><p>\u201CEmiya-sama. As a sign of friendship with this household, here is highest grade Autumnal Flush Darjeeling, received from the Thurbo plantation in fall of this year.\u201D</p><p>\u201CAutu... what?\u201D</p><p>Guh... I might hold my own when it comes to Japanese tea, but this black tea attack, striking my weakest spot, was totally out of the blue...!</p><hr><p>\u201CProperly speaking, it is a special tea reserved for no one but the head of the household, or, possibly, family relatives and long-time friends.</p><p>Therefore, Emiya Shirou-sama.\u201D</p><p>\u201CWha, what the heck. That&#39;s got to be one expensive tea.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CHow abject. The price is not an issue.</p><p>This does not need to be said, but being served this tea is a sign of the lady&#39;s kindness.</p><p>Very well, Emiya Shirou-sama.</p><p>In order for this trust to never be betrayed, I will carefully speak of Milady&#39;s feelings.\u201D</p><p>\u201C..............................\u201D</p><p>Not given many options, am I?</p><p>To be lectured before being given tea, who&#39;d have thought.</p><hr><p>Illya is grinning broadly.</p><p>Is it that much fun seeing me being lectured... I guess it is.</p><hr><p>\u201COh... Well, I humbly accept your kind offer.\u201D</p><p>Despite drinking tea in my own home, I still feel guilty.</p><p>...Even I can tell that this is high-grade tea.</p><p>The aroma is very delicate, straight yet perfectly smooth, and sweet.</p><hr><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015Oh, and Shirou?</p><p>I did have them bring it today, but it&#39;s really no big deal. It&#39;s not like we keep this grade of leaf in special reserve.\u201D</p><p>\u201C...That helps. And sorry for the low-grade stuff up to now.\u201D</p><hr><p>Having once proudly offered bargain-bin genmaicha to Illya, who is used to this kind of excellence, I am now quite embarrassed.</p><p>Moreover... I just can&#39;t relax while I&#39;m surrounded by Sella and Liz.</p><hr><p>\u201CShirou? You want dessert as well, don&#39;t you?\u201D</p><p>\u201CUh... Y-Yeah... Don&#39;t tell me you&#39;ve prepared that, too?\u201D</p><p>\u201CYes, naturally. Sella, Liz.\u201D</p><hr><p>The maids, standing by until now, resume their work.</p><p>As soon as the two of them disappear back into the kitchen, I unconsciously let out a sigh of relief.</p><hr><p>\u201CAhaha. Oh you, getting so nervous.\u201D</p><p>\u201C...Of course. First time I&#39;m drinking tea while being attended by a maid and all... Ah.\u201D</p><p>I kind of understand why Illya would want to go out alone now.</p><p>She is used to the ever-present maids by now, but from time to time, she still needs to have a taste of freedom without them around.</p><hr><p>\u201CHuh... You must have it tough, too.\u201D</p><p>\u201CKind of. Although Sella&#39;s nagging is not as bad as it used to be, I&#39;m still busy learning proper lady-like manners and whatnot.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C...Sella is sure into it. She wants you to grow up as a fine lady, no doubt.\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015I know.</p><p>Got to grow bigger and live up to Sella&#39;s expectation, for sure.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CIllya, want more?\u201D</p><p>\u201CNo, this is fine. Liz, make sure Onii-chan gets a big one.\u201D</p><p>\u201CMilady, those kinds of nicknames\u2015\u2015\u2015no. Emiya Shirou-sama, here is a triple berry pie from La Fleur.\u201D</p><hr><p>Ooh.</p><p>The pie, having appeared out of nowhere, is adorned with whipped cream and all sorts of berries.</p><p>This is what Tohsaka calls a &quot;very-very-berry&quot; one... Sure enough, there&#39;s plenty of red on it.</p><p>Illya wastes no time attacking it with her fork. I guess she doesn&#39;t mind the red part.</p><hr><p>\u201COnce again, this happens to be the lady&#39;s favorite.</p><p>Please make sure not to leave any of it behind, either, Emiya-sama.\u201D</p><p>\u201CY-Yeah... So I&#39;ve been wondering, Sella...\u201D</p><p>\u201CWhat would that be, Emiya Shirou-sama?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CUm, I mean... We&#39;re not at the castle, so shouldn&#39;t it be alright to take it easy here?</p><p>You look all tense and stiff, always standing still by the side, you know?\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CAh, it&#39;s true... Sella, cold?\u201D</p><p>\u201CLeysritt...!\u201D</p><p>\u201CAhaha. Yeah, maybe you should go for onsen therapy.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CMilady... I am grateful for your attention to my body, however, I am Milady&#39;s attendant. Please make sure you take good care of yourself, as well.\u201D</p><p>Poking fun is not enough to perturb this mind of steel.</p><p>Truly, the perfect maid.</p><hr><p>\u201C...Ahem.</p><p>Emiya-sama, regarding your question. My shoulders are not particularly stiff, therefore, there is no need for this kind of concern.\u201D</p><p>\u201CO-Okay... Alright then, I will gladly dig in.\u201D</p><hr><p>I stick my fork into the mountain of berries... but having these two stare at me from the side is kind of unnerving, after all.</p><p>Here goes another one...</p><hr><p>\u201CHey, aren&#39;t you guys going to eat, too?\u201D</p><p>\u201CNo, we are not. Servants are not meant to eat at the same table as their master.\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015Nein, danke.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CIs that so...\u201D</p><p>Another failure.</p><p>...Illya seems to be enjoying it, though.</p><p>Watching me get embarrassed is quite entertaining, no doubt.</p><p>\u201C..................\u201D</p><p>However, at this rate, my fork just isn&#39;t making progress...</p><hr><p>\u201CHm? Is something troubling you, Shirou?\u201D</p><p>\u201C...Well, yes. I feel as if I&#39;m held captive in my own home.\u201D</p><p>\u201CWhat a waste of good tea and cake. Sella, Liz, step outside. I will call for you when needed.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CYes, Illya.\u201D</p><p>\u201CWe shall await your orders, Milady.\u201D</p><hr><p>The moment the white-clad maids were gone, the living room suddenly felt much larger.</p><p>I breathe a deep sigh of relief.</p><hr><p>\u201CHehe. I see, I shall use those two to tease you just for fun, Shirou.</p><p>Yep, I guess I should bring them with me sometime again\uFF5E\u266A\u201D</p><p>\u201CGive me a break... Even the evening meal will taste bland if they force it to be a formal dinner.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201COh...? Well, it&#39;s going to be tough from now on.</p><p>You won&#39;t be able to escort your significant other like that, Shirou.\u201D</p><p>\u201CE-Escort...!? That much I can do...</p><p>I mean, look, what I&#39;m trying to say is that out-of-place luxuries like maids just don&#39;t belong here, and if I need to escort, on a small scale, like a trip to the shopping district...\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CI wonder?</p><p>This is only a prediction, but I assure you, Shirou, that you&#39;ll have an extraordinarily splendid, elegant date sometime in the future.</p><p>No matter how opposed you may be, think of it as an absolutely unavoidable event.\u201D</p><p>\u201CEvent... you mean... a luxurious date with a significant other...?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CThat&#39;s right. Do you find it hard to believe?\u201D</p><p>Ah... well, believing isn&#39;t the problem to begin with...</p><p>\u201C...But even before that, what if I won&#39;t have a date to go out with...?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CThat&#39;s no problem.</p><p>Even if you won&#39;t get one, I&#39;ll always be there.</p><p>Waaait\u2015\u2015\u2015Your very first date just has to be with me. I&#39;ll absolutely make sure you get a royal treatment, you just wait.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><p>...Crap. My brain just experienced a sudden meltdown.</p><p>A first-rate smile so sweet, it overwhelms the berry pie in my mouth.</p><hr><p>\u201CAh\u2015\u2015\u2015Uh, Illya.\u201D</p><p>\u201CCome on, how come your fork is sitting still, Onii-chan? And you got jam all over your mouth, just like a young brother with no manners.</p><p>...Hehe. Keep being sloppy, and I&#39;ll just eat it all myself.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><p>Mimicking an older sibling&#39;s voice, she keeps making fun of me.</p><p>I slowly chew on the pie, no longer noticing the taste.</p><hr><p>It&#39;s just as she says, even her thoughts are innocent...</p><p>Tension, confusion, and a host of other unknown emotions mixed inside my head make me dizzy.</p><p>Sella and Liz are just the beginning... Even Illya by herself, no, especially all by herself, this sugar-candy lady is sweeter than any cake out there.</p><hr><h3 id="emiya-residence\u30FBstart-of-night-things-to-do-1" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#emiya-residence\u30FBstart-of-night-things-to-do-1" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Emiya Residence\u30FBStart of Night Things to do</h3><h3 id="night\u30FBstreets-at-night-battle" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#night\u30FBstreets-at-night-battle" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Night\u30FBStreets at night (battle)</h3><h3 id="night\u30FBpeaceful-shinto" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#night\u30FBpeaceful-shinto" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Night\u30FBPeaceful Shinto</h3><hr><p>There aren&#39;t that many people in front of the station.</p><p>Evening rush hour is long since over.</p><p>From what I&#39;ve seen, no more than one person exits the station every half hour.</p><p>But even though there aren&#39;t many of them, pedestrians do pass by.

They have pretty much said they don&#39;t want to fight, so I think I should be safe.</p><p>The only exception was Archer, but it seemed like he was hostile to me alone.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C...I see. So Archer viewed only you as an enemy.\u201D</p><p>Saber is briefly lost in thought.</p><hr><p>\u201CShirou, we must proceed with our investigation. We found no anomaly in Miyama, but there must be somewhere in Shinto where the seams have frayed.\u201D</p><hr><p>And with that said, Saber marches off toward the plaza, her steps suddenly a lot more determined.</p><p>An assertive Saber is a scary sight, but having her walk around looking like that is just as frightening.</p><p>To stop her when she&#39;s in that state would take a Herculean effort.</p><p>Oh well. I might as well get down to business myself, I think as we head off towards the office district.</p><hr><h3 id="night\u30FBreturn-of-the-wise-man" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#night\u30FBreturn-of-the-wise-man" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Night\u30FBReturn of the wise man</h3><h2 id="day-3" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#day-3" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Day 3</h2><h3 id="streets\u30FBday-3-two-detectives" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#streets\u30FBday-3-two-detectives" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Streets\u30FBDay 3 Two detectives</h3><hr><p>I finally arrive at the outskirts of Shinto, where a secluded Western-style mansion has been built on top of a prominent hill.</p><p>I know there&#39;s nothing here, yet I have a feeling I should try looking around one more time.</p><hr><p>\u201C...I left right away last time. Today, there is no rush.\u201D</p><p>I&#39;m well aware that this is trespassing, but I really want to have a look inside.</p><hr><p>Tohsaka and Matou mansions are both fine examples of Western-style architecture, but I don&#39;t feel particularly fascinated by the buildings themselves.</p><p>This house, however, I find strangely attractive.</p><p>Modest in its splendor, the structure just feels aesthetically pleasing. I wouldn&#39;t mind even a maintenance job in this building.</p><hr><p>The mansion is full of sunlight inside.</p><p>After all, there are quite a lot of windows.</p><p>There&#39;s even a hill-top neighborhood. On a fair day like this, my vision grows hazy with the blinding white light.</p><p>And so, immersed in this heaven-like world, I do notice something that wasn&#39;t here last time.</p><hr><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015Someone&#39;s there\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><p>I feel signs of human presence on the second floor.</p><p>But what&#39;s coming from there isn&#39;t just signs of a living being.</p><p>There is a clear sense of hostility, aimed at the intruder\u2015\u2015\u2015no, aimed directly at me.</p><hr><p>I come up to the second floor.</p><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><p>...The footsteps are coming closer.</p><p>A figure slowly appears out of the white haze\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>\u201C...Well, if it isn&#39;t that stupid face again.</p><p>Good grief, you sure like pointless adventures, Emiya Shirou.\u201D</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015Hold on, that&#39;s my line.</p><hr><p>\u201CI&#39;m somewhat relieved. Why the heck are you here, Archer? Tohsaka&#39;s grace ran out and you got kicked out of the house?\u201D</p><p>\u201CImpressive. Your perception isn&#39;t bad, and not entirely wrong.</p><p>I need to finish up a job I&#39;ve been entrusted with. And so I will not be coming back until my Master is satisfied...\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CBut I bet your guess actually had a basis in reality.</p><p>I see. Torn apart by an internal conflict, unable to find your place and running away... that&#39;s not just somebody else&#39;s problem, you know.</p><p>Anxiety over your future causes you to unconsciously bring it up. Man up and focus on your goals, while you still can.\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015Ugh, that&#39;s none of your business. Keep your nose out of our private matters.\u201D</p><hr><p>Well, sometimes even I think it is uncertain.</p><p>...But enough of that. Archer is, indeed, left in charge of the Tohsaka residence in her absence.</p><p>What he was probably entrusted with, as an overseer of Fuyuki\u2015\u2015\u2015is &quot;maintaining public order.&quot;</p><hr><p>\u201C...Hm? So were you hoping to find something here? Otherwise, I doubt you&#39;d come near a place like this.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201COh no. I have no interest in this mansion, in fact, I did not even know it existed. I am just about done, and I saw nothing particularly unusual. I do not intend to waste any more time here.\u201D</p><p>\u201C??? So why did you come, then? You must have thought it looked suspicious, at least?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CYou, yourself, are the reason. You came in here a while back. That, by itself, is plenty of cause for investigation.\u201D</p><p>\u201CWhat&#39;s with that? You mean, just because I came to have a look, with no ill intentions?\u201D</p><p>&quot;What kind of a reason is that?&quot; I glare at him.</p><p>Archer looks down upon me with a doubtful gaze.</p><hr><p>\u201CAnd you, what brought YOU here?</p><p>I know nothing about this mansion, didn&#39;t I tell you?\u201D</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015So Archer did not know about this mansion.</p><p>I suddenly get a feeling that this fact carries a significant meaning to it.</p><p>\u201Ckh\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><p>I am blinded by the strong sunlight.</p><hr><p>\u201CFine, there is no need to answer. You came expecting to find some clues. However, by the looks of it, you were not successful.</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015Not all of the evidence must have been lining up.\u201D</p><p>He&#39;s heading for the hallway.</p><hr><p>\u201COh, right. The owner of this mansion passed away 60 years ago.</p><p>The name&#39;s Edelfelt. Coming from a distant land, seems they had a well-known magus lineage.\u201D</p><p>\u201CEdelfelt...?\u201D</p><p>...That name, I&#39;m sure I&#39;ve heard it somewhere\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>\u201CI do not care what you are looking for, but if you find something new, do tell.</p><p>Come to think of it, if you come across a corpse or two, you might even get a detective mystery going.\u201D</p><p>He disappears, leaving nothing but bad taste behind.</p><hr><p>\u201CWhat&#39;s up with that guy? Like hell am I going to tell him, even if I do find something.\u201D</p><p>Thus making sure to have the last word, I resume the search.</p><p>...Well.</p><p>If Archer couldn&#39;t find anything, the chances of discovering new clues by myself are pretty slim.</p><hr><h3 id="emiya-s\u30FBday-3-mitsuzuri-visits" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#emiya-s\u30FBday-3-mitsuzuri-visits" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Emiya&#39;s\u30FBDay 3 Mitsuzuri visits</h3><hr><p>\u201CHm?\u201D</p><p>Huh? The doorbell? We aren&#39;t expecting any guests... could it be mail delivery or perhaps the newspaper solicitor?</p><hr><p>I get up and head toward the door.</p><p>\u201C............\u201D</p><p>...I can hear a conversation.</p><p>I guess someone was nearby and went to greet the visitor before me.</p><hr><p>\u201CWelcome. Have you come to see Sakura or Shirou?\u201D</p><p>I can hear Rider&#39;s voice from around the corner.</p><p>Her polite greeting puts me at ease.</p><p>But the visitor&#39;s voice seems somehow unsettled.</p><hr><p>\u201CUh... R-Rider-san?\u201D</p><p>\u201CYes. Have you been well? It&#39;s been a while since we have met outside the archery club, <em>Ayako</em>.\u201D</p><p>So the visitor is Mitsuzuri.</p><p>Sakura is here. She probably has some archery club business to take care of, so I suppose it&#39;s not unusual for her to come here.</p><hr><p>\u201COh no, Rider-san, you&#39;re, um... as beautiful as always.</p><p>Aha. Hahaha, ha...\u201D</p><p>\u201CThank you. But you are beautiful yourself, too. Awe-inspiring, I ought to say.</p><p>Not just your lovely features, but your figure, and even your androgynous looks. I can&#39;t help but watch in fascination.\u201D</p><p>\u201CEh? Ah, h-how embarrassing...\u201D</p><hr><p>...Something is definitely off here.</p><p>No, the only one off is Rider. Her usual stern look has been replaced with a smile so sickeningly sweet it sends shivers down my spine.</p><hr><p>\u201C...She&#39;s like a snake looking at a mouse.\u201D</p><p>Being a skilled martial artist, Mitsuzuri probably feels the danger in the air by sheer instinct.</p><p>I&#39;ve been told she doesn&#39;t like Rider very much, so this must be a pretty desperate situation for her...</p><hr><p>\u201CSo, what brings you here today?\u201D</p><p>\u201CAh... Um, I have some business with Sakura, so...\u201D</p><p>\u201CAh, about the archery club?</p><p>...You really care a lot for your juniors. I must express my thanks in Sakura&#39;s stead, or my conscience would not forgive me.\u201D</p><p>&quot;Hehehe,&quot; she laughs weirdly as she forces Mitsuzuri against the wall.</p><hr><p>\u201C..................\u201D</p><p>She just enjoys teasing Mitsuzuri... is what I want to think, but Rider&#39;s real motive is still lost on me.</p><p>Being an advocate of the Sakura Supremacy doctrine, Rider may indeed be simply thanking her.</p><hr><p>\u201CN-No, you needn&#39;t... I mean, I&#39;m doing it because I like it, so you don&#39;t need to concern yourself...\u201D</p><p>\u201CThat is magnificent. I am also doing it because I like it, so please don&#39;t hesitate to accept.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CIncidentally, <em>Ayako</em>, do you have a balanced diet nowadays?</p><p>It seems you aren&#39;t having much meat, but you still need to get some fat into your blood. Taste aside, it won&#39;t do if your food doesn&#39;t have much substance.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><p>...Wait a moment.</p><p>Rider has just blurted out something very wrong.</p><hr><p>\u201CB-B-B-Blood!? What are you talking about, Rider-san! W-Why do you bring that up all of a sudden...!?\u201D</p><p>\u201CIt was just an example.</p><p>It shouldn&#39;t matter much which example\u2015\u2015\u2015right, I shall explain this in greater detail in my room.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CAh... No, that&#39;s...</p><p>No, Emiya, Matou, I know you guys are watching! HELP!\u201D</p><hr><p><em>flinch</em></p><p>N-No, she must be just guessing.</p><p>Because I know Sakura is definitely not here.</p><hr><p>\u201CReally, as expected of you, Senpai. I&#39;ve been discovered.\u201D</p><p>\u201CWaaah!?\u201D</p><p>W-When did Sakura get here!?</p><p>I was so focused on Mitsuzuri&#39;s misfortune, I hadn&#39;t realized it myself.</p><hr><p>\u201CYou guys led on Rider-san and watched on! What nerve! And you aren&#39;t even Tohsaka, either!\u201D</p><p>\u201CEh, it wasn&#39;t planned.\u201D</p><p>\u201CIt was a coincidence, Mitsuzuri-senpai.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CAh. Time&#39;s already up.\u201D</p><p>And with a swish, Rider takes the back seat, just as Sakura arrives on the scene.</p><p>What brilliant skill.</p><hr><p>\u201CDon&#39;t feel down, Rider. You can always meet Mitsuzuri at the archery club.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CRight, you can be good friends with Mitsuzuri-senpai in no time, so do your best, Rider.\u201D</p><p>\u201CIndeed... unfortunately, it seems I am still unable to let go of my bitter memories. It&#39;s best not to rush things, however, so I shall bid farewell.</p><p>Please take care of Sakura, Ayako.\u201D</p><p>And so Rider steps out of the entranceway.</p><hr><p>\u201C...Phew, to think that Rider-san would be here... that was close.\u201D</p><p>\u201COh, a little late, but welcome, Senpai.\u201D</p><p>\u201CHey, Mitsuzuri. Come on in. We should go sit down, at least.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CAll right, then.\u201D</p><p>\u201CAh, I&#39;ll go make some tea.\u201D</p><p>\u201CEh...? Alright, please do, Sakura.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C......Oh?\u201D</p><p>\u201CWhat?\u201D</p><p>\u201CMatou... she&#39;s like your dear wife, living elsewhere but visiting often.\u201D</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015I&#39;m having trouble coming up with a reply to that comment.</p><p>Ugh... is this revenge for Rider?</p><hr><p>\u201CStop it. Sakura isn&#39;t the only one staying here. There&#39;s Rider and Saber too...\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CAnd also Tohsaka and Fujimura-sensei, right? What a ruckus. But Matou seems happy, so it&#39;s alright, being your wife or whatever.\u201D</p><p>\u201CUgh...\u201D</p><p>There&#39;s logic... yet there isn&#39;t.</p><hr><p>\u201CLove strengthens one... Oh well... I guess I should find a significant other, too.\u201D</p><p>\u201CYeah... you still don&#39;t have one, do you... after that incident.\u201D</p><p>\u201CThat&#39;s not it, of course. It&#39;s going to be that time of the year, and I can&#39;t distance myself from guys because of it. Everyone will soon be busy thinking about their future, you know.\u201D</p><hr><p>That incident... must be the one around April.</p><p>...Perhaps I miss those days, or maybe they&#39;re just hard to forget... like a nightmare. Who could have thought they were doing it all behind my back\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>\u201CI&#39;m telling you over and over, that was a no-game. And most importantly, how can you just accept Tohsaka&#39;s claim in a situation like that?\u201D</p><p>\u201CThat said, I think your methods were quite harsh, too.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CEven you did it without realizing Tohsaka&#39;s plan.</p><p>Really... I can&#39;t tell whether you&#39;re cold as a robot or just stiff as a tree stump. I never thought the idea of true friendship was lost so completely on you.\u201D</p><p>\u201CAh, what could you be talking about, Senpai?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CAhaha, oh no... it&#39;s a story about a past defeat. Sorry, Matou, but just look the other way on this one, please.\u201D</p><p>\u201CYeah, a game where Tohsaka took all the winnings.\u201D</p><p>\u201COh...? Was it Mahjong or something like that?\u201D</p><p>I&#39;ll be thankful if she thinks it was only that.</p><p>It was pathetic and embarrassing in so many ways that it&#39;s not an easy story to tell others.</p><hr><p>\u201CAnyways! Thank you for the tea, Matou!\u201D</p><p>\u201CHere, please take you time.\u201D</p><p>\u201CUmm, at times like these... Would you like some bubuzuke...?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CYou are totally out of it, Emiya. That&#39;s not a phrase of welcome, but a complaint to get one kicked out, geez.\u201D</p><p>\u201CBut salmon soaked in apricot tea is just right for the atmosphere.\u201D</p><p>\u201CMmm... maybe not in tea, but tuna broth, like so.\u201D</p><hr><p>Sakura unintentionally sidetracks into the topic of cooking, so I take advantage of it.</p><p>And all Mitsuzuri has to say, looking at us with a sigh,</p><hr><p>\u201COh my. You really are such a charming sweetheart couple. Well done, guys.\u201D</p><p>\u201CW-What are you saying, Senpai!? Who, who a-am I a couple with!?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CDon&#39;t be shy, don&#39;t be shy. You&#39;re so cute, Matou.\u201D</p><p>\u201CAnd Emiya-senpai, stop laughing!\u201D</p><p>\u201CWhat do you mean? I&#39;m not laughing, see? I&#39;m just as flustered here!\u201D</p><p>It&#39;s nothing to brag about, but my hand holding the teacup is shaking.</p><hr><p>\u201CSee? This is why it&#39;s a no-game. Really... if it&#39;s Matou that Emiya is destined to have a happy-ever-after with, then it must be a golden yaksha for Tohsaka.\u201D</p><p>\u201CDirect your whining toward Tohsaka herself... and didn&#39;t you have something to talk about with Sakura, Mitsuzuri?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CRight, right. I got so caught up teasing you, I almost forgot. Matou, about this upcoming tournament...\u201D</p><p>\u201CYes, Mitsuzuri-senpai.\u201D</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015The nonchalant atmosphere disappears, and a serious conversation ensues.</p><p>Alright then, I&#39;ll try to listen without being a bother.</p><hr><h3 id="emiya-residence\u30FBstart-of-night-things-to-do-2" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#emiya-residence\u30FBstart-of-night-things-to-do-2" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Emiya Residence\u30FBStart of Night Things to do</h3><h2 id="day-4" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#day-4" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Day 4</h2><h3 id="demonic-nest-ranraiken" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#demonic-nest-ranraiken" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Demonic Nest Ranraiken</h3><hr><p>\u201CHello!

But will Berserker be able to fit in the dining room?\u201D</p><p>\u201CAh... You&#39;re right, that might be kind of hard. Maybe I should have him stand outside the window?\u201D</p><p>\u201CUm.\u201D</p><hr><p>That&#39;s scary in its own way.</p><p>Imagining Berserker sitting outside the window, sadly holding his knees, makes me think of Saber waiting for me.</p><hr><p>\u201CIn that case, let&#39;s eat outside. It&#39;s a bit cold out, but if we build a fire it&#39;ll be warm enough. If everyone&#39;s outside having fun together, it could make for a pretty fun barbecue.\u201D</p><p>\u201CYeah, I want to do that, too! And I&#39;m sure Berserker will love it!\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201COkay, good. A barbecue is something I can help out with, so I&#39;ll be able to repay you for letting me stay here.</p><p>Um, Liz is preparing the meat, so I&#39;ll be in charge of vegetables. Illya, can I use the kitchen...? I&#39;ll be borrowing the vegetables in there\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><p>Uh, wait a second...!?</p><p>W-Why are you clinging to me...!?</p><hr><p>\u201CWait, Illya...!? Hold on, at least tell me why you&#39;re doing that!\u201D</p><p>I keep struggling, but she refuses to release my arm from her grasp.</p><p>\u201CThis is so great! I&#39;m so happy...!</p><p>Thank you, Onii-chan!\u201D</p><hr><p>Her strength increases as she squeezes me, so finally I just resign myself to it.</p><p>Illya looks so happy she could cry.</p><p>I don&#39;t know what&#39;s gotten into her, but she&#39;s happily holding on as hard as she can.</p><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Well, it&#39;s okay.\u201D</p><p>When I see her face like that, the embarrassment I feel becomes trivial.</p><hr><p>An unexpected decision to have dinner in the castle.</p><p>If such a small thing can bring Illya this much joy, I&#39;d make the same choice every time.</p><hr><p>\u201CThis is your room, Emiya-sama. Please proceed.\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015Seriously?\u201D</p><p>So...</p><p>After the heart-warming uproar of the barbecue, the reception I&#39;m getting now is colder than ice.</p><hr><p>\u201CThen I shall excuse myself.</p><p>If you require anything, please call me.\u201D</p><p>\u201CWait a minute!!!\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CWhat is it?\u201D</p><p>\u201CYou... how can you say that!? How am I supposed to sleep in here!? Even at the best of times, this castle is middle-of-winter cold! No sane human would possibly sleep here!\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CAh, that. In that case, do not worry. In the corner of the room is a sleeping bag. It is an inferior quality article Leysritt purchased at Mount Miyama, but it shouldn&#39;t be too much for you to handle, Emiya-sama.\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><p>Just as she said, I can see a sleeping bag and a mattress laid out in the corner of the room.</p><p>But that&#39;s not the problem here.</p><hr><p>\u201CSella. Even with a sleeping bag, it&#39;s impossible to spend the whole night in here. To ask bluntly, I&#39;d like you to show me to another room.</p><p>In spite of what you may have heard, I&#39;m just a regular guy. It&#39;s not every day that I spend the night in a castle, so I&#39;d like to try sleeping in a luxurious bedroom.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C...I acknowledge your request, but this is the only guest room available at the moment. My apologies, Emiya-sama, but you have no choice but to agree to stay in this storeroom...\u201D</p><p>\u201CYou said it. You definitely just said this is a storeroom.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201COh my. Forgive me, I spoke in error.</p><p>More properly, this guest room was a storeroom an hour ago. It seems the wine from dinner is affecting me.\u201D</p><p>&quot;Hehe,&quot; Sella giggles, a gentle smile on her face.</p><p>I wonder if I&#39;ve ever seen such an unhappy smile before.</p><hr><p>\u201CAh, my head is swimming. Please excuse me, Emiya-sama, but I shall now retire for the night.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CFor your own protection, I should tell you that all of the other rooms will be locked, so please do not go walking around the halls unnecessarily.</p><p>We have just implemented a special burglar extermination spell tonight. To carelessly open the wrong door while looking for the bathroom... would be inviting your own death.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015This is revenge.
