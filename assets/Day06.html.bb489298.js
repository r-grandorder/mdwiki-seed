Yeah, it had to be.&quot;</p><p>...I didn&#39;t go to school in my sleep, nor would Tohsaka ever want to... um... do it with me.</p><p>So it had to be a dream.</p><p>I have my pajamas on, and Saber was sleeping in the room next to mine!</p><hr><p>&quot;...Yeah. There&#39;s no way Saber would miss me leaving the house.&quot;</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015I sigh with relief.</p><p>The strength floods out of me, and I fall back to the futon.</p><hr><p>&quot;Shirou...?

It&#39;s soooooo a dream. I&#39;ll never be able to look Tohsaka in the eye again if it&#39;s not.</p><hr><p>&quot;Shirou?&quot;</p><p>Saber comes in.</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015Y-Yo. Good morning, Saber.&quot;</p><p>I try to act calm.</p><hr><p>&quot;What is wrong, Shirou? It is not like you to greet me lying down.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Well, something unexpected happened.&quot;</p><hr><p>Saber tilts her head in wonder.</p><p>Well.</p><p>It&#39;s great that the whole event was just a dream, but the troubles keep coming.</p><p>My body feels heavy, and I can&#39;t stand up. How will I make breakfast\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015?</p><hr><p>&quot;37.6 degrees. Wow, it&#39;s rare for you to catch a cold.&quot;</p><p>She gives me her diagnosis after looking at the medical thermometer.</p><p>...Well, that&#39;s about what I expected, but I didn&#39;t know a cold could make your body feel so heavy.</p><hr><p>&quot;So, does it hurt anywhere else? Does your throat or head hurt?&quot;</p><p>&quot;...? No, nothing like that. It&#39;s just that my body feels heavy and hot. Is that weird?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Hmm... I guess we should just be glad that nothing&#39;s hurting.</p><p>Then again, you might not have noticed the pain because you&#39;re the type who just deals with it. ...I&#39;ll have some other medicines ready, just in case.&quot;</p><hr><p>Fuji-Nee takes out some cold medicine and cough drops from the first-aid kit.</p><p>She&#39;s good at treating wounds, but I guess she&#39;s not used to treating sick people.</p><hr><p>&quot;Thanks, Fuji-Nee. And I&#39;m sorry. I don&#39;t think I can cook breakfast.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Don&#39;t say such a stupid thing. Which do you think is more important, food or Shirou? It&#39;s good Saber-chan came and got me. I would&#39;ve been really mad if you tried to make breakfast like that.&quot;</p><hr><p>She really is mad.</p><p>...And she&#39;s right. That should have been obvious.</p><hr><p>&quot;And you don&#39;t have to worry about food. Sakura-chan made some rice porridge for you, so you can eat that when you get hungry.&quot;</p><p>&quot;What...? Sakura made some rice porridge...?&quot;</p><p>...That must mean she&#39;s feeling better.</p><hr><p>&quot;Are you all right, Sakura? You seemed to be doing worse than me.&quot;</p><p>&quot;You don&#39;t need to worry since I&#39;ve recovered.</p><p>I wasn&#39;t scared at all at night, and I got a good night&#39;s sleep. It&#39;s all thanks to your treatment.&quot;</p><hr><p>...That&#39;s good to know.</p><p>I thought she would take longer to get over the cold, but I&#39;m glad she recovered in one night.</p><hr><p>&quot;Ohhh, I forgot about that. Sakura-chan was the one with the cold yesterday, wasn&#39;t she?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Huh...? That&#39;s true... but what about it? Stop making that face.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Ohhhh. So you did something that made you catch her cold?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Huh? What do you mean by that?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh, you don&#39;t get it? Sakura-chan&#39;s recovered, right? Then you must&#39;ve done something. I hear that you recover from a cold if you give it to someone else.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...?&quot;</p><p>I look at Sakura in confusion.</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Oh.&quot;</p><p>And I finally understand what Fuji-Nee is talking about.</p><hr><p>&quot;A-A-A-A-A-A-Are you stupid!? I just gave her some medicine yesterday...! Don&#39;t even joke about it, Fuji-Nee! That&#39;s rude to Sakura...!&quot;</p><p>I can tell that my face is getting red.</p><p>My temperature shoots up another degree.</p><hr><p>&quot;I&#39;m kidding. I know you&#39;re not man enough for that.&quot;</p><p>&quot;...That&#39;s offending as well, but I&#39;m glad the misunderstanding has been cleared up.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Good, good. Then I&#39;ll report to the school about your absence, so you&#39;re to rest today. Please take care of Shirou, Saber-chan.</p><p>He&#39;ll keep trying to do something if you let him be, so you&#39;d better just tie him to the futon.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;That is my intention. I am to look over him so that he does not escape, and feed him appropriately?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Wow, that&#39;s a scary way to put it, but you have the right idea. Please do.&quot;</p><hr><p>Saber nods silently.</p><p>...Is it just me, or did I feel a chill run up my spine?</p><hr><p>&quot;Well, just listen to what Saber-chan tells you until we get home. I&#39;ll buy you something nutritious for dinner, so you&#39;re going to rest today and cure that cold of yours.&quot;</p><hr><p>Fuji-Nee smiles at me while making unreasonable demands.</p><p>&quot;...?&quot;</p><p>I notice Sakura behind her, looking like she wants to say something.</p><hr><p>&quot;We&#39;re leaving. Look forward to my souvenir!&quot;</p><p>Fuji-Nee waves goodbye and leaves.</p><hr><p>&quot;......Phew.&quot;</p><p>Once I&#39;ve seen her off, I return to my futon.</p><p>I only walked out to the porch, but by the time I get back, I&#39;m so tired that I practically collapse into bed.</p><p>...I don&#39;t have a bad cold, but my body is dead tired.</p><p>I should sleep and get my energy back, or else I won&#39;t be able to do anything.</p><hr><p>Then.</p><p>Even though it&#39;s past 7:30, Sakura comes to my room.</p><hr><p>&quot;Sakura? It&#39;s 7:30 already. You won&#39;t make it unless you leave soon.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;......&quot;</p><p>Sakura looks down awkwardly.</p><p>When I realize she has the same expression as before...</p><hr><p>&quot;Um, Senpai. Can I stay here?&quot;</p><p>...She raises her head and asks me a question.</p><hr><p>&quot;...?&quot;</p><p>Staying here means she&#39;s not going to school, right?</p><hr><p>&quot;...Oh. Are you still a bit sick?&quot;</p><p>&quot;......No, the fever&#39;s gone. But, um...&quot;</p><p>Sakura&#39;s words trail off.</p><p>...Hm.</p><p>She does look a bit pale, and it seems impossible that she could recover in only one night.</p><hr><p>&quot;I see, so you were sick after all. But is it all right?</p><p>Don&#39;t you have to call the school and let them know?&quot;</p><p>&quot;...No. Um, I&#39;m thinking of skipping.&quot;</p><p>&quot;...?&quot;</p><p>She&#39;s going to be skipping... school?</p><hr><p>&quot;Why? You&#39;re sick, so you&#39;re not skipping school. You have to stay home if you&#39;re not feeling well.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...Uh. Um, I feel fine.&quot;</p><p>Sakura hangs her head even more.</p><p>&quot;...???&quot;</p><p>I don&#39;t get it.</p><p>What does Sakura want to tell me?</p><hr><p>&quot;U-Um. I think you caught the cold because of me.&quot;</p><p>&quot;What? You actually believe Fuji-Nee&#39;s ridiculous story? Don&#39;t worry, it&#39;s not true. I take walks during the night, so that must&#39;ve been it.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;I-I still don&#39;t care. ...I&#39;m feeling well, so I want to skip school and take care of you to show my appreciation for what you did for me yesterday...!&quot;</p><p>She&#39;s so tense that she might shatter if I poke her.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Hmm.&quot;</p><p>I guess Sakura feels responsible for my cold.</p><hr><p>To be honest, it&#39;s relieving to have Sakura here.</p><p>Saber has to sleep, so it&#39;ll be a big help if she can prepare my medicine and stuff.</p><hr><p>&quot;Um, Senpai...?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Okay, please do, Sakura.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Y-You&#39;re right. Saber-san is here, so there&#39;s nothing I can do here\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><p>Huh, Senpai?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yeah. Please take care of me, Sakura.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Um\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015You&#39;re talking about me, right?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yeah. Saber has jetlag, so she sleeps during the day. It&#39;ll be a huge help if you can cook lunch.&quot;</p><p>&quot;O-Okay!</p><p>I-I&#39;ll do my best, Senpai!&quot;</p><hr><p>Her tension gone, Sakura replies with a smile.</p><p>...Yeah.</p><p>A smile like this suits Sakura.</p><hr><h2 id="scene-01-a-simple-question" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#scene-01-a-simple-question" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Scene 01 A simple question</h2><p>It&#39;s 11AM now.</p><p>After eating the rice porridge Sakura made, I feel much better.</p><p>My body doesn&#39;t feel heavy anymore.</p><p>I have no trouble moving, so I should be able to go to school if I feel like it.</p><hr><p>But.</p><p>As soon as I try to get up, suspecting that my illness was simply caused by malnutrition...</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh, no, Senpai! You have to rest until your fever goes away.&quot;</p><p>...Sakura comes to check up on me.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Phew.&quot;</p><p>So...</p><p>I&#39;m still resting because Sakura is dead set on looking after me, and to be honest, I&#39;m still feeling a bit sluggish.</p><hr><p>After bringing me the rice porridge, Sakura left the room, saying that she had something to do.</p><p>Saber is resting in the living room right now.</p><p>She was keeping watch in this room, but I had her move to the living room so that I could have a little peace of mind.</p><p>She objected, but then relented when I told her it&#39;d only be for today.</p><hr><p>&quot;Excuse me, Senpai. How do you feel?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I&#39;m getting better thanks to you. My body still feels heavy, but my fever&#39;s gone.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;That&#39;s good. Then you won&#39;t need to take any medicine. All you have to do now is to eat good food and rest.&quot;</p><p>Sakura goes into the next room and brings in a new futon.</p><hr><p>&quot;...? What are you doing, Sakura?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I&#39;m getting a new futon. You&#39;ve been sweating all day, so I thought you might want a clean one.&quot;</p><hr><p>She lays the futon next to me in a skillful manner.</p><p>It doesn&#39;t stir up any dust, to my surprise.</p><hr><p>&quot;It&#39;s ready, Senpai. Please move over here. ...Oh, you need to change before that. I&#39;ll go dry this futon, so please get changed while I&#39;m gone.&quot;</p><p>Sakura prepares new pajamas for me in a flash.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>S-She&#39;s perfect!</p><p>It&#39;s not just that she&#39;s good at this or that she&#39;s attentive.</p><hr><p>&quot;I bet this skill is in her genes. It has to be.&quot;</p><p>&quot;...? Did you say something, Senpai?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I did. I know I shouldn&#39;t be saying this, but I&#39;m glad you skipped school today.</p><p>I really do have a better opinion of you now.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;That&#39;s natural. It&#39;s been almost a year and a half since I started coming here, so I know all about your house.&quot;</p><p>Sakura puffs with pride.</p><p>Her confident expression makes me smile.</p><hr><p>&quot;I see. Then I&#39;ll leave the futon to you. I&#39;ll act as a sick person and do as you say.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Please do. I&#39;m going to go cut some apples for you after I dry the futon, so look forward to it.&quot;</p><p>Carrying the futon I&#39;ve been laying on, Sakura goes out into the hallway.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Wow, she took all of it in one load.&quot;</p><p>Her enthusiasm surprises me, and I pick up the new pajamas.</p><hr><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015Well.</p><p>I should towel myself off, change, and wait in the futon until Sakura comes back.</p><hr><p>How much time passed?</p><p>Sakura brought me some apples as promised, I gladly ate them, and...</p><p>&quot;Geez. You can&#39;t push yourself, Senpai.&quot;</p><p>...Sakura scolded me, and I have to keep lying here even though I&#39;m recovered.</p><hr><p>&quot;So, did Saber help?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes. She said she was tired of doing nothing, so she helped me clean the guest rooms.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I see. I kind of wanted to see Saber wring a floor cloth.</p><p>Did you two clean the hallway?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Yes. We both worked hard. Saber-san was saying something about how it was useful, though.&quot;</p><p>Sakura laughs, as if she&#39;s a bit troubled.</p><p>Even though she&#39;s used to Saber now, it seems she&#39;s still not entirely comfortable around her.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Well, thanks for your hard work. But don&#39;t push yourself too hard, okay? You just got over a cold. It&#39;s hard enough just to treat me, so you don&#39;t have to go around cleaning my house.&quot;</p><p>&quot;That&#39;s not true. I spend my mornings here, and you always treat me to dinner.

Fuji-Nee, Sakura, and I are like a family.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Eh... Senpai?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;I&#39;m sorry I was so reserved. There&#39;s nothing wrong with a family member nursing me back to health.</p><p>I&#39;d do the same for you if you got sick, no matter how much you complained.</p><p>So it was stupid of me to be reserved.&quot;</p><p>Reflecting on my actions, I can only apologize.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>The conversation stops.</p><p>After gasping for a brief second...</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Yes.

I&#39;m going to take your temperature, so please open your mouth!&quot;</p><p>She must be in a panic, as she tries to pin me with one hand while holding the thermometer in the other.</p><hr><p>&quot;Huh\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015?&quot;</p><p>I feel something soft.</p><p>...Um, I think it&#39;s Sakura&#39;s breasts rubbing against me.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>My brain boils up.</p><p>The sensation of a woman almost blows away my sanity.</p><hr><p>&quot;Whoa\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015!</p><p>H-Hold on, Sakura!!!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Kya\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015!?&quot;</p><p>I roll out of the futon using all my might.</p><p>I have to get away from Sakura&#39;s brea\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015no, from Sakura!</p><hr><p>&quot;S-Senpai...? Um, I want to take your temperature.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I-It&#39;s fine! I can do that myself, so you stop right there!&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...? If you say so.</p><p>Here&#39;s the thermometer, Senpai.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;No!!!</p><p>Don&#39;t give it to me now! Please let me calm down! I&#39;ll recall last night&#39;s dream and die if you come near me right now!&quot;</p><p>I can feel my face burning as I protest.</p><hr><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Then.</p><p>&quot;Yesterday&#39;s dream?&quot;</p><p>I must have acted really strange, as Sakura looks at me dubiously.</p><hr><p>&quot;Uhh... um. I had a bad dream.</p><p>I don&#39;t want to recall it right now, so please leave me alone. It&#39;s not your fault, okay? It&#39;s just that I need more training.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015You need... more training...?&quot;</p><p>Sakura gapes at me.</p><p>...It&#39;s only natural.

What kind of a dream was it?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Ugh\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>I-I can&#39;t tell her about such a dream...!</p><hr><p>&quot;I-It wasn&#39;t a big deal.

It was only Tohsaka.&quot;</p><p>I confess.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015I see. Tohsaka-Senpai came here the other day too, right?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh... yeah. She treated my wound, but went home right away.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...Okay. Then I&#39;ll be leaving the thermometer here.&quot;</p><p>Sakura sets the thermometer down and walks to the door with heavy steps.</p><hr><p>&quot;Excuse me, but I need to go cook lunch.

I&#39;m feeling better, so please, at least let me do this.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Really? Then please do, as a test to see if you&#39;ve recovered.

I heard that your fever has broken, but you still look pale.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Huh? Do I look that bad?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...Hm. No, your face just looks pale.</p><p>You have a shortage of magical energy, the lifeline for a magus. I noticed no problems during the battle last night, but that temple might have been set up to drain magical energy.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Hmm.&quot;</p><p>...Now that she mentions it, something was indeed strange at the Ryuudou Temple.</p><p>Everyone in there was weakened.

My magical energy should return if I get some nourishment. My capacity isn&#39;t that large, so it should be back to normal once I eat dinner.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Geez. I will not inquire any further if you say so. ...Sakura is right. It seems you tend to make light of yourself.&quot;</p><p>Saber starts stacking the bowls.</p><hr><p>&quot;I should hand these to Sakura, correct? I will take the pot as well, so please wipe the table, Shirou.&quot;</p><p>Saber goes to the kitchen without waiting for my reply.</p><hr><p>&quot;Should I put the bowls here, Sakura?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Saber-san? Oh, yes. Please put the dirty dishes there.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I see. By the way, Sakura, lunch was very delicious. Please accept my thanks.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Ahaha, I have a lot to learn. Senpai&#39;s still the best when it comes to rice porridge and udon.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;......&quot;</p><p>I can hear friendly conversation from the kitchen.</p><p>&quot;Oh.

What are you doing, opening the refrigerator?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Well, I&#39;m thinking of repaying you just a bit.&quot;</p><hr><p>I look in the very back, behind all the vegetables.</p><p>Thanks to years of practice in hiding things from Fuji-Nee, I hide snacks where I can find them before they pass the expiration date.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Huh? Why is there an Edomaeya bag in the vegetable compartment?&quot;</p><p>Sakura stares at the bag with surprise and expectation.</p><hr><p>By the way, Edomaeya is a stand that sells dorayaki, taiyaki, and takoyaki.</p><p>The students at my school love this place because of its low prices and huge servings.</p><p>And to add, Sakura really loves the food there.</p><hr><p>&quot;T-There&#39;s a lot in there. I thought you had potatoes in there.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;That&#39;s how I camouflaged it. I figured I&#39;d forget about it, so I put it where it&#39;d be found when we ran out of carrots.&quot;</p><p>I take out the time-bomb guarding against Fuji-Nee.</p><hr><p>&quot;So let&#39;s eat these as refreshments. Oh, or should we make this a mid-afternoon snack?</p><p>We just ate, so you two must be full.&quot;</p><p>I put the paper bag onto the tray so I won&#39;t forget about it.</p><hr><p>&quot;Huh...? A-Are you full, Senpai?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I am. Lunch was really good, so I ate about two meals worth. I think I won&#39;t get hungry for a while.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;I-I thought so too!</p><p>T-Then let&#39;s save the fun for later and\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>&quot;Are you saving them for later? I am still hungry.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh. Wow, you&#39;ve got room for more? That&#39;s amazing, considering that you ate as much as Sakura.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I am more interested in the food. Sugar is a source of energy, and I have never heard of &#39;dorayaki&#39; before.&quot;</p><hr><p>...I see.</p><p>A Japanese snack like this must be foreign to Saber, who is from a Western culture.</p><hr><p>&quot;Fair enough. Then here&#39;s some for dessert. There&#39;s more than enough for you, so we can keep the leftovers for a snack this afternoon.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh\u2015\u2015\u2015Senpai. Pardon me for asking, but how many did you buy...?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Hm? I think I bought five. Each of us gets one, and the remaining two can be shared or given to anyone who wants them.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;I see. According to that calculation, I can eat a maximum of three?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yeah. But you&#39;ll get heartburn if you eat so many sweets. ...Well, I guess you can handle three.&quot;</p><hr><p>I return to the living room with the tray.</p><p>To thank the two girls for doing the dishes, I prepare the dorayaki along with some tea.</p><hr><p>&quot;We are done. So that is dorayaki, Shirou?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Huh?&quot;</p><p>Then.</p><p>Saber is sitting there and staring at the tray, apparently ready to eat.</p><hr><p>Sakura quietly sits down beside her.</p><hr><p>&quot;Sakura? Is something wrong?&quot;</p><p>&quot;No, nothing&#39;s wrong. I&#39;m full, just like you.&quot;</p><p>&quot;...?&quot;</p><p>I don&#39;t understand, but I go ahead and pour some tea for the three of us.</p><hr><p>&quot;Itadakimasu.&quot;</p><p>She bows and reaches for the dorayaki.</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015The match is over in an instant.</p><p>After taking the tentative first bite, Saber quickly digs in with more enthusiasm.</p><p>Undeterred by its sweetness, she quickly finishes her first dorayaki.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015I see. It is a simple dessert, but it goes well with the tea.&quot;</p><p>She takes an elegant sip of tea and reaches for the second dorayaki.</p><p>Sakura watches nervously.</p><hr><p>&quot;......&quot;</p><p>...Hold on.</p><p>Is Sakura uneasy because...?</p><p>&quot;Hm. This is certainly more than just dessert.&quot;</p><p>Saber quickly finishes her second one and reaches out for the third.</p><hr><p>&quot;Hold on, Saber. Can you stop at two?&quot;</p><p>&quot;...? I do not mind, since I was only going to eat the excess share. Are you going to eat the rest, Shirou?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Sakura and I will eat them. I&#39;ll eat one, Sakura will eat one, and the last one...&quot;</p><p>I take the third dorayaki and break it in half.</p><p>&quot;...Sakura and I will share it. You can handle this, right?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Y-Yes, of course! I can eat it right now!&quot;</p><hr><p>As I thought.</p><p>Sakura was reserved for some reason.</p><p>Nobody would mind if she ate one or two dorayaki.</p><hr><p>&quot;Well, let&#39;s eat too.

Do you want to fight me right now...!?&quot;</p><p>I pull her off by force.</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>...Oh.</p><p>Illya looks unhappy.</p><hr><p>&quot;W-What? Don&#39;t think making faces will change anything! I don&#39;t know what your intention is, but I&#39;m a Master. You can&#39;t defeat me that easily\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>I glare at her, groceries in hand.</p><p>...But she only watches me in wonder.</p><hr><p>&quot;......Um, Illya?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yeah!? What, Shirou!?&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Ugh.&quot;</p><hr><p>She&#39;s different from before.</p><p>...Well, she was laughing then too, but it&#39;s not the same. Could it really be\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015?</p><p>&quot;...Illya. You didn&#39;t come here to fight...?&quot;</p><p>I ask timidly.</p><hr><p>&quot;What? Do you want to be killed?&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015!&quot;</p><p>Her glare sends a chill down my spine.</p><p>No matter how young this girl may be, she is the strongest Master.</p><p>She laughs innocently, but she can also become the ruthless Master.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Hmm. I don&#39;t get it, but I don&#39;t mind if you say so. I don&#39;t mind going ahead with my plans. Do you want to die along with Saber?&quot;</p><p>&quot;...Are you kidding me? Of course not! I don&#39;t want to die, and I don&#39;t want to fight you here.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Right? Masters can&#39;t fight during daytime. You don&#39;t have Saber with you, and I don&#39;t have Berserker with me.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...You&#39;re right. Then why did you come here? Did we just meet up by chance?&quot;</p><p>&quot;It&#39;s not chance. I snuck out under Sella&#39;s nose especially for you. You better be grateful.&quot;</p><p>Illya is inflated with pride.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>I feel dizzy.</p><p>Every time I think she turns into a cruel Master, she returns to being the innocent girl.</p><p>I can&#39;t tell which is the real Illya.</p><hr><p>&quot;...All right. So you came to see me.</p><p>But you have no intention of fighting me. Am I correct?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yup. I came to talk to you. I&#39;ve waited all this time, so I can, right?&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>I don&#39;t know what she means by &quot;all this time,&quot; but it seems Illya really did come just to talk to me.</p><hr><p>&quot;Or do you not want to? ...I&#39;ll go home if you don&#39;t. I really don&#39;t want to go home, but you&#39;ll hate me if I make you do something you don&#39;t want.&quot;</p><p>Illya looks straight into my eyes.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015!&quot;</p><p>...From a Master&#39;s point of view, it&#39;s dangerous to associate with Illya. If Saber were here, she&#39;d make her objections clear.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>...But I can&#39;t just walk away from her when she&#39;s making a face like that.</p><p>I know it&#39;s reckless, thoughtless, and rash, but...</p><hr><p>&quot;I don&#39;t mind talking with you. Actually, I wanted to.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;All right! Then let&#39;s go over that way! I found a small park over there earlier\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015!&quot;</p><p>Illya starts running.</p><hr><p>&quot;Come on, come on! I&#39;ll leave you behind if you don&#39;t hurry!&quot;</p><p>She twirls about as she runs.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Well, I guess it can&#39;t be helped.&quot;</p><p>I accept this event and follow after Illya.</p><p>She called me Shirou.</p><p>Then I should treat her like a normal girl, not like a Master.</p><hr><p>The park is empty.</p><p>Nobody is playing in the sand pit or on the swings.</p><p>It feels desolate, but I sit down on a bench with Illya.</p><hr><p>...I think this must look weird to other people.</p><p>Illya&#39;s a foreigner, so we don&#39;t look like siblings, and our ages are too far apart to be friends.</p><hr><p>&quot;...So. What do you want to talk about, Illya? You came to me, so do you have something you want to ask me?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Why? I have nothing I want to ask you.&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>Well.</p><p>How do I respond to that?</p><hr><p>&quot;...Illya. You&#39;re the one who wanted to talk.</p><p>So why do you say you have no business with me? You wouldn&#39;t come if that were true, right?&quot;</p><p>&quot;O-Oh, really? We can&#39;t talk if we don&#39;t have business?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Uhh... that&#39;s not what I meant. Sorry, I put it in the wrong way. We can talk even if we have no business. I guess it&#39;s better to talk without purpose.</p><p>But... honestly, I don&#39;t know you really well, so I don&#39;t know what I should talk about. I don&#39;t know what you like, or anything like that. You don&#39;t want me asking you about something you&#39;d rather not talk about, right?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Y-You&#39;re right... but what should I ask? Will you promise me you won&#39;t get mad even if I ask you anything?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I&#39;ll try. I&#39;m your Onii-chan, so I&#39;ll try to act mature.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I see. Then Shirou, do you like me?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;WHA\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015!?&quot;</p><p>W-W-W-W-W-What the hell is she asking!?</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh, you&#39;re a liar! You said you won&#39;t get mad, but you&#39;re mad!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Hey, anyone would be shocked by that question! Y-You shouldn&#39;t be asking that question when you&#39;ve already attacked me!&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Hey, that was different! You jumped in the way, even though you were weak! It&#39;s not my fault!&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;It is your fault! You were ready to kill from the beginning! So why are you talking about me liking you and whatnot!?&quot;</p><p>Illya quivers up and shuts up.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Oh.&quot;</p><p>...Crap.</p><p>Look what I did, right after I said I&#39;d forget about us being Masters.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Um, Illya?&quot;</p><p>&quot;......I asked because it&#39;s important to me. You&#39;re an idiot, Shirou. You still want to talk big, even though you would&#39;ve died if it weren&#39;t for me.&quot;</p><p>Illya looks down, her shoulders shaking.</p><hr><p>&quot;......Man.&quot;</p><p>I guess it can&#39;t be helped.</p><p>I&#39;m the one who started this whole Master conversation, I&#39;m the older one here, and Illya is a girl.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Ahem. Um, Illya...&quot;</p><p>I prepare myself for what I have to say.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015I don&#39;t mind it anymore. My wound healed up, and you let me go.</p><p>...But if it still bothers you, then I won&#39;t bring it up again. Is that all right?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh... yeah. Um, so you&#39;re not mad, Shirou...?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I don&#39;t know why, but I&#39;m not mad.</p><p>I want to talk to you more now.&quot;</p><hr><p>Illya was about to cry, but now she smiles.</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>Seeing her smile makes me happy as well.</p><p>She doesn&#39;t feel dangerous to me.</p><p>Then I should stop thinking like a Master.</p><p>I guess I&#39;ll have to talk with her, just like she wants\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>My conversation with Illya lasts for an hour.</p><p>Illya listens to my ordinary stories and meaningless talks.</p><hr><p>...Since when did it start feeling painful?</p><p>Illya is an innocent girl.</p><p>The fact that she&#39;s a Master and that she has no doubt in that fact...</p><p>I think it&#39;s sad that she goes into battle with no fear.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>A family of magi called Einzbern.</p><p>This young girl that is sent out as the greatest Master as a result of their thousand-year-old history.</p><hr><p>If that is Illya&#39;s goal, then...</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Illya. Can I ask you something?&quot;</p><p>&quot;What?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Do you recognize the name Emiya Kiritsugu?&quot;</p><p>...I have to ask her this.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>The air freezes.</p><p>It is an emotionless silence.</p><hr><p>&quot;No. I don&#39;t know of such a guy.&quot;</p><p>...Her silver hair flutters.</p><p>Illya gets up from the bench and twirls about like a fairy.</p><hr><p>&quot;It&#39;s getting late. Berserker wakes up at night, so I have to get going now.&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>Illya waves goodbye.</p><hr><p>&quot;Yeah, I should go home too.&quot;</p><p>I get up.</p><p>This is all the rest I&#39;m getting.</p><p>We&#39;ll have to fight as enemies again once the sun sets.</p><hr><p>But...</p><p>&quot;Can I talk with you again, Illya?&quot;</p><p>...I naturally ask this question.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015U-Um, I don&#39;t know. Do you want to see me again, Shirou?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Of course. I wouldn&#39;t ask you if I didn&#39;t want to.&quot;</p><p>&quot;......! Okay, then I&#39;ll come again tomorrow if I feel like it. Don&#39;t expect too much and keep waiting, okay?&quot;</p><p>She runs out of the park.</p><hr><p>...But.</p><p>She suddenly stops and...</p><hr><p>&quot;I was lying. I do know of him.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Illya\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015?&quot;</p><p>&quot;...I was given birth to this world to win the Holy Grail War. My goal is to kill you and Kiritsugu.&quot;</p><hr><p>She sprints off.</p><p>Illya leaves without turning around.</p><p>I watch her go until I can&#39;t see her anymore.</p><hr><h2 id="scene-08-winter-castle-illya" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#scene-08-winter-castle-illya" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Scene 08 Winter castle-Illya</h2><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Oh yeah\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>I forgot about it because of all the things that happened this morning, but I did make a promise with Illya.</p><p>...Well, it wasn&#39;t really a promise, but I&#39;d be really dishonest if I don&#39;t go, as I&#39;m the one who asked her if we could see each other again.</p><hr><p>&quot;Saber and Sakura are...&quot;</p><p>They&#39;re doing the dishes together.</p><p>If I tell them I&#39;m going out, they&#39;ll either stop me or insist on coming along.</p><hr><p>If I&#39;m going to go see Illya, I should do it alone.</p><p>I feel bad, but I&#39;ll just leave a note and sneak out\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Phew.&quot;</p><p>I managed to sneak out.</p><p>I left them a note saying, &quot;Going to buy stuff for dinner. Be back in an hour,&quot; so they shouldn&#39;t be too worried.</p><hr><p>&quot;Hm... So she&#39;s not here, as I thought.&quot;</p><p>There&#39;s no one in the park.</p><p>Even with the apartments looming overhead, this place is so cold that it feels like it&#39;ll start snowing at any moment.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Well, I don&#39;t know what I&#39;d talk about even if she were here.&quot;</p><p>I sit on the bench.</p><p>Setting the grocery bag down, I look up at the dark sky.</p><p>...It seems the gift I bought at the shopping district went to waste.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>I stare at the sky absent-mindedly.</p><p>It must be because this place is surrounded by buildings.</p><p>Only a tiny square of sky is visible, and it seems farther away than usual.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015It&#39;s cold.&quot;</p><p>I can see my breath.</p><p>The cold, dry air is freezing, and I wouldn&#39;t be surprised even if it started snowing.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Well, I should go home.&quot;</p><p>I grab the grocery bag and get up.</p><p>It&#39;s past two o&#39;clock.</p><p>I have to leave now if I&#39;m going to be home in time.</p><hr><p>&quot;Huh\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015?&quot;</p><p>My legs freeze.</p><p>They won&#39;t move.</p><p>They don&#39;t even budge, no matter how hard I try\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>My vision blurs.</p><p>No, that&#39;s an understatement.</p><p>My vision is broken.</p><p>My eyes have bulged into my skull, and I have no sense of distance.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Ah\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>I realize that I&#39;m in the worst situation possible.</p><p>It feels like my body has been turned into stone.</p><p>My nerves are disconnected, leaving me detached from the world.</p><p>It&#39;s like I&#39;m watching the world through a camera, controlling myself in a video game.</p><hr><p>&quot;Sa... ber\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>I&#39;ll be killed.</p><p>It was a mistake to go outside alone.</p><hr><p>I can&#39;t even see my attacker&#39;s face, let alone move, and\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><p>&quot;Did I surprise you?</p><p>You were completely defenseless, so I had to tease you.&quot;</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015Um, I&#39;m being teased by this mischievous girl?</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh, you&#39;re back to normal. I guess contacting you through vision isn&#39;t that strong.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Il\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><hr><p>She appears from behind me.</p><p>She&#39;s smiling, probably because she was already here and was watching me from behind.</p><hr><p>&quot;But you&#39;re no good if you can&#39;t dispel magecraft using your own powers. Your future looks gloomy if outside factors are the only things that can dispel you.&quot;</p><p>She lectures me.</p><p>But her words aren&#39;t coming into my brain.</p><hr><p>&quot;Illya\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015! What are you doing!? Surprise attacks are unfair, even if we&#39;re both Masters!&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Hey, that wasn&#39;t a surprise attack. I was sitting next to you for a while. But you didn&#39;t notice me, and then you made it worse by getting ready to leave. That was your own fault, Shirou.&quot;</p><p>&quot;...!? Y-You were sitting next to me this whole time?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Yeah, I was hiding a bit. But you&#39;re too careless. You didn&#39;t notice my presence, and you were captivated by a spell that merely uses direct magical energy contact. You&#39;re a Master, so you should keep a better watch on your surroundings.&quot;</p><p>Illya warns me, utterly amazed.</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015yeah. You&#39;re right.&quot;</p><p>She seems so much like a teacher that I find myself nodding.</p><hr><p>&quot;It&#39;s good if you understand.</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015So, what&#39;s going on today? You&#39;re empty inside right now, but you don&#39;t have Saber with you. If you&#39;re trying to rest, wouldn&#39;t it be safer to do it at home?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Huh? Well, I didn&#39;t come here to rest.</p><p>Well, you&#39;re right that not bringing Saber was careless of me.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Right? I couldn&#39;t leave you alone because you seemed so odd. I wasn&#39;t supposed to talk to you after yesterday, but I&#39;ll make an exception for today.&quot;</p><p>&quot;...?&quot;</p><p>Illya&#39;s saying something strange.</p><p>After all, I came to this park because...</p><hr><p>&quot;So, why were you just sitting here?</p><p>You would&#39;ve been dead if I came here as a Master.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Well, I just came here to see you.</p><p>You told me yesterday that we could meet again.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015What?&quot;</p><p>Oh, she&#39;s surprised.</p><p>...Well, it&#39;s not like it was an official promise.</p><hr><p>&quot;Why...? You came to see me, even though I told you I&#39;ll be trying to kill you?&quot;</p><p>&quot;That&#39;s your choice. It&#39;s not mine. I just want to talk to you, not fight. And in any case\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><hr><p>Illya said she&#39;d kill me, but she just let a chance go by.</p><p>She could&#39;ve really done it if she&#39;d kept her spell on me.</p><p>As she didn&#39;t do so, I don&#39;t want to fight her.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Masters don&#39;t fight during daytime, right?</p><p>Then let&#39;s forget about it for now. I just came here to see you. Do you want to kill me more than you want to talk with me?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Eh\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015? T-That&#39;s an unfair question. I have to do both. It&#39;s fun to talk with you, but I can&#39;t forgive you. So I can&#39;t choose just one.&quot;</p><hr><p>Illya hangs her head and mumbles.</p><p>She looks serious, like she&#39;s actually suffering rather than just being troubled.</p><hr><p>&quot;...I see. Then I don&#39;t care. I won&#39;t ask you to choose one.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh... B-But I...&quot;</p><p>&quot;I know. But since we&#39;re both here, let&#39;s talk.</p><p>I brought a gift for you today, so we&#39;ll fight some other time.&quot;</p><hr><p>I take out a bag of taiyaki.</p><p>They cooled off while I was waiting for Illya, but they&#39;re still a bit warm.</p><hr><p>&quot;Here&#39;s the offering. I&#39;ll give you these, so please let me go this time.&quot;</p><p>I hold out the taiyaki.</p><p>&quot;Oh\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>Illya hesitates, but then takes them and nods.</p><hr><p>I&#39;m not too sure what we talked about after that.</p><p>We talked about meaningless things:</p><p>What she likes to eat, what she doesn&#39;t like to eat, how she likes birds and hates cats, how she likes snow and hates the cold, how she wants to play but can&#39;t, and how she doesn&#39;t like her maids but wants to like them.</p><hr><p>Illya looks happy just to be talking.</p><p>She is sitting on the bench, eating the taiyaki, and swinging her legs.</p><p>...She looks like a child waiting for her father&#39;s return.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015I see. So you didn&#39;t come to this town by yourself?&quot;</p><p>&quot;No, I came with Sella and Leysritt. I don&#39;t need people to keep an eye on me, but I do need people to take care of my place, right?&quot;</p><hr><p>...So Illya came to Japan with two maids.</p><p>Are they staying at a hotel or something?</p><hr><p>&quot;What? Are you curious? Do you want to know where I live?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Eh... yeah, I&#39;m curious. You keep popping up at unexpected times, but what would I do if an emergency happens and I don&#39;t know where you live?&quot;</p><hr><p>Even if she gets injured and asks me for help, I won&#39;t be able to if I don&#39;t know that.</p><p>I&#39;ll rest a little easier if I know where she lives\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015All right. You&#39;re special. If you want to know that badly, I&#39;ll tell you.&quot;</p><p>Then.</p><p>Illya stands up and places her hand on my forehead.</p><hr><p>&quot;Whoa\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015hey, Illya...&quot;</p><p>&quot;Just be quiet. You&#39;ll enter some other place if you resist me too hard. It&#39;s troublesome to return things to normal if that happens.&quot;</p><p>She glares at me.</p><p>&quot;Oh\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015okay.&quot;</p><p>Under that kind of pressure, I can only nod obediently.</p><hr><p>&quot;That&#39;s a good boy. Then close your eyes. And don&#39;t look around too much, okay? Even though I&#39;m transferring you, you&#39;ll get motion sickness because the view is someone else&#39;s.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015!&quot;</p><p>Illya places her forehead onto mine.</p><p>I&#39;m surprised, but I close my eyes.</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015At that moment...</p><hr><p>My vision accelerates and expands.</p><p>No, was it my consciousness that expanded?</p><p>The next thing I know, I&#39;m looking down at an unfamiliar scene.</p><hr><p>&quot;Can you see it? I transferred your vision to my forest.&quot;</p><hr><p>Illya&#39;s voice echoes in my head.</p><p>I can&#39;t reply, nor nod back.</p><p>This &quot;vision&quot; is the only thing allowed for me.</p><p>I&#39;m one of the trees in the forest.</p><p>It&#39;s natural that my body doesn&#39;t move.</p><p>My body has been turned into a tree in an instant.</p><hr><p>&quot;Did you memorize the route? Then I&#39;ll transfer you to the castle wall now.&quot;</p><hr><p>The scene changes.</p><p>My vision is the only sense I have.</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015I still exist, but I can&#39;t feel myself.</p><hr><p>I&#39;m a wall now.</p><p>I can sense my limbs, but there are no limbs for me to move. I have a body that can move at will, yet I can&#39;t move it.</p><hr><p>&quot;Leysritt. I cannot find Illyasviel-sama. Do you know where she may be?&quot;</p><p>&quot;......No. Illya should be somewhere.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Leysritt. Please do not refer to our lady so crudely. Illyasviel-sama is not like us. Have you forgotten our mission?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Sella is Illya&#39;s teacher. I&#39;m to dress Illya with Heavens Feel, the third dress.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Correct. It seems even your poor memory can retain that.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;......I didn&#39;t forget. ...But Illya hates wearing that. So I don&#39;t like it.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...I understand that as well. But we need her to wear it when the time comes. We were made for that purpose.</p><p>She must be prepared as well.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;......Sella.&quot;</p><p>&quot;What is it, Leysritt?&quot;</p><p>&quot;......Don&#39;t you get tired?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Not at all!&quot;</p><hr><p>...I hear two identical maids talking.</p><p>When I realize those two are the maids Illya was talking about...</p><hr><p>...I finally return to my body.</p><hr><p>&quot;How was it? That was some great transformation magecraft, right?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Uh\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Uh...&quot;</p><hr><p>...I hold my mouth and bear my nausea.</p><p>I feel sick, suddenly feeling the realism of my body.</p><hr><p>&quot;Illya... What was that?&quot;</p><p>&quot;It&#39;s transfer of consciousness. I moved your vision into some other object.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;There&#39;s a nerve going from your eyes to your brain, right? I connected that nerve to something other than your eyes.</p><p>You were getting information from the trees in my forest instead of your eyes.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;......Hm. So it&#39;s not that I became the tree, but I received their vision and mistakenly thought I was one?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh, I thought you were dense, but you&#39;re actually pretty bright.</p><p>Yes, that&#39;s right. That was magecraft to change the input while leaving the equipment called human alone.</p><p>It&#39;s a big deal to change someone into a tree, but it&#39;s still in the realms of magecraft to connect one&#39;s consciousness to a tree. Far-sight and possession are an application of this magecraft.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;......I see. But that&#39;s pretty impressive stuff. I couldn&#39;t do anything when you transferred me to the tree. Couldn&#39;t you also use it to nullify your opponent?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Yes. Our specialty is in flow and transfer of power.</p><p>For example, Tohsaka magi can transfer their magical energy into jewels without diluting its purity. Using that same technique, they can also transfer someone&#39;s consciousness.</p><p>If there&#39;s an enemy they want to seal, they can nullify him by transferring his consciousness into a jewel or an immobile doll.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;But the success rate of transferring someone&#39;s consciousness is so low that even we, the ones specialized in transfer, won&#39;t use it as an attack.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;The one I did to you was an exception. You didn&#39;t resist, and that forest is mine. It&#39;s normally much harder to connect things.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;And your consciousness will be forced to return if the original body is stimulated in any way.</p><p>The body will call its consciousness back when it senses danger, even if the consciousness is unaware.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;That&#39;s what happened to you just now.</p><p>You couldn&#39;t do anything when your mind was in the tree, but your body called you back when I shook it.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...Hm. So this is something like a dream?&quot;</p><p>You can never wake up from a dream, no matter how hard you try.</p><p>Dreams usually end when morning comes\u2015\u2015\u2015when the body wakes up out of habit.</p><hr><p>&quot;Hmm, it&#39;s a bit different. You can wake up from a dream using your will.</p><p>But that&#39;s why transferral is not fit for offense. It&#39;s more for self-protection.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;If you transfer your consciousness to your familiar or a doll that can move, you can safely pursue magecraft.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;......So your consciousness just returns to your original body even if an enemy destroys your familiar?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Yes. Magi who transfer their minds usually hide their original bodies in a safe place.</p><p>In cases like this, you need to watch out when you transfer into a familiar with its own soul.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;When you transfer your consciousness into something with a proper chain of command, the initiative is completely held by them.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;So even if you transfer into humans or animals, you can only occupy a corner of their brain and observe what they see. They will serve as a camera, not a remote-controlled robot.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Moving your consciousness into a living thing with its own will is more like reincarnation than transfer.</p><p>That alone is a great magecraft, so no ordinary magus would be able to do it.&quot;</p><hr><p>...Reincarnation.</p><p>magecraft to create an offspring with your soul in it after you die.</p><p>Some magi have achieved that goal, but I hear that reproducing a soul is difficult.</p><hr><p>Even if you start over from the moment of birth, if you cannot inherit all the power of your previous self, you are a copy, not a reincarnation.</p><p>A copy is degraded by its very nature.</p><p>Therefore, a copied magus is inferior to his previous self.</p><hr><p>&quot;If you want to transfer yourself into a living thing, you can make a familiar without a soul.</p><p>But the soulless familiars used today are weak. It&#39;s just like controlling a doll filled with cotton.</p><p>They&#39;re only useful as messengers.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;And even if you transfer your consciousness into a familiar or doll, you will disappear if your original body grows old and dies.</p><p>It&#39;s not immortality.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;The only eternal things in this physical world are souls.</p><p>But nobody can keep souls by themselves. A soul cannot stay in this world without a body, and it will be destined with &#39;eventual death&#39; once it obtains a body.</p><p>Well, it just means that&#39;s the limit of magecraft by Einzbern and Tohsaka.&quot;</p><hr><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015Then.</p><p>A bell rings the time.</p><p>The clock in the park points at three.</p><p>I guess it&#39;s already been an hour.</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh... I have to get going. Are you going home too?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Hm? Yeah, I should be heading home.&quot;</p><hr><p>Illya nods and walks to the middle of the park.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Okay. I shouldn&#39;t say this, but...&quot;</p><p>The white girl asks me...</p><hr><p>&quot;Will you come see me again tomorrow, Shirou?&quot;</p><p>...As if she knows I&#39;m going to refuse.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>You idiot.</p><p>I don&#39;t even need to answer.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015Of course I&#39;ll come tomorrow. You showed me your house, so it&#39;s my turn next.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Okay! Then I&#39;ll be sure to call out to you first tomorrow!&quot;</p><hr><p>Illya runs off.</p><p>Under the cloudy sky...</p><p>The white-haired girl looks like a fairy.</p><hr><h2 id="scene-09-a-big-pinch" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#scene-09-a-big-pinch" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Scene 09 A big pinch</h2><p>&quot;I&#39;m home.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Where were you, Shirou!?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Where did you go, Senpai!?&quot;</p><p>&quot;W-Whoa\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015!?&quot;</p><p>I jump back, bumping against the front door.</p><hr><p>&quot;No, not &#39;whoa&#39;!

How do you know that?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I had a lookout there. ...Well, I guess nothing happened, seeing that you&#39;re okay. I imagined something slightly bad since you weren&#39;t at school today.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh, so you thought I was killed?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yeah. I thought you were torn apart and buried on that mountain.&quot;</p><p>&quot;......&quot;</p><p>Well...</p><p>I don&#39;t think that&#39;s a &quot;slightly bad imagination&quot;.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015Sorry to disappoint you, but I&#39;m doing great...

Are you okay, Sakura? It&#39;s cold outside.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes, my fever&#39;s almost gone. I came outside to refresh myself and heard a sound, so I thought it might be you.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;I see. Then all that&#39;s left is to warm yourself up and go back to sleep.

And you&#39;re really forceful.</p><p>You didn&#39;t listen to me earlier, either.&quot;</p><hr><p>...?</p><p>Even though Sakura&#39;s criticizing me, she&#39;s in a good mood.</p><p>...Well, I&#39;m too happy to see her doing well to care about that.</p><hr><p>&quot;...I&#39;m sorry. I was too angry to think straight.&quot;</p><p>&quot;You&#39;re right. You were just as mad at me as at yourself. ...Yes. I&#39;m causing you lots of trouble. But I really was sorry because I thought I did something awful.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;......&quot;</p><p>Sakura is perfectly composed.</p><p>It&#39;s probably partly because she just got over a cold, but she&#39;s not merely putting on a strong face. This seems like the &quot;real&quot; Sakura to me.</p><hr><p>&quot;I remember when I was a child.</p><p>I always stayed in the house and couldn&#39;t say what I wanted. I thought everything would work out if I didn&#39;t say anything.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...But it didn&#39;t do any good. I didn&#39;t want to worry anyone, but never speaking worried Nii-san and my dad even more.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...I see. But it&#39;s true that you cared for your father and Shinji, so I bet they knew how you felt. There are things that can be communicated without words.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Yes. I hope that&#39;s true.</p><p>...So what about you, Senpai? I don&#39;t hear much about when you were a child.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Uh, me...? Hmm, I don&#39;t think I was too different. I was always running throughout the town during the daytime, making meals for my father, and messing around with stuff here at night.&quot;</p><p>I get embarrassed, so I scratch my cheek.</p><p>...Does it mean I&#39;m a failure as a man if I haven&#39;t changed from when I was a kid?</p><hr><p>&quot;Wow. You were running throughout the town?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yeah... I thought I was patrolling the town. I admired helping the weak and crushing the strong.&quot;</p><hr><p>My battlefield was mainly in the park.</p><p>I think it was an everyday thing to fight with children my age against people older than me.</p><p>...Hmm, now that I think about it, a smart and devil-like person was in my age group too...</p><hr><p>&quot;I see, so you were protecting the town from bullies? You were like that even when you were little?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Sakura. Smiling like that reminds me of all the stupid things I did, so please stop. It&#39;s pretty embarrassing.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;It&#39;s not embarrassing at all. I would&#39;ve been your sidekick if I met you as a child.</p><p>A shy person like me needs someone to drag her outside.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...A sidekick?&quot;</p><p>...Oh. Well, I might have trained Sakura every day if she&#39;d been with me as a child.</p><p>I would&#39;ve run by the river or sat in the dojo with her.</p><hr><p>That&#39;s pretty much what a sidekick would do.</p><p>Under my watchful eye, Sakura would become strong, and then she would turn into a devil like...</p><hr><p>Her,</p><p>or her.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Ugh.&quot;</p><p>A chill runs down my spine.</p><p>Good. I&#39;m really glad that Sakura is modest.</p><hr><p>&quot;Um, Senpai?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Huh? Oh, I was out of it. I was just talking to myself, so please don&#39;t worry about it.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...Okay. That&#39;s fine, but, um... Can I ask you an awkward question?&quot;</p><p>&quot;...? Okay, what?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...I heard this from Fujimura-Sensei. Is it true that you were adopted into the Emiya family?&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015Huh? Didn&#39;t I tell you? I&#39;m adopted, just like Fuji-Nee told you.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;U-Um, Senpai? That means...&quot;</p><p>&quot;Well, it&#39;s true, and it&#39;s nothing I should hide. Why are you asking such a thing?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Eh... um, don&#39;t you care about it? You were adopted into a stranger&#39;s family, so, um... weren&#39;t there a lot of things you didn&#39;t like?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh, did Fuji-Nee give you the wrong idea?</p><p>...Well, it might&#39;ve looked that way when I first came here, but it wasn&#39;t hard on me, and there was nothing I didn&#39;t like.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Then was it fun for you, Senpai?&quot;</p><hr><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Hm.</p><p>This is the first time I&#39;ve been asked this question.</p><p>After that fire...</p><p>...My first year here was spent healing my wounds.</p><hr><p>...And after that...</p><p>My time until now has been spent in constant motion.</p><p>I studied magecraft to be more like Kiritsugu,</p><p>and I ran around the town, looking for the reason why only I survived that night.</p><hr><p>I never had time to wonder if I was enjoying myself.</p><hr><p>&quot;Hmm, I don&#39;t know. I don&#39;t know if it was fun for me or not. I just wanted to be like my father.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;You mean to be a superhero, like Fujimura-Sensei said?&quot;</p><p>Sakura asks timidly.</p><p>To that...</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Yeah. Is that weird?&quot;</p><p>I answer while scratching my cheek.</p><hr><p>&quot;No, I don&#39;t think so. It&#39;s amazing that you&#39;re so sure of yourself.&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>Her words are calm.</p><p>I usually get embarrassed from such words, but her words hit me so much that I&#39;m tempted to thank her.</p><hr><p>&quot;Here&#39;s another question. Would you be able to forgive me if I become a bad person?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;What...?&quot;</p><p>My head blanks out from the sudden question.</p><p>...But to answer seriously...</p><p>&quot;No. I&#39;d get mad if you do something bad. I&#39;d get more mad than anybody else.&quot;</p><p>I&#39;d probably be first in line to scold her.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015I&#39;m glad. I&#39;d want you to do that.&quot;</p><p>Sakura nods in relief.</p><hr><p>&quot;...?&quot;</p><p>Seeing her smile makes me think that something like this happened before.</p><hr><p>&quot;I&#39;m going back to my room. Good night, Senpai.&quot;</p><p>Sakura leaves.</p><p>As I see her off, I try to remember where I&#39;ve seen that smile before, but my memory fails me.</p><hr><p>I return to my room.</p><p>I lie on my futon, trying not to wake Saber, and right when I&#39;m about to close my eyes...</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015I remember now.&quot;</p><p>In a sudden flash of insight, it comes back to me.</p><p>Yes, it was\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015It was in the shed, just like tonight.</p><p>It was two years ago... no, one and a half years to be exact.</p><hr><p>It happened during the summer two years ago.</p><p>I continued to refuse every time Sakura offered to come help me at my house.</p><p>But Sakura did not give up and kept visiting my house with obstinacy you would never expect from her.</p><hr><p>I gave up\u2015\u2015\u2015well, Sakura&#39;s effort beat me to be exact, but I called Sakura to the shed and admitted my defeat.</p><p>&quot;You beat me. I lost, so I&#39;ll give you this.&quot;</p><hr><p>It was an old key.</p><p>I gave Sakura the key to my house that I kept in the shed which Kiritsugu used to use.</p><hr><p>Surprised, Sakura tried to refuse.</p><p>She said something ridiculous about how a stranger couldn&#39;t possibly accept such a gift.</p><hr><p>&quot;Hey now. You&#39;re coming to help me every day, so you&#39;re no stranger.</p><p>Please feel free to use this. ...Um, it would help me out if you did.&quot;</p><hr><p>I forced the key into her hands.</p><p>And that&#39;s when I saw it.</p><p>&quot;...Okay. Thank you, Senpai. This is the second gift I&#39;ve received from someone dear to me.&quot;</p><p>Sakura smiled happily as she nodded.</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015I see.&quot;</p><p>That&#39;s what&#39;s been bugging me.</p><p>Sakura works hard and always has a warm smile.</p><p>But that was the last time her smile looked satisfied\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><hr><h2 id="scene-18-intermission-hero-s-death" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#scene-18-intermission-hero-s-death" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Scene 18 Intermission Hero&#39;s death</h2><p>The Ryuudou Temple.</p><p>The land is desolate after Caster has disappeared.</p><p>The monks, who have collapsed from an unknown cause, have left the mountain to leave the temple empty.</p><p>The gate is shut firmly, so neither worshippers nor monks can enter the place.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015Damn, what a stench. This is a real stinker.&quot;</p><p>A voice echoes through the place that should be desolate.</p><p>A lean blue figure glows in the moonlight.</p><p>The sturdily-built man with the crimson spear is a Servant called Lancer.</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh, wow. The boundary field is still here, even though Caster&#39;s dead?</p><p>...No, this is too crude. Her work was much more polished than this.&quot;</p><hr><p>Lancer looks around the temple.</p><p>The red lance is in his hand.</p><p>His objectives are to gain information and to keep watch.</p><p>He is unwilling, but he cannot disobey his Master&#39;s command.</p><p>It is his policy to follow any command given to him, and to accomplish the mission.</p><p>That is why he has fought several Servants and ended up in a draw with each.</p><hr><p>As long as he serves this Master, Lancer will never start a fight.</p><p>This is no exception, and he is to investigate the Ryuudou Temple.</p><p>If that is the case, why is his lance in his hand?</p><p>His weapon, his Noble Phantasm, can be summoned whenever needed.</p><p>There is no need for him to hold his lance when there is no enemy before him.</p><hr><p>&quot;Damn, what a racket. I thought Caster was the master of wind, but maybe she used water instead. This place is crawling with leeches and spiders\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><hr><p>He walks through the temple.</p><p>He seems too vulnerable and defenseless to be a Servant.</p><p>He is so defenseless that if\u2015\u2015\u2015this is an if\u2015\u2015\u2015there is another Servant here, he would be attacked and killed in an instant.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015But who knows? Maybe the head has been replaced.</p><p>There&#39;s nothing here but rotten insects. It&#39;s your habitual practice to nest on deserted houses.&quot;</p><hr><p>Lancer doesn&#39;t stop cursing.</p><p>The blue spearman gives a speech as if to persuade a person who is not here.</p><hr><p>&quot;But there&#39;s one big one.</p><p>I don&#39;t know where it was born, but it looks like it was raised by beasts deep within a mountain. And what is this, a smell of sand?</p><p>Hah, I thought you were a big spider, but you turned out to be a dirty sandworm.</p><p>Why the hell should I have to come and investigate a wretch like you\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015whoa!&quot;</p><hr><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015The silver lights are deflected.</p><p>Three rays of light streak forth from the darkness, only to be struck down by Lancer&#39;s lance.</p><hr><p>The deflected lights are daggers called &quot;Dark&quot;.</p><p>They are not a weapon to be held onto and to slash with, but a weapon to be thrown.</p><p>These daggers were thrown with great speed at Lancer&#39;s eyes and throat.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015You&#39;re pretty good. But don&#39;t do that again, sandworm.</p><p>I don&#39;t like getting killed without a greeting first, and more importantly, it will be fatal for you.&quot;</p><hr><p>The blue figure stands firm before the darkness.</p><p>In the darkness in front of Lancer is...</p><hr><p>...A laughing skull, white as the moon.</p><hr><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015The battle starts without a signal.</p><p>Lacking human words, the white skull attacks Lancer with an inhuman shriek,</p><p>and Lancer meets his assault without twitching a brow.</p><hr><p>The skull tosses daggers with a precision rivaling that of Archer.</p><p>Thirty are thrown from close range as he runs through the darkness.</p><p>But Lancer easily repels every one.</p><hr><p>&quot;Ki\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015?&quot;</p><p>The skull comes to an abrupt stop.</p><p>It is abnormal.</p><p>No matter how great a spearman Lancer may be, he could not possibly block all the daggers.</p><p>Furthermore, he is using a long lance.</p><p>How are the daggers, fired accurately in between his swings, all deflected?</p><hr><p>&quot;Hey. Don&#39;t tell me that&#39;s all you can do.&quot;</p><p>Lancer&#39;s presence changes.</p><p>He stops, and his hostility changes to a clear intent to kill.</p><hr><p>&quot;Then this is it.</p><p>I don&#39;t know who you are... well, I guess I&#39;ll at least take off that mask of yours.&quot;</p><hr><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015Daggers flash though the darkness.</p><p>A rapid barrage is unleashed as a counter to Lancer&#39;s charge\u2015\u2015\u2015!</p><hr><p>But he blocks even that.</p><p>Although the daggers cannot be perceived, he turns them aside with a slight swing of his spear.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>The skull is the one shivering.</p><p>Unable to speak human language, he can only swallow his scream and watch as the enemy comes to take his life\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015, Kii\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015!&quot;</p><p>He throws a dagger at the small opening in between Lancer&#39;s strikes...!</p><hr><p>&quot;Kii...!&quot;</p><p>The skull&#39;s mask trembles.</p><p>Lancer blocks the dagger, turns the spear in a full circle, and smacks his opponent&#39;s chin from below.</p><hr><p>Defense and counter.</p><p>He performs both actions in one motion.</p><p>Already committed to his attack, the skull cannot respond to such a maneuver.</p><hr><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015The white mask falls from his face.</p><p>Lancer does not keep attacking.</p><p>His order is merely to observe his foes.</p><p>Even if this is a sure chance to kill, he has no authority to attack.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015You idiot. I told you projectile weapons are useless against me. You&#39;re the one who didn&#39;t listen to my warning.&quot;</p><hr><p>Lancer readies his lance again and regards his enemy, who is now hiding his face.</p><p>A black body.</p><p>A right hand covered in bandages.</p><p>A face still hidden by the darkness.</p><hr><p>No.</p><p>His face is flat and utterly featureless.</p><hr><p>&quot;Gi\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015yoU SAw My FaCe, Lan, cer.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I&#39;m about to. I&#39;m sure you&#39;re a Servant, so let me check out which hero you are.&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015Kuh. I sEE, YOu HavE A bINd. No WONdeR YoU, DiD, Not KilL, me.&quot;</p><hr><p>The Servant retreats further into the shadows.</p><p>He still has the Dark in his hand, and his hostility is still emitting.</p><hr><p>&quot;Don&#39;t even try. It&#39;s my nature, but projectile attacks from a visible opponent aren&#39;t effective against me. You can&#39;t hurt me using a projectile unless it&#39;s some great Noble Phantasm.&quot;</p><p>&quot;...! \u2015\u2015\u2015I sEE, PRoteCtIon AgaiNst ArrOws. ...Kuku, as EXpecTed frOm a HeRo WIth A nAMe. YoU Are nOT LIKe mE.&quot;</p><hr><p>The shadow wavers.</p><p>The black Servant sinks down to the ground,</p><p>then springs up in an instant as he throws another dagger.</p><hr><p>If his leap is that of a deer, his movements are those of a spider, snake, or scorpion.</p><p>Even while keeping his face hidden, this Servant is as fast as Lancer when it comes to retreat.</p><p>But Lancer&#39;s charge is still the fastest.</p><p>It is a disgrace to take even a minute to corner his enemy.</p><hr><p>&quot;Damn\u2015\u2015\u2015I know I destroyed his throat, but he&#39;s persistent. It doesn&#39;t seem like it&#39;s healed, so he must be drugged\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><hr><p>The enemy glides across the water like a spider, and Lancer pursues him.</p><p>In contrast, water sprays from his footsteps, but his speed is far greater.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Hmph. If I&#39;d known the pain wouldn&#39;t stop him, I would&#39;ve cut his joints. I put that off since it doesn&#39;t work on other opponents, but\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><hr><p>It is fatal for a human body to be cut at the joint, where the main arteries lie.</p><p>If the arteries are severed, death from severe bleeding will quickly follow.</p><p>But that is only in normal combat.</p><p>You cannot expect a Servant, a heroic spirit, to die from excessive bleeding.</p><hr><p>As their lifeforce is magical energy, cutting their arteries does not have much effect.</p><p>The loss of a limb is another story, but cutting off a Servant&#39;s limb is a difficult task.</p><p>Doing so will likely cost you your own head in the process.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Hashish, huh? I bet a heroic spirit who relies on drugs doesn&#39;t have healing powers. I&#39;ll end this fight with my next attack\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>Water splashes with lightning speed.</p><p>His next attack will strike in two more seconds.</p><p>He tenses, then thrusts at his fleeing enemy&#39;s left leg\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015!&quot;</p><p>With a start, Lancer jumps back from the water&#39;s surface.</p><hr><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Water explodes upward.</p><p>No, something beneath the water is snarling.</p><p>Black tendrils snake out of the water, reaching for the spearman.</p><p>Is it because this creature dwells underwater?</p><p>It seems to resemble a deep-sea monster from ancient times.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015What... the...?&quot;</p><p>Lancer has nowhere to run.</p><p>He instantly carves all his runes on the bottom of the lake to create a boundary field, but it is easily penetrated.</p><hr><p>The dark tentacles are closing in on all sides, and his territory is shrinking by the second.</p><p>The protection using all his Runes, which can even block a great Noble Phantasm, does not even slow down the penetration.</p><p>Watching Lancer\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><p>&quot;WHaT iS WrOng, LAncEr?

Well, I can understand why you feel that way.&quot;</p><p>Lancer observes the ghastly limbs around him.</p><p>He was lured quite far in, but it&#39;s only about thirty meters to the opposite shore.</p><p>He should be able to easily jump across such a distance...!</p><hr><p>&quot;You lost because you wouldn&#39;t move from there.
