Please do not worry and leave it to me.\u201D</p><p>\u201CNo, it&#39;s not that. I just want you to tag along, Saber.\u201D</p><p>\u201CAnd I must refrain.

You must need someone to help you carry them. I will tell Reikan I&#39;ll be coming in late.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CY-Yes! I&#39;ll be ready in just a second!\u201D</p><p>As Kuzuki-sensei nods, Caster returns hurriedly to her room.</p><hr><p>\u201CWell then. Since you are staying overnight, I suppose we will be meeting again.\u201D</p><p>We exchange a light farewell.</p><p>No matter where he is, at school or at home, he emits a constant aura of alertness.</p><p>And Caster&#39;s &quot;newlywed&quot; play still creeps me out.</p><hr><p>\u201CMorning.

You&#39;re late, Emiya.\u201D</p><p>\u201CGood morning, Senpai.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C...Err, what is that?\u201D</p><p>There is Mitsuzuri rolling on the floor in the middle of the room.</p><hr><p>\u201C...You sure look happy, Mitsuzuri.\u201D</p><p>\u201COf course I am! It really pays to be at a rich temple!</p><p>Look at this tatami. It&#39;s brand new! Wouldn&#39;t you, as a Japanese person, want to roll around on it?</p><p>I&#39;m so envious... I bet Issei&#39;s already rolled around on it yesterday.\u201D</p><p>\u201CNonsense! I&#39;m not some panda at a zoo!\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CAh, okay. That&#39;s fine, then. Let us enjoy it while he can&#39;t.</p><p>Come, Matou! Let&#39;s do it together! It&#39;s so refreshing!\u201D</p><p>\u201CI-I&#39;m okay... Um, Mitsuzuri-senpai... this is a temple, you know...\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CMmmm, the overwhelming smell of grass!</p><p>This party room shall be claimed by our archery club!\u201D</p><p>Plop. Thud. It&#39;s morning, and Mitsuzuri&#39;s in perfect spirits already.</p><hr><p>\u201CMitsuzuri. It is as Matou-kun has said. This is neither a party room nor a place for a banquet. To be precise, this is a lecture hall.</p><p>The hall where the eight scrolls of the Lotus Sutra are read, it is the place to study Buddhist virtues; that is, a place dedicated to learning.</p><p>Even during a training camp, you must remain solem\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><p>\u201CC&#39;mon, c&#39;mon! Backflip with your legs apart!\u201D</p><p>Sakura seems troubled, but is at the same time impressed by how flexible Mitsuzuri is.</p><hr><p>\u201C...Emiya, I beg you, do something about that raging panda.\u201D</p><p>\u201CLet her have her fun. We did it a lot ourselves, too, you know.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CAnd just when did we do that?\u201D</p><p>\u201CHahaha. You were the one who made a hole in the door, but I got into trouble too, remember?\u201D</p><p>\u201CWha\u2015\u2015\u2015!\u201D</p><p>\u201CHehe.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CG-Good morning, everyone!\u201D</p><p>\u201CExcuse me.\u201D</p><p>\u201CWoah, it&#39;s huuuge!</p><p>I-Is this the legendary thousand-mat tatami room!?\u201D</p><p>\u201CMaki-chan?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CUuuoooyaaaah!!! Diving front roll!\u201D</p><p>Tadadadada!\u2015\u2015\u2015Makidera swims in the sea of tatami. A front roll, twist, followed by a splendid backflip.</p><p>\u201CM-Maki-chan, no!\u201D</p><p>\u201CShe&#39;s the type who just has to swim in an open-air hot spring. It wasn&#39;t exactly unexpected.\u201D</p><hr><p>Issei pokes my shoulder.</p><p>\u201CEmiya. Are we going to make it through this? This lasts for two days. I&#39;m very worried\u2015\u2015\u2015no, actually, I&#39;m terrified.\u201D</p><p>\u201C...Yeah. It&#39;s not something we can just laugh off.</p><p>I&#39;m definitely going to get in trouble by association again.\u201D</p><hr><p>Both of us have plenty of cause to worry.</p><p>Makidera belly flops in the middle of the room, flips over, and looks up triumphantly.</p><p>\u201CDid you see it!? Rob Van Dam&#39;s anterior cruciate ligament-snapping moonsault!\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C............\u201D</p><p>Her arms crossed, Mitsuzuri looks on coldly? Just when did she...?</p><hr><p>\u201C...Uh... Mitsuzuri!\u201D</p><p>\u201C...Ha. To think you&#39;d go nuts over something so trivial...\u201D</p><p>\u201CI-I&#39;ve been looked down upon!</p><p>And by none other than HER!\u201D</p><p>\u201C............\u201D</p><p>I want to speak out.</p><p>I want to reveal the fact that, only moments ago, this haughty person standing over her was doing the very same...!</p><hr><p>\u201CAh, I suppose it can&#39;t be helped. I hear a repressed childhood does things to a person.\u201D</p><p>\u201CAaaargh! So RUDE! I&#39;ve always been like this!\u201D</p><p>\u201CMakinoji. We can&#39;t support you, so why don&#39;t you just stop now?\u201D</p><p>\u201COkay.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CAll right, enough with the tomfoolery!</p><p>Is this everyone? Then I&#39;ll call for my brother. There is something I need to tell you about first.\u201D</p><p>\u201CNo, Tohsaka isn&#39;t here yet.\u201D</p><p>\u201CTohsaka&#39;s no problem. Wait just a moment.\u201D</p><hr><p>Issei disappears from the hall. I&#39;m the only guy left.</p><p>...Issei, it seems you&#39;re losing your calm.</p><p>I suppose that&#39;s understandable, seeing as this place is crawling with females... What worries me more is that this M-F ratio does not even bother me anymore.</p><hr><p>\u201CSenpai, um...\u201D</p><p>\u201CSakura, did you hear anything from Tohsaka? She suggested the idea, and now she&#39;s late.\u201D</p><p>\u201CI think... she stayed up all night yesterday.\u201D</p><p>\u201CAll night...? Like trawling through the library, looking for material and things? I thought she went back to her ghost mansion early?\u201D</p><p>\u201CWell, yes.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CYeah. I&#39;m kind of tired too, actually.\u201D</p><p>Mitsuzuri seems to force out a yawn.</p><p>\u201C...You guys all didn&#39;t sleep?\u201D</p><p>\u201CYeah, it came to our house too. That anaconda of a fax.\u201D</p><p>Fa...x!? When did she buy something like that!?</p><p>Truly, a gigantic waste. Like pearls before swine. Or, a sailor uniform on Fuji-Nee.</p><hr><p>\u201CUm... I received it as well, late at night.</p><p>Tohsaka-san&#39;s script. She asked me to skim over it.\u201D</p><p>\u201CScript...? I thought she said she was just going to find a suitable play? When did she manage to write her own?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CIt didn&#39;t come to your house, Emiya-kun?\u201D</p><p>\u201CMy house? No, we don&#39;t have a fax machine.\u201D</p><p>\u201CAh, then you must have slept soundly.\u201D</p><p>Although Saegusa says it with a smile, her eyes are bloodshot.</p><p>No, they&#39;re not quite up to Caster&#39;s level of cynicism. But while I can guarantee the total lack of evil design behind those eyes, they&#39;re scary enough in their own right.</p><hr><p>\u201CI wish she had sent it starting from page one... then we could&#39;ve at least read it in order.\u201D</p><p>\u201CWhat, it came last page first?</p><p>...No wonder I thought it was difficult to follow...\u201D</p><p>\u201CWell, not sure if it would have made a difference.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CIt came to our house too... Well, in my case, it was an endless stream of blank pages.\u201D</p><p>\u201CTo fax them the wrong page up... that&#39;s Tohsaka alright.\u201D</p><p>\u201C&quot;A white anaconda stalking the streets of Fuyuki at night!&quot;\u201D</p><p>\u201CShe sent it again, but by the time it arrived, the sun was almost up.\u201D</p><p>I can see Tohsaka in front of a brand-new fax machine, first timidly pushing the buttons, then yelling at the poor thing as her temper builds up.</p><hr><p>\u201CI did say that e-mail would be fine...\u201D</p><p>\u201CIt would have taken at least three times as long that way.\u201D</p><p>\u201CDo not underestimate her. It&#39;d be at least five times.\u201D</p><p>\u201C...I think it&#39;d be impossible to begin with.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CKane-chan, you were last then.</p><p>Did you even sleep?\u201D</p><p>\u201CIt was a complete all-nighter. I could faint right now.\u201D</p><p>\u201CBut your expression&#39;s the same as ever.\u201D</p><p>Mitsuzuri pouts while on the phone.</p><hr><p>\u201C...She&#39;s not answering her phone. Could she be asleep?\u201D</p><p>\u201CWHAAAAT!!!!!?\u201D</p><p>\u201CShould we go get her, just in case?\u201D</p><p>\u201CUUUAAAHT, YOU, UUUAAAAAH!!!!\u201D</p><p>Awesome. Mitsuzuri just did a back dash, her feet never leaving the ground.</p><hr><p>\u201CAh, I&#39;m sorry, Mitsuzuri-senpai.</p><p>I could never get the chance to introduce you\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><p>\u201COh, you&#39;re here, Rider?\u201D</p><p>\u201CW-When... When did you get here, Rider-san!?\u201D</p><p>Her eyebrow twitching, she&#39;s readying herself like Ultraman before some extraterrestrial monster.</p><hr><p>\u201CI have always been here with Sakura, but you must not have noticed.\u201D</p><p>\u201CL-Lies! You&#39;re lying! Where were you hiding!?\u201D</p><p>\u201CThat was one irresistibly attractive backflip.\u201D</p><p>\u201CYou were watching!?\u201D</p><p>...She must have been in her spirit form.</p><hr><p>\u201CRider-san? Who would that be?\u201D</p><p>\u201CAh, sorry, Makidera-senpai. I&#39;ll introduce you to her at a later time. Rider, could you take care of Tohsaka-senpai for now?\u201D</p><p>\u201CUnderstood.\u201D</p><p>Rider suddenly turns toward me, as if to seek my approval.</p><p>\u201CYes, please, Rider. We can&#39;t continue without Tohsaka.\u201D</p><p>\u201CThat is but a matter of course\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><p>\u201CWhat is it?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CShould I not call Saber, as well?\u201D</p><p>\u201CUh...\u201D</p><p>\u201CI thought she might come with you too, Senpai...\u201D</p><p>\u201CWell, that&#39;s what I hoped, but she refused.\u201D</p><p>\u201CEh, then she&#39;s at the mansion all by herself tonight?\u201D</p><p>\u201CThat she is.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CWhat, bring her over. That pretty girl? You can&#39;t let her be alone.\u201D</p><p>\u201CYou just say whatever&#39;s on your mind, Mitsuzuri. You&#39;ve always been like that.\u201D</p><p>\u201CBut, you know, wouldn&#39;t she be on the archery club&#39;s side?\u201D</p><p>\u201C...So that&#39;s what you need her for.\u201D</p><p>\u201COoough! What, what!? A helper!? Come one, come all!\u201D</p><p>\u201CIt must feel great to have not a care in the world, Makidera.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CI&#39;m here too, Ayako.\u201D</p><p>Mitsuzuri&#39;s hair stands on end as she jumps back in retreat.</p><hr><p>\u201CT-Thank you!</p><p>B-But you mustn&#39;t sneak up on people from behind! This is a sacred hall!\u201D</p><p>It sure sounds like the kind of thing Issei would say if he were here, weeping.</p><hr><p>\u201CWell, the archery club aside.</p><p>Rider, could you say something to Saber again, please? Sorry for the trouble.\u201D</p><p>\u201CYes. I shall see what I can do.</p><p>I will be back soon.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CPhew. Good thing Rider is here.\u201D</p><p>\u201CMaybe so, but...\u201D</p><p>Sakura mutters as she watches the relieved Mitsuzuri collapse on the tatami.</p><hr><p>\u201CThanks for waiting. I see you are all here.\u201D</p><p>Issei returns in Rider&#39;s stead.</p><p>...With a man wearing a black robe in tow.</p><p>Broad shoulders and stout back, this person is none other than Issei&#39;s older brother and also the temple&#39;s current head monk.</p><hr><p>\u201CGood morning.\u201D</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;Good morning!&quot;</p><p>The group gathers naturally and composes itself to greet him, a side effect of belonging to an athletic club.</p><p>Everyone wakes up afresh.</p><hr><p>\u201CWow, what a greeting. That is excellent.</p><p>I am the person in charge while the temple master is away. My name is Reikan. &quot;<ruby>Zero<rt>rei</rt></ruby>&quot; and &quot;<ruby>Stargazing.<rt>kan</rt></ruby>&quot;</p><p>Being a graduate of Homurabara, I suppose I am also an &quot;old boy&quot; to you.\u201D</p><p>Reikan-san looks over at me and Mitsuzuri. We both nod slightly.</p><hr><p>\u201CI heard that there will be archery and track and field club members. Is this everyone?\u201D</p><p>If this were school, Issei would probably speak up on everyone&#39;s behalf, but that doesn&#39;t seem to be happening here.</p><p>And so I answer in his place.</p><hr><p>\u201CI&#39;m sorry, but there&#39;s still one missing.</p><p>And it looks like there will also be a few participants that aren&#39;t students.\u201D</p><p>\u201COho? So there&#39;ll be more, I see.</p><p>Please do tell me more about it later. I won&#39;t discriminate against delinquents.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CVery well, I will first tell you about this temple.</p><p>Please relay the relevant information to those who arrive later.\u201D</p><p>The stand-in head monk tells us about the Ryuudou temple and the relationship Homurabara has with it.</p><p>His crisp voice rings throughout the large hall.</p><hr><p>\u201CUsually there are quite a few young trainees living at the temple, but as of recently, together with the head monk, they have left to visit a certain sacred mountain.</p><p>If they come back alive, that would be great. If not, this temple&#39;s unusually vast grounds will be available for the Homurabara students to lay claim on. Mm, this is definitely a win-win situation.\u201D</p><p>I can&#39;t tell where his jokes end, but you sure can&#39;t be bored listening to him.</p><hr><p>\u201CPlease utilize this hall and the sleeping quarters as you see fit. Needless to say, the quarters are divided by gender.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015But I heard that you would be practicing for a play?</p><p>Splendid. It would be great if a famous actor or actress comes out of this training session at Ryuudou temple. Our charms and talismans will be selling like hotcakes!\u201D</p><p>Everyone shakes their heads ardently.</p><p>...Mitsuzuri alone, her finger on her chin, is listening with a serious expression.</p><hr><p>\u201CAnd when that happens, we will, of course, be collecting royalties.\u201D</p><p>\u201CEh? Ah, I see. Then, me too\u2015\u2015\u2015!\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C...It&#39;s just a joke. He doesn&#39;t have any charms or talismans.\u201D</p><p>\u201CNo, no, Issei. I do believe Caster-san would be able to make a hundred or two of them in no time.</p><p>Mmm, we&#39;ll leave that for later.</p><p>For this occasion, I shall overlook anyone staying up late.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CIn return, I&#39;d like to request that you take a bit of time cleaning the hall and the road leading to the back of the temple, today and tomorrow. Consider it volunteering.</p><p>Emiya-kun and Mitsuzuri-san will know exactly what to do, so please follow their examples.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CAs I have mentioned, you can use these rooms as you see fit.</p><p>You are also free to wander around elsewhere, if you so desire.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CHowever, the building to the west, where Issei&#39;s, myself and others&#39; rooms are located, is the head monk&#39;s residence.</p><p>Particularly the innermost room. It is the love nest of the Kuzuki couple, so unless you have an urgent matter to attend to, I highly recommend you keep out.</p><p>Else, I cannot guarantee your safety.\u201D</p><p>And so, with those final words of encouragement, Reikan-san leaves and our entire group bids farewell the same as it greeted him.</p><hr><p>\u201C...Hm. It&#39;s over without an incident.\u201D</p><p>\u201C? Why are you so tense, Issei? Reikan-san is just being his normal self.\u201D</p><p>\u201COf course. As you just saw, he is a man with a strong presence.</p><p>If I am ever to become a calm and collected person, I would be like Souichirou. If I am to be laid back and broad-minded, then Reikan is my model. On this, I swear.\u201D</p><p>To Issei, Reikan-san is a teacher before a brother.</p><hr><p>\u201CThat&#39;s that, but has Tohsaka not arrived still?\u201D</p><p>\u201CLet&#39;s try it one more time.\u201D</p><p>Mitsuzuri takes out her cellphone again.</p><p>\u201CHey! No calls in the temple halls!\u201D</p><p>\u201CHey, no unfunny jokes either.\u201D</p><p>\u201CYou fool! Why would it be a joke!?</p><p>Not that you would be able to tell one in the first place!\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CI guess this will do.\u201D</p><p>The back of Ryuudou temple didn&#39;t have much trash to clean up.</p><p>Most of the work was moving around rocks or sweeping and moving the leaves to the compost pile.</p><p>Having done my part, I call out to Sakura and Mitsuzuri and walk down the mountain path.</p><hr><p>Just before we reach the gate, I hear the track and field club members... well, mostly Makidera... from behind the brick wall.</p><p>They were given the task of cleaning up around the temple, but it seems like they&#39;re arguing about something.</p><p>And the one they&#39;re arguing with is\u2015\u2015\u2015Tohsaka?</p><hr><p>\u201CI&#39;m apologizing.\u201D</p><p>\u201CNope! Unforgivable! I must take this rare chance!</p><p>And it&#39;s not school, so you don&#39;t have to act all lady-like! Apologize in your normal way, the way you are when you go shopping with us and things!\u201D</p><p>\u201C...What a bother. So energetic this early in the morning.</p><p>Will it appease you if I do all of the cleaning tomorrow?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CWhat&#39;s going on?\u201D</p><p>\u201CAh... morning.\u201D</p><p>When I speak up, Tohsaka shrinks her shoulders.</p><p>It must be her nonchalant attitude, coupled with the fact of having overslept this much, that has angered Makidera.</p><p>But right as I&#39;m about to step in, Makidera speaks the unthinkable.</p><hr><p>\u201CThe cleaning doesn&#39;t matter.\u201D</p><p>\u201CHuh?\u201D</p><p>\u201CNo, that&#39;s really not true, Maki-chan.\u201D</p><p>\u201COkay.\u201D</p><p>\u201CIf it&#39;s not about her being late, why are you mad?\u201D</p><p>Makidera, calmed down by Saegusa only moments ago, lights up in an instant.</p><p>\u201CHEY HEY HEY! YOU STILL DON&#39;T KNOW!?\u201D</p><p>\u201CStop being loud, Makinoji.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CUkuuuuuu! I can&#39;t stay quiet about this!\u201D</p><p>Makidera slaps her hand with what looks like a thick roll of fax paper. That must be the legendary script.</p><p>\u201CThis, THIS! What do you mean I&#39;m supposed to play the &quot;MONKEY&quot;!? What the hell is that, huh!?\u201D</p><p>Monkey...? Oh, so it&#39;s the play she&#39;s riled up about?</p><hr><p>\u201CAh, that?\u201D</p><p>\u201CBut, Makidera-san, don&#39;t you think you&#39;ll be able to do an excellent job as a monkey?\u201D</p><p>\u201CUrooorgh... What could you possibly mean!?\u201D</p><p>\u201CMmm. Okay. Yes, very good.\u201D</p><p>\u201CW-What!? Cleared with one try!?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CYep. I approve. As the best actor for the role, Makidera-san has my full support.\u201D</p><p>\u201COooh... thanks.</p><p>...No, THAT&#39;S NOT IT AT ALL! What are you trying to get at with this, Tohsaka!?\u201D</p><p>\u201CThe director&#39;s spot.\u201D</p><p>Smiling, she meaningfully takes out her glasses. The absolute ruling elite.</p><hr><p>\u201CFor real!? You won&#39;t win like this!</p><p>Even the classics like Godzilla or Devilman can go to hell if the director takes a wrong turn!\u201D</p><p>\u201CNo. Makidera-senpai?</p><p>It&#39;s not final yet. Although we did ask her to come up with a script.\u201D</p><p>\u201CRight. There could be another candidate for the director&#39;s spot.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201COh? I do believe it&#39;s already my position.\u201D</p><p>Tohsaka doesn&#39;t even flinch. I do wonder where her confidence comes from.</p><p>\u201CUm, I&#39;m the &quot;Dog,&quot; how about you, Kane-chan?\u201D</p><p>\u201C&quot;Pheasant.&quot;</p><p>I have no complaints about my role.</p><p>But it does make me somewhat uneasy not knowing how the plot is going to unfold.\u201D</p><hr><p>Let&#39;s see... dog, monkey and pheasant... only one story comes to mind. So what she has sent everyone was the script for &quot;Momotaro&quot;? Hmm... Not nearly unique enough for Tohsaka&#39;s tastes...</p><hr><p>\u201CWell, anyway, we can&#39;t linger here all day. If we&#39;re done with the cleaning, we should gather the tools and go to the main hall. We can continue there.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CAh, there&#39;s more help coming soon.</p><p>They&#39;re with Ryuudou-kun at the moment.\u201D</p><p>\u201CEh? Tohsaka, you brought Saber?\u201D</p><p>I blurt out in a happy voice unintentionally.</p><p>\u201CMm, well there&#39;s also that...\u201D</p><p>\u201CW-What do you mean?\u201D</p><p>Rin lets out a malicious chuckle. A demonic laugh, with a demonic intent, coming from the devil herself.</p><hr><p>\u201CIt actually turned out quite funny.\u201D</p><p>Her already evil aura multiplies in its intensity.</p><p>...Whatever could she mean by more &quot;helpers,&quot; as in more than one? And funny?</p><hr><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015How?\u201D</p><p>Through some magic on Tohsaka&#39;s part, the building is full of all-too-familiar faces.</p><hr><p>Sakura and I stand speechless.</p><p>Lancer is exchanging familiar greetings with Mitsuzuri and the track and field team members.</p><p>&quot;Ah, the Red Nii-chan!&quot; The ever-sneering Archer is greeted by Makidera and others. What a spectacle.</p><hr><p>\u201COh? You all somehow know each other?</p><p>That&#39;s unexpected. Well, it does cut down on the introductions then.\u201D</p><p>The scripts are passed out, and we have an excuse for an introduction and casting meeting.</p><hr><p>\u201C...I&#39;m not doubting everyone&#39;s skills or anything, but wasn&#39;t it a little meaningless to invite Saber-san and others?\u201D</p><p>\u201CDoes it matter? If it&#39;s just us, we&#39;d have two roles per person. And besides, the main characters are still Homurabara students.</p><p>If they can help us as extras, our play can only get better.\u201D</p><hr><p>Mitsuzuri, who likes festivities, agrees with Tohsaka and the conversation moves on.</p><p>\u201CHah!? I-Is that so? So the main character, I can be it, right?\u201D</p><hr><p>And the one who REALLY likes festivities, Makidera, raises her voice enthusiastically about changing roles.</p><p>This was the process of the monkey evolving into the main character, the start of what future generations would call, &quot;The Makidera Rebellion.&quot;</p><hr><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015Well.</p><p>With the roles all taken from Tohsaka&#39;s just-finished script, the cultural festival practice really begins in earnest.</p><p>An orthodox fairy-tale, reenacted by the union of the track and field and archery clubs.</p><p>An ancient story that everyone has heard at least once\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>\u201CAhem.</p><p>Let us see... Ten years passed since Momotaro and his three comrades ended their quest to defeat the monsters\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CHe had been living peacefully with his grandma and grandpa until one day, voices of the monsters long thought dead, full of resentment, reached him once more.</p><p>Having heard the rumors of the monsters being resurrected on the Demon Island in the middle of the sea, Momotaro rises up to the challenge, wasting not a second on hesitation.</p><p>Of course, we cannot forget the grandma&#39;s homemade millet dumplings that he carries on his belt!\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CWhenever he takes a bite, a nostalgic taste fills his mouth, and the image of his brave comrades warms his chest.</p><p>What could they be doing now, after having parted ways? They are\uFF5E at this very\uFF5E moment\uFF5E\u266A</p><p>But first, before embarking on the journey, Momotaro seeks three or four companions to follow him on his quest. Thus begins the adventure of the Five Taros...\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CHear ye, hear ye! Those that are far, and those that are near!</p><p>If you are near, come and see it with your own eyes!</p><p>I am Momotaro of Kibi, from the Land of the Rising Sun!\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CYe monsters of the Demon Island!</p><p>Have ye not learned yer lesson, having come back from Hell with insolence!\u201D</p><p>No matter what wicked arts or witchcraft you may use\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><p>I, Momotaro, will destroy it all and bring an end to the Demon Island once and for all!</p><p>Hiya, hiya, hooo\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015!!\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C............</p><p>...Well, high morale is good and all.</p><p>But I can&#39;t do it alone, so...</p><p>So lonely\u2015\u2015\u2015!</p><p>Ah, how I miss you, Dog, Monkey, Pheasant!</p><p>I wonder what are you guys doing now?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CAh, if it isn&#39;t the famous Momotaro-dono gracing us with his presence!</p><p>I am delighted and honored to be able to finally meet you!\u201D</p><p>\u201C...I am the Bear of Mount Ashigara!</p><p>I have a message from my master, kuma!\u201D</p><p>\u201CKuma everywhere!\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C&quot;Dear respected Momotaro-dono\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><p>I presume that you have already heard and felt the return of the Demon Island.</p><p>The unrest in the capital grows stronger. Night by night, strange events are taking place. Without doubt, the forces of darkness are taking hold.</p><p>The Yin energy emanating from the Island must be countered.</p><p>Five Taros must therefore assemble and head out to defeat the evil. I shall humbly wait for you at the capital.</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015Kintaro of Mount Ashigara.&quot;\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C...That is all, kuma.\u201D</p><p>\u201CGather... five Taros!\u201D</p><p>\u201CI see, Bear. You are the messenger of Kintaro!\u201D</p><p>\u201CPrecisely, kuma.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CThen I shall await at the capital.</p><p>I pray you hurry, kuma.\u201D</p><p>\u201CYeah, I&#39;ll be there soon.</p><p>Please give my regards to Kintaro.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CI am definitely not a human. I am the child of a dragon.\u201D</p><p>\u201CA dragon? So those horns are dragon horns\u2015\u2015\u2015!?\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Haaaah!\u201D</p><p>\u201CStrong\u2015\u2015\u2015!\u201D</p><p>\u201CThe White Dragon of the Mountain is my father, the Rhino Dragon of the Lake is my mother\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><p>I am &quot;Kotaro of the Dragons.&quot;\u201D</p><p>\u201COooh... Kotaro of the Dragons?</p><p>Are you a Taro too?</p><p>Then... you are not with the monsters?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CThe monsters who harm the village people are my enemies.\u201D</p><p>\u201CUeeeeh, I&#39;m sorry!</p><p>I apologize on my knees! Just like this! I&#39;m sorry, I&#39;m sorry!\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CAnd so, Momotaro was unexpectedly able to recruit Kotaro of the Dragons as a companion on his journey.</p><p>They went on and on, but they still could find no trace of the Dog, Monkey or the Pheasant.</p><p>Momotaro, frustrated and impatient, insisted that he will rush the Demon Island by himself, or face a honorable death trying. But the composed Kotaro of the Dragons was able to calm him in the end.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CHalt! That is no enemy of yours!\u201D</p><p>\u201CI am Momotaro of Kibi!</p><p>A warrior that conquered the Demon Island and even had the honor of an audience with the Emperor himself!\u201D</p><p>\u201CAlthough nothing ever came out of any of that...\u201D</p><p>\u201CHold your tongue...!\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C...I-Is it not the Dog!? Dog! Dog!\u201D</p><p>\u201CSo this gatekeeper was the Dog.\u201D</p><p>\u201CRight, it&#39;s the Dog! Dog! Do-ooog!\u201D</p><p>\u201C&quot;Dog,&quot; &quot;dog,&quot; shut up already!\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CTada, tada\uFF5E\u266A</p><p>Taro\uFF5E is a good boy\uFF5E lalala\uFF5E\u266A</p><p>...Can we not do something about this musical part...? <em>grumble</em> <em>grumble</em>...\u201D</p><p>\u201CMy name is &quot;Three-year Sleeping Taro of Shinano&quot;!</p><p>My hibernation is long over. Currently, I live with a beautiful wife, and I&#39;d like you to think of me as one of the Imperial Court servants.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CHey, Momotaro, the Dog is not your servant anymore.</p><p>And to think that you would show your brazen face in the capital.</p><p>The Emperor is angry.\u201D</p><p>\u201CThe revival of the monsters is not Momotaro-dono&#39;s fault!\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CBut we must resolve all doubt.</p><p>For the monsters to revive after they were destroyed... The rumors that their defeat was a scam set up to receive the Emperor&#39;s reward were circulating since the very beginning.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CRight now is not the time to fight each other.</p><p>You may be born to different parents, but aren&#39;t you all of the same Taro blood!?</p><p>All together now...\u201D</p><p>\u201CKintaro with the big aaaaxe\uFF5E\u266A</p><p>Ridiiiing on a bear, like on a horse\uFF5E\u266A\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CDaah dee da\u266A\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u201CDoo dee da\u266A\u201D\u201D</p><p>\u201CHiyaaa!\u201D</p><p>\u201CMomotaro-dono! Are you out of your mind, kuma!?</p><p>To swing your sword about like that!\u201D</p><p>\u201C...What were you trying to slash, Kintaro?\u201D</p><p>\u201CE-Eeek!\u201D</p><p>\u201CI shall hold him down, so please go on with the explanation.\u201D</p><p>\u201CY-Yes...\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CIt is as the astrologer Abeno Seimei foretold in his divination.</p><p>A star of ill omen is rising in the northeast.\u201D</p><p>\u201CNortheast\u2015\u2015\u2015that&#39;s where the Demon Island lies.\u201D</p><p>\u201CThat is correct, Momotaro-san.</p><p>If I may summarize, Seimei is saying that this unprecedented uprising of evil from the Demon Island is bound to descend upon our country before long.</p><p>As you may know, the evil force is already starting to take hold in the remote regions that are lacking astrologer and Buddhist priest attention.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CI have witnessed with my very own eyes the trembling of the charm that seals the head of the great daemon Shutendoji. The Tsuchigumo grave in Mount Katsuragi was also no different.</p><p>These are dreadful times.</p><p>Should they come back to life, even the capital will not escape unharmed.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CA great calamity has befallen the Land of the Rising Sun!\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CAnd so, the four Taros - Momotaro, Kotaro of the Dragons, Kintaro, and the Three-year Sleeping Taro - together with their servants, united for the moment and began on their search for the last Taro, the &quot;Urashima Taro.&quot; Ah\uFF5E, so hungry.\u201D</p><hr><p>Since my turn isn&#39;t coming up anytime soon, I sneak out of the practice hall and hurry toward the kitchen.</p><hr><p>I have a dinner for fifteen waiting to be prepared there...</p><p>\u201CThanks again!</p><p>...Eh? You&#39;re by yourself, Emiyan?\u201D</p><p>\u201CNeko-san?\u201D</p><hr><p>What a surprise.</p><p>I was sure it was Reikan-san coming to check up on us...</p><p>I never expected to see THIS person at the temple\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><p>\u201CAre you here on a provisioning run, by chance?\u201D</p><p>\u201CYeah. I do get paid, though.</p><p>Hoy, this goes into the refrigerator, and this to the freezer. This place has a ridiculously large fridge so you can keep on stuffing things inside.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CAh, yes. Thanks, yes, yep, alright.\u201D</p><p>I suppose it is only natural for a hardcore part-time worker that my body starts moving by itself at Neko-san&#39;s orders.</p><hr><p>\u201CMmm, good, good. Right there. Okay.</p><p>Two boxes left. Here, Emiya-san, this is the car key.</p><p>Sorry, I have no time either. The night shift at Copenhagen starts soon.\u201D</p><p>\u201CAh. Now that you mention it, it&#39;s about that time, isn&#39;t it?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CYeah.</p><p>The customers will just leave if we only have one person there. Well, it does make things easier for me, but whatever.</p><p>And I also have to talk to Rei-kun\u2015\u2015\u2015I mean, the stand-in head monk.\u201D</p><p>Stand-in head monk... that must be Reikan-san.</p><p>Seems like Neko-san knows him already.</p><hr><p>\u201CThe key is to the mini-van, right?\u201D</p><p>\u201CRight. It&#39;s parked at the bottom.</p><p>You can bring the heavy stuff like vegetables and rice yourself.</p><p>Two cardboard boxes, should be two trips max. And should I bill the archery club?\u201D</p><p>\u201CAh, I&#39;ll get it myself this time.\u201D</p><p>\u201COkay\uFF5E\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CNeko-san!\u201D</p><p>I stop her once again. Even though she&#39;s been carrying heavy boxes up that flight of stairs, her steps are still as light as ever.</p><p>\u201CThank you very much. You&#39;ve been a big help.\u201D</p><p>&quot;No problem,&quot; Neko-san gestures back without turning. She&#39;s a good person. Yeah.</p><hr><p>The autumn sun falls like a rock to the bottom of a pond, and without any streetlights nearby, Ryuudou temple sinks into darkness moments later.</p><hr><p>The kitchen starts filling up with all sorts of appetizing smells.</p><p>The creaking floorboards inform me of Saber&#39;s arrival.</p><hr><p>\u201CShirou.\u201D</p><p>\u201CAh, just hold on for ten more minutes.\u201D</p><p>\u201CI haven&#39;t said anything yet.</p><p>......Although I must admit at this smell is whetting my appetite greatly, indeed...\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CHaha, sorry.</p><p>I&#39;m the one who&#39;s hungry. Really, to get so nervous over just that...\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015You did well.</p><p>Everyone&#39;s taking turns going into the bath, but most of them should be done by now.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CI see. That&#39;s good. The timing worked out well.\u201D</p><p>\u201CThat&#39;s that...</p><p>Thanks a lot to you, Saber. You did great.\u201D</p><p>Saber shakes her head.</p><hr><p>\u201CCompared to others, I haven&#39;t done much at all.</p><p>Is there something I could possibly help you with?\u201D</p><p>\u201CAh, thanks, then...\u201D</p><p>Well, there&#39;s not much left, actually.</p><p>If anything, it&#39;s being able to chat like this that would help.</p><hr><p>\u201C...Alright, can I ask you to take care of serving, then?</p><p>There&#39;s a big bowl with salad on the middle shelf in the fridge. Take that and divide it for everyone.\u201D</p><p>\u201CGot it. Will there be one plate per person?\u201D</p><p>\u201CWe&#39;ll need around ten. There are wooden plates on those shelves somewhere.</p><p>It&#39;ll be sort of like a big family meal, so we&#39;ll get them to divide it all up themselves.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CI see. That I am familiar with.\u201D</p><p>There are no tongs, so Saber uses cooking chopsticks to quickly toss the salad. Her chopstick skills have improved vastly.</p><hr><p>I sneak a peek at her from the side.</p><p>Could it be because of this rare festival night?</p><p>My heart&#39;s throbbing out of control, just like the first time we met.</p><p>\u201CShirou.\u201D</p><p>\u201CEh...? Ah, oops.\u201D</p><p>I hurriedly turn my eyes back to what I&#39;m doing.</p><hr><p>\u201CI was wondering if I should say this, but...\u201D</p><p>\u201CAh, what is it?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CI have never gone to school like you, Shirou. Yet today, I was still able to meet a few of your classmates.\u201D</p><p>\u201CAren&#39;t they interesting people?\u201D</p><p>\u201CYes.

Ah, no, it was Kaede, wasn&#39;t it?\u201D</p><p>\u201CHaha, yeah...\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CThey are all very lively people.\u201D</p><p>Muttering to herself, she repeats every name once again, as if to inscribe them in her mind.</p><p>\u201CThank you, Shirou.\u201D</p><p>And it is my name she mutters last.</p><hr><p>\u201CWell, I didn&#39;t do anything.\u201D</p><p>\u201CNo, it was all thanks to you.</p><p>There were not many times where we could just sit around and laugh like this.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CIf you put it like that, then I ought to say thanks to you, too.</p><p>For helping out with the cultural festival practice, of course, but I&#39;m also glad that you simply cheered up and came with us.\u201D</p><p>\u201CI was inexcusably cold this morning. I am ashamed of myself.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CBut...\u201D</p><p>A bitter smile on her lips, Saber shrugs her small shoulders.</p><p>\u201CI still have not gotten used to acting.</p><p>I admit, I still wish someone would switch places with me right this instant.\u201D</p><p>\u201CHaha...\u201D</p><hr><p>The hallway is getting noisy. Is it Makidera again?</p><p>Tired of waiting, they&#39;ll probably invade soon.</p><p>Great, I&#39;ll get them to help set the table.</p><hr><p>\u201CMmm, Emiyan is still so young.\u201D</p><p>\u201CI definitely cannot approve of peeping, Neko-kun.\u201D</p><p>\u201CI&#39;m offended. I&#39;d like to think of it as &quot;watching over.&quot;</p><p>How can I leave such a promising young boy to a negligent teacher who just lets him do as he pleases?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CIt must be hard to be expected so much of.</p><p>In my eyes, Emiya-kun himself is the one who&#39;s more level-headed. In fact, it seems he may be spending too much time keeping unruly adults in control.\u201D</p><p>\u201CFujimura is like a spoiled kid around Emiyan, yeah.</p><p>...Hold on. Does that mean me, too?\u201D</p><p>\u201CHmm, Shirou&#39;s curry. This is where the smell is coming from.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CLong time no see, Junior.

Rei-chan and Otoko?\u201D</p><p>\u201CYeah. I was going one step ahead, to see how&#39;s Shirou-kun doing.

I&#39;ve been busy all day taking care of paperwork. I came in a hurry just in time for dinner!\u201D</p><p>\u201CIn a hurry, eh?</p><p>I heard you are in charge of the students preparing for exams now.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CRight.\u201D</p><p>\u201CWhaa, unbelievable. How reckless does the school have to be to let someone like you have anything to do with exams!</p><p>Well, I guess it&#39;s our home school we&#39;re talking about here. The only thing the advisor has on her mind is what&#39;s for dinner.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CHow incredibly rude! And you, Otoko, stop fooling around and go back to your tiny shop already. Isn&#39;t it time for your shift?\u201D</p><p>\u201CYes, yes. It is time, and talking to you takes all my energy away, so I&#39;ll be going soon even if you don&#39;t tell me to.</p><p>And don&#39;t call me Otoko in front of other people!\u201D</p><p>\u201CI&#39;ll see you off to the bottom of the stairs.

Is it reverse sexual harassment!?\u201D</p><p>\u201CN-No, it&#39;s not &quot;swaying,&quot; it&#39;s &quot;hopping,&quot; byoing.\u201D</p><hr><p>For a moment, I was worried what would happen when we round up all the Servants and ask them to take part in a play... but in the end, the rehearsal went smoothly.</p><p>Fortunately, although my part consisted largely of staying behind the scenes, I was still able to help out.</p><hr><p>\u201C...Momotaro.</p><p>You, once again, were not meant to leave the Demon Island.\u201D</p><p>\u201CMomotaro, born from a peach.</p><p>You cannot return to the human world anymore.</p><p>No one will know, or want to know, what has become of Momotaro.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CI-I&#39;m a human! Being born from a peach is a sign of individuality! Admit it! Stop the discrimination!\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CIf everyone could discover themselves so easily, then they would not suffer.

Kicking the iron of reason to the curb, a manifestation of pure sadism.</p><hr><p>\u201C<ruby>Trace<rt>Projection</rt></ruby>\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><p>There is no hesitation.</p><p>Frankly, faced with the prospect of being washed away in a sea of garbage, I have lost my sanity long ago.</p><p>\u201COn\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><p>The projected weapon is rolling through the trash before me\u2015\u2015\u2015!</p><hr><p>A cloud of dust rises up.</p><p>The swarm of claws is rushing towards us.</p><p>Beastly daggers crawling out of every crack, in every direction.</p><hr><p>Sparks dancing in the muddy moonlight.</p><p>Narrowly avoiding the claws coming to gouge both of my eyes out, I end up nearly kissing one corpse in the face as I dispatch him with a dagger.</p><p>Crumbling remains of the cut-down beasts.</p><p>And for each one of their brethren that goes down, there&#39;s another swarm coming to skewer me.</p><hr><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Ha...!\u201D</p><p>I retaliate ferociously.</p><p>Three strikes in one second.
