Do it to merely provide assistance to whoever needs it with reason!\u201D</p><p>Kagetora unified the Province of Echigo, a province of which a civil war had continued to go on for a while, and dispatched troops on countless occasions after receiving calls for help from another province, unfolding many battles with clans such as the Takeda and the Houjou as a result. On the battlefield, she always departed with her force\u2019s vanguard, and she commanded her army according to her overwhelming charisma and tactical genius, experiencing more than 70 battles in her lifetime, yet not even suffering one defeat in her list of major battles.</p><p>She changed her name several times throughout her life, taking the name of Nagao Kagetora, Uesugi Masatora, and then finally, Uesugi Kenshin, a Dharma name she took on much later in her lifetime, and it is the name of Kenshin that became her most famous name.</p><p>\u201CHuh?

And so, it has been decided that Kagetora could not help herself in being forced into a way of life of something like the gods and buddhas rather than a human being.</p><p>From the standpoint of that kind of Kagetora, it is solely when she is fighting for her life on the battlefield, as well as the moments of life and death she has when she is facing with her enemies, that she surely feels something as a human.</p><p>After her death, that way of life which was detached from normalcy got others to identify Kagetora to the point of calling her a God of War.

It appears Kagetora one-sidedly believes such a thing, but from the way it seems to this Shingen, Kagetora was an immense annoyance to her. After all, the reason is that, since she is not doing battle to make gains and advantages, Shingen could not predict the battle\u2019s progress. Help her, Kansuke.</p><p>Nonetheless, Shingen has a high opinion of Kagetora as well, to the extent that she left these words to her son: \u201CAfter my death, rely on Terutora (one of Kagetora\u2019s names in her later years), because she will not betray you.\u201D</p><p><strong>Houjou Ujiyasu</strong></p><p>\u201CDamn you, Odawara Castle; by no means can I, Kagetora, lose to that\u2026 Huh?

In order to show the character\u2019s individuality, I decided on a plan of making all her facial expressions to be smiling faces, but that might have been a bit overkill. Shimaudon-kun was responsible for her weapons\u2019 designs, while Shimokoshi-kun was responsible for her horse\u2019s design. She became a very magnificent character who has depth.

It\u2019s an expression for great surprise, but in Kagetora\u2019s case, the last part of the rhyme, pepper tree, was replaced with Bishamonten instead just because it\u2019s Kagetora.
