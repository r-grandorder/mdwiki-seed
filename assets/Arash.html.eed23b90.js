Be careful, okay?</p><p><strong>Arash:</strong><br> You need to prepare to go into the forest.<br> You can&#39;t just walk in there.</p><p><strong>Arash:</strong><br> But, well, I guess this isn&#39;t a real forest, right?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Yeah, this is a battle simulation.<br> I want combat data for forested areas, you see.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> So I thought bringing a veteran Heroic Spirit would be good experience for Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Arash:</strong><br> What an honor. My job is keeping Fujimaru from being too reckless, right?</p><p><strong>Arash:</strong><br> It&#39;ll be hard to take it slow, but I am sure you&#39;ll get something out of this.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Thanks!</p><p><strong>Arash:</strong><br> Yeah, leave it to me.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> It&#39;s just you and me this time.</p><p><strong>Arash:</strong><br> That&#39;s right.<br> Let&#39;s do this.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...I&#39;ll be watching the Command Room this time.<br> Sorry, Senpai.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> B-But I&#39;ll help in any way I can!<br> I&#39;ll watch for any enemies that might show up!</p><p><strong>Arash:</strong><br> Hmm? Can&#39;t you guys make enemies appear and disappear?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Nah, it would be boring doing that every time.<br> This time I had them appear randomly.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> So if you tell them where the enemies are, all that programming work I did will be wasted...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> No, Doctor. Just think of this as practice for providing support from the Command Room.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> But is there any point in you doing that?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> We&#39;re training to be ready for everything. Isn&#39;t that right, Doctor?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I&#39;m counting on you.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Thank you, I&#39;ll do my best!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Next time, you will come too.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes! I&#39;d love to!</p><p><strong>Arash:</strong><br> Sorry, missy, I&#39;ll be borrowing your Master for a little.</p><p><strong>Arash:</strong><br> I&#39;ll get your Master back safe... Wait a second.<br> You don&#39;t get hurt in a combat simulator, right?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That&#39;s right, but serious injury will result in minor psychological trauma...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That goes for Servants too.<br> Arash, please be careful.</p><p><strong>Arash:</strong><br> I&#39;ll be fine. I&#39;ll protect your Master for you.</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> This is practice for fighting without Mash, too.<br> Though Mash will always be with you during Rayshifts...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...it&#39;s quite possible that you two will get separated upon arrival.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It&#39;s hard to imagine me leaving Senpai&#39;s side, but\u2014</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> But you&#39;re right. We can&#39;t be sure it won&#39;t happen.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> That&#39;s true.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes. If we ever Rayshift into space, it will take us some time to rendezvous.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I&#39;ll never leave you, Mash.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Thank you, Senpai.<br> I&#39;ll try my best to stay with you always...</p><hr><p><strong>Arash:</strong><br> Hmm... What was it? It&#39;s...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Arash, is something wrong?</p><p><strong>Arash:</strong><br> I think there&#39;s a phrase to describe you two.<br> It&#39;s on the tip of my tongue.</p><p><strong>Arash:</strong><br> Deeply connected? Best friends?<br> No, no, no. Um, let me see.</p><p><strong>Arash:</strong><br> Deeply in love?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> A-Arash!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Maybe...he&#39;s right?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Not you too!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Y-You&#39;re making me blush!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Y-Yes, um...well...</p><hr><p><strong>Arash:</strong><br> It&#39;s important, right?<br> A Master and Servant are\u2014</p><p><strong>Arash:</strong><br> No, I guess not. It doesn&#39;t matter whether you&#39;re human or not.</p><p><strong>Arash:</strong><br> You&#39;re comrades, risking your lives together.<br> It&#39;s best for you to get along.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Y-Yes. But wait, that doesn&#39;t just go for me...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...but for all the Servants who&#39;ve contracted with Senpai.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> You too, Arash. We&#39;re all comrades, risking our lives together, right?</p><p><strong>Arash:</strong><br> Huh? Yeah... you&#39;re right.</p><p><strong>Arash:</strong><br> Come to think of it, you&#39;re right.<br> Haha, I tried to act cool, and it failed, huh?</p><p><strong>Serenity:</strong><br> ...Arash is a great man.<br> Many know his name.</p><p><strong>Serenity:</strong><br> Many know his deeds as well.<br> Even today he is widely respected in Western Asia.</p><p><strong>Serenity:</strong><br> His name and achievements are carved in legends, and sung in songs.</p><p><strong>Serenity:</strong><br> Yes, song.<br> Did you not know this, Master?</p><p><strong>Serenity:</strong><br> The song survives to the present day.<br> Shall I sing a little?</p><p><strong>Serenity:</strong><br> \u201CHe\u2014\u201D</p><p><strong>Serenity:</strong><br> \u201CHe stood on the top of Mount Damavand, and readied the arrow of fate.\u201D</p><p><strong>Serenity:</strong><br> \u201CHis name was Arash, and the rising sun was his friend.\u201D</p><p><strong>Serenity:</strong><br> \u201C...The generals sing of his victory.\u201D</p><p><strong>Serenity:</strong><br> \u201CStrong, pure Arash, with all of his life, fired but a single arrow.\u201D</p><p><strong>Serenity:</strong><br> \u201CTwo countries were engulfed in the flames of war, and with his arrow he saved them both.\u201D</p><p><strong>Serenity:</strong><br> \u201CAll eyes were shocked as his deed, and his bravery became a legend.\u201D</p><p><strong>Serenity:</strong><br> \u201CHis arrow was faster than the fastest comet.\u201D</p><p><strong>Serenity:</strong><br> \u201CAfterwards he was never seen, and his name alone became legend.\u201D</p><p><strong>Serenity:</strong><br> \u201CThe other side of the Oxus River became the new border. By its clear waters both countries built peace.\u201D</p><p><strong>Serenity:</strong><br> \u201CHe is Arash, the strong and pure. A lonely warrior. Arash, bold like a lion.\u201D</p><p><strong>Serenity:</strong><br> I changed a bit, but it was mostly like this...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...A lonely warrior?</p><hr><p><strong>Serenity:</strong><br> Yes. Thus it is said.</p><p><strong>Serenity:</strong><br> Arash was the great hero of Western Asia.<br> He lived and fought alone, they say, in the distant past.</p><p><strong>Serenity:</strong><br> ...The truth however, is unknown.</p><p><strong>Serenity:</strong><br> A legend is a legend. It does not always represent the truth.</p><p><strong>Serenity:</strong><br> Records are the same way. They are not absolute.</p><p><strong>Serenity:</strong><br> I cannot say for sure...<br> But...</p><p><strong>Arash:</strong><br> What&#39;s wrong, Master? Space out in the forest and you&#39;ll walk right into a tree.</p><p><strong>Arash:</strong><br> Don&#39;t drop your guard even in a battle simulation, or else you&#39;ll get hurt. Even here, you&#39;ll go numb, right?</p><p><strong>Arash:</strong><br> It&#39;s not just trees you&#39;ll be running into.<br> There&#39;s beasts and monsters about too.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Monsters?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Like chimeras and stuff?</p><hr><p><strong>Arash:</strong><br> Yeah, a forest is nature&#39;s home.<br> So of course, there are monsters here.</p><p><strong>Arash:</strong><br> The mages would call it... \u201CMystics,\u201D was it?<br> They may be rare, but monsters are a part of nature.</p><p><strong>Arash:</strong><br> They were common in my day.<br> The king I served was a descendant of a dragon slayer.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> A dragon?</p><p><strong>Arash:</strong><br> That&#39;s right, and a strong one, too.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> ...A wyvern, or something?</p><p><strong>Arash:</strong><br> You mean the subspecies of western dragons?<br> No, I think it was worse than that.</p><hr><p><strong>Arash:</strong><br> Real dragons are rare, but they do exist out there.</p><p><strong>Arash:</strong><br> They say there aren&#39;t many left these days, but the Rayshifts send you to the past, right?</p><p><strong>Arash:</strong><br> So stay focused in the forest. Mash, the Doctor, and the other Servants can protect you.</p><p><strong>Arash:</strong><br> You&#39;re the core of the battle, Fujimaru. We need your power to summon Heroic Spirits and use Command Spells.</p><p><strong>Arash:</strong><br> Win or lose, it&#39;s up to\u2014</p><p><strong>Arash:</strong><br> Your orders... Whoa!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I&#39;ve detected random monsters!<br> Wait, some have already been defeated?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Arash&#39;s Arrow Construction skill!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> He was blessed by the goddess Armaiti, and is a legendary bowyer too!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> He can make and fire arrows using magical energy in real time!</p><p><strong>Arash:</strong><br> There&#39;s your explanation.<br> They&#39;re coming, Master! Let&#39;s do this!</p><p><strong>Arash:</strong><br> Give me your orders. First we take some out, and then...</p><p><strong>Arash:</strong><br> We retreat as fast as we can.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Retreat?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Couldn&#39;t we just wipe them out?</p><hr><p><strong>Arash:</strong><br> They&#39;re random monsters. There&#39;s probably no need to, but...</p><p><strong>Arash:</strong><br> If these things are \u201Cnatural,\u201D then a larger pack might be nearby.</p><p><strong>Arash:</strong><br> It&#39;s like seeing an enemy scout.<br> There might be an army nearby.</p><p><strong>Arash:</strong><br> Always go into training like it&#39;s the real deal!<br> Picture the risks you might face on the battlefield!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You may be right!</p><p><strong>Arash:</strong><br> Haha! Right?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Aren&#39;t we just tiring ourselves out for nothing?</p><p><strong>Arash:</strong><br> Hahahaha! Come on, don&#39;t be like that!</p><hr><p><strong>Arash:</strong><br> First, we fight! Then we retreat at top speed! Let&#39;s go!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Arash:</strong><br> ...The sun&#39;s set.</p><p><strong>Arash:</strong><br> The forest can be a little rough at night.<br> You&#39;d feel better with some light, right?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Hold on a second.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I ran so fast I&#39;m out of breath.</p><hr><p><strong>Arash:</strong><br> Yeah, take some rest. We ran, but that doesn&#39;t mean we&#39;ve escaped from the enemy.</p><p><strong>Arash:</strong><br> To survive in the forest, you need water, food, and a safe place to rest.</p><p><strong>Arash:</strong><br> It&#39;s different than fighting in battle.</p><p><strong>Arash:</strong><br> We&#39;ve got some water and food, yeah?<br> Not a lot, since this is a simulation.</p><p><strong>Arash:</strong><br> I can keep us safe. There are no enemies around, and even if one randomly appears...</p><p><strong>Arash:</strong><br> I&#39;ll protect us.<br> Until you&#39;re ready for combat.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Thanks.</p><p><strong>Arash:</strong><br> It&#39;s fine. I&#39;m your Servant, you know.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Can you see what&#39;s around us?</p><p><strong>Arash:</strong><br> Sure can.<br> I&#39;ve got \u201Cgood eyes.\u201D</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Sorry to keep dragging this out.<br> I&#39;m worried about Fujimaru&#39;s stamina.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> But I want some night combat data too, so I hope you don&#39;t mind keeping this up.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Don&#39;t push yourself too hard, Senpai.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I have a real dinner prepared.<br> It&#39;ll be waiting for you when you&#39;re done.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Looking forward to it.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes, Senpai. So am I.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Simulator food is flavorless.</p><p><strong>Arash:</strong><br> You&#39;re right. These are called rations, right?<br> They&#39;re not bad...</p><p><strong>Arash:</strong><br> But not good either. I miss beer.</p><hr><p><strong>Arash:</strong><br> I&#39;ve started a fire, don&#39;t get cold.<br> Lie down and rest if you want.</p><p><strong>Arash:</strong><br> Rest when you can. Eat when you can. Even outside the forest, keep that in mind in order to fight.</p><p><strong>Arash:</strong><br> I&#39;m sure you know that by now, yeah?</p><p><strong>Arash:</strong><br> You&#39;ve Rayshifted many times already.<br> You&#39;ve retrieved many Grails from many eras.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I guess I have a lot of experience.</p><p><strong>Arash:</strong><br> Yeah, it&#39;s impressive.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> It doesn&#39;t seem real to me.</p><p><strong>Arash:</strong><br> Doesn&#39;t it? ...No, maybe that&#39;s just how it is.</p><hr><p><strong>Arash:</strong><br> Fujimaru, can I ask you something?</p><p><strong>Arash:</strong><br> You&#39;ve fought a long time, right?<br> Trying to save the world.</p><p><strong>Arash:</strong><br> How are you doing? Are you feeling tired?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> It&#39;s kind of rough.</p><p><strong>Arash:</strong><br> ...I see.</p><p><strong>Arash:</strong><br> That&#39;s right. It&#39;s okay to say how you&#39;re feeling.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I can still keep going!</p><p><strong>Arash:</strong><br> ...I see.</p><p><strong>Arash:</strong><br> Don&#39;t push yourself too hard, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Arash:</strong><br> You may be the only Master who can Rayshift, but well, you know...</p><hr><p><strong>Arash:</strong><br> There&#39;s a limit to how much a single person can do.</p><p><strong>Arash:</strong><br> You have your Servants. You have Roman and Da Vinci at Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Arash:</strong><br> And... you have Mash. She&#39;s your partner, and she worries about you more than anyone.</p><p><strong>Arash:</strong><br> So don&#39;t try to do everything by yourself.<br> When things get tough, you can say so.</p><p><strong>Arash:</strong><br> It&#39;s not as if you&#39;re fighting alone.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I&#39;ve got you, too.</p><p><strong>Arash:</strong><br> Yeah, that&#39;s right.</p><p><strong>Arash:</strong><br> I&#39;m here, too. If you need me, I&#39;ll be your strength.</p><p><strong>Arash:</strong><br> If you&#39;re saving the world, I&#39;ll be at your side with my bow.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Okay, all set to go! The last attack isn&#39;t random, it comes with advance notice!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I&#39;ve prepared something special to finish off the simulation! Get ready, you two!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It&#39;s time, Senpai!<br> The last battle of the day!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> ...Is this coming from your experience?</p><p><strong>Arash:</strong><br> ...Maybe it is.</p><p><strong>Arash:</strong><br> When I was still alive on Earth...</p><p><strong>Arash:</strong><br> I tried to do everything myself.<br> I tried to save everything myself.</p><p><strong>Arash:</strong><br> The slain, their killers, plunderers, their victims. Everything. Everyone on the earth I could see.</p><p><strong>Arash:</strong><br> ...I tried to save the world.</p><p><strong>Arash:</strong><br> The world was still so small back then.<br> So I told myself that maybe I could do it.</p><p><strong>Arash:</strong><br> I was formed from remnants of the Age of Gods.<br> I&#39;m tougher than a human, and I possess some Mystics.</p><p><strong>Arash:</strong><br> My limbs. My eyes. My knowledge.<br> The Goddess gave me many things.</p><p><strong>Arash:</strong><br> I fought. I fought alone, under the banner of the dragon-slaying king...</p><p><strong>Arash:</strong><br> I kept fighting, to end a war that lasted decades.</p><p><strong>Arash:</strong><br> Both my king&#39;s nation and the enemy were exhausted.<br> A mess.</p><p><strong>Arash:</strong><br> Nobody wanted to fight anymore.</p><p><strong>Arash:</strong><br> So I ended it.<br> By myself.</p><p><strong>Arash:</strong><br> The king&#39;s people, the enemy&#39;s people, everyone wanted to end it, and I...</p><p><strong>Arash:</strong><br> I created it, their last chance.</p><p><strong>Arash:</strong><br> ...I did it alone.</p><p><strong>Arash:</strong><br> The king was worried about me, but in the end, I had subordinates but no friends.</p><p><strong>Arash:</strong><br> There was no one I could call a comrade.</p><p><strong>Arash:</strong><br> I chose to be alone myself.<br> Being born more than a human, it&#39;s only natural.</p><p><strong>Arash:</strong><br> Why, you ask? It&#39;s simple.</p><p><strong>Arash:</strong><br> To me, humans were people I had to protect.<br> So I kept my distance from them.</p><p><strong>Arash:</strong><br> ...And in the end, I was alone.</p><p><strong>Serenity:</strong><br> I cannot say for certain...<br> However...</p><p><strong>Serenity:</strong><br> \u201CHe is Arash, the strong and pure. A lonely warrior. Arash, bold like a lion.\u201D</p><p><strong>Serenity:</strong><br> The man I saw seems to be the exact same person who&#39;s still celebrated throughout the ages.</p><p><strong>Serenity:</strong><br> I can&#39;t be certain, and I have no proof.</p><p><strong>Serenity:</strong><br> But I think... he was so much greater a hero than any mortal man could be...</p><p><strong>Serenity:</strong><br> He was too strong. He was too pure.</p><p><strong>Serenity:</strong><br> Because of that, none could stand at his side.</p><p><strong>Arash:</strong><br> ...My bad. That was a pretty deep conversation.</p><p><strong>Arash:</strong><br> Hmm? What is it? You&#39;ve got a strange look on your face.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Okay, all set to go! The last attack isn&#39;t random, it comes with advance notice!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I&#39;ve prepared something special to finish off the simulation! Get ready, you two!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Doctor, d-don&#39;t interrupt them now!<br> This is important!</p><hr><p><strong>Arash:</strong><br> Looks like our break&#39;s over, Fujimaru. They gave us fair warning. Now&#39;s the time to get on your feet.</p><p><strong>Arash:</strong><br> I wonder what it&#39;ll be, maybe that dragon subspecies?</p><p><strong>Arash:</strong><br> I&#39;ll take on a sphinx or a Demon God Pillar too.<br> No way am I gonna lose to some soulless data!</p><p><strong>Arash:</strong><br> Now, give me your orders!<br> Let&#39;s give it all we&#39;ve got, Master!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I am not picking up any more enemies.<br> You&#39;ve won, Senpai!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I can&#39;t believe you beat them so quickly...<br> You&#39;re amazing, Senpai! Arash, too!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Huh? Did I screw up the data settings?<br> I don&#39;t think I did...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Anyway, good work! I still have to analyze it, but I think this is good data!</p><p><strong>Arash:</strong><br> Whew...I&#39;m glad that&#39;s over.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Good work, Arash.</p><p><strong>Arash:</strong><br> Yeah, you too.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Next time, let&#39;s fight together for real.</p><p><strong>Arash:</strong><br> Yeah, if you need me!</p><hr><p><strong>Arash:</strong><br> ...But it&#39;s strange, you know.</p><p><strong>Arash:</strong><br> This is probably the third time I&#39;ve fought to save the world. No, maybe the fourth?</p><p><strong>Arash:</strong><br> Who knows how many Holy Grail Wars I&#39;ve been in?<br> But, well, you know...</p><p><strong>Arash:</strong><br> There&#39;s one thing I do know.<br> It looks like I&#39;ve got good luck with Masters.</p><p><strong>Arash:</strong><br> I&#39;m glad to be by your side. If you need my help, I&#39;ll always give everything I&#39;ve got.</p><p><strong>Arash:</strong><br> More so than when I was alive!</p><p><strong>Arash:</strong><br> ...Let&#39;s save the world, Master!</p>', 273);
