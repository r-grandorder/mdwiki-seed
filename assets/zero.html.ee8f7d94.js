I&#39;ve been having trouble waking up for the past few days\u2014Oh.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Oh, you&#39;re here already, Senpai. As a master of REM sleep, I can see you are ready anytime.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Waking up immediately is a special skill I have.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I know. I noticed that when I first met you.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I still remember how cheerful you were when you woke up that day. That memory is one of my best to date.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Actually, I pulled an all-nighter...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That is not good. Chaldea time is now the benchmark in this world.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Senpai, staying past 1 in the morning is bad for your body. Even if you get login bonuses at 4.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Mash, I&#39;m glad to see that you&#39;re doing great, too.<br> Well, can I start briefing now?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Um...s-sure.<br> Sorry, Doctor.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> You were talking about a new Singularity, right? But Doctor, aren&#39;t those coordinates the same as Singularity F?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> It does appear that way on Chaldeas&#39; map, but the temporal axis is different.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> This Singularity corresponds to the point 10 years earlier in time than the Singularity F you guys investigated before.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I can&#39;t conclude that this is a Holy Grail for certain, but an extremely similar response has been observed.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Earlier, huh? But is it really possible that a Holy Grail would manifest at the same point so frequently?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Actually, even I can&#39;t explain that. So, I thought I would bring someone who seemed capable of doing it.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> I see. That&#39;s why you called me here.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Zhuge Liang... No,<br> Lord El-Melloi II!</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> Indeed, I am familiar with Fuyuki City in Japan...<br> Or so I&#39;d like to say.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> But unfortunately, my knowledge is estranged from the history recorded by Laplace here in Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> That&#39;s expected. Now that human history has been incinerated,</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> many different possibilities got mixed in with Chaldeas&#39; observation results.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Perhaps, Chaldeas didn&#39;t exist in the history where Mr. El-Melloi II came from.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Your world and our world... I am not sure which one is the proper history, however...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> It is obvious that both worlds are \u201Ccentered and extremely close to each other.\u201D Otherwise, you wouldn&#39;t have been summoned.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> You&#39;re talking about the cluster of parallel worlds in the Primary Branch... In other words, Phenomena Permissible for Revision that share the same future despite minor differences...</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> And Phenomena Designated for Removal: the cluster of parallel worlds that would eventually lead to ruin like fallen leaves.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> Unfortunately, that kind of topic is out of my purview.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> It&#39;s a part of the World that, unless you&#39;re one with a Heroic Spirit like me, is hard to understand.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> Besides, it&#39;s not something Fujimaru must hear, either.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> So, I&#39;m going to tell you only what I know. This is all just based on the events that occurred in my world, mind you.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> So. Your records indicate that the first Holy Grail War took place in Fuyuki City of 2004. However...</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> As far as I know, the Holy Grail War has occured five times in Fuyuki City.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Five times! That many!?</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fooou?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Hm, I see. So depending on the situation, the Holy Grail War already happened five times already.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> \u2014Wait, five times already!?<br> A ritual of that scale was performed five times!?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> How did they hide it from everybody!? Don&#39;t tell me the Holy Grail War is a competitive sport in your world,</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> and people treat it like the Olympic Games!?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> A rather amusing idea, but that&#39;s not it, Doctor.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> In our case, the Mage&#39;s Association and the Holy Church colluded to cover everything up.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> O-Of course they did... Whew, that scared me.<br> Please continue, Professor.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> The temporal axis observed this time was not the 2004 where Singularity F was located, but 10 years earlier... The Fourth Holy Grail War.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> When it comes to my world, it&#39;s not a surprise that you could detect a Holy Grail in the past at those coordinates.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The possibility that a Holy Grail could exist at that era in the past... Indeed, that would be able to give birth to a new Singularity.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Could this be a misadjustment on Sheba&#39;s part?<br> I mean, to observe the light of civilization in the past...</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> I personally hope that&#39;s the case.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> Now that human history has been incinerated, it&#39;s impossible to observe light on a normal temporal axis.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> If a light is lit on Chaldeas in its current state, that can only be a Singularity that&#39;s removed from the temporal axis.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> Am I right, Doctor?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> This is probably a stain that has already been disconnected from human history and will eventually contaminate it.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Exactly, Professor. No matter what this Singularity actually is, we must retrieve the Holy Grail that exists there.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> I suppose so. Retrieving or destroying it is the mission given to Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> ...However, there is a problem.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> The main reason why the Holy Grail War was repeated five times in Fuyuki was because the Holy Grail never manifested itself, not even once.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> Also, due to a certain accident, this ritual has been mutated to a state you can barely call it \u201Critual\u201D anymore.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> In conclusion, you mustn&#39;t retrieve this Holy Grail. It is a Holy Grail that must not manifest... It&#39;s just a poison.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> While it tempted the participants as a \u201Cwish granting device,\u201D in truth, it was merely a device of mass destruction created for the purpose to eliminating the world.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You are really knowledgeable.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> Of course, I did my research. Besides, it&#39;s my responsibility as a participant... No, I just want to reassure myself.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> I put in a considerate amount of effort to dismantle Fuyuki&#39;s Holy Grail.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> When it comes to the circumstances surrounding this land, I&#39;ve left no stone unturned.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> How dependable. From the way you sounded, I guess I don&#39;t have to ask you to help us, right?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> Doctor, you sure are a bad guy. You called me here because you wanted me to help, no?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> I will join this investigation. I believe I am the best observer, don&#39;t you think so?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You&#39;ll be a great help.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes! It&#39;ll be very assuring to have all the information about our destination.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> You say that, but you really want to go, right?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> I won&#39;t deny that. The Fourth Holy Grail War is a fateful event to me in no small way.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> And it&#39;s about to begin right now.<br> I&#39;d be lying if I said that I had no interest.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Then it&#39;s settled. Get ready for Rayshift now.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> The target coordinates are Fuyuki City, Japan, 1994.<br> Looks like it&#39;s gonna be different this time around, too. So watch out!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou, fooou!</p><h2 id="act-1-the-man-who-knows-fuyuki" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#act-1-the-man-who-knows-fuyuki" aria-hidden="true">#</a> ACT-1: &quot;The Man Who Knows Fuyuki&quot;</h2><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> So this is...Fuyuki before it was in flames?</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou, fou!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Looks peaceful.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes. Seeing how vibrant this city is...<br> Somehow I feel very relieved.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Is it rare for you?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Oh no. I&#39;ve seen the scenery of modern Japan during the incident of Ogawa-heim already. There&#39;s not much difference.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> But to think in 10 years, catastrophe would visit a quiet town like this...</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> You shouldn&#39;t be too sentimental. We exist in a world where everything&#39;s been incinerated, not just this town.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Y-You are right... But...</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> My apologies, I could&#39;ve worded it better. Yes, normal life is hard to come by, but don&#39;t get obsessed over it.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> Fearing the inevitable tragedy like the catastrophe of war would only slow you down.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> Because we fight as we are confronted with the destruction of mankind&#39;s past and future.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> What I meant was, we should keep that in mind, and prepare ourselves for any situation.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> Take this instance for example. You probably think there won&#39;t be any threat in a peaceful residential district at a time where everybody is asleep, correct?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That&#39;s right. To be honest, I find it hard to believe this place was the site for a Holy Grail War...</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> That perception is too naive. In a fight between mages, first you must question everything you see. For example...</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> Qi Men Dun Jia, Eight Gates Golden Locks Formation!</p><p><strong>Assassin:</strong><br> Ugh!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> !?</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Bfoooou!?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Assassin Servant!? Was that Presence Concealment!? But even so that was way too concealed!</p><p><strong>Assassin:</strong><br> D-Damn you! How is that possible!?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> Are you asking how is it possible for me to see through your Presence Concealment? Well, I couldn&#39;t.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> However, I do know from my investigation that the Assassin in the Fourth Holy Grail War could split into multiple entities and monitored the entirety of Fuyuki.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> I knew we&#39;d get caught in your surveillance network seeing how flashy Rayshifts can be. Then it&#39;s only natural for you to come scouting.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> Now that you&#39;re in my Stone Sentinel Maze, there&#39;s no point in you using Presence Concealment.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> Now, Fujimaru, it&#39;s time to put up a fight. I&#39;ll explain everything later.</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Enemy Servant eliminated. The battle is over.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> That was a pretty easy win.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> That was pretty weak for a Servant...</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> That was just one of the many Assassins. As you&#39;ve seen, that Assassin has the ability to split and manifest multiple bodies.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> That&#39;s why the fight is not over yet.<br> We must prepare for the next encounter.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Do you mean a single Heroic Spirit has the ability to manifest as a group?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> Not only is it a fearsome ability to use in espionage, unless one has an Anti-Army Noble Phantasm, it means that Assassin can overwhelm any opponent with sheer numbers alone.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> Humph, but now that I&#39;ve mastered Qi Men Dun Jia, they&#39;ll just end up as my prey.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> They&#39;d have to keep the entire Fuyuki area under surveillance for the time being. That said, they can&#39;t exactly ignore us either.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> Assassin will most likely keep sending people to attack us.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> As a result, they have broken the golden rule of military strategy by continuously investing their combat personnel without reserve. How very sad, indeed.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> We&#39;ll have to fight them one after another, but they shouldn&#39;t pose too much of a threat.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> Just take them out the minute you lay eyes on them. Now then, there&#39;s no time to waste. Onward I say! Onward!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Huh? But...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Aren&#39;t you going to give us an explanation now?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> What the heck is even going on right now?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> Apologies, but it will have to wait. I&#39;m not trying to be pompous, it&#39;s just we&#39;re in a race against time.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> Oh, don&#39;t make that face. I&#39;ll explain as many things as I can on our way, starting with the most vital matters.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fooou...</p><h2 id="act-2-military-intervention" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#act-2-military-intervention" aria-hidden="true">#</a> ACT-2: &quot;Military Intervention&quot;</h2><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> To be honest, the Holy Grail War in Fuyuki is basically a scam.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> The whole \u201Cbattle royale for the chance to grant your wish\u201D format is just an outright lie to lure in participants.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> A lie? That&#39;s terrible... Tricking someone by telling them their wishes will be granted... That&#39;s criminal!</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> It absolutely is. If these Holy Grail Wars were a widespread thing in a different world, I bet there&#39;d be a lot of lawsuits being filed over them.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> That being said, in this world...</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> That is, in my world, that didn&#39;t happen.<br> That&#39;s because Holy Grail Wars only took place here.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> It was an insidious trap. One that, with the defeat of each participating Servant, means an unprecedented disaster draws closer.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> When the required number of summoned Servant have been sacrificed, \u201CAll the Evils of the World\u201D A\u014Bra Mainiiu will activate.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> All the Evils of the World?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> That&#39;s a pretty dangerous-sounding name.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> You don&#39;t need to know everything. Just consider it something like a bomb that could destroy the world.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> It has more than enough power to wipe out the entirety of human history up to that point.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> Singularity F, the first foundation you all have restored...</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> I see that as the likely state of Fuyuki after the conclusion of the Fifth Holy Grail War.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> The first point to fall as the world crumbled. All because a ritual that should have never been carried out was indeed completed.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> But why would someone set a trap like that?<br> Who would do that?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> This ritual started off with a very different purpose, and became what it is through a ridiculous man-made disaster.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> That disaster is a \u201Cpast event\u201D even in this timeline.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> At any rate, the problem is that the paradox Sheba detected in this era is like a Holy Grail.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I see, if the Holy Grail is already here...</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> Yes. If the Holy Grail has already manifested, this city should be in flames right now. But at a glance, that&#39;s not really the case.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> So the Holy Grail detected by Chaldea is likely something different from Fuyuki&#39;s Greater Grail, corrupted by A\u014Bra Mainiiu.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> If I recall, this Fourth Holy Grail War is still in its early stages now. Tonight is when everything moves into motion. We can use that.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Ah, I see. So that&#39;s why you&#39;ve been so conscious of the time today.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> That&#39;s right. Right now, it&#39;s critical that we stay ahead of events. This harbor district will be the key.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> What&#39;s going to happen here?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> Hmm, it seems we have to end our chitchat before I get to explain that. The events have caught up to us.</p><p><strong>E\uFF1A???:</strong><br> You there. May I ask who you are?</p><p><strong>E\uFF1A???:</strong><br> It seems you are also participants in the Holy Grail War... Seeing how you have Servants with you.</p><p><strong>F\uFF1ASaber:</strong><br> Irisviel, something is strange. I no longer detect the presence of Lancer, who invited us here.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Is that... Saber?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> She appears to be, but that&#39;s not her. I mean, she&#39;s contracted with another Master already!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Is this another Heroine X incident?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Let&#39;s not go there for now, Senpai.<br> This time, we&#39;re being serious here...</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> That is one of the seven Heroic Spirits summoned into the Fourth Holy Grail War. Class Saber, Altria Pendragon.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> That being the case, sorry, but we will be your opponent now instead of Lancer.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> Irisviel von Einzbern.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> What... You! How do you know my True Name!?</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong><br> This is no ordinary opponent.<br> Be careful, Saber!</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> Okay, Fujimaru, time for Round 2. But this opponent is quite powerful. She&#39;s on an entirely different level from Assassin.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> I realize I&#39;m shoving you into a rather difficult fight, but unfortunately, I need to put one more restriction on you.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> ...I&#39;m sorry, but don&#39;t defeat Saber here.<br> Only push far enough to make her retreat.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> That&#39;s a tall order!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> And how do you propose we do that?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> I already told you we&#39;re pressed for time. I&#39;ll explain everything later. Now, go on and do your best!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou, fooou!?</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The enemy Saber has withdrawn from battle!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> We don&#39;t need to go after her?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> Leave her be.<br> The next one is who we should go after.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The next...one?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> I&#39;ve been keeping the Servant who was supposed to fight Saber in my Qi Men Dun Jia formation. But it&#39;s about time...</p><p><strong>Lancer:</strong><br> Who are you? Was that strange stone maze your doing!? What happened to Saber!?</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Something really came out!</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> Calm yourself, First Spear of the Knights of Fianna. We&#39;re not Archibald&#39;s enemies.</p><p><strong>Lancer:</strong><br> What!?<br> You know my True Name...</p><p><strong>F\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Humph. We seem to be faced with a formidable opponent. How did you know that I was Lancer&#39;s Master?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ? Where is that voice coming from?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> He&#39;s shielding himself with magecraft.<br> This Servant&#39;s Master is hiding somewhere close by.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> Lord Kayneth, we have hastened to join your side and stand in support of you.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> For certain reasons, I cannot divulge my name, so let me give the name of Lady Reines as my guarantor for the time being.</p><p><strong>F\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Reines... My niece?<br> I demand to know what is going on here!</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> Though I would not hesitate to provide an explanation at the present time, I would beg your forbearance until tomorrow.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> However, allow me to say just one thing in advance: I can tell you the current location of Caster.</p><p><strong>F\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Caster? How do you know that?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> Tomorrow at noon, I will prove the truth of my words.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> I will show you anew what value lies in listening to our story.</p><p><strong>F\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Humph...</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> Then, we will pay a visit to your penthouse suite in Fuyuki New Tower at 10 p.m. tomorrow night. So for tonight, will you allow us to go?</p><p><strong>F\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Ohh? So you even know my address, do you?<br> ...Very well. I don&#39;t dislike a smart man like yourself.</p><p><strong>F\uFF1A???:</strong><br> All the more if you&#39;re a mage with a sense of gratitude. But that faint trace of a working-class accent in your English... What a shame.</p><p><strong>F\uFF1A???:</strong><br> But, very well. I shall accept your proposal.</p><p><strong>F\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Having observed how you handled Saber earlier, we will depart here in peace.</p><p><strong>Kayneth:</strong><br> I will neither flee nor hide myself. I look forward to hearing just what it is you&#39;re planning.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That&#39;s... Lancer&#39;s Master?</p><p><strong>Lancer:</strong><br> Are you certain about this, Master?</p><p><strong>Kayneth:</strong><br> Patience, Lancer. Yes, they are clearly a suspicious bunch. But when you know so little about what you face, it&#39;s best to wait and observe.</p><p><strong>Kayneth:</strong><br> Best to be cautious when starting a fight, got it?</p><p><strong>Lancer:</strong><br> ...Understood.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> Then we&#39;ll be taking our leave.<br> Come, let&#39;s get going, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> Now then, we can finally take a moment to talk properly. How far did I get in my explanation earlier?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You said that once this war ends, the world will be destroyed...</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> Ah yes, that&#39;s right. Defeated Servants are absorbed into the Greater Grail of Fuyuki as sacrifices to bring it to completion.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> But what happens then is not the granting of a wish, but the release of A\u014Bra Mainiiu... From the start, this war was never meant to have a winner.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> What a cruel tale...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> After investing so much of yourself and even murdering fellow mages, your reward is the opposite of what you would wish... That&#39;s truly cruel...</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> It certainly is. I imagine if I&#39;d been the winner of the Fifth Holy Grail War, I would have turned evil from despair.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> Forgive me. And to think I&#39;m the one who&#39;s always saying sentimentality is pointless.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> In my experience, the Greater Grail activates in a limited capacity after the defeat of the fifth Servant.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> However, that also means that if we can convince at least three Servants to withdraw from the battlefield intact...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Then the ritual will end up eternally in limbo, the Holy Grail will remain incomplete, and we can simply secure its vessel. Right?</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fooou.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Understood. So this time, we won&#39;t be fighting to defeat the other Servants, but to protect them, in a sense.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Though it&#39;d be best if we could resolve all this amicably.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> Right. But we can&#39;t assume everyone will agree peacefully.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> Since we want the War to end in a stalemate, we need to first seek out and defeat the Servants with whom such an agreement is impossible.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Just when I thought you were a gentleman!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Just when I thought reason would triumph!</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> I&#39;m aware of my own savagery. Let me say right now that I started off as a cowardly, subservient boy.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> But the war strategist I housed in my body gets so worked up I couldn&#39;t help but change.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> He is THE Zhuge Liang.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> Truly. Strategists in Ancient China can get even more violent and ruthless than military generals.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Sayest thou truly?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> What kind of foolishness is that?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> It&#39;s one thing if theater actors or poets use that language, but why would you talk like that? Are you making fun of them?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> Show some respect!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou, fofofooou...</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> Now, back to our conversation.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> Of the participants in this Holy Grail War, there are two Servants we couldn&#39;t even try to spare... Caster and Archer.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> Without a shred of doubt, I can say those two would be incapable of reaching an understanding with us.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> So it&#39;d be best to get them out of the way before they start engaging other Servants.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> That brings us to Assassin. Their Master is colluding with the one in possession of Archer.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> Since we plan to fight Archer, we&#39;ll inevitably have to fight Assassin too. Though they&#39;ve already marked us as opponents anyway.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Oh, the one we fought right after we Rayshifted here...</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> Next, we have Berserker... Since his madness prevents us from reasoning with him directly, everything depends on his Master.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> The key will be whether we can convince the Master while he&#39;s still able to keep full control over Berserker without having to use Command Spells.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> That said, there&#39;s always the possibility Berserker could go on a rampage himself, independent of his Master&#39;s will.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> One vital thing I learned after the Fourth War ended is that the one who&#39;d summoned Berserker was in an extremely unstable condition, both physically and mentally.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> But I never did get to meet him myself...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Well then, shall we put dealing with Berserker on hold for now?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> Though I can&#39;t help but feel it is risky, yes.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> Therefore, by process of elimination, we can conclude that our best chances for success lie with Saber, Lancer, and Rider.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Ahh, so that&#39;s why you prevented that clash on the docks between Saber and Lancer.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Then that only leaves Rider&#39;s faction.<br> Do you think they&#39;d be likely to cooperate?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Why are you falling quiet all of a sudden?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Is there something worrying you?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> ...Yes. It all depends on how well I can get them to accept what I&#39;ll say to them.</p><h2 id="act-3-second-owner" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#act-3-second-owner" aria-hidden="true">#</a> ACT-3: &quot;Second Owner&quot;</h2><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Well, Mash?

With how I am now, I can tell the structure of this spell is very solid.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> What should we do? At this rate we won&#39;t be able to get supplies from Chaldea.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> We&#39;ve got no choice but to destroy the keystones the mage placed, and take the Leyline for ourselves.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> They should be fairly well-defended,<br> but we&#39;ll have to break through.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> I&#39;d like to avoid unnecessary combat, because we can&#39;t fight on an empty stomach. Nothing for it.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> You mean destroy the barrier keystones!? If you do that, won&#39;t the mage, the Second Owner, get mad?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> Of course. But the family that owns this land, the Tohsakas, are also the mages that summoned Archer.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> In other words, they&#39;re our enemies to begin with.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...I see. But the keystone to the Leylines should be carefully hidden, right?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> Don&#39;t worry. I know where they are already.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> What? How did you find out?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> The next heir to the Tohsaka clan is a student of mine. In the end, I dismantle the Greater Grail here with her help.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> When that happens, I learn the structure of the Leylines in this area.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Wait a second. You&#39;re going to wreck your future student&#39;s estate?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> This future happens in a different timeline. I have no duty or responsibility to the Tohsakas in this era.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> And the Tohsaka family was one of the clans responsible for the Fuyuki Holy Grail War.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> If they lose their Leyline and become impoverished, it&#39;s their own fault.

He seems similar to Emiya-senpai, the Archer...</p><p><strong>Assassin?:</strong><br> !?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Everyone, be careful! I&#39;m seeing a new Servant.<br> They&#39;re heading straight for you!</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> What? Who could it be now... Oh, no!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Oh no! Master, get down!</p><p><strong>Assassin?:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Are you okay, Master?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Yeah, thanks.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Good... But we let Assassin get away just now. I&#39;m sorry.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Where did Assassin go?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...I&#39;m sorry. I lost track of his magical energy.<br> He&#39;s probably already left the battlefield.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> That lightning just now destroyed my Golden Locks Formation as well. Curse them...</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong><br> Oooh! The battle&#39;s already begun, it seems.<br> Looks like we&#39;re a little late, kid.</p><p><strong>Waver:</strong><br> Huh? That&#39;s strange.<br> I was sure we&#39;d be the first.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Th-That&#39;s...</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I definitely know that face!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> This is getting complicated!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yeah. That Servant is probably Rider, but that Master is...</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> The first ones here? You idiot!</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> You know more than anybody how primitive the method you used to find this place was!</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> You didn&#39;t really think you could get a leg up on some of the best mages in the world with that, did you?</p><p><strong>Waver:</strong><br> W-Who are you? What are you talking about...</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> This time, and every other time, you only make it through your problems thanks to good luck!</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> And because things work out in the end, you start to overestimate your own strength!</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> That&#39;s why you never get better!<br> You know this, right? RIGHT?</p><p><strong>Waver:</strong><br> Wait a second! Why do I have to get a lecture from someone I&#39;ve never met?</p><p><strong>Waver:</strong><br> Who are you, anyway? You&#39;re not the Caster who kidnapped the kids, or his Master, are you?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> You idiot! You can&#39;t even analyze a situation properly!? I&#39;m astonished you thought you could survive a Holy Grail War...</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> Christ! You&#39;re an idiot! An idiot! A huge idiot!<br> Go choke on some rice and die!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Something seems to have gotten into Lord El-Melloi...</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> No one likes confronting their own past.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> It&#39;s funny. Let&#39;s watch for a minute.</p><p><strong>Waver:</strong><br> W-Who do you think you are, anyway?<br> Status-wise, you&#39;re clearly a Caster!</p><p><strong>Waver:</strong><br> The Overseer&#39;s figured out that you&#39;re ignoring the Holy Grail War to do evil things.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> BULLSHIT! If you can view someone&#39;s status, you should be able to figure out that I&#39;m a Pseudo-Servant, you moron!</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> God, this is pathetic! The Command Spells on your hand are crying out in shame!</p><p><strong>Waver:</strong><br> W-W-Whaaaat? A Pseudo-what?</p><p><strong>Waver:</strong><br> It doesn&#39;t make sense for there to be extra Casters!<br> No one said anything about this!</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong><br> Hang on, kid. Whether or not that guy&#39;s a Caster, he&#39;s definitely not the owner of this workshop.</p><p><strong>Waver:</strong><br> Huh? H-How can you tell?</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong><br> By looking at the traces left here. Neither side was using the terrain, or trying to avoid damage to the area when they fought.</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong><br> This wasn&#39;t a battle between an attacker and defender. Someone tried to run, and someone tried to stop them.</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong><br> So neither the one who fled when we arrived, nor these people, are our enemy. They must be someone else.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> Yes. The King of Conquerors knows exactly how to read a battlefield.</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong><br> Anyway, you, with the gloomy face.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> W-What...is it?</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong><br> You&#39;ve been picking on the kid an awful lot.</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong><br> Does that mean you&#39;re prepared to fight the King of Conquerors?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> W-Why would it mean that?<br> You know exactly which of us is in the right!</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong><br> Maybe, but he is my Master.</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong><br> If you want to pick a fight with him, as his Servant, that means you&#39;ll have to fight me.</p><p><strong>Waver:</strong><br> Rider, you...</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> Tch... That&#39;s...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Um, Lord?<br> I thought the plan was to not fight Rider?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> Let&#39;s retreat, Fujimaru.<br> There&#39;s no sense in fighting here.</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong><br> Humph. How boring.<br> And I thought you had a little more spine.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Waver:</strong><br> Hah! So you&#39;re gonna say all that, and then turn tail and run? What a wimp!</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong><br> Hey, don&#39;t get cocky.</p><p><strong>Waver:</strong><br> GWAH!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> He sent that kid flying with the flick of a finger!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> What a fickle creature...</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> Gaah! This is pissing me off! A Servant shouldn&#39;t be getting involved in his Master&#39;s fights! Are you a helicopter parent or something?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Calm down, Professor.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> No, I think they&#39;re supposed to do that...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> But we were lucky enough to run into our third target to protect, the Rider Servant...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Was it okay for things to fall apart like that?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> I don&#39;t care! They don&#39;t plan on seriously fighting anyway.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> Ignore them, they&#39;ll just sit in their hideout to eat rice crackers and watch videos all day!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I don&#39;t know...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Looks like Rider is a touchy subject for Lord El-Melloi, Senpai.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> It&#39;s a problem.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> We&#39;ll have to deal with it ourselves.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I think so too, yes.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fooou.</p><h2 id="act-9-the-king-of-knights-returns" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#act-9-the-king-of-knights-returns" aria-hidden="true">#</a> ACT-9: The King of Knights Returns&quot;</h2><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The summoning circle&#39;s complete.

It&#39;ll be a good practice lesson.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You&#39;re a tough teacher, huh?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Isn&#39;t that kind of mean?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> Not at all. I&#39;m simply offering my students challenges equal to their abilities and tenacity.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> In other words, I hold the daughter of the Tohsakas in extremely high regard... No point in talking about that now, though.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Um, I&#39;m sorry to interrupt your break, but...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...You have a visitor. One approaching Servant.<br> Looks like a Saber.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Saber... Altria Pendragon, the one we saw at the wharf?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> Probably.<br> Hmm... I guess we exposed ourselves too much.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> We made it very obvious that we&#39;re an enemy.<br> It&#39;s inevitable that they&#39;d retaliate.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> Servant, Saber-class. Once again, I challenge you.<br> Let&#39;s have a fair fight.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> A fair fight, huh? Humph.<br> I know exactly what you&#39;re up to.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> For this Holy Grail War, the Einzberns are using their Servant as a decoy, while a hired assassin strikes from the shadows.</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong><br> What? I&#39;ll thank you not to make false accusations.</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong><br> And what are you planning?

But it would hurt us to leave this circle we just established.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> We have the high ground, Fujimaru.<br> We&#39;ll draw out the battle until they decide to leave.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Got it!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> We&#39;ll go with that plan.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> And Mash, in this battle keep an eye out for ambushes on your Master.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> I&#39;ll use my Qi Men Dun Jia to support you.<br> If you sense anything strange, deal with it immediately.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Roger!

But that attack...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes, it wasn&#39;t targeted at Senpai.<br> It was for Saber&#39;s Master.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> They&#39;re not working with the Einzberns?<br> So they&#39;re someone else entirely?</p><p><strong>Assassin?:</strong><br> Spells that control the terrain make it so I can&#39;t hide, huh?

I cannot coexist with those trapped by ethics.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Assassin has retreated.<br> ...Shall we follow?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> No. Let&#39;s avoid any other battles. Overexerting ourselves just makes us a target for other enemies.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fooou.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> I&#39;d like to suggest to Einzbern that she put away her weapon for the day.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> You have more threats to worry about than just us.</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong><br> ...Very well.<br> You did save us.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> You may not believe me, but we don&#39;t intend to make enemies of the Einzbern clan.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> We couldn&#39;t help what happened on the wharf.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> In fact, I&#39;d imagine Saber there found it strange that we didn&#39;t pursue her.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> ...That&#39;s right, Irisviel. There&#39;s something strange about the way they fight.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> I don&#39;t know why, but there&#39;s a meekness, as if they&#39;re trying to keep themselves from winning.</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong><br> I&#39;ll make this simple. Are you our enemies, or our friends?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> Our goal does not involve the battle for the Grail, and to achieve that, we need your Saber to be kept safe.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> That&#39;s all I can say for now while still telling you the truth.</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong><br> ...Very well. As long as you don&#39;t make yourselves obvious enemies of the Einzberns, we&#39;ll leave you alone.</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong><br> We have lots of other enemies that we need to prioritize first.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> Let me ask you something.<br> Do you know who that Assassin was?</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong><br> Not really. He was saying something strange. That neither of you were participants in the Holy Grail War...</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> That Assassin&#39;s presence is clearly an irregularity.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> Not that we&#39;re one to talk, in that respect. Our immediate goal is to solve the mystery of his identity.</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong><br> The mystery, huh? He did seem strange, yes.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> What do you mean?</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong><br> I&#39;ve never met him, but for some reason...he seems like someone I&#39;m deeply related to.</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong><br> Like he was here only to kill me, and I was only here to be killed by him...</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> That can&#39;t be true!</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong><br> It felt like we existed only to destroy and be destroyed.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> The intuition of a homunculus, the crowning achievement of the Einzberns&#39; most secret techniques, cannot be easily dismissed.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> ...Fated to kill each other... No.<br> No, Irisviel. That&#39;s not true.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> I will protect you with my blade.<br> You are here on this battlefield to be victorious.</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong><br> Yes, you&#39;re right. With a Servant like you at my side,<br> I have nothing to fear at all.</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong><br> One last thing, Heroic Spirit with the shield.<br> Your support was wonderful.

But what about Lancer... What about Lord Archibald?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> He&#39;s still enemies with Saber over the Grail, right?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> That&#39;s the problem.

Seems like we&#39;ll need to come up with another plan.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Do you have some way to persuade him?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> If you want to convince someone of something, the fastest way is to present them with an illusion they want to hear.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> As Lord Kayneth thinks that the world revolves around him...</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> ...he&#39;s likely to believe anything that reinforces that.<br> A true strategist can control people&#39;s minds with ease.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Foufoufou!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Zhuge Liang, that&#39;s a con man, not a strategist.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> But first...

But I&#39;m not certain that it justified the trouble you went through...</p><p><strong>Kayneth:</strong><br> What? What do you mean?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> There&#39;s been a major development on our side.<br> A decisive improvement, you could say.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> We were able to observe several factors that were still uncertain, allowing us to share much more information with you while still avoiding paradoxes.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> As a result... We can now tell you the entire truth.<br> The whole truth about the Fuyuki Grail War.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> (Fo?)</p><p><strong>Kayneth:</strong><br> W-What do you mean?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> Didn&#39;t you find it strange to begin with?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> Why would a huge ceremony involving a battle for an omnipotent wish granter take place in the middle of nowhere, so far from the Clock Tower?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> And then there&#39;s the fact that out of seven participants, only one slot was provided for the Mage&#39;s Association.</p><p><strong>Kayneth:</strong><br> Yes, well... that&#39;s why I participated. Even if it didn&#39;t live up to its reputation, it was still a fun game with little risk.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> It&#39;s worse than simply not living up to its reputation.<br> The whole Fuyuki Grail War is a fake.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> (Whaaaat?)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> (Hello!?)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> (Senpai, you&#39;re letting it show! Keep a poker face!)</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> This is all a conspiracy by an enemy of the Archibald family, the Trambelios.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> The plan was to get you away from the Clock Tower for a period of time,</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> and then while you were away, quickly expand their influence in the Mage&#39;s Association!</p><p><strong>Kayneth:</strong><br> W-What!?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> We knew that you would fall for this Trambelio trap, and decided to intervene in the past.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> But we couldn&#39;t warn you about it in advance.<br> In order to share knowledge of the future...</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> We needed to observe unshakable evidence in the past that a conspiracy existed.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> (Wow... How does he come up with this stuff...?)</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> (...Fou.)</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> Last night we found that proof. We have direct testimony from the Tohsakas, one of the three clans behind the Holy Grail War.</p><p><strong>Kayneth:</strong><br> H-How did you get it?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> We destroyed every Leyline we could find in this city.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> Of course, this destruction had nothing to do with the Grail War, but that&#39;s why the Tohsakas gave in.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> They didn&#39;t want to lose the rights to their land over a fake Holy Grail War.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> The Tohsakas confessed to colluding with the Trambelios in order to lure you out with a fake fourth Grail War.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> (What makes it worse is that he&#39;s mixing in truth with the lies...)</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> They knew you wanted glory not as a researcher, but as a warrior, and created the perfect arena to lure you out...</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> That&#39;s the true nature of the Fuyuki ritual.<br> The other participants, the Holy Church&#39;s Overseer...</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> They&#39;re all decoys to make the farce more believable.</p><p><strong>Kayneth:</strong><br> How intricate! How wicked!</p><p><strong>Kayneth:</strong><br> ...But those Trambelios, those fools that espouse \u201Cdemocracy\u201D so much, might just do something like that!</p><p><strong>Kayneth:</strong><br> Why... Why have I wasted so much of my valuable time on this!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> (Welp... He fell for it. Yeah.)</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> But it wasn&#39;t a total loss.<br> Your defeat of Caster was truly impressive.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> I think that display of boldness may have only increased Lady Sola-Ui&#39;s love for you.</p><p><strong>Kayneth:</strong><br> Y-You think so? Hmm...</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> I&#39;m sure of it. I am a man who&#39;s very sensitive to how women feel in that regard. I believe it was\u2014</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> \u201CI was never interested in him before, but now that I&#39;ve seen how brave he is, I&#39;ve gone from hating him to loving him!\u201D</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> It was a change of that magnitude, I believe.</p><p><strong>Kayneth:</strong><br> Oh, my! Wait, what was that one part? Well, whatever. It all worked out in the end!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> (Oh... I&#39;m starting to kind of feel bad for him...)</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> But still, there is no time to waste. You must hurry to London, and stop the Trambelio plot!</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> No matter how secure the Archibald family is, without you they&#39;re no match for the wicked plots of the populists.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> The aristocracy\u2014<br> The feat of our very clan depends on this!</p><p><strong>Kayneth:</strong><br> Curse those sneaky Trambelios!<br> Curse you, Valuayeta!</p><p><strong>Kayneth:</strong><br> I&#39;ll show you a thing or two! Sola-Ui!<br> Hurry and get ready!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> (Fooou...)</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> Our new battle lies beyond the sea... Master, I, Diarmuid, shall accompany you!</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> I never had a wish for the Grail to begin with.<br> My spear shall accompany you, no matter the battle!</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> Oh, excellent. I&#39;m sure that if you have a Servant at your side, Lady Sola-Ui will be very happy.</p><p><strong>Kayneth:</strong><br> ...Uh...hmm...</p><p><strong>Kayneth:</strong><br> Lancer, by my Command Spell, I order you.<br> Stay here and continue the Holy Grail War.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> W-What!?</p><p><strong>Kayneth:</strong><br> Farce or not, now that I&#39;ve entered the battle,<br> I must win it in order to maintain my reputation.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> Amazing, Lord El-Melloi! You know exactly how important the Archibald reputation is!</p><p><strong>Kayneth:</strong><br> I leave you my Servant as a present.<br> You may represent the clan in my stead.</p><p><strong>Kayneth:</strong><br> Defeat everyone involved in this stupid farce, and show them who is truly strong.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> Leave it to me!</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> ...Very well. If you say so, Master.<br> I shall do my best with my new Master.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> (This is awful! I&#39;ve never seen someone get a Servant contract just by making stuff up!)</p><p><strong>Kayneth:</strong><br> ...Oh, one last thing. You said you saw a draft of a love letter in my study, right?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> ...? Yes. What of it?</p><p><strong>Kayneth:</strong><br> I would never allow someone to search my room while there was something so foolish still in it.</p><p><strong>Kayneth:</strong><br> Am I wrong in thinking that the study you refer to...is one whose master never returned to it?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> ...Yes. That&#39;s right.</p><p><strong>Kayneth:</strong><br> Humph. I suppose in that regard, I should thank you.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> ...Your words honor me, my old Master. You are the Lord I wished to be. You are the great El-Melloi.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> Your talents are the greatest treasure the Clock Tower has. Please, take care of yourself.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Lord El-Melloi... I guess here I&#39;ll call you Lord El-Melloi II, but...</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> What is it?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I&#39;m likely wasting my time here, but all those lies you told your predecessor...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> You&#39;re aware of how false they really are, right?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> What do you mean, Doctor?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Chaldea isn&#39;t a time machine.<br> And you guys aren&#39;t there from the future.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> This Singularity is just a tiny little area. A bubble appearing on the ashes of human history.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Once the irregularity that created the bubble is gone...it will be like a dream that has nothing to do with real history.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Thus, no matter how hard you work, you can&#39;t actually change history.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Even if you save someone here, that salvation is only temporary.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> In the timeline you&#39;re from, the dead will remain dead, and the tragedy will remain a tragedy.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> It&#39;s theoretically impossible to change the past via a Rayshift. Everything you&#39;re doing...is meaningless.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fooou...</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> And why does that matter, Doctor?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I just wanted to make sure that you personally knew that nothing would come of this.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> It seems to me like you&#39;re trying to get through this as peacefully and smoothly as possible.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> But you don&#39;t need to. There are simpler and easier ways, aren&#39;t there?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> Nothing will come of it, huh? ...Maybe that&#39;s how it looks to you. But to me, this has a lot of meaning.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> Even if I can&#39;t really save them, I wanted to do the best I could here.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> This isn&#39;t atonement for the past.<br> My heart refused to let me\u2014</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> \u2014be weak enough to make the same mistake twice. That&#39;s all.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> You&#39;re free to laugh at me if you like.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> I just don&#39;t want to be forced to realize my own powerlessness again.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> Of course, the pain of regret is mine alone.<br> It means nothing to anyone else.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> In that regard, I do feel bad for wasting Fujimaru and Mash&#39;s time, but...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I don&#39;t mind.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> It&#39;s not a waste.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> You&#39;re right. It&#39;s wrong to see something bad happening and not try to do anything to stop it.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Regardless of the result,<br> I agree with Lord El-Melloi&#39;s plan.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou!</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> Thank you. That helps a lot.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...I see. That&#39;s what it is to be human, huh?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Okay. I won&#39;t bring it up again.<br> So do you have a plan for our next move?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> Yes. Kayneth prepared an alliance for us with the Berserker group.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> We&#39;d be foolish to let that go to waste.</p><h2 id="act-12-discussing-the-holy-grail" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#act-12-discussing-the-holy-grail" aria-hidden="true">#</a> ACT-12: &quot;Discussing the Holy Grail&quot;</h2><p><strong>Matou Kariya:</strong><br> ...You&#39;re Lancer&#39;s Master?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> I&#39;ve been asked to participate in the Holy Grail War in his stead.

Of course, it has a powerful barrier.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou, fou!?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Wait, is it okay for us to just walk straight into a dangerous place like that?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> It&#39;s not a problem.

I am the King of Heroes, and none may stand against me.</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong><br> I see. So you&#39;re laying down the law as a king, then?

Okay?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Hmm? Hold on a second. I&#39;m getting a magical energy signature approaching you. Its strength indicates it&#39;s a Servant.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> It&#39;s different from any remaining Assassin fragments, and also from Rider and Berserker who retreated earlier.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That means...the figures don&#39;t add up, right?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> Yeah. There are only seven Heroic Spirits that the Fuyuki Holy Grail can call forth. Meaning it&#39;s an irregular like us. It&#39;s him.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> You mean he&#39;s going after Irisviel again?</p><p><strong>Assassin?:</strong><br> I look away for one second and you&#39;ve got even more friends, huh? You guys are such a pain.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> Now that you&#39;ve been caught twice by the Eight Gates Golden Locks Formation, you realize it&#39;s pointless to hide your presence?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> But how condescending of you to just walk straight up to us.</p><p><strong>Assassin?:</strong><br> Well, I&#39;ll never get anywhere just waiting for my chance.</p><p><strong>Assassin?:</strong><br> The Holy Grail War is nearing its end, and before its conclusion, I must have that homunculus destroyed.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> So you&#39;re after the vessel of the Holy Grail after all. It seems like our goals are similar, but our methodology is different.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> The vessel of the Holy Grail?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> Yes. She&#39;s pretending to be Saber&#39;s Master, but...</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> She is serving a different purpose. She collects the souls of fallen Heroic Spirits... A Lesser Grail, the key that opens the Greater Grail.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> Like giving an autonomous personality to ceremonial equipment.</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong><br> You&#39;re quite knowledgeable. But I don&#39;t really like you saying I&#39;m pretending to be a Master. Am I not a proper Master? Is that what you want to say?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> There&#39;s no reason to hide anything this late in the game, homunculus.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> Irisviel is being used as bait. I know the true Master is hiding in the shadows.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> What do you mean? Irisviel is my Master, totally and completely. I am not contracted to anyone else...</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> What?</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong><br> Will you see this and still doubt?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> Command Spells!? Then you really did contract with Saber?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Lord El-Melloi, this is no time to be surprised!<br> The enemy Servant is coming at us!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Assassin?:</strong><br> Tch, giving me a hard time...</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> Hold on. Fighting any more isn&#39;t going to get us anywhere. There&#39;s nothing for either of us to gain.</p><p><strong>Assassin?:</strong><br> Either of us to gain? It&#39;s almost like you completely understand what&#39;s going on with me.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> You have nothing going on, personally.<br> You&#39;re a Servant without a Master.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> You&#39;re not fighting to benefit anyone at all.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> No Master? Then what about the contract?<br> How is he getting supplied with magical energy?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> Of course, a Servant can only materialize in this world when there&#39;s a summoning and a contract.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> However, in his case, the contract wasn&#39;t made with a human. ...Isn&#39;t that right, envoy of the Counter Force?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> The Counter Force?! Then this Heroic Spirit has contracted with the World itself!?</p><p><strong>Assassin?:</strong><br> ...How did you come to that conclusion?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> We&#39;re not part of this temporal axis, and thus have a bird&#39;s-eye view of the situation here.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> We know that the end of the Holy Grail War here in Fuyuki will lead to the end of the world.</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong><br> What was that? What do you mean?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> ...I wasn&#39;t going to say anything until the end, but there&#39;s nothing for it. I&#39;m coming clean.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> The ritual here at Fuyuki will succeed, unlike in the past and future, and it will lead to the activation of the Greater Grail.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> The reason all of this was observed by Sheba\u2014was that this area had to be the cause of the Singularity.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I see! It wasn&#39;t just observed as an unstable dimension, but as the origin of the collapse that would become the Singularity!</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong><br> You guys...know not only of the past, but also the future? From a different temporal axis?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> That is correct. I witnessed the failure of the fourth war, investigated the fifth war, and prevented the sixth war from happening. That&#39;s who I am.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> And I&#39;ve assumed the role of pinpointing what makes this battle different from the others I&#39;ve known.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> And the answer to that...is you, Irisviel. You are the vessel of the Holy Grail, and also a Master that controls a Servant.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> It was supposed to take another 10 years to complete. The Einzbern family&#39;s ultimate homunculus.</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong><br> Ten years? That&#39;s...</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> It&#39;s a small difference, but this is a definite advantage.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> I mean, for the Einzbern family to find a way to win not via a makeshift guerilla warfare, but actual frontal assault...</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> Having a Master with the highest specs, commanding the strongest Servant, and access to the Lesser Grail.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> Victory is certain for Einzbern. And this victory is plenty reason...for the Counter Force to activate.</p><p><strong>Assassin?:</strong><br> ...The Holy Grail War you know of didn&#39;t have any interference from the Counter Force?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> That&#39;s right. It wasn&#39;t a factor during the third war. Meanwhile the chance of success was about fifty-fifty during the fourth and fifth war.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> At the very least, from the perspective of the World there was no real emergency to get involved.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> During the fourth war, the Einzberns&#39; research results were behind by one whole generation. When they finally completed their research during the fifth war, they made a mistake in their strategy.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> To be honest, I&#39;m surprised to see that this time the Einzberns managed to call checkmate on everyone.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> So to sum things up, this Singularity is basically...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...the embodiment of the \u201Cif\u201D situation where the Einzberns are the superior contestant in this war.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> Yes, and the Holy Grail reading that Chaldea picked up was most likely Irisviel&#39;s magical circuits themselves...</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> Seeing how perfect the results of the Einzberns&#39; research are this time, you can probably even call her a pseudo Holy Grail.</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong><br> I&#39;m not sure whether or not you&#39;re praising me or insulting me, but I&#39;m going to need you to explain more.</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong><br> What do you mean the world will end if the Fuyuki Holy Grail is completed?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> Yes, allow me to tell you everything. Agent of the Counter Force, you should follow along, as well.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> I&#39;ll show you an even better way to accomplish the task you have been given.</p><p><strong>Assassin?:</strong><br> A simpler and even more certain way than destroying this homunculus here?</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> Well, I can&#39;t say that it&#39;s entirely simpler, but let me ask you something instead, Heroic Spirit.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> Would you do anything because it&#39;s the simpler way?<br> Do you wish to kill Irisviel here, no matter what happens?</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> ...Fou?</p><p><strong>Assassin?:</strong><br> ...I do not know. I have not thought of that. I had resigned myself to thinking there was no other choice. I did not have the luxury of options.</p><p><strong>Assassin?:</strong><br> And now that you&#39;re telling me to choose... I am faced with a conflict within myself that is rather difficult to explain.</p><p><strong>Assassin?:</strong><br> If you&#39;re telling me there is a different choice with this homunculus...then I think I would like to explore that as well.</p><p><strong>Assassin?:</strong><br> I wonder why? I&#39;ve never experienced this feeling before.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> That&#39;s because you still have a human heart left in you.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> A foolish but noble soul, from before you became part of the machine known as the Counter Force.</p><h2 id="act-15-to-the-greater-grail" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#act-15-to-the-greater-grail" aria-hidden="true">#</a> ACT-15: &quot;To the Greater Grail&quot;</h2><p><strong>Matou Kariya:</strong><br> ...And so, that&#39;s how I became Berserker&#39;s Master.</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong><br> Hmm.

What?</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong><br> Unfortunately, it seems the mastermind is out.</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong><br> Well, I burned all the bugs in that basement to a crisp, so let&#39;s call it a day for now. By the way, I brought this girl here with me.</p><p><strong>Matou Kariya:</strong><br> S-Sakura?!<br> You...saved her?</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong><br> Don&#39;t be stupid. I&#39;m not a savior.

You decide.</p><p><strong>Matou Kariya:</strong><br> Sakura...</p><p><strong>Matou Kariya:</strong><br> ...Okay. Take my right hand.</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong><br> Got it. Then clench your teeth hard and endure it.</p><p><strong>Matou Kariya:</strong><br> Gah...</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong><br> Good. It seems the crest worms came along with the hand. I&#39;m sure they&#39;d pick the Command Spells over their host.</p><p><strong>Waver:</strong><br> W-Will...he be okay?</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong><br> The rest is up to fate, though his chances are low.<br> Kid, take care of him as much as you can.</p><p><strong>Waver:</strong><br> I-I am not that good with healing spells!</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong><br> Hey, Mithrenes!</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong><br> This girl and half-dead boy here. Take them out of Fuyuki, find a building with a red cross on it, carry them there, and return.</p><p><strong>Waver:</strong><br> ...Is that the kind of job you would ask a Heroic Spirit to do?</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong><br> You&#39;re the one who had me get water from a river, and you want to say that?</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong><br> Well, there is no other course.<br> We must hurry and head to the next battle.</p><p><strong>Waver:</strong><br> The next?

You&#39;re upset you&#39;ve been betrayed too, huh? You&#39;re just like me. I just can&#39;t let this go.</p><p><strong>Zouken:</strong><br> Guess we&#39;ll just have to show them...what happens to savages who oppose the Matou family.</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong><br> I can&#39;t believe it... The Greater Grail is tainted by an Anti-Hero!?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> Seeing is believing. It&#39;s faster to just have you see the real thing.</p><p><strong>Assassin?:</strong><br> The dismantling of the Greater Grail... If you knew a way to solve the problem at its root, why didn&#39;t you do it?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> Well... This is kind of like taking out nitroglycerin from a huge vat.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> If you&#39;re not careful, the container will break and it could spell disaster. In order to do it safely, you need preparations.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> It couldn&#39;t just happen over a night or two.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> And yet now, you&#39;re just riding in here without any preparations...</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> I reconsidered my methodology.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> If we have enough firepower to blow away our vat along with its explosive contents, it&#39;s possible things would go our way.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> Based on a quick estimate, in addition to us from Chaldea, if we can get at least three more Servants...</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> We could do what we needed to.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Oh, but if we could unify the three factions...</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> Yes, only four Servants would end up defeated, achieving our goal and resolving the issue at hand in a peaceful way.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Foou.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> Had we won over Rider&#39;s faction, we wouldn&#39;t have needed to deal with the Greater Grail.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> So we&#39;ve excluded the possibility of dismantling the Greater Grail this time, but...</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> I didn&#39;t think the Counter Force would become involved. There couldn&#39;t be a better ally if we had him on our side.</p><p><strong>Assassin?:</strong><br> No matter when or where we&#39;re called for battle, we will always shed blood for purposes beyond human intellect.</p><p><strong>Assassin?:</strong><br> It is not unusual for us to find ourselves against everyone, without being understood by a single person.</p><p><strong>Assassin?:</strong><br> ...So this is a strange feeling. It&#39;s been a long time since I&#39;ve worked with someone...Huh?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> Yes, they were caught in my Bounded Field as well. As I thought. I guess Presence Concealment doesn&#39;t work against a better Assassin.</p><p><strong>Assassin?:</strong><br> I&#39;m also good at lurking in the shadows. Both of us are aware of what the other is capable of.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...An Assassin Servant!? You two are amazing.<br> I couldn&#39;t tell at all!</p><p><strong>Assassin:</strong><br> How dare you... Don&#39;t think you&#39;re going to win just because you prevented my first strike! I&#39;m going to get you all this time!</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> Watch out. They&#39;re different than the fragments we&#39;ve dealt with up until now.

Now that we are here, it&#39;s obvious that the magical energy radiating from the Greater Grail has been altered.</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong><br> ...Yes. Unfortunately.

The preparations for the feast are far from complete!</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong><br> Justeaze Lizrich... No, it&#39;s a ruined Holy Grail, polluted by All the Evils of the World.</p><p><strong>Dark Irisviel:</strong><br> Humph. What a foolish remark from my descendant. I am the Chalice of Heaven. The incarnation of the Third Magic who shall reach the Root and annihilate all evil.</p><p><strong>Dark Irisviel:</strong><br> It&#39;s time. Pledge me your lives and souls! I will draw upon your blood to fulfill the cherished wish of 1,000 years!</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> Saber, she is...</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> Yes, this magical energy&#39;s density...<br> At this rate we have no chance of victory!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I see... Since we lost Zhuge Liang\u2013I mean, Lord El-Melloi II\u2013we can no longer fight...</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> Were he safe, we may have stood a chance.<br> But the absence of one Servant is critical!</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> Especially against an enemy of this stature, his loss is devastating. We must retreat!</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> The two of us will hold her off while we evacuate the Masters and the others. Lancer, you with me!?</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> Yes!</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong><br> But Saber!<br> What will become of you?</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> As long as the Master flees to safety, we can immediately withdraw from the front lines via Command Spells.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> But, since you hold the Command Spells, everything hinges on your safety! Now, go!</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> Heroic Spirit of the Shield! Assassin of the Counter Force! Please protect the Master!</p><p><strong>Assassin?:</strong><br> Yes, leave it to me.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Y-Yes, I will!</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> ...Ah!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I&#39;m so glad you regained consciousness!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Foou?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> Ugh... My Spirit Core is undamaged, but I can&#39;t move my body... I guess a Pseudo-Servant has its limits...</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> ...What about Saber and Lancer?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> They&#39;re fighting the Greater Grail.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> Ugh! In order to let us retreat?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes. They said we had no chance of winning at the time...</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> No! Even if we run, we don&#39;t have any reserve forces! We must stand our ground and fight!</p><p><strong>Waver:</strong><br> So what do we do!? You yourself have no strength left to stand with us!</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> Waver Velvet, you&#39;re the key here.</p><p><strong>Waver:</strong><br> ...Huh?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> I know who you are, you brat.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> You find your powerlessness repugnant. You despise your incompetency and mediocrity. You are mired in an inferiority complex, with nothing to boast of to the world.</p><p><strong>Waver:</strong><br> W-What&#39;s up with you? Don&#39;t tell me...</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> The immature dream of a brat who always laments his own weakness... Are you prepared to finally wake up?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> The terror of wielding overwhelming power. The terror that heavy responsibility imposes. Will you taste these sensations while you are still just a brat?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Lord El-Melloi, what are you doing!?</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou!?</p><p><strong>Waver:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Waver:</strong><br> Fine. I&#39;m ready. We have no other choice, right?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> Hah, you truly are a fool. A fool who doesn&#39;t know his place. You truly understand nothing at all.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> But, that&#39;s exactly why...he once took a particular interest in you...</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> Glory lies beyond the horizon... Huh?</p><p><strong>Waver:</strong><br> Tell me! What am I supposed to do?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> Take my hand and pray. \u201CThe art of certain victory, the mode of harmonizing with charges, is a matter of opportunity.\u201D</p><p><strong>Waver:</strong><br> Umm... The art of certain victory...the mode of harmonizing with charges...is a matter of opportunity.</p><p><strong>Waver:</strong><br> Ah! Whoa!</p><p><strong>Waver:</strong><br> What&#39;s this? What&#39;s happening to me...</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> Yes, it seems you&#39;ve gained the strategist&#39;s favor.<br> He permits you to be his temporary avatar.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> Instead of my broken body, he can boss you around as much as he wants.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Foou!</p><p><strong>Waver:</strong><br> I can tell...there&#39;s something inside of me... Zhuge Liang... Whaaaaat!?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> Rejoice, young man. You are the hero you always dreamed of being. Now, can you do your new form justice?</p><p><strong>Waver:</strong><br> ...Yeah, I can! I can do this!</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> Fujimaru, sorry, but I&#39;m entrusting you with this immature Pseudo-Servant.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> He&#39;s a little unreliable, but he&#39;ll be of use.<br> Go back and aid Saber and Lancer!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Okay!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Leave it to me!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> We need to hurry, Senpai, while Saber and Lancer are still alive!</p><p><strong>Dark Irisviel:</strong><br> Hah hah, is this the best you can do? Pathetic Heroic Spirits. It&#39;s like you remained solely to nourish me.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> Ugh...this isn&#39;t good. I&#39;m nearing my limit...</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> She&#39;s stronger than I imagined!<br> At this rate...</p><p><strong>Waver:</strong><br> Hold on a bit longer and push through!</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> What!? Why did you return!?</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> No, Lancer, the boy is different from before...<br> This magical energy... He is clearly a Servant!</p><p><strong>Waver:</strong><br> We&#39;ve returned to our former strength. We have Saber, Lancer, and the Counter Force Assassin...</p><p><strong>Waver:</strong><br> The lineup he envisioned is assembled!<br> All we need now is orders, Fujimaru!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> This will be the final battle!</p><p><strong>Dark Irisviel:</strong><br> Foolishness... I&#39;ll devour every one of you.<br> Return to your origins within my chalice!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Dark Irisviel:</strong><br> Why... This hand...was meant to reach the ends of the stars...</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> Did we...win?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The enemy&#39;s magical energy has disappeared...<br> Victory is ours!</p><p><strong>Waver:</strong><br> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Good job!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Are you okay?</p><p><strong>Waver:</strong><br> I...I had no idea!</p><p><strong>Waver:</strong><br> I never knew that fighting for one&#39;s life...was this terrifying...</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> You did well. Very well for one&#39;s first battle.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> You deserve praise for not freezing in terror.<br> Be proud and bask in the glory of your victory.</p><p><strong>Waver:</strong><br> Everyone...</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong><br> They&#39;re all Heroic Spirits summoned to Fuyuki by the Greater Grail. Now that it&#39;s gone, they can&#39;t retain their form...</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> It is time to part ways. It was a taxing battle, but I am glad it ended well.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> May we meet on another battlefield. I am sure it will happen when the fate of the world is at stake.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Foou...</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> The Holy Grail that we detected from Chaldea has disappeared without a trace.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> Also, Irisviel. You no longer have the ability to transform into the Holy Grail. What do you intend to do now?</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong><br> Yes. Now that the Holy Grail War has been rendered meaningless, my existence is of no value.</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong><br> I helped to destroy the Greater Grail with my own hands. There&#39;s no way that I can return to Einzbern now...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Umm, our original goal included recovering the Holy Grail that appeared in this Singularity.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> If you like, why not return with us to Chaldea?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Yeah. If we abandon her, someone else might try to use her later for more sinister purposes.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> It&#39;s probably best for us to take her under our wing.</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong><br> ...For someone with no one left to turn to, it&#39;s a generous offer.</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong><br> Yes, I accept. I entrust myself to you all. Master from another world, let&#39;s work for a better future.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Yes, thank you.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> We welcome you!</p><p><strong>Waver:</strong><br> Are you guys...returning, too?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> Yes. Zhuge Liang as well. Relax.<br> You&#39;ll soon return to your ordinary, mediocre self.</p><p><strong>Waver:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Waver:</strong><br> You were right. This power is still a bit too much for me.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> Now that you know that, it is time to continue your studies.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> Someday, you will be forced to bear this power.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> Be consoled by the fact that you still have time.<br> Become strong while you still can.</p><p><strong>Waver:</strong><br> You sound just like Rider.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> Humph, don&#39;t embarrass me. I am still no match for the King of Conquerors.</p><p><strong>Waver:</strong><br> \u201CStill,\u201D you say? Does that mean you&#39;re also training?<br> To eventually be his equal?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> The route to the surface is a labyrinth of caves, so I&#39;ll take you there. Then we part ways.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou, foou.</p><p><strong>Assassin?:</strong><br> I guess I should say goodbye as well.</p><p><strong>Waver:</strong><br> You&#39;re not returning to the surface?</p><p><strong>Assassin?:</strong><br> I don&#39;t originally belong to this world, so it&#39;s a waste of time. If I wait, I&#39;ll soon be summoned back to the Throne.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong><br> That&#39;s right, I forgot what type of being you were.</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Assassin?:</strong><br> ...It&#39;s strange. After we met, I had the feeling that only death would separate us.</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong><br> Yes, it&#39;s weird, but I don&#39;t know why.<br> Yet...this strange feeling is not unpleasant.</p><p><strong>Assassin?:</strong><br> Yeah. Same here...</p><p><strong>Assassin?:</strong><br> ...I thought I was cursed to fulfill my mission only through sacrifice or death.</p><p><strong>Assassin?:</strong><br> Now, for the first time, I feel like I was able to fight to protect something.</p><p><strong>Assassin?:</strong><br> Thank you. ...Although I don&#39;t know whether it&#39;s my place to say such words.</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong><br> Yes. Goodbye. I&#39;m glad I could meet you, nameless Heroic Spirit.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Good work! You went through a lot this time.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Foou, foou.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Da Vinci is now giving Miss Irisviel a thorough checkup.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I&#39;m surprised. I never thought a Holy Grail could exist in such a form.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> What about Lord El-Melloi?<br> How are his injuries?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Compared to a genuine Servant, Servants like us who possess the flesh of human beings</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> will die if they suffer too much damage...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Yes. He&#39;ll be in the ICU for a while.<br> He needs complete rest.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> How reckless to have someone else form a contract with a Heroic Spirit while seriously injured.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> He was nonchalant so you wouldn&#39;t be alarmed, but he was actually in really bad shape.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Foou.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> But, thanks to him, we somehow pulled through... Also, the Heroic Spirit who was an agent of the Counter Force...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Right. What a strange encounter. To think that even after humanity&#39;s history has been incinerated, the Counter Force would still function.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> What is this \u201CCounter Force\u201D?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> What was he, exactly?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> The Counter Force...in theory, it&#39;s a force that acts to preserve the human race.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> It&#39;s said that people who accomplished rare feats of valor in life are summoned by this Counter Force.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> If a crisis threatens the human race, they are summoned through time and space to eliminate the source of the calamity.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> So they are Servants who have no Masters, summoned solely to fight?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Yes. Even in death, their souls are tasked with a mission to fight for all eternity.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I cannot possibly understand their feelings...<br> They must endure unspeakable anguish.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Yes. Although I&#39;m a mere Demi-Servant and not a Heroic Spirit,</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I cannot imagine being summoned to battle without a Master.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Really?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes. What supports me in battle is you, Senpai, the one I sealed a contract with.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That bond gives me the strength and courage to overcome fear. To fight without such support would be too cruel.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Foou...</p><p><strong>Assassin?:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Assassin?:</strong><br> Will you come out already? You&#39;re the star performer.<br> No one will interfere now.</p><p><strong>E\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Humph! So you knew.<br> I don&#39;t want to! What a pain.</p><p><strong>E\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Isn&#39;t conserving energy popular in this age?<br> I wanted to catch you off your guard.</p><p><strong>E\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Well, good job picking up on me instead.<br> I appreciate the welcome. Less lonely.</p><p><strong>E\uFF1A???:</strong><br> But why didn&#39;t you warn your friends of the danger?</p><p><strong>E\uFF1A???:</strong><br> They only destroyed a contaminated Holy Grail.</p><p><strong>E\uFF1A???:</strong><br> I, A\u014Bra Mainiiu, its contents, remain separate.</p><p><strong>Assassin?:</strong><br> I didn&#39;t want to rely on the help of others intervening from another world.</p><p><strong>Assassin?:</strong><br> Your curse belongs solely to this world. It does not extend to theirs. It&#39;s logical for me to deal with you alone.</p><p><strong>A\u014Bra Mainiiu:</strong><br> Oh, how nice. It&#39;s a fine thing to take pride in one&#39;s work.</p><p><strong>A\u014Bra Mainiiu:</strong><br> I guess it would be painful for us to be pitied when we fight. No one would gain anything.</p><p><strong>A\u014Bra Mainiiu:</strong><br> Happiness is everything, right?<br> Well, anyway\u2014</p><p><strong>A\u014Bra Mainiiu:</strong><br> ...In that sense, you&#39;re just as much on the losing side as I am.</p><p><strong>A\u014Bra Mainiiu:</strong><br> I know you&#39;re a mass murderer by your scent.</p><p><strong>A\u014Bra Mainiiu:</strong><br> I bet you&#39;ll come \u201Chere\u201D in the end.<br> After you&#39;re worn out by an eternity of abuse.</p><p><strong>Assassin?:</strong><br> I don&#39;t think so. This is the fate I have chosen.<br> I was never compelled to, nor did I ever give in.</p><p><strong>A\u014Bra Mainiiu:</strong><br> That&#39;s precisely why. You should have broken down somewhere along the line. That way you would have had a chance at peace, even salvation.</p><p><strong>A\u014Bra Mainiiu:</strong><br> But because you couldn&#39;t stop being a \u201CHero of Justice\u201D until the very end, even after death, you became a cogwheel in a mechanism like the Counter Force.</p><p><strong>A\u014Bra Mainiiu:</strong><br> Surely that&#39;s proof you&#39;re on the losing side.</p><p><strong>Assassin?:</strong><br> My life led me to this point. I have no regrets.<br> I do admit that we&#39;re fundamentally similar.</p><p><strong>Assassin?:</strong><br> You&#39;ll curse the world, and I&#39;ll save it.<br> We are both devices with assigned roles. That&#39;s all.</p><p><strong>A\u014Bra Mainiiu:</strong><br> \u2014<br> (Grin)</p><p><strong>A\u014Bra Mainiiu:</strong><br> Okay. If you&#39;re so sure, I guess I have to show you my respect.</p><p><strong>A\u014Bra Mainiiu:</strong><br> If curses and salvation face each other, there is no choice. We must both seek love and recognition in the way we know best.</p><p><strong>A\u014Bra Mainiiu:</strong><br> For such an occasion, why don&#39;t you name yourself? Unlike me, you remember your own name, yeah?</p><p><strong>G\uFF1AEmiya Kiritsugu:</strong><br> Emiya... Kiritsugu. Or so I was called when I lived as a human being.</p><p><strong>G\uFF1AEmiya Kiritsugu:</strong><br> I will save the world. I did so until now, and I will forever.</p><p><strong>A\u014Bra Mainiiu:</strong><br> There ain&#39;t a world that can be saved by humans.<br> How long will you try to disprove that conclusion!</p><h2 id="act-ex-retrieving-the-holy-grail" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#act-ex-retrieving-the-holy-grail" aria-hidden="true">#</a> ACT-EX: &quot;Retrieving the Holy Grail&quot;</h2><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Senpai?

Standard procedure.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I see... Senpai&#39;s sixth sense...

Hmm, fine curves too...<br> (Rub rub)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Hyahhh!?</p><p><strong>C\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Heh heh. Perks of being injured. Time to recover! Even on the verge of death, a beast&#39;s instincts are uncontrollable!</p><p><strong>C\uFF1A???:</strong><br> You have quite a fine Servant with you!<br> She would give my former Master a run for her money!</p><p><strong>C\uFF1A???:</strong><br> I&#39;m just talking about looks, of course.<br> It&#39;s sad, but both are still mentally children.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> This...is a Perverted Servant!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Mash, give him a good beating.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Y-Yes!

Do you know about Senpai?</p><p><strong>C\uFF1A???:</strong><br> I do. I observed your Master fighting for a bit from the best seat in the house. So, anyway, what?</p><p><strong>C\uFF1A???:</strong><br> It&#39;s your fault that I was lying collapsed on the ground... Would you believe me if I said that?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Our fault?</p><p><strong>The Dress of Heaven:</strong><br> I&#39;ll explain the rest, Avenger.<br> At ease.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Iri!? But that form...</p><p><strong>The Dress of Heaven:</strong><br> Hello, Mash and Fujimaru.<br> Good work.</p><p><strong>The Dress of Heaven:</strong><br> I&#39;m the Dress of Heaven. I&#39;m a different entity than Irisviel, with whom you were working until just a while ago\u2014</p><p><strong>The Dress of Heaven:</strong><br> Simply put, I&#39;m like the spirit of the Greater Grail.</p><p><strong>Avenger:</strong><br> That&#39;s right. You people destroyed a woman in black, didn&#39;t you? Think of her as a good version of that.</p><p><strong>The Dress of Heaven:</strong><br> That&#39;s a crude explanation, Avenger.<br> Why can&#39;t you be more classy...</p><p><strong>Avenger:</strong><br> Forgive me. At any rate, you were beating me viciously until just a moment ago. Of course I&#39;m going to harbor a deep grudge.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Iri is the one who beat that man in black to within an inch of his life?</p><p><strong>The Dress of Heaven:</strong><br> ...Well, I hate to say it, but yes and no.</p><p><strong>The Dress of Heaven:</strong><br> Fujimaru. Listen closely, for this is your group&#39;s problem as well.</p><p><strong>The Dress of Heaven:</strong><br> You destroyed the black Holy Grail. That&#39;s fine.<br> I don&#39;t mind. Even though it was painful.</p><p><strong>The Dress of Heaven:</strong><br> But to be honest, that was a mistake.<br> You shouldn&#39;t have done it.</p><p><strong>The Dress of Heaven:</strong><br> The reason is\u2014</p><p><strong>The Dress of Heaven:</strong><br> The reason is, the way you destroyed it was too lenient!</p><p><strong>The Dress of Heaven:</strong><br> You should&#39;ve done it more thoroughly! For example, you could&#39;ve blown it up together with one floor of a luxury hotel!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Spoken like a rock star!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> ...All right, this is starting to sound familiar.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Um... Iri?<br> What do you mean by that?</p><p><strong>The Dress of Heaven:</strong><br> I&#39;m saying you were too naive. You didn&#39;t completely destroy the black Holy Grail.</p><p><strong>The Dress of Heaven:</strong><br> You broke the vessel in a clumsy manner.<br> As a result, the Lesser Grail...</p><p><strong>The Dress of Heaven:</strong><br> Irisviel was broken into shards and scattered. Each of those shards has begun working independently.</p><p><strong>The Dress of Heaven:</strong><br> They are\u2014<br> Fire Iri, Water Iri, Earth Iri, and Wind Iri!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> The four elements of Irisviel!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> That&#39;s too many.</p><p><strong>Avenger:</strong><br> Exactly. Four of them are too much to handle.<br> I tried to get them to calm down...</p><p><strong>Avenger:</strong><br> ...But I was just wasting my breath, as they attacked me.</p><p><strong>The Dress of Heaven:</strong><br> Yes. Like the original Irisviel, the four split-up elements would be kind under normal circumstances.</p><p><strong>The Dress of Heaven:</strong><br> But Fire Iri, who is particularly extreme, rose up in revolt.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Fire Iri?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Revolt?</p><p><strong>The Dress of Heaven:</strong><br> Yes. And like leaping flames, the other Iris were awakened to their violent side.</p><p><strong>The Dress of Heaven:</strong><br> Sad to say... but even after gaining their freedom and individual personalities, their grudge against you didn&#39;t disappear.</p><p><strong>The Dress of Heaven:</strong><br> Do you understand, Fujimaru?<br> Your war isn&#39;t over yet.</p><p><strong>The Dress of Heaven:</strong><br> Four types of Irisviel, let loose in Fuyuki.<br> You have a responsibility and a duty to defeat them.</p><p><strong>The Dress of Heaven:</strong><br> They&#39;re, how can I put it... Anyway, persistent, immune to discouragement, and obstinate.</p><p><strong>The Dress of Heaven:</strong><br> I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll come back after you beat them.<br> But please stick with them until the job is done.</p><p><strong>The Dress of Heaven:</strong><br> Besides, it looks like that gloomy, yet shy, sensitive, and handsome man... Ahem. I mean, the hooded assassin has gone back.</p><p><strong>The Dress of Heaven:</strong><br> In the first place, that man isn&#39;t suited for this kind of job, right?</p><p><strong>The Dress of Heaven:</strong><br> I&#39;m asking you as a favor, on behalf of Avenger.</p><p><strong>The Dress of Heaven:</strong><br> Assassin... Save the city of Fuyuki instead of him.<br> Only you people can do this job.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Sure. Leave it to us.</p><p><strong>The Dress of Heaven:</strong><br> Thank you. I was hoping for that answer, cute Master\u2661</p><p><strong>Avenger:</strong><br> Are we done talking? Then I&#39;m counting on you folks to take care of the rest.</p><p><strong>Avenger:</strong><br> I&#39;m not suited for fighting and I hear that woman in white doesn&#39;t want to see me, undisciplined as I am.</p><p><strong>Avenger:</strong><br> From here on out, this is your domain. Teach those fragments of the Holy Grail a lesson to the very end.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> That dress is lovely.</p><p><strong>The Dress of Heaven:</strong><br> (Blush) Th-This is Einzbern&#39;s formal wear. I mean...</p><p><strong>The Dress of Heaven:</strong><br> It&#39;s a dress for magical rituals!
