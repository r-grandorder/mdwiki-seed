Her poems were included in dozens of imperial-commissioned anthologies, starting with the Goshuui Wakashuu.<br> Among the many theories about what her true name was, the most prominent one is that she was Fujiwara no Kaoruko (but being the most prominent theory doesn\u2019t necessarily means the theorist have any evidence).</p><p>She was born the daughter of Fujiwara no Tametoki, a Sinologist and poet.<br> She was still a child when she lost her mother.<br> She took a relatively long time to get married.<br> Her father\u2019s family was famed as a lineage of people of culture (her paternal great-grandfather, Fujiwara no Kanesuke, was not only an active poet, but also the author of many works, including the first and last volumes of the Shoutoku Taishi Denryaku, under the pseudonym of Tsutsumichuu Nagon), so Kaoruko was expected to, likewise, be raised close to prose and poetry.<br> In her twenties, she marries Yamashiro no Kami no Emonnosuke no Fujiwara no Nobutaka and bears one child before her husband Nobutaka, over 20 years older than her, passes away 3 years after the wedding.<br> On the spring of the year when she became a young widow, Kaoruko started writing a tale. That is the one and only The Tale of Genji, a lengthy story completed in 54 volumes.</p><p>This story was already acclaimed by many (including Emperor Ichijou) while it was still ongoing, and kept receiving high praise after its conclusion. The loves of Genji\u2019s life became the theme of numerous poems composed at the end of the Heian Era, and those kind of poems can still be found even to this day.</p><p>Despite the fact she made history by composing a long-running masterpiece, writing was not her profession. In the year 1005, she was working as a lady-in-waiting for Emperor Ichijou\u2019s second empress, Shoushi (the daughter of Fujiwara no Michinaga).<br> Which means she a kind of government worker writing as a side job.<br> By the way, the name Murasaki Shikibu apparently started as her nickname on her work office.</p><p>It\u2019s said that Kaoruko firmly refused to the prestigious offer to serve the second empress because she wanted to fully dedicate herself to writing The Tale of Genji.<br> But she ultimately accepted it\u2026<br> Coming to service, she was met with a harsh work environment, always ignored and backbitten by her fellow ladies-in-waiting, who were always on guard against \u201Ceggheads from the capital\u201D. Baffled by the situation, Kaoruko sends a letter to the ladies-in-waiting proposing a peaceful reconciliation, but as this fell in deaf ears, she became a shut-in for a period of 5 months.<br> Having regained her composure after diligently writing The Tale of Genji, Kaoruko later resumes her work serving the second empress and avoids attacks from her coworkers by acting the character of a natural airhead, successfully blending in into the inner palace\u2019s community.</p><h2 id="character-in-fgo" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#character-in-fgo" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Character in FGO</h2><p>Discreet, well-mannered and studious.<br> The feelings she keeps to herself are ardent, and if she were to put them to paper, she create another long runner.</p><p>Kaoruko, later Murasaki Shikibu, had a close relationship with books and poems since childhood, but she also held interesting the Heian Era\u2019s latest natural science: Onmyoudou. She made one request to her father Tametoki.<br> \u201CFather, I want to\u2026\u201D<br> Learn Onmyoudou.<br> That\u2019s the origin story of the Onmyou Girl Kaoruko.<br> Wait, that\u2019s not how it happened.<br> Kaoruko learned from the Abe no Seimei, the greatest and most powerful sorcerer of his time and administrator of the Bureau of Onmyou, but her Onmyou talents never blossomed and she only managed very minimal access to the Mystery of Onmyoudou (a level within the limits of modern Magecraft). At least it wasn&#39;t zero.</p><p>Kaoruko\u2019s true talent blossomed after her husband\u2019s death.<br> Her talent as a writer and poet.<br> The fact she was included among the Medieval 36 Immortal Poets and the 36 Immortal Lady Poets and delivered The Tale of Genji, a story still widely remembered to this day, is unquestionable proof of her talent as a poet and dramatist.</p><p>Heian\u2019s top tier Super Intellectual Lady.<br> History was accurate in describing her poor relationship with her coworkers and this left her with a general anxiety that survived the eras, but as Servant, not as many (alas, it wasn&#39;t zero) people make her feel that.<br> She\u2019s just sensitive to the subtleties of the heart.<br> She immediately notices when a person is anxious or concerned and offers help.</p><p>Physical publications, books made of paper\u2026<br> She serves as the librarian to a varied collection of books.</p><p>More specifically, she used her own magecraft (curses) to convert publications recorded as digital data into books made of paper and quietly constructed her library deep underground.<br> As its only manager, librarian and proprietress, she protects her dark and chilled book paradise.<br> She could teach how to write diaries and letters if asked.</p><p>By taking only one look at someone, she can find a book that suits them.<br> Most of them tend to be romantic tragedies, revenge tragedies, and other books relatively heavily associated with feelings.<br> Because she is a Heroic Spirit who composes feelings, of course.<br> \u201CI am a Heroic Spirit who composes feelings.

He couldn\u2019t have made a better choice, as Emperor Ichijou would frequently visit Shoushi\u2019s chambers to try to ask what would happen in the future chapters of The Tale of Genji, and thanks to that, in 1008, Shoushi gave birth to Prince Atsuhira, later turned Emperor Goichijou.<br> The Diary of Lady Murasaki mentions one night where he visited her bedroom, and the genealogy book Sonpi Bunmyaku lists Murasaki Shikibu and Michinaga as lovers.<br> When asked about how things really were with Michinaga, she refuses to comment.<br> \u201CNo comments about Minister Michinaga.\u201D</p><p><strong>Minamoto no Raikou:</strong></p><p>A person she would often see in the capital back when she was alive.<br> The leader of the Minamoto Family, who served Fujiwara no Kaneie, then his son Michinaga, then Michinaga\u2019s son Yorimichi.<br> They weren\u2019t really friends, but she would often her stories about how Raikou was so mighty as a warrior that the people would even forget she was a woman (despite how gorgeous as a woman she is!).<br> They actually only had one single conversation during their court days.<br> \u201CYorimitsu, a warrior most gorgeous, graceful, and only slightly scary.\u201D</p><p><strong>Sei Shounagon:</strong></p><p>A fellow lady-in-waiting slightly older and more experienced than her.<br> She served Teishi, one of Second Empress Shoushi\u2019s rivals.<br> In The Diary of Lady Murasaki, she wrote the quote below.

She thought herself so clever and littered her writing with Chinese characters; but if you examined them closely, they left a great deal to be desired. Those who think of themselves of being superior to everyone else in this way will inevitably suffer and come to a bad end. One who is too richly gifted, who indulges too much in emotion even when she ought to be reserved, and cannot turn aside from anything she of her interest will lose self-control. How can such a vain and reckless person end her days happily?\u201D<br> She\u2019s ridiculously conscious of their rivalry\u2026!<br> By the way, it\u2019s highly speculated that they never met each other in person.</p><p><strong>Izumi Shikibu:</strong></p><p>A younger poet woman.<br> Like Murasaki Shikibu, she was a member of the Medieval 36 Immortal Poets and the 36 Immortal Lady Poets.<br> A young playgirl.

The twelve-layered kimono on the third Ascension was too large to fit the card frame, so I\u2019m glad you have this book where you can you appreciate the twelve layers on their full glory.
