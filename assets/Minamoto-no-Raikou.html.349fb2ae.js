Oh man, that simulation today totally kicked ass!</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Not as cool as the real Rayshifts though...<br> Riding the Golden Bear into the winds...</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Well, can&#39;t complain much. Mash and Doc, thanks for your help!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Oh, not a problem. Just let me know whenever you want to run a battle simulation again.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I can do it between system adjustments, and Fujimaru can gain combat experience too.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I can learn a lot from these simulations as well.<br> Thank you very much, Kintoki.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Fighting Gazers and ultra-large ghosts back to back...<br> It was a good training for me to practice my defense.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> It was golden today, too!</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Right! Hit me up again sometime, Boss!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Maybe we stayed up too late doing this?</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Damn, you&#39;re right. I didn&#39;t known the sun has gone down already. It&#39;s pretty late now.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> I mean, you can&#39;t see outside from here. And you can only pick day or night on the simulator thing.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Sorry about that. Circumstances prevent us from expending too many resources.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> No prob. Losing yourself in a fight is a man&#39;s joy.<br> Getting home late isn&#39;t anything to get mad about.</p><hr><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> ...Oh, you two. As your mother, your actions are making me sad.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Not just Kintoki, but Fujimaru, as well... What were you doing, wandering around at this hour?</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Swinging swords and axes about, running around the countryside until you forget the time, no doubt...?</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> I won&#39;t blame you for being energetic and naughty... Why? Because I love you. Yes, I love you very much!</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> I think you two are so adorable I just want to squeeze you. I mean it... Like this\u2661</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Hey, quit getting smoochy all the time!<br> I ain&#39;t a kid anymore, Boss Raikou!</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Oh, what are you saying?<br> You&#39;re still just a big kid.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> You coming home this late without telling me proves it... Do you understand why I&#39;m sad?</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Um, well... Because I kept Boss Fujimaru running around?</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> I am kinda sorry for battling all day.<br> I mean, I do feel bad for coming back this late...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Forgive us, Raikou. The battle simulation dragged on a little too long...</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> You&#39;ve done nothing wrong, Mash.<br> Please pay it no mind.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Kintoki was probably so caught up in it that you didn&#39;t want to mention the time, right?</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> It&#39;s always this way. Kintoki with his likable smile, leading friends down the path of dallying.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> The most diligent person will nod unquestioningly and end up carousing and rabble-rousing all night...</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Kintoki is free to cause himself harm, but a samurai should never cause trouble to others.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> As the one responsible for his education, it always pains my heart when he does so...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> His mother knows him so well...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> (Yes, Senpai. Is this what you&#39;d call the embodiment of motherhood?)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Wait, does this lead to a golden lecture?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> (Y-Yes, I have a feeling it does...!)</p><hr><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Kintoki, do you understand why I&#39;m saying all this?<br> You do, don&#39;t you? Don&#39;t you?</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> (Yeah, what&#39;s the big deal? I got home before midnight.<br> I swear to the Thunder God, I didn&#39;t do nothin&#39; bad.)</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Kintoki!</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Yikes! Uh... Well... You see... It&#39;s not like I don&#39;t understand... I&#39;m sorry, I guess...</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> V-Very sorry, I guess...</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> ...Kintoki, can you look me in the eye and say it?</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> ...Sorry. I mean it. For missing dinner...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Now I get it!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> That&#39;s what she&#39;s so mad about!</p><hr><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> I totally forgot. That&#39;s right, today it was your turn to cook.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Come to think of it, Raikou was in the kitchen with Emiya and Boudica.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I had no idea.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I help out in there too, when I have the time.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> For those dear to you, capture their stomachs first, hearts second... this is such a useful class!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> They&#39;re THE moms of this place...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes, you may be right.</p><hr><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Do you understand, Kintoki? Fujimaru?</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> I am not angry about the fact that you did not eat the food I cooked.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Of course I&#39;m angry, just a bit. I only broke about three cutting boards, so you can relax.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Oh, um, I didn&#39;t mean that...</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> It&#39;s just, I so carefully made the things you like, so carefully with much effort and love,</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> and I was so looking forward to you enjoying it, and telling me...how good...it tasted...</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> ...and then, to be treated so cruelly... (Sniff)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Crying! She&#39;s crying! Kintoki, you made her cry!</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> I didn&#39;t make her cry!<br> Besides, you&#39;re guilty too, Boss!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Oh, boy...</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> H-Hey, say something nice to her, Boss...<br> I&#39;m terrible at this stuff when she gets like this...</p><hr><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> (Sniff) Be silent.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> It&#39;s cruel, honestly... This means both of you habitually forget about eating meals, don&#39;t you?</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Rayshift this, simulator that...</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Ember this, Ascension materials that...<br> Tearing around on the disciplined Bear...</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Are you not aware that you are one of my Four Heavenly Kings and my Master? Why can&#39;t you just compose yourselves?</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Well? Look at me in the eyes and answer my questions.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> We&#39;re sorry!</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Whoa, a full-on bow!?<br> That&#39;s one hell of an apology, Boss! Bravery!</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> I&#39;m just as sorry, Raikou. It was my bad.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> ...Today was just an accident.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Hey, hey, Master, hold on... Now I&#39;m the only one makin&#39; an apology!</p><hr><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> ...For heaven&#39;s sake.<br> You&#39;re both still such children.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Playing hard is fine under these circumstances.<br> But, in return, eat well and sleep well. Understood?</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> C-come on, I said I&#39;m not a little kid...</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> NO.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> No, a mother mustn&#39;t neglect her child&#39;s health.<br> Kintoki, it seems I need to make it extra clear to you.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> So, why don&#39;t I stay by your bedside tonight telling you until you fall asleep.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Of the knowledge you must have as my child. Of what you must always obey. And just how precious you are to your mother, to me!</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Oh, I know all that stuff already. Heard it so many times, it&#39;s in one ear and out the other.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> You know what, I&#39;m already drained from all the training today. I&#39;ll hear you out tomorrow, so just let me go today!</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> How could you... Your mother so wishes to speak to you for the first time in a while...</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Do you hate me, Kintoki...? (Sniff)</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Tell me, Kintoki...<br> Where am I failing as a mother?</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Perhaps the reason you didn&#39;t eat the rice balls that I made...was because you hated your mother so...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> See, Kintoki. You made her cry again...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> That&#39;s definitely a delinquent son...</p><hr><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Are you on her side now, Boss!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That&#39;s right... Not only did Raikou make dinner, she golden waited for Kintoki...</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Yes... That&#39;s right... (Sniff)</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> All right! All right!<br> Lecture me all night if you want!</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> ...!</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Really, Kintoki! Mother is so happy! Then, I&#39;ll prepare lots of midnight snacks before giving you a lecture.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> ...Wow, seriously?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Amazing. A man of unrivaled power who rides the Bear can be treated like a little kid.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I&#39;d heard Raikou was like a parent to Kintoki, it looks like it&#39;s true.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Even heroes are nothing before their mothers.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Mothers are distinguished.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I feel like I&#39;m back home.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes, Senpai.<br> It&#39;s a rather heartwarming scene.</p><hr><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Oh, Fujimaru.<br> Why are you talking like an outsider?</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Once Kintoki&#39;s gone to bed, it&#39;ll be your turn, of course.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Wait in your room and don&#39;t fall asleep.<br> Am I clear?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Y-Yes.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Hee hee, very well. Until later, then.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I knew it&#39;d turn out like this.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Of course it would. Then, until later.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Oh... Story time with your mother as you go to sleep...<br> An ancient Japanese education style!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> How the elderly have spare ti\u2013 I mean, a sense of duty.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> It&#39;s not just Kintoki. She considers Fujimaru to be her child as well.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> ...Are you still awake?</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Ah, good. I&#39;m sorry. It took time getting Kintoki to bed.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> He kept begging me to get out, and it made me sad... Tears welled in my eyes...</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Actually, I may have shed a few...</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> In the end, he understood his mother&#39;s feelings.<br> I&#39;m sure he&#39;ll be a good boy.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I&#39;m glad to hear that.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Yes. Now, you&#39;re next.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Well, good night.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Oh I don&#39;t think so.<br> Hee hee, I just got here.</p><hr><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> You can stay lying down in bed.<br> I&#39;ll just sit here... Yes, right at your bedside.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Oh... Is this the first time you&#39;re being put to sleep?</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> When he was a child, I&#39;d do this for Kintoki. It&#39;s a distant, nostalgic memory, and yet here we are again.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> It&#39;s a cherished goal of elders to watch everyone grow. Although tonight, I&#39;ve come to lecture you as well.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> I don&#39;t like having to scold you for naughty behavior. Please understand that.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> However, there will always be someone caring about you, worrying about you.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> I just want you to know that.<br> Think of that person, and don&#39;t make them sad.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...You mean you?</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Hee hee, is it me?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Mash, Dr. Roman and the Servants?</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Hee hee hee...</p><hr><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> ...Oh I know, let me tell you a little story.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Being naughty doesn&#39;t matter.<br> Having an excess of energy is also adorable.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> However, if you think only of yourself, and end up disregarding others...</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> You&#39;ll surely make someone sad.<br> And sometimes, blood gets spilled over it.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> For example...</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Yes, once upon a time... there was a girl.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> A heaven-sent girl born to the gods Kitano-Tenjin and Gozu-Tenno.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> After staying in her mother&#39;s womb for 3 years and 3 months, she was born in the year, day, and hour of the Ox.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> The girl, named Ushi Gozen, was born with fangs, long hair, and eyes that shone like the morning sun.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> In other words, an oni&#39;s child had been born in the capital.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Ushi Gozen...</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Oni&#39;s child?</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> That was what they called children born with odd appearances in ancient Japan.</p><hr><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Since she&#39;s an oni&#39;s child and not regarded as a human, her father, a samurai, ordered people to have her killed...</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> But her mother took pity, and left her at a temple in the distant land of Yamato.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Raised in secrecy, the girl grew stronger than any human, having strength of a god.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Naturally, for she was a demigod, as shown by Kitano-Tenjin in a dream when the mother conceived the child.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> The girl grew up not knowing this. Only that her father was a renowned samurai in the capital.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> And so, at age 15, a messenger from the capital came to the temple.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> The messenger spoke. The father wished the girl to return.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Overjoyed, she returned to the capital.<br> ...And there, she was given a new name.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Mitsunaka:</strong><br> You are the eldest child of the Genji clan.<br> Thus you shall be given proper armor and weaponry...</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Mitsunaka:</strong><br> Make sure your endeavors do not bring shame to the family. Slay all those who dare defy the capital.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Mitsunaka:</strong><br> Depending on your service, you may someday lead Genji.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> ...Yes, Father.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Without hesitation, I will assail the traitors.<br> If ordered, I will become an oni.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Mitsunaka:</strong><br> Not an oni. You are my child, a human child, my eldest who carries the proud blood of Genji.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Mitsunaka:</strong><br> Minamoto-no-Raikou. That is your new name.<br> Never, ever forget that.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> I will not. I shall strive to slay traitors as one of Genji!</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> ...The girl killed many enemies.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Those born of men and not of men. Wielding her supernatural strength, the girl slayed many enemies.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Really, so many were killed.<br> Rarely did she meet the sunset unbathed in blood.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Kill, kill, kill, kill, and kill some more...</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> She abided by her father&#39;s words.<br> So that one day she will lead the Genji.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> And then, eventually, amidst the battles...</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> She realized she had trusted friends and a loving family, a younger brother, next to her.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Raikou&#39;s Four Heavenly Kings!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Is Kintoki the younger brother?</p><hr><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Comrades. Family. There really was...<br> Nothing else that could equal them.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> However... One day, the girl had a thought.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Was there meaning in her distinguished service?<br> Wasn&#39;t it all for naught?</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Her comrades praised her. Her students showed her dazzling smiles, too.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Still. Once born an oni&#39;s child...</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Could she ever truly lead the Genji?<br> Would she be truly accepted?</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> By her father, by those of her house, by the people of the city. By the humans...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> That&#39;s...</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> ...She was afraid. Though she was stronger than anyone.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Her father accepted her, didn&#39;t he?</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Did he? Not only was she born a woman, she was also an oni&#39;s child.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> If only she&#39;d been a man, a genuine human... How much better it would have been... That was her thought.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> She understood that she was oblivious in that quiet country temple.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> By staying in the human crucible of the capital for even a short while, she realized how they feared anything strange.</p><hr><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> ...The girl decided. She would now live up to her father&#39;s expectations.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> To escape her days of fighting traitors and move onto the center stage of history.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> And to do that... She would have to kill herself.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> She tried to cut loose her demonic nature and deformity, along with her former name.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...Ushi Gozen.</p><hr><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> ...Yes.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Boss! I know you can hear me, Boss Raikou!</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> I don&#39;t get this! I see no reason why we now need to head to Azuma-no-Kuni!</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> ...What is it, Kintoki.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> The area around the Asakusa River is empty wilderness. Why would a Genji general leave the capital to go there?</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Even onis and spiders don&#39;t go out there.<br> And then there&#39;s you.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> You&#39;ve been acting weird lately.<br> How to put it... Almost absent-minded...</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> You just look at me in a daze, frozen, at least twice or thrice a day. It&#39;s weird.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Weird...?</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Nothing&#39;s changed about me. Your mother&#39;s still the next leader of the Genji clan, who still loves you.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> ...Forever and ever.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> She must... be...</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Hey, Boss! I&#39;m not finished talking yet!</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> And so...</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> In Azuma-no-Kuni, far from the capital, the girl fought against herself. At first, through deep meditation.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> After an intense battle, the demonic nature within her... Ushi Gozen was finally awakened.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> She separated from the girl&#39;s body, manifesting as an incarnation of Gozu-Tenno.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> She really split into two people?</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Yes. And so began their battle to the death.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> The clone technique...</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Oh, I know of that. It&#39;s, you know, what ninjas use in stories from the generations born after me, right?</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> No, this was different. A single girl, completely divided in two...</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> And then fighting to the death.</p><hr><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Ushi Gozen manifested truly as a ravaging demigod.<br> The skies blew, lightning crashed, the earth split.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> In order to kill it, she and her comrades attacked \u201Cherself.\u201D</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> ...It truly was a foolish act.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> And the foolish girl finds out. The foolish conclusion of one who could only see herself.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Behaving without consideration for others, injuring her beloved child...</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Making the child she least wanted to sadden feel so much sadness...</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> ...(Sniff)</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Mother has never regretted anything as much as that. Such a sad, sad...</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Nothing is worse than that. Honestly...</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> That&#39;s why... I never want you to feel that...</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> ...Oh? Fujimaru?</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Well, you&#39;ve fallen asleep. In the middle of my lesson. Bad child.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Still... Perhaps this is for the best.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> You ended up not seeing my embarrassing tears.<br> That would have made the lecture pointless.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Heh, how adorable you look asleep.<br> So defenseless. I want to poke your cheeks.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> I almost want to hug you tight and use you as a pillow.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> But... You&#39;re tired from your late training.<br> I&#39;ll refrain from my selfishness.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> With that, for tonight, have a good night, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> ...You&#39;re finally here. It&#39;s your turn now, Boss!</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> I&#39;ve been waiting, Boss.<br> For once, I can&#39;t handle things alone.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I thought I was asleep in my room...</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Yeah, you definitely fell asleep!<br> You&#39;re asleep now!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> You mean, this is...!</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Yup, exactly like I hoped.</p><hr><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> It&#39;s where a Master and Servant are linked in a dream. This is a dream. A really dangerous dream.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Although, it&#39;s not my dream.<br> Well, maybe I&#39;ve dreamed about this...</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> But this is Boss Raikou&#39;s dream.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> And we&#39;re nearly at the scene where the Ushi-Oni, some of the most formidable enemies in her stories, show up.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> The Ushi-Oni are pretty strong enemies, but this is the biggest of the big ones!</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Ushi Gozen... The manifestation of Raikou&#39;s demonic side.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> The one I&#39;ve heard so much about.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> If you&#39;re here with me, Kintoki, then...</p><hr><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> When this happened in the past, I stopped it.<br> Well, kinda stopped it, but it turned out all right.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Boss Raikou, you see... tried to kill her demonic side, which manifested as Ushi Gozen.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Old story, she got her priorities backwards.<br> You can cut part of yourself away, but it&#39;s still you.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> What happens if you kill yourself? You die, right?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> She... tried to kill herself?</p><hr><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Yeah. She was worrying and suffering all by herself.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> She chose to die as a human by killing the oni side of herself.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> I objected. Despite her screaming, despite her cries for me to let her die.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Did I tell you what happens after that?<br> I beat up Raikou and stopped the fight.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You told me before.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Right. Well, that&#39;s how it went.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Ushi Gozen vanished.<br> We never saw her again.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Maybe I didn&#39;t hear it.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> It&#39;s not something I like to talk about...<br> Anyway, I stopped Raikou from killing herself.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Screaming at her, telling her not to be a fool.<br> Down on my knees begging her, pathetically sobbing.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> In the end, Ushi Gozen surrendered.<br> She willingly got hit by my lightning and passed out.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Literally stunned herself. Ushi Gozen hasn&#39;t appeared since.</p><hr><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> But, this time things are going differently.<br> You need to fight her. As Raikou&#39;s Master.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> To see if you can accept Minamoto-no-Raikou, you must confront Ushi Gozen, the one usually dormant within her!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I had a feeling about that!</p><hr><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Good! I&#39;ll help you as much as I can!</p><p><strong>Ushi Gozen:</strong><br> I see, it&#39;s you. My new child.</p><p><strong>Ushi Gozen:</strong><br> Admirable that you would amiably arrive here with Kintoki. However, hmm. Simply no good.</p><p><strong>Ushi Gozen:</strong><br> You&#39;re just a human. Hearing you&#39;ll save the world,<br> I wondered how much of a monster...</p><p><strong>Ushi Gozen:</strong><br> ...a hero with demon blood you would be, yet you&#39;re merely a child with slight knowledge of sorcery.</p><p><strong>Ushi Gozen:</strong><br> Raikou is a troublesome one as well. Since we can&#39;t choose our parents, we should at least choose our children.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> You say some cruel things ya know.<br> The avatar of Gozu-Tenno sure is a dangerous fella.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> But you&#39;re not all that cool or golden!</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Don&#39;t underestimate us, or you&#39;ll get burned! [\u2642 He /\u2640\uFE0F She} is a great Master, who can bond with gods, onis, and humans!</p><p><strong>Ushi Gozen:</strong><br> Is that so? Well, well, how impressive.</p><p><strong>Ushi Gozen:</strong><br> How do you do, dear child of man.<br> It&#39;s not been long... but how was it being at my side?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> What do you think?</p><p><strong>Ushi Gozen:</strong><br> I think nothing. Hee hee hee.</p><p><strong>Ushi Gozen:</strong><br> No way humans and oni can understand each other.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Still not sure.</p><p><strong>Ushi Gozen:</strong><br> You&#39;re honest. Well, I doubt you would understand.</p><hr><p><strong>Ushi Gozen:</strong><br> Let me show you. What sort of being Raikou is, what I am. How frightening an oni, a demon, an aberration can be.</p><p><strong>Ushi Gozen:</strong><br> Show me your power! My child! Show me power worthy of being the child of Ushi Gozen...</p><p><strong>Ushi Gozen:</strong><br> To me, master of heaven&#39;s vengeance! If you even have a piece of ash left of you after being embraced in my arms!</p><p><strong>Ushi Gozen:</strong><br> If so, I shall love you! While crying a flood of tears for my sake!</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Ha, sick story! Quite the cool beauty we have here!<br> Here she comes, Boss!</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Take this seriously! This may be a dream, but if she cooks you, you&#39;re done!</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> I dunno about Authority and stuff, but an angry god is a dangerous being that breaks all the rules!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Of course, full power!</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> All right! We&#39;ll hit her, full throttle!<br> We&#39;ll knock the Monster of Id back down the well!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I think you&#39;re using \u201Ccool beauty\u201D wrong!</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Am I? That&#39;s not golden! Okay, once we deal with this, take your time and teach me!</p><hr><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Okay, let&#39;s slam her! Engine, full power.<br> Let&#39;s go with the non-stop Golden Drive!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Ah... Good morning, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> It&#39;s a fine morning. I don&#39;t know what it&#39;s like outside, but it&#39;s a wonderful day for Rayshift.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> What&#39;s wrong?<br> Why are you staring at me like that...</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Heh heh, your sleepy eyes are adorable, too.<br> Breakfast is ready.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Mash helped out, too. She&#39;s a good girl.<br> Nothing like those terrible insects.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Oh, but listen to this. I couldn&#39;t believe it but... Kintoki helped out this morning, too!</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> My, my, look at him go... It&#39;s enough to make a mother shed tears of joy!</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Actually, I did shed a few...!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> If I am still alive, that means...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I guess I was accepted?</p><hr><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Yes?</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> What are you saying?<br> I accepted you as my Master long ago.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> That was quite...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> ...A fierce battle.</p><hr><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> I don&#39;t know what you mean...</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> If I hadn&#39;t, I wouldn&#39;t be taking such good care of you. Didn&#39;t you realize that?</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Now then, go wash your face.<br> I don&#39;t mind bringing you a basin and a towel.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> ...If you don&#39;t mind overprotectiveness, I won&#39;t hold back.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> In moderation, please!</p><hr><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> ...Hee hee hee.</p><h2 id="neither-a-mother-nor-woman-yet-i-am" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#neither-a-mother-nor-woman-yet-i-am" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Neither a Mother Nor Woman.

The good old Heian period.</p><hr><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Boss Raikou never did have any female friends her own age. &#39;Course, back in those days\u2013</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> Of course not.

I don&#39;t even know what to say to that, Boss...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> You two get along well, huh?</p><hr><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> Well sure.

Oh my, are you jealous, Master?</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> Why didn&#39;t you just say so then? We could positively cooover Chaldea in flowers of blood\u2013</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Gaaah!

All of us in Kyoto slept better at night knowing you were there keeping us safe.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> I was never able to express my thanks at the time...but I truly am grateful to you.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> Even now that I am but a shadow of my living self,<br> those feelings haven&#39;t changed, and that memory continues to inspire me.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> ...!</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Ahh, Lady Kaoruko...</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> ...Thank you.

But, I already have Kintoki...</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Mitsunaka:</strong></p><p>He is a monster, a half-hearted excuse for an oni.

Lord Michinaga and Lord Seimei have both told me it is time.</p><p><strong>G\uFF1AMinamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> My children? But, I already have Kintoki...</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Mitsunaka:</strong></p><p>Hmm, I see. I hadn&#39;t considered that option... It could be very interesting to see what happens when a demon reproduces with another demon.</p><p><strong>G\uFF1AMinamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> ...Father?</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Mitsunaka:</strong></p><p>Ah, never mind. Pay it no heed. At any rate,<br> that...thing has already been named as a Sakata.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Mitsunaka:</strong></p><p>Once I have chosen a man to be a proper mate for you, you are to set about having children as soon as possible. You will bear children who will carry on the Genji name after we are gone.</p><p><strong>G\uFF1AMinamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Huh?</p><p><strong>G\uFF1AMinamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> But Father, then...does that mean I&#39;ll get to be a mother...?</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Mitsunaka:</strong></p><p>Don&#39;t be ridiculous. As I told you, you are the Genji&#39;s leader, and so are a man. You are, therefore, a father.</p><p><strong>G\uFF1AMinamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> B-but, I can&#39;t possibly have a child on my own.<br> What will I do about my partner...?</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Mitsunaka:</strong></p><p>He is nothing more than a tool for giving you a child, of course. Once the child is conceived, you are to cut off the father&#39;s head.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Mitsunaka:</strong></p><p>As the leader of the Genji, you will need a minimum of ten heirs, so you will need to cut off ten heads all together; one for each child.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Mitsunaka:</strong></p><p>I can&#39;t imagine you would have sympathy for these men...but if you wish to avert your eyes, you may also use the Four Heavenly Kings to kill them if you like.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Mitsunaka:</strong></p><p>Be grateful that I am so lenient in this.<br> Now go. Hurry.</p><p><strong>G\uFF1AMinamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> ...Yes, Father. As you wish.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Why?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Why is this happening?<br> I&#39;m a mother. I know I am...</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Mitsunaka:</strong><br> Raikou. Are you there, Raikou?</p><p><strong>G\uFF1AMinamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Yes? What is it, Father?</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Mitsunaka:</strong></p><p>I was just thinking we need to start giving serious thought to the matter of your children... I was talking about this with someone, and he came up with a fascinating idea.</p><p><strong>G\uFF1AMinamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> My children? But, I already have Kintoki...</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Mitsunaka:</strong></p><p>Hehe, exactly. That strange boy from Mt. Ashigara has grown up strong, but look at his eyes. His hair color. They are wrong.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Mitsunaka:</strong></p><p>He is a monster, just as you are.<br> A match made in heaven, as they say.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Mitsunaka:</strong></p><p>You will mix his inhuman blood with our powerful Genji blood.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Mitsunaka:</strong></p><p>The resulting child will ensure Genji&#39;s dominance over the other clans. Even if we should lose the Settsu armor one day...</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Mitsunaka:</strong></p><p>...the descendant of man, the Sekiryu, and the oni god will be sure to emerge victorious in any battle. Therefore, Raikou, you are to bear Kintoki&#39;s child as soon as possible.</p><p><strong>G\uFF1AMinamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Huh?</p><p><strong>G\uFF1AMinamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> But Father, then...does that mean I&#39;ll get to be a mother...?</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Mitsunaka:</strong></p><p>Don&#39;t be ridiculous. As I told you, you are the Genji&#39;s leader, and so are a man. You are, therefore, a father.</p><p><strong>G\uFF1AMinamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> ...Yes, Father.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Mitsunaka:</strong></p><p>To secure the Genji clan&#39;s future,<br> you will need at least ten heirs.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Mitsunaka:</strong></p><p>Once you have conceived the tenth,<br> you are to cut off Kintoki&#39;s head.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Mitsunaka:</strong></p><p>His monstrous bloodline must be the sole property of our Genji clan.</p><p><strong>G\uFF1AMinamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> I... But...</p><p><strong>G\uFF1AMinamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> ...Yes, Father. As you wish.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> This isn&#39;t right.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> It&#39;s not right. It&#39;s not. It&#39;s not, it&#39;s not, it&#39;s not.<br> Does this mean...I&#39;m not...a mother...?</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Mitsunaka:</strong><br> Raikou. Are you there, Raikou?</p><p><strong>G\uFF1AMinamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Yes? What is it, Father?</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Mitsunaka:</strong></p><p>Now that you&#39;re older, it&#39;s time we started giving serious thought to the matter of your children.</p><p><strong>G\uFF1AMinamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> My children? But, I already have Kintoki...</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Mitsunaka:</strong></p><p>...Ahh, yes, you do, don&#39;t you. Hmm.</p><p><strong>G\uFF1AMinamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Father?</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Mitsunaka:</strong></p><p>Never mind. There is no need for you to concern yourself with any of this. All you need to do is keep wielding your sword as the leader of the Genji.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Mitsunaka:</strong></p><p>Yorichika and I will handle everything else.<br> You need not dwell on these matters.</p><p><strong>G\uFF1AMinamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> ...Yes, Father. As you wish.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> ...I...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> ...I...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> ...I...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> .........I.........</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> What am I?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Did I have children? Was I unable to have children?<br> I don&#39;t know. I just don&#39;t know.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> What am I?<br> I am a warrior.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> What am I?<br> I am a killer.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Yes... Yes, that&#39;s right. That&#39;s what I am.<br> That&#39;s all I need to be. I don&#39;t need anything else.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Isn&#39;t that right, Father?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I will never forget. I, Raikou, exist solely to slay the Genji clan&#39;s enemies.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> That is what I am. I must never be anything else.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> Wh-what&#39;s going on!?<br> Where is all this magical energy coming from!?</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> The special area I created with talismans is groaning at the seams...! Oh no! This is terrible!</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> That&#39;s the room where Lady Raikou is resting!</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> It&#39;s going to fall apart!!!</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> Ooh, now that&#39;s more like it!<br> Do you know what&#39;s going on here, brat?</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> Is this whooole library gonna go up in flames? Or are we gonna get another bloodred river flowing through here?</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Shut up. If she&#39;s who I think she might be now,<br> we won&#39;t be any match for her.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Oh crap. You don&#39;t mean...Ushi Gozen?</p><hr><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Could be.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> Sounds about right.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Do ya feel that, Master!? This magical energy... The way it burns your skin and shakes the goddamn air...!</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> I got a golden bad feelin&#39; about this! I think we&#39;re gonna see you-know-who for the first time in...</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Hm? No, wait. Wait, wait, wait!<br> This is somethin&#39; different...!</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> It ain&#39;t Ushi at all! This is...</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Lone warrior mode!?</p><p><strong>H\uFF1AMinamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Kintoki.</p><p><strong>H\uFF1AMinamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> There is an insect in our midst.</p><p><strong>H\uFF1AMinamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Right over there.</p><p><strong>H\uFF1AMinamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> ...Kintoki?</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Wait! She&#39;s not the oni from Mt. Ooe now! She&#39;s one of Master&#39;s Heroic Spirits! C&#39;mon, Raikou, don&#39;tcha remember!?</p><p><strong>H\uFF1AMinamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Fool.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Whoa!<br> Whooooooaaa!!!</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> She&#39;s too strong for me!<br> Shuten!</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> Well, well, now this is something new.<br> Okay, I can lend you a han\u2013</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Shuten-Douji!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Raikou, why did you!?</p><hr><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> Oooh, not good enough, I&#39;m afraid. That was a copy of me I made out of wine. Nice trick, right? I copied it off of Mochizuki Chiyome of the Kouga clan.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> Mmm...looks like I don&#39;t need to hold back.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> You don&#39;t mind if I end up killing her, do you, sweetie?</p><p><strong>H\uFF1AMinamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Insects.</p><p><strong>H\uFF1AMinamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> I can smell them.</p><p><strong>H\uFF1AMinamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> And not just them.</p><p><strong>H\uFF1AMinamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> There are evil things here.<br> Insects.

Can you get rid of the thing that&#39;s possessin&#39; Boss Raikou now!?</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> You mean by using what Lord Seimei taught me!?<br> I, um, I&#39;m still not very good at that, so...</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> PLEASE!</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> A-all right! Besides, this is all my fault for speaking so carelessly!</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> Now that things have gotten so out of hand, I&#39;ll devote my entire Spirit Origin and Spirit Core to resolving the situation!</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> I&#39;m countin&#39; on ya! Got that, Shuten!?</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> I still haven&#39;t the foggiest wha\u2013</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> !!!</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> Ugh, I really don&#39;t have time to talk! Can you get this done quickly? I don&#39;t think I can keep this up for long.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> All right! I&#39;m coming to help!</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Let&#39;s go, Boss!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Go where!?</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> The same kinda place as last time, of course!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> We can&#39;t leave Raikou like this!</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> I know, Master! I know!</p><hr><p><strong>H\uFF1AMinamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> ...!</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Let&#39;s do this, partner!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> ...Just what I was waitin&#39; for.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Looks like you&#39;re holdin&#39; on to your sense of self just fine. I knew I didn&#39;t have to worry about you, Master.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> So, we&#39;re inside Raikou&#39;s head...?</p><hr><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Yup. This is her mindscape.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> If you&#39;re wonderin&#39; why it&#39;s so freakin&#39; dark in here, that&#39;ll be &#39;cause she&#39;s lost sight of everythin&#39; else.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Sorry for bringin&#39; ya along for the ride on such short notice.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Why would you be sorry about that?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Don&#39;t be silly. Of course I&#39;d come.</p><hr><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Thanks, Master.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Your body&#39;s prolly deep asleep by now.<br> Y&#39;know, like that REM REM thing you do...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You mean that thing where I sometimes end up in someone else&#39;s dream?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> REM REM...</p><hr><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> They might seem similar,<br> but they ain&#39;t the same by half.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Strictly speakin&#39;, this is Murasaki&#39;s spell at work. Though I guess she&#39;s really just copyin&#39; one of Seimei&#39;s tricks.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> We&#39;re pretty much here to do a sorta exorcism type thing.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> They say there&#39;s a buncha different ways ta do that, and one of those feels exactly like what we got here.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> What ya do is, you go inside whoever&#39;s been possessed and try to suspend your conscious mind to be able to see more clearly. I think it&#39;s been called somethin&#39; or other Meditation.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> These days, I think I&#39;d call it the Golden Mind Dive.<br> Got it?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> More or less.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> All too well.</p><hr><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> ...Yeah.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Usually, this sorta spell wouldn&#39;t work on a Servant at all. Unless the Caster usin&#39; it really knew their stuff, it&#39;d just bounce right offa them.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> The fact that this one&#39;s workin&#39; on Raikou just proves that, even with all the magical energy she&#39;s givin&#39; off...</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> ...her Spirit Origin&#39;s still pretty damn unstable right now. Hell, forget her Spirit Origin.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> If she&#39;s givin&#39; off this much magical energy,<br> she&#39;s prolly burnin&#39; her Spirit Core for fuel.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> That can&#39;t be good.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> We&#39;ve got to stop her, fast!</p><hr><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Damn straight!</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Well, whaddaya say we head on down? With these kinds of things, you&#39;ve usually gotta work your way deep into the mindscape...</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Ya know, the Raikou we saw earlier...</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> There was somethin&#39; different about her than when Ushi Gozen showed up. It was like... How can I put this...</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Back in the Heian period,<br> we&#39;d call it the \u201Cinverted dragon scale.\u201D</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> What&#39;s that?</p><hr><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Basically, it&#39;s a weak point you really,<br> really don&#39;t want anyone else touching. Like a dragon&#39;s Achilles&#39; heel.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Oh, like a sore spot?</p><hr><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Sorta. It&#39;s a real sore spot.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> I figured I was gonna hafta tell ya about this at some point, so I might as well do it now.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> First off, Raikou...isn&#39;t actually our mom.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Uh-huh...</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Yeah.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Yeah, I...uh... That had occurred to me...</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> ...Right. &#39;Course it would.<br> &#39;Sides, you&#39;ve already got a mom.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> I had a different mom, too...though she was already dead by the time I met Raikou.</p><hr><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> But, Raikou can&#39;t help but be motherly,<br> especially as a Berserker.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Best I can tell, I&#39;d say the Raikou we know is on the younger side, long before she became the great Genji leader.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> She&#39;d always refer to herself as a mother, and she took real good care of me, even though she couldn&#39;t&#39;ve been even ten years older than me.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> ...She was as kind as they come.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You don&#39;t have to do this, Kintoki.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> If you don&#39;t want to talk about this, you don&#39;t have to.</p><hr><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> It&#39;s all right, Master. I want ya to understand.<br> And not just because you&#39;re her Master.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> I want ya to really understand who Raikou is because you&#39;re one of the most important people in her life.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> See, Raikou&#39;s mother saved her life, but at the cost of her own. So Raikou grew up never knowin&#39; a mother&#39;s love.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> That&#39;s why she&#39;s so fixated on her ideal of what it means to be a mother.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> ...I think that&#39;s why she wants ta be one herself.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> But her old man, representing the previous generation, wouldn&#39;t have it.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> He said that Raikou is the leader of the Genji, an&#39; so, had ta be a man, not a woman.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> ...Never mind that he ended up strippin&#39; the title from her right at the end.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> ...Pretty awful, right?</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Even today, the history books say Minamoto-no-Raikou was a man who had lotsa kids with lotsa wives.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> She still hasn&#39;t really come to terms with that.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> ...Deep down, she&#39;s still an innocent maiden who never had anyone explain that sorta thing to her.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> That&#39;s why it&#39;s such a sore spot with her\u2013kinda taboo, really\u2013for anyone to mention her historical kids around her.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> So that&#39;s what caused this...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> So when Shikibu brought up Yorikuni and Yoriie...</p><hr><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> There ya have it.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> She never really understood or accepted it, but she still had to live her life as the leader of the Genji.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> And well...that was her way of handling it.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> That ain&#39;t Ushi Gozen.<br> It&#39;s somethin&#39; completely different.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> I guess ya could call it her ultra-golden-dangerous work mode. When she gets like this, she&#39;s completely focused on protectin&#39; Kyoto from evil, to the exclusion of anythin&#39; else.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> She ain&#39;t too chatty in this mode. Just goes about killin&#39; her enemies with overwhelmin&#39; power.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> I call that version of Raikou...the lone warrior.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> In this mode, she&#39;s one of the most powerful warriors to ever live, a lone wolf who just goes around mercilessly killing any enemies of the state, be they human or inhuman.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> She doesn&#39;t think like a person.<br> Hell, she doesn&#39;t even eat.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> All she does is fight. That&#39;s it.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> She just fights, and fights, and keeps on fighting.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> It&#39;s her ultimate un-golden way of escapin&#39; from reality... She pretty much just throws herself into her job so she doesn&#39;t hafta think about anythin&#39; else!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> S-so she&#39;s a real work fiend...or a work oni, in this case...</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Oh, yeah, I guess she is, isn&#39;t she.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> So she&#39;s a workaholic!?</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> That&#39;s it. I knew there was a word for it.</p><hr><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> We all need to forget about bad stuff now and then, but the way she&#39;s goin&#39; about it now, it won&#39;t be long &#39;fore she works herself to death.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> That almost happened back when she was still alive.<br> Now that she&#39;s a Heroic Spirit...</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> ...she&#39;ll prob&#39;ly keep fightin&#39; until she disappears &#39;cause she burned through all her magical energy.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Then we&#39;ll just have to stop her before that happens.</p><hr><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Didn&#39;t hesitate for a second, huh.<br> I knew I could count on ya, Boss!</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> All right, here we are.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> So, we finally got some scenery here...</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> There it is!<br> That&#39;s the big beastie we&#39;re lookin&#39; for, Boss!</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Damn, it&#39;s pretty huge. She musta been under a lotta stress. Let&#39;s make sure it never weighs on her again!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Hell yeah!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> We&#39;re getting rid of this thing for good!</p><hr><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Just what I like to hear! All right, then, come on!</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> We&#39;re gonna exorcise the hell outta this thing at golden lightning speed!</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Let&#39;s do this!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> ...(Huff) This is...wearing me out!<br> What the hell&#39;s her deal!?</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> Even an ox ought to be at least a little tired by now. Maybe this is why you weren&#39;t able to fully become one, hmm?</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Insect.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> ...!</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Give up.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> I know even insects are living creatures.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> But I was told they have no place in Kyoto.<br> Therefore...</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> !?</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> Eesh. Took them long enough!</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> I-I think the spell is working!</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> Or perhaps Lord Kintoki and<br> [\u2642 Lord /\u2640\uFE0F Lady} Fujimaru were successful!</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Ah...
