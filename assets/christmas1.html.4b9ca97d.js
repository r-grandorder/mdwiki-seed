The use of the second-person lends a certain subtlety to the sentence.<br> Don&#39;t you think, Fujimaru?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> That voice! Could it be\u2014?!</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> Ha! A lively response. I am possessed of a sudden desire to kick you in your arse.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> Though our contract is but a temporary one,<br> any Master seeking to transport me must be as so.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You were in the Massive Cavern?</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> ...No. This is my first meeting with you.<br> Can you not tell from my attire?</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> I&#39;ve certainly never been defeated by you, and have, under no circumstances, been brooding over it.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> I was simply in a foul mood, especially my stomach.<br> All because Archer wouldn&#39;t cook a sound meal.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> ...No, that is not it.<br> I am precisely as you see me to be.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> A mi-miniskirt... Alter</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> ...A m-miniskirt, you say?<br> Well, I suppose one could see it as such.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> But mind it not, and allow me to say this in advance.<br> One who would be Santa is unbothered by the cold!</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> Allow me to introduce myself. I am Santa Alter.<br> I am a Santa Claus of Evil who slashes apart the icy breath of Midwinter!</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> ...You seem to misunderstand me. I merely wish to express my daily gratitude by delivering presents to all.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> However\u2014 After going through the trouble of gathering presents, I have lost my means of transporting them.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> The reindeer that I had hired previously to pull my sleigh have all run away in fear.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> What a bunch of cowards. All I did was use Excalibur Morgan as a jet engine to propel us into the stratosphere.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> I could pull the sleigh myself, but such a thing would tarnish the dignity of Santa Claus.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> I cannot capture the heart of children everywhere without a reindeer. Which is why\u2014 You understand, don&#39;t you, good Fujimaru?</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> It is for that purpose alone that I have unsummoned you here by force.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> As a part of my daily gratitude to you,<br> I bestow upon you the honor of being my reindeer.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> This is part of your duty as a king?</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> No. I am not a king here, but a Santa Claus!<br> Kindly refer to me in those terms.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> You didn&#39;t have anyone else you could ask, did you?</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> That is untrue! Of those I considered there was one, at least, with promise!</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> But they were rather hesitant, and worse yet,<br> extremely frail. Thus, I sent them packing.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> However, their eyes were so bright they would have made a perfect red-nosed reindeer...</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> Honestly... Even if it is Christmastime, one should have limits to how much one lets loose.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> ...No, wait a moment.<br> It seems the presents have drawn some uninvited guests.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> And I was in the middle of my presentation...<br> But there&#39;s nothing to be done about it. Take up your sword, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> Your body shall know what it means to go into battle with Santa\u2014!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> As you can see, many try to target Santa Claus.<br> Reindeer must be as strong as their master.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> Now then, you understand what I&#39;m saying, don&#39;t you?<br> You are now my reindeer. I won&#39;t hear any objections.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> Rest assured, I am a Santa and not a demon.<br> If you work hard, I shall grant you your life, at least\u2014</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Yes, ma&#39;am, I&#39;m ready to start right now!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Yes, Santa Alter!</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> Humph! That was a quick response!<br> Are you a lion cub, unschooled in fear? How promising!</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> Nonetheless, it was a good answer. I am pleased.<br> Now, let us start immediately.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> First, let us storm this house nearby.<br> As Santa, I must attack from the skies.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> Now, board the sleigh, Master!<br> I shall enlighten you on the ways of Santa!</p><h2 id="_1st-night-little-darius" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_1st-night-little-darius" aria-hidden="true">#</a> 1st Night: Little Darius</h2><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> Forward, my soldiers! Tear through the darkness!<br> Plunge into the blizzard! Wander! Wander!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> This sleigh really flies through the air!</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> Naturally. One who would be Santa must be able to traverse the skies. We must deliver presents to the children around the world.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> I&#39;ve dubbed this sleigh Llamrei Unit II.<br> You may relax your guard and entrust yourself to it.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Why are you yelling?!</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> Insolent fool!<br> I am not yelling. I am singing!</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> By announcing my presence this way, I can also avoid running into airplanes! It&#39;s common sense for a Santa!</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> Good. We are approaching our destination.<br> Prepare yourself, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> The return address of this \u201CDear Santa\u201D letter is in Persia. A request from Darius, aged 3.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> ...Hmm. The writing is so black and smeared I can&#39;t read it at all. Well, I&#39;m sure once I see his face, I&#39;ll know what present he&#39;d like.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> Let us go! We shall enter from this magnificent chimney!</p><p><strong>Lu Bu:</strong><br> [[File:berserkervoice1.png50px]]!<br> [[File:berserkervoice1.png50px]]!</p><p><strong>Phantom:</strong><br> Ahh... The iron lament that surpasses the vocal cords...<br> Echoing from the depths of the hollow, the enamored yet hate-filled voice of a young girl&#39;s lingering affections as she \u201Csings\u201D of death...</p><p><strong>Phantom:</strong><br> Specifically, I should call it the raging moans of a girl who can no longer abide her hunger. Ahh, how unsightly yet adorable\u2014!</p><p><strong>Phantom:</strong><br> Though it&#39;s a far cry from my own taste, she conveys her feelings so well it truly pains me.</p><p><strong>Phantom:</strong><br> A cry that would pierce Heaven itself. You who spews forth such hatred, I&#39;d liken you to... Yes, a carp swimming up a waterfall.</p><p><strong>Phantom:</strong><br> Actually, you are more like a carp banner. How auspicious. Ahh, how very auspicious indeed...<br> And hateful, too!</p><p><strong>Phantom:</strong><br> Christine! Christine has gone so far from me! Why?<br> Why does fate endeavor to tear us apart yet again?</p><p><strong>Phantom:</strong><br> Couples! Christmas! Santa Claus! Whenever I hear that this is a night for loved ones, it makes me sick!</p><p><strong>Phantom:</strong><br> Don&#39;t you agree, Sir Carp Banner? Why must we, upon such a night as this, be a company entirely of men?</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> ...What a ferocious cry from the soul. It stirs the heart too greatly. Surely, that Servant is an actor of some renown.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Yeah, that was quite an elegy.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Ehh, it was certainly a self-indulgent soliloquy.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> What a splendid performance. He probably has more passion in his pinky than that cursed Tristan...</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> ...But I can&#39;t imagine that either of them is Darius.<br> Also, that object in the middle of the floor...</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> There&#39;s nothing here but that tree-like candle in the center of the room. Does that mean Darius isn&#39;t here?</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> That&#39;s fine, then. I should simply turn around and leave now, but I do pity these two.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> Merlin has said that when a man is widowed, his suffering surpasses the pain of Death. As Santa, I can&#39;t just leave them be.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> Let us go, Fujimaru!<br> We shall be like the Christmas Carol that saved Scrooge!</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> Bow down, little ones!<br> Prepare to receive your presents from me!</p><p><strong>Lu Bu:</strong><br> [[File:berserkervoice2.png50px]]???</p><p><strong>Phantom:</strong><br> Oh, Christine!<br> You&#39;ve come back to me, Christine!</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> Ugh. Halt, Black Mantle!<br> Do not approach my reindeer.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> Laying hands upon your audience is a third-rate performer&#39;s action. Are you not a world-class actor after all?</p><p><strong>Phantom:</strong><br> What? I, a world-class...actor, you say?<br> I, the specter of this miserable underground hovel?</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> I never engage in flattery. You rave as though mad,<br> but your cries are filled with truth. So much so I am moved to tears.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> But more importantly, where is the master of this castle?<br> The sender of this letter to Santa should be here.</p><p><strong>Lu Bu:</strong><br> [[File:berserkervoice1.png50px]]!</p><p><strong>Phantom:</strong><br> Santa... Ahh, Beautiful One, what tragedy is this?<br> Now that I look more carefully, you are, indeed, Santa Claus!</p><p><strong>Darius III:</strong><br> Ohh... Oooohhhh!<br> Santa... Santaaaaaaa!</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> ?! This candle tree moves?!<br> You two, just what is the meaning of this?</p><p><strong>Lu Bu:</strong><br> [[File:berserkervoice1.png50px]]!</p><p><strong>Phantom:</strong><br> Die, please. Repent! And surrender what&#39;s in that bag!<br> Santa Claus is the one who should be struck from this world!</p><p><strong>Darius III:</strong><br> Oooohhhhh!<br> Presents! Gimme!</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> Well! Only naughty little children try to take things by force like that! We&#39;ve no choice. Prepare to fight,<br> Fujimaru!</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> After all, it is also Santa&#39;s duty to give dreamy-eyed children a cold jolt of reality!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Yeah, but I don&#39;t see any \u201Clittle children\u201D here!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Santa&#39;s more violent than I&#39;d imagined!</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> Minor details. Worry not!<br> All one really needs to be Santa is to hand out presents.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> Not even Picts, and raising such a ruckus indoors?<br> Such poor manners. It&#39;s Christmas. Take this fight outside!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> Have you learned your lesson, ruffians? The form of Santa Claus pleases me greatly but it is only a temporary one.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> My true form is that of Britain&#39;s Red Dragon,<br> Altria, the King of Knights. Remember it well.</p><p><strong>Lu Bu:</strong><br> [[File:berserkervoice2.png50px]]...<br> ...(looking dejected)</p><p><strong>Darius III:</strong><br> Ohhh... Santa... Claaaus...<br> Santa... Claaaaauuss...</p><p><strong>Phantom:</strong><br> Anguish... Anguish... Anguish...<br> When I think of what we&#39;ve done... Oh, the anguish...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...Doesn&#39;t he look a little odd?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> ...Well, Your Majesty, don&#39;t welook like the bad guys here?</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> ...Yes, it is starting to feel that way to me as well.<br> This being my first job, perhaps I got a bit too hot-headed.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> You there. You understand the speech of these other two, correct? Is that tree Darius, aged three, by any chance?</p><p><strong>Phantom:</strong><br> Yes, he is... His king is, in fact, the green light that burns in Hell, the Lord Cyalume... And who might you be, my lady?</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> I already told you I was Santa Claus.<br> Now, accept your presents.</p><p><strong>Lu Bu:</strong><br> [[File:berserkervoice1.png50px]]!</p><p><strong>Darius III:</strong><br> Ohhhh!<br> Presents! Gimme!!</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> There, there.<br> This is for you.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> Since you would die before you could ever use a Noble Phantasm, use this to amass a little motivation, or perhaps a little love.</p><p><strong>Lu Bu:</strong><br> [[File:berserkervoice1.png50px]]!</p><p><strong>Darius III:</strong><br> Hurraaaaay!</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> As for you, Black Mantle, I shall give you... Yes, this.</p><p><strong>Phantom:</strong><br> Oh! This is the very thing I have lost! My love, my light!<br> Christine! You&#39;ve brought her back to me!</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> As I said, do not come near my reindeer.<br> We are busy. We have a mountain of work to do.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> Let us go, Fujimaru. Santa should be as a passing breeze. We must not stay long.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> And it is painful to have to leave a party early, since my hunger is never satiated.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> Well, then\u2014 Farewell, little ones!<br> Let us meet again next year! Merry Christmas!</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> All right. They were the perfect companions for some light warm-up. Now it&#39;s time for you to work, my reindeer.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> From now until the end of Christmas, many more battles await us, I am sure.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> At each stop, gather the stockings and bring them to me.<br> Stockings are the crystallizations of the hearts of children seeking presents...</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> It is by the power of such magical energy that Santa Claus traverses the globe. In other words, you could call it our fuel.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> The more you gather, the greater the reward I shall bestow upon you. Remember that as you go about your work.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> The next \u201CDear Santa\u201D letter is on the 2nd.<br> Let us build up our party until then!</p><h2 id="_2nd-night-her-name-is-little-marie" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_2nd-night-her-name-is-little-marie" aria-hidden="true">#</a> 2nd Night: Her Name is Little Marie</h2><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> Good work with your reindeer training.

His birth was celebrated for days, reaching its peak on the 25th.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> In other words, beginning my advance this early is Santa&#39;s old way of doing it.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You&#39;re doing it the classic way.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> Of course. Function follows form. Destroying everything thoroughly is the classic way to win.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Advance? Like a military advance?</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> I see our destination. Give me your magical energy, Reindeer!</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> This \u201CDear Santa\u201D letter is from Marie, a girl who lives in France.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> Two of her friends are always fighting, so she wants a present to bring them together, it says.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> Humph. How stupid.<br> Santa only grants one&#39;s own wishes.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> I have no presents to bring happiness to other people.<br> What does this Marie think Christmas is about, anyway?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Sounds like a mistake Marie would make.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> That&#39;s right. If she wants to bring them together,<br> she should pick a present herself.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> She should do what I did. I once sent two knights who were fighting a single horse, and told them this...</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> \u201CThis is for the one who thinks they&#39;re better than the other.\u201D I knew this would test them and form a friendship.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> It worked perfectly. They stopped arguing in front of others. Although they were trying so hard not to snap at each other when they smiled, but oh well.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> That was Agravain&#39;s idea.<br> Aggy always gave me the best advice.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Sounds like a mistake you&#39;d make.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> I&#39;m not making any mistakes.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> Santa brings gifts.<br> She does not bring happiness.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> Whether the gifts bring happiness depends on if the little ones have been good or not.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> ...Hmm? This should be the insertion point...<br> But it&#39;s a snowy field.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> The French Marie is without a doubt a member of the royal family.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> I was expecting her Christmas party to be nationwide chaos, with mountains of expensive turkeys...</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Found you!<br> That&#39;s your last airspace violation, Santa Claus!</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> What!? We&#39;re 2,000 meters in the air!<br> Don&#39;t you think that&#39;s crazy?</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> That&#39;s my line!<br> What&#39;s with that hippo sleigh? Are you kidding me?</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Also a date in the sky with Master was going to be my thing! Don&#39;t steal it from me!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> What is that eagle...bird?</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> That&#39;s a hippogriff, Reindeer.<br> It&#39;s often mistaken for a griffin.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> I mistake them often myself. Neither is as good as a dragon, so don&#39;t waste time remembering.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> ARGH! Don&#39;t think that firepower equals strength!<br> How short-sighted can you be?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Wow, that&#39;s so cool!</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Huh...it is? Am I... Cool?<br> I&#39;m used to being called cute...</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> ...but \u201Ccool\u201D is new. You&#39;re making me blush... Hehe.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> ...Maybe I&#39;ll crush them. More specifically,<br> I&#39;ll smack you hard right between the legs.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Humph. I don&#39;t like that kind of sexual prejudice.<br> That&#39;s not a weak point for me anyway.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Hmmph, target sighted!<br> Marie, up here! Fire everything you&#39;ve got!</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> What!?</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> We&#39;ve been hit!<br> Grab on, Reindeer! We&#39;re crash-landing!</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> Tch. They shot down Santa Claus!<br> Is this the French way? I knew I shouldn&#39;t trust them!</p><p><strong>d&#39;Eon:</strong><br> That&#39;s my line, you suspicious woman!<br> Go back to Santa Claus village!</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong><br> Oh my. That&#39;s rude to Finland, d&#39;Eon.<br> The fault lies entirely with this wicked Santa.</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong><br> Hehehe. I&#39;ve never felt so violent before.<br> It&#39;s exciting! Shooting a cannon is fun\u2661</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> Not interested in negotiations, huh?<br> You&#39;re after my sack of presents, aren&#39;t you?</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> Very well.

Do I have the wrong person?<br> Maybe Astolfo&#39;s got bad eyesight...</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong><br> It doesn&#39;t matter. Tonight&#39;s a festival night!<br> Little problems will melt away with the snow.</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong><br> Vive la France!<br> My dear, gallant Santa, do you like snowball fights?</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>d&#39;Eon:</strong><br> ...Such amazing bladework.<br> This couldn&#39;t be Santa, could it?</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong><br> Oh, didn&#39;t you realize when the fight started?<br> This isn&#39;t the same Santa Claus as before.</p><p><strong>d&#39;Eon:</strong><br> I-I&#39;m sorry... I wasn&#39;t thinking straight...<br> But my queen, if you noticed then why didn&#39;t you stop?</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong><br> I&#39;m sorry, but I wanted to keep the momentum going!<br> You had fun too, didn&#39;t you Santa?</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> Of course. It&#39;s good to revisit one&#39;s childhood.<br> I&#39;m sorry for being so rough with your knight.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> By the way, that well-bred dog...<br> Are you perhaps Marie?</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong><br> Yes, I am Marie.<br> You read my letter, didn&#39;t you, Santa?</p><p><strong>d&#39;Eon:</strong><br> (Dog... That Chimera was a dog? That definitely wasn&#39;t a papillon, but if the queen says so...)</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> I&#39;m here! ...Wait.<br> Is the fight over already? I don&#39;t get to fight?</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> So this is everyone, huh? It seems there was a misunderstanding, but it&#39;s solved now.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> I&#39;ll give you your presents then.<br> Line up, you violent children.</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong><br> Okay!<br> Come on d&#39;Eon, Astolfo, let&#39;s line up!</p><p><strong>d&#39;Eon:</strong><br> Huh? ...I get a present too? Are you actually a nice person, even though you don&#39;t look like one?</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> That last part was unnecessary.<br> You and I should get along.

You, Roland...<br> Are the 12 Paladins filled with nothing with perverts?</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Huh?<br> Comparing me to Roland isn&#39;t fair!</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> He&#39;s the type who wind up in handcuffs.<br> I get my name in the papers!</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> I&#39;m glad you&#39;re all getting along.<br> Let me see...</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> This is for you, Marie.<br> I hope it gives you inspiration for the Merry-Go-Round.</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong><br> Oh my! A glass horse!<br> Thank you, Santa!</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> Next is the Knight. You get this.</p><p><strong>d&#39;Eon:</strong><br> A m-maid?<br> Why do I get a maid outfit? Am I supposed to wear this?</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> It&#39;s a message to at least make better food than the cat.<br> That is, if anyone will take you at this point.</p><p><strong>d&#39;Eon:</strong><br> I&#39;ll be single for the rest of my life!<br> Even as a Servant!</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> I see. I think we&#39;ll get along well there, too.<br> Give me your contact info later.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> ...Now then.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> ...(Excited)</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> Let&#39;s go, Reindeer.<br> Farewell, and see you next year!</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> H-Hold it\u2014!<br> What about me? What do I get, Santa?</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> Nothing! He who does not fight shall not get presents!<br> You were too lazy to save Orleans!</p><p><strong>d&#39;Eon:</strong><br> She&#39;s got you there.<br> Even Atalante showed up as an enemy.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> What!?<br> That wasn&#39;t my fault!</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> The France chapter ended a long time ago!<br> That means I couldn&#39;t possibly\u2014oww!?</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong><br> Oh my. I guess Santa gave you a present after all.</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong><br> A Halloween pumpkin...<br> What does that mean?</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Um... Maybe that I&#39;m cute like a pumpkin?</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Aww, she said those mean things but she actually loves me... Tehehe.</p><p><strong>d&#39;Eon:</strong><br> No, I think she&#39;s saying you&#39;re an idiot who was late for the party. This is a Craft Essence that&#39;s past its expiration date.</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong><br> Oh, I get it! It means<br> \u201CYou won&#39;t be in anything until next year&#39;s Halloween.\u201D</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> What? \u2014I-M-P-O-S-S-I-B-LE!<br> That can&#39;t be right! I&#39;ll be back sooner than that!</p><h2 id="_3rd-night-heartbreak\u2606jean-kay" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_3rd-night-heartbreak\u2606jean-kay" aria-hidden="true">#</a> 3rd Night: Heartbreak\u2606Jean Kay</h2><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> So here we are. This time our \u201CDear Santa\u201D letter is from Jean Kay, address unknown.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> I guess she makes a living as an assassin, so has no specific address. Right now she&#39;s hiding in those caves.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Are you talking about Jing Ke?</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> It&#39;s Jean Kay, I think. How am I supposed to know how to pronounce it, I don&#39;t speak Chinese.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> What did she ask for?</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> The mental fortitude to remain calm in adversity,<br> and a pair of easy-to-draw double daggers.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> By the way, Fujimaru.<br> Do you hear that strange sound?</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> It&#39;s like someone&#39;s repeatedly hitting heavy meat with a blunt object, or endlessly pounding a bag filled with sand.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...I&#39;ve got a bad feeling about this.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> ...I can guess who that is.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> You&#39;re pretty perceptive. I wouldn&#39;t have guessed.<br> ...Well, once we go inside, we&#39;ll find out even if we don&#39;t want to.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> This time it&#39;s a cave, so there&#39;s no chimney here.<br> We&#39;ll go in through that door in the front.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> Hahh! Hahh! Whew!<br> What&#39;s wrong! With people! On Christmas?!</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> They say it&#39;s about celebrating His birth, so why!<br> Are all these couples! Exchanging presents!</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> No, it&#39;s fine. It&#39;s fine, Martha.<br> Showing your beloved how you feel is a good thing.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> The problem is! Wimps! Who can&#39;t even ask a girl out!<br> Unless it&#39;s on Christmas!</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> And His birthday was October, anyway!</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> And why are they playing!<br> Sappy pop songs! On a day! Like this!?</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> ...It fell. No, it snapped.<br> The chain holding that sandbag just snapped.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I saw</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> You&#39;ve got that right, Martha. If someone wants to send presents, they can do it any time.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> I went and got the enemy general&#39;s head for my brother the instant the idea came to me. He refused it for some reason, though.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> ...My Lord said something similar, actually.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> I went hunting monsters, and they said they wanted a demon&#39;s heart, not their head. \u201CStop that, it&#39;s scary,\u201D they said.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Hehe... Both them and my brother want so little.<br> It&#39;s such a virtue to be so not-greedy.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> I think they said something about needing eyeballs a while ago.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> If they want me to do it, I&#39;ll pull all the eyeballs off a Demon God pillar, but...</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Unfortunately, I&#39;ve been given no such order.<br> I wish they&#39;d give me some kind of mission...</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> ...so crazy that it could make you shiver just hearing about it...</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> Fujimaru, do you know that woman who doesn&#39;t know how to work out her stress problems,<br> or the loyal dog with the broken brakes?</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> Well, it doesn&#39;t matter. Excuse me!<br> I&#39;m told Jean Kay is here!</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> Huh? Who&#39;s there!<br> How long have you been there?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Since just now. I mean it.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I saw nothing. I saw nothing.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> Reindeer is right.<br> We&#39;re here to see Jean Kay.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> I&#39;m not at all interested in the things you were saying that would freak out Master if they heard them.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> \u2014Ahem. So you&#39;re here for Jing Ke, right?</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> Welcome to this distant cave, which normally no one should ever visit.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> I can see you&#39;re two... Um, two travelers, right?<br> Please, sit down.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> I&#39;ll get dinner ready. Once you have some warm soup,<br> please kindly get out, okay?</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> No need for that. Once we&#39;re done here we will leave.<br> Where is Jean Kay?</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> You mean Jing Ke?<br> Oh, she&#39;s...</p><p><strong>Jing Ke:</strong><br> What&#39;s up?<br> Did somebody call me\u2014?</p><p><strong>Jing Ke:</strong><br> Oh, looks like we&#39;ve got more company!<br> Hey Martha, are you going to cook?</p><p><strong>Jing Ke:</strong><br> Add in an order of seared beef, too.<br> Some sea turtle soup would also be great!</p><p><strong>Jing Ke:</strong><br> Everything you make is delicious, Martha. I don&#39;t know why the world&#39;s men aren&#39;t banging down your door.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> You&#39;re so lazy! All you do is lay around and you never help with the cooking.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> If I had my staff I&#39;d be teaching you a lesson, Jing Ke!<br> What happened to the normal, gallant you?</p><p><strong>Jing Ke:</strong><br> Aww. C&#39;mon, just make it! Pretty please!<br> I really like the meat dishes you make!</p><p><strong>Jing Ke:</strong><br> Yukhoe? Is that what you call that stuff? Those thin slices of beef you eat raw. It&#39;s so good with wine!</p><p><strong>Jing Ke:</strong><br> But how do you manage to grind the meat without a blade?</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> Wha\u2014t is this?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Definitely a drunk!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Definitely a cutie!</p><p><strong>Jing Ke:</strong><br> Hmm? Ushiwakamaru, did you get smaller?<br> What&#39;s with the black clothes? Going to war?</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> I&#39;m sorry, honored guests.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Jing Ke began drinking to recover from a traumatic event, and that was ten days ago. Now she&#39;s totally toasted.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> I see... She couldn&#39;t wait for me, huh?<br> I should&#39;ve come here first. Forgive me.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> But don&#39;t worry. Santa Claus is here for you,<br> little drunkard... No, I mean office lady!</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> I&#39;ve come to deliver your present!</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> What? Did you say Santa Claus?<br> Now that you mention it, you do dress like one...</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> ...Heh, you&#39;ve got guts. What makes you think you can just come back and... Never mind.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> I&#39;m gonna smash up your face!<br> Get ready, you villain!</p><p><strong>Jing Ke:</strong><br> What? Another Santa? Give me a gift card for a good yakiniku place! I want some beef tongue!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I knew they&#39;d attack us!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> What did Santa do?</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> ...Looks like this is starting to make sense.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> There&#39;s lots I want to ask, but it can wait until after the battle.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> You young ladies who want to spend your Christmas having a party in a gloomy cave\u2014</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> This is a royal order! Once I beat you, go try and find yourselves boyfriends!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Jing Ke:</strong><br> I lost\u2014!<br> So close! I just needed nine more steps!</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> I give up\u2014!</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> Tch... How could I lose twice to this thief...<br> Is it the staff? ...Am I not cut out for a staff after all?</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> Hmph. You&#39;ve finally calmed down, huh?<br> You seem to have it out for Santa Claus.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> Something happened, right? Tell me.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> What do you mean? A Santa Claus came here before.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> When I said, \u201CYay! Presents! Santa, I want a new set of German cooking knives!\u201D and got all excited...</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> ...That Santa made us sign some weird form and then put our stamp on it...</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> ...and the next thing we knew we were forced to buy expensive presents with our own money...</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> That&#39;s not all. When they found out we didn&#39;t have enough money, they confiscated our stuff!</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> What is that? Some kind of new sales technique?<br> When did Santa Claus turn into a shady company?</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> That&#39;s impossible!<br> Santa Claus is a friend to children everywhere!</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> ...But it seems your story is true.<br> As a fellow Santa, I am upset.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> That Santa must be a fake.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Come to think of it... Santa Alter&#39;s wearing black.<br> I didn&#39;t realize that she was Santa Claus at first.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> But the other Santa looked just like you&#39;d expect Santa Claus to look.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Santa Alter is a good evil Santa Claus.</p><p><strong>Jing Ke:</strong><br> Hmm. That&#39;s a complicated way of calling her.<br> So, is she good or bad?</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> ...A dark Santa, huh? One that gives awful presents to bad kids.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> Kids might think she&#39;s a mean Santa, but objectively speaking, she punishes evil kids so they&#39;ll mend their ways.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> That&#39;s not true at all.<br> I just give people the gifts they need.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> I have no intention on lecturing anyone.<br> If you want one, you can ask an Avenger.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> Anyway, I&#39;m sorry that happened to you. Let me see...<br> I didn&#39;t expect to need presents for three people.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> You, cold-looking woman. This is for you. The real one isn&#39;t here, but if you have this with you you&#39;ll find it.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> A-A ship? I might be able to do something with a small boat, but a ship this large...</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Well, whatever... If I sneak aboard at night and take the boss out first, the crew will all belong to me.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> That&#39;s a dangerous thought. As expected from a genius dog like you. I can see why your brother has such trouble.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> Next...</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> Huh? I get something too?<br> You show compassion, even to those you fought?</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> I&#39;m sorry. I misjudged you.<br> You are pure-hearted, and a real Santa Claus\u2014</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> This is for you. You like these, right?</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> Oh my.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> ...Wait a minute! I don&#39;t need this!<br> Why would a Saint want to get buff?</p><p><strong>Jing Ke:</strong><br> Hey, what do I get?<br> Don&#39;t I get a present?</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> Of course. You get this, Jean Kay.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> This talisman will help you do your job elegantly,<br> and not panic in front of your target.</p><p><strong>Jing Ke:</strong><br> HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAAHA!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> She loved it!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> ...She thinks it&#39;s funny?</p><p><strong>Jing Ke:</strong><br> Wonderful! I love this bearded guy\u2014!<br> Wow. That kinda got me. That hit me right in the kokoro.</p><p><strong>Jing Ke:</strong><br> I&#39;m gonna go assassinate this guy\u2013! He&#39;s got a face that just makes you want to stab him from behind\u2014!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> He was already assassinated...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> That&#39;s crazy...</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> ...I&#39;m sorry. Jing Ke almost never gets drunk,<br> but when she does she&#39;s like this...</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> She&#39;s been drinking ever since that Santa Claus got her... It&#39;s understandable.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> Hmm... This Santa Claus was good enough to deceive tough-looking girls like you, huh?</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> Well, it doesn&#39;t matter.<br> My job is done here.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> Let&#39;s go, Fujimaru!<br> To the next set of troubled children!</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> They left, huh?<br> She turned out to be a good Santa, but...</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Why was my Lord wearing a reindeer costume?</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> No, it was very cute, so it was a good Christmas present for me.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> Y-You think she&#39;s just into that?<br> That&#39;s how Riders are. Anyway\u2014</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> ...I don&#39;t see Jing Ke, do you?</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Oh.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> \u2014Okay, it&#39;s too late!<br> Let&#39;s forget about the bearded gentleman!</p><h2 id="_4th-night-penname-daddy-long-legs" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_4th-night-penname-daddy-long-legs" aria-hidden="true">#</a> 4th Night: Penname, Daddy-Long-Legs</h2><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> The keel&#39;s done for! It&#39;ll break any moment now! Isn&#39;t it time a certain someone took responsibility for this mess?!</p><p><strong>Robin:</strong><br> Don&#39;t look at me! This isn&#39;t my fault! This whole thing was supposed to be the two of us going on a fishing trip!</p><p><strong>Robin:</strong><br> Being equally matched at hunting in the woods, we were supposed to take our contest to sea, so to speak.<br> That&#39;s when\u2014</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> That&#39;s when\u2014 A certain idiot stowed away on our boat and waited for his chance while the two of us were busy in the hold.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> And saying how he wanted to meet the ladies of the Southern Lands, steered our boat straight out to sea!</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> Isn&#39;t that right?</p><p><strong>Emiya/Robin:</strong><br> \u201CKing David!\u201D<br> \u201COld Man David!\u201D</p><p><strong>David:</strong><br> Hmm... It&#39;s one thing when young ladies call my name...<br> But having it shouted by you gentlemen is rather unpleasant.</p><p><strong>David:</strong><br> Now, you two. Weren&#39;t you ever taught that you must respect your elders?</p><p><strong>David:</strong><br> By the way, I&#39;d rather like to return to the shore now. What do you say?</p><p><strong>David:</strong><br> What? The sail got broken and we ran out of our magical energy?</p><p><strong>David:</strong><br> Then this is an emergency!<br> Quickly, you two! Jump into the water!</p><p><strong>David:</strong><br> The boat can still hold my weight if I&#39;m alone.<br> The magical energy stored should hold out too! It&#39;s simple math!</p><p><strong>Robin:</strong><br> Arrrghh! It&#39;s no use, I am about to snap\u2014! Old man,<br> how can you act so high and mighty at a time like this?</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> That&#39;s how every one of the Kings of Old behaves!<br> In fact, I can think of one who&#39;s like a walking mass of arrogance...</p><p><strong>Robin:</strong><br> Wah! This isn&#39;t the time to stand around glaring at each other! Let&#39;s hurry up and toss some cargo overboard, at least!</p><p><strong>Robin:</strong><br> If we get done in by something like this, we&#39;ll be the laughingstock of the Servant World!</p><p><strong>David:</strong><br> The Servant World? So that&#39;s how you refer to it?<br> That&#39;s good to know. Thank you!</p><p><strong>David:</strong><br> Then in that case, may I ask who the current top comedian is there? I&#39;d like to know for future reference.</p><p><strong>Robin:</strong><br> Oh, probably that one girl... The one with the dragon wings and the horns growing out of her head.</p><p><strong>Robin:</strong><br> There are lots of other talented ones too, but they fall short of her.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> What are you babbling on about? As of now, I&#39;d nominate the three of us for the biggest stooges!</p><p><strong>David:</strong><br> Oh yes, I&#39;m sorry! That reminds me, do the two of you know the tale of Carneades?</p><p><strong>David:</strong><br> When a ship sank upon a stormy sea, one man was fortunate and survived the wreck by clinging to a small piece of driftwood.</p><p><strong>David:</strong><br> But there was another fortunate man who survived as well, and he swam toward the first man. Therein arose a problem.</p><p><strong>David:</strong><br> The driftwood was large enough to keep one man afloat,<br> but with two, it would certainly sink. Thus, the man\u2014</p><p><strong>Robin:</strong><br> Hey, Red Mantle! What do you say we lighten our load by one person right now? Then you and I can continue our contest afterward!</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> For once, I agree with you, huntsman!</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> This is a good chance for us. We can compete to see who&#39;s the better Archer right here and now!</p><p><strong>David:</strong><br> That saddens me. Nothing ever comes from contention...<br> And, it&#39;s already known that I am the superior Archer...</p><p><strong>David:</strong><br> But I suppose if I were to knock you off the boat defending myself, none could blame me for it. So I shall join in your contest!</p><p><strong>David:</strong><br> Despite my appearance, I was a King of many victories.<br> I must warn you that I am skilled. Extremely skilled.</p><p><strong>David:</strong><br> If there were a ranking of \u201CMost-Victorious Kings\u201D in the Servant World, I assure you, I would occupy its top spot.</p><p><strong>Robin:</strong><br> Oh, is that so? Fine by me. Killing kings is what I do,<br> so I&#39;ll put you out of your misery now!</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Most-Victorious King? Superior Archer?<br> Hmph. You 3-Stars certainly talk a big game.</p><p><strong>Robin:</strong><br> !!! Look above!</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> Hohoho!<br> Step aside, you&#39;re in the way of my landing!</p><p><strong>Robin:</strong><br> ...And who might you be?<br> We were in the middle of something just now, you know?</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> The invincible Santa that descends upon Christmas like this storm! That is who I am.</p><p><strong>Robin:</strong><br> Huh? Santa? Really?<br> But wait! The sky? You came from the sky?</p><p><strong>Robin:</strong><br> Meaning, you have some means of getting off this boat?</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> Naturally, I do. Due to this storm, I have left my sleigh and reindeer waiting for me above the clouds.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> A proper Servant must think upon their Master&#39;s safety.<br> Isn&#39;t that so, Red Archer?</p><p><strong>Robin:</strong><br> Oh-hoh! Is this Servant an acquaintance of yours,<br> Red Mantle?</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> \u2014(remains silent with an unreadable expression on his face)</p><p><strong>David:</strong><br> Abishag! It&#39;s you, Abishag! O Beautiful One, there can be no doubt that you are my Abishag!</p><p><strong>David:</strong><br> Ohh, to think that we would both become Servants and meet again like this! I am truly blessed!</p><p><strong>David:</strong><br> Come, warm this chilled body of mine as you did in the past. Come, hesitate not.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> You are mistaken, King David.<br> I am Santa Alter, not Abishag.</p><p><strong>David:</strong><br> ??? But with beauty such as yours you must be Abishag.<br> Ah. Perhaps you do not recognize me as a youth?</p><p><strong>David:</strong><br> I was an old man when I took you as my wife.<br> But fear not, for my heart is as true as ever it was.</p><p><strong>David:</strong><br> Be I shepherd, king, or aged man, I declare that the contents of my mind, at base, are ever unchanged!</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> Oh? That is well, then. In that case, you were of sound mind when proclaiming yourself the \u201CMost-Victorious King\u201D?</p><p><strong>David:</strong><br> Huh? Uh, yes, I suppose that...<br> I was indeed powerful in war.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> ...Fool... You&#39;ve dug your own grave...</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> Then I shall see your strength tested.<br> Gift distribution can wait till after.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> En garde, Archers!<br> This sword shall rectify your arrogance!</p><p><strong>David:</strong><br> Sorry, one moment, please! As I, personally, am not terribly powerful, won&#39;t you assist me, gentlemen?</p><p><strong>Robin:</strong><br> Huh? Are you completely mad?<br> All we want is to catch a ride on that flying sleigh...</p><p><strong>Robin:</strong><br> Though she just might do our bidding if we defeat her.<br> If it&#39;s a fight you want, I will gladly comply.</p><p><strong>Robin:</strong><br> A Saber-class challenging Archer-class Servants to a fight. This won&#39;t even be funny.</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Robin:</strong><br> Gwaah\u2014?! Man, I messed up... Now that I look closer, you&#39;re actually a Rider-class, aren&#39;t you?</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> You have an Archer who attacks with a staff.<br> A Rider who attacks with a sack of presents should be fine as well.</p><p><strong>David:</strong><br> Hahaha! Well, there&#39;s no comeback we can make to that.<br> That said, my Noble Phantasm is pretty Archer-like though.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> ...Ahem. I assume we&#39;re all calmed down now?<br> Why, exactly, did you come here, Santa Rider?</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> Fool. I did not come here at my own behest.<br> I came in response to a \u201CDear Santa\u201D letter.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> ...I see. I have a pretty good idea who the sender was.<br> I&#39;ll bet he asked for jewels to delight his many wives with, right?</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> Really, writing letters to Santa as a full-grown man...<br> What a problematic adult. Seriously.</p><p><strong>David:</strong><br> Yes, seriously problematic.<br> One should limit one&#39;s childish dreams.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> What? King David... Um.<br> Pardon me, but wasn&#39;t it you?</p><p><strong>David:</strong><br> Of course it wasn&#39;t.<br> The only one I send my prayers to is our Lord in Heaven.</p><p><strong>David:</strong><br> And anyhow, isn&#39;t the idea of Santa Claus a bit scary?<br> It&#39;s nothing but trouble to receive gifts from someone who wishes nothing in return.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> If it wasn&#39;t me and it wasn&#39;t King David,<br> that means\u2014</p><p><strong>Robin:</strong><br> All right, all right! It was me, okay? I sent it!<br> Call it a temporary fit of madness\u2013!</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> Don&#39;t be embarrassed. All are equally accepted in the eyes of Santa Claus. Especially you in the green. You have worked hard.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> Your method of supporting your Master from the shadows rather than coddling them is most praise-worthy. Though a tad under-handed.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> In contrast, you in the red. You spoil your Master too much. What are you, the mother of an exam student preparing for Exam Day?</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> Uh-uh! I object strongly to that!<br> I&#39;m not at all overprotective...</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> These presents are for you two.<br> Accept them gratefully.</p><p><strong>Robin:</strong><br> !!!! Black Key Assortments?</p><p><strong>David:</strong><br> Wow, what an impressive-looking sword!<br> (rather half-heartedly)</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> Don&#39;t get too happy yet. Your real present is being prepared elsewhere. I sent word ahead of time, so it should arrive soon.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> Farewell, then.<br> Keep your fights moderate during Christmas times!</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> She comes and goes like a storm.<br> I didn&#39;t even realize the real storm had passed.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> Ah, well. At least this means we won&#39;t have to listen to the tale of Carneades now.</p><p><strong>David:</strong><br> What? Who spoke of Carneades&#39; tale as an example to follow? That&#39;s horrendous. Let us put that man to death.</p><p><strong>Emiya/Robin:</strong><br> It was you! You haven&#39;t learned anything since the Uriah incident, have you?!</p><p><strong>David:</strong><br> Now, now. No matter how strained the situation, I am not the kind of man who would be so insensitive as that.</p><p><strong>Robin:</strong><br> ...Maybe we really should just toss him overboard?<br> We&#39;d be doing his Master a favor, don&#39;t you think?</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> ...Agreed. His existence will only be a bad example.<br> Let&#39;s just say King David went back to Okeanos.</p><p><strong>David:</strong><br> I apologize, it seems your words were true. I know I am wrong now, please forgive me. Our Lord in Heaven says so, too.</p><p><strong>David:</strong><br> Rather, why don&#39;t we reflect on our battle just now?<br> Despite our loss, don&#39;t you think the three of us make a good team?</p><p><strong>David:</strong><br> Nameless One, with your AOE Noble Phantasm.<br> And Faceless One, with his single-target Noble Phantasm.</p><p><strong>David:</strong><br> And I, using aggressive evasive tactics to avoid harm,<br> sealing the enemy&#39;s special attacks before they are launched.</p><p><strong>David:</strong><br> Even humbly speaking, wouldn&#39;t we be a rather invincible team? We should become friends, shouldn&#39;t we?</p><p><strong>Robin:</strong><br> Hmm, that&#39;s true enough.<br> We wouldn&#39;t have any blind spots as a team.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> True. We wouldn&#39;t be the most powerful team, but we&#39;re all elite Archers. With the three of us combined, there&#39;d be no enemy who could\u2014</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Hi! I received your order and have come accordingly!<br> This is the location of the special Christmas concert, right?</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> Ugh, a Lancer?!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> According to the client&#39;s order, since we are floating out at sea, I can let loose and sing as loud as I want...</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> I won&#39;t let anyone escape me tonight! Now let&#39;s jump straight into my opening number, \u201CLove is Dracul!\u201D</p><p><strong>Robin:</strong><br> Ah, this is the end. We&#39;re all going to the underworld with that AOE Noble Phantasm...</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> It seems the Home-Delivered Concert from Hell has begun.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> Heh! Those accursed Archers, will drop like flies.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Welcome back, Santa.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> Th-thank you. So you&#39;ve learned to give Santa a proper greeting after all? You seem to be understanding your role as a reindeer better.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Did something happen down there at all?</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> What? I merely sent them an event worthy of Christmas.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> After all, they were wondering who the top comedian in the Servant World was at present.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> In any case, that concludes our detour.<br> Our next \u201CDear Santa\u201D letter\u2014</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> ...comes from Uruk, from a boy named Gilgamesh?!</p><h2 id="_5th-night-little-gilgamesh" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_5th-night-little-gilgamesh" aria-hidden="true">#</a> 5th Night: Little Gilgamesh</h2><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> This is the address of our next letter-sender, but\u2014</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> My letter should be arriving soon. Not that I normally take any notice of Christmas or whatever it is\u2014</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> That wretched Saber is sure to dress in that manner of getup. Such frivolity... Who would&#39;ve thought she would answer to such needs so faithfully.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> It is praise-worthy for a king to endeavor to meet his subjects&#39; expectations. Even I could perhaps learn from her example. But of course, I won&#39;t.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> No, that is not the vital point in this. What I should truly take note of is the institution of Christmas!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> It is said that however reserved and modest a woman can be, on Christmas, she cannot help but speak the truth of her heart!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Ahh, I can&#39;t imagine any future but one in which she will confess her feelings for me! Very well. I shall allow it! Thank me for the good service!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Now, come quickly, Dark Santa! I shall make you understand our difference through my treasury!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Fwahahaha!

We have the night off thanks to Gilgamesh&#39;s grand delusions.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> And we happen to be floating above a great city.<br> What don&#39;t we enjoy ourselves in its entertainment quarter?</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> Though there are but rustic eateries here in ancient Uruk,<br> they should have good, simple food to dine upon.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> I, myself, favor that dish of wheat flour mixed with water and stuffed with various fillings that is then baked upon an iron plate and then basted with sauce afterward.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong></p><p>I imagine even you could make something like th\u2014<br> What?</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> We&#39;ve been encapsulated by a strange space!<br> Don&#39;t leave my side, Fujimaru!</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> !!! ...Where are we?<br> This does not appear to be a normal place...</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong><br> ...Pardon me...

And what manner of beings are you?<br> Are you the ghosts that haunt this place?</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong><br> We...are not ghosts or phantoms, I think...<br> But I don&#39;t think we are human either...</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong><br> Yes... Neither Jack nor I really know what we are...</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong><br> We didn&#39;t have names either...<br> All we could do is lie here and look at the town...</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong><br> But tonight, um...</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong><br> Since it&#39;s...Christmas...<br> We were thinking we&#39;d like something warm too.</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong><br> ...Yeah. That&#39;s why, even though we knew that it was wrong...</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong><br> ...we forcefully summoned you here \u201Cinside\u201D ourselves.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> ...I see. You must be the unfulfilled spirits of young girls.<br> Your lives ended while still innocent, and ignorant of love.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> I see you&#39;ve gained a sense of self under the light of Christmas. ...Though only due to your sense of loneliness.</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong><br> We aren&#39;t that complicated.<br> But Alice only had memories of the hospital, so...</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong><br> What? Well, you only had memories of a dark sewer,<br> Jack. I don&#39;t think that&#39;s a good thing. Not at all.</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong><br> That&#39;s why... At least for one day today, we...<br> We wanted to feel \u201Cchosen\u201D by someone too...</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> ...I see. So you&#39;ve never had your names called,<br> or have never been chosen by another?</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> \u2014Upon this extraordinary day, the two of you felt that you, alone, were not special?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> This sounds like a job for Santa Alter.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Aren&#39;t you going to give them presents?</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> That I cannot do. I cannot give presents to any who have not written me letters.</p><p><strong>Jack/Nursery Rhyme:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> However! If you wish it from the bottom of your heart,<br> declare it! Wanting something just because you&#39;re lonely means nothing!</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> You should want something because it looks like fun, or simply because you want it! There, now. Show some courage!</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong><br> O\u2014Okay.<br> T-to be honest, we...</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong><br> We want to play like everyone else does!<br> We want a dream that&#39;s more fun than this!</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong><br> Please, Santa Claus!<br> Please give us presents too!</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> Well spoken. I shall answer to this courage. If you have no letter, then come take your presents by force!</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> Apologies for keeping you waiting, little ones.<br> Now, let us begin this merry party!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Jack/Nursery Rhyme:</strong><br> Aww...

Ohh...<br> Presents... So many presents!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Santa!</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> Your face says, \u201CSo you do have some good points,\u201D<br> Fujimaru. ...Of course, I do.

Thank you, Santa Claus! But is it really okay for us to have so many presents\u2014?</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong><br> Th-that&#39;s right... Aren&#39;t there many other children waiting for their presents too?</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> Heh. You needn&#39;t worry about that.<br> I have only one more stop to make.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> What&#39;s more, these are merely the spoils of your victorious battle. Now, what shall I give you for your actual, individual presents\u2014?</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> Here, take this!<br> These are the presents I have chosen especially for you!</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong><br> Ohh... Ohhhh\u2014!<br> This... This is...</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong><br> Hurray\u2014! It&#39;s a reindeer\u2014!<br> A humongous, humongous reindeer\u2014!</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> Two little girls running in gleeful circles around Asterios...<br> Heh! That&#39;s what a proper Christmas should be.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...So you already had a reindeer,</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> Fool, that one is only for show. If Asterios were to start running, lightning would streak the sky.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> Which would frighten all the little children.<br> The best thing for this prince is to have him do nothing.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Should we go call Euryale?</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> Certainly not. If that wicked goddess were here,<br> she would turn these pure, young girls into demons!</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> ...In any case, our work here is done. Even if it is only a dream for one night, enjoy yourselves heartily.</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong><br> Ah... Wait, Santa!</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong><br> ...Thank you.<br> Never mind me, but thank you for granting Alice&#39;s wish.</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong><br> Yes, thank you, Santa, and thank you, Jack.<br> Even though I was scared at first, the party was fun!</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> \u2014</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong><br> But I&#39;m glad. It was only because we waited patiently like the fake Santa told us to...</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong><br> ...that we got to meet the real Santa Claus.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> \u2014Wait.<br> What do you speak of?</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong><br> ...Right. Before you came here, another Santa Claus came too. But...</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong><br> ...while that Santa was talking with us, they suddenly said, \u201CUh-oh. This won&#39;t do!\u201D</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong><br> \u201CSince I&#39;m not the real Santa Claus, I won&#39;t be able to fulfill your wishes. But the real Santa Claus is sure to show up soon.\u201D</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong><br> \u201CPlease be good girls and wait patiently until then. What? If you can&#39;t do that, I&#39;ll try to do something for you next year.\u201D</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong><br> And after saying that, that Santa disappeared somewhere. She may have been a fake, but she was a cool Santa too!</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong><br> Well, good-bye, Santa! And Santa&#39;s reindeer!<br> Thank you for bringing presents all the way out here!</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> ...A fake Santa. I&#39;d been ignoring it, but now it seems a showdown is inevitable.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> Before I deliver my final present, I must punish this insolent cur.

This is the worst.<br> The worst possible woman who could&#39;ve come.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Jeanne d&#39;Arc Alter?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> I thought it was just that disgusting Servant,<br> but you&#39;re here too, huh Fujimaru?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> What does a pure-hearted Master want with a fallen woman like me?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> L-Lovely Christmas decorations!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> How?<br> What part of all this is luxurious?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> The spirits did this on their own.<br> It&#39;s not my taste. I would&#39;ve used a burning stake motif.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Or what? Will you be my straw doll Fujimaru?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> A straw doll, crucified and burning.<br> I like that. It&#39;s enticing.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> If you will, I&#39;ll forget about what happened before.<br> It won&#39;t matter, because you&#39;ll be dead!</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> Don&#39;t you dare bite my Master, rabid dog.<br> You&#39;re the one who sent me a letter.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> Heh\u2014I was shocked when I saw the name on the envelope. A girl who&#39;s nothing but hatred towards what is good, making a wish?</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> Also, the handwriting was very easy to read.<br> I thought you couldn&#39;t write.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> I studied! Is that bad!? Those scribblings I made were so ugly it made me retch.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> Heh. That&#39;s just like you, getting rid of anything you don&#39;t like.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> And why does it matter if they&#39;re ugly?<br> No one will see them.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Humph. You&#39;re not thinking hard enough. I&#39;m a perfectionist. You know, if you sign a contract with bad handwriting\u2014</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> ...Enough about that.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Why are you calling yourself Santa?<br> Bring out the real Santa.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> Are you blind? Or just stupid?<br> I&#39;ve brought many presents to children.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> I may not be a Saint, but I&#39;m a real Santa Claus.<br> Fujimaru&#39;s trust is proof of that.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> The reason I started this was to fling this present in your face, but now this is my real job.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> I can&#39;t be a Saint, but I&#39;m not a fake.<br> Right, my Reindeer?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Santa Alter is a real Santa Claus.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> Indeed. You may deny my words, but not those of Fujimaru. Right, Dark Jeanne?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Santa Alter is a veteran Santa.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> I don&#39;t know if there are veteran Santas.<br> But maybe you&#39;re right.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Hah\u2014<br> I see. This is an elaborate way of pranking me, huh?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> You probably thought I was spending Christmas lonely by myself, right?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> But too bad! I&#39;m having fun every day!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> I&#39;ve got so many wonderful friends here with me!</p><p><strong>Pierres A to G:</strong><br> \u201CHelp me!\u201D \u201CHelp me!\u201D \u201CHelp me!\u201D<br> \u201CHelp me!\u201D \u201CHelp me!\u201D \u201CHelp me!\u201D</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> A horde of spirits?<br> You haven&#39;t been using them to\u2014</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> That&#39;s right! We&#39;re all having fun playing a board game!<br> Games are fun! Games are great!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> The weak endlessly trod the path of the weak,<br> and the strong endlessly take from the weak\u2014</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Stealing the flesh and blood off the other players as they scream and cry is wonderful.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Yes\u2014 I am in first place by far! I have the most capital! Monopoly is fun! Monopoly is great!</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> Hmm? It doesn&#39;t seem like that much of a difference...<br> There&#39;s about a 10,000 dollar difference between 1st and 2nd place\u2014</p><p><strong>Pierre D:</strong><br> \u201CHelp me!\u201D</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> !</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> He just took the lead.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> ...Jeanne owes Pierre a million dollars...</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Oh, I&#39;m sorry. My hand slipped.<br> Let&#39;s start over. Too bad!</p><p><strong>Pierre D:</strong><br> \u201CHelp me!\u201D</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> ...How wicked.<br> You haven&#39;t repented at all, have you?</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> You&#39;ll never make any friends like this, and you definitely won&#39;t get to be a Servant.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Humph. I don&#39;t want to be a Servant.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> I don&#39;t need a Master.<br> Why would I want to join you, anyway?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> ...I&#39;m fine being alone. I&#39;m fine being alone.<br> I should atone for my sins all by myself.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> I don&#39;t want anyone&#39;s help\u2014least of all the help of Fujimaru, the one who defeated me.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...Jeanne Alter...</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Oh, are you sympathetic? Or disgusted?<br> It doesn&#39;t matter. You&#39;re annoying me anyway.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> You need to play the game fair, though...</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> How rude. I play fair!<br> Wait, is that what you&#39;re thinking about here!?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> I just used Jeanne Rule #3:<br> Jeanne gets to do whatever she wants three times!</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> I guess nothing we say matters...<br> We&#39;ll have to fight.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> That&#39;s just what I want. Pierres, get ready.<br> You want to work off some of that stress, right?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Torture them. Just like the trials you gave to me in life! Torture them slowly!</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> Humph, by the way... I&#39;ve been wondering,<br> but did you forget how to talk like a Saint?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Oh, I haven&#39;t forgotten. This is just for today.<br> I mean, you wouldn&#39;t want me using fancy words, right?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Can&#39;t you tell? I&#39;m trying to match you. I&#39;m trying to use words your puny, violent brain will understand!</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> It must be hard. I understand your pain.<br> I recognize your frustration myself.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> Because I was trying to match your level, and it&#39;s been making me want to throw up.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> So you&#39;re both good friends!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> You&#39;re both Alter!</p><p><strong>Santa Alter/Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Would you shut up!?</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Humph. I guess that&#39;s all you can expect out of spirits.<br> The only ones I can rely on are Gilles and the wyverns.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> So, what will you do? Keep playing?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> I spend my days doing nothing but cursing at the bottom of the Earth. I&#39;ll fight as much as you like.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> She hasn&#39;t changed at all...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> She hasn&#39;t learned a thing!</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> That&#39;s right, Fujimaru.<br> The battle will continue until we defeat her mentally.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> Losing won&#39;t teach her anything.<br> She&#39;ll just try and claim we never won.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> This particular child needs an especially nasty punishment.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> ...What?<br> Do you have some kind of trump card?</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> Of course. Will you still talk about staying down here forever after you get this present?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> \u2014</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Oh, her expression changed.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Yeah, I kind of know how you feel.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> How does it feel to look at your light... Light?<br> Well, I guess it&#39;s light.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> This is what will happen if you stay down here.<br> At this rate, there might even be Jeanne Lily.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> \u2014I&#39;m going back to purgatory.<br> I&#39;ve got better things to do than play here.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> I&#39;ll build up my Spirit Origin and become a Servant,<br> and next time I&#39;ll impale that stupid wannabe Saint!</p><p><strong>Pierres:</strong><br> \u201COooh!\u201D \u201CWe&#39;re free!\u201D \u201CWe&#39;re free!\u201D<br> \u201CWe&#39;re saved!\u201D \u201CThank you!\u201D \u201CThank you!\u201D</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Oh, but first, I forgot something.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Let&#39;s go, Bishop. You&#39;re going to help me with my trials in purgatory, okay?</p><p><strong>Pierres:</strong><br> \u201CHelp me!\u201D \u201CHelp me!\u201D \u201CHelp me!\u201D<br> \u201CHelp me!\u201D \u201CHelp me!\u201D \u201CHelp me!\u201D</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> ...All right. That&#39;s the last of the Dear Santa letters.<br> We&#39;ve handed out all the presents.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> My job is done.<br> Good work, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> I couldn&#39;t have finished this without you.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> Without you, I would&#39;ve given up after the first person.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> ...I may not look it, but I get bored easily and have a short temper. I&#39;m sure you didn&#39;t notice.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Oh, yeah.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Sure, yeah.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> I like that. It&#39;s good for a Master to be able to get along with their Servants.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> ...Hmm. So even that&#39;s not enough to get my point across, huh? Fine. Get on your knees and lower your head.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> I will point my sword at your shoulders, but I won&#39;t cut you. Just bear it for a moment.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> \u2014Once again, I recognize you,<br> Fujimaru. I won&#39;t forget what has happened over these last 10 days.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> You are my knight, my follower, and my leader.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> Please keep your light shining into the future.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> ...Now then, the time has come, it seems.<br> Our busy Christmas is over.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> I have one final present for you.<br> A justly deserved reward. Take it.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> ...In other words, a new fighter.<br> I don&#39;t need to say anything more, do I?</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> Chaldea&#39;s system has its flaws, so you&#39;ll have to start over from scratch. But that&#39;s all right.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> Thanks to its flaws, and its vagueness, so many encounters are possible. It&#39;s a good thing.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> My blade is with you!<br> You can ride on my sleigh any time you want!</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> Farewell, my Master!<br> \u2014Merry Christmas!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Senpai!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Doctor, it&#39;s Senpai!<br> They suddenly appeared in an unoccupied bathroom!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> What\u2014!<br> Did that bathroom have a hidden room or something?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> My head feels... Weird...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I think I saw... Santa...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Good, you seem like you&#39;re okay.<br> Oh, but this is\u2014</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Senpai is REM-REM-ing and looking very tired.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Is that right? Long-term Rayshifts are mentally draining,<br> so it&#39;s good to get a lot of sleep, but...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Oh, their health looks okay.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I was worried when you grabbed me and told me Chaldea was in trouble. I&#39;m glad it was nothing.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> And disappearing only to reappear later is quite the Prestige! It&#39;ll be a great trick for the party!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Party?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Wait, is today</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes, it&#39;s Christmas, Senpai.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Everyone&#39;s waiting for you in the conference room,<br> Christmas cake in hand.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Master?<br> Is something bothering you?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Nah. I&#39;ve got a funny story to tell you later.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I look forward to that. I was a little worried it would just be Da Vinci&#39;s magic tricks.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> There are only a few days left in the year. Our battle continues, but for tonight, let&#39;s enjoy Christmas!</p><p>\uFFFD</p>', 868);
