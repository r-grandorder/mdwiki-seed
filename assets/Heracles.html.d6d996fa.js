However, due to possessing the episode of going mad when he was alive, he is also suitable as a Berserker.</p><p>This Heracles is the one summoned as a Berserker.</p><p>The aim is to increase his status by means of the Mad Enhancement that exchanges reasoning ability.</p><p>Originally, the Skill Mad Enhancement is something used to forcibly strengthen a weak Servant. With a Heroic Spirit on Heracles\u2019 level, even only Mad Enhancing him consumes a vast amount of magic energy. He would not be able to stay manifested unless the rank of the Mad Enhancement is made lower compared to the other Berserker and the magic energy consumption is restrained. [2]</p><p>That being said, Heracles being summoned as Berserker yet still behaving with a slight reasoning ability intact is by no means only due to the rank of Mad Enhancement being low. Being the world\u2019s foremost hero, he possesses a strong reason that does not get swallowed up by the Class\u2019 special characteristic of Mad Enhancement. While he is a Berserker, he still maintain a calm eye for strategy.</p><p>In any case, with him already having a high status of a Heroic Spirit to begin with, being Mad Enhanced would unmistakably turn him into a monster beyond control.</p><p>As a Berserker, he makes use of an enormous axesword as well as his most trusted bow and arrow [3] Noble Phantasm, the \u201CHundred Heads that Shoots to Death\u201D.</p><hr><p><strong>TL Notes:</strong><br> [1] &gt;hero-ppoi classes.<br> lol is this a soft retcon.<br> ok technically not but still.<br> rip assassin.</p><p>[2] you know, this and Herc\u2019s interlude in GO makes it as if ME in and of itself, the very act of maddening a Servant, has different maryoku consumption depending on the HS AND the rank<br> Is this new or i just missed come of the old info, i wonder</p><p>[3] yeah it said \u5F13\u77E2 even if we know he uses no arrow and bow in particular as a zerk</p><h2 id="attitude-towards-master" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#attitude-towards-master" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Attitude Towards Master</h2><p>Being a noble man and a martial one at that, his wish is to be able to complete ruthlessly as warriors against other heroes.</p><p>Even if his emotion sealed with a strong Mad Enhancement, even if he is in a state where he does not act without the Master\u2019s order, it appears that it cannot completely erase that circumstance of his, and his own will of protecting the Master can be seen leaking at every turn in his act.</p><h2 id="dialogue-examples" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#dialogue-examples" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Dialogue Examples</h2><p>\u201C\u2582\u2582\u2583\u2583\u2584\u2584\u2585\u2585-----!\u201D</p><h2 id="historical-character-and-figure" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#historical-character-and-figure" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Historical Character and Figure</h2><p>On par with Perseus who was known for his exploits of eliminating Medusa and many others, he is the man called as one of Greek mythology\u2019s two great hero.</p><p>Grandson of Perseus*, and a half man half god hero born to Mycenae\u2019s queen Alcmene and the chief god Zeus.</p><p>His childhood name was Alcides, but he became known as Heracles upon being designated as such, \u201CHeracles (Glory to Hera)\u201D, by the Oracle of Delphi.</p><p>However, Hera despised Heracles who was born from Zeus\u2019 infidelity. She dispatched a snake on the sleeping cradle of Heracles and his twin sister Iphicles**, and as Heracles grew up into a hero of unparalleled strength she kept on thrusting hardships upon hardships, such as breathing madness into him.</p><p>Driven to insanity, he ended up murdering his and his sister\u2019s child, and he received an oracle from Apollo that as an atonement he must fulfill ten labors under Mycenae\u2019s king Eurystheus.</p><p>Thus Heracles fulfilled them so, although it became known as the Twelve Labors. In addition, Heracles also answered to Jason\u2019s appeal and boarded the Argo as one of its heroes.

He once again boarded the Argo led by Jason, standing in the way of the protagonist and friends. Unfortunately, being a Berserker and was incapable of exchanging words, Jason and Medea was incapable of knowing what he truly thinks. To add, one of the Gorgon sisters who have a connection with his ancestor Perseus, Euryale, also made an appearance in the third chapter.

As the most formidable enemy from the opening to the endgame, he gave off a very strong presence. Even Mad Enhanced, he had raised a strong bond with a girl that was his Master; perhaps he had been enveloped with the feeling towards his own child that he had raised himself. To add, upon fighting Emiya (Archer), he had felt a sense of commendation slightly leaking through towards a hard to come by and formidable enemy.</p><h2 id="related-characters" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#related-characters" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Related Characters</h2><p><strong>Jason</strong></p><p>An acquaintance, skilled with his mouth.

It was really fun, making him swell out on the account of his bursting mass=muscle. Now that once again I thought how many Servants has been added, there\u2019s a part in me that think that maybe his design modification is a little bit too simple. Like, maybe I should\u2019ve added in more color or something. I was really glad I got to be the one responsible for Heracles!
