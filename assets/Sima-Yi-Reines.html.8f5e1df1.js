Proper title: Formation of Formlessness</p><p>The man named Sima Yi, by nature, was not a tactician who employed genius and clever schemes. Be it wars or power struggles, he would create battle formations, wait for the opportune moment, and claim victory all in a matter-of-factly manner, then proceed to morosely mutter poems he does not even like.</p><p>Simply put, it is a Noble Phantasm that \u201Ccrushes an enemy\u2019s strengths and exposes their weaknesses\u201D.</p><p>When the illusory sun and full moon appear over the horizon, the world transforms and all kinds of mystics lose their meaning. In this case, this Noble Phantasm does not erase or nullify them. For example, it instead changes the battlefield into a sea against a Mystic Sword that can cleave land, or reduce the mana in the surroundings against a Servant skilled in magecraft.</p><p>\u201CAn enemy I have beaten before.\u201D \u201CAn enemy I have sufficient data about.\u201D If such conditions are met, even directly creating weaknesses for an enemy is possible. Sima Yi was the joker killer in the Romance of the Three Kingdoms who cornered both Guan Yu and Zhuge Liang and indirectly brought about their deaths.</p><p>Because this formation has no form, even those casted on have no means or words to describe it.

Schemes have become a forte of hers after all the assassination attempts on her as a Clock Tower Lord candidate.</p><p>Although she is friendly with the other Servants, especially with other female Servants, she never opens up to them at all.

She generally feels glee at her Master\u2019s predicaments.

Could you keep your mouth shut for me, elder brother?\u201D</p><p>\u201CWhat do I like? The suffering of others, of course. I have a nasty personality after all.

She should have already inherited the title, but she handed over the position to Lord El-Melloi II while she\u2019s the one pulling the strings. This is due to several factors such as her age and power struggles, mixed with her personal interests.</p><p>As a result, watching El-Melloi II suffer from stomach ache has become her favorite pastime.</p><p>Sima Yi was summoned as a result of Zhuge Liang being summoned in Lord El-Melloi II - in other words, \u201Cchain summoning\u201D. Sima Yi was summoned because of his connection with Zhuge Liang, and for the same reason Reines was chosen because of her connection with El-Melloi II.</p><p>As a Pseudo Servant, Sima Yi also chose to have Reines\u2019 personality to be the dominant one after finding out that\u2019s what Zhuge Liang did. That said, Sima Yi is less of a pragmatist than Zhuge Liang is, and would sometimes appear and talk using Reines\u2019 body. He only speaks on very few occasions, but based on Reines\u2019 analysis, he apparently likes new things and has the same nasty personality as her.</p><p>Being able to overwork her elder brother is apparently a perk that comes with them sharing the same mission. For that, she readily accepted the task of restoring human order.</p><h2 id="related-characters" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#related-characters" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Related Characters</h2><p><strong>Zhuge Liang (El-Melloi II)</strong></p><p>My elder brother is quite busy growing and shrinking.
