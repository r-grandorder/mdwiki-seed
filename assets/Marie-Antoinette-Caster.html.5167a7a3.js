Given that it is the resort, she is slightly in high spirits. She feels that royalty is at home in a summer resort. Having successfully materialized in a swimsuit, she does not really care about the large amount of skin exposure. Marie Antoinette continues to sparkle beautifully, pleasantly, and gorgeously. Concerning her appearance, because she is rather unmindful of it, it may not be known that in the eyes of others, she comes out all the more boldly.</p><h2 id="attitude-towards-master" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#attitude-towards-master" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Attitude Towards Master</h2><p>Basically the same as usual.

She is Marie Antoinette as she still is, even if her Saint Graph has been tinkered with by Sc\xE1thach. Nevertheless, she is somewhat in high spirits, and compared to her materialization as a Rider, the number of times she smiles has increased by a tiny bit. Unnoticed goes the crab that got on her head (only in her First Stage Ascension).</p><p>Marie uses a beach ball in combat.

At first, I was wandering off course, acting quite rashly and recklessly with something like deciding on a blue one-piece as I was too conscious about the resort feeling, but with Mr. Takeuchi\u2019s safe words of advice, I did a white dress! I\u2019m safe!! Given that the Noble Phantasm was already in the form of a last boss at the occasion of its ordering, I presented it to them in high spirits.
