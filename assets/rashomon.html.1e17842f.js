Sorry if the ride was bumpy, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> As if to be expected, I&#39;m not getting a clear visual of you. This time it&#39;s even worse than normal.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I&#39;m guessing you can&#39;t pinpoint the cause?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Yeah. There are times when you travel so far back that we don&#39;t have enough data on that era...but that&#39;s not the case here.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> This observation impediment doesn&#39;t follow any pattern we&#39;ve seen before. It&#39;s like someone is jamming our signal.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> However, the fact remains that I&#39;m picking up very unusual responses from that era. It&#39;s bound to turn into a Singularity if we leave it alone.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> That&#39;s why I sent you two to check it out.<br> For starters, what are your surroundings like?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Right. Well, it&#39;s safe here. I mean, we&#39;ve never been to a place this idyllic. Especially, um...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The cherry blossoms are lovely.<br> Just beautiful.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Cherry blossoms, huh? That&#39;s nice. I&#39;ve seen them before, too. Although I didn&#39;t get to have a viewing party...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...On top of that, there&#39;s a kind of sweet aroma...all around... Mm...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Yeah, I&#39;d say it smells delicious.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Wait, could this scent be...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Hmmm... An aroma you say... I wonder what it could be. We definitely need more information.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> My estimate is that you&#39;re in the Heian era right now. That said, the Heian era lasted for nearly 400 years.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Stand by while I try to pinpoint your exact coordinates. Please keep an eye on your surroundings.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Understood. Still...<br> I can&#39;t get over how beautiful it is here.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I can&#39;t get over how beautiful you are, Mash.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong></p><p>R-Right... As you can see, my primary colors are purple and black... So I am no match for the beautiful pink of cherry blossoms.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I wish we had some dumplings from the moon festivals.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Hehe. Shhh, Senpai.<br> Caesar will appear if you bring that up again.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> But... Ummm. Actually, this has been bothering me since we got here...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> There&#39;s a big pile of petals over there, but it&#39;s human-shaped.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It&#39;s as if someone fell asleep while viewing the cherry blossoms and was left behind for a full day...</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Ah\u2014chooo! Ahhh, what, morning already!? Daaammit!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> K-Kintoki!?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Okay, if I just do this and voila... Huh?<br> Hey, I&#39;m picking up a Servant in your proximity.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Going by the powerful magical energy reading... No doubt about it, it&#39;s a musclehead Servant with a suffocating presence!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes, Doctor. Mr. Golden, Sakata Kintoki himself is right in front of us.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Oh, Kintoki is there.<br> That would explain this strength level I&#39;m seeing.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Wait, what&#39;s he doing there!?<br> Did you two bring him along!?</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Oooh, my head hurts... I went overboard brawling with those bears...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Golden morning, mister.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Oh! That&#39;s a nice greeting, Boss!<br> To be golden in the morning is very golden!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> God morning, Kintoki.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> O-Oh, that&#39;s a strange mangling of the language.<br> \u201CGod morning\u201D sounds a little ominous.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> At any rate, it&#39;s good to start off with a greeting.<br> It shows you have good manners.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> A fulfilling day begins with a nice greeting, a nice breakfast, and nice wood-chopping.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> My boss... Oh, I don&#39;t mean you.<br> My former boss, or I guess more like my foster parent...</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Boss Raikou, you know?<br> She lived around here.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> She was usually lax, but very serious about table manners. Even bad sitting posture would earn a demonic glare.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Um, Kintoki. My apologies for interrupting, but would you tell us what you&#39;re doing here?</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Oh, sorry. I slipped into reminiscing about the olden days. But the reason I&#39;m here\u2014</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Whoa, wait. Don&#39;t get too close.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Huh?</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> (I&#39;m the one just waking up here... And even though I&#39;m the man they called the Beast of Ashigara...)</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> (Dangerous... she&#39;s the true dangerous beast!<br> I mean, look at her outfit!)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Senpai, he won&#39;t look me in the eye.<br> Does he hate me now?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I don&#39;t think that&#39;s it.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Dangerous... beast!</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> No, it&#39;s not your fault, young lady.<br> In fact, I would compliment you, if you were a man.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> H-Huh? Thank you... I think?</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Oh, you even bow to me?!<br> Then I gotta man up... Here we go...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> K-Kintoki!? Oh no, Senpai, Kintoki is punching himself hard in the cheek!</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> All right, that woke me up!<br> So, shall we get going, Boss!?</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> I wouldn&#39;t call it a world crisis, but there&#39;s trouble in my neck of the woods.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Deep in the mountains, somebody called.<br> I don&#39;t know who it is, but I&#39;m goin&#39; there.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> All the signs point to good things, so I&#39;ll push on ahead. My axe will carve a way through the mountains. Make way for this thunderclap!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Kintoki sure is in high spirits!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes, I&#39;ve never seen him so full of energy.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That said... Where are we going?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Um... Where are we going?</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Huh? Where are we going? Why, that&#39;s obvious.<br> It&#39;s\u2014</p><p><strong>???:</strong></p><p>Gyaaaaooooo\u2014!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Aaaah! A hostile response already!<br> Is it\u2013a wild beast?</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Your ambush is well-timed\u2014! But I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve seen you around these parts before!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It seems to see us as food.<br> It&#39;s charging!</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> This is also a perfect way to start the day.<br> A nice warm-up! Let&#39;s go wild, Master!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Good work.<br> I&#39;ve finally got your coordinates now.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> North latitude 35 degrees, east longitude 135 degrees 45 minutes approximately. The cultural and political center of Japan in this era.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> In other words, if you go down that mountain\u2014</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> There&#39;s only one place with a sky and cherry blossoms like this. We stand before Kyoto.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> It&#39;s Kyo\u2013 He stole my line! I shouldn&#39;t have started off with the latitude and longitude!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It&#39;s okay, Doctor.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Someday we may have to take a geography test with the fate of the world hanging in the balance.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> When that happens, this information should come in handy. Thank you very much.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Mash, you can be rather brutal sometimes...<br> Okay, one more piece of new info.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> You were just talking about an aroma, right?<br> I got curious, so I analyzed it...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> There&#39;s ethanol mixed in with the air.<br> Fruits and crops fermented using yeast.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> In other words, alcohol. What you&#39;re smelling is wine.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> The smell of wine, huh?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Kintoki? You seem like a guy who can hold his drink.<br> Bad memories or something?</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> I&#39;ve never heard of anything good happening when alcohol was involved.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> That&#39;s true. It&#39;s usually stories of someone getting drunk and embarrassing themselves!</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> ...That&#39;s right.<br> Jeez, I&#39;ve got a golden bad feeling about this.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Enough about drinking.<br> I&#39;ve located the point of the abnormality too.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Ignore what we can&#39;t understand for now, and head there as planned to investigate it.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> That&#39;s why you&#39;re here, right, Kintoki?<br> But when did you use the Rayshift?</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Huh? Boss was the one who called me, right?</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> I just found myself here all of a sudden! I was bored, so I trained with a bear, slept, and then it was morning.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...Hmm? So you were forcibly summoned there.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Yeah. Looks like there&#39;s more to it, but the details don&#39;t matter. Boss, you need more people, right?</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Then leave it to me! As you can see, I&#39;ve got more strength than I know what to do with!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Thanks, that&#39;s a big help.<br> Take care and proceed.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> This is a bad mist.<br> Smoke on the whatsits, you know?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> There&#39;s a bit of a ways till you get to the source.<br> What&#39;s the situation where you&#39;re at?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It looks like we&#39;re in a residential district near Kyoto... But something seems strange...</p><p><strong>Kyoto Resident:</strong><br> Hahahaha! Ahahahaha!<br> Food! Drink! Bring more!</p><p><strong>Kyoto Resident:</strong><br> You rotten fiend! I never liked the way you married your childhood friend! Now let&#39;s celebrate!</p><p><strong>Kyoto Resident:</strong><br> I like you. I love you! Take me! Take me now!<br> Take me to paradise! Huh? You&#39;re married? Then die!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> It&#39;s chaos.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Some kind of weird festival?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> To be honest, I don&#39;t understand what&#39;s going on. Everyone seems to be doing something different.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Everybody&#39;s getting excited about their own thing...<br> What is going on here?</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> A lot of them are saying some rough stuff, but they&#39;re still sane. It&#39;s fine until the blades come out, but...</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> ...Did you notice?<br> It&#39;s getting thicker.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> There&#39;s no telling what will happen.<br> Senpai, we need to be more careful than ever.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The cherry blossoms are as pretty as ever but\u2013</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Huh!? Senpai, watch out!<br> (Squeeze)</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> What&#39;s wrong? What happened!?<br> An enemy attack?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Mash just jumped...on me...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> This sensation... She&#39;s a beast!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Whew. That was close.<br> A cherry blossom petal fell on Senpai&#39;s head.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...Huh?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Senpai has an important duty to perform.<br> I can&#39;t let anything threaten that.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I, Mash Kyrielight, want to help Senpai.<br> More, more, more. More.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> So\u2013Huh!? Look at that foul-smelling mystery trap!<br> It may be an enemy Noble Phantasm! Get back! (Squeeze-squeeze)</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> No, that&#39;s just a fertilizer pit.<br> if you fall in, you&#39;re gonna regret it.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Oh? Senpai, your face is a little red.<br> Do you have a fever? ...No, perhaps a cold?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Are you okay? Does it hurt anywhere?<br> Do you want headpats?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Come to think of it, you were sleeping with your stomach exposed this morning.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> But don&#39;t worry. It&#39;s okay now that I&#39;m here.<br> I&#39;ll sleep next to you tonight.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> With my Noble Phantasm I can keep you safe from cold viruses, as well as nasty cedar pollen!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I can shut out all nasty insects and external enemies completely!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Mash is acting weird!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Medic... Medic!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Hmm? Wait a second. Is this...<br> I see. I knew it.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> By the way, how about you, Kintoki?<br> Anything seem off with you?</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> No need to worry.<br> I&#39;m always golden.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Actually, I feel stronger!<br> I feel like I&#39;m overflowing with energy!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Did you hear that, Senpai? Mr. Golden is filled with too much energy, he says. Scary, huh?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> But don&#39;t worry. Even if he approaches you with a sexual proposition,</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> my shield will deploy to secure you with incredible speed.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> No, I&#39;m not that kind of guy...</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Hey, Boss?<br> Is she always like this?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Actually, she kind of is.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> No, this time it&#39;s worse than usual.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Um, well... This is extremely hard to say, but...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I&#39;m seeing a slight change on her vitals.<br> She&#39;s drunk.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Drunk? Just on this aroma?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Yeah. It doesn&#39;t seem to be affecting you, though.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> It&#39;s because of the alcohol that&#39;s permeating the air. That&#39;s what&#39;s gotten into the people around you, too.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Whoever breathes it in gets drunk.<br> That&#39;s why they&#39;re all acting like that.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> How about you, Fujimaru?<br> Anything seem strange?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Not really. I&#39;m sober.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I&#39;ve never been drunk, so I don&#39;t know.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Hmm. Maybe the protective power that Mash should have is being transferred to her Master?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Still, that&#39;s the right thing for the moment. No matter how drunk she is, Mash will follow Fujimaru&#39;s orders.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> If Fujimaru went nuts, we&#39;d have a golden disaster on our hands.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Senpai! Senpai! Stop spending so much time talking with the Doctor, and let&#39;s go. We have a ways to walk.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Guess we&#39;ll have to keep going.<br> Though my bad feeling keeps getting worse... Huh?</p><p><strong>Kyoto Resident:</strong></p><p>Yahoo! A bunch o&#39; fresh country bumpkins!</p><p><strong>Kyoto Resident:</strong><br> Leave all your valuables!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I will not!<br> Senpai&#39;s going with me!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Senpai, we&#39;ll eliminate this obstacle.<br> Let&#39;s do it together!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> What&#39;s strange about this is that she seems normal at first glance...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Is there a reason they&#39;re getting drunk like this?</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Tch... It stinks.<br> I mean, there are good drinks and bad drinks.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> And this is a really bad one.<br> It ain&#39;t something a person should be drinking.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...Harder to reach you...<br> All I can manage is audio... Be careful...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It&#39;s strange. We should be getting closer to central Kyoto, but\u2013</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It feels so empty. I don&#39;t see a single person.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> What? Kyoto was the center of Japan in that era.<br> There can&#39;t just be no one there\u2013</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> But it&#39;s true. I&#39;ll add that there are several corpses lying on the side of the road.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It seems clear that something&#39;s going up ahead.<br> ...Mr. Golden, you know Kyoto well, right?</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Yeah, I guess. But this is different.<br> This ain&#39;t the Kyoto I know.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Kyoto&#39;s a golden city.<br> The atmosphere, the people, even the laughter shines.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> That&#39;s normal and natural in Kyoto. That&#39;s why in the future that amazing, cool golden temple is gonna be built.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> (He&#39;s probably talking about the Kinkaku... Rokuon-ji...)</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> I don&#39;t like it.<br> This dead, alcohol-stinking air ain&#39;t Kyoto.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Drinks are for warming up the heart.<br> It ain&#39;t something to melt the marrow of your bones.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> ...Tch. I don&#39;t want to remember it,<br> but this alcohol is\u2014</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Doctor, I see a big gate.<br> Is it past this?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...Yes...but...be careful...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Uh! What is this? A dragonkin!?<br> Everyone, be extremely careful\u2014</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Ah! I see something near the gate, Master!</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> ...And to think I thought this was just a lot of fun. Pathetic. I feel pathetic.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Poison, miasma, hedonism, and decadence, all mixed up. That means only one thing.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> That ain&#39;t a bunch of little things mixed together.<br> It&#39;s the real aura of an oni.</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Haha!<br> Bwahahahaha!</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> And there you are, Ibaraki-Douji!</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> I wondered who it was. Haha!<br> Who does it turn out to be but Sakata Kintoki!</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> It&#39;s been so damn long! So long!<br> You alone? Where&#39;s Raikou? Where&#39;s Tsuna?</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> You&#39;ve got eyes, don&#39;t you?<br> But you... You ain&#39;t alone, are ya?</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Tell me. What is that?<br> What is that thing floating behind you?</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Hah! This is my master, and my sacrifice!</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Our fallen leader of the oni clan, Shuten-Douji!</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Bwaha! Hahaha! Hahahahaha!</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> \u2014!</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Hah! Ticked off, huh?<br> Even behind that strange blindfold I can tell!</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Your eyes are shining with a burning light.<br> That must&#39;ve ticked you off, huh?</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> \u2014Humph. But I am even more displeased than you. Would the likes of you really care about Shuten?</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> After you tricked her and slew her? Why would you care about Shuten when I am about to eat her?</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> You idiot! I ain&#39;t worried! I don&#39;t care what you do!</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> If you&#39;re gonna fight each other, do it somewhere else! And anyway\u2014</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> You have any idea how dangerous that wench is?<br> After you eat her she&#39;ll devour you from the inside out!</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> \u2013Humph. That&#39;s right.<br> The old me wouldn&#39;t have been able to defeat her.</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> But you know what?<br> \u2014Race forward, Sougenbi!</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Gwaah!?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...What ...happened...?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Some huge flaming thing just flew out and blew Kintoki away!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> And... now it&#39;s coming back!<br> That&#39;s... That&#39;s...</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Tch. Is that...your arm?</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Indeed. Indeed! Indeed! Indeed! This is my arm of destruction! I call it the Great Grudge of Rashomon!</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> She&#39;s got a damn rocket punch!<br> I thought Tsuna hacked that thing off!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> No way... That&#39;s a Noble Phantasm. She&#39;s using her own severed arm as a Noble Phantasm\u2013</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Bwahahaha! Little girl! Little girl! Little girl!<br> Have you ever seen anything like me?</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Then carve this into your mind, so you&#39;ll have something to remember as the maggots eat your guts!</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Raging like a beast! Terrifying like a god!<br> Frivolous like an insect!</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> We know not the weakness of mankind, nor the pride of a warrior! We use our own rotted arms as weapons!</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> That is what an oni is. We are man-eating monsters, who inspire fear by our very presence!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Ugh!</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> ...They&#39;re speaking to me.<br> Yes, someone, somewhere, is saying it.</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> \u2013Devour. Devour. Devour. Devour. Devour. Devour. Devour. Devour. Devour. Devour\u2013</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Devour mankind. Devour you!</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> You are human.

That&#39;s what I meant.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> For instance, by climbing over the gate rather than under it. Or maybe we could find a way to go around it...</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Ahh, so that&#39;s what you meant.<br> Then your objective makes sense, but...</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> We couldn&#39;t possibly climb over the gate.<br> Look at its top.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Yes.

Which is why I&#39;d like to go scout a little and see if we can find a detour around it.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> So how about finding a detour?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes, Master. Let&#39;s check the area again for possible detours before we stop to rest for the night.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Even if we can&#39;t climb over the gate or the enclosing fences, if there&#39;s some other path to the other side...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Maybe our prospects will look better...</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> ...Doesn&#39;t seem like there&#39;s anything.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes.

Now that we&#39;re seeing the west end of the city for the first time, I&#39;ve just realized...</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> There&#39;s a freakin&#39; humongous cliff here for some reason. I almost can&#39;t believe it, but there it is.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> This era... I mean, this Japan right now, must have shrunken or something. Or should I say the islands have been squashed?</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> The topography is crazy. Unexpectedly the ocean is up against Kyoto&#39;s west side...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Right. It does look like there&#39;s something like an island beyond that fog, but since we don&#39;t have a boat...</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> I don&#39;t dislike this golden sense of scale, though.<br> But it looks like there&#39;s no way to make that detour.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> You&#39;re probably right.

Yeah.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Were the two of them friends?<br> Or, were they more like boss and subordinate?</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Ibaraki was the boss of all the oni on Mt. Ooe. Shuten also apparently lived there, as a freeloader\u2014</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> But Ibaraki treated her as her superior, saying Shuten had something she lacked.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> In terms of ranking within the oni clan, they were equals. But that was based solely on Ibaraki&#39;s decree...which caused the kinds of problems you&#39;d expect.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> But I do get where Ibaraki was coming from. That Shuten... She was, I guess you can say, a coward in a lot of ways.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> And she was wicked to the core. But she was honestly good to those she&#39;d formed a kind of bond with.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> I thought she was a spirit of caprice and mischief in the form of an oni, but she&#39;s also chivalrous, dutiful, and humane.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Yeah, she was a natural-born leader, that Shuten-Douji. Though she caused plenty of trouble for her subordinates.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I see, I see.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> And just what the hell are you smiling about, huh?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I beg your pardon. You just seemed oddly gentle while you were saying all that.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> But that boss oni is now being held prisoner by Ibaraki-Douji.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> She seemed to be completely out cold too.<br> I wonder what happened...</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> ...Who knows?

Of course we will.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Let&#39;s take this time to prepare ourselves fully and go into battle in our best possible condition.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Everything we&#39;ve done will be for tomorrow&#39;s decisive battle\u2013</p><h2 id="showdown-defeating-the-oni" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#showdown-defeating-the-oni" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Showdown: Defeating the Oni</h2><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Now get blown away!

We did it!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> She had so much stamina I wondered if it was inexhaustible, but...at last! That was a fatal hit!</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Why? Why were you able to follow me this far?!</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> I stand above all the oni! Humans should not be able to slay me, even if you are Heroic Spirits!</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Don&#39;t be ridiculous, Ibaraki.<br> You&#39;re not above anything.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> You&#39;re just a child pretending to be.<br> You lacked the guts you needed to the very end.</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> How dare you! How could any part of me be deemed lacking!?</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> You really need someone to spell it out for you? I guess you do. Okay, Boss, would you kindly enlighten her?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Basically, you never ate Shuten, did you?</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Hargh\u2014!?<br> Y-You miserable human!</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> How could you utter such a cruel suggestion!?<br> Eat Shuten? I only said that in a hypothetical sense!</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> And you took it literally... Do I really seem like someone who could eat Shuten!?</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> I respect Shuten and haven&#39;t hurt so much as a hair upon her head, you fools! In the first place, I&#39;d be too afraid to! She&#39;d slaughter me!</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> See? Told you this was how Ibaraki was, right?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Yeah, she&#39;s not so...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> What a chicken...</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Y-You little wretch, I don&#39;t know what you called me, but I can sense that it was some kind of dreadful insult. Wasn&#39;t it, human!?</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> What part of me do you dare to call weak!?<br> Speak your name, knave!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> It&#39;s Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> All right, I&#39;ve memorized it. I&#39;ve memorized your name, human! I shall curse it to the end of time! Writhe in mortal terror!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Saying all that was perhaps a bit counter-productive... All the terror I felt for you before has been reversed. Right, Senpai?</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Even the black-clad one is...<br> Why? Why do you not fear me!?</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Jeez, you&#39;re actually pretty funny.<br> Especially because your speech is so melodramatic!</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> I-I can hardly help that!<br> It is the custom of oni to speak in this way!</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Oni must be proud at all times, even in the way we speak! That&#39;s what my mother taught me!</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Right, that&#39;s great.<br> Just go on preserving those proud oni customs then.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> That&#39;s an oni&#39;s strong point and pride, isn&#39;t it?<br> All right, what was this whole farce about?</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> You capture an oni despite being an oni yourself, then serve humans alcohol hoping we&#39;ll self-destruct?</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> That&#39;s not like you at all. It&#39;s because you drink more than you can handle. So go wash your face and come back again.</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Ulp, gulp!</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> All right, then. I acknowledge it was my loss this time! And I&#39;ll acknowledge you humans&#39; so-called guts!</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> But my horns remain unbroken!

The power I sense from her is very weak.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> Oh, you&#39;re right.<br> I was wondering where all my strength had gone.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> Looks like most of my power got absorbed by Ibaraki. Oh dear. That shouldn&#39;t be possible, huh?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Do you remember...what happened?</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> A little. So I know you tried really hard to save me, didn&#39;t you, boy?</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> I did not! You were just a bonus!</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> Fufu. I was only half-awake, but I got to feel like a trapped princess.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> It was a new experience... I liked it.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> Oh, right.

I guess I can&#39;t spend all my time playing with the boy. ...I&#39;ll take you there. Follow me.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> Look, this is what you&#39;re searching for, isn&#39;t it?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That&#39;s...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> The Holy Grail...or at least, something that looks very similar!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I&#39;m sure of it.<br> What you&#39;re looking at is the root cause of all this!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> It seems filled with some kind of fluid. That&#39;s...</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> I just woke up here with Ibaraki somehow, and this thing was right in front of us.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> And it was filled with delicious wine.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Um... You didn&#39;t.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> Yup. I drank it.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Something so obviously suspicious?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I don&#39;t want to ask, but why?</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> That&#39;s just who she is.<br> I bet Ibaraki didn&#39;t want to, though.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> Of course, Ibaraki was scared. She said it was a bad idea to eat things you find on the ground.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> But when I asked her if it she was too good for my wine, she gave in and drank it down with tears in her eyes.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Ibaraki...<br> You should&#39;ve been nicer to her...</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> And then after I drank for a while, I got sleepy.<br> And then I woke up like this.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> Ibaraki absorbed my power, and I became a trapped princess, and the boy came after my body and soul...</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> I did not!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I-I see. But in the end, you don&#39;t know what this is either?</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> No, I don&#39;t, but I do know this: this is wine and I drank it.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> And you know how it ended up, right? So the answer is plain. This is\u2013wine that grants wishes.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> !!!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Wine poured into a Grail... Its role as an omnipotent wish granter activated... But is that really possible?</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> Come to think of it, I&#39;ve been hearing someone&#39;s voice for a while.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> I thought maybe I was just drunk... Is it an onmyouji?<br> He sounds like a wimp... Well, it doesn&#39;t matter.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> Just so you&#39;re clear, this wine doesn&#39;t grant the wish itself.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> It grants the wish in your heart, but\u2013it twists it first.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> Wine makes you drunk, and leads to bewilderment... Maybe that&#39;s why. That&#39;s what makes it fun, though.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I see\u2013which means that wine vaporized and spread through the air,</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> and made all the normal people who couldn&#39;t fight it \u201Cdrunk.\u201D</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> That&#39;s why everyone in the Kyoto area was acting so strangely.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Some people can handle their drink better than others. I&#39;m glad Fujimaru was okay...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...By the way, Mash.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> What would you do if a paper plane flew towards Fujimaru right now?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Say it was a paper plane thrown by the world champion paper plane thrower with a world record on the line.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That&#39;s quite an undertaking... A new world record must involve a lot of suffering and drama, I assume.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> But I would immediately deploy my Noble Phantasm. Senpai&#39;s safety is my first priority.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> (...Mash is tipsy too.)</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Wait a second. Does that mean it&#39;s not just humans who get drunk here...but Servants too?</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> I think so. Ibaraki&#39;s wish was probably to go on a rampage with me...</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> But that got twisted into going on a rampage with my power.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I&#39;m not being affected, so it&#39;s okay...<br> But what about Mr. Golden?</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> My wish...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Come to think of it, you said you felt a lot stronger.<br> Was that it?</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> Oh\u2014you wished for the same thing, huh?<br> Did you want to play with me that much?</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> To hit each other with our exposed parts, staring into each other&#39;s eyes, moaning like beasts\u2013</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> N-No! A-Are you stupid or something? Of course not!</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> Sorry... I can&#39;t take you up on that offer the way I am right now.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> But you worked some of that out with Ibaraki, right?<br> I guess you ended up with the wrong girl.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> Now then, I remember the kind of wine I drank, so\u2014<br> Let&#39;s smash it.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That&#39;s right. This thing is the cause of it all anyway.<br> We can&#39;t end this unless we destroy it.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> ...Hey.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> What?</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> You... What was your wish?</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> ...Fufu. What do you think?</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Tch. Hell if I know.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> You&#39;re worried about me, aren&#39;t you? You&#39;re so cute... Both your body and your soul.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> I like to mess around\u2014but I especially like men who only have one love.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> It&#39;s a shame to get rid of this wine...<br> But I guess we don&#39;t have a choice.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> This wine makes you drunk on your own wishes.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> And when you&#39;re drunk, things always seem twisted. This time it was especially bad. It twists you, yourself.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> This goes for Ibaraki too, but I&#39;ve been far too twisted.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> I&#39;ve got no power, I can&#39;t eat people, I can&#39;t attack the boy... I&#39;m just a little girl. This isn&#39;t me.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> So I can&#39;t drink it down.<br> I can&#39;t just doze and enjoy the wine.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> No matter how much I&#39;ve longed to see what I see when I open my eyes\u2014</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> This is just\u2014a dream, brought on by too much drinking.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> And now it&#39;s time to wake up.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Oh\u2013 Yes! We did it!<br> The cause of the abnormality is gone!</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> Now that I&#39;m awake...<br> It&#39;s time to go get drunk again.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> Once I am, I won&#39;t let you get away, boy.<br> I swear\u2013I&#39;ll pay you back for last time.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> And then you can pour me drinks as part of my harem of hotties... Fufu...</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> See you around.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> She looked so satisfied as she disappeared...<br> What did she want, anyway?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I&#39;m not sure, but I think I can guess.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I think maybe since you were worried about her so much...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> She brought you here so she could laugh and tell you not to worry?</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> ...Tch. What the heck?<br> That just makes me worry more.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> ...Man, this ain&#39;t golden at all.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> ...Anyway, looks like my role here&#39;s done.<br> I might see you guys again somewhere, though.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Just be careful.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Yes. Not all the mysteries have been solved.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> She said that there was a cup filled with wine placed in front of her. Which means\u2013</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Who put the cup there\u2013<br> And who filled it with wine?</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> ...Who knows? If there was somebody behind it, this ain&#39;t over yet. Something else will happen.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> But this is all for now. The oni of Rashomon are gone.<br> So I&#39;m leaving.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> There are no Servants left.<br> We can assume we&#39;re finished here.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Good work, Mash.<br> Good work, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes. Let&#39;s head back to Chaldea, Senpai.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...<br> (Staring)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> What is it, Mash?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...I&#39;m sorry. I was a little curious what would happen if you were to get drunk...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Um, if you&#39;d like, I&#39;d be happy to have some alcohol with you after dinner.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It&#39;s fine. I probably won&#39;t get drunk.<br> I&#39;ve learned that this time.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Well? Well? Will you drink with me? This is a chance to let me see a side of you I don&#39;t usually get to see.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Mash, are you still drunk?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Someone bring water!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Um, guys.
