I believe there are certain topics that are best left alone.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The Nezha that we know appears to be the most similar to the version from \u201CJourney to the West\u201D...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The Nezha of \u201CInvestiture of the Gods\u201D seems like a better fit for a Berserker than a Lancer...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> But Nezha is...hard to define. So many characteristics and aspects are jumbled together.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> In \u201CInvestiture of the Gods,\u201D many supernatural beings and spirits of various time periods assemble and participate in a bloody melee.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> It&#39;s like Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> If you&#39;re likening \u201CInvestiture of the Gods\u201D to an all-star battle set during the Ming Dynasty, you would not be far off the mark.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Though, I would prefer to not use the word \u201Cmelee\u201D...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Both Heroic Spirits and humans have hidden sides.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> True...it&#39;s not right to judge others by rumors or titles alone.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> On one hand, Nezha is enshrined as a god in China and Southeast Asia, even in modern times.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Don&#39;t you think it&#39;s odd for a god to be depicted as a youth?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I was very curious about that,<br> and that&#39;s why I went to the library...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Why don&#39;t we just ask Nezha?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Wouldn&#39;t...that be too...bold of us?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> With so many aspects, maybe there are some she would prefer be left alone? Still...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Long have I awaited this day...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Senpai.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> This is that legendary drink called \u201Ccoffee.\u201D<br> It&#39;s black, so please drink it all down.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Everyone is my teacher in life,<br> and they are also my friends...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Even were it necessary for a mission,<br> I&#39;d like to avoid anything that could hurt them...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Though...my curiosity may be winning out over all that...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Um...Nezha&#39;s schedule for today is...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It appears that she is participating in a meeting run by the \u201CBuddhist Club.\u201D</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> That&#39;s new. Where do they meet?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> This is the first I heard of the group, as well.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I&#39;ve heard of groups like \u201COld Men Seriously Reading Fairytales\u201D and \u201CAir Basketball Club\u201D...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> How do you know about this club?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Because I&#39;m aware of all the clubs that are active in Chaldea!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Well...at least I wanted to be.<br> I may have exaggerated a bit...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> So actually, an anonymous Japanese Lancer came to me to discuss something, and that&#39;s how I heard about it.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The meeting is held...in the simulator room, it seems.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I can even hear the sounds of battle all the way out here. I can only assume that an extensive training session is underway.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Forcing my way in.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Ah, Senpai!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I&#39;d like to join the club.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> If it&#39;s a Buddhist Club, would the conditions to join the club be renouncing the world and becoming a monk?</p><hr><p><strong>--ARROW--:</strong></p><p><strong>Nezha:</strong><br> Master!<br> Have. No need. For assistance. Or strategizing.</p><p><strong>Nezha:</strong><br> This is training!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I know!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> That&#39;s why I wanted to join.</p><hr><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> Wonderful, Lord Nezha.<br> Such superb fighting technique!</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> My naginata is certainly getting a workout.<br> Your mystical spear is especially ravishing!</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> And this is called the Fire-Tipped Spear?</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> Well, you are more than qualified to join our Buddhist Club!</p><p><strong>Nezha:</strong><br> ...??? Do not. Understand.</p><p><strong>Nezha:</strong><br> Buddhist Club? More like. Feudist club!</p><p><strong>Nezha:</strong><br> But. You helped me train...<br> You were. Enthusiastic. Thank you. For that.</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> Huh? When did this turn into a club admission test?</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> Actually, we welcome anyone and everyone to our Buddhist gathering.</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> But honestly, I was beyond excited when I learned that Nezha had come to Chaldea!</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> I&#39;d be happy to spend time with you!<br> Not just when we&#39;re training, either!</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> From eating vegetarian sweets, picking out a priest&#39;s stole, temple hopping...I&#39;m game for anything!</p><p><strong>Nezha:</strong><br> You just want. Me to indulge. Your desires.</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> ...Um...</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> I&#39;m all for being wrapped in the warm embrace of friends old and new...</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> But I do not remember...EVER...joining such a club.</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> What I DO remember is being grabbed and dragged in here. Isn&#39;t this kidnapping!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...R-really? I was wondering why you were here.</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> Well, I&#39;m relieved to know that at least SOMEONE is concerned about me!</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> Oh, but if Master is considering joining, I may be more inclined to do so, too. So, all&#39;s well that ends well!</p><p><strong>Nezha:</strong><br> Don&#39;t go. Near...Master! Evil fox spirit!!!</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> MIKON!?<br> The end of my poor tail is on fire!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Nezha!?<br> She just used her Fire-Tipped Spear!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> What&#39;s going on!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> We&#39;re not in the simulator anymore!</p><hr><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> If I may explain...<br> Lord Nezha requested a match with Lady Tamamo.</p><p><strong>Nezha:</strong><br> No. Not just a match.<br> I am going. To kill her. KILL!</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> WHAAAT!?</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> No wonder it felt like you were just going after me!<br> I don&#39;t understand this sudden assault against me!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Let me guess...does Nezha see Tamamo as the character from the \u201CInvestiture of the Gods\u201D...?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That is, the fox spirit, Daji, who is said to have caused the decline of the Shang dynasty!?</p><p><strong>Nezha:</strong><br> Yes! Correct!</p><p><strong>Nezha:</strong><br> She is. The unparalleled trickster. Brutal. Conniving fox! She will. Surely cause. Chaldea&#39;s downfall!</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> Oh, really?</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> So, so...were you also Lady Huangyang from Tianzhu all that time ago? She was pretty foxy, too.</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> Hmmm...hmmm...<br> Tamamo doesn&#39;t know\u2661</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> I can neither confirm nor deny such a thing... I&#39;m a little fuzzy when it comes to my past life and stuff...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Even so, that has nothing to do with the Tamamo in Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> Oh, Master...!</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> Ah, that&#39;s our Master. Your acceptance and generosity toward others is more vast than any ocean!</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> Yes! That&#39;s my disciple you&#39;re talking about!</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> But...I will have a word with you later,<br> Benkei, for starting this whole kerfuffle.</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> Hmgh!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Fight, and whoever wins shall be my consort!</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> Mikon!? I heard something just like that in my previous life! Ah, that brings back memories... Now I&#39;m all fired up!</p><p><strong>Nezha:</strong><br> C-consort!?<br> I-I refuse! Why ME!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That&#39;s right, Senpai!<br> Please do not tease them like that!</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> That&#39;s right, my disciple! If we&#39;re going to do it, it&#39;ll have to be fair and square! Like in a tournament!</p><p><strong>Nezha:</strong><br> X-Xuanzang!<br> You half-witted monk!</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> Leaving the consort issue aside...</p><hr><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> Fated enemies... Such encounters are bound to happen in a place where Servants assemble.</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> Nezha&#39;s grudge would probably have come up at some point.</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> But since she came by seeking help from our club...</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> I am not asking for help, not this shrine maiden\u2661</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> Leaving the source of the dispute alone would likely affect future activities for Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> Now, you two...</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> Since we have the simulator here, why don&#39;t we banish our worldly desires here?</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> Hm...what are you suggesting?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> A one-on-one all-out...battle?</p><hr><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> Yep. That&#39;s right.</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> Personally, I prefer not to believe that Tamamo is a bad Heroic Spirit...</p><p><strong>Nezha:</strong><br> Xuanzang...</p><p><strong>Nezha:</strong><br> That. Is quite. A grand sentiment.</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> ...One-on-one!? (Ears twitching)</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> ...Teehee. That&#39;s the spirit.</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> You started this, so you won&#39;t mind if I hit back full-force, right?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Tamamo is quite riled up.</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> Very well. I accept your challenge!</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> And then I will assume the position of reliable consort, once and for all! Please watch, Master\u2606</p><p><strong>Nezha:</strong><br> I thought. We dropped. The idea.<br> Of becoming. Master&#39;s consort?</p><p><strong>Nezha:</strong><br> !!!</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> Now, this will be a fair and square one-on-one fight! And your opponent will be ME!</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> Don&#39;t you dare say you&#39;ve never seen anything like this in Chaldea! Just come at me!</p><p><strong>Nezha:</strong><br> Body clones!? Divided Spirits!?<br> Oh, yes!</p><p><strong>Nezha:</strong><br> Even I. Know. Three-faced. Six-armed. Battle techniques. I shall. Be your. Greatest Opponent!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Nezha:</strong><br> I won! It is my! Victory!</p><p><strong>Nezha:</strong><br> Even if. The evil. Fox spirit. Goes mad.<br> Everything should. Be fine. Since I. Am here!</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> I...lost...unnnghhh... The path to becoming the perfect Servant...cannot be walked in a single day...</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> But it was a grand battle.</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> You think so? I think Nezha needs more training.</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> Growing is good, especially for Nezha,<br> who will always remain in her childhood form.</p><p><strong>Nezha:</strong><br> I once. Sealed away. Ninety-six demons.<br> So three. Or even. A hundred. Demons\u2013</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I&#39;m counting on you, Nezha.</p><p><strong>Nezha:</strong><br> Oh...Master...</p><p><strong>Nezha:</strong><br> Okay! Got it!</p><p><strong>Nezha:</strong><br> I will focus. And work. My hardest!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Thanks for holding back, Tamamo.</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> Master... Of course...</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> As the shrine maiden with a permanent spot reserved at Master&#39;s side, it&#39;s the least I can do\u2606</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> So it appears that Nezha not only possesses memories from \u201CJourney to the West,\u201D but also from the \u201CInvestiture of the Gods.\u201D</p><p><strong>Nezha:</strong><br> Yes. That is. Just another. Part of. My past.</p><p><strong>Nezha:</strong><br> The \u201Cme.\u201D From then. Always sought. New enemies.<br> And I was. Violent... Dangerous...</p><p><strong>Nezha:</strong><br> I was. Like...a Berserker. I had. No right.<br> To bad-mouth. The Great Sage. Heaven&#39;s Equal.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> What kind of person do you want to be now, Nezha?</p><hr><p><strong>Nezha:</strong><br> Master...</p><p><strong>Nezha:</strong><br> I...I...honestly...</p><p><strong>Nezha:</strong><br> Rather than. A strong god. Of martial arts. I want to be. A good god. One who. Is kind. To children.</p><p><strong>Nezha:</strong><br> I hated. And cursed. My parents. Especially Father.</p><p><strong>Nezha:</strong><br> Even now. Even with. My soul. Wandering so. The flame. Within me. Has yet. To be. Fully extinguished.</p><p><strong>Nezha:</strong><br> And so. I wish. To cherish. The young. I want. To Protect. Children. And save them. From going through. What I. Once did...</p><p><strong>Nezha:</strong><br> My desires...may not. Match up.<br> With other. Strong people&#39;s...</p><p><strong>Nezha:</strong><br> They may. Not fit. A Servant. Of Chaldea...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> No! That&#39;s not true, Nezha.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> We welcome Nezha with open arms!<br> Right, Senpai!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Of course.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> There is strength in kindness.</p><hr><p><strong>Nezha:</strong><br> ...I see.<br> Then...I&#39;m relieved. Master...thank you.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Hey, by the way...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> There&#39;s something I&#39;ve been curious about...</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Senpai...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> There&#39;s a subject we haven&#39;t addressed...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Take a look at this list, and tell me which one you identify with...</p><hr><p><strong>Nezha:</strong><br> ...Hm?</p><p><strong>Nezha:</strong><br> \u201CMale,\u201D \u201CFemale,\u201D \u201CBoth,\u201D \u201CNone,\u201D \u201CBeep-boop,\u201D \u201CAstrodroid,\u201D \u201CNon-binary\u201D...</p><p><strong>Nezha:</strong><br> ...HMMMMMMMMMMM!?</p><p><strong>Nezha:</strong><br> NO, Master!
