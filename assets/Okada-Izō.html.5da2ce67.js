The hitokiri of Tosa that is counted as of the Four Great Hitokiri of the Bakumatsu together with Tanaka Shinbei, Nakamura Hanjir\u014D, Kawakami Gensai.</p><p>He studied under Takechi Zuizan[3], followed Takeichi in his travels to Edo, and learned several fencing styles such as Ono-ha Itt\u014D-ry\u016B, Ky\u014Dshin Meichi-ry\u016B, Jikishi-ry\u016B fencing style, etc.[4]<br> After that, he joined the Tosa Kinn\u014Dt\u014D[5] formed by Takechi, and went to the capital with Takechi and others.</p><p>In the Tosa Kinn\u014Dt\u014D, dedicated to the imperial restoration movement, he performed a collective punishment called Tench\u016B against the members of hostile forces, and from those deeds he would be called and feared as \u300CHitokiri Iz\u014D\u300D for posterity.<br> Initially he built a favorable relationship with Takechi, but they naturally distanced themselves due to his roughness and quick temper, and started losing his place in the Tosa Kinn\u014Dt\u014D.</p><p>He later ran away and headed to Edo, and freeloaded under Takasugi Shinsaku[6]. Even though Takasugi went to the capital by feudal decree, Iz\u014D returned to the capital as well, but at that time he drowned in sake and women and since he started falling in debt repeatedly, he was abandoned by those around him.<br> At one point, he worked as an escort for Katsu Kaish\u016B[7] with the introduction of Sakamoto Ry\u014Dma but it didn\u2019t last long, and he eventually ruined himself to the point of being homeless.<br> When the power of the Tosa Kinn\u014Dt\u014D declined with the later political change, Iz\u014D, who had become a homeless wanderer, was captured and transported to Tosa.</p><p>In an investigation at Tosa, he made several confessions regarding the murder of Yoshida T\u014Dy\u014D[8] and a series of assassination cases in the capital, and those who were newly arrested due to that appeared one after another.<br> Even plans by his comrades to poison Iz\u014D surfaced, but they weren\u2019t put into practice.

Initially, I thought of an outfit with a military cap and an inverness cape for the 1st stage, but it was FGO-nized while being advised by Keikenchi-sensei, and he turned into an assassin that wears a scarf to conceal his face. (But I really like the original design, so it\u2019d be nice if there was someday a chance for it to come out) Thereafter, feel free! It\u2019s what they said, so the 2nd stage is the hitokiri mode that shook Ky\u014Dto, the 3rd stage has the image of Iz\u014D-san in his golden age (like when he escorted Katsu-sensei). Also, while I was looking at reference data about Iz\u014D-san, I felt a side of him that wasn\u2019t just a thug like for example his feeling of admiration towards Niten-sama (Miyamoto Musashi). Incorporating these elements into each stage, it turned into the final design.
