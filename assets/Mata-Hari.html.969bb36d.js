Margaretha Geertruida Zelle, also known as Mata Hari, was born as the eldest daughter of a wealthy household in Amsterdam[1], Netherlands. However, Margaretha\u2019s happy days have signalled their end because of her parents\u2019 bankruptcy. After the breakup of her family, Margaretha made an effort to study under the guidance of her guardian as much as possible to become a kindergarten teacher, but because her school\u2019s headmaster had a blatant meddling affair with her, she was evicted by her guardian.</p><p>Thereafter, after her own marriage and divorce, Margaretha debuted as the dancer \u201CMata Hari\u201D in Paris. Mata Hari is the Sun, the name standing for \u2018Eye of the Day\u2019 in the Malay language, and it seems that Margaretha has been named as such by her employer who was pleased with her exotic appearance.</p><p>Mata Hari shared the bed with a great number of people as not only a dancer, but as a harlot too. Some of her clients were foreigners whom visited Paris, some of them being high-ranking military officers, politicians, etc., and it is believed that at this time, she was operating behind the scenes as a spy.</p><p>\u2026 Regarding Mata Hari\u2019s spying activities, no clear evidence could be procured. At the time of being 41 years old, Mata Hari was executed as a double agent of France as well as of Germany. However, both the French and German sides whom executed her did not particularly believe her to be a spy who extracted important intelligence, and it is even said that she was treated, at most, as somebody who sold secret information to some degree.</p><p>At any rate, being granted that, France took advantage of this convenient situation and just pushed all their military failures onto Mata Hari. Due to their inept military operations, and also because a scapegoat was presented to them, she was accused of being a spy who had leaked information on France, and it resulted in the existence of Mata Hari being carved into history.</p><p>There are various episodes that talk about Mata Hari, such as one where she claimed \u201CThere\u2019s no man who could shoot me\u201D at the time of her execution as she became naked, her beauty causing those nearby to go crazy for her, so the shooters wore blindfolds in order to avoid that, but those episodes were probably exaggerated as one would expect.</p><p>Was Mata Hari truly a spy, or was she just a common secret information broker? The original name of a beautiful woman trifled by fate has been completely forgotten, and only her usual stage name has become a legend.</p><h2 id="related-characters" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#related-characters" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Related Characters</h2><p><strong>Boudica</strong></p><p>Being of the type of that nature, Mata Hari is not able to have a particularly close relationship with another Servant, but among other things, she is relatively on good terms with Boudica, who arrived at an untimely death much like herself.</p><h2 id="comment-from-the-illustrator" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#comment-from-the-illustrator" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Comment from the Illustrator</h2><p>You know, I agreed that it would be nice if I drew an erotic elder sister, so I designed one as this dancer and female spy. Mata Hari\u2019s usual personality is full of positivity, so with that being the case, she does not make me have an impure feeling in designing her as such. Well, at first, it even looked like there was such a scene where Mata Hari attacks with the cloths on her arms\u2026</p><p>Although I submitted various colouring plans for Mata Hari, there was even one among those draft plans where she has something like tanned skin. For her character performance, although she is regarded as someone extraordinarily difficult to use, I felt happy since I received numerous reports saying she had been raised up to her Final Ascension.
