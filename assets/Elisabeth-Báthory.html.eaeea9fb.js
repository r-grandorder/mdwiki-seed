Hence, the madness has made her confuse between her way of being as a noble\u2019s daughter and her affliction of nightmare.</p><p>High-classed, domineering, atrocious, ruthless. All the inhumane qualities as her legend had shown themselves. ...And yet, she herself is a maiden who dream of love. Her timid nature becoming her own ruin; looking at only the result, she helped her comrades,overlooked her enemies, and fell in love with her Master. She ends up showing the barest of line of humane goodness; basically \u201CWell, can\u2019t really say she is not a Heroic Spirit.\u201D</p><p>She herself dislikes being described as \u201CYou\u2019re actually a good person, aren\u2019t you?\u201D</p><p>To add, due to her not showing interest to anything but her own beauty, in actuality she is extremely estranged from knowledge and experience that are sexual in nature.</p><p>When summoned again as a Servant, she becomes aware of the job known as \u201CJapanese idol\u201D, and from that day after she proclaims herself as the Idol Servant, completely and seriously devoting her body and soul in playing the part of an idol.</p><p>As a result, she ends up looking like a girl who didn\u2019t know any better. For Liz, the existence known as idol is the first that had ever gave her such a \u201Cgirlish happiness\u201D. She has absolute confidence in her singing voice, but her music sense way too distant from the norm; for normal people her singing ends up to be just a form of torture.</p><h2 id="attitude-towards-master" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#attitude-towards-master" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Attitude Towards Master</h2><p>As a Servant, she is friendly and acknowledges the magus that is her Master as someone who understands the uniqueness of summoning a super idol like her. She would diligently lend him/her a hand.</p><p>She has a strong responsibility towards the job she has been assigned to, and would mostly cooperate with the Master\u2019s objective.</p><p>While that attitude of hers stems from how she was born as a noble who engages in ruling and controlling the masses in a serious manner, as far as Liz is concerned \u201Crule\u201D and \u201Ccontrol\u201D are, in other words, torture.</p><p>Her thoughts come from how hurting humans for her is the usual state of things no different from breathing, and she is utterly cruel and merciless towards the enemies. Because she completely does not understand the pain of others, there perhaps exist within her lineage circumstances the disposition of recognizing for the first time that \u201Cthis living being is a human\u201D upon seeing others in pain.</p><h2 id="dialogue-examples" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#dialogue-examples" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Dialogue Examples</h2><p>\u201CYou held your head too high; kneel immediately and look up to my beauty!

Born 1560, died 1614. Born in the House of Bathory, a noble house of Hungary who had made the dragon\u2019s fang their crest. She is related with the one who had become the model of the vampire Dracula, Vlad III of Wallachia. She herself is the model for Joseph Sheridan le Fanu\u2019s mystery novel \u201CVampire Carmilla\u201D.</p><p>The House of Bathory was a noble family possessing influence in most of Eastern Europe range. On top of that, she also drew lineage from the House of Hapsburg; truly a lineage that can be said to be a thoroughbred noble.</p><p>However, House of Bathory\u2019s consanguineous marriage and luxuriant environment makes many of them to be mad and atrocious. Elizabeth is not an exception. Her name had become known throughout the world for her heinous acts.</p><p>For her, preserving her beauty is a must; in Csejte Castle, in her personal territory of what is now known as modern Slovakia, she had slaughtered no less than 600 women. All of them then had their blood squeezed out, and she had made a bath out of it\u2026 having a taste for repulsive bloodbath.</p><h2 id="character-in-fgo" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#character-in-fgo" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Character in FGO</h2><p>Pushing aside the other Servants, she managed to appear 3 times in the main story during the first, second, and fifth chapter. And even in the Halloween Event \u201CAdventure of the Castle of Singing Pumpkin\u201D, albeit as a different Servant, she managed to put herself as well as a Caster Class. In the story, she appearing is pretty much a running gag already.</p><p>She refers only to the Protagonist with a special nickname, just like how she does so to the protagonist of \u201CFate/EXTRA CCC\u201D, as \u201Cpuppy/kitten\u201D.</p><h2 id="depiction-in-past-works" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#depiction-in-past-works" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Depiction in Past Works</h2><p>In Fate/EXTRA CCC, she appeared with Tohsaka Rin as her Master\u2026. although, she kept on being defeated by the protagonist, reappearing again and again as she changes Master and Class, and at last, even ends up making a contract temporarily as the protagonist\u2019s Servant. Even in FGO, she goes all out in showing that guts of hers to keep on appearing like that.</p><h2 id="related-characters" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#related-characters" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Related Characters</h2><p><strong>Nero</strong></p><p>A rival whom she sympathize with in a shared mind and opinion as an idol.
