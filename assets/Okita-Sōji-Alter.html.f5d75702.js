For whatever reason, it seems to have something akin to autonomous thought and its effectiveness varies greatly according to how it\u2019s feeling about the user.

That\u2019s also why she was summoned as an Alter Ego instead of in Okita\u2019s most suitable Class, Saber.</p><p>A potential final state Okita Souji could have attained had her not passed away too young.</p><h2 id="attitude-towards-master" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#attitude-towards-master" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Attitude Towards Master</h2><p>She was not supposed to get a Master, only to manifest as a Counter Guardian once and disappear, so she\u2019s very emotionally attached to the one who basically enabled her connection to the world.<br> It\u2019s unknown whether or not she understands or not what exactly this means.</p><h2 id="dialogue-examples" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#dialogue-examples" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Dialogue Examples</h2><p>\u201CI am the slasher of demons, the piercer of gods, the ensemble of human prayer.\u201D</p><p>\u201CThrough the light of infinity which pierces the myriad ksetra, I sever your karma.

That\u2019s most likely why she often reacts to things like a child would.</p><p>Her combat style mostly takes Okita&#39;s as its base, but she has her own unique additions, including a Magic Resistance rank high enough for someone made under the premise of fighting against the supernatural and an area-of-effect attack for annihilation purposes.<br> On the heat of battle, she tried throwing her sword once, but she learned not to do that because it angered Purgatory. But she still sometimes forgets and throws it.
