I chose this place because I was told there would be no interruptions here.&quot;</p><p>The knight in red suddenly gets up.</p><p>Did his ears hear the sound of the intruder?</p><p>Footsteps echo through the silent castle.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015Wow. I&#39;m surprised, Tohsaka. I was dubious, but you really are here.&quot;</p><p>A voice echoes.</p><p>The rude intruder is a boy called Matou Shinji.</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh, don&#39;t do anything violent, okay?</p><p>I don&#39;t have any business with you. You have no business with Tohsaka either, right? Then isn&#39;t it meaningless for us to fight here?&quot;</p><p>Matou Shinji walks forward with light steps.</p><p>He is looking at Tohsaka, who is tied up.</p><p>The girl glares silently at the intruder.</p><p>That must delight him.</p><p>He licks his lips in satisfaction and walks to the girl.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>&quot;What?&quot;</p><p>Stared down by the knight, Matou Shinji looks up in annoyance.</p><p>&quot;What, you want to fight me? Are you serious? You&#39;d be no match for me!&quot;</p><p>He smiles and turns back to the entrance.</p><hr><p>There stands a man with golden hair\u2015\u2015\u2015the eighth Servant, Gilgamesh.</p><p>He is, literally, a disaster.</p><p>The golden Servant looks at the knight with cool eyes.</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015But within them...</p><p>The red eyes only show the intent to brutally kill the enemy in front of him.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>The knight in red is still silent.</p><p>It makes no difference even if Matou Shinji appears or if the strongest Servant is ready to attack him.</p><p>The knight calmly stares at the uninvited enemies.</p><hr><p>&quot;Haha. You&#39;re scared, right? It&#39;s nothing to be ashamed of. He even killed Berserker. It&#39;s natural for you to be scar\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015Do you want Rin, Matou Shinji?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Huh...? Y-Yeah, of course. There&#39;s no other reason for me to come to this castle.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;I see. Then wait until this is over. I will give her to you after I kill Emiya Shirou.</p><p>She is mine until then. It cannot be helped if you cannot compromise on that. \u2015\u2015\u2015It will be regrettable, but you will die here, Gilgamesh.&quot;</p><p>The knight&#39;s eyes remain on the golden Servant as he speaks.</p><hr><p>&quot;Very funny, you fool.&quot;</p><p>Were those words reason enough for the man to kill Archer?</p><p>The golden Servant identifies the knight in front of him as a target he must kill.</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh. Hold on, Gilgamesh. Don&#39;t be rash, and let&#39;s be smart. Come on, he says he&#39;s going to give her to me, so I&#39;ll let him.</p><p>Archer doesn&#39;t have a Master. I&#39;m sure no Master would make a contract with a Servant that betrayed so many people, so he&#39;ll disappear if we let him be. I can take Tohsaka after that.&quot;</p><hr><p>Matou Shinji smiles and stares at the knight in red.</p><p>It looks as if he is enjoying the fate of the one who is about to disappear.</p><hr><p>&quot;You&#39;re smart, Matou Shinji. That&#39;s an intelligent decision. You are a most fitting Master, in a sense.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh, you show promise! How wasteful! I would&#39;ve made a contract with you if you came to me!&quot;</p><p>Stepping away from the knight, Matou Shinji claps his hands happily.</p><hr><p>&quot;But I&#39;m sorry. I don&#39;t need any more Servants. It&#39;s unfortunate, but you&#39;ll have to disappear.&quot;</p><p>&quot;You do not need to tell me. So what will you do? Will you fight me, or wait until I disappear?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Yeah, I&#39;ll wait. You&#39;re pretty decent, so we&#39;ll protect Tohsaka until you kill Emiya.</p><p>But, yeah. That thing is mine already, right? Then I can do anything to her, right?&quot;</p><hr><p>He stares at the knight and Tohsaka Rin with snake-like eyes.</p><p>His words are to test the loyalty of the knight.</p><p>To that...</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015I have promised Emiya Shirou that she will not be harmed. But that promise is over at dawn. You can do as you wish when the time comes.&quot;</p><p>The knight in red replies in an emotionless voice.</p><hr><p>&quot;Ha\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Haha, hahahahahahahahahaha!</p><p>Did you hear that, Tohsaka!? Your Servant is selling off his Master!&quot;</p><p>Sneering laughter echoes in the dirty room.</p><p>The knight exits as if he&#39;s not interested.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>Archer passes by Gilgamesh.</p><p>Archer ignores his mocking gaze and walks into the hallway.</p><p>At that instant...</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Faker.&quot;</p><p>The king of heroes says so as if despising him.</p><hr><h2 id="scene-25" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#scene-25" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Scene 25</h2><p>It&#39;s daybreak.</p><p>There is less conversation as we make our way through the forest, and the silence gets heavier.</p><p>I, Emiya Shirou, must fight that man when we get to the castle.</p><p>There is no chance of victory, and a certain loss awaits.</p><p>I know I&#39;ll just be killed once we start fighting.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>I&#39;m not scared, but it&#39;s not because I&#39;m prepared for it.</p><p>If you talk about dying, that man is already dead.</p><p>It is equivalent for Emiya Shirou to be dead the moment I figured that out.</p><p>That being the case, I have no reason to worry.</p><hr><p>We go through the castle gate.</p><p>Saber looks gloomy, maybe because she knows what kind of a fight awaits us.</p><hr><p>What&#39;s troubling her is him and me.</p><p>No matter who gets killed and who survives, the one to be eliminated is the same.</p><p>Her desire to stop this ridiculous fight is causing her pain.</p><p>Her eyes stare at the sky sharply, and maybe she&#39;s angry at the meaningless battle.</p><hr><p>The hall is a ruin now.</p><p>This place, covered with the morning mist, will become our place of death.</p><p>&quot;You&#39;re finally here.

There shouldn&#39;t be two of that pendant. That pendant is...&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes. That is the pendant you held on to throughout your life after you were saved. It is the one and only memento of Tohsaka Rin&#39;s father.&quot;</p><hr><p>It is impossible that two such pendants should exist.</p><p>If Emiya Shirou held on to the pendant throughout his life as he says, then...</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015A catalyst is always needed to summon a heroic spirit.</p><p>As when you summoned Saber, there has to be a connection between the summoner and the one summoned.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Tohsaka Rin did not have a catalyst to summon a heroic spirit.</p><p>Therefore, she thought that she had no connection with the Servant she summoned.</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015But no heroic spirit is summoned by chance.

It is when the heroic spirit has a catalyst connected to the summoner.&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015!&quot;</p><hr><p>The jewel is the only one of its kind.</p><p>My life was saved, but I did not know who saved me. So I held on to the pendant which I thought belonged to my savior.</p><p>...That&#39;s the answer.</p><p>If he has Tohsaka&#39;s pendant, then there is only one person who he can be.</p><hr><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Heroic spirit Emiya.</p><p>The future me.</p><p>The heroic spirit before me is Emiya Shirou, who perfected his skills and made his ideal come true.</p><hr><p>The knight in red\u2015\u2015\u2015Archer looks down at me from the top of the stairs.</p><p>There&#39;s no one around him.</p><p>He is standing alone in this vast hall.</p><hr><p>&quot;Archer. Where&#39;s Tohsaka?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I have left her somewhere in this castle. You should hurry if you are worried about her. You were late, so I gave her to Matou Shinji, since he came earlier.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Wh\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015at?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I kept my promise with you. I will not harm her.</p><p>But it does not concern me what other people do to her.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;But, the result is pretty obvious. Matou Shinji feels hatred and lust towards Tohsaka Rin. One does not need to think what he will do to her. He might not be able to restrain himself if she provokes him, so he might be killing and raping her right now.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015!&quot;</p><p>I get pissed off.</p><p>How can he say such a thing so calmly\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015!?</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh, don&#39;t get impatient, kid. Leave that girl to me.</p><p>I&#39;ll go save her.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Eh... Lancer?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;It&#39;s an order from my Master. My entire reason for joining you was to keep that girl from dying.</p><p>...Still, this was rather comfortable. I didn&#39;t feel bad yesterday. It&#39;s rare for me to like my job.&quot;</p><hr><p>With those words, Lancer ignores Archer and heads to the west terrace.</p><hr><p>&quot;Lancer.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Don&#39;t worry about it. I&#39;m doing this out of my own interest.</p><p>...Well, I&#39;ve been given many disgusting orders up to now, so I&#39;ll at least follow through on this. You can concentrate on your own affairs.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Okay. I&#39;m leaving Tohsaka to you.&quot;</p><p>He lightheartedly replies with a &quot;yes&quot;.</p><p>Then.</p><p>Lancer stops and turns around as if he remembered something.</p><hr><p>&quot;Hey. What are you doing, Saber? You&#39;re coming too.&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>Saber lowers her eyes painfully.</p><p>&quot;No. I will stay here, Lancer.&quot;</p><p>She stands next to me and replies unlike a Servant.</p><hr><p>&quot;Are you serious? That girl&#39;s your Master now, right? You should be protecting your Master.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I understand that. But I still would like to stay here. ...I need to watch over this fight.&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Fine. Do as you wish.&quot;</p><hr><p>Lancer leaves.</p><p>He easily jumps up to the terrace and disappears into the passageway.</p><hr><p>Archer does not do anything.</p><p>It&#39;s as if he&#39;s saying Tohsaka is useless now.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>I step over the rubble and walk forward.</p><p>I&#39;m heading to the center of the room, at the foot of the stairs.</p><p>Forcing down her emotions, Saber stands still to watch over our battle.</p><hr><p>&quot;You won&#39;t do anything, huh? That&#39;s good.</p><p>If Saber interrupts me right now, I&#39;ll have broken my contract with Rin for nothing.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>I can hear Saber&#39;s hesitation.</p><p>Saber takes a quick breath and replies to the man at the top of the stairs.</p><hr><p>&quot;I will not interfere. I will not do anything during your battle with Shirou.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Very good. I can kill him at ease.&quot;</p><p>&quot;...Yes. But please answer me before that. Why are you trying to kill Shirou?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015There&#39;s nothing to explain. Just as he cannot approve of me, I too cannot approve of him.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;That cannot be true...! You are Shirou. You are the ideal of Emiya Shirou, the one who became a hero. S-So why are you trying to kill yourself...!?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Why do you think? The hero called Emiya and the inexperienced Emiya Shirou are two separate beings. We cannot exist at the same time unless that is the case.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;That is because you became a Servant. I heard that guardians can be summoned into the age in which they lived, since they are not bound to the time axis...!</p><p>You are Shirou. You should be the personification of his ideal, the person he became after much hard work. So why\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>She finishes in a broken voice,</p><p>&quot;Why are you so different?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>Not responding, he starts down the stairs.</p><p>&quot;......&quot;</p><p>He cannot answer that question.</p><p>If he were able to, we would not be fighting here.</p><hr><p>&quot;Archer...!&quot;</p><p>Saber steps forward to confront Archer.</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015It&#39;s fine, Saber. Just step back.&quot;</p><p>I stop her with my hand and keep her at the entrance.</p><hr><p>&quot;But Shirou...!&quot;</p><p>&quot;I appreciate it. But talking&#39;s useless. From the very beginning, his objective has been to kill me.&quot;</p><p>&quot;......!&quot;</p><hr><p>Saber bites her lip in frustration.</p><p>Saber stares at me, then at Archer.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Why, Archer? I do not understand. I heard that guardians are ones who become heroic spirits after their deaths in order to protect people. So why are you trying to kill yourself?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Guardian?&quot;</p><p>Maybe something she said got through to him.</p><p>He stops and looks down at Saber without emotion.</p><hr><p>&quot;You&#39;re wrong, Saber. Guardians are not ones that protect the people. They are only cleaners. They are definitely not the heroes I once wished to become.&quot;</p><p>His voice sounds different.</p><p>Hatred and scorn fill it now.</p><hr><p>&quot;Archer...?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I did become a hero. I became a superhero, just as Emiya Shirou had wanted.&quot;</p><hr><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015A superhero.</p><p>Someone who will not harm anyone.</p><p>Someone who will not retreat no matter what disaster he may face, someone who can save everyone, someone Emiya Shirou wanted to become.</p><p>And...</p><p>That man became such a person?</p><hr><p>&quot;Ar... cher...?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes, I certainly did save some people.</p><p>I have made many ideals come true, and I have saved the world from danger several times.</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015A hero... I did reach the place I had dreamed of for so long.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;You became a hero\u2015\u2015\u2015then Shirou was rewarded, right...?</p><p>At the very least, you made Emiya Shirou&#39;s ideal come true.</p><p>Then you should not have any regrets. Shirou was able to make his wish come true.&quot;</p><hr><p>There&#39;s no conviction in her voice.</p><p>...She already knows.</p><p>She knows that she is only voicing her own wish.</p><hr><p>&quot;&#39;Make his wish come true&#39;, huh? I certainly did become a superhero, just like in my ideal.</p><p>But all I obtained in the end were regrets. All that was left was death.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;I killed and killed and killed.</p><p>I killed many people to act on my ideal.</p><p>I killed so many that I stopped caring about innocent people, and I saved a thousand times as many as I killed.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>Saber stares at Archer, speechless.</p><p>She looks like someone who saw her own mirror image.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015Yes, I don&#39;t know how many times I&#39;ve repeated the cycle.</p><p>I fought as often as requested, and I fought with my life in danger whenever I knew there was a conflict. I fought many times. So many times that I can&#39;t even remember now.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;It can&#39;t be helped, right?</p><p>No matter who I save, there are always people who will perish. No matter how many conflicts I resolve, new conflicts are always created.</p><p>A superhero has to keep existing as long as conflict exists.&quot;</p><hr><p>Who did he direct that to?</p><p>The knight slowly descends the stairs and recounts his past.</p><hr><p>&quot;That&#39;s why I killed.</p><p>I trampled on dozens of wishes to save one person. I ignored even more people to save those I trampled over.</p><p>I killed scores of people, rescued only those in front of me, and destroyed many more wishes.</p><p>I kept being stubborn, saying that it will end this time, that everyone would become happy.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015But it never ended.</p><p>Conflicts come into my view as long as I&#39;m alive.</p><p>It was endless. I didn&#39;t dream of a world without conflicts.</p><p>I just wanted people in my view not to cry.&quot;</p><hr><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015That is...</p><p>...Definitely my own wish.</p><hr><p>&quot;My vision expands after I save one.</p><p>Ten after one. A hundred after ten. How many was it after a hundred? At that time, I finally realized that Emiya Shirou&#39;s ideal was just a convenient fantasy.&quot;</p><p>&quot;...Why is that?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Don&#39;t ask for the obvious, Saber. You should have experienced the same thing many times already. You cannot save everyone.</p><p>I assume it was a daily routine for you to sacrifice a few people to save the country.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;......&quot;</p><p>The quiet voice is rendered powerless to object.</p><p>The words of the red knight are Saber&#39;s darkness as well.</p><hr><p>&quot;Yes, the seats are limited. There are always fewer seats called happiness than there are people to fill them.</p><p>Since you cannot save everyone, someone will have to be sacrificed.</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015And...</p><p>I quickly killed the ones that would eventually fall out to minimize the damage.</p><p>This is what it means to be that boy&#39;s vision of the ideal superhero.&quot;</p><hr><p>The wish for nobody to become sad.</p><p>The desire to save as many people as possible.</p><p>When the two coexist and contradict each other, there is only one solution.</p><hr><p>The only people a superhero can save are the people he sides with.</p><hr><p>If one is to lose everything by trying to save everything...</p><hr><p>It is correct to sacrifice one to save more.</p><hr><p>&quot;A superhero should save many people, right? That&#39;s why I killed. I prayed for no one to die, but I killed one to save many.</p><p>I said I would not have anyone sad, but I brought despair to a few in the dark.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;And in time, I got used to it. To protect my ideal, I kept going against it.</p><p>I only saved the people I tried to save and quickly killed the people who opposed me. I allowed &#39;someone&#39; to be sacrificed to keep protecting my ideal.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;That is the true identity of the hero Emiya.</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015See.</p><p>Don&#39;t you think such a guy should die?&quot;</p><hr><p>That&#39;s right.</p><p>The only ones a superhero can save are people he sides with.</p><p>...But.</p><p>Who was it that defied those words?</p><hr><p>&quot;...That is a lie. Even if that happened, you would have protected your ideal by choosing yourself to be that &#39;someone&#39;.&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>The knight stops for a second.</p><p>A frown crosses his face.</p><hr><p>&quot;You did not go against your ideal. You only lost your path because you were betrayed by the ideal you protected.</p><p>You would not think of killing yourself to atone for the sins unless that were the case.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>His ironic smile disappears.</p><p>After coldly staring at Saber...</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Ha. Haha, hahahahaha!!&quot;</p><p>...He starts laughing like a madman.</p><p>...As if it&#39;s the funniest thing he&#39;s heard.</p><hr><p>&quot;Kuku, hahahahahahaha! Wow, that is great.</p><p>Atone for my sins? Don&#39;t be stupid, Saber.</p><p>I have no sins to atone for, nor have I forced such a meaningless concept on anyone.&quot;</p><p>The knight calmly goes mad.</p><p>He spoke in a small voice, but his laughter echoes through the hall.</p><hr><p>&quot;Yeah, you&#39;re right, Saber. I was certainly betrayed and deceived many times. I have been accused by the exact person I saved. After giving my all to stop a conflict, I was accused of being its cause, and was executed in the end.</p><p>See? If I had any sins to atone for, I have already done so, right?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;What\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015impossible, Archer. You cannot mean your end is...&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...Heh. So that was it.</p><p>But I didn&#39;t care about that. From the start, I didn&#39;t do these things to be appreciated. I had no intention of being praised as a hero. I just wanted a result where everybody would be happy.</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015But such a wish never came true.</p><p>Not within my lifetime, nor after my death.&quot;</p><hr><p>He has stopped laughing.</p><p>There&#39;s only hatred in his voice now.</p><hr><p>&quot;Guardians are a colorless force that places humanity&#39;s survival before anything.</p><p>The powers are in the heavens, and the guardians appear in this world only when there&#39;s a chance of human extinction.</p><p>...I knew they were just slaves.</p><p>I knew that people who become guardians are removed from the circle of reincarnation and become like nothingness.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;But I did not care, so long as I could save people.</p><p>Emiya Shirou could not fulfill his oath.</p><p>So\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015I thought it would be fine if I could become a guardian to take part in stopping humanity&#39;s destruction.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015But it&#39;s actually different. Guardians do not save people.</p><p>All they do is clean up after humans. They take what has been done and nullify it with their powers.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;They do not save people. All they do is eliminate harmful people, without distinction of good or evil.</p><p>They do not save people in despair. Instead, they eliminate people in despair in order to save others who are enjoying life.</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015It&#39;s so ridiculous. How am I different from before?&quot;</p><hr><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015There&#39;s no difference.</p><p>There was just more despair.</p><p>He relied on a greater power since his powers alone were not enough.</p><p>But it ended up being the same.</p><p>He thought the power would make his wish come true, but it only made him do the same things on a greater scale.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Archer. You have repeated such a thing forever...?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I got used to it. Humans repeat things. The strong feed on the weak, regardless of what age we&#39;re talking about. And I came to realize that it is the most efficient way to prosper.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015Yes, I watched it over and over.</p><p>Meaningless massacres, meaningless equality, meaningless happiness...!</p><p>I was forced to look at them even when I refused to. As a guardian, I have no free will. I am called by the people only to take care of the crime people have created.&quot;</p><hr><p>That is where he ended up.</p><p>A being that repairs the damage caused by human desire.</p><p>Guardians do not save people. Rather, they eliminate those who cannot be saved as if they never existed.</p><hr><p>Over and over.</p><p>For many times, he saw people nearly destroy themselves through their own actions, and he burned them down like trash each time.</p><p>&quot;Save as many people as possible&quot;.</p><p>The man became a hero with that one wish\u2015\u2015\u2015but in the end, he could not make it come true even once.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015That&#39;s right. This is wrong.</p><p>This is not what I wished for.</p><p>I did not become a guardian for this...!!!!&quot;</p><hr><p>His anger is probably directed at himself.</p><p>What is standing there is a worn-out corpse.</p><p>The hero Emiya is doomed to always see the ugliness of those he wanted to save.</p><hr><p>He grew to hate them in the end.</p><p>He grew to hate humans for repeating conflicts. He grew to hate himself for thinking that humans are sacred.</p><hr><p>&quot;I don&#39;t want to clean up after people. But as long as I&#39;m a guardian, there&#39;s no way for me to escape this cycle.</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015Save one exception.&quot;</p><hr><p>Murderous intent flares in his cold eyes.</p><p>He isn&#39;t looking at Saber.</p><p>There is only one objective for Archer: to kill his own self.</p><p>But even if he dies, the real body of Emiya, who is in the &quot;place&quot; outside of the cycle and not bound by time, will not disappear.</p><p>There is no elimination for guardians.</p><hr><p>They are &quot;nothing&quot; to start with. It is meaningless to kill something that is not part of the real world.</p><p>...But.</p><p>There is one way for him to disappear.</p><p>If someone who is to become a hero is killed before he becomes a hero, that hero will never come into existence.</p><p>Therefore\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>&quot;Are you going to kill Shirou here with your own hands?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Yes. I kept waiting for this chance. It was a possibility close to zero.</p><p>But I staked everything on it. I could not contain myself unless I believed in it. While I acted as a guardian, this was the one hope that kept me going.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...That is meaningless, Archer.</p><p>You have already become a guardian. So it is too late. Even if you kill Emiya Shirou, who has yet to become a hero, you yourself will not disappear.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;That may be true. But there&#39;s still a chance, however small.</p><p>Just altering the past might not be enough, but the paradox will be even greater if I am the one to do it.</p><p>If the distortion is large enough\u2015\u2015\u2015a hero called Emiya will disappear here.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;And Saber. This is what I&#39;ve been waiting for. I am not looking for results now.</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015I&#39;m just taking my anger out on a kid called Emiya Shirou, the one who will become a clown as a result of his stupid ideal.&quot;</p><hr><p>And the knight in red comes down to the hall.</p><p>Only Archer and I stand in the hall filled with rubble.</p><hr><p>There&#39;s nothing separating us.</p><p>The reason is simple.</p><p>He wants to kill me, and I just want to beat him up because I don&#39;t like him.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>I walk [wrap\u0320text=&quot;to&quot;]to the center of the hall.</p><p>I won&#39;t be able to back out once I take a few more steps.</p><p>But before that...</p><p>&quot;Archer. Do you regret your actions?&quot;</p><p>...There&#39;s one thing I have to ask him.</p><hr><p>&quot;Of course. I... no, you should not have become a superhero.&quot;</p><p>He spits those words out.</p><p>And that dispels my last doubts.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015I see. Then we are two different people.&quot;</p><p>&quot;What?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I will never regret my path. I won&#39;t regret it, no matter what may happen.</p><p>So\u2015\u2015\u2015I will never approve of you.</p><p>If you say you&#39;re my ideal, I&#39;ll destroy such an incorrect ideal with my own hands.&quot;</p><hr><p>That&#39;s how I&#39;ve been living up to now.</p><p>I&#39;ve always believed that I am right.</p><p>As he says, I&#39;m sure it&#39;s full of false courage and distortion.</p><p>I&#39;ve lost more than I&#39;ve gained.</p><p>But that&#39;s all the more reason why.</p><p>I cannot withdraw for the sake of the things I&#39;ve lost.</p><hr><p>I walk forward.</p><p>My circuit has already started sketching the blueprint in my mind.</p><hr><p>&quot;...That way of thinking is the cause of all this. There will come a time when you will reach me.&quot;</p><p>&quot;There won&#39;t be such a time. It will never come.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh. Does that mean you will be killed here before that happens?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>I take a step towards my enemy.</p><p>We&#39;re close enough to strike at each other.</p><p>We don&#39;t have any weapons.</p><p>We confront each other empty-handed.</p><p>Emiya Shirou is not a swordsman.</p><p>We are beings that create swords.</p><p>Then\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>&quot;So it seems you understand.</p><p>Yes, to fight against me is to compete in projection.&quot;</p><p>The twin swords appear in his hands.</p><p>...That night...</p><p>The simple twin swords I admired in the Ryuudou Temple.</p><p>Rare swords that a legendary craftsman made at the price of his wife.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Trace, on.&quot;</p><p>I activate the completed blueprint and reproduce the twin swords using my image.</p><hr><p>...What a bad job.</p><p>The twin swords I once thought were perfect are too unprecise compared to his.</p><p>An inferior illusion will become a delusion.</p><p>Probably...</p><p>My swords will shatter and disappear when they crash against his.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>I take another step.</p><p>Crunch.</p><p>The rubble crunches under my foot.</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015That serves as the signal.</p><hr><p>&quot;Will you be able to keep up with my projection?</p><p>You will die once your swords lose their precision...!&quot;</p><hr><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015The opposing swords sweep through the air.</p><p>They are drawn together like magnets and clash into each other.</p><hr><h2 id="scene-26" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#scene-26" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Scene 26</h2><p>The search ends rather quickly.</p><p>Lancer is thought to be specialized in battle, but he is actually skilled in magecraft.</p><p>Gae Bolg is not the only thing he obtained in the Country of Shadows.</p><p>He is the hero who obtained all eighteen of the Runes of Origin.</p><p>But since he prefers to battle using his lance, the magecraft rarely gets used.</p><p>And now is one of the rare times.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015All right.&quot;</p><p>The thing that flies above the floor suddenly drops.</p><p>The Berkana Rune finishes its search and turns back into a stone.</p><hr><p>&quot;W-Who are you...!?&quot;</p><p>An unfamiliar boy stands up in confusion.</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>Lancer realizes that he knows the voice and recalls who he is.</p><hr><p>&quot;You&#39;re Rider&#39;s Master.

I guess I let my hand do the talking.&quot;</p><p>He didn&#39;t kill the boy since it was unconscious.</p><p>But it would not have been unconscious if Tohsaka Rin looked paler and her clothes were more disordered.

When did you change your religion?</p><p>Wasn&#39;t it my Master&#39;s belief not to come out into the open?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I have no religion to change. You are going against my order, Lancer. I thought I told you to kill Archer. Did you fail, Lancer?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015Heh. He&#39;ll disappear even if I ignore him. I just came to finish up an unfinished job\u2015\u2015\u2015but if you&#39;re here, does that mean that kid is a pawn of yours?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Do not say it like that. We are cooperating. We work together in order to obtain the Holy Grail.&quot;</p><p>The priest says so without looking at the boy moaning in the rubble.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015I see. I knew you wouldn&#39;t die so easily. Not only were you still alive, but you were doing things behind our backs, huh?</p><p>...You have really bad taste. What are you doing, controlling that harmless Shinji?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Hm\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015I see, so you see him as harmless, huh? You are the same as always, even in this situation. I would not be so reluctant to do this if you weren&#39;t so smart.&quot;</p><p>The priest laughs.</p><p>He looks and sounds as though he&#39;s giving a benediction to the dying.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>A chill runs up the girl&#39;s spine.</p><p>At that moment, she realizes her fate.</p><p>With a saintly smile, the priest gazes upon the sacrifice, who had been his pupil for the past ten years.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Hold on, Kotomine. What are you going to do with her? Did you tell me a lie when you said you wanted to save your pupil?&quot;</p><p>Lancer glares at his Master while standing in front of the girl.</p><p>&quot;It is not a lie. I have raised her to be my tool. I have deceived her for ten years, so it would be boring if she retired so easily.</p><p>That is why I ordered her protection. I have prolonged her life for only two days, but isn&#39;t that more than enough to show my love?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>The priest walks past Lancer and looks down at the girl on the ground.</p><p>The girl glares at her former instructor.</p><hr><p>&quot;You fraud. I knew it was possible, but you really are a Master, huh? How unfair for a supervisor to take part in the game.&quot;</p><p>&quot;You are rather calm, Rin. So you did know, huh?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Of course. I didn&#39;t show you my Servant because I suspected you. ...But I didn&#39;t think I was deceived from the start.&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015From... the start?&quot;</p><p>Then.</p><p>The priest frowns as if the words are unexpected.</p><hr><p>&quot;...What? Do you have something to complain about, Kirei?&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015No. You said &#39;from the start&#39;, so I was merely wondering when you meant by that.&quot;</p><p>The priest grins.</p><p>He looks down at the girl with utmost pleasure.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Hold on. Kirei, you don&#39;t mean...&quot;</p><p>&quot;Are you talking about the start of this Holy Grail War?</p><p>Or do you mean the previous one?&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>With that, the girl understands everything.</p><p>Her face turns pale, and she looks up at the man she studied under for ten years in disbelief.</p><hr><p>&quot;...I see. So you killed him, huh?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Of course. He was my beloved teacher, so it was easy to attack him by surprise.&quot;</p><p>&quot;......&quot;</p><p>A grinding sound.</p><p>The girl hangs her head and grits her teeth.</p><hr><p>&quot;Y\u2015\u2015\u2015ou, get lost in your afterlife, you damn priest...!! You have no place to be, okay!? Even hell wouldn&#39;t take a bastard like you!</p><p>An impotent guy like you should lay on needles in hell...!!!!!&quot;</p><p>The girl keeps on cursing him.</p><hr><p>Of course, the priest does not care about such things.</p><p>But the boy is overawed by her change.</p><p>Matou Shinji never thought Tohsaka Rin would show this much emotion.</p><hr><p>&quot;Kotomine. You know Tohsaka&#39;s mine, right? Only I have business with her. You can go to the church and wait for this to be over.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I do have business with her. I need her to become the Holy Grail here.&quot;</p><p>Matou Shinji does not understand what the priest is saying.</p><p>The only ones who understand are the priest and the sacrifice, Tohsaka Rin.</p><hr><p>&quot;It should be about the right time once Saber and Archer disappear.</p><p>I don&#39;t want her to struggle and waste magical energy. Let&#39;s quickly get this over with.&quot;</p><p>The priest walks away from the girl with those words.</p><p>The only one in front of Tohsaka Rin is Lancer.</p><hr><p>&quot;Kotomine, you...&quot;</p><p>&quot;Finish off that trash, Lancer. The vessel does not require a heart.&quot;</p><p>Only Matou Shinji reacts to those words.</p><hr><p>Tohsaka Rin glares at the priest, but bites her lip without speaking.</p><p>The priest&#39;s smile already told her that she was going to be killed here.</p><p>She understands that she will not be saved and that she won&#39;t be heard even if she begs for her life.</p><p>That&#39;s why she doesn&#39;t complain.</p><p>That is the only way she can resist and that is her will of opposition.</p><hr><p>She won&#39;t give up until the very last second.</p><p>Help might arrive even at this moment, and she might be the only one that survives after this room miraculously crumbles.</p><p>&quot;......Well, it won&#39;t happen.&quot;</p><p>She won&#39;t give up, but she also understands it&#39;s impossible.</p><hr><p>That&#39;s why she has no fear.</p><p>Except for one thing.</p><p>She imagines that boy&#39;s expression when he finds her dead after coming to save her.</p><p>She doesn&#39;t want him to cry.</p><p>It angers her that she&#39;s the cause of his tears, and she doesn&#39;t know how she can apologize to him.</p><hr><p>No, she can&#39;t apologize if she dies, but she still doesn&#39;t want him to cry.</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015Sorry, Emiya-kun. I&#39;m retiring first.&quot;</p><p>So she decides to apologize ahead of time.</p><p>It does no good, but it calms her down.</p><hr><p>&quot;What&#39;s wrong, Lancer? It&#39;s just a girl. It should be easy to pierce her.&quot;</p><p>The priest shows no mercy.</p><p>To that...</p><p>&quot;I refuse. I can&#39;t obey that order. Use the Command Spell if you want me to do it.&quot;</p><p>Lancer replies while looking at the priest as if he is an enemy.</p><hr><p>&quot;What\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015?&quot;</p><p>The priest narrows his eyes.</p><p>The master and the slave.</p><p>The air inside the room freezes as they stare at each other.</p><hr><p>&quot;...I see. I guess it cannot be helped. I do not like wasting a Command Spell on something I can do myself...&quot;</p><p>He raises his left arm.</p><p>The priest activates the Command Spell on his arm.</p><hr><p>&quot;Then I will command you. \u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Kill yourself, Lancer.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Gah\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>He vomits up blood.</p><p>But that is nothing compared to the blood spilling from his chest.</p><hr><p>&quot;Kotomine, you\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>His voice is a whisper now.</p><p>The spearman\u2015\u2015\u2015Lancer&#39;s chest and heart are pierced by his own lance.</p><hr><p>&quot;Farewell.

Well, it just turned out this way.

There is no way you can stay in this world for ten years...!&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;That is not true. The connection with this world is not the Holy Grail, but the Master. The Holy Grail merely opened up the passage. I can stay in this world as long as a magus provides me with magical energy.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;But then, there aren&#39;t that many Masters that can maintain a Servant without help from the Holy Grail. In that regard, my Master did not have enough magical energy.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;......? Then it should not be possible for you to stay in this world. If your Master cannot support a familiar like you, you should be dried up along with your Master.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;That depends on how one does it.

I understood the true identity of the Holy Grail.</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015I decided at that time. I will be the only one who will handle it.&quot;</p><hr><p>Saber.</p><p>No, looking down at all of us, he declares something that is unbefitting for a Servant.</p><hr><p>&quot;You\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015will use the Holy Grail?&quot;</p><p>&quot;That&#39;s right. There is no need for me to share it with a parasite like my Master. I will use the Holy Grail for my objective.</p><p>The biggest obstacle, the summoner, was eliminated.</p><p>All that&#39;s left are pathetic magi that would be completely unsuited to being the vessel.</p><p>Such failures are suited for my wish.</p><p>But then\u2015\u2015\u2015your flesh might make a perfect Holy Grail.&quot;</p><hr><p>The man looks at Tohsaka.</p><p>&quot;Oh......&quot;</p><p>Tohsaka must feel the danger, as she grows pale and steps back.</p><hr><p>...His red eyes are ominous.</p><p>One would feel uncomfortable under the weight of that gaze.</p><p>His eyes are so aberrant that even Tohsaka is frightened of them.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015Ridiculous. The Holy Grail is what the Master obtains.</p><p>We Servants cooperate with our Masters because we cannot obtain it ourselves...!&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;That is strange.</p><p>The Servants are the only ones who can touch the Holy Grail, but Masters are the only ones who can obtain it?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Uh\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015but...&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...Heh. It&#39;s all ridiculous nonsense.</p><p>The fight for the Holy Grail by Seven Masters? A ritual where the last Master obtains the Holy Grail?</p><p>That is only an excuse made for outsiders.</p><p>The summoning of the Holy Grail is already completed. They always call for the seven Servants after the Holy Grail is prepared.</p><p>Do you understand, king of knights? They do not want the Holy Grail, but what goes in it.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Masters are just circuits to summon us. Magi made the Holy Grail, but they could not prepare its contents.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;I told you earlier, right? They are ones that take away from others if they cannot supply it themselves.</p><p>The purest magical energy to fill the Holy Grail.</p><p>The &#39;greatest souls of humanity&#39;, the guardians, are what they sought. The seven Servants are sacrifices they prepared.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015What?&quot;</p><p>Saber looks up at the man in astonishment.</p><p>Her eyes are desperately trying to deny his words.</p><p>...That it isn&#39;t possible.</p><p>She is trying to deny it saying that what she wished for, the Holy Grail, cannot be such a thing.</p><hr><p>&quot;You should not be surprised. The Holy Grail is a filtration device that turns the soul into pure magical energy.</p><p>Yes, it should let you grant any wish. It contains more magical energy than a magus could ever use within his lifetime.</p><p>That is why it is better with more sacrifices. It should be omnipotent with six Servants as sacrifices.</p><p>Five Servants have filled the Holy Grail. Only one more is needed for the omnipotent grail they sought.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015Then... Then only the Masters can handle the Holy Grail. If it is a repository of pure magical energy, only magi can use it.</p><p>...Yes. If the Master is an excellent magus, it\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;It will grant him any wish?</p><p>You idiot. Such miracles are not given to mere humans. Humans only destroy themselves, no matter how much power they are given.</p><p>But\u2015\u2015\u2015do not worry, Saber.</p><p>This Holy Grail is real. If you insert seven Servants in it, it will reach the origin.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;......Origin......? Hold on. Then could the Holy Grail be...?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;I do not know who it was, but the one who made this rule is a genius.</p><p>But it does not concern me. I have no interest in such a thing. All I am interested in is the Holy Grail&#39;s ability to serve as the &#39;gate&#39;.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Wha\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015the Holy Grail is a gate\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015?&quot;</p><p>&quot;......Heh.</p><p>It happened ten years ago. You opposed me right when I was about to obtain the Holy Grail.</p><p>The Holy Grail was cut by the holy sword and what poured out burned the town.</p><p>As I was right underneath the Holy Grail, I was showered with it.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;I understood the true identity of the Holy Grail at that time.</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015It is worthless. It is worthless, but it does have its uses.</p><p>Not many weapons are as specialized in murder as that. The Holy Grail is fine as is. There is no need to turn it into an omnipotent vessel.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Weapon\u2015\u2015\u2015are you saying that a weapon is created out of Servants?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;We are weapons to begin with. That thing has only perfected that. The Holy Grail is a gate to hell. 5.6 billion curses will flow out from it once it is opened.</p><p>Kotomine did not tell you about it?</p><p>The Holy Grail is named &#39;Angra Manyu&#39;, or &#39;all evils of the world&#39;.</p><p>It is mud that will consume every human being, like the name states.&quot;</p><hr><p>......Angra Manyu?</p><p>I think that&#39;s the name of the devil in Zoroastrianism.</p><p>The leader of evil that opposes God for many thousands of years.</p><p>It is an embodiment of the evil in all human, and it is depicted as a reflected image of all humanity&#39;s good will.</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015But why is the Holy Grail named after the ancient Persian devil?</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Then your intention is to...&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Yes, to sweep the humans away. I have no intention of admiring humanity like Kotomine. I only admire beautiful things.</p><p>This world is enjoyable, but it is incorrigible at the same time.</p><p>It is an insult to the king for so many wretches to be enjoying life.</p><p>I do not want to rule over such a world.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;A\u2015\u2015\u2015Are you stupid!? What insult to the king...!? It&#39;s meaningless to be the king if all humans are eliminated!&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;I do not care if they die out. There is no point to their lives if they end them through their own crimes.</p><p>I do not want lowlifes. The only ones worth ruling over are those that can survive even the flames of hell.</p><p>In that respect, they were an utter failure ten years ago. If such a pitiful blaze will wipe them out, humans truly have become weak.&quot;</p><hr><p>He grins.</p><p>For the first time...</p><p>He looks at me, who he said is a failure.</p><hr><p>&quot;I do not know what this &#39;all evils of the world&#39; is.</p><p>But it is convenient. It is a reaper that strikes down all humans equally.</p><p>An endless darkness that is born from humans and kills them.</p><p>It is an appropriate hound to entrust with the work I should be doing.&quot;</p><hr><p>Gilgamesh raises his hand.</p><p>Behind him are Noble Phantasms waiting for the king&#39;s order.</p><hr><p>&quot;Then let us continue the battle from ten years ago. A boring lowlife got involved last time, but there will be no such interruptions this time.</p><p>But then\u2015\u2015\u2015it seems a worse faker is here...!&quot;</p><hr><p>The swords are all pointed at me.</p><p>&quot;......!&quot;</p><p>I will my broken legs to stand, but they do not move.</p><hr><p>...Damn, I can&#39;t even manage to block one of those.</p><p>So why\u2015\u2015\u2015why did Archer leave behind that message...!?</p><hr><p>&quot;Hm?&quot;</p><p>The swords disappear.</p><p>The golden Servant suddenly lowers his arm.</p><p>After looking up at the ceiling in discomfort, he brushes away the dust on his shoulder.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015The ashes will dirty me. You escaped death this time, child.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Huh......?&quot;</p><hr><p>...The castle is burning.</p><p>I don&#39;t know who set the fire, but it must be huge.</p><p>The third floor is burning down and the second floor has caught as well.</p><hr><p>...No, that&#39;s not the surprising thing.</p><p>He really stopped the battle just because he was going to get dirty from the ashes.</p><hr><p>&quot;Are you running away, Archer?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I am only changing the location. I have the Holy Grail.</p><p>It is my policy to finish matters quickly. I shall quickly construct the Holy Grail and open up the gate to hell.&quot;</p><hr><p>His golden hair flutters.</p><p>Gilgamesh walks to the terrace that isn&#39;t yet burning.</p><hr><p>&quot;You should hurry up if you want to recover it.</p><p>The Holy Grail this time is a hurriedly-constructed defect. All the contents will spill out if you do not hurry...!&quot;</p><hr><p>His stifled laughter echoes through the room.</p><p>And he leaves the burning castle like that.</p><p>Sparks are dancing through the room, and the ceiling is tinted red.</p><hr><p>...The gorgeous castle shows no traces of what it used to be.</p><p>The castle without a master crumbles without trace, as if to follow the girl in white.</p><hr><h2 id="scene-29" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#scene-29" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Scene 29</h2><p>&quot;Haa, haa, haa, ha\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015!&quot;</p><p>Matou Shinji is running through the forest with beast-like breath.</p><p>He is actually running along a selected route, but his mentality is that of a wanderer.</p><p>He is running away without aim, so the word &quot;wandering&quot; is more befitting.</p><hr><p>&quot;Damn\u2015\u2015\u2015I was so close, and everyone&#39;s getting in my way...!&quot;</p><p>He pushes the branches aside with one hand and runs while scattering wet dirt.</p><p>Leaving a trail of blood behind him, Matou Shinji heads to the edge of the forest.</p><p>He has not treated the wound he received from Lancer.</p><p>He does not feel his right arm anymore.</p><p>The wound is inflamed, and his arm will not move, as though dead.</p><hr><p>&quot;Hah... haa, ha, ah......!&quot;</p><p>He must not be able to run with only one arm, as he slips and leans against a tree.</p><p>His dangling right arm is like a piece of trash.</p><p>As soon as he realizes that a part of his body is a useless piece of trash, Matou Shinji starts laughing.</p><p>&quot;Hah... haha, ahahahaha.&quot;</p><p>The laughter comes out like a racking cough.</p><hr><p>It hurts.</p><p>It must be because of the wound that his body is burning hot.</p><p>In a daze, he imagines one of his arms rotting away.

All the other idiots should lose both of their arms.</p><hr><p>&quot;Ku\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>He can&#39;t stop laughing.</p><p>With that decision made, the pain becomes bearable.</p><p>He has a legitimate purpose now.</p><p>The first thing he would do is collect every possible arm.</p><p>There will be no exceptions.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Ha, that&#39;s great. I know whose arms I&#39;ll get first.&quot;</p><p>The girl that did not become his.</p><p>Since she is his favorite, he cannot allow her to be superior to him.</p><p>&quot;Yeah, just you wait, Tohsaka. I&#39;ll make you inferior.&quot;</p><p>Laughing, Matou Shinji raises his head.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Huh?&quot;</p><p>When did he appear? His Servant is standing right in front of him.</p><hr><p>&quot;You\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>He looks at his Servant in surprise.</p><p>The golden Servant looks down at Matou Shinji as if looking at livestock.</p><p>&quot;You are wounded.

Then it must have been him that released that Master.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yeah, Tohsaka ran away because you were such a slowass...! It makes me want to puke, thinking about how I lost her to somebody who was almost dead!&quot;</p><p>&quot;I see. That is too bad.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...! Why are you so calm!? We can&#39;t obtain the Holy Grail without Tohsaka, right!? Damn, everything&#39;s ruined because of you! Do you understand!? What are we going to\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>&quot;Do not worry. Everything is as planned. The Holy Grail can still be created.&quot;</p><p>The Servant&#39;s voice contains no emotion.</p><p>Matou Shinji does not realize that the red eyes aren&#39;t looking at him.</p><hr><p>&quot;How!? Kotomine said that even if we have the Holy Grail, we can&#39;t make it if there&#39;s no vessel! That kid&#39;s heart is not enough. That won&#39;t turn into a Holy Grail unless we connect it to a Magic Circuit, right...!?&quot;</p><p>Matou Shinji walks up to his Servant and scolds him for his stupidity.</p><p>The golden Servant nods and...</p><hr><p>&quot;There is no problem.</p><p>There is another Master here that can be a vessel.&quot;</p><p>...He thrusts his arm.</p><hr><p>A piercing sound.</p><p>Matou Shinji never finds out what the sound is.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Huh?&quot;</p><p>But he feels something funny in his stomach.</p><p>Looking down, he sees his Servant&#39;s arm there.</p><p>The fist is inside his body.</p><p>There is neither pain nor blood.</p><p>The Servant&#39;s arm is in his body, like the absurd spiritual operation he saw before.</p><hr><p>&quot;You want the Holy Grail, right?

This is my first time, so there&#39;s no way I would know!&quot;</p><p>I yell, hoping to make her back down.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>Tohsaka looks at me in surprise.</p><p>&quot;...I see. Yeah, so it&#39;s your first time too, huh?&quot;</p><p>Then, she lets out a sigh of relief.</p><hr><p>&quot;.........&quot;</p><p>...Hold on.</p><p>By &quot;you too&quot;, she means\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>&quot;...Tohsaka, is this your first time?&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>She replies with a glare.</p><p>It looks like she&#39;s saying &quot;is that bad?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Ugh\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>If this is her first time, um, she&#39;s a virgin, so it has to be painful for her.</p><p>Not only that, but it could be hard for her to get any pleasure out of sex\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>&quot;Tohsaka, you...&quot;</p><p>&quot;...Humph. Forget about it. I&#39;m the one who brought this up, so I&#39;m prepared for it.</p><p>...I&#39;m used to pain. Don&#39;t worry about me and you just concentrate on your own orgasm.&quot;</p><p>&quot;...Um, you mean... ejaculate, right?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Yes. But don&#39;t let your guard down.</p><p>We can&#39;t connect unless we both reach orgasm at the same time so that our protections come down.</p><p>I&#39;ll take care of the contract and the connection of our magecraft-Circuits, so all you have to do is have sex with me.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>That&#39;s right.</p><p>This is a ritual to get her to share her magical energy.</p><p>I can&#39;t just be driven by my desires.</p><p>All the more so if Tohsaka is a virgin.</p><p>We have to orgasm together, so I better make sure I pleasure Tohsaka as much as possible.</p><hr><p>&quot;We&#39;re only doing this to connect with each other, so don&#39;t do anything else, okay? ...I don&#39;t think I need to tell you, but I&#39;ll get angry if you do weird things.&quot;</p><p>&quot;...? What do you mean by weird things?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Eh...? U-Um, like ejaculating inside of me or expecting me to do it with my mouth.&quot;</p><p>She hangs her head in embarrassment.</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>My desire surges up again at her gesture.</p><p>Her skin stimulates my desires.</p><hr><p>&quot;I know. But can I ask you something before we start?&quot;</p><p>&quot;W-What? I&#39;ll get angry if you tell me to do anything weird!&quot;</p><p>Tohsaka glares at me, doing her best to look angry.</p><p>Seeing her cute embarrassment blows away my own embarrassment.</p><hr><p>&quot;Well, it&#39;s a simple question. Why aren&#39;t you taking off your top?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Huh...?&quot;</p><p>Tohsaka sits there, dumbfounded.</p><p>The question must have caught her off-guard, as she looks at me as if she&#39;s seen a ghost.</p><hr><p>And I wait for a few seconds before she replies.</p><p>&quot;I-I don&#39;t have any particular reason! T-This is fine, right!? I-I-I only need to take my bottom off to do it, so I don&#39;t have to get naked.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Why? I&#39;m naked.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;......! That&#39;s fine because you&#39;re a guy! Girls have their reasons, so it&#39;s best if I&#39;m covered up a bit...!&quot;</p><p>Tohsaka pulls back as if running away.</p><p>That shirt must be Tohsaka&#39;s last defense.</p><hr><p>I understand how she feels. It might be fine to let her keep her shirt on if it helps her keep calm.</p><p>But that&#39;s an excessive request.</p><p>I don&#39;t think any man would be able to consent to that.</p><hr><p>&quot;That&#39;s a problem. I might dirty your shirt, and I won&#39;t be able to concentrate if I have to worry about that. And...&quot;</p><p>&quot;Ugh. T-That&#39;s your problem. E-Even if you can&#39;t concentrate, I can concentrate, so\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>&quot;And I want to see your body. I won&#39;t do it unless you get naked.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Y\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>Tohsaka shuts her mouth upon hearing my selfish request.</p><hr><p>&quot;Tohsaka.&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015F-Fine, you blockhead! I&#39;ll do as you wish, so turn around and close your eyes!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh, o-okay.&quot;</p><p>I&#39;m taken aback at her pressure and close my eyes.</p><p>I don&#39;t hear the sound of her clothes.</p><p>I just feel the air moving behind me.</p><hr><p>&quot;......All right. You can turn around now, Shirou.&quot;</p><p>I nod silently at her tense voice.</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>A guest room without any moonlight...</p><p>Tohsaka&#39;s body is illuminated by the warm lamp, and it is so beautiful that it shatters my composure.</p><hr><p>&quot;............&quot;</p><p>Tohsaka silently tries to avoid my gaze.</p><p>Her skin looks soft.</p><p>Her limbs look a bit girlish, as if they are not fully matured.</p><p>Her breasts, covered by her hands, are of perfect size. I bet they would shake like gelatin if I poked them with my finger.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>I think praising her is unnecessary, so I continue to stare at her.</p><p>...Then.</p><p>I notice one part of her that hasn&#39;t changed.</p><hr><p>&quot;......Um. Aren&#39;t you going to take your stockings off, Tohsaka?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Do you have a problem with that? This is as far as I&#39;m going to go. ...I won&#39;t let you see everything on our first time.&quot;</p><p>She sulks and looks away.</p><hr><p>I don&#39;t think her legs will matter when she&#39;s taken off so much clothing, but I can&#39;t complain if she puts it like that.</p><p>...And she&#39;s already too seductive. I&#39;ll just accept this compromise right now.</p><hr><p>&quot;......All right. We&#39;re starting, Tohsaka.&quot;</p><p>I grab her arm without waiting for a reply.</p><p>...I push her onto the bed.</p><p>Her red-tinted body sinks into her long, black hair.</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh... Shirou. Um, if you can...&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015I know. I&#39;ll go slow, so you can just lie there.&quot;</p><p>&quot;...Okay. Please go on.&quot;</p><p>Her voice trails off uneasily.</p><p>I slowly place my fingers on her breast.</p><hr><p>&quot;Ah... hm...&quot;</p><p>I touch her well-shaped breasts.</p><p>Her plump breasts are hot, just like the rest of her body.</p><hr><p>I wrap my hand around Tohsaka&#39;s female symbol.</p><p>&quot;...Wow.&quot;</p><p>I let out a voice of surprise.</p><p>My mind goes crazy at its soft firmness.</p><p>The softness of her breasts stimulates my manhood.</p><hr><p>&quot;...No, that... hm, hurts a bit.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Huh\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015?&quot;</p><p>I didn&#39;t squeeze them too hard, but it must have been painful for Tohsaka.</p><p>But I&#39;m not calm enough to stop.</p><p>I want to feel her softness.</p><p>I want to continue feeling her breasts.</p><hr><p>&quot;Then... I&#39;m doing this.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Huh...? Ah, uh...!?&quot;</p><p>I streak my tongue across her breast while keeping it in my hands.</p><hr><p>&quot;Haa... hm, that... tickles, but, that&#39;s, fine, hm...!&quot;</p><p>I&#39;m only pushing down on her breasts with my hands.</p><p>But they stick to my fingers, as if sucking on them.</p><hr><p>&quot;......Ah... Hm...&quot;</p><p>&quot;Hm... Do you like it, Tohsaka...?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Eh... oh, n-no, that&#39;s... not it...&quot;</p><p>...Her breathing quickens.</p><p>While licking the breast, my tongue naturally reaches the very tip.</p><hr><p>&quot;Ah... mm...&quot;</p><p>I lick her pink nipple as if tasting it.</p><p>I poke it and roll it with my tongue.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Ahh, hm\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><hr><p>Tohsaka is breathing faster and faster.</p><p>...Her breasts are getting hotter.</p><p>Her nipples are getting harder.</p><hr><p>&quot;Ha...... Haa... Mm, ah...&quot;</p><hr><p>But it seems Tohsaka isn&#39;t ready yet.</p><p>...She&#39;s breathing impatiently.</p><p>Tohsaka isn&#39;t that sensitive yet.</p><p>...It might be impolite to say this, but Tohsaka seems like the type that&#39;s hard to please.</p><hr><p>&quot;Ha\u2015\u2015\u2015hm, Shirou, your tongue is hot... and wet... Ah, ya\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><hr><p>But I can&#39;t stop myself.</p><p>I&#39;m licking her breasts and I&#39;m already wanting to bite her nipples.</p><p>My brain is stimulated every time my legs rub against Tohsaka&#39;s thighs.</p><p>The soft sensation runs up my spine and into my brain.</p><hr><p>&quot;Ah, haa, ha\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015hm......!&quot;</p><p>...Plus, Tohsaka is panting and opening up her body in front of me.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>I want to taste her even more.</p><p>I want to make Tohsaka mine by force and\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>&quot;Ah, hm...... Hya...!? N-No, where are you going, Shirou...!?&quot;</p><p>I slide my tongue across her body.</p><p>I move my face below her chest.</p><p>I slide from between her breasts and down.</p><hr><p>&quot;.........!!! No, ah, hm...!&quot;</p><p>Her compliant body suddenly shakes.</p><p>&quot;N-No...! Stay away from my belly button...!&quot;</p><p>Tohsaka tries to hide her belly button.</p><hr><p>&quot;Hm... You&#39;re weak here, Tohsaka?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015hya, hyaa, uhhh......!!&quot;</p><p>I block her hand with my forehead and lick her pretty belly button.</p><hr><p>&quot;Ah, no\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015no, don&#39;t... Ah, hm, ah, no\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><hr><p>There&#39;s no power in her hands.</p><p>I can do whatever I want. My tongue goes past her pubes and reaches a small lump.</p><hr><p>&quot;Ah, hm......!!!!&quot;</p><p>Tohsaka&#39;s voice gets higher.</p><p>I guess this is stimulating even for her.</p><hr><p>&quot;Hm, in that case\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>&quot;Ah... no...! Ha, ah... ahh...!&quot;</p><p>I push away the skin of the bud with my tongue and expose her clit.</p><p>Her clit is swollen red and I bet it will shake if I poke it.</p><hr><p>&quot;Ha, ah, ahhhh...! N-No, don&#39;t, touch me there...! I-I&#39;ll really hate you if you do...&quot;</p><p>Her tone of voice changed and she sounds like she&#39;s begging now.</p><hr><p>&quot;......?&quot;</p><p>I raise my head to question her.</p><p>&quot;Ah... haa... haa... ha.. Don&#39;t do it. If you touch me there, um... I&#39;ll get an orgasm before you will.&quot;</p><p>Tohsaka confesses.</p><hr><p>&quot;Hm... it&#39;s fine, so put it in... I&#39;m... ready.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>Is she really ready?</p><p>It doesn&#39;t look like she&#39;s wet enough.</p><p>It&#39;s starting to heat up, but it&#39;s not wet at all, and I don&#39;t think I can fit myself in there\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>&quot;......!&quot;</p><p>What should I do?</p><p>I should carry on caressing her in a situation like this, right? I hear it&#39;ll hurt unless I loosen it up with smaller things like my tongue and fingers...</p><hr><p>&quot;...Tohsaka. I know what you were telling me before, but I think I have to lick it at least, or something.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Eh\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015y-you mean lick mine...!?&quot;</p><p>She resists, embarrassment clearly audible in her voice.</p><p>Her genitals are also excretory organs.</p><p>It seems like it&#39;s a big deal for her to have someone put his mouth down there.</p><hr><p>&quot;N-No...! You don&#39;t want to do such a thing, right...!?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I don&#39;t care. I won&#39;t mind doing it to you.&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015! Uh... um. B-But don&#39;t do it.

I&#39;ll go crazy if you do anything more to me, and it&#39;s embarrassing too, so just don&#39;t look at me too much, okay...!?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Oh. I see, so...&quot;</p><p>She&#39;s just like me.</p><p>It&#39;s really embarrassing to get naked and have your body looked at.</p><p>...It was embarrassing for the guy, so it must be even more embarrassing for Tohsaka.</p><p>We&#39;re going to be having sex, but it seems Tohsaka doesn&#39;t want me to look at her vagina.</p><hr><p>&quot;...All right. I&#39;m putting it in, okay?&quot;</p><p>&quot;............&quot;</p><p>She replies by nodding.</p><p>I open up her legs and put my waist between them.</p><p>I grab my erect penis and push it onto her slit\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>&quot;Hah, gu......!&quot;</p><p>Tohsaka jumps.</p><p>I only pushed it in a bit, but Tohsaka reacts violently.</p><hr><p>I hear a wet sound.</p><p>The erect penis goes between Tohsaka&#39;s red slit into her pink walls.</p><hr><p>&quot;Ha\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015ah, ah, mn\u2015\u2015\u2015......!!&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015!&quot;</p><p>Voice escapes my mouth at her hot, narrow hole.</p><p>Tohsaka isn&#39;t that wet as expected.</p><p>As it isn&#39;t wet, I&#39;ll be penetrating into her.</p><hr><p>&quot;Ha\u2015\u2015\u2015ah......! I-It&#39;s coming in...!&quot;</p><p>It feels like I&#39;m ripping it in rather than inserting it.</p><p>Her flesh is tearing as I push in further.</p><hr><p>&quot;......! I, ah... ku, hm...!&quot;</p><p>I stop myself.</p><p>I think I&#39;ll d\u036F something to Tohsaka if I continue.</p><p>Tohsaka is gritting her teeth and bearing it, even though I still don&#39;t even have half of my tip inside of her.</p><hr><p>&quot;Ah\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015haa... haa... ah...&quot;</p><p>Her body is tinted red from her own heat.</p><p>Drops of sweat form on her skin and her fingers are scratching the bed as if to bear my insertion.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>If all this is caused just by inserting my tip into her, then there&#39;s worse to come.</p><p>But I&#39;ve already started.</p><p>I feel Tohsaka already, even though she may only be in pain.</p><hr><p>&quot;Ah... haa... ah... fua.&quot;</p><hr><p>Listening to her pained voice, I barely retain my sanity.</p><p>...I&#39;ll go slow.</p><p>I&#39;ll slowly put it in her so that it won&#39;t be painful.</p><hr><p>&quot;Relax, Tohsaka.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Huh...? Ah, mn...! Hm...!&quot;</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015I slowly push my hips.</p><p>It&#39;s really tight inside of Tohsaka.</p><p>I squeeze myself through her tight walls.</p><p>No, I&#39;m wrenching open her pussy using my wet weapon.</p><hr><p>&quot;Haa, nn, no...! It&#39;s too big, no, it won&#39;t fit\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015...!&quot;</p><p>I don&#39;t feel like I&#39;m being accepted.</p><p>Tohsaka feels only pain, and her body refuses the intruder coming into it.</p><hr><p>&quot;Hah\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015!&quot;</p><p>No, it isn&#39;t just that.</p><p>Her pussy contracts to push out the foreign substance.</p><hr><p>&quot;Ah, na, ah, ku......!&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Ha\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015ahh......!&quot;</p><p>I push it open using force, taking the greatest care not to push in too fast.</p><hr><p>...Damn.</p><p>It must be difficult for Tohsaka, but it&#39;s hard for me as well.</p><p>It mentally tires me to go easy on her, and her vagina is constantly stimulating me.</p><p>Her walls are contracting around me.</p><p>I feel her warmth through my penis.</p><p>The sensation of her fills up my brain.</p><hr><p>&quot;Guh\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>I grunt at the sensation coming from my penis.</p><p>I want to go wild, but I restrain myself.</p><p>...It&#39;s hard for me.</p><p>I might ram it in her all at once if I let my guard down.</p><hr><p>&quot;Ah...

In that case, I guess I will settle for killing just the two of you.&quot;</p><p>Coldness emanates from the sea of mud, and the man before me gives off a murderous intent.</p><p>He already has the Noble Phantasms ready behind him.</p><p>I&#39;ll be skewered the instant I carelessly take a step forward.</p><hr><p>&quot;Hm\u2015\u2015\u2015no, that will be too boring.</p><p>I normally do not allow such a thing, but I shall make an exception for the two of you, just this once.

That&#39;s\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Can you stop him here, Shirou?</p><p>...I know it&#39;s unreasonable, but please hold on until Saber makes it here.

He&#39;s still Sakura&#39;s brother, and I can&#39;t just let him die in front of me. ...And you believe in saving anyone that can be saved, right?&quot;</p><p>Tohsaka runs to the black lake.</p><p>Is she going to go into that mud\u2015\u2015\u2015!?</p><p>&quot;Kuh\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015haha, hahahahahahaha!!!!</p><p>How ridiculous! Are you trying to make me die of laughter!?&quot;</p><p>He laughs, as if to look down at Tohsaka&#39;s determination.</p><p>&quot;What&#39;s so funny...!?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh, is it not comical for you, lowlife?</p><p>Go through that curse? Do you think that a mere human can go through what even a Servant cannot bear!?&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015Heh, don&#39;t take me too lightly.

That was a sword that only a ruler is allowed to use.</p><p>I showed it to you for the fun of it, but it is not something to be used against a lowlife.</p><p>Saber is the only one allowed to fight against it.</p><p>I will not be able to face Saber if I sully it on one such as you.&quot;</p><hr><p>Numerous Noble Phantasms appear.</p><p>But they are all third-rate.</p><p>The difference is obvious after seeing that previous sword.</p><hr><p>But they are not something I can take lightly.</p><p>They are more than enough to kill me.</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015The difference in our powers is the same.</p><p>Even though I managed to survive the previous attack, I cannot match that Servant with my projection.</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh, are you done with your copying? So you finally understand that it is useless, huh?</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015Then disappear. I will not even leave a piece of your copying brain behind\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015!&quot;</p><hr><p>The Noble Phantasms are released.</p><p>But...</p><p>&quot;Shirou...!&quot;</p><p>A blue rushing wind repels them.</p><hr><p>&quot;Saber...!&quot;</p><p>Gilgamesh jumps back instantly.</p><p>Even Gilgamesh is cautious against Saber.</p><p>He wants to avoid hand-to-hand combat with her, as his technique is inferior.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015Good. Are you all right, Shirou?</p><p>Sorry that I am late. I will take over now. Please stay away\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;No. I can manage Gilgamesh by myself. You&#39;re the one to go, Saber.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Wh\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015at?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;W-What are you saying, Shirou...!?</p><p>You will fight him in that state of yours? No, a magus cannot match a Servant in the first place. You should know that...!&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Yeah. But Gilgamesh and I are an exception. Trust me.</p><p>I&#39;ll probably be able to beat him.&quot;</p><p>...Saber gasps.</p><p>Saber is surprised because she believes my words.</p><hr><p>&quot;Please hurry to the back, Saber. Tohsaka is stopping the Holy Grail by herself. You&#39;re the only one who can destroy it.&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>She closes her eyes once.</p><p>A few seconds... No, it&#39;s not even for a second.</p><hr><p>&quot;Good luck. I will go save Rin.&quot;</p><p>She says what I want to hear the most and steps away from Gilgamesh.</p><hr><p>Her silver armor turns away.</p><p>&quot;Saber.&quot;</p><p>I stop her just once.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015I could not save you.&quot;</p><p>And I say it.</p><p>I say it in place of the one who cared for her.</p><hr><p>&quot;I don&#39;t think that Holy Grail is the one you seek.</p><p>...Go take a good look at it so that you won&#39;t make a mistake next time.&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Shirou?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...Sorry. I can&#39;t put this into words real well. I guess I wasn&#39;t fit to be your Master.</p><p>So\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>I couldn&#39;t even figure out your true desire.</p><hr><p>&quot;That is not true. You are my Master, Shirou.&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015Saber.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I shall go fulfill my role as a Servant. We shall talk afterwards.&quot;</p><hr><p>She runs without turning back.</p><p>She is gallant and looks like the wind.</p><hr><p>Saber has left.</p><p>She believed in my promise that I would win and went to save Tohsaka.</p><hr><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Let&#39;s start.</p><hr><p>I have no hesitation now.</p><p>All that&#39;s left is for me to defeat the enemy in front of me.</p><hr><p>&quot;Fu\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015haha, hahahaha!!!!!&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Are you mad? You are letting go of your only chance of victory so that you can save that girl?</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015Idiot. It is a lie to sacrifice yourself. You are a true hypocrite for not being able to realize that.</p><p>Yes, I shall praise you for that.&quot;</p><hr><p>The Noble Phantasms are set.</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015There are about thirty of them.</p><p>If I want to block them, I&#39;ll have to create it.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Imitations, faker, huh? Yeah, that doesn&#39;t sound too bad. I certainly am a faker.&quot;</p><p>I raise my arm.</p><p>I close one eye and look inside of me.</p><hr><p>&quot;Hm\u2015\u2015\u2015?&quot;</p><p>&quot;...I had the wrong idea. My magecraft isn&#39;t creating swords. First of all, I can&#39;t do such a skillful thing.&quot;</p><hr><p>That&#39;s right.</p><p>Tohsaka said it too. I can only use one kind of magecraft.</p><p>Strengthening and projection are just a byproduct of it.</p><hr><p>&quot;...That&#39;s right. There&#39;s only one thing I can do, and that is to put shape to my mind.&quot;</p><p>I grab my right hand with my left and glare at Gilgamesh.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015I am the bone of my sword.&quot;</p><p>I cast the spell.</p><p>Casting is only a suggestion to change myself.</p><p>These words are to connect Emiya Shirou.</p><hr><p>&quot;I see. I am done with hearing your nonsense.&quot;</p><p>The numerous Noble Phantasms are released.</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015I&#39;ll make it.</p><p>This is why one of my eyes is open.</p><p>I pull out a shield from the hill to block the oncoming Noble Phantasms\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015!</p><hr><p>&quot;Guh\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015!&quot;</p><p>The swarm of swords batter against the shield.</p><p>The shield is me myself.</p><p>My body breaks up as each petal of the shield is pierced and damaged.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015Steel is my body, and fire is my blood.&quot;</p><p>There&#39;s only one place I need to reach.</p><p>The flowing power fills me to capacity in an instant.</p><hr><p>&quot;Wh\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015at?&quot;</p><p>What caused his shock?</p><p>Is it his Noble Phantasms that cannot penetrate through a single shield, or is it the magical energy in front of him?</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015I have created over a thousand blades.</p><p>Unaware of loss.</p><p>Nor aware of gain.&quot;</p><hr><p>It breaks.</p><p>The overflowing magical energy cannot be controlled.</p><p>Magical energy ten times the capacity of the circuit breaks its foundations trying to escape\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015I cannot break through\u2015\u2015\u2015?&quot;</p><p>Blood trickles from my mouth.</p><p>The shield is full of holes now.</p><p>Even though the Noble Phantasms did not reach me, my body is full of holes.</p><p>But still\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015Withstood pain to create weapons.</p><p>Waiting for one&#39;s arrival.&quot;</p><p>The magical energy rages around.</p><p>But I don&#39;t care.</p><p>This body is a circuit specialized to use this &quot;one magecraft&quot; from the start.</p><p>Then there should be more.</p><p>There should be something beyond this if I can&#39;t make it with this circuit.</p><hr><p>...No, it is already there.</p><p>It&#39;s just that I can&#39;t see it.</p><p>There was no limitation to the circuit from the start.</p><p>If it was darkness, not a wall, that stopped the magical energy...</p><p>Then the limit is somewhere beyond the darkness\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015I have no regrets.
