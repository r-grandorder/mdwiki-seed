However, it is not that she doesn&#39;t have much in the ways of emotion; rather, she is the type that thinks too much and ended up stuffed with emotion inside.</p><p>Furthermore, her mask is not simply for hiding her eyes, but also for sealing her &quot;Mystic Eyes Cybele&quot; that petrifies anything they gaze at; the Mystic Eyes slaying Noble Phantasm &quot;Dark Temple (Breaker Gorgon)&quot;.</p><p>In battle, she is ruthless and without mercy, willing to prey on unrelated innocents without hesitation if it&#39;s by her Master order in the Holy Grail War.</p><p>On the other hand, she displays a degree of kindness to those who is not antagonistic towards her Master.</p><p>Her appearing indifferent and coldblooded is simply due to her feeling it to be bothersome otherwise, said Artoria.</p><p>She likes alcohol, and her hobby is reading.</p><p>Being summoned as Rider, it seemed like she had grown a fondness towards bicycle.</p><p>Due to being pushed around by her cruel and willful sisters, Stheno and Euryale, she ended up ingrained with a pessimistic nature. It seemed that this sort of power relationship doesn&#39;t change even after they became Heroic Spirit, with her being abused with those two&#39;s unreasonable demands even in Chaldea.</p><p>Although she is a tall and beautiful woman with outstanding build, her standard for beauty is &quot;small and cute&quot;; due to that, she holds a complex towards her own height and grown-up build. As she materialize, that complex of her ended up stirred towards girls with petite build such as Artoria.</p><h2 id="attitude-towards-master" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#attitude-towards-master" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Attitude Towards Master</h2><p>She is, at the very least, display loyalty towards the Master.

Medusa was reduced to a snake monster that turns everything she gazes at into stone. She then was cornered by the hero Perseus by means of his many Noble Phantasms, and ended up having her neck severed.</p><p>Both of her sisters had been &quot;perfect&quot; goddess from birth, and so they did not grow; however, Medusa herself did grow due to being an &quot;imperfect&quot; goddess. That is the cause of her looking older than her elder sisters.</p><h2 id="character-in-fgo" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#character-in-fgo" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Character in FGO</h2><p>She did not make any standing out appearance up to 5th chapter, but each of her sisters did appear; Stheno as an Assassin during the 2nd chapter of &quot;Empire of Eternal Madness, Septem&quot; and Euryale as an Archer during the 3rd chapter of &quot;Sealed Ends of the Four Seas, Okeanos&quot;, and etc. The sisters&#39; heartwarming (?) episodes are depicted in interlude stories and others.</p><h2 id="role-in-past-works" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#role-in-past-works" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Role in past works</h2><p>In &quot;Fate/stay night&quot;, she appears as the Servant of the Matou clan&#39;s magus.
