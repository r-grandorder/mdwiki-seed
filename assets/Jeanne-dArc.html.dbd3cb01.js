She is a holy maiden whose name is known not just in France, but across the whole wide world.</p><p>At one point in the year 1839, the number of books that depicted Jeanne as a Heroine had reached five hundred, and as of now in the present time, it is easy to imagine that such books of an unimaginable number have been published. She had set off on a trip for the sake of saving France at seventeen-years-old, and she was sentenced to death by burning at nineteen-years-old. Her activity in merely two years (though given that one of those years was her being in the position of prisoner, it was really about one year) has rewritten the history of the world.</p><p>Saying \u201CI heard a voice from Heaven\u201D, Jeanne leapt out of her own house, relied on the connections of those who believed in her words, and met with Charles VII. At this moment, Jeanne \u2013 who earned Charles VII\u2019s trust by exactly and correctly guessing who he was when the latter had disguised and concealed himself as a subordinate \u2013 commanded a group of troops and continued to steadily advance, before she finally liberated Orl\xE9ans. For the French army who had defeat occur again and again, this victory was something evidently miraculous. Because of this, the name of Jeanne d\u2019Arc resounded not only in France, but even in Italy and Germany. After Orl\xE9ans was liberated, the English Crown had even ordered for discipline on their own troops whom refused to cross over into France. The soldiers were afraid of being cursed by Jeanne d\u2019Arc\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014the Witch who turned the war situation around. When taking the situation into account at that time, depending on the trend of the Hundred Years\u2019 War, the possibility that \u2018The very country called France could be annihilated\u2018 has not even been able to be discarded completely, and it may not be known that (although there are the French Revolution\u2019s very many good points and bad points themselves) the advanced/democratic social system itself could have gotten a very late start in France.</p><p>It is being said that the start of Jeanne\u2019s fall came about because of her confrontation with Charles VII. After the coronation at Reims, Jeanne and those supporters of hers further attempted to advance towards Paris, but concerning Charles, who desired peace, she was gradually becoming an obstacle. Thus, in the Battle of Compi\xE8gne, Jeanne encountered a scathing betrayal where the gate that should have ushered her in as she was defending the rear guard at the time of her force\u2019s withdrawal had closed on her instead, and she was then captured.</p><p>Here is the glory of Jeanne d\u2019Arc so far, and the time it took for that was but one year. And then, the remaining year were days like Hell where Jeanne suffered all sorts of pains as one in the position of prisoner. Regarding Charles VII, he never paid for her ransom, and various theories were given for that, but in any case, as Gilles de Rais lamented, Jeanne had actually become a figure that was cast away by the state called France. Nonetheless, for the English side, they had to execute her not as a Saint, but as a Witch. So they accordingly gathered top-notch theologians, before they tried to denounce the revelations she received, her deeds, and her very existence\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014It was the beginning of an Inquisition. But Jeanne, who should be an illiterate country girl, eloquently responded to their inquiries and further saw through their traps that were set up from the standpoint of theology. Ultimately, with the trivial crime of having disguised herself as a man (for on the occasion of travelling, although it was called a crime, it was a custom for women to disguise themselves as men for the sake of protecting themselves from being raped, and it was something minor enough to be overlooked), she had been sentenced to death by burning at the stake. About twenty-five years had passed since her death, and she, who was cursed at for being a Witch and a prostitute, had her honour finally restored to her due to a reinstated trial that was carried out under Charles VII\u2019s command.</p><p>Jeanne did not care that much about suffering the humiliating experience of being burned at the stake, and after all, she was even resolved on top of that to be in the role of prisoner\u2026 Rather, is it not right for her in being able to have the resolve to also accept any kind of future? Even following what has been told repeatedly in either the genuine work or in other works, Jeanne does not recognize that she herself is a Saint. \u2018It\u2019s possible for an occurrence where someone has received a revelation to occur for anybody, and I can say with confidence that it was unexpectedly just me who was chosen for that occurrence.\u2019 \u2018Revelations can be given to all human beings, and I can say with confidence that if anyone prays to receive them, then they\u2019re bound to receive them.\u2019 But in the end, a person who took the trouble to receive those revelations did not appear in her lifetime.</p><p>From the episode where she did not pull out her sword even once during her lifetime, Jeanne uses a flag as her weapon without making use of the sword hung on her waist. \u201CLa Pucelle: The Crimson Holy Maiden\u201D is a Special Attack Noble Phantasm where flames blossom in full glory not from the sword\u2019s blade, but from its hilt. It is an article where in the case that it is employed, Jeanne herself will also be extinguished. Without looking back on the life that she ran through, the Holy Maiden named Jeanne d\u2019Arc constantly keeps her eye on the future. Even though she can lead the living, Jeanne knows that she cannot walk alongside them for she is already part of the deceased; but even despite knowing this, she will smile seemingly with contentment.</p><h2 id="related-characters" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#related-characters" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Related Characters</h2><p><strong>Jeanne d\u2019Arc (Alter)</strong></p><p>The girl who coercively came to force herself in from the other side of the coin. However, be that there was a time where they had opposed each other, Jeanne is a little happy when Jeanne Alter transformed into a Servant in that it is sort of like a vulgar younger sister was made, and she must never, ever let said person hear that.</p><p><strong>Gilles de Rais (Saber)</strong></p><p>Jeanne\u2019s former brethren.

At that time, Jeanne was being considered as a character who feels like she forms a pair with Artoria, and if Artoria is treated as a girl knight, then Jeanne was consciously designed so that she becomes an older female knight in comparison to Artoria. For her Third Stage in FateGO, I collected all of my focus on the concept of a \u201CHoly Maiden\u201D that was left out at the time of her design, so concerning the result, I am thinking, \u2018I wonder if I successfully brought out that characteristic into prominence.\u2019 (Takeuchi Takashi)</p><h2 id="material-images" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#material-images" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Material Images</h2><p><img src="https://github.com/Assets-I/Materials/blob/main/fgo-material-II/i-180.jpg?raw=true" alt=""></p><p><img src="https://github.com/Assets-I/Materials/blob/main/fgo-material-II/i-181.jpg?raw=true" alt=""></p><p><img src="https://github.com/Assets-I/Materials/blob/main/fgo-material-II/i-182.jpg?raw=true" alt=""></p><p><img src="https://github.com/Assets-I/Materials/blob/main/fgo-material-II/i-183.jpg?raw=true" alt=""></p><p><img src="https://github.com/Assets-I/Materials/blob/main/fgo-material-II/i-184.jpg?raw=true" alt=""></p><p><img src="https://github.com/Assets-I/Materials/blob/main/fgo-material-II/i-185.jpg?raw=true" alt=""></p><p><img src="https://github.com/Assets-I/Materials/blob/main/fgo-material-II/i-186.jpg?raw=true" alt=""></p><p><img src="https://github.com/Assets-I/Materials/blob/main/fgo-material-II/i-187.jpg?raw=true" alt=""></p><p><img src="https://github.com/Assets-I/Materials/blob/main/fgo-material-II/i-188.jpg?raw=true" alt=""></p><p><img src="https://github.com/Assets-I/Materials/blob/main/fgo-material-II/i-189.jpg?raw=true" alt=""></p><h2 id="dialogue" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#dialogue" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Dialogue</h2><table><thead><tr><th style="text-align:left;">Occassion</th><th style="text-align:center;">English</th><th style="text-align:center;">Japanese</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style="text-align:left;">Summoned</td><td style="text-align:center;"></td><td style="text-align:center;"></td></tr></tbody></table>', 76);
