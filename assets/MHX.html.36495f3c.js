(Munch...munch...)</p><p><strong>B\uFF1A???:</strong><br> ...So sweet...and warm...</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> ...You must have been hungry. Well, I&#39;m not sure that even counts as a good deed.</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> Out in the vastness of space, I hear there&#39;s even a hero who lets you eat his head.

All right, Ex!</p><p><strong>Ex:</strong><br> Ah...yes... That&#39;s...fine.</p><p><strong>God Bless Edison:</strong><br> Very well. Ex.</p><p><strong>God Bless Edison:</strong><br> I know you must want to enroll in this school, but it doesn&#39;t accept just anybody.</p><p><strong>God Bless Edison:</strong><br> It&#39;s a school where heroic Servants are raised by experienced, active Servants working as teachers.</p><p><strong>God Bless Edison:</strong><br> Thus, those who wish to enroll must have certain qualifications!</p><p><strong>Ex:</strong><br> ...Qualifications...?</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> Don&#39;t be stupid, principal! You were just complaining that the school is in the red because there were so many dropouts from the tough curriculum!</p><p><strong>God Bless Edison:</strong><br> Those are separate issues! As different as AC and DC!</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> I see. So, there&#39;s not much difference.</p><p><strong>Ex:</strong><br> ...I want...to enroll. I want to become a great Servant.</p><p><strong>Ex:</strong><br> I&#39;ll make the tuition thing work. So...please...</p><p><strong>God Bless Edison:</strong><br> It seems like your words are sincere. You have passed the first entrance exam.</p><p><strong>God Bless Edison:</strong><br> And while we&#39;re here. X, you be her opponent.</p><p><strong>God Bless Edison:</strong><br> We&#39;ll hold a mock battle. Based on the result of that, I shall judge whether you can enroll or not!</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> Okay... It seems wrong that a student is in charge of testing another student, but I guess this is just what comes with being an upperclassman. I&#39;ll do it.</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> ...Heh. In other words, a part-time job with the school principal&#39;s full permission. I&#39;ll get at least a week&#39;s worth of lunch vouchers out of this!</p><p><strong>God Bless Edison:</strong><br> No. If anything, this is a secret deal. You do know that buying food from outside vendors is prohibited.</p><p><strong>God Bless Edison:</strong><br> I&#39;ll turn a blind eye to it if you win. Also, if you lose to her, I will double your tuition.</p><p><strong>God Bless Edison:</strong><br> Do you think that&#39;s unreasonable? No, call me a capitalistic gentleman! It just means you&#39;re going to be paying for her tuition as well!</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> So you&#39;re saying that whatever the outcome, the school won&#39;t lose anything, AND will gain another student!</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> Why you, what a sharp way of thinking! It&#39;s hard to believe you&#39;re a lion. Are you by chance human!?</p><p><strong>God Bless Edison:</strong><br> I keep telling you I&#39;m a human! Not having any toe beans is proof!</p><p><strong>God Bless Edison:</strong><br> Ah, no, that&#39;s not what I mean. Ex...</p><p><strong>God Bless Edison:</strong><br> X may act rowdy like she does, ditch classes, and sometimes battle active Servants...</p><p><strong>God Bless Edison:</strong><br> ...but she is still our star pupil. She&#39;s pretty strong. She even uses ninja skills. Will you still fight?</p><p><strong>Ex:</strong><br> Star...</p><p><strong>Ex:</strong><br> Yes. I will.</p><p><strong>Ex:</strong><br> X, please be my opponent!</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> I like that attitude! I&#39;m not going to complain about my stomach being empty, but I wholeheartedly accept any newbies with spirit!</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> Ex, this is payback for that red bean bun!

Sometimes...it gets confused.</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> Hm...Ex. You still need something?</p><p><strong>Ex:</strong><br> That thing is with me.

A roommate!?</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> I had...a single room all to myself, something that can&#39;t normally be enjoyed on backwater planets! My sweet, private school life...!</p><p><strong>Ex:</strong><br> These were the orders from the student support division, so there&#39;s no mistake. Besides, this room is obviously big enough for two students.</p><p><strong>Ex:</strong><br> Everything on this side of the line is my territory. This space will be our common area.</p><p><strong>Ex:</strong><br> Also I&#39;m going to pull this juice bottle out of our fridge.

Th-that&#39;ll cause an explosion!</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> Now that I look closely, you look a lot like me! No wonder I did so poorly in that mock battle!</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> Even though I held back! You really went all-out on me, and it hurt!</p><p><strong>Ex:</strong><br> That... Likewise. Thank you.</p><p><strong>Ex:</strong><br> There will be the two of us here from now on, so I ask you to be quieter, please.</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> What the... Are you taking over the room already!? Instead of waiting for you to sleep, maybe I&#39;ll slice you up right now!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> (Um, no fighting, please.)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> (She already has her sword out!)</p><hr><p><strong>Ex:</strong><br> Careful. Black Knight, stand back. You might get caught in X&#39;s weak beam crossfires.</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> Are you calling my sword moves \u201Cweak beams\u201D? Tsk. I didn&#39;t realize you were a Servant of sick burns. Are you perhaps a literary genius?</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> Hmph, as a science buff, I don&#39;t think you and I could get along. I suggest you move to another room\u2014</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> (X is more versed in physical sports.)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> (Haha, science buff... Good one.)</p><hr><p><strong>X:</strong><br> Here&#39;s a lesson for you! Physical punishment! I saw it in your eyes!</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> Why you! Why are you protecting that Voloid!?</p><p><strong>Ex:</strong><br> Because Black Knight is correct. And your reaction. You just said it yourself!</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> You may be a nerd, but your swordsmanship is spot-on. I actually sense that you have some formal training in your background.</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> Heh... Heh, heh. Interesting!</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> Whether you be an Assassin or Berserker, if you&#39;re a Saberface, then you&#39;re definitely a Saber!</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> Okay then, I&#39;m going to get serious now! I don&#39;t have anything against you, but I will cut down all Sabers!</p><p><strong>Ex:</strong><br> No\u2014 That&#39;s right, I&#39;m a Saber! Fine! That&#39;s how it will be!</p><p><strong>Ex:</strong><br> By thinking that, I feel like a burden has been lifted...I think.</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> I understand that feeling very well! But give up, because your Saber days are over!</p><p><strong>Girls&#39; Dorm Supervisor:</strong></p><p>You two are too noisy!</p><p><strong>Girls&#39; Dorm Supervisor:</strong><br> Stop your fighting!

All while having no idea people are wondering where she is.</p><p><strong>Ex:</strong><br> I&#39;m...just worried about all the \u201Cuse by\u201D dates on her food in the fridge.</p><p><strong>Ex:</strong><br> What should we do...Black Knight...?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> (Oh no, not this mind-only warp again!)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> (She seems sad...?)</p><hr><p><strong>Ex:</strong><br> I&#39;ve been having fuzzy memories lately.</p><p><strong>Ex:</strong><br> Some pretty men are sitting around a black round table, and they&#39;re drinking. And I&#39;m just sitting there, looking bored...</p><p><strong>Ex:</strong><br> Then then someone special to me secretly gives me candy. It tasted sweet...</p><p><strong>Ex:</strong><br> But then the hotties disappear from their seats at the round table one by one, like petals dropping from a wilting flower.</p><p><strong>Ex:</strong><br> The quiet round table wasn&#39;t bad. As long as that one man was there.</p><p><strong>Ex:</strong><br> Being in my empty room reminds me of that scene.</p><p><strong>Ex:</strong><br> A knock. ...Come in.</p><p><strong>Ex:</strong><br> ...?</p><p><strong>Ex:</strong><br> Why aren&#39;t you coming in? Is the door broken?</p><p><strong>B\uFF1A???:</strong><br> I&#39;m just killing time in the halls, Lizardlet.</p><p><strong>B\uFF1A???:</strong><br> I don&#39;t mind people seeing us talking, but I don&#39;t want our conversation to be recorded.</p><p><strong>Ex:</strong><br> You&#39;re disguising your voice? Who are you? What do you want?</p><p><strong>B\uFF1A???:</strong><br> I&#39;ll just say that I&#39;m a classmate. Spies for the Villain Alliance are everywhere.</p><p><strong>B\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Even in this school of heroic Servants.</p><p><strong>Ex:</strong><br> Villain...Alliance... Inside the school...</p><p><strong>Ex:</strong><br> ...In a way, I&#39;m relieved. You seem to be an elite agent.</p><p><strong>Ex:</strong><br> Not like that striped-pants Elisa, who always herself caught in the traps she sets for X and me.</p><p><strong>Ex:</strong><br> I was so worried she might be the spy. But it looks like I was wrong.</p><p><strong>B\uFF1A???:</strong></p><p>Gwah! A-ahem!</p><p><strong>B\uFF1A???:</strong><br> ...They will soon come for you. Be ready to meet them.</p><p><strong>B\uFF1A???:</strong><br> I&#39;m talking about those who believe you have fighting potential, after the reports they&#39;ve received from spies here.</p><p><strong>B\uFF1A???:</strong><br> A large-scale attack by the Villains will soon start. It&#39;ll be a Death Tour, with enough power to destroy an entire planet.</p><p><strong>B\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Heroine X will likely not return. And even if she did, she could not save this place.</p><p><strong>B\uFF1A???:</strong><br> See you, docile Berserker. School life with you was quite entertaining.</p><p><strong>Ex:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Ex:</strong><br> Leave...the school...</p><p><strong>Ex:</strong><br> I knew that this day, would come. I didn&#39;t think X would be first. But.</p><p><strong>Ex:</strong><br> But...there is still something I need to do.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> (I have a bad feeling about this...)</p><p><strong>Ex:</strong><br> You don&#39;t have to be so worried, Black Knight.</p><p><strong>Ex:</strong><br> I secretly collected parts bit by bit, so you&#39;ve powered up quite a bit.</p><p><strong>Ex:</strong><br> If you can help me again...that would be great.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> (Ex wears leggings...)</p><p><strong>Ex:</strong><br> Black Knight...your eye movements are a little creepy.</p><p><strong>Ex:</strong><br> Maybe there&#39;s still some weird programming left. I&#39;m going to change, so go out in the hall.</p><p><strong>Ex:</strong><br> Come on, hurry.</p><hr><p><strong>Babbagen:</strong><br> Beep boop. So you were the one who called me out here to the dark side of the school.</p><p><strong>Babbagen:</strong><br> Data extraction. Found: a traditional school yard callout to settle old scores. In other words, there&#39;s an one hundred percent possibility that a secret art will be passed on due to graduation.</p><p><strong>Babbagen:</strong><br> ...Good. Preparing to deploy Noble Phantasm for self-defense.</p><p><strong>Babbagen:</strong><br> With my fantasy, my ideal, my dream...the time has come for you to awaken to the appeal of steam!</p><p><strong>Ex:</strong><br> ...No, that&#39;s not what we&#39;re talking about. I wanted to ask you some personal questions before the battle started, Professor Babbagen.</p><p><strong>Ex:</strong><br> I know you are busy, and you are not around the school much. Tonight was my only chance.</p><p><strong>Babbagen:</strong><br> ...Hm. Steam pressure...dropping. What kind of lecture do you desire, Servant candidate?</p><p><strong>Ex:</strong><br> Please tell me...</p><p><strong>Ex:</strong><br> On the planet Lothian, I believe you once battled against a dark lord.</p><p><strong>Ex:</strong><br> That information is strictly confidential, and it is not even in the school&#39;s database. Could you tell me the details...</p><p><strong>Ex:</strong><br> And tell me what fate befell the black lord!?</p><p><strong>Babbagen:</strong><br> Confidential data, number SA80T521X. Punitive expedition of the planet Lothian.</p><p><strong>Babbagen:</strong><br> Such information is strictly confidential. Of course, revealing such information to a common student candidate is not permissible.</p><p><strong>Ex:</strong><br> All right, then! I have no choice but to tear our your memory media and read it myself!</p><p><strong>Ex:</strong><br> And...above all...</p><p><strong>Ex:</strong><br> My heart...is burning and screaming at me that I need to defeat you!</p><p><strong>Babbagen:</strong><br> Hm. I am a gentleman, and a scholar who abhors physical violence.</p><p><strong>Babbagen:</strong><br> Yet I am also aware that I must defend myself against any attack. Student or not, I will not hold back.</p><p><strong>Babbagen:</strong><br> Your burning heart... Show me if it can best my steam power armor!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Babbagen:</strong><br> ...Left and right manipulators...stopped. I have sustained critical damage.</p><p><strong>Babbagen:</strong><br> ...Candidate Ex.</p><p><strong>Ex:</strong><br> Yes, Professor Babbagen.</p><p><strong>Babbagen:</strong><br> You were a good student. A truly good student. You were one of the few who sincerely listened to my lectures.</p><p><strong>Babbagen:</strong><br> You sat in front of the class, and I remember you always wiping your fogged up glasses.</p><p><strong>Ex:</strong><br> ...It was tough. It was as tough as eating mochi topped with powdered chestnut without hands...</p><p><strong>Babbagen:</strong><br> ...You have utterly defeated me.</p><p><strong>Babbagen:</strong><br> You so accurately pinpointed my armor&#39;s weaknesses. I can think of no better sign that you studied well.</p><p><strong>Babbagen:</strong><br> I do not have enough information to understand the entire situation, but I can hypothesize about the outcome.</p><p><strong>Babbagen:</strong><br> Ex, you are planning to leave, are you not?</p><p><strong>Ex:</strong><br> Professor, I...</p><p><strong>Ex:</strong><br> I just couldn&#39;t like you. I couldn&#39;t help this hatred I felt toward you.</p><p><strong>Ex:</strong><br> But I always liked your lectures. I truly did.</p><p><strong>Babbagen:</strong><br> ...Ah, a student completes her studies and departs. That is every teacher&#39;s joy...</p><p><strong>Babbagen:</strong><br> As your reward, I shall tell you. The dark lord&#39;s name is... \u201CSir Agravain.\u201D</p><p><strong>Ex:</strong><br> Agra...vain...!</p><p><strong>Babbagen:</strong><br> He was a senior member of the group called the Dark R.O.U.N.D.S.</p><p><strong>Babbagen:</strong><br> As the descendant of a clan that alchemizes artificial Servants, the work he inherited was truly evil.</p><p><strong>Babbagen:</strong><br> The Heroine Zs earlier were just incomplete fakes. What he was searching for was something beyond that... A crystallized form of magecraft.</p><p><strong>Babbagen:</strong><br> But we have been able to determine that he was not successful.</p><p><strong>Ex:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Babbagen:</strong><br> Agravain fought valiantly, but he was no match for the overwhelming pressure of my steam.</p><p><strong>Babbagen:</strong><br> In the end, he tumbled down into the castle&#39;s reactor core.</p><p><strong>Babbagen:</strong><br> Whether it was accidental or intentional, I cannot say.</p><p><strong>Babbagen:</strong><br> Not long after, the castle collapsed.</p><p><strong>Babbagen:</strong><br> We conducted a thorough search, but were unable to locate his body.</p><p><strong>Babbagen:</strong><br> At the same time, the secret ceremonial rites for the creation of artificial Servants were also lost. That&#39;s what I...report...ed.</p><p><strong>Ex:</strong><br> Professor...Professor Babbagen.</p><p><strong>Ex:</strong><br> ...Ungh.</p><p><strong>Ex:</strong><br> Agravain...Agravain...!</p><p><strong>Ex:</strong><br> My Master... Revenge...!</p><p><strong>Ex:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Ex:</strong><br> ...It&#39;s impossible...</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Aren&#39;t you going to finish him off? Wouldn&#39;t that be more elegant?</p><p><strong>Ex:</strong><br> ...!</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Encased within his armor, the critical steam will release, cutting off his vision and breathing, and soon after, a world of extreme cold will await him.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> He&#39;s an extremely troublesome enemy.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> ...iii...</p><p><strong>Ex:</strong><br> ...Are you the one who is here to get me, as the agent said?</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> ...Indeed, Lord Pendragon.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> The final knight of the fallen Dark R.O.U.N.D.S. ...To think you would be hiding here, right under his nose.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> ...Hmph. The villain may not always be evil, while the \u201Cgood guy\u201D may not always be working for the weak.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> A school intended to educate heroic Servants? Laughable. You know that the moment it becomes a public facility, it also becomes a pawn of those in power, don&#39;t you?</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Never mind. Now we need to think of how to deal with you, Lord Pendragon.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> The reports said you had lost your memories, but by the look of it, you seem to understand what is going on.</p><p><strong>Ex:</strong><br> Pendragon... Yes, that is the True Name I was given.</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong><br> My name is Heroine X Alter. The Ultimate Anti-Anti-Saber Weapon!</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Hahahahaha! Wonderful. Let us celebrate your new journey!</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> I welcome you as a new member of the Villain Alliance. You shall serve me directly!</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Admittedly, I am an outsider within the Alliance. But that means you will have absolute freedom in your job! What a wonderful position!</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong><br> ...I see. I&#39;m actually more keen on being told what to do.</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong><br> But I do have one wish.</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong><br> I would like to take one Voloid with me. AUX Voloid K6-X4.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Hm? What a piece of junk. Fine. Doesn&#39;t look like much, though.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Board my container-shaped infiltration ship. We will return at once to the mothership, and convene with the other alliance members.</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong><br> Please, give me ninety seconds to prepare.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Understood. I will await you in the ship.</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong><br> ...Black Knight. I have...something to ask you.</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong><br> I finally figured out what was wrong with you.</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong><br> You have a tiny shard of crystallized Alternium embedded in your head. It was being used to track me.</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong><br> That crystal had been receiving mana waves leaking through the cracks of multidimensional space.</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong><br> It seems, coincidentally, that you were on the same wavelength as someone else&#39;s mind. They would appear to be a mage.</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong><br> But we are headed to a battlefield. Information leaks and unknown elements cannot be permitted.</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong><br> I&#39;m going to remove the cause of the problem.</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong><br> Maybe you&#39;re still listening to my words through this Black Knight as a vessel.</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong><br> If you are...I would like to say goodbye.</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong><br> Having someone listen to me when I needed it... I think that was nice.</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong><br> When I succeed, and make a name for myself as a Servant...maybe we can talk like this again.</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong><br> When that time comes...</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong><br> No, that&#39;s just wishful thinking. She and my deceased Master would both laugh at that thought.</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong><br> See you. Whoever it is, from a Servant Universe far, far away...</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong><br> May the Alternium be with you, always...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...Whoa! Chaldea!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Did I fall asleep?</p><hr><p><strong>X:</strong><br> Have you awoken, Master? How was sleeping at the nice warm kotatsu?</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> It was good? I&#39;m glad to hear! But Mash seems to be a little disappointed.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...!</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> She seems to have kind of made a hobby of watching Master sleep. I don&#39;t understand that allure at all!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Ah, ah! Shhhhh. X, I told you to please keep that a secret...!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> This kotatsu we inherited from Doctor&#39;s room is a Noble Phantasm to be feared!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Um... It&#39;s so that Senpai will remain healthy...</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> Let&#39;s just keep it that way. This mikan is delicious! This iyokan citrus is sour!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Heroine X... I just saw someone with your face?</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> What? Is there something on my face? (Sigh) Fine. Then have a good look at it.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> H-hey! Please! Both of you! Your faces are too close!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> (This one wears bloomers...)</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> Wha...? This is a special spacesuit! It&#39;s a wardrobe essential for those who follow the Star of Altria!</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> Well, they were on sale at the school&#39;s store, so I bought them all up.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> What are you talking about?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> (Sigh) ...Master, were you dreaming? Eh? Not a dream!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Hm...hm... Those are some hazy details.</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> Eh? Did I ever have a BFF?</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> Oh, come on. I don&#39;t remember anything like that. Sounds like space opera nonsense to me!</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> But...yeah. I did have someone I considered a troublesome rival.</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> Oh? You want to hear all about it? Uh... Well, it&#39;s not really an interesting story...</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> It&#39;s not like I defeated a space dragon, or won first place in a race through the Saint Quartz Run...</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> This story isn&#39;t as flashy as all that. It&#39;s just a story about ordinary school life.</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> Sheesh. I wonder how she&#39;s doing... That Saber who was energized by Japanese sweets...</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> No, no. Forget about that. Let&#39;s talk about releasing the long-awaited EPII!</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> I got excited thinking this quest was going to be about that, so I&#39;ve been waiting patiently next to Master this whole time!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I-is that so? Anyway, it looks like you are still going to be talking.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> We have run out of both mikan and tea, so I shall go get some more.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Thanks, Mash. What would you like, X?</p><hr><p><strong>X:</strong><br> Any Japanese sweets. We are sitting at a kotatsu, after all.</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> Sometimes the flavor of corruption isn&#39;t so bad!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes, understood. I shall go check the kitchen!</p>', 467);
