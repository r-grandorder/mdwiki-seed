I\u2019m healed at a white beach\u2026<br> A point I figured out is that, because the event moves forward from its initial state, there\u2019s the matter of keeping the circumstances of wearing a straight swimsuit from the start.

Hey, although I\u2019m saying this in the confusion of the moment, that being the case, I\u2019m also waiting for a request to draw a swimsuit for a male Servant! Because!
