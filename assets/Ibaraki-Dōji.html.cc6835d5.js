Though it&#39;s pretty close to harassment.</p><p>To summarize it, she is self aware of her responsibility as the child of her noble mother, to have the last of onis, eradicated by humans, act as a group.<br> On order to do that, Ibaraki established a standard rule, and any of the onis that break said rules, she would spank with iron staff. (Of course, Shuten is the sole exception.)<br> She is a demon, so from the human viewpoints she is unmistakably a wicked beast. But at her root, she is a belle who respects order and ponders over the fate of her brethren.</p><p>While her appearance exudes innocence, that very state of being is that of an oni. Hurting humans, devouring humans, loving blood.<br> However, she does not have much disposition in the way of selfishly enjoying slaughter and massacre. Her nature is not that of an oni that bring disorder to the world; in the end, she devours humans as an oni, as a living being. One can say that she is close to that of a wild animal.<br> For example, even if she appears to be fascinated with sweets, her nature is indeed not that of a young human girl. Depending on the circumstances, she just might devour even the human who enticed her with sweets.<br> Never ever take a lion for a cat.<br> Never. Ever. Yet...<br> If one actually succeeds on feeding her, she just might display a lovely smile.</p><h2 id="attitude-towards-master" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#attitude-towards-master" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Attitude Towards Master</h2><p>Her wish upon the Holy Grail is &quot;to see the smiling face of Shuten.&quot;<br> The smile of her stepsibling, one without worry, without sorrow, without hesitation, is the source of Ibaraki&#39;s everything.<br> Be it the famed in Kyoto Abe no Seimei, or Minamoto no Raikou, or her powerful Four Heavenly Kings.

At Rashoumon (or perhaps at the bridge of Ichijo Modoribashi) Ibaraki Douji assaulted Watanabe no Tsuna, who severed Ibaraki Douji&#39;s hand .

In other words, Shuten Douji. Indeed, it was only appropriate for the Abe no Seimei, the authority of ancient Kyoto, to pay attention to such a being. However, the one who in reality lead over the onis of Mount Ooe is no other than Ibaraki Douji.<br> The strong but excessively pleasure-seeking Shuten had not a even a bit of interest of leading over the swarm of onis. As far as she is concerned, the only one who could lead the bunch of onis being drawn by Shuten&#39;s position as the &quot;master who controls the mouintain&quot; is her equal, Ibaraki Douji, and no other.</p><p>Ibaraki Douji had been the one who built a solemnly majestic palace in Mount Ooe. She had loved her stepsibling, the one brought up together with her, the pleasure seeking Shuten Douji. She had led the thousand strong mass of oni, and had performed many atrocities in ancient Kyoto. The savage demon who had led the people to fall into fear and dread.</p><p>Her status as an oni is high ranked; a sharp-witted fierce commander whose strong point is guerilla warfare.<br> If you think about it, together with her army of onis, she should have crushed any kind of human&#39;s strength, even it it is Raikou and the Four Heavenly Kings. (Or at least that&#39;s what she thought.)</p><p>The one thing that tore down Ibaraki Douji&#39;s stronghold, is no other than the pleasure of Shuten Douji, her stepsibling who she should love more than anything.<br> For the sake of speaking with Sakata Kintoki, she had guided Raikou and the Four Heavenly Kings, and even while knowing it was poison, she had drank the Shinpenkidoku (Providential Oni Poison). It was the height of pleasure for Shuten Douji.<br> And Ibaraki Douji failed to stop her.</p><h2 id="standard-weapons" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#standard-weapons" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Standard Weapons</h2><p>A slash by means of a large war sword.<br> The kotsutou (bone blade).

The beginning concept was a deformed sort of gross-but-cute. Eventually what&#39;s left is only her hands and feet, her nonexistent eyebrow, and her long horns; but in the initial concept she even doesn&#39;t have exactly 5 fingers. Her other body parts were finetuned and then it reaches her current concept. The complete version is her second form, and from there I made it simpler for her first form and add stuffs in for her last one. It was such a showy and luxurious design, so I had lots of fun drawing her.
