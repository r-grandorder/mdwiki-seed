Her nature is already close to that of the monster Gorgon, who had took in her beloved sisters and had pulverized the many heroes who had dared embarked upon the isle.<br> She comprehends human speech by means of an exceedingly high intelligence; she does not fall to madness, and it is not that her mind is being contaminated-----yet above it all, essentially a mutual understanding with her is difficult.</p><h2 id="attitude-towards-master" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#attitude-towards-master" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Attitude Towards Master</h2><p>A degree of awareness of being a vessel upon manifestation.

Indeed she was summoned as a Servant by means of Chaldea&#39;s system, but a meticulous caution is needed in handling her. If the Master lose their focus, they will lose their life.</p><p>In a way, one can say that she is a sample demonstrating the astounding, state of the art Chaldea summoning formula. Such a mechanism that summons not only possessions and divided spirits (bunrei) of the gods, but even also such a dangerous existence as a Servant; even in the world of magic, one simply cannot call it anything but a rare occurrence.</p><h2 id="standard-weapons" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#standard-weapons" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Standard Weapons</h2><p>Adjacent attacks by means of her hooked claws, a mid ranged attack by means of her hair feelers that had turned into snakes.
