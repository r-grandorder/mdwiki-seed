With long term maintenance and all the screw ups plaguing the game&#39;s early stage. This was all reflected in the biography and they acknowledged all of their blunders. (Page 199, 200)</p></li><li><p>As most of here also already know, Before there was FGO, there existed an idea proposed by Type Moon where they wanted to create an MMORPG game, dubbed the &quot;Fate online project&quot;. The plan fell apart and broke halfway but most of its settings scavenged, reimagined and used in what is presently Fate/Apocrypha. This however didn&#39;t wave away the bitterness Type-Moon had at the time. (Page 200, 201)</p></li><li><p>The proposal to build FGO was sent out by Iwakami Atsuhiro of Aniplex, and the announcement to reboot Fate online project was during July 27, 2014. This gave both Nasu and Takeuchi &quot;a chance of revenge&quot;. (Page 201)</p></li><li><p>However there was a problem: FGO was scheduled to be released as a smartphone game (a mobage), and this posed problems and challenges for Nasu: The difference of platforms, and more importantly, Nasu&#39;s lack of experience (he did not own smartphones prior to this project), displaying his inexperience in smartphone games. Nasu&#39;s reason behind this was due to the convenience of smartphones that will &quot;turn him useless as a result&quot;. In order to change his mindset, Takeuchi bought him a smartphone and setup a situation which, during another usual day where Nasu goes to work as usual, he would then notice a smartphone was placed on his desk, with a number of games installed for him. The games Nasu then used to refer for the project would be &quot;Chain Chronicles&quot; and &quot;Brave Frontier&quot;. Fiddling with those games made Nasu aware and he then discovered the potential of smartphone games. This realization too aligned with the vision Takeuchi wanted as well since Type-Moon wanted to catch up with the times * shifting visual novel games which is originally made for the niche market and place them into the mainstream market * a game where people can access anywhere, anytime. Additionally, the reason why Type-Moon chose to start by creating R18 game was because they felt it was &quot;the most interesting thing likely to happen at the most interesting place&quot;, by doing so it managed to became the forefront brand recognized by most otakus. Therefore to Takeuchi, who always wanted and had been looking for his so called &quot;interesting places&quot;: Allowing him to delve into the potential of smartphone games, which is a completely new horizon for him, was an experience worth exploring. (Page 202, 203)</p></li><li><p>After that experience, both of them, managed to link up with the Producer of FGO through another friend of theirs, which is Akihito Shouji of Delight Works to discuss what is needed to create a smartphone game. Akihito Shouji is known to have worked in Square-Enix for 15 years, and after his experience as the CEO for both Style Walker and Taito, he&#39;d then left and established his own company, Delight Works. (Page 203, 204)</p></li><li><p>However, the launch was met with a disastrous result, and greeted with many dissatisfaction from players and fans. To prvent the game from failing further, Akihito Shouji brought in Yousuke Shiokawa , to be the current Creative Director of FGO. Yousuke Shiokawa&#39;s portfolio is very rich: having worked as a planner in Square-Enix before, with notable achievements including being involved in the production for Kingdom Hearts series and Dissidia Final Fantasy.</p></li><li><p>Yousuke Shiokawa immediately found many problems and understood how inexperienced Type Moon were in this aspect. He then pointed out the problems, especially on the UI issues and the directionless problem, and fixed it. Yousuke Shiokawa also laid out the full plan on how to &quot;remove the weed plaguing the game&quot;, establish it&#39;s direction, and began patching the game gradually while still implementing new content. This greatly improved the game experience and gradually shaped the game into what it is today. Type-Moon is greatly appreciative of Yousuke&#39;s involvement. To them, he saved the game. (Page 204, 205, 206)</p></li><li><p>The main keyword and the concept for FGO is &quot;Humanity&quot; (\u4EBA\u7406, Jinri, lit. &quot;The Path of Humanity&quot;). The biography then laid out the entire synopsis of Fate/Grand Order Part I itself: From the part where the Ages of Gods ended and humanity, along with the civilization flourished after. (Page 210 to 211)</p></li><li><p>The main scenario was planned and composed by Nasu, but written by Higashide and Sakurai. Three of them were initially the scenario writers of the game but halfway brought in 2 more: Hoshizora Meteo (Fire Girl, Shigatsu no Majou no Heya), and Minase Hazuki (Fate/Kaleid Prisma Ilya script writer) (Page 212)</p></li><li><p>The main story, including interludes and side events have since surpassed 200 thousand Japanese characters in total. For a smartphone game, this is considered enormous in terms of text volume. This wasn&#39;t planned that way at first. The initial idea of any smartphone game was being a light hearted, casual free to play, accessible everywhere game, and FGO was initially heading that direction, <strong>and they didn&#39;t want to burden players with heavy story writing</strong>, therefore they initially just aim to have the player tap a few times, get into battle, and then get back to scenario. This clashed with the idea of trying to appeal the game through storytelling because of how smartphone games are supposed to be like, and the biography pointed out that this contributed to the pacing and rhythm problems of the story. While they couldn&#39;t fix the pacing problems up to London chapter, the writing and the storytelling pacing went a drastic corrections and rewrite before the game starts to enter Chapter 5 onwards, and the story became a lot more tighter. (Page 218, 219)</p></li><li><p>The change of this direction also affected Shiokawa&#39;s decision on whether the game should put its main focus on story or not. The Dango event was the first event that made Shiokawa ponder on the decision, because at the time the game doesn&#39;t have a firm, hard decision on how the game should head into yet, so while Shiokawa was pondering to reach an answer, he always requested Nasu to write a low volume text for event stories, but he always ended up writing 5x longer than what it was requested. This shocked Shiokawa but Takeuchi had to explain to him that &quot;This is how Type-Moon works&quot;. Due to this experience, Shiokawa decided to refocus on making the event and the game interesting through stories, pacing and text volume. (Page 219, 220, 221)</p></li><li><p>However this decision doesn&#39;t entirely bring positive results because there are also users who wished for light, less text and more reading friendly scenarios, and some events also invited complains from the players on how it became unfriendly for new users. For example: Fate/Extra CCC collaboration event that was held in May, 2017 required players to clear Part I in order to access the special event. This in turn invited some complains where they can&#39;t access the event while still going through Part I of the story. However, Shiokawa proceed and kept that direction because Shiokawa respected how how Type-Moon wanted to present their stories and the game, so a little setbacks are necessary and they are prepared to face criticisms on the matter. So even with the criticism, they chose to go with this direction because this is what they have always wanted, instead of giving in completely to users demand. (Page 221,222)</p></li><li><p>Even with the success of FGO as it is right now, their yearly and monthly sales, profit is actually not stable. It doesn&#39;t rise gradually and not every month was a profit to them. Even so, rather than making it complete business oriented, it is more about presenting what they want to present, and what they strive to. Breaking forward with their own determination yet giving users a necessary amount of care and consideration is what makes FGO successful today. (Page 222)</p></li><li><p>To Shiokawa, providing users the service that encapsulated the &quot;life with FGO&quot; concept is his biggest task and challenge to date. The following chapter itself also dedicated on the social aspects of the game and how it impacted the players. Touching on what Shiokawa thought of FGO as a smartphone game, to how it incorporated into the player&#39;s life, the difference between a normal consumer/console game and a smartphone game, touching on &quot;a dual game quality&quot; (\u4E8C\u91CD\u306E\u30B2\u30FC\u30E0\u6027, nijuu no geemusei) aspects as the biography labels it: as FGO is a visual novel with RPG elements as the game system, a dual game genre that mixed into one, how it affects the users response after being exposed to the game (Talking about it on Twitter, creating fanarts, etc), creating a platform of communication through the game, and the difference characterization of the game and fan works. All of these topic will turn out how the game itself influenced FGO, and the whole society&#39;s treatment of FGO&#39;s characters in turn created a strange &quot;twist&quot;: FGO servants are originally written in the stories as &quot;Heroic Spirits&quot;: Heroes that mainly became heroes through feats and legends left behind, and in the main story they were assigned in the roles they are supposed to play out, however, FGO being a smartphone game would mean players are exposed with the advancement of such technology and the accessibility in other social media platforms would mean we see a plenty amount of fanarts that depicted those heroes in a comedic, silly ways, a side that is more heartwarming and more humane than their supposed role in the story, turned out creating a &quot;dual characteristics&quot; of Type-Moon characters as a result. This also created a relationship between the players and the characters, treating as if they&#39;re a &quot;family member&quot; (Page 223 to 226)</p></li><li><p>The above point in turn affected how FGO is ran, in terms of how the game plans to churn out its content. For example: FGO implements game events in a much slower rate compared to other smartphone games. However, constantly running events does not however mean it will utilize the relationship between the players with their in game servants because <strong>events and main story are, first and foremost, a very unusual daily life happening.</strong> Therefore, in order to utilize what&#39;s been said above, and making use of the dynamic relationship between players and the characters, they needed to find something that fill in the blanks and create something to do, that doesn&#39;t give the feeling of unusual, yet a daily thing. They realize that the slow pace may cause the players who are always excited for content complain about having nothing to do (nothing that excites them). However, by constantly churning out content non stop would tire out and exhaust the relationship between the player and the character, weaken their bond with the characters as a result. <strong>In a way, they want to create a balance where you can enjoy the game though scenarios, or leisurely gather materials to raise your character skills, or talk about the game through social medias</strong>, in a sense it&#39;s like how you spend your days with your family members, eat with them, and even sometimes follow them during a trip and so on. (Page 226, 227, 228)</p></li><li><p>With those 2 points above, the biography then cited 2 important aspect that put emphasis on the relationship between players and the characters: On NP skip, and Bond system. On NP skip, they cited the reason why they won&#39;t implement NP Skip feature is Noble Phantasm is part of the symbol of what makes them a Servant, the Heroic Spirit&#39;s identity. Hence it forms an important part of what &quot;Fate&quot; really is. Implementing the skip would decrease the value of that symbol, thus decreasing the relationship value between the characters and their players; On Bond system, the biography touched on the reason why Type-Moon and Delight Works decided to scrap the idea of &quot;Bond Battle&quot; quests that allows you to obtain bond points in such a short time, citing how gaining bond points in a fast period does not make you closer to the character you&#39;re raising. (Page 228, 229, 230)</p></li><li><p>As of today, Type-Moon has <s>a total of</s> approximately 15 workers. It still operates as a team instead of a full fledged corporate right now.
