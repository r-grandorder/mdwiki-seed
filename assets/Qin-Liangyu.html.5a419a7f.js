If it is a dangerous place, she will emerge before her Master and protect them, if it is a safe place, she will be standing behind them, and if she is requested for her opinion from them, she will respond with a pertinent reply. Even if she is in love with her Master, she will not think of things such as \u201CI want to make him/her my own\u201D, instead being devotedly moderate in that it is fine for her if she just gives them a smile. It is common for her to recognize her Master as a target that she should protect and be a patron to.

In the \u201CHistory of Ming\u201D, a history among those histories where it has high fame, there is Qin Liangyu, who is remembered as the sole \u201Cfemale military commander\u201D within that series.</p><p>Originally a native of a minority group, Qin Liangyu became the wife of a man named Ma Qiancheng, who governed a region named Zhong Prefecture, and she served in the subjugation of a certain rebellion together with her husband. Afterwards, she became a general by succeeding her husband\u2019s position after he died in prison, who was imprisoned for a civil action-related matter, and she repelled the bandits many times, but at some point in time, four of the castles in the region she governed were stolen from her by the bandits.</p><p>Qin Liangyu, who was summoned to the capital, was prepared for death, but she was instead presented with a reward and four poems by the Emperor before being ordered to recapture the four castles she lost.</p><p>Qin Liangyu was inspired by the treatment given to her, and she worked well from then onwards. She remained the same even after the downfall of the Ming Dynasty, serving the Southern Ming Dynasty and its exiled government, and she continued to wage war until she died. It was told that she died a peaceful death due to infirmity at the age of 74.</p><h2 id="character-in-fgo" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#character-in-fgo" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Character in FGO</h2><p>To speak of Qin Liangyu in a few words, an older sister of firm character who can become reliable for others. She recognizes the Master as a younger brother/sister who must be protected. She will wake up in the morning earlier than anyone else and wait for the Master to wake up, manage their schedule, and go to bed in the night after she waits for the Master to fall asleep.</p><p>It is strange that even though Qin Liangyu is not particularly forced to do this, it seems she will settle down into such a role. An older sister who will be in high spirits and work for the sake of the Human Order. Furthermore, she likes pandas.</p><p>Qin Liangyu appeared as an enemy Servant in a Lostbelt[2].

Yeah. Tights were not mandatory. There was a plan and the like that emphasized a figure typical of a military woman with a tall stature, but eventually, I settled down in a recommended design that emphasized cuteness.
