If only these days went on forever...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Hmm.<br> I guess this is what you&#39;d call \u201CMurphy&#39;s law.\u201D</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Another failure!<br> Hmph, something&#39;s missing!</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Electric power, or raw materials. Or maybe something else. ROAR, I wonder.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> W-What&#39;s wrong, Edison!?</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Good morning, Mash, Master!<br> Oh, just trying to slightly improve my Noble Phantasm.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> While tinkering here and there,<br> it suddenly exploded with a \u201Cboom!\u201D</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Hahahahaha! Failures are not good, but I expect nothing less from my Noble Phantasm. Even when it activates accidentally it packs a punch!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Your constant thirst for knowledge is impressive, Mr. President.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> But, there are other Servants here as well.<br> Please avoid creating a scene, especially in the hallway.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> But my room is so cramped.<br> Experiments require space, you see.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Even Tesla respects the rules here, you know?</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> ROAR, don&#39;t compare me with that dimwit!<br> Sorry, miss. Next time I&#39;ll start with the \u201Cmute\u201D function.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> But it doesn&#39;t hurt to try, right? With upcoming battles in mind, strengthening a Noble Phantasm is essential.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> But seeing how I&#39;m failing to make progress,<br> I may need to change my way of thinking...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Change one&#39;s way of thinking...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> If I recall correctly, turning inventions or unimaginable discoveries into something more polished...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That was the greatest triumph for Thomas Edison...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Why don&#39;t you try improving your Noble Phantasm with the same mindset?</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Hmm, I suppose you&#39;re right.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> However, I find myself at a loss when thinking only about my own Noble Phantasm.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Perhaps if I use the Noble Phantasms of other Servants as reference...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> O-Other Servants... You say?</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Very well then!</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Let&#39;s start making contact with other Servants in Chaldea right away!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> But are you sure that&#39;s okay? A Noble Phantasm is the embodiment of a Servant&#39;s pride...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> To be so openly investigative about their abilities is somewhat...</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Who cares if it&#39;s okay or not!<br> For the time being, we need to try!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Right, for the time being!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Right, we need to try!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Senpai, it all comes down to the same thing!</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> So, that being said, here&#39;s what I came up with!</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> ...Hey, Master!<br> So why&#39;d you call me here?</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> I have a bad feeling about this,<br> and I&#39;m also not a huge fan of that witch over there.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Don&#39;t worry, C\xFA Chulainn.<br> This will be for your own good as well.</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong><br> ...Umm, maybe I don&#39;t look like it, but I&#39;m kind of busy.</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong><br> As a Caster I give lectures to other mages and make adjustments to the backyard...</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong><br> I also have to make sure that my former self doesn&#39;t say anything outrageous.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Of course, my fair lady.<br> What I have to say shall also be of use to you as well.</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong><br> ...I see. I guess I&#39;ll at least hear what you have to say.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> A \u201Clady.\u201D (Scoff)</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong><br> I don&#39;t know what you&#39;re scoffing at, but for now I&#39;ll kill you! Rule Breaker!</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> You still have a short temper, don&#39;t you!? Also you unleash your Noble Phantasm way too fast\u2013!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> P-Please calm down, Medea!</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> That&#39;s it!<br> I&#39;ve got it!</p><p><strong>G\uFF1AEveryone:</strong><br> Huh?</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> I&#39;ve been thinking about it for some time.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> C\xFA Chulainn&#39;s G\xE1e Bolg can overturn fate,<br> piercing its target no matter what course it takes.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> On the other hand, Lady Medea&#39;s Rule Breaker not only destroys all magical support...</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> ...it&#39;s also an Anti-Magecraft Noble Phantasm even capable of severing a Servant&#39;s contract!</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> So that&#39;s when I came up with my idea!</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> ...What exactly can a lion come up with?</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> This powerful body is not that of a lion, but the manifestation of a beast of wild intellect!</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong><br> So you do agree that you&#39;re a beast.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Of course, I wake up an hour early every morning to brush my fur and... Wait, I&#39;m getting sidetracked.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Just listen to me! I&#39;m going to weld together C\xFA Chulainn&#39;s G\xE1e Bolg and Medea&#39;s Rule Breaker!</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> No matter who the Servant may be, this revolutionary Noble Phantasm will overturn one&#39;s fate and sever any contract!</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> I shall name it \u201CEdison-type Bolg Breaker!\u201D</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou, foou.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Hey, Master!<br> Can I go back now?</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong><br> ...Please tell me more.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Witch!?<br> I mean, uh, Medea?</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong><br> Actually, the thought has occurred to me before.</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong><br> Approaching enemies for each Rule Breaker isn&#39;t really a Caster&#39;s job, right?</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong><br> It&#39;s tiresome, dangerous, you get splashed with blood, and you almost trip stepping on the hem of your robe.</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong><br> So, if you could quickly activate a Noble Phantasm with that lance of yours, that&#39;d be perfect.</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong><br> I mean, I didn&#39;t obtain my Noble Phantasm from my adventures. It&#39;s a materialization of my legend of treachery.</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong><br> So, I&#39;m not too attached to it.<br> I almost wouldn&#39;t mind forcing it on someone else.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> As always, Caster, your logical thinking is so elegant.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> You muscleheads, no, mageheads!<br> Just because it&#39;s convenient doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s good!</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> I love my Scarlet Lance!<br> It&#39;s totally a part of my identity!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Y-Yes, I see.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> C\xFA Chulainn acquired the legendary G\xE1e Bolg only after harsh training and discipline.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It would be wrong to carelessly tinker with it\u2013</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong><br> Who cares if we lose a spear or two?<br> Should I call Sc\xE1thach to give us spares?</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong><br> Or maybe I should say.</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong><br> \u201CYour pupil is such a stingy warrior that he won&#39;t even let go of a single spear.\u201D</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Damn you. You hit a sore spot...<br> This is exactly why I can&#39;t stand witches... Fine, here.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Thanks for your assistance!<br> Noble Phantasm modification... Here I go!</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> All right, it&#39;s done!<br> The \u201CEdison-type Bolg Breaker!\u201D</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Fuhahaha!<br> Behold its elegant design!</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Oh, a patent! I must get a patent!<br> No matter what, patents come first!</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Oh, my G\xE1e Bolg... My perfectly efficient crimson spear... It looks so fancy!</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Now now, C\xFA Chulainn.<br> We must experiment first.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Fortunately, there&#39;s a Servant who would gladly volunteer for this experiment.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Well, isn&#39;t that convenient!? How nice that such a weird Servant just popped up like that!</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> Hmph. To think you&#39;d modify your Noble Phantasm.<br> And here I was thinking you were a savage.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> I know Edison&#39;s a modern man, but for someone born in the Age of the Gods, that&#39;s quite a flexible way of thinking.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> SO HE&#39;S TALKING ABOUT YOU!?</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong><br> Of course. Not only is this playboy of a mage calling himself Archer, he&#39;s also a repeat offender of Noble Phantasm theft and illegal modification!</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> That&#39;s not very nice, Caster. But you know there&#39;s a saying...</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> My Noble Phantasm is my Noble Phantasm. Your Noble Phantasm is still mine after I copy it.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> E-Even this Noble Phantasm that I&#39;m holding on to!?</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> There isn&#39;t a saying like that! You know other Servants will kill you if they hear you say that, right!?</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> Of course, I choose my opponents. To the ones that are like \u201CI really don&#39;t like mine copied,\u201D I will do it in secrecy.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> But the ones that are like \u201CWhy don&#39;t you try it punk,\u201D I will project their Noble Phantasms right in their faces.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> Difficulty level is a factor as well.<br> I can&#39;t easily project a Noble Phantasm like G\xE1e Bolg.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> Similarly, Mash&#39;s Noble Phantasm is also something I can&#39;t easily imitate.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> T-Thank you very much.<br> I&#39;m glad, Master!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Mash, you are my one and only!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Y-Yes! Master, I&#39;ll devote myself to my training!</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong><br> Youth, huh...<br> How touching...</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> Well, let&#39;s try projecting one.<br> Are you ready, Edison!?</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Yes!<br> C\xFA Chulainn!</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Give it a shot!<br> I&#39;m here to back you up!</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Assuming there would be actual combat,<br> I prepared a random enemy for you!</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Ugh, enough already!<br> This one strike, accept it as your farewell gift!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Commencing battle!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Medea:</strong><br> Time to finish this.<br> Archer has started chanting.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Okay, perfect timing!<br> C\xFA Chulainn, now!</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> I got this! Once the fight starts, I won&#39;t hold back!</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> \u201CBolg Breaker,\u201D here we go!</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> It&#39;s \u201CEdison-type Bolg Breaker!\u201D<br> Don&#39;t forget!</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Yeah, yeah. \u201CEdison-type Bolg Breaker!\u201D</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> It&#39;s been a while, but here I go!<br> Rho Aias!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Whaaat!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Emiya-senpai, you possess a shield-type Noble Phantasm!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I-I&#39;ll make sure I take notes!</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Let&#39;s see which one will come out on top!</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Of course, I&#39;m confident that my \u201CEdison-type Bolg Breaker\u201D will win!</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> A blade that could cut through all forms of Magecraft would surely pierce that shield-type Noble Phantasm!</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong><br> Huh? That&#39;s impossible you know?</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong><br> I mean, my Noble Phantasm works against Servants,<br> but not against other Noble Phantasms.</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong><br> It would be especially tough when the target&#39;s a shield created precisely to ward off attacks.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> What!? Was I mistaken on such a fundamental concept!?</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Which means, in this case\u2013</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> It broke!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The welded Rule Breaker bounced off!</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Ah.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Ah\u2014!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The Rule Breaker rebounded on...<br> on C\xFA Chulainn&#39;s head!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I-I&#39;ve seen this somewhere before!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Altrium!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> AHOGE!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That&#39;s it!</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Ugh, I didn&#39;t weld it on hard enough!</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> I thought that Rule Breaker could easily pierce Emiya&#39;s shield!</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> But I guess if you charge it head-on...the great Rho Aias still comes out on top!</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> The experiment...has failed!</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Who cares! Could you take this off already!?</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong><br> Yeah, sure.<br> Here you go.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Ugh... Now I have a headache. I can&#39;t even bust through a shield...</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> I&#39;ve thought I would resent someone&#39;s low ranking Luck as much as this...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Umm, I don&#39;t think Luck has anything to do with it this time. It&#39;s simple a reckless experiment.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Perhaps it was a bit reckless trying to modify someone&#39;s Noble Phantasm...</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Even though Fujimaru summoned me,<br> at this rate I&#39;ll remain useless...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Edison...</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> Mr. Edison, don&#39;t you think you&#39;re giving up a little too fast?</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> The idea itself isn&#39;t a bad one. Rule Breaker is a broken item that could sever any contract.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> If you could land a direct hit, any Servant would be liberated from the bonds of its contract.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> ...So. For example, why not try matching it with Hrunting?</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> That Noble Phantasm pursues the enemy it sniffs out. A different type of Noble Phantasm from reversing cause and effect.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Oh, Emiya, you understand me!</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> Of course. You see,<br> weapon modification and improvement are my forte.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> For some reason, Emiya-senpai sounds different than usual!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Extremely suspicious!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Don&#39;t you think he sounds more natural now?</p><hr><p><strong>Medea:</strong><br> Of course, that boy... I mean, snob, used to be a well-mannered person to start with.</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong><br> But a lot happened and now he&#39;s a bit twisted.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> Don&#39;t badmouth people to their face!</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Oh... It&#39;s just as Emiya says!<br> I can&#39;t give up after only one failure!</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Once we&#39;re back in Chaldea, let&#39;s revisit what we just talked about and discuss our next plan!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Master, I have a feeling we shouldn&#39;t bring the two of them together.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Let&#39;s head back, eat, and hit the sack!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Senpai is trying to escape reality, too!<br> Please get your act together!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Let&#39;s pretend we didn&#39;t see any of this!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> You can&#39;t run away, Master!<br> We&#39;re responsible for this disaster!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Anyway, Master, prepare yourself.<br> I&#39;m pretty sure Edison will, most definitely...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Come up with another crazy plan!</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> All right, then how about this!? Adding transformations and combining mechanisms would surely make it exciting!</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> You are a genius! But wouldn&#39;t forcing the joints like that make the connecting parts more fragile?</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Silly, that&#39;s our chance to make it look even cooler!<br> Add in bolts and armor plates to give it more volume...</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> ...and it will be twice as large after combining!<br> I have a feeling this thing will sell as a toy!</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> Always looking at the positive side of things!<br> I&#39;d expect no less from the King of Inventions!</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> Yes, this is wonderful!<br> Well then, how about doing this?</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong><br> ...Oh, shut up.</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong><br> This is why I can&#39;t stand men who pursue their dreams and adventures. They&#39;re all good-for-nothings.</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong><br> A grown-up who&#39;s a bit mellow, and calm in his judgment. That&#39;s my ideal man.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Who cares?<br> Anyway, could someone hurry up and heal me?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Sorry, I forgot!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Oh... Senpai!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Speaking of forgetting things, what happened to strengthening Edison&#39;s Noble Phantasm!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I forgot!</p><hr><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou foou.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I think that Fou said, \u201CIt&#39;s hopeless!\u201D<br> He&#39;s given up too!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> On to the next one!</p><hr>', 218);
