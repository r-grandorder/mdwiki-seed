Just a moment, Lord Tajima!</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:</strong><br> Is there a problem?</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> Well, um...</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> I just wanted to make sure...</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> You say this killer appearing in the simulator is not what they call an \u201CNPC\u201D?</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> Do I have that right?</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:</strong><br> That is correct.</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:</strong><br> This person possessed the aura of a true<br> swordsman...to an extraordinary degree...</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:</strong><br> It was just yesterday that I encountered them.</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:</strong><br> I was taking a walk in the simulator when...</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:</strong><br> ...Who goes there?</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:</strong><br> Show yourself.<br> I can tell you are no mere enn-pee-see.</p><p><strong>Mysterious Swordsman:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:</strong><br> So, you are bereft of speech.<br> Or perhaps, you were born without a mouth.</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:</strong><br> I am trained in Otomeryu. Ordinarily, it is not meant to be seen by the eyes of commoners...</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:</strong><br> ...but now that the Tokugawa shogunate no longer holds sway, and I am a mere shadow of the true Tajima...</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:</strong><br> ...I see little point in letting<br> such concerns stay my blade.</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:</strong><br> So be warned.<br> Draw nearer, and I will cut you down.</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:</strong><br> ...!</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:</strong><br> Impressive.</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:</strong><br> I must say...</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:</strong><br> ...your swordsmanship is a sight to behold.<br> No human could make use of such a technique.</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:</strong><br> You must be some manner of monster.</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:</strong><br> Or perhaps...a curse that has gained consciousness.</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:</strong><br> ...Regrettably, I was unable to<br> settle our duel before they left.</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:</strong><br> It appeared they were dissatisfied with my swordsmanship.</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:</strong><br> Yes... I had the distinct impression<br> that one blade is not enough for them.</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:</strong><br> It was as though they were searching for an opponent who wields two blades instead.</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:</strong><br> I imagine they were taking the form of a dead man&#39;s essence, much like we Heroic Spirits.</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:</strong><br> But now, they must have lost sight of who they are, and so have turned on those of us who carry blades of our own. What a pity.</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:</strong><br> ...And so they have devolved into some<br> mindless killer wandering the simulator.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> ...So it is basically rogue data that is<br> similar to a Heroic Spirit. Understood!</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> I&#39;ll go tell Master right now!<br> And I&#39;ll let Da Vinci and Mash know, too!</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> ...And that&#39;s everything Lord Tajima told me!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I see. Thanks, Kiyohime.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> You&#39;re welcome, Master!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> He could&#39;ve just told me himself...</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> He said it&#39;s because he doesn&#39;t<br> know much about the simulator...</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> So...does this mean there&#39;s a bug in the simulator...?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Our scans haven&#39;t picked up anything, but the main point of the simulator is to project Heroic Spirits&#39; Spirit Origins.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> With all that intricate data in the registry, it&#39;s entirely possible that a bit could have gotten scrambled somewhere and caused a problem.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Besides, Yagyu Tajima-no-kami&#39;s one of the best swordsmen who ever lived, right?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> If he felt like this thing wasn&#39;t just a normal NPC, I&#39;m inclined to take him at his word. Something must be wrong.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Hmm. Welp! Guess we&#39;ll just have to run some comprehensive emergency system diagnostics!</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> ...Master.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> Oh, hello, Lord Diarmuid.<br> What brings you here?</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> If I may, I would ask that you<br> please take me to the simulator.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> I think I might have an idea<br> as to who this miscreant may be.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Okay, Senpai, Diarmuid.<br> The simulator is up and running with no trouble so far.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I&#39;ll be monitoring the entire system from here in real time, but please let me know if you see anything amiss.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> There aren&#39;t currently any NPCs in that area, so there shouldn&#39;t be anything unusual happening.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Got it.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Thanks, Mash.</p><hr><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> If my instincts are correct...</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> ...we should encounter our target soon,<br> even if this place is meant to be deserted.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Are you sure, Diarmuid? I&#39;ve confirmed that your area is cut off from all external access...</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> Yes, I&#39;m sure.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> Whoever this is, they won&#39;t pass up their chance to find what they&#39;re searching for.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...Can you tell me?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> What are they searching for?</p><hr><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> ...Me.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> What do you mean?</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> You were wondering why Lord Tajima didn&#39;t tell you about this yourself, right, Master?</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> I can answer that.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> It&#39;s because our miscreant must be some kind of curse. Or rather, feelings that have degenerated into one.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> I just never thought it would look for me in the simulator, tracking me through the bonds we share.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> ...Lady Kiyohime.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> Yes! I&#39;m here!</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> There is the faintest trace of this curse still lingering on your shoulder.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> It is from when you spoke to Lord Tajima,<br> after he encountered it here.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> That is almost certainly why he tried to distance himself from Master. To keep the curse away from [\u2642 him /\u2640\uFE0F her].</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Really!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> But, our sensors didn&#39;t pick up anything when she entered the Command Room!</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> Now that you mention it...I do think my shoulders feel a little heavy...</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> I&#39;d better burn that curse<br> away later, just to be safe.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> Impressive.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> Lord Tajima must have come to you because he knew you would have been able to handle it without difficulty.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> That...makes a lot of sense.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> ?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Kiyohime and curses do kind of, uh, go together...</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> Master?</p><hr><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> That curse...</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> No... Those feelings are directed at me.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> I can still detect the scent of Danaan on them.<br> I have no doubt that it is searching for me.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> I considered trying to quietly handle this myself,<br> so as not to trouble the rest of you...</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> ...but that is not a decision I can make on my own.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> I am sworn to serve you now, Master, and cannot take up my spear without your permission. That is why...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> That&#39;s why you came and told me.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Thanks, Diarmuid.</p><hr><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> You are too kind, Master.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> Please be careful. This scent...<br> The curse is drawing near!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I can&#39;t see anything on our monitors...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> No, wait! I&#39;m picking up a hostile headed your way!</p><p><strong>Mysterious Swordsman:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> Oh my, he just radiates animosity!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> There is no way this is NPC data!<br> These numbers shouldn&#39;t even be possible! Senpai!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I&#39;m going to give it a shot.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I&#39;ll do my best to be careful!</p><hr><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> Worry not, Master! Virtual space or not,<br> I will make sure no harm comes to you!</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> I, Diarmuid Ua Duibhne, shall be your opponent!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> Damn! I can&#39;t finish him off with this Spirit Origin!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Senpai! Diarmuid!</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> Master!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The hostile shows no signs of disappearing! It&#39;s going to be fiendishly difficult to defeat them in battle!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I think you should\u2013</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Hold on.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> They&#39;re trying to say something...</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> !?</p><p><strong>Mysterious Swordsman:</strong><br> ...You are not the one.</p><p><strong>Mysterious Swordsman:</strong><br> You are not the one.</p><p><strong>Mysterious Swordsman:</strong><br> Your spear is not enough.</p><p><strong>Mysterious Swordsman:</strong><br> Show me your true power. Show me the power<br> of a knight raised by the sea-god Manann\xE1n.</p><p><strong>Mysterious Swordsman:</strong><br> Show me the sword of Manann\xE1n!</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> Master, stand back!</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> Hraaaaaahhh...!</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> G\xE1e Buidhe!</p><p><strong>Mysterious Swordsman:</strong><br> ...You are not the one.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> (My demonic spear didn&#39;t work?)</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> (No, that&#39;s not it...!)</p><p><strong>D\uFF1AVoice:</strong><br> ...That&#39;s right.<br> He wishes to duel with swords alone.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1AVoice:</strong><br> No other weapon will lay him to rest.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> !!!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I&#39;m picking up a powerful magical energy reading!<br> It doesn&#39;t appear to be hostile, but...</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> Are they here to fight too?<br> No, wait. This feeling...</p><p><strong>Voice From The Shadows:</strong><br> ...I&#39;m sorry for the trouble. He is indeed looking for you, but he is also looking for me.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> You&#39;re...</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> Now I see...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Diarmuid!?</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> You&#39;re lowering your spear...?<br> Isn&#39;t that dangerous to do in the face of an enemy?</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> It&#39;s fine. This shadow is different.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> If anything...I would say he&#39;s here to back us up.</p><p><strong>Voice From The Shadows:</strong><br> Indeed I am.</p><p><strong>Voice From The Shadows:</strong><br> However, I currently lack a corporeal Spirit Origin, and thus would like to make use of yours.</p><p><strong>Voice From The Shadows:</strong><br> If that is acceptable to you, Master.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> ...Master, I would ask you to grant his request.<br> We must do this if we are to defeat this opponent.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I trust you, Diarmuid.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> (Nod)</p><hr><p><strong>Voice From The Shadows:</strong><br> Understood!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> They&#39;re resonating with each other...!?<br> It looks like Diarmuid&#39;s Spirit Origin is changing!</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> ...Servant, Saber. My True Name is Diarmuid Ua Duibhne, of the Knights of Fianna...</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> ...and my two demonic blades are at your service!</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> Now! Curse who has taken form in our simulator!</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> No... You are a pure, honest giant\u2013a Giolla Deacair! But I also know you as the Fairy King \xC1bartach of the Danann!</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> Why have you come to Chaldea!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Fairy King \xC1bartach of the Danann!?</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> Wh-who&#39;s that!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> He&#39;s a king who ruled over one<br> of the fairy kingdoms in Erin!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> In the Fenian Cycle of Celtic legend, he was said to have formed an alliance with the Knights of Fianna...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...and in the process of forming that alliance,<br> Diarmuid ended up fighting one of his knights...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Although some accounts of that legend say that Diarmuid actually fought the Fairy King himself!</p><p><strong>Mysterious Swordsman:</strong><br> Yes... Yesss...</p><p><strong>Mysterious Swordsman:</strong><br> That is the knight of Fianna I have been searching for.<br> At last, you have shown yourself before me.</p><p><strong>Mysterious Swordsman:</strong><br> I saw your swordsmanship in my dreams. I saw your swords shining brightly atop the earth once again.</p><p><strong>Mysterious Swordsman:</strong><br> Thus did my consciousness cross time and space to arrive in this digital domain...</p><p><strong>Mysterious Swordsman:</strong><br> ...At last, I have found you again, Diarmuid!</p><p><strong>Mysterious Swordsman:</strong><br> Not the invincible knight Fionn,<br> with his demonic sword M\xF3ralltach and demonic spear G\xE1e Dearg!</p><p><strong>Mysterious Swordsman:</strong><br> Nor the figure of the Lancer with two demonic spears! No, at last, you have become a Saber wielding two demonic swords!</p><p><strong>Mysterious Swordsman:</strong><br> A far cry indeed from the Diarmuid I saw at the spring on that fateful day...</p><p><strong>Mysterious Swordsman:</strong><br> ...who was the only one able to leap<br> beyond that precipitous cliff!</p><p><strong>Mysterious Swordsman:</strong><br> Ahh, I want nothing more than to defeat<br> you and your two swords, Diarmuid!</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> ...What a self-centered king you are.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> Nonetheless, I understand how you feel,<br> and I accept your challenge!</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> I am Diarmuid Ua Duibhne, First Spear of the Knights of Fianna! But now I stand before you armed with two swords, not spears!</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> Now, you shall know defeat!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Fascinating.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> So two different versions of the same Heroic Spirit now coexist in one Spirit Origin? Hmm...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> I suppose it is not totally dissimilar from Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde&#39;s case, though for you it seems to be a more temporary phenomenon.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Especially given how the Saber version seems to have made his way here via the connection he made to Ms. Miyamoto in a parallel world.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> That particular Spirit Origin has, of course,<br> been registered in our database by now...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> ...but I&#39;m afraid that your current self can only maintain its manifestation for so long.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Therefore\u2013</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> You might as well enjoy yourself while you&#39;re here. This should be fun!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> So, I&#39;ll put a little more in the way of resources into the simulator while you&#39;re here.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> After all, we&#39;re Chaldea, the Security Organization for the Preservation of Humanity. You won&#39;t find this many Servants anywhere else! Ever!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> There ought to be plenty of badass heroes here for you to cross swords with!</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> I, um... Are you sure about this?<br> I never belonged to this world, after all.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> Are you certain it will not be a problem<br> to keep me here, even temporarily?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> It&#39;s fine! Don&#39;t worry about it!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> What&#39;s Lancer Diarmuid think?</p><hr><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> ...Oh. Well...</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> Go on. What&#39;s he saying?</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> ...The Lancer within me says we<br> should accept Master&#39;s generosity.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> Then listen to him!<br> Please, enjoy yourself.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> You are all very kind. Very well then, I shall<br> do my utmost to enjoy what time I have here!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Great! Then let&#39;s get started!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Four consecutive battles coming right up!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Go!</p><hr><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> ...I almost feel as though I am dreaming.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> Yet I doubt even the gods or the Fairy King could ever have conceived of something so wondrous as this.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> Truly, I could ask for no better parting gift.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> You have my deepest thanks, Master of Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Senpai... Diarmuid&#39;s Spirit Origin is forcefully reverting to its Lancer form!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...Did you enjoy yourself?</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> Of course, Master.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I wish you could&#39;ve stayed longer.</p><hr><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> It would seem this is it.<br> It won&#39;t be much longer now until I disappear.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> But please, do not worry about me.<br> My Lancer Spirit Origin is perfectly capable.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> I am still me, whether I carry sword or spear,<br> and I will continue to wield them for your sake.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> Now then, I\u2013</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> ...!</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> That golden sword!<br> Are you...the King of Knights?</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> Forgive me. It would seem you no longer have time to spare for a duel.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> Perhaps we can remedy that some other day,<br> Sir Diarmuid.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> As I see it, it may be best simply to summon your new Spirit Origin here...</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> ...but it is only through fate that we may have another chance to duel.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> And so, while I cannot give you my word,<br> I can at least say this much:</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> I hope we will meet again some day,<br> Diarmuid Ua Duibhne of the Knights of Fianna.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> ...Yes. I&#39;d like that very much.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> Should that day ever come, King of Knights...we will have a battle for the ages!</p>', 257);
