Without her glasses, both her eye color and hair color become brighter.</p><h3 id="explanation" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#explanation" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Explanation</h3><hr><p>The protagonist. At first glance is quiet and melancholic. On the inside is tsun-tsun and aggressive. Because of her appearance, her past, and the fact that she has little skill as a magus, or perhaps because she has a complex about being a magus, she always acts frightened around other people.</p><p>Haughty at home but meek outside. At home she acts self-assured. (When like this she is similar to Rin from Fate/stay night, but she isn\u2019t brimming with confidence like Rin. Rather, she acts more like a child.)</p><p>Because her older sister who departed the world 8 years ago was a genius, she has a complex about her ordinariness. Although her father, who also died 8 years ago, told her \u201CThere will be a day when you, too, participate in the Holy Grail War\u201D, she was absolutely unwilling, and ran. When she was about to be killed by Lancer, she summoned Saber. Because he saved her, she had no choice but to participate in the Holy Grail War.</p><p>During the War, her personality changed a little bit. (That is, she broke free from her trauma.)</p><h2 id="saber" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#saber" aria-hidden="true">#</a> SABER</h2><hr><hr><h3 id="status-1" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#status-1" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Status</h3><hr><table><thead><tr><th>Servant Saber</th><th>Status</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Adresses self as</td><td>\u201CBoku\u201D (towards Ayaka) \u201CWatashi\u201D (towards enemies)</td></tr><tr><td>Servant rank</td><td>Rank 1</td></tr><tr><td>Strength</td><td>B</td></tr><tr><td>Endurance</td><td>A</td></tr><tr><td>Agility</td><td>B</td></tr><tr><td>Magic</td><td>E</td></tr><tr><td>Luck</td><td>C</td></tr><tr><td>Noble Phantasm</td><td>C (EX)</td></tr></tbody></table><h3 id="comment-from-takeuchi-takashi-1" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#comment-from-takeuchi-takashi-1" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Comment from Takeuchi Takashi</h3><hr><p>Handsome and calm, the 90s ideal image of a legendary hero.

Likes good things, and investigates bad things, a pleasant hero. Although, sometimes he says some nihilistic things (Similar to Archer from Fate/Stay Night). With regards to Ayaka, he is an ideal prince and guardian.</p><p>He originally answered the Holy Grail\u2019s call with the intention of rewriting history. In the Grail War eight years ago he won all his battles until the very end, but when he was only a step away from the Grail, he was forced to abandon the summons, and withdraw. As though there were aftereffects of an illness, his memories of the previous Grail War are fuzzy\u2026 is what he says.</p><p>His true name is King Arthur. It goes without saying that his Noble Phantasm is Excalibur, but because it is too well known he uses Invisible Air (a C ranked Noble Phantasm) to conceal it. By experiencing the previous Grail War, he freed himself from his previous dream of \u201Csaving his country\u201D. Instead, this time he answered the Holy Grail\u2019s call with the wish to save the girl who, eight years ago, indirectly showed him that the wishes placed on the Holy Grail would become distorted (Ayaka).</p><h2 id="archer" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#archer" aria-hidden="true">#</a> ARCHER</h2><hr><hr><h3 id="status-2" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#status-2" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Status</h3><hr><table><thead><tr><th>Servant Archer</th><th>Status</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Adresses self as</td><td>\u6211 (read as \u201COre\u201D)</td></tr><tr><td>Servant rank</td><td>Rank 3</td></tr><tr><td>Strength</td><td>C</td></tr><tr><td>Endurance</td><td>C</td></tr><tr><td>Agility</td><td>B</td></tr><tr><td>Magic</td><td>A</td></tr><tr><td>Luck</td><td>B</td></tr><tr><td>Noble Phantasm</td><td>EX</td></tr></tbody></table><h3 id="comment-from-takeuchi-takashi-2" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#comment-from-takeuchi-takashi-2" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Comment from Takeuchi Takashi</h3><hr><p>The basic design is the same as the Archer from Fate/Stay Night.

However, he doesn\u2019t have the same kingly temperament as the Gil from Fate/Stay Night, and is a man who is unable to read the situation. Because of his Master\u2019s influence, he became a Servant accustomed to the modern society. (* His Master is the owner and president of a building tall enough to overlook the entire city) Instead of the Holy Grail, he is more interested in establishing himself as the strongest of Heroic Spirits. Though his personality is callous, he is not an evil person. Thus, he sees the Servant who ranks above him, Saber, as a formidable opponent, and falls in love with the glasses-less Ayaka. What do you mean, shoujo manga? Just like in Fate/Stay Night, he is the king of Uruk, the hero from humanity\u2019s most ancient epic, Gilgamesh. His Noble Phantasms are Bab=Ilu (The tattoo that identifies him as king, which is the key to opening his treasury (that is, Fate/Stay Night\u2019s Gate of Babylon) as well as the sword Enki. Enki is a sword that can summon floods, and after it is deployed the volume of water increases daily. After seven days, it becomes a giant tsunami.

Extremely proud, showy and cruel. A sadist. Ayaka\u2019s rival and an ojou character, but isn\u2019t of the \u201Cohohoho\u201D type. The magus family she was born into is several levels higher than the Sajou family. The two fathers were old acquaintances, but Misaya did not meet Ayaka until after she became a Master. By the way, among the Holy Grail War\u2019s Master ranks, \u201CPrinces\u201D and \u201CThrones\u201D have the same position.</p><p>Because of her father\u2019s persistence in wanting to realize the Holy Grail, a curse of \u201CIf you become a Master and do not obtain the Holy Grail, you will die\u201D was put on her. That is, after becoming a Master, if she did not achieve victory, she would die. In reality, the one who cursed her was not her father but ????. Although Misaya\u2019s father struggled to dispel his daughter\u2019s curse, he was murdered by ????. In the middle of the story, the curse spreads to her entire body, and she dies.

However, despite not being too much younger than Lancer from FSN, he isn\u2019t as mature as he is in FSN. (He is around twenty. He is not mature enough to admit the world\u2019s injustices, and the values of good and evil. In this sense he is similar to Emiya Shirou.)</p><p>As he is also a beastmaster, he has excellent compatibility with the familiars that Misaya creates.

His true name is that of a hero from Greek mythology, Perseus. Among the Servants, only he obtained an ending that wasn\u2019t a \u201Cbad end\u201D. Although he possesses numerous Noble Phantasms, he is restricted to only being able to use one at a time. The flying winged sandals, the mantle which changes its wearer\u2019s appearance (in the myth it is a helmet), the mirror shield bestowed by Athena (radar, sonar), the serpent-hunting sickle Harpe (kills immortals), the bag that held the demon\u2019s severed head, Kibisis (Mirrored bounded field), and finally the same pegasus\u2019 bridle as in Fate/Stay Night (Bellerophon).</p><h2 id="sancraid-phahn" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#sancraid-phahn" aria-hidden="true">#</a> SANCRAID PHAHN</h2><hr><hr><h3 id="status-6" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#status-6" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Status</h3><hr><table><thead><tr><th>Sancraid Phahn</th><th>Status</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Adresses self as</td><td>\u201CWatashi\u201D</td></tr><tr><td>Master Rank</td><td>Unknown</td></tr><tr><td>Magecraft</td><td>Holy Church \u2014 8th Sacrament</td></tr><tr><td>Magic Circuit/Quality</td><td>C</td></tr><tr><td>Magic Circuit/Quantity</td><td>A</td></tr><tr><td>Magic Circuit Composition</td><td>Normal (with a little variation)</td></tr></tbody></table><h3 id="comment-from-takeuchi-takashi-6" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#comment-from-takeuchi-takashi-6" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Comment from Takeuchi Takashi</h3><hr><p>His concept design was supposed to involve a nondescript face\u2026 yet somehow he became this sort of character.

Because he had killed so many people, even the Catholic Cardinal could not give him asylum, so he was publicly executed\u2026 in reality, he bought himself American citizenship and lives as a Christian priest.</p><p>Because he can utilize multiple mobile magic circles simultaneously, he boasts of this supreme defensive power. The rank of Servant Berserker is Rank 2. Originally, Sancraid thought that \u201CAfter all, it is only the Holy Grail phenomenon that arose on this Far East island nation\u201D and looked upon the Holy Grail War with contempt, but quickly discovered the truth and changed his views.
