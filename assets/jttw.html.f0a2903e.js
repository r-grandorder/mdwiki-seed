It&#39;s an ancient manuscript, like an old book.<br> We call it a scroll.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Oh, how I love the smell of old books.<br> They really have luster. (Sniff Sniff)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Ah... So that&#39;s your fetish, is it...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Excuse me. My questions were an invasion of privacy. From now on, I promise to ignore what I see.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> No, I&#39;m not some kind of bibliomaniac, okay!?<br> I was asked to bring it from the warehouse, so I did.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> This was an item brought into Chaldea and kept there because it was thought to be a precious artifact affiliated with a certain person.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That means it is a catalyst for summoning. You said you were asked. So, was it for some kind of experiment?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> No, this was an unreasonable favor from a certain painter at the workshop\u2014 Oh hi, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Good morning, Senpai.<br> ...You&#39;re dressed a bit flashy, aren&#39;t you?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> The party is here, right?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Party? ...Here?<br> I don&#39;t think any have been planned...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> You were probably given the wrong information.<br> ...Let&#39;s interrogate Caesar later.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> In that case, what kind of smell do you like, Mash?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Which part of the conversation did you hear!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Let me see... Although I am still young and inexperienced, there are still smells I love, or I want to fall in love with.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The smell of soil, the smell of green pastures, the smell of fresh-baked bread. Fou, you smell a little like sunshine.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> And, well, when I&#39;m in your room, Senpai...sometimes...<br> I feel dizzy...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Hmmm? I&#39;m sorry for interrupting your conversation, but something is off. Somehow the system started by itself...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...? I assumed that you were making preparations for a summoning. But you&#39;re right, something is strange\u2014</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> This setup is completely backwards\u2014 Leonardo!

It&#39;s dangerous!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> It&#39;s weird, Mash! For some reason, I can&#39;t move!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> You really should have a good talk with Da Vinci sometime.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> !?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...Where am I?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I&#39;m stuck...between these rocks... I can&#39;t move!</p><p><strong>A\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Looks like you&#39;ve regained consciousness.<br> Are you okay?</p><p><strong>A\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Where is this, you ask? This place is north of Loulan, west of Hami. It lies at the border between the Great Tang Empire&#39;s realm and Gaochang.</p><p><strong>A\uFF1A???:</strong><br> We are at the foot of the Five Elements Mountain, where the peaks seem to be able to reach heaven. And you are under some heavy-looking rocks.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Huh? Under the rocks!? Help me!</p><p><strong>A\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Of course, I&#39;ll help you right away! ...But you seem surprisingly okay? Oops, spoke too soon... Why is your face turning pale?</p><p><strong>A\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Oh. Sorry, sorry. I didn&#39;t mean to tease you.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Is this some sort of kinky play?</p><p><strong>A\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Huh? ...Well, with composure like that, you&#39;re obviously no ordinary person. Still, you don&#39;t look like a demon to me either.</p><p><strong>A\uFF1A???:</strong><br> ...Yes! I need to make up my mind!</p><p><strong>A\uFF1A???:</strong><br> I&#39;m certain that you must be the one that I&#39;ve been looking for. The Buddha must have brought us together!</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> My name is Xuanzang Sanzang.<br> \u2014What about you?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I&#39;m a Master from Chaldea Security Organization.</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> Chaldea? Master? Hmmm...<br> And you say your name is Fujimaru?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Yo, I&#39;m !</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> I love energetic disciples!<br> ...Oops, you&#39;re not my disciple yet.</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> Okay, Fujimaru. First, let me get you out of there. Behold the blessing of the Buddha!</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> aryavalokitesvaro bodhisattvo gambhirayam prajnaparamitayam caryam caramano vyavalokayati...</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> ...Are you okay? Did you get hurt?<br> Do you want me to get you some bandages?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I&#39;m perfectly fine.</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> \u2014I see. I&#39;m so glad! So?<br> I bet you see me in a different light now, right?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Everything is a bit foggy right now...</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> That&#39;s concerning.<br> Okay, let&#39;s take a little break!</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll feel better while we talk.<br> Speaking of which, it&#39;s time for my preaching!</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> All right! Now, let&#39;s start over.</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> Let me introduce myself. I&#39;m Xuanzang Sanzang. Despite how I look, I&#39;m a monk. A proper monk that follows the teachings of the Buddha.</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> I&#39;m currently in the middle of a journey to the far western land, Tianzhu, under the decree of the emperor of the Tang Dynasty. As for my mission... Ummm...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> To get the precious scriptures?</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> What, how do you know? Oh no, I guess I was showing too much of my virtuousness...</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> \u2014That&#39;s right, just like you&#39;ve said!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> To collect...seven...dragon orbs?</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> You mean to materialize the wish granter that could fulfill any wish by offering the blood of those seeking it?</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> Too bad, I won&#39;t be swayed by such an easy temptation. But, you&#39;re on the right track\u2014 Yes, I am collecting something.</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> As for what I&#39;m collecting...</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> Scriptures! I have a duty to collect scriptures! Scriptures that can be found on the way to Tianzhu! But...</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> The demon I&#39;ve subdued to guide me ran... I mean got separated from me. And my horse got eaten... I mean I gave it a break.</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> I&#39;ve been lost... I mean fighting by myself for days and then... I ran into you! I was so scared...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I see. Very virtuous.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Maybe it was too soon for you to travel?</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> What? You got a problem with a virtuous monk like me!?</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> By. The. Way. Isn&#39;t it about time you tell me about yourself?</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> ...I see... Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. Incinerated Earth... Singularities with Holy Grails... Guardians of Humanity...</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> It&#39;s all rather grandiose and hard to believe, but... you&#39;re Fujimaru of Chaldea, which is from the future...</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> I believe your story. This must be part of the Buddha&#39;s guidance... I&#39;m sure.</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> The Buddha exists beyond space and time. He could send a messenger from the future to the past.</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> So, how do you go back to Chaldea?<br> Don&#39;t you have any tools to send an emergency signal?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Actually, no.</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> You&#39;re lost! Oh my, so you&#39;re lost too!<br> Good, good, we&#39;re rather alike, you and I!</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> ...Ahem. I mean, uh, now I know the reason behind our encounter, Fujimaru.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I&#39;m still not sure that I traveled to the past</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> Then again, you can&#39;t pinpoint your exact coordinates right now. In that case, we&#39;re just wasting time sitting here arguing.</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> When I become great, I will say this: Do good deeds, punish bad deeds, and listen to Sanzang.</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> So, Fujimaru?<br> Become my disciple!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...Why?</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> Uh... I mean... I&#39;m...still in the middle of the journey...<br> And I&#39;ve got a long way to go...</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> I&#39;ve got no food... My tummy is beyond empty... But all worldly things are transitory... Anyway, I need a disciple!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> If you will make me your number one disciple.</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> Of course! Easy peasy!<br> You are my number one disciple! Yay!</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> ...To tell the truth, I remember a little bit. I think I&#39;ve experienced this journey to Tianzhu once before.</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> But I can&#39;t remember the specifics.<br> Just like you don&#39;t know left from right here.</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> It&#39;s very strange, but this must be some kind of meaningful fate for the both of us.</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> This journey to the west is a trial from the Buddha.<br> So he won&#39;t give you an answer. He won&#39;t do anything.</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> Most likely there&#39;s a reason for this.<br> To send you back to Chaldea\u2014</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> That&#39;s the challenge I was given.<br> For you, it&#39;s a gift from on high.</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> So... From now on, you can call me \u201CMaster\u201D!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> \u201CMaster\u201D is taken, so... Mentor!</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> Ugh, I feel like I&#39;ve been called that before...<br> No, you must properly address me as Master!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Don&#39;t overdo it, Sanzang-chan.</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> Ugh, just so you know, I won&#39;t take a rebellious pupil like you to nirvana!</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> Anyway, scriptures won&#39;t just fall into our hands.<br> Come, let&#39;s head to the land in the far west, Tianzhu!<br> GO WEST! GO!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Hey, Fujimaru! Are you here?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Senpai! Master! Please answer me!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> This is not good. [\u2642 He /\u2640 She] must have moved.<br> It will be hard to figure out the exact coordinates again...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Doctor! Can you at least send me to the coordinates where Senpai is!?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I&#39;m trying to figure out why [\u2642 he /\u2640 she] got transported right now. It would be so much easier if we knew.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I&#39;ll do my best, of course.<br> But I&#39;m sorry, Mash.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Senpai...</p><h2 id="volume-1-kingdom-of-tartars-along-on-the-journey" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#volume-1-kingdom-of-tartars-along-on-the-journey" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Volume 1: &quot;Kingdom of Tartars: Along on the Journey&quot;</h2><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> It&#39;s coming back to me now!<br> I had three disciples!</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> Say, disciple! Do you happen to know about my past disciples?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Are they a monkey, a pig...and a kappa?</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> A kappa? What&#39;s a kappa?<br> No idea what that is... Kapa, kapapa...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> A black panther, a puppy, and glasses.</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> You mean, a dog, a monkey and a pheasant, right? Huh? Why do I know that...</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> Anyway, speaking of monkeys... Sun... Sun Wukong!<br> My reliable number one disciple!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> So you had pupils before?</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> Oh... I&#39;m sorry. I did say I was gonna make you my number one disciple, huh? My bad.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I&#39;m going to pretend I didn&#39;t hear anything.</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> ...Thank you for your thoughtfulness.<br> You&#39;re so kind, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> But there&#39;s no need to worry! I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll remember why I lost my disciples during our journey.</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> But this is a problem. A huge problem, perhaps.</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> I&#39;m on a journey to Tianzhu, but I wonder why Sun Wukong isn&#39;t here.</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> Not just Wukong... But the other two pupils too... That&#39;s right, Zhu Bajie and Sha Wujing are not here either...</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> This must be a message from the Buddha, too.<br> I mean, journeys are always so mysterious!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> The new number one disciple will take care of it.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> You have me now, right?</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> ...W-Wait a minute, what am I getting so flustered for!</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> I&#39;m impressed that a new disciple like yourself can think like that! But that&#39;s prohibited here.</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> As a disciple, you must follow the Buddha&#39;s teachings and worship him. Be careful not to brag too much.</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> The law of the jungle applies to the journey to Tianzhu. If you are not careful, you will be eaten by demons.</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> But... well... considering the hardships we&#39;re going to face, having another disciple or two would be reassuring...</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> For example... Zhu Bajie...</p><p><strong>B\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Oink, oink.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> !?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Oink?</p><p><strong>B\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Oink, oink. Oink!</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> ...What is this!? I&#39;m hearing the squeal of a poor piggy...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Could it be Zhu Bajie!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> It came from the other side of the rocks...</p><p><strong>B\uFF1A???:</strong><br> I&#39;m oink. Very oink!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Oh, David, it&#39;s YOU!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Yeah, he&#39;s a pig. Definitely.</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> His name is... David? Just like Fujimaru, he was underneath a rock!</p><p><strong>Zhu Bajie:</strong><br> No, no. I&#39;m the cool Zhu Bajie. ...Well, here, at least. That&#39;s how things seem to have turned out.</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> Fujimaru&#39;s friend?<br> Then he&#39;s a member of Chaldea, too?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> A pig? But you&#39;re a shepherd...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Just ignore him...</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> No more indecisive attitude!<br> Anyway, I&#39;ll rescue you from there right now!</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> aryavalokitesvaro bodhisattvo gambhirayam prajnaparamitayam caryam caramano vyavalokayati...</p><p><strong>Zhu Bajie:</strong><br> I&#39;m saved... Thank you! I couldn&#39;t do anything by myself. I thought I was going to become a monster&#39;s dinner.</p><p><strong>Zhu Bajie:</strong><br> Right, but the situation was about to get much worse.</p><p><strong>Zhu Bajie:</strong><br> I was starting to feel good about being squished.<br> Whew, that was a close one, oink.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Ah... You saved him...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> This guy can have fun anywhere, huh?</p><p><strong>Zhu Bajie:</strong><br> It was truly painful! I want to emphasize that part!<br> I mean, I can sue for damages later!</p><p><strong>Zhu Bajie:</strong><br> No, let&#39;s refrain from talking about that now.<br> So you are Xuanzang Sanzang... As beautiful as rumored.</p><p><strong>Zhu Bajie:</strong><br> That dress is so beautiful and perfect for a wedding. Were you expecting this chance meeting?</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> Huh? This is an important kasaya given to me by the Buddha.</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> ...Ummm, don&#39;t confuse it with a wedding dress, okay?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Are you going to ignore the fact she&#39;s basically a nun?</p><p><strong>Zhu Bajie:</strong><br> Why? There&#39;s no problem, right?<br> Anyway\u2014</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Too bad, but she&#39;s ordained. She&#39;s not Abishag.</p><p><strong>Zhu Bajie:</strong><br> Not Abishag? NO?!<br> Such a waste! Well, anyway\u2014</p><p><strong>Zhu Bajie:</strong><br> It&#39;s true her beauty makes me want to eat her up!</p><p><strong>Zhu Bajie:</strong><br> Hi, my name is Zhu Bajie David. Oh beautiful lady with long black hair, I will gladly become your disciple.</p><p><strong>Zhu Bajie:</strong><br> Actually, there&#39;s another one stuck under the rock who&#39;s fit to be your disciple. He got involved in the same fashion as me.</p><p><strong>Zhu Bajie:</strong><br> I guess calling out for help is just too much for his pride.</p><p><strong>Zhu Bajie:</strong><br> Jeez. Pride won&#39;t earn you a penny, oink.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You should have a little bit more pride...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Do you know the word \u201Cshameless\u201D?</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> We&#39;ll talk later! Show me where he is!<br> We don&#39;t want the rock to crush him!</p><p><strong>C\uFF1A???:</strong><br> You have my gratitude for releasing me from this prison. My name is Li Shuwen, an assassin not worth mentioning.</p><p><strong>Sha Wujing:</strong><br> It seems here I will be known as the third disciple, Sha Wujing... You may refer to me as so from now on.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Master Li, are you sure?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Becoming a disciple that easily?</p><p><strong>Sha Wujing:</strong><br> Well, what&#39;s the difference between Servants and Chinese opera actors? It matters not.</p><p><strong>Sha Wujing:</strong><br> How am I supposed to refuse the wish of a highly respectable monk? That aside\u2014</p><p><strong>Sha Wujing:</strong><br> It&#39;s such an honor to meet the Xuanzang Sanzang whom I grew so fond of from the fairy tales I read when I was young.</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> You don&#39;t need to praise me like that... I&#39;m the one who should thank you. I hear you are a renowned master of the spear. How reassuring!</p><p><strong>Sha Wujing:</strong><br> Of course. I will behead as many enemies as you&#39;d like and offer you their heads just to serve you well.</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> ...B-Behead!? Heads? No, no, no! That&#39;s so unsettling! Don&#39;t kill for no reason! It&#39;s prohibited!</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> Oh no... We&#39;re surrounded!?</p><p><strong>Zhu Bajie:</strong><br> It looks like the monsters we got rid of earlier have returned, oink. They brought their buddies to share their food they found in the wasteland.</p><p><strong>Sha Wujing:</strong><br> It&#39;s just been one thing after another.<br> But we can&#39;t let them eat us without a fight.</p><p><strong>Sha Wujing:</strong><br> Is it all right, my master?<br> This is self-defense, not some unnecessary killing.</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> Th-That&#39;s fine, go ahead, Sha Wujing!<br> But try to disperse them first...</p><p><strong>Sha Wujing:</strong><br> Understood. And how interesting. You&#39;re more virtuous than the Xuanzang I&#39;ve read about!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Sha Wujing:</strong><br> Now then. We can&#39;t let Master walk on this long, difficult journey. We disciples are one thing, but she&#39;s another.</p><p><strong>Zhu Bajie:</strong><br> Do you want to ride on my shoulders?<br> I don&#39;t have a ponytail, unfortunately, but... Oink.</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> Uh, I wholeheartedly refuse. However, I do wish we had someone to carry our luggage... Hmm?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> There is something running wildly over there...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> That big red body... Is it a horse?</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> Red? Can it be...</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> The Tartars of this land are known for breeding great horses! Can we bring one over here?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> If that&#39;s your wish!</p><p><strong>White Dragon Horse:</strong><br> [[File:berserkervoice1.png50px]]\u2013!</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> ...Let&#39;s go home.<br> There&#39;s nothing here. NO WEST.</p><p><strong>Zhu Bajie:</strong><br> That&#39;s Lu Bu. Yup, Lu Bu.<br> So the fourth companion is that fierce warrior.</p><p><strong>Sha Wujing:</strong><br> I see, instead of the famed Red Hare, we get its rider instead. Well, it should not pose a problem for us. My master, please take a ride.</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> No! I can&#39;t, I can&#39;t!<br> This horse is scary\u2014!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Whoa there! Whoa!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> What&#39;s in his hand? A scroll...?</p><p><strong>Sha Wujing:</strong><br> ...Hmm?</p><p><strong>Zhu Bajie:</strong><br> Despite your appearance, it seems you&#39;re quite meticulous. You&#39;re carefully guarding that, huh?</p><p><strong>Zhu Bajie:</strong><br> [\u2642 Brother /\u2640 Sister] Fujimaru?<br> Why don&#39;t you show that to the master?</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> ...Th-This is... the lost scripture!<br> You were protecting it by yourself in this wasteland?</p><p><strong>White Dragon Horse:</strong><br> [[File:berserkervoice1.png50px]]\u2013!</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> I&#39;m so sorry that I screamed.<br> You are an amazing attendant, and an amazing horse!</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> It&#39;s scary, but it&#39;s part of my training!<br> Oh magnificent red horse, lend me your shoulders!</p><p><strong>White Dragon Horse:</strong><br> [[File:berserkervoice1.png50px]]\u2013!</p><p><strong>Zhu Bajie:</strong><br> On his shoulders!?</p><p><strong>Zhu Bajie:</strong><br> Wait! There was an option to ride on my shoulders too, oink!</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> Hey, actually, this is nice.<br> Are you used to letting people ride on your shoulders?</p><p><strong>White Dragon Horse:</strong><br> [[File:berserkervoice1.png50px]]\u2013</p><p><strong>Zhu Bajie:</strong><br> I&#39;m used to it, too!</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> What?

The spoils of war are more important right now. Oh, leave the management of the treasure to me. I&#39;ll make sure it&#39;s done right.</p><p><strong>Bronze Horn:</strong><br> ...Victory is yours. Go ahead and do whatever you want with me. I don&#39;t care.</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> How admirable.

I&#39;m not good at that.</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> Okay! Then I&#39;ll write you a recommendation letter to the librarian at Daci&#39;en Temple! Study hard!</p><p><strong>Bronze Horn:</strong><br> Thank you so much.<br> Personally this is the best thing ever!</p><p><strong>Sha Wujing:</strong><br> Bronze Horn...

I should have thought about that!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> We have to save her!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Run, White Dragon Horse!

Ugh...<br> I thought I was gonna die...</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> Apparently, flesh burns even if it&#39;s not touching the fire... So that&#39;s what it means to smoke something...</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> If I wasn&#39;t wearing the Tathagata&#39;s kasaya, I would have turned into coal...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> W-Was it fun?</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> Beyond uncool... These mountains were not fun at all... (Sniff)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Don&#39;t make us worry!</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> I&#39;m... I&#39;m beyond sorry... I have learned my lesson...</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> But...</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> It&#39;s different... It&#39;s completely different!<br> They&#39;re not the Flaming Mountains I know!</p><p><strong>Sha Wujing:</strong><br> What do you mean, my frizzy-haired master?</p><p><strong>E\uFF1A???:</strong><br> ...pai...Senpai...are...there...!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I hear a voice!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Mash!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Oh...thank goodness...

So, what does the Doctor say?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The Doctor is here too, but he&#39;s a little busy at the moment!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> So I will relay the message for now!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...And that was the report on the summoning experiment, and the analysis on this unexpected incident.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The situation is not resolved yet. We can&#39;t let our guard down.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> However, I&#39;m surprised... To think there would be this much time lag between us!</p><p><strong>Sha Wujing:</strong><br> It has already been a month since we first departed from Tartar territory.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> On our side, it&#39;s only been four days since the accident<br> \u2014Oh...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I&#39;m still detecting Servant readings around the Flaming Mountains. I even picked up traces of potent Ether.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I suspect some kind of crazy experiment with magecraft. It must&#39;ve been conducted by a high-ranking Caster as well.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> That&#39;s probably...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> A mage that can hover over the Flaming Mountains?</p><p><strong>Blavatsky:</strong><br> Xa-xa-xa-xa-xa-xa-xa-xa!</p><p><strong>Blavatsky:</strong><br> Great!

But I&#39;m sure this is also the Buddha&#39;s unwavering will.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Xuanzang... Sanzang? I see... so you are a woman!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Oh no... The signal is unstable... The communication...<br> I can&#39;t...correct...time difference...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Fujimaru! Make sure you tell Sanzang what we talked about.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Also tell her... that she herself is the key!</p><p><strong>Zhu Bajie:</strong><br> The transmission got cut off again. I wonder when we will be able to communicate with them again.</p><p><strong>Zhu Bajie:</strong><br> They seem to be having difficulty bringing us back to Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Zhu Bajie:</strong><br> I&#39;m pretty sure it&#39;s because Mash is not here. She would normally have set up the summoning circle for us.</p><p><strong>Sha Wujing:</strong><br> ...We cannot afford to turn back now, either.</p><p><strong>Sha Wujing:</strong><br> The idea of heading to Tianzhu and being at the mercy of Buddha&#39;s guidance doesn&#39;t sound too absurd anymore.</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> Eh... So you agreed to travel with me half-heartedly?</p><p><strong>Zhu Bajie:</strong><br> Hmmm... For Shuwen, he&#39;s content as long as he gets to fight powerful enemies.</p><p><strong>Zhu Bajie:</strong><br> Maybe I&#39;m the same? But what about [\u2642 Brother /\u2640 Sister] Fujimaru?</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> ...What...do you think? Fujimaru?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> There must be light at the end of this tunnel!</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> \u2014Of course! I won&#39;t give up after only one or two lifetimes!</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> Because this is my story!<br> Thank you, Fujimaru!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> The key must lie within the scriptures we gather.</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> The skinny guy from Chaldea said the same thing. In that case, then I&#39;m truly dancing on top of the Buddha&#39;s palm...</p><p><strong>Sha Wujing:</strong><br> \u2014Brothers, wait.</p><p><strong>H\uFF1A???:</strong><br> The Flaming Mountains... They are a test.</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> Uh!?</p><p><strong>Zhu Bajie:</strong><br> Oh, a new face? At any rate, not one we have seen in Chaldea.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Is that the one who&#39;s been following us?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Twintails and a Chinese dress?</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> ...Ugh...

Completed.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Twintails gave her a lecture...</p><p><strong>Zhu Bajie:</strong><br> You&#39;re wrong, [\u2642 Brother /\u2640 Sister].

I&#39;m jealous.</p><p><strong>Sha Wujing:</strong><br> That person might appear collected, but in truth, she was agitated to the point that she abandoned her role as an observer and interfered...</p><p><strong>Zhu Bajie:</strong><br> Yeah. She seemed like she knew our master well... Well?</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> To be honest... I can&#39;t quite remember...</p><p><strong>Sha Wujing:</strong><br> I see. Your memory has been locked away.<br> However... I have an idea as to who she really is.</p><p><strong>Sha Wujing:</strong><br> That flaming spear must be the Fire-tipped Spear...<br> And those bangles she wore must be the Universe Ring...</p><p><strong>Sha Wujing:</strong><br> In addition, her young appearance...<br> Although she does speak in a strange tone...</p><p><strong>Sha Wujing:</strong><br> It appears that she might be Prince Nezha, the Marshal of the Central Altar\u2014 One with a name as well-known as Qitian Dasheng, Sun Wukong.</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> Ne...zha...</p><p><strong>Sha Wujing:</strong><br> Don&#39;t underestimate that young warrior.<br> She&#39;s a doll made entirely of Paopei.</p><p><strong>Sha Wujing:</strong><br> In Chaldea&#39;s terminology, she would probably be called a Noble Phantasm Human.

But she said that since this is EX-ranked, you just need to fan it once.</p><p><strong>Sha Wujing:</strong><br> Princess Iron Fan handed out the scripture she possessed obediently.

What about you?</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> You are not a Servant.<br> You should go back to those dear to you.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You&#39;re dear to me, too.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Do you really need to ask that?</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> Oh...you...DUMMY!</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> You&#39;re all so fearless, you stupid pupils!</p><p><strong>Ox-Demon King:</strong><br> \u2014This is the final warning!<br> You will be disobeying the Buddha!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Get out of the way, Ox-Demon King!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> West, here we come! To the west!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Ox-Demon King:</strong><br> I...It&#39;s...</p><p><strong>Ox-Demon King:</strong><br> It&#39;s not my fault!</p><p><strong>Ox-Demon King:</strong><br> I only made one wish in exchange for complying with the Buddha!</p><p><strong>Ox-Demon King:</strong><br> Princess Iron Fan&#39;s table and tablecloth and tableware and table napkins! Everything!</p><p><strong>Ox-Demon King:</strong><br> They&#39;re all full of that pungent odor of disinfectant.<br> So I asked if he could please do something about it!</p><p><strong>Ox-Demon King:</strong><br> She cooks homey and delicious British cuisine... But that odor ruins everything... I can&#39;t bear it anymore... (Shudder)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> So that&#39;s why her food sucks?</p><p><strong>Ox-Demon King:</strong><br> ...Whew. I apologize for the unsightly manner.</p><p><strong>Ox-Demon King:</strong><br> A fair warning, Xuanzang Sanzang.<br> I do not guarantee anything on your way from here on.</p><p><strong>Ox-Demon King:</strong><br> You will most likely not have the Buddha&#39;s protection either.</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> Don&#39;t worry, Ox-Demon King.<br> Do you think my faith will waver because of that?</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> Besides, that&#39;s what makes a journey a journey!</p><p><strong>Ox-Demon King:</strong><br> All right... Then I wish you and your disciples good luck\u2014</p><h2 id="final-volume-tianzhu" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#final-volume-tianzhu" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Final Volume: &quot;Tianzhu&quot;</h2><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> Gandhara is sooo biiiig\u266A On the other side of Tianzhuuuu lies a mandalaaaa\u266A Lalalaaa\u266A</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...Where is Tianzhu anyway?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I thought we were headed west? Isn&#39;t this south?</p><p><strong>Sha Wujing:</strong><br> You&#39;re asking where \u201CTianzhu\u201D is?<br> It&#39;s India, of course.</p><p><strong>Zhu Bajie:</strong><br> India? Oh, at this pace I thought we were going to Rome or somewhere over there.</p><p><strong>Sha Wujing:</strong><br> At the time Xuanzang Sanzang arrived in Tianzhu, Mahayana Buddhism had already perished and even the famous Jetavana Monastery had fallen into ruin.</p><p><strong>Sha Wujing:</strong><br> It is said that what precious teachings survived were left in the hands of a few monasteries and rare scriptures...</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> What are you muttering about?<br> Look!</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> A river! The Great Golden River! We&#39;re finally here!<br> Oh, dear old Ganges!</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> \u2014!??</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Namastee!? The most powerful \u26055 Indian duo!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Wow, what glares!</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> ...Ugh... What are we going to do?</p><p><strong>Zhu Bajie:</strong><br> ...Are they gatekeepers? Those two look like trouble. They look like they don&#39;t care a thing about Buddhism.</p><p><strong>Zhu Bajie:</strong><br> More than anything, they can&#39;t take a joke.<br> Well, in a way, Karna does have a sense of humor.</p><p><strong>Nezha:</strong><br> They. Underworld. Guardians.</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> Nezha.<br> I knew you would come.</p><p><strong>Nezha:</strong><br> Understand now\u2014 Xuanzang?</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> ...Yes, I do. Nezha.</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> Those two are great heroes as well as demi-gods, the embodiments of my fear...</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> The fear of going to the outside world, the anxiety that I can&#39;t brush off.</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> I was summoned...as Chaldea&#39;s Servant.</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> But since I believed I had reached enlightenment and abandoned all earthly desires I refused the summon.</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> The Buddha will never concern himself with the extinction of humanity. To him, it is only one of the many ripples in existence.</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> If so, it is only my selfishness as a \u201Chuman being.\u201D</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> (That&#39;s why the summoning experiment was incomplete...)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> (But it&#39;s probably Da Vinci&#39;s fault.)</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> I don&#39;t want to leave my disciples anymore...<br> I don&#39;t want to die alone anymore...</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> ...Still. Even if I were on my own, as long as I can continue this journey, I would take that opportunity no matter what.</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> Sun Wukong is not here now, but\u2014</p><p><strong>Nezha:</strong><br> ...Xuanzang. I too. Give assistance.</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> Nezha, you?<br> No, there&#39;s no need for that!</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> You are the Buddha&#39;s messenger, sent to complete this broken scroll.</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> Or perhaps you&#39;re like a lens for me to perceive the Buddha in this hollow world.</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> Isn&#39;t that right, Nezha?</p><p><strong>Nezha:</strong><br> ...Understood. Will. Withdraw.</p><p><strong>Nezha:</strong><br> Chat. Completed.</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> ...Nezha&#39;s gone.</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> I wonder if it&#39;s possible to summon her as a Servant?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Of course! We needed more cheongsam Servants.</p><p><strong>Zhu Bajie:</strong><br> Hey, my outfit&#39;s slit is just as suggestive!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> More importantly, is Nezha a boy or a girl?</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> \u2014Huh? Well, even the Buddha himself doesn&#39;t know much about our Prince Nezha in a Chinese dress\u266A</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> Well, our latest issue has been overcome!<br> I will not stop, regardless of who my opponent is!</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> Guys, follow me to the end!<br> Let&#39;s conquer the last trial, that great river!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Senpai...

I can&#39;t believe there&#39;s no reception over here, either!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Senpai, the anchor for Rayshifting has arrived!<br> You can come back to Chaldea!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> We can only supply magical energy for a few more minutes, though! So...please...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Come back!<br> \u2014Master!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...!</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> This...must be the Buddha&#39;s guidance...<br> No, maybe it&#39;s your own luck?</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> Or...</p><p><strong>Sha Wujing:</strong><br> The right time.</p><p><strong>Sha Wujing:</strong><br> Xuanzang Sanzang. You will remain here, on the other side, and depart again for the new land?</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> \u2014Yes. Thank you for your pointed advice.<br> Sha Wujing\u2014 Li Shuwen.</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> Your expertise with the spear was as great as that of the Sha Wujing I know.</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> Your levelheadedness kept me from crying my eyes out during this journey.</p><p><strong>Zhu Bajie:</strong><br> My turn. To tell you the truth, we believe in very different gods.</p><p><strong>Zhu Bajie:</strong><br> But people learn a lot from each other using the opportunities given to them by the gods.</p><p><strong>Zhu Bajie:</strong><br> So, even though I believe in a different god, this trip has been a valuable experience. Thank you for the rare experience.</p><p><strong>Zhu Bajie:</strong><br> Oh, and all the treasures I collected during this journey... I&#39;ll put them in a savings account under your name.</p><p><strong>Zhu Bajie:</strong><br> When we meet again, I will host a big party, oink.</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> I&#39;m looking forward to it.<br> Zhu Bajie\u2014 Formidable King David.</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> Any dilemma, any situation we met, you faced with a light heart, without panicking or feeling discouraged.</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> I can&#39;t be like you, but I will remind myself of you when I&#39;m in trouble.</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> Zhu Bajie, full of desire, who never lost that quirky personality.</p><p><strong>White Dragon Horse:</strong><br> [[File:berserkervoice1.png50px]]\u2013\u2606</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> Umm? Y-Yes, right? Yes, yes! (I don&#39;t know what he&#39;s saying, but what a strong handshake.)</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> You were great to ride on!<br> Next time, I&#39;ll have a saddle ready!</p><p><strong>White Dragon Horse:</strong><br> [[File:berserkervoice1.png50px]]</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> And lastly...</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> If I ever gain the Buddha&#39;s guidance again and manifest as a Servant in the future...</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> Fujimaru... I will take you as my disciple again.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> In that case, I want to be your number one disciple again!</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> Whaaaat? Isn&#39;t that a bit presumptuous? Hahaha.</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> You have many people dear to you waiting for you at Chaldea, right?</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> But for being a fantastic neophyte who plays a key role in the survival of humanity, I might give you that side benefit.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> If that&#39;s the case, I want you to call me Master!</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> That&#39;s...um, well, that depends on the merits you will have accrued by that day.</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> ...That&#39;s why I won&#39;t say goodbye.<br> Instead, I will recite a blissful sutra.</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> So you will have perfect health, okay?<br> \u2014Ahem!</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> aryavalokitesvaro bodhisattvo gambhirayam prajnaparamitayam caryam caramano vyavalokayati...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Until we meet again!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Ending with a sutra is not really...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Senpai! Thank goodness!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Oops... Well, that was close. Very close.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> If it hadn&#39;t gone well, Mash would have mashed me.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I wonder if the others embroiled in this accident have made their way back to Da Vinci&#39;s lab?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> All right, I&#39;m gonna go and complain to that painter.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> (Sigh)... Shall we have some tea instead?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It seems like they found some precious Chinese tea along with the roll of scriptures.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Apparently it&#39;s called... \u201CRecords of the Journey to the Far West with Fujimaru.\u201D</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I think the tea will be the perfect complement to a recounting of your adventure.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Okay, leave it to me.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Recount?
