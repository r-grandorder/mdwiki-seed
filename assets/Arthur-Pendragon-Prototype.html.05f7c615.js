I never expected to run into another famous Knight of the Round Table!</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> It was just yesterday I resolved to always carry an autograph book with me in case I ran into more opportunities to collect signatures, too!</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> I can&#39;t believe I already failed so miserably!</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> Please be at ease, Lady Bradamante.</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> We serve the same Master now,<br> so we can see one another whenever we like.</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> That said...I may technically be a Knight of the Round Table...</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> ...but I am not nearly as accomplished as the other knights, so...</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> Um... An autograph, you said?</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> I&#39;m afraid I wouldn&#39;t feel right giving you one, so I must humbly decline.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> Noooooo!</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> P-p-please don&#39;t say that! I-i-if I&#39;ve offended you,<br> then I beg your forgiveness!!!</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> Please, Sir Bedivere!</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> N-no, not at all!<br> If anything, I&#39;m the one who&#39;s been\u2013</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> I&#39;m so sorry!</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> Ah! P-please, don&#39;t be!</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> I promise I wasn&#39;t seeking an apology!<br> Oh no, now I&#39;ve gone and said all the wrong things!</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> ...!</p><p><strong>Arthur:</strong><br> Forgive me, Sir Bedivere.</p><p><strong>Arthur:</strong><br> I did not mean to eavesdrop,<br> but I happened to be passing by.</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> My king!</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> Or rather, my king from another world.<br> I, the unworthy Bedivere, am deeply ashamed.</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> I&#39;m afraid I have been unspeakably rude to Lady Bradamante here, a paladin of the Kingdom of the Franks.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> No, no! You haven&#39;t been anything of the sort, Sir Bedivere!</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> I should never have asked you for the impossible in the first place! O-oh, um...</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> May I ask who that is?</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> Ah, forgive me.</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> This is His Majesty Arthur Pendragon,<br> Britain&#39;s King of Knights.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> !!!</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> Arthur Pendragon, the King of Knights!?<br> I-I-I-I-I can&#39;t believe it...!</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> Th-this is such a shock... S-so moving...and shocking!<br> Although, um... Huh?</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> I&#39;ve met the King of Knights here in Chaldea in various forms before, but...I don&#39;t recall any of them being...uh, male...</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> So...does this mean...<br> Hmm...?</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> To elaborate, he is a being somewhat similar to myself.</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> He is something of a guest in this world, a figure who would normally never materialize as a Servant...</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> Whaaa...?</p><p><strong>Arthur:</strong><br> I would humbly suggest you think of me as a mere shadow from a dream, paladin Bradamante.</p><p><strong>Arthur:</strong><br> ...Sir Bedivere, I may not be your king,<br> but I do have one word of advice.</p><p><strong>Arthur:</strong><br> There is no harm in giving her an autograph.<br> Any King of Knights would say the same.</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> Yes, my king.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> Then, does this mean I can have Sir Bedivere&#39;s autograph after all!? Hooray!</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> Oh! Uh, Sir King of Knights!?<br> Could I ask you for your autograph as well!?</p><p><strong>Arthur:</strong><br> Now then, I think I shall take my leave.<br> Good day, Lady Bradamante, Sir Bedivere.</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> Yes, my king.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> Ah!<br> Sir King of Knights...!</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> He&#39;s already gone...<br> Nnn... Nnnnnn...</p><p><strong>Gawain:</strong><br> You wish to know more about King Arthur?</p><p><strong>Gawain:</strong><br> Hmm. We are indeed the Knights of the Round Table, but I am afraid we have had few opportunities to converse with him.</p><p><strong>Gawain:</strong><br> Though Sir Bedivere would seem to have had more chances than the rest of us.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> I see, I see...</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> Hm? What&#39;s up?</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> Oh, the other Pendragon?<br> Of course I&#39;ve met him!</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> The Pendragon from Proper Human History&#39;s True Name is Altria Pendragon...</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> ...so in this case, um...<br> I guess I should say his True Name is Arthur!</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> He&#39;s really mysterious, isn&#39;t he?<br> There&#39;re so much I&#39;d love to ask him!</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> You know, now that I think of it, I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever sat down with him face-to-face. Not even to eat lunch!</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> Hmm, I see, I see...</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong><br> He told us some lovely old legends. Didn&#39;t he, Jack?</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong><br> Uh-huh. He&#39;s really nice. He doesn&#39;t get mad if we sit in his lap or climb on his back.</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong><br> Although...</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong><br> Yeah. I know what you mean.</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong><br> He always disappears whenever we take our eyes off him. I don&#39;t like that very much.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> Hmmm...</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> Eh, my father, the one that&#39;s a guy? Hmm, I dunno.<br> I don&#39;t think he means any harm.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> I see...</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> I think so too! But I also get the feeling he&#39;s avoiding me for some reason!</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> So if there&#39;s something about me he dislikes,<br> I need to find out what it is and fix it!</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> Oh yeah?</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> All that aside, um... Sir Mordred!</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> Yeah?</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> I know you&#39;re the ultimate villain in the legend of King Arthur!</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> But...you don&#39;t seem to be nearly as bad as I thought, now that I&#39;ve met you.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> Ah...</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> The hell&#39;d you say to me?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> Bahahahaha! Talk about bein&#39; honest to a fault!<br> I&#39;m impressed!</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> You&#39;re all right, paladin of Charlemagne! Just make sure you don&#39;t slow us down by dyin&#39; too soon, &#39;kay?</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong><br> Is something wrong, Saber? Remember, Lady Murasaki asked you to keep your voice down in the library.</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong><br> Hm?</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong><br> Saber... Did you do something to this Heroic Spirit?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> Nah, it&#39;s no biggie.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> You know that version of my father who came here from another world? She&#39;s worried he&#39;s avoiding her.</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong><br> Is that true?</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> Yes, that about sums it up...</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong><br> Hmm...</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong><br> ...If it helps, he&#39;s like that with everyone. The only one he talks to with any regularity is Sir Bedivere.</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong><br> He&#39;ll respond to the situation if needed, but I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever seen him engage with anyone on his own initiative.</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong><br> Not even when dealing with Servants he knew in past Holy Grail Wars.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong><br> I&#39;m one of them. He and I once fought each other, though in a place and time very different from this.</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong><br> However, I do not retain a clear memory of that battle...</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> Nnn... Nnnnnn...</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> I thought I heard that Servants don&#39;t usually remember their past materializations...</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> Hmm...?</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong><br> Chaldea&#39;s summoning system is a little unusual in that regard. Every now and then, it summons a Heroic Spirit who remembers their past materializations...or so I&#39;m told.</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong><br> Unfortunately, I&#39;m not one of them. It&#39;s all I can do to barely recall bits and pieces of my own past.</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong><br> Those kinds of memories also affect my Spirit Origin&#39;s stability, so...</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> Huh?</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong><br> Sorry, I didn&#39;t mean to ramble there.</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong><br> At any rate, Arthur Pendragon tends to keep his distance from just about everyone.</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong><br> So please don&#39;t worry about it.<br> I&#39;m sure it&#39;s nothing personal.</p><p><strong>Hassan of the Serenity:</strong><br> ...And that&#39;s all I saw.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Thanks!</p><p><strong>Hassan of the Serenity:</strong><br> I-it was nothing, really.<br> I just happened to be in the right place at the right time.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I see. Arthur, huh...</p><p><strong>Hassan of the Serenity:</strong><br> Yes. I saw him in the underground library.</p><hr><p><strong>Hassan of the Serenity:</strong><br> I just thought you should know.<br> I, um, hope I didn&#39;t overstep my bounds...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Not at all. I appreciate this!</p><hr><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> So that&#39;s the scoop, huh.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> The former leader of the Knights of the Round Table, wielder of the sacred sword, is now Chaldea&#39;s lonesome King of Knights...</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> I don&#39;t know what he&#39;s so worried about.<br> Who cares if he&#39;s from a different world or not?</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Heroic Spirits are supposed to be...</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> ...Ah, well, you know.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> I&#39;m not sure if we can really call him a proper Heroic Spirit or not, so...</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Hmm, yeah, I guess that&#39;d be tough for him.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> What&#39;s this now?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Do you know what&#39;s going on with him?</p><hr><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Haha.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> What do you think?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Don&#39;t change the subject!</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> You&#39;re right. My bad.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Is this one of those things where you know but can&#39;t say?</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Yeah, pretty much.<br> You&#39;re a sharp one, aren&#39;t you, Master?</p><hr><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Until and unless he says something, it&#39;s not my place to talk about it. Especially when I don&#39;t even know for sure.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Why don&#39;tcha just go talk to him about it?</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Maybe it&#39;ll turn out that he wasn&#39;t avoiding anyone, and this was all just a big misunderstanding.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Go on and find out. Who cares whether he&#39;s inscribed in the Throne or not?</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> He&#39;s still a Servant you formed a contract with.<br> If you call for him, I&#39;m sure he&#39;ll show up.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> (Nod)</p><hr><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Right on. Guess I&#39;ll go round up some of the family then...</p><p><strong>Arash:</strong><br> Hahahaha! Sure is taking him a while!</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Never would&#39;ve thought he&#39;d choose Ganryu Island.<br> Well, I figure he&#39;ll show up eventually.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Say, where&#39;s the pharaoh at, hero guy?</p><p><strong>Arash:</strong><br> Oh, he&#39;s not coming.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Well, that was blunt...</p><p><strong>Arash:</strong><br> Said something like \u201CThis errand is hardly a matter worthy of my time!\u201D Sorry, Master. You know how he is.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Oh yes. All too well...</p><p><strong>Arash:</strong><br> Haha, I knew you would. Anyway, just &#39;cause he&#39;s not here now doesn&#39;t mean he might not show up later.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> That&#39;s okay. Thanks for trying, Arash.</p><p><strong>Arash:</strong><br> No problem!</p><hr><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> Can I go home now? If I ain&#39;t gonna get a chance to fight my actual man old man, there&#39;s no point in me sticking around.</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong><br> We&#39;re not here to fight him, Saber.</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong><br> We just thought it would be easier for him to open up to Master if there were other Servants with a strong connection to him here.</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong><br> He might tend to keep to himself at Chaldea, but there have been points in the past where he&#39;s initiated contact with other Servants.</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong><br> Specifically, the ones he fought against in 1991 and 1999...</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong><br> ...during the two Holy Grail Wars that took place in a different world.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> Oh, I get it. Mordred doesn&#39;t get to have any fun...</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong><br> No, no, Saber, it&#39;s not about that...</p><p><strong>Arash:</strong><br> Haha. Don&#39;t worry about it, Doc.</p><p><strong>Arash:</strong><br> Mordred&#39;s King Arthur&#39;s kid, right? Even if these two are from different worlds, they&#39;re not total strangers.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> What he said, Doc.</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong><br> Doc...</p><p><strong>Arash:</strong><br> Anyway, what about you? Your Spirit Origin isn&#39;t exactly, uh, what it used to be, right...?</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong><br> ...So you could tell. You&#39;re perceptive as always.</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong><br> True, my Spirit Origin is still unstable.<br> But I also know I&#39;ll be fine as long as I&#39;m not alone.</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong><br> If nothing else, I can maintain my mental state even if my body changes with my Noble Phantasm.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I&#39;m glad to hear that.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> We should have tea sometime, Jekyll.</p><hr><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong><br> I would love that.</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong><br> Although...I should warn you that my Spirit Origin tends to waver when it&#39;s just us.<br> But as long as Lady Kyrielight\u2013</p><p><strong>Hassan of the Serenity:</strong><br> ...Master.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Right. Sorry to cut you guys off, but it looks like the man of the hour&#39;s finally arrived.</p><p><strong>Arthur:</strong><br> ...I see the gang&#39;s all here, Master.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I thought having them around would make it easier to talk.</p><p><strong>Arthur:</strong><br> I see.<br> You may be right about that.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Would you rather it was just us?</p><p><strong>Arthur:</strong><br> I&#39;m not sure.<br> I might end up dodging your questions if it was.</p><hr><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Just so you know, we&#39;re not here to make trouble for you or anything. Not unless Master gives the okay, and we all know that&#39;s not the sort of [\u2642 guy he /\u2640\uFE0F gal she] is.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> I&#39;m just gonna get straight to the point.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> You&#39;re avoiding everyone at Chaldea, aren&#39;t you,<br> King of Knights? It&#39;s pretty damn obvious.</p><p><strong>Arthur:</strong><br> ...Yes, I am.</p><p><strong>Arthur:</strong><br> I&#39;ve been doing my best not to interact with anyone more than strictly necessary.</p><p><strong>Arthur:</strong><br> All the more so when it comes to beings with deep ties to this world.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Well, that&#39;s awfully straightforward of you.</p><p><strong>Arthur:</strong><br> It was never my intention to hide anything.<br> I simply never brought it up of my own accord.</p><p><strong>Arthur:</strong><br> But if I&#39;ve caused you to worry by doing so,<br> Master, I will always be happy to apologize.</p><p><strong>Arthur:</strong><br> I would never want to worry you.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> It&#39;s not that, Arthur.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> It&#39;s okay. I&#39;m not looking for an apology.</p><hr><p><strong>Arthur:</strong><br> ...I do not belong in this world.</p><p><strong>Arthur:</strong><br> I am but a traveler who came from a faraway land in pursuit of a single, specific goal.</p><p><strong>Arthur:</strong><br> Of course, I am happy to help you, Master. If my sword can help save this planet and bring it a new tomorrow, then I will gladly lend it to your cause.</p><p><strong>Arthur:</strong><br> I will never betray you, and I will continue to fight as the modern-day wielder of the sacred sword.</p><p><strong>Arthur:</strong><br> That said...I came here to eradicate evil before it has a chance to spread in the future.</p><p><strong>Arthur:</strong><br> Once my work here is done, I expect I will be sent back to my own world.</p><p><strong>Arthur:</strong><br> Therefore\u2013</p><p><strong>Arash:</strong><br> Hold up!</p><p><strong>Arash:</strong><br> Just relax a bit, would you? I could&#39;ve sworn you were a little more laid back in 1999.</p><p><strong>Arash:</strong><br> I get that you&#39;re here on a mission, but there&#39;s no law that says travelers can&#39;t make friends.</p><p><strong>Arash:</strong><br> Right, Master?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Right.</p><hr><p><strong>Arthur:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You&#39;re part of the team now. It&#39;s okay to act like it.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> So come on, have some fun with us!</p><hr><p><strong>Arthur:</strong><br> ...Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Arthur:</strong><br> You may well be right.<br> But even so...</p><p><strong>Arthur:</strong><br> ...I want to leave as few traces of myself in this world as possible. You see, I had a premonition of sorts that\u2013</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> I can tell you&#39;re still not being straight with us.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> Hell no he ain&#39;t. Just shut up already, old man!<br> There&#39;s nothing to talk about!</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> If he won&#39;t listen to reason, then I guess I get to\u2013er, have to beat some into him!</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong><br> Saber\u2013</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> You stay out of this.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> Y&#39;know, I just remembered something.<br> I&#39;ve still gotta pay you back for that one time!</p><p><strong>Fran:</strong><br> Uh...</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> You feel like cake?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> Cake sounds good.<br> And hey, I think Cat and Boudica were just makin&#39; some.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> Let&#39;s go get ourselves a slice!</p><p><strong>Fran:</strong><br> Uh!</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> Right on.<br> ...Oh hey, if it isn&#39;t my male father!</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> Yo, pops!<br> Let&#39;s go get us some cake!</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> Hm? That&#39;s weird. He just not hear me or something...?</p><p><strong>Fran:</strong><br> Uh...</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> What? &#39;Course it wasn&#39;t &#39;cause he didn&#39;t want to eat with you, Fran.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> You ran off without sayin&#39; a word!</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> Not a damn word!!!</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> Who the hell just runs off without a word after giving the person inviting them for cake nothing but a funny look!?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> That does it! Nobody does that to me!<br> Especially not my old man!</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> I remember now! I knew I had a good reason to beat your ass!</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Mordred&#39;s got a point, Arthur! No gentleman or knight should turn down an invite without at least giving a response!</p><p><strong>Arash:</strong><br> Hahahaha, looks like you&#39;re outnumbered, Saber.<br> What&#39;re you gonna do now?</p><p><strong>Arthur:</strong><br> What can I do?</p><p><strong>Arthur:</strong><br> You&#39;re right. I was rude to you back then. The least I can do now is face my punishment with some dignity.</p><p><strong>Arthur:</strong><br> Have at you, Mordred!</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> Now that&#39;s more like it! Let&#39;s go, Master! Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;m not gonna kill him. I&#39;m just gonna beat the everliving shit outta him!</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong><br> But if you do that, you&#39;ll...! Oh, forget it!<br> I&#39;ll just have to step in if things get out of hand!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> E-easy does it now!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Try to hold back, Mordred!</p><hr><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> All right Clarent, it&#39;s been too long since I gave you a taste of your favorite blood! Let&#39;s fix that right now!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> Hah! Figures this version of you&#39;d be tough too!</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> But at least I got a good one in for Fran! Didja see!?</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> I got a few good hits in too...but damn, you really are a tough bastard! Almost pisses me off how seasoned you are!</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Don&#39;t hold back, Arash!<br> We&#39;ll never pin him down unless we go all out!</p><p><strong>Arash:</strong><br> I&#39;m just doing the same thing I always do.<br> That goes for you too, right, Missy?</p><p><strong>Serenity:</strong><br> I-I try not to get too involved with warrior types...</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong><br> I&#39;m glad I decided to sit this one out. Hyde might be able to keep up, but there&#39;s no way I could!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> All right, that&#39;s enough!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Everyone stand down! This battle is over!</p><hr><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> Huh!? But we were just starting to have fun!</p><p><strong>Arthur:</strong><br> ...I suppose I&#39;d best not push my luck,<br> given my overwhelming disadvantage.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Ha! Looks like the Red Dragon of Britain&#39;s still confident enough to make wisecracks. Just don&#39;t forget, you&#39;re not the only one who knows his opponent&#39;s tricks.</p><p><strong>Arthur:</strong><br> Confident?</p><p><strong>Arthur:</strong><br> No. That&#39;s impossible. There is never a time nor a place when I do not consider myself to be on the battlefield.</p><p><strong>Arthur:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Arthur, that&#39;s...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> That must mean you never get to enjoy a moment&#39;s peace.</p><hr><p><strong>Arthur:</strong><br> I...</p><p><strong>Arthur:</strong><br> Khh! This powerful magical energy pouring down from the sky... Is that\u2013</p><p><strong>Ozymandias:</strong><br> Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!<br> Hahahahaha! Behold the descent of the sun!</p><p><strong>Ozymandias:</strong><br> I was told that vengeance was to be had upon a certain insolent wielder of the sacred sword, so I have come to lend my aid!</p><p><strong>Ozymandias:</strong><br> Hmm, it would seem that my way is blocked by rabble! This must be remedied! I shall begin by clearing the field!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Ozymandias!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> H-hey, watch it! This is seriously dangerous!</p><hr><p><strong>Serenity:</strong><br> Master! This way!</p><p><strong>Serenity:</strong><br> I&#39;ll take you somewhere safe\u2013</p><p><strong>Arash:</strong><br> Missy, behind you!</p><p><strong>Serenity:</strong><br> Huh!?</p><p><strong>Serenity:</strong><br> A-a Sphinx!?</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong><br> More powerful magical energy readings are right behind it! Saber, keep Master safe!</p><p><strong>Arthur:</strong><br> ...Was he just talking to you?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> Shut your damn mouth!</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> We can get back to our tussle later! If you got time to act cool, then you got time to protect Master!</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Well, whaddaya know.<br> He was the first in line to keep Master safe.</p><p><strong>Arash:</strong><br> Of course. That&#39;s just the kind of guy he is.</p><p><strong>Arash:</strong><br> Even when he was fighting us,<br> he always kept one eye on Master.</p><p><strong>Arash:</strong><br> He must&#39;ve wanted to be able to act at a moment&#39;s notice in case it looked like [\u2642 he /\u2640\uFE0F she] might be in any danger.</p><p><strong>Arash:</strong><br> In that sense, I don&#39;t think he&#39;s any different from you, the red Saber, Doc, or Missy.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Are you shitting me? Ugh, I knew I hated that guy!</p><p><strong>Arash:</strong><br> Hahahaha!</p><p><strong>Arthur:</strong><br> He truly isn&#39;t holding back at all.<br> What is the meaning of this, Ozymandias!?</p><p><strong>Ozymandias:</strong><br> Is that a joke, wielder of the sacred sword!?<br> You should know better than any why I am doing this.</p><p><strong>Ozymandias:</strong><br> Now reflect on your misdeeds, and let the rays of the sun&#39;s light scatter your ashes!</p><p><strong>Arthur:</strong><br> Khh...!</p><p><strong>Arthur:</strong><br> ...Master, it looks as though Ozymandias means business. So there is something I wish to ask of you.</p><p><strong>Arthur:</strong><br> I, um... I would like to keep you safe.<br> Will you let me?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> Hey! What do you think you&#39;re doing here?</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong><br> I&#39;d like to know that too.</p><p><strong>Arthur:</strong><br> H-huh? I-I&#39;m not quite sure what you&#39;re insinuating,<br> but whatever it is, it&#39;s not what I meant!</p><p><strong>Arthur:</strong><br> All I&#39;m asking is that Master let me fight by [\u2642 his /\u2640\uFE0F her] side, just this once!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You don&#39;t need to ask that!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Of course! I&#39;ve never thought of you as an enemy, anyway!</p><hr><p><strong>Arthur:</strong><br> ...Thank you, Master.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> Haha! So we&#39;re up against a bunch of Divine Beasts from the Age of Gods, huh! This oughta be a good way to kill time, huh, Bean Sprout!?</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong><br> This is really not the time to be joking...</p><p><strong>Arthur:</strong><br> I know these beasts are not truly alive. They are merely constructs given form by God-King Ozymandias&#39;s magical energy.</p><p><strong>Arthur:</strong><br> Nonetheless, there is meaning in form. I wish to inflict neither pain nor suffering if I can help it.</p><p><strong>Arthur:</strong><br> However, if the god-king means to attack us without so much as a word of warning...</p><p><strong>Arthur:</strong><br> ...then I will not hesitate to wield my sacred sword!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Romulus:</strong><br> Romans!</p><p><strong>Romulus:</strong><br> Hear me, my children of Rome, and stay your blades.<br> Hear me, sacred beasts, and bare your fangs no more.</p><p><strong>Romulus:</strong><br> Any further bloodshed would be meaningless.<br> Cease your warring at once.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Holy Progenitor!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Wh-what are you doing here, Romulus?</p><hr><p><strong>Arthur:</strong><br> Holy Progenitor Romulus!</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong><br> Wh-why is the Holy Progenitor of Rome here!? Not only that, his magical energy is far, far greater than usual!</p><p><strong>Ozymandias:</strong><br> He said he could not bear to see his children fighting amongst themselves, so I brought him along with me. Hmph.</p><p><strong>Ozymandias:</strong><br> As the son of a god, Romulus ascended to the greatest rank of his mythology. Even I cannot ignore his pleas.</p><p><strong>Romulus:</strong><br> ...Arthur Pendragon, the Red Dragon of Britain.</p><p><strong>Romulus:</strong><br> I am Rome, and Rome is I. As all roads lead to Rome,<br> so do I possess knowledge of all things.</p><p><strong>Romulus:</strong><br> And so, my child, I know where your destination lies.<br> Ahh, my dear child.</p><p><strong>Romulus:</strong><br> This may not be where your journey will ultimately end, but it is a fine place to stop and gaze up at the stars.</p><p><strong>Romulus:</strong><br> You are so focused on what tomorrow brings that you pay the sky no heed, but that is a mistake, my child.</p><p><strong>Romulus:</strong><br> As you have paused your journey for now, this is the time to cast your gaze upward and behold the stars.</p><p><strong>Romulus:</strong><br> Indeed, it is for that purpose that you have come here.</p><p><strong>Arthur:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Romulus:</strong><br> Look to the stars. The great calamity you have been pursuing will come from beyond their borders.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Calamity...?</p><hr><p><strong>Arthur:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Arthur:</strong><br> ......</p><p><strong>Arthur:</strong><br> ...I pursue something truly wicked.</p><p><strong>Arthur:</strong><br> ...A great Beast that will come from far beyond to devour everything in its path.</p><p><strong>Arthur:</strong><br> The Sixth Beast will surely rear its head someday.<br> That is why I am here.</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong><br> A Beast...</p><p><strong>Arthur:</strong><br> It is known as Beast VI and it is one of the great Evils of Humanity, as fearsome as any of the others you have defeated.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> So that&#39;s what you&#39;ve been looking for all this time.</p><hr><p><strong>Arthur:</strong><br> Indeed.</p><p><strong>Arthur:</strong><br> Now that Beast I has appeared in this world, it is only a matter of time until Beast VI follows suit.</p><p><strong>Arthur:</strong><br> When it does, it will devour everything. People... Cities... Prosperity... Corruption... All of civilization.</p><p><strong>Arthur:</strong><br> In a different world,<br> I...we, managed to defeat it twice...</p><p><strong>Arthur:</strong><br> ...but my world&#39;s Merlin told me Beast VI would come once again.</p><p><strong>Arthur:</strong><br> My goal...my duty, is to defeat it a third and final time.</p><p><strong>Arthur:</strong><br> ...I&#39;m sorry, Master. I wasn&#39;t sure what to do.</p><p><strong>Arthur:</strong><br> All this time, I&#39;ve been thinking I needed to fulfill this duty on my own.</p><p><strong>Arthur:</strong><br> But I was wrong. I should have told you what I&#39;m about to say the moment we formed a contract.</p><p><strong>Arthur:</strong><br> Master, please lend me your strength, that I may win this battle. In return I will devote myself to helping you succeed in yours.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You&#39;ve got a deal, Arthur Pendragon.</p><hr><p><strong>Arthur:</strong><br> Thank you, Master.</p><p><strong>Arthur:</strong><br> When that time comes, I hope I can count on your help as well, Heroic Spirits of Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> Ha! You think there&#39;s even a chance we&#39;d sit out for a fight against a goddamn Beast!?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> If and when this thing shows up, I&#39;ll cut it down to size whether you ask me to or not!</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> You said it!<br> I think you and I&#39;ll get along just fine, Scion of Pendragon!</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> That makes one of us...</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Huh!?</p><p><strong>Arash:</strong><br> Haha, hey, you know what they say. We&#39;re all in this boat together, so we&#39;d better make sure it doesn&#39;t sink!</p><p><strong>Serenity:</strong><br> I...don&#39;t think that&#39;s how it goes...</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong><br> Y-yeah. There must be a better way to put that!</p><p><strong>Ozymandias:</strong><br> Very well then. It would seem our business here is concluded, so I will take my leave! Romulus, who became Quirinus, show us out!</p><p><strong>Romulus:</strong><br> We are Rome!</p><p><strong>--ARROW--:</strong></p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> So?</p><hr><p><strong>Arthur:</strong><br> ...Hm?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Are you going to get along with everyone now?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I was hoping you would try to be more sociable from now on...</p><hr><p><strong>Arthur:</strong><br> ...Ah, right.<br> That is what this was originally about, was it not?</p><p><strong>Arthur:</strong><br> I surrender, Master. I&#39;ve learned my lesson.</p><p><strong>Arthur:</strong><br> Besides, I did think that if many Heroic Spirits, or even just you yourself, were to confront me about this...</p><p><strong>Arthur:</strong><br> ...I would need to reconsider my approach to staying here.</p><p><strong>Arthur:</strong><br> I was hoping to stay out of sight,<br> but I never wished to cause any trouble.</p><p><strong>Arthur:</strong><br> Thank you again for having me here, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Serenity:</strong><br> ...It&#39;s over.</p><p><strong>Serenity:</strong><br> It looks like the problem has been resolved. He should get along better with the other Servants from now on...</p><p><strong>Serenity:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Serenity:</strong><br> I&#39;m glad I asked for your help with this.</p><p><strong>Serenity:</strong><br> I would never have been able to figure out by myself whether I should tell Master what I saw in the library.</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong><br> I&#39;m just glad everything has come together as it should. I truly am.</p><p><strong>Serenity:</strong><br> Me too.</p><p><strong>Serenity:</strong><br> By the way, um... Are you sure about this, Paracelsus?</p><p><strong>Serenity:</strong><br> Don&#39;t you want to talk to this otherworldly King of Knights yourself?</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong><br> I&#39;m sure.</p><p><strong>Serenity:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Serenity:</strong><br> I don&#39;t know anything about the Holy Grail War you two fought in, so...I don&#39;t know the right thing to say...</p><p><strong>Serenity:</strong><br> But, I do know that...</p><p><strong>Serenity:</strong><br> ...it&#39;s...sad that you&#39;re avoiding him.</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong><br> Thank you. You really are a kind soul at heart.</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong><br> But it&#39;s all right.<br> Just hearing you say that is all I need...</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> Hm hm hmm\u266A</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> Where, oh where, could Ruggiero beee\u266A<br> Merlin, Lord Merlin, please show me the waaay\u266A</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> Ah! Those footsteps... This presence...!<br> Could it be!?</p><p><strong>Arthur:</strong><br> Oh. If it isn&#39;t\u2013</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> O-oh gosh! Your Majesty, King of Knights!</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> I, um, I&#39;m so sorry about pressuring you for an autograph the other day!</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> I feel terrible about it! I should&#39;ve known better than to ask Your Majesty of all people for\u2013</p><p><strong>Arthur:</strong><br> Wait, Lady Bradamante.</p><p><strong>Arthur:</strong><br> I am the one who should apologize to you.<br> My behavior the other day was truly unworthy of a knight.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> Wha...? H-huh?</p><p><strong>Arthur:</strong><br> Lady Bradamante, I never even introduced myself properly.</p><p><strong>Arthur:</strong><br> If it&#39;s not too much to ask, would you permit me to start over and introduce myself properly?</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> Y-yes! O-o-of course!</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> Oh, but...are you sure it&#39;s okay for a lowly knight like me to speak to the great King of Knights like this...?</p><p><strong>Arthur:</strong><br> Of course it is. You and I are comrades now,<br> both sworn to serve the same Master.</p><p><strong>Arthur:</strong><br> I am a Saber. My True Name is Arthur Pendragon.</p><p><strong>Arthur:</strong><br> I am the modern-day wielder of the sacred sword,<br> and the King of Knights who hails from another world!</p>', 445);
