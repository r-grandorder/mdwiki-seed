I&#39;ll go visit the archery club.</p><p>I&#39;ve worried for a while now about Sakura, wondering whether the awkwardness she had when she first became captain has diminished at all.</p><hr><p>Right as I arrive at the entrance to the dojo, someone else walks out.</p><p>There is no mistaking the impressive uniformed figure and those pigtails.</p><hr><p>\u201COh? Emiya-kun? You&#39;re up pointlessly early, as usual.\u201D</p><p>\u201CI could say the same about you, Tohsaka. Here to submit a membership application?\u201D</p><p>\u201CYou could say that. In the six months we have left before graduation, I thought, why not give rise to a spectacular new legend?\u201D</p><p>Behind the jokes, it seems she&#39;s looking out for Sakura in her own Tohsaka-like way. You&#39;d never see her out and about so early if that weren&#39;t the case.</p><hr><p>\u201CYou came to watch too, didn&#39;t you?\u201D</p><p>\u201COf course. \u2015\u2015\u2015Excuse me!\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CAh, Senpai... and Tohsaka-senpai, too.\u201D</p><p>\u201COh, Tohsaka and Emiya? Welcome, welcome! Come on in!\u201D</p><p>The other club members already packed up and left, so only Sakura and Mitsuzuri are inside.</p><p>The two of them seem to be in the midst of a conversation.</p><hr><p>\u201CGood morning, Ayako, Matou-san. Pardon my intrusion.\u201D</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015Saying that, Tohsaka wastes no time making her way inside.</p><p>It must have been quite a while since she last showed up at the archery range... should I let her take the lead today?</p><hr><p>\u201CSenpai, shall I go back?\u201D</p><p>\u201CWhat are you saying?</p><p>These two are like archery club VIPs, and they picked the perfect time to show up. All of you, stay a while!\u201D</p><p>\u201CWhat? What makes us so important, Ayako?\u201D</p><p>We all sit down in the observers&#39; area.</p><p>Sakura&#39;s shoulders look a little tense from the strain.</p><hr><p>\u201CLook, I talked to Emiya about this already, but don&#39;t you have any good ideas for us? No matter which of the club members I ask, it&#39;s impossible to get a straight answer out of them.\u201D</p><p>\u201C...Sorry to trouble you with this, Senpai.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CThat&#39;s no problem. If you need advice, I&#39;m always happy to help you out, Matou-san.\u201D</p><p>It may just be a part of the pose she always assumes while at school, but Tohsaka seems to be brimming with confidence. I knew it was a good idea to bring her along. Feeling relieved\u2015\u2015\u2015I&#39;m suddenly drawn aside.</p><hr><p>\u201CHey, Shirou, any idea what&#39;s going on here?\u201D</p><p>\u201C...What the heck? Are you saying you don&#39;t know, even with the way you&#39;re talking about it?\u201D</p><p>I beckon her towards a corner.</p><hr><p>It feels completely unnatural for me, but just this once...</p><p>\u201CThe thing is, Sakura lacks the confidence necessary to show leadership in the club.\u201D</p><p>\u201CThat&#39;s just like her. But they said she&#39;s been doing very well these days.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CWho did? Fuji-Nee?</p><p>The members that were there before the last big tournament can tell that the atmosphere is completely different. And although she doesn&#39;t let it show, Mitsuzuri&#39;s worried as well. Anyway you look at it, the club&#39;s unity and morale are just... lacking.\u201D</p><p>Even I can&#39;t help but feel pain saying this. But we can&#39;t just leave it be.</p><p>After gazing at me bemusedly for a moment, Tohsaka...</p><hr><p>\u201CDo you suppose it&#39;s because she doesn&#39;t have the support of a certain ex-archer standing by her side?\u201D</p><p>\u201C...That&#39;s pretty harsh. But I&#39;m in the same place as you are, Tohsaka. Besides, it&#39;s not like I can just lend them a hand directly. That much you should already know.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CYou have a point. She&#39;s the one who&#39;s president, after all... wait, that gives me a good idea. For the sake of aiding my helpless disciple and my younger sister, I shall pitch in.\u201D</p><p>I nod vaguely, and we return to where the other two are\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>\u201CIn times like this, it is best to strengthen the mutual bonds by living and eating under the same roof.\u201D</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015And so she says it.</p><hr><p>\u201CEating from the same pot...... is it?\u201D</p><p>\u201CThat&#39;s right. Going together on field trips, or out to eat yakiniku, or to a sleepover training camp. If they&#39;re all taking their meals at the same table, they can&#39;t help but begin to feel a stronger sense of unity as a team.\u201D</p><p>\u201COooh, good thinking, Tohsaka.\u201D</p><p>It&#39;s a pretty sudden proposal, but she got the point across.</p><p>It&#39;s like the situation at my house. We&#39;ve got quite a crowd living there, but if we didn&#39;t eat dinner all together, we wouldn&#39;t feel as close to each other as we do.</p><hr><p>\u201CSo in that case, wouldn&#39;t a training camp be a good idea? The time for the really tough practice to start is almost here, you know.\u201D</p><p>\u201CAh... yes, I see, a training camp...\u201D</p><p>\u201CIf you&#39;re going to have one, I&#39;ll lend a hand too. And so will you, won&#39;t you, Tohsaka?\u201D</p><p>Shouldn&#39;t the one to make the suggestion be the first to act on it? It was her idea, so shouldn&#39;t it be only natural for Tohsaka to join in?</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015Don&#39;t give me that weird look.</p><hr><p>\u201CMe? At a training camp?\u201D</p><p>\u201CWhy not? Emiya said he&#39;d come along, so why won&#39;t you? Just because you&#39;re not in the club doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;re not welcome to join.\u201D</p><p>\u201CAh... I&#39;d also be grateful if Tohsaka-senpai were to join us. Very much so...\u201D</p><hr><p>The vote is three against one in favor of Tohsaka&#39;s participation.</p><p>Unfortunately, the person we&#39;re dealing with isn&#39;t someone who tends to be influenced by something as petty as majority rule or the prevailing opinion...</p><hr><p>\u201CHmph. If it had only been hiking followed by a yakiniku party, I&#39;d gladly join in, but...\u201D</p><p>\u201CWho would go out of their way to invite club outsiders to a laid-back get-together like that?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CFor heaven&#39;s sake, what...? I&#39;m offended that you&#39;d think I&#39;m only in it for the meat. Yes, I&#39;ll join your little training camp, so you&#39;d better be prepared.\u201D</p><p>Prepared for what?</p><p>Although she continues hurling harsh words at Mitsuzuri, Tohsaka doesn&#39;t seem reluctant to join. Now Sakura&#39;s beaming as well.</p><p>And with that, all those assembled confirm their participation. Mitsuzuri nods in approval.</p><hr><p>\u201CAll right. So, shall we hold it at the usual place?\u201D</p><p>\u201CAh, yes, at the temple\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><p>\u201CEh? Training camp, at the Ryuudou temple?\u201D</p><hr><p>Whoops, looks like we&#39;re out of time for today. The last chime just rang.</p><p>The archery range is a long way off from the school building, where the chime sounded from. We need to hurry back.</p><p>It&#39;s too bad that there won&#39;t be a field trip or a yakiniku party, but a special training camp like this isn&#39;t a bad idea at all.</p><hr><p>\u201CH-Hold on, you didn&#39;t say anything about that!\u201D</p><p>\u201CYeah, yeah, all right already. We&#39;ve already acknowledged your intent to join, so I know you aren&#39;t gonna try anything as shameful and underhanded as running out on us now, Tohsaka.</p><p>Now that that&#39;s taken care of, all we have to do is run this past the student council. Guess I&#39;ll go see Ryuudou about it after Sunday&#39;s practice.\u201D</p><p>\u201CCome on, Sakura, Tohsaka. You&#39;re gonna be late unless you hurry up\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><p>\u201CYes, Senpai!\u201D</p><hr><h3 id="school\u30FBday-1-sisters-lunch" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#school\u30FBday-1-sisters-lunch" aria-hidden="true">#</a> School\u30FBDay 1 Sisters&#39; lunch</h3><hr><p>It&#39;s the afternoon break, which means time for lunch.</p><p>Empty-handed as usual, I, who did not bring a box lunch, am faced with infinite possibilities...</p><p>\u201CI could just go to the cafeteria like usual...\u201D</p><hr><p>Or I could get fancy, and rather than go to a convenience store, run to the Mount Miyama shopping district to buy something, go to Shinto to eat, and come back sometime before fifth period.</p><p>According to Gotou-kun, it&#39;s a rash choice that leaves you unsure as to whether you&#39;re going to eat lunch or go on a time trial.</p><p>It is also said that there are those who completely forget about school and end up playing around Shinto.</p><hr><p>\u201C...That&#39;s how it would be. Even if I just go to Shinto, and come back to school...\u201D</p><p>\u201C? What would &quot;that&quot; be, Senpai?\u201D</p><p>\u201CUh, going to Shinto for lunch and then coming back here.\u201D</p><p>\u201CThat&#39;s unreasonable! You can&#39;t! Don&#39;t do it, Senpai!</p><p>Besides, you don&#39;t need to go so far, since I made enough for you too, Senpai!\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CWha... oh, it&#39;s you, Sakura.</p><p>No, that was only a figure of speech...\u201D</p><p>Here she is. As I turn around, I see Sakura, holding a cloth-wrapped container in her hands.</p><p>...Sakura.</p><p>Could it be that she&#39;s planning to go flower-viewing...? And skip school in the process.</p><hr><p>\u201CThank goodness, I was worried you&#39;d push yourself too much.\u201D</p><p>\u201CIf you&#39;re talking about me going too far, then I\u2015\u2015\u2015well, never mind.</p><p>Sakura, is that a lunchbox?\u201D</p><p>As I point at it, Sakura nods happily.</p><p>Yeah, there is certainly more than enough in there... is this what she was working so hard on in the morning?</p><hr><p>\u201CYes, I was thinking of having lunch together with you, Senpai.\u201D</p><p>\u201CPerfect timing. I didn&#39;t have anything for lunch either... wait, three boxes just for the two of us?\u201D</p><p>\u201CAs a matter of fact, I thought we could share some with Tohsaka-senpai, too.\u201D</p><p>I see, that&#39;s why there are three.</p><hr><p>\u201CGotcha. I&#39;ll go call Tohsaka.\u201D</p><p>\u201CNo, that&#39;s all right, Senpai. Tohsaka-senpai should already be waiting for us on the roof.\u201D</p><p>\u201CAlways one step ahead, I see. Ah, but are you okay as far as archery goes?\u201D</p><p>Since Sakura is the captain of the archery club now, it seems she usually has lunch at the range...</p><hr><p>\u201CI told everyone that I&#39;d be going out for lunch today.</p><p>So you don&#39;t need to worry about me. Let&#39;s go to the roof!\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CNee-san, have I kept you waiting?\u201D</p><p>Away from the public eye, Sakura&#39;s way of addressing Tohsaka changes.</p><p>Tohsaka is waiting for us on the rooftop with the usual expression on her face.</p><p>The kind of face that would send her classmates running away in tears.</p><hr><p>\u201CNo, not at all.</p><p>Moreover, I see you even managed to catch Emiya-kun.\u201D</p><p>\u201CI could hardly turn down one of Sakura&#39;s homemade lunches.</p><p>And I didn&#39;t bring anything to eat today, anyway.\u201D</p><p>\u201CSame here. After Sakura went through the trouble of making it, it&#39;s only a matter of course that I partake.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CThat&#39;s right, and so I did my best to prepare a little feast for Nee-san and Senpai!\u201D</p><p>Sakura happily sets about opening the three stacked boxes and displaying the food inside.</p><hr><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015Those boxes look like something you&#39;d serve a New Year&#39;s feast in, but inside were an array of <ruby>onigiri<rt>rice balls</rt></ruby>, accompanied by a colorful assortment of sides. The festive red and white of the fish cakes is dazzling to the eyes.</p><p>After taking up our chopsticks and saucers, we surround the lunchbox.</p><hr><p>\u201COoh, not bad at all, Sakura. I can&#39;t believe you made all this in one morning.\u201D</p><p>\u201CI did do some of the preparations yesterday. Once you make up your mind to cook for three, it&#39;s actually a lot more fun than cooking just for one, you know?\u201D</p><hr><p>Hands clasped in front of us, we bow in thanks for the meal.</p><p>Being on the rooftop in fall with lunch spread out around us almost makes it look like we&#39;re on a picnic.</p><p>When I take a bite of the nori-wrapped onigiri, a lightly seasoned, savory taste spreads through my mouth. She used konbu... yes, a refined choice indeed.</p><hr><p>\u201CThis is really well done... I doubt I&#39;d be able to match you on this.\u201D</p><p>\u201CIs that so? But I&#39;m sure that you could make an amazing lunch too, Nee-san!\u201D</p><p>\u201C...Well, it certainly would be a lunch that would amaze you, although probably not in the way you&#39;re thinking.</p><p>I&#39;m used to cooking for myself... which means I only do enough to meet the minimum requirements. Although that doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m opposed to luxury in my meals.\u201D</p><hr><p>Sakura and I both nod in agreement at that.</p><p>...You could call it a masterful level of skill in saving money, or you could call it being sloppy only where yourself is concerned.</p><p>As fond as Tohsaka is of extravagance, she can&#39;t bring herself to spend the money on it.</p><hr><p>\u201CWell, it&#39;s not the kind of trait that can be changed anytime soon.</p><p>That&#39;s why I have to say, the way Sakura can be counted on to make enough for three people with such care and precision is really enviable.\u201D</p><p>\u201COh no, not at all. I&#39;m not sensitive to fine details the way Nee-san is, so this is the most I can do.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CWhat are you talking about? It&#39;s delicious, and to top it off, the vegetable shrimp fritters and stewed fish are so beautifully prepared.\u201D</p><p>\u201CIf you cook fried foods this way, they&#39;ll keep for several days. I learned that from Senpai.\u201D</p><hr><p>She even managed to keep the sides served in a broth from leaking and prevented the flavors from mixing.</p><p>She did an outstanding job on this. I nod to myself as I raise a slice of omelet to my mouth. The way she balanced the flavors of the soup stock and sugar is even better than when I make it.</p><hr><p>\u201C...Mmm, hmm. Okay then, since Sakura treated us to such a feast today, I suppose that means it&#39;s my turn next time...\u201D</p><p>\u201CAh, that&#39;s wonderful. I&#39;m really looking forward to trying Nee-san&#39;s lunch!\u201D</p><p>\u201CHmh... w-well, don&#39;t get your hopes up too much.</p><p>It&#39;s been a long time since I&#39;ve made a lunch for someone else... Well, if I think of this an expression of thanks to Sakura and Emiya-kun, I suppose I can put my all into it.\u201D</p><hr><p>The lighthearted conversation between the two sisters continues.</p><p>This is what the atmosphere between the two of them should have been like since long ago.</p><p>Eating lunch together with Tohsaka, the elder sister, and Sakura, the younger.</p><p>Talking about trivial everyday things.</p><p>The bond between the two of them, torn apart eleven years ago, will never return to how it once was.</p><p>But even if this peace is only a temporary salve over the old wounds, and their bond frail and patchy, that doesn&#39;t change how wonderful this rare scene is\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><hr><h2 id="day-2" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#day-2" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Day 2</h2><h3 id="town\u30FBspecial-medical-madison" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#town\u30FBspecial-medical-madison" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Town\u30FBSpecial Medical Madison</h3><hr><p>I promised Tohsaka that we&#39;d go on a date sometime.</p><p>The weather is good, so maybe today would be a good time.</p><hr><p>\u201CHey, Tohsaka\u2015\u2015\u2015Eh, she&#39;s not here?\u201D</p><p>&quot;What&#39;s up with that?&quot; I wonder as I absent-mindedly wander through the doorway.</p><p>And...</p><p>\u201CSenpai? Didn&#39;t Nee-san go back to her house?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CAh, right\u2015\u2015\u2015Thanks, Sakura.\u201D</p><p>Looks like she went straight home after we ate\u2015\u2015\u2015Just my luck.</p><hr><p>\u201CDo you have some business with Nee-san?\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015No, it&#39;s nothing.</p><p>It&#39;s just... I was thinking of settling a debt with Tohsaka.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CHuh. Could it be that Nee-san has borrowed money from you, Senpai?\u201D</p><p>My mouth hangs open at Sakura&#39;s ridiculous suggestion. Wouldn&#39;t it make more sense for <em>me</em> to be borrowing money from one of them?</p><hr><p>\u201C...I wonder if she is all right... hmm...\u201D</p><p>Sakura tilts her head in thought. I head for the living room.</p><p>I&#39;ll call Tohsaka&#39;s house and ask her out over the phone.</p><hr><p>\u201C...............\u201D</p><p>Naturally, I&#39;m quite nervous.</p><hr><p>\u300A...Yes, this is Tohsaka.\u300B</p><p>\u201CUh! D-Don&#39;t surprise me like that, Tohsaska!\u201D</p><p>\u300A......I should say the same to you, Emiya-kun, for such an abrupt greeting.\u300B</p><hr><p>Somehow, she sounds somewhat vague and evasive.</p><p>Fortunately, there&#39;s no one around to overhear me, but I cover the receiver and whisper into it anyway.</p><hr><p>\u201CWell, erm. Tohsaka, are you free today?\u201D</p><p>\u300A......Well, for now.\u300B</p><p>\u201CSo, wanna head over to Shinto for some fun? You know, the debt thing we talked about.\u201D</p><p>\u300A........................\u300B</p><hr><p>\u300A......Okay, that&#39;s fine with me. What time?\u300B</p><p>\u201CReally? Then let&#39;s meet in front of Shinto station at eleven.\u201D</p><p>\u300A...Yeah... Okay... See you later, Emiya-kun...\u300B</p><hr><p>...Tohsaka accepted that invitation awfully quickly.</p><p>It&#39;s unlike her to accept it without complaint and that worries me, but a promise is a promise.</p><hr><p>\u201CI&#39;m going out for a bit.\u201D</p><p>\u201COn a date with Rin?\u201D</p><p>\u201CWhaaaa!?\u201D</p><p>W-Why is Rider here all of a sudden...!?</p><hr><p>\u201CD-D-Did you hear that!?\u201D</p><p>\u201CYes, though just barely. You sounded like you were enjoying yourself so I supposed it was Rin.\u201D</p><p>\u201CErgh... W-Well it&#39;s actually true, but what am I going to do when Saber finds out?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CIf you are worried about Saber, she seems to have returned to her room.</p><p>Unusually, she appears to have taken to a book I lent her.\u201D</p><p>...I see. I guess there&#39;s no need to go and talk to her then.</p><p>First, I need to worry about the date with Tohsaka.</p><hr><p>\u201CWell then, have a nice date, Shirou.</p><p>Do not concern yourself with the affairs here. I shall inform Sakura that you will be back in the evening.\u201D</p><p>\u201C...Okay, thanks. See ya.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C...? Tohsaka must be running late.\u201D</p><p>It&#39;s just about eleven o&#39;clock.</p><p>It&#39;s difficult to contact each other once we&#39;ve both gone out.</p><p>There&#39;s nothing I can do except wait for her to arrive, but it&#39;s times like these that I really wish I had a mobile phone.</p><hr><p>\u201CWell, it can&#39;t be helped if she&#39;s a little late.\u201D</p><p>She seemed pretty half-hearted about it over the phone, so I guess I shouldn&#39;t be too surprised that she&#39;d make me wait.</p><p>I&#39;ll use the time to plan out what we should do.</p><hr><p>\u201CWhat movies are out... &quot;Fate/Zero&quot; and &quot;Tiger Dojo - The Movie.&quot; What the heck, are they really screening that?\u201D</p><p>Let&#39;s see what else is there to do.</p><p>We&#39;ll watch a movie, have lunch...and maybe head over to the beachside park afterwards?</p><p>It would be nice if there were better picnic spots or amusement parks in the area, but I can&#39;t think of any others.</p><hr><p>\u201C...Wait, twenty minutes already?\u201D</p><p>...Now she&#39;s just late.</p><p>I&#39;ll call the Emiya residence just to make sure. Maybe she left a message for me?</p><hr><p>\u201COh, they&#39;ve gotten rid of some of the pay phones. Those are getting hard to find lately...\u201D</p><p>I manage to locate a phone booth.</p><hr><p>\u300AYes, this is the Emiya residence.\u300B</p><p>\u201CAh. Sakura? It&#39;s me.\u201D</p><p>\u300AEh... Is that you, Senpai? I thought you had gone out, what happened?\u300B</p><hr><p>\u201CNo, I&#39;m just checking up on something.</p><p>You haven&#39;t heard anything from Tohsaka, by chance, have you?\u201D</p><p>\u300A...No, I haven&#39;t had any word from Nee-san. Shouldn&#39;t she still be at home?\u300B</p><p>\u201CI see... Okay, sorry for bothering you.\u201D</p><p>I return the receiver to its cradle.</p><p>Nobody&#39;s heard from Tohsaka... At this point, I might as well call her house again.</p><hr><p>If I can&#39;t get ahold of her, I suppose I can take it to mean she&#39;s already on her way. In that house, something as sensible as an answering machine would be... actually, I think she does have one.</p><p>I can leave her a message, so that way, even if we end up missing each other\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>\u300A......Yes, this is Tohsaka.\u300B</p><p>\u201C.................................Wait.\u201D</p><p>How could she be picking up the phone?</p><hr><p>\u201CHello, this is Emiya... You&#39;re Tohsaka, right?\u201D</p><p>\u300AOf course. Who else do you think... would answer my phone?\u300B</p><p>\u201CWell, that&#39;s true... Look, Tohsaka, what time is it over there?\u201D</p><p>\u300A11:25...\u300B</p><p>\u201CWe were supposed to be meeting at 11 in Shinto.\u201D</p><hr><p>...I hear a faint intake of breath.</p><p>That&#39;s weird... her breathing sounds ragged...</p><hr><p>\u300AOh... the clocks in my house aren&#39;t very... accurate...\u300B</p><p>\u201CHey, are you all right, Tohsaka? You sound strange. Is something wrong?\u201D</p><p>\u300AStrange? No, it&#39;s nothing like that. I\u2015\u2015\u2015ah...\u300B</p><hr><p>Just then, I hear the sound of something collapsing.</p><p>A chill goes down my spine, and churns my stomach.</p><hr><p>\u201CHey, Tohsaka!? Are you okay!?\u201D</p><p>\u300AI&#39;m fine... I just fell, no big... nnn...\u300B</p><p>Tohsaka&#39;s voice on the line grows fainter and fainter, until suddenly I hear a sharp thud.</p><p>Did Tohsaka drop the receiver?\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>\u201CTohsaka! Hey, say something! What happened!?\u201D</p><p>\u300A<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Assets-I/berserkertext/main/line16-10.png" alt=""> \u300B</p><p>There&#39;s nothing but silence on the line.</p><p>\u201CDamn it!\u201D</p><p>I don&#39;t know what&#39;s going on, but it sounds like Tohsaka&#39;s fainted at home. That much is certain.</p><p>I hate to think about it, but if she&#39;s been attacked by someone\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>I slam down the receiver and run to the bus stop.</p><p>Before I have time to think about it, my body moves on its own.</p><hr><p>I impatiently drop the bus fare into the coin slot before jumping off and running at full tilt towards Tohsaka&#39;s house.</p><hr><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><p>In the worst-case scenario, I&#39;ll probably have to call an ambulance.</p><p>No, since her house also serves as her workshop, she really wouldn&#39;t want outsiders in there.</p><p>If it&#39;s more than I can handle on my own, I&#39;ll have to call Sakura or Saber for backup.</p><hr><p>I run up the hill.</p><p>I haven&#39;t trained enough. I&#39;m already out of breath.</p><p>Tohsaka&#39;s voice sounded odd this morning. If only I had noticed it sooner...!</p><hr><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><p>A terrible image crosses my mind.</p><p>\u201C...What am I thinking...!?\u201D</p><p>I don&#39;t need more things to worry about.</p><p>For now I should hurry to see whether she is safe.</p><hr><p>I&#39;m finally there.</p><p>\u201CTohsaka! I&#39;m coming in!\u201D</p><p>I force the door open.</p><p>With all the noise I&#39;m making, she should come out and pummel me with angry words\u2015\u2015\u2015or not.</p><p>I made it inside without having to break the front door down. I practically fall through the open door ahead of me and make a beeline inside.</p><hr><p>The phone&#39;s receiver is dangling on the floor.</p><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Tohsaka...\u201D</p><p>The red furniture creates a momentary illusion that everything is covered in blood. I scan the room.</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015There she is. She&#39;s lying on her back on the sofa in the center of the room.</p><hr><p>\u201C...............\u201D</p><p>First, I check for obvious bleeding or injures.</p><p>There are no noticeable wounds, but just in case there are any internal traumas, I should be careful moving her.</p><p>No, is she even conscious to begin with?</p><hr><p>\u201C...Hey, Tohsaka.\u201D</p><p>I timidly call out to her.</p><p>Emergency first aid dictates that I should call her loudly to check for a verbal response, maintain her airway, and quickly call for an ambulance\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>\u201C...nn... ah, huh?\u201D</p><p>As if my voice woke her, Tohsaka raises her head and tries to get up.</p><p>But all her strength leaves her again before she can, and she drops back onto the sofa.</p><hr><p>\u201CEmiya-kun, what are you doing... here?\u201D</p><p>\u201CBecause you collapsed in the middle of a phone call, for heaven&#39;s sake! Don&#39;t you remember?\u201D</p><p>\u201CAh... right.</p><p>I was getting ready to go out, you know, but I came back for a second to... I...\u201D</p><hr><p>...She&#39;s barely a shadow of her usual assertive self.</p><p>Her replies are faint and inarticulate, as if a severe bout of memory loss had overtaken her.</p><hr><p>\u201CThanks for coming to pick... me up. We&#39;d better get going, or we&#39;ll be late.\u201D</p><p>Tohsaka makes another attempt to get up, but I can see her arm trembling as she tries to push herself up.</p><p>This isn&#39;t good. She can&#39;t even stand up.</p><p>I lean closer to Tohsaka and put one hand on her forehead.</p><hr><p>\u201C...I thought so. You&#39;re still not well, are you?\u201D</p><p>As I expected, her forehead is hot.</p><p>With a fever this bad, it&#39;s no wonder she&#39;d pass out once she pushed herself too far.</p><p>And since she fainted at school once before this, I&#39;m sure she&#39;s feeling pretty bad. It must have happened again today since she was walking around in this chill.</p><hr><p>...But it looks as though she&#39;s feeling better.</p><p>It&#39;s just a fever then, and although Tohsaka would probably get mad at me for saying that, I&#39;m glad that it&#39;s not a really nasty illness or some kind of injury\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>\u201C...Emiya-kun? What are you sighing for...?\u201D</p><p>\u201CNo, just feeling relieved. All the way here, I was praying that you hadn&#39;t been attacked in your home.\u201D</p><p>\u201CI swear I was fine this morning... I should be able to just shake something like this off.\u201D</p><hr><p>For the third time, Tohsaka tries to get up.</p><p>A stubborn, sick patient insisting that she&#39;s in perfect health... that&#39;s what she is.</p><hr><p>\u201CIf that were true, you wouldn&#39;t be in this state. Tohsaka, you have a cold.</p><p>Never mind the date for today.\u201D</p><p>\u201CBut...... I couldn&#39;t possibly cancel it after you went out of your way to invite me, Emiya-kun...\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CDon&#39;t worry about that.</p><p>I&#39;ll play nurse for you today instead. How about it?\u201D</p><hr><p>Even if she&#39;s sick, I originally planned to spend the day with Tohsaka.</p><p>I don&#39;t know what her own stubbornness will lead her to do if I leave her alone, so I&#39;d better keep close.</p><hr><p>\u201CAll right. I&#39;ll rest for today, so Emiya-kun, you can...\u201D</p><p>\u201CThen we&#39;re agreed. Now, you can&#39;t walk, can you? I&#39;ll get you to bed.\u201D</p><p>I slide my hands under Tohsaka&#39;s body.</p><p>Then, like I did at school last time, I lift her up in my arms.</p><hr><p>\u201CW-W-What are you doing, Shirou!?\u201D</p><p>\u201CCan&#39;t you see I&#39;m carrying you? It&#39;s not like this is the first time I&#39;ve done it.\u201D</p><hr><p>Last time, it was in front of what felt like half the school, too... that was pretty embarrassing.</p><p>Compared to that, doing this in Tohsaka&#39;s house, far from the public eye, is no big deal... until I consider that I&#39;m taking her into her bedroom.</p><hr><p>\u201C...Mmmh.\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><p>I feel like a newlywed carrying his bride over the threshold.</p><hr><p>\u201CWhat&#39;s with that look, Emiya-kun?\u201D</p><p>\u201C...Um, nothing.\u201D</p><p>Holding Tohsaka in my arms, I carefully make my way through the house.</p><p>Still nervous, my hand ends up at her neck.</p><p>...The fevered blush on Tohsaka&#39;s face makes her look embarrassed, which only heightens my tension.</p><hr><p>\u201CThere we are. You okay, Tohsaka?\u201D</p><p>\u201CMm...\u201D</p><hr><p>I set her on the bed.</p><p>While I&#39;m at it, I take off her shoes and leave them by the side.</p><p>So she wears her shoes inside the house here... Talk about Western-style. But let&#39;s save the gawking for later.</p><hr><p>\u201CDo you think you can sleep? If you don&#39;t feel well, I think that&#39;d be for the best.\u201D</p><p>\u201C...I just need to lie down a for a little, then I&#39;ll be... fine...\u201D</p><p>\u201CIs it your crest again?\u201D</p><hr><p>When she collapsed at school, she told me her magic crest was the cause, but this time seems to be different.</p><p>I don&#39;t think it&#39;s just the crest this time.</p><hr><p>\u201CThis time I just feel under the weather... The crest would be easier to deal with than this, though.\u201D</p><p>\u201CThe stress from all that traveling must have caught up with you... You&#39;ve had a lot on your plate since you came home.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CArgh, honestly... this the second time I&#39;ve fainted in front of you, too. How pathetic.\u201D</p><p>\u201CBut aren&#39;t you glad that it was me you fainted in front of? Think of it as a silver lining.\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015What do you mean?\u201D</p><p>\u201CIf it were Sakura or Saber, they&#39;d have worried themselves to death.\u201D</p><hr><p>Either of those two would have gotten so upset that they&#39;d only make the situation worse.</p><p>&quot;I guess,&quot; Tohsaka manages a weak smile in agreement.</p><hr><p>\u201CIf it had been Ryuudou-kun who&#39;d seen me faint, I&#39;d be done for.\u201D</p><p>\u201CCome on, that&#39;s mean. Issei would take care of you just as well.\u201D</p><p>\u201CI suppose I could count on him to at least say a sutra for me. Well, it&#39;d still be better than showing any weakness in front of Shinji. That&#39;d be really awful.\u201D</p><hr><p>She&#39;s playing tough, but I can hear the fatigue in her voice.</p><p>Just idly chatting like this has tired her out.</p><hr><p>\u201C...I think you&#39;d better go to sleep, Tohsaka.\u201D</p><p>\u201CI hardly need you to tell me that... Emiya-kun, um, I...\u201D</p><p>?</p><p>The way she&#39;s looking at me with her face all red... and lying on the bed fully dressed on top of that... oh, now I see. If she&#39;s going to sleep, she&#39;ll need to get changed first.</p><hr><p>\u201C...Do you need me to help you... change, or anything?\u201D</p><p>Helping a weakened Tohsaka change clothes.</p><p>Assuming she has indeed weakened that far, taking off her clothes would be overly stimulating, and her complete lack of resistance would make this so suggestive that it&#39;d be very bad for me\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>\u201CWha... What are you thinking, Shirou?!\u201D</p><p>\u201CY-You&#39;re right, we need another girl for this. I&#39;d better go call Sakura or one of the others.\u201D</p><p>\u201C..................\u201D</p><hr><p>A sudden silence descends on the room.</p><p>Sakura&#39;s her sister, after all. We can count on her at a time like this.</p><hr><p>\u201C...I&#39;m fine, no need to call Sakura.</p><p>Not for something as simple as changing and wiping the sweat down.\u201D</p><p>\u201COh, good... wait, that&#39;s not good at all, but, arrghh, either way it&#39;s a bad idea for me to be in this room right now!\u201D</p><hr><p>I can&#39;t think of a good excuse for making that suggestion.</p><p>Flustered, I stand up from my chair, filling my head with a list of things I&#39;ll need to do to care for Tohsaka.</p><hr><p>\u201CI-I&#39;ll go get some water and a basin from downstairs.\u201D</p><p>\u201C...Okay. And there&#39;s an ice pack in that cabinet over there.\u201D</p><hr><p>I open the drawer she indicates to find a rubber-insulated ice pack inside.</p><p>I hope she&#39;ll be done by the time I fill it with ice.</p><p>Looking at the time, I see that it&#39;s past noon.</p><hr><p>\u201C...Oh, it&#39;s just about lunchtime.</p><p>Tohsaka, do you feel like eating anything?\u201D</p><p>\u201CMaybe just a little, though I don&#39;t think I could stomach anything greasy...\u201D</p><p>\u201CThen I&#39;ll borrow your kitchen for a bit. I&#39;ll make you something light.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015Well then.</p><p>I use Tohsaka&#39;s kitchen and make her lunch, then return to her room with the things I&#39;ll need to care for her in hand.</p><hr><p>\u201CI&#39;m coming in, Tohsaka.\u201D</p><p>\u201C...Go ahead. I&#39;m done changing.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C..................\u201D</p><p>My breath catches ever so slightly in my throat.</p><p>The unusual sight of her pajama-clad figure before me is making my heart pound.</p><hr><p>\u201C...Umm... yeah, how&#39;re you feeling?\u201D</p><p>\u201CA little better than before.</p><p>You&#39;ve got quite a load there.\u201D</p><hr><p>I have the ice pack jammed under my arm, since my hands are occupied by the tray with her lunch on it. I don&#39;t see any other way I could&#39;ve carried it.</p><p>Tohsaka is sitting on the bed, and looking across the room at me.</p><p>...She doesn&#39;t look like she&#39;s feeling any better yet.</p><hr><p>\u201CHere&#39;s your ice pack\u2015\u2015\u2015oh, and I didn&#39;t bring any cold medicine. Should I run out and get some?\u201D</p><p>\u201CAh, no need for that. I already made some of my family&#39;s traditional stuff.\u201D</p><p>Geh. Tohsaka mentioning homemade medicine brings to mind...</p><p>...a rather gruesome scene.</p><hr><p>\u201CTaking that and then resting for the remainder of the day will cure me of pretty much any cold. Furthermore, I&#39;m accustomed to the earth of this estate, so if worse comes to worst, I can always go down into the basement and\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><p>\u201CThat means you&#39;d better get proper nutrition. Will you have some?\u201D</p><p>Hoping to cut off a potentially disturbing description of what she plans to do down there, I offer her the tray.</p><hr><p>Tohsaka eyes me dubiously\u2015\u2015\u2015as if wondering what on earth I put on this tray.</p><hr><p>\u201CEmiya-kun, what&#39;s this stuff you made?\u201D</p><p>\u201COatmeal.\u201D</p><p>Just as I feared, she immediately frowns in displeasure.</p><p>So the standard formula of &quot;oatmeal prepared for the sick = tasteless&quot; is one known even to Tohsaka.</p><hr><p>\u201CUgh... you wouldn&#39;t mean haferflockensuppe, by chance, would you?\u201D</p><p>\u201CYou mean oatmeal porridge with a milk base? I thought about it, figured you wouldn&#39;t like it, and made something a little different.</p><p>I tried adding turnip and green onions, making it something closer to a porridge consomm\xE9.\u201D</p><hr><p>I confidently present my dish to Tohsaka.</p><p>The gentle aroma of the consomm\xE9, subtly different from oatmeal, fills the air. It&#39;s clear from a glance that it&#39;s a grain porridge.</p><hr><p>Taking the spoon in her hand, Tohsaka stares hard at the dish.</p><p>Is there some kind of oatmeal-related trauma in her past, or is she just wary of foods she&#39;s never tried before?</p><p>\u201CAh... om......\u201D</p><hr><p>Bringing the spoon to her mouth, Tohsaka sends intermittent looks my way as she swallows the porridge.</p><hr><p>\u201CHmm... this is pretty good...\u201D</p><p>\u201CSorry, it&#39;s just something I whipped up at random. It&#39;s not as nourishing as milk-based porridge would be, but... it is supposed to aid your digestion, though.\u201D</p><hr><p>Alone together and bickering over oatmeal.</p><p>Who&#39;d have thought our lunch date would go like this?</p><p>Well, I suppose that eating homemade porridge served in your own bedroom is more soothing than a meal at a Shinto restaurant.</p><hr><p>\u201C...Fine. I&#39;ll acknowledge your cooking skills this time, Emiya-kun.</p><p>Just you wait. The next time you catch a cold, I&#39;ll be the one to surprise you with my ability.\u201D</p><p>\u201C...Your ability to make oatmeal?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CShut up about oatmeal already. When you get sick, I&#39;ll show you how the three thousand years of history behind Chinese food makes it the best for an ill person! That&#39;s where the saying &quot;medicine and proper diet are the essentials for a healthy body&quot; will come to Shirou&#39;s rescue, and\u2015\u2015\u2015haah...\u201D</p><hr><p>And just when I thought her great plan for revenge had her fired up.</p><p>Tohsaka&#39;s spoon clinks against the nearly empty dish as she sets it down. I might have made too much for her to finish it all.</p><hr><p>\u201C...Thanks for the meal, Emiya-kun.\u201D</p><p>\u201CI&#39;m glad you enjoyed it. Sorry for using up the stuff in your kitchen.\u201D</p><p>\u201CThat&#39;s okay. I&#39;m the one who got to eat it, after all...\u201D</p><hr><p>After I tidy away her dish and utensils, I seat myself at the side of the bed.</p><p>...Well then, she&#39;ll probably be in the mood for a cup of tea after that.</p><p>\u201CGuess I&#39;ll go make some tea now. I&#39;ll be borrowing your kitchen again, Tohsaka.\u201D</p><p>\u201CAh, in that case, please make it chamomile tea, Emiya-kun.\u201D</p><hr><p>&quot;Got it,&quot; I say as I stand and pick up her tableware.</p><p>Maybe some of this gallantry is rubbing off on me as I take care of Tohsaka here\u2015\u2015\u2015Well, not that this is much different from what I usually do.</p><p>Just hearing that she had a cold put me in a completely different mental state.</p><p>It could be my paternal instincts coming to the forefront, or it could be that Tohsaka&#39;s helplessness makes her seem so cute\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>\u201C...If her cold continued on forever, she would... no, no way.\u201D</p><p>Having Tohsaka stay sweet and modest would definitely not be good.</p><hr><p>\u201C...Asking for chamomile must mean she wants to rest.\u201D</p><p>I recall the knowledge of herbs she&#39;d taught me as I get out a light blue teacup.</p><p>Once Tohsaka&#39;s asleep, I&#39;ll have Sakura come take my place. Having a man around getting in the way when her various nightly affairs need tending to would be a bad idea.</p><hr><p>\u201C...I&#39;m coming in, Tohsaka\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><p>\u201C............\u201D</p><p>Tohsaka doesn&#39;t answer. Maybe she dozed off.</p><p>I slowly push the door open, only to be met with Tohsaka&#39;s flushed face\u2015\u2015\u2015Has she taken a turn for the worse?</p><hr><p>\u201CAh... thanks, Emiya-kun.\u201D</p><p>\u201CHere you go... after you&#39;ve drank it, how about getting some sleep? I&#39;ll stay here with you until then.\u201D</p><p>&quot;I&#39;ll watch over you until you fall asleep&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015saying that to the normal Tohsaka would only earn me a reply of, &quot;What the heck?&quot;, right before she&#39;d burst out laughing.</p><hr><p>She gulps down her herbal tea.</p><p>...The cold may be sapping her strength today, but I&#39;m sure by this time tomorrow she&#39;ll be back to her usual fearless, confident, energetic self.</p><p>\u201C...Maaan, it&#39;s really too bad.\u201D</p><p>\u201CEmiya-kun, you prefer ladylike girls, don&#39;t you?\u201D</p><hr><p>...Tohsaka&#39;s uncannily sharp remark completely takes me by surprise.</p><p>But of course. She may look weak, but Tohsaka is still Tohsaka.</p><hr><p>\u201CYou have a weakness for girly girls, like Sakura and Illya. Could it be because of your paternal instincts?\u201D</p><p>\u201C...You might be right about that, normally. But I prefer you when you&#39;re well to how you are now, Tohsaka.\u201D</p><hr><p>I speak honestly from the heart.</p><p>Ladylike, she says... Anyway, forget that. What kind of jerk would take pleasure in seeing someone else sick?</p><p>Even once she&#39;s back to normal and working me so hard that today seems like a day off by comparison, seeing Tohsaka in sound health will make me a lot happier.</p><hr><p>\u201CHmm? So you&#39;re satisfied with just that, Emiya-kun?\u201D</p><p>Tohsaka&#39;s slightly reddened face is turned this way, her eyes watching me attentively.</p><p>The room fills with both silence and the aroma of the herbal tea we&#39;ve been drinking.</p><hr><p>\u201C...Well, I suppose I&#39;ll have to get better right away so we can go out tomorrow.\u201D</p><p>\u201CSure, if you&#39;d spend the time with me.</p><p>...But it&#39;d be nice if you didn&#39;t give me reason to panic like today ever again. My heart&#39;s not going to last.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CYou&#39;re right about that. I&#39;m in your debt again, too\u2015\u2015\u2015This isn&#39;t good. Borrowing has to be done systematically...\u201D</p><hr><p>Time passes slowly as we sit quietly, intermittently raising the cups to our lips. This stuff really works... Looks like the herbs Tohsaka has at her house really work to make you... <em>yawn</em> sleepy.</p><hr><p>\u201C<em>yawn</em>... Emiya-kun, thank you so much... for today.\u201D</p><p>\u201CIt was nothing. You don&#39;t need to worry about returning the favor or anything like that, either.</p><p>...You going to sleep now?\u201D</p><p>\u201CYeah.\u201D</p><hr><p>I get up to my feet and pull the blanket over her.</p><p>Her head is turned sideways, looking in my direction.</p><p>I know Tohsaka is stealing glances this way\u2015\u2015\u2015although her eyes are downcast, I can feel them on me.</p><hr><p>\u201C...What&#39;s wrong, Tohsaka?\u201D</p><p>\u201CWell... you&#39;ve already done so much to help me out today, Emiya-kun, so... this will be my last request.\u201D</p><hr><p>Those words make my heart throb.</p><p>That murmur of &quot;last request&quot; falls from her lips, shining wetly in the reddened face cradled by her pillow.</p><hr><p>\u201C...Well, I don&#39;t suppose I can turn it down if it&#39;s your last one.\u201D</p><p>\u201CThen... can you give me\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015a goodnight kiss?\u201D</p><hr><p>Wait, that&#39;s all?</p><p>A goodnight kiss is just a momentary peck on the forehead or cheek. That&#39;s hardly even worth making a request for\u2015\u2015\u2015Wait, did Tohsaka just ask me to kiss her...?</p><hr><p>\u201CUm, well... are you sure?\u201D</p><p>\u201CBut... even though I&#39;ve given you one before... you&#39;ve never kissed me, Emiya-kun.\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015Yeah, but...\u201D</p><hr><p>The times when Tohsaka&#39;s kissed me were almost all surprise, if not to say rather violent attacks. I&#39;ve never kissed her myself... my heart is throbbing so hard now it&#39;s nearly painful.</p><hr><p>It&#39;s not as if this is as stressful as magecraft.</p><p>Unlike that particular art, there&#39;s no chance I&#39;ll die a horrible death if I get this one wrong... although I wouldn&#39;t make a mistake in the first place.</p><p>But if I kiss Tohsaka, I somehow feel like I might have a different sort of near-death experience.</p><hr><p>\u201C...Got it... here goes.\u201D</p><p>I&#39;ve somehow gone stiff as a board.</p><p>A strange tension suddenly overtakes me, making my movements jerky.</p><hr><p>Now that it&#39;s come to this, it&#39;d be best to just close my eyes\u2015\u2015\u2015and just let my lips kiss Tohsaka anywhere.</p><p>Even if it were on her lips, that would be fine.</p><hr><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><p>I open my eyes just a crack, letting a ray of light penetrate the darkness.</p><p>Into my field of vision leaps Tohsaka&#39;s face, and even as the tension threatens to suffocate me, I bring my lips ever closer.</p><hr><p>\u201CMmm...............\u201D</p><p>They softly brush her skin, ever so slightly tinged with sweat.</p><p>I break away immediately. Letting that kiss linger wouldn&#39;t be good.</p><hr><p>\u201C......All done, Tohsaka.\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015I give it a 6.5.\u201D</p><p>Eeeh!?</p><p>Tohsaka raises her face to sternly inform me of my score.</p><hr><p>\u201CDon&#39;t close your eyes when you do it. I had no idea where you were trying to kiss me at first.</p><p>And it feels really weird if you bring your face close to someone else&#39;s with your teeth chattering that way.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CEasy for you to say. Weren&#39;t you trembling yourself?\u201D</p><p>\u201C...I probably was. This was my first, after all.\u201D</p><hr><p>...First kiss with me as the initiator, she means.</p><p>I fight the urge to rub my lips with my fingers. I feel like her taste must still be lingering there.</p><hr><p>\u201C...Geez, if you&#39;re this energetic you must be nearly back to normal already. I feel like a fool for getting so worried about you.\u201D</p><p>\u201CI suppose having you here to make fun of helped bring my vitality back\u2015\u2015\u2015Good night, Emiya-kun.</p><p>Try for a higher score the next time you do it.\u201D</p><hr><p>She smiles up at me from the bed.</p><p>......Oh well.</p><p>I already knew that I&#39;m no match for Tohsaka in matters like this.</p><hr><p>\u201CThen I&#39;ll come check on you one more time after I&#39;m done washing the dishes\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><p>\u201CI&#39;ll try and sleep until nightfall... so you can go home now. Don&#39;t worry about it.\u201D</p><p>\u201CNo. Tonight, if I need help, I&#39;ll call for Saber or Sakura.\u201D</p><hr><p>&quot;No, I&#39;ll be fine,&quot; Tohsaka replies.</p><p>Judging by how she looks now, a little rest should be enough to have her back in perfect health.</p><p>As she&#39;s dozing off, I add one last remark.</p><hr><p>\u201C...Consider your debt settled with that last kiss.\u201D</p><p>\u201CThat&#39;s all right. What you did for me this time all falls under the heading of special privileges for the sick\u2015\u2015\u2015so we&#39;ll settle it some other time.\u201D</p><hr><p>With a sigh, Tohsaka&#39;s breaths fall slow and silent.</p><p>Already asleep... or pretending to be in order to reassure me. It&#39;s fine either way. With one last backward glance at Tohsaka, I rise and head back to the kitchen.</p><hr><p>I stayed in Tohsaka&#39;s living room until dusk.</p><p>I&#39;m leaving behind a note telling her to contact me if anything should happen.</p><hr><p>\u201CGoodnight, Tohsaka. I&#39;ll see you tomorrow\u2015\u2015\u2015or tonight, if you&#39;d prefer.\u201D</p><p>With that parting remark, I leave the house.</p><p>It&#39;d be nice if we could go on a real date next time, without any accidents like this.</p><hr><h2 id="day-3" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#day-3" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Day 3</h2><h3 id="emiya-s\u30FBday-3-what-kind-of-wedding" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#emiya-s\u30FBday-3-what-kind-of-wedding" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Emiya&#39;s\u30FBDay 3 What kind of wedding</h3><hr><p>We&#39;re all sitting in the living room as lunchtime draws near.</p><p>Suddenly, while watching television,</p><p>\u201CIt sure would be nice to get married.\u201D</p><p>Those are the words I hear.</p><hr><p>I sense a sudden and awkward tension in the air.</p><p>...I bet everyone felt the same way.</p><p>\u201CWhat&#39;s this?

Who knows what tragedy might have unfolded if we let her go on.\u201D</p><p>To begin with, it was Tohsaka who gave the order.</p><hr><p>\u201CWhat?

Well, you know, if you tell her that, Fuji-Nee may take a while to get it, too.\u201D</p><p>\u201CYeah, that&#39;s the way it usually is. It&#39;s the kind of topic we&#39;re all particularly distant from.\u201D</p><p>She&#39;s right about that. None of the usual crowd that gathers here has what you&#39;d call a normal life in regards to marriage or family living.</p><hr><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015Suddenly, Sakura&#39;s eyes meet mine.</p><p>Tohsaka noticed.

Didn&#39;t you have a priest for a guardian and all?\u201D</p><p>\u201CBut I wasn&#39;t living at the church, and it&#39;s not like we were close to begin with.\u201D</p><hr><p>...I suppose so.</p><p>Although I&#39;ve never seen one myself, the church is where weddings are supposed to take place in Fuyuki.</p><hr><p>\u201C...Come to think of it, have there ever been any couples who got married by that guy?\u201D</p><p>...That sounds... how should I put this...? Less like being wed and more like being judged before God, some weird occasion like that...</p><hr><p>\u201CSure there were.</p><p>...Well, we know what kind of guy he really was, but that doesn&#39;t mean he wasn&#39;t devoted to his duties as a priest. I&#39;m sure the couples who married in his church were quite satisfied.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015 Right.</p><p>The scary thing is, aside from his personality, as a priest THAT man was perfect.</p><p>...Well, Kuzuki-sensei and Caster&#39;s story is the closest it gets to a marriage... does that count?</p><hr><p>\u201CWould you mind if I interrupted for a moment?</p><p>I have had some experience with the concept of a &quot;wedding&quot; myself. The ceremony, such as it was, was held at the castle.\u201D</p><p>\u201CHuh\u2015\u2015\u2015?\u201D</p><p>Sakura, Tohsaka, and I freeze in shock.</p><hr><p>\u201CWhat are you all acting surprised for? It&#39;s only natural for Saber to have already been married.\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015Come to think of it, it really is.\u201D</p><p>...I see.</p><p>Saber&#39;s legend includes a lot of facts that may or may not be true, but marriage is one that is often mentioned.</p><p>It&#39;s just that knowing the way it ends, it can&#39;t possibly be a good topic to bring up out of mere curiosity.</p><hr><p>Tohsaka and Sakura seem to have the same thought as we exchange glances.</p><hr><p>\u201CSo, how did the two of you end up living together?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CI do not think I will be very helpful as reference, Illyasviel. Would that still be acceptable?\u201D</p><p>\u201CYeah, I&#39;m not planning a thorough study or anything.\u201D</p><p>\u201CIs that so?\u201D</p><p>This is the part where not having Fuji-Nee around really helps.</p><hr><p>\u201CThe ceremony was magnificent and grand. As the entire country was involved, it lasted for nearly seven days.</p><p>When she\u2015\u2015\u2015Guinevere and I were wed, our marriage was celebrated by all throughout the land. I swore to love her as a man, falsehood though it all was.</p><p>...However, I was a king before I was her husband.</p><p>To put it in a more cruel manner, you could say that I married her as a king.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C...Then you two were married even though you didn&#39;t love her?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C...That is right. Though I did bear her good will in my own way, I am certain it was insufficient for a husband.</p><p>As a result, we betrayed each other. She led a life of misfortune, and I bear part of the blame for allowing her honor to be soiled.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CStill\u2015\u2015\u2015I, as a man, tried to love her as much as I possibly could.</p><p>While it was a political marriage, the wedding ceremony itself was the time when I could earnestly wish her happiness. To me, as a human, that was a very blissful moment.\u201D</p><hr><p>...The way she told the story was much too calm. Just what kind of different emotions were mixed in there, I could not possibly understand.</p><p>Saber&#39;s ever so slightly lonely smile brought her story to an end.</p><hr><h3 id="emiya-s\u30FBday-3-gorgon-s-cellar" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#emiya-s\u30FBday-3-gorgon-s-cellar" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Emiya&#39;s\u30FBDay 3 Gorgon&#39;s cellar</h3><hr><p>Perhaps I should pop into the storehouse for a moment and see how things look.</p><p>All I&#39;ve been doing in here lately is organizing the place, so I thought I&#39;d try fixing some of the broken things I&#39;d set aside in here for a change.</p><hr><p>\u201CShirou, do you have a moment?\u201D</p><p>\u201CHmm?

Since then, rumors about them being monsters started circulating amongst people.</p><hr><p>However, a rumor is still only a rumor.</p><p>They did not become monsters, and merely continued to spend their days like before.</p><p>The legendary, infamous Medusa aside, the first and second daughters were literally &quot;perfected&quot; goddesses.</p><hr><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015The eldest daughter, Stheno.</p><p>A lady with elegant demeanor, overflowing grace, and wisdom in her actions and words.</p><p>A goddess said to be the ideal woman.</p><p>It is said that merely hearing one&#39;s name escape from her lips is enough to make a man lose his senses over the rapturous feeling, and swear eternal loyalty to her.</p><hr><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015The second daughter, Euryale.</p><p>A lady with carefree demeanor, overflowing smile, and the essence of purity in her actions and words.</p><p>A goddess said to be the ideal girl.</p><p>It is said that merely hearing one&#39;s name escape from her lips is enough to make a man tremble all over with honor, and swear to protect her even at the cost of his life.</p><hr><p>Unlike Medusa, these two goddesses had neither Mystic Eyes nor supernatural strength.</p><p>With merely the power of immortality and eternal youth, they were just weak girls.</p><p>Athena lied to them.</p><p>That because they were monsters, they would never grow old.</p><p>That was false.</p><p>Different from other Olympus gods who needed to consume the golden apples to stop aging, the sisters, especially Stheno and Euryale, were born into this world as &quot;idols,&quot; completely immortal.</p><hr><p>They were the embodiment of the yearning hearts of men.</p><p>Although they would never age, they were the weakest beings in this world.</p><p>With no fighting abilities, these immortal girls would starve if left alone. Thus, they needed help from others.</p><p>That is the &quot;divine essence&quot; of these Gorgon sisters.</p><hr><p>From the moment they were created and up until the moment they are destroyed, they will remain the same.</p><p>Except the youngest, who was a failure from birth.</p><hr><p>The youngest daughter, Medusa.</p><p>Different from her older sisters, she did not have the skills of a &quot;perfect&quot; goddess.</p><p>The two older sisters were &quot;forever young,&quot; but Medusa was not.</p><p>As a result, in spite of being the sister, Medusa grew older, and was revered as a monster different from her sisters.</p><hr><p>...As a side note, one ought to mention that she was a great goddess nevertheless.</p><p>The Gorgon sisters were the results of the deification of the same natural phenomena.</p><p>One could call them copies or, better yet, clones.</p><p>It could have been a mistake during her birth, or there might have been a deeper significance to it, but the youngest sister Medusa was not copied completely.</p><hr><p>The elder sisters embodied the concept of &quot;forever young and immortal,&quot; yet Medusa received nothing of the sort.</p><p>Nevertheless, as a compensation, Medusa was endowed with various abilities which her sisters were not.</p><p>The Mystic Eyes of Petrification, a supernatural ability to interfere with nature, and excellent physical abilities.</p><p>All of those can be said to be divine powers indispensable in protecting her sisters who couldn&#39;t live in this world by themselves.</p><hr><p>...However, it was those physical differences that caused the sisters, once united, to become three different individuals.</p><p>It is not a surprising development for Medusa, different from the start. But in the process of interacting with one such sibling, even the two others, who were meant to be the same, eventually showed slight irregularities.</p><hr><p>The youngest sister, expert in fighting, and her elder sisters who perfected themselves as idols.</p><p>Unlike Medusa, they liked humans very much.</p><p>They welcomed the men who visited their island, comforted them, and sent them on a new adventure.</p><hr><p>Eternal idols.</p><p>The incarnations of the image of a pure maiden.</p><p>Idealized, never-aging young girls.</p><p>Twin deities in a class entirely different from that of the haughty goddesses with full curves.</p><hr><p>That&#39;s right.</p><p>As goddesses whose purpose was &quot;just to be loved and spoiled,&quot; being &quot;cute&quot; was their specialty.</p><p>The ultimate sisters whose beauty would never be matched even by Medusa&#39;s best efforts, they were the snow-white Gothic Lolita duo.</p><p>For Stheno and Euryale, that was the meaning of their very existence...!</p><hr><p>...Well...</p><p>That&#39;s what the men, observing from afar and oblivious of their true character, said of them.</p><hr><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015The eldest daughter, Stheno.</p><p>A lady with elegant demeanor, overflowing grace, and wisdom in her actions and words.</p><p>A goddess said to be the ideal woman.</p><p>It is said that merely hearing one&#39;s name escape from her lips is enough to make a man lose his senses over the rapturous feeling, and swear eternal loyalty to her.</p><p>However...</p><p>If someone were to ask the youngest sister her opinion on the condition of anonymity, she would say that Stheno was the perfect example of laziness.</p><p>She had not the slightest interest in things she didn&#39;t like. Worse still, this demon-like sister&#39;s cruelty would make the watchdogs of hell tremble in fear.</p><hr><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015The second daughter, Euryale.</p><p>A lady with carefree demeanor, overflowing smile, and the essence of purity in her actions and words.</p><p>A goddess said to be the ideal girl.</p><p>It is said that merely hearing one&#39;s name escape from her lips is enough to make a man tremble all over with honor, and swear to protect her even at the cost of his life.</p><p>However...</p><p>Once again, if one were to ask the opinion of the youngest sister, on the condition of anonymity of course, she would say that Euryale was the ultimate display of mood swings.</p><p>On top of that, she was sly as well, &quot;If you keep quiet, no one will be mad, and if they don&#39;t find out, then there was nothing wrong, hohoho.&quot; and yet, she would feel just a little guilty later. That&#39;s the impish, cowardly second sister.</p><hr><p>Unlike Medusa, they liked humans very much.</p><p>They welcomed the men who visited their island, comforted them, and sent them on a new adventure.</p><hr><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015But even that was a gigantic trap.</p><p>They loved everything pretty and cute, freely and unconditionally.</p><p>Indeed, these two devils did love humans.</p><p>However, what they loved was not humans as the living beings, but rather toying with the people they liked, embarrassing and driving them to their ruin\u2015\u2015\u2015in short, watching them struggle. They loved it more than a three-course meal...!</p><hr><p>\u201CUmmm, Nee-sama. I thought this is the very unsightliness that provokes your unconditional hatred...\u201D</p><p>\u201CI&#39;m shocked. Your tastes are terrible to the point of being incurable, Medusa.</p><p>Now listen here. Pretty things dancing in most uncouth manner... Now that is real beauty.\u201D</p><hr><p>...Hence, many brave men became the sisters&#39; sacrifice.</p><p>The heroes who came seeking to court them were met with impossible demands, and went back to their countries weeping.</p><hr><p>...Alas, the terrifying, devilish three sisters.</p><p>One went to challenge the she-monster Medusa to gain fame, and was petrified.</p><p>Another went to seek the hand of the goddess in marriage, and ended up ridiculed beyond all reason until he met his death.</p><p>Oh brave warriors, if there are men amongst you, they shall do well to leave this place!</p><p>This is the the island at the utmost end of the world; an evil paradise inhabited by women of peerless beauty.</p><p>&quot;That&#39;s right, I won&#39;t say anything bad, just don&#39;t ever get involved with the goddesses.&quot; This is the kind of island that exists to teach you this lesson, you know...?</p><hr><p>And that is the rough summary of the story behind the Temple of Darkness.</p><p>\u201CAh, uh...\u201D</p><p>A peaceful afternoon without any challengers, which was quite rare.</p><p>Part of the daily ritual, Medusa is being picked on by the two elder sisters again.</p><hr><p>\u201CWell, were you trying to run away from <ruby>me<rt>Stheno</rt></ruby>?\u201D</p><p>\u201CHmph, what did you do to <ruby>me<rt>Euryale</rt></ruby>?

Absolutely forbidden.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CEeek...!\u201D</p><p>Her small body dances in the air.</p><p>Which is hardly surprising, given that she is Euryale the Far-Flier.</p><p>The flying goddess leaps towards Medusa&#39;s snow-white neck, grins wide, opens her mouth and bares her fangs.</p><p>And then\u2015\u2015\u2015delivers an evil kiss.</p><hr><p>\u201C..., ah...!\u201D</p><p>A battle-cry that punches through the skin and pierces the blood vessels below.</p><p>\u201Ckh... Ah, yahh...!!\u201D</p><p>The sweet music of smacking lips, dancing tongue and slurping sounds follows.</p><p>\u201CHah\u2015\u2015\u2015ah, aah, ah......!\u201D</p><p>And then, a bloodcurdling scream from Medusa.</p><hr><p>...One wonders what would her acquaintances in the afterworld think if they saw her like this.</p><p>Preying not on individuals but on an entire city, the demon Medusa sucked the blood of hundreds of people in one night; to think that she was being treated the same by this cute little girl...!</p><hr><p>\u201CU-Ugh\uFF5E\uFF5E\uFF5E\uFF5E younger Nee-sama! It hurts, it hurts, and it tickles...!\u201D</p><p>\u201CAhahahaha, how pathetic! It always bothered me how the younger sister ends up looking down on the elder ones!\u201D</p><p>The tall woman trembling in fear, and the cute little girl clinging tightly onto her.</p><hr><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015Perhaps it&#39;s unfair for me to have all the fun.\u201D</p><p>Riding the Pegasus, Stheno licks her lips.</p><p>\u201CEh?\u201D</p><p>\u201C...Don&#39;t move, Medusa. It&#39;ll hurt only if you resist.\u201D</p><p>\u201CAh! Ahhhhh! Elder Nee-sama!?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CAh... hyaa, AAaAAAAH\uFF5E\uFF5E\uFF5E...!\u201D</p><p>Her blood plundered from both sides of her nape, Medusa is entranced, standing stock still.</p><p>Like an endless bout of anemia.</p><p>It is no longer screams that she lets out. The noises now resemble the creaking of some broken mechanism.</p><hr><p>\u201CHaa... Our youngest sister, she...\u201D</p><p>\u201CFuah... So dull and lazy, and yet...\u201D</p><p>\u201CAhhh... So indiscreet, such a blockhead, and yet...\u201D</p><p>\u201C...And yet.\u201D</p><p>\u201CAnd yet...\u201D</p><p>\u201CIs it only her blood which is so sweet\u2015\u2015\u2015!\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CAh...! Haa, haa, p-please forgive me, Onee-sama, ahhhh\uFF5E\uFF5E\uFF5E\uFF5E......!\u201D</p><p>The two sucking sounds weave with each other in melodious harmony, echoing within the temple.</p><p>Part of the daily ritual, the youngest sister is being disciplined by the mean sisters today.</p><hr><p>...It shall be said again...</p><p>That is not a rare occurrence on this island.</p><hr><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015Huh?\u201D</p><p>As I come to, I find myself at the storehouse.</p><p>The sunlight is now considerably lower, has it been a whole hour already...?</p><hr><p>\u201C...? How strange. What have I been doing?\u201D</p><p>I tilt my head.</p><p>\u201CErm... When you and Rider entered the storeroom, I followed behind quietly and... huh?\u201D</p><p>Illya also tilts her head.</p><p>\u201C........................\u201D</p><p>Rider frowns deeply.</p><hr><p>\u201CWhat&#39;s wrong, Rider? You got a headache?</p><p>And what have we been doing all this while?\u201D</p><p>\u201C...Eh? N-No, nothing much.</p><p>...You were just saying that you wished you were a little taller, Shirou.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CAh.\u201D</p><p>I clap my hands together.</p><p>Yeah, we did talk about something like that, didn&#39;t we?</p><p>...However.</p><p>If that&#39;s the case, then what is bike Number Two doing at Rider&#39;s feet...?</p><hr><p>\u201CRider, about the Number Two that&#39;s just laying on the ground...\u201D</p><p>\u201CI do not know about it. Number Two somehow ended up being left here, and it is absolutely none of my concern as to how.</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015<em>Isn&#39;t that right</em>, Shirou?\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015ah\u2015\u2015\u2015t-that&#39;s right, Rider just dropped by here. Number Two was, erm...\u201D</p><p>...Despite my mind still being a bit foggy up to that point, faced with Rider&#39;s glare, I finally conclude there&#39;s nothing else to it.</p><hr><p>\u201CYes. I believe you might have brought it here for repairs.</p><p>...I have no major requests, but as far as maintenance goes, I would ask to have the frame and crank reinforced. The tires are perfectly fine.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CWell then, please excuse me.</p><p>And Illyasviel, I am happy to see you this lively, but high places are not somewhere young girls like you should play in.</p><p>...Therefore, you should never dive down from the second floor of this storehouse.\u201D</p><p>\u201C? You&#39;re so strange. It&#39;s not like I&#39;d ever do that, anyway.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CThat is fine. I am glad to have your understanding, Illya.</p><p>Then I shall see you again at dinner time.\u201D</p><p>Flashing an adult-like smile, Rider leaves the storehouse.</p><p>Fascinated by the back of the cool, adult-like figure, I see her off in a daze\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>\u201C...ghh! ...!\u201D</p><p>The stylish woman hits her head and crouches down in pain.</p><hr><p>\u201CR-Rider?\u201D</p><p>\u201CPlease do not worry... And Shirou, being tall has hardly any benefits at all.\u201D</p><p>Tottering, Rider disappears towards the courtyard.</p><p>...I see.</p><p>Being tall is unexpectedly troublesome, huh...</p><hr><h3 id="emiya-residence\u30FBstart-of-night-things-to-do" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#emiya-residence\u30FBstart-of-night-things-to-do" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Emiya Residence\u30FBStart of Night Things to do</h3><h3 id="emiya-residence\u30FBnight-map-the-things-that-suit-rider" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#emiya-residence\u30FBnight-map-the-things-that-suit-rider" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Emiya Residence\u30FBNight Map The things that suit Rider</h3><hr><p>\u201CHm?\u201D</p><p>As I passed by Rider&#39;s room, I heard voices from inside.</p><hr><p>\u201C......maybe so, then how about this one?\u201D</p><p>\u201CBut...\u201D</p><p>Inside it&#39;s Rider and... Sakura?</p><p>It&#39;s not strange to see them in one another&#39;s rooms, given how friendly their Master and Servant relationship is, but something is different about the enthusiasm in this conversation.</p><hr><p>\u201C......perhaps, but I...\u201D</p><p>\u201CReally now, Rider, how can you still be saying that when you&#39;re...\u201D</p><p>From what I&#39;ve seen, Rider is usually the more assertive of the two, while Sakura is more passive.</p><p>But now, Sakura&#39;s more eager, while Rider sounds hesitant.</p><hr><p>\u201C...Oh. Is that Shirou out there?\u201D</p><p>As expected of Rider, this thin sliding door may as well not even be here.</p><p>Her voice was unusually stiff and formal, maybe she&#39;s feeling a bit self-conscious with Sakura there?</p><hr><p>\u201CYeah. my bad, I heard the two of you talking as I passed by, but didn&#39;t mean to eavesdrop. Sorry, I&#39;ll be on my way now.\u201D</p><p>\u201CAh, perfect timing! Please come in too, Senpai!\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015Sakura!?\u201D</p><p>Sakura calls me into the room.</p><p>...Strangely, Rider seems to be very troubled.</p><hr><p>\u201C? Is it really okay for me to come in?\u201D</p><p>\u201CSakura, um, this is...\u201D</p><p>\u201CI&#39;m sure Senpai will agree with me, so it&#39;s fine, right, Rider?\u201D</p><p>In response, I hear a sigh that is strangely filled with resignation.</p><p>...I feel like it would be bad to intrude, but turning down the invitation would be even worse.</p><hr><p>\u201C...Hm. Then should I make us some tea?\u201D</p><p>\u201CNo, that will not be necessary. The sentiment alone is enough.\u201D</p><p>\u201CThen I&#39;ll go make the tea, Senpai.\u201D</p><hr><p>The door slides open and Sakura steps out.</p><p>She&#39;s smiling brightly, in sharp contrast to Rider who is wearing a grim expression inside the room.</p><hr><p>\u201CBlack tea will be fine, right?\u201D</p><p>\u201CIn that case, there should be some tea cakes in the usual place. Please bring those too.\u201D</p><hr><p>After nodding, Sakura disappears down the hall.</p><p>...Now then, sure enough I&#39;m still worried about whether or not waiting in Rider&#39;s room is a good idea.</p><hr><p>\u201C...Is it alright if I come in, Rider?\u201D</p><p>Rider nods.</p><p>A gloomy welcome... Something seems off, it&#39;s strange to see Rider look so troubled after speaking with Sakura.</p><hr><p>The reason for that soon becomes apparent as I enter the room.</p><p>There are fashion magazines spread open around the cushions that Rider and Sakura were sitting on.</p><p>Rider is seated in the center of them. Like a toad surrounded by mirrors, she looks like she hasn&#39;t slept a wink all night... That was a terrible analogy.</p><hr><p>\u201CIs something wrong with these?\u201D</p><p>I pick one up. The model was a beauty, but frankly speaking, the Rider in front of me was better in terms of raw material.</p><p>However, the purpose of this kind of magazine is probably to look at the clothes instead of the models themselves.</p><hr><p>\u201CIt&#39;s troubling, Shirou.\u201D</p><p>\u201C......It&#39;s rare for you to be troubled by Sakura, Rider.\u201D</p><p>\u201CSakura was just trying to get me to... no... I would not say it is a big deal, but...\u201D</p><hr><p>Rider replies evasively, but somehow I&#39;m able to piece together what happened.</p><p>It was Sakura, not Rider, who brought these magazines. So, it&#39;s only natural to assume things would turn out like this.</p><hr><p>\u201CSakura was...\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015Yeah.\u201D</p><hr><p>I understand what she&#39;s trying to say.</p><p>Sakura brought those magazines and catalogs and probably started asking which outfits suited Rider.</p><p>Of course, she was also looking for which suited herself just as much.</p><p>But, before long, Sakura&#39;s main objective shifted to Rider.</p><hr><p>\u201CThat&#39;s right. Rider would look nice if she dressed a bit more lady-like.\u201D</p><p>...Sakura returned at that moment.</p><p>She hands out the teacups, but Rider sinks into silence like usual.</p><hr><p>\u201CDon&#39;t you think so too, Senpai?\u201D</p><p>\u201C...Well, it&#39;s not that I haven&#39;t thought about it.\u201D</p><p>Sakura is concerned about how Rider dresses.</p><p>I can certainly see why.</p><hr><p>She may look nice dressed in jeans, but certainly I can&#39;t help but think what a waste it is when she has such a nice figure.</p><p>The feeling I get from her is a little different than from Sakura, whose charms are enough to even overwhelm me at times. Rider&#39;s style is also different from those like the tidy Saber and grand Tohsaka.</p><hr><p>\u201CThat&#39;s why, I think wearing cuter clothes like this would suit her.\u201D</p><hr><p>Saying that, Sakura holds out a magazine in front of me.</p><p>...The page shows a skirt wearing figure that makes me think, &quot;Yeah, this model is cute.&quot;</p><hr><p>I visualize Rider wearing this...</p><p>\u201C............\u201D</p><p>The person in front of me that&#39;s being dressed inside my head clearly looks troubled.</p><hr><p>I imagine Rider in this kind of outfit, but at the same time an image of a bewildered Rider being forced into wearing something that didn&#39;t belong on her floats into my mind.</p><hr><p>\u201CBut, Rider doesn&#39;t seem one bit interested. Senpai, what do you think?\u201D</p><p>I think I understand their conversation from earlier now.</p><p>If Rider is this unmotivated, then that talk was probably going nowhere fast.</p><hr><p>\u201C...I see.\u201D</p><p>I also understand why Sakura invited me in to help support her.</p><p>I understand, but...</p><p>\u201CEven if you ask me what I think...\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CBut it looks so fun when Nee-san dresses up Saber-san in all those outfits.\u201D</p><p>\u201CThat&#39;s because she is so cute, unlike me.\u201D</p><hr><p>Rider replies sullenly.</p><p>...&quot;So cute, unlike me.&quot; Sakura and I exchange glances just at hearing the tone of those words.</p><hr><p>\u201CSure, Saber is cute, but aren&#39;t you beautiful as well?\u201D</p><p>\u201CI think Saber-san would look good in this kind of outfit... but something that like doesn&#39;t really suit Rider, I suppose.\u201D</p><hr><p>Sakura shows us a page with a one-piece dress adorned with many frills and ribbons.</p><p>It would look good on Saber, but... it really doesn&#39;t suit someone like Rider.</p><hr><p>\u201C......That&#39;s true. But wouldn&#39;t this look good on her?\u201D</p><p>\u201CAh, you&#39;re right. That&#39;s so nice, it&#39;s kinda cool...\u201D</p><p>Sakura gazes blissfully at a formal black suit displayed on the same page.</p><p>Because Rider is tall and has such well defined limbs, a smart outfit like this really stands out.</p><hr><p>\u201CIf I were to wear this, I would surely look like I was attending a job interview.\u201D</p><p>\u201CIf Rider wore it, she&#39;d look like the skillful secretary of a company director, yeah.\u201D</p><p>Rider is obviously embarrassed.</p><p>As if nearing her limit, she speaks softly while sipping her tea.</p><hr><p>\u201CI am not cute, I cannot do anything about being this tall...\u201D</p><hr><p>......Looks like Rider is really sensitive about that.</p><p>It&#39;s true she really is taller than the average woman, but I don&#39;t think that&#39;s enough to declare herself ugly.</p><hr><p>\u201CThat&#39;s not true, right, Senpai? Rider&#39;s cute, isn&#39;t she?\u201D</p><p>\u201C...Beautiful, cute, you could say either. In any case, there&#39;s no way you can&#39;t say she&#39;s cute.\u201D</p><p>\u201CA huge woman? Like me? Since ancient times tall and strong women have never been called cute.\u201D</p><hr><p>Rider keeps stubbornly denying her cuteness.</p><p>...But, I also think that stubborn way she acts just makes her all the more cuter.</p><p>I&#39;m starting to understand why Sakura had been encouraging Rider to try new types of clothes.</p><hr><p>\u201C......Is that so? I think it would really look good on you though...\u201D</p><p>\u201CIn the first place, I&#39;m fine as long as the size of my clothes fits me. You don&#39;t have to fuss over this so much, Sakura.\u201D</p><hr><p>With this, the conversation is concluded, or so it seemed that Rider was trying to communicate.</p><p>However, both Sakura and I feel like bullying her a little longer, or at least somehow I feel that way.</p><hr><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015Eye contact successful.</p><hr><p>\u201CHey, Senpai? How about coming along with us the next time we go out shopping for Rider&#39;s western-style clothes?\u201D</p><p>\u201CYeah. If you&#39;re fine with me, I&#39;d be delighted.\u201D</p><p>\u201CWha\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><p>Rider gazes in shock as the two of us smoothly reach an agreement.</p><p>While Rider is stunned into silence, Sakura and I keep talking.</p><hr><p>\u201CWhere should we go though? I&#39;m not really familiar with this sort of thing.\u201D</p><p>\u201CAh, there&#39;s many choices at the Verde in Shinto, so let&#39;s go there. Because autumn and winter are already coming up, I want to pick up some other things as well.\u201D</p><p>\u201CNo, that&#39;s, um, I...\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CNaturally, since Rider&#39;s the main star here, we&#39;ll find a cute outfit that Senpai approves of.</p><p>Rider would like that too, <em>right</em>?\u201D</p><hr><p>&quot;<em>Right</em>?&quot; Rider winces at Sakura&#39;s emphasis on that last word, looking as though being cornered in a match.</p><p>And then, she looks at me pleadingly\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>\u201CIsn&#39;t that fine every now and then? Let&#39;s go shopping, the three of us.\u201D</p><p>\u201C........................\u201D</p><p>Checkmate.</p><p>If it&#39;s just Rider and I, she would refuse immediately. But since Sakura&#39;s involved as well, she can&#39;t refuse.</p><hr><p>\u201C...If both of you say that, then it can&#39;t be helped. Though I am inexperienced, please allow me to accompany you.\u201D</p><p>\u201CYay! Senpai, let&#39;s all go together next time!\u201D</p><hr><p>Sakura is overjoyed, while Rider seems to have resigned herself to her fate.</p><p>In any case, it looks like I&#39;ve made a promise to go out with Sakura and Rider.</p><hr><p>...Sorry, Rider.</p><p>But, I want to do this because Sakura is in such high spirits, so it doesn&#39;t really feel like I&#39;m forcing Rider to do something unpleasant.</p><hr><p>\u201CWow, but I have a heavy responsibility... I have to choose something cute that will suit Rider.\u201D</p><p>\u201CIt&#39;s all right. Rider will look good in anything. I&#39;m even envious of her.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C...You may say that, Sakura, but aren&#39;t you far more attractive? I guarantee that.</p><p>I have no doubt Shirou thinks that way as well.\u201D</p><p>\u201CEh......??\u201D</p><hr><p>Sakura is thrown off by Rider&#39;s words.</p><p>\u2015\u2015Isn&#39;t changing the topic like that foul play? It seems like Sakura is angry with me.</p><hr><p>\u201CI-It&#39;s not anything like that, right, Senpai!?\u201D</p><p>\u201CN-No that&#39;s not it, I mean, Sakura is... um...\u201D</p><p>\u201CFuhuhu......\u201D</p><p>Rider was toyed with till the last minute, but it seems she&#39;s recovered a bit of her mood now.</p><p>Picking out clothes for Rider, huh...?</p><p>I&#39;m not really suited for that kind of thing, but I am interested in the results.</p><hr><p>\u201CWell then, let&#39;s drink the tea Sakura put so much effort into before it cools down.\u201D</p><p>\u201CG-Geez, the two of you...\u201D</p><hr><h2 id="day-4" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#day-4" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Day 4</h2><h3 id="streets\u30FBday-4-border" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#streets\u30FBday-4-border" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Streets\u30FBDay 4 Border</h3><hr><p>As I cross the pedestrian bridge, I see something that grabs my attention.</p><p>\u201CHey, isn&#39;t that Saegusa, from Tohsaka&#39;s class...?\u201D</p><p>From the way she&#39;s walking in tiny steps that are almost hops, she has to be Saegusa.</p><p>We haven&#39;t made eye contact, and ordinarily it wouldn&#39;t be strange for us to pass each other by like this, but...</p><hr><p>\u201CI&#39;m surprised. Yukika, you go to Homurabara? I thought you were younger.\u201D</p><p>\u201CYeah, that&#39;s true. I&#39;m sorry, Gil-kun. I&#39;m really much older.\u201D</p><p>\u201CAh... no, I&#39;m the one who should apologize. That was quite rude of me. A guy who would do something so rude as asking a woman her age has no right to call himself a man.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CAh, but I&#39;m also a little glad. Rather than viewing you as just a friend, I can now call you &quot;Onee-san.&quot;\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CHehe, thanks. I wish my little brothers were as sweet and polite as you, Gil-kun. They&#39;re all so naughty.\u201D</p><p>\u201CHaha, you&#39;re certainly right about Kouta and the others being too energetic.</p><p>Running around wildly day in and day out, never heeding the trouble they might get into. It must be tough for you, Yukika.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CIt is! Gil-kun, if you see my brothers doing anything they shouldn&#39;t, please try to stop them for me.</p><p>They don&#39;t listen to anything I tell them, but I think they would if it were Gil-kun saying it. They really look up to you, you know.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CThat&#39;s not true! They do listen to you, Yukika.</p><p>You don&#39;t need to worry about them. Your brothers would never do anything to make you sad, Yukika, even if I&#39;m not there to watch them.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C...Well, it would indeed be a problem if they were trying to upset you on purpose. In that case, I would be sure to scold them for you.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C...Well, this seems perfectly peaceful... but what is that guy doing with Saegusa...?\u201D</p><p>I hide behind a bench and continue observing them.</p><p>That blond boy is unmistakably Gilgamesh.</p><p>Better known as Gil, the charismatic kid who&#39;s lately become a Godfather to the brat mafia of Miyama kids.</p><hr><p>\u201CBy the way, Yukika, don&#39;t you have track and field practice today? Does that mean you&#39;re free this afternoon?\u201D</p><p>\u201CYes, completely free. I finished all the laundry this morning, so I can relax until dinnertime.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201COh, so you came here for a walk in the park.</p><p>I&#39;m so glad. Sometimes I come to the park to get away from trouble at home, and wait for things to blow over. But it looks like my luck has changed today.\u201D</p><p>\u201C? Um... Gil-kun, you don&#39;t get along with your mother, or...?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201COh, didn&#39;t Kouta tell you? ...It&#39;s not my mom, I live with my guardian. She&#39;s really moody, and gets mad at me over the slightest thing. Like the polar opposite of you, Yukika.</p><p>No, even comparing you to her is inexcusable. Really, she&#39;s just the person who&#39;s in charge of my house. I like you best, Yukika.</p><p>Seriously, if I&#39;ve got to have a guardian no matter what, I&#39;d much rather you were my Master, Yukika.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CEh... master...? No, umm, that&#39;s, eh...\u201D</p><p>\u201CYeah, a person I like. Didn&#39;t I tell you? I like to see you as an older sister much more than just a friend.</p><p>How about it, Yukika? Have you ever been with a younger boy before?\u201D</p><p>\u201CEh, um, Gil-kun, eh...!?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CYou bastard...! So this is where your true colors come out...!\u201D</p><p>That &quot;I&#39;m a good little boy&quot; routine was all an act, just as I thought!</p><p>At this rate, the rabbit-like Saegusa will be gobbled up...!</p><hr><p>\u201CStop right theeeeere!

I, umm, I, umm... I-I-I just remember&#39;d I&#39;ve gotta go do something, so, see you...!\u201D</p><p>Whoosh! She runs away with the speed of a wild rabbit.</p><p>She was so startled that I begin to feel bad about what I did.</p><hr><p>\u201C...Good grief. Me, a sex fiend? You&#39;re the last person I want to hear that from, Onii-san.\u201D</p><p>\u201CAm I wrong? I saw you putting the moves on Saegusa.</p><p>I don&#39;t know what game you think this is, but she&#39;s not the kind of person you&#39;re allowed to play around with so casually.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CHow rude. I truly like Yukika.\u201D</p><p>\u201CLiar! ...No, wait, doubting your sincerity there would be pretty rude.</p><p>So... are you, like, serious about her?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CI spoke the truth. A woman like Yukika would be an ideal life partner.\u201D</p><p>...Guh.</p><p>He says such an embarrassing thing so boldly that I begin to feel embarrassed for doubting him.</p><hr><p>\u201CW-Well, then I&#39;m sorry for thinking you were playing around with her feelings.</p><p>...Still, this sure is a strange turn of events.</p><p>What happened to you being into Saber?\u201D</p><p>\u201CSaber-san is the sun. I have no interest in that.</p><p>Perhaps she might make a useful vassal, but she is unsuitable to be a lifelong partner.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C...You&#39;re saying something truly ominous.</p><p>So, in short, you like Saegusa for her home-oriented qualities, or her broad-mindedness?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CAhaha, that&#39;s not it, Onii-san. Rather than being broadminded, Yukika is the sort of person who requires the protection of others.</p><p>A wildflower is more precious to me than the most vibrant rose. A simple flower, by its very simplicity, makes me wish to protect it to the full extent of my power. This is what broad-mindedness is to a man.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><p>I&#39;m speechless.</p><p>In short, he just said that Saegusa&#39;s lack of other redeeming features is what makes her special. What kind of talk is that coming from a brat like him?</p><p>...What should I do about this? He&#39;s the kind of guy you might really find yourself coming to like\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>\u201CSo basically, instead of ruling over the person you like, you express your love by nurturing and looking after them?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CThe only type of person one can rule over is one who wishes to be ruled over. Unfortunately, it seems that I forget this once I grow older. If I had a choice, I would&#39;ve liked to become a good leader.</p><p>...Why is it that other rulers attempt to rule through fear instead when the right path is so simply trod?\u201D</p><hr><p>Wow...</p><p>For the good of the all the people in the world, this king should stay as a child. Definitely. No doubt about it.</p><hr><p>\u201CAh. Wait, then what happens if the person you&#39;ve cared for doesn&#39;t turn out the way you&#39;d like?</p><p>Looking after someone means that you won&#39;t force anything on them, right?</p><p>What if that person ends up turning into somebody like, uh, that Master you&#39;re so eager to avoid?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CIf that should happen, I would simply discard them. It would mean that we were not fated to be together in that way.\u201D</p><p>\u201C..................\u201D</p><p>I take back the previous statement. This guy hasn&#39;t changed one bit.</p><p>That callousness is a part of his very nature that nobody can ever hope to change.</p><hr><p>\u201C...Huh. So, if Saegusa were to become more like Tohsaka, you&#39;d grow to love her less?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CMy love will not lessen. It is simply that it will grow no more. It would become something eternal and unchanging. It will not flourish, but neither will it die.</p><p>Love, once it has appeared, can never be erased. It&#39;s not true what they say about excessive love becoming hatred.</p><p>It&#39;s simply that a newly born hatred has surpassed the love cultivated up until that point.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><p>So, for example...</p><p>A boy who currently believes in both the good and evil of humanity,</p><p>one day is overcome by such hatred so as to render that love worthless to him.</p><hr><p>\u201CWell, there are cases like that.</p><p>No matter how far the man strays from human morality, problematically he still has love. And this appears <ruby>human<rt>familiar</rt></ruby> to people, so in the end he is hated as a human.</p><p>If only he had just been entirely inhuman to begin with, he would&#39;ve been designated a god instead.\u201D</p><hr><p>Bidding me farewell, the blond child turns on his heels.</p><p>He isn&#39;t heading in the direction that Saegusa ran off to, but rather towards the bridge into Shinto.</p><hr><p>\u201CHey. You&#39;re not going to go after Saegusa?\u201D</p><p>\u201CThere is no need. My business with her is finished. Yukika cares strongly for her brothers, so she could be staying out until late at night trying to find them and bring them home.</p><p>That&#39;s very dangerous, isn&#39;t it? After all, tonight is the fourth night, and this bridge at night is a very dangerous place to be, so... just in case.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CBut thanks to you, Onii-san, Yukika&#39;s already gone home, and will not return here until tomorrow.</p><p>A bit of a shame, but still a tolerable resolution of the situation.\u201D</p><hr><p>And with a perfectly unperturbed smile on his face, the King of Heroes departs.</p><p>\u201C..................\u201D</p><p>...Suddenly, I feel unnecessarily sentimental.</p><p>Although he seems to be as capricious as ever in the face of this irregularity...</p><p>Maybe he&#39;s finding just as much to treasure in these carefree days as the rest of us.</p><hr><h3 id="streets\u30FBday-4-anachro-analog-rin" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#streets\u30FBday-4-anachro-analog-rin" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Streets\u30FBDay 4 Anachro-analog Rin</h3><hr><p>\u201CLet&#39;s take a look around here.\u201D</p><p>I stop at the electronics store.</p><p>On a whim, I find myself wanting to check out the latest appliances.</p><hr><p>\u201CHmmm... they&#39;re getting bigger and thinner all the time.\u201D</p><p>A television with a particularly large screen catches my attention.</p><p>One of these in our house... would feel awfully out of place, wouldn&#39;t it.</p><p>It&#39;s true that we have a lot of people, but none of them are big TV watchers.</p><hr><p>\u201CThere&#39;s an even bigger problem than it being out of place, though... I won&#39;t be able to get inside one of these.\u201D</p><p>TVs being high-voltage appliances, picking a broken one up to fix myself is just too dangerous.</p><p>This is the one time I can&#39;t get away with buying used...</p><hr><p>\u201CAh, and speaking of new stuff, we could use one of these as well.\u201D</p><p>The VCR we have right now is so outdated it&#39;s practically a historic artifact.</p><p>It&#39;s not as though we&#39;ve ever had need of one so far, but I&#39;d like to get a DVD recorder to poke around inside too.</p><hr><p>\u201COh, if it isn&#39;t Emiya-kun. What are you doing around here?\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015Hey Tohsaka. What the heck brings you here?\u201D</p><p>An electronics store is the last place where I&#39;d expect to run into this girl.</p><p>...If it were an antique furniture store or something, that would be more understandable, somehow.</p><hr><p>\u201CHuh, so you&#39;re thinking of upgrading too, Tohsaka?\u201D</p><p>\u201C? What are you talking about? I happened to see you over here, so I called out to you, that&#39;s all.\u201D</p><p>\u201CReally? Yeah, I guess so...\u201D</p><p>...Of the products for sale here, anything more complicated than a vacuum cleaner seems like it would be way out of Tohsaka&#39;s range.</p><p>I seem to recall that I know someone who&#39;s unable to use any device with more than ten buttons on it. By the way, that someone is Tohsaka.</p><hr><p>\u201C...Emiya-kun, you&#39;re not thinking any rude comments just now, are you?\u201D</p><p>\u201CMaybe, just a bit. C&#39;mon, Tohsaka, everyone knows that you&#39;re...\u201D</p><p>\u201C...&quot;Hopeless with machines&quot;... is that what you were about to say?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CNot hopeless, exactly, but more like you just don&#39;t use them much in the first place.</p><p>In fact, you go so far out of your way to avoid them that it&#39;s almost like you&#39;re allergic. When it comes to machines, Sakura\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><p>Ah... she&#39;s mad.</p><p>That&#39;s just how humans are. You don&#39;t know if speaking the truth to someone will result in joy or anger.</p><hr><p>\u201CFufufu\u2015\u2015\u2015so that&#39;s how you see me, Shirou?\u201D</p><p>\u201CWhat does it matter? You&#39;re able to handle pretty much anything else with ease. A single flaw like that is nothing to sneeze at.\u201D</p><p>...Actually, speaking of fatal flaws, she&#39;s got another glaring one that comes to mind, but I don&#39;t dare speak it out loud.</p><hr><p>\u201C...I suppose I should thank you for that.</p><p>But having not a single weakness is my family&#39;s ideal... I can&#39;t just go &quot;oh, I&#39;m no good with these things&quot; and avoid them forever.\u201D</p><p>\u201CI see. So having resolved that, you came here today in pursuit of knowledge, is that it?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CUh... W-We can talk about that later.</p><p>I came here for a look after speaking with Ayako. I figured I&#39;d better start by getting familiar with the cutting-edge models.\u201D</p><p>\u201CAhhh, Mitsuzuri would definitely know a lot more about home electronics than me.\u201D</p><hr><p>She used to be the captain of the archery team, and she certainly has the air of a martial artist about her, but contrary to that old-fashioned image, Mitsuzuri does keep up to date with the latest in game centers and such.</p><p>That the subject of the conversation fails to turn to &quot;Emiya doesn&#39;t do that though&quot; is somewhat annoying.</p><p>According to archery club members, she can spend all night long playing simple repetitive games.</p><hr><p>\u201CSo you came here to study up before your lesson with Mitsuzuri, huh?\u201D</p><p>\u201CW-Well, something like that. I wouldn&#39;t like it if people started seeing me as an anachronistic or antique type of woman, after all.</p><p>Umm... it&#39;s not as though I&#39;m living in the nineteenth century, and I&#39;m no Luddite, you know? Hey, that thing over there, that&#39;s an LCD screen, right?\u201D</p><hr><p>What Tohsaka is pointing to is the very same big-screen liquid crystal TV I was looking at before.</p><p>Good going, Tohsaka! You sure got that one right. I wonder if she figured that out based on how thin it is.</p><p>...&quot;So, do you know the difference between plasma and LCD then?&quot; ...A question like that would likely stop her in her tracks, so I opt to keep my mouth shut.</p><hr><p>\u201CI saw you looking at it before, Emiya. Are you thinking of getting it?\u201D</p><p>\u201CI was thinking it would be nice to have one, but a purchase like that would have my wallet hurting for months. Besides, it doesn&#39;t really match the atmosphere of the house.\u201D</p><p>\u201CSame with mine... wait, these things cost HOW much!?</p><p>You could buy a twenty-carat ruby for less than that!\u201D</p><p>One look at the price tag makes Tohsaka go pale.</p><p>Having gemstones as her basis of comparison\u2015\u2015\u2015seems awfully luxurious. In my case, I&#39;d wonder how many months&#39; worth of our food budget it would take.</p><hr><p>\u201CYeah, that&#39;s a little too rich for our blood, huh?\u201D</p><p>\u201CI&#39;m not especially dissatisfied with the small screen of the TV at home, either.\u201D</p><p>\u201CAnd that over there is a VCR, right?\u201D</p><p>Tohsaka is now pointing to\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>\u201CBzzzzzt. Too bad.\u201D</p><p>\u201CNo way, aren&#39;t all video thingies shaped like that?\u201D</p><p>\u201CNot the one you&#39;re pointing at.</p><p>That&#39;s an ordinary DVD player. It doesn&#39;t have a record function.\u201D</p><p>I lead Tohsaka over to the recording equipment section, and taking a look around... ah, I don&#39;t blame her for being confused by all this.</p><hr><p>\u201C...What are you talking about?\u201D</p><p>\u201CThis one&#39;s a standard player, over here is an HDD+DVD-RW model, this one is HDD+DVD-RAM, next to it is an HDD-only recording unit, and over there is a CS digital...\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C........................\u201D</p><p>In the midst of my explanation, I gradually realize that Tohsaka is glaring at me with enmity.</p><p>The gulf between Tohsaka and I when it comes to the subject of magical knowledge, on one hand, and modern technical knowledge, on the other, is particularly apparent right now\u2015\u2015\u2015and the longer Tohsaka stands here in this electronics store, the further away she somehow seems to be moving from the world.</p><hr><p>\u201CUmm, what kind of spells are those?\u201D</p><p>\u201CConfusing, isn&#39;t it? It almost sounds like a spell to me, too. And that&#39;s before you consider these Blu-ray and HD-DVD things everyone is talking about.\u201D</p><p>\u201CRay of blue what? So where are the video thingies\u2015\u2015\u2015?\u201D</p><p>\u201CBack there. There&#39;s still a demand for those even now.\u201D</p><p>You should be able to tell one by a single glance, I think, which may be a bit harsh.</p><p>It&#39;s like you take your eyes off them for a moment and suddenly they multiply... makes me nostalgic for the golden age of VHS from my childhood.</p><hr><p>\u201C...So this thing, it&#39;s for recording TV programs?\u201D</p><p>\u201CThat isn&#39;t all it does, but yes.</p><p>Tohsaka, I bet you still believe that you could have your soul stolen if someone took your picture with a camera\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><p>\u201COf course.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CEh\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015?\u201D</p><p>\u201CWith certain modifications to the lens and the photographic paper, it&#39;s entirely possible to do that. ...Although it really only freezes it temporarily rather than stealing it.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CEven if it was a digicam?\u201D</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;A what-clam?&quot; Tosaka murmurs.</p><p>Realizing that she doesn&#39;t even know what &quot;digicam&quot; stands for leaves me incapable of delivering a witty comeback.</p><hr><p>\u201C...Also, what is a... dee-vee-dee?\u201D</p><p>\u201CDigital Versatile Disc, or DVD for short.\u201D</p><p>\u201C...What&#39;s the difference between RAM and RW?\u201D</p><p>...Uh, uhhh, uhhhhhhh...</p><p>Even though I was speaking so knowledgeably to her about this stuff, that one might be beyond me... I doubt I could clearly explain the difference between the two.</p><p>It seems that some people can get worked up into a nearly religious fervor over the finer points of these things, but having never really used either, it&#39;s outside the realm of my understanding.</p><hr><p>\u201C...I&#39;m sorry, but I don&#39;t really know.\u201D</p><p>\u201CThere you have it.</p><p>If it&#39;s this confusing for you, Shirou, then how can I possibly hope to understand it? From my perspective, modern things like these really aren&#39;t far removed from magic.\u201D</p><p>Come to think of it, I know there was some guy who once said that sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from sorcery.</p><hr><p>\u201C...Come on, Tohsaka, it&#39;s nothing to get so disappointed about. Humans have managed to survive this long without DVDs, haven&#39;t they?\u201D</p><p>\u201CYou could just as easily say the same of phones or TVs, though, so that doesn&#39;t really solve anything, does it? Honestly. I&#39;m sure that you and Ayako must be constantly snickering behind my back at how hopelessly behind the times I am\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><p>I can definitely imagine Mitsuzuri laughingly saying something like &quot;you&#39;re completely analog!&quot; to her.</p><p>...And it&#39;s not as though you could just shoot back with &quot;that&#39;s because I&#39;m a magus, after all,&quot; no matter how much you might want to.</p><hr><p>\u201CSo, are you buying one of these too, Shirou?\u201D</p><p>\u201CI suppose I&#39;d better, before the war over the TV channel at our house gets any worse... still, they aren&#39;t exactly cheap.\u201D</p><p>\u201CYou&#39;ve got quite a large family to provide for over there these days, don&#39;t you...? Though I guess that includes me as well.\u201D</p><p>Tohsaka gives a little laugh, as though she&#39;s only just realized that she, too, is among those people.</p><hr><p>\u201CEh, it&#39;s not like we&#39;re running out of room. We could even take in two or three more, frankly.\u201D</p><p>\u201C...You sure seem like you&#39;d do well running a boarding house or a bed and breakfast at this rate, Emiya-kun.\u201D</p><p>She said &quot;would,&quot; but that&#39;s pretty much what I&#39;m doing already.</p><p>At any rate, when the time comes that I&#39;m able to strike out alone as a magus... how will my life change from the way it is now?</p><hr><p>\u201CA life like that doesn&#39;t sound so bad to me.\u201D</p><p>\u201CI&#39;m not about to give you time to seclude yourself from the world or anything, so rest easy.</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015Well then. There&#39;s no reason for us to hang around here, so let&#39;s go somewhere else.\u201D</p><p>Tohsaka seems to have unilaterally decided that I&#39;ll accompany her for today.</p><p>Fine with me, although I can tell I&#39;m in for a hard time later.</p><p>She didn&#39;t get even halfway through with her so-called study of electronics, did she...?</p><hr><h3 id="emiya-residence\u30FBstart-of-night-things-to-do-1" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#emiya-residence\u30FBstart-of-night-things-to-do-1" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Emiya Residence\u30FBStart of Night Things to do</h3><h3 id="emiya-residence\u30FBnight-map-monster" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#emiya-residence\u30FBnight-map-monster" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Emiya Residence\u30FBNight Map monster</h3><h3 id="emiya-residence\u30FBnight-map-not" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#emiya-residence\u30FBnight-map-not" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Emiya Residence\u30FBNight Map not</h3><hr><p>Violet snakes lap up the blood.</p><p>3 am.</p><p>Tonight, another one-sided slaughter has begun.</p><hr><p>As always, the stage is empty.
