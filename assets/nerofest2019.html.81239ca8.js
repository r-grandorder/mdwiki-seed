Testing, testing.<br> Okay, everything&#39;s fine. All right, here we go.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> A festival is...</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> A party that brings joy to all people,<br> no matter where or when they are from.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> It is no exaggeration to call this festival I host famed throughout both Rome and Chaldea!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> She started her speech already!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Hear, hear!</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Umu. Thanks for your cheers. My audience truly knows how to behave the third time around!</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> And that makes introductions unnecessary.<br> Let&#39;s get down to business!</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> I will leave nitpicking about the definition of a festival to the more cultured Servants.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> My glorious Nero Fest, a festival only possible through the cooperation of Rome and Chaldea!</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Now it begins again!</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Surely many Heroic Spirits look forward to this martial tournament set in this great Colosseum.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> A festival of power, modeled after the festival of Olympia! Attendees will praise the warriors&#39; courage!</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Honed physiques and unparalleled skills in fierce competition! What could be more beautiful, more noble!?</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> As people love to admire a blooming rose, so too do they enjoy seeing a human being reach their very limit!</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> And that is itself my Rome...the festival of Olympia!</p><p><strong>E\uFF1ACrowd:</strong><br> Rome! Rome! Rome!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Rome!</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Umu! All of humanity is indeed Rome!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> All hail the Emperor!</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Hehehe. Your applause is making me blush.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> But, as emperor, I shall permit it!<br> Enjoy this glorious festival!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> Hola, \xBFc\xF3mo est\xE1s? I heard that there&#39;s going to be Lucha Libre at the Arena M\xE9xico, yes!?</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> Hehehe, I cannot wait, no!<br> This will be the perfect time to test out my new plancha!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> Master, my cute [\u2642 hermanito /\u2640 hermanita].<br> Why not participate as a [\u2642 luchadore /\u2640 luchadora]?</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong><br> Haha. Not a bad idea!<br> Training Master once in a while wouldn&#39;t hurt!</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong><br> ...Hey, I&#39;m only kidding.<br> Don&#39;t look at me like that, Master.</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong><br> Only those who truly WANT to slug it out should participate. Like me or this tall lady here.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> Hnnn, no, no. You make it sound so barbaric, yes.<br> Lucha is a clash of honed out skills.</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong><br> Ah, you got me there. Well, you know, there&#39;s all kindsa ways to say the same thing.</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong><br> There are some punches used in Lucha Libre, right? They call it, uh, \u201Cgolpe,\u201D or \u201Cpatada,\u201D or something?</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong><br> Besides, this is all between Servants!<br> Even if I really cut loose, nothing bad would happen!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> ...Ay yi yi.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> You have yet to understand the true essence of Lucha.<br> I shall demonstrate it for you myself, yes!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> It&#39;s finally time for the long-awaited Servant Lucha Libre tournament. The sacred site for Lucha, the Arena M\xE9xico, has been rented out.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> This is the perfect chance to spread the wonderful word of Lucha to everyone!</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong><br> Lucha, eh? From what I hear, the flow of the match is predetermined, and the proper protocol is to take whatever move comes head on.</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong><br> Truly it would take a steely spirit that relies on sheer trust of your opponent. Uh, but you know, Quetzalcoatl...</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong><br> If you have the battle go by your own bare-knuckle rules, none of the Good-aligned Heroic Spirits would be a match against you.</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong><br> Besides, this isn&#39;t a Lucha tournament,<br> and this isn&#39;t the Arena M\xE9xico.</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong><br> And...the Colosseum is not in Mexico City.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> Qu\xE9!?!?!?</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> Lalalala! Not listening!<br> Fergus, you meanie, yes!</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong><br> You bastard! I was just going along with what the goddess was saying, then you sweep in to ruin it all! You&#39;re spoiling all the fun!</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong><br> We&#39;re gonna end up slugging it out with our bare hands anyway, so might as well call it Lucha, jackass!</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong><br> You say that... And I suppose it is only right for a warrior to answer the call of Lucha.</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong><br> Lamentably, I am no more than an amateur when it comes to Lucha. The only finishing hold I know is Tirabuz\xF3n.</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong><br> Tirabuz\xF3n, the Cobra Twist!?<br> Old man, you&#39;re totally a Lucha enthusiast!</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong><br> Hahaha!!!<br> Miss Quetzal has challenged me a few times already!</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong><br> Many times, in truth!</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong><br> Oh come now, tell the truth. When you say she&#39;s challenged you, what you really mean is that you practiced Lucha in the simulator.</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong><br> Ah yes. In the simulator room with nobody around at night...a Lucha Libre in the dark!</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong><br> Shut up!</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong><br> Three matches in just one hour!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> Ah-ha! I knew it, yes! I hear true Lucha matches do happen mostly at night, yes!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> So during the day...the Roman Pankration! And at night...a carnival of Lucha where the air is filled with bulging muscles flying about!</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong><br> Uh, that&#39;s not what I meant...<br> Damn, you&#39;re just making things even worse, old man!</p><p><strong>Fran:</strong><br> Uuuurrrr...</p><p><strong>Fran:</strong><br> Try...best...<br> (Makes fist)</p><p><strong>Babbage:</strong><br> Wonderful, my dear! What intensity you have. Your passion and heat are like a steam engine on the verge of critical pressure.</p><p><strong>Babbage:</strong><br> And so I have no choice but to aid you in your efforts. That&#39;s right...consider it a continuation of the dream we both shared this summer.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong><br> Hmmm, it would seem you&#39;ve beaten me to the punch.<br> I do, however, share your sentiments, Babbage.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong><br> My lovely daughter is so very excited. As her papa, I could do no less than to aid her in her quest for victory with all my strength!</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong><br> Yes...that is the duty of a proper papa!</p><p><strong>Fran:</strong><br> (Stare)</p><p><strong>Fran:</strong><br> Nnnngh... Nnnnnggghhh...</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong><br> ...Yes, of course, my lovely daughter.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong><br> I shall, using every conceivable means, with every imaginable trap, employing every possible act of villainy, dispose of all your competition!</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong><br> I had meant to relax awhile, but perhaps this is a good time to truly apply myself.</p><p><strong>Fran:</strong><br> Uuuuuurrr!</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong><br> Ah, yes, quite right. No cheating, of course! As such, papa will fire his magical bullets from the front line!</p><p><strong>Babbage:</strong><br> Steam power at full throttle, steam power at full throttle. We shall aid the daughter of Victor on her path to glorious and dazzling victory!</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> ...C&#39;mon. You call yourself an Assassin?<br> Shouldn&#39;t you be good at spying and scouting?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> Why is finding some missing people taking so long!? You should be able to pick out which ones are NPCs and which ones are Servants!</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong><br> S-sorry.<br> I...actually don&#39;t have skills for that sort of thing...</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong><br> The best I can do is to conceal myself within a crowd.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> You lack PRESENCE!<br> Just hurry up and find Fran, you shut-in.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> I&#39;ve got this sinking feeling\u2013err, well actually,<br> I have a feeling something exciting&#39;s about to happen.</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong><br> Yes, yes. Strange. She was with me just a minute ago.</p><p><strong>Berserker of El Dorado:</strong><br> ...There&#39;s some kind of commotion.</p><p><strong>Berserker of El Dorado:</strong><br> I heard something regarding a festival of combat prowess, but that it was intended solely for amusement. I see no point in participating in such a thing.</p><p><strong>Berserker of El Dorado:</strong><br> What point or purpose is there in such restraint?<br> What I yearn for is true and earnest combat.</p><p><strong>Berserker of El Dorado:</strong><br> That is all.<br> There was no purpose in summoning me here, Caligula.</p><p><strong>Caligula:</strong><br> I do not...wish...for bloodshed...</p><p><strong>Caligula:</strong><br> Nor...do I desire...battle...</p><p><strong>Caligula:</strong><br> Only...Nero...my love and hope...for her sake...I shall...</p><p><strong>Caligula:</strong><br> GATHER MEDALS!!!</p><p><strong>Berserker of El Dorado:</strong><br> M-medals!? What!?</p><p><strong>Caligula:</strong><br> Ooohhhhhhhhh!!!</p><p><strong>Berserker of El Dorado:</strong><br> Wh-what is the meaning of this!?<br> Calm yourself, Emperor Caligula!</p><p><strong>Caligula:</strong><br> MEDALS...WANT!!!</p><p><strong>Berserker of El Dorado:</strong><br> ...!!!</p><p><strong>Berserker of El Dorado:</strong><br> ...I see. So that is it.</p><p><strong>Berserker of El Dorado:</strong><br> While I remain uninterested in trivial diversions, the fact remains that I manifested in Chaldea as a Berserker, like you.</p><p><strong>Berserker of El Dorado:</strong><br> I also harbor a flame that I cannot seem to extinguish. Yes...it burns within me...</p><p><strong>Berserker of El Dorado:</strong><br> Fine, Caligula.<br> Then I shall aid you temporarily!</p><p><strong>Caligula:</strong><br> Oooooooooooohhhhhh!!!</p><p><strong>Berserker of El Dorado:</strong><br> Your fearsome temperament has impressed me.<br> You may yet keep up with my strength!</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> Hmmmm. Two Berserkers interacting with each other... Makin&#39; me kinda jelly.</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> A tournament with the silver-haired sporty-spice Berserker! The ferocious lion within me...okay, well, maybe it&#39;s not a lion...</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> Maybe a killer whale or a shark.<br> Well, let&#39;s just say a carnivore is about to awaken!</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> That physique, glistening with sweat from battle! And that iron ball that looks like a sea urchin! Hrnnngh! I&#39;d definitely be a goner if that hits me!</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> ...So. You&#39;re okay with what happened?</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong><br> Well, there&#39;s no point in this old man intervening.</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong><br> She said she wasn&#39;t interested in \u201Ctrivial diversions.\u201D And yet she&#39;s getting all fired up for this event. Things are just getting more complicated, is all.</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong><br> It&#39;s not as if we are strangers, and I would recommend that she calm down. But then again...</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong><br> She&#39;s really not the type to listen to anyone past a certain point. I just pray no one does anything stupid.</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> I see. Does that mean you&#39;ll be with me to...</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> ...Watch the tournament. Carefully record it. Admire the beauties who move so beautifully around the tournament stage...</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong><br> The only thing we agree on is that we both hope to get through this event without having to fight, Captain. Of course, if a storm is brewing, it won&#39;t matter whether we&#39;re audience members or not.</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong><br> I like playing outside, but hitting each other isn&#39;t a good game for girls.</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong><br> Playing tag or hide-and-go-seek would have been better. Oh, this event is more for boys.</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong><br> You think so?<br> We like dismembering!</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong><br> But if you don&#39;t like it, Nursery, then we don&#39;t either.<br> It&#39;s not fun if we can&#39;t play together.</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong><br> Teehee. Thank you.<br> Do you agree too, Ibaraki-Douji?</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Um...unnngh. W-well, normally I reeeally try to enjoy smashing, tearing, and pillaging as an oni should...</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> But I&#39;m with Jack on this one. If Nursery Rhyme doesn&#39;t like it, then I won&#39;t force it on you.</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> So what should we play?<br> House is fun, so is ball...but I want some excitement...</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong><br> I know.<br> Let&#39;s ask the other kid!</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong><br> Other kid?</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Hm? Who&#39;s that?</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Could it be!?</p><p><strong>Assassin of the Nightless City:</strong><br> ...Kuhaha. I didn&#39;t expect you to see through my Presence Concealment! You guys are good!</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong><br> I don&#39;t think you tried too hard to hide.<br> I kept seeing your pretty dress flapping.</p><p><strong>Assassin of the Nightless City:</strong><br> Indeed. My overwhelming beauty just cannot be hidden!<br> You are a wise Caster, you know that?</p><p><strong>Assassin of the Nightless City:</strong><br> I shall praise you.<br> And you shall be rewarded.</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong><br> Wow, a reward? What is it?</p><p><strong>Assassin of the Nightless City:</strong><br> My prized torture device! It&#39;s a cute fruit-shaped torturing tool! I just so happen to have three or four of them lying around, so you can have one!</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> G-giving a torture device as a reward is...a little weird...and it&#39;s shaped like fruit...fruit...?</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong><br> Uh, we might have SOME interest in it. Maybe.<br> Is it cute?</p><p><strong>Assassin of the Nightless City:</strong><br> Of course it is!</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong><br> I do love a good scary story, but being given a tool for torture is...well, you know...</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong><br> ...It makes me feel a little like...a dragon...you know?</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Ah-choo!</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Oh my. Hehehe. The children are all running about the halls so energetically.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Seeing them like this brings back memories of my own little Kintoki when he was young...</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Oh yes. And I can only imagine Master was a cute little child too. Heehee.</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong><br> It sounded as if those children were talking about torture or something... Well, I suppose I can let that slide.</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong><br> I&#39;m just glad to see children so happy.<br> Children...children...</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong><br> There seems to have been quite the increase in the number of children around here. Well not exactly, since they&#39;re actually Servants...</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> Yeah. Maybe it&#39;s time we thought of adding kids&#39; meals to the menu...</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> We do have something like that for young Servants who can&#39;t eat full portions, but that&#39;s not much fun.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> A dish beloved by many, yet both popular and easy to eat... I&#39;ve been avoiding it this whole time because it&#39;s so easy...</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> But maybe it&#39;s time to offer the forbidden mild-flavored curry?</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong><br> I like it!<br> Good idea!</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong><br> ...But we&#39;re going to be slammed during Nero Fest. Do we really have the time to be adding new dishes to the menu right now?</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> We&#39;ll cross that bridge when we come to it. Besides, we have more Servants to help in the kitchen now.</p><p><strong>Tamamo Cat:</strong><br> Say no more.<br> When you think of curry, you think...hurry for curry!</p><p><strong>Tamamo Cat:</strong><br> Which means, we need someone who&#39;s speedy in the kitchen! This cat knows just the one to fit that bill!</p><p><strong>Tamamo Cat:</strong><br> A man who&#39;s only effective when the sun is in the sky!</p><p><strong>Tamamo Cat:</strong><br> That would be Sir Gawain! He&#39;s sure to cook up a great pot of curry real fast, since he&#39;s only got so much time to work with!</p><p><strong>Tamamo Cat:</strong><br> Yeah, but let&#39;s not invite Lip over. We wouldn&#39;t want Sir Gawain to be distracted and stop his work, now would we?</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Heh. Oh my. So he is only powerful when the sun is out? What a wonderful trait.</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong><br> You really...think so?</p><p><strong>Ozymandias:</strong><br> ...What? I do not want to hear of this, even from you.</p><p><strong>Ozymandias:</strong><br> I have no wish to involve myself in such trivialities. To think you would come to visit me, only to babble about the Roman Emperor&#39;s absurd festival.</p><p><strong>Ozymandias:</strong><br> I always thought of you as a brave man who might be frivolous even on the battlefield, but this is something else entirely.</p><p><strong>Ozymandias:</strong><br> Begone, Archer.</p><p><strong>Arash:</strong><br> Oh? That&#39;s an unexpected response from you, Pharaoh.</p><p><strong>Arash:</strong><br> You don&#39;t like festivals? I thought you were the type of king who didn&#39;t mind your citizens having fun.</p><p><strong>Ozymandias:</strong><br> Of course not. I do not care what the citizens do for pleasure. The whole universe is within my grasp! I am a tolerant pharaoh, you know!</p><p><strong>Ozymandias:</strong><br> But listen. I and I alone decide what I do. The very thought of the great pharaoh participating in an ancient Roman festival is laughable!</p><p><strong>Arash:</strong><br> Maybe so, but why don&#39;t you think it over?<br> Think of it as a breath from our hectic lives...</p><p><strong>Arash:</strong><br> But it wouldn&#39;t be bad to go and test your strength either. Think about it: we&#39;re in Chaldea, where all sorts of Heroic Spirits gather from around the world.</p><p><strong>Arash:</strong><br> Your participation would make this festival even more exciting.</p><p><strong>Ozymandias:</strong><br> ...Hmph. You are a smooth talker.</p><p><strong>Arash:</strong><br> Besides.<br> I think it&#39;s about time you met the other guy.</p><p><strong>Arash:</strong><br> When you two meet, it should be on an appropriate stage where Servants can safely fight. A battle between you\u2013the Sun King\u2013and him would be much too dangerous to take place in Chaldea itself.</p><p><strong>Ozymandias:</strong><br> Hm?</p><p><strong>Arash:</strong><br> No, nothing...</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> (I-is that...)</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> (Could that be Pharaoh Ozymandias!?<br> So he is finally attending the ancient Roman festival!)</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> (I-I cannot stand idly by! Should the Pharaoh be on the move, Nitocris must also take action!)</p><p><strong>Ozymandias:</strong><br> Nitocris.</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> Yes! Pharaoh Ozymandias!<br> What is your order!?</p><p><strong>Ozymandias:</strong><br> I have warmed to the idea of going.<br> I trust you to hold the fort while I&#39;m away.</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> ...Eh? Uh...um...well, I...!</p><p><strong>Arash:</strong><br> Hahaha. Leave the guarding to the Sphinx. It&#39;s no fun for her to stay behind during a festival. Don&#39;t you agree, big bro pharaoh?</p><p><strong>Ozymandias:</strong><br> Heh. Indeed.</p><p><strong>Ozymandias:</strong><br> We will go together then, Nitocris!<br> Ready yourself!</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> Yes!</p><p><strong>Hijikata:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Okita:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Hijikata:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Okita:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Hijikata:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Okita:</strong><br> Mr. Hijikata? Hijikata? How much longer do you plan on sitting there munching pickles?</p><p><strong>Okita:</strong><br> The event&#39;s starting. The event!<br> I know it&#39;s not a super giant one, but...</p><p><strong>Okita:</strong><br> But with all the Servants who&#39;re participating,<br> this might actually turn into a big deal!</p><p><strong>Okita:</strong><br> This is one of the best opportunities to demonstrate Tennen Rishinryu\u2013err, the Shinsengumi, that we&#39;ll ever get!</p><p><strong>Okita:</strong><br> This is also our chance to get ahead of Nobbu!</p><p><strong>Hijikata:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Okita:</strong><br> Come on now! I know you like things like this,<br> Mister Hijikata!</p><p><strong>Okita:</strong><br> ...Well, okay, so you may not measure up to me when it comes to official matches...</p><p><strong>Okita:</strong><br> But you have your eye-blinding, sand throwing, anything goes killer \u201CBaragaki\u201D technique.</p><p><strong>Okita:</strong><br> Using your ultimate Tennen Rishinryu spirit that the audience would sure to be judgmental of, let&#39;s show who&#39;s boss!</p><p><strong>Hijikata:</strong><br> ...Quit your yapping.</p><p><strong>Okita:</strong><br> Awww.</p><p><strong>Hijikata:</strong><br> ...Well, I couldn&#39;t say much for other events like races, but I suppose a festival like this is a different matter.</p><p><strong>Hijikata:</strong><br> I like the idea of fighting these other folks to the death.</p><p><strong>Okita:</strong><br> ...Um, killing isn&#39;t allowed.</p><p><strong>Okita:</strong><br> Hey, wait a minute. Mr. Hijikata? I thought you were munching on pickles because you weren&#39;t interested?</p><p><strong>Hijikata:</strong><br> ...Don&#39;t get the wrong idea. I was just filling up so I wouldn&#39;t be fighting on an empty stomach.</p><p><strong>Hijikata:</strong><br> Let&#39;s go, Okita.</p><p><strong>Okita:</strong><br> That&#39;s the spirit!</p><p><strong>Okita:</strong><br> Ah, brings back memories of our training hall days.<br> I&#39;ll get a few great Okita victories under my belt!</p><p><strong>Hijikata:</strong><br> Talk big when you win, Okita.<br> You&#39;re embarrassing yourself. Okay.</p><p><strong>Hijikata:</strong><br> Shinsengumi, move out!</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> ...Yo, hold it right there, Miss Dark Saber.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong><br> What?</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Aren&#39;t you that alternative Servant of the King of Knights of the Round Table?</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Yet you&#39;re different than usual. I sense a tenseness...a tingling sensation from you. You&#39;re so revved up, it&#39;s electrifying.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong><br> What is your point?</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Okay. Let me get straight to the point, straight as the cutting edge of a blade!</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> You&#39;re a Rider, right? That means you got some kinda mount or machine, yeah?</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> I saw ya race a while back, but that was that red&#39;n&#39;gold emperor&#39;s ride, right?</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Bumpin&#39; into you must be fate!<br> Would ya mind showing me your darkness machine!?</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> Fufu. Show a bit of mercy if he&#39;s bothering you.<br> This little brat was itching to join the race.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> But NOBODY asked him to participate.<br> He was so dejected, he&#39;s acting all funny.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> Boys are such strange creatures.<br> So keep that in mind and don&#39;t get too angry, okay?</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Wh-what!? What the hell!? When did you show up!?<br> And you&#39;re wrong! No! Absolutely not! No, no, no!</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> I ain&#39;t dejected or actin&#39; weird, okay!?<br> Quit makin&#39; up stuff about me!</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> Fine, fine. Look at those pouty lips.<br> You&#39;re just like a child.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> Want a piece of candy?<br> Or maybe a soft dumpling that&#39;s easier to chew?</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> HEY! Quit treatin&#39; me like a kid!</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong><br> ...I see now. If he is no more than a child,<br> there&#39;s no need for me to raise my mop over this.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong><br> Sakata Kintoki. If you seek a place to direct your pent-up youthful energy...</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong><br> I suggest you participate in the tournament that Emperor Nero is holding. I&#39;m sure a handful of hot-blooded folks have gathered again this year.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Hey, I ain&#39;t\u2013</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> Yes, yes. Be a good boy and stop bothering this nice lady. Now, let&#39;s go to the festival.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> Oh yes. Fufufufu. If you behave yourself,<br> maybe I&#39;ll buy you a candy apple...</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> I said NO THANK YOU!<br> Geddit through your head!</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> Hnnnn! This is going to be my year!</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> I, Xuanzang Sanzang, will win for sure this year! A whole buncha stuff happened last year that prevented me from winning!</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> So...Touta!<br> I choose you to accompany me!</p><p><strong>Tawara Touta:</strong><br> Wait a minute. You&#39;ve got it all wrong.<br> Think back on what happened last year.</p><p><strong>Tawara Touta:</strong><br> It&#39;s true this is a competition for Servants to test their strength, but this tournament&#39;s different. It&#39;s not about finding a single victor.</p><p><strong>Tawara Touta:</strong><br> It&#39;s neither an elimination competition nor is it a round robin battle. They&#39;re just one-off battles on a grand stage, each for a brief moment.</p><p><strong>Tawara Touta:</strong><br> Besides, you&#39;re a monk.<br> A great monk at that.</p><p><strong>Tawara Touta:</strong><br> Getting enthusiastic over brawls wouldn&#39;t be right. I&#39;m just saying you should probably focus on hitting the wooden drum Mokugyo.</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> Oh, that hollow-sounding thing! Nice!</p><p><strong>Tawara Touta:</strong><br> ...That&#39;s your reaction?</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> Well, yeah. It&#39;s not that everyone&#39;s fighting to kill. Everyone&#39;s participating to better themselves, as a part of training.</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> They&#39;re not focused on winning.<br> But since it&#39;s for training, we should go beyond all out!</p><p><strong>Tawara Touta:</strong><br> I guess...you could think of it that way.</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> And so! This year for sure!<br> I will! Positively! Win! (Grin)</p><p><strong>Tawara Touta:</strong><br> (Hmmm. So this is what desire looks like... Now then. At this rate, I wonder when will the great Monk Sanzang actually reach enlightenment...?)</p><p><strong>Jing Ke:</strong><br> No assaults in the night, no assassination, and no surprise attacks, huh? And on top of that...</p><p><strong>Jing Ke:</strong><br> No killing. What a buzzkill.<br> This event really will be hard on us Assassins.</p><p><strong>Spartacus:</strong><br> Hahahaha. Then the only thing you can do is REBEL. Wonderful! All forms of treachery will be permitted!</p><p><strong>Spartacus:</strong><br> Ah, Rome! Ah, the emperor! Truly a vain embodiment of a multitude of tyrannies and oppression, all in one place!</p><p><strong>Jing Ke:</strong><br> Oh hey, Spartacus.<br> You get my drift.</p><p><strong>Jing Ke:</strong><br> What do you think? Want to try running amok without restraint one time? Surely you&#39;re tired of living in Chaldea with a bunch of emperors and kings all around.</p><p><strong>Jing Ke:</strong><br> If you&#39;re in it, then I will...</p><p><strong>Spartacus:</strong><br> Hahahaha! Indeed! We have the right to rebel against all these tyrannies, smash down insolence, while the pride of the mighty is crushed!</p><p><strong>Spartacus:</strong><br> And at the same time, we shall use this opportunity to clear the air of our pent-up grudge! We have the right to such joy at this festival!</p><p><strong>Jing Ke:</strong><br> Hmph. I get it now.</p><p><strong>Jing Ke:</strong><br> This may be an event run by an authority, but you will allow such a thing to be run as long as there are people who enjoy such event. Am I correct?</p><p><strong>Jing Ke:</strong><br> You seem more calm and levelheaded than I am,<br> Spartacus, the forever rebellious one.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> Oh, it&#39;s you, Master.<br> Go away.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong><br> Ah, an expression of opinion similar to one oft expressed! I regret to say this myself, Master, but I am of the same opinion as he.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong><br> Getting right to the point in a story is important, and he is the right man for the job. What he means is: anything mightier than the pen is positively brutish!</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong><br> That is to say, we are unfit to participate in this particular event.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> A recreation of the festival of Olympia? An elegant and beautiful show of battles in the Colosseum?</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> No.<br> Wrong.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> This tournament is quite clearly an event for the physically fit. The question, though, is one of what is being promoted here.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> It&#39;s simply a shot in the arm made to entertain the readers\u2013I mean, the citizens.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> Nothing more. Nothing less. I must regretfully inform you that we are not needed here.</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong><br> Seriously? I thought this was a festival glorifying me! What a surprise! I didn&#39;t think THAT was its purpose!</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong><br> Well, I do not recall permitting such festivities, as they have nothing to do with pharaohs...so I did have a sneaking suspicion...</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong><br> Either way, it is a good thing for a nation to thrive!</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong><br> I am sure the economic effects are great.<br> If proper measures were put in place beforehand, that is.</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong><br> I wonder if Her Imperial Majesty had that in mind? I wouldn&#39;t mind taking a bit of her time to give a presentation...</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> Go do that on your own time. This study is exclusively for the writer-Servants of Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong><br> Oh come now, don&#39;t say such a thing. I&#39;d rather not simply confine myself to the same perpetually glum faces, ever harassed by deadlines...</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong><br> This beaming pharaoh&#39;s presence certainly brightens up our space, after all. The light of her divine beauty...</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong><br> Ah, what better inspiration to get our creative juices flowing!? As you can already see, my creative motivation is on the rise!</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong><br> Why thank you, Shakespeare. But I am afraid you are somewhat lacking in muscle. You really must take better care of yourself.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> You certainly do favor married women...</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong><br> No, no, no! Nothing like that! And to prove it...I have the perfect individual to back me up!</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> Well, he IS here,<br> but...well, as long as you&#39;re all right with it...</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> Hm? It appears study room A is a bit rowdy.<br> Do you suppose Master stopped by?</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> Well, no matter.<br> It is just the two of us in study room B, after all.</p><p><strong>Caster of the Nightless City:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> Beautiful. You truly are beautiful. You may be concealing that beauty with a veil, but I can tell.</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> You are an exquisite beauty who shines not by the sun&#39;s light, but a beauty who whose luminance is best viewed at night, by starlight.</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> Yet as a fellow Servant, I&#39;m sure you have considerable power on the battlefield.</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> You show no sign of that, though.<br> Beautiful as you are, you are surely dangerous as well.</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> And that is what truly intrigues me.</p><p><strong>Caster of the Nightless City:</strong><br> ...Please stop, Lord Caesar.</p><p><strong>Caster of the Nightless City:</strong><br> I am a Caster. Just a simple Caster. I am merely one of many Servants who has formed a contract with Master.</p><p><strong>Caster of the Nightless City:</strong><br> You may try to woo me with honeyed words,<br> but I dare not answer them.</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> Say no such thing.<br> You can trust me.</p><p><strong>Caster of the Nightless City:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> I am an able man.<br> Let me prove that much to you.</p><p><strong>Caster of the Nightless City:</strong><br> You mustn&#39;t...</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong><br> Lord CAAAEEESAAAR!?</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> Wha...!?</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong><br> You have apologized and begged my forgiveness countless times...and STILL you... Who exactly is that...woman...!?</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> I...well...</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> Oh.</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong><br> Do not \u201Coh\u201D me, Caesar. It seems your heart is as clogged with junk as your belly.</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong><br> It just so happens that a martial tournament is about to begin. So I have a wonderful idea.</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong><br> I will have you, Lord Caesar, participate and ask a bunch of Sabers to help you slim down.</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> I...well...I don&#39;t...</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong><br> Yes?</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> ...Uh... Yes ma&#39;am.<br> That might...not such a bad idea.</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> (...Oh, my Caesarion. What shall I do?<br> What do you think I should do?)</p><p><strong>E\uFF1AVoice of Caesarion:</strong><br> (It would help if you slimmed down a bit.)</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> Mentor, Mentor!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> I just heard! There&#39;s going to be a tournamament to test the strength of all Chaldea&#39;s Servants!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> ...Um. This tournamament isn&#39;t going to require that Santas partici...um, join, right?</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong><br> Not strictly speaking, no.<br> But since it is such a grand event...</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong><br> It would be a shame to simply ignore it.<br> First of all, let&#39;s think about seasons.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> Seasons?</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong><br> Yes. Seasons change from summer to fall, fall to winter.<br> I hear that fall is quite short.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong><br> But I digress a bit. Anyway, it would be best to take time to train in the seasons prior to winter...</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> Oh I see! So if I train well during this tournament, I would become a great Santa by the time winter comes! How logimical!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> The word is logical, and it isn&#39;t!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> It&#39;s obviously a super sporty event!<br> And Amakusa, stop talking nonsense!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> Oh, hello, grown-up me. Please do not shout in the halls. You will bother the other Servants and staff.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> And playing the role of Santa is a tough job. It requires a good, strong body, too, you know. Yes, it does. Argument won!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Don&#39;t give me that sh\u2013crap!<br> And stop saying \u201Cargument won!\u201D</p><p><strong>Jeanne d&#39;Arc:</strong><br> Calm down, me. She&#39;s like our little sister.<br> Make sure to treat her better than that, okay?</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong><br> Ah, yes.<br> You and I are surprisingly on the same page.</p><p><strong>Jeanne d&#39;Arc:</strong><br> ...Even that may happen once in a while...</p><p><strong>Jeanne d&#39;Arc:</strong><br> Right, Alter?<br> As an older sister, you should\u2013</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> HELL!!! NO!!!</p><p><strong>Count of Monte Cristo:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Count of Monte Cristo:</strong><br> ...Heh.</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong><br> Don&#39;t lurk in a corner like that.<br> Why don&#39;t you come out and talk with the others?</p><p><strong>Count of Monte Cristo:</strong><br> ...My queen.</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong><br> See? Everyone seems to be having fun.<br> Those good friends are talking with other like family.</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong><br> So many Jeanne d&#39;Arcs. Their existences and relationships are quite mysterious and...</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong><br> Wonderful.<br> Don&#39;t you agree, Count?</p><p><strong>Count of Monte Cristo:</strong><br> My Queen. I&#39;m afraid I have just happened to pass by.</p><p><strong>Count of Monte Cristo:</strong><br> I have nothing to add to that scene. I have no strong feelings. Same goes with what I think. You might as well ask your general.</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong><br> Oh. You think so?</p><p><strong>Count of Monte Cristo:</strong><br> I do.</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong><br> Oh...he disappeared.<br> Did he dematerialize?</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> Hm. So he fled. With just a few more minutes, and I would have been able to treat his mental state.</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong><br> Oh, hello, Nurse.<br> What&#39;s going on?</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> Nothing. I have been attempting to treat that man for some time now, but he flees every time. He is not aware that he is injured.</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong><br> Hehehe. Give him a rest.<br> It&#39;s not nice to pester him so much.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> No. It is, I assure you, a part of the treatment.</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong><br> I see. Then if d&#39;Eon or Amadeus goes overboard during this festival, please treat them, okay?</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> Of course.<br> You need not worry about that, Marie Antoinette.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> Whenever an event or battle should arise, I will never hesitate to treat the wounded, regardless of what it may be that ails them.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Wasteful.<br> So terribly wasteful.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> The event itself is not the problem. A break is good for morale. No one can remain sane constantly staring down the jaws of death itself.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> But! This may be a simulator, but a waste is a waste!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> The device operates on Chaldea&#39;s system, too!<br> Using it thoughtlessly is wasteful!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Besides, what benefit is there to training so many Servants? If you want to train someone, train me! Me!</p><p><strong>Nero Bride:</strong><br> Hmmm...the king of Uruk is surprisingly miserly.</p><p><strong>Nero Bride:</strong><br> I thought he was a king of luxury like me...who would spend extravagantly without a second thought...</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Fool. I&#39;m not stingy, but I am also a man who saves up! Listen well: one should only spend extravagantly after making a fortune!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> But look at Chaldea! Its power always runs at capacity, and its employees&#39; wages are never raised!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Basic salary should always be increased every year,<br> the fools!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> I&#39;m not saying that you need to be considerate of the older workers. I&#39;m only saying that one should be compensated according to their skills!</p><p><strong>Nero Bride:</strong><br> Hm. That is sound advice. I&#39;ll keep it in mind.<br> But being so stodgy and all-business is such a drear way to live.</p><p><strong>Nero Bride:</strong><br> The more glorious the festival, the better.<br> Don&#39;t you agree?</p><p><strong>Nero Bride:</strong><br> I understand your perspective, of course, but a simulator exists to be used, doesn&#39;t it?</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Then just bear in mind the sheer amount of data that will create. The thing that&#39;s called...Sheba?</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> If that thing&#39;s running at full capacity, day and night,<br> Da Vinci is sure to get frustrated. The first part of the festival should be run modestly.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> After all, the preliminaries are mere battles between those up until four stars. It shouldn&#39;t concern a five star Servant like me!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Fwahahahahahahahaha!</p><p><strong>Nero Bride:</strong><br> Fuwahahahahahahahaha!<br> I&#39;m just laughing along with you!</p><p><strong>Nero Bride:</strong><br> Ah, that&#39;s the king Gilgamesh I&#39;ve heard of! The arrogant but mischievous sort that you just can&#39;t hate for some reason!</p><p><strong>Romulus:</strong><br> ...Ah, the one who walks the never-ending path.</p><p><strong>Romulus:</strong><br> You are now in Chaldea, a place where numberless destinies intersect. Yet I notice that you purposefully avoid interacting with others.</p><p><strong>Romulus:</strong><br> A foolish choice.<br> Humans cannot live or act in isolation.</p><p><strong>Romulus:</strong><br> So too with Rome.<br> You must reflect and look back on your own path.</p><p><strong>Arthur:</strong><br> ...My apologies.</p><p><strong>Arthur:</strong><br> Holy Progenitor, Romulus.<br> I am not Rome.</p><p><strong>Arthur:</strong><br> Still, I shall keep those words of yours in my heart.<br> But remember, I once fought against Rome itself.</p><p><strong>Romulus:</strong><br> No, you are Rome.</p><p><strong>Romulus:</strong><br> You are human, therefore you are Rome.<br> Make no mistake: Rome and love reside within all people.</p><p><strong>Romulus:</strong><br> Enjoy yourself. Even should you keep your face concealed, none will judge you.</p><p><strong>Romulus:</strong><br> My Rome is the source of many joyous festivals.<br> Do not forget, my child. People cannot live without joy.</p><p><strong>Romulus:</strong><br> In other words...</p><p><strong>Romulus:</strong><br> Enjoy! Smile!</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> Okay, here we go!</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> ...Mahatma Change!</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> Our summer vacation has been extended! Hot places are still hot, so there&#39;s no reason not to let loose!</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> I see. This is not bad at all. However, I believe I shall join the authors to escape the summer heat.</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> What are you talking about? You can&#39;t. You need to be out in the sun and move that body of yours sometimes.</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> Contrary to what you say, you&#39;re well-versed in such activities, aren&#39;t you, Master of Baritsu?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Only in times of emergency.<br> Besides, my Baritsu is intended for self defense\u2013</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> No more excuses!<br> Come on, hurry to the Colosseum! Get to it!</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> ...Seriously?</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> Yes, of course.<br> You and I both are going on a mad dash!</p><p><strong>A\uFF1AMash:</strong><br> Ah, so many...</p><p><strong>A\uFF1AMash:</strong><br> All the Servants with dauntless courage have assembled in Chaldea...

I didn&#39;t realize your dilemma.<br> But I will not neglect your cries anymore.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Siegfried!</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> It is, of course, not only those two who have gotten involved, Mash.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> As I was the one who put some of these ideas in your head, it would be wrong of me to sit back and watch.</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong><br> I knew something was strange!<br> I thought Mash was less shield-y than usual.</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong><br> Rather, I suspected she was more lance-y...and it turned out to be true!</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong><br> Because a shield + lance = me, Leonidas! Which means, according to my calculations, you are not Miss Mash!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Leonidas! Sc\xE1thach!</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong><br> And it&#39;s not just us! All the Servants who sensed Miss Brynhild&#39;s unusual behavior have come!</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong><br> We have assembled here!</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Well, it&#39;s a bit embarrassing to be introduced like that. The truth is that we just sensed something hinky.</p><p><strong>Passionlip:</strong><br> Um...I believe you sensed it better than that. You looked really worried... You looked almost like a pervert looking at prey.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> I&#39;m no pervert. Stalker at WORST!<br> Besides, how would you know what I was thinking?</p><p><strong>Passionlip:</strong><br> Eh...? Well the moment you looked at Mash,<br> you were oddly irritated and grumpy...</p><p><strong>Passionlip:</strong><br> You already have shifty eyes to begin with, but then you got even more awkward...and I was like \u201Cack.\u201D</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> (Irritated) Listen, you: I do not have shifty eyes.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Chaldea is kind of like a campsite. It&#39;s only natural to monitor the health and wellness of everyone here.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Who&#39;s not feeling good...who&#39;s acting strange...who&#39;s talking weird. Stuff like that.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> I&#39;m well versed in scouting. I&#39;d never miss any signs of anything or anyone about to go off an betray us.</p><p><strong>Passionlip:</strong><br> I see... But the fact remains that you look creepy when you&#39;re staring at everyone around the cafeteria.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> That&#39;s not the point. Were you even listening!? I think all the blood that should be in your brain ended up going to your breasts!</p><p><strong>Passionlip:</strong><br> I-it did not! And please stop scolding and punishing me like a know-it-all!</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong><br> Oh, man, that is just, like, MEGA cringe.<br> How &#39;bout you downvote that creeper style. For real.</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong><br> So this is the real Greenie? Super skeevy? Is he, like, out for the shrine maiden fox&#39;s number one spot?</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Like hell! I&#39;m a hunter! That fox and I are rivals when it comes to who hunts and who gets hunted.</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong><br> Now, now, Lady Suzuka. The punishment in this case would be about muscle. There&#39;s no doubt he&#39;s talking about training one&#39;s muscles.</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong><br> There is no difference in the muscles of men and women! Therefore, there is nothing to cringe about!</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong><br> Seriously? Is that what Chaldea&#39;s like?<br> Chaldea&#39;s all about that dudebro life, then?</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong><br> No, we are a group of intellectuals who prize careful calculation!</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong><br> But I can see that Lady Passionlip, Lady Suzuka, and Sir Robin get along well. Did you all fight alongside each other at some point?</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong><br> Anyway, Lady Mash and Fujimaru!<br> The French contingent has come as well!</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong><br> If the holy maiden commands me, then I shall not waver. I had no idea that a Valkyrie of Northern Europe had concealed herself within this festival.</p><p><strong>d&#39;Eon:</strong><br> I&#39;d like for this to end peacefully.<br> If you stop now, it will be as if nothing happened.</p><p><strong>d&#39;Eon:</strong><br> Let us have some tea instead.<br> This message I bring from the queen herself, Brynhild.</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong><br> There are still more warriors here to support you! Behold!</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong><br> Hey! We&#39;re here too! Come on, teacher!<br> Don&#39;t lag behind! Come to the front!</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong><br> ...Why would you put a Caster on the front line?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong><br> Ah, now I see. Brynhild of Northern Europe.<br> Even if you do really possess a true Primordial Rune...</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong><br> It would be best not to use its full strength here. Those runes hold the power of the great god of the Norse, Odin.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong><br> Worst case scenario, not only will your Spirit Origin be destroyed, you may create an anomaly that spreads through all of Chaldea.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong><br> Should that happen, even Master would not survive. For example, there may be a flux in magical energy through magical circuits...</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong><br> And phenomena that are otherwise impossible may occur within the space taken over by a Primordial Rune.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong><br> But...why?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong><br> You do not appear to be quite so mad...</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong><br> Teacher, you&#39;re talking too much!</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong><br> I do not recall accepting you as my pupil. What a peculiar twist of fate, considering who you become.</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong><br> Oh don&#39;t be so mean, teacher.<br> Gil came by because he is genuinely concerned.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong><br> Gil... Unbelievable...</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong><br> Ah, this display is almost like a teacher with his students on a school trip. It certainly lightens the mood here!</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong><br> So there you have it, Lady Brynhild!<br> You may be a demigod...</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong><br> But you must see that you are outnumbered! Out of respect for Lady Mash&#39;s shield and everyone&#39;s concern, why don&#39;t you put down your lance?</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Altera:</strong><br> The king gifted with brilliance is correct, Valkyrie.</p><p><strong>Altera:</strong><br> According to legend, you are seen as my younger sister in a way.</p><p><strong>Altera:</strong><br> As I am now, I have no memory of that...but the fact remains that we are somehow related.</p><p><strong>Altera:</strong><br> I cannot have you destroyed here.<br> I have yet to properly speak with you.</p><p><strong>Altera:</strong><br> ...My sister.</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong><br> ...Lord Attil\u2013Altera...</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong><br> The man so like my Sigurd...<br> No, I am restraining my desire for Sigurd...</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong><br> I will do what must be done...<br> It is as simple as that.</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong><br> ...I also wanted to speak with you.<br> But...</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong><br> Why can&#39;t you? We&#39;re at a festival.<br> There&#39;s no point in holding back.</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong><br> Use this place to air out dirty laundry or get on good terms with each other.</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong><br> I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a bad idea. This old man thinks you should just talk when you have the chance.</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong><br> Well, if you can&#39;t, that&#39;s fine too.</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong><br> Argh! Dammit! That&#39;s annoying! Doesn&#39;t matter what is...you just gotta solve it with your fist!</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> That&#39;s just shortsighted, Bear-Wolf Guy!</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Getting&#39; rough with girls ain&#39;t golden.<br> After all, Riders are heroes!</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong><br> Women and children got nothing to do with it if we&#39;re up against Heroic Spirits! And sorry to burst your bubble, but I&#39;m a Berserker!</p><p><strong>Hijikata:</strong><br> Hmph. At least someone gets it...</p><p><strong>Hijikata:</strong><br> If there&#39;s no choice but to push through, all you have to do is to stick to your values until the very end!</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> He&#39;s right. It&#39;s not about being a woman or child.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> Such a rule will always apply in places where lives are at stake. Be it Heroic Spirit or human, there&#39;s no difference.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> Indeed. Though that does not mean it is futile to try to communicate.</p><p><strong>Ozymandias:</strong><br> Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha! Hahahahahahahaha!<br> Ah, my sides hurt from all this laughing!</p><p><strong>Ozymandias:</strong><br> That woman was crazy enough to point her lance at a God King&#39;s grand temple, MY temple! Words won&#39;t stop her!</p><p><strong>Arash:</strong><br> I suppose. I agree with you there.</p><p><strong>Arash:</strong><br> ...Oh hey. You&#39;re here too, Master. If you&#39;re back to your old self, you&#39;d better get serious quick!</p><p><strong>Arthur:</strong><br> Yes, I agree.</p><p><strong>Arthur:</strong><br> Her lance hasn&#39;t grown yet, so she doesn&#39;t have the power to wipe us all out in one swing.</p><p><strong>Arthur:</strong><br> If the plan is to restrain her, we must be quick.<br> And then the rest is up to you, Master.</p><p><strong>Ozymandias:</strong><br> Hm?</p><p><strong>Ozymandias:</strong><br> You&#39;re a new face, aren&#39;t you?<br> Wait. Wait a moment. That armor...that voice...that bearing... Could you be...?</p><p><strong>Arash:</strong><br> Yeah, yeah. Right now we need to focus on the Valkyrie!<br> If we don&#39;t stop her soon, we&#39;ll be goners!</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong><br> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Stop this.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> You don&#39;t need to modify Servants!</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong><br> ...How troubling.</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong><br> I do not know what to say.<br> Master, are you saying this has all been unnecessary?</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong><br> When you look at me like that, it is clear that there is no need for me to continue down this egotistical path I have taken.</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong><br> Yes...behavior so selfish must be stopped immediately, I\u2013</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong><br> ...I want to stop...at least I think I want to stop.<br> But at the same time...</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong><br> ...I feel I must create the strongest possible Heroic Spirit...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> No, Brynhild!</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong><br> I&#39;m sorry.<br> I&#39;m sorry.</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong><br> I...I cannot hold myself back.<br> I truly am an unstable Heroic Spirit.</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong><br> It...it will happen automatically.<br> I will begin to love automatically.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> Magical energy surge!<br> Master, her Primordial Rune is activating!</p><p><strong>Altera:</strong><br> I leave the commands to you, Master. It seems we have no choice but to settle this with our swords.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Prepare for battle!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Let&#39;s stop her!</p><p><strong>Altera:</strong><br> Understood, Master!</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong><br> ...Give me a blade. Show me all your power! The one who ends my life will be given the protection and blessing of Palingenesis!!!</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong><br> Warriors! Be chosen!<br> Heroes! Stop me!</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong><br> Me me me...<br> Me me me me me me me me meee!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Brynhild!</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong><br> Master...!!!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong><br> ...And that&#39;s how it went.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong><br> Chaldea&#39;s Master and [\u2642 his /\u2640 her] Servants managed to stop the out-of-control Valkyrie.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong><br> Oh, and the Valkyrie is quite safe. Her Spirit Core, too.<br> In the end, she did not use a Primordial Rune.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong><br> Though this is indeed an interesting case study...</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong><br> It all, luckily, ended well.<br> As to what caused her to go berserk in the first place...</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong><br> El-Melloi had some idea, but unfortunately he couldn&#39;t pinpoint exactly what it was.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong><br> The important bit is that Chaldea is safe and sound.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong><br> None of its systems, Sheba included,<br> went out of control.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong><br> It turned out not to be possible to locate another Holy Grail.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong><br> At any rate, sorry to get your hopes up.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong><br> ...What are you talking about?</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong><br> If I recall, you mentioned something might happen before this tournament started.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong><br> I had absolutely nothing to do with this.<br> I am just relieved everyone is safe.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong><br> Let&#39;s just leave it at that.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong><br> I was interested in what you were going to do if you obtained a Holy Grail, but... Hahaha. You&#39;re a more cunning man than I expected.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong><br> Then I shall take my leave.<br> You should at least enjoy this festival until its end.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong><br> It&#39;s being held so everyone can relax.<br> After all, everyone deserves a breather once in a while.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong><br> On the other hand...</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong><br> Perhaps a minor bit of wickedness like that is more relaxing to you than anything else.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong><br> Hahahaha! I believe I&#39;ll have to duck that particular question, young man!</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong><br> ...Farewell.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong><br> He really is a cunning man. Intriguing.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong><br> Now then. I suppose it&#39;s punishment time.<br> I know you&#39;re skulking about, O Great Detective.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Not running away or hiding is unlike you. Have your habits changed now that you&#39;ve become a Servant?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Either way, you are the culprit.<br> You were the one who caused Brynhild to go berserk.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong><br> Have you any proof?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> No physical evidence, obviously.<br> I would not expect you to be so careless.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> But of course, I did come across the truth.<br> Besides, Lord El-Melloi was the detective today.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> The reasoning via magecraft techniques approach is certainly interesting. But either way...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Even if there is no clear-cut evidence, there are always ways to find the culprit.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> While such a thing may be impossible for an ordinary man, it is surely not so for the Great Detective. I trust I needn&#39;t elaborate?</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong><br> Heh. So what you&#39;re trying to say is...</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong><br> I&#39;m busted.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> (Nod)</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> The only thing that remains unclear is whether you knew her rampage could be stopped at the last minute.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong><br> Hope for tomorrow!</p><p>(Runs away)</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Baritsu!!! (Gentlemanly kick!)</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong><br> Ow...it looked like you didn&#39;t put your whole weight on it, yet it still stings...! Are you sure that move&#39;s not against the rules!?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Helena was right. I&#39;m glad I participated in the festival.<br> It was good to move about a bit.</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong><br> Master...I wish to formally apologize.</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong><br> I&#39;m sorry for all the trouble I caused.<br> I am a terribly unstable Servant...</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong><br> But Master. Please know that I will do my utmost not to make trouble for you anymore.</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong><br> Leonardo da Vinci gave me a gift.</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong><br> She used a portion of Chaldea&#39;s resources to create a device that will make sure my operational status remains normal.</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong><br> It may not be completely flawless,<br> but I feel more secure than I did before.</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong><br> Should I...act strange...again...</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong><br> ...Please do not hesitate to break me.<br> Until that time comes, I will be your strength.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I won&#39;t break you.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> It&#39;s okay. You&#39;ll never go berserk again, Brynhild.</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong><br> ...Yes, Master.</p>', 656);
