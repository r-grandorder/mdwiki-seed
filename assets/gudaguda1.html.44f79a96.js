Where are they from?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> They seem to have directly entered from a different phase space. But this response? I wonder what this is.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Doctor, is it an emergency?<br> Oh, Senpai, good morning.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You look cheerful again today.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes, of course. It&#39;s good to be cheerful.<br> I also had a delicious breakfast today.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I think you&#39;re acting a little too calm!<br> Greetings are important, but for now, intruder!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> What was breakfast?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Fried eggs, seaweed, and miso soup, with stewed pumpkins for dessert.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Even rationing out what little we have stored, I believe this was a frugal yet complete meal.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Pumpkin, huh. We did harvest a lot, so there is an excess of them.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> No wait!<br> Intruder, the intruder!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Oh my, I&#39;ll go intercept them right away.<br> Senpai, please do the honors.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The response was from around here...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Mash, behind you!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Wh\u2013?</p><p><strong>H\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Nobu nobuu!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ?!?!?!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Wha\u2013?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> What?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Huh?</p><p><strong>H\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Nobu nobuu!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> What is this thing?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Be careful, Mash. It may look like a joke, but it&#39;s displaying high combat capabilities.</p><p><strong>H\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Nobbuu!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Master!<br> Look out!</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Stop right there!</p><p><strong>H\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Nobu!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> W-Who are you?</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Nice to meet you. I&#39;m from Shinsen\u2013<br> Uh... Let&#39;s see... Just call me Sakura Saber.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Sakura... Saber?</p><p><strong>Sakura Saber:</strong><br> Yes. I materialized in this world to pursue that mysterious creature...</p><p><strong>E\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Wait, wait, man-slayer!<br> Don&#39;t leave me behind!</p><p><strong>E\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Sheesh, my normal self could take them out like it was nothing, but this is rather hard on me...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> U-Um, the two of you are?</p><p><strong>E\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Hmm? Me? I am the Demon King of the Sixth Heaven, Nobu\u2013 No, Demon, right! I&#39;m Demon Archer!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Demon Archer and Sakura Saber...<br> I see.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> If I could interrupt, I figured out where that thing spawned. It&#39;s a different phase space that collided with Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> We have to destroy the source of the problem.<br> Or else, Chaldea will be filled with strange creatures.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> I finished calculating the coordinates for the Rayshift.<br> Go in there and get rid of them quick!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Understood! I&#39;ll hurry over with Senpai!<br> Um, by the way, what will you two do?</p><p><strong>Sakura Saber:</strong><br> We&#39;re hoping to do the same thing you&#39;re trying to do.<br> Please let us come along with you.</p><p><strong>Sakura Saber:</strong><br> If that&#39;s okay with you?<br> Archer?</p><p><strong>Demon Archer:</strong><br> All right, all right. Well, it is our problem and I&#39;ve grown tired of chasing after them...</p><p><strong>Demon Archer:</strong><br> Very well! The Demon King of the Sixth Heaven,<br> Demon Archer will lend you a hand!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Anyway, once you all Rayshift, I&#39;ll lock the system down.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> There. Now we can have some peace of mind.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> By the way, those two Servants...<br> How did they directly materialize into Chaldea?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Hmm, it looks like we got connected to a strange space by an astronomical probability.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Look at the conditions they&#39;re Rayshifting into. What&#39;s this? Phenomena Corruption from another phase space?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> In any case, it&#39;s pretty terrible.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Wow... What&#39;s this? A group of strange creatures, and something else? They&#39;re not quite Shadow Servants...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...Either way, I believe Fujimaru will be able to do something about it\u2014</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> \u2014Now it&#39;s time for me to go back to bed.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I&#39;m sleepy because I was sending messages to Magi\u2606Mari till really late last night.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> You kept sending her messages and she just kept yelling at you... Is that some sort of punishment?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> It&#39;s not a punishment, it&#39;s a reward!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Though, I need to take a nap or something to reset my mind and regain my footing...</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Foou!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Huh? It&#39;s you, Fou. You were left behind? Eh?<br> You had a bad feeling so you didn&#39;t want to go?</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Foou...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Rayshift complete, but...<br> Where are we?</p><p><strong>Demon Archer:</strong><br> It seems the Imperial Holy Grail lost control and created a separate dimension within this phase space.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Imperial... Holy Grail?<br> What is that?</p><p><strong>Sakura Saber:</strong><br> We can talk later.<br> They&#39;re coming!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The Grail\u2014is out of control?</p><p><strong>Sakura Saber:</strong><br> Yes. There was a Holy Grail War in our world,<br> but the Grail was tampered with by some strange technology.</p><p><strong>Sakura Saber:</strong><br> At the end of all that tampering, its power got out of control...</p><p><strong>Demon Archer:</strong><br> Unfortunately, I got involved in the accident and my subconscious materialized.<br> It&#39;s starting to\u2014corrupt reality.</p><p><strong>Demon Archer:</strong><br> Worst of all, it took away most of my power. Originally I should be OP like a Last Boss, but now I&#39;m like a 0.5 star Servant...</p><p><strong>Demon Archer:</strong><br> In short, I got nerfed to a level 1 noob.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Star?</p><p><strong>Demon Archer:</strong><br> With my power, I should&#39;ve been a 5-star character.<br> Why did it end up like this...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> So you&#39;re one of those...</p><p><strong>Sakura Saber:</strong><br> I&#39;m sorry our Archer is causing you so much trouble.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> So that indescribable creature is the manifestation of Demon Archer&#39;s subconscious and power?</p><p><strong>Demon Archer:</strong><br> Y-Yeah. I don&#39;t quite understand it myself,<br> but that seems to be the case.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> How irresponsible...</p><p><strong>Sakura Saber:</strong><br> This has nothing to do with you,<br> I&#39;m sorry that you&#39;ve gotten involved.</p><p><strong>Sakura Saber:</strong><br> It&#39;s basically all Archer&#39;s fault, so please complain to her as much as you want.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> It only has one eye...</p><p><strong>Demon Archer:</strong><br> I-It&#39;s only being hidden by hair, yes?<br> See, it&#39;s just like Mash over there!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Don&#39;t lump me in with that thing!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> By the way, I found this during the earlier battle.<br> ...A bowl? Perhaps? And a steel pot?</p><p><strong>Demon Archer:</strong><br> Looks like the magical energy leaking from the Grail copied what&#39;s \u201Cvaluable\u201D in my mind.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Valuable? A black pot and an old bowl...<br> They don&#39;t look like they&#39;re that valuable...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Mash, can I have a look at them?<br> Hmm, hmm...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> What is this? Such dusty looking vessels are valuable in the Far East?</p><p><strong>Demon Archer:</strong><br> Rude Westerners! Rikyu will punch you for not understanding value in the simple and subdued!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Well, even if you claim this is valuable...<br> Wait, now that you mention it...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> \u2014I&#39;m curious! These tea set-like things?<br> My workshop will take them!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> You&#39;re interested in them?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Just look at this black, unsightly teapot!<br> Quality iron, smooth to the touch...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> ...But is super dull in shape and color. Still, I feel like it has an indescribable charm, or maybe not so much?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> That&#39;s what she meant by \u201Csimple and subdued!\u201D</p><p><strong>Demon Archer:</strong><br> Oh, you are quite knowledgeable.<br> I&#39;ll make you some tea later.</p><p><strong>Demon Archer:</strong><br> Let&#39;s see, I&#39;ll rent out an entire temple somewhere...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Won&#39;t it explode?</p><p><strong>Sakura Saber:</strong><br> No, no, there is no way a teapot could ever explode.</p><p><strong>Demon Archer:</strong><br> You think so?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I-In any case, let&#39;s head towards the center of this Singularity.</p><p><strong>Sakura Saber:</strong><br> We somewhat forced your hand for assistance,<br> but I hope we can work together well.</p><p><strong>Demon Archer:</strong><br> Right!

The flow of magical energy coming from the Grail is really strange.</p><p><strong>Mouri Medinari:</strong><br> The Grail&#39;s being used for something unnecessary again.<br> Don&#39;t you want to have a proper Holy Grail War?</p><p><strong>Chousokabe Emichika:</strong><br> As expected of a witch from the Age of Gods.<br> You&#39;ve seen through this trickery?</p><p><strong>Mouri Medinari:</strong><br> Of course.<br> ...Not that I can do anything about it, though.</p><p><strong>Mouri Medinari:</strong><br> You know how there&#39;s supposedly a familiar made from the flesh of corpses?</p><p><strong>Mouri Medinari:</strong><br> Flesh...enstein, was it?<br> That is what&#39;s happening with the Grail this time.</p><p><strong>Mouri Medinari:</strong><br> A lot of things got tampered with, and it turned into something weird...</p><p><strong>Shimazu S\xE9tanta:</strong><br> It&#39;s a pain.

What&#39;s that?<br> I don&#39;t know anything about the history of the Far East!</p><p><strong>Chousokabe Emichika:</strong><br> Hm, a grand strategist and the Witch of Betrayal.<br> The Grail certainly made strange pairings.</p><p><strong>Mouri Medinari:</strong><br> You there, don&#39;t look like you understand everything.</p><p><strong>Mouri Medinari:</strong><br> I want you to hit enemies lured in from the sides.<br> An ambush, basically.</p><p><strong>Chousokabe Emichika:</strong><br> So it&#39;s like a guerilla attack.
