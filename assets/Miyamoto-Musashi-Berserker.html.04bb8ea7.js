When she did, problems with Grail compatibility caused the Buddha-nature she fostered in her years of training to be separated from her Saint Graph and wreak havoc as an independent Celestial Demon.</p><p>Celestial Demon Musashi stole Musashi&#39;s strength as a swordswoman, leaving her as just Musashi... Berserker.</p><p>Musashi left the place pretending she never saw the Celestial Demon until she felt responsible... If she leaves Celestial Demon Musashi be, she&#39;ll cause a great calamity. And so she asked a shady mage she once met (Merlin) for advice.</p><p>&quot;Why don&#39;t we put a seal on the place this Celestial Demon girl is in? Didn&#39;t you say you sealed an entire island to death once? That&#39;s a rational solution. I know a king who can do the same thing. Let&#39;s go with that.&quot;</p><p>Merlin&#39;s deceitful words lead Arthuria Ruler to build a city in the middle of the Grand Canyon. She created a second Las Vegas identical to the original, sealed the Celestial Demon, and ultimately established a system to select Swordbeauties who could defeat Celestial Demon Musashi. (Musashi is an annoying Heroic Spirit who never admits defeat unless she&#39;s defeated by a Saber!)</p><p>Berserker Musashi defeating Celestial Demon Musashi would mean nothing. On the contrary, it would only cause her to be absorbed, transform into the Celestial Demon Maouson, and become just a wild troublemaker.</p><p>So, she decided to search for a Swordbeauty who could surpass her with the sword as a Saber in her stead, support the girl, and have her defeat Celestial Demon Musashi.</p><p>Musashi didn&#39;t tell these circumstances to anyone.</p><p>She hoped that she could pull strings in the background well enough that no one would know that the mysterious Celestial Demon causing the collapse of the West was her.</p><p>Why no one can know about her failure?

The competitive swimming swimsuit was just out of personal preference, and the chambara swords just came along with its sporty imagery; and the America bikini with a pair of Gunblades was because the summer event was set in Las Vegas. The Third Ascension was difficult to deliver, but I could get something done with the keywords &quot;Japanese-style&quot; and &quot;Celestial Demon&quot;. It might be difficult to see with how fast the animation is, but she can switch the sides of the greatsword&#39;s blade and attack with the bigger part. I changed her hairstyle to make it easier to distinguish her from Saber Musashi and changed the color in every Ascension in an attempt to make it easier to visualize in the icon.
