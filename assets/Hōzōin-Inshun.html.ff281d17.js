This is more than enough.<br> Hmm, I see he was quite the monster.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Can I ask what brought this up, Inshun? What made you want to see the information on Shimousa now...?</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong><br> A fair question.</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong><br> As I see it, one could make a compelling case for Lancer of Purgatorio&#39;s sins being my own.</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong><br> Despite being summoned as a Heroic Spirit...</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong><br> ...it was my own strength that made me a target\u2013a catalyst to facilitate my fall to Lancer of Purgatorio.</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong><br> That will never do. It is a far more miserable fate than I could have ever imagined.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> But, that wasn&#39;t your fault...</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong><br> Indeed not.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> You have a pretty intense sense of personal responsibility!</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong><br> I am a monk first, you know.<br> Even before I am a hero.</p><hr><p><strong>Inshun:</strong><br> Of course, I have no memory whatsoever of the time I spent as Lancer of Purgatorio.</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong><br> So, from my perspective...</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong><br> ...it is no different than having a doppelg\xE4nger going around causing destruction in my name.</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong><br> However, Master, there is one aspect of this in particular that I absolutely cannot abide.</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong><br> This evil doppelg\xE4nger of mine cannot\u2013must not be stronger than me.</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong><br> For if giving myself over to evil made my spear techniques that much sharper, I would have no choice but to do so.</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong><br> Of course, I would see it as a failure, as I would have given up my humanity.</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong><br> But had I learned of it while I was alive...I cannot say for certain that I could have resisted the temptation that would have offered.</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong><br> Indeed, I cannot be certain at all.<br> And that worries me!</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong><br> Lady Musashi was kind enough to assure me that I was definitely stronger than Purgatorio...</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong><br> ...but that is not enough!</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong><br> No, I believe the only choice left to me now is to prove it in the simulator.</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong><br> It is possible to do that, yes?<br> If I can converse with him there too, so much the better.</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong><br> This way, I can find out which of us is stronger...me, or my evil doppelg\xE4nger.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...All right, I can see you&#39;ve made up your mind.</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong><br> Indeed, I have.<br> Thank you for indulging me, Master!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Okay, let&#39;s do it!</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong><br> Wonderful! No evil version of me will ever get the better of my true self!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Now I see. Fighting Lancer of Purgatorio really is something you need to do for yourself.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Understood.<br> I&#39;ll boot up the simulator right now!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong><br> Too easy!</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong><br> In fact...they all seemed strangely weak.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Yeah, the real one was way stronger than that.</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong><br> I thought as much.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Maybe you&#39;re just that good...?</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong><br> Thank you, Master, but I know that the Purgatorio I saw in Chaldea&#39;s database was capable of more than this.</p><hr><p><strong>Inshun:</strong><br> Lady Mash, I appreciate your thoughtfulness,<br> but there is no need to hold anything back.</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong><br> Please, give me something closer to the true Purgatorio.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> R-right!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Okay, let&#39;s see...<br> I know, I&#39;ll try raising the difficulty!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I&#39;ll also increase his base stats, unlock his Noble Phantasm, and give him more subordinates to command...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> There, that should do it.<br> Commencing second battle now!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong><br> Hmm. That was certainly a more challenging foe...<br> but still a far cry from what I was hoping for.</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong><br> His spear technique was lacking in both refinement and bloodlust.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I see... I&#39;m sorry. I&#39;m afraid this might be as close as the simulator can get.</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong><br> What a shame. Then I suppose it will not be possible to compare our skills in this manner.</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong><br> I apologize for wasting your time with this, Master!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Don&#39;t worry about it. All part of the job.</p><hr><p><strong>Inshun:</strong><br> Hahahaha. Spoken like a true leader.</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong><br> Very well then, let us call it a day.<br> Thank you again, Master!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Anytime, Inshun.</p><hr><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fooou...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> The sky is stained red as blood.<br> Crimson crows caw eerily in the distance.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Blood drips from the tip of my spear. I will not relax my grip until those before me are dead.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> ...Rejoice. Your offerings are all here.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I will kill all manner of innocents.<br> Children, the elderly, infants, invalids...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Why, you ask? To sharpen my spear. Spears are meant for killing, and so only killing can hone their edges.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> The time for the massacre is at hand.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Wh-what the hell!?</p><hr><p><strong>Lancer of Purgatorio:</strong><br> Hahahahahaha!<br> Hee... Heeheeheeheehee!</p><p><strong>Lancer of Purgatorio:</strong><br> What a delightful discovery! I can feel my skills sharpening with every life my spear takes!</p><p><strong>Lancer of Purgatorio:</strong><br> Thinking back on it now...<br> my life could not have been more dull!</p><p><strong>Lancer of Purgatorio:</strong><br> Behold, behold, behold, Fujimaru!</p><p><strong>Lancer of Purgatorio:</strong><br> The more bodies pile up,<br> the keener my spear grows!</p><p><strong>Lancer of Purgatorio:</strong><br> Now, you will bear witness as I kill hundreds, thousands, all to propel my spear into the realm of the gods!</p><p><strong>A\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Ahem... I apologize for interrupting your speech,<br> but I take it you are Lord Lancer of Purgatorio?</p><p><strong>Lancer of Purgatorio:</strong><br> ...So, you&#39;ve come...<br> Houzouin Inshun...!</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong><br> Of course. Now that I have heard your third-rate villainy for myself, I cannot simply stand by and do nothing about it.</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong><br> My name is Houzouin Inshun.<br> Now, let us have a good, fair fight.</p><p><strong>Lancer of Purgatorio:</strong><br> Hahaha! You, Inshun?<br> At best, you are a pale imitation.</p><p><strong>Lancer of Purgatorio:</strong><br> You live in a dreamworld, whereas I live in reality. Refusing to take life? The Buddha&#39;s mercy?</p><p><strong>Lancer of Purgatorio:</strong><br> Foolishness! Complete and utter foolishness!</p><p><strong>Lancer of Purgatorio:</strong><br> You reached your limit the moment you allowed such pointless notions to hold you back!</p><p><strong>Lancer of Purgatorio:</strong><br> There will be no fight!<br> Only a slaughter!</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong><br> If killing truly made one stronger, the Warring States period would have overflowed with masters of the blade.</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong><br> Hmm... Be honest with me, Master.</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong><br> Between him and me, who do you think is stronger?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You!</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong><br> Hahahaha! You have a good eye indeed, Master!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Us!</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong><br> O-oh, right. It is a bit embarrassing to have it pointed out so bluntly, but I cannot deny it!</p><hr><p><strong>Inshun:</strong><br> That aside, if anyone here should be laughing, it is me!</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong><br> Purgatorio, you have been going on and on about making your spear sharper, which leaves me a bit confused.</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong><br> Which is it? Do you wish for your spear to grow sharper, or do you wish to grow stronger?</p><p><strong>Lancer of Purgatorio:</strong><br> What was that...?</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong><br> The best mouse-catching cat in the world would be no good to anyone if it also went around eating people.</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong><br> After all, a cat&#39;s most important duty is to be cute. Would you not agree?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Meow.</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong><br> Exactly. All a cat need do to be cute is meow.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Yeah, I guess that&#39;s true.</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong><br> Unfortunately, it seems Purgatorio here has gotten his priorities mixed up.</p><hr><p><strong>Lancer of Purgatorio:</strong><br> What are you even talking about!?</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong><br> It&#39;s simple.</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong><br> If all you want is a sharper spear, there is a better way to obtain it than by slaughtering people.</p><p><strong>Lancer of Purgatorio:</strong><br> What...!?</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong><br> All you need do is let someone stronger handle it.<br> What could be easier?</p><p><strong>Lancer of Purgatorio:</strong><br> Ridiculous, Inshun!<br> You&#39;re not making the least bit of sense!</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong><br> And what sense is there in causing others unnecessary pain and suffering?</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong><br> Is your desire merely to brag about all the lives you have taken?</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong><br> If so, I can think of no more hollow or foolish endeavor than the one you undertake.</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong><br> I imagine the corruption makes it impossible for you to know any better, but I cannot help but laugh when I think how you truly believed that was all you needed to grow stronger.</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong><br> All right. I&#39;ve learned all I wanted to know.<br> Now the only thing left to us is a duel.</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong><br> Indeed, I consider this an act of mercy, for I have never in my life met a more pitiable opponent!</p><p><strong>Lancer of Purgatorio:</strong><br> Enough of your foolish prattling, Inshun!</p><p><strong>Lancer of Purgatorio:</strong><br> You will see for yourself how sharp my spear has become...as it slices you to ribbons!</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong><br> Come then, Master.</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong><br> Let us bring this to a speedy end and be on our way back to Chaldea!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Lancer of Purgatorio:</strong><br> Mwahahaha! Is that all you&#39;ve got!?<br> None can match this body and its sheer techni\u2013</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong><br> It&#39;s over.</p><p><strong>Lancer of Purgatorio:</strong></p><p>Wha...!?<br> Ah... Ahhh!?</p><p><strong>Lancer of Purgatorio:</strong><br> Impossible! This can&#39;t be right! Your strike had all the strength of a house cat swatting at a reed! How could I not parry it...!?</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong><br> You have wasted so much power; power that already exceeded your limits. Of course it would leave you vulnerable.</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong><br> You completely failed to understand your own body, Purgatorio.</p><p><strong>Lancer of Purgatorio:</strong><br> No... No! This cannot be true!</p><p><strong>Lancer of Purgatorio:</strong><br> I haven&#39;t even avenged my defeat at the hands of that Musashi woman!</p><p><strong>Lancer of Purgatorio:</strong><br> My miraculous resurrection was meant to be my chance to exact my reven\u2013</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong><br> Hmm, I suppose you may fare a bit better against an opponent with swords since that has been your focus...</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong><br> ...but the rest is quite sloppy. You may have gained in one area, but you have lost much in others.</p><p><strong>Lancer of Purgatorio:</strong><br> Wha...</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong><br> Whether they reach the level of the Buddha or become an oni, everyone eventually hits their limit.</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong><br> Speaking for myself, I find it an incredible waste.</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong><br> Your spear may have grown sharper,<br> but as a Lancer, you have grown weaker.</p><p><strong>Lancer of Purgatorio:</strong><br> How... How dare yoooooou!?<br> You&#39;ll pay for this, Inshun!</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong><br> Farewell, Purgatorio.</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong><br> ...What a disappointment. To think I would be no more than a common highwayman if I fell from grace...</p><p><strong>Lancer of Purgatorio:</strong></p><p>Urk... Ghh...</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong><br> Phew, there we go.<br> Now that was a good simulation.</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong><br> Lady Mash, would you be so kind as to turn the simulator off now? ...Lady Mash?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I don&#39;t think we&#39;re in the simulator.</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong><br> ...Are you sure?</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong><br> They called me here so suddenly that I simply assumed this was some sort of emergency training...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I think this is just a dream.</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong><br> I see. Just another dream sequence, huh.<br> ...Wait. A dream!?</p><hr><p><strong>Inshun:</strong><br> Ahh...</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong><br> I never thought this would only turn out to be a dream I shared with you, Master!</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong><br> Hmm... Well, I suppose that is all right.</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong><br> If the only life I took was my own,<br> surely no one could be upset about that!</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong><br> Indeed, I believe they refer to this as a win-win-win!</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong><br> ...No?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> All&#39;s well that ends well!</p><hr><p><strong>Inshun:</strong><br> Right!</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong><br> Now then, I think I will have to try dueling Lady Musashi as soon as I wake up...</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong><br> Otherwise, all the effort Purgatorio put into his anti-Musashi techniques will go to waste.</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong><br> Still, there is one thing this incident has assured me of, Master.</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong><br> I am now certain that I truly am the best version of myself!</p>', 188);
