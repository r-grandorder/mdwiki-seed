I have to make breakfast.&quot;</p><p>I get up and get changed.</p><p>I can&#39;t avoid looking at the cloth wrapped around my left arm.</p><hr><p>&quot;.........All right.&quot;</p><p>I swing my arm as a warm-up exercise.</p><p>It&#39;s fine.</p><p>It rises up to my shoulders, as I intended.</p><p>It&#39;s getting better day by day.</p><p>There&#39;s still no sensation, but at this rate...</p><hr><p>&quot;What&#39;re you doing, Shirou? Breakfast is already over.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Huh? What? What?&quot;</p><hr><p>Illya is in front of me.</p><p>I should be in the living room, but I&#39;m in the shed for some reason.</p><hr><p>&quot;Are you listening to me, Shirou? I&#39;m asking what you&#39;re doing here.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Y\u2015\u2015\u2015Yeah, I&#39;m listening. Good morning, Illya. What a strange place to meet up.&quot;</p><hr><p>......Hm.</p><p>That was an odd reply on my part.</p><p>It seems I&#39;m not awake yet.</p><hr><p>&quot;Shirou? You&#39;re not feeling well?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Huh? Oh, no. It&#39;s just that I&#39;m only half awake, so give me a minute.&quot;</p><p>I shake my head.</p><p>My body is dead tired, but my sleepiness goes away.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015All right. So, answering your question, I don&#39;t have any business here. I just made a stupid mistake because I was half-asleep.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I see. Then let&#39;s go to the living room! I&#39;ll prepare your breakfast.&quot;</p><p>Illya happily runs across the yard.</p><hr><p>The sky is nice.</p><p>It&#39;s bright blue, as if trying to wash away yesterday&#39;s gloomy air.</p><p>I take a deep breath, and the cold, refreshing air fills my lungs.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Hm? Did Illya just say she&#39;ll make breakfast?&quot;</p><p>That&#39;s the first thing I say after I&#39;m fully awake.</p><hr><p>Illya&#39;s breakfast... I&#39;m looking forward to it, but I&#39;m also worried at the same time.</p><p>I&#39;m pretty sure that Illya has never even held a knife before, let alone cooked.</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh... I should go keep an eye on her.&quot;</p><p>I run across the prickling grass to the living room.</p><p>And I&#39;m astonished once again.</p><p>I must&#39;ve been really out of it.</p><p>What was I thinking, coming here in my bare feet?</p><hr><p>Four minutes after Illya...</p><p>I get up on the porch after wiping my feet.</p><p>&quot;Oh, Senpai.&quot;</p><p>I run into Sakura as she comes out of the living room.</p><hr><p>&quot;Good morning, Sakura. ...I&#39;m sorry about this morning. I overslept, and it was past eight when I noticed.&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>...?</p><p>Maybe she didn&#39;t hear me. She&#39;s just looking blankly at my face.</p><hr><p>&quot;Sakura?&quot;</p><p>I reach out, afraid that she&#39;s sick again.</p><p>Then.</p><p>&quot;G-Good morning, Senpai!&quot;</p><p>Or maybe she isn&#39;t, because she greets me with lots of energy.</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh, you&#39;re full of energy. So I&#39;m guessing you feel well?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Y-Yes, I&#39;m doing great, thanks to you. You gave me energy!&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...?&quot;</p><p>Sakura sounds awkward.</p><p>...Being energetic is a good thing, but I get uneasy seeing her so restless.</p><hr><p>&quot;What&#39;s wrong, Sakura? You&#39;re acting weird. First of all, what do you mean by me giving you energy?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Um\u2015\u2015\u2015well, um, last night...&quot;</p><p>&quot;In your room...&quot;</p><p>Sakura trails off, blushing furiously.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Oh.&quot;</p><p>I remember now.</p><p>No, there&#39;s no way I can forget about it.</p><p>Last night...</p><p>I had sex with Sakura.</p><hr><p>And it was our second time.</p><p>We did it more furiously than the first time, and I lusted for Sakura&#39;s body.</p><hr><p>&quot;Uh\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015um.&quot;</p><p>Blood rushes to my head in an instant.</p><p>I almost think that there&#39;s no blood left below my neck.</p><hr><p>&quot;S-Sakura... The thing last night...&quot;</p><p>That wasn&#39;t a dream, right?</p><p>Sakura is still blushing, but she shakes her head and looks at me critically.</p><hr><p>&quot;...!!!!&quot;</p><p>Amazing.</p><p>I thought my face couldn&#39;t get any hotter, but I guess I was wrong.</p><p>...Um, last night was amazing.</p><hr><p>Sakura&#39;s service, our animalistic sex...</p><p>It was so stimulating that my mind labeled the event a dream and filed it away in the corner of my memory\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015no!</p><hr><p>&quot;Sakura. Um... I&#39;m sorry I was rough yesterday.&quot;</p><p>Ignoring the blazing heat I feel, I apologize.</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015Okay. But I was happy, Senpai.&quot;</p><p>Sakura smiles and gives a lethal reply.</p><hr><p>&quot;Uh\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015um.&quot;</p><p>She got me.</p><p>Sakura&#39;s so cute that I want to push her down right here.</p><hr><p>I would&#39;ve lost it for real if the sound of the TV hadn&#39;t come from the living room, and...</p><p>&quot;Shirou? Breakfast&#39;s ready.&quot;</p><p>...And if Illya hadn&#39;t called for me at exactly the right time.</p><hr><p>&quot;S-So I&#39;m going to go eat breakfast! I-I&#39;ll talk to you later about this!&quot;</p><p>I pivot like a robot and head to the living room.</p><p>My limbs move awkwardly as I force down my desires.</p><hr><h2 id="scene-01-illya-s-breakfast" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#scene-01-illya-s-breakfast" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Scene 01 Illya&#39;s breakfast</h2><p>&quot;Here&#39;s your breakfast, Shirou!&quot;</p><p>Illya hands me a plate as soon as I enter the living room.</p><p>On the plate are blackened toast, a runny sunny-side up egg, and cut tomatoes.</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh, thanks.&quot;</p><p>My head&#39;s still dizzy, but I sit down at my usual spot and start biting on the toast.</p><p>I decline to comment on the toast, but the egg is done pretty well. Maybe she copied someone, or perhaps Tohsaka taught her.</p><p>Anyway, I have to give her a perfect score if this is her first time cooking.</p><hr><p>&quot;It&#39;s good.&quot;</p><p>I crunch on the toast.</p><p>Illya doesn&#39;t seem happy or proud, but simply watches me in satisfaction.</p><hr><p>I&#39;m not giving in to her happy mood, but I decide not to ask why the toast feels like coal.</p><p>It&#39;s good.</p><p>Having your toast black or hard is a matter of personal preference.</p><hr><p>&quot;It is a problem. You&#39;ll get sick if you eat something burned like that.&quot;</p><p>&quot;You idiot. The burned spots are the best, whether it&#39;s rice or toast.&quot;</p><p>&quot;...Hey. Are you all right, Emiya-kun?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I&#39;m saying it&#39;s good. And I guess doing it rough is all right.&quot;</p><p>&quot;You must really be half-asleep. This isn&#39;t time to be saying such carefree things, you know?&quot;</p><hr><p>Tohsaka looks at the TV.</p><p>The TV is on, showing the morning news.</p><hr><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Is this deja vu?</p><p>The news seems to be a story I&#39;ve already seen\u2015\u2015\u2015and my mind sharpens up.</p><hr><p>The captions on the screen.</p><p>An incidence of unexplained comas occurred in Shinto last night.</p><p>The residents lost consciousness overnight.</p><p>It&#39;s being treated just like the other mysterious comas, but it&#39;s different from before.</p><p>The area of the incident is 50 meters in diameter.</p><p>It used to only happen in one building at a time, but the damage is spread much further now.</p><hr><p>...And that&#39;s not the only problem.</p><p>At the end of the report...</p><p>Beside the triple-digit number of victims is a new list called &quot;missing people&quot;.</p><hr><p>&quot;Tohsaka, this is...&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes. Fourteen missing people. I&#39;m sure there&#39;ll be more once they look into it. Well, it looks like about a tenth of the people were completely swallowed.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>My mind freezes.</p><p>I unconsciously...</p><hr><p>&quot;Do you get it now? I don&#39;t know if this is Zouken or the shadow&#39;s doing, but it makes no difference to the fact that there are more victims now.</p><p>At this rate, a whole section of the town will be swallowed in a few days.&quot;</p><hr><p>Squeeze my left arm.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Tohsaka. Are the missing people dead?&quot;</p><p>I ask to confirm.</p><p>Tohsaka looks away, which is answer enough.</p><hr><p>&quot;...That&#39;s all. I understand how you feel, but feeling guilty can come later.</p><p>Look, they&#39;re starting to do as they please because they think we can&#39;t do anything about it. They can do ridiculous things because they&#39;re taking us lightly.</p><p>So I don&#39;t even need to say what we need to do, right?&quot;</p><hr><p>Tohsaka quietly gets up.</p><p>...There&#39;s only one place she could be going.</p><p>Tohsaka does not urge me to join her, but goes ahead to the dojo.</p><hr><h2 id="scene-02-determination" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#scene-02-determination" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Scene 02 Determination</h2><p>&quot;So. First off, how&#39;s your arm doing, Shirou?&quot;</p><p>Tohsaka cuts right to the chase when I get to the dojo.</p><hr><p>&quot;Well, I can move it fine. But that&#39;s not what you&#39;re asking me, right?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Right. I&#39;m asking you if you understand Archer&#39;s arm.&quot;</p><p>Illya is watching us silently.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>...I swear Tohsaka doesn&#39;t know what this arm is.</p><p>She doesn&#39;t know about the fear I felt last night.</p><p>It&#39;ll be over for me if I take this cloth off.</p><p>She doesn&#39;t know my body will be destroyed if I let this arm free, let alone use it.</p><hr><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015I recall the sensation.</p><p>Unavoidable death.</p><p>It felt like being buried alive.</p><p>Utter obliteration, where the world is covered beneath something mysterious and ends in silence.</p><hr><p>After just a glimpse of it, my mind repeated to itself in terror...</p><p>That I cannot use this arm.</p><p>I&#39;ll die if I use it.</p><p>Without some sort of miracle, I will definitely die.</p><hr><p>&quot;How is it? It&#39;s been a day since I transplanted my crest, so it should be working now.</p><p>Answer me. Do you know what you can do with Archer&#39;s arm?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015?&quot;</p><p>...Hold on.</p><p>Tohsaka&#39;s question is not exactly what I&#39;d been expecting.</p><p>I thought she wanted to know if I could use the arm.</p><hr><p>&quot;Um... so you&#39;re not asking me if I can suppress his arm, but if I know what his Noble Phantasm is?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;O-Of course! It&#39;ll be terrible if you use Archer&#39;s arm, so there&#39;s no way I&#39;m going to let you! Or what!? Were you thinking about using it!?&quot;</p><p>Oh.</p><p>Tohsaka&#39;s seriously angry.</p><hr><p>&quot;Uh... No, but I thought that&#39;s where the conversation was going...&quot;</p><p>&quot;What are you talking about!?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...Geez. Let me tell you. I forbid you to use Archer&#39;s arm, no matter the situation.</p><p>And don&#39;t even consider using it without my permission.</p><p>...Um, you&#39;re taking Archer&#39;s place, so it&#39;ll trouble me if you die.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>Tohsaka&#39;s serious.</p><p>...I take back what I said earlier.</p><p>She knows.</p><p>She&#39;s a much better magus than I am.</p><p>She knows more than me about what&#39;ll happen if I free this arm.</p><hr><p>&quot;So, how is it? Do you understand what Archer&#39;s Noble Phantasm is?&quot;</p><p>She repeats the question.</p><p>I don&#39;t know what kind of an answer Tohsaka is expecting, but...</p><p>&quot;Geez. Why don&#39;t you just tell her, Shirou? That you knew what it is since his arm has been transplanted.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Wait, is that true, Shirou?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Ugh\u2015\u2015\u2015well, I think so. Archer&#39;s Noble Phantasm is his projection magecraft, and it&#39;s reproducing weapons, right?&quot;</p><hr><p>I have a vague idea, but I can&#39;t be sure, so I&#39;m still half in doubt.</p><hr><p>&quot;...I guess I didn&#39;t need to be so nervous. So, you&#39;re already connected to it.</p><p>That&#39;s helpful in its own way, but why didn&#39;t you say anything, Illya? If Shirou knew about Archer&#39;s projection magecraft, I didn&#39;t even need to ask him.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;You didn&#39;t ask. You&#39;re the one who wants Shirou to do projection, so it&#39;s your role to ask. It&#39;s nothing I should butt in on.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;What&#39;s that? Are you going to say we&#39;re stopping after all that preparation?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;That&#39;s for you two to decide.</p><p>You&#39;ll certainly win if you can reproduce the gem sword. That&#39;s why I gave you a hand. But I only helped you because it&#39;s my obligation. It&#39;s not because I agree with your plan.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;......?&quot;</p><p>Um...</p><p>Judging by their conversation, Tohsaka wants me to project something\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>&quot;Can I say something? So in short, you have something you want reproduced?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Yup. I need you to reproduce something for me.</p><p>We can&#39;t match Saber or that shadow. So we have to create something in place of Servants, a Conceptual Weapon that exceeds the Servants.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Conceptual Weapon\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015? Is that the fixed magical item that executes a set phenomenon?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes. It&#39;s an Outbreaker that defeats its opponent using the weight of its concept rather than physical damage. I&#39;m going to have you project a special Conceptual Weapon that has been passed down through the Tohsaka family.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;The goal is to make something that can match Saber&#39;s Noble Phantasm.</p><p>You saw Saber&#39;s Noble Phantasm that defeated Berserker, right?</p><p>In terms of raw power, Saber&#39;s weapon is the strongest.</p><p>I&#39;m sure even the shadow would be destroyed by a blow from her Noble Phantasm, and we can&#39;t dodge or block it if it&#39;s used against us.</p><p>Conversely, we can manage a fight if we can make a sword that exceeds Saber&#39;s Noble Phantasm, even if it&#39;s an imitation that breaks easily.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>...It&#39;s a sound argument, and a natural conclusion.</p><p>If Saber&#39;s Noble Phantasm is their strongest weapon, we just need to prepare something that outperforms it.</p><p>Make a weapon that is stronger than your enemy&#39;s.</p><p>It&#39;s the simplest and surest way to win.</p><p>But.</p><hr><p>&quot;...I don&#39;t know. I can&#39;t project such a strong Noble Phantasm. No, first of all, I&#39;ve never succeeded at projection magecraft\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Yes. I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve never been able to do the kind of projection that we magi are familiar with.</p><p>But your projection isn&#39;t on that level. You were merely doing it wrong because you didn&#39;t know how.</p><p>But you now have Archer&#39;s knowledge, so you just need to trace it. With Archer as your example, you will succeed.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>Tohsaka sounds confident.</p><p>But even so, I have no confidence in myself.</p><hr><p>&quot;Look. I&#39;ve told you before, but you&#39;re a magus that uses projection, not strengthening.</p><p>You might not be able to make a replica with the same power as the original, but you should get close to it if you follow Archer&#39;s theory.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Our role is to back you up.</p><p>We&#39;ll prepare the materials to be as close to the original as possible.</p><p>Illya is analyzing the blueprint that you&#39;ll be using during projection, and I&#39;m preparing the materials that were used to make the real weapon.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...It&#39;ll be a little longer, but it&#39;s up to you after that. If you can reproduce my master&#39;s pass, even if it&#39;s just the shape, we have a chance of victory against Zouken.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;......&quot;</p><p>Um.</p><p>So they&#39;re going to prepare the blueprint and the materials, and I&#39;m supposed to put it together?</p><p>I have no problem if we can defeat Zouken that way.</p><p>I&#39;ll happily go with her plan, but\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>&quot;Let&#39;s assume I really can project this weapon.</p><p>If that&#39;s the case, we won&#39;t need any materials. If you show me the original, I can copy it.</p><p>We can try it right now instead of waiting for you to get ready.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Are you stupid? If it were that simple, I would&#39;ve had you try it two days ago.</p><p>Look, you&#39;ll be able to project once at most, and the projected weapon is certain to have flaws.</p><p>But that&#39;s meaningless. We can&#39;t have you make an imitation like the failures in the shed that look the same on the outside, but contain nothing on the inside.&quot;</p><p>&quot;...Hm. But I can only make such imitations.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;That&#39;s why we&#39;re backing you up.</p><p>We&#39;re preparing materials that are as close to the real thing as possible to compensate for the required knowledge and magical energy, and have you fix it in place with your image.</p><p>It&#39;s simple addition. We add your image and the materials we prepared to achieve a better result.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...Well, I&#39;m sure we don&#39;t need the material or the blueprint if you use Archer&#39;s arm to project it, but that&#39;s not possible.</p><p>This is the only way to prepare a weapon without relying on that arm.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;So we&#39;re strengthening what&#39;s there using projection, huh?</p><p>...Yeah, that does sound...&quot;</p><p>It sounds plausible, and we might be able to do it with practice.</p><hr><p>&quot;But I don&#39;t know if it&#39;ll succeed or not.</p><p>I wasn&#39;t able to consistently use strengthening magecraft until I became a Master. I don&#39;t think I can do something like that on the spot.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh, that&#39;s all right.</p><p>I&#39;m going to have you train your projection and practice retrieving Archer&#39;s knowledge.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...I see. That&#39;s good for me too, but you look happy, Tohsaka.&quot;</p><p>&quot;No way. I&#39;ve been playing with building blocks with Illya for a while, so I&#39;m just thinking how refreshing it is to talk with a bad student.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;......&quot;</p><p>...Ugh. I get the chills, recalling the weird sensation from yesterday.</p><p>Tohsaka got me naked, came close to me, and stuck her fingers in me.</p><hr><p>Nothing happened then, but if we&#39;re going to do that again today...</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015Ugh.&quot;</p><p>I might get a big scolding from Sakura, resting in her room.</p><hr><p>&quot;So, do you get it now, with all jokes aside?</p><p>I want to confirm everything one last time.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Confirm?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;I&#39;m asking if you&#39;re okay with this plan.</p><p>We&#39;ll be relying on your projection.</p><p>I won&#39;t let you use Archer&#39;s arm, but his influence will still poison you as you imitate his magecraft. Knowing that, are you still okay with this plan?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Hey, I have no complaints if we can defeat Zouken. And it&#39;s promising if you&#39;re the one training me in magecraft.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...I&#39;ll be honest here. Using Archer&#39;s magecraft means releasing the seal on his arm.</p><p>In short, I&#39;m telling you to take off that Shroud while we&#39;re training projection.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>My mind freezes.</p><p>Take the Shroud off?</p><p>Release this arm that terrified me, made me cry, and made me shake in the corner, just by loosening the cloth?</p><hr><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015I don&#39;t even need to think about it.</p><p>I...</p><hr><h2 id="scene-03-noble-fool" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#scene-03-noble-fool" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Scene 03 Noble fool</h2><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Okay.

I need to take this cloth off, right?&quot;</p><hr><p>And I manage to nod.</p><hr><p>&quot;......I see. So it&#39;s as I expected.&quot;</p><p>&quot;What is it, Tohsaka? Is my answer not good enough?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;No. I just reaffirmed that threatening you is meaningless.</p><p>I didn&#39;t think you&#39;d be okay with taking the Shroud off, but your answer is satisfactory.&quot;</p><p>Tohsaka looks away, clearly displeased.</p><hr><p>&quot;Hey, you&#39;re acting strange, Tohsaka.

But, Sakura. He would take the Shroud off himself even if I don&#39;t tell him to. I realized it when I was talking to him earlier.</p><p>......Honestly. In the end, he&#39;ll take it off like it&#39;s nothing, no matter how strongly I warn him.&quot;</p><p>Tohsaka replies in a powerless voice.</p><hr><p>&quot;Eh... Nee-san?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes. I know that, so I had to suggest a plan that wouldn&#39;t make him take it off.</p><p>If he knows we can manage without having him take the Shroud off, he won&#39;t do it unless it&#39;s a last resort. So my role is to make him create a weapon within set limitations.</p><p>I&#39;ll have him rest after that. I&#39;ll even confine him, keeping him out of combat until the Holy Grail War is over.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>She&#39;s telling the truth.</p><p>Tohsaka Rin is showing as much consideration as she can.</p><p>...But that is her mind as Tohsaka Rin.</p><p>As the successor of an old family lineage, Sakura knows the other side of Rin.</p><hr><p>&quot;Nee-san. I understand that you&#39;re concerned for Senpai&#39;s safety.</p><p>But that&#39;s it. If you find out that you cannot beat Grandfather with the current method, you will end up using him.</p><p>You&#39;re a magus of Tohsaka.

If our current method fails, and if Zouken and the shadow continue their rampage\u2015\u2015\u2015I&#39;ll have Shirou use Archer&#39;s arm. It&#39;s only natural if his life is the only thing at stake.&quot;</p><p>...She makes a declaration with her head held high.</p><hr><p>&quot;...That&#39;s selfish of you. Senpai never wanted the Holy Grail. He became a Master by chance. So it&#39;s wrong to force him to keep fighting.&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Hmph. It seems you misunderstand, Sakura.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Look. I&#39;m not forcing him, and even if that&#39;s true, Shirou has no right to object. His life was saved because I gave him my Archer&#39;s arm. But he hasn&#39;t tried to cut it off yet.</p><p>That means his life is mine now.</p><p>He&#39;s my Archer as long as he doesn&#39;t get rid of his arm.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Do you get it? Shirou is my familiar until this war ends.</p><p>There&#39;s no reason for you to butt in.

I don\u2019t know if you can tell, but you\u2019re really pale.\u201D</p><p>\u2026My body feels heavy.<br> I can still lay out the futon in my current state, probably because it\u2019s a habit.</p><p>\u201C---\u201D<br> I fall onto the futon.<br> Looking up at the ceiling gives me enough composure to make me think.</p><p>\u201C---\u201D<br> I think with my weary mind.</p><p>I think about my left arm.<br> The loosened Shroud.<br> I was in so much fear and pain last night, but today was like nothing.<br> I have no memory of anything being painful or scary, and the day ended in a flash.</p><p>The answer\u2019s right there if I seriously think about it.</p><p>I think about Illya.<br> She said she can\u2019t live with me.<br> She said she wants to, but can\u2019t.<br> She said she can\u2019t live long.<br> She said it as if it were common knowledge.</p><p>About that black shadow</p><p>I think about Sakura.<br> She is losing her freedom with each passing day.<br> It\u2019s because the crest worm is sucking the magical energy from her.<br> It\u2019s not Sakura\u2019s fault.<br> It\u2019s not her fault that her body\u2019s like that.<br> All I can do is to give my magical energy to her.<br> She should be able to maintain herself if I keep sharing my blood with her and give her plenty of magical energy.</p><p>I close my eyes.<br> Illya said saving everyone is impossible.<br> I can choose only one.<br> I\u2019ve already made my choice.</p><p>\u201C\u2026Senpai? Are you back\u2026?\u201D</p><p>I hear a voice from the hallway.</p><p>\u201CI\u2019m awake. Come in, Sakura.\u201D<br> I raise my body. I want to see Sakura even though my head\u2019s not working.</p><p>\u201CExcuse me. I\u2019m sorry, but I came since I heard sounds. \u2026Um, I never told you good night.\u201D</p><p>Sakura is like always.<br> She\u2019s reserved, considerate, doesn\u2019t say what she wants, is at a loss, and still smiles at me.<br> She became so surprisingly beautiful in the past year that I want to embrace her when we\u2019re alone. And she\u2019s someone I promised to keep protecting.</p><p>\u201CUm, that\u2019s all. I feel well, thanks to you. I can sleep well tonight, so I wanted to tell you that there\u2019s nothing to worry about.\u201D</p><p>Sakura is like always.<br> But that\u2019s just a matter of course.<br> She can\u2019t be different.<br> It\u2019s not as if she\u2019s blushing and snuggling up to me like before.</p><p>\u201C\u2026Senpai? Um, am I disturbing you\u2026?</p><p>You look really tired and sleepy\u2026\u201D</p><p>\u201CSakura. Were you sleeping like I told you?\u201D<br> \u201C\u2026?\u201D<br> I just ask what\u2019s bothering me.<br> My tired head can\u2019t think at all.</p><p>\u201CYes, I was sound asleep.</p><p>I had another scary dream, but I was able to bear it since you were there until I fell asleep.\u201D</p><p>A scary dream.<br> I have to ask her what kind of dream it was, but\u2026</p><p>\u201C---\u201D</p><p>I can\u2019t say anything, reaching out for her long hair instead.</p><p>\u201CU-Um, Senpai\u2026?\u201D</p><p>\u201C---Come here, Sakura.\u201D</p><p>I lower my hand to her shoulder and pull her to me.</p><p>\u201CU-Um, Senpai, I-I-I\u2026!\u201D</p><p>\u201CYou don\u2019t want to?\u201D<br> I whisper as I hold her in my arms.</p><p>Sakura doesn\u2019t fight back, but buries her face in my chest.</p><p>\u201C---Yes. I\u2019m very happy.\u201D</p><p>She relaxes and leans on me.</p><p>And so I hold Sakura very, very tight.<br> I can\u2019t hold myself back.</p><p>\u201C\u2026\u2026!\u201D</p><p>I just wanted to do this with Sakura.<br> I wanted to hold Sakura many times until I lose consciousness.<br> And I actually do.<br> Sakura\u2019s voice does not reach my brain.<br> I can only hear my own breathing.</p><p>It\u2019s Sakura that needs to be satisfied,<br> but I want it more than her.</p><p>There\u2019s no sense of time.<br> I tried to keep having this nightmare until morning, but the power in my body goes off right away.</p><p>I fall asleep holding Sakura\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201CMm, mm\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 Senpai, I\uE012\u201D</p><p>I feel Sakura\u2019s warmth on my hand as I fall asleep.</p><p>\u2026And my calm self speaks.<br> The haze clears from my mind.</p><p>---What good did this do?</p><p>Maybe all you did was finally confirm a certain unease by indulging in Sakura.</p><h2 id="scene-14-nightmare-awakening" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#scene-14-nightmare-awakening" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Scene 14 Nightmare, awakening</h2><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015I&#39;m seeing the scary dream again.</p><hr><p>&quot;Something&quot; is walking.</p><p>Something scary that kills people whenever it walks.</p><p>...I&#39;m watching it from behind.</p><p>I don&#39;t want to watch, but I can&#39;t look away.</p><hr><p>This is a nightmare.</p><p>A nightmare I&#39;m seeing over and over.</p><hr><p>But to be honest, I feel a sense of intimacy with it.</p><p>It was scary at first, but I&#39;m getting used to it after a while.</p><p>Most importantly, that thing does not have an evil mind.</p><p>That thing is something similar to me that merely eats in a different way.</p><hr><p>&quot; &quot;</p><p>&quot; &quot;</p><p>&quot; !&quot;</p><hr><p>...It&#39;s the same tonight.</p><p>Why do they all come?</p><p>Does it release some scent that attracts men?</p><p>No matter how many it kills,</p><p>no matter how many days it continues to kill,</p><p>the food comes to it.</p><hr><p>It eats.</p><p>It smashed up the food when it first started, but it must be getting the hang of it recently.</p><p>There&#39;s no need to smash up the food.</p><p>It just needs to pull it in and swallow it.</p><p>It can eat the body and the soul like that.</p><hr><p>Sing and go.</p><p>It&#39;s in a good mood tonight.</p><p>It has never shown any emotion, but it seems to be happy tonight.</p><hr><p>I feel an affinity with it.</p><p>I&#39;m very happy tonight too.</p><p>Because this is the first time.</p><p>Senpai asked for my body for the first time.</p><p>...Yes.</p><p>There&#39;s nothing to be afraid of now.</p><p>I keep seeing this nightmare, but it&#39;s all right.</p><p>The world looks so beautiful and kind now that Senpai&#39;s looking at me.</p><hr><p>So I feel like continuing this bad dream, and going to look for another meal.</p><p>But...</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015You are certainly working hard.
