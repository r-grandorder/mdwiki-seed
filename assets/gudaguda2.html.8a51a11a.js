I wish I could have something sweet...</p><p><strong>Hijikata:</strong><br> Quit your whining.</p><p><strong>Hijikata:</strong><br> Rice with hot water and pickles is enough.<br> It tastes fine.</p><p><strong>Okita:</strong><br> No, I think you just stockpiled too many pickles.</p><p><strong>Okita:</strong><br> I mean, what&#39;s up with the storehouse being completely filled with pickles!?</p><p><strong>Okita:</strong><br> It should have been filled with military provisions!<br> Honestly, spending all our war funds on pickles...!</p><p><strong>Okita:</strong><br> Man cannot live on pickles alone!</p><p><strong>Okita:</strong><br> Argh. How does it happen that Mr. Hijikata and I are the only members of the Shinsengumi to manifest in this world!?</p><p><strong>Okita:</strong><br> This isn&#39;t the Shinsengumi...<br> It&#39;s like the Shinsen-pair!</p><p><strong>Hijikata:</strong><br> Shut up. There&#39;s plenty of members.</p><p><strong>Mini Nobu?:</strong><br> Nobu!</p><p><strong>Okita:</strong><br> For the last time, what exactly are these Mini Nobus!?</p><p><strong>Okita:</strong><br> Eh? You&#39;re saying they&#39;re the righteous Mini Nobus who escaped because they started to question Oda&#39;s ways?</p><p><strong>Okita:</strong><br> I didn&#39;t realize those things could be ambitious!<br> Even if it&#39;s just a tiny bit...</p><p><strong>Okita:</strong><br> Argh.

How are you feeling?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Rice with hot water and pickles... How refined!</p><p><strong>Hijikata:</strong><br> Hm? Aren&#39;t you...the brat hanging around Okita? What business does the dog of the Oda Bakufu have with us?</p><p><strong>Okita:</strong><br> M-Master!? You came!</p><p><strong>Okita:</strong><br> I knew it...I knew it...<br> Master&#39;s too smart not to see what an idiot Nobbu is!</p><p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong><br> WRONG! Couldn&#39;t be further from the truth!</p><p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong><br> Fujimaru only came with me to make fun of this sad shack standing in this shanty city!</p><p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong><br> Whoa, so shabby! This place really is sad! Okita, if you stick around here, you&#39;ll die of a common cold!</p><p><strong>Chacha:</strong><br> Chacha also came to ridicule this place!</p><p><strong>Chacha:</strong><br> Huh... So this is what it looks like. Touring the city and seeing old, sad ruins like this is so hip and fun! Even if it is with the Shinsengumi!</p><p><strong>Okita:</strong><br> \u201CRuins\u201D? \u201CShack\u201D? You&#39;ve gone too far this time, Nobbu!<br> I will not allow you to deceive our purehearted Master!</p><p><strong>Hijikata:</strong><br> Hey, quiet there.

You just stay right there in bed and don&#39;t worry about a thing.</p><p><strong>Chacha:</strong><br> Silly kids should listen to grown-ups.</p><p><strong>Chacha:</strong><br> Chacha will watch over you and make you all better!<br> You just rest as much as you want!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Yep, you need to lie down.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I&#39;ll bring rice porridge and pickles.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Senpai. Do you have a moment?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Mash?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Where have you been?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Sorry for disappearing so long.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...It&#39;s just, while you were heading towards the Ikedaya,<br> I asked Da Vinci to perform an analysis of this realm...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I&#39;d rather not speak of it here. Is there somewhere we can talk privately?</p><p><strong>Chacha:</strong><br> Hm? Do as you please. Chacha will watch over her. Chacha is the best at nursing people back to health.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> If you say so... Take care of Okita, then.</p><p><strong>Chacha:</strong><br> Yes! Okita will get better in no time with Chacha on the case! If you want, Chacha can go on stage and sing lullabies.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> You&#39;re like a tiny mommy.</p><p><strong>Chacha:</strong><br> Don&#39;t say dumb things like that! Is it just &#39;cause Chacha is a Berserker!?</p><p><strong>Chacha:</strong><br> Just go do your thingy!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I had Da Vinci research this realm, and it apparently turned out to be a bit unusual...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Hey, how&#39;s it going? I wasn&#39;t really interested in doing this, but Mash insisted, so I performed an analysis.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> What did you find out?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Isn&#39;t it the usual mess of a realm?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Well, I thought it was just like the last similar disaster you walked into, or just another Singularity...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> But let me cut to the chase: this realm is in a kind of stasis.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Stasis... Does that mean time won&#39;t go forward?<br> It can&#39;t move into the future?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> That&#39;s right. That place isn&#39;t a Singularity of a specific point in history, nor is it a time in history that&#39;s been altered.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> It is just a single point in time that&#39;s unconnected to the past, and to the future.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> I initially thought it was some parallel world&#39;s history that got derailed somewhere along the line.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> But it&#39;s not. It&#39;s a world where time has stopped there, and ONLY there. If we think of human history as a narrative spanning thousands of volumes...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> ...then that world would be like a series that ended only a single volume. It is...entirely unrelated to human history.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> A world that ends in a single volume...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> The Guda Guda Particle is a fuzzy concept, but this is actually the opposite... I can sense an unwavering will behind this.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> A strong will that&#39;s saying \u201Cit ends here,\u201D or \u201Cnothing beyond this point is necessary.\u201D</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Chacha:</strong><br> You dummy!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> That came from Okita&#39;s room!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Wait, Senpai!?<br> We&#39;ll call you back, Da Vinci!</p><p><strong>Hijikata:</strong><br> Wake up, Okita. It&#39;s time for battle. We are headed to Toba-Fushimi. The enemy has apparently gathered there.</p><p><strong>Chacha:</strong><br> Shut up, you muscle-brained, man-slaying, scary-faced jerk! She&#39;s in no shape to move! Get out!</p><p><strong>Okita:</strong><br> I-I&#39;m all right...! A burning fever is nothing to the powerful, invincible Okita...</p><p><strong>Okita:</strong></p><p>(Cough!?)</p><p><strong>Hijikata:</strong><br> If you&#39;re coughing up blood, then you must have plenty to spare. Obviously your lungs are strong. Good, then. The Oda lot have already assembled. Let&#39;s go.</p><p><strong>Chacha:</strong><br> No, no, no, it&#39;s not okay, dummy!<br> ...And you too!</p><p><strong>Chacha:</strong><br> Kids who catch a cold need to stay home and rest!</p><p><strong>Okita:</strong><br> Thank you for being concerned for me, Chacha.<br> But I...</p><p><strong>Okita:</strong><br> I am the Shinsengumi&#39;s First Unit Captain, Okita Souji.</p><p><strong>Okita:</strong><br> Now let&#39;s go, Master! I cannot allow Nobbu to be the only one to look cool!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Okita...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> ...Got it. Let&#39;s go.</p><p><strong>Chacha:</strong><br> ...Oh come on! You military stooges are all the same!</p><p><strong>Chacha:</strong><br> What&#39;s the point of pride and honor if they just get you killed!?</p><p><strong>Chacha:</strong><br> You&#39;re all stupid! Stupid stupidheads! No! You know what you are? Stupid dum-dum doodyheads!</p><p><strong>Chacha:</strong><br> Argh! Chacha can&#39;t deal with you anymore! Chacha&#39;s gonna wreck all your dummy plans from now on!</p><p><strong>Chacha:</strong><br> Oh, but first, here&#39;s some medicine for you, dummy, so take it after you eat! Brats!</p><p><strong>Okita:</strong><br> Chacha...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I wonder why she got so mad...</p><p><strong>Hijikata:</strong><br> Hmph. If she were one of us, she would have to commit seppuku for deserting us before a battle.</p><p><strong>Hijikata:</strong><br> Whatever. Shinsengumi, moving out.</p><p><strong>Mecha Nobbu:</strong><br> Nobu nobbuu!</p><p><strong>Saigou Edimori:</strong><br> Wahahahaha! What do you think of the new and incredible robot army that my United Satsuma has mass-produced for us!?</p><p><strong>Saigou Edimori:</strong><br> I had some time to tweak them a little, and so their production rate and performance went up by 20%! This is all thanks to our 24-hour workdays!</p><p><strong>Katsura Tesla:</strong><br> I see you&#39;re still not at all timid about breaking labor laws!</p><p><strong>Nobbu UFO:</strong><br> Nonononono bubububu!</p><p><strong>Katsura Tesla:</strong><br> And my new Choushu Industries superweapon is finally out of its prototype phase and in official production!</p><p><strong>Katsura Tesla:</strong><br> Even matchlock guns are no match against them!</p><p><strong>Nobukatsu:</strong><br> This is the indomitable strength of the Universal SatChou Alliance!</p><p><strong>Nobukatsu:</strong><br> Heh. This will be the end of Big Sister&#39;s reign!</p><p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong><br> Why you... So many variants of me crawling all over the place...</p><p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong><br> Hm? You guys are here too? What took you so long?<br> Can&#39;t you see that the enemy&#39;s all locked and loaded!?</p><p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong><br> Huh? Fujimaru, wasn&#39;t Chacha with you?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> She disappeared somewhere...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Something happened right before we left...</p><p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong><br> She was tending to Okita on her sickbed...!?</p><p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong><br> I see... Oh, that Chacha...</p><p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong><br> No matter. She&#39;ll be back when she gets hungry.</p><p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong><br> And you&#39;re... Uh, Hijikata, was it? Of the Shinsengumi?</p><p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong><br> Well, what&#39;s your assessment of the enemy, then?</p><p><strong>Hijikata:</strong><br> There&#39;s too many... Our only options would be to pin them down with a feint, and then have a separate unit flank them...</p><p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong><br> Oh-ho... I thought your little man-slayers club was all about playing at being soldiers, but maybe I was wrong. I had more or less the same idea, in fact.</p><p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong><br> I guess you&#39;ve got at least a little tactical sense.</p><p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong><br> But you&#39;re a bit lacking in numbers.</p><p><strong>Hijikata:</strong><br> ...So what? You work with what you&#39;ve got...<br> That is what war is about.</p><p><strong>Hijikata:</strong><br> Okita, you&#39;ll flank them.<br> I&#39;ll handle the feint at their front ranks.</p><p><strong>Okita:</strong><br> Underst\u2013<br> (Cough!?)</p><p><strong>Okita:</strong><br> N-no. It&#39;s fine! I&#39;m fine!</p><p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong><br> You are NOT fine.</p><p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong><br> Just hear me out: I&#39;ll lead the feint attack from the front. It&#39;s the best fit. Most of my troops carry matchlock guns, and aren&#39;t that mobile.</p><p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong><br> That leaves everyone else free for the flanking maneuver. What do you think? Pretty cunning, huh?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> A united front with Nobbu and the Shinsengumi!</p><p><strong>Okita:</strong><br> I-I see... That is a good idea, especially considering the source... We ARE understaffed... What do you think,<br> Mr. Hijikata?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Eh!? Nobbu had a good idea!?</p><p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong><br> What&#39;s that supposed to mean!? I don&#39;t wanna brag, but pretty much never lost a battle! (*Note: Nobunaga lost the battle of Kanegasaki, but we don&#39;t talk about that.)</p><p><strong>Hijikata:</strong><br> ...Fine. I guess that&#39;ll be better than losing...</p><p><strong>Hijikata:</strong><br> Nobunaga... After all your big talk, you&#39;d better not mess this up.</p><p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong><br> Of course. If you guys aren&#39;t careful, I&#39;ll take you all out together! So you&#39;d better head out like you&#39;re planning not to come back!</p><p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong><br> Fujimaru, what are you going to do?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Cooperate with the Shinsengumi.</p><p><strong>Okita:</strong><br> If Master&#39;s with us, there&#39;s nothing to fear!<br> Hijikata, let&#39;s go!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Cooperate with Nobbu.</p><p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong><br> Haha! Now you&#39;ll get a real lesson in my famous Three Line Formation!!!</p><p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong><br> This will be a glorious race to see who can win the greater honor on the battlefield!</p><p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong><br> Matchlock troops, ready yourselves!!!</p><p><strong>Hijikata:</strong><br> Yes, a race to glory!

Oh, Mr. Hijikata, Mr. Kondou, and I go way back.<br> We&#39;re like family.</p><p><strong>Okita:</strong><br> When we were young, I used to make him cry all the time!</p><p><strong>Okita:</strong><br> ...So what is it, Mr. Hijikata?</p><p><strong>Hijikata:</strong><br> No...never mind.</p><p><strong>Nobukatsu:</strong><br> Welcome, my elites of the Toyotomi Bakufu!</p><p><strong>Nobukatsu:</strong><br> To be able to command so many generals is something only the great Gold Demon Taikou, Lord Hideyoshi, could do!</p><p><strong>Gotou S\xE9tanta:</strong><br> Hey, I have to deal with you guys again?</p><p><strong>Mouri Medinaga:</strong><br> Shut up. I could say the same to you!<br> And why am I this Mouri character again!?</p><p><strong>Mouri Medinaga:</strong><br> Eh? This Mouri is completely different from the Mouri who ruled the Chugoku region? I don&#39;t care! I don&#39;t need to know inconsequential Warring States trivia!</p><p><strong>Sanada Emimura:</strong><br> Hmph...the red-armored Sanada. I see that you and I are not unrelated. I do have a bit of sympathy for his story.</p><p><strong>Sanada Emimura:</strong><br> His title\u2013\u201CThe Land of the Rising Sun&#39;s greatest warrior\u201D\u2013may be a bit much for me, though.</p><p><strong>Gotou S\xE9tanta:</strong><br> You seem a little...overenthusiastic about this...and what&#39;s with that mask?</p><p><strong>Sanada Emimura:</strong><br> Are you asking about my Rokumonsen? These are to pay the ferryman of the River Styx, which represents a Sanada warrior&#39;s resolve to\u2014</p><p><strong>Mysterious Chousokabe Heroine X:</strong><br> I see. Thank you for that oh-sooo-interesting tidbit!<br> But no more useless trivia!</p><p><strong>Mysterious Chousokabe Heroine X:</strong><br> We have assembled because we heard there is a Spring Saber Annihilation Festival being held to thin out the overpopulated Sabers!</p><p><strong>Akashi Ex:</strong><br> ...And I suggest we ignore anything this silly girl says. Please, pay her no mind.</p><p><strong>Akashi Ex:</strong><br> ... (Nom nom)<br> (These Akashiyaki dumplings are delicious.)</p><p><strong>Mouri Medinaga:</strong><br> I see we have two new faces!</p><p><strong>Mouri Medinaga:</strong><br> Oh, but that girl in the black outfit is cute.</p><p><strong>Nobukatsu:</strong><br> Now then, Sun Fortress Five! I&#39;m leaving this place in your hands! I&#39;m off to offer Chacha to Lord Taikou!</p><p><strong>Gotou S\xE9tanta:</strong><br> ...Um, are we good with this?<br> The little lady will die...</p><p><strong>Mouri Medinaga:</strong><br> She was so cute too...<br> It&#39;s unfortunate, but there&#39;s nothing we can do.</p><p><strong>Sanada Emimura:</strong><br> Ah...we Servants have no choice but to obey the one who summons us. And that man...</p><p><strong>Mysterious Chousokabe Heroine X:</strong><br> No, but still...<br> Wait, more importantly, what&#39;s \u201CChousokabe\u201D?</p><p><strong>Gotou S\xE9tanta:</strong><br> Hey. The enemy&#39;s here... My heart&#39;s really not in this, but I guess we don&#39;t have a choice...</p><p><strong>Gotou S\xE9tanta:</strong><br> Time to show you the fighting prowess of this so-called reincarnation of Marici!</p><p><strong>Gotou S\xE9tanta:</strong><br> ...I still don&#39;t know why I&#39;m the only one with a childhood name, but whatever...</p><p><strong>Mouri Medinaga:</strong><br> Hee hee...

Huh!? I&#39;m detecting a crudely made, overproduced, inferior unit born of mass production Saber response!</p><p><strong>Mysterious Chousokabe Heroine X:</strong><br> How come Sakura Saber gets to be a \u26065 Saber and I&#39;m stuck as an Assass\u2013(Cough, cough)</p><p><strong>Akashi Ex:</strong><br> (Huff, huff) (This shiruko is good, too.) Japanese sweets are wonderful... They fill my heart with sugary goodness.</p><p><strong>Sanada Emimura:</strong><br> Hm...the enemy is coming from the front, while the castle that we must protect is behind us. We all know what to do.</p><p><strong>Sanada Emimura:</strong><br> Hey everyone. Back away a bit.<br> I&#39;m doing this\u2014</p><p><strong>Sanada Emimura:</strong><br> ...I am the bone of my sword.</p><p><strong>Gotou S\xE9tanta:</strong><br> Hey, what the hell are you doing!? Whoa!</p><p><strong>Mysterious Chousokabe Heroine X:</strong><br> Th-this power...!?</p><p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong><br> The more I look at it, the more absurdly overwrought this castle looks! As their former boss, I am embarrassed for them! They lack wabi! They lack saaabiii!</p><p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong><br> Even the great Rikyu is spinning in his grave.</p><p><strong>Okita:</strong><br> We&#39;ve almost reached the Sun Fortress, or whatever it&#39;s called. That&#39;s where they&#39;re keeping Chacha.</p><p><strong>Okita:</strong><br> Fortunately, it&#39;s situated on level terrain. Easy to attack, difficult to defend. This will be an easy win, Master!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Um, actually...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Is that...</p><p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong><br> Hm? What&#39;s that sound? An earthquake?</p><p><strong>Okita:</strong><br> Ehhhhhh!? Th-that&#39;s!?</p><p><strong>Sanada Emimura:</strong><br> This is Sanada&#39;s pride and joy: Super Fortress...</p><p><strong>Sanada Emimura:</strong><br> ...Emiyamaru!</p><p><strong>Sanada Emimura:</strong><br> I have no intention of losing!</p><p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong><br> What the actual hell is that!? Well, taking the castle&#39;s position into consideration, the fort&#39;s placement is tactically sound...</p><p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong><br> That red-masked weirdo...<br> He&#39;s not one to be taken lightly!</p><p><strong>Sanada Emimura:</strong><br> Ha. Such praise from the Demon King of the Sixth Heaven is an honor!</p><p><strong>Mouri Medinaga:</strong><br> Eh? Don&#39;t tell me you&#39;re a Warring States buff?</p><p><strong>Sanada Emimura:</strong><br> No, but the Heroic Spirit that has fused with me is shouting within me. Shouting that I must protect that castle.</p><p><strong>Gotou S\xE9tanta:</strong><br> Yeah, I actually agree with you. I wonder why... This feeling... It&#39;s not really regret... It&#39;s almost like a sense of pride bubbling up...</p><p><strong>Mouri Medinaga:</strong><br> I hate things like that! Things like pride and romanticizing warfare... Men are so dumb!</p><p><strong>Mouri Medinaga:</strong><br> Although... Was I Mouri Medinaga?<br> I do feel like I need to try my best here for some reason.</p><p><strong>Okita:</strong><br> Mouri? Does that mean you&#39;re Choushu...?</p><p><strong>Mouri Medinaga:</strong><br> Oh! Are we doing that bit now!?</p><p><strong>Mouri Medinaga:</strong><br> No, I may be Mouri, but apparently I&#39;m not THAT Mouri! Honestly, I don&#39;t really know the details.</p><p><strong>Mysterious Chousokabe Heroine X:</strong><br> ...Hee hee... This place will be the death of you!</p><p><strong>Mysterious Chousokabe Heroine X:</strong><br> The amazing Warring States Space Battlemaiden, Mysterious Chousokabe Heroine X, shall punish the counterfeit Saber!</p><p><strong>Okita:</strong><br> Chousokabe...? Which means...Tosa...?</p><p><strong>Mysterious Chousokabe Heroine X:</strong><br> Eh? Is that not my style?

SatChou and Tosa must die!<br> There will be no mercy!</p><p><strong>Gotou S\xE9tanta:</strong><br> I&#39;m so glad we get to stay out of this for a change.</p><p><strong>Sanada Emimura:</strong><br> Uh, I&#39;m not sure if that&#39;s true.</p><p><strong>Sanada Emimura:</strong><br> Anyway, you will all experience the true terror...</p><p><strong>Sanada Emimura:</strong><br> ...of my Emiyamaru!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Gotou S\xE9tanta:</strong><br> ...Sheesh.

Hey, next time can I at least go by something other than my childhood name?</p><p><strong>Mouri Medinaga:</strong><br> Eh? Some say that it was Mouri, not Sanada, who was the true master of strategy in the Osaka battle?</p><p><strong>Mouri Medinaga:</strong><br> I said I don&#39;t care!</p><p><strong>Mysterious Chousokabe Heroine X:</strong><br> I can&#39;t believe some phony Saber defeated my Meteor Sword... It was all because we didn&#39;t make any decisions...</p><p><strong>Akashi Ex:</strong><br> For my payment of Japanese sweets, I think I did good... (Nom nom) (Maybe I&#39;ll try out okonomiyaki on my way back?)</p><p><strong>Sanada Emimura:</strong><br> Heh... I knew this would happen.</p><p><strong>Sanada Emimura:</strong><br> I suppose we lost because I compromised the citadel&#39;s walls by driving spears through them to look cool...</p><p><strong>Sanada Emimura:</strong><br> ...Hurry. You are the only ones who can save that girl.</p><p><strong>Sanada Emimura:</strong><br> It seems the Heroic Spirit who has fused with me also wants that.</p><p><strong>Okita:</strong><br> Sanada Emimura\u2013no, Sanada Yukimura\u2013is Chacha&#39;s...</p><p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong><br> Eh? Who is this guy? Is he famous? Sanada?</p><p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong><br> Oh, Sanada, the former retainer of Takeda? Now that you mention it, I think he left me his horse right before I died...</p><p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong><br> I don&#39;t remember much but... Eh? His son?</p><p><strong>Sanada Emimura:</strong><br> You&#39;ve messed everything up. It&#39;s your fault that I had to go through hell...

The real threat is you, Fujimaru! You&#39;re the one who unified the two groups!</p><p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong><br> Nobukatsu! How dare you continue to scurry around causing mischief!</p><p><strong>Nobukatsu:</strong><br> Hah! Unfortunately for you, the stalling was effective! Chacha has already been sacrificed and the Great Gold Demon Taikou has revived!</p><p><strong>Nobukatsu:</strong><br> Now, behold! The paradise of death!</p><p><strong>Nobukatsu:</strong><br> Radiant Demon Fortress of the Sun!</p><p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong><br> Wh-what the...?

It&#39;s just a stupid jerk that tried to deceive and devour Chacha.</p><p><strong>Okita:</strong><br> Huh, what do you mean?</p><p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong><br> That thing really is the carcass of a Demon God Pillar.</p><p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong><br> During the battle with Solomon, it must have developed some self-awareness.</p><p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong><br> What happens when a living thing becomes aware of itself? Naturally, it begins to fear its eventual demise.</p><p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong><br> While the other Demon God Pillars stayed on the battlefield following orders, this one fled its post... Because it wanted to live.</p><p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong><br> However, weak as it was, it was unable to stave off death. And so it drew it last breath\u2013here. Now, only its vindictive desires remain.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Wait, YOU figured this all out? I mean, you&#39;re right... That&#39;s basically the residual thought patterns of a Demon God Pillar that took shape.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> It may just be a corpse that drifted here, but it&#39;s still a Demon God Pillar. Even that shell is a powerful magical tool.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> The Demon God Pillar resonated with the powerful desire not to die, then fused with that very desire and materialized as something similar to a Grail.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> It&#39;s like a nasty parasite. It can&#39;t maintain its existence without using the Spirit Origin of a Heroic Spirit as a catalyst.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> So if we separate Chacha from it,<br> this realm will go back to normal!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Da Vinci, yes!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Thank you, too, Mash!</p><p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong><br> Let&#39;s put an end to this, Fujimaru!</p><p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong><br> Chacha, we&#39;ll get you out of that piece of trash soon!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Just hang in there, okay?</p><p><strong>Chacha:</strong><br> Auntie...

It&#39;s always like this with you...</p><p><strong>Okita:</strong><br> Anyway, let&#39;s end this!</p><p><strong>Okita:</strong><br> To be honest, I&#39;m running kinda low on HP myself...</p><p><strong>Okita:</strong><br> (Cough!?)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Let&#39;s go, everyone! Final boss battle time!</p><p><strong>Okita:</strong><br> Come, to the decisive battle!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> The Oda and Shinsengumi working together...We are the O-Shin Alliance!</p><p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong><br> Hm! It&#39;s gonna get a taste of our powers combined!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Demon God Pillar Andras:</strong><br> I...I don&#39;t want to die... I don&#39;t want to die...<br> I don&#39;t want to die here...like this...</p><p><strong>Demon God Pillar Andras:</strong><br> I just want to keep living...somewhere...<br> Alone in my own world...</p><p><strong>Demon God Pillar Andras:</strong><br> I don&#39;t need purpose. No ideals or conviction.<br> No subjugation or rule. No pursuit or development. No camaraderie or parting... None of it.</p><p><strong>Demon God Pillar Andras:</strong><br> I just...wanted to relish this newfound sense of self...a bit longer.</p><p><strong>Chacha:</strong><br> Hm? Where am I...?</p><p><strong>Chacha:</strong><br> Chacha remembers getting enveloped in flames that day...</p><p><strong>Chacha:</strong><br> I see. So this is what hell&#39;s like...</p><p><strong>Demon God Pillar Andras:</strong><br> I don&#39;t want to die... I don&#39;t want to die...</p><p><strong>Chacha:</strong><br> Wh-what are you!? A D-Demon God Pillar!?<br> D-don&#39;t come near Chacha...!</p><p><strong>Demon God Pillar Andras:</strong><br> Chacha...? This record... You destroyed Toyotomi...?<br> I see... You&#39;re going to die too...</p><p><strong>Demon God Pillar Andras:</strong><br> I will die soon... And so I...I understand how you feel. Give me your hand... If I fuse myself with you, then we&#39;ll...!</p><p><strong>Chacha:</strong><br> S-stop! Ch-Chacha is not the one who destroyed Toyotomi!</p><p><strong>Chacha:</strong><br> Chacha tried to save Hideyori...!</p><p><strong>Demon God Pillar Andras:</strong><br> Ah...you were branded a liar, and a woman who brought destruction in later history... You are a fitting vessel for me to inhabit...</p><p><strong>Demon God Pillar Andras:</strong><br> O woman who denies destruction, as one who turns her back on it, you are truly fitting as my accomplice.</p><p><strong>Demon God Pillar Andras:</strong><br> O infernal princess, your powerful sense of shame was the beacon that guided me through the sea of death.</p><p><strong>Chacha:</strong><br> N-no! Chacha isn&#39;t a destroyer! Or an infernal anything!</p><p><strong>Chacha:</strong><br> Chacha...Chacha just...</p><p><strong>Demon God Pillar Andras:</strong><br> ...Disappear... She will disappear... The woman who rejected destruction will never accept eternity.</p><p><strong>Demon God Pillar Andras:</strong><br> ...I do not understand humans.<br> Life is incomprehensible. But...</p><p><strong>Demon God Pillar Andras:</strong><br> One thing has become clear to me. Biological activity without purpose is no true voyage; it is merely drifting...</p><p><strong>Demon God Pillar Andras:</strong><br> ...And I...simply failed to properly order my goals and purposes in this brief existence...</p><p><strong>Chacha:</strong><br> Th-that was a close one, Fujimaru!</p><p><strong>Chacha:</strong><br> Good work saving Chacha!<br> Make Auntie give you a reward!</p><p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong><br> Cut the crap.</p><p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong><br> We wouldn&#39;t even BE in this mess if you hadn&#39;t gotten yourself captured by that Demon God Pillar...</p><p><strong>Okita:</strong><br> Now, now. All&#39;s well that ends well.<br> We should be happy that everyone&#39;s safe and sound.</p><p><strong>Nobukatsu:</strong><br> Well, Big Sister, I think this is goodbye...</p><p><strong>Okita:</strong><br> Huh? Nobukatsu!? Why are you fading away!?</p><p><strong>Nobukatsu:</strong><br> Well, you know, I&#39;m pretty insignificant,<br> so I don&#39;t exactly qualify as a Heroic Spirit.</p><p><strong>Nobukatsu:</strong><br> It was only thanks to the Demon God Pillar that I was able to maintain my Spirit Origin.</p><p><strong>Nobukatsu:</strong><br> You all went to great lengths to save me,<br> but I think this is the end.</p><p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong><br> Nobukatsu...</p><p><strong>Nobukatsu:</strong><br> Oh come on, Big Sis.<br> I am not the sort of brother who should be missed.</p><p><strong>Nobukatsu:</strong><br> I&#39;m the dumb little brother whose jealousy of his amazing Big Sister started this whole insurrection.</p><p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong><br> I see... You&#39;re right...</p><p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong><br> Okay, bye then!</p><p><strong>Nobukatsu:</strong><br> Oh come on! I&#39;m disappearing forever and THAT&#39;S the best you can manage!?</p><p><strong>Nobukatsu:</strong><br> Ah, Big Sister. Just one last thing.</p><p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong><br> ...What is it? Come on, spit it out.</p><p><strong>Nobukatsu:</strong><br> ...I leave THE REST to you, Big Sister.</p><p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong><br> Wh-what!? Don&#39;t give me that crap, you dummy!<br> Who uses the same last words TWICE!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Nobbu...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Sorry to cut into this...\u201Ctouching\u201D moment, but...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> ...the Demon God Pillar that created this realm has disappeared. We&#39;d better get you all out of there.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That&#39;s right! Please hurry, Senpai!<br> If you stay there, like last time, the space will...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Oh? It&#39;s not collapsing...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Eh? You&#39;re right. Why&#39;s that? Could there still be a shard of the Demon God Pillar somewhere?</p><p><strong>Chacha:</strong><br> Eh!? Does Chacha still have a chunk of that weirdo thing on her, Fujimaru?</p><p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong><br> ...No, that&#39;s not it.</p><p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong><br> Right, Shinsengumi!?</p><p><strong>Hijikata:</strong><br> ...Hmph. Seems that way.</p><p><strong>Okita:</strong><br> Eh? M-Mr. Hiji...kata...!?</p><h2 id="epilogue-shinsengumi" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#epilogue-shinsengumi" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Epilogue: Shinsengumi</h2><p><strong>Okita:</strong><br> Mr. Hijikata... Why...?</p><p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong><br> It&#39;s simple. That Hijikata Toshizo guy is also a Heroic Spirit that the Demon God Pillar summoned.</p><p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong><br> ...Am I right?</p><p><strong>Hijikata Toshizo:</strong><br> ...After hearing your conversation, it seems that way.</p><p><strong>Hijikata Toshizo:</strong><br> On that fateful day, I was shot at Hakodate...and the next thing I knew, I was here. Does that mean the Demon God Pillar consumed me, too?</p><p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong><br> Not necessarily. That thing called out for those who share its desires, and maintained this space.</p><p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong><br> You&#39;re just one of the keystones that made this space, all the while being a Rogue Servant who didn&#39;t need the power of the Demon God Pillar.</p><p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong><br> If it had consumed you, I&#39;m sure this place would have been a much more hellish battlefield.</p><p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong><br> Anyway! Your version of immortality doesn&#39;t seem to quite match up with the Demon God Pillar&#39;s.</p><p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong><br> Isn&#39;t that right, Hijikata? You&#39;re the epitome of stubborn refusal to back down. Besides, you&#39;re not the kind of wuss who&#39;d let someone else control your Spirit Origin.</p><p><strong>Hijikata Toshizo:</strong><br> Heh. I suppose I should be honored to get a seal of approval from the lord of the Sengoku period.</p><p><strong>Hijikata Toshizo:</strong><br> Oh hey. Now that I&#39;ve got a good look at you,<br> I can see you&#39;re quite a beauty.</p><p><strong>Okita:</strong><br> This is no time to joke around!</p><p><strong>Okita:</strong><br> Actually, if we can just talk Mr. Hijikata down, this&#39;ll sort itself out, and he&#39;ll come back to his senses, right?</p><p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong><br> That&#39;s not possible. Even the Demon God Pillar couldn&#39;t release the man from madness.</p><p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong><br> Hey, Hijikata... You didn&#39;t even realize you turned into a Heroic Spirit after you died, did you?</p><p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong><br> You wandered that strange battlefield, all that time projecting your desires toward the Grail\u2013toward the Demon God Pillar.</p><p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong><br> The whole time, all you were thinking was:<br> \u201CI can&#39;t die here. I won&#39;t be killed until I win.\u201D</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Probably. The Grail grants people&#39;s wishes. As the one who wished on it, his desire was what shaped that realm.</p><p><strong>Okita:</strong><br> That can&#39;t be... Does that mean Mr. Hijikata intended to continue living, to embody the Shinsengumi forever...?</p><p><strong>Hijikata Toshizo:</strong><br> I get it now... There was something...odd that I couldn&#39;t quite put my finger on. Now it&#39;s all clear.</p><p><strong>Hijikata Toshizo:</strong><br> ...In other words...</p><p><strong>Hijikata Toshizo:</strong><br> You&#39;re all trapped here until I die.</p><p><strong>Hijikata Toshizo:</strong><br> Am I right, Demon King of the Sixth Heaven?</p><p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong><br> ...Yeah.</p><p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong><br> So what are you going to do, Okita?<br> If it&#39;s too hard for you, I can do it...</p><p><strong>Okita:</strong><br> Please be quiet, Nobbu!</p><p><strong>Okita:</strong><br> Mr. Hijikata! Why!?<br> Do you not realize that you&#39;ve died!?</p><p><strong>Okita:</strong><br> That&#39;s not right! Because...<br> Because the Shinsengumi&#39;s already\u2014</p><p><strong>Hijikata Toshizo:</strong><br> Shut up, Okita!!!</p><p><strong>Hijikata Toshizo:</strong><br> Listen to me! The Shinsengumi will never end...</p><p><strong>Hijikata Toshizo:</strong><br> Kondou...Nagakura...Saitou...<br> In the end, they were all gone.</p><p><strong>Hijikata Toshizo:</strong><br> ...But don&#39;t worry.</p><p><strong>Hijikata Toshizo:</strong><br> Me... As long as I&#39;m around,<br> the Shinsengumi will never end...</p><p><strong>Hijikata Toshizo:</strong><br> Right here...!</p><p><strong>Hijikata Toshizo:</strong><br> I am...!</p><p><strong>Hijikata Toshizo:</strong><br> ...THE SHINSENGUMI!</p><p><strong>Okita:</strong><br> No...!</p><p><strong>Okita:</strong><br> You&#39;re... You&#39;re wrong...!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> No, THIS is Okita&#39;s Shinsengumi...! Here with us!</p><p><strong>Okita:</strong><br> Master!?</p><p><strong>Okita:</strong><br> Wh-what do you mean...?</p><p><strong>Hijikata Toshizo:</strong><br> Well, well... You&#39;ve got guts, newbie.</p><p><strong>Hijikata Toshizo:</strong><br> Or rather, Fujimaru!</p><p><strong>Hijikata Toshizo:</strong><br> You stand here, before ME, the Vice Commander of the Shinsengumi, Hijikata Toshizo...</p><p><strong>Hijikata Toshizo:</strong><br> ...and YOU dare to tell ME where the Shinsengumi is!?</p><p><strong>Okita:</strong><br> Master...!</p><p><strong>Okita:</strong><br> That&#39;s right...!<br> Right now, I am Master&#39;s sword!</p><p><strong>Okita:</strong><br> Mr. Hijikata!</p><p><strong>Okita:</strong><br> My makoto\u2013my sincerity\u2013is right here!</p><p><strong>Hijikata Toshizo:</strong><br> Hey Okita, for someone who quit because she was sick, you&#39;re talking awfully big now.</p><p><strong>Hijikata Toshizo:</strong><br> So be it. If you&#39;re ready to live and die by that belief, then rest assured, you&#39;ll have no mercy from me!</p><p><strong>Hijikata Toshizo:</strong><br> Your banner or my Shinsengumi... We&#39;re going to decide which is the real Shinsengumi right here!</p><p><strong>Hijikata Toshizo:</strong><br> Let&#39;s go!</p><p><strong>Hijikata Toshizo:</strong><br> SHINSENGUMI, ADVANCE!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Okita:</strong><br> ... (Pant, pant, pant)</p><p><strong>B\uFF1AHijikata Toshizo:</strong><br> ...Your sword is still as deadly as ever.</p><p><strong>B\uFF1AHijikata Toshizo:</strong><br> Ever since we were kids, I&#39;ve always known the power of your sword...</p><p><strong>Okita:</strong><br> Mr. Hijikata...! I... I...!</p><p><strong>B\uFF1AHijikata Toshizo:</strong><br> I see... So, you&#39;ve planted your banner at [\u2642 his /\u2640 her] side, then...</p><p><strong>B\uFF1AHijikata Toshizo:</strong><br> But no matter what happens...</p><p><strong>B\uFF1AHijikata Toshizo:</strong><br> ...my Shinsengumi...will NEVER die!</p><p><strong>Okita:</strong><br> ...!</p><p><strong>B\uFF1AHijikata Toshizo:</strong><br> I&#39;ll be seeing you, Okita...</p><p><strong>B\uFF1AHijikata Toshizo:</strong><br> You keep that makoto banner of yours flying high, Okita. Always.</p><p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong><br> Sheesh. He didn&#39;t change one bit; not even at the end. Guy had some serious conviction, especially for a Berserker.</p><p><strong>Okita:</strong><br> Mr. Hijikata...</p><p><strong>Okita:</strong><br> Eh!?</p><p><strong>Okita:</strong><br> Wait a minute! Mr. Hijikata was a Berserker?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Eh? You didn&#39;t notice?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Well, that was pretty convincing.</p><p><strong>Okita:</strong><br> What? No! He was definitely a Saber, or even an Archer, right!? What kind of group would the Shinsengumi be if the vice commander were a Berserker!? Huh!?</p><p><strong>Chacha:</strong><br> Hellooo! Chacha&#39;s being completely left out of the loop! Don&#39;t you think that&#39;s bad? BAD???</p><p><strong>Chacha:</strong><br> No matter how you look at it, Chacha&#39;s obviously the real heroine here. So...really!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Senpai, now that Hijikata has been defeated, the space around you is starting to collapse! Get back to Chaldea now!</p><p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong><br> Oh, I forgot! Everyone, follow me! If we all get back safe and sound, we&#39;ll have a barbecue at the temple!</p><p><strong>Chacha:</strong><br> Chacha wants to see Auntie&#39;s strange Atsumori play!</p><p><strong>Chacha:</strong><br> It&#39;s creepy, but Chacha loves it!!</p><p><strong>Okita:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Okita:</strong><br> ...Mr. Hijikata...</p><p><strong>Okita:</strong><br> As long as my banner is still here...</p><p><strong>Okita:</strong><br> I&#39;ll... I&#39;ll keep on fighting!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Let&#39;s go...!</p><p><strong>Okita:</strong><br> Yes, Master!</p><p><strong>Hijikata:</strong><br> ...Well... I guess there&#39;s nothing left.</p><p><strong>Hijikata:</strong><br> I can&#39;t hear the sounds of the battlefield.<br> I can&#39;t even see the road that leads back to Hakodate.</p><p><strong>Hijikata:</strong><br> Damn. That idiot Okita claims I died...</p><p><strong>Hijikata:</strong><br> ...I see. So it&#39;s true; I did die...</p><p><strong>Hijikata:</strong><br> I took off my haori, picked up a gun, and just...fought.</p><p><strong>Hijikata:</strong><br> But in the end, I was driven to the far north...and wound up like this.</p><p><strong>Hijikata:</strong><br> Pathetic. This feeling makes my stomach churn with rage so much, it feels like it might even be able to bring me back to life.</p><p><strong>Hijikata:</strong><br> I haven&#39;t failed my makoto, yet my body has failed me.<br> And that is...infuriating.</p><p><strong>Hijikata:</strong><br> ...But not half as much as the fact that Okita,<br> idiot that she is, defeated me...</p><p><strong>Hijikata:</strong><br> Well, yeah...</p><p><strong>Hijikata:</strong><br> The stupid girl, who sat on the veranda that day just staring absently up at the sky, acts like such a big shot now.</p><p><strong>Hijikata:</strong><br> That&#39;s just how I remember her from Kondou&#39;s dojo... The girl we all laughed about because none of us ever thought we could beat her.</p><p><strong>Hijikata:</strong><br> I&#39;m glad I could see her like that again.<br> Might as well steel myself and go... Hm?</p><p><strong>Demon God Andras:</strong><br> ...Are you still here? This space is collapsing.<br> You should leave before you get stuck.</p><p><strong>Hijikata:</strong><br> You&#39;re a Demon God Pillar, right? I would have expected you to try and drag me down with you. But...are you concerned about me?</p><p><strong>Hijikata:</strong><br> If only I&#39;d been more compatible with you, this world would&#39;ve been better fortified and defended.</p><p><strong>Demon God Andras:</strong><br> Correct. That&#39;s nothing more than a regret now, though. But thanks to you, I did learn one thing.</p><p><strong>Demon God Andras:</strong><br> To die while lamenting the life that has been lost...</p><p><strong>Demon God Andras:</strong><br> That was the one saving grace I received as I gained self-awareness.</p><p><strong>Hijikata:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Demon God Andras:</strong><br> But you are different.</p><p><strong>Demon God Andras:</strong><br> I will disappear at the end of my drifting, while you will disappear at the end of your battle.</p><p><strong>Demon God Andras:</strong><br> That is the fate that was engraved onto your Spirit Origin. And so, it is not yet time for you to die.</p><p><strong>Demon God Andras:</strong><br> My beacon. My horizon. O Berserker soldier who witnessed the end of my drifting.</p><p><strong>Demon God Andras:</strong><br> Keep fighting. Fight for the sake of your makoto,<br> even though you know you cannot be saved.</p><p><strong>Demon God Andras:</strong><br> This shall be your punishment for redeeming my evil, even for a brief moment, and my final wish made in this life.</p><p><strong>Hijikata:</strong><br> ...Hmph.</p><p><strong>Hijikata:</strong><br> ...There&#39;s no need to point it out. No matter how much I get beaten down, I&#39;m the sort of stubborn ox who will keep fighting until I win.</p><p><strong>Hijikata:</strong><br> I&#39;m aware that the Shinsengumi may never win in history. I remained a Wolf of Mibu until the very end.</p><p><strong>Hijikata:</strong><br> But my\u2013no, the Shinsengumi&#39;s\u2013makoto will never fall. No matter what battlefield we find ourselves on, no matter what kind of hell it&#39;s in.</p><p><strong>Hijikata:</strong><br> ...Fine. Dead or alive, I&#39;ll show them what it means to be a Berserker.</p><p><strong>Hijikata:</strong><br> Should a voice ever call out to me in a summoning,<br> I&#39;ll charge in and roar with all my might!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> You went through a lot this time around, Senpai.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Yeah. That was even worse than last time.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Anyway, let&#39;s take a break until our next assignment. Why don&#39;t I make you some tea since we have a bit of time?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Nice. Let&#39;s have that food we got from Kyoto too.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Wh-what is this...!?</p><p><strong>Chacha:</strong><br> Oh hey! Why, if it isn&#39;t Fujimaru!</p><p><strong>Chacha:</strong><br> Plain and boring rooms are not Chacha&#39;s style, so I tried reproducing that golden tea room from the other day. Chacha did good, huh?</p><p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong><br> Well...this is no good.<br> Needs more wabi-sabi.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> No, that&#39;s not what I mean...! First of all, why is everyone messing around in Master&#39;s room!?</p><p><strong>Okita:</strong><br> Well you see, I used up all my NP during our last battle...</p><p><strong>Okita:</strong><br> I can&#39;t go anywhere for a while, so please let me recuperate in Master&#39;s room.</p><p><strong>Okita:</strong><br> Oh, if you&#39;re going to be making tea, go light, please.<br> And some sweets would be nice.</p><p><strong>Chacha:</strong><br> Chacha too! Chacha too! U-um, cups, cups, cups...</p><p><strong>Chacha:</strong><br> Well, I guess this thing I stole from the Demon God Pillar right before we left might work...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Eh? Isn&#39;t that a Grail?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Good work...!</p><p><strong>Chacha:</strong><br> What? You can have it if you want it.</p><p><strong>Chacha:</strong><br> That cup is not Chacha&#39;s style anyway.</p><p><strong>Chacha:</strong><br> So! Fujimaru! Now that Chacha&#39;s at this Chaldea place, you&#39;ll never be bored!</p><p><strong>Chacha:</strong><br> Now you have luxurious barbecued meals with Chacha every day to look forward to!</p><p><strong>Chacha:</strong><br> You&#39;re already looking forward to it, right? Right!?</p><p><strong>Chacha:</strong><br> ...Sooo! Mash, or whoever you&#39;re supposedta be! Chacha is already bored! Entertain Chacha! Do something fun!</p><p><strong>Chacha:</strong><br> Vee-are? I hear there&#39;s something called Vee-are?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Senpai! Please say something!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Right...um...</p><p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong><br> Well, it can&#39;t be helped!</p>', 1248);
