Good timing.<br> There is a thing I want to ask you.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Sure, what&#39;s going on?</p><p><strong>Jing Ke:</strong><br> I want you to train with me. I want a simulated battle, but its setting is a little complicated.</p><p><strong>Jing Ke:</strong><br> Roman taught me how, and I memorized it...<br> But, I have a bad feeling.</p><p><strong>Jing Ke:</strong><br> My intuition never fails in this kind of situation.<br> I&#39;m sure I will kill, no, I will break that device.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I-I see. That&#39;s one fantastic intuition.<br> And, it&#39;s good you talked to us about it.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Let me take care of fine-tuning the settings.<br> You can always count on me.</p><p><strong>Jing Ke:</strong><br> Oh, I appreciate it.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> So, how do you want it?</p><p><strong>Jing Ke:</strong><br> Defeat the king, this is what I want to train.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Understood. I suppose a situation similar to the one you were once in is all right?</p><p><strong>Jing Ke:</strong><br> Of course!<br> That&#39;s the way it should be.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Then, the simulated battle will start now.</p><p><strong>Jing Ke:</strong><br> As you already know, I failed to assassinate the first emperor.</p><p><strong>Jing Ke:</strong><br> Nevertheless, I&#39;m really thankful of Master for summoning me and letting me serve.</p><p><strong>Jing Ke:</strong><br> But, I can&#39;t just relax like this.<br> I must succeed, even if only virtually.</p><p><strong>Jing Ke:</strong><br> To slay with this dagger, I&#39;m still a little far.</p><p><strong>Jing Ke:</strong><br> So, I will go one step closer.</p><p><strong>Jing Ke:</strong><br> ...Of course.<br> Soldiers rushed to his rescue.</p><p><strong>Jing Ke:</strong><br> Only unarmed civil servants were around the first emperor, but I can&#39;t expect such a good situation every time.</p><p><strong>Jing Ke:</strong><br> Then, let&#39;s start slaying them.<br> As fast as possible. From now on speed is everything.</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Jing Ke:</strong><br> And move another step forward. If there is a mage,<br> he will summon something to protect the king.</p><p><strong>Jing Ke:</strong><br> Let&#39;s see.<br> A tough, defensive golem would be perfect.</p><p><strong>Jing Ke:</strong><br> I must slay it instantly, too.<br> Polish up the dagger&#39;s edge even more\u2013!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Jing Ke:</strong><br> And, it&#39;s almost over.<br> Now, the only remaining prey is the king.</p><p><strong>Jing Ke:</strong><br> ...I made a mistake here. I misjudged the emperor to be an immobile, corrupted man.</p><p><strong>Jing Ke:</strong><br> He was tyrannical, but at the same time, he was great.<br> I should&#39;ve considered he could move and confront me.</p><p><strong>Jing Ke:</strong><br> He knocked down my flying dagger, and ran away quickly while I was slightly shocked.</p><p><strong>Jing Ke:</strong><br> Yes, this is the end.<br> I will take the king&#39;s head\u2013let&#39;s go!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Jing Ke:</strong><br> ...Yes, this is the end.<br> This is checkmate for the king.</p><p><strong>Jing Ke:</strong><br> Of course, in this case I&#39;d perish too, but that can&#39;t be helped. Though virtual, I think it&#39;s good enough.</p><p><strong>Jing Ke:</strong><br> After all, this is nothing more than a fabrication.<br> The fact remains that I failed to assassinate the first emperor.</p><p><strong>Jing Ke:</strong><br> But if I sacrifice my body, certainly I will be of some use to you.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I don&#39;t want you to die.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Don&#39;t waste your life.</p><hr><p><strong>Jing Ke:</strong><br> ...Ah, you&#39;re right.<br> I will gratefully accept your kindness.</p><p><strong>Jing Ke:</strong><br> But unfortunately, this is the only way I know how to fight. And this is the reason I was summoned.</p><p><strong>Jing Ke:</strong><br> You must use me.<br> And when I vanish completely, lament for me.</p><p><strong>Jing Ke:</strong><br> Your tears are my everything.</p><p><strong>Jing Ke:</strong><br> That way, I would be able to think that my sacrifice had served a purpose.</p><p><strong>Jing Ke:</strong><br> ...Don&#39;t worry.<br> That doesn&#39;t mean it will happen.</p><p><strong>Jing Ke:</strong><br> Until then, I&#39;ll enjoy this world with drink in hand.</p>', 50);
