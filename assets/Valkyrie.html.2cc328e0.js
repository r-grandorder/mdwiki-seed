Because of this, it preserves the absolute nature of Valkyrie\u2019s mind and soul. Magecraft and abilities that could potentially affect the mind are completely repelled, and on top of deflecting physical attacks of Rank B of below, their bodies do not change even after massive intake of calories.

Their appearance is very chivalrous but sometimes, they can also put a gentle smile towards outstanding heroes. On the other hand, they lack self-awareness of their ego. But that doesn\u2019t mean that they can\u2019t feel any emotions, they\u2019re just a bit out of sync in comparison with humans on Earth. They mainly stare blankly at the never changing scene either in a fight or battlefield because they have little personal experience themselves and that they mostly earn it as information. (If they don\u2019t understand, they\u2019ll try to slowly understand it.) Their existence is sort of like an automated machine since they were produced by the Almighty God Odin. For example, their personality and body largely deviate from being an\u300Cordinary as a Valkyrie\u300Das they change \u30FBalternate from a \u300CValkyrie\u300Das a whole and into a more characteristic personality so that they can fall in love, dislike violence and bear strong feelings. In the end, they\u2019ve changed into an organism that\u2019s roughly the same as a human which was their downfall from a demigod (The person to deviate first was Brynhildr). In the present as Servants, they try to scout as half-machine towards people who are considered heroes which is fundamental for them to \u300Cguiding heroes to Valhalla\u300Das it comes from the orders of the Almighty God.</p><h2 id="attitude-towards-master" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#attitude-towards-master" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Attitude Towards Master</h2><p>Master is an outstanding commander and if they recognize Master as an \u201Cexcellent hero\u201D then they\u2019ll be close to that recognition. From there, it depends (whether or not their divinity rank will exponentially decrease) whether or not the girls acquire emotions while interacting with Master. Their wish towards the Holy Grail is \u201Cto guide a qualified soul of a hero to Valhalla.\u201D Even should the Age of Gods end, or the final war comes to a close, this prime directive bestowed upon them by the Almighty God will not falter.</p><h2 id="dialogue-examples" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#dialogue-examples" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Dialogue Examples</h2><p><strong>Ortlinde</strong></p><p>Yes, Our existence is similarly identical.

For example, every human can strike at another person\u2019s opinion...right? It\u2019s different for us. That\u2019s right, we Valkyries don\u2019t have differing opinions. Even though our texture is different, we\u2019re still running on the same system. But, what if, each system, like Elder Sister Brynhildr\u2026</p><p><strong>Hildr</strong></p><p>I can\u2019t believe Big Sister Brynhildr is here! What do you mean? The us you know is not us?

They are the daughters of the Almighty God. They are the highest beings within Norse Mythology, many of them are produced by the Almighty God Odin.</p><p>They hover over the skies of many battlefields determining qualified warriors that were killed in action, guiding their souls to the shining and prosperous Valhalla which is in the palace of the Almighty God. The end of Scandinavia\u2019s Age of Gods---- All for the sake of filling out the ranks of the Great God\u2019s army, meant to slay Jotnar in the Twilight of the Gods.</p><p>\u25C7</p><p>The Valkyries all individually exist as the Almighty God Odin\u2019s daughters. They possess high rank divinity skills because their existence (Demigods) is almost the same as Divine Spirits. In Gotterdammerung, the Valkyries were mass-produced into many entities because of Almighty God Odin in regards to Ragnorok, so they function by operating like some sort of automaton. They soar in the skies of the battlefield urging forward with a flying horse selecting souls of dead heroes to guide to Valhalla. However, the population decreased when Sigurd met Elder Sister Brynhildr who had strong feelings and acquired a personality which was her downfall as an instant turning point.</p><p>\u201CWouldn\u2019t things have worsened to the point of \u2018half of what it used to be\u2019 at the beginning of Ragnarok, the decisive battle between the Gods and Jotnar?\u201D A report claiming this has been submitted to the Lord of Jigmarie (Faculty of Curse Research) in the mid-1980s, becoming the talk within the world of magecraft.</p><p>Why did half of Valkyries disappear? According to the report, \u201Cit could be said that many Valkyries including Brynhildr who have acquired a personality and left behind the Almighty God\u2019s imperial command have fallen from their rank of being a divine spirit or half-goddess.\u201D</p><p>\u25C7</p><p>Present day Valkyries in this work have a unique existence as Servants. To be specific, they possess an exceedingly unprecedented Saint Graph. Although they can\u2019t \u201Cchange into strong forms when they ascend their Saint Graph\u201D just like with the other Servants, the mana they have increases as they ascend their synchronization rate with Master. Each individual respectively Valkyrie has their upper limit of power. In any case the Valkyries perform an ascension in accordance with the Chaldea Summoning System, there will be a high chance that the Valkyrie will summon a substitute replacing its form \u201Cwith a different individual Valkyrie with a suitable redefining mana capacity\u201D</p><p>Valkyrie Ortlinde Valkyrie Hildr Valkyrie Thrud</p><p>The 3 Servants named above are individually validated to bring into the substitution summoning in Chaldea\u2019s summoning system and Saint Graph ascension. They expect that their destiny will be binded to Master individually. Currently, any of the girls will go under the True Name of \u201CValkyrie\u201D due to the size of their mana, the essence of their existence is roughly equivalent. To be more precise, they should possess individual True Names such as Ortlinde, Hildr, and Thrud, but the girls \u201Ceach different individuals&#39;&#39; will reject being treated as firm.</p><p>Thrud: \u201CAs a Valkyrie, there is no substantial difference\u201D Hildr: \u201CThat\u2019s right, we\u2019re like one with everyone as the foundation.\u201D Ortlinde: \u201CYes, Elder Sister Brynhildr is strange\u2026.\u201D</p><p>The girl(s) talk in this manner.</p><p>\u25C7</p><p>Why are the girls summoned with a special Saint Graph? It\u2019s probably that they\u2019re entwined with fate in regards to Master as they met and parted ways in the Scandinavia Lostbelt. Yet now the summoned girls are the girls of Pan-Human History who are heroic spirits, they became heroic spirits; the Master that met them in the Scandinavian Lostbelt were different people ----------- \u201Ccompletely different people.\u201D</p><p>\u25C7</p><p>The girl(s) recognize \u201Cguiding a qualified soul of a hero to Valhalla\u201D as an imperial command similar to their lifetime. Although their existence can be called half divine spirit or half goddess, their objective is mainly to work with a collection of souls as they are not suited for combat. Although the strength and magical powers that are concealed in that body fall within a category of no common knowledge.</p><h2 id="the-rest" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#the-rest" aria-hidden="true">#</a> The Rest</h2><p>King Altera (King Atli) is Brynhildr\u2019s other brother in \u201CVolsung Saga,\u201D \u201CPoetic Edda\u201D and \u201CSigurd\u2019s short song.\u201D It is unclear how Attila and Altera the King of Destruction relates to the former Valkyrie, Brynhildr. Is Altera possibly the existence that the Almighty God Odin used at the time to shape the Valkyrie into a model like \u201Can automaton as a terminal?\u201D Of course, Altera existed in the 7th century, but there shouldn\u2019t be any activities from the prototype Valkyries in the Age of Gods.
