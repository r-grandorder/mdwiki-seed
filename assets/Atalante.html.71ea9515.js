Due to her nature of being brought up together with animals, she is an extreme realist except when against children. Her outlook on life and death is more severe than a human being\u2019s, basically not showing any mercy towards the weak\u2026 provided that children are excluded.</p><h2 id="attitude-towards-master" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#attitude-towards-master" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Attitude Towards Master</h2><p>Atalanta embraces the grand desire of saving all children. Regarding that, taking an unsparing attitude even towards her Master, in the situation where she does not catch sight of them having a zeal in obtaining the Holy Grail, she will even slay them. Nonetheless, if one goes along with her entirely while respecting her dream, she will even probably hand over a golden apple to them\u2026 Well, speaking of faults, regarding unfaithfulness in comparison to other Greek heroes, Atalanta deals with that fault in a strict manner.</p><h2 id="dialogue-examples" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#dialogue-examples" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Dialogue Examples</h2><p>\u201CHmph, too slow.

However, she was abandoned on the mountains immediately after she was born and was brought up by a female bear sent by Artemis, a virgin goddess who felt pity for her. Thereafter, Atalanta was discovered by hunters whom threaded into the mountains, and she also became a huntress later on.</p><p>Atalanta boasts to be the fastest among humans, and right after becoming one of the few female crewmembers on the Argo, she happened to meet the Hero Meleager.</p><p>Meleager was charmed by Atalanta, and he invited her to the extermination of the Calydonian Demonic Beast, but this resulted in giving rise to a tragedy right after this event. For the sake of exterminating this Demonic Beast that was dispatched by Artemis, who got angry with a king who was being negligent in offering her a sacrifice, Atalanta and the others exhausted their efforts in a desperate attempt to hunt down the boar. However, although Meleager pierced the finishing blow, he handed over the achievement of hunting down the boar to Atalanta, who was the first one to hit her arrow onto the boar, this being an act of good will towards Atalanta, or Meleager having thought that it is simply something that should be followed as a Hero.</p><p>Concerning the males\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014they held displeasure towards that, where they cannot grow to be simply tolerant and were saying that they possess skills greater than Atalanta, who is a female\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014A fight suddenly occurred between Meleager and his relatives, and Meleager was inflicted with a deadly curse.</p><p>Regarding Meleager, it is unclear what kind of feelings Atalanta had been embracing for him. However, she seemed to have watched the outcome of a man who decided to love her get dragged into a tragedy, while regarding her father\u2019s persuasion to marry, she tried to escape the unreasonable demand thrust at her, but she could not accomplish that either.</p><p>As far as she is concerned, Atalanta exists as a symbol of purity for children while simultaneously, she is an existence that projected her very own former self. Although she was saved by the hands of the gods, it is nearly beyond redemption for the rest of the children. She, who materialized as a Servant, entrusts the salvation of children to the Holy Grail. All children throughout the world, far and wide\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014That quest is without any reward, and yet, even though she is aware that it is a difficult challenge that is close to impossible to accomplish, she will chase after that dream for eternity.</p><p>In addition, when she became an Argonaut, Atalanta had interactions with her companion Peleus, who is the father of Achilles. In regard to this modest young man, he cannot look at the egoism of heroes in Greek Mythology, and it was, among other things, an aspect for her to think about all right.</p><h2 id="standard-weapons" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#standard-weapons" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Standard Weapons</h2><p>The Bow of the Heavens (Tauropolos)\u2026 a large bow Atalanta received from the gods.</p><h2 id="related-characters" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#related-characters" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Related Characters</h2><p><strong>Heracles</strong></p><p>A member of the Argonauts. The strongest, the invincible, the almighty! It is difficult for Atalanta to approach Heracles for he is excessively powerful.</p><p><strong>Medea</strong></p><p>A member of the Argonauts. At the moment when she met Medea, Atalanta requested for a moment of time with her before long, and the memories with Medea (as a Lily) were touching lovely\u2026 And then, when Atalanta tried to converse with a samurai who happened to be casually nearby, she burst into laughter as she fainted in agony.</p><p><strong>Artemis</strong></p><p>The goddess Atalanta believes in.</p><p>\u201CI\u2019m okay, yea sweets art REALLY okay.

Four ears? Holes? Hey, anything else?\u201D they said\u2026</p><p>When I think about it, rather than saying she\u2019s like this child or beast, isn\u2019t Atalanta an insect or something? I\u2019m thinking something like that. Atalanta is like that sort of insect girl (her mouth isn\u2019t too bad), but doesn\u2019t she seem to be presented as very cute?
