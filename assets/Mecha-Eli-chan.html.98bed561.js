Despite being a robot, she exhibits more grace than Elizabeth (she does not have Elizabeth&#39;s goofy temperament of going along with jokes). She rarely ever raises her voice, but when confronted with evil, she enters self-righteous/leader-mode to dish out sharp reprimands.</p><p>Perhaps it is because of her former status as the castle&#39;s guardian deity that she will absolutely attack anyone who violates her personal rules of &quot;evil&quot;.</p><p>(She seriously worries about how she may be punishing those who did &quot;something bad&quot; in a textbook-manner due the fact that her electronic brain takes time to process &quot;human inconsistency&quot;, but she doesn&#39;t talk about it.)</p><p>Both rebels and criminals have their own circumstances. Mecha Eli-chan, who intellectually believes that she should take those extenuating circumstances into consideration, is unhappy about such a self-righteous train of thought and is troubled about how to improve it.</p><p>She was in simple terms a good girl.</p><p>Through her steel expression, it is difficult to tell, but she is extremely tenacious.</p><p>As a noble (one who defends their land), she has crushed her own &quot;personality as a young girl&quot;, but on very rare occasions, and only to a master she trusts, she may display a girly smile/embarrassed face.</p><p>(If Elizabeth is a mix of &quot;a cruel girl and a brutal lord&quot;, then Mecha Eli-chan is &quot;a strict girl, cool-headedly serving a lord&quot;.)</p><p>She is properly aware that she is a golem (mecha).</p><p>Just like Passionlip and Meltryllis, she dislikes the basis of her character that is Elizabeth Bathory - despite respecting her as the original. She found faults with Elizabeth - saying things like \u201CI\u2019m better suited as a lord\u201D - and planned to driver her away (but it\u2019s not like she wants to kill her). She would have no reasons to reject her if Elizabeth would only become an ideal lord, but she understand that such a time will never come - for Elizabeth is a Servant who can only come into existence as an innocent monster. For similar reasons, Carmilla is also no good. Although Carmilla\u2019s personality is that of an ideal lord, she is out due to her being a vampire.</p><p>If Elizabeth Bathory had never gotten caught up in her delusion of blood... No, if there had been someone to protect her from the pressuring notion that &quot;a woman holds no worth without beauty,&quot; then the history of \u010Cachtice would surely have been different. This Alter Ego might be such a &quot;what if&quot; given shape.</p><p>&quot;The things she likes&quot; is a system of government without any surrounding issues; beautiful iron = namely herself; a pilot she can trust.</p><p>&quot;The things she hates&quot; is an irresponsible lord; non-working nobles; herself acting recklessly; an octopus-type robot which doesn&#39;t appear to exist in this world.</p><h2 id="attitude-towards-master" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#attitude-towards-master" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Attitude Towards Master</h2><p>To begin with, she identified the Master as a criminal who took the side of her enemy (Elizabeth), intent on destroying Himeji Castle, but this misunderstanding was cleared up by a joint effort.</p><p>To Mecha Eli-chan, the Master who tried to protect \u010Cachtice Castle, even though they had no affiliation with it, became an immediate candidate as &quot;a trustworthy and righteous pilot of the people&quot;.</p><h2 id="dialogue-examples" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#dialogue-examples" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Dialogue Examples</h2><ul><li><p>&quot;Good day, invaders.
