So we did good?</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong><br> Oh yes, very good. I could see how hard you were working right from beginning to end.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> Well of course. My mentor always said that a job done right is its own reward!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> Anyway, now that we&#39;re done here, it&#39;s time for snacks, right? Then let&#39;s go to the cafeteria!</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> Good idea. But aren&#39;t you forgetting something?</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> What is it that Lady Nightingale always tells you to do after getting back from a simulation or Rayshift?</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong><br> Huh?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> Um...</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> Wash your hands with soap and water.<br> Go on, let me hear you say it!</p><p><strong>Jack &amp; Lily:</strong><br> Wash our hands! With soap and water!</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong><br> Oh yes, washing your hands is very important!</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong><br> Uncle Emiya and Boudica would be very cross with us if we picked up a doughnut with dirty hands.</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> Yes, I&#39;m sure they would. So make sure you wash properly, and don&#39;t forget to scrub under your fingernails, okay?</p><p><strong>Children:</strong><br> &#39;Kaaay.</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> Very good. All right then, off to the washroom.<br> No dawdling.</p><p><strong>Children:</strong><br> &#39;Kaaay!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I&#39;m impressed, Tomoe. There aren&#39;t many Heroic Spirits who are so good with children, not even in Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Do you have some sort of trick or technique?</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> Oh no, it&#39;s nothing special.<br> I&#39;m just used to dealing with children.</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> Besides, the little ones here are so well-behaved that it&#39;s really no trouble at all.</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> Even when they were playing around in the simulator, they never failed to respond to Master&#39;s commands.</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> I hope you&#39;ll tell them what a wonderful job they did, Master.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You&#39;re right, I should.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> You first, Tomoe. Thanks for all your help.</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> Oh, no, I didn&#39;t mean me. I meant\u2013</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> Oh, right. You did say \u201Cfirst,\u201D didn&#39;t you?<br> Thank you, Master. That&#39;s very kind of you.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Okay, I&#39;m going to sort through all this training data and go report it to Da Vinci.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Please feel free to take the rest of the day off, Senpai.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> You&#39;ve been training nonstop since the morning, and it&#39;s just as important to rest as it is to work hard.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> You could go relax in your room, or play something in the rec room... Whatever you&#39;d like to do to relax.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Make sure you don&#39;t go burning yourself out either, Mash.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Thank you, Senpai.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Okay then, let&#39;s meet up in the cafeteria once you&#39;re done.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Are you sure? I won&#39;t be done until the evening...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Oh! I didn&#39;t realize you were inviting me to dinner at first. Sounds good!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> All right then, see you later!</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> ...Hmm.</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> ...Hmm, hmm!</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> Now I get it!</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> Master, Master. I hope I&#39;m not being rude, but I couldn&#39;t help but notice how well you and Lady Mash get along.</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> I think it&#39;s just wonderful.<br> It warms my heart to see it.</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> So, um...on a related note, Master...</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> I realize it is very improper of me to ask this of someone so young...</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> ...but, um, I couldn&#39;t help but wonder how many you left behind in your hometown?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> How many what?</p><hr><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> W-well...um...</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> I speak of...s-suitors.</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> Oh, but of course, I know very little of modern customs, so I won&#39;t be so crass as to ask if you are yet wed!</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> At any rate, what is your answer? Naturally, you are still young, so I know there is every possibility that you have not yet had such experiences.</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> But I have also heard from Lord Zhuge Liang that it is not uncommon for today&#39;s young people to engage in courtships at an early age, so I thought that you might be one of them.</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> S-s-so how about it? Is there anyone, um,<br> special you left behind in your hometown?</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> O-or are you still pure and unsullied?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> \u201CUnsullied,\u201D huh?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> What do you mean by \u201Cunsullied\u201D?</p><hr><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> O-oh, w-well, I-I just meant, um...</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> I-I certainly have no intention of prying, but after seeing Lady Mash serve you so devotedly, well...</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> ...I simply couldn&#39;t help but wonder how it is she thinks of you.</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> After all, Master, while you are essentially a general leading the charge in the battle for humanity, you were by no means born and raised in Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> As such, I figured it was well within the realm of possibility that you might have family, friends, or suitors back in your homeland.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> \u201CSuitors\u201D?</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> Oh, right. Nowadays, I believe they are called, um, \u201Clovers\u201D?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> By \u201Csuitors,\u201D I assume you mean \u201Clovers\u201D?</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> Y-yes, that&#39;s right.<br> I believe that is what they are called nowadays...</p><hr><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Nope. No way. No how. Nuh-uh. Negative.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Of course not!</p><hr><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> Oh!</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> You&#39;re so skilled at commanding so many different Heroic Spirits that I was sure you must have a suitor or three waiting for you back home...</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> But I suppose you really are too young for this sort of discussion after all!</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> Oh gosh, oh gosh!<br> I-I-I&#39;m so terribly sorry, Master!</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> I should have known you would be more conscientious than that! Please forgive me for ever thinking otherwise!</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> ...U-um, could I ask you one last thing just to make perfectly sure, Master?</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> You, um, wouldn&#39;t happen to have any children back home, would you?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Definitely not.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Can&#39;t say I do, no.</p><hr><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> Right. Of course...</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> It&#39;s just that, you get along with the childlike Heroic Spirits so well that I thought you might have had prior experience raising one... And since you are a general from modern times, I didn&#39;t think it was outside the realm of possibility.</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> But I see now that I was being very foolish.<br> I hope you can forgive me...</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Hang on. Is this because you wanted to talk to a parent?</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> ...Y-yes, that&#39;s right.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I&#39;m pretty sure there&#39;re some Heroic Spirits here who&#39;ve been parents.</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> ...Yes, that&#39;s true.</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> I&#39;ve already learned a great deal from my discussions with Lord Tajima and Lady Marie.</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> We may all be from different times and places, but thanks to them...</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> ...I know now that there are fleeting, precious things in this world that remain the same in any age.</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> Which is exactly why I...</p><hr><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> I wanted to talk to someone who is raising a child right now. Not that I expect I could be of any help to them...</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> I just...wanted to ask them something.</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> Even a single question would have been enough...</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> But no, I could never make such a selfish demand. Especially given the circumstances we are all facing at the moment.</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> All right, Master, I will see you tomorrow. Please feel free to call on me if you wish to do any more training or tactical planning!</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> As always, I, Tomoe Gozen, will be there to aid you.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Hold up.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Actually, I was hoping we could talk a little more.</p><hr><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> O-oh?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I was hoping you could tell me about your family, Tomoe.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> This seems like a good chance for you to finally tell me about your family.</p><hr><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> .........All right.</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> Please watch your step, Master.</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> We may only be in the simulator, but it is still all too easy to lose one&#39;s footing in the forest at night.</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> Although the injuries we suffer here may go away once we return to reality, a Heroic Spirit still could never bear it if they were to let their Master come to harm.</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> Here, this way.</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> Will this area suffice?</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> Thank you, Master. You are too kind to come all this way just to listen to me talk about myself.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Don&#39;t worry about it. I just thought this would be easier for you.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I just figured it&#39;d be better to get away from the prying ears in the Command Room.</p><hr><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> ...Very true.</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> Let&#39;s see, how much did I tell you about my family before...</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> Well, I am Lord Yoshinaka&#39;s\u2013</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> ...I am the daughter of Nakahara-no-Kanetoh, foster-father of Kiso Yoshinaka. As such, I knew Lord Yoshinaka from youth.</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> I remember he and I got along far better than I ever did with my brothers, Kanemitsu and Kanehira.</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> Well, I suppose I should say half brothers,<br> as we had different mothers.</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> Now that I think of it, my mother&#39;s blood in my veins is most likely where my oni power comes from.</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> Though I&#39;ve also heard that some modern-day legends claim I was born when my mother was impregnated by the power of the dragon god residing in the Tomoe River&#39;s deep waters .</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> Whichever it was, perhaps that is the reason why I never spent much time with my brothers.</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> Instead, I spent most of my time in the Kiso Valley with Lord Komaoumaru\u2013Lord Yoshinaka that is.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> So you and Yoshinaka were friends ever since childhood.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> So you were together pretty much your whole lives then.</p><hr><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> Yes, we were.</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> Even when I became more onilike, and these monstrous horns started to poke out of my forehead...</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> ...Lord Yoshinaka was the only one who never batted an eye at it. All he did was tell me:</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> \u201CNow I see. So that is where your Monstrous Strength comes from. Then there is no need to hang your head in shame.\u201D</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> \u201CYou should be proud. With strength like that, you are more than worthy of being my right-hand woman.\u201D</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> ...Right before he tipped his head back and gave a delightful, boisterous laugh.</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> Now, let&#39;s see... This next story takes place after I had become one of Lord Yoshinaka&#39;s wives.</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> There was a woman I talked to shortly before the Battle of Kurikara...</p><p><strong>Yamabuki Gozen:</strong><br> (Sigh) Oh, Lady Tomoe.<br> How can you be both so strong and so weak?</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> Am I...truly helping Lord Yoshinaka?</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> As an archer, I cannot hold a candle to my brothers, the Kiso Elite Four. As a woman, you and Lady Fuyuhime are far more beautiful than I could ever hope to be...</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> And as his wife, I have not yet even been able to provide him with a child...</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> On top of all that, these protruding horns serve as a constant reminder of my inhuman nature...</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> So I cannot help but wonder if I will ever be able to accompany Lord Yoshinaka to the destination he seeks...</p><p><strong>Yamabuki Gozen:</strong><br> Come now, our dear Tomoe, you should know better than that. Don&#39;t let those horns stop you from holding your head high.</p><p><strong>Yamabuki Gozen:</strong><br> Both Lady Fuyuhime and I have every confidence in you. And need I remind you that I too have known you since we were both children, just as Lord Yoshinaka has?</p><p><strong>Yamabuki Gozen:</strong><br> We are all Lord Yoshinaka&#39;s wives. Ordinarily, that would likely mean we would be competing amongst ourselves for his favor.</p><p><strong>Yamabuki Gozen:</strong><br> And truth be told, Lady Fuyuhime and I dislike each other a great deal as a result of that.</p><p><strong>Yamabuki Gozen:</strong><br> But you, Tomoe...our dear Tomoe... You are different.</p><p><strong>Yamabuki Gozen:</strong><br> You are the only one of us who can fight. The only one who can stand by Lord Yoshinaka&#39;s side even on the battlefield.</p><p><strong>Yamabuki Gozen:</strong><br> While the rest of us can do little more than pray for his safe return, you have the power to actually protect him.</p><p><strong>Yamabuki Gozen:</strong><br> And what could be more fortunate than that?</p><p><strong>Yamabuki Gozen:</strong><br> So we are all counting on you to help Lord Yoshinaka in ways that we simply cannot.</p><p><strong>Yamabuki Gozen:</strong><br> No ordinary wife or concubine can be of help out on the field of battle, but you can be by Lord Yoshinaka&#39;s side wherever he goes.</p><p><strong>Yamabuki Gozen:</strong><br> As for your oni horns, so what!? Once you put on a matching headband, no other soldier will so much as look twice!</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> Lady Yamabuki...!</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> I... I had no idea you felt that way about me...</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> ...All right. I&#39;ve made up my mind.</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> I swear to you here and now that I will fight by Lord Yoshinaka&#39;s side on behalf of every woman who loves him!</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> And should the worst come to pass, and he meets his end on the battlefield, I am prepared to be with him in his final moments on all of your behalfs as well!</p><p><strong>Yamabuki Gozen:</strong></p><p>...Tomoe.</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> Yes!?</p><p><strong>Yamabuki Gozen:</strong></p><p>Don&#39;t you know better than to think about losing a battle before it&#39;s even begun!?</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> Oh, r-right! I&#39;m sorry!</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> ...We ended up winning the Battle of Kurikara by an overwhelming degree.</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> Lord Yoshinaka fought magnificently against the Taira clan&#39;s massive army, and led us right into the city of Kyoto.</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> But unfortunately, things do not always go as planned. Once Lord Yoshinaka had finally gained the position of Seii-Taishogun...</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> ...he lost his life soon after when Minamoto-no-Yoritomo ordered Minamoto-no-Noriyori and Minamoto-no-Yoshitsune to kill him.</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> And, I... I...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You weren&#39;t able to be there for him in his final moments.</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> No... I wasn&#39;t.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> ...I was unable to be there for him in his final moments.</p><hr><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> I failed to keep the promise I had made to Lady Yamabuki.</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> Before his death...Lord Yoshinaka told me to live.<br> To carry on no matter what.</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> I only learned that there was a deeper meaning to his words later, when I discovered I was pregnant with his child.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You mean...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Asahina Saburou Yoshihide?</p><hr><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> Yes. That was Yoshihide.</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> Though I pretended I had had him with Lord Wada Yoshimori, I never had any doubt that he was actually Lord Yoshinaka&#39;s son.</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> ...Shortly after Yoshihide was born, I decided to raise him as a normal woman. And I did.</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> By then, my oni horns had vanished from my forehead, and there was no sign left that I was anything other than human.</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> Once Yoshihide was all grown up, I prayed for Lord Yoshinaka&#39;s soul to rest in peace and lived out the rest of my life as a normal human.</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> Obviously, I had no idea about this until I became a Heroic Spirit, but I am told that even my corpse appeared to be perfectly ordinary.</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> You know, I always thought that I had lived my life by suppressing my oni urges, but now, I am not so sure.</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> If I had been there for Lord Yoshinaka&#39;s final moments...</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> ...my grief and rage may well have ended up turning me into a true oni, one more apt to devour my son than raise him.</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> And if that&#39;s true...that would mean Lord Yoshinaka saved me in more ways than one.</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> Wait. What am I doing!?</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> O-oh gosh, I&#39;m so sorry, Master. I didn&#39;t mean to go on and on about Lord Yoshinaka like that!</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> How strange... I had every intention of telling you about my family\u2013especially Yoshihide!</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> How strange... Where did I go wrong?</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> D-does this mean I can&#39;t even mention Lord Yoshinaka without getting completely sidetracked!?</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> U-um, perhaps I should start over at the beginning...</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> But no, wait. Even back then, I was still good friends with Lord Komaoumaru, so\u2013</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> It&#39;s okay. I got it.</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> A-are you sure?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> You still love Yoshinaka and Yoshihide even now, don&#39;t you?</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> I...</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> Yes! Yes, of course I do!</p><hr><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> Ahh, Master. [\u2642 Lord /\u2640\uFE0F Lady} Fujimaru. I wish Lord Yoshinaka and Yoshihide had had a chance to meet you.</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> If they had...I am certain you would all become as close as family yourselves.</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> After all\u2013</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> What&#39;s going on?</p><p><strong>F\uFF1ADa Vinci:</strong><br> Hey guys! Sorry to interrupt, but I&#39;m afraid I&#39;ve got some bad news!</p><p><strong>F\uFF1ADa Vinci:</strong><br> The idiot who was supposed to be monitoring the simulator decided to run a virus scan even though you guys were in there, and now it thinks you&#39;re malware that needs to be deleted!</p><p><strong>F\uFF1ADa Vinci:</strong><br> And it&#39;s decided to do that by sending some exceptionally powerful monsters your way. They&#39;re sort of functioning as antivirus software.</p><p><strong>F\uFF1ADa Vinci:</strong><br> We&#39;ll try to shut them down as soon as we can, but I&#39;m afraid you&#39;ll have to hold out on your own in the meantime!</p><p><strong>G\uFF1ADa Vinci:</strong><br> Hey guys!

I guess there really is no such thing as a perfect system...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Don&#39;t worry, we&#39;ll figure something out.</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> Right you are, Master.</p><hr><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> Very well then. However long it takes to resolve this situation, be it half a day or a full twenty-four hours...</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> ...I, Tomoe Gozen, shall see that no harm befalls my Master whatsoever!</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> Have at you, foul beasts!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> There!</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> ...I don&#39;t see any more enemies. There certainly were a lot of them, but it would seem that was the last of them.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Looks that way. Nice job.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> You did great, Tomoe.</p><hr><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> ...I do not deserve your kind words, Master. You would never have been in danger if I hadn&#39;t asked you to come here.</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> For that, I am terribly sorry.<br> Still, now that all is said and done...</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> I think...I do feel a little better!</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> Thank you so much for listening to me, my new Master.</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> I... Strictly speaking, I am not actually Tomoe Gozen.<br> I am simply a shadow of her cast by humanity.</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> Even this body you see here now is from the time when she spent her days on the battlefield.</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> While I do still have precious memories of the life she lived, my duty now is to keep you safe.</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> There is nothing more important to me now than ensuring you are able to live out your days in health and peace!</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> As such, I doubt there is anything to be gained from looking back at my past like this, so...please, just forget this whole thing ever happened.</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> From here on, I promise I will do my very best to never subject you to this shameful side of me again!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Not at all. I&#39;m glad you told me about this.</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> ...Thank you, Master.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> ...So what were you gonna say before we were interrupted?</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> Oh, yes. Well, um, after all...</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> ...After all, you also fight for something bigger than yourself.</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> And in that sense...I see a great many similarities between you and Lord Yoshinaka.</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> I truly believe you have the same inner spark as he did. One that shines with the same light and promise as the rays of the morning sun.</p><hr><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> The morning sun, huh...?</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> Absolutely!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I think you might be giving me way too much credit.</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> Not at all, Master! I assure you, I meant every word!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> There you are!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Thank goodness you two are all right!<br> We finally managed to shut down the virus scan!</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> Thank you, Lady Mash!</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> Not to worry, [\u2642 Lord /\u2640\uFE0F Lady} Fujimaru is safe and sound!</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> Wait right there!<br> I shall bring [\u2642 him /\u2640\uFE0F her} back in no time at all!</p>', 310);
