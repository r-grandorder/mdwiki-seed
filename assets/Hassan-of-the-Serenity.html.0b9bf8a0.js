A Skill granted to Hassan because of her conducts during her lifetime where she went into enemy territories unaided and moved to infiltrate for a long period of time according to the situation presented.

It becomes possible for Hassan to change her appearance at will and get close to the target she ought to assassinate. However, she is only able to shapeshift into a figure with a physique that is close to her owns. As long as this condition has been satisfied, it is also possible for her to shapeshift into a figure exactly like that of a particular individual\u2019s. Even if there are some differences in the body shape she wants to shapeshift into, because that has no effect on the condition being satisfied, it is further possible for her to shapeshift into the opposite sex.</p><p><strong>Poisoned Blade: [C++]</strong></p><p>Although the effect is generally the same as the Projectile (Dagger) Skill, it possesses a secondary effect of bestowing onto the target a Poison status effect.</p><p><strong>Dance of Silence: [B]</strong></p><p>The Hassan of the Serenity\u2019s dance scatters poison, weakening the target and enhancing the success rate of her Noble Phantasm\u2019s application. It is primarily a Skill that functions as a charm-type Skill.</p><p><strong>Door to Paradise: [B+]</strong></p><p>(It is fundamentally not used in \u201CFate/Grand Order\u201D)</p><h2 id="noble-phantasm-s" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#noble-phantasm-s" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Noble Phantasm(s)</h2><h1 id="zabaniyah-delusional-poison-body" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#zabaniyah-delusional-poison-body" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Zabaniyah: Delusional Poison Body</h1><ul><li>Rank: C</li><li>Classification: Anti-Personnel Noble Phantasm</li><li>Range: 0</li><li>Maximum Number of Targets: 1 person</li></ul><p>The Hassan of the Serenity\u2019s state of being where she continued to kill everyone who touched her by poison has been transformed into a Noble Phantasm. It results in death to living beings that touched her skin and bodily fluids. If they are armaments that are not Noble Phantasms, then it is also possible to corrode them instantly when they come into contact with her poison. Because she is not able to \u201Cadjust\u201D the poison inflicted towards living beings, opponents who touched her will be killed without fail. However, she is able to voluntarily determine whether the armaments she touches would be corroded or not.</p><p>Towards Servants, Hassan is not able to \u201Ckill them by simply touching them\u201D, but it is more than possible to do things such as causing them pain that slightly weakens their movements. It is also possible to cause damage and bad status effects to them if they happen to come into contact with her mucous membrane, such as through oral means. It is generally death for any being that comes into contact with her mucous membrane for a total of \u201Cthree times\u201D (In Fate/Grand Order, she attempts to touch her target three consecutive times with a single kiss).</p><p>Hassan also possesses a last resort that can be used only once\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014She bursts and scatters her body in all directions at point-blank range, throwing towards her enemy a massive quantity of her poisonous blood.</p><h1 id="character" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#character" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Character</h1><h2 id="pronouns" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#pronouns" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Pronouns</h2><p>First Person Pronoun: watashi<br> Second Person Pronouns: anata [kanji characters] / anata [hiragana characters]<br> Third Person Pronouns: kare / kanojo / aruji (lord), shujin (master) (in regard to her Master)</p><h2 id="personality" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#personality" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Personality</h2><p>As Hassan\u2019s title shows\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014a calm female assassin. Obedient, and lacking self-assertion. While she was alive, she was merely a girl who kept on conducting assassinations very mechanically. Even now where she became a Heroic Spirit, that characteristic is not that much different. However, towards people who do not die even if they touched her, she is quietly fanatical and shows devotion to them.</p><h2 id="attitude-towards-master" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#attitude-towards-master" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Attitude Towards Master</h2><p>Would one live if they touch her, or would they die? This is the point Hassan views as the most important. If it is the former result, it seems she would dedicate her unconditional loyalty. If it is for the sake of her master, she will do literally anything. For example, even if a genocide comes about, her facial expression does not even change, and she displays obedience without even talking back. Concerning her, who accepted that \u201Ceveryone will die if they touch me\u201D as a matter of course, the existence of \u201Ca master who does not die even if they touch me\u201D becomes her best delight.</p><h2 id="dialogue-examples" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#dialogue-examples" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Dialogue Examples</h2><p>\u201CEverything, everything\u2026 as the Lord\u2019s will dictates.\u201D</p><p>\u201CWill you live?\u201D</p><p>\u201CI guess you will die too.\u201D</p><p>\u201CI am sorry.

One of the successive Hassan-i Sabb\u0101h who served as the \u201COld Man of the Mountain\u201D \u2013 the founder of the Assassins, it is said that during her lifetime, she was a master of poison who possessed the alias of \u201CThe Hassan of the Serenity\u201D.</p><p>The \u201CPoison Girl\u201D spoken of all over the world and in every era, beginning with India of the BC era, was in reality put together by the Assassins as a tool of assassination. The outward appearance of a beautiful girl is a purely trifling matter. Her body resists every single poison, while simultaneously, it is a lump of poison too. Not only her nails, but even her skin and bodily fluids would act as deadly poison as well, quietly taking away the lives of kings, nobles and military generals in their sleeping quarters\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>Although she killed many people, Hassan would also frequently establish a relationship with her assassination target(s), such as being related to them as a lover or a fianc\xE9e. That is to say, she kept on repeating the deed where, despite constructing with her own hands a \u201Cfalse happiness\u201D that could not be fulfilled, she would steal that happiness away anyways with her own hands. Gradually, her mind creaked. Her mind was expected to be toughened and tempered thoroughly, seeing that she was made use of and employed as a \u201CPoison Girl\u201D that was built up by the Assassins, but\u2026</p><p>In her last moments, maybe Hassan\u2019s head was decapitated by a general from a certain army who suspected her behaviour of not even holding hands, maybe she personally exposed her true character as an assassin and begged the general \u201CPlease, kill me\u201D\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014or maybe, she was put to the sword by someone\u2019s hand during the gap where the general incidentally took his eyes off of her.</p><h2 id="related-characters" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#related-characters" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Related Characters</h2><p><strong>Heracles</strong></p><p>\u201CAssuming even in the unlikely event that he died due to my poison on one occasion, if it is with the effect of that hero\u2019s Noble Phantasm, he should be \u201Cunable to die a second time to the same poison\u201D\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014In other words, he truly\u2026?\u201D</p><p><strong>Arash</strong></p><p>\u201CUnexpectedly, a companion who would not die even if he had touched me.

Above all, it is because it seems fun to be at Chaldea. That is good to know, yeah? In relation to her design, I used elder sister Asako of the Hundred Faces as her base. She is similar to an imp \u2013 to a black cat. Since she is a child who likes cute things, it is satisfying to be able to put accessories on her as well as giving her cute items.
