She was but a very, very normal girl who simply loved books.<br> However, due to the shutdown of the convent she lived in by the revolutionary government, and with political strife spreading throughout the provinces, gradually the hatred she felt towards the Jacobin party grew.</p><p>Eventually, she chose Marat, one of the three great figureheads of the Jacobin party, as her target for assassination.<br> Her plan was extraordinarily simple. Marat, who at the time received information from people of all kinds of classes, committed the folly of leaving himself alone with her just because she had claimed to have a tip.</p><p>Be that as it may, had the assassin been a man then even Marat would probably have exercised some degree of caution.<br> If there was a reason for his misjudgement, then it is perhaps her all too lovely appearance that was the cause.<br> But then again, there is also the point of view that Marat, who at the time was afflicted with a skin disease, had mostly detached himself from politics...</p><p>Incidentally, the one who passed her through the guillotine was none other than Charles-Henri Sanson.<br> Though Sanson had no interest in her loveliness, it is said that he was deeply touched by a woman who so resolutely faced forward onto her death, even to the point of flashing a smile.<br> Three months later, Sanson would by his own hands have to pass another woman flashing a similar smile to Charlotte through the guillotine.</p><h2 id="character-in-fgo" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#character-in-fgo" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Character in FGO</h2><p>Corday, who believed she had made the world a better place by killing Marat, even if just by a little, felt an awful shock at the realisation that what she had wrought had instead incurred the decline of the revolution.</p><p>Though now summoned, and lacking confidence, she convinced herself at the time that she would just fight in whatever way she was ordered.</p><p>But in actuality, it\u2019s not like the world is something that changes with just the slash of a single blade. It is something that changes through the concerted efforts of either countless heroes or nameless people.</p><p>She herself just happened to be one of those few chosen.<br> If anything, that\u2019s precisely why she has to rise to the occasion.</p><p>Thus, Corday\u2019s gonna do her best!<br> Whether she said the above or not is uncertain (she probably did not).</p><p>Though she still lacks the confidence to talk to the people involved with the french revolution, she feels as though it would be nice if she could gradually get there.</p><p>In regards to the protagonist, as a powerless and nameless existence like herself, she holds respect, yearning, passion, and all kinds of needlessly complicated, or perhaps quite simple, feelings towards them.</p><h2 id="in-atlantis" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#in-atlantis" aria-hidden="true">#</a> In Atlantis</h2><p>For love at first sight, it was an all too twisted way of meeting someone.<br> She did not fall in love because she had been saved, but for the sake of having been able to save them</p><p>Helpless and wounded, a life that would probably have drawn its last breath had she just kept it outside her notice.<br> Precisely because such twistedness was there, did she yearn for the boy/girl and decide to follow them.</p><p>Even though the end may await ahead, she believed that she would not regret it.<br> And so even though she harboured such terrible regrets, overwhelmed by excessive emotion she still let out these words.</p><p>\u201COh, please do forgive me.<br> This was my indulgent and very first love.\u201D</p><p>And so Charlotte Corday accomplished the brilliant feat of assassinating Odysseus, fading into the twilit sky.</p><h2 id="standard-weapons" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#standard-weapons" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Standard Weapons</h2><p>Knife<br> Cuts very well.</p><h2 id="related-characters" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#related-characters" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Related Characters</h2><p><strong>Charles-Henri Sanson</strong></p><p>A kind executioner.<br> Corday feels well towards him, holding no particular bias against him.<br> Still, she feels a bit bad at the expression on his face filled with guilt whenever he looks at her and so occasionally stops at just greeting him.</p><p><strong>Those Involved in the French Revolution</strong></p><p>She has complicated feelings about them.<br> She holds especially complicated feelings towards Marie Antionette, even a bit astonished.<br> Why, and how can she love France so?<br> Perhaps the day will come when the two can speak about that.</p><p><strong>The folks in Atlantis</strong></p><p>Though she may not have the memories, they are members she gets along with mysteriously well, occasionally getting together with them in the cafeteria.<br> Being treated so crudely by Jason too, feels almost as if she has gained a bigger brother, which she rather likes.</p><h2 id="comment-from-the-illustrator" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#comment-from-the-illustrator" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Comment from the Illustrator</h2><p>If I remember correctly, \u2018a normal and cute girl\u2019 was the kind of instruction I received. I tried bringing out a kind of cliched cuteness that I\u2019d always wanted to draw at some point. What do you think? A bit too much of a normal girl? Is that fine? I worried about that a lot.
