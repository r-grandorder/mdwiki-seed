Even as a Heroic Spirit, it is not a Noble Phantasm he can bring forth automatically. Thus, in regular Holy Grail Wars, he can only use this emulated medicine. Its effects are less pronounced, and several conditions must be met to be able to bring back the dead through this medicine, such as the post-mortem interval as well as the body\u2019s condition.

Blood from Gorgon\u2019s left side had the power to destroy men, while blood from her right side had the power to save men. In truth, simply taking blood from Gorgon was not enough for it to work, as resurrecting Hippolytus was said to have been possible \u201Cwith Artemis\u2019 power\u201D. The resurrection medicine was first completed because the blood was incorporated with the power of a pure god (Athena and Artemis-class).

He won\u2019t interact with others by choice except for medical reasons. Neither is he interested in others.</p><p>He considers himself an excellent doctor which is an absolute assessment rather than a relative assessment. He neither needlessly scorns nor looks down on others. But if the need arises, he would nonchalantly say, \u201CI am far better than you.

He was also a member of the Argonauts led by Jason.</p><p>His father is Apollo, one of the twelve Olympians. Apollo became romantically involved with a woman named Coronis and got her pregnant. However, after learning of her infidelity from a crow (which was said to be a lie in some versions), he killed Coronis and turned the crow\u2019s white feathers black in a fit of rage.<br> Apollo regretted killing Coronis. When she was laid on her funeral pyre, he rescued the child (Asclepius) inside her belly and entrusted him to Chiron, the wise centaur, to raise him.</p><p>Asclepius studied medicine and hunting under Chiron and later began showing talent in medicine that surpassed Chiron. By creating a medicine with Gorgon\u2019s blood given to him by Athena, he eventually succeeded in resurrecting the dead.</p><p>Unfortunately, this feat posed a problem. If men were to conquer death, the Underworld would lose its value. Sensing an impending crisis, Hades turned to Zeus (he could not harm him himself because Asclepius was a son of Apollo) and Zeus killed Asclepius with a bolt of lighting. In order to appease the enraged Apollo, Zeus deified Asclepius and turned him into the constellation Ophiuchus.</p><h2 id="character-in-fgo" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#character-in-fgo" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Character in FGO</h2><p>A mad doctor who is only interested in the advancement of medicine.</p><p>His medicine encompasses all fields including clinical pharmacology, surgery, as well as medical magecraft, and is highly effective.

He often performs unnecessarily experimental and dangerous treatments, the likes that would make another doctor\u2019s blood run cold.</p><p>Because of his own genius abilities, his treatments still end up in success. Patients with no medical knowledge would simply exclaim, \u201CI\u2019m healed! This man really is an amazing doctor!\u201D This is the reason behind his reputation.</p><p>His one and only goal is \u201Cto continue devoting himself to his medicine in order to advance it\u201D. But there\u2019s one thing he can never forgive: Zeus&#39; cruel treatment of him. Even after manifesting as a Servant, he still bears anger and hatred due to the fact that he was killed by a god.</p><p>Why did I have to die?<br> All I wanted was to devote myself to medicine. I excelled in medicine, that\u2019s all. Why did I have to be killed?<br> You turned me into a constellation and a god after my death. Do you think I\u2019d forgive you because of that?</p><p>The flames of rage directed at that god\u2019s selfish and unfair treatment will never die down.<br> Having been summoned by the King of the Indian Lostbelt who aimed to reach \u201Ca perfect utopia\u201D by eliminating all impurities and embedded a divinity he stole in Asclepius, his rage intensified and went berserk.</p><p>Rejecting those who excel for their superiority must not be allowed.<br> Between things superior and things inferior, those superior ought to remain.<br> That is the inherent and proper nature of the world\u2014</p><p>Adhering to the extreme tenet of this Lostbelt, he began to act as a Servant of the King\u2014a L\u014Dkap\u0101la.</p><p>\u2666</p><p>If you ask him, \u201CWhy are you so intent on advancing medicine?\u201D his first reaction would be puzzlement.</p><p>He himself probably hasn\u2019t realized that the answer is right there. It might have been an initial impulse to him, but he himself has forgotten about it. The reason is so natural to him that he himself has forgotten about it. That\u2019s why he will never say it.</p><p>The answer is clear and simple: \u201CI aimed to advance medicine for the future. In other words, for posterity.\u201D His love for humanity.</p><p>If you have stayed by his side and spent time with him, the answer might come to you naturally. At the very least, the heroes who sailed with him in the Argo had more or less realized it. Telling him would put him in a sour mood, though. It will bring out his orneriness, and there\u2019s a possibility that he would head in the wrong direction so they made sure not to tell him.</p><p>Going deeper, the reason for that initial impulse might be a personal one.<br> By advancing medicine even further and successfully conquering death, no one will have to meet a pitiful end due to the gods\u2019 foolishness just like my mother...<br> In other words, his reason might be \u201C(indirect) salvation for the mother I never met, whose death at the hands of the gods left me bereaved\u201D.</p><h2 id="standard-weapons" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#standard-weapons" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Standard Weapons</h2><p>Rod of Asclepius</p><p>Snake</p><p>Medicine</p><h2 id="related-characters" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#related-characters" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Related Characters</h2><p><strong>The thing on top of Paris\u2019 head</strong></p><p>\u2026</p><p><strong>Nightingale</strong></p><p>Some of her words and actions do not quite make sense to me, but we are aiming for the same goal\u2026 That&#39;s the impression I get.
