I had no intention of intervening, but seeing how useless you were, I could not just stand and watch.\u201D</p><p>...Hmph.</p><p>In that case, you ought to have ignored it and moved on.</p><hr><p>\u201CTh... Thank you!\u201D</p><p>The calico that was handed over to Saegusa seems to feel safe enough to curl up against her, as if in a mother cat-like embrace.</p><p>...I hate to admit it, but the credit for saving this kitten does go to Archer.</p><hr><p>\u201CUm, your name...?\u201D</p><p>\u201CNobody important. Just a stroke of luck.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201COoh, so cool.</p><p>Just like a hero of justice.\u201D</p><p>\u201C........................................Hm?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CWait, what are you implying, Makidera.\u201D</p><p>\u201CIsn&#39;t he, though?</p><p>Appearing like a hurricane out of nowhere, helping the weak.\u201D</p><p>\u201CIndeed, yet humble enough to not boast about it.\u201D</p><p>\u201CJust like a hero out of a historical drama, so lovely.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C...That is not a good thing.</p><p>The title of &quot;hero of justice&quot; should be used with restraint.</p><p>Creating a powerful hero, you see, at the same time gives birth to a powerful enemy.</p><p>What lies ahead is an endless bloody struggle. No compromise, no middle way... nothing but conflict.</p><p>Listen, ladies. It is okay to obsess over something, but getting carried away with it is not.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CHuh... oh. So you shouldn&#39;t try to be a master at any one thing?\u201D</p><p>\u201COh no, skill isn&#39;t the problem, but ideology is.</p><p>Viewed from the other side, this so-called &quot;hero of justice&quot; is nothing but an enemy...\u201D</p><p>\u201CWhat are you saying? A hero of justice is awesome. The guy everyone loves!</p><p>And above all, nice and simple. It&#39;s great!\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CThe name is the only simple thing about it.</p><p>What&#39;s inside is a clump of contradictions. The likes of a &quot;hero of justice&quot; are but an empty dream that misfits of human society yearn for.</p><p>Assuming that &quot;justice&quot; truly exists, society has no need for such a hero. In that case, the real &quot;evil&quot; is in the people&#39;s hearts, the longing for a &quot;hero of justice&quot; to oppose the world they could not cope with.</p><p>...Well, how shall I put it... The words &quot;hero of justice&quot; are just another name for human weakness.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C..................\u201D</p><p>Archer&#39;s monologue goes on.</p><p>I&#39;d like to make an objection or two, but, having been unable to save the kitten, I have no choice but to shut up and listen.</p><hr><p>\u201CAnd that&#39;s why all of you ought to be informed...\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CAhaha, no need to be shy when you&#39;re this old.\u201D</p><p>\u201CIndeed. So desiring justice to be served is evil, is it. Wonderful.\u201D</p><p>\u201CCome on, kitty should give thanks to Mr. Hero of Justice too.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CW-Wait a moment. What was it that I&#39;ve just said?</p><p>...It can&#39;t be helped. It might get a little long, but that is what I get for saving a kitten on a whim. Let me correct that.</p><p>Take, for instance, this kitten. It sure is great to be saved by a hero of justice, isn&#39;t it? However, inside the rescued creature&#39;s mind, a belief is now forming that, should it fall in trouble, a miraculous being will once again come to save it. And don&#39;t you think that would impede this creature&#39;s growth to adulthood, its evolution? The very idea of a &quot;hero of justice&quot; being a self-satisfying hypocritical complacency that ignores all but the result, being a concept that actually hinders someone, is something you haven&#39;t even considered until...\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CKitty doesn&#39;t understand difficult stuff like that. Kitty likes Mr. Hero of Justice now, see?\u201D</p><p>\u201CA guardian&#39;s pride, isn&#39;t it? Extending a helping hand isn&#39;t something you do just once, it is something you ought to be prepared to offer for the remainder of one&#39;s lifetime, in other words.\u201D</p><p>\u201CSo, it&#39;s fine whichever way you take it, right?</p><p>For a hero of justice, you sure do lecture a lot.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CAs I&#39;ve been saying, calling me a &quot;hero of justice&quot; isn&#39;t...\u201D</p><p>\u201CBut you wouldn&#39;t tell your name, what else are we supposed to use?\u201D</p><p>\u201CBeing so critical and self-depreciating, it&#39;s only making you more and more interesting.\u201D</p><p>\u201CCuteness is justice, here, look.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CKuh! Stop staring at me with such round eyes, kitten...!</p><p>I only helped you because you were a cat, humans don&#39;t get the same treatment...!\u201D</p><p>\u201CBut the kitty reaaally likes you now\uFF5E\u201D</p><p>\u201COh, it&#39;s true. He&#39;s even rubbing your arm with his paw, isn&#39;t he?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CMuh... Hey, kid.</p><p>Tell me, where did your typical rudeness go to?</p><p>Looks like you really like the cat, you&#39;ve hardly said a thing this time.\u201D</p><p>\u201C...No, not really.</p><p>Since I was powerless to do anything, I don&#39;t really have the right to be talking back to its savior.</p><p>Also, it looks like it&#39;s taken quite a liking to you.\u201D</p><p>&quot;Fell in love,&quot; you could say.</p><hr><p>\u201CGuh...Well, I have nothing more to say.</p><p>I&#39;m pretty busy, so I&#39;ll just take my leave.</p><p>Ladies, let this kitten go. If it cannot learn its lesson this time, it will always remain but a kitten.\u201D</p><p>And on that sad note, Archer walks away, leaving the rest of us to indulge in this deep emotion.</p><hr><p>\u201CAh, he&#39;s gone... What&#39;s up with him, anyway?\u201D</p><p>\u201CWhat, the red Justice guy totally has no manners.\u201D</p><p>\u201CHe must be very shy. I&#39;m sure he was not actually offended... he seems to be hiding a happy smile of his own.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C........................\u201D</p><p>Archer has left.</p><p>There are more than a few things I&#39;d like to say, but in the end, I can&#39;t do it in front of the guy that just saved a kitten.</p><hr><p>\u201C...Damn, I need more training.\u201D</p><p>I fall on my knees in despair.</p><p>The sense of defeat weighs heavily on my back.</p><hr><p>\u201CHeh... Learn kung-fu, you dolt.\u201D</p><p>\u201CWait, why are you sitting down on me?\u201D</p><p>\u201CNyaa, since you won&#39;t ever get up, maybe you want to be laid uponyaa.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C..................\u201D</p><p>Go ahead, rub it in.</p><p>&quot;Cheer up!&quot; say the round pupils, looking at me.</p><p>Wahh, to be pitied even by the kittens... Dammit, if only I was <ruby>stronger<rt>taller</rt></ruby>...!</p><hr><h3 id="emiya-s\u30FBday-4-pool-and-the-mystic-eyes-seal" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#emiya-s\u30FBday-4-pool-and-the-mystic-eyes-seal" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Emiya&#39;s\u30FBDay 4 Pool and the Mystic Eyes seal</h3><hr><p>\u201CThank you, Shirou. Sorry for taking up your time.\u201D</p><p>\u201COh no, it&#39;s me who should be apologizing for the intrusion. Bringing tea is the least I can do.\u201D</p><p>Taking her cup from the tray, Rider quietly nods her thanks.</p><p>Everyone has their favorite cup. The one with the cat pattern is Tohsaka&#39;s, the girly one is Sakura&#39;s, Saber&#39;s is blue and white Seto porcelain, and Rider&#39;s a large Bizenware cup.</p><p>It goes without saying that Fuji-Nee has a magnificent tiger-striped piece.</p><hr><p>\u201C...Alright then.\u201D</p><p>I shall devote myself to some relaxed reading this afternoon.</p><p>...But then, just barging in, taking a book and leaving is kind of rude.</p><p>Rider, our very own bibliophile, does not seem to mind. However, she doesn&#39;t seem to have any other leisure activities\u2015\u2015\u2015a silly scene pops up in my head.</p><hr><p>\u201C...For some reason, you seem to be troubled.\u201D</p><p>\u201COh, I&#39;m relatively calm...\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015Do you want to invite me someplace?\u201D</p><p>I&#39;m having trouble with a reply.</p><p>To say that I don&#39;t would be a lie.</p><hr><p>\u201CMmph. Please don&#39;t tease me like that.\u201D</p><p>\u201CI have no such intention. Speaking of that, Shirou.\u201D</p><p>\u201CWhat?\u201D</p><p>\u201CDo you happen to know about the pool in Shinto?\u201D</p><p>\u201CAh... Waku Waku Splash, is it?\u201D</p><hr><p>It&#39;s an indoor, all-weather dome-type water resort\u2015\u2015\u2015one dazzling title. Like an okonomiyaki made with top-grade wheat flour and eggs, put in a box, then decorated with ribbons and golden leaves. That&#39;s the kind of recreational facility it aims to be. In short, it&#39;s a pool.</p><p>Out of nowhere, it has popped up in Shinto, taking me completely by surprise.</p><hr><p>\u201CLooks like it&#39;s up and running already.\u201D</p><p>\u201CIndeed, it is. I was quite surprised when I found out, as well. It is rather convenient. The fact that whether it&#39;s winter or rain, it&#39;s open all seasons, that is.\u201D</p><p>She keeps nodding. It truly is an impressive concept.</p><p>However, seeing Rider bring up a topic like this is a bit unusual.</p><hr><p>\u201CHave you gone there already?\u201D</p><p>\u201CYes, twice so far.\u201D</p><p>Oho, the plot thickens.</p><p>Moreover, seeing Rider, the adult representative of the Emiya household, in a swimsuit is nothing short of a luxury.</p><hr><p>\u201COh...? So you did have a swimsuit.\u201D</p><p>\u201CI have picked mine while shopping together with Sakura. Would you like to see\u2015\u2015\u2015Shirou?\u201D</p><p>...D-Don&#39;t ask that with a sidelong glance, you&#39;re not leaving much room for misunderstanding.</p><p>Rider putting on a swimsuit is like an ogre taking a metal club, so to speak, or Saber wielding the Excalibur, quickly approaching the &quot;invincible&quot; territory.</p><hr><p>\u201C...I would, but...</p><p>Rider, when you went to the Splash, has there been much trouble?\u201D</p><p>Had I been there, I would have caused some, no doubt.</p><hr><p>\u201CYes... There&#39;s been a lot of males calling out.\u201D</p><p>\u201CThat&#39;s because of you, Rider... But to think that you went to the pool, alone...\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CWell... Sometimes, I long for a swim, like in the past.\u201D</p><p>I nod to those words.</p><p>Chalk white of the palace walls against the deep blue of the Aegean sea. That&#39;s how her home must have looked like.</p><hr><p>\u201CStill, it is an interesting establishment. You could invite one of the females to go along, too.\u201D</p><p>That&#39;s right, that&#39;s what she&#39;s suggesting, with a smile.</p><p>A pool date with a girl. So much potential, divine punishment is inevitable.</p><hr><p>However.</p><p>\u201C............\u201D</p><p>That aside, what bothers me is that the person in front of me is talking almost as if she isn&#39;t one.

I have a feeling it won&#39;t end well, in more ways than one.\u201D</p><hr><p>...I tried. Sadly, that&#39;s not the answer I hoped for.
