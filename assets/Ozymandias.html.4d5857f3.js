It is an anti-fortress Noble Phantasm that utilized magic energy bombardment by means of the &quot;Dendera Light Bulb&quot; as its main method of offense, but in FateGO itcan perform an anti-unit offense by means of a large mass attack as a last resort. A terrifying method of attack that has the enormous Great Temple Complex appears on the sky and crushes down the enemy line by means of large mass. In addition, it has its base strengthened by means of the magic energy brought about by the Dendera light bulb.</p><p>Why is it that the likes of Great Temple of Dendera that was not built by him exists within the Great Temple Complex? The reason originates from Ozymandias&#39; bygone days. As he built a great numbers of enormous temples, he simultaneously stated that &quot;all temples, be they exist in past, present, or future, exists for my sake.&quot; He even performed glorifications and revisement to a large numbers of temples built before his days and made them his own. Even in the current present of 21st century, the one who have his name engraved unto most of the various Egypt monuments is none other than he, Pharaoh Ozymandias (Ramesseum II).</p><p>(There is one theory stating that various princes who idolized him had his name be left in history far and wide.)</p><p>(TLnote: Ramesseum is the name of the mortuary temple of Ramesses II aka Ozy. Tentyris is the latin name for the city of Dendera, where the Great Temple of Dendera resides. My guess is Ozy&#39;s NP name coins this 2 term together simply because it alludes to Ozy making Dendera temple and consequently Dendera light bulb his own.)</p><h1 id="abu-hol-sphinx-lion-bodied-beasts-of-hot-sand" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#abu-hol-sphinx-lion-bodied-beasts-of-hot-sand" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Abu Hol Sphinx - Lion-Bodied Beasts of Hot Sand</h1><ul><li>Rank: A</li><li>Type: Anti-Army Noble Phantasm</li><li>Range: 2~50</li><li>Maximum target: 300 person</li></ul><p>Abu Hol Sphinx.<br> The incarnation of the sky god Horus and the manifestation of raging fire and wind that strikes fear upon the people, a beast with the body of a lion and the face of man that was told of in Ancient Egypt legend.<br> Even in Modern Egypt, its existence was left behind within their language as the Father of Fear (Abu Hol).<br> During the sixth chapter of part one they made quite a frequent appearance-----but they fundamentally are not utilized in FateGO.<br> In addition, within the aforementioned Great Temple Complex of Radiance sleeps the leader specimen that ruled over these sphinxes, the sphinx of Wehem Mesut.
