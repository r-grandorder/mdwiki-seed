There are two reasons why Sion believed this to be true. The first being the Sixth Singularity in which Sherlock Holmes got information by being in sync with TRI HERMES. A mere Heroic Spirit would have their Spirit Origin burst due to information overload. The second was that he stopped thinking about the \u201CForeign God\u2019s\u201D motive by becoming Chaldea\u2019s ally.</p><p>Sion says that the \u201CForeign God\u201D wanted him to cooperate with Chaldea.

Both seem pretty relieved that there\u2019s no complications with it. Mashu seems to have an easier time with it and with Black Barrel. However, while Mashu is growing stronger and almost equivalent to a Top Servant, Da Vinci places a restriction on Black Barrel. The main usage for it now is \u201CBombardment via Mana Compression\u201D. The calculation of Life Scale using Accomplish Measure, the formation of the Black Barrel and the creation of Dead Counter are forbidden because it puts too much strain on both the user and the Master. As well as the ban on using it in urban areas since it\u2019ll potentially harm civilians and the effects are wide. This much was relayed to Fujimaru Ritsuka.</p><p><img src="https://i.redd.it/qt8uvihbc48a1.png" alt=""></p><p>Da Vinci informs Mashu that the Black Barrel weaponizes the \u201CConcept of Death\u201D and the Atlas Institute deems it a hazard. Regular Servants as they materialize are created via Ether since they can\u2019t grow any stronger than what they were when they\u2019re recorded in the Throne of Heroes. With the concept of a Demi-Servant, Mashu\u2019s Saint Graph is growing due to her physical and mental growth.</p><p>The problem here is that Mashu is being more Heroic Spirit-like as she continues to live out her days. Da Vinci lectures her by telling her that Servants are \u201CGhost Liner: Boundary Record Belts\u201D. The more power Mashu seeks, the more she\u2019ll stop being \u201CDemi\u201D. Da Vinci tells Mashu that if she feels bad about something, she can take off Ortenaus and head back to the Border since she has companions at Novum Chaldea. Da Vinci also mentions that Fujimaru or her haven&#39;t given up on Olga Marie.</p><p><img src="https://i.redd.it/jink2ugcc48a1.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong></p><blockquote><p>The ship will soon be passing through Central America!

Novum Chaldea, everyone station yourselves!</p><p>While we are carrying out this operation urgently, preparations have been completed beforehand.</p><p>So there\u2019s nothing to be worried about! Right, Technical Advisor!?</p></blockquote><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong></p><blockquote><p>Of course. We have our ace against the \u201CForeign God\u201D.</p><p>A sacred sword that\u2019s augmented with the concept of a sacred sword\u2014</p><p>It\u2019s shown to have a 99.99% success rate. So there won\u2019t be any problems with it in battle including the transformation sequence.</p></blockquote><p>Goredolf is amazed and curious about this. He assumes that it\u2019ll be an artillery weapon that\u2019ll be fired once the transformation sequence is completed. Muniere tells Goredolf that the Marines will be the one firing it. Sion digresses and asks Goredolf if he wants to hear about the analysis of Specimen: E.</p><p><img src="https://i.redd.it/dglz4c2gc48a1.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Sion:</strong></p><ol><li>The operating room is on the same level of our civilization. It\u2019s all state of the art equipment.</li><li>\u201CSpecimen: E\u201D is an unknown lifeform. TRISMEGISTUS II has no corresponding data regarding it.</li><li>There was a large amount of blood and cells detected in the room, but was wiped clean. This was from a human.</li></ol><p>Analysis is far from done, Sion says. But for now she has stopped TRISMEGISTUS II\u2019s analysis to focus on this mission. You ask if a murder occurred due to Point #3. Sion replies that you have a keen eye, but answers that assuming that it was self-inflicted harm, then yes, a murder did happen.</p><p>Mashu asks if the blood was the result of some kind of operation from the operating table. Sion replies that it is half possible. The reason why it\u2019s not fully possible is that blood would never travel far or even 1 meter from the operating table. Nemo interrupts them by announcing that they\u2019re approaching their destination.</p><p><img src="https://i.redd.it/k8l65b0jc48a1.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Professor Nemo:</strong></p><blockquote><p>TRISMEGISTUS II has recommended that 4 Servants be summoned for this mission~.</p><p>Normally you would use your energy to summon after you\u2019ve landed in the Lostbelt, but Britain set a precedent for us.</p><p>The first Servant who\u2019s been summoned is headed towards the Control Room.</p><p>The other three Servants will join you momentarily.</p></blockquote><p>Goredolf says that what Professor Nemo said is right. Summoning in a Lostbelt is not ideal anymore. He goes on about how South America is an cruel land, therefore the Servant has to be strong, cruel, uncivilized and gorilla-like who acts monkey-like.</p><p><img src="https://i.redd.it/r8lbquyjc48a1.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong></p><blockquote><p>Who are you calling an ape!

As you can see, I\u2019ve responded to your wish for assistance.</p></blockquote><p>Nitocris states that she is summoned from Chaldea\u2019s record of Nitocris\u2019s Saint Graph.

She also has Independent Action attached to her as well.</p><p>Kadoc is surprised that she\u2019s able to act like this and agree to helping Chaldea which makes him assume that she has a lot of faith in Fujimaru.

However, you and Mashu get to see a vomiting U-Olga Marie because of sensory overload. Mashu advises reducing the sensitivity to help her out and adapt and U-Olga Marie heeds that advice.</p><p>U-Olga Marie asks if Mashu is a human, but Mashu introduces herself and answers that she\u2019s a demi-human.

Teppu states that they eat this for pleasure only. Nemo Marine and Tepeu have a conversation about what a corn field can be useful for. U-Olga Marie states that this is for ethanol as well, but asks if something like this is also food for humans as well. Mashu says that depending on the usage, corn fields are cultivated differently.</p><p><img src="https://i.redd.it/39iatheejh8a1.png" alt=""></p><p>Habetrot tells Fujimaru that it\u2019s been six hours since we left the cave and the sun hasn\u2019t set.

U-Olga Marie adds that this could be \u201Ccelestial travel\u201D where there\u2019s no rotation or revolution. She doesn\u2019t know where it\u2019s being controlled but it\u2019s something that humanity can\u2019t achieve with its current technology.

He has never heard the word ocean before.</p><p><img src="https://i.redd.it/mwz2vga2mh8a1.png" alt=""></p><p>Tepeu states that there are a rare number of deinos who have adapted to aquatic life because usually deinos and their skeleton would enlarge causing them to have difficulty moving on land. After learning democracy and communism, Tepeu has figured out how politics and society functions and wants to move on to the next topic. He\u2019s amazed at how civilization has evolved over the years.

He puts up an analogy of how our chronology is like a constantly pattern-changing cube.</p><p><img src="https://i.redd.it/58t066i6mh8a1.png" alt=""></p><p>Mashu states that Tepeu would always keep talking and asking questions about many things like laws and the like. You wonder if he is an exceptional deinos. Nemo Marine asks if he became a hermit because of how smart he was. Tepeu rephrases that entire question into one term, a heretic. Tepeu affirms the question and states that since his thought process wasn\u2019t on the same wavelength as the other deinos, he moved to the first layer.</p><p><strong>Tepeu:</strong></p><blockquote><p>Deinos possess no intellect. Our bodies do not need to be supplemented with knowledge.</p><p>Homo sapiens have a short lifespan, get easily hurt, and are inferior to other lifeforms in regards to survivability.</p><p>That is why they develop their body and intellect. But we, deinos, <strong>are a different case</strong>.</p><p>Mictlan has no such threats. Therefore, evolution was unnecessary.</p></blockquote><p>Tepeu is also amazed about the digestive system of the human body, and how it allows you to remove the toxins of a plant and absorb its nutrients. He envies you for being able to use many plants as food.</p><p><img src="https://i.redd.it/ovatl7r9mh8a1.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Tepeu:</strong></p><blockquote><p>Now then, the deinos\u2019 ecology and their origin.</p><p>We, deinos, are the mankind of this Lostbelt\u2026the apex species entrusted with the management of this world.</p><p>Long long ago, our ancestors migrated from the surface when Mictlan was created.</p><p>Our ancestors were lifeforms that resembled \u201Cdinosaurs\u201D in Pan-Human History.</p><p>As Mashu pointed out, dinosaurs are categorized differently with aquatic reptiles, plesiosaurs and flying plesiosaurs and land wandering theropods, and a lot more.</p><p>The deinos here were mostly theropods.</p><p>Yet, Maia has a bit of control with our birth, so there were a few pterosaurs and plesiosaurs.</p><p>In reality, pterosaurs were a rare species.</p><p>Earlier I used the word, \u201Cheretic\u201D, but that was because I was removed from my group due to my speech and conduct.</p><p>Meanwhile, pterosaurs and plesiosaurs were deemed \u201Cheretics\u201D at birth.</p><p>I\u2019ve heard that dinosaurs are mainly herbivores with a few of them being carnivores, but we are all herbivores.</p><p>Carnivorous deinos do not exist.</p><p>Eating meat would cause the inability to break up toxins, pain, loss of intellect and eventually die.</p><p>The savage deinos who attacked us were in that state.</p><p>They either abandoned their intellect before death or became maniacal when being administered poison by the Ocelotl.</p></blockquote><p>Nemo Marine tells Tepeu that it is such a cruel thing to do as if the Ocelotl are torturing them.

Mashu asks if they are the Xochitonal to which Tepeu asks if Pan-Human History have similar underworlds. Mashu talks about Mictlan in Pan-Human History that consists of a Heaven that has thirteen layers, Earth that resides humans and Mictlan which has nine layers. People who naturally die and not through battle go through Mictlan and when they conquer all the trials then their souls return back to nature.</p><p>Mashu also explains about the cruelty of the Aztecs with sacrifices, slavery and perpetual fights.

When the Earth was declined by the gods, it became the world of death.

The gods threw everything from the world into the sea of milk to create the immortality elixir, Amrita. Thus, the white elephant, Airavata, came into being.</p><p>Tepeu is interested in what he\u2019s heard from Kingprotea.

Tepeu corrects everyone on one last thing. The pillars are not crystals, but rather, vegetation. Tepeu notes everyone to notice the sparkling resin. It is the Cosmic Tree (not Fantasy Tree) that pierces Mictlan. Tepeu suggests that we can talk to the Dinosaur King if we just go up the altar.

To be honest, I was once a priest of Chichen Itza.</p><p>Though I ran away from Chichen Itza before the appearance of the Dinosaur King, so I am not acquainted with the King, but I do have a work history\u2026and so-called connections.</p><p>Also, we never decided upon \u201Cterritory\u201D and \u201Cborders\u201D.</p><p>Anyone is able to go wherever they want. Just how the sun makes its round trip in the world.</p></blockquote><p><img src="https://i.redd.it/82eylgcn4y8a1.png" alt=""></p><p>The current priest is automatically angry at Tepeu as the group makes its way to the altar. The current deinos priest tells Tepeu to go back to wherever he dwelled and asks if he is here to boast about his disciples.</p><p><strong>Tepeu:</strong></p><blockquote><p>Not disciples, but more like teachers. I have learned a lot from them.</p><p>That being said, Priest Vucub. I am pleased to see you healthy.</p><p>I\u2019d like to request an audience with the Dinosaur King, would that be alright?</p></blockquote><p><img src="https://i.redd.it/1yutyeas4y8a1.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Priest Vucub:</strong></p><blockquote><p>That wouldn&#39;t be alright\u2026! The King is busy dealing with the Ocelotls.</p><p>With you being retired, you don\u2019t know this, but the Ocelotl are brutal creatures called humans!</p><p>The king demonstrated a do-or-die resistance and blocked the great plains in response to the deinos extinction crisis.</p><p>Chichen Itza is not a place for cowards like you! So hurry up and get out of here!</p></blockquote><p><strong>Tepeu:</strong></p><blockquote><p>Wait, my house should still be in Chichen Itza. I built it myself after all.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Priest Vucub:</strong></p><blockquote><p>That\u2019s not what we\u2019re talking about here! \u2014-Fighters! Fighters, come forth!</p></blockquote><p><img src="https://i.redd.it/ssh5y0sf6y8a1.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Priest Vucub:</strong></p><blockquote><p>Get these shameless deinos out of here!

Tepeu also forgot to congratulate him on getting to the position of Head Priest. Mashu states that we are going to have to find a different approach to this matter. You suggest to find information in order to find collaborators and meet up with the Dinosaur King that way.</p><p>Tepeu says that his house should be relatively safe since it is off the main street. He also wants to invite Nemo Marine and U-Olga Marie over as well and suggests that we all stick together on this.</p><p><img src="https://i.redd.it/n2v4a2ww4y8a1.png" alt="End of Chapter 4 Arrow 3"></p><p><img src="https://i.redd.it/qkheknkd8y8a1.png" alt=""></p><h1 id="arrow-4-3" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#arrow-4-3" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Arrow 4</h1><p><img src="https://i.redd.it/xinfetbm8y8a1.png" alt=""></p><p>Nemo Marine and U-Olga Marie congratulate you on your hard work so far. U-Olga Marie adds that she would also reject anyone with an audience if they didn\u2019t have an appointment.

Naturally deinos don\u2019t really clean up after themselves, but for Tepeu, it bothers him very much that he has to clean regularly. Therefore, he moved (into the cave in early chapters) to forget about the nuisance of cleaning a home.</p><p><img src="https://i.redd.it/jlfr9znz8y8a1.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Tepeu wants to know about the Chichen Itza of Pan-Human History.</strong> Mashu explains that it was a Mayan city located in South America on the Yucatan Peninsula. <strong>The city continued from 1600 BCE to 900 CE.</strong> Mashu states that before the time period 1600 BCE to 250 CE was considered the Preclassic Period. The Classic Period was from 250 to 900 CE. The Post-Classic Period was from 900 CE to 16th century. Chichen Itza was built by the people of Itza in the Post-Classic Period.</p><p><img src="https://i.redd.it/nmiwe9l19y8a1.png" alt=""></p><p>Itza people were considered \u201Coutsiders\u201D or descendants of those who escaped the fall of central Maya. They eventually reached a land with a fertile spring cenote and named it Chichen Itza (At the mouth of the well of the Itza). <strong>Kukulkan, the God of Wind and Water, was the name of the God they worshiped in Chichen Itza and the same god the Aztecs would eventually worship, Quetzalcoatl.</strong></p><p><img src="https://i.redd.it/akn20fl39y8a1.png" alt=""></p><p>Tepeu asks how they fell despite being in the blessings of their God. Mashu explains that when the Mayan civilization fell, the gods disappeared and Central America entered the Age of Man.</p><p>Something that\u2019s actually worth noting in this entire lecture. Mashu mentions the name <strong>Hernan Cortes</strong>. Cortes and his Spaniards fought the Aztec kingdom and emerged victorious. This caused the Aztec kingdom to be renamed into Mexico. Nemo Marine says that it is unbelievable that an army of 500 Spaniards eliminated several thousands in the Aztec Kingdom.</p><p><img src="https://i.redd.it/q1kltnb59y8a1.png" alt=""></p><p>Nemo Marine tells a story about <strong>how Hernan Cortes was thought to be the second coming of Quetzalcoatl by the Aztecs resulting in them treating Hernan Cortes as a guest from a foreign land.</strong></p><p><img src="https://i.redd.it/nd0camxa9y8a1.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Tepeu:</strong></p><blockquote><p>Indeed. Guns are the weapons that the Ocelotl are using, right?</p><p>They are conquerors who arrived from the <strong>outside world</strong>. Oppressing and murdering local tribes with guns.</p><p>This is the same situation with what\u2019s happened in Mictlan.</p><p>The Crypter, Daybit, is the reemergence of Hernan Cortes.</p></blockquote><p>Tepeu wants to know more about Tezcalipoca and Quezalcoatl, but it is getting late so they call it a day here.</p><p><img src="https://i.redd.it/ujt924ja9y8a1.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Rasputin:</strong></p><blockquote><p>But before that, I have one last question.</p><p>Mr. Tepeu. It\u2019s clear that Chichen Itza was not meant for the Deinos.</p><p>Either way, this lifestyle conforms to the humanity of Pan-Human History.</p><p>Who built this city? Who is the Deinos\u2019 \u201CDinosaur King\u201D?</p></blockquote><p><strong>Tepeu:</strong></p><blockquote><p>Well. The Dinosaur King appeared very recently and is unrelated to Chichen Itza.</p><p>Kukulkan is one who created Chichen Itza.</p><p>It is stated that the Sun God Kukulkan built this city to govern Mictlan.</p></blockquote><p><img src="https://i.redd.it/583d6ngc9y8a1.png" alt="Chapter 4 END"></p><h2 id="chapter-5-life-in-chichen-itza-i" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#chapter-5-life-in-chichen-itza-i" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Chapter 5 - Life in Chichen Itza (I)</h2><p><img src="https://i.redd.it/nuhx0b4nxn9a1.png" alt="Chapter 5: Life in Chichen Itza I"></p><h1 id="arrow-1-4" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#arrow-1-4" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Arrow 1</h1><p><img src="https://i.redd.it/tmpm8h0fyn9a1.png" alt="Chapter 5 Arrow 1"></p><p><img src="https://i.redd.it/rs4ew8ucyn9a1.png" alt=""></p><p>It is morning and you have slept well.

Nemo Marine comes running over, complimenting how nice it is to sleep so soundly in a safe city like Chichen Itza. Habetrot manifests and says that normally Heroic Spirits can go into spirit form and lie dormant for energy conservation, but Marine can\u2019t do that.</p><p><img src="https://i.redd.it/dz50oe8hyn9a1.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Nemo Marine:</strong></p><blockquote><p>Mhm.

Rasputin enlarges a picture of an arena-like picture. Nemo Marine and Tepeu tell you that this is where xoqqer is held and the only form of entertainment they have.</p><p>U-Olga Marie took the liberty to scan and survey the deinos\u2019 thoughts. Some of them are as follows, \u201CXoqqer begins after the next night\u201D, \u201CI\u2019m excited. I\u2019m excited. I wonder who\u2019ll go to the finals\u201D, and \u201CThe winner will be able to talk directly to the King.

Tepeu wanted to be a xoqqer player when he was young, but had to give up when he grew older.</p><p><strong>Fujimaru Ritsuka:</strong></p><blockquote><p>So it\u2019s basically soccerrrr!</p><p>So it\u2019s basically footballll!</p></blockquote><p><img src="https://i.redd.it/88l58c4bzn9a1.png" alt=""></p><p>Mashu reiterates the objective and adds that we have to get along with strong players so that we can join their team. Rasputin asks Tepeu how a xoqqer match is like and gives out a sample, 2 vs 2 or 4 vs 4. Tepeu answers that it is 11 vs 11. Rasputin tells them that they have a chance to join a pre-existing team if it\u2019s 11 vs 11.</p><p><img src="https://i.redd.it/6fnk4qvczn9a1.png" alt=""></p><p>Mashu requests Rasputin to apply the deinos disguise back on.

U-Olga Marie asks if we\u2019ll look like deinos to actual deinos and to us, we\u2019ll just look normal and Rasputin says that\u2019ll be the case.</p><p>U-Olga Marie suggests that we split up so that the more teams we\u2019re on, the better chance we\u2019ll have to see the Dinosaur King. Therefore, U-Olga Marie will be competing against you for the sake of the objective.</p><p><strong>Rasputin:</strong></p><blockquote><p>Then it\u2019ll be Fujimaru and Mashu, My Lady and I, and Mr. Tepeu and Marine.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Nemo Marine:</strong></p><blockquote><p>Okay!

One deinos is talking about how hot it\u2019s becoming nowadays and if every other species can hold up fine. The second deinos they\u2019re talking to have the opposite idea and focus on the quality of corn. A third deinos in the conversation wants to talk about xoqqer instead of Priest Vucub because his policies have led to the deaths of deinos lately.</p><p><img src="https://i.redd.it/so5rw9fhzn9a1.png" alt=""></p><p>The third deinos thanks the Crypter that xoqqer has become more enjoyable and the number of deinos deaths have decreased.</p><p>Mashu states that the town is getting busier by the minute and advises you to be careful to not get stepped on. Habetrot is surprised by the many kinds of deinos around here and seems to ask you about dinosaurs.</p><p><img src="https://i.redd.it/ii1he2kizn9a1.png" alt=""></p><p>Mashu instead gives you a brief lecture about dinosaurs, describing the many types of dinosaurs there are like the tyrannosaurus, triceratops, parasaurolophus, pteranodon, etc and also informing us of how they all became extinct. In the end, she\u2019s grateful that she met a dinosaur even if it was in a Lostbelt.</p><p>Habetrot just wants to know about the strongest, smartest and best dinosaur there is and the one who does not make an enemy out of. Mashu answers that it would be Deinonychus and goes on a bit describing their features, but unfortunately, there\u2019s not too many of them here.</p><p><strong>Mashu:</strong></p><blockquote><p>Actually, Tepeu-san has arranged for us to meet with some noble xoqqer team members.</p><p>They\u2019re training themselves for tomorrow\u2019s ceremony at the Ceremony Arena.</p><p>Anyone can freely go into the Ceremony Arena on the weekdays.

They let you into the group and don&#39;t really care about being formal so you can call them the 11 Deinonychus Brothers. However, there aren\u2019t 11 of them in total.</p><p>Habetrot materializes and the 11 Deinonychus Brothers are surprised by her (disguised form). They have never seen such a tochtli before. The brothers comment that it looks like a different species, but not an Ocelotl (jaguar) and more like a whimsy and free creature.</p><p><strong>Mashu:</strong></p><blockquote><p>We\u2019d like to participate in tomorrow\u2019s xoqqer as substitutes, would that be alright?</p></blockquote><p><img src="https://i.redd.it/96zl955qzn9a1.png" alt=""></p><p>They include you guys as one of the 11 and you\u2019ll be actual team players and not subs for them.

But it\u2019s clear that they win and play by being reliant on yellow cards.

Rasputin gives a lecture about the meaning of sacrifice in Aztec civilization. The notable and important points that Rasputin gives is that:</p><ol><li><strong>They had an interest in astronomy</strong> which stemmed from their ancestors being victims of a cosmic threat. This led to them taking in Central and South American memories that the world would be destroyed by a foreign cosmic object. In Aztec myth, the world was <strong>destroyed multiple times</strong>. Rasputin says <strong>four, but it\u2019s five</strong> with the \u201Cpresent time\u201D of Aztec mythology. <strong>This is the Aztec mythological version of the cycle of rebirth and extinction.</strong> People took Central America\u2019s memories of rebirth and extinction as a lesson and were influenced by them.</li><li>The Aztec civilization believed that the world would be <strong>destroyed every 52 years</strong>. Once the radiance of the sun disappeared, the world would be engulfed in darkness which would commence the destruction of the Aztec world. <strong>This is why priests offered up living sacrifices to maintain the sun\u2019s radiance.</strong></li><li>Tepeu asks why couldn\u2019t the people realize that the sun operates independently. Rasputin explains that this was the reality for the Aztecs. The worldview of the sun and destruction was difficult for anyone to live. <strong>Rasputin believed that the Aztec fell due to magecraft, as they rejected human sacrifices,</strong> considering the world the Aztecs lived in at the time.</li><li>Quetzalcoatl denied human sacrifice while Tezcatlipoca did. The Spaniards came and considered Tezcatlipoca for supporting such sacrifices after they witnessed the highest aloft waterside city.</li><li>Moctezuma II invited Hernan Cortes because he believed that Hernan Cortes was Quetzalcoatl. But it is odd that someone would invite a person who didn\u2019t like human sacrifice. The gods that were worshiped in Tenochtitlan were the Rain God, Tlaloc and the Tribal God, Huitzilopochtli. He considered that the Aztec would be destroyed by other tribes and wanted to stop human sacrifice. He considered Hernan Cortes to be the \u201Creemergence of Quetzalcoatl\u201D, a weapon he could use.</li><li>However, Hernan Cortes was oblivious to their culture until La Malinche taught him the language, culture and the Aztec Empire\u2019s weakness. In the end, the Aztec Empire and the other tribes were defeated by the Spanish Empire. Though in truth, it was La Malinche.</li></ol><p>Rasputin focuses on the main objective which is tomorrow\u2019s ceremony where they\u2019ll use Chaldea staff as offerings.</p><p><strong>Rasputin:</strong></p><blockquote><p>Prisoners are kept in an underground prison in Tlaloc\u2019s temple.</p></blockquote><p>Rasputin states that the plan to infiltrate the temple and break Chaldea out will be tomorrow during the ceremony. The plan is that as Ocelotl kneel and pray for the ritual\u2019s success, the group will go in and get them.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong></p><blockquote><p>Very well.

That Chaldea staff and the great artificial human.</p><p>Their hearts are rarer than the deinos. The revival of the true Tezcatlipoca. The final step.</p></blockquote><p>Tlaloc asks Izcalli if he knows about the deepest layer of Mictlan.</p><p><strong>Izcalli:</strong></p><blockquote><p>Yes. There rests a \u201Cweapon\u201D that can annihilate Pan-Human History.</p><p>A year ago, Tezcatlipoca ascended from the deepest layer to the fifth layer and bestowed weapons to us.</p><p>A year later, he went down to the deepest layer again to obtain another weapon to destroy Pan-Human History.</p><p>We will obey that will. We will exterminate the deinos, grasp the hegemony of Mictlan, and replace the foolish Pan-Human History with Mexico City taking over the \u201Cnext\u201D of humanity.</p></blockquote><p>Tlaloc tells him that he\u2019s right. However, Tlaloc orders him to make tomorrow perfect or else his life will be forfeit. Izcalli swears to meet those expectations and fulfill his duty perfectly. Tlaloc sternly asks him if he is being arrogant by underestimating Pan-Human History even after what happened at the Storm Border (Marie using her thunder to knock out Izcalli).</p><p><img src="https://i.redd.it/n4yywuslrpca1.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Izcalli:</strong></p><blockquote><p>\u2014I am belittling them. That does not mean I am dismissing them.</p><p>They are novices who break down after the death of their fellow brethren. As a warrior, I cannot comprehend their emotions.</p><p>They are intent on killing us as hostiles, yet aren\u2019t prepared for even the death of their brethren\u2014</p><p>I have never felt such detest. The humans of Pan-Human History are unsightly.</p><p>For me to be raised by Tezcatlipoca, their civilization is not worth acknowledging.</p></blockquote><p><img src="https://i.redd.it/u1i7q8sqrpca1.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Tlaloc:</strong></p><blockquote><p>\u2026Right. You don\u2019t acknowledge them, but you continue to hate them, it seems.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Izcalli:</strong></p><blockquote><p>Tlaloc?</p></blockquote><p><strong>Tlaloc:</strong></p><blockquote><p>I am talking to myself. If you heard it, then think about what it means.</p></blockquote><p>Tlaloc starts walking away, Izcalli holds her up thinking that she still has headaches after Tezcatlipoca\u2019s shot, but Tlaloc walks away saying that she\u2019s fine.</p><p><img src="https://i.redd.it/gaw1s9ksrpca1.png" alt=""></p><p>Meanwhile, Kadoc and Sion are in a cell together. Sion explains that there is no possible way to communicate with anyone.</p><p><img src="https://i.redd.it/2u1rbseurpca1.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Sion:</strong></p><blockquote><p>It\u2019s as if we\u2019re in a different world\u2026like being inside an animal\u2026</p><p>Or being in a spaceship that cuts off communication\u2026</p></blockquote><p>Kadoc says that he\u2019s conserving his energy for <strong>when</strong> we come in and save them. Kadoc hears someone coming down and assumes that we\u2019re there, but it\u2019s Daybit. Kadoc tells Daybit that he didn\u2019t think that Daybit would arm Lostbelt natives with weapons and cultivate an army.</p><p><img src="https://i.redd.it/r0ssvihwrpca1.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Daybit:</strong></p><blockquote><p>The one who inspected your guys\u2019 ship was my Servant who acted alone.</p><p>I was doing something else. I just returned to Mexico City.</p><p>Though, I would have done the same thing. The only difference being that I would\u2019ve disposed of you all than take captives.</p></blockquote><p>Sion introduces herself to Daybit, but Daybit knows about her being in the Wandering Sea and supplying Chaldea with the Anti-Foreign God weapon.</p><p><img src="https://i.redd.it/99t9mc8lspca1.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Daybit:</strong></p><blockquote><p>I\u2019ve remembered your name and face.

I can guarantee that.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Sion:</strong></p><blockquote><p>Ah, alright.</p><p>(Woah, was that a death threat, Mr. Kadoc?)</p></blockquote><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong></p><blockquote><p>(If it sounds like a proposal to you, then you\u2019re a fool. \u2014More importantly)</p><p>You say next time, so you aren\u2019t to kill us now, huh.

I had nothing to do with the snatching since I wasn\u2019t there.</p><p>\u2014Well, you could say that he took the initiative.</p><p>He\u2019s the type to go out and never say anything about it.</p><p>He\u2019ll suddenly return and nonchalantly say \u201Cah, my bad, but I completely used up your bank account\u201D.</p></blockquote><p><img src="https://i.redd.it/qgco6mmespca1.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Sion:</strong></p><blockquote><p>(Is this DV (domestic violence)?)</p></blockquote><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong></p><blockquote><p>Ha. So you aren\u2019t on good terms with your Servant. Then you aren\u2019t going to kill us because of your Servant\u2026</p><p>You\u2019re frightened of Tezcatlipoca, aren\u2019t you?</p></blockquote><p><img src="https://i.redd.it/7k9p2gagspca1.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Daybit:</strong></p><blockquote><p>Yea. He\u2019s a major Servant. He dominated extraterrestrial life on Mictlan and established Pan-Human History rules in one year.</p><p>In reality, Mexico City is his city.</p><p>He summoned temples, cultivated the Ocelotl, constructed this city, and chose the city\u2019s king.</p><p>All I am is Tezcatlipoca\u2019s summoner.</p><p>If Chaldea intends on fighting this Lostbelt, then the one who\u2019ll destroy you will not be me, but Tezcatlipoca.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Sion:</strong></p><blockquote><p>Then, you have no interest in this Lostbelt, right, Mr. Daybit? Are you fine with Chaldea removing this Lostbelt?</p></blockquote><p><img src="https://i.redd.it/bxtkbsaispca1.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Daybit:</strong></p><blockquote><p>So you want to remove it. I won\u2019t interfere if you do it in 10 days.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Sion:</strong></p><blockquote><p>I see, I see. Then if Chaldea can sever the Fantasy Tree, then doesn\u2019t that mean your objectives will restart at square one?</p></blockquote><p><strong>Daybit:</strong></p><blockquote><p>That is, if you can do it. As an individual, I don\u2019t care either way\u2014</p><p>Since Wodime carried through till the very end, I will also fulfill my Order.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong></p><blockquote><p>\u2026Don\u2019t be absurd.

It\u2019s about the will.</p><p>He didn\u2019t move on his calculation that \u201Cmy plan will absolutely succeed\u201D.</p><p>What kept his body which was on the verge of death moving was his will.</p><p>He kept going till the very end. Even if he was annoyed, he had no regrets.</p><p>You could say he followed through. Yet the ideals he sought out for didn\u2019t materialize.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong></p><blockquote><p>\u2026Well. \u2026I guess you\u2019re right.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Daybit:</strong></p><blockquote><p>Let\u2019s stop there. Let\u2019s focus on something else. I don\u2019t have time today.</p><p>I have a question, Kadoc. Why won\u2019t you bring your Servant along?</p><p>You\u2019re a Master. Use your Servant, you should be able to break out of this prison with ease.</p></blockquote><p><img src="https://i.redd.it/qkjj0w5sspca1.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong></p><blockquote><p>Well I obviously don\u2019t have one. I\u2019m no longer a Crypter and changed sides.</p><p>I don\u2019t have authorization from Chaldea to summon a Servant, and I don\u2019t wish for one either.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Daybit:</strong></p><blockquote><p>That\u2019s not what I\u2019m talking about. Why won\u2019t you use what\u2019s there.</p></blockquote><p><img src="https://i.redd.it/qfc1mv0uspca1.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong></p><blockquote><p>Huh?</p></blockquote><p><img src="https://i.redd.it/klnudt6wspca1.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Daybit:</strong></p><blockquote><p>\u2026Good grief. You\u2019re a lucky guy. I can see why Peperoncino never let you go.</p><p>You still have your Sirius Light.</p><p>It\u2019s a spell that generates mana that\u2019s ten times larger than a Command Seal. A detonator that instantly amplifies the caster\u2019s mana circuits.</p><p>A Crypter using the Greater Command Seal would die. To simply put it, they implode.</p><p>The Greater Command Seal is a bomb. In the case that the Crypter failed their Rayshift, Marisbury prepared an insurance plan so that we can accomplish an Order <strong>by destroying the entire territory.</strong></p><p>Ophelia was lucky that was on the brink of death. She was a caster who\u2019s already dead before their Greater Command Seal could be activated.</p><p>If Ophelia utilized her Greater Command Seal before receiving a fatal wound, then she would\u2019ve eliminated the Shadow Border and all Chaldea survivors.</p></blockquote><p>Kadoc explains that he vaguely thought that was the case and the Beryl was there because he\u2019d make sure their Greater Command Seal was used if any Crypter tried to escape from the Singularity. That\u2019s why there were seven Crypters, one for each Singularity. He knew that Marisbury didn\u2019t believe that the Crypter could fulfill the Human Order Restoration.</p><p>Kadoc states that what Daybit is saying is that Kadoc should use his Sirius Light to blow both him and Daybit up. Daybit says that he doesn\u2019t care, but notes that Nemo and Da Vinci are in a separate jail.</p><p><img src="https://i.redd.it/lu4cp2h1tpca1.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Daybit:</strong></p><blockquote><p>The Greater Command Seal is a bomb, and also a Master\u2019s wildcard.</p><p>The Greater Command Seal gives you a chance to give an abnormal order to your Servant.</p><p>I told you what happened with Ophelia. <strong>But if you suicide before you use it, then you won\u2019t implode.</strong></p><p>In short, you either die, or achieve something before you die. It\u2019s up to you what you want to do, Kadoc.</p></blockquote><p>Daybit leaves.</p><p><img src="https://i.redd.it/w6n2i443tpca1.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong></p><blockquote><p>\u2026Is that all!? Why did you come here then!?</p></blockquote><p><strong>Daybit:</strong></p><blockquote><p>I told you already. To confirm enemy capabilities. It\u2019s the least <strong>I can do</strong> since I can\u2019t kill you all here and now.</p></blockquote><p>Sion is surprised by what she heard. She couldn\u2019t understand what they were talking about even though it was right in front of her. She compares Daybit to an open void in the world. Kadoc sympathizes with her, but he states that Daybit is a caring, social and smart person. Daybit only says something if it\u2019s necessary.</p><p>Kadoc:</p><blockquote><p>(...Like I said. There\u2019s meaning in the information he told me about the Greater Command Seal. He\u2019s telling me to think\u2014about what to do with it and where to use it)</p></blockquote><p>Kadoc asks her to keep what just happened a secret. She agrees to keep the entire thing a secret which makes Kadoc relieved.</p><p><img src="https://i.redd.it/x912ium4tpca1.png" alt="End of Chapter 9 Arrow 3"></p><h1 id="arrow-4-8" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#arrow-4-8" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Arrow 4</h1><p><img src="https://i.redd.it/34p24bwstpca1.png" alt="Chapter 9 Arrow 4"></p><p><img src="https://i.redd.it/4o3bmv0wtpca1.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Fujimaru Ritsuka:</strong></p><blockquote><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.</p><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.</p><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.</p></blockquote><p><img src="https://i.redd.it/sv6q48d5wpca1.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>U-Olga Marie:</strong></p><blockquote><p>HOW FOOLISH OF YOU TO NOT BE ABLE TO SLEEP, FUJIMARU!</p><p>Are you worried about tomorrow\u2019s rescue operation!</p></blockquote><p><strong>Fujimaru Rituska:</strong></p><blockquote><p>O-of course not!</p><p>Be quiet, you\u2019re going to wake the others up!</p></blockquote><p><strong>U-Olga Marie:</strong></p><blockquote><p>Alright.
