Together with his comrades, he made an escape from the gladiator training grounds and organized a rebel army.</p><p>Before long, many other gladiators and slaves gather beneath him, as they became a large army.</p><p>It marked the beginning of the Third Servile War.</p><p>The rebel army swelling in ranks, commanded by Spartacus, had managed to secure consecutives victories, but before long Rome also organized its own large army.</p><p>The rebel army, which had scarce battle experience on top of having children and elderly within it, was unable to oppose them, and was annihilated.*</p><p>Spartacus\u2019 remains had not been found; one theory states that it had been mangled by the fierceness of the battle.</p><p>\u2026...Spartacus\u2019 battle had almost always been against the strong. They were overwhelmed by the soldiers of Rome known for their strength even in number.</p><p>Within the pressure of facing such powerful enemies, of the request for aid from his subordinates, of the death of everyone who had gathered here should he misled them.</p><p>Spartacus had laughed as he continued fighting.</p><p>He is not fond of fighting, nor is he fond of victory.</p><p>It is simply that his forte is in finding a motive to not lose.</p><p>Consequently, he understands-----that in this world, there are battles in which one simply must not lose.</p><p>He does not hate pain. He does not detest despair. To begin with, those are things that exist within this world to shackle us.</p><p>Future, hope, wish. They are all but a temporary consolation for the mind. One cannot survive if one does not continue fighting.</p><p>Fight, his muscles call out. Howl, his diaphragm trembles. Even if your sword you tightly hold breaks, even if your knees are broken, fight, fight, fight!</p><p>If it is for the sake of his conviction, he would even without hesitation kill his Master. Due to that, he is known as one of the worst Servant one could ever summon.</p><p>But likewise, if the Master that he ought to rebel against is simply someone who learn from being weak and challenges other Servant as the weak, the Spartacus would gladly fight for their sake.</p><p>That being said, his trait of \u201Cchoosing the most difficult of paths as his course of action\u201D means he would still be a trouble-----</p><div class="custom-container tip"><p class="custom-container-title">TIP</p><ul><li>actually IRL legend, the third servile war was p much the only slave rebellion that was able to fought the romans army almost on even footing and actually served as a threat to the capital</li></ul></div><h2 id="related-characters" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#related-characters" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Related Characters</h2><p><strong>Every king-type Servants</strong></p><p>OOOH, OPPRESORS!</p><h2 id="comment-from-the-illustrator" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#comment-from-the-illustrator" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Comment from the Illustrator</h2><p>It\u2019s kinda hard to modify such a cheerful character for the ascension, but do all of you realize his rotund eyes peeking from the dark hole on the mask on his last ascension?
