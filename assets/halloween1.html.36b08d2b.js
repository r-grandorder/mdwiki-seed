I know you just woke up, but an invitation has arrived for you.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Here you go. The envelope is traditional looking,<br> and extremely formal.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> There&#39;s no return address on it but clearly this is Senpai&#39;s name on the envelope.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> From the heading, it appears to be an invitation to a Halloween party.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Halloween! Is it already that time?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes. It is, indeed, that russet-colored season now.<br> In Japan, it&#39;s the time for viewing autumn foliage.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> What&#39;s Halloween?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> You&#39;re not familiar with it?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It was originally a year&#39;s end celebration in Celtic culture,<br> but it changed over time to become All Hallow&#39;s Eve...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It&#39;s now a celebration put on the night before people offer up prayers to saints.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Though, I haven&#39;t actually experienced a Halloween celebration...</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The bigger problem is the invitation itself, Senpai.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I happened to overhear your conversation.<br> A Halloween celebration, you say?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Sounds fun! I love festive events like that! Back when the Director was with us, she would never approve such things...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...That&#39;s [\u2642 kinda /\u2640 a little] inappropriate, Doctor.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Oh... I guess it was. Sorry, that was my bad.<br> I&#39;ll be more careful from now on.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The Doctor didn&#39;t mean any harm, Senpai.<br> Words just never go through his brain, as usual.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I feel absolutely ashamed... The greatest flaw of a science otaku is the utter lack of delicacy.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I really need to spend more time paying my respects to the late Director. This time I will put more time and emotion into it...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> The Director is still alive.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Huh?! She&#39;s alive?!<br> Ah, I see. You mean she lives in our heart.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> After all, I feel the same way.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I never fail to clean the Director&#39;s Office, and I make daily offerings with her favorite dried fruit.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> You know what, I think that tonight, I&#39;ll put up some pumpkin decorations in the Director&#39;s Office.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Although, Olga Marie never admits when she likes something. She&#39;ll probably say something like,<br> \u201CWhat are these useless things?!\u201D</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...Okay, I need to stop. It&#39;s a celebration, and here I am dampening the mood with my talk.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Ahem! All right, let&#39;s turn this mood around\u2014</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> But really, Fujimaru!<br> You&#39;re a smooth one, scoring an invitation like that!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Who could it be from?<br> I certainly don&#39;t recall sending you that.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I didn&#39;t send it either, Doctor.<br> But if neither you nor I sent it, that means...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Undoubtedly, this is some kind of mischief. After all, letters from the outside world can&#39;t be delivered here.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> In any case, Senpai, let&#39;s read the invitation.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Please rest assured that it is free of razor blades or any other dangerous items.</p><p><strong>Letter:</strong><br> Dear Fujimaru, I am writing to inform you of a splendid Halloween party that is to take place.</p><p><strong>Letter:</strong><br> My little Castle Csejte is now completely remodeled!</p><p><strong>Letter:</strong><br> You&#39;ll be swallowed up in classic and dragonic decor\u2606</p><p><strong>Letter:</strong><br> I hereby humbly invite you to a dream-like night of elegance and wonder.</p><p><strong>Letter:</strong><br> At the party, you will find splendid pumpkin cuisine from the four corners of the world,</p><p><strong>Letter:</strong><br> as well as a splendid serenade from an adorable idol,<br> a sweet serenade from a young girl that will set your heart on fire,</p><p><strong>Letter:</strong><br> and a serenade that&#39;s sung by an unparalleled diva.<br> It all awaits you.</p><p><strong>Letter:</strong><br> Indeed, it shall be a grand ball that could set any soul alight. It will surely sink its teeth into your heart and savor it as well.</p><p><strong>Letter:</strong><br> Both your mind and body will have a deluxing experience! Won&#39;t you come and bask in the spectacular sensation of being mired in a nightmare?</p><p><strong>Letter:</strong><br> The theme is, \u201CSweet Blood M\xE4rchen Torture.\u201D<br> I eagerly await your attendance.</p><p><strong>Letter:</strong><br> \u2014Be sure to come, okay?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> That is horrible!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The fact that she emphasizes singing three times seems unbearably sinister to me.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Senpai, what shall we do?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> This \u201Cdeluxing\u201D is supposed to be \u201Crelaxing,\u201D isn&#39;t it?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> You&#39;re right. I wonder if she wrote it out of excitement or if she didn&#39;t know what she was saying.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> So this \u201Ctorture\u201D bit is...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> She really means \u201Ctorture.\u201D To translate it accurately, it would be \u201CSweet, blood-covered, fairy tale-like, and torturous.\u201D</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> There&#39;s no signature on the invitation, but... Based on the content of the note, I have a good idea who sent it.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> A Servant who loves to sing... Loves to daydream...<br> And also enjoys blood and torture. It could only be...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Elisabeth...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> B\xE1tho...</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> No, you must not utter another syllable. To speak her name is to summon her, Fujimaru!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Just as speaking the truth isn&#39;t always the best idea,<br> spotting a disaster before it happens doesn&#39;t necessarily mean you can prevent it.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> So\u2014precisely what are you trying to say, Doctor?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Well... If you can&#39;t avoid a dangerous situation,<br> it&#39;s easier to charge in without a second thought!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> That philosophy has gotten me through most problems or troubles that I&#39;ve encountered.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou, fooooooou!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Let&#39;s just ignore Doctor&#39;s advice.<br> He doesn&#39;t understand human emotion whatsoever...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Senpai.<br> Are you planning to respond to the invitation?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I&#39;ve...never experienced an event of this kind, so I am interested, I suppose...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Oh, the residual Spiritron information on this letter indicates its point of origin.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> You could go anytime you want...<br> So what will you do, Fujimaru?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Mash, let&#39;s go to the party together!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Of course! I look forward to your guidance and support!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> As a matter of fact, I happen to love pumpkins.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Oh dear, you&#39;re not very honest, are you? But, if you love pumpkins so much, I suppose you&#39;d better go.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> She seems to have gathered some good materials.<br> I&#39;ll join you as well.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Then let&#39;s head out to the theme park of our dreams - a Halloween party!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Um.<br> We should bring lunch with us, shouldn&#39;t we?</p><h2 id="section-1-haunted-forest" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1-haunted-forest" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 1: Haunted Forest</h2><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> We&#39;ve arrived. The time period is unknown but the location appears to be somewhere in Europe.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That said... It feels both a bit frightening and yet fun, somehow. How odd.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> There are jack-o&#39;-lanterns hanging all over the place,<br> and all the skeletons are dancing about.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou, fooou! Fa!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> It&#39;s a much grander setup than I imagined...<br> Perhaps I underestimated her...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes... Since this is Miss Ba...ry we&#39;re talking about,<br> I thought she&#39;d be more of a paper decorations kind of girl...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Seems like we might need to pay extra attention here.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I&#39;m picking up some weak hostile signatures here and there. There&#39;s no telling what could happen here.<br> Be on your guard as you investigate.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Right, this was totally unexpected, so it&#39;s sure to be more than we bargained for!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Now, let&#39;s go, Master!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> All that glitters isn&#39;t gold, but when in Rome, do as the Romans do, they say!</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Leave it there... Leave it there...<br> Leave some AP or stones and stuff there...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Hmmph! So a ghost-type is the first up,<br> I see... How typical.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It&#39;s far from surprising, but well, I suppose it is what it is.<br> It&#39;s the most basic of basics in a haunted house scenario.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> On second thought, this could be fun.<br> Senpai, quickly now! It&#39;s time for some ghost-busting!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I&#39;m not picking up any more enemies nearby.<br> Those must&#39;ve just been some strays.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I suppose that&#39;s the quality of enemies you get right at the entrance. We need to find the real deal as soon as possible\u2014</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Um, shouldn&#39;t we head toward that totally suspicious-looking castle over there, Master?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> That castle... An evil castle of blood... Ugh, my head!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fooou...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I understand how you feel.<br> Do you need a tranquilizer?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> You&#39;re in high spirits, aren&#39;t you, Mash?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes, absolutely! Uh, I mean...<br> Of course I am, since this is our work and all.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I wasn&#39;t hoping it would be like going to a real theme park or anything, um, definitely not!</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Huh? ...Hmmm...<br> That&#39;s odd. Maybe this gauge is broken...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Doctor? In your professional opinion, did you notice something odd about that ghost just now?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Eh, not really.<br> It was probably my imagination. Just forget it.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> (A nearby tremor in the Singularity... Really. It couldn&#39;t be. Hmmm, I&#39;ll just pretend I didn&#39;t see anything.)</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> You kids just go on enjoying yourselves.

I didn&#39;t...</p><p><strong>Carmilla:</strong><br> There was a banquet! You guys just couldn&#39;t see it!<br> I cooked the tomatoes!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I see...

You may not believe it, but it&#39;s true.<br> Its power is what forced me to do this.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> Oh my... That must be terrible.<br> But\u2014How fascinating.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> If the Grail grants a Servant&#39;s wish, then...<br> Hehehe...

So both Mata Hari and Carmilla have fallen.<br> Are the little [\u2642 Puppies /\u2640 Deerlets] suffering?</p><p><strong>F\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Of course. Life itself is suffering.<br> Most people are always suffering.</p><p><strong>F\uFF1A???:</strong><br> But at the same time, most suffering can be alleviated with the softness of a paw, or perhaps a tail.</p><p><strong>F\uFF1A???:</strong><br> In other words, they don&#39;t suffer that much at all.<br> By the way, do we have enough carrot cake?</p><p><strong>E\uFF1A???:</strong><br> \u2013I see. Then make them suffer more.<br> More cruelty! More despair!</p><p><strong>E\uFF1A???:</strong><br> That&#39;s the most important part of this Halloween party!</p><p><strong>F\uFF1A???:</strong><br> First I&#39;ve heard of it, but sure thing!<br> Kitty&#39;s ready for the banquet!</p><p><strong>E\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Now come, little [\u2642 Puppies /\u2640 Deerlets]!<br> Come to me!</p><p><strong>E\uFF1A???:</strong><br> I&#39;ll give you a welcome to make you wish you were never born!</p><h2 id="section-5-secret-joy-of-the-impaler" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-5-secret-joy-of-the-impaler" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 5: Secret Joy of the Impaler</h2><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> \u2013Hmm, so you made it this far, huh?</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Carmilla went easy on you...<br> Or perhaps not.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Very well then. I grant you the honor of fighting with Vlad Tepes, the Dracul.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> Oh my. We actually ran into a serious warrior for once.<br> Class-wise, he&#39;s the same as me, though.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> Of course, no Berserker can rival me in elegance and breeding.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> You make me laugh, man-eater.<br> Your sin will scorch you from within.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Both you and I have trod a wicked path.<br> Know that neither of us shall return to the light.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> ...That kind of ticked me off.<br> You will pay dearly for that.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Of course. This is a banquet, a place for entertainment!<br> And so\u2014</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Even the jesters must give it their all.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> As the ruler of a nation, I know the importance of festivals.

He&#39;s the one person who doesn&#39;t get the mood for this event!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> In a sense, he&#39;s a true Berserker...<br> The only sane man in a world of the insane.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> \u2014I find that a touch rude.<br> I consider myself a gentleman with a sense of humor.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Mata Hari&#39;s dance was one of mirth.<br> Carmilla&#39;s dance was one of suffering.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> I would like to add a dance of my own, a dance of blood...</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> But I must beg your forgiveness.<br> I&#39;m afraid I&#39;m much better at embroidery.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Embroidery?<br> Your hobby is embroidery?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Did you make that splendid regalia yourself?</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Hahaha! How kind of you, milady.<br> But no, this was the work of a special tailor.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> I wanted to try my hand at it myself, but I had my position to think of.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Young girl, if you like, I shall give you a lesson later.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> An applique of a praying man would decorate your master&#39;s clothes well.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Vlad!</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> But first, we must attend to the battle.<br> I&#39;ve been asked to \u201Chype up this party,\u201D you see.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> And the best way to liven up this banquet, I believe\u2013<br> Is with your screams.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Let us begin with an appetizer.<br> Eat, as your bones scream in pain!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Indeed, banquets are splendid.<br> It was worth going along with that girl.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> ...So it&#39;s \u201Cthat girl\u201D after all?</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Of course. Out of all Servants, there are few who could spread such sweet delusions without shame.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> No, I think there are probably a lot...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Well, I&#39;m sure there&#39;s plenty...</p><hr><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> Oh my...

She simply seeks her own entertainment.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> ...But that&#39;s why it is fine.<br> Her entertainment is a pure joy, unlike ours.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> I know of it myself. Before I became the dragon who defended my nation, I, too, was once a father.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Now, it&#39;s time for me to fight for real.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> My stakes have found their place in history.<br> And now you shall feel their wrath!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> ...Hmmph.

Let it all out.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> U-Um, Elisabeth?</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Hmm? What is it?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> You could have just come to Chaldea, you know...</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> What? Of course not.<br> That&#39;s no fun.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Listen. An idol&#39;s concert is a once-in-a-lifetime deal.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> You brave the winter snow and summer heat,<br> lining up for your tickets.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> You line up just to buy merchandise, you get packed into a crowded concert hall.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> As the diva&#39;s serenade brings you to the heights of ecstasy and madness, you fall in love!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Yes, quite right. You&#39;re quite right, Elisabeth.<br> The job of an idol in the first place is to...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Doctor, if you don&#39;t want me confiscating your laptop,<br> please shut up.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Yes, I&#39;ll shut up.<br> Lady Elisabeth, please continue!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Oh, may I?<br> Umm, then\u2014Ahem.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> So, you see? It&#39;s important for an idol to keep their fans waiting. So...</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> If I just showed up in my little [\u2642 Puppy /\u2640 Deerlet]&#39;s room and started singing, I&#39;d be a heartless demon, right?</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> My songs only truly shine after a long and perilous journey.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> I couldn&#39;t deprive you of such a woooonnnderful feast for the ears!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> So you didn&#39;t send the invitation to Csejte so that we could enjoy a Halloween party...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...but so that Master could listen to your songs?</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Correct. It was a cruel trial, to make my songs all the more wonderful. Splendid, yes?</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> Oh. My. That. Is. Amazing.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> Our reward. For four Servant battles.<br> Is one of your songs.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> EXACTLY!<br> (Dazzling smile)</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> My head. Has overheated. With rage.<br> And something else.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> K-Kiyohime! Get a hold of yourself!</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> M-My husband... Kiyohime is done for...<br> Something within me that must never snap has snapped.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Hang in there!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> You can do it!</p><hr><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> Sob... I&#39;m telling the truth, and you&#39;re so cold to me...<br> But I know that&#39;s what a Master is, now...</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> That aside\u2013You! Count Dracu-dumb!</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> At this point, what&#39;s the difference between defeating four Servants and beating the stuffing out of five?</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> I&#39;ll incinerate the lot of you!<br> No dust left! No ash left!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Huh? Huh? Why are you mad at me?<br> Argh! Don&#39;t burn down the stage!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> That&#39;s more of a death-y metal-y thing!</p><p><strong>Tamamo Cat:</strong><br> Oh, you wanna fight?<br> Okay, then.</p><p><strong>Tamamo Cat:</strong><br> I summon the pumpkin heads I called to liven the place up! Now the whole concert hall&#39;s full!</p><p><strong>Tamamo Cat:</strong><br> Now, my (true) Master and my (temporary) Master!<br> I&#39;m exhausted, but it&#39;s time for the concert!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> Hehehe.<br> I&#39;m in top condition tonight!</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> I feel like I could ignite flames of love just by meeting someone&#39;s gaze!</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> My husband!<br> Look deep into my eyes, please!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Splendid! Wonderful! This wasn&#39;t what I anticipated,<br> but it was a lot of fun anyway!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> I&#39;m really getting into this!<br> I feel like my songs\u2013can save the world!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> It&#39;s time for the finale! I am Caster Elisabeth!<br> \u2013Listen to my true song!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Aah... That&#39;s enough singing.<br> I&#39;m so satisfied...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Holy Grail confirmed! Recovering!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> That felt so good!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Songs truly are the noblest art, and idols are Phantasms created by the stars!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> My throat&#39;s parched, but worse, my ears hurt...</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> It&#39;s not even remotely fair that Count Dracu-dumb is in better shape than us.</p><p><strong>Tamamo Cat:</strong><br> A poisonous snake can bite their own tail and still survive, after all.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Master, this wasn&#39;t quite what I expected, but we did manage to recover a fragment of the Grail.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> If we take this back to Chaldea, we&#39;ll gain a valuable source of magical energy.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> So all that&#39;s left to do is go home.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Or, wait. This is your room,<br> so perhaps we don&#39;t even need to do that?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> My head feels so dizzy I can&#39;t think...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> \u2014</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong></p><hr><p><strong>Tamamo Cat:</strong><br> Hey, question for you guys.</p><p><strong>Tamamo Cat:</strong><br> My (temporary) Master looks like they&#39;ve got a bad case of the shakes. They okay?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Huh?<br> Oh! M-Master!?</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> Ahhhhhhhhhhhhh!<br> My husband! Hang in there, my husband!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> The heat from the concert got to them...<br> I understand that. Perhaps it was too good.</p><p><strong>Tamamo Cat:</strong><br> No, that doesn&#39;t seem right.<br> But I decided not to say so.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> Are you okay, my husband?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Maybe I&#39;m okay?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I&#39;m okay, maybe?</p><hr><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> Oh, the question mark means you&#39;re not lying, right?<br> We still have to be careful.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> Please stay still, and rest your head, heart, and ears.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> My ears...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I think something happened...</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It&#39;s because you experienced Elisabeth&#39;s concert up close... Probably.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Just think of it like trying out a torture device...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> That&#39;s crazy!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Good idea.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yeah.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Well, my little [\u2642 Puppy /\u2640 Deerlet]?<br> My concert was wonderful, wasn&#39;t it?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I&#39;ve had my fill.</p><hr><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Yes, yes, you&#39;re right.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> You&#39;re never going to have a private concert like this again! Probably.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> It was a once-in-a-lifetime experience!<br> Of course you&#39;ve had your fill!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Um... I think that meant,<br> \u201CPlease, make it stop. I&#39;m begging you.\u201D</p><p><strong>Tamamo Cat:</strong><br> Ssh!
