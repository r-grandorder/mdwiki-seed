Even with the buzzing tree leaves and the chirping sound of birds,</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> for some reason, I think of only serenity.<br> Is it because there&#39;re no humans here?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> It&#39;s pretty relaxing, huh?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> This is nice, isn&#39;t it?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes, Senpai.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Forests are nice. Well, that&#39;s because animals and plants are singing the praises of life here.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Despite the bustle of people and other things, forests can stand up as forests solely by themselves.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> It&#39;s not the domain of people, in the first place. Though almost the entire earth is dominated by humans now.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Animals, plants, fairies, gods. Compared to those in the forest, humans are just &quot;extras.&quot;</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> So, an uninvited guest.<br> Is that who we are\u2013</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Umm?<br> No, it&#39;s not that stiff...</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> ...But how awful. The forest around here feels off.<br> I came here to take a look and the air is just too rough.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I didn&#39;t pick up anything here...<br> Is there really a distortion here, C\xFA Chulainn?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> The Second Singularity, the 1st Century you guys fixed<br> \u2013This is northeastern Ireland in that time period.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Sure, from the measurement there seems to be a delay in this era&#39;s correction. But is it a distortion?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Looking at the numbers, it just seems to be a quiet forest...</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> I don&#39;t know about your situation but you shouldn&#39;t take forests lightly.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Forests have been around since before mankind.<br> They may even have been around from the Age of the Gods even before that.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Manipulating humans is exactly what it does best.<br> Just look at that.</p><p><strong>Werewolf:</strong><br> GUUUUUUU...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> A beast man monster!?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> What? I-I didn&#39;t pick up anything here! Oh, but it looks like there&#39;s a slight trace of magical energy reaction...</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> I&#39;d bet it&#39;s part of this forest.<br> Anyway, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s here to welcome us.</p><p><strong>Werewolf:</strong><br> GUUUUUUU!!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It&#39;s coming, Senpai!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Prepare for battle!!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Understood, Master!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Cleaned up for the most part? You could say it was done as planned but rough, you know?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...C\xFA Chulainn. Do you have any idea about the distortion that&#39;s left in the 1st Century?</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Yeah, I do.<br> I&#39;m C\xFA Chulainn, an Ulster hero, you know.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> I&#39;m not used to this calendar style called century, but, this is &quot;my era.&quot;</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> True, come to speak of it.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Oh, really!?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes, Senpai.<br> This is the era in which he was alive\u2013</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The specific period of Celt and Ulster legends are presumed to be from 100 B.C. to 100 A.D.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Precisely. That said, the me that was alive already &quot;died&quot; decades ago by now.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> For some reason, I feel attached to this era.<br> I don&#39;t know why, I can just feel something.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Maybe that&#39;s also because I manifested as a Caster, oddly, I am more keen at picking up magical energy.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I see. That&#39;s why you were able to sense the distortion happening here in your hometown.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> My hometown, you say.<br> Still, I think it&#39;s because I&#39;m a Caster.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> \u2013It&#39;s the forest.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ??</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> I&#39;m a Celtic, a man of Ulster.<br> If I&#39;m a mage then that can only mean I became &quot;that.&quot;</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> A &quot;Druid&quot;.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> The runes I use are originated from Norse legends, but Celtic mages are normally Druids.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Druids?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> So Celtic shamans.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes, Senpai.<br> The Celtic priests are referred to as Druids.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> They are people who have a deep relationship with the forest and monument, and can perform mystics same as the magecrafts we know.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Of course, they existed in my times, too.<br> However, I am not actually a Druid.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Like I said before, the type of magecraft I use is runes.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> I combine the rune characters here and there and to perform the mystics.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> However, there&#39;s an exception.<br> When I manifested in this form\u2013</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> I obtained it as a &quot;Noble Phantasm.&quot;<br> It was given to me since I was a Celtic mage.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Wicker Man, the Cage of All-Consuming Flame.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Right. A Flame Noble Phantasm given to me after becoming a Celtic mage who could manipulate blazing heat.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Originally, it&#39;s a Noble Phantasm for Druids, since it was a magical tool used in sacrificial offerings.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> That&#39;s what summoned me here, telling me to stop the distortion.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Hmm?<br> You mean the distortion of this forest was\u2013</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> ...The forest won&#39;t die...</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> ...All forests, without men...</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> ...So, so they shall not be incinerated...</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> ...The forest shall be preserved...</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> ...Even if mankind ends up perishing...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> !?</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Bingo! That&#39;s the one distorting this forest and preventing the correction of this era.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> That thing is a &quot;Druid.&quot;<br> But also more than that.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Fearing the incineration of worlds, a cluster of madness.<br> A collection of dead souls who couldn&#39;t ascend to the Throne of Heroes.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> You actually thought you could kill me using a beast man?</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Hey, you guys!!<br> I&#39;m talking to you!!</p><p><strong>Druid Ghost:</strong><br> ...The forest won&#39;t die...</p><p><strong>Druid Ghost:</strong><br> ...All forests will continue to be without mankind...!</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Silence, ghost!
