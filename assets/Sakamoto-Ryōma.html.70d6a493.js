One of the shishi who contributed the most to the Meiji Restoration, being the central figure of the Satchou Alliance, founder of the Kaientai, and proposer of the restoration of imperial rule.</p><p>As a child, he was considered an underachiever, to the point he was expelled from his cram school supposedly for bad results. But once he started his sword training, his skills increased remarkably fast.<br> Later on, he travels to Edo to study swordsmanship and joins the Chiba dojo to train the Hokushin Ittouryuu. At the time, Commodore Perry\u2019s fleet of American black ships come to the Uraga seas and seeing that was very meaningful for the later parts of his life.</p><p>After returning to Tosa, he joins the Tosa Loyalist Party formed by Takechi Zuizan. However, he later deserts Tosa to live in the Chiba dojo in Edo. There he finally meets Katsu Kaishuu and becomes his disciple. This encounter would lead to great changes in Japan\u2019s history later down the line.</p><p>Thanks to Katsu Kaishuu\u2019s intervention, he was absolved from the crime of desertion. Then he did everything he could to advance Katsu Kaishuu\u2019s plans of founding a training grounds for marines. And when that\u2019s done, he works there as a head naval instructor.<br> The changing trends of the time lead to the start of a suppression movement against the Tosa Loyalist Party, casting a dark shadow over his friends Takechi and Izou. Ryouma even receives orders to return to his land, but he ignores it, branding him a deserter for the second time.</p><p>In 1865, after multiple incidents like the Ikedaya Incident and Kinmon Rebellion, he founds the Kameyama Shachuu (later known as the Kaientai), an organazition very similar in personality to modern corporations.<br> Through deals of arms and ammunition, he achieves the great feat of mediating the long-time enemies Choushuu and Satsuma, forming the Satchou Alliance.</p><p>At that time, events like the Teradaya Incident, where Ryouma\u2019s dissenters go after his life, started becoming more frequent, but that didn\u2019t stop him.</p><p>He continued his work, which included writing a project for new national structure, titled Eight Proposals While Shipboard. However, 1 month after the emperor returns to power, he is assassinated in Oomiya, Kyoto.

Everyone liked him, everyone found him unsettling, and in the end, when he was cruelly murdered, he left the living world with no grudges or regrets about it. From beginning to end, he was dreaming of a society where everyone would have an enjoyable life.
