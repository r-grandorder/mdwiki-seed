Can you believe it!?<br> That&#39;s Lord Hektor!)</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> (This is amazing!<br> Lord Hektor is an absolute legend!)</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> (He&#39;s one of the great heroes of the Trojan War, and one of the Nine Worthies spoken about in hushed tones throughout all of history!)</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> (He&#39;s also my and Ruggiero&#39;s ancestor!<br> Oh gosh, oh gosh, oh gosh...)</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> (All this time I&#39;ve been here, and I still haven&#39;t introduced myself properly... Oh gosh!)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> It&#39;s okay. Just try to relax.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> (Exhale)... (Inhale)...</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> (Exhaaaleee)...<br> Okay, I&#39;m feeling a little calmer now!</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> Thank you, Master. This is the perfect chance to talk to him. I can&#39;t let it go to waste.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Why not go rectify that now?</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> !</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> ...Okay, Master. If you think that&#39;s a good idea,<br> then that&#39;s just what I&#39;ll do.</p><hr><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> Here goes nothing!</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> U-um, excuse me!</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong><br> Hm?</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> Y-you there, the one with the shining helmet! Are you Lord Hektor, the great hero of the Trojan War!?</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong><br> Hmm...</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong><br> I don&#39;t know about the \u201Cgreat hero\u201D part, but if you&#39;re looking for Hektor of Troy, you&#39;ve found him.</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong><br> So what&#39;s up, little Bradamante?<br> What can your old ancestor here do for you?</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> Well, you see, um...</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> I still haven&#39;t introduced myself properly since coming to Chaldea, so, um, I wanted to rectify that.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> It&#39;s a pleasure to meet you in person, Lord Hektor!</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong><br> Hey, thanks. Pleasure&#39;s all mine.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> Um, I was also wondering if, maybe...</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong><br> Yes?</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> I-if you wouldn&#39;t mind, um, maybe...you&#39;d like to join Master and me...</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> ...for tea!? Or some other beverage!?</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong><br> Tea, huh? Hmm...<br> Well, it&#39;s not like I don&#39;t have time, but...</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong><br> (Honestly, I don&#39;t think we&#39;d have all that much to<br> talk about. But I can also see Master standing behind<br> her with [\u2642 his /\u2640\uFE0F her] hands clasped together begging me to say<br> yes, so...)</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong><br> Sure, why not? Nothing wrong with the occasional cup of tea, especially for happy occasions.</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong><br> &#39;Course, we didn&#39;t have tea back in this old man&#39;s time, so drinking was pretty synonymous with alcohol.</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong><br> Alcohol lasts forever, and it&#39;s high in nutrients, too. Plus, not every area has plenty of clean, fresh water to go around, you know?</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> Right! That&#39;s how the Kingdom of the<br> Franks used to be! Well, really...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Didn&#39;t that pretty much used to be the case everywhere?</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> Yes, that&#39;s what I&#39;ve been told!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> So alcohol wasn&#39;t always a luxury good then.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> Not at all. It was once as common and essential to daily life as bread.</p><hr><p><strong>Hektor:</strong><br> So that&#39;s how it was back in the Kingdom of the Franks too, huh. So, does that mean you didn&#39;t have tea parties back in your time, either?</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> That&#39;s right! We didn&#39;t!</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong><br> I see.<br> (So why do you seem so happy about that?)</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> I occasionally got to enjoy Chinese tea whenever I&#39;d meet with Lady Angelica of Cathay...</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> ...but we never had any cultural traditions surrounding tea of our own!</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> Back then, tea ceremonies and parties and whatnot were still very limited to the East.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> Tea didn&#39;t become a cultural fixture in Europe until...<br> Hmm, let me think...</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> I think Holland was the country that popularized green tea...</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> ...and the British Empire did the same for black tea relatively recently.</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong><br> The British Empire, huh?</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong><br> Hmm... Was that the one that started<br> in the Isles of Britannia?</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> That&#39;s right!</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> Back when I was alive, it was known far and wide as the prosperous Kingdom of England.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> It&#39;s also where Stolfo\u2013I mean, Astolfo, one of the Twelve Paladins, was born.</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong><br> That Rider with the pink hair, huh?<br> Well, whaddaya know.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> In fact, he&#39;s actually a prince to England&#39;s royal family, though most of us tend to forget that, including him.</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong><br> No kidding! A prince so scatterbrained he even forgets he&#39;s a prince, huh? Hahaha, that&#39;s priceless!</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong><br> I know a scatterbrained prince myself, but it sounds like that one handily takes the cake, amazingly.</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong><br> Something tells me we&#39;d get along nicely.</p><p><strong>Paris:</strong><br> Achoo!</p><p><strong>Paris:</strong><br> (Sniffle) That&#39;s weird.<br> Can Servants even catch colds?</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> A cold, is it?<br> Well that won&#39;t do at all, Paris.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> You might need to get a shot.<br> Come with me so I can take a look at you.</p><p><strong>Paris:</strong><br> Aw maaan...</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong><br> The Kingdom of England, aka the British Empire from the Isles of Britannia, huh.</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong><br> Wait. Aren&#39;t the Isles of Britannia where\u2013</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> ...Yes.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> Britain is the island where Prince Aeneas of Troy&#39;s descendants ended up settling down.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> And it&#39;s where they went on to found the glorious Kingdom of Britain.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> But a few hundred years later...</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> ...the last king of Britain, Arthur Pendragon,<br> King of Knights, lost his final battle...</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> ...and after the Saxons migrated, the Kingdom of Britain\u2013</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong><br> That was when the last vestiges of Trojan lineage vanished from the face of the Earth. Right?</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong><br> Well hey, what do they say in the East?<br> Land outlasts kingdoms?</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong><br> Just because a nation is gone doesn&#39;t mean its people disappear. Not to mention its land, oceans, and rivers all stick around, too.</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong><br> It&#39;s no different with feelings. Losing a war sucks, but it doesn&#39;t mean everything&#39;s gone forever.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Like, say...</p><hr><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Bradamante and Ruggiero.</p><hr><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> ...Hey, yeah!</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong><br> There you go. Troy might&#39;ve lost spectacularly and faded away, but you&#39;re still here.</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong><br> And just look at how well you and this old man&#39;s other descendants turned out.</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong><br> I&#39;m relieved, really. It feels good to see your blood, sweat, and tears still be around in later generations.</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong><br> Really, when you think about it, what would it say about us if we let a little war or two eradicate us completely?</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong><br> That&#39;s it.<br> I can tell you grew up strong, little Bradamante.</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong><br> ...That being said.</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong><br> All of that goes out the window when we&#39;re talking about all of humanity possibly being destroyed.</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong><br> Man, as if dealing with a single nation going away wasn&#39;t enough of a pain in the neck.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> You&#39;re right!</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> We can&#39;t let anyone bleach all of human life away!<br> We have to restore humanity, no matter what!</p><p><strong>Gareth:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Gareth:</strong><br> ...Oh gosh, that conversation between Sir Hektor and Lady Bradamante I happened to overhear was so inspiring!</p><p><strong>Gareth:</strong><br> Now what am I going to do?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> Jack shit, that&#39;s what.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> You shoulda just kept on walkin&#39;, but instead,<br> you had to stop and hide like some kinda idiot.</p><p><strong>Gareth:</strong><br> Don&#39;t call me an idiot!</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> I&#39;ll call you whatever the hell I want, idiot!</p><p><strong>Gareth:</strong><br> Can&#39;t you tell I&#39;m trying to be considerate and not interrupt their conversation!?</p><p><strong>Gareth:</strong><br> Also! Doesn&#39;t Lady Bradamante...</p><p><strong>Gareth:</strong><br> ...remind you of me?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> ...You think?</p><p><strong>Gareth:</strong><br> I can just tell she&#39;s a really hard worker, you know?</p><p><strong>Gareth:</strong><br> And Sir Lancelot, hehe, has praised me directly for my work ethic! More than once, even!</p><p><strong>Gareth:</strong><br> So we&#39;re basically two peas in a pod!</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> Haaa?<br> (Special Translation: You really think so?)</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong><br> Hm? Something wrong?</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> I sensed somebody watching us!</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong><br> Eh, now that you mention it, I can feel a few eyes on us. Ah well, it&#39;s probably just some of our Chaldea compatriots, so I don&#39;t think it&#39;s anything to\u2013</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> You! Are you watching us?!</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> Yes, you! Don&#39;t bother trying to hide!<br> Come on out where we can see you!</p><p><strong>Man in Shadow:</strong><br> Oh, uh...</p><p><strong>Man in Shadow:</strong><br> I wasn&#39;t trying to hide, I promise. I was just kinda...stuck. (&#39;Cause it was too awkward to go out.)</p><p><strong>Mandricardo:</strong><br> But I don&#39;t want to give you the wrong impression, so...<br> I&#39;m sorry.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> I know you!<br> You&#39;re Mandricardo!</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong><br> Is that so.</p><p><strong>Mandricardo:</strong><br> ...!</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong><br> Hm?</p><p><strong>Mandricardo:</strong><br> I-I... Um...<br> H-hey.</p><p><strong>Mandricardo:</strong><br> I, uh, I really wasn&#39;t trying to eavesdrop, I promise. I just happened to pass by, that&#39;s all.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Mandricardo:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Mandricardo:</strong><br> ...Uh, yeah, so.</p><p><strong>Mandricardo:</strong><br> I&#39;ve got, uh, you know, training and stuff, so...<br> I&#39;ll get out of your hair now.</p><p><strong>Mandricardo:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Mandricardo:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Mandricardo:</strong><br> Um... Can I ask you something?</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> Of course!</p><p><strong>Mandricardo:</strong><br> Why&#39;re you following me? I was planning on training alone today (read: like always), so...</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> ...Are you sure?</p><p><strong>Mandricardo:</strong><br> I&#39;m sure.</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong><br> I&#39;m only here &#39;cause Bradamante and Master grabbed my hands and dragged me here, by the way.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> (Gasp) I-I-I-I&#39;m so sorry, Lord Hektor!<br> I wasn&#39;t even thinking!</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> I was just so anxious, and you&#39;re just so f-fatherly that I grabbed your hand without realizing.</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong><br> Hey, I get it.<br> That kind of thing just happens sometimes.</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong><br> So, anxious, huh? I didn&#39;t know you cared about Mandricardo that much.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> I... I, uh...</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> Ummm...<br> Well...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> What is it, Bradamante?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> You know, you do seem kind of...fixated on Mandricardo.</p><hr><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> Well, um... How can I put this...<br> Gnnn!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Do you two know each other or something?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Weren&#39;t you guys enemies when you were alive?</p><hr><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> Yes, we did.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> King Mandricardo of the Tatars is the son of King Agrican, who was killed by the de facto leader of the Twelve Paladins, Roland!</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> He came across Lord Hektor&#39;s shield and armor over the course of his travels, and then tried to get his hands on the legendary sword Durendal...</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> ...so that he could complete one of the Nine Worthies&#39; armor sets and go after Roland, holder of said sword, to avenge his father&#39;s death!</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> In short, he&#39;s the paladins&#39; sworn enemy!<br> Which is why I...!</p><p><strong>Mandricardo:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong><br> Sworn enemy? Really?</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong><br> C&#39;mon, that was a long time ago, right? Not to mention it was back when you were both still alive.</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong><br> Now you&#39;re both Servants\u2013shadows of humanity sworn to serve the same Master.</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong><br> Do you really need to bring old quarrels into Chaldea, especially after they&#39;ve long been dead and buried?</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> (Gasp of realization)</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> Y-you&#39;re right...<br> It&#39;s just as you say, Lord Hektor!</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> I&#39;m so sorry, King Mandricardo. I was way out of line.<br> I hope you can forgive my foolish behavior.</p><p><strong>Mandricardo:</strong><br> Uh, it&#39;s okay. Don&#39;t worry about it.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> Of course you&#39;re not our sworn enemy.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> Our only sworn enemies are Morgan the Witch, Great King Agramante, and Demogorgon the Demon God!</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> What you are, King Mandricardo, is...</p><p><strong>Mandricardo:</strong><br> Yeah...?</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> Our rival!</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> You were the powerful warrior king who went toe to toe with both Ruggiero and Roland!</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> You were a fearsome rival in every sense of the word, and I owe you an apology for ever insinuating otherwise!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> (Heartily nod in assent)</p><hr><p><strong>Mandricardo:</strong><br> I-I, uh... I&#39;m not really sure what you&#39;re going on about, but...</p><p><strong>Mandricardo:</strong><br> S-so you consider me your rival, huh?<br> Well, thanks. That&#39;s nice of you.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> Once again, I ask that you please forgive my foolish behavior, King Mandricardo!</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> If there is anything I can do to make it up to you, anything at all, please don&#39;t hesitate to let me know!</p><p><strong>Mandricardo:</strong><br> ...Uh, that&#39;s okay.</p><p><strong>Mandricardo:</strong><br> Really, you don&#39;t have to worry about it.<br> It&#39;s fine.</p><p><strong>Mandricardo:</strong><br> (At this point, I just wanna hurry up and get back to my room already...)</p><p><strong>Mandricardo:</strong><br> Having you apologize all over the top and formal like this is honestly weirding me out more, so... Let&#39;s just let bygones be bygones, all right?</p><p><strong>Mandricardo:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Mandricardo:</strong><br> (D-damn, talk about a radiant smile...)</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> So you forgive me!!!?</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> Oh thank you, King Mandricardo! I had no idea you were such a kind and magnanimous man.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> If only Ruggiero had had a chance to get to know you, I&#39;m sure he would have also\u2013</p><p><strong>Energetic Voice:</strong><br> I see how it is!</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong><br> Hm? Isn&#39;t that\u2013</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> Who goes there!?</p><p><strong>Energetic Voice:</strong><br> Yesterday&#39;s enemy!</p><p><strong>Energetic Voice:</strong><br> Is today&#39;s friend!</p><p><strong>Energetic Voice:</strong><br> That&#39;s just what&#39;s going on here, right?<br> What a wonderful expression!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Gareth!</p><p><strong>Gareth:</strong><br> That&#39;s right! It&#39;s me, Gareth!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Uh-oh. If you&#39;re here in full armor, does that mean</p><p><strong>Gareth:</strong><br> Hehehehe, your instincts are spot on, Master.</p><hr><p><strong>Gareth:</strong><br> Thanks to a series of increasingly unlikely coincidences, I heard everything while I was passing by! Just sit back and leave this all to me!</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong><br> Uh, there&#39;s really nothing to leave, since we&#39;re not arguing anymore...</p><p><strong>Gareth:</strong><br> Lady Bradamante...in the spirit of deepening our<br> friendship, what would you say to a lancing duel!?</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong><br> Uh, I really don&#39;t think there&#39;s any need to go to that kind of trou\u2013</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> !!!</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> That...</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> ...sounds like a wonderful idea!<br> Would you be willing to join us, King Mandricardo!?</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> I would love to try sparring with you and Lady Gareth!</p><p><strong>Mandricardo:</strong><br> N-nah, I&#39;m good...
