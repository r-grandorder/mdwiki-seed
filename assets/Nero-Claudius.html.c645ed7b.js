I have no clue what she&#39;s talking about, but for now, let&#39;s fight!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> That was a good warm-up. How was I?<br> My sword skills haven&#39;t gotten worse, have they?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> They&#39;re much improved and will come in handy...</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Haha! I know, right? I know, right!<br> You&#39;re an honest girl, Mash! I like you!</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Anyway, I&#39;ll start the search.<br> According to my intuition...

Is this a...pelican?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...I&#39;m not sure.<br> It looks like a penguin to me.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Looks like someone beat us here.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Guess it was too good to be true.</p><hr><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> This sucks!<br> But it wasn&#39;t such a waste of time after all!</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> If you look closely, there&#39;s some stuff left in here.<br> Whoever came before us must be a careless fool!</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Okay, we&#39;re going to take this and have a triumphant return! Good work Fujimaru, Mash.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Um... Well, that&#39;s fine, but why?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I don&#39;t see why an emperor would really need any treasure.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> ...Umu, with my Golden Rule I wouldn&#39;t have to worry about money, but I need more capital right now.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> More capital?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> For what reason?</p><hr><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> That&#39;s a secret, of course!<br> You&#39;ll find out eventually, so look forward to it!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...You heard her, Senpai.<br> It seems that Her Majesty has some sort of grand plan.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Anyway, let&#39;s collect some resources that we might be able to use. There&#39;s some Saint Quartz!</p><h2 id="a-golden-business" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#a-golden-business" aria-hidden="true">#</a> A Golden Business</h2><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> The time is now. I shall start the grand enterprise that I&#39;ve been planning for a long time.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> However, to make something perfect,<br> you need unparalleled talent and resolve.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Don&#39;t you think so, Fujimaru?<br> You should understand my suffering.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> (Senpai. I think Red Saber is trying to talk to you.)</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> (These questions can be a headache.<br> Let&#39;s just give her a random answer.)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> O-Of course I understand.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I don&#39;t get it at all.</p><hr><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Umu! I knew you&#39;d get it right away.<br> Thanks to you, I&#39;ve made up my mind.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> We&#39;re going to rebuild the Domus Aurea! My Noble Phantasm and the essence of my artist&#39;s soul\u2014</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> In any event, we&#39;ve come to the plains in search of the last required piece. Lend me a hand, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> We need to be careful with money.<br> Rebuilding the Golden Theater will be costly.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> The materials, personnel, and my design fees! This time, let&#39;s try to do something about the material costs.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> She&#39;s trying to improve her Noble Phantasm with money... Not a lot of Heroic Spirits would do that.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> So that&#39;s why you were trying to gather treasure before.<br> But Your Majesty, can you strengthen your Noble Phantasm like that?</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Of course. The Golden Theater I created with my magical energy is based off the original that existed.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> It&#39;s a matter of the image that&#39;s in my mind when I activate my Noble Phantasm. If we renovate the theater, I can sear that image in my mind.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> That way, when I use my Noble Phantasm it should be just as extravagant and even more dazzling. That&#39;s the plan, anyway.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...I see. So her Noble Phantasm depends on the power of her imagination.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The more grand that Theater becomes,<br> the more real the image becomes for Red Saber.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I think it&#39;s already real enough, but...</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Haha, don&#39;t compliment me now, Fujimaru.<br> You&#39;re so cute. Compliment me later.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> You&#39;re going to wear yourself out.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Dummy! Pushing yourself and pretending is the same thing! What&#39;s the point of not trying your best?</p><hr><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> In any event, the final material should appear soon.<br> Everyone get ready for combat. This is going to be tough?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ???<br> It&#39;s going to appear?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Just what are you going to have us make?</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Isn&#39;t it obvious?<br> A colosseum of sorts.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou?</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Umu, a new Golden Theater. A mix between a theater and a colosseum, a completely new way to watch someone fight.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> ...Well, there won&#39;t be any fighting in the Theater.<br> I&#39;m just going to make the entrance look like the Colosseum.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Do you guys know what Colosseum means?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I think it was...Oh, I remember.<br> It means &quot;Before the Giant Statue.&quot;</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> That&#39;s right.<br> It came from the word &quot;colossus.&quot;</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> There&#39;s a giant statue in front of the Colosseum in Rome that watches over the spectators.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> \u2014Oh, that&#39;s right. It was around the time of Emperor Nero when that colosseum\u2014</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> That&#39;s right! It was a statue of me!<br> It&#39;s 31 meters high. It was a beautiful statue.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Though when the Colosseum was built my Theater was destroyed, but let&#39;s not talk about that.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> In any event, this time I&#39;m after\u2014</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Master, we&#39;ve got hostiles!<br> Oh, no\u2014There&#39;s a bunch of golems closing in!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Nero, this couldn&#39;t be your\u2014</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Umu. I used my patrons to drive the golems here to use as material!</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Let&#39;s do this, Fujimaru!<br> It&#39;s the spring of golem hunting!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> We&#39;ve taken out the enemy golems...<br> The battle is over...</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Kyuu...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> What a primitive way of fighting...<br> To pummel the gates physically...</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> U-Umu, this went too far.<br> I&#39;ve realized my mistake here...</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> But with this much material here, let&#39;s start building!<br> I&#39;ll show you how mankind first started using concrete!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> In what pose will you build the statue?</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Hm...I have to think about that...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I want to build a statue of Mash, too.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> N-No, that&#39;s quite okay, Senpai!</p><hr><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> ...Sorry. I&#39;ll build the statue later.<br> These golems make for good materials, but...</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> They just don&#39;t have the right appeal.<br> The voices I hear from the stones are the brawny types.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> I can&#39;t carve a good statue with this.<br> I&#39;ve given up on the Colosseum style this time.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> But I will rebuild the Theater.<br> Don&#39;t worry, I won&#39;t waste your effort Master.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Now it&#39;s time to really get to work! Let&#39;s get the materials together and make our triumphant return to Rome!</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> We&#39;re going to make my Theater strong, firm, and as tough as a fortress...</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> That&#39;s right, something Heracles can&#39;t even handle.<br> The strongest Theater yet!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> This emperor hasn&#39;t learned anything!</p><h2 id="no-matter-how-many-times-the-end-comes" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#no-matter-how-many-times-the-end-comes" aria-hidden="true">#</a> No Matter How Many Times the End Comes</h2><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Sorry about that Fujimaru.<br> I have some personal business I need your help with.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> ...The United Empire is gone, and Rome is in an ephemeral peace.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> However, the one who led Rome as its first citizen,<br> Nero Claudius is no longer there.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Rather, the human &quot;Nero&quot; is no longer there because I contracted with you, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> The human &quot;Nero&quot; already left Rome just like in history.<br> Now &quot;I&quot; sit as its Emperor.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The Era&#39;s ability to bring back the past...<br> No, to repair itself.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> As long as the Servant Nero is here, the Emperor Nero must be dead.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> In normal space and time, both the human before death and the Servant after death can exist simultaneously.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> But in a Singularity, &quot;what&#39;s accurate&quot; and<br> &quot;what&#39;s stronger&quot; ends up taking precedence.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Once the Heroic Spirit Nero contracted with you,<br> the Nero at Septem became this Nero, unfortunately.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You didn&#39;t have to say &quot;unfortunately,&quot; Mash.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...My apologies.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I wasn&#39;t trying to criticize you...<br> Sorry about that, Emperor Nero.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> It&#39;s fine.
