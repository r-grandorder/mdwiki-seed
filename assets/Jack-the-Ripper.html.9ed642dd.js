Nursery?</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme(?):</strong><br> No, I am not Nursery Rhyme.</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme(?):</strong><br> I just transformed into someone you wouldn&#39;t want to have to fight.</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme(?):</strong><br> I&#39;m actually retribution.</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme(?):</strong><br> You&#39;re going to atone for all those people you killed.</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong><br> ...!</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme(?):</strong><br> Are you going to run away from your sins?<br> Are you going to refuse your just deserts?</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong><br> ...Stop it.</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme(?):</strong><br> Oh no I won&#39;t!

I&#39;m not saying that to be mean.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong><br> But the fact is, in truth she is an evil spirit born from the city of London itself...</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong><br> ...and Jack the Ripper is just the skin the spirit has chosen to wear.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong><br> What&#39;s more, that particular trait is something wholly unique to her, at least as far as I know.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong><br> While I have heard rumors that another criminal has been summoned among the Berserkers...</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong><br> ...I feel fairly confident in saying that our Jack is the only one who appears this young.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> But she&#39;s still smart, right?</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong><br> Oh yes, she&#39;s very wise. To put it another way, she&#39;s a very quick thinker.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong><br> Of course, you could also say that most Servants are wise, whether they look like children or not.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong><br> Incidentally, I&#39;m pretty sure that wisdom is not something she had while she was still alive, so to speak.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong><br> If anything, it&#39;s like... Well, crowd wisdom.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong><br> Regardless, she&#39;s a child now, and deserves to enjoy all that that confers.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I have to say, she&#39;s pretty sweet for an evil spirit.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong><br> Oh yes, absolutely.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong><br> She may be brutal and merciless towards her enemies, but you could say the same of most any Servant.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong><br> If anything, it&#39;s extremely heartwarming to see her trying to enjoy her life with such childlike wonderment.</p><hr><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong><br> ...But she&#39;s also a murderer, remember?</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong><br> !</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong><br> I suggest you stand back a bit, Master.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong><br> Sorry for drawing my Black Keys so suddenly.<br> If you don&#39;t mind my asking, who are you?</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Me? Hmm... I suppose you can call me \u201CMs. London.\u201D</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Ms. London...?</p><p><strong>Ms. London:</strong><br> Not that my name particularly matters.</p><p><strong>Ms. London:</strong><br> Now then, are you ready to face reality?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I know that she&#39;s killed people before, Ms. London.</p><p><strong>Ms. London:</strong><br> Of course. It&#39;s right in her name, after all.<br> But you mustn&#39;t turn away from that fact either.</p><hr><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong><br> ...It would seem you&#39;re not here to fight us then.<br> I apologize for my earlier actions.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong><br> ...Hmm.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong><br> Master, this is just my intuition speaking,<br> but I think we should let her come with us.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong><br> I think that&#39;s what she wants too.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Got it.</p><hr><p><strong>Ms. London:</strong><br> ...Thank you. I&#39;m glad we were able to reach an understanding so quickly.</p><p><strong>Ms. London:</strong><br> It is as you said. I would like to accompany you two.</p><p><strong>Ms. London:</strong><br> It doesn&#39;t matter what I am, or why I am.</p><p><strong>Ms. London:</strong><br> While I&#39;m sure it won&#39;t be straightforward to do so,<br> right now, I would ask that you think only of saving that child.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong><br> Looks like we&#39;ve found an obstacle already.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong><br> Once we&#39;re done with them, I&#39;m hoping you&#39;ll tell us more about what it is you want.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong><br> Now then, shall we, Master!?</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Ms. London:</strong><br> Jack is one of London&#39;s many victims.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong><br> Yes, that sounds right.</p><p><strong>Ms. London:</strong><br> She&#39;s a poor, pitiful being, fully deserving of our compassion. That&#39;s why it&#39;s no surprise she sought revenge.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong><br> Hold on. That doesn&#39;t sound quite right.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong><br> If someone had killed her, then her taking revenge on them would make perfect sense.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong><br> Though of course, if we happened to be there, both Master and I would try to stop her from doing so.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong><br> But taking revenge on someone who didn&#39;t kill her makes no sense at all.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong><br> That&#39;s just lashing out.</p><p><strong>Ms. London:</strong><br> True. But as someone whose name escapes me once said...</p><p><strong>Ms. London:</strong><br> ...victimhood can be used to legitimize any number of evils.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong><br> ...That&#39;s true.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong><br> I must admit that it is all too common for one to use one&#39;s position as a victim\u2013or the appearance thereof\u2013as a weapon.</p><p><strong>Ms. London:</strong><br> That is the sort of line Jack is walking right now.</p><p><strong>Ms. London:</strong><br> Please, stop her before she crosses it.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> ...We&#39;re standing at the edge of an abyss.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>Somebody is whispering in our ear, telling us we&#39;ll feel much better if we just jump off.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>They say we deserve pity because we were murdered.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>Killed by our parents, our doctors, society, and by who knows what else.</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme(?):</strong><br> You can&#39;t always run away, you know?</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme(?):</strong><br> If you don&#39;t come clean with your sins,<br> they&#39;ll just keep piling up!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>Shut up. We didn&#39;t do anything wrong.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>We only seek retribution. You&#39;re the ones who are punishing us after you went and made us like this.</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme(?):</strong><br> Yes, you may be right. In fact, you almost certainly are! But does that mean it&#39;s okay for you to kill others?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> ...Yes. It has to be.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>It has to be okay to get back at people.<br> It has to be okay to take revenge.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>We&#39;re... We&#39;re so...</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme(?):</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong><br> We&#39;ll...kill you.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> ...Now, now. You mustn&#39;t go around killing like that.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>We hear a clear, kind voice.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>We turn around to see someone shrouded in hazy mist.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>And yet, for some reason,<br> seeing them made us stop in our tracks.</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong><br> ...Who are you?</p><p><strong>???:</strong></p><p>Hehe, it doesn&#39;t matter who I am.

The more we think we have to shrug it off, the angrier we get.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>Whoever this person is, they&#39;re right.<br> We didn&#39;t do anything wrong.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> So why should we...?<br> Why shouldn&#39;t we...?</p><p><strong>???:</strong></p><p>That&#39;s not right either, Jack.</p><p><strong>???:</strong></p><p>Your anger, your frustrations, your regrets... They&#39;re fine as they are. Those are things all living beings need to reflect on.</p><p><strong>???:</strong></p><p>...Just like how you can&#39;t stop to linger unless you&#39;ve been constantly seeking something, some things can&#39;t be seen unless you have regrets.</p><p><strong>???:</strong></p><p>And now...what you&#39;ve been seeking is here.</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong><br> Huh?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Jack!</p><hr><p><strong>Jack:</strong><br> Mommy! And...Amakusa Shirou?</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong><br> Aha, now I see.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong><br> Ms. London, was it?</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong><br> Could you be London itself, just as your name suggests?</p><p><strong>Ms. London:</strong><br> Yes...and no.</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong><br> Huh? Is that the same person we&#39;ve been talking to here?</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong><br> Nonsensical though that may sound, it does look that way.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong><br> She must have wanted to help you very much indeed.</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong><br> ...Hmm, okay.</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme(?):</strong><br> So, there are more chirping songbirds here now.<br> But that doesn&#39;t matter.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong><br> Hmm.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong><br> You&#39;re not actually Nursery Rhyme, are you?</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong><br> Ah! We thought so!</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong><br> She may be anyone and no one, but she would never transform into adults who have given up on their dreams.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong><br> Hmm. So that must mean...</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong><br> ...you read Jack&#39;s memories and chose to look like someone who would make a good victim. Am I right?</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme(?):</strong><br> Wow, that&#39;s amazing! It&#39;s like watching a great detective in action!</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong><br> Lamentably, I lack a certain gentleman&#39;s facility with the violin.</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme(?):</strong><br> But it doesn&#39;t matter that you&#39;ve figured me out. I&#39;ll still be a victim as long as I look like this!</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong><br> Hmm.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong><br> I&#39;d be very interested to figure out what you truly are, but for now, I&#39;ll settle for just defeating you.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong><br> Do you think you can beat her, Jack?</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong><br> But...<br> But she&#39;s...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> It&#39;s okay, Jack.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> That girl there? She&#39;s nobody.</p><hr><p><strong>Jack:</strong><br> Huh?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> She&#39;s neither a victim nor a victimizer.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> She&#39;s just someone we have to beat to get out of this dream.</p><hr><p><strong>Jack:</strong><br> Oh, yeah.</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong><br> Now we get it. We have to get out of here so you can leave too, right, Mommy?</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong><br> Yes, that&#39;s very true. Not to mention the real Nursery Rhyme, and your other friends, would be very sad without you.</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong><br> Oh no, we don&#39;t like that.<br> We don&#39;t want them to be sad.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong><br> Right? So then, there&#39;s only one thing left to do.</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong><br> Yeah, you&#39;re right.<br> ...Okay! We&#39;ll dismember her!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme(?):</strong><br> ...Aww, too bad.</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme(?):</strong><br> I was so sure my society would have been perfect if I had just embedded you conceptually into it as an aggressor.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong><br> Now I see. How very unusual.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong><br> I never would have thought the residual data from our combat simulations would gain consciousness and try to create its own society.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong><br> Maybe you inadvertently copied a strange spell or two when you made this perfect recreation of London?</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong><br> Given how close this location is to the Clock Tower, I&#39;m not surprised recreating it could lead to some oddities.</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme(?):</strong><br> I guess I&#39;ll have to choose the next place I recreate more carefully then.</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme(?):</strong><br> All right... See you later, Ms. Perpetual Victim.</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong><br> Bye-bye!</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme(?):</strong><br> ...Ugh, this is so disappointing.</p><p><strong>Ms. London:</strong><br> Well, that&#39;s a relief.</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong><br> You are</p><p><strong>Ms. London:</strong><br> I&#39;m nobody, Jack. Though if I had to pick something, I suppose I&#39;d say I&#39;m London&#39;s conscience.</p><p><strong>Ms. London:</strong><br> No matter how coarse human society&#39;s systems may be, or how inferior its character...</p><p><strong>Ms. London:</strong><br> ...the fact remains that everyone has at least a little conscience in them.</p><p><strong>Ms. London:</strong><br> The same concept was present even in the society that that Nursery Rhyme made.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong><br> That still leaves a few questions unanswered though.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong><br> For example, why are you a woman?<br> Why did you choose that particular personality?</p><p><strong>Ms. London:</strong><br> Well...</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong><br> Is it because you&#39;re a mommy,<br> even if you&#39;re not our Mommy?</p><p><strong>Ms. London:</strong><br> ...You know, I like that interpretation.<br> Yes, let&#39;s go with that.</p><p><strong>Ms. London:</strong><br> I&#39;m someone you&#39;ve dreamed about.</p><p><strong>Ms. London:</strong><br> Someone who loves and accepts you unconditionally, and who wouldn&#39;t hesitate to take a bullet for you if necessary.</p><p><strong>Ms. London:</strong><br> Someone who, once upon a time, just might have been your Master in a Holy Grail War.</p><p><strong>Ms. London:</strong><br> Yes, I think that&#39;s just a lovely dream...<br> A Tr\xE4umerei.</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong><br> Nn...</p><p><strong>Ms. London:</strong><br> Now, it&#39;s time to wake up from this simulation, and go back home.</p><p><strong>Ms. London:</strong><br> Will you be okay now, Jack?</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong><br> ...Yeah. We think we&#39;ll make do.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong><br> Oh good, it looks like our comms are back online. This seems as good a time as any to exit the simulation then.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong><br> Farewell, Ms. London.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Goodbye!</p><p><strong>Ms. London:</strong><br> Goodbye, everyone.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Thank you for showing us the way.</p><p><strong>Ms. London:</strong><br> Not at all. I&#39;m the one who should be thanking you.</p><hr><p><strong>Jack:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Ms. London:</strong><br> Oh my. What&#39;s wrong, Jack?</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong><br> Well, um... We think...</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong><br> ...we&#39;re really glad...we got to meet you.</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong><br> Maybe we still haven&#39;t met you yet, or maybe we already did...</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong><br> But now that we&#39;ve met you, we...<br> On second thought, never mind that part.</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong><br> We think...we&#39;re gonna try a little harder.</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong><br> Goodbye, Mystery Lady.</p><p><strong>Ms. London:</strong><br> Goodbye, Jack the Ripper. May you be happy to your final breath.</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong><br> Um, Mommy? We&#39;re sorry for what happened today.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> That&#39;s okay. How are you doing now?</p><hr><p><strong>Jack:</strong><br> We&#39;re not sure.</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong><br> We don&#39;t really get humanity, and we don&#39;t have any reason to work hard for them.</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong><br> We even think the world might be better off if they were gone.</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong><br> But right now, we&#39;re having fun. We&#39;re happy.</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong><br> Not to mention, if that mysterious lady is out there somewhere...</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong><br> ...No, even if she&#39;s gone now, and there&#39;s only traces of her left somewhere on this planet...</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong><br> We think we have to do the best we can.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Thanks, Jack.</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong><br> You&#39;re welcome, Mommy!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Then let&#39;s all do our best together, okay?</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong><br> Yeah... Yeah, let&#39;s!<br> We promise we&#39;ll try really, really hard!</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong><br> So, maybe...we can still dream together too! Okay, Mommy?</p><hr><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> ...When one person kills another, that person is indelibly marked with sin.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> In that sense, she has long been a grave sinner, and always will be.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> But you can also look at it this way.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Now that those victims have all come together as a single entity in the form of Jack the Ripper...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> ...they&#39;ve finally been given the right to dream.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> As she nods off by the young [\u2642 man&#39;s /\u2640\uFE0F woman&#39;s} side,<br> she can hear happy, peaceful music playing nearby.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> The kind of music...that children dream about.</p>', 460);
