It is the subject of quests undertaken by famous knights such as King Pellinore, Sir Palamedes, and Sir Percival. The strange creature has the head and neck of a snake, the body of a leopard, the haunches of a lion and the feet of a hart. Its name comes from the great noise it emits from its belly, a barking like &quot;thirty couple hounds questing&quot;. &#39;Glatisant&#39; is related to the French word glapissant, &#39;yelping&#39; or &#39;barking&#39;, especially of small dogs or foxes.</p><p>[2] Shihainin (\u652F\u914D\u4EBA, &quot;executive/administrative manager&quot;) is an authorized representative of a company or unincorporated business under Japanese commercial law.</p><h2 id="material-images" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#material-images" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Material Images</h2><p>(Lib will add after publish)</p><h2 id="dialogue" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#dialogue" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Dialogue</h2><table><thead><tr><th style="text-align:left;">Occassion</th><th style="text-align:center;">English</th><th style="text-align:center;">Japanese</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style="text-align:left;">Summoned</td><td style="text-align:center;"></td><td style="text-align:center;"></td></tr></tbody></table>', 71);
