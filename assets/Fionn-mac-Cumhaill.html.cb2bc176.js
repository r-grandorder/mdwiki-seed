But that&#39;s just the end result.</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong><br> I killed a raging demonic beast, and slaughtered a creature from the underworld you could call death itself.</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong><br> But, all that is expected of a guardian of Erin, a warrior serving the High King.</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong><br> The deed would have been done without me.<br> For we are the glorious Knights of Fianna!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou, fou.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes, Fou.<br> ...It sounds pretty heroic to me.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> But you&#39;re being modest.<br> Fionn mac Cumhaill of Fianna, guardian of Erin.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Huh? Modest? That&#39;s modesty?<br> All it sounds like to me is bragging...</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong><br> Haha, surely you jest.<br> I&#39;m just a man. I&#39;ve nothing to brag about to anyone\u2013</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong><br> Am I sure? Well, I&#39;m sure I&#39;m the hero who managed to slay a fallen Divine Spirit.</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong><br> I&#39;m the descendant of the war god Nuadha, and the central figure in the Erin myth? But see, that&#39;s merely the end result.</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong><br> I&#39;m simply a man. Yes\u2013just a handsome man whose face is slightly more beautiful.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You called yourself a handsome man!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> What self-confidence.</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Ugh, so bright! It&#39;s like a flood of self-confidence and bragging, isn&#39;t it!?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Why does it hit me so hard... So this is Fionn mac Cumhaill, the most fulfilled man in all of Erin!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Protector of peace who has beaten many monsters\u2013<br> He&#39;s fit to be called a hero, a great hero.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> But, well, Master.<br> Well...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Fionn had his fair share of problems...<br> Calamities...or more like troubles...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Has he?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I think I&#39;ve heard something.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Yes. You might say he had \u201Clady troubles.\u201D</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Fionn may not be personally responsible, but if what I heard about the Knights of Fianna&#39;s downfall is true...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> it was partly due to his actions.<br> At the very least, that&#39;s how the knights portray it.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> By not saving the life of his reconciled subordinate, Diarmuid, he lost his charisma, and the order collapsed\u2013</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong><br> Hm? What do you speak of, Mash?<br> Having second thoughts about marrying me?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> N-No, not at all!<br> I&#39;d never marry you!</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong><br> Oh? Is that so?<br> Hahaha, \u201Cnever\u201D is so harsh!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> (Senpai, keep this between us, okay?)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> (Fionn knows about the Order&#39;s collapse in his memories, but...he doesn&#39;t feel like part of it.)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> (Like when we met Alexander before. Not the King of Conquerors of his later years, but the boy.)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> (I think this is similar. He&#39;s been summoned in his young form. That&#39;s why\u2013)</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> (I see. So, he&#39;s aware of his later failures,<br> but feels like they happened to someone else, right?)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> (Yes, Doctor.)</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong><br> What are you whispering about...<br> Oh, I see. Rumors about me? Is that it?</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong><br> No need to bite my thumbs.<br> I already know. Mash\u2013</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong><br> \u2013You&#39;ve fallen in love with me. Sorry about that.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> !?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> !?<br> (Even though she said she&#39;d never, like, 5 seconds ago!?)</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fo, fou!?</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong><br> I am aware of it.<br> Of how I&#39;m almost way too beautiful.</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong><br> This face, this physique.<br> It must almost be cruel to you girls...</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong><br> Thus my fate, namely\u2013 My lady troubles!<br> My never-ending assault of lady troubles!</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong><br> Yes, I need only stand still, and noble ladies will propose to me. I even once received a twin love confession from a lovely pair of witch sisters.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> T-Twin confession!<br> Do things like that actually happen in real life!?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I&#39;m beyond envious... I don&#39;t know about you as a person, but you shine so brightly as a man, Fionn mac Cumhaill...</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou!?</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong><br> My most beloved person, treasure of Erin...<br> My first wife, to be specific...</p><p>Yes. How she and I loved each other...<br> It was so instant and eternal...</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong><br> That it made an evil fairy start stalking me like an idiot! Oh, this is all part of my destiny of endless lady troubles!</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong><br> Oh, however, I don&#39;t want to put the blame on you ladies.</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong><br> It&#39;s fate, and so nothing can be done.<br> Overflowing beauty can drive a woman mad, at times.</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong><br> I&#39;m just...too beautiful...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Dazzling, too dazzling...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Y-Yes... Certainly...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Um, are we done here?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Senpai, I don&#39;t think he can hear you\u2013</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Fionn seems to think the source of all his troubles is always from elsewhere.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> He&#39;s right, in a sense...<br> But that&#39;s... No.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou, fooou.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Right, Fou. Just a bit...<br> He doesn&#39;t seem fully satisfied...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I&#39;m terribly dissatisfied!<br> Why do popular guys get even more popular?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> W-Well, never mind. Anyway, why did we come here all the way to the 1st century?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> To the Ancient Roman era that&#39;s under correction,<br> and heading out specifically to Gaul\u2013</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong><br> I don&#39;t have actual business in Gaul.<br> I sensed danger in Erin and my feet led me here.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Erin... Ireland?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Oh, I see. You didn&#39;t come to Gaul.<br> You&#39;re trying to get closer to Ireland.</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong><br> Right, and I guess I was on the spot.</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong><br> They seem to have sensed our approach, and they&#39;re coming out to greet us.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Guuuu!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Detecting hostile presences!<br> Senpai, here they come... Combat instruction, please!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Charge them head-on!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Calm down!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes, Master!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Confirmed defeat of the first wave!<br> But the next one will be inbound soon!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> This isn&#39;t the first giant \u201Chand\u201D we&#39;ve seen\u2013<br> but something seems strange, Senpai!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> They seemed to be leading beastmen?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> They&#39;re after Fionn?</p><hr><p><strong>Fionn:</strong><br> Ah, this sensation really brings back memories... Of the time when I was a mere traveler, and not the leader of the Order.</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong><br> I\u2013</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong><br> I!<br> I faced evil as a lone warrior!</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong><br> Against those who cruelly murdered innocents!<br> Yes, I... I know about you!</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong><br> \u2013Come and get me!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> M-More are coming!?</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Guuuu!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Here comes the second wave! No... They&#39;ve revived!?<br> And there are more of them! Be careful!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong><br> ...Hm. So I guess that&#39;s all of them.</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong><br> You made it through the fight unharmed.<br> The disturbance I felt is now gone.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That giant hand...<br> Was that the danger you sensed?</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong><br> Oh, yeah. Well, I guess it turned out to be that.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That was an unknown enemy we&#39;ve met multiple times. We have no accurate data on it\u2013</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> But you talked as if you knew something about it.<br> Is it possible...you have some idea?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I&#39;d like to hear it, too. Yeah... You definitely sounded like you know something!</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Wait, he&#39;s ignoring me? He&#39;s ignoring what I say?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Please, Fionn. If you know anything, please don&#39;t hide it...</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong><br> ...How can I keep my mouth shut when such a lovely lady looks at me with such passion.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Right, so...that&#39;s how it is...<br> He really is ignoring me...</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou, foou...</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong><br> That said, this is just a hunch.<br> I don&#39;t have enough evidence right now.</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong><br> As captain of the glorious Knights of Fianna, I can&#39;t afford to make an unsightly mistake in front of a lady.</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong><br> So, could you give me some time?<br> When I have solid proof, I&#39;ll most definitely tell you.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Senpai.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Can&#39;t be helped.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Looks like we have to wait.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...I see.<br> I understand, Fionn.</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong><br> Now, with the power of my Noble Phantasm of wisdom,<br> \u201CFintan Finegas\u201D\u2013</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong><br> we&#39;d solve any riddle instantly,<br> but that would be boring, wouldn&#39;t it?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Boring!?<br> If it&#39;ll tell us everything, then use it, please?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Like making a prediction about the King of Mages&#39; next move! There are other things I&#39;d like to know as well so... Please?</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong><br> Hah hah hah. I&#39;d say he probably set up some countermeasures so it can&#39;t be easily predicted. Same goes for that giant hand.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Ugh... Fine, b-but what&#39;s with the name of your Noble Phantasm!</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong><br> Anyways, Mash.<br> May I ask something?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Sure. What is it?</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong><br> I did ask you to wait, but there are things that we can talk about without waiting.</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong><br> So, let&#39;s go to My Room and discuss in detail. You&#39;re curious about me, too, right?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You said \u201Cabout me\u201D just now?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> That room isn&#39;t yours, is it?</p><hr><p><strong>Fionn:</strong><br> ...Right. Okay, Fujimaru can come, too. That&#39;s fine by me!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> W-Wait!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Man, he&#39;s full of energy.<br> Still, I&#39;d like to learn a thing or two from him, too...</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fouuuuu!</p>', 148);
