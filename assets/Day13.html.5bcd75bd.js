I have to try to ask her as indirectly as possible.&quot;</p><p>I make my mind up and stand up.</p><p>Let&#39;s go to the living room.</p><p>I hope I&#39;ll be able to penetrate the fortress using the calm before-dinner air as a shield\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>&quot;Just hypothetically.</p><p>What should we do if we win the Holy Grail War?&quot;</p><p>So.</p><p>Since I couldn&#39;t come up with any good ideas, I ask her directly.</p><hr><p>&quot;Eh?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Huh?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Hm?&quot;</p><p>They all give the same response with different expressions.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015I&#39;m talking about after we win. I&#39;m saying what should we do if we win the Holy Grail War.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;You don&#39;t need to explain the question... but what&#39;s wrong? Why are you asking?&quot;</p><hr><p>Even though they don&#39;t nod, it seems like Saber and Illya have the same question.</p><p>...I guess it was unnatural to abruptly ask.</p><p>But I have to play ignorant for now.</p><hr><p>&quot;Well, it just came to mind.</p><p>There are only three Servants left, so it&#39;s not that weird to start thinking about it, right? There&#39;s not much left now and the end is near.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Hmm... Well, you&#39;re right.</p><p>Even you&#39;ll start thinking about it in this situation. Even though you didn&#39;t start this because you wanted to, I bet you&#39;re curious about the reward since you&#39;re risking your life.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Y-Yeah. I&#39;m curious.&quot;</p><p>...Thank God Tohsaka likes to reason things out.</p><p>I think one of Tohsaka&#39;s good aspects is to consider anything as a possibility if it sounds reasonable.</p><p>Well, just in this case, though.</p><hr><p>&quot;So, how about you, Tohsaka? What will you do if you get the Holy Grail?&quot;</p><p>I ask as naturally as I can.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Let&#39;s see. I only really thought about winning, so there&#39;s nothing I wanted the Holy Grail to grant.</p><p>I&#39;ll get it, but I haven&#39;t thought about anything after that.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>So she&#39;s fighting because she doesn&#39;t want to lose, huh?</p><p>...Well, I guessed so, but I never really thought I&#39;d be right.</p><hr><p>&quot;I&#39;m stunned. You seem to be the one thinking the most, but you&#39;re actually the one who thinks the least.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Heh, you&#39;re one to talk. Then what about you, Illyasviel?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;I don&#39;t know. I was just told that the Holy Grail is mine, so I shouldn&#39;t give it to anyone.</p><p>Since it&#39;s mine to begin with, of course I don&#39;t care about it.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...Oh. So you&#39;re saying the Holy Grail War is more fun than the Holy Grail?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Of course. I only came to win. I don&#39;t care who uses the Holy Grail.&quot;</p><hr><p>...Are they the same?</p><p>The two glare at each other silently and there seems to be a sympathy I can&#39;t understand.</p><hr><p>&quot;......&quot;</p><p>Saber doesn&#39;t say anything.</p><p>She must not intend to join this conversation.</p><p>But\u2015\u2015no matter how much Saber hates it, I must ask her this question now.</p><hr><p>&quot;I kind of understand you two&#39;s intentions.&quot;</p><p>I try to nod naturally and...</p><p>&quot;Then how about you, Saber?&quot;</p><p>I ask Saber.</p><hr><p>&quot;......&quot;</p><p>Saber doesn&#39;t answer.</p><p>...They must have realized Saber&#39;s acting in a complicated manner as they both stare at her.</p><p>If I&#39;m counting, there must be about a minute&#39;s silence.</p><hr><p>&quot;I do not need to say this, but it is my duty to obtain the Holy Grail.</p><p>I do not know how powerful the Holy Grail is.</p><p>But as long as it is the Holy Grail, I must obtain it.</p><p>...And of course, I would have my wish granted if it can grant it.&quot;</p><hr><p>\u2015\u2015She said it.</p><p>Without a doubt, Saber said she has her own wish\u2015\u2015!</p><hr><p>&quot;I see. Then what&#39;s your wish?&quot;</p><p>I restrain my pounding heart and ask calmly.</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>Saber doesn&#39;t answer.</p><hr><p>...That&#39;s fine too.</p><p>If she cannot answer, chances are good that her wish is a selfish one.</p><hr><p>Considering Saber&#39;s personality, she would hesitate to speak of a selfish wish.</p><p>So\u2015\u2015I would prefer if she keep quiet and not tell me a ridiculous wish.</p><p>Such whining fills my head.</p><hr><p>&quot;Is it that hard?</p><p>Grandfather said the wish of the Servants is to be resurrected into this world. Those Servants seek the Holy Grail to live a second life. Isn&#39;t that the case for you, Saber?&quot;</p><hr><p>I raise my head at her words.</p><p>There&#39;s no problem if that&#39;s Saber&#39;s wish.</p><p>But...</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015No, I have no interest in a second life.</p><p>My intentions are close to those of Rin and Illyasviel. My goal is only to obtain the Holy Grail.</p><p>I became a Servant as a price to obtain the Holy Grail.&quot;</p><hr><p>\u2015\u2015I knew that had to be it.</p><p>I knew the girl who took that oath pulling out the sword would not seek a second life.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Hold on. You became a Servant in exchange for obtaining the Holy Grail...? You mean the contract when you become a heroic spirit?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Yes. In exchange for becoming a Servant, I seek the Holy Grail.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;What!?</p><p>Then you&#39;re not a Servant summoned to obtain the Holy Grail, but you became a Servant by your own will...!?&quot;</p><hr><p>She must be really surprised as she yells all this, then tilts her head not believing her own words.</p><hr><p>&quot;...So Saber wasn&#39;t summoned because she was a heroic spirit, but she joined this battle willingly?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;But as long as you&#39;re a Servant, you&#39;re respected as a heroic spirit. So you can&#39;t interfere with this world deliberately... then you&#39;re well beyond the Servants&#39; rule... no, that&#39;s not right.</p><p>Geez, hold on. I&#39;ll work this out.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;No, you do not need to do so. What you said is correct.</p><p>I am different from the other Servants.</p><p>I have yet to become a complete Servant.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Not a complete Servant\u2015\u2015?&quot;</p><p>What does that mean?</p><p>No, more importantly\u2015\u2015what does it mean to become a Servant?</p><hr><p>Saber said...</p><p>She agreed to become a Servant as a price for obtaining the Holy Grail.</p><p>Then that means\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>&quot;...Hold on.</p><p>Could it be that the Servants are forced to fight as the price for obtaining something?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;No, that is wrong. From the very beginning, Servants are special familiars that exist only for the Holy Grail War.</p><p>&#39;Servant&#39; is summoning magecraft that uses the special characteristics of the heroic spirits.</p><p>They were originally heroic spirits, so they do not have any rules like &#39;I was given bread, so I have to work.&#39;&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...Yeah. The Servant system uses heroic spirits, guardian spirits.</p><p>They&#39;re using something that already exists, so there&#39;s no price for the Masters or the Servants to pay.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;But I&#39;ve heard that before they become a Servant\u2015\u2015they need to pay a price to become a heroic spirit.</p><p>Heroic spirits are guardians of the people, right?</p><p>It&#39;s like they work for people even after they die to prevent the destruction of humanity and so on.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;So, to become this guardian, a living hero must make a contract with something.</p><p>This is the contract of the heroic spirits\u2015\u2015a ritual to give their existence to the world after they die.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;The ones who obtain riches from the exchange become heroes, and after they do whatever they want to as heroes and die, they become Servants to pay for these riches.</p><p>So in other words, they go into debt to become a hero, and repay the debt when they die by becoming a heroic spirit.</p><p>We summon Servants by stealing the debt liability from the world.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Hm\u2015\u2015so humans become heroes by contracting with something, and they&#39;re summoned as heroic spirits after they die to pay for becoming a hero?</p><p>Then the conditions of the exchange that Saber made is\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><hr><p>The Holy Grail.</p><p>As Saber obtained the Holy Grail in her life, she became a heroic spirit after she died as a price\u2015\u2015?</p><hr><p>&quot;...That&#39;s not right. Saber says her objective is to obtain the Holy Grail. But she should have already obtained it, because she became a hero in exchange for the Holy Grail.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015No, Shirou. I have not yet obtained the Holy Grail.</p><p>Arturia\u2015\u2015King Arthur&#39;s wish was to obtain the Holy Grail while she lived.</p><p>I had to obtain the Holy Grail before I died.</p><p>So I agreed that I would become a heroic spirit after I died if I could obtain the Holy Grail.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;As Rin said, humans make a contract with the world to become a hero, receive powers beyond human, and pay for it with life after death.</p><p>...But I did not need the help of the world to become a hero. Fortunately, King Arthur needed no support to become a hero.&quot;</p><hr><p>...She didn&#39;t need support to become a hero.</p><p>So Saber became a hero by her own powers.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Hmm. But you&#39;re here as a heroic spirit.</p><p>Does that mean King Arthur requested a different exchange from the world after he became a hero?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...Yes. I needed the Holy Grail in my final moments. I could not stand not having the Holy Grail. A wish appeared that I needed to have granted.</p><p>That is why I made the contract of the heroic spirits.</p><p>That if I could obtain the Holy Grail, I would wield my sword as a heroic spirit after my death.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>In her last moment, she wished for the Holy Grail&#39;s miracle.</p><p>...I understand how she feels.</p><p>That bloody hill.</p><p>A grave of many swords and the many corpses of knights.</p><p>A lone king whose reign ended in betrayal.</p><p>...Her last moment was too unfair.</p><p>Even if she had no wish of her own before then, she must have thought that...</p><hr><p>I can&#39;t die here.</p><p>I didn&#39;t want an end like this.</p><p>So\u2015\u2015if she wishes to prolong her life, she shouldn&#39;t be embarrassed about it\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>&quot;...I see. So you became able to obtain the Holy Grail by selling yourself off after death.</p><p>But Saber, your condition was to obtain the Holy Grail while you were alive, right?</p><p>Then\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Yes. I could not complete my search for the Holy Grail while I was alive. I\u2015\u2015King Arthur could not obtain the Holy Grail even at the very end.</p><p>But the contract cannot be completed like that.</p><p>For the world to obtain me as a Servant, it must grant the Holy Grail while King Arthur is alive.</p><p>So\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015King Arthur will not die until she obtains the Holy Grail. No, King Arthur cannot die.</p><p>Then, you&#39;re...&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...Yes. Time stopped for me, King Arthur, at the moment of death.</p><p>According to the timeline, I should be already dead, but it will not be able to fulfill the contract that way.</p><p>King Arthur is summoned as a Servant and must die after she obtains the Holy Grail.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015So time itself isn&#39;t stopped, but you&#39;re stopped in time, huh?</p><p>...It doesn&#39;t matter how many times you repeat the fight as a Servant. Because the result of obtaining the Holy Grail and fulfilling your contract is determined, so....&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;That is correct. Eventually, I will obtain the Holy Grail and fulfill the contract. That is why I can be summoned into many ages before I become a heroic spirit, on the condition that my becoming a heroic spirit is already determined.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Not only the Holy Grail in this town.</p><p>If there is a chance to obtain the Holy Grail, I will be summoned to any battlefield.</p><p>And when I eventually obtain the Holy Grail and grant my wish, my stopped time shall start moving again.</p><p>King Arthur will face death and become a heroic spirit as a price for obtaining the Holy Grail.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...So it&#39;s like having a dream you can&#39;t wake up from right before your death, huh?</p><p>This Holy Grail War is just one of those dreams for Saber.</p><p>And you&#39;ll only be able to wake up when you obtain the Holy Grail.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Rin, you said that Shirou could not turn me into spirit form because he is inexperienced. But that is wrong. I cannot become a spirit because I have not died yet.</p><p>I am handled differently, but I am still classified as a living being.</p><p>...It was the same in the last Holy Grail War.&quot;</p><hr><p>...Saber says so as if she&#39;s apologizing.</p><p>I guess because she was lying about being stuck in physical form because I was inexperienced.</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>I don&#39;t really care about that.</p><p>There&#39;s something more important that I have to ask her.</p><hr><p>&quot;Saber. What do you mean by you&#39;re not dead yet? I understand that you won&#39;t die until you obtain the Holy Grail.</p><p>...From the conversation, I understand that you haven&#39;t been alive since the time of King Arthur.</p><p>But then, what are you right now?</p><p>You&#39;re not a copy of the real body, right?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;No. &#39;Heroic spirits&#39; that are summoned are all like copies of the &#39;true body&#39;, but I have not yet reached that rank.</p><p>Until I obtain the Holy Grail, I am called in the form of &#39;myself about to die&#39;.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;As Rin said, King Arthur is stopped in the river of time.</p><p>I must jump forward or backward from that position, and return to that stopped point once I obtain the Holy Grail.&quot;</p><hr><p>I draw a diagram in my head.</p><p>...I see, it&#39;s pretty simple once I visualize it.</p><p>King Arthur is stopped at the moment before death.</p><p>The flow of time doesn&#39;t care that she&#39;s stopped.</p><p>It keeps flowing and we&#39;re at the present.</p><hr><p>She jumps to each time as needed and returns to her own time after completing her duty.</p><hr><p>If she obtains the Holy Grail in one of the times she visits, her time will flow again and she will die, just like the history we know today.</p><hr><p>...Then heroic spirits must exist like this.</p><p>When they die, they are transferred to a place like a &#39;warehouse&#39;, where time doesn&#39;t flow.</p><hr><p>And they are summoned into various ages and disappear without returning.</p><p>So that must be what they mean by heroic spirits being a copy.</p><hr><p>It&#39;s like a clone made from their DNA.</p><p>The &#39;heroic spirit&#39; that has complete abilities and memories of when it was alive will appear in this world and learn many things. But it is useless.</p><hr><p>They have no way to return to the main body, but merely disappear.</p><p>So no matter how many times they are summoned into the same age, there will be no inconsistencies in their memories.</p><hr><p>I assume the ones that became heroic spirits will not change anymore.</p><p>Even if they obtain new knowledge, the self that learns it will just disappear once the duty is complete.</p><hr><p>...In that regard, Saber isn&#39;t a complete Servant.</p><p>Because Saber returns to her own time even after she is summoned.</p><p>\u2015\u2015To the self that is about to die on that bloody hill.</p><hr><p>&quot;Hold on.</p><p>Then, what? You&#39;re going to take it back to your time and use it if you obtain the Holy Grail!?</p><p>That&#39;s altering the past! Time travel and management of parallel universes is True magecraft. There&#39;s no way you&#39;ll be able to do that.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;But the Holy Grail allows me to do this.</p><p>I made a contract that I would become a Servant if I can use the Holy Grail.</p><p>The price being becoming a Servant, even if it means the elimination of the person called Arturia.&quot;</p><hr><p>Saber talks without much interest.</p><p>But that&#39;s strange.</p><p>Making a wish come true using the Holy Grail, that&#39;s fine.</p><p>But why did she say Arturia would disappear as a result?</p><hr><p>&quot;...What are you talking about? Arturia will disappear when she uses the Holy Grail...? Don&#39;t mess around.</p><p>Saber. You&#39;re\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>That girl, about to die quietly, alone on that hill.</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015not going to use the Holy Grail to save yourself?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...? What do you mean, Shirou?</p><p>My only desire is to save my country from ruin....&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Wha\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>I can sense that my face is frozen.</p><p>I should already have realized this, but my mind is spacing out and I feel like throwing up.</p><p>&quot;W-Why...?&quot;</p><p>But still.</p><p>I force my question out.</p><hr><p>&quot;It is obvious.</p><p>I could not protect my country. I became king to protect the country, but I could not fulfill that duty.</p><p>I thought at that time...</p><p>That perhaps the sword chose me by mistake.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Th\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>That&#39;s stupid.</p><p>Why?</p><hr><p>&quot;...No, I always had such doubts.</p><p>That I might not be the right king.</p><p>That there was another hero who should have been chosen.</p><p>At that time\u2015\u2015when I pulled the sword out, there must have been a suitable king who would have been able to save the country I could not.</p><p>...So if I could redo the selection of the king using the power of the Holy Grail, then\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><hr><p>...Then, what?</p><p>Does she mean to say that her country would not have been destroyed if she returned to that time?</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>I feel faint.</p><p>I&#39;m quickly surpassing mere anger that Saber would seriously wish for such a thing.</p><hr><p>I guess I&#39;m dumbfounded right now.</p><p>It&#39;s only natural.</p><p>Saber&#39;s wish is not for herself. And on top of that, it means her elimination.</p><hr><p>The girl in front of me exists because that holy sword was there and because a king pulled it out.</p><p>\u2015\u2015Preventing that would mean that the girl in front of me would not exist.</p><hr><p>Let&#39;s say she grants her wish using the Holy Grail.</p><p>The girl Arturia, never becoming king, would live out her days as a knight.</p><p>But what about the Saber in front of me?</p><p>As she is a heroic spirit, she will continue to be summoned to fight after her wish is granted.</p><hr><p>Since she paid a price to obtain the Holy Grail, Saber will continue to be, even if Arturia doesn&#39;t become king.</p><p>Taken away from the future and from the past.</p><p>She will forever be the lonely king dying on that hill.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Ridiculous.&quot;</p><p>I can&#39;t allow that.</p><p>There&#39;s no salvation there.</p><p>Even if she did redo everything and there really is a more appropriate king and her country lasts longer as a result, and even if she is saved...</p><hr><p>\u2015\u2015It&#39;s a lie.</p><p>Even if everyone around her becomes happy, the ten years she fought can&#39;t just disappear.</p><hr><p>&quot;No\u2015\u2015you can&#39;t do that.</p><p>You can&#39;t redo things and it&#39;s useless even to try.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...Shirou?&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015Don&#39;t use the Holy Grail for such a thing.</p><p>You&#39;re going to obtain the Holy Grail by fighting yourself, right? So you should use that miracle for your own sake.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...As I have told you, I will be using it for myself.</p><p>I\u2015\u2015Arturia must fulfill her duty as king.&quot;</p><p>&quot;...!&quot;</p><p>So why don&#39;t you understand\u2015\u2015!?</p><hr><p>&quot;Don&#39;t be ridiculous, you&#39;ve already fulfilled more than your duty...! You&#39;ve fought that much already. You didn&#39;t give up even when you were betrayed or feared. You didn&#39;t let go of your sword until the very end on that hill.</p><p>So why\u2015\u2015why do you have to keep such promises even after you die...!?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>Saber is astonished.</p><p>&quot;Oh...&quot;</p><p>\u2015\u2015It&#39;s too late to regret what I&#39;ve said.</p><p>I shouldn&#39;t have admitted that I see Saber&#39;s past in my dreams.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>...A heavy silence.</p><p>There are no words to give her nor any words to reply.</p><p>I can sense that anything I say will backfire in this situation.</p><p>But still\u2015\u2015I can&#39;t just stay silent.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Saber. I don&#39;t like it when people aren&#39;t rewarded for their hard work.&quot;</p><p>It&#39;s meaningless that way, and it&#39;s just too unfair.</p><p>I know it&#39;s a childish ideal, but I want to believe that people will get happier the more they work for it.</p><hr><p>&quot;...I won&#39;t lose to other Masters.</p><p>I&#39;ll obtain the Holy Grail for sure.</p><p>...So please, grant your own wish.</p><p>If you do\u2015\u2015I&#39;ll actually be able to find some meaning in this stupid war.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>That&#39;s the conclusion I&#39;ve reached.</p><p>I don&#39;t know what the Holy Grail is nor if it&#39;s right to obtain it.</p><p>But if Saber will be saved even a little, I&#39;ll be able to try with all my powers\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>&quot;...!?&quot;</p><p>The loud bell rings out and the house falls into darkness.</p><hr><p>The surrounding air changes immediately.</p><p>Even though the lights suddenly went off, nobody says a thing and tries to feel the surroundings.</p><hr><p>The loud ring stops and the living room is silent.</p><p>But.</p><p>The sound of light things rubbing against each other can be heard in the distance.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Was that alarm the boundary field on this house...?&quot;</p><p>I nod silently.</p><p>This sound is the same as when Lancer intruded.</p><p>Then this must be\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015!&quot;</p><p>The sounds are increasing and coming closer.</p><p>...A strange sound.</p><p>It reminds me of bugs crawling around a light trap.</p><hr><p>This living room is the only place free of the sound.</p><p>It hasn&#39;t even been a minute yet since the lights went out, but the living room is surrounded by this unknown sound.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015An enemy?

This is a scene I&#39;ve seen many times already.</p><p>This is one of the battles Saber experienced.</p><p>These are the remains of a battleground so familiar to her as she is always victorious.</p><p>After this, she will return to her castle, the people will celebrate her victory, and they will prepare for the next battle.</p><hr><p>This is her everyday life.</p><p>This is but one of the twelve great battles she has gone through.</p><p>That is why she does not bear any memories of the victory, but merely accepts it calmly.</p><p>I think about such random things.</p><hr><p>\u2015\u2015That is not a dream</p><p>Just a cold truth that cannot be changed.</p><hr><p>From the moment she drew the sword from the stone, she was not human.</p><p>After becoming a feudal lord like her father, she became a king with many knights.</p><p>She was called King Arthur or Arturia, and the girl who had tried to become a knight had her life turned around.</p><hr><p>\u2015\u2015No.</p><p>It is more correct to say that it ended.</p><p>At that instant, the girl with childlike features disappeared and the only existence permitted was that of the king of knights.</p><hr><p>She acted as the son of the king.</p><p>That is because the one to govern many territories and control the knights had to be male.</p><p>The only ones who knew that the king was just a girl were her father and the magus.</p><p>She literally covered herself in steel and sealed that truth for all her life.</p><hr><p>...Why didn&#39;t I realize what that meant?</p><p>Someone placed before everyone managed to keep her identity secret.</p><p>I don&#39;t know what suffering she went through as I&#39;m only watching from a distance.</p><hr><p>...Time passes.</p><p>These must be her memories of the ten years she spent as king.</p><p>There&#39;s only one thing common to all of them.</p><p>Even on the throne.</p><p>Even in a hallway.</p><p>Even on the battlefield.</p><p>No one talked to her.</p><p>Even the loud round table filled with the knights&#39; tales of bravado falls silent when the king steps in.</p><hr><p>So that&#39;s what it means.</p><p>She was only idolized.</p><p>Many knights looked down on Arturia who looked like a small kid, and they did not approve of swearing their sword to her.</p><hr><p>But because she drew out the sword that they could not, they had to obey her at least in form.</p><p>They just accepted the disgrace, believing that it would pass.</p><hr><p>Even if she drew the sword, she is just a child.</p><p>Even with Merlin&#39;s help, she will fail soon enough.</p><p>When that happens, they need to only take the holy sword away from her and reselect the king.</p><p>That&#39;s what most of the knights thought.</p><hr><p>But the results were different.</p><p>The knight that just entered adulthood was a king without flaw.</p><p>She brought peace to the fighting lords and immediately fought off the invading enemies.</p><p>Of course, it wasn&#39;t because of the power of the holy sword.</p><p>The holy sword only protects the king.</p><p>It is the king&#39;s power that protects the country.</p><hr><p>And in that way, she suppressed the knights with results.</p><p>The protection of the holy sword works only against enemy swords.</p><p>It does not help rule over people&#39;s hearts.</p><p>She worked hard to be an ideal king.</p><hr><p>And so, the knights had to follow their king from their heart.</p><p>They suppressed their dissatisfaction with the young king, as they saw he was perfect.</p><p>She tried to be an ideal king.</p><p>Being an ideal king was the condition of their support.</p><p>\u2015\u2015There was no room for the human, Arturia.</p><hr><p>The girl determined to be king.</p><p>A great knight who pulled out the holy sword, who did not age from that moment on, and one who won twelve great battles.</p><p>The more perfect she was, the more people kept away from her.</p><p>The longer she stayed that way, the more isolated she became.</p><p>\u2015\u2015That was her true identity.</p><hr><p>But she still did well.</p><p>No, she did too well.</p><p>She defeated her enemies efficiently and minimized the victims in battle.</p><p>No matter what kind of a war it is, a battle will have victims.</p><p>So she believed she should make sacrifices before the war to prepare the army and to defeat the enemy efficiently.</p><hr><p>She would exhaust one village to prepare the army, defeat the invaders before they could damage the land, and save ten villages.</p><p>That was the solution she came up with as the king, and in truth, it was the best policy.</p><hr><p>But the knights must have been unhappy.</p><p>For them, only the invaders should die. It was only proper to win without allowing any victims.</p><p>There is no need to sacrifice one&#39;s own territory before a battle.</p><p>We will win, so there will not be any victims.</p><p>There will not be any victims, so the king&#39;s actions are fruitless. That&#39;s what they thought.</p><hr><p>Of course, that was just a fantasy.</p><p>Once the battle began, the knights did not think about the small villages. It was only natural for them to trample over them as the small villages are not what they seek to protect.</p><p>The knights say it is only natural to be destroyed by the invaders, but it is a great sin to destroy them with our own hands.</p><hr><p>Of course, she knew that.</p><p>But a king cannot allow her personal feelings to affect her decisions.</p><p>She kills her emotions to make a decision, and the knights suppress their personal feelings to obey.</p><p>And after many sacrifices and continuing victories, the country became stable.</p><hr><p>The price of that was a revolt against the king.</p><p>&quot;King Arthur does not understand human feelings.&quot;</p><p>One knight said so and left the castle.</p><p>...It&#39;s a ridiculous story.</p><p>Nobody wanted her to be human, but they revolted against her because she didn&#39;t have a human&#39;s feelings.</p><hr><p>The age of chaos continues.</p><p>The knights, who had been dissatisfied with the king for some time, became more dissatisfied after that one knight left.</p><p>They pushed all problems onto her and cornered her.</p><hr><p>Ruin was in sight.</p><p>Death if she could not solve all the problems.</p><p>Even if she did solve them, the result would be the same.</p><hr><p>But such trivial things are of no concern to a king.</p><p>Her mind will not change even if she is abandoned, feared, or betrayed.</p><p>...Probably because she had her mind made up long before.</p><p>She abandoned her emotions from the moment she decided to pull out the sword.</p><hr><p>\u2015\u2015A scene from a few years before.</p><p>Knights from all over the country gathered to try to pull out the sword in the stone.</p><p>But nobody could pull it out, and the knights were desperate to choose the most superior king by competing jousting skills.</p><p>The knights went to the arena and forgot about the sword.</p><hr><p>...It felt much like watching a festival from a distance.</p><p>In the distance are the brave sounds of the cavalry.</p><p>The roars of the knights are far away and there is no one around the stone.</p><p>What did the girl think before that?</p><p>Before she realized it, an unknown magus was standing behind her.</p><hr><p>&quot;You should think this through before you grab that.&quot;</p><hr><p>He says he is not trying to frighten her, but that she should stop.</p><hr><p>&quot;You will not be human once you take hold of the sword.&quot;</p><hr><p>He also said that she would be resented by all humanity and die a miserable death.</p><hr><p>She could not have been without fear.</p><p>Because the magus showed her.</p><p>The end she would face if she took the sword.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015No.&quot;</p><hr><p>But that just made the girl more determined.</p><p>She nodded firmly, even when she was shown her future.</p><p>The magus asks her if she is really fine with that.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015Many people were smiling.</p><p>I do not believe it will be a mistake.&quot;</p><hr><p>She takes the sword.</p><p>The magus turns his back...</p><p>&quot;A miracle has a price. In exchange, you will lose the thing most important to you.&quot;</p><p>And leaves those prophetic words.</p><hr><p>That&#39;s right.</p><p>The girl only wanted to protect everyone.</p><p>But to do so, she had to throw away the emotion of &#39;wanting to protect people&#39;.</p><p>...Because one cannot protect a country as king if one has human emotions.</p><hr><p>She accepted it and pulled out the sword.</p><p>She accepted it and swore to live as the king.</p><p>So her heart would not change even if she was abandoned, feared, or betrayed.</p><p>She threw away her heart.</p><p>The young girl decided to protect in exchange for it.</p><hr><p>Who would ever know of such a sublime oath?</p><p>\u2015\u2015She chose to fight.</p><p>No matter what.</p><p>\u2015\u2015She still chose to fight.</p><p>Even if there was inevitable solitary ruin waiting at the end.</p><hr><p>And the end was this.</p><p>The battle of Camlann.</p><p>One knight usurped the throne while King Arthur was on a campaign, her country split into two, and a war began.</p><p>In the legend, it is said that knights and chivalry were utterly destroyed.</p><hr><p>She slashed away the knights that once followed her and attacked the lands she once protected.</p><p>The knights who sided with her died and her body was crippled.</p><hr><p>There was nobody around her.</p><p>That&#39;s normal. Nothing has changed.</p><p>The only thing in her heart is her pride as the king.</p><p>She knew of this end.</p><p>But she still ran through her life because she believed something came of it.</p><hr><p>That&#39;s why she has no regrets.</p><p>If there is one regret, it is that the country is in ruin.</p><hr><p>She raises her eyes.</p><p>She might be able to see the distant castle from this hill.</p><p>But all that&#39;s there is the remains of the battle, a deep forest, and a lake she must return to.</p><hr><p>\u2015\u2015Yes.</p><p>The hill she ran through is now a wall she cannot climb over.</p><hr><p>Strength escapes her shoulders.</p><p>And for the first time, the girl lets go of the holy sword by her own will.</p><hr><p>\u2015\u2015And that is the end.</p><p>It&#39;s only natural for the dream to end there.</p><p>Because that is the end of her memories.</p><hr><p>...So this is one end that cannot be changed.</p><p>She worked so hard, she was resented, and she was betrayed.</p><p>No one ever realized that she loved the people more than the country, and she was always the merciless king.</p><p>She was never rewarded or understood.</p><p>On the red hill of swords, the solitary girl who was always betrayed, is about to face death\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>I wake up to the sound of the rain.</p><p>&quot;...It&#39;s morning.&quot;</p><p>I hold my shaking head and get my body up.</p><p>It&#39;s not six yet.</p><p>The sound of rain from outside isn&#39;t that loud.</p><p>It&#39;s not a shower or a drizzle, but just normal rain.</p><hr><p>&quot;...!&quot;</p><p>I rattle my teeth at the sudden headache.</p><p>But it only lasts for a moment.</p><p>Neither the pain nor the image that pops into my head lasts long.</p><p>But that scene is more than enough to wake my brain up.</p><hr><p>&quot;...That dream\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>No, I don&#39;t even need to confirm it.</p><p>That was Saber&#39;s past.</p><p>It was the end of her life that happened a long time ago that cannot be changed.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>Before I realize it, I&#39;m gritting my teeth.</p><p>It&#39;s making a sound.</p><p>Somehow, I&#39;m really angry.</p><p>I grit my teeth loudly and suppress the urge to have a fit.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015Dammit!

He cannot be summoned.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Servants\u2015\u2015so, he is a Servant.&quot;</p><hr><p>No, that&#39;s obvious.</p><p>But in that case, there&#39;s a big problem.</p><hr><p>&quot;He is of class Archer. Of course, he is not the Archer whom Rin made a contract with. His abilities and character are too different.&quot;</p><hr><p>...I know that too.</p><p>It only lasted a short while, but I was able to feel how much of a monster he was.</p><hr><p>&quot;Hold on. That&#39;s not right.</p><p>If he&#39;s the Servant Archer, that makes eight.</p><p>Seven should be the limit of the summons in a single period. It&#39;s not like they restock when some of them disappear. After all, even the Holy Grail doesn&#39;t have the magical energy to summon more than seven.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;There are seven Servants because that&#39;s the basic limit, right? Then how can they summon an eighth\u2015\u2015hold on.</p><p>Saber, you met him in the previous war?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...Yes, Rin. On the last day of the previous Holy Grail War, I fought against him in a sea of fire.&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>My body tenses up for an instant.</p><p>Saber fought him in a sea of fire...?</p><hr><p>...It&#39;s nothing new.</p><p>Kotomine already told me that the fire was caused by the Holy Grail War.</p><p>So this shouldn&#39;t be a surprise.</p><p>It&#39;s just\u2015\u2015I was unconsciously trying not to think about it until now.</p><hr><p>&quot;What happened? Did you beat him?&quot;</p><p>&quot;No, I did not... no, I could not beat him. Because I...&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015You were beaten instead?</p><p>He&#39;s someone you couldn&#39;t beat even when you were properly summoned?&quot;</p><hr><p>Saber hangs her head and doesn&#39;t answer.</p><p>That pretty much answers her question.</p><hr><p>&quot;Saber\u2015\u2015couldn&#39;t win?&quot;</p><p>Not just the imperfect Saber as she is now, but Saber with her full power?</p><p>...Is that even possible?</p><p>If you look at her skill as a swordsman, Saber certainly is invincible.</p><p>Admittedly, Saber was the weaker against Berserker.</p><p>But Saber has that Noble Phantasm.</p><hr><p>The Noble Phantasms of other Servants are powerful, but Saber&#39;s exceeds even them.</p><p>I don&#39;t think there&#39;s any hero she can&#39;t beat using her holy sword\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>&quot;Then there&#39;s only one possible explanation.</p><p>He&#39;s not a Servant summoned in this war, but a Servant that remains from the previous war.</p><p>It only makes sense when that&#39;s true.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015!&quot;</p><p>My mind stops.</p><p>It&#39;s not that I agree with Tohsaka.</p><p>But what she said matches what I&#39;ve been hoping for since yesterday.</p><hr><p>&quot;...But that is...&quot;</p><p>&quot;That&#39;s the only possible explanation. Only seven Servants can be summoned each Holy Grail War. If there are any other Servants, they must be the &#39;winner&#39; of the previous Holy Grail War. Am I wrong?&quot;</p><hr><p>...A heavy silence.</p><p>But.</p><p>Why is she in such a good mood?</p><hr><p>&quot;Tohsaka. What are you so happy about?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Of course I&#39;m happy. There&#39;s a precedent.</p><p>I don&#39;t know who he is, but he&#39;s the guy who won the last Holy Grail War, right?</p><p>Then he must have obtained the Holy Grail. And he&#39;s staying in this world because of its blessing.&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;In other words, he&#39;s proof that you can keep your Servant in this world if you obtain the Holy Grail. I want to capture him and question him about it.&quot;</p><hr><p>\u2015\u2015Yeah, you&#39;re right.</p><p>I don&#39;t know who he is, but he&#39;s a Servant and he&#39;s still here after the previous war.</p><p>That means there&#39;s a way for Saber to stay in this world like him.</p><hr><p>&quot;Well, we don&#39;t know who he is or what his motive is, but I&#39;m sure he&#39;s an enemy we&#39;ll need to defeat.</p><p>So Saber, what&#39;s his true identity?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...I do not know. Even at the end, I could not tell who he was.</p><p>That hero did not have a Noble Phantasm symbolic of him.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;He doesn&#39;t have a symbolic Noble Phantasm...? That can&#39;t be true. A Servant without a Noble Phantasm can&#39;t be a Servant.</p><p>&quot;And besides, he\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Yeah, he was using so many. It should be easy to work out his true identity with so many Noble Phantasms. You just need to identify the appropriate hero for them.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Then let me ask you. Did you recognize any of those Noble Phantasms?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Of course. Let&#39;s see...&quot;</p><hr><p>Tohsaka ponders,</p><p>She thinks about it for a minute.</p><p>But then, she tilts her head in confusion.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015No way. That&#39;s impossible...&quot;</p><p>&quot;...? What&#39;s wrong, Tohsaka? What&#39;s impossible?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015I can&#39;t believe it. The bloody one was probably Dainsleif, and the one like a sickle was Herpe.</p><p>There was one that looked Chinese and another that looked like a Buddha thing\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><hr><p>Tohsaka looks crazy, talking to herself.</p><p>I guess this is what you call digging yourself a hole.</p><hr><p>&quot;Um, that one was similar to Saber&#39;s sword, but it should be different. It seems like it&#39;s from Northern Europe judging from its simple design, and most forms of demonic sword are from Northern Europe, but\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>She starts to grit her teeth.</p><hr><p>&quot;Hey, Tohsaka.&quot;</p><p>There&#39;s no point in leaving her like that.</p><p>I have to stop her now or there&#39;ll be some damage.</p><p>I don&#39;t need to add that I&#39;ll be the one damaged.</p><hr><p>&quot;Tohsaka, Tohsaka. Come back.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Geez, be quiet Shirou! I&#39;m getting confused because you&#39;re bothering me!&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;I&#39;m not trying to disturb you. It&#39;s about his Noble Phantasm, right?</p><p>I saw Dainsleif, Herpe, Durandal, Vajra, and Caladbolg. Oh, and I saw Gae Bolg.</p><p>I couldn&#39;t identify the Chinese one, but those are the most famous ones, right?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Ugh... you&#39;re right.&quot;</p><p>She glares at me in irritation.</p><p>I&#39;m hurt if she makes a face like that.</p><p>I&#39;m not knowledgeable, but it just popped into my head.</p><hr><p>&quot;But what does that mean!?</p><p>No hero has that many Noble Phantasms. No, more importantly, the sources are all different. I don&#39;t understand it\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Yes. That is why I could not tell his true identity.</p><p>He has an abundance of Noble Phantasms, the proofs of a hero. I could not narrow down his true identity because he had so many.&quot;</p><hr><p>The two ponder.</p><p>Well, there&#39;s certainly no way to tell if he has that many.</p><p>It&#39;s like hiding a tree in a forest, or something.</p><hr><p>&quot;Shirou. Do you have anything?&quot;</p><p>She glares at me. Yeah, she&#39;s definitely taking it out on me.</p><hr><p>&quot;Have what?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Anything you noticed or guessed. Anything that popped into your head.</p><p>What we need are unexpected opinions. Only accidents solve a deadlock situation.&quot;</p><p>Hm, she might be right.</p><hr><p>&quot;Hahaha, I see. \u2015\u2015You&#39;re making fun of me, right?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Don&#39;t be rude. I just think you&#39;re useless. So, do you have anything?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Nothing.&quot;</p><p>I give up honestly.</p><p>Tohsaka groans in regret.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Then there&#39;s only one answer. Saber, don&#39;t you think they&#39;re all fakes? Nothing else can explain it.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I feel the same way. However\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...? No, they&#39;re not fakes.&quot;</p><p>How did they arrive at that answer?</p><p>First of all, he wouldn&#39;t have been able to pierce Caster with fake Noble Phantasms.</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh. What do you base that on, Emiya-kun?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I&#39;m saying those are real. Rather, everything else seems fake.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Huh?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Well, it&#39;s just my intuition. ...Um, it&#39;s hard to explain, but those are all real.</p><p>Lancer&#39;s Gae Bolg is real, but I think the Gae Bolg he used is real as well.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...?&quot;</p><p>Gah, it&#39;s harder to explain if she makes a face like that.</p><p>No, forgetting that, why did I think that?</p><p>It&#39;s just that all the things he used were Noble Phantasms.</p><p>I can feel that.</p><hr><p>...Is it because I used &#39;projection&#39; against Berserker?</p><p>I could tell they were real Noble Phantasms just by looking at them.</p><p>Conception dwells in superior weapons, and something is missing from weapons that merely imitate them in shape.</p><p>I realized that when I imitated Saber&#39;s sword.</p><p>By that argument, I think that all the Noble Phantasms he used were perfect\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>&quot;...Well. Putting what Shirou said aside....</p><p>As we don&#39;t know his true identity, his objective is next.&quot;</p><p>Tohsaka sneaks a glance at Saber.</p><hr><p>&quot;We already know he&#39;s after the Holy Grail, but there&#39;s one other point I&#39;m curious about.</p><p>Can I ask you directly, Saber?&quot;</p><p>Man. Why does she put on that really evil smile when it comes to this kind of subject?</p><hr><p>&quot;...What do you mean, Rin?</p><p>You do not need to hold back if you wish to ask me something.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Really? Then I&#39;ll ask. What do you think of him? From the way he spoke, it seemed like he really has the hots for you.&quot;</p><p>&quot;......&quot;</p><hr><p>...I&#39;m not following Tohsaka&#39;s lead, but I sneak a glance at Saber.</p><p>Tohsaka is saying it wrong, but it&#39;s true he was attached to Saber.</p><p>No, it wasn&#39;t that nice.</p><p>He saw Saber as his and only his.</p><hr><p>&quot;I do not care what he thinks about. ...But, I remember that he did propose marriage to me in the previous war. Naturally, I deflected it with my sword.&quot;</p><p>Marriage, you mean\u2015\u2015!?</p><p>&quot;Wha\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>What is that Servant thinking\u2015\u2015!?</p><hr><p>&quot;Wow. I don&#39;t know if you should be happy in this case, but you don&#39;t feel too bad about it, right?</p><p>You must be happy as a woman to be proposed to even after you became a Servant.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;That is not true. I have no such freedom to begin with. My goal is to obtain the Holy Grail.</p><p>\u2015\u2015Honestly, such nonsense irritates me.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Really? Even if you feel that way, he was pretty into you. His type doesn&#39;t care how much they&#39;re rejected.</p><p>You&#39;re stubborn too, so he might be a good match for you.&quot;</p><hr><p>I don&#39;t know what&#39;s so funny, but Tohsaka&#39;s words are irresponsible.</p><p>Tohsaka seems to be happy to be talking to Saber about this kind of thing. Saber seems to have no interest, but...</p><p>&quot;I am telling you that I have no interest in such a thing. He is certainly a superior heroic spirit, but his way of thinking is too different from mine.&quot;</p><p>Saber answers honestly.</p><hr><p>&quot;Ohhhh. Did you hear that, Shirou? Saber has no interest in men. Are you relieved?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Rin, I believe that is of no concern to Shirou.</p><p>Your statement is a little strange.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;I would think so. That was a mistake on my part. But the strange part is the funny part.&quot;</p><p>Tohsaka laughs evilly.</p><p>Her eyes seem to be laughing not only at Saber, but at me as well.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>It irritates me for some reason and I stand up.</p><p>&quot;Huh? Where are you going, Shirou?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Tea. I&#39;m thirsty. I&#39;ll get some for everyone while I&#39;m at it.&quot;</p><hr><p>I spit that out and go to the kitchen.</p><p>I don&#39;t know why, but I&#39;m irritated. So I think I&#39;ll prepare extra bitter tea for Tohsaka.</p><hr><p>&quot;Then, I&#39;ll go back to my room. Let&#39;s have the complicated talk tomorrow after Illya wakes up.&quot;</p><p>After messing a lot with Saber, she drinks the bitter tea and stands up.</p><hr><p>&quot;Yeah, go to sleep. Don&#39;t come back.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yeah, yeah. I&#39;ll leave the rest to you, then.&quot;</p><p>I don&#39;t know what&#39;s so funny, but Tohsaka leaves in a good mood.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015What are you going to do, Shirou?</p><p>You should not push yourself even if your wounds have healed, so I think you should rest for tonight.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Yeah, that&#39;s my plan. But I&#39;ll watch over Illya for a bit longer.</p><p>I&#39;ll move her to a room if there doesn&#39;t seem to be any problem, and I&#39;ll go to bed after that.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I see. Then, I shall accompany you.&quot;</p><hr><p>Our conversation ends there.</p><p>It gets really awkward once it&#39;s quiet as Tohsaka was the loud one.</p><p>...No, awkward isn&#39;t the right word.</p><p>There are things I&#39;m worried about and things I need to say, so my mind is impatient.</p><p>Come to think of it, what I want to tell her is all in a mess.</p><hr><p>About the Holy Grail.</p><p>About her still being alive.</p><p>...Even if she does obtain the Holy Grail, there&#39;s no salvation for the girl called Arturia.</p><p>I don&#39;t even need to say why.</p><p>She has no wish for herself even now.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Saber, about what we were discussing before....&quot;</p><p>Our eyes meet.</p><p>Her awkward eyes seem to know what I&#39;m going to say.</p><hr><p>&quot;Yes, what is it, Shirou?&quot;</p><p>She tries to block my question with a calm voice.</p><p>...But I have to tell her.</p><hr><p>&quot;About what we were saying earlier.</p><p>Tohsaka said it too that Servants can stay if they obtain the Holy Grail, right? Then\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;No, I have no intention of staying here. I will return to my original time once I obtain the Holy Grail.&quot;</p><p>&quot;And you&#39;re going to redo the selection of the king? You&#39;re going to start everything over and not save yourself on the verge of death?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Right. It is the duty of a king to protect the country. My powers were not enough, so I must at least select an appropriate king in my place.&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>Her words really make me angry.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015You idiot! Wake up...!</p><p>The duty of the king doesn&#39;t matter! You&#39;re here, so you should do what you want to now\u2015\u2015!&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;I won&#39;t allow you to have any other goals. You&#39;re strong, right? Then finish this battle quickly, obtain the Holy Grail, and quit being a Servant...!</p><p>If you have a wish, don&#39;t go to the past and redo everything. If you want to change yourself, don&#39;t change the past, but change who you are now\u2015\u2015!&quot;</p><hr><p>...Saber doesn&#39;t answer.</p><p>She gives a small sigh.</p><p>&quot;You are obstinate, Shirou. I want you to stop bringing this up.&quot;</p><p>She firmly rejects my opinion.</p><hr><p>&quot;And it is not as if one can stay if one obtains the Holy Grail.</p><p>Archer... that Servant does not remain in this time because of the Holy Grail. It was impossible for anyone to obtain the Holy Grail in the last war.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...? Saber, what does that\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>&quot;It is impossible to obtain what does not exist. On that day when the town was in flames, the Holy Grail was destroyed.</p><p>By the Master who betrayed me, Emiya Kiritsugu.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>My vision closes in.</p><p>I hold my body steady with my hands as it&#39;s about to fall.</p><hr><p>&quot;Emiya... Kiritsugu...?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Yes. He was my Master ten years ago in the previous Holy Grail War. I won to the end, and the Holy Grail came into Kiritsugu&#39;s hands.</p><p>Archer and his Master still remained, so the Holy Grail War should have been ended by their defeat.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;But Kiritsugu threw the Holy Grail away.</p><p>As a result, the town went into flames.</p><p>...That man ordered me to destroy the Holy Grail because Servants are the only ones that can touch the Holy Grail.</p><p>Kiritsugu used his last Command Spell to force me to destroy the Holy Grail.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Servants cannot stay in this world once the Holy Grail disappears.</p><p>Kiritsugu did not try to keep me here either.</p><p>My memory ends there. I could not ask him about the betrayal nor settle my match against Archer.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>Well, it&#39;s not like I never thought about it.</p><p>Father was a magus. If he lived in this town all his life, he must have been involved in a Holy Grail War.</p><p>But still\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>&quot;Why didn&#39;t you tell me that my father was a Master, Saber?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...Usually, a Servant does not hold memories of previous summonings. The same hero will not be summoned as a Servant again.</p><p>I am an exception to this rule. So I believed I should not mention this fact to you, Shirou.</p><p>...And I did not wish to tell you what kind of Master Kiritsugu was.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...? Why wouldn&#39;t you want to tell me?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Shirou. As you have seen my past in your dreams, I also saw your past.</p><p>...I was surprised by your past, but I could not believe how much Kiritsugu had changed.</p><p>[wrap text\u033D&quot;Emiya&quot;]Emiya Kiritsugu is a great person in your memories. But he is not like that in my memories.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...To state it simply, he was a typical magus. He was only interested in his objectives and he eliminated everything in his way. I could not see any human emotion in him.</p><p>He only spoke to me three times during the whole war.</p><p>...I do not think I need to tell you when he spoke to me.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;He was not cruel nor a born killer.</p><p>But he did not have anything that you would call emotion.</p><p>Just as he treated me only as a tool, he treated himself only as an object.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...Kiritsugu killed every emotion and killed every enemy.</p><p>I do not know what he believed in to make him do so, but he ordered me to destroy the Holy Grail when it was in front of him.</p><p>To be honest....</p><p>I have never cursed the Command Spell or a Master who has betrayed me, more than I did at that time.</p><hr><p>\u2015\u2015There&#39;s some truth in Saber&#39;s words.</p><p>No, they must all be true.</p><hr><p>Come to think of it, I don&#39;t know what Kiritsugu was like before that time ten years ago.</p><p>I couldn&#39;t guess anything about him before that time, and I saw no need to learn about such things.</p><p>It doesn&#39;t change a thing even if Kiritsugu was cold-hearted.</p><p>The man that adopted me was really childlike.</p><p>So my memory is my only truth.</p><hr><p>But what hurts my heart is....</p><p>If Kiritsugu was really a cold person, his last moments were just too empty\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>&quot;...I see. Maybe I was able to summon you because I&#39;m his son.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...I do not know. Kiritsugu summoned me in a legitimate way. As Kiritsugu&#39;s aptitude as a Master was high, he was hired by a magus family with a long history and entered the Holy Grail War.</p><p>I heard that everything he needed to become a Master was provided by that family.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;They had excavated King Arthur&#39;s artifact from Cornwall and gave it to Kiritsugu to use in the Holy Grail War. Kiritsugu used it as a catalyst to summon me.</p><p>So Kiritsugu himself does not have any factor to summon me nor is his attribute close to mine. You probably summoned me because of some other factor.&quot;</p><hr><p>...I get it.</p><p>It&#39;s not too surprising that Father used to be a Master.</p><p>What&#39;s surprising is that his Servant was King Arthur... the one standing in front of me right now.</p><hr><p>And one more thing.</p><p>Saber said that the Holy Grail was destroyed.</p><p>Then\u2015\u2015isn&#39;t this war completely meaningless?</p><hr><p>&quot;...I don&#39;t get it. You already knew there&#39;s no Holy Grail anymore, right? So why did you decide to take part in this ridiculous battle?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...I certainly do not know if the Holy Grail actually exists. But it would be strange for there to be no Holy Grail if I am summoned.</p><p>Have you forgotten, Shirou? I became a Servant to obtain the Holy Grail. To put it another way, I will not be summoned unless the Holy Grail is present.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Ah\u2015\u2015well, then.</p><p>The Holy Grail can restore itself even if it&#39;s destroyed?&quot;</p><p>&quot;No. The Holy Grail is not something easily replaceable.</p><p>It would be impossible for a destroyed Holy Grail to be restored.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Then\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>&quot;But it should exist. Servants are summoned since they are drawn to the Holy Grail. Servants would not exist if there is no Holy Grail.</p><p>That priest said so as well.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Priest\u2015\u2015oh, him.&quot;</p><p>The supervisor of the Holy Grail War living at the church.</p><p>That man that manages the Holy Grail must be able to answer all my questions.</p><hr><p>The end of the previous war.</p><p>What happened to the destroyed Holy Grail and to the Servant Archer?</p><p>And yes\u2015\u2015what did Kiritsugu see at the end of the battle to make him destroy the Holy Grail?</p><hr><h2 id="scene-08" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#scene-08" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Scene 08</h2><p>\u2015\u2015Don&#39;t be timid.</p><p>We&#39;re cornering Caster.</p><p>If we pull back, we might give Caster a chance to turn things around.</p><hr><p>Saber&#39;s sword moves quickly.</p><p>She is already right in front of Caster, and Caster will be slashed in an instant.</p><p>\u2015\u2015But.</p><p>&quot;...!&quot;</p><p>Saber suddenly stops.</p><p>Not because of Caster&#39;s counter-attack, but by her own choice.</p><hr><p>&quot;You\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>Saber instantly tries to dodge.</p><p>But she&#39;s too late.</p><p>Saber totters as if grabbed by something, and in that instant...</p><p>A warped dagger stabs Saber in the chest.</p><hr><p>&quot;Ca... ster\u2015\u2015that... is...!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes.

It is blunt as you can see, and it cannot kill even one person. But as you have sensed, it is a magical mark said to be almighty in one aspect.</p><p>...If you do not wish to touch it, I suggest that you do not come near me, Saber.&quot;</p><hr><p>Even though she says so, I can sense less composure in Caster than before.</p><p>Even as powerful as Caster is, as long as she uses magecraft, she won&#39;t be able to hurt Saber.</p><p>No matter what kind of a Noble Phantasm that dagger is, it won&#39;t do any good against Saber now.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Don&#39;t mind it, Saber.

This is the right choice for now.&quot;</p><hr><p>Saber lowers her sword.</p><p>I think I hear Caster laugh amidst the surrounding sounds of bones.</p><hr><p>&quot;I shall listen to you, Caster. I may let you go depending on your conditions.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Are you sane? I hold your lives in my hands.</p><p>If you act so boldly, I might just crush you.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Do not get me wrong. All you have is my Master&#39;s life, not mine.</p><p>\u2015\u2015But if you assault that, I will not hold back.

I was your target to begin with...?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Right. There is no reason to ignore a hero that can even defeat Berserker. The only remaining Servants are me, you, and Lancer. If you become my ally, Lancer is nothing.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015Three are left? Then Assassin is already defeated?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Who knows? He is not here anymore, so I assume he was defeated. It is only natural for a Servant who cannot protect their Master to disappear.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015!&quot;</p><p>Assassin was beaten...?</p><p>Then the Master at Ryuudou Temple is no more?</p><p>I didn&#39;t even know his identity, but that means another Master has disappeared.</p><p>The only remaining Servants are Saber, Caster, and Lancer, who has not shown himself since that first night\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>&quot;...Hm. This is the only useless talk I will engage in.</p><p>All I want is your Noble Phantasm. Give me your sword if you do not want your Master killed.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015That is useless.

Get out of my sight, you fool.&quot;</p><p>The man answers with a verdict of death.</p><hr><p>A snap.</p><p>When I realize the sound is of his fingers snapping, the tragedy has already begun.</p><hr><p>Many weapons suddenly appear in space and shoot at Caster like a machine gun.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015[margos]\u2015\u2015!&quot;</p><p>Caster raises her arm.</p><p>Concept of a shield.</p><p>A film like glass is created right above Caster.</p><hr><p>\u2015\u2015It probably has strength equaling Berserker&#39;s body.</p><p>But was it useless because it was made of glass?</p><p>Built like a crystal, it cannot even block one of the showering weapons and shatters into pieces.</p><hr><p>&quot;Eh\u2015\u2015?&quot;</p><p>A dumbfounded voice.</p><p>Without showing any concern for Caster&#39;s question, they pierce the black robe.</p><p>There&#39;s no mercy at all.</p><p>The robe is pierced by lances.

It is a great sin for a mere magus to even speak of capturing the king of knights.</p><p>It is rightly mine as I am the king. Such a skewering befits a fool pursuing the king&#39;s treasure.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;So, long time no see, Saber. Do you remember the decision I made?&quot;</p><p>The man says in an intimate manner.</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>Saber doesn&#39;t answer.</p><p>But her glare is different from before.</p><p>&quot;Why that face? Are you still not ready?</p><p>It has been ten years.</p><p>That should be enough time to decide\u2015\u2015oh, well... that&#39;s only for me. It must be like yesterday for you.</p><p>...Geez, what a silly woman. Making a man wait.&quot;</p><hr><p>The man laughs happily.</p><p>...My chest is hurting.</p><p>Partly from seeing that tragedy.</p><p>But more than that, I feel sick when that man looks down on Saber with such a ridiculous expression\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015. So there are more lowlifes left.&quot;</p><p>Commenting unhappily, the man turns to the mansion.</p><p>&quot;...?&quot;</p><p>There\u2015\u2015on the porch in front of the living room are Illya and Tohsaka.</p><hr><p>&quot;...What is that...&quot;</p><p>Illya is looking up at the man as if she&#39;s seen a ghost.</p><p>Straining her eyes, she shakes her head saying it&#39;s impossible.</p><hr><p>&quot;No\u2015\u2015who are you?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Huh? Fool, you cannot tell? I am one of the heroic spirits you know so well.&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015Liar!&quot;</p><p>Illya jumps off the porch and glares at the man.</p><hr><p>&quot;I don&#39;t know. I don&#39;t know you. A Servant I don&#39;t know about shouldn&#39;t exist...!&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Wha\u2015\u2015hold on, Illya......!&quot;</p><p>My call to restrain her comes too late.</p><p>The cluster of magical energy Illya releases shoots straight for that man.</p><hr><p>A clanging sound.</p><p>The man didn&#39;t do anything.</p><p>A mirror-like shield appeared in front of him and reflected Illya&#39;s magical energy shot.</p><hr><p>&quot;Eh\u2015\u2015?&quot;</p><p>As she fired the magical energy in anger, there&#39;s no way she can react to it.</p><p>Illya stands dumbfounded before the magical energy she fired\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>&quot;...! \u2015\u2015That hurts...&quot;</p><p>She is barely saved by Tohsaka, who instantly blocked it.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Hm. I see. It is a strange hybrid this time.</p><p>I assume they have schemed a bit so as not to make the same mistakes as last time.&quot;</p><p>The man looks at Illya.</p><p>A cold stare like the one directed at Saber... a stare prizing a possession.</p><hr><p>&quot;...No. No, no, nononononononono...! I-I hate you...!&quot;</p><p>Illya still glares at the man, pinned by Tohsaka.</p><hr><p>&quot;I do not care about your circumstances. Open it quickly. You are the fifth one.&quot;</p><p>The man speaks plainly.</p><p>What kind of effect does it have?</p><p>&quot;Ah\u2015\u2015no\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>Illya shakes violently and faints.</p><hr><p>That&#39;s it.</p><p>That&#39;s all that&#39;ll happen.</p><p>All Tohsaka and I can do is look up at that man.</p><p>...We both understand.</p><p>He isn&#39;t looking at us.</p><p>We would just share Caster&#39;s fate if we raised our voices.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>But Saber is different.</p><p>She is staring at the gold knight in a different kind of silence.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015Let me ask you one thing. Why are you still in this world, Archer?&quot;</p><p>Saber tries to control her voice.</p><p>Tohsaka and I can only be shocked by her words.</p><hr><p>&quot;There need be no reason. The Holy Grail is mine. What is wrong with coming to collect what is mine?&quot;</p><p>&quot;How foolish. You are not a hero like that. No, first of all\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Stop. If you say any more, we will have to fight.</p><p>\u2015\u2015Well, that was my original intention, but I lost interest. This place is too shabby to celebrate our reunion.&quot;</p><hr><p>Saying so, the man turns away.</p><p>He turns his back as if saying he has no interest in us.</p><p>&quot;We shall meet again sometime.</p><p>My decision has not changed since that time. Be prepared by the time of our next meeting.&quot;</p><hr><p>The man disappears.</p><p>With that, the tension in the air vanishes and the yard returns to its usual silence.</p><p>But that&#39;s the only thing that returned.</p><p>My home is ruined, and Illya is unconscious.</p><p>Saber, keeping her back to us, still bears that heavy silence.</p><hr><h2 id="scene-11" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#scene-11" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Scene 11</h2><p>I wake up alone.</p><p>Even if she has recovered, Saber still has to sleep periodically.</p><p>Saber went to bed right away after that, and I went to bed too to relieve Saber.</p><hr><p>That was an hour ago.</p><p>It&#39;s past midnight. ...I&#39;ll be able to sneak out without Saber or Tohsaka finding out now.</p><hr><p>I go out without making a sound.</p><p>I thought about using the bicycle, but it&#39;d be a problem if I wake them up by doing so.</p><p>I guess I&#39;ll walk there.</p><hr><p>There&#39;s no one around.</p><p>Even if it&#39;s midnight, this silence is abnormal.</p><p>The air is frozen and I can&#39;t sense life from any of the buildings.</p><hr><p>On the other hand, I feel a contradictory heat under the road as if there&#39;s a whirlpool of something black.</p><p>...Has something happened to the town in the few days I was held at Illya&#39;s place?</p><p>It feels like ill omens are everywhere.</p><hr><p>&quot;...It&#39;s not just me.&quot;</p><p>I look up at the mountain in the distance.</p><p>The Ryuudou Temple which is far away from the city just looks like a black lump from here.</p><p>It&#39;s just that...</p><p>It seems like it&#39;s throbbing along with the night wind.</p><hr><p>I cross the dark river and walk to Shinto.</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015That&#39;s right.

Um, I had something I wanted to ask you.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I know. I will not turn anyone away even if they come at odd hours.&quot;</p><p>So saying, Kotomine opens the door to the back of the chapel.</p><hr><p>&quot;Follow me. I&#39;m sure it has to do with the Holy Grail War. I cannot have us talk about such bloody subjects here.&quot;</p><p>Kotomine disappears into the back without waiting for my reply.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015!&quot;</p><p>I&#39;ve come this far, so I can&#39;t go back empty-handed.</p><p>I renew my determination not to be intimidated by Kotomine and follow him.</p><hr><p>&quot;Wow\u2015\u2015the outside was brilliant, but the inside is exquisite as well...&quot;</p><p>Is this a courtyard?</p><p>There&#39;s a park and passageway that seems too elegant for Kotomine to live in alone.</p><hr><p>&quot;What are you doing? Come here if you have something to talk about.&quot;</p><p>The priest turns yet another corner.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Damn, he really doesn&#39;t wait.&quot;</p><p>I follow him, complaining.</p><p>The church is like a small maze, so I have to follow him obediently.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>It&#39;s a modest room made of stone.</p><p>This inelegant room seems to be Kotomine&#39;s.</p><hr><p>&quot;I am unfortunately out of alcohol. I have nothing to welcome you with, but forgive me.&quot;</p><p>Kotomine says so while sitting down.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>...Is this the faint smell of wine?</p><p>He must really like it if the smell is lingering in this room.</p><hr><p>&quot;What? Did you not have something to talk to me about? It is bothersome if you just stand there dumbfounded.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I-I&#39;m not dumbfounded! I was just surprised by this room, and I&#39;ll go home right away once I&#39;m done with my business...!&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Good. I do not have enough leisure time to socialize with children either.</p><p>Keep your questions concise.&quot;</p><p>&quot;...!&quot;</p><p>...As expected, I hate this guy.</p><p>It feels like he can read my mind, and I feel intimidated when I talk to him.</p><hr><p>&quot;So, what is it that you want to talk about, Emiya Shirou? I believe I have already told you everything I can.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...Don&#39;t lie. You must have known about it.</p><p>My father was Saber&#39;s Master and he destroyed the Holy Grail. You&#39;re the supervisor that manages the Holy Grail, so you must...!&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh. Did Saber say that?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Um... yeah, I heard that&#39;s how the previous Holy Grail War ended.&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>The priest sinks into silence as if pondering.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Hm. It is unusual for a Servant to retain their previous memories. Maybe Saber is a failure or Saber herself is abnormal.</p><p>Either way, you cannot claim she is a normal Servant.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Heroic spirits do not retain memories.[l]</p><p>There would be contradictions if they did since they are summoned into many ages: the past, present, and future.</p><p>All they have are memories from when they were alive. Anything that happens to them after they become a heroic spirit should not remain in their memory\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><hr><p>The priest ponders as he must not assent to the fact.</p><p>...I see.</p><p>He doesn&#39;t know that Saber isn&#39;t a complete heroic spirit yet, so he&#39;s having trouble understanding.</p><hr><p>&quot;No, that&#39;s wrong. It seems that Saber&#39;s circumstances are different from the other Servants&#39;.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Different circumstances? ...I see, so that must be why you came here. All right, go ahead.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>I don&#39;t like his haughty attitude, but this is no time to oppose him.</p><p>I don&#39;t like it, but this priest might give me some answers.</p><hr><p>&quot;It seems Saber isn&#39;t dead yet.</p><p>She still hasn&#39;t completed the contract to become a heroic spirit. Something like, she wished for the Holy Grail on the verge of her death and she agreed to become a heroic spirit as a price for obtaining it.</p><p>So she isn&#39;t dead yet. She won&#39;t die until she obtains the Holy Grail, and she said she&#39;ll become a complete Servant once she does so.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Not dead... then that must mean Saber is still in the cycle of rebirth. So she is not removed from the concept of time like other heroic spirits?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Right, I think that&#39;s it. Tohsaka said Saber&#39;s frozen in time by herself.&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015I see. So rather than disappearing after she accomplishes something, she continues to be summoned as a heroic spirit until she obtains the Holy Grail.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;But the Holy Grail has not yet been obtained, so she returns to her deathbed every time she fails. And she has been summoned into this time as well, bearing all her previous memories.</p><p>\u2015\u2015Ha. Obtaining the Holy Grail in order to die... I do not understand heroes.</p><p>And even if she does obtain it, all that is left for her is to be summoned as a Servant.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...That&#39;s right. Even if she does obtain the Holy Grail and gets her wish granted\u2015\u2015she&#39;ll just become like the other Servants, right?</p><p>...I don&#39;t like that. Anyways, what are Servants? They say it&#39;s making heroes your familiars, but can that even be possible for a contradictory hero like Saber?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;I do not understand the system.</p><p>...Eternal continuation of the soul. The Servant system is constructed by imitating that secret process. Only the deviser would know about this.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...? \u2015\u2015Eternal continuation of the soul...?&quot;</p><p>&quot;No, that is just the past.</p><p>It has nothing to do with this matter, so forget about it.</p><hr><p>&quot;So, Emiya Shirou.</p><p>You are saying that you want her to stop being a Servant, correct?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>Did he guess right?</p><p>I certainly think Saber&#39;s situation is strange.</p><p>It&#39;s fine that she wants to obtain the Holy Grail.</p><p>But all that awaits is her elimination.</p><hr><p>If a king other than King Arthur is chosen and King Arthur is no more...</p><p>I think it&#39;s wrong for her to be summoned as the hero King Arthur after that.</p><p>So\u2015\u2015if she can stop being a Servant and live as a normal human being\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>&quot;That is impossible.</p><p>Dead people will not come back to life. Even if her time is stopped, Saber is already dead for us.</p><p>The power of the Holy Grail summons her into this time because she accepted the price of becoming a heroic spirit.</p><p>If she does not seek the Holy Grail, she will not be summoned as a Servant. And as long as she seeks the Holy Grail, she will become a complete Servant sooner or later.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...Even if she fails this time, she has infinite chances.</p><p>Since Saber is still in the loop of time, she cannot be in two chances to obtain the Holy Grail at once, and she cannot redo a chance she has already failed.</p><p>She will fail a chance she has already failed, no matter how many times she tries. Once she has experienced the result, she will not be able to change it.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;But still, it should only be a matter of time before she obtains the Holy Grail. This is not the only opportunity for her.</p><p>Trials to obtain the Holy Grail exist in all ages.</p><p>If she continues to challenge each one, she will obtain the Holy Grail.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...From the beginning, she is being summoned as a heroic spirit because she obtains the Holy Grail as a result.</p><p>From the moment she appeared in front of you, there was no way to stop her from becoming a Servant.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>...I thought so.</p><p>As long as Saber seeks the Holy Grail, there&#39;s no way to stop her from being a Servant.</p><p>After all, she&#39;ll continue like this unless Saber herself decides to use the Holy Grail for her own sake.</p><hr><p>Even if this Holy Grail War ends and there&#39;s no need to fight any more.</p><p>She will go on to the next chance to obtain the Holy Grail if she cannot obtain it this time.</p><p>Once she obtains it, she&#39;ll become this heroic spirit thing and be sent out to many ages\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>&quot;...Then, she&#39;ll continue to be a Servant whether she obtains the Holy Grail or not?&quot;</p><p>&quot;No, that is not the case. If the Holy Grail is truly omnipotent, it will be able to save Saber.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Huh\u2015\u2015?</p><p>But you just said that was impossible\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Yes, it is impossible to stop Saber from becoming a Servant.</p><p>But your wish is for her to stay in this world, is it not?</p><p>Then it is not that difficult.</p><p>You are able to keep her here as a human even after the Holy Grail War ends. Although, she will return once she dies.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015How do I do that?&quot;</p><p>&quot;The heroic spirits and Servants are spurious.</p><p>Normally, what is summoned as a heroic spirit does not have a mind.</p><p>It is summoned as a tool to meet an objective and disappears.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;But Servants are different.</p><p>They are the true body summoned by the Holy Grail.</p><p>So they can live as humans just by keeping them in this world.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;You can do such a thing?</p><p>Saber said she disappeared when the Holy Grail was destroyed. Isn&#39;t it true that Servants can&#39;t stay if the Holy Grail is gone?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Of course. The Holy Grail merely summons these Servants, and it is the role of the Master to maintain them after that.</p><p>But that is possible only because the Holy Grail is aiding the Master. The magical energy of a magus is not enough to maintain a Servant. If one does not have a donor called the Holy Grail, their Servant will disappear.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...I thought so. Then...&quot;</p><p>&quot;No. If you do not have enough, all you need do is compensate for that.</p><p>For Servants, furnishing magical energy is only an act of compensation. It is their true nature to consume souls. If their existence starts to fade, it can be replenished using other souls.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Wha\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>Does that mean attacking random people like Shinji did?</p><hr><p>&quot;Don&#39;t be ridiculous! I can&#39;t do such a thing...!</p><p>First of all, Saber wouldn&#39;t want to stay if she had to go that far...!&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;I see. Then you would have to use the contents of the Holy Grail. \u2015\u2015It is simple. If you want Saber to live as a human being, have her consume the Holy Grail.&quot;</p><hr><p>He must have predicted my response.</p><p>The priest&#39;s expression tells me that he was waiting to reach this conclusion from the beginning.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015You mean, have the Holy Grail grant my wish?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;No. It has nothing to do with your wish. It is the contents of the Holy Grail itself.</p><p>Did you not hear from Rin? Servants are able to start a second life by drinking the water of the Holy Grail?</p><p>That only means they have become a familiar summoned in this age. Their bodies will still be that of a Servant, but they will be able to stay in this world as long as their Master is alive.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015But that means...&quot;</p><p>That hasn&#39;t solved anything.</p><p>Even if she can stay in this world, it&#39;s meaningless if she&#39;s still a Servant.</p><p>She can&#39;t exist without magical energy from her Master, and even if she stays in this world like that, she returns to that hill after she dies.</p><hr><p>...And Saber wouldn&#39;t do it.</p><p>She isn&#39;t interested in a second life, and she&#39;s said she&#39;s going to use the Holy Grail for another purpose.</p><p>Oh, but first of all\u2015\u2015the key to everything is the Holy Grail... Does it mean it still exists in this world?</p><hr><p>&quot;...I get it. That just means I have to obtain the Holy Grail, right? But does the Holy Grail still exist? If my father destroyed it, then....&quot;</p><p>&quot;Then what?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...If there&#39;s no Holy Grail, there&#39;s no reason to fight. This ridiculous fight is pointless.&quot;</p><p>&quot;You have no reason to fight, huh? Why do you say that now?</p><p>\u2015\u2015You had no reason to fight from the very beginning.&quot;</p><p>As he says so.</p><p>Time freezes.</p><hr><p>\u2015\u2015No reason to fight.</p><p>That&#39;s what this priest told me before.</p><p>At that time\u2015\u2015I just became a Master and I didn&#39;t have much of a reason to fight.</p><p>That&#39;s why I ignored it, and I thought it was just sarcasm.</p><hr><p>But what about now?</p><p>I have a reason to fight. If there is a Holy Grail, I want to end this fight and give it to Saber.</p><hr><p>I have a reason to fight.</p><p>I have a reason to fight.</p><p>So why do his words make my body shake so much that I want to vomit\u2015\u2015?</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015We&#39;ll forget about that for now. Now is not the time to open up your wounds.&quot;</p><p>...I hear a voice.</p><p>A voice I don&#39;t want to hear.</p><p>But it makes my mysterious nausea stop.</p><hr><p>&quot;There is a Holy Grail. The Holy Grail is only a vessel anyways.</p><p>If it goes away, the preparer will prepare another one.&quot;</p><p>&quot;...? ...The preparer will prepare another one? ..... Is the Holy Grail that easy to make?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Just making the vessel is.</p><p>Of course, one needs an appropriate skill, but the Holy Grail War could not come to be without such a skill.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...First of all, the Holy Grail is not a cup that received the blood of God. It was based on a magical pot passed down from ancient times.</p><p>You should know about it if you are a magus.</p><p>Utopia. It means &#39;an unreachable place&#39; in Greek. It is said that an omnipotent vessel exists there.</p><p>And there were magi who tried to reproduce this omnipotent vessel.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;They were the three families: Einzbern, Makiri, and Tohsaka.</p><p>They spent many generations researching the ritual to reproduce the omnipotent vessel and completed it two hundred years ago.</p><p>That was the first Holy Grail War\u2015\u2015the ritual that summoned the omnipotent vessel to the artificial Holy Grail to open up the path.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Einzbern...? You mean, Illya&#39;s family?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Yes. The Einzberns specialized in &#39;the golden rule of the line&#39;. They were the best suited to make an imitation of the Holy Grail.</p><p>But they cannot summon the Holy Grail with just that.</p><p>They need a suitable land and a strong curse.</p><p>The ones who provided these were the Tohsaka and the Makiri.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;At that time, the Church and the magecraft Association were in the middle of a bloody war. A far eastern land was chosen as the place for the ritual.</p><p>Einzbern must have invited Tohsaka in because Tohsaka was in charge of the land around here and their master was a master of summoning.</p><p>For Einzbern, the summoning of the Holy Grail would be impossible without the help of Tohsaka.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;But betrayal could easily occur with two families involved.</p><p>They must have thought three should be involved as they also brought in the Makiri family.&quot;</p><p>The Makiris are a family with history as well.</p><p>They were the family most skilled with familiars. It was they that came up with the Command Spell to bind the Servants.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...And they worked together to summon the Holy Grail, but when they succeeded, what came after was bloody killing.</p><p>The first summoning of the Holy Grail ended while they were busy killing each other.</p><p>As generations passed, they made rules called the Holy Grail War and went back to cooperating, at least in form.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Tohsaka provided this land and the system to model the Servants, and Makiri provided the Command Spell to bind these Servants.</p><p>And Einzbern supplies the vessel for the Holy Grail to dwell in.</p><p>That is the cooperation they decided on.&quot;</p><hr><p>The priest continues happily as if something pleases him.</p><p>But, I see... they say the Holy Grail War is a ritual, but Illya&#39;s family was the original proposer.</p><hr><p>&quot;So, that is it. It was the Einzberns that prepared the Holy Grail.</p><p>As they were betrayed by Kiritsugu last time, they have thrown in their greatest trump card. The daughter of Einzbern probably holds the Holy Grail.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015?&quot;</p><p>Illya has the Holy Grail...?</p><p>...That&#39;s weird. I don&#39;t think she had anything with her....</p><hr><p>&quot;Well, are you happy now? I do not know what troubles you.</p><p>But the only way to solve it is to use the Holy Grail. Now that you know that, go home.</p><p>The battle is not yet over. You are crazy to be walking about without having Saber by your side.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;That&#39;s none of your business. I know there&#39;s still Lancer&#39;s Master\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>Hold on.</p><p>There&#39;s one more thing I need to ask him.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015Kotomine. Servants will disappear once the Holy Grail disappears.</p><p>That&#39;s what you said, right?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes. Do you have a problem with that?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I do. I don&#39;t know who it is, but there is an eighth Servant. According to Saber, he has remained in this world since the previous war.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Wha\u2015\u2015t?&quot;</p><p>It must have been a surprise.</p><p>Kotomine opens his eyes and mutters in disbelief.</p><hr><p>&quot;What&#39;s going on? I came here since I thought you would know.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...So, you are saying there is a Servant that did not disappear?</p><p>It is not that strange. The previous war ended with Saber destroying the Holy Grail.</p><p>So in other words, there was still another Servant left.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Saber disappeared by her own [wr\u0361p text=&quot;will,&quot;]will, but if a Servant wished to stay, then the answer is simple.</p><p>He must have acquired the magical energy he needed by feeding on souls and lived these past ten years.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015That&#39;s ridiculous. His presence was absurd.</p><p>You or my father certainly would&#39;ve noticed if that thing had been around for ten years.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...I know. Someone was probably hiding him. The Servant&#39;s Master, or....&quot;</p><p>&quot;Or what?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;A magus who knew about the Holy Grail War but did not become a Master.</p><p>I know one such person, but that is impossible as well. The old Makiri has already retired.&quot;</p><p>Kotomine must be satisfied, as he gets up from the sofa.</p><hr><p>&quot;This is it. I cannot let this be as a supervisor.</p><p>I shall investigate that Servant. You should concentrate on your remaining battle with Lancer.&quot;</p><p>Kotomine walks to the exit as if there&#39;s nothing more to talk about.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>...Well, there&#39;s certainly nothing more to be gained from being here.</p><p>I leave the dark room and follow Kotomine, who leads me to the exit silently.</p><hr><p>I leave the church.</p><p>Behind me,</p><p>&quot;Saber will die once she obtains the Holy Grail. You know what that means, don&#39;t you, Emiya Shirou?&quot;</p><p>The priest asks as if confirming it.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>The priest is looking down at me from the doorway.</p><hr><p>...Saber will die if she obtains the Holy Grail.</p><p>I already know that.</p><p>Saber&#39;s goal is to obtain the Holy Grail, and she doesn&#39;t want the Holy Grail&#39;s power.</p><p>Once she obtains the Holy Grail, nothing will bind her.</p><p>She will be freed from her situation, frozen on the verge of death, and\u2015\u2015she will die an unrewarded death on that hill.</p><hr><p>&quot;What&#39;s wrong? You&#39;re not the type to give that kind of a warning, are you?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;I was just happy that you are supporting Saber. I am warning you out of kindness.</p><p>Saber will disappear once she obtains the Holy Grail.</p><p>If you wish to be with her, you should give up the Holy Grail.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...That&#39;s even more of a contradiction. I won&#39;t be able to keep Saber here if I don&#39;t have the Holy Grail.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;You do not need to rely on the Holy Grail. It&#39;s just like that Servant we were talking about. If you want to keep Saber, all you need to do is feed her souls.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015Don&#39;t play with me. I can&#39;t do that.&quot;</p><p>I glare at the priest.</p><p>&quot;I see. That is too bad.&quot;</p><p>He must not even care about my glare as the priest is laughing.</p><hr><p>&quot;Then your only hope is the contents of the Holy Grail.</p><p>Even if your Servant does not wish it, all you have to do is keep one Command Spell. Your wish will be granted that way.&quot;</p><hr><p>\u2015\u2015The priest is saying...</p><p>That it doesn&#39;t matter even if Saber doesn&#39;t want it.</p><p>That if I am a Master, I can just force Saber to drink using the power of the Command Spell.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh, did I offend you? Don&#39;t glare at me so much. That was just a warning.</p><p>Well, you could also respect Saber&#39;s choice. It is her life. We have no right to say anything about it.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;I shall investigate that Servant tomorrow.</p><p>Come here again if you feel like it.&quot;</p><p>The door to the church closes.</p><p>Looking up at the church, I grit my teeth telling myself that I will never come here again.</p><hr><h2 id="scene-12" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#scene-12" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Scene 12</h2><p>The breakfast table is the same as always.</p><p>Saber and Tohsaka must be adaptable as they already seem to be used to Illya&#39;s presence.</p><hr><p>&quot;So what are you going to do, Shirou?</p><p>There are three Masters left. It&#39;s not like the Holy Grail War can go on forever, so you should start acting. And it&#39;s pretty pitiful to always give others the initiative.&quot;</p><hr><p>Tohsaka is right.</p><p>My body is fine and Saber is healed.</p><p>Yesterday should be the last day of rest.</p><hr><p>&quot;...You&#39;re right. But even if we are to act, it&#39;ll be in evening. We&#39;ll do the same things as always while the sun&#39;s up.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Seriously? ...Well, I guess it doesn&#39;t do any good to walk around randomly when you don&#39;t know anything about your opponents. Then, you&#39;re going to get beaten up by Saber again?&quot;</p><hr><p>Training with Saber.</p><p>That&#39;s the usual task and it&#39;s natural for a Master to prepare for battle.</p><hr><p>&quot;Rin. We are training. That comment sounded unpleasant.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Well\u2015\u2015yeah. I&#39;ll get beaten up by Saber in the morning.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...Shirou. You put me in a difficult position if you say that as well.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Huh\u2015\u2015? Sorry, Saber. I wasn&#39;t listening.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;I am speaking of how rudely Rin talks.</p><p>...Honestly, what is going on, Shirou? You do not seem well today. Breakfast is a bit smaller than usual as well. Were you in the shed until late last night?&quot;</p><hr><p>She asks, but Saber&#39;s words aren&#39;t criticizing.</p><p>I can feel that Saber believes in me.</p><p>That&#39;s why it&#39;s even harder to look at her now.</p><p>If I do, the image of that hill pops into my head.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Huh. Fine, I shall drive some energy into you later. So we will train in the dojo today as well. Is that the plan, Shirou?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yeah, please. How about you, Illya?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Me? I&#39;ll do the same as yesterday. I don&#39;t like getting wet in the rain, so I don&#39;t wanna go outside.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;I see. That&#39;s a big help. I want you to stay in the house as much as possible. Going outside is too dangerous.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yeah. I&#39;ll consider staying with you if you cook boxed lunches like you did yesterday.&quot;</p><hr><p>...Hmm.</p><p>It seems Illya liked the boxed lunch yesterday.</p><p>I&#39;m a bit embarrassed that she&#39;s content with such a thing, but I&#39;m happy if she&#39;s happy.</p><hr><p>&quot;So I guess it&#39;ll be the same as yesterday.</p><p>I have something to research, so I&#39;ll be in my room. Come by my room in the afternoon since I need to talk with you.&quot;</p><p>&quot;...Research?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Yup. I think you&#39;ve realized, but Ryuudou Temple has been strange since yesterday.</p><p>They&#39;ve stopped the magical energy collection they&#39;ve been working so hard on, so it&#39;s only natural to assume they&#39;re doing something.</p><p>Well, it seems the Master at the Ryuudou Temple is the most troublesome one, so I&#39;ll make a familiar and try to find out what&#39;s going on inside.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Then should you not concentrate on the search? I do not think there is a need to take time off to teach Shirou.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Well, that&#39;s just how it is. Sorry, but bear with me. He seems unreliable, so I can&#39;t just leave him alone.</p><p>It&#39;s fine if he gets killed by the enemy, but if he dies because he messes up his magecraft, I&#39;ll be ashamed as his teacher.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015Yes, it is just as you say, Rin.</p><p>...There was something wrong with me. I do not know why I would have thought your lessons were not useful for Shirou.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;The reason&#39;s pretty simple, but it&#39;s best not to talk about it.</p><p>Then good luck with your morning training. He&#39;s pretty tough, so it&#39;s best to beat him to within an inch of his life.&quot;</p><hr><p>Tohsaka leaves the living room with an absurd comment.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Saber. Don&#39;t take her too seriously. She&#39;s only saying that because you&#39;ve never beaten her up.&quot;</p><hr><p>I remind her, just in case.</p><p>I don&#39;t know why Saber&#39;s so happy, but</p><hr><p>&quot;Yes, I know. I know your body better than her.&quot;</p><p>She replies like that.</p><hr><h2 id="scene-13" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#scene-13" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Scene 13</h2><p>I listen to the rain in Tohsaka&#39;s room.</p><p>Today, we performed a fake physical examination like yesterday. I just took the medicine Tohsaka prepared for me and checked the Magic Circuit throughout my body.</p><p>I guess it really is impossible to do any more here, since it&#39;ll require a more appropriate environment.</p><hr><p>...I don&#39;t care about that, but I don&#39;t want to just sit here doing nothing.</p><p>She told me not to move for a while to see the results, but I bet I can still talk.</p><hr><p>&quot;Tohsaka, may I?&quot;</p><p>I call out to her, still meditating.</p><hr><p>&quot;Hm? Fine, what is it?&quot;</p><p>&quot;It&#39;s about Saber.</p><p>Um, I don&#39;t know how I should put this, but...&quot;</p><hr><p>Saying that, I realize I haven&#39;t thought this through at all.</p><p>It&#39;s not even &#39;what can I do for Saber&#39;.</p><p>I haven&#39;t even thought about what I want to do with Saber.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Um, well, I&#39;m just wondering what she wants to do.</p><p>Come to think of it, she never did anything because she wanted to, right? So\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;You don&#39;t know what Saber&#39;s thinking about?&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015No, that&#39;s not it. I just don&#39;t understand why she&#39;s so unselfish.</p><p>...Yeah, I don&#39;t know what to do about that.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Hmm... well, you&#39;re right. The only thing she&#39;s done voluntarily is protecting you. It&#39;s only natural for a Servant to do that, but it&#39;s hard to understand when it&#39;s so thorough.</p><p>But that doesn&#39;t mean she&#39;s totally unselfish.</p><p>Because Saber is protecting you for her own objectives.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015Oh.&quot;</p><p>That&#39;s right. I forgot about the reason she became a Servant.</p><hr><p>&quot;...I see. Saber&#39;s goal is to obtain the Holy Grail. So it&#39;s not like she has no objectives.&quot;</p><hr><p>And that Holy Grail will grant the wishes of its possessor.</p><p>So Saber at least has a &#39;wish&#39; she wants granted.</p><p>I don&#39;t know what it is, but it&#39;s a wish she wants granted even if it means becoming a Servant.</p><p>Surely the &quot;wish&quot; must be to save herself.</p><hr><p>Yeah, for example.</p><p>She&#39;s here in this time, so she can stay here and live a second life with the power of the Holy Grail.</p><p>No, rather, she has to go that far to make up for her sad end\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh\u2015\u2015then this is all so easy!&quot;</p><p>&quot;...? You&#39;re weird, suddenly getting all energetic. Was the conversation that exciting?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Yeah, it gave me energy. Yeah, she wouldn&#39;t fight so hard unless it was for that.</p><p>Because Saber has to fight for her own wishes!&quot;</p><hr><p>I nod to myself.</p><p>Tohsaka must have been shocked by my reaction.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015Emiya-kun. I&#39;m sorry to interrupt while you&#39;re so happy, but you&#39;re wrong. Saber wouldn&#39;t fight for herself.</p><hr><p>&quot;You know that too, right? Saber isn&#39;t like that. She doesn&#39;t seek the Holy Grail for her own benefit.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;W-What are you basing...&quot;</p><p>...That on... I can&#39;t finish.</p><p>...That&#39;s right.</p><p>Her last moment was a lonely one because she had no wishes for herself.</p><p>So Saber cannot be seeking her own salvation.</p><hr><p>&quot;...!&quot;</p><p>But still.</p><p>I wanted to think that, so I distorted her personality for a moment.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>&quot;......&quot;</p><p>The conversation stops.</p><p>...As soon as I start to think that the heavy silence will continue...</p><hr><p>&quot;It&#39;s boring, but Archer said the same things as you.&quot;</p><p>&quot;...Huh? Archer... you mean, that Archer?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Yeah. I asked him what his wish was too.</p><p>What do you think he said?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Eh... uh, it&#39;s no good asking me that.&quot;</p><p>I don&#39;t know anything about him.</p><p>As Archer said that we&#39;d eventually be enemies, he made no effort to talk to me or Saber.</p><p>...But still.</p><p>He was sarcastic a lot, but I know he wouldn&#39;t have a stupid objective.</p><hr><p>&quot;You&#39;ll laugh when you hear this. When I asked him what his wish was, he said this.</p><p>&#39;Hmm. How about world peace?&#39;</p><p>I just burst out laughing.</p><p>Then he got timid and said, &#39;I knew you would laugh. Well, there is no meaning in salvation by the deeds of others. Let&#39;s just call this a funny story.&#39;&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...I just thought, he became a heroic spirit and got summoned by someone like me because that&#39;s the way he is.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>...I see.</p><p>He didn&#39;t look like it, but he was a fine knight.</p><hr><p>&quot;But don&#39;t get me wrong. If the Holy Grail will truly grant any wish, permanent world peace is the worst wish ever.</p><p>It means there&#39;s nothing, right? A world without conflict is dead. If things aren&#39;t moving, all they do is rot.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...Hmm. Did you say that to Archer as well?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I did. And he said, &#39;That is how the wise think.</p><p>I feel the same way, but I am still chasing a foolish dream.&#39;&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Well, I asked him if he had any other wishes, and he said something like &#39;I do, but it is not a wish to use the Holy Grail on. I shall let you grant your wish in my place&#39;</p><p>He was so snobbish, right? I bet he was a skirt chaser when he was alive.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Hm. I didn&#39;t get that impression of him. So, what about it?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Nothing. I just meant that there are all different kinds of Servants.&quot;</p><hr><p>Oh, I see.</p><p>...Well, I think it&#39;s a good reference, so it did help me out a bit.</p><hr><p>&quot;Well then, now it&#39;s my turn.</p><p>I&#39;m going to talk about Saber as well, though.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...? Oh yeah, you were saying this morning that you wanted to talk to me about something.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Yeah. It&#39;s nothing big, but I&#39;m just wondering about it.</p><p>Do you know the legend of King Arthur?&quot;</p><p>\u2015\u2015The legend of King Arthur.</p><p>I&#39;ve had it forced upon me more than enough in the past few days.</p><hr><p>&quot;I know what most people do. ...Well, I didn&#39;t know that King Arthur was actually a girl.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Yeah, but sex doesn&#39;t matter here.</p><p>Even if King Arthur was a girl, it makes no difference to the legend. If King Arthur hid that fact from everyone around her, she would be treated as a man even if she wasn&#39;t one.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Fortunately, King Arthur had a magus called Merlin. He was a crossbreed with an Incubus, so it must have been a piece of cake for him to disguise King Arthur&#39;s sex or to arrange for a child that should never have been born.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...I bet. So?&quot;</p><p>&quot;What concerns me is the discrepancy between the legend and Saber.</p><p>Emiya-kun. Do you know what Excalibur is?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Why ask now? Excalibur is the symbol of King Arthur. It&#39;s a great sword, a gift from the fairies, that can cut through anything.&quot;</p><p>&quot;That&#39;s what I thought.&quot;</p><p>For some reason, Tohsaka acts like she&#39;s won.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Hm. Did I say something strange?&quot;</p><p>&quot;You did. And that means you made the same mistake as King Arthur. If Merlin was here, he&#39;d yell at you for being foolish.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Why?</p><p>...Um, the sword in the stone wasn&#39;t Excalibur, right? That sword broke. He later received a sword from the lady of the lake and that was Excalibur, right?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Yup. When King Arthur received Excalibur, Merlin asked this question.</p><p>&#39;Your highness. Which do you like better?</p><p>The sword or the sheath?&#39;&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;King Arthur answers without hesitation that he likes the sword, but Merlin scolds him.</p><p>&#39;Please make no mistake here. The sword slashes the enemy, but the sheath protects you. As long as you have the sheath on you, you will spill no blood and take no wounds. You should truly value the sheath, not the sword.&#39;&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;......&quot;</p><p>Tohsaka imitates King Arthur and Merlin skillfully.</p><hr><p>&quot;Hmm, you&#39;re pretty into this.</p><p>\u2015\u2015So, what are you trying to say?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Y-You don&#39;t understand when I&#39;ve told you this much!? In other words, King Arthur is immortal! Excalibur is a perfect Noble Phantasm, both in offense and defense.</p><p>So really, Saber should heal right away even if she gets hurt!&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...Tohsaka. Saber&#39;s wounds have all been healing.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...That&#39;s true, but... it seems like her healing comes from using a great amount of magical energy... anyways, it doesn&#39;t seem to match the sheath of Excalibur in the legend.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015I see. Well, if you say so....</p><p>Then, I have a question.</p><p>You say King Arthur is immortal. So then, how did he die? The legend ends with King Arthur&#39;s death, right?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Huh?&quot;</p><p>Tohsaka opens her mouth, dumbfounded.</p><p>After freezing for a few seconds, she grits her teeth and looks away.</p><hr><p>&quot;...That&#39;s right... the sheath of Excalibur was stolen....&quot;</p><p>Yeah, that&#39;s a simple mistake.</p><p>I forgot about it too, but the fall of King Arthur started when he lost the sheath he should never have lost.</p><hr><p>&quot;So. Are you convinced now, Tohsaka?&quot;</p><p>&quot;...Yeah. You can laugh at me if you want.&quot;</p><hr><p>She&#39;s lying.</p><p>I can tell she intends to axe kick me if I laugh.</p><hr><p>&quot;It&#39;s fine if you understand. But why were you worried about it? It should be no concern of yours whether Saber can get hurt or not.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;S-Shut up! I just lost myself thinking she&#39;d be invincible if that was the case.</p><p>Even I make mistakes once in a while.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;......&quot;</p><p>...This is hard.</p><p>Would it be good for her if I correct her and point out that she makes mistakes often, not just once in a while?</p><hr><h2 id="scene-14" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#scene-14" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Scene 14</h2><p>I cross the moonlit bridge.</p><p>This is the place where I walked with Saber.</p><p>At that time, I was just looking at the scenery, not thinking about anything.</p><hr><p>&#39;Saber will die if she obtains the Holy Grail.</p><p>You know what that means, Emiya Shirou\u2015\u2015&#39;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015!&quot;</p><p>I know.</p><p>I know without him telling me.</p><p>...But why is everything so complicated?</p><p>Saber must not obtain the Holy Grail.</p><p>But it is the only thing that can save her.</p><hr><p>&#39;If you wish to be with her, you should give up the Holy Grail.</p><p>If you want to keep Saber, all you need to do is feed her souls\u2015\u2015&#39;</p><hr><p>...I can&#39;t do that.</p><p>Even if I accepted that, Saber wouldn&#39;t.</p><p>She would rather disappear than do such things.</p><p>She would disappear and repeat this kind of war?</p><hr><p>&#39;Then, keep one Command Spell.</p><p>\u2015\u2015That way, your wish shall be granted.&#39;</p><hr><p>&quot;...! Damn, shut up, you shitty priest...!&quot;</p><p>I stop and punch at the rails as if shaking off the Command Spell.</p><p>A hard steel sound echoes through the night.</p><p>...That&#39;s the only sound around here.</p><p>There&#39;re no people nor cars around.</p><hr><p>&quot;Damn... why am I even thinking about it?&quot;</p><p>I lean on the rail and spit it out.</p><p>I know I should just ignore Kotomine&#39;s opinion.</p><p>But his words had a charm that make me unable to ignore them.</p><hr><p>...What did I want to do and what was I trying to fight for?</p><p>At first, it was to end the Holy Grail War.</p><p>When did that purpose fade away and become secondary?</p><p>Was it when I was obstinate about fighting by myself?</p><p>Was it when I decided to cooperate with Saber, after I painfully realized how powerless I was?</p><hr><p>Or.</p><p>Is it from that time I made a sword for her, after that night in the ruins?</p><hr><p>\u2015\u2015I&#39;m just trying to deceive myself with all that.</p><p>I don&#39;t even need to think about it.</p><p>Back then.</p><p>When I met her in the moonlight in that shed, my mind was already made up\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>But that would have been fine.</p><p>If I hadn&#39;t found out because of the dreams, this probably would&#39;ve ended before I knew it.</p><p>But I found out.</p><p>I couldn&#39;t leave her alone and decided I didn&#39;t want to lose her.</p><hr><p>I want to stay like this.</p><p>I want to keep watching her smile\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015Ow.&quot;</p><p>The girl, watching the sunset alone on that hill of swords.</p><p>My chest hurts thinking back to it.</p><p>She never had time that was her own.</p><p>...I just don&#39;t like that.</p><hr><p>Kiritsugu said we shouldn&#39;t let girls cry.</p><p>I think a smiling face is much better than a crying one.</p><p>That&#39;s why I was irritated when Saber wasn&#39;t smiling.</p><p>But when I told her to smile.</p><p>She said that it was better if she saw me smiling.</p><p>\u2015\u2015That&#39;s...</p><p>It&#39;s like seeing stars through a telescope that you can never reach.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Dammit.&quot;</p><p>I look up at the night sky.</p><p>Looking up at the star I can never reach,</p><p>Drip.</p><p>An unnoticed tear falls down my cheek.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015I like her.&quot;</p><p>I say so to no one.</p><p>However dull I am, I have to admit it.</p><p>There&#39;s nothing I can do about it.</p><p>I like her so much that I can cry for no reason.</p><hr><p>&quot;Welcome back. You were pretty late.&quot;</p><p>\u2015\u2015And then.</p><p>Tohsaka is standing in the doorway.</p><hr><p>&quot;T-Tohsaka...? Why are you\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>&quot;Let&#39;s talk inside. Come in, you seem tired.&quot;</p><p>She takes my arm without asking me and starts to walk...</p><p>And takes me to her room.</p><hr><p>&quot;Here&#39;s some tea. It must&#39;ve been cold outside.&quot;</p><p>She says so rather bluntly, but she&#39;s thoughtful.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Yeah, thanks.&quot;</p><p>Honestly, I appreciate the hot tea.</p><p>It&#39;s about an hour to the neighboring town.</p><p>Since I walked slowly, my body is freezing cold.</p><hr><p>&quot;So, did you go to Kirei&#39;s place?&quot;</p><p>She asks me directly.</p><p>...I see. So Tohsaka knew all along.</p><p>But she didn&#39;t even stop me, just waited for me to come home, and prepared me some tea.</p><hr><p>...I&#39;ve made up my mind, and I appreciate Tohsaka&#39;s thoughtfulness.</p><p>That must be why.</p><p>&quot;Yeah, I did. I had something I wanted to ask him.&quot;</p><p>I reply honestly, not hiding anything.</p><hr><p>&quot;I see. I won&#39;t ask what you went to do. That&#39;s fine with you, right?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yeah. It wasn&#39;t anything too useful either.</p><p>I just confirmed the situation.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;I see. But I&#39;m surprised that Saber isn&#39;t a complete Servant yet. It&#39;s like a bad joke that the strongest Servant is the least complete.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yeah. Saber shouldn&#39;t have become a Servant.&quot;</p><p>I nod.</p><hr><p>&quot;That&#39;s a surprise. Maybe you and Archer could&#39;ve gotten along. He said the same thing you did.&quot;</p><p>&quot;...Eh? Archer, you mean...?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Yeah. Archer said he regrets it, so he doesn&#39;t want Saber to experience the same thing.&quot;</p><p>&quot;...? Why would he worry about Saber?</p><p>Didn&#39;t he hate her?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;That&#39;s true. But I think he might have been a knight with some connection to Saber.</p><p>He was obviously going easy when he first fought Saber, right? I suspected it after that.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Really? But it didn&#39;t seem like Saber recognized him.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Is that so? But Saber was the king, right?</p><p>So she can&#39;t have known all her people, and there&#39;s also the possibility that she&#39;s forgotten him.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...Hey now. We&#39;ll never get anywhere if you start saying things like that. If she sees him and doesn&#39;t recognize him, I think that means she doesn&#39;t know him.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;That might not be true. According to the legend, there were many knights that got chased out of Camelot. He might have been one of them.</p><p>If he was hiding his identity because of Saber, that would make sense.&quot;</p><hr><p>Tohsaka&#39;s actively talking to me.</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>Is she trying to care for me?</p><p>I don&#39;t think it&#39;s having much effect, but she&#39;s a nice girl.</p><p>She&#39;s usually merciless, but she tries to help people when they&#39;re weakened.</p><hr><p>...And so, we drink tea together for a while.</p><p>She must have run out of patience as she looks at me seriously.</p><hr><p>&quot;So. What do you want to do, Shirou?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Hm. I&#39;ll go on a date tomorrow.&quot;</p><p>I can&#39;t think of anything else, and I already decided so on my way home.</p><p>...And then.</p><hr><p>Where did that solemn atmosphere go? After making a really rude face, Tohsaka...</p><p>&quot;Ha\u2015\u2015Haha, ahahahahahahahaha!&quot;</p><p>...Bursts into laughter.</p><hr><p>&quot;Heehee, hold on, I-I wasn&#39;t ready for that, aha, ahahaha! That&#39;s great, that&#39;s so amazingly selfish, Shirou!&quot;</p><p>...Damn! Now that I think about it calmly, I should have known this was going to happen. I&#39;m such an idiot...!</p><hr><p>&quot;S-Shut up! What&#39;s wrong with being selfish? I know this isn&#39;t the right time, but I won&#39;t let you interfere!&quot;</p><p>&quot;N-No, no. Shirou, Shirou, you&#39;re too funny, hahahaha.&quot;</p><p>Tohsaka hits my back, holding her stomach.</p><hr><p>&quot;Guh...&quot;</p><p>Could this be the worst treatment I&#39;ve taken so far?</p><hr><p>&quot;Ha, haha, ha\u2015\u2015oh, I&#39;m laughing my heart out.&quot;</p><p>She tries to catch her breath.</p><p>&quot;...That&#39;s good for you. It&#39;s not funny at all for me.&quot;</p><p>I complain.</p><p>Then.</p><hr><p>&quot;Do your best on the date. I like you guys.&quot;</p><p>Tohsaka says so, her attitude completely changed.</p><hr><p>&quot;Ah... uh. Yeah, I will.&quot;</p><p>I manage to reply.</p><p>...That was a real surprise attack.</p><p>If she says that kind of a thing with that kind of an expression, all I can do is nod\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>I return to my room.</p><p>Saber is still asleep, and the mansion is quiet like nothing has happened.</p><hr><p>It was raining today, but what will the weather be like tomorrow?</p><p>Looking up at the moving clouds, I step out of character and wish for it to be sunny tomorrow.</p><hr><h2 id="scene-15" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#scene-15" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Scene 15</h2><p>.........</p><p>.........</p><p>G-Good evening, everyone!</p><p>This is the Q&amp;A session to help Shirou when he dies easily from a simple mistake, the Tiger Dojo!</p><p>Well, the cause of death this time is\u2015\u2015</p><p>Um, I guess the lesson is that you shouldn&#39;t let your guard down no matter how dominant your position is.</p><p>You&#39;re a Master, so you should control Saber&#39;s recklessness!</p><p>Huh? That&#39;s wrong. Saber&#39;s the one at fault this time, right?</p><p>Falling for Caster&#39;s trap proves that she&#39;s not concentrating.</p><p>I bet she was self-conscious around Shirou and tried to show off. But she ended up killing Shirou herself. Geez, her class has fallen.</p><p>Oh. Awawa, awawawawawa.</p><p>They say she&#39;s the most powerful, but she hasn&#39;t had that many wins. She&#39;s also small and lacking in charm as a lady.</p><p>Doesn&#39;t she seem like a gluttonous power character?</p><p>Uh, Illya-chan, stop, stop.</p><p>Saber-chan regrets this. As a samurai, it&#39;s not good to be rubbing salt into a wound.</p><p>Hm. I see, Bushido is all about sympathy and no love.</p><p>...I guess it can&#39;t be helped.
