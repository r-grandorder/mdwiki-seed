True Name: Yan Qing...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I wonder what&#39;s going on with him.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I&#39;m afraid all we know right now is that he Rayshifted here.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> You&#39;re sure he came to Shinjuku?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> We were tracking his Spirit Origin up till he disappeared here.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> However, there were some, um, irregularities with the tracking data, so I don&#39;t know if we can trust it entirely.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Hassan of the Cursed Arm and Geronimo have come along to serve as your guides.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Thank you both for doing this.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> I am pleased to be here.</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong><br> Well Master, where shall we begin our search?</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> We&#39;ll never find him without a plan. I think our only option is to follow his magical energy.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I agree. And we do have tracking data that should help us with that.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The problem is that Yan Qing&#39;s trail went cold here.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Maybe he interfered with our observational equipment somehow, or maybe...</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong><br> Yes. He may have been injured or killed.</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong><br> Oh, sorry, my apologies.<br> Worry not, [\u2642 Lord /\u2640\uFE0F Lady} Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong><br> Lord Yan Qing is as tough as they come.</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong><br> What&#39;s more, I imagine he feels especially at home in an urban setting like this. He will not die easily.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> Indeed. I don&#39;t even need to read his fortune to assure you that he is alive and well.</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong><br> All right, I&#39;ll begin by searching the perimeter.</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong><br> Once I have the lay of the land,<br> we can begin a thorough investigation.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> Very well then, we&#39;ll wait here until you return.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> I would like to resolve this quickly,<br> given Master&#39;s physical limitations.</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong><br> Haha, a good point.<br> Then I will be back as soon as I can.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> See you later!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Be careful out there!</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong><br> You are too kind, Master.

And I&#39;m sorry about this, too...</p><p><strong>Yan Qing:</strong><br> ...but there&#39;s something I gotta do here,<br> and I&#39;m not leaving till it&#39;s done.</p><p><strong>A\uFF1AYan Qing (?):</strong><br> So I&#39;m afraid I can&#39;t let you bring me back!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You&#39;re using your doppelg\xE4nger power!?</p><p><strong>A\uFF1AYan Qing (?):</strong><br> You know it.</p><p><strong>A\uFF1AYan Qing (?):</strong><br> I can&#39;t let myself be caught, no matter what!<br> So you better believe I&#39;m pulling out all the stops!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> He transformed!</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong><br> Hmm, this could be a problem.<br> Now, what to do about it...</p><hr><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> It would seem he&#39;s quite desperate.<br> In that case...</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> ...the only way he&#39;ll listen to reason is if we knock some into him. Let&#39;s do this, Master.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Okay everyone, prepare for combat!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Yan Qing (?):</strong><br> Sorry, the answer&#39;s still no.<br> Later!</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> A smoke bomb...!</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong><br> He must have taken it from someone while we were fighting.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> N-now what do we do?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> He did say there was something he had to do here...</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong><br> ...We can&#39;t let him do it, whatever it may be.<br> Let&#39;s go after him, [\u2642 Lord /\u2640\uFE0F Lady} Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> Oh? Does that mean you know what Yan Qing is up to, Cursed Arm?</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong><br> I do, for it concerns me personally.</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong><br> Now, let us be on our way.<br> We may not know what that way is yet, but no matter.</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong><br> We will just have to keep looking until we find it.<br> For a Hassan, it is, as they say, business as usual.</p><p><strong>--ARROW--:</strong></p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I don&#39;t mind roaming around looking for what I have to do. That irredeemable thing I can&#39;t just wipe off my slate.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> If someone tries to stop me, I&#39;ll eliminate them.<br> After all, I know I&#39;m doing the right thing.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> To get my chance at being a good person...I&#39;ll take my revenge on him.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> Going after Yan Qing is all well and good...</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> ...but how are we going to find him when he could be anyone here?</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> Any ideas?</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong><br> Yes, actually. I snuck a cursed scent mark onto him during our battle.</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong><br> It has been passed down our clan for generations,<br> and should let me know when I&#39;m drawing near him.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> Oho, you don&#39;t say. Quite clever.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> In that case, Cursed Arm,<br> I think it&#39;s best if you lead the way.</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong><br> Is that all right with you, Master?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Absolutely!</p><hr><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong><br> ...Hmm. It&#39;s faint, but I can smell the scent nearby.</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong><br> We may have tracked him down sooner than I thought.<br> Come, this way.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> In the meantime, let&#39;s think about what Yan Qing may have meant earlier.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> What do you mean?</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> I mean the thing he said he needs to do.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> The thing he said he needs to do?</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> That&#39;s right.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> What does he hope to accomplish by coming back to Shinjuku?</p><hr><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> What do you know about this, Cursed Arm?</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong><br> ...Hmm.</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong><br> I&#39;d rather not discuss it, but under the circumstances, I suppose I can share.</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong><br> You see, Lord Yan Qing actually came to apologize to me once, back when we were still at Chaldea.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You mean, about what happened in Shinjuku?</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong><br> Indeed. You have an excellent memory, Master.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> What about?</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong><br> The incident in Shinjuku, most likely.</p><hr><p><strong>Yan Qing:</strong><br> &#39;Sup, Cursed Arm. Got a minute?</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong><br> Why, if it isn&#39;t Lord Yan Qing.<br> What brings you to my humble room?</p><p><strong>Yan Qing:</strong><br> Uh, I just wanted to say I was sorry.</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong><br> Sorry...? If you&#39;ve done something to wrong me,<br> I can&#39;t say I&#39;m aware of it.</p><p><strong>Yan Qing:</strong><br> It sounds like I did you a real disservice back in Shinjuku, so, you know.</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong><br> ...Now I see. Yes, I do recall reading about that in the Shinjuku report.</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong><br> I looked it over after I heard my name was mentioned, and there is nothing for you to apologize for.</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong><br> Spies like us are quite used to disguises and betrayal. It all comes with the territory.</p><p><strong>Yan Qing:</strong><br> Yeah, maybe. And honestly,<br> I don&#39;t even remember doing it.</p><p><strong>Yan Qing:</strong><br> But there&#39;s this little voice in my Spirit Origin that keeps nagging at me.</p><p><strong>Yan Qing:</strong><br> Says I&#39;ll never be able to move on if I don&#39;t apologize to you first.</p><p><strong>Yan Qing:</strong><br> And that, if possible...I need to go back to Shinjuku and finish what I started.</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong><br> Finish what you started...?</p><p><strong>Yan Qing:</strong><br> Yup. You know what they say...</p><p><strong>Yan Qing:</strong><br> If you commit the crime, you gotta do the time.</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong><br> ...But, have you not already done your \u201Ctime\u201D by fighting alongside Master?</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong><br> I see no reason why you need to seek further redemption in Shinjuku.</p><p><strong>Yan Qing:</strong><br> ...Yeah, true. Fair point.</p><p><strong>Yan Qing:</strong><br> Now that I think about, I feel pretty damn silly!<br> Just forget I said anything, all right?</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong><br> He never brought it up again after that,<br> so I never chose to pursue it further...</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong><br> But now that we&#39;re here, I&#39;m reminded of how empty his smile seemed back then.</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong><br> I think Lord Yan Qing is still trying to make amends.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> Amends, huh.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> However, whatever the Assassin of Shinjuku may have done here, it has nothing to do with Yan Qing.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> No, I&#39;ll go further: it would be wrong if it did. That would mean the sins we commit would pile higher and higher every time we were summoned.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> The heroes from the Age of Gods may be able to endure such a burden, but that is far too much for an ordinary person.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> That is why our actions are recorded independent of our memories.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> As a Demi-Servant myself,<br> I don&#39;t have any of his memories...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...but if I did, I agree that the mental burden of such a thing would be overwhelming.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> But, Yan Qing&#39;s...</p><hr><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong><br> ...No more talk. We&#39;ve found him.</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong><br> That Hornet over there is Lord Yan Qing.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Yan Qing!</p><hr><p><strong>Yan Qing (?):</strong><br> Aw crap, you already found me!?</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> Yan Qing.<br> Are you here to seek redemption?</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> Or perhaps, retribution for your sins?</p><p><strong>E\uFF1AYan Qing:</strong><br> ...It&#39;s not a matter of seeking it out, Geronimo.<br> I HAVE to be punished for what I did.</p><p><strong>E\uFF1AYan Qing:</strong><br> Otherwise, I won&#39;t be me anymore.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> ...My head is pounding.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> These upstanding Heroic Spirit types don&#39;t know what it&#39;s like to live with this kind of pain in your soul.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Just getting killed off isn&#39;t nearly enough.<br> I need to die in misery and agony.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Yan Qing...?</p><hr><p><strong>E\uFF1AYan Qing:</strong><br> ...Please just let me do this, Master.<br> Please... I&#39;m begging you.</p><p><strong>E\uFF1AYan Qing:</strong><br> I have to die for what I did.</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong><br> I&#39;m afraid that is a crude and contradictory way of seeing things, Yan Qing.</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong><br> You fight to take on sins that can only be paid for with your own life... That is a manner of thinking with which I am all too familiar.</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong><br> But you are woefully wet behind the ears if your only concern is wiping your regrets away, as mine once was.</p><p><strong>E\uFF1AYan Qing:</strong><br> ...!</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong><br> What would you have us do, Master?</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong><br> If you are willing to accept his sins,<br> we can return to Chaldea right now.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I don&#39;t think that&#39;s a good idea.</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong><br> ...Hehe, I see.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Let&#39;s just talk about this, okay?</p><p><strong>E\uFF1AYan Qing:</strong><br> Sorry, but I really don&#39;t have time to talk!</p><hr><p><strong>E\uFF1AYan Qing:</strong><br> ...Dammit, I shoulda known it&#39;d come to this.</p><p><strong>E\uFF1AYan Qing (?):</strong><br> Sorry, Master, but if this is how it&#39;s gonna be,<br> I&#39;m not gonna make it easy for you!</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> Hmm, I see has no small skill in multiplying himself.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Um, I think he just called in reinforcements...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Ahem.<br> At any rate, entering combat mode...now!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> He must have run off while we were fighting the other Hornets.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> Still... Hmm.<br> Are you sure about this, Cursed Arm?</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong><br> About what?</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> Are we truly doing the right thing here?</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong><br> ...Of course. That is why I came here, after all.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> What are you talking about?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Wait. You don&#39;t mean...</p><hr><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong><br> I will explain the next time we encounter Yan Qing.</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong><br> He needs to hear this just as much as you do.</p><p><strong>--ARROW--:</strong></p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> ...Where is he?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> He&#39;s not here.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> He&#39;s not anywhere.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> That can&#39;t be right.<br> He&#39;s GOTTA be here.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> He&#39;s just gotta be.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Oh man, my body&#39;s falling apart.<br> I can&#39;t maintain my Yan Qing Spirit Origin.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> The sky is muddied and dirty.<br> Even the water tastes foul.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> How does it feel to die?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I turn around, and see Death standing there waiting for me.</p><p><strong>Yan Qing:</strong><br> There you are. I knew I&#39;d find you here,<br> Hassan of the Cursed Arm.</p><p><strong>Yan Qing:</strong><br> That&#39;s right. You&#39;re the one I&#39;ve gotta apologize to. You&#39;re the one I killed.</p><p><strong>Yan Qing:</strong><br> No... That&#39;s not right. You killed me.</p><p><strong>Yan Qing:</strong><br> ...No, wait. Please, wait. My head...my memories are all a mess... I can&#39;t tell what&#39;s true or not!</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm (?):</strong><br> Enough of this.<br> It&#39;s time you accepted your fate.</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm (?):</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm (?):</strong><br> We can&#39;t ever atone for our sins.</p><p><strong>Yan Qing:</strong><br> ...That voice...<br> No, wait...</p><p><strong>Yan Qing:</strong><br> Are you me?</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm (?):</strong><br> Let me answer your question with one of my own.</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm (?):</strong><br> Who do you think you are?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Hassan wasn&#39;t Hassan...?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Yan Qing...!?</p><hr><p><strong>C\uFF1AYan Qing:</strong><br> Hey there, Master!<br> Sorry &#39;bout this!</p><p><strong>C\uFF1AYan Qing:</strong><br> I definitely meant to trick you,<br> but not like this!</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> Hmm. It would seem you are the real Yan Qing.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> And yet, your Spirit Origin is indistinguishable from this Yan Qing.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> ...That can only mean one thing.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> The other Yan Qing is a doppelg\xE4nger.</p><p><strong>A\uFF1AYan Qing (?):</strong><br> Ah...<br> A-ah...</p><p><strong>E\uFF1AYan Qing (?):</strong><br> Aaahhh!</p><p><strong>C\uFF1AYan Qing:</strong><br> Whoa, whoa, calm down, other me! Ah crap.<br> I knew it was too soon to pull back the curtains!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Is that...a Servant? No, now they&#39;re...Christine?<br> And Hassan, and Yan Qing...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> They keep transforming into all sorts of different enemies!</p><p><strong>C\uFF1AYan Qing:</strong><br> It doesn&#39;t matter who he turns into.<br> We just gotta get him to calm down, Master!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You mean beat him down.</p><p><strong>C\uFF1AYan Qing:</strong><br> You got it!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> So, basically...</p><p><strong>C\uFF1AYan Qing:</strong><br> We hit him real hard!</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> Well, that&#39;s certainly straightforward.</p><hr><p><strong>C\uFF1AYan Qing:</strong><br> All right, lost other me, it&#39;s time for us to go back where we belong.</p><p><strong>C\uFF1AYan Qing:</strong><br> There&#39;s no one left here you need to make amends to.</p><p><strong>C\uFF1AYan Qing:</strong><br> So if we don&#39;t put an end to everything here...<br> we&#39;re both gonna be left behind for good!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong><br> Khh...</p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong><br> We&#39;ve got you now, Hassan-i Sabbah.</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong><br> ...So it would seem.<br> Very well, go ahead and take my head.</p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong><br> Your head? Oh no, I don&#39;t want you dead just yet.</p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong><br> I need to copy your Spirit Origin first.<br> Otherwise it&#39;d be such a waste of material.</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong><br> ...!</p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong><br> Yep, that&#39;s right. I&#39;m gonna use your form to pull the wool over those Chaldea chumps&#39; eyes whenever they manage to get here.</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong><br> ...So, you are plotting ahead to ensure you can fully deceive your quarry. You truly are an Assassin born.</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong><br> Very well then. If that is how it is to be, I will not go down without a fight. I can do no less after being summoned here.</p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong><br> Oh? You want a piece of me?</p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong><br> What an honor, facing off with one of the biggest names in the assassin world.</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong><br> I thought I was about to die,<br> powerless to do anything...</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong><br> ...but it is exactly when one can do nothing that new options open up.</p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong><br> What...?</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong><br> ...Zabaniya!</p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong><br> Hah, nice try! But there&#39;s no way you can copy my heart and crush it before I can stop you!</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong><br> Indeed, I cannot. Which is why it is fortunate that I have no need to copy you.</p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong><br> What...!?</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong><br> Hehe... Good. It worked.</p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong><br> You crushed your own heart? Why?</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong><br> You know exactly why.</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong><br> If Chaldea comes to save this city,<br> as I trust they will...</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong><br> ...then it is my duty as a Servant to help them however I can.</p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong><br> Wha... Huh!?</p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong><br> You&#39;re freakin&#39; nuts!<br> What the hell are you thinking!?</p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong><br> You&#39;re just throwing your life away for these people without even knowing for sure they&#39;re coming!?</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong><br> Of course.</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong><br> I was summoned here as a Rogue Servant.</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong><br> It is therefore my obligation to try and save this city.</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong><br> It was my fate...nay, let&#39;s just say my duty.<br> So I have no qualms about laying down my life.</p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong><br> ...!</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong><br> With me dead, your imitation of me will be imperfect.</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong><br> ...A small stone laid upon your path,<br> but one you may well trip over.</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong><br> Farewell, savior of this city, whomever you may be.<br> Good luck!</p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong><br> D-dammit!</p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong><br> The hell was that guy&#39;s problem!?<br> The hell was wrong with him!?</p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong><br> It&#39;d be one thing if he was dying for his master,<br> but for someone he&#39;d never even seen...!?</p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong><br> How the hell could anyone go out like that!?</p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong><br> Dammit, dammit, dammit!!!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> ...</p><p>It was a shock to my whole Spirit Origin.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I might&#39;ve betrayed some of my other masters at the last moment, but I still considered myself a faithful servant.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> That&#39;s why I knew, beyond any doubt...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> ...that the sacrifice this Assassin was willing to make wasn&#39;t something just anyone could do.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> What a miserable way to go out.<br> I&#39;ve never been more jealous.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Oh God, it hurts.<br> I can feel my body tearing itself apart!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Master! My master! Why did you go throw your life away with such reckless abandon!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> You were so smart! So intelligent! Why did you die for such meaningless, insignificant glory!?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Why can&#39;t I figure out why you sacrificed yourself!?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> ...I didn&#39;t get it at all.<br> I had never been so scared in my life.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I had no idea how I should go about repaying my master for saving my life.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I couldn&#39;t think about...anything...anymore...</p><p><strong>Yan Qing:</strong><br> ...So that&#39;s how it is.<br> That \u201Cme\u201D both is and isn&#39;t me.</p><p><strong>Yan Qing:</strong><br> He&#39;s my doppelg\xE4nger.<br> A Phantom Spirit who wasn&#39;t even supposed to exist.</p><p><strong>Yan Qing:</strong><br> That&#39;s why it was so easy to track him down.</p><p><strong>Yan Qing:</strong><br> Especially since he&#39;s been haunting me.</p><p><strong>Yan Qing:</strong><br> Cursed scent mark?<br> Sorry, I was just bullshitting you.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> Does this mean...you and he did not originally share a body then?</p><p><strong>Yan Qing:</strong><br> Nah, he&#39;s pretty much just a copy of me.</p><p><strong>Yan Qing:</strong><br> I used to be the Assassin of Shinjuku, using my doppelg\xE4nger power to turn into anyone and anything.</p><p><strong>Yan Qing:</strong><br> ...But I gradually forgot who I really was,<br> and ended up losing to Master.</p><p><strong>Yan Qing:</strong><br> This guy&#39;s just the remains of that version of me, but he ended up sorta linking with the version of me that got summoned to Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Yan Qing:</strong><br> ...Yeah, that&#39;s it. We were linked. Connected.</p><p><strong>Yan Qing:</strong><br> That&#39;s why you heard I&#39;d Rayshifted here.<br> He got all mixed up.</p><p><strong>Yan Qing:</strong><br> He started thinking he was, well, me,<br> and decided to come back to Shinjuku.</p><p><strong>Yan Qing:</strong><br> That&#39;s why I couldn&#39;t forgive myself for what I&#39;d done.</p><p><strong>Yan Qing:</strong><br> Instead of a gangster who took over Shinjuku, I ended up reverting back into the chivalrous vigilante I always was.</p><p><strong>Yan Qing:</strong><br> I mean, you&#39;ve seen for yourself how surprisingly strong my sense of justice is, right?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> True, you&#39;re the most upstanding vigilante I&#39;ve ever known.</p><p><strong>Yan Qing:</strong><br> Wahahaha. Thanks for playing along, Master!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I thought you were a vigilante of darkness.</p><p><strong>Yan Qing:</strong><br> That&#39;s cool, I guess. They&#39;re both badass!</p><hr><p><strong>Yan Qing (?):</strong><br> Ahh... Ahhh... I can never atone...<br> I can never make amends...</p><p><strong>Yan Qing (?):</strong><br> I&#39;ve always survived by...piling up regret after regret... I hate that...about myself...</p><p><strong>Yan Qing:</strong><br> That&#39;s why you wanted to die,<br> and why you tried to kill us.</p><p><strong>Yan Qing:</strong><br> Because you thought trying to kill us would end with you getting killed instead. Am I wrong?</p><p><strong>Doppelg\xE4nger:</strong><br> I... I... I&#39;m everyone...and no one...</p><p><strong>Doppelg\xE4nger:</strong><br> I can be anyone at all, since I lack a core self...yet I also can&#39;t be anything, since I have neither goodwill or malice.</p><p><strong>Doppelg\xE4nger:</strong><br> I&#39;m nothing more than a hapless wraith who can only survive in the space between darkness and rumor...</p><p><strong>Doppelg\xE4nger:</strong><br> Which is why...I at least wanted to make amends...</p><p><strong>Doppelg\xE4nger:</strong><br> And yet...I didn&#39;t want it to cost me my life...</p><p><strong>Doppelg\xE4nger:</strong><br> So now...I don&#39;t know what to do...</p><p><strong>Yan Qing:</strong><br> Come with me then. Hell, that&#39;s the whole reason I&#39;m here: to invite you to join me.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> Oho. So you want to add a Phantom Spirit on top of all your other personalities?</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> Sure about that?<br> It might do some damage to your sense of self.</p><p><strong>Yan Qing:</strong><br> Nah, I&#39;ll be fine. I know who I am.<br> Isn&#39;t that right, Master?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I think you can probably handle it.</p><p><strong>Yan Qing:</strong><br> Right!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I can&#39;t say I&#39;m not concerned, but...</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> Once he has made up his mind,<br> there is no stopping him, huh.</p><hr><p><strong>Doppelg\xE4nger:</strong><br> A-are you sure? Is it really okay...<br> if I come with you?</p><p><strong>Yan Qing:</strong><br> Sure. You&#39;ll help make me stronger.</p><p><strong>Yan Qing:</strong><br> Just don&#39;t forget how you feel right now.<br> How desperately you&#39;re longing for justice.</p><p><strong>Yan Qing:</strong><br> Long as you hold onto that, you&#39;ll make a great chivalrous vigilante yet.</p><p><strong>Doppelg\xE4nger:</strong><br> A vigilante...</p><p><strong>Doppelg\xE4nger:</strong><br> People who are loyal and considerate to a fault, but with strong enough senses of morality and self to even defy a king...</p><p><strong>Doppelg\xE4nger:</strong><br> That&#39;s what I...want to be...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I&#39;ve confirmed that the doppelg\xE4nger has...not vanished, but became part of Yan Qing.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> His Spirit Origin readings are stable.</p><p><strong>Yan Qing:</strong><br> See? Told you I&#39;d be fine.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> Even so, this is quite unusual.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> You should have Da Vinci take a look at you as soon as we get back.</p><p><strong>Yan Qing:</strong><br> Yup, will do!</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> A doppelg\xE4nger who did horrible things in Shinjuku,<br> all because he lacked a personality of his own...</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> ...yet who also attempted to do the right thing once he finally had one...</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> It&#39;s a miracle that he existed. No doubt it was only made possible thanks to humanity&#39;s current precariousness.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> So I hope you will remember him,<br> Master, even if no one else does.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> It is through your observation that his small tragedy and struggle will live on forever.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> And for him, there could be no greater honor.</p><p><strong>Yan Qing:</strong><br> Yeah.</p><p><strong>Yan Qing:</strong><br> Thanks for believing in me right to the end, Master.<br> I appreciate that.</p><p><strong>Yan Qing:</strong><br> As long as I&#39;m here, Fujimaru...<br> I&#39;ll keep fighting for you and you alone!</p>', 399);
