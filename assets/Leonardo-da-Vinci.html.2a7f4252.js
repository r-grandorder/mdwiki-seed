The legendary all-roundedness associated with Leonardo da Vinci given shape. It is commonly called an all-purpose, specially-made Noble Phantasm that instantly analyzes the target(s) and adjusts his/her greatest attack in accordance with that (those) target(s) before firing. Apparently, it is originally a reflection-type Noble Phantasm that repels attacks by provisionally composing the enemy\u2019s Noble Phantasm on the spot, but those resources are being utilized for the sake of administrating Chaldea.</p><p>In \u201CFate/Grand Order\u201D, a different shape of da Vinci\u2019s all-roundedness is demonstrated. That is to say, it is a magic attack where his/her gauntlet (an all-purpose gauntlet suitable for every war situation) worn on his/her right hand is modified in the blink of an eye, before it projects pure Magical Energy towards the enemy camp and giving them a \u201Ccompulsory\u201D fixed damage by means of this attack. This damage is not able to be reduced by any defensive-type Noble Phantasm and Skill, not to mention Anti-Magical Energy abilities\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014In other words, by putting together a super advanced formula technique that analyzes in real-time, every opponent becomes a susceptible target for his/her Magecraft.</p><h1 id="character" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#character" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Character</h1><h2 id="pronouns" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#pronouns" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Pronouns</h2><p>First Person Pronoun: watashi<br> Second Person Pronouns: kimi [hiragana characters] / kimi [katakana characters] / \u25CB\u25CB (one\u2019s name without honorifics)<br> Third Person Pronouns: kare / kanojo / \u25CB\u25CB (one\u2019s name without honorifics)</p><h2 id="personality" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#personality" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Personality</h2><p>Rational, and on top of that, placid. However, da Vinci will jump at things that are very interesting to him/her with sparkling eyes. A type of genius that accurately grasps one\u2019s abilities. What he/she can do, and what he/she cannot do. What others can do, and what they cannot do. Because he/she can basically observe/guess (calculate)/grasp everything with merely a glance, he/she is always composed. The point is, it is absolutely necessary to be careful, and even if one falls into a desperate situation with no escape, they should be composed and not being any different than usual. For him/her, the \u201Cunexpected\u201D does not simply occur, and even if it does occur, he/she completely assesses that rare situation with great interest. However, just because he/she puts on a face that grasps everything does not necessarily mean it is good to completely rely on him/her.</p><p>The fact that his/her current self is in a young female body is something da Vinci is relatively unaware of. After taking a bath, he/she is the type to prowl around as he/she likes while naked.

A European figure of the 15th~16th Century. A prominent genius who provided a lot of influence on the advancement of civilization and left his name behind in human history. Although Leonardo da Vinci was recorded to be a matchless pretty boy \u2013 a matchless handsome young man\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014this is in fact his actual condition. Regardless, age and gender has no effect before a true genius. Doctrines and fashion may change with the times, but there is merely one truth.<br> \u201CWhatever happens, da Vinci-chan is the Unrivaled Universal One!\u201D</p><p>\u25C6</p><p>Being a great man of wisdom, one can therefore conclude that da Vinci was given the Caster Class, or not. Since his/her lifetime, he/she was a powerful mage. There is not one thing strange about that. It is something obvious. In addition to science, mathematics, engineering, natural history, music, architecture, sculpture, painting, invention, weapons development and the like, he/she also simply possessed the talent for Magecraft.</p><p>Everything was possible. His/her teacher Verrocchio, Machiavelli and Botticelli of whom are his/her friends, Cesare and the French King Francis I, his/her sponsors and so forth, and the people of the world, all called and praised da Vinci as a natural genius.<br> \u201CNo, that is incorrect. Everything is the fruit of learning. It is nothing more than a reason to continue studying for \u201Cthe origin of all creation\u201D.\u201D<br> He/she quietly reflects on this as thus.</p><p>Da Vinci is certainly self-aware that there was practically no one who could rival his/her \u201Coutput\u201D. The sole person who could compare with him/her was more or less Michelangelo, really. But even that was only in the field of the fine arts. In other fields such as science and mathematics, there was no one who could surpass him/her. What is the reason?</p><p>It is learning. That is to say, it is no more than information being \u201Cinputted\u201D and accurately grasped, organized and stored in da Vinci\u2019s head as knowledge that can be feasibly referred to at all times. It is not the case that it is a talent bestowed to him/her by God, nor was it him/her having thought up of things and bringing them into existence out of nothing. The particulars of even \u201Coutputting\u201D practical applications/developments is from the basis of the information being \u201Cinputted\u201D into his/her head, and it seems to be a mechanism that is sufficiently well-reasoned. Everybody can do it. So why is he/she different?</p><p>However, people far and wide called da Vinci universal. The Universal Man (Uomo Universale) with no one in this world that could rival him/her.</p><p>\u201CHeh, yes, I see. Universal. All of you are calling me as such.\u201D</p><p>In this way, da Vinci was \u201Cself-aware\u201D of his/her all-roundedness. Knowing the existence of Magecraft that is concealed in Mystery, and also letting his/her talent in that field blossom, already, it was no more than a natural result for him/her. Although his/her body does not even possess the Magic Circuits that were refined by one\u2019s bloodline due to their family lineage, nor a Magic Crest that was the result of the diligent studies of successive generations of mages, the Universal One was going strong. Naturally, regarding the quantity of his/her Magic Circuits that he/she was born with, it is understandably negligible. And yet, its quality is something that should be called outside the standard, while concerning its composition, it is very abnormal. It would mean that his/her all-roundedness would also be demonstrated to the World of Magecraft.</p><p>In spite of a very short training time\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014da Vinci showed that he/she can manipulate many attributes and had studied many Magic Systems.</p><p>\u201CHow is it possible? How\u2026 do you have so much talent? Is it possible to attain those abnormal Magic Circuits? Perhaps those are\u2026 something caused by the blood of a mage from the Age of Gods being left behind in you, expressed as an atavism, is it not?\u201D</p><p>Da Vinci informed the inquiries of the mage of the Clock Tower \u2013 who even though it was not to the extent that he/she calls him his/her friend, became his/her acquaintance \u2013 with this:</p><p>\u201CNow; look, it is because at any rate, I am \u2018universal\u2019, right?\u201D</p><p>The appearance of da Vinci\u2019s smile was beautiful, as if a goddess has descended to the earth. No doubt, it is because he/she is universal even in regard to beauty.</p><p>\u25C6</p><p>The third Heroic Spirit summoned by Chaldea. A Servant summoned during a time when the Heroic Spirit Summoning System \u2013 Fate was still incomplete. Although it was said that he/she was about to depart before long as a result of the system\u2019s instability, da Vinci-chan had grown great interest when he/she comprehended Chaldea\u2019s circumstances, and he/she chose to set up residence in Chaldea due to Romani Archaman\u2019s persuasions. Da Vinci-chan constructed a duplicate puppet of him/herself, and he/she is suspended in the present era by asserting that as his/her Master. The thing he/she just did is the same technique as the one that a certain doll maker somewhere out there is known for.</p><p>Da Vinci-chan is, so to speak, a fraud Servant that is suspended in the present era under a \u201Cmasqueraded contract\u201D. If he/she acquires a legitimate Master by means of a summoning, he/she will finally become a Servant \u201Cthat can go out on the front lines and fight.\u201D</p><h2 id="others" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#others" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Others</h2><p>There exists a statue of David that was constructed by having da Vinci\u2019s adolescent figure as a model.</p><h2 id="related-characters" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#related-characters" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Related Characters</h2><p><strong>Romani Archaman</strong></p><p>His/her colleague and close friend.<br> \u201C\u25A0\u25A0\u25A0\u25A0\u25A0\u25A0 with a tendency to \u25A0\u25A0\u25A0\u25A0\u25A0\u25A0\u25A0\u25A0\u25A0\u25A0, is he not?

From the standpoint of a weapons developer, I designed a staff that incorporates a pentagram and a stern gauntlet device as her weapons. If I thought of her as a character that was used as a store NPC to some degree, she would become the main NPC\u2026 By the way, when I was notified that Ms. Sakamoto Maaya was the voice actor who is responsible for her voice, I was so happy, I could die!
