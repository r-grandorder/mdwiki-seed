To put it in terms you&#39;d understand, it&#39;s a kind of Reality Marble.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Um, well... I mean it&#39;s just a small model of a house with figures lined up in it...</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong><br> What a rude human you are. This diorama is something that, little by little, day by day, with layer upon layer of precise spell...</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong><br> I finally succeeded in creating. The ultimate Bounded Field. Well, I guess the likes of you wouldn&#39;t be able to comprehend it.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> You&#39;re right, I don&#39;t get it at all. My studies have been insufficient. I must reflect on this.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Caster, you like things like this, don&#39;t you?</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong><br> Oh, is it that obvious? I enjoy bottle ship models the best, but isn&#39;t it nice to try your hand at something grander?</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong><br> This time I got excited and made it without considering the profitability. Hehehe.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I don&#39;t think anyone could understand, Mash.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Yes, I was beginning to feel that way.<br> This appears to be Medea&#39;s special hobby...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Holed up in her room, concentrated yet gloomy.<br> I guess you can call that a nerdy hobby in a sense.</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong><br> Please refrain from calling it a nerdy hobby.<br> Some people might get hurt by that comment, like me.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> True. I take back my words.<br> This isn&#39;t just any model, it&#39;s an exquisite diorama.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Well then.<br> Is the &quot;Doll King&quot; perhaps\u2014</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong><br> Yes.<br> I&#39;m referring to inside this small world.</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong><br> Inside this diorama is what one might call another dimension. To put it into terms amateurs like yourselves could understand...</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong><br> ...you could even call it the world of dolls.<br> The dolls inside this house are literally alive.</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong><br> Of course, this is because these are dolls I personally take the time to create.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> How capable is this Witch from the Age of Gods...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> She&#39;s got a lot of free time.</p><hr><p><strong>Medea:</strong><br> You there, what did you say?</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong><br> I already said this, so I&#39;m sure you got it.<br> I want you to perform some maintenance for me.</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong><br> The doll I gave administrative rights to over this world is ignoring my orders and has begun to act without permission.</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong><br> Seriously! He has forgotten the debt owed to me as his creator and bitten the hand that feeds him!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Ah well. I don&#39;t fully understand, but couldn&#39;t we just remove that doll from the outside?</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong><br> If I could have done that, I already would have.<br> If we intervene from the outside, everything will break.</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong><br> It may be easy to add or alter, but removing takes several times more skill and sense.</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong><br> There are many people who can revise a completed novel, but very few would erase the characters, no?</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong><br> That is what it means to draw elements from things that have been completed.</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong><br> Even by removing a single doll, the damage would be far greater.</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong><br> This is why the beings that humans think of as gods have not laid a hand on the world since it was created.</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong><br> No matter how much damage spreads, the creators can only look on from the outside.</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong><br> In order to minimalize damage, it is best to go in and involve oneself.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Quite right, but...<br> how would one enter...</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong><br> Rest assured, I will show you the way.<br> Now, calm your minds...hehehehehehe.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> That&#39;s not reassuring at all...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I-I feel kind of light-headed...</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Senpai!?<br> ...Senpai!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Senpai!<br> Are you awake?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> What is this place?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Where are we now?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Thank goodness, you&#39;re all right. I lost consciousness and the next thing I know, we&#39;re here...</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong><br> Well?<br> Rise and shine.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Medea! What just...<br> I mean, where exactly is this?</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong><br> I TOLD you. Inside the box.<br> How is it, the world I so carefully constructed?</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong><br> &quot;Imaginary Earth: Social Plan World&quot;<br> For short, &quot;Jason World: Japan!&quot;</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong><br> I have prepared a variety of attractions here!</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong><br> Basically, any man with a pretty face is set to meet with a terrible fate\u2661</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Um, Senpai?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Talk about a hostile theme park.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> How did things get so complicated?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Medea, putting aside the explanation of these &quot;attractions,&quot; could you tell us exactly how we got here?</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong><br> Oh, you still don&#39;t understand?<br> I prepared some dolls here to be used by guests.</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong><br> I shifted your consciousness here.<br> Just think of it as a consciousness-only Rayshift.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Just our consciousness...<br> Isn&#39;t that a big deal?</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong><br> It&#39;s all right, I&#39;ve set it so you can return once you&#39;ve defeated this world&#39;s administrator.</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong><br> Oh, don&#39;t worry about the entry fee.<br> It was my idea, so this time it&#39;s free!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Uh. It looks like there&#39;s no choice but to give in to Medea&#39;s request.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> \u2014<br> Senpai, someone carrying a sword is approaching!</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong><br> That&#39;s a Level 10 general soldier, a Jason Hunter.<br> It&#39;s programmed to attack normies on sight.</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong><br> There are also Jason Killers who rampage when they see couples, those who bring friends, or more than two people.</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong><br> And Jason Aces who challenge any girl under twenty on sight.</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong><br> Not to mention, Naked Jason who won&#39;t rest until he destroys anything and everything around him.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Medea, that&#39;s overkill!</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong><br> Oh, and if you die here, you&#39;ll be able to return to your body... But some of the pain will carry over, so be careful.</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong><br> If you receive enough damage and die, you&#39;ll feel pain worse than death when you wake up.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Simply outrageous...<br> Anyway, Master, prepare for combat!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Whew. We managed to defeat them,<br> but those aren&#39;t just soldiers, they&#39;re monsters...</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong><br> How strange... The dolls I made are mutating?<br> ...I wonder what happened?</p><p><strong>Automata:</strong><br> Eradicate... Eradicate all outsiders...<br> Eradicate! Eradicate! Eradicate! Eradicate! Eradicate!</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong><br> What? When did I ever make anything like THIS?<br> No, this attention to detail, the smoothness of their movable parts\u2014</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong><br> They&#39;ve achieved a level superior to my own...<br> I-I haven&#39;t been this embarassed in a long time! How mortifying!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Pull yourself together, Caster.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> How about changing from Caster to Modeler?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I completely agree, but for now, let us concentrate on the battle! The enemy is formidable, Master!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Whew... We managed to hold them off,<br> but there&#39;ll be no end to it if we can&#39;t cut off their head.</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong><br> ...It seems you won&#39;t have to worry about that.<br> Here comes the head... Wait, wh-what is this?</p><p><strong>Doll Princess:</strong><br> \u2013You dare to trample my dream?<br> What kind of rude human are you?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That&#39;s...Medea&#39;s shadow?<br> ...But doesn&#39;t it look a bit smaller?</p><p><strong>Doll Princess:</strong><br> \u2013Now, my cute dolls. Exterminate these pests who seek to destroy this world of dreams.</p><p><strong>Shadow Servant:</strong><br> \u2013For our Princess Medea.<br> \u2013For our Princess Medea.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Um... Can this be...<br> Medea&#39;s...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> So this is...Medea&#39;s miniature garden.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> So this is Medea&#39;s wish...</p><hr><p><strong>Medea:</strong><br> N-NO! That&#39;s just a doll!<br> It has nothing to do with me! NOTHING!</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong><br> I mean what is this &quot;princess&quot; nonsense? Wanting to be a princess... I mean, I am not an adolescent child anymore...</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong><br> Y-You understand, don&#39;t you Fujimaru? I&#39;m not such a hopeless woman, right?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Uh... Right...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Dolls are your friends...</p><hr><p><strong>Medea:</strong><br> NOOOOOO!<br> DON&#39;T LOOK AT ME WITH THOSE EYES!!!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Medea:</strong><br> It&#39;s over... It&#39;s all...over...</p><p><strong>Doll Princess:</strong><br> \u2013Curse you, ganging up on an innocent princess like myself and causing me bodily harm!</p><p><strong>Doll Princess:</strong><br> What do you take a maiden&#39;s flower garden for?<br> Can you really live with yourselves if you kill a sweet princess?</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong><br> Rule Breaker!</p><p><strong>Doll Princess:</strong><br> AAAAHH!<br> You princess killers! (Flop)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It looks like...it&#39;s over.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Yes, everything...</p><hr><p><strong>Medea:</strong><br> ...(Glare)</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong><br> Nothing happened! Absolutely nothing happened here!<br> None of you saw ANYTHING! Understood?</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong><br> Fujimaru, UNDERSTOOD?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Now that&#39;s asking a little too much...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Well, I guess some people are into that kind of thing...</p><hr><p><strong>Medea:</strong><br> What? You have a problem with that?<br> I can&#39;t dream of being a princess?</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong><br> No matter her age, every girl is a princess!<br> What&#39;s so wrong with that? Huh? WHAT?!</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong><br> Yeah, that&#39;s right! I&#39;m a poor, pathetic, lonely girl who has dolls for friends!<br> Kill me! I&#39;d rather you just killed me!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> No, I believe that, someday, you too, Medea, will find someone to love.</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong><br> Spare me your worthless sympathy! Just you watch,<br> someday, I WILL find happiness, no matter what!</p>', 149);
