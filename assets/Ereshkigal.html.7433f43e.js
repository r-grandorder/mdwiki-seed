The reason why the Final Stage art ended up being a somewhat sentimental picture may have been because the memories of that Chapter 7 remained marked. As for the clothes, it\u2019s the same case as with Ishtar, but I was aware of the trend of not feeling out of place when set up with fellow characters of ancient Mesopotamia. Specifically for Ereshkigal, the condition was, while treating the golden parts as a moderate accent and covering the body with dark clothes with a so-so feeling, to put on a mantle of moderate length. And for Meslamtaea, in which the Authority of the sun is said to reside, a radial silhouette with the image of the sun, as a huge weapon to be paired with Ishtar\u2019s Maanna. This is so that the spear in her hand and the surroundings are shining, but Ereshkigal herself isn\u2019t tinged with the light. I tried to show the property of Ereshkigal herself not shining even if the surroundings are shining due to the Authority. This is a digression, but regarding Ereshkigal\u2019s skills at the time of implementation, I just conveyed the message that I wouldn\u2019t say any other trivial thing if I brought the protection of the Underworld. So. It\u2019s that red flower that blooms at the skill section. Thank you.
