A magic shield that had once been owned by the evil mage Atlantes, who had abducted Bradamante\u2019s lover, Rogero. The shield can emit an intense light of Magical Energy by means of its True Name Release, causing damage to its targets while also forcing them to undergo a Stun Check. Even if they end up not being stunned at the conclusion of their Check, by having their eyes blinded by the light, their Agility Parameter would be temporarily lowered considerably.</p><p>Furthermore, one should not primarily strike with a shield. Yet for Bradamante, it appears that her spirits are rising too high on the occasion of her materialization in the present world, so after dazzling her targets with the light emitted from her shield, she almost unconsciously rushes forward to strike at them with it.</p><p>It has been said that Bradamante, who defeated Atlantes, obtained the shield the latter owned and even got the Phantasmal Beast Hippogriff he rode on too. (If she was summoned in the Rider Class, the Hippogriff would fully come along with her for sure.)</p><h1 id="angelica-cathay-resplendently-beautiful-is-the-ring-of-the-pretty-princess" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#angelica-cathay-resplendently-beautiful-is-the-ring-of-the-pretty-princess" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Angelica Cathay: Resplendently Beautiful is the Ring of the Pretty Princess</h1><ul><li>Rank: C</li><li>Classification: Anti-Personnel Noble Phantasm / Barrier Noble Phantasm</li><li>Range: 1~10</li><li>Maximum Number of Targets: 30 people</li></ul><p>A mysterious ring that had once been owned by Angelica, a beautiful princess of a foreign country whom both Roland and Bradamante\u2019s elder brother Renaud \u2013 whom both are part of the Twelve Peers \u2013 had fallen in love with. It is said that it has the power to nullify any and all Magecraft. It has been arranged so that Bradamante would possess this ring because of a hapless fate, and she greatly applied the ring\u2019s powers at the time of extricating her lover Rogero from the evil mage Atlantes.</p><p>The reason why the rank in Bradamante\u2019s Magical Resistance Skill \u2013 which should originally be around Rank C \u2013 is being changed to Rank A and why the Magic Cancellation Skill is being endowed to her is because of this Noble Phantasm\u2019s effect.

It is also primarily endowed with the power to \u201Cconceal one\u2019s figure\u201D.

A pure-hearted girl knight who always tries to have faith in justice and aims to do good even when in a predicament.</p><p>Bradamante never yields before any hardship, and when she thinks of how to deal with them, she will always carry it out sooner or later. It is a work that can be done with her unwavering emotional strength\u2026 but occasionally, even a complaint briefly escapes from her mouth.</p><p>Bradamante hates mages because she suffered unpleasant things from them during her lifetime. However, she excludes Merlin from them. As a matter of fact, she has a connection with the Grand Mage Merlin, and in her adventures when she was alive, Bradamante has been receiving advice from him through his priestess.

A pure-hearted girl knight. The Knight of the White Wings. Bradamante was born as the daughter of Duke Aymon of the House of Clermont and Aya, the King\u2019s younger sister, and she has an elder brother, the swordsman Renaud, who owns the magic sword Froberge and is one of the Twelve Peers just like her. Similar to her elder brother, she is known far and wide as a brilliant swordswoman. It is said that at the time when Charlemagne\u2019s army was caught in a dilemma during their battle against the Great King Agramante, Bradamante herself personally served as the army\u2019s rearguard and proceeded to engage in a magnificent duel with the enemy general Rodomonte, the King of Algiers.</p><p>Before long, Bradamante falls in love with the knight Rogero, the leader of an enemy nation and a descendant of the Hero Hector, and for the sake of having this love fulfilled, she fought against many hardships. Even when he was abducted by an evil mage; even when he was swayed by a witch; even when a Greek prince came to propose marriage to her \u2013 Bradamante did not give up each time by any means and continued to face them all.</p><p>\u25C6</p><p>For the Bradamante who materialized as a Servant, it is possible to say that Rogero makes her very identity as \u201Ca Heroic Spirit who continues to run after a radiance.\u201D So long as she is the \u201Ctale\u201D named \u2018Bradamante\u2019, it is assured that she will continue to search and pursue the \u201Chope\u201D named \u2018Rogero\u2019. That is to say, she will never, not even once, reach a happy ending like when she was alive\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014for she is surely someone who has been defined as \u201Ca tale of an eternal quest\u201D\u2026</p><p>\u201COf course, I\u2019m a bit sad!

It seems noteworthy that shield-and-spear users are sorted into the Lancer Class.</p><h2 id="related-characters" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#related-characters" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Related Characters</h2><p><strong>Astolfo</strong></p><p>\u201CHey, Asto.

The rough design I submitted in the beginning was her with fairly simple clothes, and because \u2018wings\u2019 was the motif of her design, the wings at the front of her rough design was emphasized. But I have made Bradamante\u2019s design brighter and more feminine as well with the wings motif also being smaller in its emphasis, and then having drawn a good backside for her, I settled down with her current design. I am personally pleased with the design of her magic shield Noble Phantasm.
