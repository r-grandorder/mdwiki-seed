To me, it was a threat to be eliminated as a Counter Guardian.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> There&#39;s no need to go into details.<br> A target emerged, and needed to be taken care of.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I simply do what I was meant to do:<br> I search for the enemy, engage, and eliminate them.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> The fewer people I engage with, the better.<br> At least, that&#39;s a personal choice of mine.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Heroic Spirits. Heroes.<br> Many of those are mere shadows of mass murderers.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> In my opinion, they are all repulsive.<br> I prefer not to be by their side when fighting.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> But working completely independently is also difficult.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> It must be because of my lack of freedom as a Servant.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Requiring Master to accompany us for Rayshifts is a pain. But I suppose that has turned out to be a blessing in disguise...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Fujimaru, or Master, is quick to understand. And so we were progressing smoothly. This time is no different.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> The source of the minute Singularity... It could be a fragment of a Holy Grail, or a remnant of the original abnormality in the timeline.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> But they are all simple to track. A majority of them can be eradicated and handled with a single attack.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Should it be a life-form, we kill it.<br> If it is an inanimate object, we destroy it.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> We seek it out, and then swiftly...</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> ...This time around, it&#39;s quite clear-cut.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> It must be a remnant of the many things you defeated. It&#39;s not as powerful as what we encountered in the final Singularity.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> It&#39;s not alive.<br> It&#39;s already dead.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> But it&#39;s taken in a shard of a Holy Grail.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> Which then it turned into a minute Singularity.<br> What a pain. There are far too many Holy Grails...</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> ...and, of course, shards in this Grand Order.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Sorry to take up your time, Emiya.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> Likewise.<br> Sorry to rope you into this.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Thanks for finding it so quickly.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> Finding the problem and dealing with it swiftly is my forte. I should be the one thanking you.</p><hr><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> Now let&#39;s do it.<br> I&#39;m sure IT&#39;S also tired of waiting for us.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Commence battle!</p><hr><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> Understood, Master.</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> It ends here, you worthless pile of nothing.<br> I&#39;m sure you&#39;re sick of living as an empty shell.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> Mission completed, Master.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> The minute Singularity has disappeared.<br> We should hurry back to Chaldea.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Good work, Emiya.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> We got it done quick thanks to you.</p><hr><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> It was nothing.<br> I just did my job.</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong><br> ......</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> .........</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong><br> ............</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Um...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> What are you two doing in front of Emiya&#39;s room?</p><hr><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Mrow!?</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Hmmm hmmm hmmm, fweet tweet tweet\u266A<br> (Humming and whistling)</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong><br> Um, it&#39;s actually a bit of a long story...</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong><br> It has nothing to do with the Holy Grail. I am...like a Divided Spirit that poured out of the Holy Grail...</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong><br> That makes me unique among all the Heroic Spirits. But me standing right here is not related to that whatsoever.</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong><br> ...We&#39;re just taking a peek.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> It&#39;s exactly how it looks!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> When you&#39;re stalking prey, you hide in the darkness! This jaguar is sad to know you forgot the laws of the jungle!</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong><br> That&#39;s not it.<br> We&#39;re not out to kill anyone!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Why don&#39;t you just talk to him?</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong><br> Yes...you&#39;re right.<br> We know that&#39;s the right thing to do...</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong><br> But that man doesn&#39;t want to see us.<br> Even when we speak to him, he just walks away...</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong><br> Honestly, we&#39;ve run out of options.</p><hr><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> (Gasp!) Here he comes!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Deploying Noble Phantasm \u201CJaguar in the Black\u201D!<br> It&#39;ll make this whole place SUPER dark!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Come on, Miss Iri and Master!<br> This way!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Be like glue, stick together and become one with the darkness...!</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong><br> Ah! My shadow...!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Is that a Noble Phantasm you don&#39;t use in battle!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> You sound like a boss.</p><hr><p><strong>C\uFF1AJaguar Warrior:</strong><br> (Hmmm...like the \u201CDancer in the Dark.\u201D<br> Perfect. Nobody can see us from the outside!)</p><p><strong>C\uFF1AJaguar Warrior:</strong><br> (It&#39;s a nagual-like Presence Concealment.<br> Behold, it can even hide friends other than Jaguar!)</p><p><strong>E\uFF1AIrisviel:</strong><br> (Wow, how wonderful.)</p><p><strong>C\uFF1AJaguar Warrior:</strong><br> (Yep, yep. Miss Iri, you really are accepting and wonderful too, meow. You get a Jaguar stamp... Stamp! Once more for good measure.)</p><p><strong>E\uFF1AIrisviel:</strong><br> (Teehee. You flatter me, Jaguar Warrior.)</p><p><strong>C\uFF1AJaguar Warrior:</strong><br> (By the way, it will only work for Jaguar during battle. Obviously, I can&#39;t hide an entire group in the middle of a fight!)</p><p><strong>C\uFF1AJaguar Warrior:</strong><br> (Our prey is heading towards the Command Room.<br> Come on let&#39;s TAIL him!)</p><p><strong>E\uFF1AIrisviel:</strong><br> (Roger that! Come on. Master, you too. Hold your breath and follow us. We&#39;re in this together now!)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I guess I&#39;ll tag along.</p><p><strong>C\uFF1AJaguar Warrior:</strong><br> (That&#39;s the spirit! Big Sis is glad to have an understanding Master. Here, I&#39;ll give you this wonderful dead spider as a reward!)</p><p><strong>C\uFF1AJaguar Warrior:</strong><br> (Eh? You don&#39;t want it?<br> But it&#39;s a paw-sitively perfect gift!)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Chaldea has enough stalkers...</p><p><strong>C\uFF1AJaguar Warrior:</strong><br> (Yeah, Jaguar thinks so too. I&#39;m a teacher, after all. But they say: eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth, and a Blaze for a Bunyan.)</p><p><strong>C\uFF1AJaguar Warrior:</strong><br> (It&#39;s Emiya&#39;s fault for being so secretive.<br> Even Big Sis thinks... No, that&#39;s not my point.)</p><p><strong>C\uFF1AJaguar Warrior:</strong><br> (Even I&#39;m concerned for him. What in the world happened to him to make him act like that.)</p><p><strong>C\uFF1AJaguar Warrior:</strong><br> (What&#39;s with the dark, gloomy aura? If we leave him alone, he&#39;s definitely gonna die alone.)</p><p><strong>E\uFF1AIrisviel:</strong><br> (...Yes. I can&#39;t just sit idly by and watch that happen to him.)</p><hr><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> ............</p><p><strong>F\uFF1AEmiya:</strong><br> .........</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> ......?</p><p><strong>F\uFF1AEmiya:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>E\uFF1AIrisviel:</strong><br> (It appears he was speaking with that Archer.)</p><p><strong>C\uFF1AJaguar Warrior:</strong><br> (What were they talking about?<br> Let&#39;s go ask!)</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Mee-wow, Emiyan! The Emiyan who at least makes us feel kind of comfortable!</p><p><strong>F\uFF1AEmiya:</strong><br> ... (She appeared out of nowhere again...)<br> Hello, jungle spirit. What business do you have with me?</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Ah... You&#39;re one of the few people who treats me properly, as a spirit! I paw-sitively love that!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> I&#39;m compelled to send over a nice hawk carcass or something as a gift...but now&#39;s not the time. What were you HAWKing about!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> That&#39;s...direct.</p><p><strong>E\uFF1AIrisviel:</strong><br> (Yes, that&#39;s the kind of bluntness I&#39;d expect from Jaguar Warrior...)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> That was a lame pun, but hopefully he didn&#39;t notice her true intent.</p><p><strong>E\uFF1AIrisviel:</strong><br> (The Assassin... He left already, so hopefully it&#39;s not that obvious. Oh my, wait a minute...)</p><p><strong>E\uFF1AIrisviel:</strong><br> (Does that mean we lost sight of him!?)</p><hr><p><strong>F\uFF1AEmiya:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>F\uFF1AEmiya:</strong><br> Oh, well.</p><p><strong>F\uFF1AEmiya:</strong><br> After all, no matter how chaotic and full of ulterior motives your actions are, at least it&#39;s all usually done with the best intentions.</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Yep, yep. That&#39;s because I&#39;m an animal.</p><p><strong>F\uFF1AEmiya:</strong><br> He asked about my magical energy consumption during battle. I answered as best I could.</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Oh. That&#39;s insignifiCAT.</p><p><strong>E\uFF1AIrisviel:</strong><br> (Yes, that&#39;s quite ordinary.)</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Whatever! I&#39;ve GATO-go, first Emiyan!<br> Or actually, maybe you should be second...?</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Anyway, until next time! It&#39;d be nice if you made some good ta-PAWS so that I can have a nice drink soon!</p><p><strong>E\uFF1AIrisviel:</strong><br> (Ah! Jaguar Warrior, wait, wait!)</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> Yes, I spoke briefly with him.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> We spoke about what to be mindful when battling in groups. Other than that, nothing else significant...</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> Yes. I did just speak with him.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> We talked about battles in the Singularity.<br> It wasn&#39;t that long of a conversation.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> I actually had some questions for him of my own...but that should be for another time.</p><p><strong>Lord El-Melloi II:</strong><br> We spoke on various topics in magecraft.</p><p><strong>Lord El-Melloi II:</strong><br> He asked me a few things about grand magecraft and ritualistic magecraft, mainly about Mystic Codes.</p><p><strong>Lord El-Melloi II:</strong><br> And about the magical energy consumed when using things like that...</p><p><strong>Lord El-Melloi II:</strong><br> It was quite insignificant. It could have been covered in a few short words, really.</p><p><strong>Lord El-Melloi II:</strong><br> He was likely...</p><p><strong>Lord El-Melloi II:</strong><br> No, I&#39;d rather not. This isn&#39;t something to involve myself in based only on speculation.</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Argh. We lost him!<br> Big Sis is a-paw-led!</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong><br> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Huh? Does Iri look relieved?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> She looks happy, actually.</p><hr><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong><br> Yes, you&#39;re right.</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong><br> I&#39;m just happy.<br> I was worried that he was all alone in Chaldea...</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong><br> That&#39;s what I&#39;ve been concerned about this whole time. It&#39;s always been on my mind.</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong><br> But maybe that was just my selfishness talking. No matter which \u201Cwhat if\u201D version of him would appear...</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong><br> To think that I would be needed...</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong><br> I am such a greedy woman. I may not look like it, but I&#39;m supposed to be a mature wife...</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Ku...guwah!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> For Master Iri to say words like \u201Cmature\u201D and \u201Cwife\u201D without hesitation...ahhh, she has so much adultness!</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong><br> Oh, y-you think so?<br> A-and what exactly is \u201Cadultness\u201D?</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> This Jaguar is moved. I&#39;m at a loss.<br> But I haven&#39;t lost the game! NEVER SURRENDER!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Remember to always be a tough cookie, and grin and bear it!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Dammit!<br> We&#39;re going to play again...fur real soon!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> It&#39;s gone...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Um, for now, good work...?</p><hr><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>--SECTION BREAK--:</strong></p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> ...I managed to get away.<br> Ugh, what a pain.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Divided Spirits like goddesses...two special Servants. Having their attention is nothing but trouble.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> First Servant: Irisviel von Einzbern.<br> Second Servant: Jaguar Warrior.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Those two seem to want to talk to me excessively, and it&#39;s obvious that they don&#39;t like me to be isolated in the way I prefer.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> That is why I sought out other Servants to talk to.<br> I am not used to conversing with heroes of the past.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I&#39;m assuming El-Melloi II must have caught on,<br> but he&#39;s not one to talk. He&#39;s that kind of man.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> ...Now, are the two Servants satisfied?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> It really is a pain in the ass...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> But this is nothing new. This isn&#39;t the first time I felt the burning gaze of two Servants in Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> It&#39;s none of their business. I suppose their interest stems from knowing another version of me from some other version of history.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Or something like that.<br> How stupid.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Whoever they know, he is not me.</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong><br> ...Yes, you&#39;re right.<br> A different person.</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong><br> But there must be SOME sort of connection between us. Though you may not believe it...</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong><br> And besides, my dear...</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong><br> You&#39;re watching me...following me with those eyes.<br> At times. Sometimes.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> How dare you enter someone else&#39;s room.<br> You&#39;re like an Assassin.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> And stop reading others&#39; minds. I know that as a Divided Spirit of a Holy Grail...which makes you a part of the powerful wish-granting device...</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> ...reading one&#39;s mind may just be second nature to you. But it&#39;s annoying to me.</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong><br> ...I&#39;m sorry.</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong><br> I never meant to annoy you. Nor do I wish for you to take an interest in the version of me in this world.</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong><br> But...you know...to see you so alone...</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong><br> ...is very painful for me.</p><p><strong>B\uFF1AEmiya:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>B\uFF1AEmiya:</strong><br> That&#39;s your problem.</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong><br> You&#39;re right.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> ...Not getting involved with others is my decision.</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong><br> Kiritsugu?</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> Don&#39;t call me that.<br> So...you do know that name...</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> ...Please get out.<br> A day may come when the two of us speak...</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> But it is not today, Irisviel von Einzbern.</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong><br> ...Yes.</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong><br> I&#39;m sorry, Kiri\u2013</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong><br> ...Assassin.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> A terminal of the Holy Grail.<br> Transformed from an Einzbern homunculus.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> She&#39;ll be one formidable opponent.</p><p><strong>--SECTION BREAK--:</strong></p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> I-I just saw Caster run out of Assassin&#39;s room, crying!</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> You&#39;re right.<br> It seems that way.</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> Wh-wh-wh-wh-what does that mean!?<br> And why...why is my heart racing so much right now!?</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> ...Who knows?<br> Maybe because you&#39;re such a simpleminded brat?</p>', 207);
