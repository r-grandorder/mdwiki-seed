Maybe I&#39;ll just drink some tea by myself.</p><hr><p>\u201CYes... it&#39;s about today&#39;s appointment... no.\u201D</p><hr><p>...I&#39;ve run into Rider again.</p><p>I&#39;ll make some tea for her too, just in case.</p><p>Since the teapot&#39;s still full of hot water, I quickly brew some roasted green tea.</p><hr><p>\u201CYes, is there an opening this afternoon?</p><p>As to the stylist... yes, please tell her I am in her debt.</p><p>Then, 3 o&#39;clock it is. Thank you.\u201D</p><hr><p>Stylist?</p><p>...I bring the tea into the living room and offer some to Rider.</p><hr><p>\u201CRider, were you on the phone?\u201D</p><p>\u201CYes. With the beauty salon.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><p>I&#39;m not sure what I&#39;m so surprised about, but the revelation does drive me into a temporary stupor.</p><p>...Well, Rider is a woman in her prime, after all; it&#39;s no surprise she&#39;d go to a salon, but... for a beauty like her to go to the same place in Miyama frequented by Homurabara students...?</p><hr><p>\u201CSalon? You mean the one in Miyama?\u201D</p><p>\u201CYes. The length of my hair makes it very difficult for me to care for it by myself.</p><p>I get it done about twice a week.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C..................\u201D</p><p>...Rider&#39;s hair...</p><p>Now that I think about it, I suddenly feel like touching her ever waving, smooth strands of hair.</p><p>...It would be so nice to run my hands through them, just once... No, down, boy. That&#39;s a good way to get yourself killed.</p><hr><p>\u201CMmm? So your hair grows?\u201D</p><p>\u201CNo, but it does become disheveled... And...\u201D</p><hr><p>Rider sips at her tea.</p><hr><p>\u201CWhen I turn back into my physical form, my hair goes back to its original state.\u201D</p><p>\u201CThen, I guess you just need to\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CI do not wish to bother Sakura with something as trivial as hair.</p><p>...So, even if it is truly bothersome, I must take care of my hair myself.</p><p>Frankly, having it disorganized also puts me in a bad mood.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CIt sounds like a problem in more ways than one. Being a woman, that is.\u201D</p><p>\u201CThank you for your concern, Shirou.</p><p>However, I would like you to put Sakura&#39;s well-being ahead of mine. I am merely her Servant and nothing more.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CSakura is happy to have your attention.</p><p>And I am happy to see you two together.\u201D</p><p>\u201CUh... I-I see... I&#39;ll do my best.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CYes... I realize it may be even harder than fighting in a battle, but please try your best... On a trivial side note, that is the side of you that I enjoy watching myself, as well.\u201D</p><p>\u201CUh.\u201D</p><p>Something scary hits me.</p><hr><p>\u201CU-Um, I&#39;ll take that as extra consideration towards Sakura.</p><p>What about Tohsaka? I wonder if she also visits a salon?\u201D</p><p>\u201CI believe it would be rather unnecessary for her.\u201D</p><p>That was quick.</p><hr><p>\u201C...Please don&#39;t take it the wrong way.</p><p>Rin is the type of person who does not like to have her effort seen. Having her beauty-related issues exposed to you, Shirou, would certainly hurt her pride.\u201D</p><p>\u201CAaah... I see.\u201D</p><p>A swan&#39;s feet... is what they say.</p><p>As for the remaining members of the women&#39;s squad\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>\u201CThen what about Saber?\u201D</p><p>\u201CThat&#39;s difficult. If I were to go tell her, a fight would surely ensue, but she would probably be a lot more open to the suggestion coming from you.\u201D</p><p>It is indeed quite difficult to predict how it would unfold.</p><p>She&#39;ll probably say something like... &quot;I like this hairstyle,&quot; or, possibly, &quot;Other hairstyles do not fit me.&quot;</p><hr><p>\u201CThen how about Fuji-Nee...? Haha.\u201D</p><p>Really, what would it be like?</p><p>\u201CShe might enjoy it.\u201D</p><p>\u201CHuh?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CShe might actually enjoy it.</p><p>She does not appear to be the kind of person to use much makeup, but she does not seem to dislike it, either.</p><p>If you wanted to go to the hair salon, I think she would tag along without hesitation.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C............\u201D</p><p>Wait.</p><p>Doesn&#39;t that imply that I would be the one going for a makeover, and not Fuji-Nee?</p><hr><p>\u201CLet&#39;s... end our suppositions here.</p><p>So, Rider, what will you do now?\u201D</p><p>\u201CDue to other appointments, the salon will be only be available in the afternoon. I&#39;ll be staying here, idling away until then.\u201D</p><p>And so she proceeds to set camp in front of the TV.</p><hr><p>\u201CAlthough... I am not particularly fond of it.\u201D</p><p>She says softly.</p><p>\u201CWuh?\u201D</p><p>She doesn&#39;t like the beauty salon?</p><hr><p>\u201CWhy&#39;s that? It looks like you&#39;re used to going there.\u201D</p><p>\u201C...Yes, but... there are mirrors there.\u201D</p><p>\u201CAh.\u201D</p><p>There are indeed a lot of mirrors in a hair salon.</p><p>Rider&#39;s true name is Medusa. Her tale includes a defeat with a mirror-like shield.</p><hr><p>\u201C...The legendary shield of mirror, is it?</p><p>The one that is said to have reflected the petrifying glare.\u201D</p><p>According to the Greek mythology, Medusa had her Mystic Eyes blocked by Perseus&#39; shield, and was defeated by having her head cut off, or something like that.</p><p>...?</p><p>Speaking of which...</p><hr><p>\u201CRider, don&#39;t you take off your glasses when you get your hair cut?</p><p>Meaning, you would be looking in the mirror... and wouldn&#39;t you be petrified?\u201D</p><p>\u201CNo. I do not get petrified simply by looking in a mirror.</p><p>That man relied on the reflection to fight me, to avoid looking directly in my eyes.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CAh, I see.\u201D</p><p>Perseus&#39; shield did not reflect the Mystic Eyes.</p><p>He merely made them ineffective by avoiding eye contact.</p><hr><p>\u201CHuh...? Then why do you find mirrors loathsome?</p><p>You weren&#39;t specifically beaten by a mirror. I can understand you might sometimes avoid them, but disliking them? Isn&#39;t that a bit much?\u201D</p><p>\u201C...Well, that&#39;s not necessarily true, either.</p><p>Although the goddess&#39; shield could not seal my Mystic Eyes, the thing that defeated me definitely was the &quot;mirror.&quot;\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C???\u201D</p><p>It&#39;s a mystery.</p><p>It looks like there are some plot holes in the mythology regarding Medusa.</p><hr><p>\u201C..................Would you like to hear the story, Shirou?\u201D</p><p>\u201CEh? Ah, no... it does sound interesting, but...\u201D</p><p>\u201CDo you insist on it?\u201D</p><p>\u201CNo, if you ask that way, then\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><hr><p>After all, it&#39;s a story concerning Medusa&#39;s... no, Rider&#39;s fall...</p><p>I feel as if I shouldn&#39;t insist on it...</p><p>\u201C...Ah, no.</p><p>But I&#39;ll definitely listen if you&#39;re up for it.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CUnderstood.</p><p>I prefer not to reminisce about such things, but if you want to hear about it, then I will tell you.</p><p>It goes back to when this body matured into a monster.</p><p>A story of the last days of a monster that is different from the current me\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><hr><p>The peaceful morning air somehow feels a lot more ominous and oppressive.</p><p>I&#39;m not sure if she is enjoying my frightened reaction, or if it&#39;s just a foreshadowing technique.</p><p>Rider quietly begins the story of her past self&#39;s final moments.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015...If that is so...</p><p>Then I shall bring back the head of the legendary monster, Gorgon\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><hr><p>The soon-to-be king of Tiryns,</p><p>The future king of Mycenae, Perseus, said this at a banquet.</p><p>The warrior most favored by the gods in the Greek world.</p><p>Perseus, the son of Zeus, the King of the Gods.

A hell on Earth.</p><hr><p>Five Noble Phantasms were given to Perseus.</p><p>A pair of winged sandals so he could fly through the air,</p><p>a helmet that granted invisibility to its wearer,</p><p>a bronze shield, polished like a mirror, the gift of the goddess Athena,</p><p>a snake hunter&#39;s curved sword - Harpe,</p><p>and, finally, a bag to contain the monster&#39;s head, Kibisis.</p><hr><p>No warrior in the history of Greece had ever been given this many Noble Phantasms.</p><p>Perseus equipped himself to win, and gathered much information to aid him.</p><p>A wealth of trustworthy weapons, and a strategy to utilize them.</p><p>Although he had neither seen the foe nor ever set foot in a demons&#39; lair, he had not a speck of fear.</p><p>Until the day of the battle.</p><p>Until the moment he descended to the dark palace.</p><hr><p>...The island was drastically different from what he had heard before.</p><p>The sun did not shine, the air was stale and all living things melted away.</p><p>A hell that did not permit the very existence of life, a dark palace stained with blood.</p><p>A place that would trick one into thinking that his time had come and he had fallen into the afterlife.</p><p>Although favored by the gods, Perseus, who had yet to prove himself as a hero, could not maintain his certainty of victory.</p><hr><p>Perseus ran deeper into the palace as if he were escaping.</p><p>His dreams of slaying the monster gloriously were long gone.</p><p>His mind was filled with something more urgent than his search for fame.</p><p>He only wanted one thing: find the monster, take its head, and escape from the island - as quickly as possible.</p><hr><p>The stale air was burning his skin, and where his feet had touched the ground, they were slowly melting away.</p><p>Simply stopping would spell certain defeat.</p><p>The foolish challenger would perish as the monster slept quietly inside the palace.</p><hr><p>Holding his breath, suppressing the scream rising in his throat, Perseus hid in the shadows as he advanced.</p><p>The palace was enormous.</p><p>No, it was excessively huge.</p><p>Seemingly enchanted, it had no beginning and no end.</p><p>This terrifying palace only revealed Perseus&#39; own insignificance.</p><p>Yes\u2015\u2015\u2015it was not that the palace was grand.</p><p>It was just that Perseus, shivering and alone, was like a tiny insect next to it.</p><hr><p>And so...</p><p>A few minutes, no, hours later, the mirrored shield warned Perseus.</p><p>The shield reflected the surroundings on its mirror-like surface.</p><p>A detector of sorts, the shield shows the dark palace&#39;s layout, as well as Perseus&#39; own heartbeat.</p><p>...And the heartbeat of a nearby monster, fast approaching...</p><hr><p>...The view distorts.</p><p>A grotesque creature emerges from the darkness.</p><p>Yet one cannot stare at it directly.</p><p>Perseus forces himself to look at nothing but the shield until the very end, guided by its clues.</p><hr><p>It is already too late to back away.

The monster, without even focusing on the fight, can\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>\u300A\u2015\u2015\u2015And the only way to fell the monster...</p><p>...is to let it encage itself\u2015\u2015\u2015\u300B</p><hr><p>Kibisis.</p><p>The bag that is said to have carried Medusa&#39;s head.</p><p>In an instant, it swells up, turns inside out and swallows Perseus whole.</p><p>The concept of inverting space.

So that&#39;s how the story of Medusa&#39;s slaying actually went.\u201D</p><p>\u201CYes. From then on, seeing my own reflection was a somewhat traumatic experience. I would not describe it as a hate of mirrors in general, however.\u201D</p><p>\u201C...Ah... so you don&#39;t really take physical damage, but it&#39;s mentally difficult, right?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CThat is correct.</p><p>In addition, having my head used so frivolously by such an... adolescent... angers me greatly. It disconcerts me. Mirrors are my sworn enemy, you could say.\u201D</p><p>She mutters about having an urge to break every mirror she sees.</p><p>...&quot;Such an adolescent&quot; is an unusually emotional choice of words for Rider, however.</p><hr><p>\u201CThe adolescent... you mean Perseus, right...?</p><p>Judging from your story... well, I can&#39;t call him a &quot;victim,&quot; but it does sound like he got tricked into it, no?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C...Yes, I suppose so. He was also fooled by the gods. In any case, he was a mere mosquito in my eyes at that time.</p><p>I don&#39;t feel sympathy for him, either, but...\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CBut?\u201D</p><p>\u201CPersonally, there is no way I could bring myself to like him.</p><p>Nevertheless, he did become a fine character afterwards.\u201D</p><p>\u201CHmm... What sort of a person was he?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CRight... to sum it up briefly...\u201D</p><p>Rider thinks intently, as if digging up his image from the depths of her memories.</p><p>And not long after, she raises her head, seemingly surprised at the answer she came up with herself.</p><hr><p>\u201CTo sum it up, he was a successful Shinji.\u201D</p><p>\u201C..................\u201D</p><p>Ah... that conjures up an extremely clear image in my head.</p><p>\u201CThat... really is disturbing.</p><p>Then, if there were no Kibisis...\u201D</p><hr><p>Having had the barrier turned inside out by Kibisis, Rider ended up sealed in her own Temple of Darkness.</p><p>Anyone caught in the Temple of Darkness is said to experience a nightmare that has taboo and delight both mixed in it.</p><p>...However.</p><p>I wonder what kind of a vision was it that left her with a trauma this deep...?</p><hr><p>\u201C...Say. What did you see, Rider?\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><p>\u201CAh, no, I&#39;m sorry.</p><p>A nightmare isn&#39;t something you&#39;d like to recall, much less talk about it.

It would not be fair for me to refuse.\u201D</p><p>Rider straightens her posture once again.</p><p>But she still remains hunched over ever so slightly.</p><p>...Ack. It must be an ever greater challenge to endure than the story of being beheaded.</p><p>\u201C...Well, that nightmare...\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C\u201CMeMedudusa. sa.

This girl is looking rather defiant, don&#39;t you agree, the other me? How clumsy and un-ladylike.\u201D</p><p>\u201CIndeed. It is a pity, but she will have to be punished, I suppose.\u201D</p><p>\u201CIt&#39;s all for the sake of our own beloved sister.

If that makes you angry, try to be more like us!\u201D</p><p>\u201CThe two of us can be held lovably in others&#39; arms, but the one who could lift you would be... maybe Atlas and probably no one else.\u201D</p><p>\u201CYes, that is true, but he will surely hurt his back.\u201D</p><p>\u201CDo you understand? Slim and compact are in style now. Things a farm horse like you are not.\u201D</p><p>\u201CAh, ugh... how cruel! You didn&#39;t have to put it that way!\u201D</p><p>\u201CKeke, even your crying is no good!</p><p>Your tears would feel like a flood to your male partner, surely.\u201D</p><p>\u201COh my, have some pity, other me.</p><p>Did you know? Medusa sighs every time she looks in a mirror.\u201D</p><p>\u201CThis pathetic effort is just like her, don&#39;t you think?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CSo, I was hoping to get a concave mirror from Poseidon-sama at the party tonight.\u201D</p><p>\u201CPuh, so that she can look small and lovable?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CAhahah, perfect!

Bad news just keeps on coming.</p><hr><p>\u201CFuji-Nee said she&#39;d get more sweets, but I don&#39;t know when she plans to do that. Hmm... Alright.\u201D</p><p>I double-check the contents of my wallet.</p><p>Today, I was wise enough to shop during a timed sale, so there&#39;s still a bit of cash left.

Mm. Shirou, are you shopping for dinner?\u201D</p><p>\u201CYep. Unusual seeing you here, all by yourself in the shopping district.\u201D</p><hr><p>When Saber goes shopping, I give her the wallet, but I&#39;m pretty sure that was not the case today.</p><p>Hmm, where did she get the cash...?</p><hr><p>\u201CAh... about this...\u201D</p><p>\u201CFor now, I have some shopping to do in Edomaeya.

She sure must have a lot of spending money.\u201D</p><p>...Wasn&#39;t the last payday quite a long time ago?</p><p>\u201CYes. When I met Taiga at the house, she was in an unusually good mood.</p><p>And so she said, &quot;Here, go and have an afternoon snack&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><hr><p>Ah, so that&#39;s... how it was?</p><p>\u201C...Shirou, you are looking a bit pale. Is something wrong?\u201D</p><p>\u201CNo... Nevermind. Right, Fuji-Nee...\u201D</p><hr><p>In other words, here&#39;s what probably transpired.</p><p>First, Fuji-Nee discovered our secret rainy-day stash of snacks, descending upon it like a hungry wolf on a flock of sheep.</p><p>Then, her spirits improving significantly due to her full stomach, she decides to give Saber some spending cash to spread the love.</p><hr><p>Finally, Saber would be completely baffled when me and Sakura try to wring it from Fuji-Nee.</p><p>Noticing the worried look I&#39;m getting from my side, I wave my hand to dismiss her concerns.</p><hr><p>\u201CWhat about Taiga?\u201D</p><p>\u201COh, nothing, it&#39;s just Fuji-Nee being her usual self.</p><p>Still... Now that I think about it, she&#39;s never given ME any pocket money...\u201D</p><hr><p>I think back to those times.</p><p>The old man was stubbornly attached to me as a kid, and Fuji-Nee got attached to the two of us.</p><p>We played together... or rather, she played with me, the same way she would with a toy. But I never got any spending money out of it.</p><hr><p>\u201C...Is that so?\u201D</p><p>\u201CFuji-Nee&#39;s been perpetually broke since back in the day.</p><p>That hasn&#39;t really changed even after she started work...ing?\u201D</p><hr><p>Saber suddenly freezes.</p><p>I turn to see what she&#39;s looking at\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><p>\u300ASoon it&#39;ll be Chinese steamed bun season.\u300B</p><p>The escaping steam and the aroma of the meat-filling buns make me think &quot;ah, it really is that time, isn&#39;t it?&quot;</p><hr><p>Saber reaches into her pocket.</p><p>I can hear the coins clinking around.</p><hr><p>\u201C...Muh, just a little short.</p><p>No, let us be satisfied with just obanyaki today.</p><p>I shall look forward to the steamed buns another day... instant impulse gratification weakens the body, that&#39;s right.\u201D</p><hr><p>I can hear her muttering.</p><p>There&#39;s no need to get anxious about it. You could just ask me.</p><hr><p>\u201CYou&#39;ve got steamed buns on your mind, Saber?\u201D</p><p>\u201C...No, that, that is not it at all!</p><p>If I snack any more it will ruin my appetite at dinnertime.\u201D</p><p>\u201CIt&#39;s okay, if you can&#39;t eat any more I&#39;ll take half. I&#39;ve got a bit of cash left over, so don&#39;t worry about it.\u201D</p><hr><p>My wallet won&#39;t complain just because of one or two buns.</p><p>I have Saber hold the bike while I get in line\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>\u201CAhh, so this is a meat-filled steamed bun, Shirou.\u201D</p><p>Saber&#39;s holding the bun, blowing off the steam.</p><p>\u201C...I&#39;ll need to thank Fuji-Nee...\u201D</p><p>I wouldn&#39;t have gotten to see Saber like this if Fuji-Nee wasn&#39;t so capricious.</p><hr><p>\u201CThe meat flavor locked into the steamed dough... mmm.\u201D</p><p>Stuffing her cheeks with food, Saber nods with satisfaction.</p><p>I can&#39;t make this at home, after all.</p><p>You need some kind of steamer for that, and a knack for kneading that kind of dough.</p><hr><p>\u201CWell, let&#39;s head back, Saber.\u201D</p><p>\u201C......Um, how shall I put this...\u201D</p><p>Saber fidgets while standing there.</p><p>She&#39;s still looking at the steamer.</p><hr><p>\u201CI noticed that bean-filled steamed bun over there, I wonder how does it taste?\u201D</p><p>\u201C......Okay, if you want to try it I&#39;ll go with you.\u201D</p><hr><p>My wallet can still withstand two or three steamed buns.</p><p>...Is what I&#39;d like to believe, but with all the original, pizza, curry, and special shark fin varieties, if Saber starts getting carried away, I&#39;ll have to reconsider.</p><hr><p>\u201CIt&#39;s great that the two of you are here.\u201D</p><p>\u201CRider!?\u201D</p><p>Rider suddenly appears, turning around on the Emiya residence&#39;s bike Number One.</p><p>She manages to drift, locking up the brakes.</p><p>Muh...

Hm, what is it, Rider?\u201D</p><p>Ahh, Saber, near your mouth...</p><p>Rider has to be staring at it, that&#39;s definitely not majestic.</p><hr><p>\u201C...You ate some meat-filled steamed buns, didn&#39;t you?

Five...?\u201D</p><p>\u201CAs I thought, you can&#39;t see?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C...Yes. I sealed off my magical energy with Breaker Gorgon in order to suppress my Mystic Eyes, however, losing my eyesight as well was a miscalculation.\u201D</p><p>\u201CI see, it&#39;s because of me.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CThere is no need to worry.

Don&#39;t you still have shampoo in your hair?</p><p>You got in first, so you should finish your bath properly. I can shut my eyes.\u201D</p><p>\u201CI thank you for your offer, but I cannot wash my hair while my eyes are unable to see.\u201D</p><p>......Rider, if you&#39;re that clumsy then how have you been able to... no, that&#39;s not important right now.</p><hr><p>\u201CHowever, Shirou, as long as you&#39;re unable to leave here under your own strength, there is no other choice but for me to leave.\u201D</p><p>\u201C...No. I was the one who interrupted you.</p><p>This isn&#39;t an apology for before, but since you were in the middle of washing, I&#39;ll wash your hair for you.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CYou would.... do that for me?\u201D</p><p>&quot;Yeah,&quot; I nod.</p><p>I can&#39;t move my lower half, but I can still use both my arms perfectly well.</p><hr><p>\u201C...That&#39;s true, washing this hair by myself is quite time consuming. Then, can I ask you to assist me?\u201D</p><p>\u201CGreat. Then Rider, come sit here. And make sure to have your back to me.\u201D</p><p>\u201CNnn\u30FC...... ah, there&#39;s a chair here.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CNo, wait, that&#39;s a washbasin... You&#39;re stuck!?\u201D</p><p>\u201C...khh! How misleading.\u201D</p><p>\u201CIf you use too much force you&#39;ll break it.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CWell, then I shall use my nails to tear the flesh from my bottom out of it.\u201D</p><p>\u201CWhy!?\u201D</p><p>\u201CThere is no other way.\u201D</p><p>\u201CS-S-S-S-Stop that, think it over more!</p><p>R-Right! You can use soap to slide out!\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CWouldn&#39;t it be faster to cut myself?\u201D</p><p>\u201CYou can&#39;t cut your neck or your butt! Cutting yourself isn&#39;t cool!\u201D</p><p>\u201CWhew.\u201D</p><p>\u201CIs your butt okay, Rider?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CThanks to your quick thinking, it&#39;s okay.</p><p>...ah, this shape, this is definitely a chair this time.\u201D</p><p>\u201CThat&#39;s right... wait, Wah! Don&#39;t turn this way! Don&#39;t open your legs! Back, back! Other way!\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CSure, though I don&#39;t mind either way.\u201D</p><p>\u201CI mind! ...Just turn your back this way.</p><p>Okay then...... ummm?\u201D</p><hr><p>Her hand wanders above the forest of bottles.</p><p>Saber, Tohsaka, and Sakura each have their own shampoo.

I&#39;m a bit nervous.\u201D</p><p>As I add water to her silky smooth hair, it sparkles like silver threads weaved together.</p><hr><p>They say a woman&#39;s hair is her life. In that case, isn&#39;t it only natural to obsess over the best shampoo to make it shine?</p><p>Fussing over things like scalp care, water retention, 100% all natural or drug-free coating.</p><p>Probably all the more so for Rider, since her hair is so long and pretty.</p><hr><p>\u201CIs something the matter, Shirou?\u201D</p><p>\u201CUgh, stupid, stupid, don&#39;t get self-conscious... hm, isn&#39;t this body soap?\u201D</p><p>\u201CYes, I use that one for everything.\u201D</p><p>...That&#39;s crazily sports-minded.</p><hr><p>\u201CWhat are you using to wash your hair!?\u201D</p><p>\u201CI believe that it should be sufficient for being around the house, but... is there something wrong with that?\u201D</p><p>There should be a limit to how roughly you treat yourself.</p><p>Her hair is already so nice, it&#39;s a waste to treat it like this!</p><hr><p>\u201C...For goodness&#39; sake.</p><p>Rider, can you grab the third and fourth bottles from the left?\u201D</p><p>\u201CDoesn&#39;t this belong to Rin?\u201D</p><p>\u201CAs landlord, I will permit you to borrow it for today.\u201D</p><p>For just this one time, I will thoroughly wash Rider&#39;s hair using Tohsaka&#39;s expensive looking shampoo.</p><hr><p>I squirt the liquid into my palm.</p><p>Considering that she has such long hair, I wonder how much shampoo I should use\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><p>Well, using too much shouldn&#39;t be a problem.</p><hr><p>\u201CAlright, I&#39;m gonna start from the scalp.\u201D</p><p>\u201CI&#39;ll leave it to you...... nnh.\u201D</p><p>Rider stiffens her body. Did the feeling of the cool shampoo startle her?</p><p>The shampoo spreads out as it permeated into her hair and began to foam at my fingers.</p><hr><p>\u201CWhen I see it in my hands like this, you really do have an amazing amount of hair.\u201D</p><p>\u201CIndeed, and the weight increases as it absorbs water.</p><p>Would it be easier to understand if I said it was like having another person clinging to your head?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CWow, that&#39;s surreal. Washing this by yourself would take a while right?\u201D</p><p>\u201CWell yes... I don&#39;t mind if you are a bit rougher, by the way.</p><p>You can also stop midway if your hands get tired. Since you have to wait for the petrification to wear off.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CIdiot. If I did that we&#39;d both catch colds.\u201D</p><p>\u201CI won&#39;t catch a cold.

Fufu, you&#39;re like a beautician.\u201D</p><p>\u201CYeah. I&#39;ve managed to get the hang of this.\u201D</p><p>\u201CWhat about you Shirou, doesn&#39;t your waist hurt with such a posture?\u201D</p><p>\u201CIt&#39;s fine, my bottom half is firmly rooted in place. It&#39;s kind of like I&#39;m just sitting down.\u201D</p><p>\u201CIs that so...? Fua...mm...\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CMm... fu... fufu...\u201D</p><p>Before I knew it, the weaving loom suddenly changes into a music box.</p><p>Rider&#39;s hair seemed to stretch on forever, and the music seemed to last just as long.</p><hr><p>\u201CHm?\u201D</p><p>Something tickles the palm of my hand.</p><p>The foam-covered hair slipped from my fingers, and I saw unexpected movement.</p><hr><p>\u201C...Huh?\u201D</p><p>Following some kind of rhythm, the hair finally flows off from my arms.</p><p>Reluctantly, I stopped the performance and stretched out my hands as if to gather the sounds that fell.</p><hr><p>\u201CEh? Oh\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><p>However, the hair continued to squirm away as if it had suddenly come to life.</p><p>I chase after the hair as it moves from right to left and back again.</p><hr><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015Then I noticed, it wasn&#39;t just the one bundle of hair.</p><p>Around me, all of the hair was dancing.</p><hr><p>\u201CKufufu, that tickles. Shirou, I can wash my own body.\u201D</p><p>\u201CHuh?\u201D</p><p>\u201CMm... haah, you&#39;re pretty bold to touch even there.\u201D</p><p>\u201CW-W-Whaaa!?</p><p>I-I&#39;m not! Aah, just where is this perverted hair going!?\u201D</p><hr><p>It&#39;s like trying to grab eels.</p><p>No matter how much I grab it, her hair always wriggles free.</p><p>Ah, wasn&#39;t Medusa&#39;s hair...</p><hr><p>\u201CAh... so it&#39;s startled because of the shampoo?\u201D</p><p>\u201CEh? What the, aaah, oooh......?\u201D</p><p>\u201CNo, perhaps they&#39;re embarrassed to have Shirou touching them so tenderly?\u201D</p><hr><p>Rider smiles and giggles in a good mood.</p><p>I, on the other hand, was busy grabbing at the slithering hair with both hands not having a clue of what to do here, I was literally eating foam.</p><hr><p>\u201C<em>gurgle</em> Rider?</p><p>Sorry, but this is a little\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><p>\u201CWell, what should I do? After all, I can&#39;t see anything.\u201D</p><p>\u201CAren&#39;t you the one controlling all this, Rider?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CNo, of course not.</p><p>In truth, Shirou, aren&#39;t you just using my hair as an excuse to touch me?\u201D</p><p>\u201CWha...aa!?\u201D</p><p>Even though I understand, that&#39;s still so cruel.</p><hr><p>\u201CWell whatever, muh, huf, hah...\u201D</p><p>I&#39;m slowly getting the hang of it.</p><p>I extend my arm in the direction her hair escapes to, but instead of grabbing, I lift it. And then, when it is just about to slip away, I quickly grab it and lift it once more with my entire arm.</p><p>Basically, it&#39;s like handling snakes.</p><hr><p>\u201CHumph, umph, ooh, there... how&#39;s that?\u201D</p><p>As my arms are insufficient, I provide my back as a destination for the hair as well.</p><p>Whenever the hair stops moving, I stop as well.</p><p>I dubiously twist my body like a snake-charmer and do my best to get used to the sensation of touching it.</p><p>...But how am I supposed to start washing her hair again like this?</p><hr><p>\u201CFufufu...\u201D</p><p>Perhaps from finally realizing the struggles I was facing, Rider&#39;s body shakes from the laughter she is restraining.</p><hr><p>\u201CCan you really not see anything?\u201D</p><p>\u201CYes, that&#39;s why I won&#39;t notice no matter which part of me you look at.\u201D</p><p>\u201CIdi...! I-I&#39;m telling you I&#39;m not looking!\u201D</p><p>\u201CHeh, I know.\u201D</p><hr><p>The hair escaped from my fingers and changed direction, this time aiming for my shoulders.</p><hr><p>\u201CUgh\u2015\u2015\u2015ah.\u201D</p><p>The hair covered in shampoo felt less like snakes, and more like long tentacles as they lick against my skin.</p><p>Before I knew it, my whole arm was wrapped by hair.</p><hr><p>\u201CRider, I can&#39;t wash your hair like this.\u201D</p><p>The waterlogged hair was heavy, it couldn&#39;t move up my arm very far.</p><p>Instead, it has been twining and coiling around my abdomen and chest.</p><hr><p>\u201Cgh...!\u201D</p><p>My body involuntarily bends back.</p><p>Suddenly, an indescribably pleasant feeling bursts forth from the center of my body.</p><p>Rider&#39;s hair was softly dashing against me, licking along my spine.</p><hr><p>\u201CFuu, that&#39;s odd... I feel as though I&#39;m drunk.\u201D</p><p>\u201CEhh?\u201D</p><p>While I&#39;m unable to move with my top half sealed by hair and the bottom by stone, Rider leans her back against me.</p><hr><p>\u201CI shouldn&#39;t become tipsy or drunk no matter how much alcohol I drink though...\u201D</p><p>\u201CI see... maybe it&#39;s because of Tohsaka?\u201D</p><p>\u201CUm, did Rin do something?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CI used Tohsaka&#39;s shampoo in your hair.</p><p>She once told me that the hair of a female magus is their final trump card.\u201D</p><p>And also that the ribbons she uses to tie it with are suitable magical artifacts.</p><hr><p>\u201CSo, Tohsaka&#39;s shampoo might have something special in... Wawaah.\u201D</p><p>The ends of Rider&#39;s hair start to peck in the recess of my armpits and nip at my sides.</p><p>They were slimy and ticklish, it feels so good that I&#39;m getting excited.</p><p>I&#39;m relieved that it didn&#39;t cause any embarrassing physiological phenomenon, thanks to the fact that my lower half had been turned to stone.</p><hr><p>\u201CI see\uFF5E, that&#39;s... a good idea.\u201D</p><p>\u201CUuah... what is?\u201D</p><p>\u201CInstead of doing nothing... while you&#39;re washing my hair... I&#39;ll wash your body... It&#39;s two birds with one stone.\u201D</p><p>That&#39;s crazily sports-minded... or maybe not.</p><p>\u201CWait, that&#39;s too... Aah!\u201D</p><hr><p>The tightly packed flesh-like hair was stuffing it&#39;s cheeks with my fingers, licking between them, swallowing them deeply and spitting them out.</p><p>...This is bad.

Please let me hear more, Shirou.\u201D</p><p>The music box and cylinder exchange roles.</p><hr><p>\u201CUwa... aah...\u201D</p><p>The gears keep moving.</p><p>My entire body is covered by comb teeth, with a caress that fully stimulated the tips of my senses scattered throughout, drawing out immodest sounds from me.</p><hr><p>\u201CThis is so... ugh... nngh...\u201D</p><p>The gears keep moving.</p><p>In this bathroom shrouded in steam, I discover sounds from a place inside me I had never known, and my mind goes blank from the shame and excitement.</p><hr><p>\u201CFuu, not yet, just your voice is not enough...</p><p>Show me more of your face... Shirou.\u201D</p><p>Is Rider also feeling more drunk from improved blood circulation?</p><p>My eyes narrow comfortably as my head falls against Rider.</p><hr><p>\u201CMmm... fua... Shirou, that&#39;s... my...\u201D</p><p>I reach out my hand to support myself as I start losing consciousness, but my fingers unintentionally arrive at something soft.</p><p>Reaching out to anything I could, my unstable fingers dig into that soft something.</p><hr><p>\u201CShirou...

Sure, what is it?\u201D</p><hr><p>Tohsaka&#39;s room is as disorganized as ever.</p><p>...I just started talking to her without setting the mood or anything, but with Tohsaka it&#39;s better to be straightforward.</p><p>If I&#39;m roundabout in asking her, she&#39;ll probably make unreasonable demands on me again.</p><hr><p>\u201CI came to ask you something.</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015Tohsaka, you remember that promise to go to the pool?\u201D</p><p>\u201C?

Well, you could say that.\u201D</p><p>Seeing as it has come to this, I know I won&#39;t be able to face her at the pool with only half-hearted determination.</p><p>Of course, the desire to see Tohsaka half-naked is an ample source of resolve.</p><hr><p>\u201C...Fine, then.</p><p>So, Emiya-kun, did you bring a swimsuit? Don&#39;t you think it would be a little lame if both of us were wearing our school competition swimsuits?\u201D</p><p>\u201COf course I have my own. Tohsaka, you&#39;re really nagging me like you&#39;re my wife.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CIs that not good enough for you?\u201D</p><p>\u201CNah, it&#39;s not that I have a problem with it, but I thought you would. Well, it&#39;s hard to say...\u201D</p><hr><p>A school swimsuit would be no fun at all.</p><p>Uh, I mean that in itself is fine, since it does bring out the body&#39;s curves splendidly, but wouldn&#39;t one wear something more brilliant and showy for water leisure- wait! But that navy blue certainly has its charms! After all, simple is best, like the beauty of an unspoiled wildflower, right...!?</p><hr><p>\u201C......I see.</p><p>If that&#39;s how it is, I don&#39;t mind.\u201D</p><p>If Tohsaka&#39;s fine with it, then there&#39;s nothing wrong with the school swimsuit.</p><hr><p>\u201C......Sorry. I was kidding just now.</p><p>What&#39;s wrong, Emiya-kun? Normally you&#39;d get all flustered and tell me to quit it just about now, but it looks like you&#39;ve got something else in mind.</p><p>Speaking of which, you&#39;ve been acting weird for a while. Really weird.

And as promised, I&#39;ll have you wear your swimsuit for me.\u201D</p><p>I mention it again.</p><p>For some reason, Tohsaka gulps and says,</p><hr><p>\u201CFine, as you wish.

I invited you with that in mind.\u201D</p><p>Aren&#39;t you the one who asked me if I was &quot;prepared&quot; in the first place?</p><p>\u201CI-I know that. I was just making sure!</p><p>...Fine, a promise is a promise. I-I don&#39;t want to hear any complaints from you after this!\u201D</p><hr><p>And with that she chases me from the room.</p><p>Tohsaka needs to get ready, so we&#39;ll meet by the doorway in half an hour.</p><p>And that&#39;s how I set that promise into motion.</p><p>...You never know what might happen, after all. Better sooner than later.</p><hr><p>\u201CWell, we&#39;re heading out. Take care of the house for me.\u201D</p><p>\u201CLook forward to some souvenirs, everyone!\u201D</p><p>\u201CUh, we&#39;re only going to Shinto.

Just felt like saying it.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015And so...</p><p>That pent-up cheerfulness gradually simmered down to a self-conscious silence.</p><p>I expected nothing more from myself, but I didn&#39;t think Tohsaka would be so quiet.</p><hr><p>\u201CT-Then, shall we?</p><p>Oh, about the tickets, I got some for free.\u201D</p><p>\u201CReally? T-That&#39;s nice.\u201D</p><p>...What&#39;s this?</p><p>Something&#39;s off. Tohsaka&#39;s being unusually meek.</p><hr><p>\u201C...Mmhm. There&#39;s Waku Waku Splash now.</p><p>...I&#39;m so pathetic. Getting nervous now of all times...\u201D</p><p>\u201CHm? Did you say something, Tohsaka?\u201D</p><p>\u201CN-Not really. It&#39;s my first time going, so I&#39;m hoping to be impressed.</p><p>A-And Emiya-kun, you sure look happy.\u201D</p><p>I guess Tohsaka isn&#39;t interested in Waku Waku Splash at all right now.</p><p>But then she seems to mull it over for a second, turns back to face me, and gets fired up.</p><hr><p>\u201COkay, let&#39;s go!</p><p>Shirou, I hope you&#39;re ready for this!\u201D</p><p>\u201CSure.

They really made this.\u201D</p><p>Artificial summer sunlight.</p><p>Azure sparkling as far as the eye can see.</p><p>As far as I could tell, the ad looked fake, but now I&#39;m honestly impressed.</p><hr><p>\u201CI&#39;ll concede, people would definitely come here even in October.\u201D</p><p>After all, it&#39;s like a tropical dome here.</p><p>If they went this far to recreate the atmosphere of fun in the sun, I think anyone would want to relive their summer memories here.</p><hr><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015Okay.\u201D</p><p>I pull out a beach chair to wait for Tohsaka.</p><p>Compared to guys, girls take a long time to change.</p><hr><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015Tohsaka&#39;s swimsuit, huh...?</p><p>I really want to see it... but maybe I should think about what absurd conditions she&#39;s going to lay on me.</p><hr><p>\u201C..................\u201D</p><p>I can&#39;t get careless. On top of the amusement she gets out of humiliating me, her years of experience also give her an advantage.</p><p>Well, whatever.</p><p>No need to over-think things. For now I&#39;ll just wait for her to come out.</p><hr><p>With her style and figure, Tohsaka would definitely draw attention in public.</p><p>With that much commotion, there&#39;s no way she could sneak up on...</p><p>\u201C...............\u201D</p><p>...Just now, I think I glimpsed a teruterubozu doll in the corner of my eye.</p><hr><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Oh yeah.\u201D</p><p>There&#39;s no mistake.</p><p>That white figure fluttering over there is Tohsaka.</p><p>It&#39;s... rather odd for a swimsuit.</p><hr><p>\u201CHeeey, Tohsaka... wait! Don&#39;t run away!\u201D</p><p>Tohsaka stops at my call and reluctantly shuffles over.</p><hr><p>\u201CS-Stop yelling! What if we run into someone I know!?\u201D</p><p>\u201CWhat are you talking about? Anyone can tell who you are from a distance.</p><p>And what is that supposed to be?\u201D</p><hr><p>Tohsaka is standing in front of me, covered in a white bath towel.</p><p>It&#39;s like she&#39;s wearing a poncho.</p><p>...Don&#39;t tell me THAT&#39;S her swimsuit?</p><hr><p>\u201C...C-Can&#39;t you tell?\u201D</p><p>\u201CI can. That&#39;s definitely one of our bath towels.\u201D</p><p>\u201COh. Yeah, I borrowed this.\u201D</p><hr><p>Of course you did.</p><p>But it&#39;s not where the towel came from that I&#39;m wondering about.</p><p>I wanna know what&#39;s under it.</p><hr><p>\u201CTohsaka. You promised me you would let me see you in a swimsuit today.\u201D</p><p>\u201C......I plan to.</p><p>But hey, Shirou? Why don&#39;t we do this fairly?\u201D</p><hr><p>&quot;Fairly&quot;... Hiding behind a towel isn&#39;t fair to begin with.</p><p>She likes using that word. I do not think it means what she thinks it means.</p><hr><p>\u201C...What&#39;s &quot;fair&quot; supposed to mean here?\u201D</p><p>\u201CW-Well, if you suddenly see my swimsuit, you&#39;d have no choice but to accept my conditions, right?</p><p>S-So it would only be fair to let you have an opportunity to refuse, as well.\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015I see. So that&#39;s it.\u201D</p><hr><p>Maybe that&#39;s Tohsaka&#39;s way of being nice.</p><p>I thought she was just being random, but turns out she&#39;s actually giving me one last chance to back out.</p><hr><p>\u201C...Hmm. And what if I do refuse, Tohsaka?\u201D</p><p>\u201CThat&#39;s something you don&#39;t need to worry about.</p><p>W-Well then, let&#39;s start the contract. M-My conditions for you are\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><hr><p>I hold my breath, listening intently.</p><p>\u201C...For today, you have to obey everything I say!\u201D</p><p>Oh. Wait, that&#39;s it?</p><hr><p>\u201CSure. That&#39;s actually pretty easy.\u201D</p><p>\u201CWha... Hey, this is absolute obedience! Absolute!</p><p>Like a Servant or a butler or a footman! Do you really understand!?\u201D</p><p>\u201CYeah, I do. Isn&#39;t that how it&#39;s been all the way until now?\u201D</p><hr><p>It&#39;s not much of a bargaining point if you ask me, but if that&#39;s all she wants I&#39;ll gladly take it.</p><p>And here I was afraid she was going to make impossible requests, or otherwise trap me in those evil genius schemes I know her all too well for.</p><p>...Nope, sometimes it&#39;s nice to be wrong.</p><hr><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015N-Now that you mention it, you&#39;re right. Since it is my swimsuit we&#39;re talking about here, maybe I should add a twist...\u201D</p><p>\u201CNo no, I think this is best.</p><p>So, what now? If you&#39;re worried about me holding up my side I can swear an oath or get it down on paper.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C...There&#39;s no need to go that far. I know you don&#39;t break your promises.\u201D</p><p>She knows me well.</p><p>Now it&#39;s a fair exchange.</p><p>Which means it&#39;s Tohsaka&#39;s turn.</p><hr><p>\u201C..................\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><p>This is awkward.</p><p>I feel like I&#39;m on the verge of realizing a great accomplishment, but I can&#39;t make that last step.</p><hr><p>\u201C...gh.\u201D</p><p>But at this rate Tohsaka will definitely get angry.</p><p>I can&#39;t prove it, but I trust my instincts on this.</p><p>\u201C...Ahem.\u201D</p><p>I clear my throat once.</p><p>She&#39;s being uncharacteristically timid and you could cut the tension with a knife, but I have to say something!</p><hr><p>\u201CW-Well! So the contract is now made.</p><p>...Umm, how should I put this? I... really want to see you in your swimsuit.\u201D</p><hr><p>;</p><p>My throat goes dry, like I&#39;ve just swallowed dry ice.</p><p>Wait, that would kill me.</p><p>As if it were actually summer, the sounds of splashing waves are unbelievably loud.</p><hr><p>\u201C..................Stupid.\u201D</p><p>And...</p><p>The white towel falls away.</p><hr><p>Dazzling bright red.</p><p>A supple body wrapped in crimson.</p><p>...Like lemon in tea, like birds in the sky, like salt and pepper near a frying pan.</p><p>The swimsuit hugs Tohsaka Rin like they were meant to be.</p><hr><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><p>...Crap. I&#39;m blushing from all the stimulation.</p><p>To be honest, I&#39;ve always suspected that people like me are less interested in the opposite sex than they should be.</p><p>But let me just say I&#39;ve been proven wrong about all that right here...!</p><hr><p>\u201C......So? Are you satisfied, Shirou?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015Loading comments.</p><p>I-I need to hurry and regain my senses and lock up the animal within me...!</p><hr><p>\u201CSay something, moron! Seriously.\u201D</p><p>\u201CGah... Uh, no, that, wait, sorry?\u201D</p><p>\u201CNow you&#39;re apologizing?</p><p>What&#39;s wrong, Shirou?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CN-Nothing&#39;s wrong! All I&#39;m saying is that tasty things are tasty, no, wait, dammit, this is hard to say but it looks good on you! You look so good I feel like it&#39;s a waste!\u201D</p><p>\u201CWell, that&#39;s interesting. Are you saying I&#39;m wasted on the swimsuit? Or that the bikini is wasted on me?\u201D</p><p>\u201CD-D-D-Don&#39;t be stupid! I mean I&#39;m not worthy to see it!\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CThank you. But you know what, Emiya-kun? You&#39;re definitely worth it.</p><p>You know, if I were to judge you as a girl, maybe I&#39;d say you have a pretty hot build yourself.\u201D</p><p>She giggles happily.</p><p>W-Wait, what&#39;s a &quot;hot build&quot;...?</p><hr><p>\u201CW-Well, I do work out.</p><p>...If we&#39;re together, I&#39;d rather be taller than more muscular.\u201D</p><p>If I was just 5 cm taller, then Tohsaka probably wouldn&#39;t be embarrassed to be seen with me.</p><hr><p>\u201CIt&#39;s okay, I know you&#39;ll keep growing... Thanks, Shirou.\u201D</p><p>\u201C? For what?\u201D</p><p>\u201CIt&#39;s a secret.</p><p>Anyway, negotiations are officially over! Get ready, because now the fun really starts!\u201D</p><hr><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015And so...</p><p>We went back to treating her like a princess, as usual.</p><hr><p>...</p><p>It&#39;s summer.</p><p>It might be October, but there&#39;s no doubt that this world is soaking in summertime.</p><p>The setup in this all-weather indoor resort isn&#39;t enough to describe it. This room, this atmosphere... is the essence of summer.</p><p>I&#39;m carrying a tray with tropical drinks.</p><p>As for Tohsaka\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>\u201CHeheh, this feels a little like Paradise.\u201D</p><p>She floats happily, without a care in the world.</p><hr><p>\u201CWhat&#39;s wrong, Emiya-kun? You look like something&#39;s bothering you.\u201D</p><p>\u201C...Nothing. A promise is a promise, right?\u201D</p><hr><p>While Tohsaka relaxes, I&#39;m playing butler.</p><p>Standing there, patiently holding a tray in one hand must look particularly odd against the leisurely surroundings.</p><p>As far as absolute obedience goes, this is well within my limits, but... once I come to my senses, it&#39;s not like I&#39;ll have no regrets doing this at a neighborhood pool.</p><hr><p>\u201CHmmm, this is great... I was just about fed up with that place. It&#39;s so depressing.\u201D</p><p>\u201CYou mean England?\u201D</p><p>\u201CYup, foggy London... sure, it sounds romantic, but it&#39;s really just cold and damp all the time.</p><p>If I had to vacation there, I&#39;d rather pick the City of Flowers. And if not Paris, then anywhere with a hot spring nearby would do.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CAre you serious? Paris aside, I don&#39;t think the Beppu or Kusatsu hot spring resorts would appreciate being known for having a magus around.\u201D</p><p>\u201CWe were mingling with the scholars in Kamakura, you know? That was back in my grandfather&#39;s time though.\u201D</p><hr><p>Kamakura scholars? What century are we in again?</p><p>Aside from Kiritsugu, Tohsaka, and the Matou, I don&#39;t know much about the other magi in this country. It&#39;s the first I&#39;ve heard of them.</p><hr><p>\u201CAnyway, after being deprived of the sun for so long, I need a vacation.</p><p>Mmmm, I love summer. I wish I could just relax like this all the time.\u201D</p><hr><p>She slowly floats up and down\u2015\u2015</p><p>Tohsaka seems to enjoy floating in the pool.</p><p>The water&#39;s warm, and the rhythm of the waves is soothing.</p><p>Of course, I&#39;m just standing in it.</p><hr><p>\u201C<em>yawn</em>...... Hmm, Shirou?\u201D</p><p>\u201CWhat? Want me to push you out further?\u201D</p><p>\u201CNo... I was wondering if you wanted to go back with me.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CIt&#39;s nice to come home for the holidays, but why don&#39;t we go to the beach over there?\u201D</p><p>\u201CThe beach, huh... they have those in England?\u201D</p><p>\u201CYeah, but just sunbathing in the sand is no fun.</p><p>If we go, we might as well visit southern France, like C\xF4te d&#39;Azur or the Aegean Sea. The Mediterranean is supposed to be just gorgeous!\u201D</p><hr><p>Tohsaka banters on.</p><p>...A vacation in the Mediterranean, huh...? As lame as it is, I can&#39;t think of anything besides a blue ocean and a white beach.</p><p>And being alone with Tohsaka... Crap, I shouldn&#39;t imagine any further.</p><hr><p>\u201CThat&#39;s pretty out there... What&#39;s the Mediterranean like?\u201D</p><p>\u201CIt&#39;s like a paradise on Earth, I&#39;m sure.\u201D</p><p>\u201CA paradise, is it?\u2015\u2015\u2015The untouched beauty of the past.</p><p>I am also familiar with that area. Milos, Crete, Paros and Naxos, right?\u201D</p><p>Wait. What was that, that strange answer filled with emotion.</p><hr><p>\u201CUwaa! What the!\u201D</p><p>An amazingly beautiful woman, one that would turn heads.</p><p>She&#39;s wearing a swimsuit and not wearing glasses, but she&#39;s\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>\u201C...Rider!?\u201D</p><p>\u201CHello, Shirou, Rin.</p><p>How unexpected to see you here.\u201D</p><hr><p>A laughing and smiling Rider in a swimsuit... Am I dreaming?</p><p>I can even see her eyes. And I am not turning into a chunk of rock.</p><hr><p>\u201CRider, your glasses... no, why are you here?\u201D</p><p>\u201CWell, I just came to relax and play here. Just like you and Rin.\u201D</p><hr><p>Oh. Whenever she has free time, Rider always seems to be engrossed in reading, so having her come to the pool is a bit unexpected.</p><hr><p>\u201C...I did not mean to interfere with your day, but since you brought up my former home, I couldn&#39;t help but join in.\u201D</p><p>\u201CNo, well, I guess... no, wait.\u201D</p><hr><p>I observe Rider&#39;s swimsuit as stealthily as I can. Seeing Tohsaka was enough to make my head blank already, and Rider&#39;s no less competitive in that regard.</p><p>Or rather, the effect is different.</p><p>Hiding an ideal adult female figure with such little material should be considered criminal.</p><hr><p>\u201CIs there something odd about me?\u201D</p><p>\u201CNo, not at all, you&#39;re perfect, PERFECT.\u201D</p><p>Translated into punch-force equivalent, this one&#39;s coming in at around one ton.</p><hr><p>\u201CIs that so. Being praised by you raises my confidence a bit.\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><p>Even if you ignore the swimsuit, having Rider smile like this is rare.</p><p>Being taken in by this sight is also a given\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>\u201CUh, but what I meant to ask...</p><p>Rider, are you by yourself today?\u201D</p><p>\u201CYes, I am simply taking some time off.</p><p>I came here to tail you and Rin\u2015\u2015\u2015is what I would like to say, but, unfortunately, this time was just a coincidence.\u201D</p><hr><p>To tail us\u2015\u2015\u2015I can think of only one person who would ask that of Rider.</p><hr><p>\u201CWell, I am probably bothering you, so I shall go for a swim over there.</p><p>Please take your time, the two of you\u2015\u2015\u2015Later. If you would like to know more about the Aegean, do not hesitate to ask.\u201D</p><hr><p>And, without causing a single ripple, she disappears into the water, swimming away quickly... Her style is vaguely non-human-like, but also fitting.</p><p>As I keep looking in her direction... Ah, she&#39;s not coming up. Rider swims like a water serpent, vanishing swiftly into the water.</p><hr><p>\u201C...Hey, Emiya-kun?\u201D</p><p>?</p><p>Floating in her swim ring, Tohsaka does not look happy.</p><hr><p>\u201CAh, Rider was just here...\u201D</p><p>\u201CI know, I was also surprised. I didn&#39;t think we&#39;d actually meet someone we know.\u201D</p><p>\u201CYeah, Rider was amazing. I wonder what happened to her Mystic Eyes? She wasn&#39;t wearing her glasses.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CAh, don&#39;t worry.</p><p>She had hard contact lenses made to suit her outfit... wait, that&#39;s not what I&#39;m talking about!\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CEmiya-kun? You were looking at Rider rather intensely, weren&#39;t you?\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015Ack.\u201D</p><p>Those sharp eyes of hers... I have to tread carefully.</p><p>Looks like she&#39;s well aware of what her butler&#39;s doing even if he&#39;s behind her back.</p><hr><p>\u201CI know, you&#39;re not the only one who thinks Rider&#39;s amazing. I&#39;m not even sure if I feel jealous or just shocked anymore.\u201D</p><p>\u201C...Oui. I am delighted to have your understanding.\u201D</p><p>Still in &quot;absolute obedience&quot; mode, I reply butler-like.</p><hr><p>\u201CInteresting... Then, what part of Rider did you see first?\u201D</p><p>\u201C........................Where, may you ask?\u201D</p><hr><p>I&#39;m losing my composure under the pressure of my master&#39;s... I mean, Tohsaka&#39;s relentless interrogation.</p><p>The spot I looked at first is meant to be the part I was most fascinated with, in all likelihood.</p><p>......It&#39;s really a difficult question.</p><hr><p>\u201COh, I just wanted to know if we looked at the same thing, honest\uFF5E\u201D</p><p>\u201C...Well, but of course.\u201D</p><p>If I lie, she&#39;ll definitely find out.</p><p>It&#39;s only natural for a guy.</p><p>Indeed, the very first thing I saw was...</p><hr><p>\u201C...Your face is red? Oh you, Emiya-kun.\u201D</p><p>\u201CYeah, I&#39;m blushing. Who wouldn&#39;t?\u201D</p><p>A pool is that sort of place.</p><p>It is rude not to be fascinated by a woman&#39;s body!</p><hr><p>\u201COh, you answered honestly. Good boy!\u201D</p><p>\u201CI humbly accept your praise... wait, where did you look, Tohsaka?\u201D</p><p>\u201C...The same as you, I guess.\u201D</p><p>She splashes and kicks her feet.</p><p>I wonder... is she sulking?</p><hr><p>\u201CSeeing such perfection, I can&#39;t help but feel inadequate myself. And then she has that body thing going on, you know?\u201D</p><p>The parts that should be out, go out; the parts that should be in, go in; and the parts that should be long, stretch out longer. A truly perfect body... Ahh, I guess it&#39;s sort of how I feel about Archer or Lancer&#39;s height.</p><hr><p>\u201CAnd here I was all worked up about finally having a chance to surprise you, Emiya-kun.</p><p>Well, it&#39;s Rider, it can&#39;t be helped. Things go wrong at just the critical moment, as always.\u201D</p><p>She sighs.</p><hr><p>\u201CIs that so? If you ask me who&#39;s better, I&#39;d say you are the cuter one, Tohsaka.\u201D</p><p>I try to get her to acknowledge the fact herself.</p><hr><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><p>...D-Damn.</p><p>I said it without thinking, and now I&#39;m blushing at my own frankness.</p><hr><p>\u201C...Ahh... hey, Tohsaka.\u201D</p><p>I call out to break the unbearable silence.</p><p>L-Lending a hand when their master is at a loss is the duty of a butler...!</p><hr><p>\u201CSure, Rider is pretty, but not as much as you were, Tohsaka, when I saw you in your swimsuit.\u201D</p><p>\u201C...That kind of flattery is unlike you.\u201D</p><p>\u201CIt&#39;s not flattery. Could I ever pull off something so convenient!?\u201D</p><p>That&#39;s right. Clumsiness, in its own way, knows when it&#39;s time to set things right.</p><hr><p>\u201CListen, no matter how pretty Rider is in her swimsuit, I don&#39;t feel anything welling up inside me. All I can do is admire her.</p><p>...I mean, look. It&#39;s kind of bad to say about Rider, but it&#39;s the feeling you get when you look at Mt. Fuji or Niagara Falls.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C...Okay. Somehow, I get what you&#39;re trying to say.\u201D</p><p>\u201CRight. But when I saw you, Tohsaka, I was simply happy.</p><p>It&#39;s not that you win or lose in chest or figure, but you were very Tohsaka-like. I just don&#39;t know a way to put it in words...\u201D</p><p>I nervously stir the water around my waist.</p><p>Tohsaka is also watching me attentively as she floats.</p><hr><p>\u201C...To put it rudely: seeing you, Tohsaka, actually made me excited.\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015W-What are you saying in this kind of place? Geez...!\u201D</p><p>I-It&#39;s just as embarrassing for me, so can&#39;t you put up with it for a bit? Wait, why am I seriously elaborating this!?</p><hr><p>\u201CI-I don&#39;t mean it in the direct way, okay?</p><p>Anyway, you have plenty of charm. My heart&#39;s throbbing even now, and there&#39;s no need to worry about Rider at all!</p><p>Also, time is passing way too fast! It&#39;s already afternoon!\u201D</p><p>\u201C........................\u201D</p><hr><p>Errgh, I can&#39;t stop by myself!</p><p>I&#39;m too embarrassed, I want to take this float and carry Tohsaka away with it somewhere...!</p><p>\u201CTch, wait, calm down, calm down now.\u201D</p><p>That is improper for a butler.</p><p>&quot;Haa, hoo,&quot; I take two deep breaths.</p><hr><p>\u201C......And that was a glimpse into the depth of your butler&#39;s mind.</p><p>That&#39;s how I feel. I have no objections against you forcing me into complete obedience, and I even manage to enjoy it, in a way.\u201D</p><hr><p>Serving someone I actually desire.</p><p>There&#39;s a warm and fuzzy feeling of something like dominance emanating from it.</p><p>I feel I have a lot to be embarrassed by in what I just said, but for now, I just clear my throat and assume my waiting position once again.</p><hr><p>\u201CTohsaka...?\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015Geez. It&#39;s not like I can just ditch you and go off somewhere myself, either.\u201D</p><p>Murmuring something odd, Tohsaka gets out of the float ring.</p><hr><p>\u201CI did say that my hands are still burning.</p><p>...Well, I was the one to blame, though.\u201D</p><hr><p>Tohsaka shrugs with indifference.</p><p>That seemed to be a reflection not on me, but on Tohsaka herself.</p><p>...And then.</p><p>\u201CT-Tohsaka!?\u201D</p><p>\u201CIt&#39;s fine. We&#39;re in a pool, this much is nothing out of ordinary.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CKh\u2015\u2015\u2015!\u201D</p><p>W-Was this girl listening?! I just confessed that I am still excited, didn&#39;t I?!</p><hr><p>\u201COh, your heart&#39;s racing. You really were holding it in, weren&#39;t you, Emiya-kun.\u201D</p><p>\u201CT-That&#39;s what I was saying! So give me a little space here.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CNo way\uFF5E. And also, I just realized something.</p><p>Right, because you&#39;re still such a novice, it&#39;s my job to be the busybody, no matter what.</p><p>This is a duty that not even Rider nor Saber can get in the way of.\u201D</p><hr><p>She smiles sweetly.</p><p>\u201C............\u201D</p><p>...Honestly, that smile alone fascinated me from the bottom of my heart.</p><hr><p>\u201C...Keh. My apologies for being such a novice.\u201D</p><p>I grumble in a butler voice.</p><p>\u201CSure. If you&#39;re frustrated by it, then become a man that can sweep me off my feet. I&#39;ll be looking forward to that day, alright, Mr. Butler?\u201D</p><hr><p>So that is also a part of the right of absolute obedience.</p><p>...To think that a full-fledged magus also ought to be a gentleman... I had no idea. This might be a really valuable pool date.</p><hr><p>\u201CWell then, talk about the future is over. Shall we enjoy today&#39;s pool now?</p><p>Come, they have a waterslide here, don&#39;t they? We&#39;ll be riding that first, then... Wow, they even have beach volleyball! Let&#39;s get Rider and play volleyball!\u201D</p><hr><p>&quot;Yoo-hoo!&quot; she runs off merrily.</p><p>\u201CYes, yes. I shall accompany you, of course.\u201D</p><p>As a butler, the option of disobedience does not cross my mind.</p><p>I too shall enjoy this to my heart&#39;s content.</p><p>After all, there is less than five hours to go until closing time.</p><p>I&#39;m sure the afternoon will go by in the blink of an eye, just like the morning did.</p><hr><p>\u201CAah, I had so much fun.\u201D</p><p>\u201C..................Are you satisfied, Tohsaka?\u201D</p><hr><p>I managed to keep up with Tohsaka&#39;s over the top nonsense.</p><p>In the end, we played beach volleyball with some oddly familiar-looking tough guys.</p><p>I was told to &quot;make us win, Shirou&quot;... Even though I&#39;m pretty sure our opponents weren&#39;t human to begin with.</p><hr><p>\u201C...You put up a pretty determined fight there, Tohsaka.\u201D</p><p>\u201CThat&#39;s because my family tells me to never let up, no matter the competition. But we just weren&#39;t tall enough, were we.\u201D</p><hr><p>...To beat those in two in height would take someone like Kuzuki-sensei or the late priest, Kotomine.</p><p>And with Tohsaka trying to match their momentum while wearing a bikini, the onlookers got very excited.</p><p>To sum it up, we may have lost the game, but we won in style instead.</p><hr><p>\u201CWhew... Oh yeah, Tohsaka.\u201D</p><p>\u201CWhat&#39;s wrong? Do you need to head down to the shopping district for something?\u201D</p><p>\u201CNo, not that. Our &quot;absolute obedience&quot; deal, when does it expire?\u201D</p><hr><p>The deal I made with Tohsaka was for all of today.</p><p>Returning from the pool, Tohsaka has long since changed back into her regular clothes.</p><p>Seeing as we have left the place already, it wouldn&#39;t be at all odd for the time limit to have passed already.</p><hr><p>\u201C......Do you want to continue?\u201D</p><p>Absolute obedience, for all of today.</p><p>Taken literally, it could continue until midnight.</p><p>Besides, I feel like I don&#39;t want it to ever end.</p><hr><p>\u201CThen, the contract is over. Is that okay?\u201D</p><p>As if to sever any regrets, Tohsaka states that definitively.</p><p>As you say, yeah. I agree.</p><hr><p>\u201CRight, then I&#39;ll make sure to be as defiant as possible, while I still can.\u201D</p><p>\u201COh, you&#39;re at that age already, aren&#39;t you. No worries, your teacher will always be here to listen to her students&#39; problems.\u201D</p><p>\u201CNothing has changed, after all... As I thought.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CWe&#39;re back.\u201D</p><p>\u201CI&#39;m back now, man I&#39;m tired...\u201D</p><p>\u201CAh, we forgot about souvenirs. They even had Macadamia nuts and Hawaiian manjuu...\u201D</p><p>\u201CI see.

Then, is it Fuji-Nee, Saber, Rider, or maybe...? Well, it&#39;s probably okay.</p><hr><p>\u201CNow then... As I thought, this looks impossible.\u201D</p><p>Taking off the cover, I brush off the dust.</p><p>Even with a service manual, this is far beyond my abilities.</p><p>Furthermore, with appliances getting more and more modularized, it&#39;s getting very difficult for amateurs to even get inside them.</p><hr><p>\u201CFor now, they do say that these things often get thrown out as soon as the loader breaks.\u201D</p><p>Spreading out my tools, I line them up on the sheet next to me, since it seems like I&#39;m in for a long haul.</p><p>All right then, let&#39;s take another look inside\u2015\u2015\u2015and...</p><p>\u201C...............\u201D</p><hr><p>I feel a storm brewing.</p><p>It feels like the pressure&#39;s dropping, clouds are forming and the wind&#39;s picking up.</p><p>Rapid footsteps stomp firmly on the ground\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><p>\u201C..................\u201D</p><hr><p>They&#39;re heading straight to the storehouse.</p><p>My eyes tell me it&#39;s Tohsaka, but in reality, it&#39;s a living typhoon of magical energy.</p><hr><p>\u201CYo, Tohsaka.\u201D</p><p>I raise my hand to greet her.</p><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><p>I feel greatly endangered, as if seeing my parents&#39; mortal enemy.</p><p>What the heck happened?</p><p>At this rate, next she&#39;ll fire a Gandr, and that would be the start of the Emiya Residence Storehouse Murder Case.</p><hr><p>\u201C...Bathroom. You have one.\u201D</p><p>\u201CWhich one? The one in the main building?\u201D</p><p>\u201CThe outer building.\u201D</p><p>Needless to say, this house is huge.</p><p>The outer building and the main building both have a restroom.</p><hr><p>\u201CWater came out.\u201D</p><p>\u201CThere&#39;s a leak? That&#39;s not good.\u201D</p><p>There will be lots of damage if I leave plumbing problems unfixed.</p><p>Let&#39;s go repair it.

Shirou.\u201D</p><p>\u201CThat...? Do you mean...\u201D</p><p>Come to think of it, the Western-style bathroom in the outer building is the one that I took some effort renovating.</p><p>And while Tohsaka was gone, there have been several new state-of-the-art home electric appliances introduced in our household\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>\u201CAre you talking about the bidet?\u201D</p><p>\u201CWhy didn&#39;t you tell me!?\u201D*</p><p>Ah, the dam finally broke.</p><p>I&#39;m just standing there, dumbfounded, as a muddy stream of water surges towards me\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>\u201CYou should have told me about that thing from the start!

I nearly had a heart attack!\u201D</p><p>...So that&#39;s where the scream came from...</p><hr><p>\u201C...Yeah, the first time I used one, I somehow thought of a dentist. No, not that I had to visit one, I mean how you just have to clench your teeth and deal with it.</p><p>But Tohsaka, it&#39;s one of those things that you get used to, and then can&#39;t help but wonder at the convenience of modern civilization\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><p>&quot;Amazing, I&#39;m surprised,&quot; Sakura also said. It really was a surprise. Anyone who experiences it can&#39;t help but tell the tale.</p><hr><p>\u201CNo one asked for your impressions, Shirou!\u201D</p><p>\u201CTohsaka, was that your first time?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201COf course! I never even thought of doing anything like that!</p><p>I can&#39;t believe it. Who in the world, where in the world, what race of people could possibly think to invent such a satanic device!</p><p>Tch, the modern engineers are not to be taken lightly. That creativity, that effectiveness, truly, it&#39;s the work of a god, or a devil, or...!\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><p>She&#39;s getting carried away with that comparison.</p><p>Tohsaka seems completely astonished.</p><p>...Still. Her residence doesn&#39;t look like it&#39;d have a bidet, and with Tohsaka being so hopeless with any kind of appliances, I&#39;m rather worried about the mess she could have made.</p><hr><p>\u201CBy the way, which button did you press first?\u201D</p><p>\u201CWha\u2015\u2015\u2015how could you ask such an embarrassing question!? And while laughing, too!?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CWhat I want to say is, hiding that thing, and then using it to make fun of people really gets on my nerves!\u201D</p><p>No, I honestly regret it, ma&#39;am.</p><p>I definitely didn&#39;t mean it that way, but in the end, yeah, that&#39;s how it ended up being.</p><hr><p>\u201CHa, ha, ha.</p><p>In any case, it&#39;s rather convenient, so please make full use of it. Unfortunately, there isn&#39;t one for the Japanese-style washroom in the main building.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CJust who is it that goes to the washroom to enjoy themselves\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><p>Oh, so just in the outer building?\u201D</p><hr><p>I nod.</p><p>I&#39;ve seen a Japanese-style bidet on the TV. But unfortunately, they stopped manufacturing those due to a variety of reasons.</p><hr><p>\u201CHmm, then... who else is using it?\u201D</p><p>\u201CSakura and Rider. But Rider was no fun, she wasn&#39;t surprised at all.</p><p>Even Fuji-Nee had already used it before.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CIs that so?\u2015\u2015\u2015Fufufu...\u201D</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015I could tell she&#39;s plotting something devious right now.</p><p>And so the victim will definitely be the only one girl who hasn&#39;t used it yet.</p><p>Tragedy invites further tragedy. I have to break this chain of sorrow\u2015\u2015\u2015!</p><hr><p>\u201CSaber, is it...? Excellent, I&#39;m looking forward to it.\u201D</p><p>\u201CI knew it! Wait, Tohsaka, don&#39;t be hasty!\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CBut I haven&#39;t even done anything yet? After all, you seemed to really enjoy yourself, Emiya-kun, and being denied that same entertainment is rather vexing.</p><p>Besides, I only have to tell Saber to &quot;push that button,&quot; right?\u201D</p><p>...It&#39;s a path smeared with blood, after all.</p><p>Tohsaka skips away before I have a chance to stop her.</p><hr><p>...I went back to tinkering with the VCR, when a few minutes later...</p><p>\u201C-----HiyaaaaaaaaaAAAAAA------!?\u201D</p><p>...Now that&#39;s not something you hear every day.
