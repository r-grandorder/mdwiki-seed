Do you know why?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> (shake head)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Right Senpai, I don&#39;t understand his ideas either.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> (nod)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Senpai, you can understand the idea behind his words.<br> But I...</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou...</p><hr><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> I achieved valor in Gaul and Britannia.<br> That is a fact, and it was written down as well.</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> I guess you could say that I was young.<br> But, that was not all.</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> I escaped. It felt slightly better to preoccupy myself with service by sword than the schemes surging through Rome.</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> Betrayal for betrayal, conspiracy for conspiracy.<br> It&#39;s easy for me to climb the ladder of power as such.</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> After all\u2013</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> I am a descendant of the goddess of love and beauty,<br> and a man who fathered a child with a female fairy.</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> My beauty makes women fall into my hands at will.<br> Add in my intelligence and I&#39;m the best at scheming.</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> But...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Beauty?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> He said beauty, right?</p><hr><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou.</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> Actually, scheming takes quite a bit of courage.<br> At first you feel nothing, but gradually. Gradually.</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> While I bite into juicy grapes, while I fool around with women, political enemies die off by my schemes\u2013</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> But when it&#39;s being repeated over and over, you start to feel sick, as if something&#39;s been tainted.</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> That is why, at times, I escaped to the battlefield.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...I now finally understand.<br> Gaius Julius Caesar.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> You seek to settle all the escaping you did right here and right now.</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> That&#39;s right. I\u2013wait, enemies.<br> They must have noticed us.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Enemy signatures are approaching!<br> Is this like, remnants of the United Empire army?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Rome should be correcting itself now, so why are there United Empire soldiers still left?</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> I&#39;ll tell you later. Before that Fujimaru, hurry up and drive them off.</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> I will take command for you.<br> I am a great commander.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Caesar, you fight too!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> You&#39;re a Saber and you&#39;re hanging back?</p><hr><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> Saber, right, Saber. Saber.<br> By rights I shouldn&#39;t even be in the Saber class.</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> ...I only unsheathe my sword when I&#39;m next to a beauty.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Why look at me...</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> Not knowing your own beauty is equal to a crime, yes?<br> Well anyways, I shall unsheathe my sword.<br> Oh, brother\u2013</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> ...I guess that&#39;s it.<br> Makes me sick.</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> Wielding a sword like this gets me fired up with nostalgia. Though, swordfights are the epitome of nuisances.</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> I seem to be escaping even now that I am a Heroic Spirit.<br> How pathetic!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Why are you so angry?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Despite the lack of scheming?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes, Senpai&#39;s question is legitimate.<br> Caesar, what is upsetting you?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> You are already a Heroic Spirit, unrelated to the bloodstained schemes of ancient Rome.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> And still...<br> You end up returning to Rome with us, why?</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> I&#39;ve said it many times.<br> It is to escape.</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> To put it nicely, it&#39;s to settle things.<br> Oh, it also answers this Doctor guy&#39;s question.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> You mean these United Empire remnants?<br> For some reason, they&#39;re still around...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Whoa, another enemy attack as we speak!<br> Is this area under the United Empire influence?</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> Right.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> What?</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> We&#39;re entering combat, Master!<br> Your orders, please!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> \u2013Battle complete.<br> Soldiers perceived as United Empire are retreating.</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> After them.

No, well\u2013</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> You guys should chase them, too!<br> I don&#39;t know what he&#39;ll do, but you can&#39;t abandon him!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Understood!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> We&#39;ve caught up.<br> Caesar is right there\u2013</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> You&#39;re finally here.<br> Perfect, you can see me face my own foolishness.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Face?</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou?</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> ...I am a distinguished general of Rome.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> I&#39;m the general that conquered Gaul, and made a successful expedition to Britannia.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> I slaughtered the great general Pompey.<br> I&#39;m the only ruler of Rome, the origin of its Emperor.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> I danced within the cruelty of Rome, and also danced in the battlefield.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> I shall continue fighting.<br> As long as Rome exists, my dance continues.</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> No, that horrible dance ends here.<br> This is the end of your escapism.</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> A general? The origin of Emperor?<br> That is quite absurd!</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> You are merely escaping!<br> You pig!</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> You could not grant the wish of the one woman you loved, and you chose not to name your loving child as your heir!</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> I am!
