Soothing the people with a smile, gaining adoration with a gaze. Marie was born to be loved, and this is not a theory to her, but her actually feeling this as an instinct. Accepting the fact that she is an image, and finding joy in that, she set her heart on conducting herself as what was desired of her. That mentality is already not far off from some kind of goddess.</p><p>Marie never hates the people. As she was born for the sake of being loved, she therefore loves the people. If the people deem her to be unnecessary, and even if they shout at her, capture her, and kill her, she will show a smile to them even at the moment of her death. However, because her mentality as a Servant is fundamentally being stopped at \u201Cthe moment she married Louis XVI, visited France as its Queen, and was blessed and loved by the many citizens\u201D, she does not easily display her aspect as a tragic queen. (It is not the case that she has no memories after that moment. Nevertheless, the stage of her mentality and character is simply at \u201Cthat time\u201D.)</p><p>Upfront, and spontaneous, Marie will speak of anything she thought of. She will openly say the things she likes are what she likes, and the things she does not like so much are what she dislikes.</p><p>Marie likes baths. Awfully liking to keep herself clean is an influence from her mother, Maria Theresa. Because she says that \u201CThe light perfumes with a scent similar to flowers and herbs are pleasant\u201D, the perfumes she uses are not that strong.</p><p>Marie is a spendthrift. She completely wastes money on one thing or another as she pleases without even understanding herself about this trait.</p><h2 id="attitude-towards-master" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#attitude-towards-master" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Attitude Towards Master</h2><p>As the bond with the Protagonist (Master) deepens, it will reach the point where Marie will display the aspect of her tragic side. It is very evident that she is \u201Cthe very idol who continues to scatter love, yet whose scars remained imprinted on both her body and mind.\u201D And yet, she still smiles beautifully. Never, will Marie desire for the erasure of the tragedy.</p><h2 id="dialogue-examples" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#dialogue-examples" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Dialogue Examples</h2><p>\u201CEveryone, I love you all\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014Thank you, Vive la France!\u201D</p><p>\u201CFor everyone who\u2019s fond of me, please, I wish you all to be blessed with a wonderful grace!\u201D</p><p>\u201CHey, let\u2019s dance, let\u2019s sing!

The consort of Louis XVI. An ephemeral lady. Born between Maria Theresa, a descendant of the House of Habsburg \u2013 the great German royal house \u2013 and Holy Roman Emperor Francis I, a person originating from the House of Lorraine as its Duke, Marie Antoinette was born and raised as an existence that symbolizes \u201Cthe rule of the nobility\u201D of the European world, but in the violent torrents of human history where the absoluteness of the Royal Authority was continually being lost, she lost her life before the changes of the world.</p><p>Loved as a symbol of the Royal Authority, being blessed while living\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>Detested as a symbol of the Royal Authority, shown contempt as she ended up dead.</p><p>The protruding eyes of the nobility, political marriage, living the royal court life, and then, revolution and execution. It is possible to say that that way of life and manner of death of Marie\u2019s became the embodiment of the Royal Authority as an evident \u201Cidol\u201D.</p><p>Although Marie became a target of hatred by many people before and after the Revolution, her impaired reputation has been restored in modern France; when famines came about, she would cut royal court expenses to make donations, she would personally request the nobles to provide support to the people, and so forth; thus, it is being confirmed that she was a woman who thought of the citizens.</p><p>There was a tragedy. But\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>Marie will never wish on the Holy Grail for the erasure of the tragedy. She will only carry out her own role. In other words:</p><p>Radiance to the heavens.

While it is a voice that charms people, it is also a declaration of the exercise of power by the Royal Authority.

As a matter of fact, this genius boy would be later known as Amadeus Mozart, and he proposed marriage to the beautiful Marie (who at that time had the name Maria). The answer at that time was\u2026</p><p>Even now where he became a Heroic Spirit, Marie recognizes that she \u201Clikes\u201D the sincere and fun Amadeus.

During her lifetime, Sanson was also the companion who raised his voice to her during her final moments. Just before her execution, it is said that Marie expressed her words of apology regarding the incident of her stepping on Sanson\u2019s shoes.</p><p><strong>The Chevalier d\u2019\xC9on</strong></p><p>Marie completely recognizes d\u2019\xC9on as a \u201Cwoman\u201D. Furthermore, Marie deeply respects d\u2019\xC9on as a person who devoted herself to secret missions and diplomacies while she was a woman. Marie had given a dress to d\u2019\xC9on during their lifetimes.

Since portraits of Marie Antoinette remain where her hair was in its best days and she wore a big hat, her hair has a substantial volume even though her head may appear in this way, but it\u2019s HUGE whenever I look over it again, isn\u2019t it?! Although I put in a motif of a white lily on some parts of her, the tips of Marie\u2019s twintails are especially my favourite.
