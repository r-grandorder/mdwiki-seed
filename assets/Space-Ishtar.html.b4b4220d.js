And so, she acts in a way that isn&#39;t reminiscent of Ishtar.</p><p>For example, even if she were to - like Ishtar did during the Summer Race - attempt to resurrect Gugalanna at the expense of her surroundings to regain her authority, in S Ishtar&#39;s case she would surely reflect on herself, destroy Gugalanna with her own hands and share the resources with the race&#39;s participants in the end.<br> &quot;Well, this is such a waste that I&#39;d love to go on a rampage in frustration, but I felt like this was what had to be done! See, you just can&#39;t lie to yourself, right?&quot;<br> In this manner, while she is basically Ishtar herself, she would never become humanity&#39;s enemy in the final stage......in other words, S Ishtar is a goddess who is &quot;bad in terms of being Ishtar&quot;.</p><h2 id="attitude-towards-master" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#attitude-towards-master" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Attitude Towards Master</h2><p>She is extremely interested in the thing known as the &quot;Master&quot; who contracts and uses Servants despite being just a human.<br> &quot;Eh? There is such a job like that in your world? Isn&#39;t that amazing even though you&#39;re a human!?&quot;<br> Having recognized humans as &quot;weak beings&quot;, she is honestly impressed that one is able to comprehend and communicate with Servants.<br> While she does not respect the Master, she perceives them as &quot;someone important&quot;,<br> &quot;I&#39;ll listen to what you say as long as I feel like it\u2661&quot; she says with the smile of a little devil.</p><p>Since she is from a different universe and a different world, she does her best not to empathize with the Master more than necessary, but since the guard of her heart (love flags) is weak, she is guaranteed to stray from the path at a moment&#39;s notice.<br> Since regular Ishtar&#39;s sense of distance is close, she possesses the &quot;appeal of a neighborhood older sister&quot;, but due to SW2 Ishtar&#39;s unduly distant manner, the appeal of a neighborhood older sister is diminished. In exchange, her impression as a heroine who &quot;despite being somewhat out of your league, is shining right beside you&quot; is strong.</p><h2 id="dialogue-examples" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#dialogue-examples" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Dialogue Examples</h2><p>First Ascension: Supreme Ruler of Evil Ishtar Composed, somewhat aggressive polite language. A young lady of great upbringing. Fundamentally earnest and polite.<br> However, she is always in a bad mood (angry). When she reveals her true colors, she becomes the usual Rin. She&#39;s got a sharp tongue when expressing her anger.</p><p>Second Ascension: Cowgirl Ishtar<br> Unreserved and confident, her tone combines the boldness of the wilds with the lightness of a young girl. What she does might be dangerous, but it is based on justice.<br> She keeps others more at a distance than regular Ishtar (since ultimately, she does not want to depend on others). She is a heroine of justice, she isn&#39;t satisfied until she returns the humiliation and loans she received many times over.</p><p>Third Ascension: Goddess of Origin Ishtar<br> The personality of a transcendental being. Her lines are more machine-like and lacking in emotion. She is the cool and mysterious-chan kind.<br> While it might be difficult to put emotions into her lines, she is &quot;the protector of humanity, the goddess born for humanity&#39;s sake&quot; resulting from the union/fusion of the first and second ascensions.<br> She is of the &quot;kind on the inside even if her tone is cold&quot; faction. However, she has a very sharp tongue when she goes on angry rants. Her designation as a &quot;Threat to Humanity&quot; is gone due to having changed to the side that protects humanity.</p><h2 id="setting" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#setting" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Setting</h2><p>Space Ishtar is &quot;the goddess that exists in reality&quot; in the Servant Universe.</p><p>She is not &quot;the goddess of the Venus seen (observed) by Earthlings who presides over said planet&quot;, but &quot;the goddess of Venus who arose in the ancient civilization on Venus,&quot; so from an Earthling&#39;s perspective, it could be said that she is an alien herself.</p><p>Her outward appearance matches that of Fate/EXTRA&#39;s Tohsaka Rin.<br> The Primordial Universe refers to the &quot;universe in which humans were humans&quot; that existed way before the Sapphire Galaxy (The ether universe. The world of the current Universe.); even further back in that ancient universe\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500before the birth of mammals on Earth, the goddess worshipped by the prehistoric ancient civilization of that universe was Astarte.<br> During those times, the concept of faith did not exist; the word goddess referred to &quot;the sector of space where life can exist&quot;.<br> It is not clear whether that concept took shape or whether that way of being was used as a concept, but Ishtar-Astarte of the Primordial Universe became &quot;a galaxy taking on the shape of a human&quot;.<br> Originally, she is not something that mortals could handle or something that could become a Servant.<br> (At the climax of SW2, no attack would work on the &quot;Astarte from the times of the Primordial Universe&quot; that appeared as a boss, but that was due to this &quot;galaxy lifeform argument&quot;. Since she is actually a galaxy, the attacks of humans are way too tiny so they can only pass through her.)</p><p>Since the universe has transformed from the Primordial Universe into the Sapphire Galaxy, the ancient civilization moved on from this dimension and Astarte was supposed to also become a simple galaxy and fall into a slumber.<br> However, the greedy (desiring to see more of the universe&#39;s future and human civilization) Astarte refused to obey the rules of the Sapphire Galaxy and remained as an evil goddess.</p><p>Spreading as the Primordial Universe, Astarte became the &quot;Crimson Taboo Space Sector&quot; and continued to remain within the Sapphire Galaxy.<br> The time her Divine Core took shape and she clearly began to erode the Sapphire Universe was 2000 years ago.<br> To avoid this, the Goddess Subjugation A Team (including Jane and Sigurd) was put together and they destroyed the core of the goddess that served as the center of the Taboo Space Sector. Astarte once again fell into a slumber.</p><p>And then, a few hundred years later.<br> Within the ruins of the altar of the Primordial Universe, Professor Tokiomi found Astarte who &quot;reincarnated as human&quot; sleeping inside a crystal cradle.</p><p>In secret, Professor Tokiomi took custody of this crystal cradle and took it home.<br> After that, unconsciously, the goddess divided herself into an &quot;evil half&quot; and a &quot;good half&quot;. This gave humanity a choice: Which one would they pick? Which one could they coexist with?<br> After thinking it over carefully, Tokiomi decided to raise the &quot;evil half&quot; as a &quot;good goddess&quot;.</p><p>Thus, knowing nothing, S Ishtar developed at a rapid rate.<br> However, on S Ishtar&#39;s 14th birthday, Professor Tokiomi was killed by Space Shinkage-ryuu, an evil organization that got wind of the existence of the Goddess of Origin, Astarte, and the &quot;other half&quot; that was hidden in the house was also stolen.<br> (S Ishtar wasn&#39;t told about this other half)</p><p>Left on her own, Tokiomi&#39;s daughter, S Ishtar became a bounty hunter and chased after Space Shinkage-ryuu to avenge her father.<br> The other half that Space Shinkage-ryuu took with them was raised as the &quot;Daughter of the Supreme Ruler of Evil, Astarte&quot; so Space Shinkage-ryuu could use her as a tool for ruling the universe.</p><p>The two Ishtars don&#39;t know.<br> About the existence of the other. And just which is &quot;good&quot; and which is &quot;evil&quot;.</p><h2 id="ascension-1-ishtar-as-the-supreme-ruler-of-evil" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#ascension-1-ishtar-as-the-supreme-ruler-of-evil" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Ascension 1: Ishtar as the Supreme Ruler of Evil</h2><p>The genius swordswoman raised by the evil organization, Space Shinkage-ryuu, who eventually reached the rank of supreme ruler.<br> Cold and gloomy, but has excellent manners.<br> In truth, she is the &quot;good half&quot;.<br> To her, Space Shinkage-ryuu is like a family and she works hard every day for the sake of achieving their dearest wish.</p><h2 id="ascension-2-ishtar-as-a-bounty-hunter-cowgirl" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#ascension-2-ishtar-as-a-bounty-hunter-cowgirl" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Ascension 2: Ishtar as a bounty hunter cowgirl</h2><p>The gunman of justice raised by the strict but kind Professor Tokiomi.<br> A free and uninhibited young girl who goes at full power when it comes to living life.<br> Due to the shock of having her father killed, her body stopped developing when she was 14.

However, in the settings of the character that I received, there were 3 characters: a good, an evil, and a space-like one. Since they each had parents and their own personal histories, I ended up imagining the lives and lifestyles that each of them have built up so I did not want to omit any of them which I told Nasu-san as well. That there are 3 characters, aren&#39;t there. And that&#39;s how we ended up with around 3 characters. In terms of the direction for the design, for her first ascension, I expanded the image from her countenance when she was a mimic in &quot;hollow&quot;. The second one is in the style of a free-spirited bounty-hunter cowgirl pairing up with her partner Jane, and the third was designed with a not-so MADE IN JIGOKU feel. Since the three are identical yet different characters, I paid attention to making them appear as their own existences even if they were to be lined up next to each other so it wouldn&#39;t feel like the character was simply changing her outfit. The ribbon is the same as the one worn in &quot;EXTRA&quot;. I asked Hirai Yukio-san to design the Maanna spaceship that flies through the galaxy. I&#39;m so grateful to him... At first, we were going to go with a gigantic spaceship like in Independence Day for the Goddess Temple, but god-knows-how, it ended up with the form of a giant goddess.
