Not good.

Probably because of overexertion during the day. There is something wrong with this much heat.&quot;</p><p>I had heard that Japanese summers were hot, but I had not thought it would be this bad.</p><p>The heat shining back from this town is too strong even for me, a child of the desert.</p><hr><p>I thought I would sleep through the heat of the day, but it seems I could not control the time of my awakening.</p><hr><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;...... A cold night. I must have slept too long?&quot;</p><p>Whatever the case, confusion is for certain.</p><p>Not sleeping properly and not ordering all this information is setting myself up for failure.</p><hr><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;...... But before that, I must confirm where the next incident will occur.&quot;</p><p>As long as I can move, I must finish the preparations.</p><p>Fortunately, I have data on this town I downloaded from Tohno Shiki.</p><p>I can find the source of all these incidents without needless roaming.</p><hr><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Ah, come to think of it...... Tohno Shiki. Securing him is also a priority.&quot;</p><p>It is before midnight.</p><p>There are three possible routes he will take.</p><p>It should be easy enough to determine his current location.</p><hr><h4 id="location-changes-to-the-shrine" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#location-changes-to-the-shrine" aria-hidden="true">#</a> <em>Location changes to the Shrine</em></h4><hr><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;...... Then, all that&#39;s left is this?&quot;</p><p>I come out to an unfamiliar clearing.</p><p>A small clearing apart from the office buildings.</p><hr><p>Until a short while ago everything was another large city park but it now transitions into private property.</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Wow. From down here it really looks impressive.&quot;</p><hr><p>I look up at the building under construction.</p><p>I heard the monumental architecture would be finished next spring.</p><p>Nobody seems to be sure exactly what it&#39;s going to be, but it&#39;s something important.</p><p>I&#39;ve heard everything from a big department store to the corporate office of a powerful electronics company.</p><hr><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;The area around it is also being landscaped. Maybe I don&#39;t have to go this far.&quot;</p><p>The land all around the building is perfectly flat like a mirror.</p><p>The name of the building, Shrine, may be appropriate... but it&#39;s going a little too far.</p><hr><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500Well...&quot;</p><p>I hold my breath and scan the area.</p><p>No sign of anyone else around.</p><p>Of course there are less and less people as night falls, thanks to the rumors of the vampire murders starting up again, but...</p><hr><p>I can understand why no one would be in the park, or the back alley, but this place is empty of people for another reason.</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;...... Well, after all, this is private property. The only people around would be trespassing, so why should I expect to see anybody......?&quot;</p><p>\u2500\u2500\u2500And then,</p><p>I suddenly get assailed by nausea.</p><p>My fingers are numb and my throat is parched.</p><p>My pulse quickens.</p><p>A feeling like poison creeping from the back of my brain.</p><p>Without even realizing it, my right hand reaches into my pocket and soundlessly takes out my knife.</p><hr><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500This... sensation.&quot;</p><p>...... I&#39;ve felt these chills so many times before.</p><p>Am I just disposed to this?</p><p>Before I meet up with something unworldly, I always get assailed by this sensation.</p><hr><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;............&quot;</p><p>...... I sense someone.</p><p>Someone standing right behind me.</p><p>Someone (a human?) on this private property where no one should be.</p><p>A faint chill.</p><p>And...... the vampire has returned\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500!</p><hr><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;...... But, something is......&quot;</p><p>It feels a little different.</p><p>Are my reactions weak?</p><p>It simply feels &quot;different from usual&quot;, a discomfort that indicates the presence of an outsider.</p><hr><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;\u2500\u2500Well, show yourself......!&quot;</p><hr><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Hello? Is someone there?&quot;</p><p>I speak with my knife hidden behind my back.</p><p>\u2500\u2500\u2500And then,</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Good evening. Do you have business with me?&quot;</p><p>Even though it was all so sudden, the girl speaks so calmly.</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500&quot;</p><hr><p>Seeing her, I was startled.</p><p>That distinctive dress and hat.</p><p>Definitely a foreign look, and I&#39;m almost afraid to say it, but she looks really cute.</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;What is it?&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Oh, ah... well, no, nothing really.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Um\u2500\u2500Sorry, I mistook you for someone else. Sorry to be so rude.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;You do not have to apologize.</p><p>But that is not the way to greet someone, is it?&quot;</p><hr><p>Her tone is so smooth.</p><p>...... Now that she mentions it, it makes total sense.</p><p>Lately, I seem to be off-kilter.</p><hr><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;...... You&#39;re right. It&#39;s a little late, but, good evening.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Yes, nice to meet you.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;So, what are you doing here?</p><p>Are you looking for something at this hour?&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Eh? ...... Ah, yeah, something like that.</p><p>And what about you? You couldn&#39;t have not heard about how dangerous it is at night\u2500\u2500&quot;</p><hr><p>Oh, right.</p><p>If she&#39;s a foreigner, she wouldn&#39;t have heard the rumors circulating this town.</p><p>Since she&#39;s probably just sightseeing, she wouldn&#39;t know anything about the vampire murders last year, either......</p><hr><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;It&#39;s nothing...... Um, I don&#39;t know why you are here, but it&#39;s better to not hang around places where no one is around. You never know what might happen.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500&quot;</p><hr><p>She just stares at me.</p><p>...... It&#39;s only natural.</p><p>There&#39;s no way she can understand me if I keep suddenly blurting out all this stuff.</p><hr><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;No, you cannot say I don&#39;t know what will happen. Whatever shape he takes, the vampire will appear. Even you are patrolling in order to find him, are you not, Tohno Shiki?&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;W\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500what?&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;You could say we are looking for the same thing, Tohno Shiki. ...... Although our reasons are very different.&quot;</p><hr><p>She speaks devoid of any expression.</p><p>Those chills return.</p><p>Pain in my temples like a stabbing needle...</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;An irregularity like you throws the equation out of balance. Unless I move quickly to root out any problems, the results this time will also be undesirable.&quot;</p><p>Her arms swings forth and I hear an unfamiliar click.</p><p>She holds a black gun in her hand.</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500Please, resist if you wish. My name is Sion Eltnam Atlasia. Your freedom now belongs to me.&quot;</p><p>And with that, she jumps towards me.</p><p>This foreign girl I&#39;d never met before attacks me with almost unspeakable speed.</p><hr><h2 id="shiki-vs-sion" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#shiki-vs-sion" aria-hidden="true">#</a> <em>Shiki vs Sion</em></h2><h2 id="shiki-loses" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#shiki-loses" aria-hidden="true">#</a> <em>Shiki loses</em></h2><hr><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;sstt......!&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Battle finished. Fourth, sixth thought processes halted.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Results compiled. Your choices in combat are rated at merely 70. Even if you possess the ability to inflict instant death, your tactics are still easily predicted.&quot;</p><hr><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Damn...... What do you want!?&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;I do not intend to harm you any further. Did you not notice something different? ...... Your intuition was correct. Just as you felt, my method of fighting is entirely different from those you have faced before.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;You must stop resisting. I have no interest in taking your life. I require you in my calculations, so if you do not resist, you will not be hurt.&quot;</p><hr><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Eh\u2500\u2500\u2500Hey, don&#39;t touch people&#39;s heads like that!&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Please calm down. Did I not say I would not harm you? All I did was connect my Etherlite to your brain.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Huh......? Co\u2212connect to my brain? What the heck......?&quot;</p><hr><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;The artificial nervous system called Etherlite. In terms you can understand, a filament only one micron thick. Think of it as a thread you cannot see using the naked eye.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;......!&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;...... No way. I do feel something strange on my temple, but that\u2500\u2500\u2500&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Yes. Upon contact with your skin, it seeks out your nerves and fuses with them. The maximum range is 5,000 meters, so it is a simple matter for it to fill your entire body.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;No further explanation is needed to understand, correct? I have hacked your mind and body. From now on, I will control your actions. I assume there are no objections, Tohno Shiki?&quot;</p><hr><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;...... No objections!? Like hell there aren&#39;t, you idiot! I don&#39;t know who you are, but are you crazy!?&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;How rude. I am trying to hold a civilized conversation. Tohno Shiki, please correct yourself.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Correct myself? Are you stupid!? First you attack me and now you want to control me!? If you&#39;re sane, then that makes me the crazy one. Seriously, you&#39;re as ridiculously random as Arcueid. No, you&#39;re even worse of a random bastard!&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Ra\u2212random\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500!?&quot;</p><hr><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;You are calling me random!? How superficial your knowledge must be for you to proclaim the actions of an alchemist like myself as random! No, to use the term random so senselessly is evidence of that probability! Yes, as you say, I cannot but think that you are the one who has gone crazy!&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Eh\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500huh?&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>:&quot;Correct yourself! I am Sion Eltnam Atlasia, an alchemist of the Atlas Academy where all knowledge is accumulated and stored! What an insult. There is no one who can match my speed of thought and rational knowledge acquisition! Do you understand, Tohno Shiki? I am not a man, but a woman! In your rough terms, you should not call me a random bastard, but a whore!&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500&quot;</p><hr><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Let me warn you, is your behavior not unnatural? I have gathered information from the past year from you and all you have done is proceed from one engagement of low victory probability to another! It is so amazing, it is enough to almost make one cry! How Tohno Shiki has been able to survive this long... it can only be a miracle\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500(Whoa)&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Ah\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;\u2500\u2500\u2500Back to the main topic. Tohno Shiki, I will have your cooperation with my research. I respect your right to choose, but please do not consider refusing. I now have control of most of your nerves, so if you disobey, I may be forced to hurt you.&quot;</p><hr><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Eh, well\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500(WHOA) uh, what do you mean?&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Do you not understand? I am saying I will fry your nerves if you do not listen. I have no qualms about sending electricity along this Etherlite to fry your brain.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;...... (Stupid. In that case, all I have to do is cut it. I may not be able to see it with the naked eye, but if I take off my glasses......) ......&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;I advise against it. If you cut the Etherlite, your entire body will burn. The Etherlite is now a part of your nervous system. ...... Yes, while this may not be effective against the True Ancestor, it is quite effective against humans. Before nerve damage ensues, you would probably die from the pain.&quot;</p><hr><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;What\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500just now, what did you\u2500\u2500&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;I read your thoughts. The Etherlite is connected to your brain, so no matter what you think, I can read it. Well, I am able to read subjects and verbs minus the conjunctions, at least.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;...... Uwaa, that&#39;s amazing. Then, this\u2500\u2500&quot; (Um, why do I always get involved in things like this?)</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Do not misunderstand me. I do not intend to force you. Our goals are the same, so I propose a mutual relationship to achieve our objectives.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;......? Work together to achieve our objectives......?&quot;</p><hr><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Yes. Our goals overlap somewhat. Otherwise, we would not be negotiating like this.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;...... Speak for yourself. You can&#39;t call this negotiation.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;I only chose the method with the best chance of success. This was the most suitable method to achieve your cooperation.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Well, you must be well\u2212rested by now. My method of fighting is to chip away the opponent&#39;s fighting strength, not like the method of chipping away the opponent&#39;s body that you all employ.&quot;</p><hr><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;...... You got a point. If it wasn&#39;t for that strange string, I would have run away by now.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;I do not mind. Once connected, it cannot be removed except by me. Wherever you go, it will follow.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Yeah, yeah. That&#39;s what I thought.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Well? What&#39;s this about us cooperating?&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;It is as it sounds\u2500\u2500have you changed your mind? You were disparaging me earlier, so for you to listen to me attentively now......&quot;</p><hr><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;All I can do is listen, right? And, well, your methods are a little rough, but you have been polite. I guess I can hear you out. You didn&#39;t finish me off, and you do seem sincerely interested in talking it over. ...... And, well, you don&#39;t seem like a bad person.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;I did not attack you while you were down because you might have used a very strong counterattack...... But if you wish to view it that way, it is just as well. It is meaningless for me to offer another point of view.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Then, I will be concise. My goal is to discover a cure for vampirism. I wish to obtain data from the vampires in this area. Such as a member of the True Ancestors, the origin of the Dead Apostles.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Eh...... True Ancestor... you mean Arcueid?&quot;</p><hr><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Yes. She is the last of the True Ancestors. ...... Correction, there may still exist some lower members of the True Ancestors, but what I need is the data of True Ancestor royalty from Arcueid Brunestud.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Data from Arcueid...... you want to make her into a guinea pig or something?&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Of course not. You of all people know full well that is not possible. I seek only the aid of the True Ancestor. I wish to examine her blood, body and fluids to understand more about the vampiric impulse. If possible, I would like a full week, but that may be more difficult than finding a cure. If she does help me, it would only be because you are cooperating with me.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;? Why do you think she would help me if I&#39;m with you?&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;That, that is\u2500\u2500\u2500because you are the one the True Ancestor is the most...... interested in.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;At any rate, I wish to approach vampirism from a medical standpoint. Consequently, I need data from many vampires. Once bitten by vampires, people become no longer human. Until now, it has been impossible to save them. I challenge that impossibility. It has to be in line with your goals. Because, you know someone who became a vampire.&quot;</p><hr><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500What is it?&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Nothing, really. You just have a way with words.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;I am pleased at your correct evaluation, but what makes you say that?&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Oh, nothing. But the next time you speak so lightly of her, I&#39;ll have no choice but to fight you.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500&quot;</p><hr><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;...... Certainly I was not considerate enough. What I said was not good.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;...... It&#39;s fine. If you say your goal is to cure vampirism, then it&#39;s alright. It definitely is something I see as very important.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Then, you will help me, Tohno Shiki?&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Yeah, but I really don&#39;t get you. If you knew so much about me, you should&#39;ve known talking it over from the beginning would&#39;ve been fine. If you said that was your goal, I wouldn&#39;t have refused.&quot;</p><hr><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;...... So it seems. I was mistaken. I did not have a complete understanding of you.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;However, this may be for the best. Verbal promises are one thing, but if you do not put a high priority on our cooperation, I have means of ensuring you listen to me.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Yeah yeah. The loser must obey the winner, right? That&#39;s fine, but I&#39;m not exactly swimming in free time. I have my own reasons for walking around late at night.&quot;</p><hr><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Searching for the rumored vampire? I have not said anything about that, but I also have an interest in finding it.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;? You, you know about that vampire?&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Yes. Upon arriving here, I heard the rumors. The atmosphere in this town is strange and I knew something unusual was going on.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;...... I see. If an outsider like you thinks that way, then that rumored vampire probably does exist.&quot;</p><hr><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;I cannot say that is absolutely true, but the True Ancestor seems to be pursuing it. It is her responsibility to dispose of Dead Apostles. She could not turn a blind eye towards any in the town she lives in.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500! You even know about Arcueid hiding her whereabouts!?&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;You are thinking it now. About how she is evading you because she is worried over you and wants to settle it herself. So if we find the rumored vampire, we should find the True Ancestor. At that time, she may listen to me if you ask her to.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;...... I see. That&#39;s why you want my help.&quot;</p><hr><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Yes. I wish for you to mediate our negotiations. For the time being, that is your first priority.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;...... I see. That&#39;s pretty simple, but saying &#39;for the time being&#39; makes me a little uneasy.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;But of course. You even said before that the loser has to obey the winner. Because I defeated you, I have the right to use you. Is that unsatisfactory?&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Yes, but I&#39;ll keep quiet. Since you&#39;re looking for the rumored vampire, I won&#39;t be doing anything different. I&#39;ll help you out until we find Arcueid.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Very prudent. After concluding negotiations and business with the True Ancestor, I will leave this country. Staying in one place too long is dangerous. As for negotiation, that will be my problem. If negotiations break down, I will remove the Etherlite. Is that acceptable, Tohno Shiki?&quot;</p><hr><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Yeah, no complaints. But what do you want me to do? Help her to see things your way?&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;No. If I need you to, I will let you know. All you have to do is ask her to listen to me.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;I see. Then, lead on, My Lady.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;First is investigating in town. I am unfamiliar with the area, so I ask you to direct us.&quot;</p><hr><h2 id="alchemist-of-atlas" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#alchemist-of-atlas" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Alchemist of Atlas</h2><h3 id="extra-alchemist" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#extra-alchemist" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Extra Alchemist</h3><hr><p>That is how our patrol began.</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;So, you are different from the magi Senpai was talking about?&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;I am different from the majority of magi. There are factions of Magi Associations that guide the practice of rituals and the revelation of knowledge. Please think of alchemists as not practicing rituals, but discovering them.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Discover? You mean, like making new magic?&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Most types of magic are already identified, but we discover new methods. As the name alchemist implies, we try to create precious metals from base metals, for example.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Ah, that makes sense now. Like... making gold out of lead?&quot;</p><hr><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;...... Yes, but that refers to the Central Association of Alchemists. I am part of a different organization of alchemists, the Atlas Academy. We have no interest in the transmutation of elements.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;I see. So there&#39;s even different kinds of alchemists.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Not kinds, but factions. We are considered somewhat heretics. Among the three main branches of the Magi Associations, Atlas is considered somewhat of a tumor.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Ah, that word again. Is Atlas a place?&quot;</p><hr><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;A place? Yes. There is an association based on an academy located in the Atlas mountains...... The magi of London call it The Pit. Well, it is surrounded only by desert, so it may not be too inaccurate.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Desert......? Then, where are you from?&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;It is said to be a land where much magic originates. But simply, it is a place with a lot of history.&quot;</p><hr><p>We speak of these mysterious and complicated things as we patrol.</p><p>She isn&#39;t wordy, but she isn&#39;t close\u2212mouthed, either.</p><p>In fact, she answers most of my questions and asks me some in turn.</p><p>She doesn&#39;t start any unnecessary conversation, but if it is necessary, she goes really deep in detail.</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;...... (I think this girl just loves to talk)......&quot;</p><hr><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Do you have any other questions?&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Oh, uh...... I was just wondering what kind of studying your alchemy involves.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Human research. You could say it is more science than alchemy.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Human research? You mean, not magic or sorcery?&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Yes. The alchemists of Atlas were originally a gathering of those with little magical ability due to having a small number of Magic Circuits. They decided for themselves to take a completely natural approach and proceed forward as humans to achieve their goals. The result of that is the present Atlas Academy. We use above all else our own intellect to make a blueprint for the future.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Make\u2500\u2500\u2500the future?&quot;</p><hr><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;It goes without saying that the future is not something that occurs, but is something that is made. With the ingredients of the present day, we make the future for better or worse. We analyze these ingredients to measure the future. We dramatically shift probability to make a perfect model from the ingredients. Magic Circuits are paths connecting to the &#39;Root&#39; called &#39;The One&#39;. Magi use these to bring their ideal future closer. However, those of us with meager Magic Circuits must rely only upon our own intellect to make that ideal future.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;To make an ideal future......? That means those of the past, they......&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;They failed. At some point, the alchemists of Atlas stopped predicting the future and devoted themselves to excel at making various things. Another view has it that at some point, an Academy Director constructed a weapon to deny and resist the &#39;answer&#39; that was discovered. But as a student, it is not something that I know of.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Wh\u2212what......? You mean, you all...&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Now we craft weapons. But our foundation is a fusion of rituals and science. You could say the alchemists of Atlas specialize in those techniques.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Oh... like that Etherlite you have?&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;The Etherlite is a technique handed down in the Eltnam family. The foundation techniques of Atlas are Thought Acceleration and Thought Partition. After that, acceleration and conversion alchemy is acquired.&quot;</p><hr><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;??? Thought Acceleration just means thinking really fast... but Thought Partition is......&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;As the name implies. The alchemists of Atlas are able to partition their thoughts to form multiple thought processes. Think of it this way. Normal people have only one &#39;room&#39; in their brain, so they can focus on only one thought. Thought Partitioning adds partitions inside the one room to create multiple rooms. Alchemists of Atlas must be able to partition their thoughts into three rooms, and five is on the level of genius. It is said there was an Academy Director in the past who was able to achieve eight.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;...... Hmmm? So, it&#39;s like having two or three calculators in your head?&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;That is meaningless. There may be multiple thought processes, but only one goal. While the multiple thought processes work on differing problem sets, they work together to generate one overall solution. If it was simply calculation, would not current machines be on the same level? Rather, it is for problem solving, so nothing else even compares.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Wow, then you&#39;re incredibly smart. ...... That&#39;s right, I remember thinking no matter what I did, you were reading my moves\u2500\u2500\u2500&quot;</p><hr><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;I already simulated all of your patterns, so it was only logical that you were defeated. Any situation can change within a second. It is like a wire diagram showing all possibilities. From this sea of possibilities, we calculate the most likely outcome of events and act according to that outcome. Consequently, events occur in that same manner. ...... We do not see the future in combat, but are simply one\u2212step ahead. The possibility for defeat still lay everywhere in our previous fight. Incorrectly choosing a branch of possibility would render everything useless. If you acted completely outside of predictive behavior, out of whim like you normally do, it would not have been surprising if I lost. But, that is the nature of using Thought Acceleration and Thought Partitioning.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Wow, that&#39;s pretty amazing. It did feel that way.&quot;</p><hr><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;If there is no predicted &#39;future with victory&#39;, the alchemists of Atlas will not fight. ...... Between you and I, you are undoubtedly superior at fighting. Therefore, I have to use alternative methods to obtain victory. For us, fighting is assembling the proper ingredients ahead of time. However, that only makes us equal. Neither strong physically nor in magic, we predict the future to steer it away from the worst outcome. We invest everything in guiding events towards the single opportunity where the future can be reversed. We fight not the enemy, but our own minds. We can trust only ourselves and wager our lives on a moment of thought\u2500\u2500\u2500that is the way of the alchemists of Atlas.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Wow. All this talk of calculation and prediction makes it almost sound like gambling.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;That is not mistaken. That is very close to what we do. Those who gamble must wager calmly while still being very passionate.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;(I see. That&#39;s how it is.)&quot;</p><hr><p>While we talk, we pass by the most prominent part of town.</p><p>It&#39;s been two hours since we started walking.</p><p>The whole time, the town was very quiet and we passed by no one.</p><p>There is none of the frying heat from during the day.</p><p>The night town is quite cool and suitable for walking.</p><hr><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;There is no one in the police box. They may be on patrol, but we have not come across them.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Eh\u2500\u2500\u2500Ah, that&#39;s right, now that you mention it. Patrols are meaningless if you do not meet anyone.... Well, maybe that is a good thing.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;? A good thing? What do you mean?&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Well, if someone saw us, we&#39;d make a strange pair. Don&#39;t we stand out a lot?&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;...... Stand out......? We do?&quot;</p><hr><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;We? Dressed strangely like that, if some policeman saw you, he would start to ask questions.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;...... Ask questions......?&quot;</p><p>She starts to look at her clothes strangely with her head tilted to the side.</p><p>...... I knew it.</p><p>She really does think that her appearance is normal.</p><hr><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Perhaps I look strange?&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Yeah, you really stand out.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;..................&quot;</p><hr><p>Ah, she seems a little dissatisfied.</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;We will deal with that when the time comes. If I am asked questions, I will just have to lie.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Okay. So, if asked, I&#39;ll say you are my friend, so make sure you match that story.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500&quot;</p><hr><p>We seem to have made our way back.

This is the scent of artificial blood, somewhat fitting for this town\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Where are you going, Sion!?&quot;</p><hr><p>I chase after Sion.</p><p>She enters the alley.</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;It really does smell like blood\u2500\u2500\u2500&quot;</p><p>There is nothing different in the alley.</p><p>Maybe it&#39;s because of the rumors about this place.</p><p>But the image of the blood\u2212stained alley floats in my\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500</p><hr><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500!?&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Who is there!?&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;!?&quot;</p><p>Something quick.</p><p>Whatever was hiding in the shadows runs from the alley without a sound.</p><p>In that instant, I see long hair fluttering in the air.</p><p>It reaches far down to the back. Long, long red hair.</p><p>Without a doubt, that is\u2500\u2500\u2500</p><hr><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Shiki, follow!&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Y\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500yeah, got it!&quot;</p><p>The town is silent.</p><p>Only our footsteps echo in the air as we chase it.</p><p><strong>Akiha</strong>: &quot;Ni, Nii\u2212san......!?&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Akiha\u2500\u2500what are you doing here?&quot;</p><p><strong>Akiha</strong>: &quot;That, that is my line! Lights out has long since passed, so what are you doing outside of the mansion!?&quot;</p><hr><p>...... Akiha shakes visibly.</p><p>Does she have something to hide?</p><p>Her normal calm and cool manner is nowhere to be seen.</p><hr><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;...... What am I doing? I&#39;m searching for the rumored vampire. I&#39;m not doing anything bad, so that should suffice for explanation.&quot;</p><p><strong>Akiha</strong>: &quot;Eh...... yes, that is...... certainly an easily understood explanation.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Alright, your turn...... What are you doing out this late? I know it was a misunderstanding earlier, but what was that all about?&quot;</p><p><strong>Akiha</strong>: &quot;Ah\u2500\u2500\u2500no, I have...... have nothing to hide, so, nothing, um......&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Um?&quot;</p><p><strong>Akiha</strong>: &quot;It is hard to explain, so I do not wish to......&quot;</p><p>Akiha fidgets with her fingers.</p><p>...... I don&#39;t know if that really was her in the alley, but it is clear she is hiding something.</p><hr><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Hey. If you&#39;re that suspicious, then I know something&#39;s going on. It&#39;s okay, so just say it.&quot;</p><p><strong>Akiha</strong>: &quot;\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Shiki, we are wasting time. She does not seem inclined to tell us. And if she is possessed, she may not have any memory of it, so she may not be able to answer.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Sion......? What do you mean by possessed?&quot;</p><p><strong>Akiha</strong>: &quot;...... Wait. Who is that woman, Nii\u2212san?&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Who?

Walking around late at night with a girl, you can&#39;t complain even if you are misunderstood, can you!?&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;...............&quot;</p><p>The Lady Akiha chooses a rather roundabout way of saying, &quot;I will not hear any excuses.&quot;</p><p>This is pure intimidation.</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;No, you have it wrong! There&#39;s a reason for this\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Shiki, that is your sister, right?&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Yes, but please be quiet for a bit. I&#39;m a little busy.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;That can wait until later. I wish to examine her, so please catch her. If she resists, you can use force.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Whaaa\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500!&quot;</p><p><strong>Akiha</strong>: &quot;\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500&quot;</p><hr><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Wha, what are you saying, Sion! Akiha isn&#39;t joking around, so please don&#39;t say such ridiculous things!&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Shiki. You know you have no right to refuse me.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Yeah, I know, but I can&#39;t! Even if you fry my brain, I can&#39;t do that to her!&quot;</p><p>And what Akiha will do to me will be far, far worse......!</p><hr><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;...... It cannot be helped. Well, certainly I must show you how things stand at least once.&quot;</p><p>Sion twitches her finger.</p><p>And then, my body starts to move on its own......?</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Eh\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500Ehhh!?&quot;</p><hr><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Did I not say the Etherlite is connected to your nerves? This is its original purpose.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Uwaaa, stupid, stoooooopppp! This, this is a breach of human rights, this is heartless, do you enjoy doing this to others? Don&#39;t think this is over you idiiiiooooot!!!!!&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;...... Wonderful. Thanks to your insults, I do not feel guilty. Thank you for your help, Shiki.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Waaahh\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500! No way, no way! Give me another chance!&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;I decline.

Taking over the position of Tohno family head would be a lot of trouble, right? So, isn&#39;t it much better to let Akiha\u2212sama be the head, and manipulate her from behind the scenes? Yes, that&#39;s my project, the Perfect Tohno House Takeover Plan!&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;No, that was just a misunderstanding, but......

Even if you are planning a Tohno House Takeover, you have a rival. As Akiha\u2212sama commands, we shall punish you here!&quot;</p><p>Saying thus, the two strike a pose.</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Stupid, what are you saying! I get it, but Sion doesn&#39;t understand jokes, if you keep on like this she might really kill...!&quot;</p><p>But then again...</p><p>Somehow, their posture has no openings... and why do I get the feeling that they&#39;re stronger than me...?</p><hr><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Uh... do you two... know martial arts?&quot;</p><p><strong>Hisui</strong>: &quot;If I may be so bold, I achieved enlightenment quite some time ago.&quot;</p><p><strong>Kohaku</strong>: &quot;Yes, some time ago I too became a shining\u2212backed master with a &#39;kaching!&#39;. As Akiha\u2212sama isn&#39;t without her limits, shouldn&#39;t we at least be able to help with fights on the level of driving away burglars?&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500&quot;</p><p>That can&#39;t be true.</p><p>But then again, maybe it is.</p><p>Life has its perfect days, times when everything you do goes well.</p><p>Maybe today is that &quot;somehow everything happens according to plan&quot; day for Kohaku\u2212san.</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;That&#39;s a load of nonsense!

It is because Nii\u2212san is like this that Kohaku and Hisui think they can do such things.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;...... What do you mean? Kohaku\u2212san is always mischievous.

No, let&#39;s not think of such scary things.</p><p><strong>Akiha</strong>: &quot;How come Kohaku made you fall down here?

Kohaku is always strange... do you know anything special about all this?&quot;</p><p>My little sister jumps to the heart of the matter.</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Yes. She is acting as if possessed by the vampire Tatari. ...... No, it is more accurate to say she is benefiting from Tatari.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Vampire... the rumored vampire!?&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Energy without a vessel that can become a vampire. Tatari is something which resides in the &#39;form of people&#39;s anxiety&#39;, and may sometimes reside in those humans who share the same wavelength. In those cases, the ones possessed exhibit no outward change, but everything proceeds along according to their thoughts. ...... Although this is only an extension of their abilities.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;............ Uh, what does that mean, exactly?&quot;</p><hr><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;For tonight, the one known as Kohaku will be an expert at mostly everything she does. You saw how she fought earlier, right? That is also the backing of Tatari.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Wha\u2500\u2500\u2500so, if Kohaku\u2212san wanted to snare Akiha, then\u2500\u2500\u2500&quot;</p><p>Actually, she already did.</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Then she can?&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;...... This will not do. I have been treated poorly by Kohaku. I only told them I did not need their opinion on this affair, and that they were not useful and should just be quiet... And that if they disagreed, they were free to quit... but if they did quit, I wouldn&#39;t introduce them to another mansion for work. ...... I only said that because I was worried about them. I do not think Kohaku should be holding a grudge.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500&quot;</p><p>No, she holds one.</p><p>She definitely holds one.</p><hr><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;I do not know what she is thinking, but there is approximately one hour before she completely becomes Tatari. At midnight, Tatari will appear and will not end until morning.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;...... Akiha. Don&#39;t we have to do something about Kohaku? If she becomes Tatari, the Tohno family will be in deep trouble.&quot;</p><p><strong>Akiha</strong>: &quot;Yes, it would mean certain doom for Misaki Town. I will question you later about this woman here, but for now, let us work together to stop Kohaku.&quot;</p><p>Her hair flashes red and Akiha becomes full of fury.</p><p>It is exactly what we need, but the problem is who she will direct that fury against.</p><p>...... Yeah.</p><p>I have to make sure it&#39;s not against me for being with Sion.</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;That is correct. ...... It has become the worst\u2212case scenario, so I will also help.&quot;</p><hr><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Oh, I can see above ground now. What&#39;s this? That was pretty easy.&quot;</p><p><strong>Akiha</strong>: &quot;Look out, Nii\u2212san!&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;These are ......

Tohno\u2212kun, return to jail.&quot;</p><p><strong>Akiha</strong>: &quot;It seems you are being manipulated. It appears to be Hisui&#39;s work...... but it is still pretty surprising. Even though you talk so big, you seemed to be easily used, Curry\u2212senpai.&quot;</p><p><strong>Ciel</strong>: &quot;Tohno\u2212kun, return to jail. I repeat. Tohno\u2212kun, return to jail.

However, I do have an anti\u2212Makikyuu X, called Tonamin Z!&quot;</p><p><strong>G Akiha</strong>: &quot;Hmph...... what are you trying to say, Kohaku.&quot;</p><p><strong>Kohaku</strong>: &quot;It is best for you to listen to my request if you want to return to your original body. No, you can say that if you wish to remain as G\u2212Akiha\u2212sama your entire life, you can just bake and burn me right here.&quot;</p><p><strong>G Akiha</strong>: &quot;Grr\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500grr, gr\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500&quot;</p><p><em>Grind</em> <em>Grind</em></p><p>Akiha grinds her teeth with incredible chagrin.</p><p>Amazing.Even the grinding of her teeth is overwhelming\u2500\u2500\u2500wait, this isn&#39;t the time to be a spectator.</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;...... (Well, in other words, I&#39;m going to have to end up fighting that.)&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500Alright, let&#39;s run away. Sion, while Akiha and Kohaku\u2212san are talking, we can\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;.......................................................................................&quot;</p><p>...... It&#39;s useless.</p><p>The sheer absurdity of the situation has fried Sion&#39;s brain.</p><p>She neatly crumbles to the floor.</p><hr><p><strong>Kohaku</strong>: &quot;Now let&#39;s go, G\u2212Akiha\u2212sama! Unless you beat Shiki\u2212san and lock him in the dungeon, I will not give you the antidote to return you to normal!&quot;</p><p><strong>G Akiha</strong>: &quot;\u2500\u2500\u2500Enough already, I have no choice......! Nii\u2212san, I have no ill will against you, but I will have to beat you up!&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Uwaa, are you serious......!! Stop it, Akiha! The house will break, the house will break!&quot;</p><p><strong>G Akiha</strong>: &quot;Uhuhuhu\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500In that case, you should just surrender without resisting!&quot;</p><p>Is she serious now? G\u2212Akiha attacks.</p><p>Sion is still unconscious behind me.</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Dang, all I can do is fight......!?&quot;</p><hr><h2 id="shiki-vs-g-akiha" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#shiki-vs-g-akiha" aria-hidden="true">#</a> <em>Shiki vs G Akiha</em></h2><h2 id="shiki-wins-2" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#shiki-wins-2" aria-hidden="true">#</a> <em>Shiki wins</em></h2><hr><p><strong>G Akiha</strong>: &quot;......

You were simply in a bad position to begin with. Well, I think you&#39;re probably strongest when you&#39;re normal.&quot;</p><p><strong>G Akiha</strong>: &quot;Hmph\u2500\u2500\u2500What kind of power up is this, stupid Kohaku...... you will, regret this\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500&quot;</p><p><strong>Kohaku</strong>: &quot;Eh? Huh? H\u2212hey Akiha\u2212sama, if you are going to collapse, do it forward, forward! Please collapse on Shiki\u2212san......!&quot;</p><p><strong>G Akiha</strong>: &quot;Quiet......

What is this rumbling......?&quot;</p><p>She must have woke from Akiha collapsing.</p><p>If she shamelessly awoke from that, then she probably never lost consciousness in the first place.</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;That was the end of the person pulling the strings.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;...... I see. Then it was not a dream after all...... Yes, it is said the Night of Tatari is a nightmare, but it was quite the extraordinary nightmare.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;I agree, but what do we do? Can it be fixed?&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;It is not possible. I deal with the unknown, and I am unsure I wish to know.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Oh man. Then we have to help Kohaku\u2212san, then...... hm?&quot;</p><p>With the sound of something like air escaping from a balloon, G\u2212Akiha returns to just Akiha.</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;.....................&quot;</p><p>Sion seems to be having a massive headache.</p><p>...... I understand how she feels, but this is all for the best.</p><p>It wouldn&#39;t be good to leave something that big just sleeping in the lobby, and having Akiha return to normal size does help out Kohaku\u2212san who was trapped underneath.</p><hr><p><strong>Kohaku</strong>: &quot;Ah, Ahhhh...... I can&#39;t breathe...... Akiha\u2212sama, please forgive meeeeee......&quot;</p><p><strong>Akiha</strong>: &quot;...... Kohaku, I hope you are prepared...... first, I will begin by throwing away all those suspicious things in your room......&quot;</p><p><strong>Kohaku</strong>: &quot;Ah, anything but that...... next time, I will learn from this failure and perfect a breast enhancement drug...&quot;</p><p><strong>Akiha</strong>: &quot;How many times must I tell you, I do not need that...... well, I will not be fooled again......&quot;</p><p><strong>Kohaku</strong>: &quot;Oogh, next time it&#39;ll be perfect\u301C\u301C\u301C......&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;.....................&quot;</p><p>It seems the fight between Kohaku\u2212san and Akiha is still going on.</p><hr><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;...... Sion. Kohaku\u2212san is okay now, right?&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Yes, she is no longer acting as Tatari&#39;s antenna. In the first place, she was only a receiver, as a third party believing she was a witch was necessary. ...... And with her defeat, that also fades away. Unfortunately, Tatari will no longer occur in this town.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;??? Unfortunately? What do you mean, unfortunately?&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;I meant for me. ...... With Tatari gone, I cannot gain any results. I have no more reason to stay in town.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Shiki, I have removed the Etherlite from you. With this, we are no longer connected. Let us say goodbye.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Eh\u2500\u2500\u2500but Sion, you still have to fulfill your goals, right?&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;It is not a matter of fulfilling, as I am now no longer able to fulfill them. ...... It is meaningless to say I am unsatisfied. Time is precious, so I must be going. Even if it was only for a short time, I thank you for your help.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Eh\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500wait, Sion!&quot;</p><p>Sion does not stop.</p><p>Along with the enigmas of this summer, she disappears without anything being brought to light.</p><hr><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;...... It&#39;s a shame, but if she says she has no business here...&quot;</p><p>I see the girl off that I spent only a short time with. And, behind me,</p><p><strong>Kohaku</strong>: &quot;<em>mumble</em> <em>mumble</em> ...... how is this, Akiha\u2212sama? With this, you can defeat that insensitive blockhead Shiki\u2212san......&quot;</p><p><strong>Akiha</strong>: &quot;ZZzz...... I said, I will not be taken in by your words, Kohaku......&quot;</p><p>The two of them hold a conversation as they talk in their sleep in the ruins of the lobby.</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;......
