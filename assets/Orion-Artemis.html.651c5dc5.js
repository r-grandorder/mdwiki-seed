For fifty years, our love as a married couple has grown stronger!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> He&#39;s been brainwashed...</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> What makes this sad is that...though it could be harmful, this shouldn&#39;t be much of a hindrance to us if we don&#39;t do anything...</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong><br> Now come, let&#39;s do a golden anniversary!<br> Um, what do we do on a golden anniversary?</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong><br> Shall we gather a bunch of humans with the golden touch, like King Midas?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Stop.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Please no.</p><hr><p><strong>Artemis:</strong><br> Oh, you&#39;re right! A golden statue is nothing special these days! ...If that&#39;s the case, it has to be...</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong><br> A Rayshift trip to travel around the world!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> (Mash...)</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> (Yes, I have a very bad feeling about this. They are definitely going to get Senpai in all kinds of trouble...)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> (Let&#39;s just slowly back out of the room so they don&#39;t notice.)</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou!!!</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong><br> !</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> !</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong><br> Teehee, you&#39;re not getting away! Come, Master!</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong><br> You&#39;re going to help make sure our golden anniversary goes beautifully!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Fou...</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Rayshift successful.<br> We have safely arrived at the French seaside.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Good work, Master.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou!</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong><br> Ahhh, what a wonderful breeze! The ocean is outside my jurisdiction but that just makes it all the more exciting.</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong><br> We&#39;re in an era where I don&#39;t have to fight for territory. So let&#39;s have a nice, peaceful talk about our married life!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Huh?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Where&#39;s Orion?</p><hr><p><strong>Artemis:</strong><br> ...Darling!?</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> Hahahaha! Successfully escaped!</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> I mean, I know we&#39;ll eventually go back to Chaldea, so I am definitely going to get punished...</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> But to hell with that!<br> My name&#39;s Orion, the famed hunter of love!!!</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> I&#39;m a hero with a real lust for life, if you know what I&#39;m saying!<br> Because when I&#39;m around, it&#39;s always bear season, eyy!</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> \uFF5E\u266A</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> Whoa! I spy a real sweet hottie over there!</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> I only see the back of her head, but it&#39;s a black-haired beauty! Prim and proper! Looks like I hit the jackpot!</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> Woohoo! I&#39;m gonna snuggle her by pretending to be a cute creature!</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> My body is a cute teddy bear!<br> No one can resist a cute stuffed bear!</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> Hewwo, pwetty wady, I&#39;m Owion!</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> ...!</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> What the...!?</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong><br> Ah!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> What&#39;s wrong?</p><hr><p><strong>Artemis:</strong><br> My goddess senses are tingling! I sense danger!</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong><br> Darling... My darling&#39;s...skull...is getting caved in...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Let&#39;s go save him!</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong><br> Right! Hold on, my darling!<br> We&#39;re coming to rescue you!</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong><br> And then afterwards, if you can explain to me IN DETAIL why you fled, that would be appreciated!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> (Artemis may be worried about Orion, but she is still REALLY angry...)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Huh. Well, he&#39;ll be missed.</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong><br> He&#39;s not dead yet!!!</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong><br> Let&#39;s go, Master!<br> Let&#39;s go and save my darling!</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong><br> There will be many mouths-to-mouths!<br> Much smooching!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I hate to break this to you, but mouth-to-mouth won&#39;t be effective on a caved-in skull!</p><hr><p><strong>Artemis:</strong><br> Ummm, according to my goddess senses, he should be around here...</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong><br> There!</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> Kyuuu...kyuu...kyu...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Orion...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Has turned into a creature that&#39;s only cute...</p><hr><p><strong>Artemis:</strong><br> Come to your senses, Darling!<br> I shall immediately do mouth-to-mouth on you!</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong><br> Hng!!! (Squeeze)</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> Gagck!?<br> ...!?!?!?!?!?!!?!?!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> S-S-S-S-S-S-Senpai! Orion&#39;s face is turning into something unbelievable! Even though he&#39;s only a bear! Even though he&#39;s only a plushie...!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> (Punch Orion with all my might.)</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> Ahhh... Aaaaaagck!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> (Pull Artemis away with all my might.)</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong><br> Kyaaah!? Master, touching someone else&#39;s wife is fiendish!!!</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong><br> And doing so in front of Mash...!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> No, it&#39;s fine! I know this is all a misunderstanding, so I&#39;m not mad!</p><hr><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> I thought I was gonna die. Actually, I did die. TWICE! Once from my caved-in skull, and again from getting suffocated!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I&#39;m glad you\u2013</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> Master. Have you ever wondered why you&#39;re alive?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> A few times...</p><hr><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> We both...have it tough...</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> My apologies... Something like a tiny wild animal jumped on me, so I punched it to smithereens without thinking...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Martha...</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> Yes, I know! I know what you are thinking!<br> But I hope you understand my predicament as well!</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> As you know, in this getup, I become more aggressive than usual.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> So...I couldn&#39;t help it... I&#39;m sorry! I regret my actions!<br> So much so, I will double my praying time!</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> This woman&#39;s amazing.<br> That was the first time I ever felt my insides leaking out.</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong><br> His first time... How dare she be my darling&#39;s first!!</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong><br> This is unforgivable! You&#39;re supposed to be a saint... Have you no shame!?</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong><br> The only person who can hurt my darling is me!</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> Oh boy. Aren&#39;t you just full of cheerful bloodlust.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> And she&#39;s your wife.</p><hr><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> What. A. Let. Down.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> Uh, um... I&#39;m not sure if I can say this, given that I was the one who directly inflicted this holy punishment...</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> Actually, I am not foolish enough to get involved in lovers&#39; quarrels or domestic disputes...</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> I&#39;m not like that, but...Artemis!<br> Your love is a bit too aggressive!</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> First of all, love should be tender, even when you&#39;re hurting your beloved.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> No matter how fiendish, devilish, demonic, or even...um, ursine your partner is\u2014</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> I can say with certainty that unrequited love is no good!</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong><br> It&#39;s not unrequited! We are very much in love!</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> I&#39;m actually a little hurt to be called fiendish, devilish, and demonic.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> No. If it truly was a mutual love, no married man would so casually hit on another woman.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> Even if Orion is guilty, I can see that Artemis also has need for improvement and reform.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> I do not intend to criticize the ways of the Greeks, but I am called the patron saint of wives!</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> Artemis and Orion! I shall correct your twisted, unrequited love with my holy fists!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> This is going to hurt...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Head trauma, here I come...</p><hr><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> Well, yes, I&#39;m afraid that&#39;s the plan! Don&#39;t worry.<br> I will make sure not to hurt you much, Fujimaru!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong><br> Ungh... She&#39;s tough! Darling, were you holding back!?</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> &#39;Course not! I always take battle seriously!</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> Mnnngh...as obsessive and unhealthy as it is, love is still love...I suppose.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> And based on Orion&#39;s behavior, it doesn&#39;t seem like it is completely unrequited love...</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong><br> That&#39;s right! Our love is mutual... It is!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Mutual love... To think of others, and love others.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It doesn&#39;t appear that way... No, but maybe...those two seem to have some bizarre sort of love of their own...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Even if they do not follow the same path, or if it&#39;s unrequited, as long as they respect one another, that may be fine...</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> ...Well, there are indeed very dangerous unrequited affections in this world...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> And yet... I suppose...</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> ...Either way, I seem to have jumped to conclusions. One cannot say that just understanding each other can be called love.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> I&#39;m sorry, Artemis. And Bearion.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> No matter what form it takes, love is unchanging, and it is one of the primal emotions. One should love greatly, and so find great happiness.</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong><br> Our beliefs may differ, but love is the same all around! Orion, let&#39;s love each other to the fullest!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Oh?</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong><br> Huh? I thought my head felt light. Darling&#39;s gone.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> He sneaked away a minute ago.</p><hr><p><strong>Artemis:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong><br> Daaarrrliiing!!!</p><p><strong>--ARROW--:</strong></p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> Fwahahahahaha!</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> I don&#39;t know how or where I escaped to, but looks like I ended up in a different world!</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> What should I do? It&#39;ll be scary if I get found now. Maybe I should hide out here for a couple of days until things cool down.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Oh? Oh my, oh my.<br> A guest. It&#39;s a guest! And it&#39;s a bear!</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Oh, sir! Are you the one she&#39;s been waiting for?</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> Not sure what you&#39;re talking about, but sure!</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> I see. Then we need to have a wedding!</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> Uh, actually, wrong person!<br> I mean, wrong bear!</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> It&#39;s a wedding! The entire country is going to party!<br> The princess will surely be pleased!</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Her prince has come back!</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> Time to be a sneaky bear...</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> No! You can&#39;t run away! (Grab)</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> Gyaaah! Let go! You got the wrong bear!</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> Nothing good can come of me posing as a prince in a fairytale place like this!</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Don&#39;t be so naughty!</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> A bad prince like you...needs to turn into a \u25A0\u25A0\u25A0!</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> This curse won&#39;t break until the princess kisses you!</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> ...What the heck!?</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong><br> Here! I&#39;ve got darling&#39;s scent!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...I&#39;m exhausted.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> You really are getting dragged around the world.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Where could Orion have fled to so quickly?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> You mean...the scent of your prey?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Master&#39;s burn doesn&#39;t have the usual sting...<br> Maybe because jet lag has [\u2642 him /\u2640\uFE0F her} worn out?</p><hr><p><strong>Artemis:</strong><br> What a cute town...</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong><br> After our golden anniversary celebration, I would love to live in a home like this!</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong><br> Master, since you saved the world, I want you to find a nice property for me!</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong><br> And I want you to live nearby, so we can be neighbors!</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong><br> You know, it&#39;s important to have good neighbors!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Good neighbors...</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong><br> Now all I need is my darling...</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Oh? Oh my, oh my.<br> There are so many visitors today!</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> I&#39;m so happy. Adults and children both are welcome in the Land of Sweets!</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Why? Because I can just turn the adults into children, and then it&#39;s fine!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Nursery Rhyme...!</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong><br> Oh my, you are a cutie.<br> But... I&#39;m sorry, my heart belongs only to my darling!</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong><br> But that strange fate of yours, make sure you treasure it, okay?</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong><br> Anyway, have you seen my darling?</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong><br> Darling...?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> The talking stuffed bear.</p><hr><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong><br> Oh no... You can&#39;t! That prince bear is the princess&#39;s!</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong><br> ...What did you just say?</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong><br> The prince has finally come home to his sweet princess!</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong><br> And we&#39;re going to hold a grand wedding party to celebrate! You can&#39;t steal someone&#39;s true love in a fairytale!</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong><br> ...Oh? Uh-huuuh...</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong><br> Hey Master. Sounds like my darling is at the princess&#39;s place.</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong><br> How strange. If he&#39;s not here, where could he be?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> M-Master...this is bad! This is very bad!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I&#39;m afraid the Land of Sweets is going to be set on fire, melting the chocolates and candies... Even the cakes will get charred!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Calm down!</p><hr><p><strong>Artemis:</strong><br> It&#39;s fine. I am calm.<br> But I will never forgive Orion.</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong><br> A grand party with a princess...<br> This isn&#39;t an affair... This is the real deal!</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong><br> This was supposed to be a happy golden anniversary celebration...but to learn that he&#39;s in another serious relationship...! Orion, you dummy!</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong><br> Protect the Land of Sweets, everyone!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I&#39;m not sure if they&#39;re enemies...but let&#39;s ready for battle, Master!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong><br> Kyuuu. I&#39;m dizzy...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Poor Nursery Rhyme is down!</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong><br> I will not allow my darling to get married! I&#39;ll capture that bear and take him to file divorce papers right away!</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong><br> Oh, and Master, use your authority to annul the marriage! That way, he won&#39;t be a divorc\xE9!</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong><br> Darling, where are you!?</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong><br> Um... Excuse me... Are you perhaps looking for a bear?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Brynhild!?</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong><br> Are you the homewrecker!?</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong><br> Please, no... It is not what you think...</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong><br> ...I wanted to return him to you.</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong><br> ...Come again?</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong><br> Darling! No... Look at you...!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> (I thought I saw a similar-looking chocolate during last year&#39;s Valentine&#39;s Day...)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> He&#39;s mouthing something...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> \u201CHelp...\u201D</p><hr><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong><br> Um... I was searching for Sigurd...</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong><br> Nursery brought this bear thinking he was Sigurd...</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong><br> Even when I said he wasn&#39;t, she wouldn&#39;t listen. She said, \u201CHe may be a chocolate bear right now, but he&#39;ll turn into Sigurd when the curse is lifted.\u201D</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong><br> And so I was a little flustered.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Is there a way to lift the chocolate curse?</p><hr><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong><br> Yes... According to Nursery...</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong><br> You KISS him!!!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You what, now?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> What!?</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong><br> Kiss!?</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong><br> Yes, that&#39;s right. Kissing him will lift the chocolate curse!</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong><br> His bear curse may also get lifted, but I&#39;m not sure, since that&#39;s not my specialty!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I see...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> So that&#39;s why Brynhild was flustered... She was afraid that whoever could lift the curse wouldn&#39;t show up if she left.</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong><br> Yes, I was at a loss.</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong><br> This bear is not Sigurd, but there is no doubt he is a hero.</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong><br> No matter what form he&#39;d taken, as a former Valkyrie,<br> I didn&#39;t feel right abandoning him...</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong><br> Hey Master, why do you think darling tries to escape?</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong><br> Weddings, golden anniversary celebrations... They don&#39;t really matter to me... Well, I might not go that far.</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong><br> But as long as my darling just stays with me... As long as he and I can live together forever, for eternity...</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong><br> That&#39;s all I really need.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> He&#39;s scared he&#39;ll start to hate you.</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong><br> Scared...that he&#39;ll hate me?</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong><br> ...That may be correct.</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong><br> No matter how intimate a man and woman might be, if they are together for long enough, they may end up killing each other.</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong><br> That is not because of pure hatred, but hatred that stems from love.</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong><br> The more one loves, the stronger their wish not to detest or be detested becomes.</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong><br> Human emotion is not something that is constant...<br> But it shines all the brighter for it.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> He loves, therefore he wants to be pursued.</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong><br> I know! I know!</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong><br> The prince falls for Cinderella when she flees!</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong><br> That bear flees from you because he wants you to always feel excited!</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong><br> Because eternity is too boring!</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong><br> When you&#39;re super bored, you might start hating the person you&#39;re with!</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong><br> That&#39;s why you flee! The chase keeps you interested in the other person!</p><hr><p><strong>Artemis:</strong><br> ...I see. So that&#39;s how human emotions work.</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong><br> As a Divine Spirit, that kind of thinking is incomprehensible to me. I can&#39;t imagine eternity being...uncertain...</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong><br> ...True, it may not be something you can comprehend.<br> I really only understand it in theory.</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong><br> Eternity is boring... So you say.</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong><br> Aw, my darling is impossible! He wants me to keep loving him by making me so anxious!</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong><br> Fine. If that&#39;s what he wants, I&#39;ll chase after him for eternity!</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong><br> As long as my heart swells from the occasional, whimsical kindness from him, I will go absolutely crazy for my darling!</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong><br> Yes, yes, my Maiden Circuits are in overdrive! Now, my darling! I shall lift your dreadful chocolate curse!</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> Owwwwwwwwwwwwwww!</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong><br> Good morning, my darling!</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> Eh? Huh? I thought I was chocolate...</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> Ack! Artemis!? I-I&#39;m sorry I ran away!<br> It was just a spur of the moment thing! I swear!</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong><br> ...Yep! It&#39;s fine, my darling. I forgive you!</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> Eh, seriously!?</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> Normally this kind of offense would result in you reducing me to my constituent atoms!</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> Wait, did I end up in a parallel world? Is this for real?<br> Oh, no, I&#39;m in a world that&#39;s gonna get pruned, aren&#39;t I!?</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> Oh, but if it&#39;s a parallel world...</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong><br> Come, my darling. Let&#39;s continue our golden anniversary celebration!</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong><br> Where shall we go next? It is a golden anniversary, so maybe the Temple of the Golden Pavilion in Japan?</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong><br> Or perhaps the Golden Gate Bridge?</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong><br> Anywhere is fine. As long as I&#39;m with my darling, it will be wonderful!</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> Why hello there, delicate-looking girl.<br> I don&#39;t see much of your type in Greece.</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> How would you like to escape into a love adventure, hmm?</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong><br> Um... I can&#39;t... My lance will become lighter and lighter...</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong><br> It could even float up and away like a balloon...</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> Wha\u2013whoa!?</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong><br> Okay, my darling.</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong><br> Let&#39;s go get you set on fire at the Temple of the Golden Pavilion. It&#39;s fine, you&#39;ll burn well!</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong><br> Or the Golden Gate Bridge is fine too.<br> You can bungee jump without a rope!</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> Well, I guess that&#39;s one way to go...</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> ...What the heck am I making clever commentary for!? Aaand Artemis is just her usual self!</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> HEEELLLP MEEE!!!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Master, do you have any closing remarks?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Love takes so many forms!</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong><br> That wasn&#39;t...much of a closing remark...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Love is scary!</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> That&#39;s my line.</p><hr>', 671);
