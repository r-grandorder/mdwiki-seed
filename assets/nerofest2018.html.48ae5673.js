The 2nd Nero Fest!</h2><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> What is a festival?</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> It is a party that brings joy to all people, regardless of the era or place!</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> The same can be said for my festival! It can already be considered a spectacle that both Rome and Chaldea are known for!</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> \u201CBut that&#39;s not the true meaning of a festival,\u201D you say? Umu, I shall leave that distinction to the scholarly Servants.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> The dazzling Nero Fest!<br> A joint production between Rome and Chaldea!</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Let the festivities begin!</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> As it is a martial arts tournament held at the Colosseum, many Servants are going to enjoy this.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Hehehe. I am not familiar with mana and the like, but I can feel it! The joy is in the air!</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> A festival of power, modeled after the one once held at Olympia! The people shall praise the courage of warriors!</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Highly trained bodies! A competitive display of skill!<br> What could be more beautiful, more noble!?</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Like admiring a blooming rose, mankind loves to look upon their wonderous possibilities.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> That&#39;s what this Olympic festival, held in my Rome, is all about!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Rome!</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Rome! Indeed!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> All hail Her Majesty!</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Hehehe. Your applause is making me blush.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Yes, I shall permit it!<br> Enjoy this glorious festival!</p><p><strong>A\uFF1AC\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> What is it, Master?</p><p><strong>A\uFF1AC\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> You&#39;re going to participate in this festival thing, right? It&#39;s a great way to let off some steam. Let&#39;s have fun.</p><p><strong>A\uFF1AC\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Will we end up as friends or foes?<br> ...Even I don&#39;t know.</p><p><strong>B\uFF1AC\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Either way, let&#39;s have fun going at it.<br> Right, spearless me?</p><p><strong>A\uFF1AC\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Yeah. You know, hearing that from the spear-wielding version of me kind of pisses me off...</p><p><strong>C\uFF1AC\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Hahah. If it bothers you, I can lend you one, elderly me.<br> This thing was made real quick. I can replace it.</p><p><strong>A\uFF1AC\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Oh, wasn&#39;t this handmade by your last Master or something? I can&#39;t take it.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1AC\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> (Sigh) This is all so stupid.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1AC\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Are you guys really me?<br> Who cares if you have a spear or not?</p><p><strong>D\uFF1AC\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> If two people fight, the strong one wins and the weak one dies. There&#39;s nothing else to it. So shut up.</p><p><strong>All Three:</strong><br> Um... (He&#39;s seriously going to try and murder his opponents.)</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> Leave it to us. We are on stand-by for medical treatment. Even if someone gets the wrong idea and goes out of control...</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> I shall save all my patients. I will not allow any deaths.<br> I shall save them, yes.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> There may be casualties, but no one will die.<br> Rest assured.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> Wait, wait! You&#39;re saying the word \u201Ccasualties\u201D!<br> That includes deaths!</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> Yes, I&#39;ll be very, very careful about cleanliness in the first aid area. We need to be very cautious about disinfecting and sterilizing.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> Don&#39;t worry. I&#39;m here. I&#39;ll be a little diligent about disinfecting and sterilizing.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> Listen to me! Listen to what I&#39;m saying!</p><p><strong>Iri:</strong><br> Martha and Nightingale are truly good friends.<br> Even their jokes are in perfect harmony.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> Oh, Iri. I&#39;m counting on your healing powers.<br> ...Wait, I don&#39;t think she was joking back there!</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> Healing powers?<br> Could you possibly be...</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> Yeah, it&#39;s her healing spells.<br> It&#39;s quite different than my power and your techniques.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> ...a doctor with surgical experience?</p><p><strong>Iri:</strong><br> Huh? A doctor?</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> That&#39;s reassuring. Then yes. We can more than double our efficiency when amputating the limbs of the wounded.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> Wait, wait, wait, wait!</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> Normally, when a Servant manifests, it doesn&#39;t need food to sustain itself...</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong><br> Even so, you get hungry if you move. Even if it&#39;s only a feeling, it&#39;s important to pay attention.</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong><br> Feeling good and feeling down are both made up of half-physical, half-mental states.</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong><br> With all this moving around at the festival, won&#39;t there be an influx of hungry Servants?</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> Yeah. If that&#39;s the case, leave the kitchen and cafeteria to us, Master.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> We&#39;ll keep it running 24 hours a day.</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong><br> Feel free to get hungry anytime!</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong><br> I don&#39;t like the idea of helping that woman&#39;s festival, but I&#39;ll do it for you. Hehe. What a weird feeling.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> Master, we have a favor to ask.<br> We&#39;d like to have Servants who aren&#39;t busy serve tables.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> It would help if you could tell them in advance.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> And...</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> If you could get rid of that Servant who&#39;s been hanging around the cafeteria for a while now...</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong><br> ...What? Why are you looking at me, Archer?</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong><br> I just followed you here in search of snacks.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> \u201CJust\u201D? That&#39;s no excuse. Sheesh.</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> Good timing, Fujimaru!<br> How do you turn off the simulator?</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> Um, actually I...</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> I got lost. Where am I?<br> Why am I walking through the desert again?</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> (Sob, sob) I&#39;m beyond lost... I&#39;m not gonna make it in time for the festival at this rate!</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> Waaahh! I wanna have fun, too! Fun, I say!<br> I wanna play, play, and play some more!</p><p><strong>Tawara Touta:</strong><br> Calm down! You&#39;re the one who woke me up early this morning, saying you wanted to come!</p><p><strong>Tawara Touta:</strong><br> You were the one who activated this simulator thing.<br> Which means you must have set a turn-off time, right?</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> (Sob) A turn-off... time?</p><p><strong>Tawara Touta:</strong><br> Uh-oh. That&#39;s the face and voice she uses when things are bad. Master, turn off the simulator!</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong><br> It&#39;s a festival, right? Then I want to participate too.<br> Is that all right?</p><p><strong>d&#39;Eon:</strong><br> Your Highness, that&#39;s...<br> It might not be what you think it is.</p><p><strong>d&#39;Eon:</strong><br> This tournament is a clash of myths, a battle of supernatural blades in the Colosseum.</p><p><strong>d&#39;Eon:</strong><br> Medical Servants may be standing by, but it&#39;s still dangerous.</p><p><strong>d&#39;Eon:</strong><br> Your Highness, I suggest you simply dedicate yourself to watching from the sidelines.</p><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong><br> Who cares, d&#39;Eon?<br> Let her do what she wants.</p><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong><br> She&#39;ll dance beautifully, no matter where she is.<br> I&#39;ll write the perfect sonata to go along with it!</p><p><strong>d&#39;Eon:</strong><br> No, but...</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong><br> How wonderful. You&#39;re going to write me a sonata?</p><p><strong>Sanson:</strong><br> ...Then I shall do whatever it takes to assure the queen&#39;s safety. I will eliminate all who would hurt her.</p><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong><br> I see, I see. That&#39;s quite a funny joke.<br> Weren&#39;t you one of Robespierre&#39;s dogs?</p><p><strong>Sanson:</strong><br> No, I...</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong><br> Come on, no fighting. It&#39;s a festival.<br> We have to have fun. Right?</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong><br> I met all of you at one time or another during my life...</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong><br> We met at different times but now we&#39;re here together.<br> That&#39;s something very special.</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong><br> And I think it&#39;s wonderful.<br> It&#39;s like a once-in-a-century festival!</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong><br> So you see? It&#39;s a waste to argue. Let&#39;s have fun, okay?</p><p><strong>d&#39;Eon:</strong><br> Right, Your Highness.</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong><br> Then let&#39;s say it together!<br> Ready, set... Vive la France!</p><p><strong>All Three:</strong><br> Vive la France!</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong><br> Oui. Well done!</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> So this festival is based on the same event as the modern Olympics.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> None of them actually existed in my era...</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> But even so, I&#39;m honestly looking forward to participating in this.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> Let&#39;s both do our best, okay?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Fat chance!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Why!? Why should I spend time at a festival with you?</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong><br> Don&#39;t say that. She&#39;s just looking after you.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong><br> It&#39;s partially the will of God, but at the same time, she just wants to be like a good parent to you.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> ...!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Parent? W-Who are you calling my parent!?<br> I-I don&#39;t remember you giving birth to me, stupid!</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> I-I don&#39;t remember giving birth to you either!<br> But you&#39;re still Jeanne d&#39;Arc!</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> Which means you were created from the same Spirit Origin that is the basis for my form.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Nnngh, nnngh, don&#39;t say it!<br> I&#39;ll burn you alive! I mean it!</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong><br> Hahah. Now, now. Calm down.</p><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong><br> Humph.</p><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong><br> Flames of vengeance have taken human form as an Avenger, yet she&#39;s able to mess around with them. That&#39;s impressive, in a way.</p><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong><br> Master, did you know?<br> That Jeanne d&#39;Arc is not Jeanne d&#39;Arc.</p><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong><br> How could a forgery like her exist? Her hatred and rage have turned her whole body to flame.</p><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong><br> And yet, look at her...</p><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong><br> No, I&#39;m sure you understand.</p><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong><br> Do as you will. If you truly desire it, even if this is a farce, I shall lend you my power.</p><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong><br> The Count of Monte Cristo will obey you.</p><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong><br> For instance, I would be more than willing to exterminate that squirming Caster over there.</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong><br> Ooh! Ooh! How could this be!?<br> A second Jeanne, born of my desires...</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong><br> ...is standing next to the one and only Jeanne, and happily talking to her!</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong><br> This was unexpected! Oooh! Oooh!<br> How COOL can this get?</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong><br> You there! You, who is concerned about her just as I am.<br> Come with me.</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong><br> And let us watch over the holy maidens together!<br> Come, come!</p><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong><br> Humph. He was being so stupid I decided to take a break.</p><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong><br> Heh. Servants who&#39;ve gone mad can be such a hassle to deal with.</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> Absolutely not. It&#39;s out of the question.</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> I was indeed a general as well as a Roman soldier.<br> But that was a long time ago. Now I&#39;m just a Saber.</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> Ah, yes! I am a Saber!<br> Unfortunately for me, I was summoned as a Servant.</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> I work in place of my lord. I am truly a slave.</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> I thought that compared to the Greeks or other civilizations, Rome&#39;s slave system was civilized.</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> Yet it&#39;s no different.<br> I do not like it one bit.</p><p><strong>Caligula:</strong><br> You tell me... to fight... Moon Goddess?<br> Diana... I...</p><p><strong>Caligula:</strong><br> Nero... Child of my beloved sister...<br> At the festival that bears your name, I will...</p><p><strong>Caligula:</strong><br> RAAARRGGH! FARMING!</p><p><strong>Caligula:</strong><br> I WILL FARM MEDALS!</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> Relax, relax. Sheesh.<br> You want Nero&#39;s medals more than anybody.</p><p><strong>Romulus:</strong><br> No, Caesar. Let him.</p><p><strong>Romulus:</strong><br> Gather them as you will, Caligula.<br> I see that&#39;s the shape of your heart&#39;s desire.</p><p><strong>Romulus:</strong><br> If you think that way, let it be so.<br> If wanting something means fighting, then you must fight.</p><p><strong>Romulus:</strong><br> It is the same with you, Fujimaru. If you need more Ascension materials, then struggle, and fight.</p><p><strong>Romulus:</strong><br> Rome will accept your battle. I&#39;ll allow it.<br> Desire, seek, love, and fight as you will.</p><p><strong>Romulus:</strong><br> These are also noble acts, and they are also Rome.</p><p><strong>Romulus:</strong><br> However, be careful that you do not become a glutton.</p><p><strong>Gawain:</strong><br> I wouldn&#39;t mind going to the kitchen.</p><p><strong>Gawain:</strong><br> Yes. When it comes to handling root vegetables, I am quite skilled within the Round Table. I am second only to Percival.</p><p><strong>Gawain:</strong><br> Just say the word, Master, and I&#39;ll be happy to demonstrate my skills.</p><p><strong>Lancelot:</strong><br> Calm down, Lord Gawain.</p><p><strong>Lancelot:</strong><br> We will do all we can to serve our Master.<br> Even if what we do isn&#39;t what we&#39;re best at.</p><p><strong>Lancelot:</strong><br> And even if we are split into enemies and allies.</p><p><strong>Gawain:</strong><br> Indeed. That is perhaps the true task of a knight.</p><p><strong>Lancelot:</strong><br> That&#39;s right. Forget about the root vegetables.<br> Do you understand?</p><p><strong>Lancelot:</strong><br> Master, may I ask you a question?<br> Did Mash say anything about me?</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> I am... No, I must be... the most sinful person here...</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> The many sins performed by my other self may not be clearly carved into my Spirit Origin, but even so...</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> Sins do not disappear.<br> Thus, I must still be sinful.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> A fighting tournament...<br> I know I shall shed much blood there too.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> This makes me...sad... (Strum)</p><p><strong>Sanson:</strong><br> No, it is I who am the greatest sinner.</p><p><strong>Sanson:</strong><br> I never wished for it, but as a result of my actions,<br> I spread death and sorrow throughout the world.</p><p><strong>Sanson:</strong><br> And in the end... I killed her...</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong><br> I killed many in the name of my creed.</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong><br> What did I seek, what did I throw away, and what did I gain? Those days are long gone now, but...</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong><br> ...No, this isn&#39;t the place to speak of such things.</p><p><strong>Tawara Touta:</strong><br> Hey, hey. We finally made it out of the simulator and somehow walked straight into some kind of confessional tournament.</p><p><strong>Tawara Touta:</strong><br> Looks like they&#39;re quite the bunch of sinners.<br> Not that I&#39;m one to talk.</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> I&#39;m beyond words... I&#39;m getting sad too...<br> Yep, I have to do something about this.</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> Good begets good, which creates a cycle of ease.<br> Evil begets evil, and creates suffering.</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> Good actions lead to good rewards.<br> Evil actions lead to evil consequences!</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> This is indeed the principle of karma!</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> Confess to me the evil deeds that lie in your past!<br> I&#39;ll hear you out!</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong><br> Oh there you are, Master.<br> Is it true that you met Mr. Holmes?</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong><br> Actually, when I was alive I also...</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong><br> Wait. I&#39;d like to talk more, but they&#39;re calling me from the infirmary.</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong><br> You might be surprised, but I know a thing or two about medicine and pharmaceuticals. I hope I&#39;ll be able to help you and your Servants.</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong><br> See you later!</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> Yo, you came to the festival too, Master? Hey, was there some scrawny weakling walking around here?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> Well, whatever. Fran, let&#39;s go.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> Hey, Fran?</p><p><strong>Fran:</strong><br> ...Uuh.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> Are you done charging?<br> Don&#39;t run out of juice on me, alright?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> We need to show people who the strongest electric-type Servant is. A festival is as good a chance as any.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> I was faster last time, but...</p><p><strong>Fran:</strong><br> Uuuh.</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> ...Nothing happened, you know?</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> Oro? I got fried to a crisp, you say?</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> I don&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking about.<br> Anyway, Master! It&#39;s a Servant tournament!</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> Whoever wins will have all the heroines fall in love with them! This is the perfect chance to build a harem!</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> Come with me and we&#39;ll win the tournament, and maybe \u201Caccidentally\u201D run into some female Servants in the shower room!</p><p><strong>Anne:</strong><br> He&#39;s as energized as always, but he&#39;s definitely fried to a crisp.</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong><br> ...He was annoying some little girl a minute ago.<br> One with a horn. She had bangs covering her eyes too.</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> What are you talking about? I have absolutely no idea!</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> How sad! What a sad case of electrocution!<br> This is where I, DC Detective Edison, come in!</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> I sense a whiff of evil AC about this case!<br> I must solve it quickly!</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong><br> Hah! I&#39;m laughing so hard my muscly sides are about to split! AC is the true light that illuminates the darkness.</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong><br> So I&#39;ll be the one who uncovers the truth!<br> Me, AC Detective Nikola Tesla!</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong><br> I shall hunt down the foolish lightning that burnt the pirate to a crisp! Don&#39;t worry! Electricity knows all!</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong><br> Don&#39;t move, Edison! You&#39;re a suspect in this electrocution case, and I&#39;m going to interrogate you.</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong><br> I shall find the proof as fast as lightning!</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Get out of here with that \u201Cas fast as lightning\u201D nonsense! You trying to be clever!? ...Hang on, that was actually pretty good! Ugh!</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> But I will be the one to solve the case with lightning-quick speed! On your knees, Tesla!<br> My inventions have more patents than yours!</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong><br> ...!</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong><br> Are you still talking about sheer numbers?<br> ...Unfortunate, but not at all surprising, Mr. Lion-Head.</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong><br> It seems you&#39;re unaware that more accurate reviews have been going around in recent times.</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong><br> Hahaha! Everyone&#39;s starting to learn that I, Nikola Tesla, am the true genius that surpassed Edison!</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong><br> In recent years, I&#39;ve been in more movies than you have!</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Shocking! Don&#39;t tell me that in fiction you&#39;ve been making electro-transportation and replication machines!</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> I&#39;m so jealous!</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Excuse me. There was an AC bug there.</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong><br> My apologies. There was a DC cat there.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> All right. War then?</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong><br> Of course. It&#39;s war.</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> Stop! What are you men doing?</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> You&#39;re both too old for this! Grow up!</p><p><strong>Gentleman &amp; Lion:</strong><br> Gwah! You&#39;re...!</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> First you fight at the barbecue, and now here!<br> Do you geniuses ever learn?</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> No matter how old you are, you&#39;re still childish.<br> ...Not like that bothers me, but still...</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> R-Right.</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong><br> ...Right.</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> What is the big idea, going on a rampage in front of all these people?</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> I remember telling you that you should go to the festival if you had the energy to fight.</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> ...Wait, is this my fault?</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> N-No, it&#39;s not! Not at all!</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong><br> Indeed! We just lit a fuse, that&#39;s all!</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> That&#39;s right... This is Chaldea, not the Colosseum.</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong><br> We used the electrocution case as an excuse to do what we wanted. And we caused problems for Chaldea&#39;s staff as well.</p><p><strong>Gentleman &amp; Lion:</strong><br> We&#39;re deeply sorry...</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> As long as you understand.<br> And make sure you apologize to everyone too.</p><p><strong>Gentleman &amp; Lion:</strong><br> Yes, ma&#39;am...</p><p><strong>Asterios:</strong><br> I want to...go. I&#39;m...strong. Even I know.</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong><br> Hmm, you do? But we&#39;re already on a nice, cool, peaceful island.</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong><br> There&#39;s no need to fight here.<br> Or are you bored?</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong><br> A \u201Csimulator,\u201D was it? This illusionary island made by Roman and Da Vinci.</p><p><strong>Asterios:</strong><br> No... Not at all. It&#39;s fun...here...</p><p><strong>Asterios:</strong><br> But...I want to...test...my strength!</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong><br> Aww, once you decide something, you never change your mind. Well, boys will be boys...</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong><br> Fine. Go on ahead and join the festival.<br> But...</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong><br> Listen. You&#39;re strong, but don&#39;t push yourself too hard, okay?</p><p><strong>Asterios:</strong><br> Okay. Thank you...Euryale.</p><p><strong>Stheno:</strong><br> ...Hmmm.</p><p><strong>Stheno:</strong><br> What do you call something like that?</p><p><strong>Stheno:</strong><br> Oh Euryale, do you realize what you are making my face look like right now?</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> (You&#39;re looking wonderful too, Sister!)</p><p><strong>Stheno:</strong><br> ...Come here for a second, will you, Medusa?</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> Why, if it isn&#39;t Master.<br> Leave.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> All this stuff about the festival of Olympia, the Colosseum... It&#39;s completely geared towards muscleheads.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> There&#39;s nothing for us to do. Fight Assassins?<br> I don&#39;t care. Use a Berserker or something!</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong><br> It&#39;s an awful shame, Master, but this time I hereby gratefully refuse.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong><br> If there was something interesting that could inspire me, things might be different...</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong><br> But this time, it&#39;s only muscle! Muscle! Muscle! It&#39;s a celebration of muscle in this resurgent Olympic festival.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong><br> I believe we should stay indoors and focus on our writing. I hope you understand.</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> I&#39;m here too. Let me join in, scribblers!<br> I came! I saw! I slept!</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong><br> He looks so relaxed while the sofa creaks under his weight. What a splendid picture of degeneration!</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong><br> He&#39;s just like a writer before a deadline!<br> Oh, indeed he is.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> He&#39;s a legitimate writer. He is the author of Commentaries on the Gallic Wars, after all.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong><br> Oh. A war chronicle. Excellent.<br> How about we have a different author for each country?</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> A shared world series? Interesting. While they&#39;re having their festival out there, let&#39;s have some fun ourselves.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong><br> All right, time to get started\u2014</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> Zzzzzz...!!</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong><br> He&#39;s asleep already!?<br> And snoring away majestically, no less!</p><p><strong>Karna:</strong><br> I heard Emperor Nero&#39;s declaration.<br> Though I am not quite sure I understood it entirely.</p><p><strong>Karna:</strong><br> Master, I want to make a vow to you here.</p><p><strong>Karna:</strong><br> Without obsessing over victory or defeat, I will show you a fight worthy of being in this tournament.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> ...I did not expect to receive a chance such as this. I am grateful to you, and I am grateful for this good fortune.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> If you say that you will give your all to this festival and its battles, I will fight as well.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> As your enemy, I had the opportunity to slay you three times...</p><p><strong>Karna:</strong><br> I don&#39;t know the details myself, but the battles for the festival supposedly use the simulator.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> What? Is that so?</p><p><strong>Karna:</strong><br> You can test your strength this way without taking anyone&#39;s life. Modern technology never ceases to amaze me.</p><p><strong>Karna:</strong><br> Thinking back, it was the same with Jinako&#39;s game. It uses the movements of electrons to create a pseudo-intelligence...</p><p><strong>Karna:</strong><br> ...that made noises and moved images. Even the legendary scenes in our memories could appear as virtual reality.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> A game...?</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> No. No, that&#39;s somehow different.<br> Don&#39;t change the subject, Karna!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> How trivial.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Such a trivial...trifling matter.</p><p><strong>Ozymandias:</strong><br> Indeed. This is nonsense.<br> It&#39;s worthless to even speak of the reasons.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Seems like we&#39;re on the same page, Sun King.</p><p><strong>Ozymandias:</strong><br> Of course, Golden King.</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> Right, right. That&#39;s exactly right. Why bother imitating an ancient Roman festival? It&#39;s laughable!</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> The great pharaoh has appeared. Thus, when it comes to reviving old things, it should be left to us!</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> Or perhaps... yes, if there was an older, nobler king...</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> No, even then that&#39;s questionable. When it comes to ancient kings, nothing compares to a pharaoh, no?</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> It&#39;s very simple. It&#39;s obvious who the strongest is here.</p><p><strong>Ozymandias:</strong><br> You&#39;re exactly right.<br> Indeed, it&#39;s clear which Heroic Spirit is the strongest.</p><p><strong>Ozymandias:</strong><br> Just like how the sun shines brightly in the sky, the fact speaks for itself. It&#39;s foolish to even question it.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Heh. Your words are too grand.<br> You&#39;re embarrassing me.</p><p><strong>Ozymandias:</strong><br> Oh please. I&#39;m the one who&#39;s feeling embarrassed.</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> (Feeling very nervous)</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> \u201CNero Fest\u201D? Hah!</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> I didn&#39;t get a single scene during the summer swimsuit event! C\xFA was there, but I wasn&#39;t!</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> I had a part in the... what was it? Magical Girl event? But I don&#39;t remember it, and supposedly C\xFA was even more tiny!</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> And now I learn I&#39;m making an appearance, but there&#39;s no C\xFA! What is going on?</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> It&#39;s all men I&#39;m not interested in! And it pisses me off even more because everyone else looks so happy! I&#39;m gonna cry!</p><p><strong>Fionn mac Cumhaill:</strong><br> You can&#39;t let yourself get so depressed.<br> Good luck and good fortune are drawn to smiles.</p><p><strong>Fionn mac Cumhaill:</strong><br> And it&#39;s not all bad. You met me.</p><p><strong>Fionn mac Cumhaill:</strong><br> Not to brag, but I&#39;m strong. If you join with me, winning the tournament won&#39;t be a drea\u2014</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> (Sigh) I wonder if there are any beefy warriors around...<br> At this point, even Master would do...</p><p><strong>Fionn mac Cumhaill:</strong><br> Hmm, she doesn&#39;t even see me!</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong><br> Ooh, she&#39;s fuming. She&#39;s mad! Oh my. An angry Queen Medb is great too.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> Don&#39;t talk like you know.<br> You&#39;re only looking at her body anyway.</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong><br> No, no. That&#39;s not true. I mean, it&#39;s partially true.<br> But I can love more than a girl&#39;s body, you know.</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong><br> It&#39;s one thing to see her as a scheming and dominating queen, but it&#39;s nice to see she can be just a girl sometimes.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> Humph. Is that so?</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong><br> Of course. Sometimes she&#39;s scary, but other times she can be a dame.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> I see. Your easygoing nature can occasionally be a shortcoming.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> Anyway, setting aside her usual debauchery, I&#39;m quite excited about this festival.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> There are so many heroes here. I assume there are some who surpass me. Heheh. Heheheheh...</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong><br> (Gulp)<br> (She is ready to kick some butt...)</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Ooh! So that&#39;s the Colosseum?<br> It&#39;s pretty golden and gorgeous!</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> I see. So it is. It&#39;s finally time to show the true power of the Minamoto clan.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Are you ready, Kintoki? Remember the perilous time when you pursued the Earth Spider into the dark otherworld...</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> ...or when you battled that giant one as big as a divine insect.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> There is no need to hold back.<br> Show me and Master your power!</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Haha! What are you talking about, Boss Raikou?<br> That&#39;s just the spirit heading into war!</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> It&#39;s just a festival, so there&#39;s no need to go all out...</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> No. That won&#39;t do. That won&#39;t do at all, Kintoki.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> You speak the truth, my ancestor!<br> I shall take the heads of all our enemies!</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> If Lord Ushiwaka says so, I shall do the same!<br> I&#39;ll rip the head off one enemy after another!</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Guys, that ain&#39;t what we&#39;re here for!<br> No murders and no decapitations!</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> No killing! No death! Yes, Olympia!</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> No, that won&#39;t do at all! If we&#39;re going to do this, we must be thorough! Otherwise we&#39;ll lose, Kintoki!</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> We do not! Why are you so riled up, Raikou?</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> ...Hehe. Looks like everyone&#39;s here.<br> Goodness me, too much time on their hands...</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> Perhaps the lineup is better than expected...<br> Yes, very well. Let&#39;s play with them.</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Leave it to me, Shuten! No matter how many of these human heroes there are, it makes no difference!</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Or rather, the more there are, the more my flames will burn in excitement. The festival of Olympia will be child&#39;s play.</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> I&#39;m told they use a flame in that festival.<br> If they do, then I shall add it to my Sougenbi!</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> The Olympic flame, was it?<br> I don&#39;t think they&#39;ve got any of that here.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> Oh, and Ibaraki. If you want to come up with evil plans,<br> I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a good idea to say them in front of Master.</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Hmm. I see. I&#39;m not sure what to do then.<br> Hmm...</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> I&#39;ll call off my evil plan!<br> But for now, I&#39;m staying with you, Shuten!</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> Do what you want. More importantly, are we...</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> Are we on your side, Master?<br> Or are we enemies?</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> ...If we&#39;re enemies, my bad! Heheh.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Everyone&#39;s really excited in their own way!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> This is going to be a fun festival, Senpai.<br> I can&#39;t wait!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Let&#39;s go get a bunch of medals!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Let&#39;s make it a fun festival.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Right, Senpai! We&#39;ll have lots of fun!</p>', 340);
