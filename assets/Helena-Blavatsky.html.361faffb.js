She employs a multitude of Magic Foundations that were engraved into the World, thinking that\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014she is manipulating powerful Magecraft by borrowing power from Mahatma. It is unknown if it is true that some higher beings are providing her with that power, or if she just has extremely special Magic Circuits. The Magecrafts that can be used include Summoning, Black Magics, Alchemy, Formalcraft Magecraft[1], Rune Magecraft, Ancient Egyptian Magecraft, and so on, covering many fields. It is also possible for her to employ the Holy Church\u2019s Baptism Rites.</p><p>Also, by employing multiple Magic Foundations simultaneously, Helena can even \u201Cmiraculously\u201D succeed in manipulating extremely powerful Magecraft. Because it is essential for a lot of luck and chance to factor in this as well, it can be concluded that this simultaneous employment does not always work every time, so the effect becomes as such: \u201CThe invocation of extremely powerful Magecraft sometimes occur.\u201D</p><p><strong>Search for the Unknown: [B]</strong></p><p>A direct marketing from Ms. Blavatsky who aims for the Root (Truth).

During her lifetime, Helena wandered from place to place throughout many high societies, having networked with geniuses endowed with a strong individuality such as Edison and Bell, and she occasionally argued with authoritarians and the Magic Association in every direction, having excelled at mediating these sort of things. If she is in a place where many Servants congregate, Helena\u2019s nature is also probably reflected as that of a \u201Cmeddlesome elder sister/mother who is helpful in taking care of people.\u201D</p><p>However, one should not forget that Helena herself is also still a genius endowed with a strong self-assertion. Towards a \u201Cmediocre person\u201D who does not understand the concepts of Mahatma and Hierarchy, it seems that they will not particularly attract her interest, but in the case where she recognized for a moment that they \u201Chave promise\u201D in understanding those concepts, she will probably not let her target get away easily.</p><h2 id="attitude-towards-master" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#attitude-towards-master" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Attitude Towards Master</h2><p>It appears\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014Helena has many wishes she would like to make on the Holy Grail.

A female occultist of the 19th Century, and a founder of Theosophy. One of the leaders in modern occultism. Although she married a Russian aristocrat at a young age, she would immediately elope to live gorgeously in the Magic World. She is popularly known as Madame Blavatsky. Immersing herself in mysticism out of belief of the existence of the Lemurian continent that was said to be a land erased in the ancient times, she came in contact with a higher existence, \u201CMahatma\u201D, and its collective body, \u201CHierarchy\u201D, having acquired an abundant amount of wisdom in the process\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014If that is surely the case, it may not be known that she might have caught sight of a possibility towards the Root.</p><h2 id="character-in-fgo" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#character-in-fgo" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Character in FGO</h2><p>A prodigious mage born as a mutation. She called the pioneers who have reached the Root as \u201CMahatma\u201D and \u201CHierarchy\u201D, and stipulated (assumed) that they are higher existences. Helena herself says that she always felt their messages, but for others to feel the same things, it seems that the same kind of ability (special Magic Circuits) she possesses is needed. It is highly likely that neither the Lemurian continent nor Mahatma actually exists, and she is \u201Cmerely a prodigy who performed a peculiar interpretation of the world.\u201D Up to her last moments, she could not reach an agreement with London\u2019s Magic Association.</p><p>As a Servant, Helena materializes as an all-rounder Caster who manipulates many Magecrafts \u2013 from the ancient times to the modern era \u2013 that became a foundation for Theosophy. Although she can show that she can even so far as manipulate the Ancient Egyptian Magecrafts and the Holy Church\u2019s Baptism Rites, it seems that those ancient ones are not really her forte as expected.</p><h2 id="standard-weapons" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#standard-weapons" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Standard Weapons</h2><p>Helena can carry out magic attacks by means of incantations. She can carry out distant magic attacks not by using attributes such as Fire and Wind, but by projecting pure Magical Energy. Specifically, a book (secret doctrine) floats around and fires beams with a \u2018bang!\u2019</p><h2 id="related-characters" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#related-characters" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Related Characters</h2><p><strong>Edison and Nikola Tesla</strong></p><p>Helena is on good terms with Edison like how it was before when they had a networking connection with each other during their lifetimes. Regarding the relationship between Edison and Nikola Tesla and their eternal rivalry, her comment from an elder sister\u2019s point of view was this: \u201CGood grief, even after they became Heroic Spirits\u2026\u201D</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme</strong></p><p>At any rate, because she remembers \u201CAlice\u2019s Adventures in Wonderland\u201D when she looks at Nursery Rhyme, Helena has mixed feelings. If she says it plainly, it is not a pleasant feeling. For that is because Lewis Carroll, also known as Charles Dodgson, the author of \u201CAlice\u201D, was a supporter of the SPR (The United Kingdom\u2019s Society of Psychical Research). As a Heroic Spirit, Helena Blavatsky happens to go into the relatively calmer group of people, but she cannot get used to being kind to those authoritarians who chased after her during her lifetime. Regarding this matter, she says \u201CI still loathe them.\u201D</p><p><strong>Arthur Conan Doyle</strong></p><p>Although Sir Conan Doyle was a supporter of the SPR, concerning him, his reaction to Helena was somewhat kind.</p><p>\u201CMr. Doyle is by no means a bad person, but he\u2026 was a person involved with the SPR, wasn\u2019t he?\u2026 Um, of course? I understand that Mr. Holmes isn\u2019t bad, right?\u201D</p><p><strong>Indian Heroic Spirits</strong></p><p>To Helena, India is her second home\u2026 or rather, it is even like the home of her soul.
