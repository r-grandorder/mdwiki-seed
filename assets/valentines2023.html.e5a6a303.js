Did anything about that seem strange to you?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Strange?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It all happened so naturally that I didn&#39;t really register it, but now that you mention it...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> There may have been some Servants mingling who don&#39;t normally get along with each other.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> But that&#39;s probably just because this celebration only happens once a year, so everyone&#39;s very excited about it.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Or something?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I guess that could be it...</p><hr><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Hmm, I&#39;m not so sure.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Huh?</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong><br> This whole mood doesn&#39;t really do it for me. Something about it gives me kind of a bad feeling...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Hey Gil.</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong><br> Hi, Master. Hello, Mash.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Kiddy Gil!</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong><br> Ahaha. I don&#39;t mind you calling me that, but maybe out in public isn&#39;t the best place for it.</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong><br> Just call me Gil, like you would if I was your precocious little brother.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> A-a little brother, huh... All right.<br> Anyway...</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Does all this seem off to you too, Gil?</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong><br> It does feel like the atmospheric magical energy density is a little higher than usual.</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong><br> But then again, there are lots of magecraft experts here at Chaldea, and they don&#39;t seem too concerned...</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong><br> So it could all just be in my head.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> High magical energy density? That&#39;s odd. Sheba&#39;s readings are still within standard parameters...</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Gooooood morning! How are you today, Master and Mash?</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Oh, and a good morning to you too, young Gilgamesh. You&#39;re looking clever as ever today!</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong><br> Hmm, this works out nicely.<br> Do you three have plans today?</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong><br> Tom and I only meant to get together for a light tea, but we both just got so caught up in our discussion.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> We certainly did!</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> In fact, we realized we were never going to finish here and were just on our way to Nik&#39;s room to continue our discussion of...</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong></p><h1 id="crosscurrent" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#crosscurrent" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Crosscurrent!!!</h1><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Where we discuss the advantages that both direct and alternating current have to offer!</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Care to join us, Master!? Surely you have impassioned thoughts about electricity of your own that you&#39;d love to share?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Maybe some other time, thanks.</p><hr><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Hmm, I see. Well, that is a great shame.</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong><br> Hahaha. Now, now, Tom, do cheer up.</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong><br> Or am I not enough of a conversationalist to satisfy you?</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Of course you are, Nik! Don&#39;t be ridiculous!</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Very well then, come along, my good man, and let us talk the day away!</p><p><strong>Both:</strong><br> Hahaha, hahahaha!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Well...that happened.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I&#39;ve seen this in a movie somewhere...</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I know what you mean... If we weren&#39;t sure something strange was going on before, we certainly are now.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Come on, Senpai, let&#39;s go to the Command Room.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Something strange is definitely happening here at Chaldea, just like you suspected, Gil!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> We&#39;ve gotta let Da Vinci know about this!</p><hr><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong><br> Nnn, you know, I&#39;m not sure we should be making more work for her.</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong><br> I mean, even with Edison and Tesla back there...</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong><br> Couldn&#39;t it just be that their long and bitter rivalry finally came to an end?</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong><br> I mean, I haven&#39;t experienced this myself, since I&#39;m not my grown-up version...</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong><br> But I have heard that the more you dislike someone, the better friends you become with them after having a knock-down, drag-out fight.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I don&#39;t know. That seems...unlikely with them...</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Come to think of it, one of your Noble Phantasms has the power to see through everything, right, Gil?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Is that why you had a bad feeling about this?<br> Because you noticed something we couldn&#39;t?</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong><br> You mean Sha Naqba Imuru? Unfortunately, it&#39;s not working very well...</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong><br> ...thanks to an even more powerful omnipotent being messing with humanity.</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong><br> ...and there are still some residual imbalances in humanity.</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong><br> ...since you can&#39;t be omnipotent when the entire Earth&#39;s future has been wiped clean.</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong><br> So this is really more of a hunch.</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong><br> Anyway, why were you two at the cafeteria, anyway?<br> Was there something you wanted to do there?</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong><br> Maybe you were waiting for the right time to give a certain special someone a gift?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I... Um...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> No, that can wait until later. Right now, I think we should investigate this hunch of yours.</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong><br> I&#39;m sorry. It was mean of me to ask that.</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong><br> You&#39;re right. Important things should be saved for the right time and place.</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong><br> You shouldn&#39;t do it now, right when it seems like something big is about to happen at any mo\u2013</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Fujimaru! Oh good, you&#39;re there too, Mash.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Sorry to bother you when you&#39;re off duty, but I&#39;m afraid we&#39;ve got something of an emergency here.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Do you guys think you could help me out?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Of course. Actually, we were just on our way to the Command Room.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> What&#39;s the emergency this time?<br> A Singularity?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> No, it&#39;s not that. This abnormality is taking place right inside Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Apparently, we&#39;ve got Shadow Servants<br> running around the place.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Shadow Servants!? And they&#39;re inside Chaldea?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Nnn...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Da Vinci?</p><hr><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Well, the thing is, they definitely<br> look like Shadow Servants...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> But their existence is so...fuzzy that we can&#39;t get a firm reading on them.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> So I was hoping you could go investigate and/or take care of them directly.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Oh, and don&#39;t worry about coming to the Command Room. There&#39;s no need.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> So what do you say, Fujimaru?<br> Will you take Mash and go look into this?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Sure thing!</p><hr><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong><br> Then I think I&#39;ll go, too.<br> You don&#39;t mind, right, Da Vinci?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Oh, hey, Kid Gil! You&#39;re there too, huh?<br> Of course not! That&#39;d be a big help!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> See, I tried asking other Servants around there to help deal with this as well...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> But for some reason, they all said they already<br> had plans or just didn&#39;t feel like it.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Really? All of them?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Yup. But anyway, there&#39;s no point laying into them about it now. Would you guys mind taking a look?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Shadow Servants in Chaldea...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Maybe this is what your bad feeling was about, Gil?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Come on, Senpai, let&#39;s go check it out!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Fujimaru! Oh good, you&#39;re there too, Mash.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Sorry to bother you when you&#39;re off duty, but I&#39;m afraid we&#39;ve got something of an emergency here.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Do you guys think you could help me out?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Of course.

You&#39;re there too, huh?<br> By all means, I&#39;d be grateful for your help.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> See, I tried asking other Servants around there to help deal with this as well...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> But for some reason, they all said they already<br> had plans or just didn&#39;t feel like it.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Really?

Yeah, I guess it is.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> We still don&#39;t know how they got here, but there&#39;s no upside to letting them run around doing whatever.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Hmm. Yeah, I guess it is.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> We still don&#39;t know how they got here, but there&#39;s no upside to letting them run around doing whatever.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> So yeah, go ahead and take care of them now, and we&#39;ll figure out where they came from later.</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong><br> I couldn&#39;t agree more.<br> Well then, here goes nothing.</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong><br> Gate of\u2013</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Wait! Stooop! No Babylon! No Babylon!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> I&#39;m sure yours wouldn&#39;t be as bad as your grown-up self&#39;s, but we still can&#39;t have Servants just slinging around Noble Phantasms all will-nilly in the halls!</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong><br> Hang on. Did you just say I&#39;m weaker than the adult me? Ouch.</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong><br> I know I&#39;m a kid, but my Noble Phantasm still works fine. I know how to control it, too.</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong><br> Don&#39;t worry. I was only going to use it to restrain them, anyway.</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong><br> \u201CBeating\u201D your opponents just by killing them is the kind of shortsighted thing grown-ups who are too lazy to think big picture do.</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong><br> There, see? I&#39;m just going to neutralize them one by one.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> C-classy as the legendary king you are...</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It&#39;s working! Gil&#39;s chains just captured all five Shadow Servants!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> All right, Master, let&#39;s go deal with these potentially hostile entitie\u2013</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Look out!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Khh... There are even more than we realized!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I&#39;ll handle this shadow, Master!<br> You help Gil\u2013</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Huh?</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> What happened, Master? You and Mash are usually way more careful than that. You get sloppy &#39;cause it&#39;s a holiday or something?</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Times like this are exactly when you&#39;ve gotta pay attention to your surroundings!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> C\xFA Chulainn!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> C\xFA Chulainn! Thank you for helping us!</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Don&#39;t bother thanking me. I was just getting warmed up.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> If anything, I&#39;m sorry I took so long to get here.<br> Didn&#39;t realize you guys needed help at first.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Anyway, this works out nicely. I was just looking for something to do.</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong><br> Really?</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong><br> I&#39;d say if anyone here&#39;s being sloppy, it&#39;s you. Shouldn&#39;t you be more on top of things, being a grown-up and all?</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Me? Shouldn&#39;t you be telling your own grown-up self that, too?</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Next time you&#39;re at a mirror, why don&#39;t you pass him a message that he should try to hang on to at least a tenth of the wisdom and modesty you&#39;ve got as a kid!</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong><br> Well, I do agree with that, but unlike you, I&#39;m just as wise no matter what age I am.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Yeah? That your way of saying you&#39;ve always been this dumb!?</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Ah, but never mind. This ain&#39;t the time to be arguing.<br> C&#39;mon, Fujimaru and Mash!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Uh... R-right! I&#39;m good to go at any time!</p><p><strong>==ARROW==</strong></p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Dammit, they just keep regenerating as soon as you cut them down! We&#39;ll never get anywhere like this!</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> These things are as tough as Clan Calatin! We&#39;ve gotta figure something out before they destroy all of Chaldea!</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong><br> Excuse me, Command Room? Is there any way we can get rid of these things for good?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Sorry! I wish I could tell you, but we&#39;re still analyzing these things! We&#39;ve never seen anything like them!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> All we know so far is, they don&#39;t have Spirit Cores, their Spirit Origins disperse, and your attacks make them disappear!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Sorry! I wish I could tell you, but we&#39;re still analyzing these things! We&#39;ve never seen anything like them!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> All we know so far is, they don&#39;t have Spirit Cores, their Spirit Origins disperse, and your attacks make them disappear!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> The only thing is, they&#39;re not staying that way!<br> Man, I wonder why they keep coming back!</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> ...She&#39;s really enjoying this, isn&#39;t she? Whose idea was it to put her in charge, anyway?</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong><br> Hey, I think it&#39;s great that we&#39;ve got someone so enthusiastic about her job backing us up. In the meantime, we&#39;ll just have to do the best we can to wrap things up he\u2013</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong><br> Hang on. Is someone there!?<br> I just got some major chills down my spine!</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Well, well, your senses are quite refined. I wish my assistants had that kind of sensitivity.</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong><br> Aah! I&#39;ve never felt chills like this before!<br> No, wait. It&#39;s actually kind of familiar!</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Buon giorno. Don&#39;t worry, I mean you no harm.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Allow me to explain why those things refuse to stay gone.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> They are not actually Shadow Servants.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Who are you!?</p><hr><p><strong>???:</strong><br> There is no point in using violence against those born in the depths of darkness.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> No, there is only one way to truly make them disappear.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Hehe. Only one way, huh. That&#39;s pretty bold, even for me.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> But I&#39;m not embarrassed at all,<br> since it&#39;s the unvarnished truth.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> You see, the only way to get rid of them is something that is of utmost importance to all humans...</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Love.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Nothing more, nothing less.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Love? Did she really say \u201Clove\u201D?</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> ...You&#39;re not very sensitive at all, are you?<br> Are you sure you&#39;re the ultimate Celtic ladies&#39; man?</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> The very same who jumped into bed with every beautiful woman he met on his travels even after he gave his true love a castle?</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> ...Ugh, just saying it out loud irritates me all over again. Are you just that selfish, or does your \u201Clittle spear\u201D actually have a mind of its own?</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> You&#39;d better apologize to A\xEDfe the next time you see her.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> I know, I know! It was all my fault, okay!? Now would<br> you mind keeping your nose out of my business!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> (That&#39;s a hell of a way to talk to someoneyou just met... Who is this girl, anyway?)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> (The ultimate Celtic ladies&#39; man, huh.)</p><hr><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Hehe. I only got the broad strokes but those were some lovely thoughts.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> You pass. I officially recognize you as a Master worthy of being hoisted into the air.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Hello, and good day. Your fortune this morning is five out of five stars.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Your romantic outlook for today is, \u201CPrepare for unexpected encounters.\u201D Put another way, \u201CTrust the goddess before you rather than the person next to you.\u201D</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> That&#39;s right. I have deigned to descend from on high to raise your fortun\u2013</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> ...I suppose I should have known they wouldn&#39;t be polite enough to let me finish. Oh well.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> I usually make it a point never to provide help without an explicit agreement, but in this case, I suppose I can consider it part of my sales pitch.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Feel free to command me as you see fit, Master.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> This is your chance to test your power as a Master and the power of my love to your heart&#39;s content.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Huh!? Did she just form a temporary contract with you, Master!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Looks like she did!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> All right then, let&#39;s get to work!</p><hr><p><strong>==ARROW==</strong></p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> All right, let me show you what I was talking about. Just sit back and enjoy the show.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> This is the light of love that banishes darkness...</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> The light of love that will fill the entire world!</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> God Bazooka.<br> Die.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Phew...</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Was it good for you, too?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Back up. Did you just tell them to die!?</p><hr><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Who, me? Don&#39;t be silly.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Also, that was clearly just a bazooka blast.<br> Where did love come into it!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Er... That said, the, uh\u2013non-Shadow Servants?<br> \u2013do seem to have disappeared now...</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> ...(She&#39;s bad news, isn&#39;t she?)<br> (*Conveyed to Kid Gil via subtle wink)</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong><br> ...(Oh yes.

She&#39;s a friend of yours, right?</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> So go on, get her out of here already.<br> And make sure she never comes back.</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong><br> Hahaha, don&#39;t be ridiculous. This is the first time I&#39;ve seen such a person around Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong><br> If anything, you&#39;re the one who<br> seemed to recognize her.</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong><br> Are you sure she&#39;s not from your neck of the woods?<br> Maybe you used to date her or something.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Now who&#39;s bein&#39; ridiculous!? Trust me, not even the Celts go in for love that crazy!</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> No, I&#39;ve never seen her before, either.<br> She looks vaguely familiar, but that&#39;s all.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Besides, no way would I forget such an evil face.</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong><br> There, you see?

When did you two become such whiny little mongrels, anyway?</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Careless words lead to disaster, and vague memories lead to confusion. So if you&#39;re ever unsure whether you should say something, here&#39;s an easy rule of thumb: don&#39;t.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> So, um...

One I&#39;m pretty sure you&#39;ve all heard before.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> You know, the adorable little cherub who carries arrows of love, much like Artemis?</p><p><strong>Amor:</strong><br> Cupid.</p><p><strong>Amor:</strong><br> Yes, I&#39;m sure you all do know me as Cupid,<br> the cherub of love.</p><p><strong>Amor:</strong><br> But that doesn&#39;t matter right now.</p><p><strong>Amor:</strong><br> The Spirit Core that makes me me may be Amor, but as far as I&#39;m concerned, the only one I consider to be the lord of the heavens is God the Father.</p><p><strong>Amor:</strong><br> So really, I&#39;d rather you didn&#39;t call me Amor or Cupid.</p><p><strong>Amor:</strong><br> I&#39;m not a Greek god of love, but rather an agent of the Holy Spirit\u2013a missionary of love, if you will.</p><p><strong>Amor:</strong><br> So please, call me Caren C. (for Cupid) Hortensia.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Hmm. God the Father, huh.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> That makes it sound like you&#39;re<br> affiliated with the Holy Church.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> And that would mean your current sense of self comes from your vessel, rather than from Amor.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> I see. So you&#39;re a Pseudo-Servant who&#39;s entrusted<br> their power to their human vessel&#39;s personality.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Hmm. God the Father, huh.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> That makes it sound like you&#39;re<br> affiliated with the Holy Church.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> And that would mean your current sense of self comes from your vessel, rather than from Amor.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> I see. So you&#39;re a Pseudo-Servant who&#39;s entrusted<br> their power to their human vessel&#39;s personality.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Hmm. Given that most people who get chosen as vessels for gods tend to not exactly be...well, normal...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> I wonder where you&#39;ll fall on that spectrum...</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> All right, that&#39;s enough fan service.<br> I&#39;m going to go back to my regular outfit now.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Oh wow, your outfit is beautiful!<br> Are you a student, Amo\u2013er, Caren?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Your clothes are very chic, of course, but I especially love your hat! It&#39;s so cute and elegant!</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> No, I&#39;m not a student per se... This is just the new outfit I had made up for this occasion.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> I&#39;m glad to hear you like it, though.<br> Collecting hats is one of my few hobbies.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Your few hobbies...?</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> Thank you, Mash\xE9rie. May I give you an arrow of love as a token of my appreciation?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Th-that&#39;s all right, thank you!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Also, it&#39;s \u201CMash\u201D not Mash\xE9rie!</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> I see. How very selfless of you.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> It&#39;s too bad you won&#39;t take a treat when it&#39;s offered. (For one thing, it&#39;s so much more boring...)</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> All right, what if I played you a song on my organ then? Perhaps Bach&#39;s Cantata BWV 147, in honor of getting to know one another?</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> It&#39;s one of the few things I&#39;m proud of.</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong><br> Only a few, huh?</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> (Slaps)</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong><br> Ow, ow, ow!</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> What was that for!?</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> Pardon me. I sensed you two were slandering me for no good reason.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> As for you, I&#39;ve noticed you haven&#39;t so much as batted an eye at anything I&#39;ve said or done since I arrived.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> You must be either extremely important, or just extremely easygoing.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> Which means...you must be Fujimaru,<br> the Master of Chaldea. Right?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> That&#39;s me.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> You got it.</p><hr><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> ...Hehe. That&#39;ll be another thing worth testing, then...</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> You&#39;ll have to forgive me for pressuring you to accept that, um, temporary contract earlier.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> It was just a means to an end to let me receive orders from you...</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> So if you ever find our connection to be a burden, please feel free to sever it at any time.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Um, Caren C. Hortensia?</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> Hm? ...Oh, you mean me. Well, that certainly is a lot<br> to say every single time, isn&#39;t it? It&#39;s okay, you can just call me Caren.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> A-all right.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Caren, do you know anything about those not-Shadow Servants?</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> Ah, those?

Unfortunately, I can&#39;t think of a simple explanation for that.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> I expect it probably has something to do with Valentine&#39;s Day, though. Especially since I&#39;m here, too.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Um, can you elaborate on that?</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> It wasn&#39;t Fujimaru that summoned me here.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> It was this festival of love you call Valentine&#39;s Day that called me here temporarily.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> Valentine&#39;s Day is the cause of all of this.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> It was Valentine&#39;s Day that birthed those evil spirit creatures...</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> And it was Valentine&#39;s Day that summoned me here as a missionary of love.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> Now do you get it?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I really don&#39;t.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Not even a little.</p><hr><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Right? I don&#39;t even know what the hell you were trying to say.</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong><br> I do wish you wouldn&#39;t try to make arguments with foregone conclusions.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> Ahem. I was explaining the reason I was summoned here.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> I am a missionary here to save Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> I sensed the encroaching threat that Valentine&#39;s Day posed\u2013by which I mean those evil spirit creatures...</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> ...so I was sent here in the Lord&#39;s name to save you all from that threat.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> Well, it may not have happened exactly like that, but you understand what I am saying, yes?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> (So, how does the bazooka fit into all that...?)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> (So Valentine&#39;s Day is a threat, huh.

That&#39;s a lot of QP, and this is me talking.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Wouldn&#39;t you know it, I&#39;m fresh out of zeroes...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> You call this \u201Cmodest\u201D!?</p><hr><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> I&#39;m so sorry. I can be a bit naive when it comes to<br> the world of the [\u2642 working man /\u2640\uFE0F working woman]... Are you perhaps<br> struggling to buy food or something?</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> I really thought I had done my homework about what the going rates were these days, too... But, I&#39;m afraid that&#39;s going to be a problem.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> We can&#39;t defeat the Bitters without the bazooka, but I simply won&#39;t pay for its cartridges myself...</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> Hmm... Hmmm...<br> Oh, I just had an idea.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> What if we did something like this?</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> Instead of paying me directly to use my bazooka, you could all collect materials I can exchange for mon\u2013</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> Ahem. I mean, which I can use to make more godly cartridges.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> What&#39;s more, as luck would have it...</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> There&#39;s plenty of small bits of magical energy floating around that can&#39;t become Bitter Shadows.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> You won&#39;t need my bazooka to handle them, and as they say, a penny saved is a penny earned.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> So I&#39;d like you all to work tirelessly to eliminate those bits, collect materials, and donate them to me.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> You don&#39;t mind doing that, right? It&#39;s all to restore peace to Chaldea, after all.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> Good. Then I&#39;ll be counting on all of you to keep those donations coming.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Well, I guess Valentine&#39;s Day&#39;s isn&#39;t gonna save itself.</p><hr><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> ...Yeah, all right.<br> I&#39;m not gonna back out now after coming this far.</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong><br> Something tells me just getting rid of the Bitter Shadows isn&#39;t going to be the end of this, though.</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong><br> It can&#39;t be a good sign that both our warrior&#39;s intuitions are telling us this is a bad idea.</p><h2 id="section-3-lost-sheep" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-3-lost-sheep" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 3: Lost Sheep</h2><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> I was given knowledge of this place when Amor chose me for his vessel...</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> ...but it&#39;s still a surprise to see the Chaldea Security Organization up and running.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> All these different Heroic Spirits coming together to face a threat to the very world and restore humanity...</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> Well, it&#39;s all very inspiring.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Any chance you might want to join them, Caren?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> You know, we could really use your help, too.</p><hr><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> Of course.

Ms. Caren?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> So, you&#39;ve met them before, then?</p><hr><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> Wh-wh-wh-wh-what&#39;s going on!? What are you doing here!?</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> Yeah! What are you doing here, Ms. Caren!?</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> No, wait. Hang on.</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> I think there&#39;s something...different about her.</p><p><strong>Miyu:</strong><br> ...She does seem a lot smaller.</p><p><strong>Miyu:</strong><br> Maybe...she&#39;s Kid Ms. Caren?</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong><br> Hmm, I can&#39;t say I care for this trend of attaching \u201CKid\u201D to anything and everything.</p><p><strong>Miyu:</strong><br> Oh... I&#39;m sorry.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> So what&#39;s this all about?</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> You girls all know who this is already?</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> Well, yeah. She was our school nurse.</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> Although, that Ms. Caren was more<br> grown-up than this one is.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> Are you...</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> Never mind. I understand now.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> You see, I&#39;m a Pseudo-Servant acting as a vessel for Amor the Divine Spirit...</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> And unfortunately, I have no memories of the time we presumably spent together.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> Perhaps this means the version of me you met was from a different world than I am?</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> Aww, really?</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> And here I was excited to meet someone I knew in my original world.</p><p><strong>Erice:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> Oh dear, is something wrong?</p><p><strong>Erice:</strong><br> Ulp. N-no, nothing&#39;s wrong. It&#39;s just... Um...</p><p><strong>Erice:</strong><br> Right... Of course. I knew this couldn&#39;t possibly be the case, but...</p><p><strong>Erice:</strong><br> For just a moment, I thought you might be Caren Fujimura, is all...</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> (Fujimura...)</p><p><strong>Miyu:</strong><br> (As in Ms. Fujimura?)</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> (Where did that name come from?)</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> I have no way of knowing what sort of chaotic world you may have come from...</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> But I do apologize if I inadvertently gave you the wrong idea.</p><p><strong>Erice:</strong><br> Oh no, not at all!</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> Still, after hearing all that,<br> there is one thing I do know.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> I must have been one of your favorite teachers, and you all must have admired me deeply.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> I can almost see it now. Me, smiling and happy, surrounded by a group of adoring children.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> Yes, I can almost...almost...</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Something wrong?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Um... Having a little trouble picturing it after all?</p><hr><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> ...So it would seem. I guess my imagination isn&#39;t as strong as I thought.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> You sure you&#39;re not just keenly aware that there exists no universe where that would ever happen?</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> Shut up.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Yeow!</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> Now, where were we...? Oh, yes. I have a very clear mental picture now.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> Erice, was it?</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> I can tell that you must have respected me\u2013<br> I mean, this other Caren, a great deal.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> What a beautiful teacher and student relationship you must have had.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> That goes for the rest of you, too. Thank you for adoring the me you knew in your worlds.</p><p><strong>Erice:</strong><br> N-not at all, um, God Caren!<br> You&#39;re much too kind!</p><p><strong>All Three:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> (A beautiful teacher and student relationship, huh...)</p><p><strong>Miyu:</strong><br> (I definitely don&#39;t think I&#39;d put it like that...)</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> (She really does remind me a lot of Ms. Caren, though...)</p><p><strong>Erice:</strong><br> By the way...</p><p><strong>Erice:</strong><br> Can I ask what brings you to Chaldea...Caren? Did our Master summon you here?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Yeah, about that...</p><hr><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> I see. Bitter Shadows, huh.</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> I had no idea things like that<br> were roaming around Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> Ohhh, so that&#39;s what&#39;s going on here.</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> ...Wait. Isn&#39;t that kind of a big deal?</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Yeah, kind of. There&#39;s not a whole lot we can do until we figure out where they&#39;re coming from, after all.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> So we&#39;re basically just wandering around seeing what&#39;s up. Guess those Bitter Shadow things and us have that in common.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Has anything out of the ordinary caught your eye lately?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Have you noticed anything out of the ordinary?</p><hr><p><strong>Miyu:</strong><br> Out of the ordinary...</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong><br> Oh? Do you have an idea, Miyu?</p><p><strong>Miyu:</strong><br> Well, um, it&#39;s probably not that big a deal...</p><p><strong>Miyu:</strong><br> But there is a new kind of chocolate being sold here that&#39;s been all the rage lately.</p><p><strong>Miyu:</strong><br> It&#39;s so hard to get ahold of that everyone calls it elusory chocolate.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Gotcha. So it&#39;s the kind of thing where stores make up some special limited edition item to drum up interest, right?</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong><br> Come on, C\xFA Chulainn, you don&#39;t have to put it like that.</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong><br> It may be something of a last resort, but these struggling small businesses need to spread the word somehow, right?</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> ...At least I didn&#39;t call it a \u201Clast resort\u201D...</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Anyway, what about this elusory chocolate struck you as being out of the ordinary?</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> Well, we&#39;ve only heard rumors ourselves,<br> and we&#39;re not sure how credible they are...</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> But they say that the merchant selling this chocolate comes and goes in the blink of an eye...</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> ...And that they wear a paper bag over their head. A real simple one, like they give you at bakeries and stuff.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...A paper bag.</p><hr><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> The hell!? No, seriously, what the hell&#39;s that all about!?</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong><br> I-I do have a hard time seeing how that could have any connection to this Bitter Shadows incident...</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong><br> Are you sure it&#39;s even someone from Chaldea?</p><p><strong>Miyu:</strong><br> Everyone says it&#39;s probably just the kykeon lady or someone from the Servantverse...</p><p><strong>Miyu:</strong><br> ...and they don&#39;t seem concerned at all.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Guess it&#39;s possible to get TOO used to stuff like this...</p><hr><p><strong>Erice:</strong><br> Hmm...</p><p><strong>Erice:</strong><br> Those guys seemed like they were anxious about something today, too.</p><p><strong>Erice:</strong><br> I wonder if that had anything to do with these Bitter Shadows...</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong><br> Oh?</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong><br> Did you sense something amiss too, Ms. Erice?</p><p><strong>Erice:</strong><br> I wouldn&#39;t be that specific really. It&#39;s more like...a general feeling of unease?</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> Erice, was it?</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> I think I understand why this Caren Fujimura you knew was concerned about you.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> It&#39;s because you, me, and Caren Fujimura...</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> ...all have the same kind of secret, isn&#39;t it?</p><p><strong>Erice:</strong><br> !!!</p><p><strong>Erice:</strong><br> So, you could tell. I thought you might be able to.</p><p><strong>Erice:</strong><br> Then, does that mean that you also\u2013</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> Oh yes, I could tell right away. You have...</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong></p><h1 id="fabulous-fashion-sense" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#fabulous-fashion-sense" aria-hidden="true">#</a> ...fabulous fashion sense!</h1><p><strong>Erice:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Erice:</strong><br> ???</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> You&#39;re boldly exposing a great deal of skin,<br> all while retaining an unflappable demeanor.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> That is something only one attempting to offer herself to a divine domain could do.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> What&#39;s more, that avant-garde outfit of yours is, to put it modestly, utterly perfect!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Can&#39;t say I saw that one coming.</p><hr><p><strong>Erice:</strong><br> ...So you noticed.</p><p><strong>Erice:</strong><br> Yes. This outfit is my attempt to honor the Holy Grail&#39;s accords while complying with Chaldea&#39;s dress code.</p><p><strong>Erice:</strong><br> It&#39;s based on simple, ancient Japanese clothing, and it&#39;s my way of paying my respects to outfits like omigoromo and chihaya, worn for holy rituals.</p><p><strong>Erice:</strong><br> But I still have a long way to go before I can hope to measure up to my inspirations! That&#39;s why I sometimes inadvertently embarrass some of the people I come across...</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> There&#39;s no need to be so modest.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> Just because society at large doesn&#39;t understand you doesn&#39;t mean you need to hide who you are.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> I once went by a certain nickname, and now, I think it&#39;s only right that you go by it yourself.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> From here on, you should call yourself...</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> The Commando Queen.</p><p><strong>Erice:</strong><br> B-but, I&#39;m NOT going commando!</p><p><strong>Erice:</strong><br> Th-then again, i-if you of all people think I should...</p><p><strong>Erice:</strong><br> I suppose I could at least think about giving it a\u2013</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> Gotcha.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong></p><h1 id="god-flash" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#god-flash" aria-hidden="true">#</a> God Flash!!!</h1><p><strong>Erice:</strong><br> Ghh...<br> What...is this...?</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> I knew it.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> You had another secret as well.</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> Erice!? Huh!? What&#39;s going on!?</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> Hmm. This isn&#39;t strictly accurate, but for the time being, let&#39;s just say she&#39;s been possessed by a demon.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> You see, your body is overly acclimated to hosting things of that nature.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> The beam of light I struck you with completely lowered your defenses and exposed the cracks in your heart.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> Now, all the corrupt magical energy floating around Chaldea has been drawn to you to take advantage of them.</p><p><strong>Erice:</strong><br> Huh? Then, you knew this would happen?</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> Of course. Oh, and before you get angry at me, you should know that it was a necessary sacrifice.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> ...Wait. That sounds like it might<br> be someone else&#39;s catchphrase...</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> Let me rephrase that then. I had no choice.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> I&#39;m exhausted, and I didn&#39;t want to run around looking for that magical energy, so I thought I&#39;d have it come to me\u2013well to you, instead.</p><p><strong>Erice:</strong><br> And you never thought to ask me first!?<br> What kind of a teacher are you!?</p><p><strong>Erice:</strong><br> Khh... My right hand... It&#39;s throbbing...!</p><p><strong>Erice:</strong><br> Everyone, please...get away from me...!<br> I can&#39;t...hold it back...much longer...!</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> I knew it. That&#39;s just how I thought you&#39;d react.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> Now that they&#39;ve possessed her, this Bitter Shadow has managed a partial physical manifestation.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> Firing my bazooka at them now<br> isn&#39;t going to have much effect.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> So I&#39;d like all of you to neutralize Erice first.</p><p><strong>Miyu:</strong><br> Um, what exactly do you mean by \u201Cneutralize\u201D?</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> Hit her until she stops moving. Obviously.</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> THAT&#39;S your plan!?</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> You, uh, might want to rethink your methods a little bit going forward...</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong><br> She&#39;s certainly not a sterling example of a fettered hero, is she?</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> E-even so, we still have to do what she says,<br> at least for now!</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> Hang in there, Erice! I promise we&#39;ll save you!</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> Wonderful. Now that is true friendship for you.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> I&#39;m sure the Lord will be pleased to see you girls playing together like this, even if you do end up a bit bruised in the process.</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> Is the whole concept of remorse just completely foreign to you!?</p><p><strong>==ARROW==</strong></p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> Now! God Bazooka, fire!</p><p><strong>Erice:</strong><br> Urk...</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> Thank you, Erice.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> Chaldea is safe once more, and I couldn&#39;t<br> have done it without your cooperation.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> \u201CCooperation,\u201D huh...</p><hr><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Damn, that&#39;s kind of impressive. I wonder what you gotta eat to develop a skin that thick...</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong><br> Illya, I&#39;m sorry to ask, but would you mind taking her to the infirmary?</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong><br> Also, you should probably just stay there while you&#39;re at it, if only to keep the, uh, \u201Csacrifices\u201D to a minimum.</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong><br> Honestly, I&#39;m not thrilled at being mixed up in this myself, but it&#39;s too late for me to back out now.</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> Th-thank you, Gil!<br> Um... Good luck, I guess!</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> Don&#39;t you die on us, you hear!?</p><p><strong>Miyu:</strong><br> Um, I don&#39;t think we have to worry about that, at least...</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> Hmm... Well, I guess I won&#39;t be able to use that trick anymore.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> Not that I was planning to do so again, anyway.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Oh really, now?</p><hr><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> Hehe.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> Don&#39;t you remember what I said about her fabulous fashion sense?</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> I really like her style, so I wouldn&#39;t ever want to put her through the wringer...more than once a day.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> (So she did know she was putting Erice through the wringer...)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> (I wonder if the original Ms. Caren was...like this.)</p><hr><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> At any rate, that takes care of all the wicked magical energy in this area.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> Which, unfortunately, also means the end of our fun break hanging out with those nice girls.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> Still, that&#39;s a small sacrifice to make to protect Valentine&#39;s Day.

Since you&#39;re Eros, the god of erotic love...</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> I bet you&#39;ll have no problem turning this place into a world positively dripping with love, just the way I like...</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> ...even with all these Goody Two-shoes fighting you at every turn.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> (...Hehe.)</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> (Yes, that&#39;s right. I can just let this newcomer handle everything, and I won&#39;t have to lift a finger.)</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> (All I&#39;ll have to do is hole up in my room and check in on Master every now and then to see if [\u2642 he&#39;s /\u2640\uFE0F she&#39;s]<br> ready to sink into depravity once and for all.)</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> It&#39;s perfect!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I don&#39;t know what that was about, but I&#39;ve got a bad feeling about it...</p><hr><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> True, I suppose we would have a lot in common...<br> if I was, in fact, Eros.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> Huh?</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> But as we are now, lust simply isn&#39;t important to us.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> That being said, we won&#39;t deny that it, too, has a place.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> That place just happens to be a good bit...<br> below our particular station.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> Hehe. Still, it&#39;s been a pleasure to meet you.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> (Wh-why that little...!)</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> (...No, wait.

It should be illegal!</p><p><strong>Sei Shounagon:</strong><br> I knew I was right to force you to come here, Kama.<br> You guys are gonna get along great!</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong><br> Um, I&#39;m not so sure about that. If anything, they look almost ready to kill each other...</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> I don&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking about. It doesn&#39;t look anything like that to me. Nope.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Seriously, kid, you don&#39;t want to get mixed up in a catfight. They&#39;re more dangerous than a wounded bear.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> It&#39;s better to just play dumb before they remember you&#39;re there and make you pick a side.</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong><br> I see.

Nagiko? U-uh, thank you!</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> Bitter Shadow? I don&#39;t know what that is,<br> but it sounds annoying.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> I don&#39;t need that kind of hassle, so I&#39;ll just let you guys go take care of\u2013</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> On second thought, I&#39;ll help, too.<br> After all...</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> It should be an excellent chance for Eros there to see what I can really do.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> (I honestly don&#39;t care whose kind of love is baser or loftier...)</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> (But the idea of this naive little twit who&#39;s never been incinerated by Shiva&#39;s third eye thinking I can&#39;t hack it just pisses me off.)</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> (Plus, when I pawn my job off on her, I don&#39;t want her thinking it&#39;s because I&#39;m some low-tier god who can&#39;t clean up my own messes or anything.)</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> (No, I want her to feel honored that she gets to spare me from having to sully my own hands.)</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> (If I have to show off what I&#39;m really capable of to make that happen, then fine.)</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> Oh my, that&#39;s very courageous of you. No wonder you were so famous in Indian mythology.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> But, unfortunately...</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> ...I just don&#39;t think your particular traits are going to be of much use here.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> Wha...!?</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> O-of course they will be!<br> Wait right here and I&#39;ll prove it!</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> I can easily handle some fake Shadow Servants by myself!</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> Come on, you idiot!

Weren&#39;t you just talking about how you could handle this yourself?</p><p><strong>Sei Shounagon:</strong><br> Oh well, no biggie to me.<br> I&#39;m just glad to be asked to help!</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong><br> Th-they ran off before we could say anything...<br> Maybe we ought to go after them?</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Why? Anyone can beat those Bitter Shadow things as long as they have the power of love, right?</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> So since Kama&#39;s technically a god of love too,<br> why don&#39;t we just let her take care of it?</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong></p><h1 id="what-the-hell" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#what-the-hell" aria-hidden="true">#</a> What the hell!?</h1><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> I destroyed those things a bunch of times,<br> but they just kept reviving!</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> Welcome back.<br> Hm?

That ought to do it. Thank you for gathering<br> them all in one place like that, Nagiko.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> That let me purify this whole hallway with a single shot, which is much more cost-effective.</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong><br> Master, are we really sure this lady&#39;s a god?</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> Are you freaking kidding me?</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> What the hell are you doing with a bazooka?<br> That&#39;s straight up cheating.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> Eros is supposed to use a bow and arrow, dammit!</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> Love has no defined shape or form...</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> So I see no point in sticking with a bow and arrow when the situation calls for a bazooka.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> But I guess that may be hard to understand for a more...old-fashioned god like yourself.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> (Fury rising)</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> Oh, so you think you&#39;re hot stuff just &#39;cause you beat those Bitter Shadow things?</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> You could only do it &#39;cause you knew the trick.<br> I wouldn&#39;t have lost in a fair fight.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> Oh?

This is why Jason was acting so strangely.</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong><br> Is that...chocolate?</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong><br> Specifically, it&#39;s the elusory chocolate that&#39;s all the rage in Chaldea right now, even though it&#39;s very hard to get hold of.</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong><br> And its name is...</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong></p><h1 id="god-love" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#god-love" aria-hidden="true">#</a> God Love.</h1><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Well, that ain&#39;t fishy at all.</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong><br> Anyway, after a while of hearing about how amazing this chocolate was, I finally managed to get my hands on some.</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong><br> But as it turns out, it also contained trace amounts of magical energy.</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong><br> I tried to ask the woman selling it about that, but she ran off before I had the chance.</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong><br> What did this woman look like?</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong><br> Huh? I don&#39;t know.<br> She was wearing a paper bag over her head.</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong><br> Honestly, I figured it was just more Servantverse nonsense.</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong><br> (We&#39;re all definitely too used to this sort of thing...)</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong><br> Anyway, she might have gotten away, but I still had the chocolate I bought from her...</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong><br> ...so I decided to examine it more thoroughly.</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong><br> In doing so, I found out that it definitely has some kind of effect on whoever eats it...</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong><br> ...but I still didn&#39;t know exactly what that effect is.</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong><br> That was when Jason happened by...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> So you used him as a guinea pig, huh...</p><hr><p><strong>Medea:</strong><br> After that, well, you all know what happened next. Jason turned into a weirdly...nice version of himself.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Hang on.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> You telling us this chocolate has the power to change people&#39;s personalities?</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong><br> So that&#39;s what&#39;s been going on here.</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong><br> That explains why all those other Servants were acting so much friendlier than usual.</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong><br> Well, in Jason&#39;s case...</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong><br> ...there&#39;s a part of me that wouldn&#39;t mind just leaving him like this...</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong><br> But seeing him be THIS nice is actually turning out to be sort of creepy, right?</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> How wonderful.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> Finding forgiveness in your heart even for someone who has hurt you over and over...</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> Now that is true neighborly agape. I love to see it.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> That said, it would certainly have been more fun to watch if she&#39;d been willing to sling a little more mud...</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong><br> What do you think my life is!?<br> Some kind of reality TV show!?</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> Oh gosh. Did you just read my mind!?</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> Hehehe. It&#39;s a little embarrassing to have my private thoughts revealed, but I suppose I shouldn&#39;t be surprised, seeing as you&#39;re a mage from the Age of Gods.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> I must say, true Mystics really are a wonder to behold. You&#39;ll have to teach me your magical telepathy secrets sometime.</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong><br> What are you talking about!? You were blabbing<br> your \u201Cprivate thoughts\u201D for all to hear!</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong><br> I get it. Sometimes, you can&#39;t help but want to point out the sheer craziness in things she says.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Tell me about it. Half the time, I can&#39;t even tell whether she&#39;s joking.</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong><br> I&#39;ll say!</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong><br> I don&#39;t know who the hell you are, but you&#39;ve got a lot of nerve talking to me like you know anything about\u2013</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong><br> Do I know you from somewhere?</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> Hmm, I couldn&#39;t tell you.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> My name is Caren C. Hortensia,<br> but please, call me Caren.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> I&#39;m also serving as a vessel for the Divine Spirit Amor.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> That&#39;s Amoooooor, not amour.</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong><br> Amor...</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong><br> As in Eros!?</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> Oh my, that was frightening. Why are you attacking me?</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> I suppose you have some history with this god of love.</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong><br> You bet I do!</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong><br> Do you have any idea how much you all messed up my life!?</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong><br> I never imagined I&#39;d get a chance to take my revenge on you here...</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong><br> But you better believe I won&#39;t let it pass me by now!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> What did you do to her, Caren?</p><hr><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> Well, um, strictly speaking...</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> It was Eros and Aphrodite who did it, not me.</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong><br> Aphrodite... She&#39;s one of the major Greek gods, right? I remember hearing she had strong ties to Eros as well.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> A long, long, very long time ago, back when the earth was still awash in Mystics...</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> Aphrodite, with Eros&#39;s help,<br> bewitched gods and humans alike.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> Of the many such schemes she came up with, one of them was named something like:</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> \u201CMake Queen Medea Fall Head Over Heels for Jason.\u201D</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> I trust you can see where this is going now?</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> Eros, under orders to help Jason<br> obtain the Golden Fleece...</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> ...nocked an arrow filled with Aphrodite&#39;s blessings and curses on his prized bow...</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> And boom, it just worked.</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong><br> Don&#39;t you talk about the worst time of my life<br> like it&#39;s some kind of damn infomercial!</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Did you just jump INTO her line of fire!?</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> Um... Yes, but, uh, I didn&#39;t have a choice...

So you&#39;re at least aware of what you did,<br> Pseudo-Servant or not.</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong><br> That&#39;s right, Eros!<br> If it wasn&#39;t for that damn arrow of yours...</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong><br> My whole life could have been completely different!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Uh-oh.</p><hr><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Crap! That&#39;s Bitter Shadow magical energy!</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong><br> Oh no. It looks like it&#39;s attracted to...</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong><br> ...Medea&#39;s anger!</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong><br> Huh!?</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> Oh my, how terrible.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> Now the Bitter Shadows have got Medea, too. Oopsies.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You could at least pretend to be worried!</p><hr><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> Well, I guess it just goes to show what happens when you let anger take the wheel.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> All right, everyone, you&#39;re up.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> Now that Medea&#39;s unconscious, you need to stop her before she goes on a wild rampage throughout\u2013</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong><br> Hmph.</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong><br> I&#39;m still perfectly conscious, thank you very much.</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong><br> I&#39;m a witch from the Age of Gods, remember!?</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong><br> This is nowhere near too much magical energy for me to control.</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong><br> In fact, this is perfect. I&#39;m going to use all this new power now at my command...</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong><br> ...to hit you with a spell powerful enough to blow all of Chaldea away!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Yeah, um, could you maybe NOT do that, please!?</p><hr><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Hey. Whose side should we take here?</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong><br> Don&#39;t ask me.</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong><br> Besides, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s our place to say anything, since it&#39;s not really any of our business.</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong><br> And on that note, I just remembered some urgent business of my own, so if you&#39;ll excuse me...</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Oh no, you don&#39;t!

I&#39;m surprised.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> I didn&#39;t think you would be satisfied until you tore five, maybe six limbs off me.</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong><br> I&#39;m pretty sure you only have four!</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Just when I thought she went down like a punk, she springs back like nothing happened...</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Seriously, what is her deal?</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong><br> Hmph.</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong><br> I could tear every one of you limb from limb and I doubt that goddess would so much as bat an eye.</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong><br> I don&#39;t know what it is you&#39;re up to here...</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong><br> But I&#39;m not about to waste any more of my time on a doll.</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong><br> So let&#39;s just say this trip down memory lane is over now, shall we?</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Medea...</p><hr><p><strong>Medea:</strong><br> Don&#39;t look at me like that, Master.</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong><br> As I just said, I won&#39;t get in your way any longer, but I&#39;m not going to help you, either.</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong><br> You&#39;re going to have to deal with this mess yourselves.</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong><br> Here&#39;s the chocolate I told you about.</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong><br> I suggest you give it to Da Vinci so she can take a closer look at it.</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong><br> Don&#39;t worry about Jason lying on the floor there.<br> I&#39;ll take care of him.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Thanks, Mentor.</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong><br> That reminds me... Don&#39;t you think you have a few too many mentors these days?</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong><br> It wouldn&#39;t kill you to show me just a little more in the way of deference, you know.</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong><br> Huh? You&#39;re well aware?<br> Well, good. I hope so.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Thanks for the Valentine&#39;s Day chocolate, Medea.</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong><br> Ugh... Did you really have to say that now?</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong><br> Just sit tight, okay? I&#39;ll have a proper Valentine&#39;s Day gift for you soon enough.</p><hr><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Well, I never did figure out what that was all about...but at least we&#39;ve got some of that elusory chocolate now.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Think this stuff&#39;s got some connection<br> to the Bitter Shadows?</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong><br> I don&#39;t know, but it&#39;s definitely worth looking into either way.</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong><br> Shall we go pay Da Vinci a visit, Master?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Sounds like a plan.</p><hr><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> Hmm...</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> I wonder what&#39;s going to happen now...</p><h2 id="section-6-finding-hortensia" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-6-finding-hortensia" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 6: Finding Hortensia</h2><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> All right, I&#39;ve got it mostly figured out now!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Wow, that was fast!</p><hr><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> That chocolate Medea gave you was the key to cracking this whole case.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> So, here&#39;s the deal.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> This chocolate contains a spell that makes any Servant who eats one...</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong><br> Yes?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> ...feel really, really happy.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> What are you? Drunk? And yes, I mean you, not the Servants who ate the chocolate.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Hahaha. I can see why you&#39;d think that, but no, I&#39;m not. Just hear me out.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> You know how eating something yummy can make you feel really good?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> It&#39;s basically a mild state of euphoria, right?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Well, when a Servant eats this chocolate, that state is heightened considerably.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> I&#39;d guess they probably become very easygoing and content.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> That by itself isn&#39;t a problem, of course. I mean, you like having a drink after a day&#39;s work too, right?</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Well, yeah. I definitely enjoy fighting, but sometimes, the thing I look forward to the most is the victory drink after.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Exactly. No matter what our culture or environment, we all feel revitalized by a good meal.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Anyway, this chocolate is kind of turns that concept up to eleven...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> But in addition to its euphoric effect, we also know now that it causes a Servant&#39;s Spirit Core to give off an unusual kind of magical energy.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Magical energy... So then, is that\u2013</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Yup. It matches the data from our analysis perfectly.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> That very magical energy the chocolate induces is what&#39;s responsible for these Bitter Shadows spawning in Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong><br> I see. Caren said that something was drawing the Bitter Shadows here...</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong><br> But in fact...</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong><br> They spawned from Servants who ate this God Love chocolate without the Servants realizing.</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong><br> Do I have that right?</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> You&#39;ve gotta be kidding me. So you&#39;re telling me the chocolate didn&#39;t so much have something to do with all this...</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> ...as it was the cause of the whole thing!?</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong><br> Looks that way. Anyway, now that we know, we should probably try to stop anyone else from eating it.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> All right, I&#39;ve got it mostly figured out now!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Wow, that was fast!</p><hr><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> That chocolate Medea gave you was the key to cracking this whole case.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> So, here&#39;s the deal.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> This chocolate contains a spell that makes any Servant who eats one...</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong><br> Yes?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> ...feel really, really happy.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> What are you?

Anyway, now that we know, we should probably try to stop anyone else from eating it.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Yup, I agree.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Which means we need to find this mysterious paper bag woman selling it as soon as possible.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Okay, but where do we look for her?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> We should know that soon, too.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> We&#39;ve been detecting intermittent power losses in Chaldea over the last few days...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...but they were so minor that we couldn&#39;t tell where they were occurring.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> But today, all of a sudden, we&#39;re seeing a lot more power being consumed.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> The power here is also what&#39;s supplying us with magical energy, right?</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> And now you&#39;re saying it&#39;s being used for something else?</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong><br> If the electricity here is tied to magical energy, that pretty much clinches it.</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong><br> Someone must be using it to make that chocolate.</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong><br> The only question is,<br> where is this stolen power being sent?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> We should hopefully know soon. I&#39;m having Mash run a trace on it even as we speak.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> How&#39;s it going, Mash? Find anything yet?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes. I&#39;ve been checking each of the energy supply lines one by one, and I found where power&#39;s being siphoned off.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It&#39;s the unoccupied staff room at the end of the western corridor in section B.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It didn&#39;t look like there was anything out of the ordinary there on the security camera...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...but when I looked at it with Sheba, it said the room&#39;s interior was impossible to measure.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> ...I see. Then like Kid Gil said,<br> that pretty much clinches it.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> All right! Nice work, missy!<br> All we gotta do now is sneak in there\u2013</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong><br> Capture this paper bag woman, and shut down her illicit chocolate operation.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...</p><hr><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Hey, uh, by the way.</p><hr><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Hm?

Now do you understand?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> The only problem with that is, as long as people remain people, they&#39;ll never be rid of negative emotions completely.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Which means that the magical energy they&#39;re leaking will eventually spread through all of Chaldea...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> ...until the whole place is basically overrun with Bitter Shadows.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> I swear, that God Love stuff should&#39;ve never been brought to market!</p><p><strong>Eros:</strong><br> But we make it with painstaking care.</p><p><strong>Amor:</strong><br> It shouldn&#39;t have any adverse effects on anyone&#39;s health.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> And our aftercare regimen is flawless.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> God Love is perfectly safe, and starting today, we&#39;ll be distributing it for free!</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Are you freaking kidding me!?</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> After all the work you made us do, you&#39;re just gonna give that crap out for free!?</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> Yes. And it&#39;s all thanks to you.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> With all of you gathering bazooka round materials, and me using them to destroy the Bitter Shadows...</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> We&#39;ve been able to keep Valentine&#39;s Day sweet and peaceful for everyone.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> I call that a win-win, don&#39;t you?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I, uh, I see...?</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong><br> Don&#39;t let her fool you, Mash.</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong><br> The only reason the Bitter Shadows showed up and ruined Valentine&#39;s Day in the first place...</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong><br> ...is because of this harebrained scheme of hers.</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong><br> Heck, I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if she&#39;d known about the Bitter Shadows thing from the start.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> Oh my... Are you saying I knowingly sold defective product to my customers!?</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> Well, okay, I DID, but still.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> Originally, I thought I could handle any incidental messes on my own...</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> But all their negative thoughts and feelings turned out to be much stronger than I expected.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> All I can say is, it seems Chaldea&#39;s working environment leaves a lot to be desired.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You&#39;re not wrong.</p><p><strong>Mash &amp; Da Vinci:</strong><br> Senpai!?<br> Fujimaru!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Not much room to talk, given how you treat your employees.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> Oh, are you sure you want to say that, when you still haven&#39;t yet tasted my whip for yourself?</p><hr><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> At any rate... (Sigh) I should have known you&#39;d do something like this, Gilgamesh.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> It&#39;s clear everyone here distrusts me now, and it&#39;s all thanks to you.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> Why, before you said that, C\xFA Chulainn there trusted me so much he would have given me the shirt off his back.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> The hell you say!</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> I haven&#39;t trusted you for one second of this mess which, lest we forget, YOU MADE!</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong><br> It&#39;s true. And I said you were definitely up to something the first time you showed up, too.</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong><br> Which reminds me, Amor: What is it you&#39;re really up to here, anyway?</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> Oh my, how terrible. I had no idea that&#39;s how you&#39;ve seen me all this time.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> And after I&#39;ve been showering you with all this love, too.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Hmph. You mean your agape? Nope, not buying that selfless love routine.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Anything that spreads itself thin enough to reach anyone and everyone may as well not even exist at all.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> ...That was a pretty cutting comeback for a mongrel.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> Still, mutual understanding was never one of my goals, so you&#39;re welcome to argue till you&#39;re blue in the face.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> The Lord&#39;s love is given freely,<br> while asking nothing in return.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> It is the ultimate gospel that illuminates the world, blankets the whole of the earth, and brings salvation to all people.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> So by mass-producing delicious and nutritious God Love...</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> I&#39;ll use love to bring salvation to everyone at Chaldea, and eventually, all of humanity.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> That is my plan.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> I&#39;m Amor, god of love. I have a purpose to fulfill.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> So if you mean to interfere with that...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> We definitely do.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> You better believe it.</p><hr><p><strong>Amor:</strong><br> Ahh, how deplorable...</p><p><strong>Eros:</strong><br> Ahh, how delectable... Whoops. I mean, deplorable...</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> Well said. Oh, but not you, Eros. I&#39;ll have to give you another hundred lashes later.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> But yes, this truly is a pity. What a shame that we were evidently destined to fight after all...</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Oh, what a crock! You don&#39;t look sad about this at all! You look positively eager!</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> But, nonetheless, if this is the trial the Lord has set before me, then the struggle is the glory.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> C\xFA Chulainn, Gilgamesh. Mash\xE9rie. Master of Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> Defeating you will help me grow even more as a Divinity, so that&#39;s just what I&#39;m going to do.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> After that, it won&#39;t be long before you see me dominate the world with love!</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong><br> Now she&#39;s even starting to sound like a final boss!</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong><br> Come on, Fujimaru! Let&#39;s finish her off!</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> You know... I can&#39;t remember anything about it, but I&#39;m sure I know her from somewhere.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> And what&#39;s more, I can tell she was exactly like this back then, too.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> So maybe it really is fate that<br> I get to help stop you here.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> By the time we&#39;re done with you, you&#39;re gonna wish you&#39;d never even heard the word \u201Cplan\u201D!!!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Oh no. C\xFA Chulainn is getting a lot more worked up than usual!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> All right, guys, this is it!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> I&#39;m counting on you to defeat Caren and stop her from making or distributing any more God Love!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> We&#39;ll never be able to get anything else done around here if she succeeds!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Got it!</p><hr><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> Very well then. If that&#39;s how you want to play this...</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> ...my goddess sisters and I will just have to show you our true power.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> Goddesses!</p><p><strong>All Three:</strong></p><h1 id="let-s-go" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#let-s-go" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Let&#39;s go!</h1><p><strong>==ARROW==</strong></p><p><strong>Eros:</strong><br> Eeek.</p><p><strong>Amor:</strong><br> Eeek.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> Eeek.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> We...we won!?</p><hr><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> HA! Serves you right for all that stuff I don&#39;t remember!</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong><br> You know, I think I feel just a tiny bit better now!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> U-um, Caren?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Now would you be willing to shut down your factory and call off your plan?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> If possible, we&#39;d also like you to tell us how to counteract the God Love&#39;s effects...</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> Hehe...</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> You must have a very low opinion of me indeed if you think you&#39;ve won already.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Seeing as you apparently can&#39;t even stand upto say that, yeah, I&#39;m sticking with \u201Cwe won.\u201D</p><hr><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Oh come on, give it a rest already. You lost, all right? What more do you think you can do now?</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Besides, it&#39;s not like you killed anyone. You can still get off easy if you just agree to behave yourself.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> No, C\xFA Chulainn.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> You should never stop, not until you reach your goal and are satisfied.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> You&#39;re the one who told me that.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Really? I actually said something that corny?</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> No. Not really.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> What the hell is your problem!?!?</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> Hehe, you&#39;re wide-open.<br> Now&#39;s our chance!</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> Eros and Amor, release your pseudo-Spirit Origins!

Well, everyone?<br> What do you think of my true form?</p><p><strong>God Caren:</strong><br> Or is it so divinely dazzling you<br> can&#39;t even bear to look at it?</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong><br> It certainly does an excellent job showing your true devilish nature.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> So even with the power of the god of love, you still look like a goddamn devil, huh. What the hell did your parents do to you when you were growing up?</p><p><strong>God Caren:</strong><br> ...I suppose old-fashioned Heroic Spirits like yourselves just can&#39;t see true divinity, even when it&#39;s right in front of their faces.</p><p><strong>God Caren:</strong><br> Oh well, your opinions were never important to me anyway. It&#39;s what people from the same day and age as myself think that truly matters.</p><p><strong>God Caren:</strong><br> So, Mash and Fujimaru,<br> what do YOU think of this Spirit Origin?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Well, it&#39;s definitely divine in one sense.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> T-true... You&#39;re certainly, um, as boldly dressed as some Divine Spirits...</p><p><strong>God Caren:</strong><br> Right? Right? I knew you two would get it.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> What&#39;s with the horns?</p><p><strong>God Caren:</strong><br> ...Have you had your eyes checked recently?

Anyway, I&#39;m so sorry for disappointing you before.</p><p><strong>God Caren:</strong><br> But rest assured...I&#39;m much more powerful now.<br> So, shall we pick up where we left off?</p><p><strong>God Caren:</strong><br> Now that you&#39;re done warming up with the tutorial, are you brave enough to accept a truly challenging quest?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Uh-oh. This doesn&#39;t look good... Caren is projecting the aura of one of those broken characters who the rules don&#39;t apply to!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It&#39;s about three times more powerful than any of the three Carens we just fought!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> What should we do, Master!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I mean, it makes sense, since all three are combined into one now.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> We can&#39;t afford to run away now!</p><hr><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> True. Believe me, I wish I could just walk away and be done with this whole mess...</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> But that wouldn&#39;t be fair to the people who&#39;ve been looking forward to a normal Valentine&#39;s Day!</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> So no more going around peddling your God Love garbage!</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong><br> Agreed. Regardless of how it began, these days, Valentine&#39;s Day is all about people, and how they feel about each other.</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong><br> So the fact that you&#39;ve been going around just giving your love away for free, well...it&#39;s not a good look.</p><p><strong>God Caren:</strong><br> ...Ouch. Being rejected en masse<br> is tougher than I thought...</p><p><strong>God Caren:</strong><br> But luckily, I like that sort of thing too! There&#39;s nothing like a little playing hard to get to make the love burn even hotter!</p><p><strong>God Caren:</strong><br> ...In fact...</p><p><strong>God Caren:</strong><br> When I think about how I&#39;ll get to use the power of love to stomp all over your stupid faces shining with bravery and camaraderie, it makes me...</p><p><strong>God Caren:</strong><br> Makes me...</p><p><strong>God Caren:</strong><br> Ahem! Let&#39;s just say it makes my being summoned completely worthwhile! Ahh, what could be better than this!?</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> (Crap. I&#39;ve seen this kind of holier-than-thou type before, and you don&#39;t want them running around doing whatever the hell they want.)</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> All right, Master, let&#39;s do this thing!</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> However we ended up here, we now know for damn sure that all of Chaldea&#39;s at stake in this fight!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Sure looks that way!</p><hr><p><strong>==ARROW==</strong></p><p><strong>God Caren:</strong><br> Eeeeeek!!!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Huh? That was...surprisingly easy?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I mean, she was definitely tough, but...weirdly not THAT tough?</p><hr><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Yeah, about that... I didn&#39;t say anything sooner<br> &#39;cause I didn&#39;t want to rain on your parade, but...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Even with all that extra magical energy, Amor&#39;s Spirit Origin is still just human-sized, so...</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong><br> That limited her output, huh? Guess it doesn&#39;t matter how much magical energy you have if it&#39;s bottlenecked.</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong><br> Honestly, the fact that there was only one of her this time made the fight even easier in some ways.</p><p><strong>Eros:</strong><br> Khh.</p><p><strong>Eros:</strong><br> I can&#39;t believe we lost on Valentine&#39;s Day of all days. It should&#39;ve been the perfect venue for us...</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> No, I see now that we should have expected this.<br> While we did have more than enough power...</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> That form was essentially the equivalent of a single bite-sized piece of courtesy chocolate.</p><p><strong>Eros:</strong><br> Huh!? What do you mean by that, Lady Caren?</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> I mean that the power of love reserved for a commercialized event like Valentine&#39;s Day can only go so far.</p><p><strong>Amor:</strong><br> True. I wasn&#39;t quite able to get past that hump myself. Eros was the only one of us taking it seriously.</p><p><strong>Eros:</strong><br> Heeey.</p><p><strong>Eros:</strong><br> Besides, weren&#39;t you just saying something about the power of Valentine&#39;s Day not too long ag\u2013</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> (Slap)</p><p><strong>Eros:</strong><br> Eeek.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> In the end, lovers are still just strangers. We forge<br> that relationship by giving in to our base urges.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> Lovers will never last forever.<br> All relationships eventually end.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> That&#39;s why love tainted with lust<br> is a far cry from true love.</p><p><strong>Eros:</strong><br> Eeek!</p><p><strong>Eros:</strong><br> Please forgive me, Lady Caren!<br> I really don&#39;t think I can take anymore!</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong><br> Um, do you mind if I say something?</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> Yes? What is it, Gilgamesh?</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong><br> Well, I couldn&#39;t help but notice...</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong><br> ...that you tend to treat Kama and Eros pretty harshly.</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong><br> It actually reminds me of the God Love.</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong><br> You&#39;ve been using it to try and suppress lust,<br> along with other negative emotions.</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong><br> You clearly consider sexual desire to be, well, vulgar...</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong><br> So I can&#39;t help but wonder why Eros, the god of sexual desire, would want you as a vessel.</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong><br> Really, there&#39;s something...contradictory about your whole existence.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Hey, yeah... There is, isn&#39;t there?</p><hr><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Not necessarily. From what I know about Amor, or Eros, or whatever you call him...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> He may well have had a reason for choosing his polar opposite for an avatar.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Da Vinci?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Not necessarily. From what I know about Amor, or Eros, or whatever you call him...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> He may well have had a reason for choosing his polar opposite for an avatar.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Da Vinci?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> It&#39;s got something to do with one<br> of Eros&#39;s more well-known stories.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> In it, Eros has been spending his life wandering around firing his arrows of love at whoever catches his fancy, just like his mother ordered him to do.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> But then, one day, he meets a human girl...<br> and falls in love with her.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> The rest of their story plays out about how you expect.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Extenuating circumstances, overcoming adversity, happily ever after... You get the gist.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Anyway, the girl&#39;s name was Psyche, something close to \u201Cheart\u201D in Greek.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> And of course, I don&#39;t have to tell<br> you that Eros means &quot;love.&quot;</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> So when you think about what this story of a union between heart and love is saying...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> ...you realize it has some interesting implications.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> So, if Eros is \u201Clove\u201D...<br> and Psyche is \u201Cheart\u201D...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That would imply that love and the heart are separate things. Which would mean... Oh.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> So, you&#39;re saying Eros doesn&#39;t possess a heart?</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong><br> ...Aha. Now I get it. Since he doesn&#39;t possess a heart...</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong><br> I&#39;m guessing he&#39;s willing to carry out any order given to him, no matter how cruel...</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong><br> ...and to accept any punishment,<br> no matter how cruel? Is that it?</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> No. I treat Eros that way because he likes it.</p><p><strong>Eros:</strong><br> No I don&#39;t. That&#39;s your thing, not mine.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> Shut up. I was just getting to the good part.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> Ahem. Here&#39;s the deal. Eros, or Amor, or whatever you call him, is a tragic god.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> He had the power to control love,<br> but no heart to understand it.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> I knew it!</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> One day, he came to me in a dream...</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> ...and asked me what true love is.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> But that is very difficult to put into words...</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> So instead, I decided to show him a sample case.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> A sample case?</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> The hell kind of sample case did<br> you show to a freaking god?</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> I told you, it&#39;s simple.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> I showed him the form love should take.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...And what was that?</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> A world without conflict. A world where people cherish their neighbors, and no classes divide society.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> I showed him an ideal world...</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> ...where I, as its benevolent dictator, control all things.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> The hell!? That&#39;s just another dystopia!</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> So what? What&#39;s wrong with a benevolent dictatorship?</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> My duty is to use this power to guide the world where it&#39;s meant to go...</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> To make the ideal world I showed him a reality.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> Yes, that&#39;s right. Since people alone are incapable of being truly happy...</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> I must use the Lord&#39;s love to bestow happiness upon everyone equally!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That&#39;s...a Holy Grail!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> What, was it formed by Valentine&#39;s Day power or something!? Then again, with all these Heroic Spirits around, I guess that&#39;s totally plausible!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Anyway, if there&#39;s a Holy Grail involved, that&#39;d explain how she showed up without anyone summoning her!</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> That&#39;s right. The Holy Grail was first drawn here by all those couples and their lecherous affections.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> It then summoned the god of love, who in turn sought someone with a heart: me.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> That is the chain of fate that led us here.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> And now, I&#39;m sure that what I am about to do...</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> ...is only a fulfillment of God&#39;s will.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That chocolate... Is that God Love!?</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> God Love amplifies the love within anyone who eats it, and represses their negative emotions.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> So I wonder.

I completely forgot about that...</p><hr><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong><br> That rare Heracles memorabilia collection?</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> You still have that stuff put away? No wonder it still stinks of testosterone in here.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Hehe. Still, I&#39;m sure Jason will be thrilled when we return his collection.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> I&#39;m glad you think so, because I was about to ask you to do just that.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Don&#39;t worry about the rest of the aftermath. I&#39;ll take care of that. Great work, guys.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Oh, and Mash?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Y-yes!?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Just so you know, I don&#39;t have any assignments for you at the moment...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> So now&#39;s your chance to make the most of Valentine&#39;s Day.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> O-okay! Thank you, Da Vinci!</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Oh, hey, uh...</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> I just remembered I have to do...something. Gotta run.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Come on, kid, you too.</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong><br> Huh? I don&#39;t want to go.</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong><br> I&#39;m going to stay right here so I can see how this all plays out.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Um, how what plays out...?</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Just come on already! You and I&#39;re going to go make the arounds in Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong><br> What!? I never signed up for that!</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Well, that sounds perfect.</p><p><strong>Both:</strong><br> ...What did you say?</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> I didn&#39;t had the time for a nice, relaxed<br> exploration of Chaldea before.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> Would you mind if I joined you on your rounds?</p><p><strong>Both:</strong><br> Gaaaaaah!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> C-Caren? What are you doing here?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Yeah, what about your dramatic exit?</p><hr><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> Yes, well, that&#39;s what I was planning to do...</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> But then I figured I may as well recombine with Eros and Amor. And when I did...</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> ...I ended up with just enough magical energy left over to rematerialize.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> So that&#39;s what I did. It was pretty easy, too.<br> It seems interpersonal bonds truly are powerful.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> Still, I didn&#39;t have anywhere else to go, and it looked too cold to camp out...</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> So since we already formed a temporary contract once, I thought I&#39;d come back so you could hire me on full-time\u2661</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong><br> No! No chance!</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> For once, I agree with you!<br> Don&#39;t do it, Master!</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Keep her around, and there&#39;s no telling when she might try and kill you in your slee\u2013</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> (Slaps)</p><p><strong>Both:</strong><br> Yeowww!</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> If you have enough energy to protest, then you must also have enough to show me around, no?</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> So come on then. I want you to tell me all there is to know about Chaldea&#39;s various facilities.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> I intend to stay here for quite a long time, you know.</p><p><strong>Both:</strong><br> Nooo freaking waaay!!!</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> As for you, Master, I look forward<br> to working with you again.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> Now please, don&#39;t mind us. Back to what you were doing. Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ll take care of the rest.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> U-um... Caren?</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Aha! There you are, C\xFA!</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> ...Huh?</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Who&#39;s that woman with you,<br> and why do you two look so chummy!?</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Stay right where you are! You&#39;re not going anywhere until you&#39;ve told me everything I want to know!</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> Hmm. That must be the famous Queen<br> Medb I&#39;ve heard so much about.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> I see. So you&#39;re making passes at people even after being summoned as a Servant.</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> It seems you&#39;re more of a stallion than a ladies&#39; man, C\xFA Chulainn. Or should I say, you dog.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Now you&#39;re outright slandering me!?</p><p><strong>Caren:</strong><br> I&#39;m just stating an objective fact. Now, go on.<br> Start running before she catches you.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Dammiiiiiit!!!</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong><br> Why am I still mixed up in this!?</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Get back heeere!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> S-so, um...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It&#39;s certainly been an eventful few days,<br> hasn&#39;t it, Senpai?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I know you&#39;ve been through a lot this year thanks to chocolate...again...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> B-but, um, they do say that sweets are the best remedy for exhaustion, so...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Um... Here.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I hope you like it!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Thanks, Mash.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> N-not at all! It doesn&#39;t even come close to expressing how grateful I am to you for everything you do for me all year, so if anything, I should be the one thanking you!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> In that case...</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Huh?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Here. This is for you.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Does this mean...you had a gift<br> prepared for me all this time, too?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Well, yeah.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I mean, it is Valentine&#39;s Day, so.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Hehe.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Thank you, Senpai. This was a wonderful surprise.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Now that all&#39;s said and done, I think this year&#39;s Valentine&#39;s Day turned out wonderfully as well!</p><p></p>', 2390);
