I knew it.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> We&#39;ve seen more and more Servants disappearing from Chaldea over the past few days.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I can at least tell from our tracking systems that they haven&#39;t disappeared completely, but still...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I think we need to ask Da Vinci about this.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I think so too.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I know she&#39;s been busy with some sort of project lately, but she definitely needs to hear about this.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Let&#39;s go see her right now.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fo fou!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Oh, hey you two. Excellent timing;<br> you are just the ones I needed to talk to.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Where&#39;d all the Servants go?</p><p><strong>D：???:</strong><br> What&#39;s that supposed to mean?<br> What am I, chopped liver?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> We&#39;ve got a situation on our hands.</p><p><strong>D：???:</strong><br> Not to worry, Master.<br> I&#39;ll keep you safe, no matter what.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> So you two are still here.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> I&#39;ve just been hanging around in spirit form, collecting books and–I mean, just &#39;cause I felt like it.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> I was just walking around the hallways seeing if anyone had dropped any more when I heard you talking and came to see what was up.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> And I was busy getting things ready for Master.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> For me? Ready for what?</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Oh? Did Lady Da Vinci not tell you?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Not yet. I was just getting to that.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> You see, it&#39;s about time we started Chaldea&#39;s summer vacation.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Well, okay, we kind of already have.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Oh, yeah. I guess it is that time of year again, isn&#39;t it.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> No wonder Mr. Meunière looked so happy on his way to the rec room.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> He said he was going to do nothing but watch movies for the next three days or until his brain started to rot, whichever came first.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> The investigators are still dragging their feet, so I&#39;d say that with the way things are going, we&#39;ll be dealing with them for the rest of the year.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> So let&#39;s not worry so much about that and just enjoy our summer!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Does that go for all the Servants, too?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Pretty much. They said if the staff was getting a summer vacation, the Heroic Spirits deserved one too.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> With normal summoning methods, it&#39;d be impossible for a Servant to wander off without their Master.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> But using Chaldea&#39;s summoning method, each Servant can carry around the magical energy they need to materialize, kind of like a battery pack.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> I don&#39;t know who Blackbeard learned that from, but he would not leave me alone once he did. By the time I gave in, he was groveling pretty shamelessly, teary-eyed and runny-nosed.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> The really weird part is that all the other Servants felt the same and demanded their own summer vacation, complete with bonus.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> So that&#39;s why there are so few Servants left here now. All the rest are out living it up.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> But hey, Holmes and I are still here, and we can always bring the rest back by force if we have to.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> ...Anyway, this is the part where I&#39;m kinda supposed to give you guys your own summer break...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I&#39;m just gonna lie in bed all day!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> (Cough) Loser. (Cough)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I feel a “but” coming.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> And I&#39;m sorry to say you&#39;re right.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Unfortunately, summer break or no,<br> I can&#39;t give you authorization to leave Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> I was planning to let you two hang out and relax...but things have changed.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Hm?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> We haven&#39;t detected any Singularities, not even a minute one, but we did pick something else up: a Foreigner.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> A Foreigner...!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> You already knew about them, Senpai? I&#39;m impressed.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The Foreigner class is listed as a type of,<br> well, foreign being from outside this world...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> They&#39;re not technically Heroic Spirits, but they&#39;re so similar that we&#39;re classifying them that way.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> A Foreigner...?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The special class of beings that we recently officially recognized as possessing Spirit Origins, Senpai.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I suggest thinking about them as, well,<br> foreign beings from outside this world.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That said...I thought the conditions for the creation of a Foreigner were supposed to be complex, with very low odds of one actually manifesting...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Where is this Foreigner signal coming from? If we&#39;re talking about an alien, they seem to favor ending up in the U.S., right?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Hmm. I suppose that&#39;s technically where it is. Hold on to your hats, &#39;cause the signal is originating from...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> ...Hawaii.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Where&#39;s my reaction?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Hawaii...!?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Oh there it is.<br> That&#39;s right. The Hawaiian Islands.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> One of the most famous tourist destinations in the entire world.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Is that true?<br> You&#39;re sure there&#39;s a Foreigner in Hawaii?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Sheba&#39;s Lens doesn&#39;t lie.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Sorry to spring this on you so suddenly, but I&#39;d like you all to head to Hawaii and take care of this.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I&#39;mma go get ready to Rayshift right now!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Whoa there. I appreciate your enthusiasm,<br> but you&#39;re getting ahead of yourself.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> But...my summer break...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> I&#39;ll make it up to you!<br> How&#39;s an extra bonus sound?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Da Vinci, wait a moment...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> You said Sheba only picked up a Foreigner,<br> not a Singularity, right?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That would mean we can&#39;t Rayshift there, since doing so would violate regulations. So then, how are we supposed to get to Hawaii...?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Simple. The old-fashioned way. Directly.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Directly...?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Directly!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> We may not know who this Foreigner is, but we&#39;ve covered all our bases pretty thoroughly!</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Hey, you guys done in here?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Oh, Robin. I didn&#39;t know you were here, too.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Sure am. Lucky me. Figures me deciding not to visit the old homestead would backfire.</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Shuten! I don&#39;t see Shuten anywhere!<br> Where is Shuten, Master!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Your guess is as good as mine.</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Ugh, you&#39;re useless! Fine then,<br> I&#39;ll just go trash the place until I feel better!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Probably off on break with the others.</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Don&#39;t be ridiculous! Shuten would never go on break without telling me! Grrr, something isn&#39;t right here...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> ...(Biting her tongue)</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Well, knowing Shuten-Douji, maybe she just heard about this Foreigner thing before we did and she&#39;s already headed to Hawaii to fight them.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> She does like to torment newcomers, you know. I don&#39;t think she&#39;d just let someone waltz in here without making them really work for it.</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Hmm, true, Shuten is merciless with her hazing, and she&#39;s never cared much about people&#39;s boundaries.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> You can say that again. So on that note, Ibaraki-Douji, I&#39;d love for you to come along to Hawaii.</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> If you insist, I guess.<br> Hey, what&#39;s the weather like in Hawaii? Hot? Cold?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> How can you not know that!? Hawaii is in the tropics! It&#39;s blazing hot there!</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong></p><p>The tropics!</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Then, that means...</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> ...I can wear one of those swimsuit thingies Scáthach and Tamamo were talking about!</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Okay! I&#39;m gonna go get ready to leave right now!</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> ...Don&#39;t we need to tamper with our Spirit Origins to properly change into swimsuits?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Maybe she could just make do with her Morph skill?</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Hmm, good point. I suppose an oni would be able to do that... Must be handy at times like this.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Maybe she already asked Scáthach for help?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I could see that.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> So, Da Vinci.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Just to be clear, we&#39;re only talking Fujimaru,<br> Mash, and the rest of us here right now, right?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Yup. You guys should be able to take care of it. Now, there&#39;s just the little matter of transportation...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I assume we&#39;ll be traveling by plane?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Well, we can&#39;t exactly have you all taking off from here.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Especially not with Fujimaru around.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Me?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> I know it&#39;s easy to forget, but remember, Chaldea&#39;s technically a top secret organization. Letting you just walk out of here would cause all sorts of problems.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> We can pass all the Servants off as familiars to Chaldea&#39;s staff...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> ...but if we tried to use Chaldea&#39;s own transport, we&#39;d never hear the end of it from the Mage&#39;s Association.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> So I talked it over with Holmes,<br> and we came up with a solution.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Ushiwakamaru!</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> It shall be done.<br> Master, please close your eyes.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Huh?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Wh-what&#39;s going on!?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> The first step of our secret plan: you keep this blindfold on until you get to Hawaii!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> The second step of our secret plan:<br> since we can&#39;t use Chaldea&#39;s own transport...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> ...we&#39;ll just have to fly commercially!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> F-fly commercially!?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Yup. All the Servants will use their spirit forms, and–</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> No.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> ...I&#39;m sorry?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> No, I&#39;m not using my spirit form.<br> We&#39;re taking an airplane, right?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Then we&#39;re riding as passengers. All of us.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> ...Oookay. Didn&#39;t see that one coming.<br> I need you to think this through.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> For example, that outfit of yours? You don&#39;t have a chance in hell of getting through airport security.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> So we&#39;ll figure something out!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> It&#39;s a freaking jumbo jet made with all that fancy modern technology crap, right?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> And you think I&#39;m gonna miss out on that by coming in spirit form? Are you an idiot?</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Miss out!? I&#39;m not missing out on ANYTHING fun!!!</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> (Uh-oh... I can see where this is going. I&#39;m starting to feel like a teacher trying to wrangle kids on a field trip.)</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> I will go along with whatever Master Fujimaru wishes.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> ...Although, if I am being honest...I too would be curious to experience an airplane for myself...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Hmm... I suppose we could use a charm spell to cover up their outfits... That way, if they temporarily put their weapons into spirit form...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I guess there&#39;s only so much even a genius can do sometimes, huh?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Well, frankly...yes!<br> But I&#39;ll figure something out!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> A genius like you can do it!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Hahahaha, you know just what to say to me now, don&#39;t you!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> All right then, let&#39;s make some wishes come true!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Heh. Now that&#39;s more like it!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> You&#39;re a lot less of a pain than I expected, artist woman.</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> The tropics, huh...</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> That&#39;s where they have...er, cocoyas?<br> And other delicious fruits, right?</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Mash! Green guy! Look them up for me, and I&#39;ll go pick them all the moment we land! Hahaha!</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Okay, usually, I&#39;d be happy to oblige,<br> but you really oughta do that yourself.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> That&#39;s where the fun of a trip is. That, and the anticipation. You&#39;ve never been on one before, right?</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Then you should bring along a guidebook and read that on the plane. You&#39;re a lot smarter than you look, so put that brain of yours to work for you.</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> I see. Normally if someone dared to tell me what to do, they would get my Great Grudge of Rashomon to the face, but you&#39;re making sense, green guy.</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Guidebook, guidebook...<br> Where&#39;s the guidebook?</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> How diligent of you, especially for an oni.<br> For my part, I&#39;ve already read and memorized it.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Now that I know all of Hawaii&#39;s best spots, it is just a matter of how much time we can spend there.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> So the sooner we can wring this Foreigner&#39;s neck,<br> the more leisure time we will have.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> What do you think, Master? If you like, I could even leap over eight planes just like I did the ships at Dan-no–</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Ahem! I trust this goes without saying, but just in case, once you&#39;re on the plane, there&#39;s to be NO use of weapons, and NO trouble whatsoever!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> If there is, I&#39;ll immediately hypnotize everyone on the plane, force you into your spirit forms, and make it impossible to turn back until you reach Hawaii.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Is that clear?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> I said, is that clear!?</p><p><strong>All:</strong><br> Crystal!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Phew. You Servants are nothing if not a handful!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I know how you feel...all too well...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> But, I wouldn&#39;t have it any other way.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> The important thing is that you&#39;re all raring to go. And lucky for us, there&#39;s even a Chaldea branch in Hawaii!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Once you&#39;ve defeated the Foreigner, you&#39;ll be free to make the most of your paid vacation!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I&#39;ll do my best!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Wooo! Aloha, baby!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> We&#39;ve Rayshifted to all sorts of places and time periods, but the tropics...Hawaii...that&#39;s new!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I hear many of the locals have a strong connection to other languages like Japanese too.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> They also have lots of great restaurants with delicious food, and–</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Oops. Sorry, I almost forgot about the Foreigner we&#39;re supposed to investigate.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> We&#39;ll need to make sure we stay focused on the task at hand even if no one else does, Master!</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Master, which swimsuit do you prefer!?</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> You&#39;ll also need a snorkel if you&#39;re to go swimming in the sea.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Oh, and clothes for at least a few days...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...S-stay focused, Master!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> All right, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> I&#39;m going to cast a little spell on your blindfold to make sure you keep it on until you get there.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Don&#39;t worry, Mash will make sure you arrive safely.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Right. Here, Senpai, hold my hand.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Okay, off you go!<br> Don&#39;t forget to send me a postcard!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Thanks for hanging in there, Senpai.<br> Now it&#39;s just one nonstop flight to Hawaii.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I&#39;m sorry I got us stuck in economy seating by losing at rock paper scissors...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...but I&#39;m really, really excited about getting to talk to you on the airplane!</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> These portions are too small! I require more! MORE!</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> &#39;Scuse me, miss, could we get another one of those coconut ice cream bars? Awesome, thanks.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Here, and that&#39;s the last one you get. &#39;Member, if you stuff your face too much, it&#39;ll end up freezing and you&#39;ll be stuck looking like a chipmunk.</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> A chipmunk! Well...they&#39;re cute with their fuzzy little cheeks... Er, but I am an oni, not a small, furry animal! I can stuff my face as much as I want!</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Is there anything I can do for you, Master?</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> ...O-oh, right. You aren&#39;t my Master now, are you?</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Very well then, I shall call you [♂ Lord /♀ Lady] Fujimaru.<br> ...Huh? That doesn&#39;t work, either?</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Th-then...I-I should just call you...Fujimaru?<br> Isn&#39;t that a little embarrassing?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Not at all! It&#39;s the best thing you could do under the circumstances! Also, you shouldn&#39;t be out of your seat like that.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Oh. Now that you mention it, I guess we are the only ones walking around the plane... I&#39;ll be careful.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Someone has been conspicuously quiet...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Where&#39;s Jeanne Alter?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Alter won our rock paper scissors game,<br> so she&#39;s living it up in first class.</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Another!</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Already!?</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Hahaha! There&#39;s no telling what this mysterious battlefield ahead may hold! We should feast our fill while we still can!</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> How many times do I gotta tell you!? You&#39;re not gonna get any magical energy from ice cream, no matter how much you eat!</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Oh, sorry &#39;bout that, miss. Don&#39;t mind us.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Just listening to them makes me smile...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Hehe, same here.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Just listening to them makes my stomach hurt...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It&#39;s okay, Senpai. Robin has it under control.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> We&#39;ll be landing in Hawaii soon.<br> The captain just made the announcement.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Um, Senpai? Would it be okay if I held your hand? I&#39;ve never been on an airplane before, so I&#39;m a little nervous...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> We&#39;re here!</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> That airplane thing wasn&#39;t half bad!<br> And the food was great!</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> You devoured half their store of dessert on your own... I can still feel that flight attendant&#39;s glare.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Thanks to you, I never got a chance to ask her about Hawaii, let alone try to pick her up.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Well, at least we made it here safely. Part of me thought we&#39;d crash before ever seeing land again.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> ...Hm? Hey Mash, you sure this is the right airport?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Uh, yes, I&#39;m fairly sure this is the Daniel K. Inouye International Airport on Oahu...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That said, it doesn&#39;t really look like the pictures... And we still haven&#39;t gone through customs...</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Customs... Is that like a checkpoint? If so, would we not find it by the airport&#39;s entrance?</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Don&#39;t worry, our passports are all in order.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> And Lady Da Vinci told me to just say “sightseeing”<br> if the customs people ask us why we&#39;re here!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> R-right, good point. We should be able to see if anything is awry once we&#39;re outsi–</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> ...Are you freakin&#39; kidding, Mash? Don&#39;t tell me the tropical heat&#39;s already getting to you?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Did you not stop and think that the Foreigner could just be messing with us?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Looking...good...!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> (She must&#39;ve stayed up all night putting that outfit together...!)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Uh, yes. That&#39;s a good point.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Well, that was direct.<br> Guess she&#39;s a bit brighter than I thought.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Shut up, Greenie.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Listen up. We&#39;re in enemy territory now. Drop your guard, even for a second, and we could all end up dead!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Whatever BS we feed customs, we&#39;re not actually here for sightseeing. Got that?</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> ...Well, yes, I suppose that&#39;s true.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Remember, we&#39;re up against a Foreigner–a monster from a whole other world. We gotta be ready to go all out as soon as we find it.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> And that means...? Exactly.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> We need to get in touch with Chaldea&#39;s Hawaiian office and assess the situation ASAP!</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> What is she talking about, Fujimaru?<br> And why is she dressed...like that?</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Is that her swimsuit? But...why is she carrying THREE katana? Is...is it just because they look cool?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong></p><p>!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> (I guess oni don&#39;t beat around the bush...)</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> (Guess that&#39;s a Berserker for you.<br> I don&#39;t think she even knows how to be subtle.)</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> ...Hmph.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> We&#39;re in Hawaii, right?<br> This is just how people dress here.</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Yeah, I read the guidebook, so I understand what you&#39;re thinking. But did you have to change already?</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> We&#39;re supposed to be passing ourselves off as ordinary people, right? Don&#39;t you think brandishing weapons in an airport will draw suspicion?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong></p><p>Why is she the one lampshading this!?</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> (Has she no heart!?<br> Oh, right. Oni.)</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong></p><p>Never mind all that!<br> Just hurry up and change already! All of you!</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> (She is clearly trying to bull-rush her way past all of this. As if that will fool anybody.)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> N-no, we&#39;ll be changing later. I&#39;m going to try and get in touch with Chaldea&#39;s Hawaiian office first.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Master, I&#39;m going to go exchange some of our money for US dollars.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Not to worry, I have already learned the proper procedure for doing so!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Ushiwakamaru doesn&#39;t waste any time getting down to business...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> So helpful... So this is what having an assistant is like...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I guess Ushiwakamaru takes her job just as seriously no matter where she goes.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...H-huh? I still can&#39;t seem to get a connection.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The line is open, but I&#39;m not getting any response... Maybe there&#39;s an emergency.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I&#39;m sorry to leave Ushiwakamaru behind,<br> but I think we should head outside now, Master!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> We still need to go through customs, right?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I think customs fingerprints you these days...</p><p><strong>H：？？？:</strong><br> Heh heh heh. You don&#39;t still think the normal rules apply here, do you?</p><p><strong>H：？？？:</strong><br> Don&#39;t worry, you don&#39;t have to go through all that boring rigmarole. After all...</p><p><strong>H：？？？:</strong><br> ...anyone is welcome on this island,<br> but no one can ever leave...</p><p><strong>H：？？？:</strong><br> That is the hellish paradise you have stumbled into, Sen...pai♡</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I-I recognize that demonic kouhai-ish voice...!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Kouhai...?</p><p><strong>H：Ultracute Guide:</strong><br> Hellooo. One pitiful Master and five Servants?<br> Right this way, pleeease☆</p><p><strong>H：Ultracute Guide:</strong><br> Oh, do you still need me to introduce myself?<br> What am I saying, of course you do!</p><p><strong>H：Ultracute Guide:</strong><br> Okay, here goes nothing!</p><p><strong>H：Ultracute Guide:</strong><br> Hotter than the hottest sun, purer than the deep blue sea, it&#39;s everyone&#39;s favoritest idol...BB!</p><p><strong>H：Ultracute Guide:</strong><br> Super AI and Moon Cancer extraordinaire, here to cheer her senpai AND make her swimsuit debut!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> You&#39;re BB...!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The same BB who just showed up one day as a Servant in Chaldea and does nothing but play pranks and claim to be capable of anything!?</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Yep! That&#39;s me! I got here early for this excursion so I could show the rest of you around.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> In faaact...</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Maaaster! Something is terribly wrong!</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Look at this money!<br> This isn&#39;t US currency!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Wait. I recognize these markings...!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Oh, this can&#39;t possibly end well!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Does this say...“In Gil we trust”...?<br> What&#39;s going on? Is this some kind of sick joke?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> This isn&#39;t the kind of money they use in Hawaii!<br> What&#39;s the meaning of this, BB!?</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Heh heh heh, I&#39;m so glad you asked, Mash.<br> We don&#39;t often get to see you be so aggressive!</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> I get it. Really, I do.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> You finally get to the tropical resort of your dreams, but once you&#39;re here it&#39;s one weird thing after another!</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Of course even mild-mannered Mash would get upset.<br> But this is only the beginning.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Hehehe. Hehehehe.<br> Hehehehehehehehe!</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Gyaaah! An earthquake!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Master, get outside, now!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Wh-what the...!?</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> And now it all comes together!<br> I know what you were thinking!</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> “I wanna go sightseeing in Hawaii!<br> I wanna kick back and relax in Honolulu!”</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Well, Fujimaru, as your luck would have it...</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> ...there&#39;s nothing I enjoy more than making all your selfish dreams come true!</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Now get ready to have your minds blown!<br> You&#39;re up, Singularity! Do your thing!</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> ...Hehehe. Here you go, Senpai.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> I had to use all the resources I&#39;ve been saving to make it, but now you have the resort of your dreams♡</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Here, you can enjoy anything you want. Thrills, chills, pleasures, debauchery, dreams, nightmares...aaanything.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Welcome, everyone. As the ruler of this little island, I&#39;m glad you can join me in the Luluhawa Singularity.</p><h2 id="six-days-until-servantfes" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#six-days-until-servantfes" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Six Days Until ServantFes</h2><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Well, now that that&#39;s taken care of, I&#39;ll get out of your hair for now☆ Enjoy your trip, everyone!</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Hm? Why Luluhawa, you ask? Well, what would you call a mashup of Honolulu and Hawaii?</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> I did my best to give our little stage here a cute name, so a little recognition for that would be nice!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Oh no. What did she do to the Hawaiian Islands...!? Come on Master, let&#39;s get outside and see for ourselves!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Well that&#39;s strange.<br> Or rather...nothing is strange...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> This is just how I always pictured Hawaii!<br> Nothing seems the least bit out of place, Senpai!</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> So, this is Hawaii, huh. And here I thought all it would be is just a really hot island.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> There&#39;s nice, warm sunlight...clean air...wide, spacious skies...!</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Man, I had no idea these resort places were so nice, Fujimaru!</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> This place is perfect for making summer memories!</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> True...<br> The ocean air here is brisk and refreshing...</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> The wind is nice and cool, while the sunlight is warm without being overbearing. It feels silly to even think about fighting here...</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Indeed. This place feels like they could be having festivals every day. I wonder if the people who live here are distinguished Kyoto citizens?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> ...Are you guys nuts?<br> Do you not realize what&#39;s going on?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Open your damn eyes and look, you morons!<br> The islands of Oahu and Hawaii are jammed together!</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Huh? How can you tell?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Look over there!<br> Recognize Hawaii&#39;s Mauna Kea from the guidebook?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> The Daniel K. Inouye International Airport is on Oahu! We shouldn&#39;t even be able to see Mauna Kea from here!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Oahu and Hawaii are over three hundred kilometers apart! It takes at least an hour to get there! By plane!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Say whaaat!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I&#39;m detecting the Singularity now too! The whole of the Hawaiian Islands has become a Singularity!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Of course it has!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Th-then, does this mean...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...we haven&#39;t been able to contact Chaldea&#39;s Hawaiian office because we&#39;re in a Singularity now...?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Master, don&#39;t you think that&#39;s going a little too far, even for BB...!?</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Nope. This is about the sort of thing she&#39;d do.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> She pretty much only acts on malice and a really twisted idea of good intentions.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Think...like taking a Halloween party and turning it into an actual hellscape.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> So, she causes trouble by going too far...meaning she tries to be kind, but misses the mark so badly it leads to disaster?</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Now I see... That reminds me of something my brother used to say: “Stick your nose out too far and it&#39;s liable to get cut off.”</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> So, I can&#39;t help but notice that guidebook&#39;s full of sticky notes.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> ...Freakin&#39; sue me, then.<br> There was a buncha stuff I wanted to bookmark.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> You must&#39;ve really been looking forward to this, huh?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Not really. Just did my homework like any sensible tourist should.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> ...Tch. Guess we don&#39;t have time to stand around gawking.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Mash. Robin. Ushiwakamaru. Ibaraki.<br> ...We&#39;ve got company.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Cluck cluck.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Huh? Hang on. Isn&#39;t that...a chicken?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Yes. Yes it is.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> That&#39;s one of Hawaii&#39;s specialties.<br> The “sort of chicken you find anywhere” chicken.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Now get your weapons ready!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Are we really doing this!?</p><p><strong>Chicken:</strong></p><p>Cluck cluuuck!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That was...an exceptionally large chicken.<br> I guess Hawaii is a good place to raise livestock.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Then again, maybe it&#39;s because of the Singularity...?</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> (...That was no ordinary chicken. It was wreathed in an evil aroma I&#39;ve never smelled before. Hmm...)</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Wait! There&#39;s another enemy here!<br> We must have missed one!</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> You&#39;re not going anywhere!<br> I&#39;ll cut your head off where you stand!</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Huh?</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> What&#39;s wrong, Master and company?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Ushiwaka, stoooooop!</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Yes, Master! I will stop this cretin in his tracks by separating his head from his shoulders!</p><p><strong>???:</strong></p><p>Bwa!?</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Uh-oh! A pretty girl with killer eyes is out to get me! Pirate&#39;s Glory!</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Phew, that was close.</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> I could have sworn his head just dropped like overripe fruit from a tree...</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong></p><p>!?</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> What&#39;s the deal, Master? Can&#39;t we forego the violence now that we&#39;re in Hawaii?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Y-you&#39;re...!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Huh? You&#39;re Edward Teach.<br> What&#39;re you doing here?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Oh, and if you so much as LOOK at me in my swimsuit, I&#39;ll cut your damn eyes out, you freakin&#39; perv!</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> Oho! A super aggressive girl who is all tsun and no dere...! What a rich bounty for an old otaku!</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> I thought I understood modern slang, but not a word of that made any sense to me.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Don&#39;t sweat it. You&#39;re better off, honestly.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Still, though. What are you doing here, Blackbeard?</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> ...Wait. Don&#39;t tell me...</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> Oh, you mean you didn&#39;t know?</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> I&#39;m here for ServantFes.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Sorry...for what?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> That sounds vaguely familiar...</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong></p><p>Oh yeah.</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> It&#39;s a regular get-together for Chaldean and non-Chaldean Servants.</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> We schmooze, join clubs, make doujins, dance,<br> sing, and generally enjoy ourselves. We call it:</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> The Servant!</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> Summer Star!</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> Festival!</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> Or ServantFes for short.</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Ohhh, so this is where ServantFes is happening this year! I was so focused on looking for Shuten that I forgot to check!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Master, I remember now!<br> When we were talking to Kiyohime...</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> Oh Maaasteeer.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> What&#39;s up, Kiyohime?<br> Is that...a swimsuit you&#39;re holding?</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> Why yes, it is. I thought I would prepare for the destination ahead of time.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> All right Master, I&#39;m going to go on ahead.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> I can&#39;t wait to see you there♡</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Uh, okay.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Have a good trip!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> So this is what she was talking about...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> No wonder my mornings have been so much more peaceful lately...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Explains the lack of feeling stalked the last few days...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Putting that aside for the moment...<br> Blackbeard, can you tell us more about ServantFes?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Uh, I mean, the Foreigner!<br> What can you tell us about the Foreigner!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That&#39;s the reason we came to Hawaii in the first place!</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> Foreigner? Hmm, I don&#39;t think there was a club called “Foreigner”...</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> Popular enough to have a wall booth? No? A newbie then? Hmm, sorry, never heard of stuff related to Foreigners.</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> But why are we even talking about work now, anyway!? That&#39;s enough of that!</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> ServantFes officially kicks off in six days!<br> I can&#39;t wait!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> What happened to defending humanity!?</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> Hey, come on! ServantFes is the stuff of dreams for Servants everywhere!</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> One Servant releases photo books to show off her beauty...</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> One Servant likes to sell DVDs of her horribad gatherings–sorry, “concerts”...</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> One Servant likes to listen to others&#39; tales of adventure to inspire his own novels...</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> And one Servant is holed up in her hotel room, crying about how she&#39;ll never finish her script in time.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> That last one doesn&#39;t sound like the stuff of dreams.</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> I&#39;m afraid Batty made an unfortunate decision to start playing the new World of Wyverns expansion right before her deadline...</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong></p><p>O-ohmigod, oh yes... It&#39;s so good... Can&#39;t stop...</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> C-come on, hands, put down the controller!<br> Please! I&#39;m onegai-ing you here!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Talk about digging your own grave...</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> Well, she&#39;s not the only one. I&#39;d bet most of the different clubs here are behind on their merch.</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> That&#39;s what happens when you&#39;re busy being the hero we deserve, amirite!? Don&#39;t worry, they&#39;ll get them done sooner or later!</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> Anyways, the Servants who didn&#39;t join any of the clubs are parlaying it into a normie vacation.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Now that you mention it,<br> I do see a lot of other Servants arou–</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> GODDAMN HOT!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Where&#39;d that come from!?</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> ...Yeah, that about fits.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> Master, Master. Can you please do something about this heat!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Can&#39;t you just use your spirit form?</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong></p><p>That solves nothing!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I think...you&#39;ll just have to take it off?</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> No respectable human being would agree to that,<br> let alone a grand duchess such as myself. I decline.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> ...I knew I should have known better than to trust Medb. (Sigh)... Goddammit...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Well, uh, between this Luluhawa Singularity and ServantFes, this is certainly a lot to take in...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...but overall, I think this is good news, Master.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Whatever the circumstances, the fact remains that all your Servants are here on this island. If they all join forces, we shouldn&#39;t have any trouble taking on the Foreign–</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> Uh, I don&#39;t think that&#39;s gonna work.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Why not?</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> We&#39;re talking about a Foreigner here.<br> If we don&#39;t all take it on togeth–</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> I hate to be “that” guy,<br> but all the Servants here...</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> ...have agreed that there won&#39;t be any real combat until ServantFes is over.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Wha...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Say whaaat!?</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Say whaaat!?</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> If you&#39;re wondering why, you should ask BB.</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> She&#39;s the one putting on this year&#39;s ServantFes.</p><p><strong>H：All:</strong><br> Huh!?</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Hold up! Did I hear someone talking about me?</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Speak this cute little devil&#39;s name, and she doth appear! The return of BB♡ the eternal summer guide♡</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Gah, knock it off!<br> One heart icon&#39;s more than enough!</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Yikes... Seriously, Robin? You come all this way to the tropics, and you&#39;re still being such a downer? Are you going through manopause or something...?</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> I hate to say it, but everything about you screams “minor character,” so I don&#39;t think making yourself seem like an old fogy will win you any fans...</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Buzz off! I&#39;m dancing with joy on the inside, all right!?</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> I&#39;d already be at the beach if it wasn&#39;t for the neckbeard here!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> All right, shut it.<br> You. You said your name was BB?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> You&#39;re the one running ServantFes?</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Why yes! Yes, I am♡ Just this year&#39;s, though.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> See, I heard they were having trouble finding a convention center for this year&#39;s ServantFes, and I thought I could help.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Turning all of Hawaii into a Singularity would make sure the Mystics stay secret, so now everyone can really cut loose!</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> The Servants get to make the most of their time in Hawaii, and ServantFes gets to be bigger than ever before!</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> And once ServantFes is over, the Singularity will disappear and the Hawaiian Islands will go right back to normal♡</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Everybody wins! Right? I might be chaotic-evil,<br> but even I can do a good deed once in a while!</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Go on, give it up for me!<br> That&#39;s it! Don&#39;t hold back now!</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> She does have a point... As far as I can tell,<br> this island seems to be perfectly peaceful.</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> Exactly. You won&#39;t find any mines at the beach or missiles at Diamond Head.</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> We took great pains to look into that sort of thing ourselves. Trust me, there&#39;s nothing dangerous here!</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Of course not! This is both a con and an event designed to increase my appeal!</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> That said, a plain old ServantFes would bring shame to the name BB!</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> So, for this ServantFes,<br> I&#39;ve instituted a ranking system!</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Listen up! Once the festivities are underway in six days&#39; time, I&#39;ll be rewarding the most popular club...</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> ...with a Holy Grail! Tadaaa!</p><p><strong>H：All:</strong><br> Seriously!?</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> I AM the one putting on this con, so of course I&#39;d have the authority to do that. Duh.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> And as a result, over half the Servants here at Luluhawa have said they&#39;re going to be joining clubs.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Now, I have a question for you and your group, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> What are you going to do while you&#39;re here?</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Don&#39;t worry, you don&#39;t have to make anything.<br> You can just spectate if you want.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> After all, you can&#39;t have entertainment without creators and an audience!</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> So go ahead and join a club, or just sit back and take it all in. It&#39;s up to you♡</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Though of course, the only way to get the Holy Grail will be by joining a club, so do keep that in mind.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> A Holy Grail... (Gulp)</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Right? Who wouldn&#39;t want a Holy Grail of their own!<br> I love that kind of straightforward desire most!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> How are you at making books, Mash?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I&#39;ve never made a book before. Chaldea never did have any arts and crafts programs...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I mean, I would certainly put my landscape and portrait paintings up against anyone else&#39;s, but...</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Just a moment, Master. I am curious about this ServantFes as well, but our mission lies elsewhere.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> She&#39;s right. We&#39;re not here for a vacation.<br> (Well, I am, but I still know I&#39;ve got a job to do.)</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> So I think it&#39;s best if we stick to being spectators. Right, Master?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> True. We&#39;ll be too busy with our mission.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> True. We&#39;ll be too busy with sightseeing.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> I see... Well that&#39;s too bad.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Once ServantFes is over, we&#39;ll be announcing each club&#39;s total sales numbers, awarding the Holy Grail...</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> ...and holding an awards ceremony to celebrate the most creative Servants.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Hmph. Who gives a rat&#39;s ass about sales numbers? But hey, if you guys wanna get all worked up over nothing, go right ahead.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Can&#39;t imagine the sorta Servants who&#39;d go around joining clubs like that are worthwhile, anyway.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> So it&#39;s nothing we need to worry about.<br> Right, Master?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...By the way, is there a club that&#39;s expected to win?</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Yup! That&#39;d be the club that won the last ServantFes by a landslide!</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> St. Orleans, led by Jeanne and friends!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong></p><p>Wait, what!? The hell&#39;d you just say!?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> HER!? Making doujins!? In a ServantFes club!?</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> Oh, you mean you didn&#39;t know?<br> Jeanne&#39;s huge at ServantFes.</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> Last year, I think her club sold out of every doujin they made the day before the doors even opened!</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> In fact, I already asked BB to ensure they put aside a copy of this year&#39;s doujin just for me...</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s all calculated or just a happy coincidence, but the way their cute art meshes with the intense story is just... (Chef&#39;s kiss)</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> Like, that bit when the heroine had a cannon full of phones and fired it to confess her love for the hero?</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> The way it ignores all the usual rom-com tropes made me think it might be a little too turn-of-century Orleans, but–</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> ...do it.</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> I&#39;m sorry, what was that?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong></p><p>I said I&#39;ll do it!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> If she came in first,<br> then she must be the one who drew that book!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> (“That book”...?)</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> If that&#39;s the way it is, then fine!<br> Me and Fujimaru&#39;ll make our own club!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Wait, how&#39;d I get dragged into this!?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Hey! We&#39;re a team, right!?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> We&#39;ll call ourselves “Gespenst Ketzer”!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Is that German?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Yeah. Sounds pretty badass, doesn&#39;t it?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> What&#39;s that mean...?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Something along the lines of “Heretical Monster”...?</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Theeere we go! Just the fish I&#39;d hoped to land!<br> Step right up, you two!</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> There you go, your club&#39;s all registered!<br> See you at section G-01 in six days!</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Feel free to bring in any kind of merch. Comics, novels, swimsuit magazines, tchotchkes, figurines...</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> In that case, I will join you as well, Master.<br> Say the word, and it shall be done.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> I believe it is high time I demonstrated there is more I can do than decapitate!</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Well, I&#39;m not gonna join! Nope!</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Now that we&#39;re in Hawaii,<br> the rest of you can go pound sand!</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> I&#39;m just here for the food! And to find Shuten!</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Okay, so that&#39;s a “no” from Ibaraki...</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> See you around, Master!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Uhhh...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Off she goes...</p><p><strong>E：Robin Hood:</strong><br> I know oni are free-spirited, but yikes...<br> Still, I can&#39;t say she&#39;s got the wrong idea.</p><p><strong>E：Robin Hood:</strong><br> Think I&#39;m gonna pass, too. Not spending my time at a tropical resort working hunched over a desk.</p><p><strong>E：Robin Hood:</strong><br> I don&#39;t care about this club stuff,<br> and I can&#39;t draw anyway.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Are you sure about that?</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> I mean, if Senpai&#39;s club doesn&#39;t do well,<br> you&#39;re going to turn into a pig, you know?</p><p><strong>E：Robin Hood:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>E：Robin Hood:</strong><br> ...Why?</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Because I said so, of course!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Why would you be smug about that?</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Okay Robin, I&#39;ll go ahead and cast the spell on you now to make sure you feel it.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Sakura Beeeam! ...Wait, scratch that.<br> Luluhawa☆Beeeam!</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Gah! You actually did it!</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> What is this, a swimsuit!? It is, isn&#39;t it!?<br> Dammit...you&#39;ve got pretty good taste...</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Even worse, I certainly can&#39;t forget how I&#39;ll end up as a pig if Fujimaru&#39;s book doesn&#39;t do well...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> What a dreadful spell...</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Don&#39;t worry! As long as your club actually makes a book, this spell won&#39;t activate!</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> I have a lot of faith in your work ethic and abilities, Robin.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> You&#39;re the perfect man for looking after slovenly writers and inspiring unmotivated ones!</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> I&#39;d go so far as to say that, among Heroic Spirits,<br> you are a comic editor born!</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> So on that note, Robin, get to work!<br> Don&#39;t you dare let Senpai down!</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Dammit, I knew I should&#39;ve run for it as soon as we hit the tarmac...!</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Okay, Senpai, I can&#39;t wait to see what your club comes up with.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Oh, and while I&#39;m sure this goes without saying...</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> ...ServantFes has some innocent children among its attendees, so make sure it&#39;s family-friendly!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> I don&#39;t do inappropriate, dumbass!</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> Damn, you&#39;re gonna write and draw a whole book in a week? That&#39;s a hell of a thing.</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> ...Well, since you&#39;re mostly Servants, I guess you could get one done a good bit faster than normal if you go without sleep...</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> By the way, Alter, have you had any experience making doujins?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> No. Does that matter?</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> None? What the hell, Dragon Witch?<br> You think this shit is easy?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Y-you don&#39;t have any experience at all!?<br> Don&#39;t you think that&#39;s kind of–</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> No, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s easy!<br> I know it&#39;s a ton of work!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Yeah, I&#39;m a beginner. I&#39;m as green as they come.<br> But SO WHAT!? I&#39;m still gonna kick her ass!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> ...I have to.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> And if that means drawing a doujin or two, then you bet your ass I&#39;m gonna draw the best damn doujin ever!</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> ...Well, it&#39;s good that you&#39;re motivated, but if you think this is going to be easy, you&#39;re in for a rude awakening...</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> (Sigh) Good grief.<br> Are you sure you&#39;re going to be okay, Master?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...I&#39;ll figure something out...</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> Figure something out? There aren&#39;t even any copy services around here we could use... (Sigh)... It&#39;s not easy, being a Good Samaritan...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Not even a little. Please help.</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> Yeah, that sounds about right! I like your honesty!</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> All right, guess I&#39;ve got no other choice.</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> I&#39;ll be your doujin master, pirate Servant style!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> ...Oh, so that&#39;s how it is, huh?<br> You wanna get skewered like meat over a bonfire?</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> Hell yeah!<br> I&#39;m a pirate first and foremost, after all!</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> If you want my insider tips,<br> you&#39;ll have to beat them out of me!</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> O Captain, my Captain!</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> I think, therefore I&#39;m kick-ass!<br> Come on, let&#39;s do this thing!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Oh yeah. You&#39;re a real philosopher...</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong></p><p>Guh!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> All right! We won!</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> ...But...the only one who can beat me...is me...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> That doesn&#39;t work without his voice.</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> Sorry. Got caught up in the moment.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> You&#39;re not fooling anyone, you know.</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> Well, that&#39;s just not nice.</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> Anyway, since you won,<br> I&#39;ll keep my word and help you out.</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> Start by heading for that hotel over there.<br> It&#39;s one of Waikiki&#39;s finest.</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> If you hurry, you&#39;ll be able to get the special ServantFes deal of a hundred thousand BB Bucks a night!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I have no idea if that&#39;s a good deal.</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> Anyway, that&#39;s your only option. All the other hotels are completely booked because ServantFes.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> So those are the only lodgings available to us, hmm.<br> Although... Teach, that hotel over there...</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Am I mistaken, or is that the Shelton,<br> the single largest resort hotel in Waikiki?</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> Ayup. I&#39;d reserved a room there for me and my old pirate crew to have a bit of drunken revelry, but then that smarmy Bartholomew was all...</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> “Sorry, Teach, but I already reserved the five-star place next door. If I see you at the con, you and I don&#39;t know each other, &#39;kay?”</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> Guh, it still makes me mad! Anyway, that&#39;s why I&#39;m not staying at that hotel myself now. Too fancy for me.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Wonderful! Thank you, Lord Teach!<br> I had the wrong idea about you!</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Come, Master, let us hurry there,<br> before Lord Teach changes his mind!</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> We can rest assured that that hotel is a first-class institution!</p><h2 id="wake-up-xx" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#wake-up-xx" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Wake up! XX!</h2><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Finally, we&#39;re at the hotel.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Damn, this place is fancy!</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong><br> Welcome to–<br> Oh, it&#39;s you guys.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> What&#39;re you doing here!?</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong><br> Say hello to Henry Jekyll, hotel manager! ...That is, for the duration of ServantFes, at least.</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong><br> Somebody has to take care of the various administrative duties for an event like this if it is to go smoothly.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> That so. Sounds like a lotta work.<br> Anyway, we wanna check in.</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong><br> Yes, of course. It looks like Blackbeard–er,<br> Mr. Blackbeard reserved a suite. Is that acceptable?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Hell yeah.</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong><br> ...You do understand it&#39;s a penthouse?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Kick-ass. Gotta love living in the lap of luxury.</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong><br> Very good. Is that all right with you too, Master?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I really don&#39;t think I need a sui–</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> What, and make it so I&#39;ve gotta call you all the way in another room if I need something? Screw that.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Yes, we&#39;ll all be staying in the suite, please.</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong><br> Very good. One of our bellhops will be with you shortly.</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong><br> Yoohoo, Saber.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> What&#39;s up, Bean Sprout?</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong><br> Hahaha, I&#39;d appreciate you treating me with a little more respect, now that I&#39;m your boss and all.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> Nope.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> Hey, just so you know, the suite is stupidly expensive, so don&#39;t trash the place or get into any fights in there or anything.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> ...Hah!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> You, telling us not to fight?<br> Is that a pig I just saw flying outside?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> Bait me all you want, I&#39;m still not gonna fight.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> And for the record, every single hotel is completely booked, so if we toss you out, you&#39;ll be spending ServantFes on the streets.</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong><br> Now, now, Saber, no threatening our guests.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> Yeah, yeah.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> Oh, and one more thing: there&#39;s no room service.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> If you want something to eat,<br> you&#39;ll have to come down to the lobby.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> What kind of half-assed operation are you running here!?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> The only ones here are me, Bean Sprout,<br> and a few golems to carry luggage.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> But don&#39;t worry, we got some good eats here.<br> I &#39;specially recommend the avocado toast.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> You can really taste the wheat in the bread they use.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Ooh, that does sound delicious. Come on, Senpai, let&#39;s go put our things in our room and then have lunch!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Right on!</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> Okay, here&#39;s your room keys.<br> Oh, and one last thing.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> Don&#39;t go sneaking into other rooms, got it? Visiting with permission is one thing, but no sneaking around!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> What do you take me for!?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> ...Yeah, good point.<br> Guess I don&#39;t gotta worry about you, do I.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> What about somebody sneaking into our room?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> THAT&#39;S what you&#39;re worried about!?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> ...Well, uh...I think you&#39;ll be okay...<br> Probably...</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong><br> Oh, if it isn&#39;t the other Jeanne!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Aw crap. It&#39;s Princess Sparkles.</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong><br> Are you staying here, too?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Uh, yes, we are. You are too, Marie?</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong><br> Oh yes. Jeanne and I are sharing a room!</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong><br> We just got to the best part of our work, too!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Work? What work...?</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong><br> Oh, did I not tell you?<br> We&#39;re making a book together for ServantFes!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> ...Figures. I knew she couldn&#39;t have drawn a story like that on her own.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> So you&#39;re in cahoots with her, huh?</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong><br> Cahoots...? Oh, you mean you thought our story was a hoot?</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong><br> Thank you! That means a lot, coming from you.<br> Vive la France!</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong><br> Are you here for ServantFes too, Alter? When we finish with our books, we should each give the other a copy!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Hell yeah. Tell her to brace herself, &#39;cause when we&#39;re done with ours, she won&#39;t know what hit her.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> (Whispering) Master, it would probably be better not to mention we still don&#39;t know the first thing about drawing doujin.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You can say that again. ...Oh, but don&#39;t.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> All right, Master, why don&#39;t we go to our room, too?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I can&#39;t wait to see what our suite is like!</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Master! Are you here, Master!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> What&#39;s up?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Ibaraki...?<br> I thought you went off to look for Shuten?</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> That was before I realized something crucial!</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong></p><p>Where&#39;s MY swimsuit!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Huh?</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> I can&#39;t go swimming dressed like this!<br> Trust me, I tried!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I, uh, I see. What about your Morph skill?<br> Did you try that?</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Don&#39;t be stupid! How can I change myself into a swimsuit when I don&#39;t even know what my swimsuit looks like!?</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Besides, you&#39;re my Master. Shouldn&#39;t finding me an appropriate swimsuit be your job!?</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Well? Come on. Come on. Come on!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I&#39;m sorry, I can&#39;t...!</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Why do you apologize?</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> ...Wait. Does this mean I can&#39;t wear a swimsuit?</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> ...No more pestering our Master, Ibaraki-Douji.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> You have no one to blame but yourself for not asking Lady Scáthach ahead of time.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> There are only so many Servants who can tamper with their Spirit Origins, after all.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> All of that is to say...</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Wh-wh-wha...</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> You should have thought ahead and planned accordingly, as I did.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> It&#39;s not right to blame Master for this, Ibaraki.</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong></p><p>When did you change into that getup!?</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> What do you think, Master?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You look badass.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Thank you, Master!</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> I certainly feel much lighter in this outfit... It reminds me of the time I spent training on Mt. Kurama!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> You look beautiful.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Thank you, Master. Indeed, I&#39;m told this swimsuit is patterned after a beautiful katana.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> I certainly feel much lighter in it. It reminds me of the time I spent training on Mt. Kurama!</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> W-w-well, so what!?<br> I actually own a mountain! So there!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Now I feel bad for her...</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> You are very kind, Master. Personally, I feel that she made her bed, and should lie in it. But I will respect your wishes.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Why don&#39;t we talk to Scáthach about a swimsuit for Ibaraki the next time we see her?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I&#39;m sure that will cheer her up.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Guess I&#39;d better go consult Scáthach...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That&#39;s a good idea. Although, I&#39;m not sure if she is even here in Luluhawa.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> But never mind that now, Master.<br> You still need to see your room!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Oh, right!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> This is really nice...</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou... Fouuu.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Let&#39;s go see what the view&#39;s like from the balcony.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> The weather&#39;s gorgeous, too!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> And look at that beautiful beach!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Wow, they&#39;ve even got shooting stars here!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong></p><p>Fooou!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Master, come quickly!<br> I picked up the Foreigner&#39;s signal!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I think the shooting star you just saw was the Foreigner!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Wow, that was fast!</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong><br> Aah!

That mysterious object crash-landed at Waikiki Street!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Come on, everyone, let&#39;s go!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Apropos of nothing, I noticed you changed too, Mash!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Y-yes, I did.<br> My other outfit is made for Chaldea, so...</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Ah, get the stick out of your ass, Master.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Let&#39;s just kick this thing&#39;s ass,<br> then go enjoy our vacation!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> And our doujin! Don&#39;t you dare forget the doujin we need to make!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Is that...BB!?</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> It looks like the Foreigner is fighting her...</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Oh, Fujimaru!<br> Perfect timing!</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> A mysterious Servant crash-landed here and is going around wrecking everything!</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> I&#39;d love to deal with them myself, but I&#39;m using all my amazing powers to keep the tourists safe.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Besides, I don&#39;t wanna ruin my swimsuit in a fight!<br> Come on, help me out here!</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Your misplaced concerns about your swimsuit aside, I commend your initiative in keeping the other people safe! Rest assured, we will handle this villain!</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Be ready, Robin, Mash!<br> Our enemy is about to emerge from the smoke!</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> ...Illegal Servants detected!<br> Existence forbidden. Executing all targets.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Huh?</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Hm?</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> ...(Agape)</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Plate armor?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Me... Me...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Ro... Ro...</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> It&#39;s a mecha!<br> No, it&#39;s a robot!</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> But this really isn&#39;t the time to worry about that! I&#39;ve never seen that Servant&#39;s Spirit Origin before!</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> What&#39;s more, it&#39;s dead set on killing everything in sight! Take it out before it hurts any innocent bystanders!</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> ...Destroy.<br> ...Destroy!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Come on, everyone! Let&#39;s do this!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> ...Shift ended. Terminating combat.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Do not think this is over. Primitive life-forms.<br> This convention will not stand.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> I promise you. On my honor as a Foreigner.<br> I will crush ServantFes!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The enemy Foreigner transformed and rolled ou–I mean, flew away!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I can&#39;t track her!</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Oh, fan-freakin&#39;-tastic. Just what we need.<br> Another powerful enemy with crazy weapons.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Good thing BB threw up that barrier in time,<br> or this whole area would be rubble...</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> So that is the Foreigner... She seemed...different from Lady Abby or Lady Hokusai. If anything...</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> ...it felt like she was closer to that mysterious Servant...</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Hmmhmm, so that&#39;s the Foreigner everyone&#39;s been talking about, huh.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Mind filling little old me in about what&#39;s going on, Senpai?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Well... (Deliver exposition)</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Now I see...</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> I had no idea that was going down while I was getting ready to toy with–I mean, reward you for all your hard work...</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> So, I get that this Foreigner is a visitor from outer space with a special Spirit Origin, and that she&#39;s an existential threat to mankind...</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> ...but I don&#39;t get why she showed up here at my Luluhawa...</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Eh, she&#39;s probably just throwing a jealous tantrum after she saw how much fun we&#39;re having.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong></p><p>Hmm, makes sense.<br> Especially coming from a nerd like you.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> But hey, now that you drove her off,<br> Senpai, we have nothing to worry about!</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Sure, it sounded like she&#39;ll probably come back at some point, but you can just send her packing again, right? I mean, that IS your job and all.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> So I&#39;m trusting you guys to handle that.<br> Remember, ServantFes is in your hands♡</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...And BB disappeared again. She certainly likes to come and go as she pleases...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Still, it is lucky that we ran into the Foreigner so soon after we got here.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> And since it looks to be very likely that she&#39;ll show up of her own accord again...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...I think the smart thing for us to do would be to set ourselves up here on Waikiki Street and wait for her to appear while we investigate Luluhawa.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> (The hell was that thing...? I can&#39;t possibly make them let me focus on the doujin now...)</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Hang on now, let&#39;s not go forgetting about ServantFes. I&#39;ve got a lot riding on our success here.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Basically, we&#39;ve just gotta make a book, right? So let&#39;s just slap some photos of Luluhawa into an album and make a guidebook or something.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Are you nuts!? We can&#39;t possibly win with some half-assed entry like that!</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> That&#39;s where you&#39;re wrong, missy. Creative endeavors start small! You think your first novel could be your magnum opus? Or your first painting would be a masterpiece? Or your first game a smash hit? No way!</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> As the manager of this operation, my first order of business is this: we&#39;ve gotta polish our skills, refine our sensibilities, and find inspiration wherever we can!</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> If we explore Luluhawa, we can look for leads on this Foreigner, collect reference material, and learn the tricks of the trade!</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Personally, I think that&#39;s the way to go.<br> What do you think, Dragon Witch?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Khh... Fine. You&#39;re right. I admit, we don&#39;t know jack as far as drawing doujin is concerned.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> We&#39;ll scrounge up all the BB Bucks or Gil Bucks we can, buy art supplies, and go look for stuff we want to draw.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Got that, Fujimaru?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> The success of Gespenst Ketzer is riding on your shoulders.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> As our Master, it&#39;s your job to train us and make sure we don&#39;t waste a single day!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> So you just need reference material, huh? Leave it to me!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> So you just want to go sightseeing, huh? Leave it to me!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That was a great Da Vinci impression, Senpai!</p><h2 id="sightseeing-for-research" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#sightseeing-for-research" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Sightseeing...for Research</h2><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Good morning, Master! No, scratch that!<br> It&#39;s a beautiful morning, Master!</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> I can&#39;t put my finger on it, but there&#39;s just something...invigorating about this place!</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> I don&#39;t have many fond memories of the ocean, but I really like it here at Luluhawa. It&#39;s enough to make me want to go swimming!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Good morning, Senpai. Did you sleep well last night?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> There was so much exciting commotion coming from Waikiki Street that I couldn&#39;t get to sleep myself...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It looks like they hold a festival every night. It&#39;s so peaceful, and there&#39;s laughter everywhere you go...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I guess this is just what life in the tropics is like. I can see why so many people come here to unwind.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Yeah, it made my walk last night a real drag.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> There were so many people on the streets, I couldn&#39;t get so much as one decent photo, even after midnight.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Morning. Now that we&#39;re all here,<br> let&#39;s head down to the lobby.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> We should grab ourselves a table for the breakfast buffet before they all fill up.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Oh wow...!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> This place is huuuge!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Everything looks so good!</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Damn, they got everything here. American, Italian, Japanese, and everything in between!</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Mmm, and it all tastes as good as it looks! Hell, maybe even better! Here Master, you gotta try this.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> See? Pretty damn good, right?<br> I&#39;ve never had better banana syrup in my life!</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Ooh, so this is their bacon. Mmm, smells so good. And it&#39;s twice as big as what they serve at Chaldea...</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Very salty, though. I wonder if having so much salt at once is a good idea...</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Aw, why not! We&#39;re on vacation, after all! Plus, there&#39;s no Benkei here to nag me about my cholesterol! All right, it&#39;s meat time!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Here&#39;s a table, Senpai. Don&#39;t worry about coffee;<br> the server will pour it for us.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Wow, we have an ocean view, too.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> These sounds of the ocean are so soothing...</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong><br> Morning, Fujimaru, Mash.<br> I see you&#39;re here on vacation.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Boudica! Good morning.<br> Are you here on vacation, too?</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong><br> Hmm, yes and no? Vacation&#39;s part of it,<br> but I&#39;m also here on business.</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong><br> You know the Fluffy-Eared Queen? She talked me into working as a chef here. And I&#39;m not the only one.</p><p><strong>Tamamo Cat:</strong><br> That she&#39;s not!</p><p><strong>Tamamo Cat:</strong><br> Usually this cat&#39;s much more pawticular about how she prepares her carrots, but in this joint, it&#39;s all about quantity over quality.</p><p><strong>Tamamo Cat:</strong><br> After all, this cat&#39;s also a maid, and here in Luluhawa, buffets are what&#39;s MAID to order!</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Hm? Red Mantle isn&#39;t here? Weird. I&#39;d have thought he&#39;d be the first in line for a chef job...</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Well, either way, I&#39;ve got no complaints about the nosh. So from now on, we&#39;ll be starting every day with breakfast right here!</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> They say it&#39;s the most important meal of the day and all, so tucking in here oughta give us plenty of energy for the rest of the day.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> As for what we do during the day, that&#39;s up to Master. We could hang out at the beach, go shopping...</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> It&#39;s only our second day here, so whatever we want to do, we have plenty of time. It&#39;s important that we just relax and enjoy Luluhawa.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Sounds like a plan.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> You okay with that, Alter?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> That&#39;s fine during the day.<br> But at night, we meet back up at the hotel.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> I&#39;ve got a lot of stuff to look up, and I want you guys snapping photos like there&#39;s no tomorrow in the meantime.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Don&#39;t worry, Alter. I&#39;ve got it well in hand.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I thought something like this might happen, so I made sure to bring along a top-of-the-line camera.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> If it&#39;s photos you want, then photos you&#39;ll get! Luluhawa landscapes... Senpai hiking up a mountain...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Senpai diving into the ocean... Senpai getting on the bus... Senpai eating a waffle dog...</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Uh...yeah. I got it. Anyway, it&#39;s great that you&#39;re fired up about this, Mash. You can handle taking photos, then.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Roger that!<br> Okay Senpai, let&#39;s go begin our expedition.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I recommend we start with Diamond Head Beach and Diamond Head itself!</p><h2 id="an-aloha-guy-arrives-in-hawaii" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#an-aloha-guy-arrives-in-hawaii" aria-hidden="true">#</a> An Aloha Guy Arrives in Hawaii</h2><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Hm? You wanna know how to make doujin? You really signed up for ServantFes without even knowing that?</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Heh, that&#39;s either really brave, or really reckless. Reminds me of how bad last year&#39;s Halloween got.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> But that&#39;s okay with me.<br> I like a little recklessness.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> All right, as a fellow Anti-Hero...of sorts,<br> I&#39;ll offer you a word of advice.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> I don&#39;t know what sort of story you&#39;re looking to draw, but you can&#39;t just go right to a printer with a draft.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> First, you need to actually make an appointment to see the printer.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Your schedule&#39;s already pretty packed, right? Trust me, I know. Mine&#39;s wound tighter than a boa constrictor.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> There&#39;s pretty much no chance of you sending your draft to the printer before the very last second, so if I were you, I&#39;d go meet them while I still could.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> You&#39;ll find them right arooound...here,<br> between Waikiki Street and the airport.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> I recommend taking the bus over a taxi.<br> Seriously, Waikiki&#39;s public transport is awesome.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> ...So I took her advice and went down to the printer, but the owner wasn&#39;t there.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Hm? I don&#39;t suppose that is the owner there?</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> He certainly looks the part,<br> and his dress could not be more Hawaiian.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Who are you talking about?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Maybe...he&#39;s a tourist...?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I&#39;m getting some serious déjà vu here...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Well, there&#39;s one surefire way to find out.<br> Alohaaa!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Alohaaa.</p><p><strong>Aloha Guy:</strong><br> Aloha, youngsters. I say, is it just me, or is there something strange about Hawaii lately?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Well, uh, yes, you could certainly say that.</p><p><strong>Aloha Guy:</strong><br> I knew it.</p><p><strong>Aloha Guy:</strong><br> You see, my homuncu–er,<br> attendants were just telling me:</p><p><strong>Aloha Guy:</strong><br> “Aw man, we&#39;ve gotta shut down soon, huh. If only we could take a paid vacation to Hawaii, just once...”</p><p><strong>Aloha Guy:</strong><br> They were rather enthusiastic about it, in fact.</p><p><strong>Aloha Guy:</strong><br> At any rate, I came here to take a look at the Hawaiian branch of the organization I aim to acquire one day...</p><p><strong>Aloha Guy:</strong><br> ...but there&#39;s clearly something else strange going on here right now. For example, who are all those strange people mixed in among the regular tourists?</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> I believe it is because of ServantFes, portly one.</p><p><strong>Aloha Guy:</strong><br> ...Ah, now I see.<br> A large-scale convention for “those” sorts, eh.</p><p><strong>Aloha Guy:</strong><br> Well, that just won&#39;t do.<br> My danger sense is going absolutely berserk!</p><p><strong>Aloha Guy:</strong><br> Hey, you lot!

Long as we get the final draft done, the rest&#39;ll work itself out.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Then let&#39;s go back to the hotel and brainstorm.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Right on. We&#39;ll brainstorm until we figure out what kinda story we wanna write. If that works out, we can go right to the drawing and writing phase!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> We could also just make our own photocopies.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Ulp... I was really hoping to avoid that, but I guess, if we&#39;ve got no other choice... Then again...can we really get by with just photocopies?</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> All right then, let&#39;s go back, have some dinner, and discuss story ideas.

Her loss!</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Take it all in, Master.<br> Not a better beach to be found than this!</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> I&#39;m referring to the ocean. Obviously. Beautiful blue water, and not a speck of garbage anywhere on the glittering white sands.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Sure, it&#39;s impossible to take pictures of it without taking photos of the people here too, but what&#39;re you gonna do? It&#39;s the beach!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> There sure are a lot of Servants here...<br> I don&#39;t think I even recognize all of them.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Most of &#39;em are probably here for ServantFes.

I was a little taken aback by how open and spacious everything is here at first, but here I am a week later, a full-blown Luluhawa Heroic Spirit.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> I&#39;m really enjoying Luluhawa.<br> The sound of the waves... The gentle breeze...</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> The seemingly endless supply of cheap,<br> delicious pizza... The friendly locals...</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> Just getting to see the ocean would have been enough for me...</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> ...but as you can see, Marie and I are enjoying this so much it&#39;s almost embarrassing!</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> Oh, did I mention I met an unexpected guardian angel and learned a new attack too?</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> Anyway, I have to say that Luluhawa really agrees with me!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I&#39;m Fujimaru, and I approve this message!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> So what&#39;s the deal with that floatie?</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> Hehehe. So you noticed, did you?<br> You want to know more about it, don&#39;t you?</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> This might look like a floatie, but it&#39;s actually a halo designed to guide summer angels.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> It&#39;s my special weapon!

Right, Senpai?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> That&#39;s right. Mind if we take one, Jeanne?</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> Oh. You mean you want me to model for you?

A Saber, huh.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> So I guess you&#39;re Medb 2.0?</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Exact–Uh, the nineties called...something about wanting their naming jokes back.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> What happened to the outfit you had last year?</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> I&#39;ve still got it safely tucked away, of course.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> A queen has to dress for all occasions, you know.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Um, Medb...? Could I ask you something?</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> All right. Permission to speak, granted.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Were you having a photo shoot here? It sounds like you have no problem with being photographed...</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> That&#39;s right. I&#39;m in the middle of a major photo shoot at the moment.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Yours truly will be putting out a book at ServantFes too. A photo book, to be precise.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> You&#39;re publishing at ServantFes too!?<br> But why would you go with a photo book when...</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> (No, wait. She might be a tougher competitor than I&#39;m thinking... Whatever her personality issues, the effect her magical energy has on men is real.)</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> (Remember, she took control of a nation with her charm spell alone. If she releases a sexy photo book...)</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> You don&#39;t say. That sounds fascinating. So who&#39;ve you got working the camera? The lion-head?</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Oh please. As if I&#39;d let Edison get involved and then run off with most of the profits.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> No, the only ones who get to photograph this gorgeous bod are my adorable, pitiful slaves.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> I think I scooped up at least a hundred poor saps with cameras on this beach alone♡</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> ...Something about this woman rubs me the wrong way. Shall we fight her, Master?</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> Now, now. It&#39;s against the law in Luluhawa to go around picking fights. Besides, I&#39;m sure we can all get along.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> (Aw crap. Fujimaru and the rest of them still don&#39;t get what a threat this is...)</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> (We&#39;re talking a photo book shot by a hundred skilled photographers. In which case...)</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> So where&#39;s your table then? I&#39;m guessing it&#39;s lost in the middle somewhere, if this is your first time at this con?</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Hehe, don&#39;t be silly.<br> I got a spot near the wall, of course!</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> There was another club with a weird name in the spot I wanted, so I negotiated with them for it.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> What were they called again...?<br> I think it was &quot;Tentacle Iron Bar&quot; or something.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Their club rep was absent though, so the only one I talked to was Abby, one of the underlings.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> The rep for Tentacle Iron Bar was absent...?</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> That&#39;s strange... Nothing short of the collapse of humanity itself would make them miss ServantFes...</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> ...Just a moment. You don&#39;t expect us to believe these “negotiations” were on the up-and-up, do you?</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Huh?</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> The hell are you talking about? Of course they were.<br> I said give, and they gave. What else is there to it?</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> So you threatened them? No, I doubt it was even that. I&#39;m guessing you think they just gave you what you wanted out of the goodness of their hearts.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Oh, I recognize that look of yours. It&#39;s the look of someone who thinks they deserve everything they want just for being pretty, and shouldn&#39;t ever have to give anyone anything in return.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Clearly, Lady Masako had nothing on you.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Is that so?<br> You&#39;ve got guts, saying that to my face.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Your own figure&#39;s...okay, but it&#39;s obvious your only beauty regimen is working out.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> When you get right down to it, “sporty” is really just another word for “stocky.” You don&#39;t have an elegant curve to your name.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> So how about you just stick to sports and leave the swimsuits and sex appeal to those of us who know something about them, tengu girl?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Uh-oh... I don&#39;t like where this is headed!<br> Do something, Robin!</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Sorry, this is out of my hands.<br> These two are natural enemies.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Oh yes. Since we&#39;re on the subject, it&#39;s not just that look of hers. The way she moves, the way she acts...</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> On that, we agree. It&#39;s not just the look in your eyes I hate. Those spindly arms and legs...</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru &amp; Medb:</strong></p><p>...make me sick!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Please calm down, Ushiwakamaru!</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Let go of me, Master! Who does she think she is, having just the right amount of fat on those gorgeous legs!?</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> You can tell she doesn&#39;t work out at all, yet she still has a perfect body! Every breath she draws is an affront to us athletic types!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Do something, Robin!</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Whoa there! Come on, Ushiwaka, settle down!</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong></p><p>Let go of me! Let GO of me!</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Hmph. This is exactly why I hate yokels from the mountains.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> You really think you get as much out of training as you put in? How clueless can you get?</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Whatever. As a true queen, it&#39;s incumbent upon me to show you what sets royalty apart from the rabble.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Consider yourself lucky that you get to see my power in action!</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> These are the heroes who swore loyalty to my beauty...my Good-Looking Braves!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Good-looking? Brave?<br> Something&#39;s not adding up here!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou?<br> Fou fo, fou fou.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Don&#39;t be silly♡</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> These guys all want to look good for me, and they&#39;re bravely willing to do anything if it&#39;ll help.</p><p><strong>GLB:</strong></p><p>Yeeeah!</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> I thought you said the photographers were your slaves!</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> What are you talking about?<br> Celts don&#39;t do slavery.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> If we did, we&#39;d call my Celtic warriors slaves,<br> but we don&#39;t. Is that so hard to understand...?</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Of course, that rule doesn&#39;t apply to non-Celts, though!</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> All right then, my beloved braves!</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Remove these cretins from these lovely shores, that my reign as the even lovelier Queen of the Beach might continue unopposed!</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> ...There you have it, Master.<br> We are now well past the point of diplomacy.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Since the only worthwhile reference material we might get off her is from the neck down, you won&#39;t mind if I chop off anything above that, right?</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> She could even contribute to the arts as the next Venus de Milo, but with a missing head instead of arms!</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Come on. Pretty please?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Puppy dog eyes aren&#39;t going to help!</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Well, well, you sure talk tough. Fine, if you think you can make me into an old Greek statue, you go ahead and do your worst!</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> Oh! I recognize that sport.<br> They&#39;re sumo wrestling!</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> I thought it was usually practiced by half naked men, though... I guess those two must be very good friends...</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> Well, don&#39;t hog all the fun, you two!<br> Let me join you!</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Aw crap. The Luluhawa heat must be getting to her even more than it is Alter...! Looks like we&#39;ve got no choice but to join in too, Master!</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> We&#39;ve gotta get Ushiwaka to settle down before she kicks up a storm and ruins this awesome weather for the rest of the tourists, including me!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Ugh, that fan of hers kicks up a literal storm!<br> What a pain in the ass!</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Braves, we&#39;re leaving! There&#39;s no point holding a photo shoot if she&#39;s going to rain on my parade!</p><p><strong>GLB:</strong><br> Roger that! I&#39;d suggest switching over to a wet T-shirt shoot in that case, but I suppose we would need special equipment for that!</p><p><strong>GLB:</strong><br> All right guys, you heard Her Majesty! Remember, we&#39;re still on for the deep-sea dive shoot this afternoon!</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Welp, this has been &quot;fun&quot; and all, but I&#39;m afraid I&#39;m too busy to play with you dweebs anymore.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Good luck with your little book project! You&#39;re gonna need it, since there&#39;s absolutely no chance a club of newbies like you could ever make anything good!</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Hmph! Newbies! She should talk! She&#39;d better hope she doesn&#39;t get a cramp and end up drowning!</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> Hehe, that was fun! I think I&#39;m getting the hang of being an Archer!</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> Anyway, I&#39;d better get going. I don&#39;t want to keep Marie waiting for our lunch date.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> You&#39;ve all got a club too, right?<br> Then I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll see you again at ServantFes!</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Sheesh... So we just ran into the reps for two major clubs purely by accident, huh.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Between Jeanne&#39;s production talent and Medb&#39;s unorthodox approach, we&#39;ve got our work cut out for us...</p><h2 id="on-the-shore-with-a-special-kouhai" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#on-the-shore-with-a-special-kouhai" aria-hidden="true">#</a> On the Shore with a Special Kouhai</h2><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Sorry to bother you all.<br> I was just curious how things are going.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Well...we&#39;ve got a basic direction now...I think. But really, I&#39;m not sure what it is I&#39;m drawing myself...</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Don&#39;t worry, it&#39;s surprisingly readable. It&#39;s almost like you were already a fan of manga or something.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> ...I&#39;ve been reading them for a while.<br> They were helpful for learning to read and write.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> It was only recently that I started trying to understand how they work. There&#39;s both an art and a science to things like panel layout, writing dialogue, and so on.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> So you used a reference then. Does that mean you didn&#39;t come up with this art style yourself?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> What? You got some kinda problem with imitation?</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Not at all. Every learning endeavor begins with imitation. I have certainly learned my share of things via monkey see, monkey do.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Now that you have the fundamentals down,<br> all you need to do is work on improving your art.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> So...does this mean things are going well?<br> Maybe that means now is a good time for a break?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Whoa, when did it get so late?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Hours ago, actually.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Hmm, good point.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Fujimaru, you haven&#39;t had dinner yet, have you?<br> Why don&#39;t you go do that now.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> And take your time. I mean it.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> In fact, why don&#39;t you go with [♂ him /♀ her], Mash?<br> You put off eating out of deference to us, yeah?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> O-okay, I&#39;ll do that. Let&#39;s go to the restaurant on the first floor, Senpai.</p><p><strong>Tamamo Cat:</strong><br> Well hi there. Two for dinner?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes please.</p><p><strong>Tamamo Cat:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Tamamo Cat:</strong><br> I&#39;m sorry, [♂ Mr. /♀ Ms.] Bags-Under-[♂ His /♀ Her]-Eyes,<br> but the whole restaurant is reserved today!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> But, there&#39;s no one here!</p><p><strong>Tamamo Cat:</strong></p><p>Don&#39;t just look with your eyes!</p><p><strong>Tamamo Cat:</strong><br> But anyway, I didn&#39;t let that stop me from making some jelly do–I mean, rice balls and such.</p><p><strong>Tamamo Cat:</strong><br> I&#39;ve got a bunch of different kinds, including spam! Ever had rice balls with spam before? Way better than you&#39;d think.</p><p><strong>Tamamo Cat:</strong><br> Most of our carbs for the next three days are gonna come from bread, so it&#39;s nice to mix it up a little, you know?</p><p><strong>Tamamo Cat:</strong><br> Why don&#39;t you take them down to the beach and have a nice, relaxing meal there? You might just find some new ideas out there!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Okay, we will.<br> Thank you so much for the food, Cat.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Come on Senpai, let&#39;s go find somewhere to eat down by the water!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> So we take one, two, three steps after leaving the restaurant...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...and here we are.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Man, that&#39;s really nice.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes, it is.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> If we feel like going to the ocean for a change of pace, all we have to do is step out the door!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Then let&#39;s dig in!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Okay.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Here, have some mineral water, Senpai.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The stars are beautiful, aren&#39;t they.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Yeah... And not just them...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong></p><p>!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Oh, sorry, never mind. It&#39;s nothing.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> You&#39;re right, though.<br> This place is like paradise.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> So&#39;s the sea.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes. Very much so.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Although, I also find the Luluhawan sea a little scary at night. It almost feels like the darkness and the water are blending together...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Oh, right. Shall we have our rice balls now, Senpai?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> They look yummy.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> That they do.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Mmm, they are delicious!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Hmm, mine is a little...sour?<br> Wait, make that a lot sour!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> That&#39;s the pickled plum.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I see...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It&#39;s a much more pervasive sourness than, say, a lemon.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I&#39;ve read that these picked plums are soothing to upset stomachs. It was very considerate of Cat to include them in these rice balls.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> All that aside...things certainly have gotten strange here.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Between the Singularity, ServantFes, forming a club, and making a doujin...not to mention that mysterious Foreigner...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...well, I can&#39;t think of a better word for it than “messy.”</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> At least it&#39;s nice and quiet now...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Huh?<br> Are those...chickens?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Gah, so loud!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Way to ruin the moment!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I guess we&#39;ll have to finish our rice balls later, Master.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Right now, we need to take care of these enemies. For some reason, they remind me of an author Servant whose night is day and day is night!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> (Munch, munch...) Oh, I know what this one is.<br> It&#39;s salmon.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Be funny if Fionn caught it for Cat to cook.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Ooh... Maybe it&#39;ll make me wiser then.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I got shrimp and mayonnaise myself.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Are the shrimp very fresh here in Luluhawa? They certainly look better than the ones at Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Come to think of it, this is the first time we&#39;ve gone on a real trip rather than a Rayshift, isn&#39;t it.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> This isn&#39;t just a simulation. This is a real beach,<br> in the real tropics...and here we are...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I&#39;m glad this Singularity happened in Hawaii.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Master...let&#39;s not lose focus.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Remember, once we&#39;ve defeated the Foreigner, and hopefully completed our book in time for ServantFes...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...it&#39;ll be time for us to go back to Chaldea. We shouldn&#39;t forget that part of our mission, Senpai.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Hehe.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> We&#39;re actually on vacation.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Y-yes, I suppose you&#39;re right.<br> Hearing you say it like that...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...it really does make me feel...like we&#39;re on vacation...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I mean, I suppose putting on a swimsuit will have that effect, but still...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Before was a race...and before that, a desert island.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> No matter what strange things happen,<br> we always find a way to enjoy ourselves in summer.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Someday, when you look back on this long and arduous battle...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...I hope you&#39;ll remember the fun times as much as the bad ones.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...And I hope I&#39;m not imposing on you by sharing that, either.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Not at all.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That&#39;s a relief...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Thank you, Mash.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Not at all. I&#39;m the one who should be thanking you.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Well, shall we head back to the hotel?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Alter should be just about finished by now.</p><p><strong>C：???:</strong><br> Heh...</p><p><strong>C：???:</strong><br> It seems my accomplice is still yet to realize...</p><p><strong>C：???:</strong><br> ...that unprecedented danger is headed towards Luluhawa...</p><p><strong>C：???:</strong></p><p>Unprecedented!</p><p><strong>C：???:</strong></p><p>Danger!</p><p><strong>C：???:</strong><br> Hehe...<br> Kuhahahaha...</p><p><strong>Nezha:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Nezha:</strong><br> Silence is.

The muse might just descend while we do.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> ...I guess you&#39;ve got a point.

Then you&#39;re saying I could&#39;ve gotten away with asking for Fluffy Bucks instead of Gil Bucks!? Sweet! I&#39;ll have to try that next time!</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> All that aside, I was absolutely earnest about wanting you all to have a photo, though.</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> Between Ms. Mash, Little Ushiwaka (a little scary),<br> and Lady Alter (a lot scary)...</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> ...this beautiful street just pales in comparison!</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> You are like fireworks!

She means business! The longer you take, the more she&#39;s gonna turn Main Street into Pain Street!</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> So finish that evil Foreigner off for good!<br> There&#39;s not a moment to lose!</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Evil Foreigner...?<br> ...? ...???</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> ...Exactly!<br> All Foreigners.

I installed the Hawaiian goddess Pele&#39;s Divine Core...</p><p><strong>E：BB Pele:</strong><br> ...and now, I&#39;m BB Pele!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Pele...!<br> As, in the Hawaiian version of Ishtar!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> That&#39;s a super apt way to put it.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Nice analogy, Mash!</p><p><strong>E：BB Pele:</strong><br> Yup!

As I&#39;m sure you all know,<br> Pele&#39;s the goddess of Hawaii&#39;s volcanoes.</p><p><strong>BB Pele:</strong><br> She&#39;s named for both the holy land, Pele-honua-mea,<br> and the eater of the land, Pele-ai-honua.</p><p><strong>BB Pele:</strong><br> I met her about a month ago when I was scoping out Hawaii as a possible ServantFes venue, and we hit it off right away.</p><p><strong>BB Pele:</strong><br> But she was pretty weak &#39;cause of...reasons, so I copied her Divine Core and installed it in myself.</p><p><strong>BB Pele:</strong><br> And that is the story of how I got this great tan!</p><p><strong>BB Pele:</strong><br> The rest, as you all know, is history.</p><p><strong>BB Pele:</strong><br> I used the authority over Hawaii I&#39;d borrowed to make the Luluhawa Singularity...</p><p><strong>BB Pele:</strong><br> ...and went on to hold ServantFes, where tourists and Servants both can enjoy themselves freely!</p><p><strong>BB Pele:</strong><br> Oh, something else about Pele–</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Ugh, that&#39;s enough exposition. I got it already.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> I would&#39;ve thought you were Poliʻahu instead...but I guess this explains why you&#39;re on our side.</p><p><strong>E：BB:</strong><br> Oho, so you know about the snow goddess Poliʻahu, huh? You really did your homework, didn&#39;t you!</p><p><strong>E：BB:</strong><br> Anyway, I&#39;d love to properly reward you for all your help, but I&#39;ve got a bunch of buildings I need to fix up. You know how it is.</p><p><strong>E：BB:</strong><br> Only two days left until ServantFes now.<br> I can&#39;t wait to see the fruits of your labor☆</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Ugh... I&#39;d finally gotten the damn book offa my mind and she just had to drag me back to reality...</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Now, now, it will be all right. I&#39;ll help out too once we get back to the hotel. I&#39;ve become rather proficient at filling in inks these last few days.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> But first, some dinner. Once we&#39;ve had a break and some food, we can put our noses back to the grindstone.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Any project&#39;ll get done eventually as long as you keep working at it. You&#39;ve just gotta find a pace that works for you, Alty.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Alty...? Wha... No. Hell no!

I get how you all feel, but since I&#39;m the manager here, I gotta give it to you straight.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> We need to give up on the idea that we&#39;re going to finish this book in time to send it to the printer, and settle for photocopies of what we have right now.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Personally, I think that&#39;s the best we can do at this point in time. Any objections?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Ow, ow, ow.

Photocopies are fine.<br> Just did this for fun, anyway.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> ...I mean, it sucks that we couldn&#39;t finish, but at least this&#39;ll be better than sending an unfinished draft to the printer.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> What about you, Robin?<br> Aren&#39;t you worried about turning into a pig?</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Nope. BB said we need to “make” a book,<br> and the way I see it, photocopies count just fine.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Besides, we all did our best to draw it, so there&#39;s no way it&#39;s gonna turn out badly, photocopy or not.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Considering this was our first time doing anything like this, I&#39;d say we more than made the grade.

See, I kind of forgot that I&#39;d made a promise with Pele...</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> And now, I can&#39;t get back to the way I was...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I don&#39;t understand. Did Medb make a bad wish?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Maybe something that resulted in another Singularity...?</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> No, I wouldn&#39;t be held responsible if she did,<br> so I couldn&#39;t care less about that.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Just this once, I want the Holy Grail to be used for something good. Both for Hawaii&#39;s sake, and my own.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> ...You want to see it used for good?<br> Bullshit. What&#39;s really going on here?</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Well, you all remember XX the Foreigner? See, she actually already defeated Pele, which made her lose all of her power.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> She had nowhere else to go, so I ended up taking her in–literally–and gaining Authority over Luluhawa.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Pele? The symbol of Kilauea herself?</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> That&#39;s...quite the predicament.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Yes, it is. Pele is still all but powerless now.<br> She&#39;s practically a dead goddess walking.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> The only thing that can save her now is faith, and magical energy resources that want peace for Hawaii.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> So I came up with the idea to use the ServantFes attendees&#39; passion to make a Holy Grail.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> From there, I just needed someone with a good heart to use it.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Someone who wouldn&#39;t make a selfish wish,<br> but one that would bring peace back to Hawaii.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Now I get it!<br> So that&#39;s why you wanted Senpai to win!</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Exactly. I wanted Senpai to sell the most books and claim the Holy Grail for [♂ himself /♀ herself].</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> But instead, you all got so caught up in sightseeing that you neglected your bookmaking duties.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> And because of that, Medb ended up winning ServantFes, and now I can&#39;t bring Pele back to life.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Mm-hmm. How decent of you.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> What&#39;s that supposed to mean?<br> When have I not been a decent and helpful kouhai?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> So this is all to resurrect Pele?</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Yep! I mean, she&#39;s definitely got her share of problems, but she&#39;s still Hawaii&#39;s guardian deity.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> No good can come to humanity by letting her stay dead at that Foreigner&#39;s hands.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> I see. So that is why you&#39;re in charge of Luluhawa.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> If you&#39;d just told us all this in the first place,<br> we&#39;d have taken our bookmaking more seriously.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Sorry! Those were just my irrepressible mischievous tendencies at work♡ I always wanted to see a human running around like a chicken with its head cut off☆</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Anyway, allow me to sum up, Senpai and friends!</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> What I want from you, Fujimaru,<br> is to give up your wish.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Do you think you can throw away your chance to use the Holy Grail for yourself if it will help others?</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Of course, I know my Senpai, and I have every confidence you&#39;ll do the right thing!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Well, if doing that will help Pele...</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> That&#39;s my Senpai for you! I knew you&#39;d understand!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I get it, I get it.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Do you, Senpai? Left to your own devices, you seem like you&#39;d spend all your resort time goofing off.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> So now what?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> What exactly do you want us to wish on the Holy Grail? Do we ask it to save Pele or something?</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Nope! I want you to use it at Kilauea,<br> and wish for world peace.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> At its core, a Holy Grail is really just a big ball of energy, so that should restore Hawaii&#39;s leyline.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> And that in turn should help Pele regain her power.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> ...Yeah, I guess that makes sense.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> All right then, I&#39;ll be waiting for you at the Mauna Kea Observatories on the seventh night of your trip!</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Make sure to come find me after you use the Holy Grail to save Pele!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Got it.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> You mean you&#39;re not going to help!?</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> I wish I could, I really do,<br> but I&#39;ve got my hands full running ServantFes.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> I would&#39;ve liked to just be a regular attendee myself, but...</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Well, let&#39;s just say my plans were changed rather suddenly. Please don&#39;t pry further, okay, Senpai?</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Oh, and while I&#39;m sure this goes without saying, juuust in case: no getting first place by going around telling everyone you went back in time. &#39;Kay?</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> If you do, Robin&#39;s–</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Yeah, yeah, you&#39;ll be making bacon out of my backside. I get it already!</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Not exactly. Since this is your second loop, I&#39;ll make you into a statue instead! You&#39;ll end up the spitting image of the king of Luluhawa!</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> How the hell&#39;d you come up with that twisted idea!?</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Hey now, it&#39;s not twisted. It&#39;s a warped sign of how much I love and respect you!</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Anyway, enjoy your endless Luluhawa vacation! Remember, it won&#39;t stop looping until you take first place at ServantFes☆</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Look, Master. Over there.</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> Oro? Is that Master I see there?<br> Are you here for ServantFes too?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Quick! How many days until ServantFes!?</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> Six and counting!</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> I see you&#39;re just as excited as I am!</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> I&#39;d already be lined up at the convention center if King Buckethead hadn&#39;t booted me for loitering!</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> So for now, I&#39;m just gonna chill on the beach and creep–err, take in Medb and her bikini.</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> I mean, yeah, she&#39;ll definitely kill me if she sees me, but at least I&#39;ll die happy, doing what I love.</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> Besides, if there&#39;s one thing I&#39;ve learned,<br> it&#39;s that they can&#39;t arrest you for thought crimes!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Yup, that&#39;s Blackbeard all right.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes. We can definitely rule out the possibility that this is all just a simulation.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Which means...we really did go back in time.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Damn, BB... We&#39;re not even in a digital world.<br> How&#39;d she pull that off in real life?</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> Excuse me? Why am I getting dragged into some goofy sci-fi plot right now?</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Master, I propose a test. Cutting off his head would give us the answers we seek.</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong></p><p>...What answers, exactly?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Ushiwakamaru, I think all that would teach us is one way to kill Blackbeard.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> ...<br> ...Huh?</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Hey, Master, if we&#39;re back to our first day,<br> shouldn&#39;t Ibaraki be here too?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Now that you mention it...</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Seeing as she did not spend any time with us last time, I do not imagine her absence will be of any particular importance this time, either.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Yeah, guess you&#39;ve got a point there.<br> (Not like we could count on her to help much anyway.)</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Either way, we know what we have to do: draw some manga and take first place! That much hasn&#39;t changed!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> We can do this, Fujimaru. ...My whole reason for–no, whole purpose in doing this to begin with is coming back to me!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> If BB&#39;s gonna make us do it over until we get it right, then I say we take advantage of the opportunity to make the best damn doujin ever!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> This time, we&#39;re gonna finish it, and I&#39;m gonna prove I can do better than that book I–Oh, right, I almost forgot.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Hey, Blackbeard, you got a hotel room you don&#39;t want, right? Give it. We have a doujin to make.</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> You? A doujin? You think a bunch of amateurs are just going to waltz into ServantFes and–</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> ...No, wait. You really mean it, don&#39;t you?<br> I can tell Master&#39;s seen some serious shit.</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> Clearly, there&#39;s more to this than meets the eye.</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> Maybe you&#39;ve secretly been selling ten years&#39;<br> worth of otaku merch just to come to ServantFes?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I can&#39;t go into specifics, but we&#39;re serious about winning ServantFes.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> One tragic tale like that is more than enough...</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> ...Heh. I still remember when you were bowled over by PaiKet, and now look at you...</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> All right then, if you&#39;re looking to become the [♂ King /♀ Queen] of ServantFes, then go ahead and take this room!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Thanks, we will. ...By the way,<br> why&#39;d you choose this hotel anyway?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> If the last week has shown me anything, it&#39;s that you&#39;re a damn sight more calculating than you seem.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> So, why this particular hotel?<br> Just &#39;cause it has a room available?</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> Ehehe, just means you noobs still have a lot to learn.</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> Try knocking on your neighbor&#39;s door after you check in. Trust me.</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> According to my research, that&#39;s where you&#39;ll find a certain batty princess who should be a big help.</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> The best way for a noob to get good is to make friends with the masters of the craft.</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> Me, I&#39;m a reader, not a creator,<br> so that advice is the best I can do for you.</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> All right, looking forward to seeing what you come up with! Save me a copy of your doujin!</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> Farewell!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> No kidding. So Little Miss Doujin was in the room next door all along...</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Let&#39;s go, everyone.<br> We&#39;re not gonna waste a single damn day this time!</p><h2 id="under-the-blue-sky-work-to-the-bone" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#under-the-blue-sky-work-to-the-bone" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Under the Blue Sky, Work to the Bone</h2><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> 　　　　　　—　　Day 1　　Hotel Check-In　　—</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> You&#39;ve already seen this bit, so let&#39;s just go ahead and hit the old “Skip” button, shall we?</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Well, here we are, back in the same room.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> I must say, it felt almost comforting to check in here for the first time again.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> We can rest up later.<br> First, we&#39;re paying a visit next door.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> ...It&#39;s not time yet.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I&#39;ve still got six days until ServantFes.<br> Six whole days. That&#39;s almost a whole week.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> And thankfully, I know I can make a decent book before it begins, even if I do end up sending it to the printer at the last minute.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Even if I have to use mysterious powers to do it!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> So it&#39;s okay to be stuck on the rough draft for now. Really. This is fine.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> All right. So it&#39;s pencils, outlining, inking, whitening, tone...and then...and then...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> No, wait, don&#39;t get ahead of yourself. You need to get the draft done first. That&#39;s what&#39;s important.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> ...<br> ...Crap, I&#39;m two pages over...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Now what do I do?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> The more I fret, the more time I lose.<br> The more time I lose, the more the quality slips.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> And the more the quality slips, the more I fret.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Oh God! No, forget God! I&#39;d make a deal with the Devil at this point! Won&#39;t somebody please help meee!?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Open up!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> ...That was when it happened.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> My door opened, and a fallen saint in a swimsuit appeared before me.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Huh? Who&#39;re...<br> Master!? What are you doing in my room!?</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Ch-chotto a minute!<br> Don&#39;t look at my face! Just go away! Get out!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> We&#39;re not going anywhere!</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong></p><p>Who–!?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> I&#39;m Jeanne d&#39;Arc, and I have some questions for you.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Huh? Jeanne d&#39;Arc? But, I&#39;ve seen her around the hotel a few times...</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Isn&#39;t she the elegant, graceful holy maiden who&#39;s always wearing white?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> No, you&#39;re, uh, thinking of a different Servant.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> (Hmm. I can see I&#39;m better off dropping this subject. Woo, go me.)</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Okay, so...what did you want to ask me, Jeannie?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Well, you see...</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> ...Hmm, I see, I see.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Osakabehime.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Does Lady Alter&#39;s request not enrage you?</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> I mean, who is this upstart intruding in your room and saying she wishes to draw comics without any prior experience doing so?</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> It is like a young man showing up out of nowhere, declaring himself a general, and demanding to be given an army to command.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Well, sure, it definitely comes across as a little...arrogant?</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> If I were in your shoes, I would take advantage of the confusion to cut off her head when she wasn&#39;t looking.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Well, I&#39;m no master wordsmith like, say, Andersen or Shakespeare. I&#39;m still just an amateur myself.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Maybe we&#39;re both underestimating each other.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> I&#39;m not underestimating you.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> It&#39;s just...now that I know she drew this manga,<br> I want to make one that&#39;s even better. A lot better.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Oh! (That&#39;s the book I saw in my dream...)</p><p><strong>E：Robin Hood:</strong><br> Huh? What&#39;s that all about? You never breathed a word of that the first time around.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> I kept it to myself because it was my problem to deal with, not yours. But now, I&#39;m not holding anything back!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> We all have to take first place at ServantFes now, so it&#39;s better to have a simple, clear-cut goal to shoot for, right?</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Hmm.<br> Let me see that.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> ...?<br> ...!?</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> ”#%”TBHEY$#Y”$#%!?<br> `=*=&amp;$#H%E$Y#”!!!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Wh-what&#39;s wrong with you!?</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> This manga&#39;s sugocool!</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> I mean, it&#39;s clearly a doujin!<br> That much is obvious!</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> But I get a sense of a professional at work from this, on par with any veteran!</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> The artist has an incredible sense for their craft,<br> but it still gives off a sense of amateurishness!</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> And above all, it just...kira kiras!</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> It&#39;s...like it&#39;s captured the beauty of the world free of artifice or adornment!</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Whoever drew this is...is...an absolute tensai!<br> Heaven-sent!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Hmph. I knew it had to be her.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> I don&#39;t know much about this Jeanne,<br> but you say she&#39;s the one who drew this?</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> If she did, I&#39;m super impressed. No wonder it sold more than any other doujin when it came out.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> ...And now you want to surpass it, Jeannie?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Yeah, I do.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> ...Well, just so you know, beating this is gonna be really hard, especially for a beginner.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Just taking a good shot at this is going to take way more work than you think. I&#39;m talking absolutely bonkers levels of dedication.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> You do get that, right?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> ...Yeah, I get that. I&#39;ve already gotten a taste of how much work making a doujin is.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> I see. Okay then, you can borrow the drawing tools I&#39;ve been using.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> I can teach you the basic fundamentals of what goes into this, so I want you to try doing it for yourself.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> At this point, you don&#39;t have the drawing skills or the artistic sense to even compete with something like this, let alone surpass it.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> But, you&#39;re a Servant, and you&#39;ve got six days to work with. So do your best to make a miracle happen.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> ...Yeah. Yeah! You damn well better believe I will!</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Okay then, listen up. I&#39;ve got plenty of advice for you, but one thing is more important than any other!</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> You might be a super beginner, but you have one thing no mangaka–not even the one who made this doujin–can match!</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Passion.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> You want to draw a great doujin more than anything, right? So hold on to that desire.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Because if you ditch that, all you&#39;ll have is your skills and your craft.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> And the only people who can draw doujin on skill and craft alone are the pros.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> And since neither you nor I are pros,<br> that means we gotta stick to our passion!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> ...I just refuse to lose to her. That&#39;s it.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I&#39;d say you&#39;re pretty passionate about that.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Master&#39;s exactly right.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> All you need to do is point that competitive streak towards mastering manga and you&#39;ll be set.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> First things first. Let&#39;s start by getting our basics down.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Yeah, yeah. I know. Don&#39;t worry...<br> My doujin is gonna blow hers outta the water.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Master, you&#39;ll be helping as one of her assistants too, right?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Of course. This isn&#39;t my first rode–uh, doujin.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Damn straight [♂ he /♀ she] will. You never know what&#39;s gonna come out of [♂ his /♀ her] mouth. [♂ He&#39;s /♀ She&#39;s] got a real talent for coming up with story ideas.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Really? I never would have guessed... I didn&#39;t think you were interested in that sort of thing, Master.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Anyway, you can never have too many capable assistants. Um, you said you were staying next door, right?</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Good. Help me carry this stuff over so I can set up a space for myself.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> You&#39;re going to help too, Osakabehime? We certainly appreciate it, but are you sure you don&#39;t mind?</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Nope! Your timing was perfect! I was just looking for a little inspiration myself.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> And there&#39;s nothing like being in the same room as other hardworking artists to get you fired up! Now let&#39;s draw some mangaaa!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Yeah, let&#39;s get drawing!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> We&#39;ll help too, of course!</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Indeed. Now that I&#39;ve changed into a swimsuit,<br> my Spirit Origin is polished and ready to go!</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> In fact, it&#39;s so polished, I feel as if I&#39;ve returned to my youthful days of training on Mt. Kurama!</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Okay Master, just tell me what you need! In fact, why don&#39;t I start by finding a demon and bringing you its head in celebration?</p><p><strong>E：Robin Hood:</strong><br> Well, now that this ship&#39;s already sailed,<br> I wanna do what I can to take BB down a peg or ten.</p><p><strong>E：Robin Hood:</strong><br> So I&#39;m gonna start taking this manager position more seriously than ever. Don&#39;t say I didn&#39;t warn you.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Hah, you&#39;re all even more fired up than I am! Damn, even in Luluhawa, you&#39;re still just a buncha chumps!</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Oh, Senpai! This is about the time on our first day here when the–</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> That&#39;s right! The Foreigner! This is when the Foreigner shows up at Waikiki Street!</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Foreigner? Is that another name for the crafts festival being held the day before ServantFes begins? The Wonder Stage?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> No. Nothing like that. This is just some crazy trying to ruin everyone&#39;s fun.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> I dunno what her problem with ServantFes is, but she keeps trying to wreck the convention center.</p><p><strong>G：Robin Hood:</strong><br> Yeah we can fill her in about all that later!<br> Remember, dealing with this is part of our job, too!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Right...! Let&#39;s go ask XX to go back home!</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong><br> Aah! Toto-sama!? You already bit the dust!?</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong><br> Wait. Crap. I think I&#39;m getting dizzy too...!<br> Hey, you! Who the hell do ya think you are!?</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> None of your business! Die, Foreigner!</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong></p><p>Aaaaaaaaahhh!</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> You&#39;ve already seen how this goes,<br> so let&#39;s just hit the old “Skip” button, shall we?</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> That&#39;s a Foreigner...?</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> To think the Servant world was so horrid! That there could be anything worse than Mecha Eli-chan.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Um, can you actually beat her? She&#39;s got, like...laser beams and vulcan cannons!</p><p><strong>G：Robin Hood:</strong><br> That&#39;s true... We&#39;ve given her a good fight every time but we&#39;ve never really defeated her before.</p><p><strong>G：Robin Hood:</strong><br> It&#39;d be way easier to focus on our doujin if we could take her out sooner, but I don&#39;t see how to do that...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> We&#39;ll have to figure that out another time. The good part is that now we know exactly when and where she&#39;ll be showing up.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> And there&#39;s no reason we shouldn&#39;t be able to drive her off again, like we did last time.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Yeah. And since we pretty much gotta fight her on the last day anyway, let&#39;s just forget her for now.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> The only thing we need to be focusing on right now is our doujin.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Especially now that we&#39;ve got Osakabehime here to show us the ropes.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> This time, we&#39;re damn sure gonna finish in time to send it to the printer!

How did you end up all the way here? This isn&#39;t the kind of place you can just wander into...</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Hm? That voice...

It totally does, if I do say so myself!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever seen her look so proud before.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Ibaraki?

I&#39;m an oni!</p><p><strong>C：Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> What other reason could I possibly need to go on a rampage?

Nothing.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> We only just formed our club recently, so...we&#39;ve been very caught up trying to get our book done.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> In that case, I&#39;ll tell you what I know about the other clubs.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> Or, to put it another way, about the people you&#39;ll be competing against! Your potential friendly rivals!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> No thanks. I&#39;m not here to make friends.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> You stop that. I don&#39;t want to hear you being so confrontational.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Tch...</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Hmm, I feel as though I&#39;m watching a squabble between two sis–Mmf, mmf.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Shhh!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> I can hear you, you know!</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> Hehe.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> ...All right, let&#39;s start with the literary club, Grown-Up Fairy Tales. It&#39;s run by Shakespeare and Andersen.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> They&#39;ve been around for a long time, as you can imagine. I&#39;ve heard they occasionally bring in guests.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> I&#39;ve got it!</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> We&#39;ll go with a tragedy this year.<br> I&#39;ve even got a title: “The Pitiful Elephant King.”</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong><br> Hmm. I take it this will be one of those<br> “based on a true story” types?</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> That&#39;s right. I even know how to begin it...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Once upon a time, there was a poor elephant forced to eat poisoned food during wartime.</p><p><strong>Ivan the Terrible:</strong><br> This is delicious.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> But, it had no effect on him.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong><br> Hahaha! What&#39;s Ivan the Terrible doing in prison!?</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> Hahaha! How should I know!?</p><p><strong>Both:</strong><br> Waaahahaha!</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong><br> ...Shall we get back to writing?</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> Yeah, I guess we should.<br> Dammit, I can&#39;t seem to come up with a snappy line!</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> Then there&#39;s Tentacle Iron Bar.<br> They made a huge splash when they debuted last year.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Tentacle...?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Iron Bar...?</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> Y-yes, that&#39;s right. Katsushika Hokusai made it.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> If I had to bet, I would put money on her releasing the winning entry. The only downside is her work is so good that it tends not to catch on with the general public.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> Although...I heard a rumor that Hokusai has gone missing... I hope she&#39;s all right.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> The next club is called The One Thousand and One Night Offerings Collective.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> I heard the Caster of Storytelling comes up with the stories, and Nitocris turns them into manga.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> They&#39;ve been around for a long time,<br> even before Nitocris joined them...</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> ...and I hear they&#39;ve got a number of hardcore fans who can&#39;t wait to see what happens next.</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> Okay, I&#39;m done with this episode!<br> Lord Medjed, you handle the inking!</p><p><strong>E：:</strong><br> Um...do you think we could take a break soon...?<br> I&#39;m worried about dying from overwork...</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> Don&#39;t be ridiculous!<br> We still have a ton of stories left to cover!</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> Oh, Lord Medjed, I&#39;m afraid you&#39;re filling outside the lines. Would you mind doing it over? Thanks!</p><p><strong>E：:</strong><br> Also, Nitocris...?</p><p><strong>E：:</strong><br> If you don&#39;t stand up soon, you&#39;re going to die from deep vein thrombosis.</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> All right, all right, I got it.</p><p><strong>E：:</strong><br> Phew, that does feel better...</p><p><strong>E：:</strong><br> (I still don&#39;t understand why she&#39;s asking Lord Medjed for help... But it&#39;s probably best I keep that to myself.)</p><p><strong>E：:</strong><br> (...Besides, it&#39;s rather amusing to see her like this.)</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> And then there&#39;s the club that&#39;s been around forever: Osakabehime and Kiyohime&#39;s Princess Princess.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Yes, yes, yes!<br> I&#39;m churning out pages like there&#39;s no tomorrow!</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Arigathanks, Jeannie!</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> That story you showed me has seriously done wonders for my motivation!</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> Why were you so uninspired before, anyway?</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> ...Our club name.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> Our club name? What&#39;s wrong with our club name?</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> It&#39;s been ages since we went with Princess Princess, since we both have princess characters in our name.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> Is there something wrong with that?</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> ...It&#39;s embarrassing to still call ourselves that now that all these actual European princesses are popping up left and right!</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> Hmm... You think?</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> I mean, when you get right down to it, we&#39;re not actually princesses at all! We&#39;re barely even royalty!</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> Oh, I don&#39;t agree with that. I&#39;m a princess because I feel like one. That&#39;s all I need.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Must be nice being you...</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> Please don&#39;t flatter me.<br> You&#39;re going to make me blush...</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> I was being sarcastic!</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> Anyway, we still have half the book left to complete.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> Why don&#39;t we make a high school romance story?<br> Between Master and me!</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> No, sorry... You have to tread much more carefully when dealing with real people. Besides, that sort of thing&#39;s a textbook example of a slippery slope...</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> Hmph.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Pout all you want. No means no!</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> Those are just the ones I know about. I&#39;m sure there are others creating works in all sorts of genres.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> You might find some of them if you explore more of Luluhawa.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> Just attending ServantFes is a lot of fun in its own right, but there&#39;s nothing quite like presenting a book you made with your own hands.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> Oh, right.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> As a Ruler, I can&#39;t let this Foreigner that showed up last night run around doing whatever she pleases.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> Er, never mind that I&#39;m an Archer now,<br> thanks to my swimsuit changing my Spirit Origin.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> Anyway, once I find her, I&#39;m going to kick...er, I mean, beat her black and...no, no, defeat her once and for all! Yeah, that&#39;s it!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Heh. Get it now, Fujimaru? This is the real Jeanne.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> A cold-blooded killer masquerading as a paragon of love.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> That is not true.<br> I only practice self-defense.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> By which you mean, the best defense is a strong offense, right?</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> Well, yes. Isn&#39;t that normal in war?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Told ya!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> (She looks so happy...)</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Whatever you&#39;re thinking, stop. I don&#39;t like it.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> (They really are like sisters...)</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> We&#39;re sisters, and we love each other!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong></p><p>You shut your mouth!</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> As for me, I&#39;m planning to draw a dolphin love story!</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> I can&#39;t wait to see your book when you&#39;re finished, Alter. Make sure you save me a copy!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> ...F-fine. When you&#39;re done reading my book,<br> you won&#39;t know what hit you!</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> Great! I can&#39;t wait!</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> ...Just when you think there&#39;s hope for these two,<br> you realize how incredibly different they are.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> True. They remind me of my brother and Lady Masako.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> ...Hm? Oh, hey, Tamamo Cat.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Say, I haven&#39;t seen the man in red lately.<br> Where&#39;d he get to?</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> I figured he&#39;d be here cooking up a storm in the kitchen...</p><p><strong>Tamamo Cat:</strong><br> If you&#39;re looking for the handsome guy in the red coat, I think the Drama Queen and Tamamo Alter (*normal Tamamo) took him away.</p><p><strong>Tamamo Cat:</strong><br> Something about starting up an Extra club, I think?<br> I wasn&#39;t paying much attention.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Welp... Guess he&#39;s abducted now.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong><br> Indeed, he is.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong><br> I am told they mean to form a club and publish a book under the name Moonside Etcetera.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Huh. Well, I guess they&#39;ll pull something together as long as he&#39;s around.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong><br> I am not so sure.

Why do we have to fight!?</p><p><strong>Gorgeous P:</strong><br> Why, you say?</p><p><strong>Gorgeous P:</strong><br> Because that is what Servants do when they encounter each other, of course.</p><p><strong>d&#39;Eon:</strong><br> I apologize on behalf of my employer.</p><p><strong>d&#39;Eon:</strong><br> But you must understand, printing a book on the day of the con is a fairly difficult endeavor for us.</p><p><strong>d&#39;Eon:</strong><br> It is not simply a matter of being able to afford it.</p><p><strong>d&#39;Eon:</strong><br> We want to print books into which the creators have poured their heart and souls.</p><p><strong>d&#39;Eon:</strong><br> That is why we want you to show us how strong your resolve is. Are you prepared to do that?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> What do you think?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> We accept. We were gonna have to “negotiate” with the printer eventually anyway.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> So let&#39;s show them just how serious we are about this.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Can you do this?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> You better believe it.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> We&#39;re gonna show them exactly how serious we are about this!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Bring it, you bourgeois punks!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Gorgeous P:</strong><br> Hmm...

I now understand just how dedicated you are to your work!</p><p><strong>Gorgeous P:</strong><br> It does seem that the key creative figure among you is still harboring some delusions...but that is no less valid a creative method than others.</p><p><strong>Gorgeous P:</strong><br> So suffer for your art!<br> Fight for your art!</p><p><strong>Gorgeous P:</strong><br> Mongrels though you may be, no doubt you can still produce something beautiful if you master what talents you have!</p><p><strong>Gorgeous P:</strong><br> I hereby grant you permission to make use of my printing facilities!</p><p><strong>Gorgeous P:</strong><br> Fuhahahaha!<br> Hahahahaha!</p><p><strong>Gorgeous P:</strong><br> Now, d&#39;Eon, let us be on our way.<br> Today, we&#39;re having dinner at the Ritz penthouse.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> One last thing.</p><p><strong>Gorgeous P:</strong><br> Very well, what is it?<br> ...Hm?

She&#39;s a goddess of civilization who granted fire to the people, and she&#39;s also a goddess of destruction who took that same civilization away.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> And just like Hawaii&#39;s volcanoes are still active,<br> Pele still lives on in Kilauea.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Although...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Although?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> ...Nah, it&#39;s nothing. I&#39;ll tell you some other time.<br> Right now, we need to focus on work!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Yeah, you&#39;re right.

We&#39;ve been doing nothing but work and sleep ever since yesterday.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Why don&#39;t we go to the beach, Master? A little dip in the ocean should help you loosen up.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I&#39;ll go with you then.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> I think I&#39;ll join too. I&#39;m sure you&#39;re fine with Ushiwakamaru around, but in my role as Hawaii Hood, I&#39;d feel better keeping an eye on things just in case.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Sweet dreams, Jeanne Alter.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> ...Yeah.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> See you later then.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Yeah, yeah.

There seems to be quite a commotion over there...</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou?</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Looks like a bunch of overworked men to me.<br> Maybe there&#39;s some kind of event happening today.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> I see they&#39;re not Servants.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Some of them look to be Lord Blackbeard&#39;s men,<br> while others are–</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Those are Celtic soldiers...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Then, that would mean–</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Hehe... You guys just can&#39;t take it anymore, huh? Didn&#39;t I tell you to wait here like good boys?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I knew it! It&#39;s Medb!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou fou!</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Great, her again.<br> Whatever it is she&#39;s doing here, it can&#39;t be good...</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Take a look around.<br> Beautiful beach, beautiful sea, beautiful sky...</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Starting to notice a theme by now? Maybe the word “beautiful” has started to lose all meaning?</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Well you&#39;re in luck! This queen&#39;s about to personally remind you who the word “beautiful” suits best!</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Rejoice, my poor little worker bees! Let me see you cry in joy at my unbridled generosity!</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Mmm, yes, that&#39;s the stuff! Now then...</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Announcing the Medb Contest!</p><p><strong>G：Medb:</strong><br> A Medb production brought to you by Medb, for Medb!</p><p><strong>Man A:</strong><br> You rock, Medb!<br> ...Wooo! I always wanted to say that!</p><p><strong>Man B:</strong><br> Here&#39;s this month&#39;s tribute! I risked life and limb to bring it back for you from the Bering Sea!</p><p><strong>Man C:</strong><br> Look this way, Your Majestyyy!<br> Please! I&#39;ll do anything you want!</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong></p><p>The hell is this!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Well, knowing Medb...I can&#39;t say I&#39;m too surprised that she&#39;d do something like this...</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Never mind that now! Take a look at that!</p><p><strong>P.A. System:</strong><br> That was Entry No. 1: the strong, noble, adorable,<br> and unquestionably beautiful Medb!</p><p><strong>P.A. System:</strong><br> Thank you, Medb! Thank you for these irreplaceable summer memories!</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Heh... Never mind summer. You&#39;re gonna want to remember those for the rest of your lives.</p><p><strong>P.A. System:</strong><br> Now, let&#39;s move on to the scoring portion.<br> What say you, Judgment Boys!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>10.0　　　 　　10.0　　　　　　10.0　　　　　　10.0</p><p><strong>P.A. System:</strong><br> Unbelievable! It&#39;s a perfect score! Medb&#39;s invincible! She&#39;s mythical! She&#39;s a living legend of beauty! Nobody else even comes close!</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Oh my, this is so expected! What can I say? I can&#39;t help that I&#39;m just so gorgeous! Sorry not sorry!</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> What a farce! They&#39;re all obviously in cahoots... Or rather, they&#39;re all even bigger idiots than she is!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou fo kyu, fou fou!<br> ...Fou, fou fou...</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Yeah. She admitted it when she said it was all made by her, for her. No way this is on the up-and-up.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> If it were only a question of her embarrassing herself, we could simply ignore this self-serving exercise in shamelessness. But the problem is...</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> ...her ability to get all these men so worked up. Remember, our fate rests on the popularity contest that is ServantFes.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> The more she gains from this travesty,<br> the more we stand to lose.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> As such, I believe it would behoove us to stop it before it goes too far, Master!</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Oh...? I thought I smelled some horrendous yokel from out in the sticks. If it isn&#39;t the mountain mutt, coming to play in civilization.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Did you really not know that beautiful people get more votes? It&#39;s like a law of nature.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Do you ever shut up? You remind me of nothing so much as a hapless cow, stranded on the shore, showing off her flabby flesh.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Is this some sort of barbecue? Are you trying to make amends for your many crimes by offering yourself to the grill?</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Hmph. I should&#39;ve known a dog wouldn&#39;t be able to stop herself from barking incessantly.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> I&#39;m not trying to drum up attention to give me an advantage at ServantFes. Why bother?</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> My photo book is going to sell more copies than anything else there no matter what!</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> This contest I whipped up is just a way to further spread the glory of my beauty throughout the world.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Don&#39;t be preposterous!<br> This is obviously a ploy to drive up sales!</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> You even came up with a fake quote for your ad copy: “Queen of the Beach, now Queen of the Books!”</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> How unspeakably rude. Fine then. If you&#39;ve got that much of a problem, why don&#39;t you compete?</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> You don&#39;t want me taking the crown when you don&#39;t think I deserve it, right? Then beat me.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> I&#39;m always happy to accept new entrants.<br> Unless...you don&#39;t think you&#39;re up to it?</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> You Japanese warriors don&#39;t like to fight battles you know you can&#39;t win? Just going to roll over and go belly-up like the cowardly dog you are?</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Ohhh, I get it. That&#39;s why you run around with your midriff exposed.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Gee, I&#39;m sorry. I should&#39;ve been more considerate of your well-deserved lack of confidence in your looks. Heh. Oh, I do hope you can forgive me?</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> ...!<br> Very well then, I accept your challenge!</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> You want to do this thing!?<br> We will do this thing!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> P-please calm down, Ushiwakamaru! There&#39;s no point in competing with Medb in her own contest!</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Worry not!</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> I am told that exposure is the greatest weapon of summer, and I am baring at least as much as she is!</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> I&#39;m not entirely sure why that is, but regardless,<br> I have the matter well in hand!</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Get a hold of yourself! The only contests where outfit design matters are French fashion ones!</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Your, uh, sporty good looks aren&#39;t gonna be nearly enough to win this thing!</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Save the lectures for later!<br> You are reminding me of my brother!</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> At this point, I am no longer Ushiwakamaru.<br> I am the Tengu Woman of the Beach!</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> In the name of Mt. Kurama,<br> I refuse to lose to city trash like that!</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Now, on to the swimsuit competition! You&#39;ve heard of a catwalk? Well, get ready for a tenguwalk!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>7.0　　　　　　8.5　　　　　　8.0　　　　　　9.0</p><p><strong>E：Man A:</strong><br> She&#39;s certainly very sporty, but...</p><p><strong>F：Man B:</strong><br> Yeah. She just doesn&#39;t have the same...flair that Medb does...</p><p><strong>G：Man C:</strong><br> We&#39;re at a beach resort, not an athletic meet. If we wanted to watch amazing physical feats, we&#39;d go to the summer games.</p><p><strong>H：Man D:</strong><br> ...She fits my type to a T, so normally, I&#39;d be all over that...but since we&#39;re in Luluhawa, I have to give it to Queen Medb this time.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Well, well. Color me impressed, Ushiwaka.<br> You did better than I thought you would.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> But hey, don&#39;t feel bad.<br> You could never have beaten beauty like mine!</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> In fact, you should be proud.<br> I thought you&#39;d be walking away with straight zeros!</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Grrr!</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> ...I mean, forget that! This so-called competition,<br> and the way it&#39;s scored, isn&#39;t the point at all!</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> The point is that holding it in the first place is wrong! As far as I can tell, you don&#39;t even have any other contestants.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> There&#39;s no point in holding a sad, meaningless contest like this where you&#39;re the only one competing and your victory is assured.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Oh? Who said I was the only one competing?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You mean you&#39;re not?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You mean you&#39;re not?</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Of course not.<br> Entry No. 3 and 4 will be along any moment.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Now, if you&#39;ll excuse me, I need to get back to my sponsor seat. Enjoy the show, everyone.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> My victory is definitely assured, but now it&#39;s going to be clinched after a white-hot battle with other contestants!</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Oh, but you won&#39;t be one of them, Fujimaru.<br> This contest&#39;s for Servants only.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> So stay on the sidelines where it&#39;s safe. Of course,<br> if you insist on being my rival, I won&#39;t stop you.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Well, I guess that makes sense. She&#39;s nothing if not supremely confident in her looks.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> She might not be above cheating in war, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;d even occur to her to cheat when it comes to a beauty contest.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Hmph, is that so? You certainly know a lot about her, don&#39;t you, Lord Robin?</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Nah, I&#39;m just observant.<br> Look, here they come.</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong><br> Oh my, this seems like fun.</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong><br> Oho. I take it this is some sort of battle to determine the queen of the beach...?</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> Did someone say “contest”? A contest means prizes, and in summer, prizes mean watermelon and shaved ice!</p><p><strong>Oda Nobunaga:</strong><br> What the hell kind of stage is that!? Wait a minute...<br> This is it! Hawaiian rock &#39;n&#39; roll legend, here I come!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It&#39;s the other swimsuit Servants!<br> They&#39;re all here too!</p><p><strong>P.A. System:</strong><br> Attention all contestants and spectators.<br> We have an announcement from Medb.</p><p><strong>P.A. System:</strong><br> “There&#39;s room for more than a single flower on the beach. Why settle for only one?”</p><p><strong>P.A. System:</strong><br> “So I hereby decree that the top three contestants will all be crowned first place!”</p><p><strong>P.A. System:</strong><br> ...This concludes our announcement from Medb.</p><p><strong>Men:</strong><br> Woohoooooo! That&#39;s the spirit!<br> You rock, Meeedb!</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Wha...</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Well I&#39;ll be damned. I never thought she&#39;d be that willing to share the spotlight.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Who knows? Maybe Hawaii&#39;s rubbing off on her.</p><p><strong>P.A. System:</strong><br> Now then...</p><p><strong>P.A. System:</strong><br> Next up in the Diamond Medb Contest,<br> we have Entry No. 3, handpicked by Medb herself!</p><p><strong>P.A. System:</strong><br> One of our dear spectators–Mash Kyrielight!</p><p><strong>P.A. System:</strong><br> According to Medb, she was picked because<br> “anyone wearing a swimsuit” is her rival!</p><p><strong>P.A. System:</strong><br> Are you there, Mash? We know you are.<br> Come on up to the stage!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> A-aaah!<br> Wh-wh-what should I do, Senpai!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Is this Medb&#39;s way of being nice!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Probably. Medb doesn&#39;t have friends, after all.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Guess it&#39;s instinct. Medb&#39;s a hunter at heart.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> A-all right, I guess I&#39;d better go then!<br> I&#39;ll do my best to show off how nice my shield is!</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Pretty sure they&#39;re not here to see your shield...</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> But then again, that sort of thing is what makes Mash so great. Anyway, let&#39;s go find some seats, Master.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> I got a feeling we&#39;re gonna be here for a good while, so we might as well see how it all turns out.</p><p><strong>P.A. System:</strong><br> Ahh, that was great!<br> A veritable festival of fifteen bathing beauties!</p><p><strong>P.A. System:</strong><br> Let&#39;s have another round of applause for all our contestants!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> They were all really pretty...</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Hahaha. Considering how dangerous most of them are,<br> I&#39;m impressed you can say that with a straight face.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> But you think so, huh? From where I&#39;m sitting,<br> you could be right up there with them, Master.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> They all looked so cool onstage!</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> I&#39;d agree with that. Visually speaking,<br> that was just what the doctor ordered.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> ...Hmph, so this “contest” is finally coming to an end, huh. If the top three are all taking first place, I guess the ones besides Medb are–</p><p><strong>P.A. System:</strong><br> Oh, wait a minute!<br> We have a new, last-minute entrant!!!</p><p><strong>P.A. System:</strong><br> This contest isn&#39;t over yet!<br> Come on up, Entry No. 16!</p><p><strong>P.A. System:</strong><br> With a thundering crack of her whip, it&#39;s... It&#39;s...!</p><p><strong>P.A. System:</strong><br> It&#39;s Medb in a leather swimsuit!<br> Ooh, how risqué!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Huh!?</p><p><strong>P.A. System:</strong><br> Now, let&#39;s get to scoring!<br> This is going to be a close one, folks!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>10.0　　　　　　10.0　　　　　　10.0　　　　　　10.0</p><p><strong>P.A. System:</strong><br> I don&#39;t believe it!<br> Another round of perfect scores!</p><p><strong>P.A. System:</strong><br> But don&#39;t go just yet! We have a final, FINAL entrant! Last one of the day, we promise!</p><p><strong>P.A. System:</strong><br> It&#39;s Medb in her usual swimsuitlike outfit!<br> Now, on to the score!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>10.0　　　　　　10.0　　　　　　10.0　　　　　　10.0</p><p><strong>P.A. System:</strong><br> Another full set of perfects! Incredible!<br> We&#39;re witnessing history in the making, folks!</p><p><strong>P.A. System:</strong><br> In an unprecedented turn of events,<br> all three Medbs win with perfect scores!</p><p><strong>P.A. System:</strong><br> I&#39;m so moved I can&#39;t stop crying!<br> What an amazing, incredible, legendary contest!</p><p><strong>P.A. System:</strong><br> The top three contestants are:<br> Medb, Medb, and Medb!</p><p><strong>P.A. System:</strong><br> Our queen sweeps the contest with a grand slam hat triiick!</p><p><strong>Men:</strong><br> You rock, Medb! You rock, Medb! You rock, Medb!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I&#39;m back, Master! It&#39;s too bad I didn&#39;t place higher, but it was still a lot of fun!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Your shield&#39;s still awesome.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Next time, you should wear a real swimsuit.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Heh... Sooo, what&#39;d you think?</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> What do I think!?<br> I think you&#39;re fifty-one short of a full deck!</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> I can&#39;t believe it... Even in my wildest dreams,<br> I never thought she would stoop this low...</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Why, whatever are you talking about? Did I say contestants couldn&#39;t enter multiple times?</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Don&#39;t blame me for this, poochie.<br> Blame your own lack of Spirit Origin variations☆</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Oh, before I forget... I&#39;m not thinking about how my victory here might affect my ServantFes sales, but...</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> ...since Holy Grails are all about giving people what they want...and if what the people want is me, well... You do see where I&#39;m going with this, right?</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> I should thank that BB chick sometime for giving me this perfect opportunity.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Like they say, third time&#39;s the charm. This time, I&#39;ll finally take the Holy Grail for myself and use it to turn this island into my ideal Slaveland.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Well, see you at ServantFes, I guess. Obviously I&#39;m going to grab the most sales by far, but who knows?</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Maybe you guys&#39;ll do really well and manage to sell almost a tenth as many books as me. Ahahahaha!</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> That little...! Master, quick, give me the snack bag! I&#39;m sure we still had some string cheese in there!</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> It&#39;s my duty as a tengu to punish the wicked!<br> I must pelt her with cheese until she repents!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I think she&#39;ll just instinctually roundhouse it again...</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> That impertinent wench! Very well then, I will simply pelt her with all manner of other snacks!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Please calm down, Ushiwakamaru! That won&#39;t accomplish anything besides feeding the seagulls!</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Good grief. Well, technically, this was still a change of pace. &#39;Course, whether it was a good change or not is debatable.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Debatable!?</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Well, maybe not for you. My condolences.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> ...Anyway, I say we head back to our room, Master.<br> Sleeping Beauty oughta be waking up soon.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> She&#39;s still fast asleep...<br> Maybe we should wake her up?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Okay, I&#39;ll do it.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Nn...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Wake up.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Don&#39;t wanna...<br> Too sleepy...</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Just five more minutes...<br> Puhleeease.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Aww, that&#39;s adorable.<br> But, I&#39;m afraid we can&#39;t let her stay in bed all day.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Reece, would you be so kind as to wake her up?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Hm? What&#39;s that smell?<br> Smells like...rotten fish...</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong></p><p>Gah!</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> Good morning! Sorry to wake you like that.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Wha!?<br> Heh!?

Is SHE! Doing! HERE!?</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> We&#39;re supposed to finish our drafts today, so I just wanted to see how yours was coming along.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> And since your other club members were having trouble waking you up...</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> ...I thought Reece and I could help.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> You call that helping!?<br> No wonder it literally smelled fishy in here!</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> ServantFes is tomorrow.<br> There&#39;s only one day left to go!</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> We&#39;re going to have so much fun once we both finish our final drafts!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Grr... Sounds like she already finished hers.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> We&#39;ve only got a little ways left to go.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Yeah, true.

Besides, do you even remember how to get there?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Ugh.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> And there we have it.<br> Now come on, let&#39;s go.</p><p><strong>Moolah:</strong><br> Yes, everything seems to be in order.

We&#39;ve still got a little time left, but at this point, I think we can call it.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Still, we did pretty well for ourselves.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> We especially sold a lot of copies to those pirates who came in after Blackbeard bought one.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> And then there&#39;s all the other people who bought a copy.</p><p><strong>Santa Island Kamen:</strong><br> Phew, made it just in time.

If that were common, it wouldn&#39;t be weird!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> He often shows up at Christmas.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> How&#39;s a guy like that a staple of your Christmas!?</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> Hi, Alter.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Great. What do you want?<br> Here to laugh at how pitifully our club did?</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> No, I&#39;m just here to say hello. You do know that not everyone&#39;s out to get you, right?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> ...So? You take the sales crown again this year?</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> No, I&#39;m afraid not.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> You didn&#39;t!?

I&#39;m not sure even I could take having a third statue of myself destroyed.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> So I guess I can settle for just taking first place in sales.

That mountain over there.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Mauna Kea.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Normally, you wouldn&#39;t be able to see it from here, since it&#39;s supposed to be on the island of Hawaii...</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> ...but now that the islands have combined together, it&#39;s a lot closer. Wanna see if we can walk there?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Right now?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Things like this, it&#39;s best to just up and do them as soon as they come to mind.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Worried you might not have the legs for it?<br> You are technically human, I guess.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> ...In that case, let&#39;s see if we can&#39;t snag ourselves a ride.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Hey, Boss!

Any other interesting stories?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Hmm... Let&#39;s see...</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Well, if we&#39;re talking Pele and volcanoes, then we also gotta cover the snow goddess Poliʻahu! She lives on Mauna Kea, but I bet you coulda guessed that.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> They say that whenever Pele tried to chase her away with lava, Poliʻahu would cover the lava up with snow, which is why it&#39;s so cold there.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> They say Poliʻahu always wore a white cloak,<br> and that Pele had a black one.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Pele would frequently try to kill Poliʻahu,<br> but would always end up getting outwitted.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> According to all the legends,<br> Pele never managed to beat her once.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Now that we&#39;re here in Hawaii and all,<br> you oughta brush up on your Hawaiian mythology too.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> I mean, that&#39;s the sort of knowledge we&#39;re gonna need in this battle, right?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> ...Though to be fair, I never thought Pele would be mixed up in all this either.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> A goddess with a black cloak, huh...<br> That does sound appropriate for BB.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> I heard they also went for the same kind of men.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> In one of the myths I read, Pele fell in love at first sight with a male demigod from Oahu by the name of Kamapuaʻa.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Kamapuaʻa had a beautiful singing voice, one that carried all the way to Pele&#39;s ears on the island of Hawaii.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> But when she went to meet him, she learned the truth: Kamapuaʻa was actually half man, half pig.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> They say Pele mocked him for being a pig,<br> but that didn&#39;t stop her from marrying him.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Don&#39;t know if it was the fact that she&#39;d already fallen for him, or if she just didn&#39;t mind the pig side as much as she let on, but anyway.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> ...That doesn&#39;t surprise me. Pigs are smart, docile creatures who like to keep clean, yet can grow to be fearsome boars if left in the wild.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> I can understand why some people don&#39;t care for pigs...but regardless, there aren&#39;t many gods who rule over them.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> So Pele married a pig, huh...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Is this why BB wanted to turn you into a pig, Robin?</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> That has nothing to do with this whatsoever!

I&#39;m sure you have things to discuss with Ibaraki.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> ...Now, if you&#39;ll excuse me!</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Hm?</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> So you wanna talk to me, huh?<br> ...What about?</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> I&#39;m not going oni-wild right now on account of how good this meat is, but–</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> That swimsuit looks good on you.</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> !</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Heh, tell me something I don&#39;t know.<br> But I commend your taste nonetheless, Master.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> That swimsuit looks badass on you.</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> !!!</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Right? Right!? RIGHT!?</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> This swimsuit is pretty cool, if I do say so myself!</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> You know, there have been rumors going around in the oni world lately about an oni “correcting” other oni who stray from the rightful oni path.</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Of course, I don&#39;t believe any of that nonsense, but if that oni really existed, they probably wouldn&#39;t be happy with this supremely stylish outfit...</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> But never mind that. The point is,<br> BB is the one who gave me this swimsuit.</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> There may be something fishy about her, but the fact that she did so shows she has promise!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...So that&#39;s what happened. I&#39;m so sorry we weren&#39;t able to give you a swimsuit ourselves, Ibaraki...</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Don&#39;t worry about that now, Mash.<br> All&#39;s well that ends well, as they say!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I&#39;m sorry too.</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Don&#39;t be stupid! Humans shouldn&#39;t go around apologizing to oni! Begging for their lives, yes. Apologizing, no!</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Heh. Still, I won&#39;t let that go to waste. Hand over that meat skewer, and all will be forgiven.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> You want this skewer?<br> Sure, here you go.</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> That&#39;s it. Mmm♪</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Delicious!<br> Is this chicken?</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong><br> That&#39;s right. For some reason,<br> Luluhawa has lots and lots of it.</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> What about this sauce?<br> Did you make this, Boudica?</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong><br> No, Emiya did. He knows a great deal about all sorts of different cuisines from around the world.</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong><br> I still have a lot left to learn if I&#39;m going to catch up to him.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> Don&#39;t sell yourself short. You&#39;re a much more skilled chef than I am. All I&#39;ve got going for me is my knowledge of modern-day seasonings.</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong><br> There you go again.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I didn&#39;t know you were here too, Emiya.<br> Does that mean Nero and Tamamo are around as well?</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> Yeah. The smell of barbecue lured us right over.<br> And it looks like we weren&#39;t the only ones.</p><p><strong>Babbage:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> ...Is it still not ready?<br> My patience is nearing its limits.</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> Not just yet, Your Imperial Majesty.<br> It&#39;ll take just a little more time.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Ugh, I cannot wait any longer!</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> Hey! I&#39;d called dibs on that one!</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Umu, what fine meat! Despite its beefy nature,<br> it tastes distinctly wolfy and gangy!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Well, I couldn&#39;t disagree more...<br> Meat&#39;s much better undercooked.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> The bloodier the better, as far as I&#39;m concerned.<br> Anything good is better when it&#39;s rare.</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> If you say so. But make sure you cook pork all the way through, or your stomach&#39;s going to regret it later.</p><p><strong>Babbage:</strong><br> ...However you choose to cook your meat, I would rather you didn&#39;t cook it on me just because you&#39;re running low on stoves.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> If it isn&#39;t Lord Babbage! I mistook you for an iron grill as elegant and grand as my own statues!</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> Hohoho, I&#39;m sorry. I&#39;ve never used steam to cook meat before, so I couldn&#39;t help but try☆</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Hmm. Yeah, I&#39;m definitely a lean red meat kind of girl.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> ...I have to say, the way things are going,<br> we&#39;ll be stuck returning to square one again.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> I don&#39;t see how we can take the ServantFes sales crown, no matter how good the manga turns out.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> We have to do something about the Medb Contest too...</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> And yet, in a contest of beauty,<br> there&#39;s almost no chance we can win.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> ...Which means our only option is to somehow make it into a contest we can win. But how to do that...?</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Hmm...</p><p><strong>A：:</strong><br> Damn, tengu girl, I could see your long face clear across the beach. What&#39;s got you so bummed?</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Oh, the Chinese soldier of fortune and the small-statured king. What do you want with me?</p><p><strong>A：:</strong><br> Just couldn&#39;t help but notice that something was bothering you. You&#39;re worried about something for Master&#39;s sake, right? It&#39;s written all over your face.</p><p><strong>A：:</strong><br> Hey, I&#39;ve been there, so I know what you&#39;re going through. If you need to talk, I&#39;m happy to listen.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> ...I remember now. You were a man of loyalty first and foremost. And the king is a cavalryman skilled in tactical warfare...</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> All right, you&#39;ve convinced me. If I can&#39;t solve this on my own, maybe the wisdom of others can help.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> The problem is...</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong><br> Hm hm.</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong><br> So the judges, organizer, and spectators are all on Medb&#39;s side, huh. In that case, the only choice is to turn the contest on its head.</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong><br> The best choice would be where victory can&#39;t possibly be disputed, like sports or a martial arts fight.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Yes, that&#39;s all true...</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> ...but I can&#39;t imagine Medb would simply agree to change the rules.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> She doesn&#39;t care about the integrity of the contest. All she cares about is winning.</p><p><strong>A：:</strong><br> Hmm... Medb, huh.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Come to think of it, I believe I heard you can change into just about anyone?</p><p><strong>A：:</strong><br> Yeah, though it&#39;s just a leftover power from some incident I don&#39;t even remember.</p><p><strong>A：:</strong><br> But anyway, while I could change into Medb,<br> there wouldn&#39;t be any point to it.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> True. She&#39;d have to actually admit defeat, otherwise her accomplices would just find a way to twist the situation to her advantage.</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong><br> Hmm.</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong><br> Hey, strategist!<br> Got any bright ideas?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong><br> ...It&#39;s too hot to think out here,<br> so the best plan I can offer is a simple one.</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong><br> Fine with me. The more complicated the plan,<br> the more variables you need to account for anyway.</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong><br> Besides, isn&#39;t strategy all about achieving maximal results with minimal effort?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong><br> Right you are. Very well then, simple it is.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong><br> First of all, ask yourselves this:<br> What is Medb&#39;s weakness?</p><p><strong>A：:</strong><br> Hm? Beats me.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Could it have something to do with the fact that she always has to win, and be beautiful while doing so?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong><br> Very astute. I can see why you made such a name for yourself during the Genpei War.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong><br> The fact that the audience, judges, and everyone else are on her side means that she cannot win in a way that would bring shame to one in her lofty position.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> I get that.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> But even if I were to challenge her to a duel,<br> she&#39;d just laugh in my face.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong><br> Which is why you will need the Chinese warrior&#39;s help.</p><p><strong>A：:</strong><br> ...Me?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong><br> Let me explain...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...<br> ...This is a lot of fun, isn&#39;t it, Senpai?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It may only be a temporary break,<br> but it still feels like a dream come true.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I know we have to repair this Singularity eventually, but I&#39;m still really glad we came to Luluhawa.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Everyone here is just enjoying their summer, without any reservations or hang-ups. It&#39;s priceless.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> If only this moment...could last forever and ever...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Yeah...</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Yamete KudaSTOOOP!!!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> O-Osakabehime!?</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> What do you think you&#39;re doing!?</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> “If only this moment could last forever”? Are you TRYING to bring dramatic irony down on our asses!?</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> The moment you say you wish spring could last forever, that&#39;s when it begins! Madness! Pandemonium! Cats and dogs living together!</p><p><strong>Tamamo Cat:</strong><br> You woofed?</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Uh, no. Nobody woofed.</p><p><strong>Tamamo Cat:</strong><br> Oh. Okay. I&#39;ll just go back to the grill then.<br> I gotta say though, barbecues make me real sad...</p><p><strong>Tamamo Cat:</strong><br> I can&#39;t seem to stop crying... Who thought it was a good idea to assign a cat to onion-chopping duties?</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> As! I! Was! Saying!<br> We&#39;re supposed to move forward in life.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Couldn&#39;t agree more.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Right? It&#39;s not a vacation unless it ends.<br> We have to move forward, not stay looping in place.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> ...What is it, Mash?<br> Why do you look like you don&#39;t know the chigai?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Uh, nothing. It&#39;s nothing.</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong><br> Hey, over there!<br> I could use your help too!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes?<br> What is it, Boudica?</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong><br> There&#39;s so many people here that we&#39;re running out of meat. Would you mind doing some quick hunting!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> All right. In that case...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...we&#39;ll hunt some of the wild Demon Chickens and Boars roaming around nearby!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> To the hunt!</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Did someone say hunt? Then I&#39;ll help too!<br> Consider it your reward for feeding me delicious meat!</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Now watch and learn what we oni can do when we go nuts!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Well hunted!</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> You sure you wanna go around saying things like that yourself...?</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> O-oh, right. I&#39;ve heard it so many times that it just sort of slipped out.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Great job, Senpai. It was nice that everyone took some of their spare time to help us out.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Emphasis on “spare”!</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> (Munch, munch)<br> Hey, I was rooting for you in my kokoro.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Would&#39;ve been even nicer if they&#39;d stopped eating first!</p><p><strong>Tamamo Cat:</strong><br> What do you expect? Eating is one of our three most basic desires. Anything living&#39;s gotta eat something to go on living.</p><p><strong>Tamamo Cat:</strong><br> Not even Servants can easily resist that fact of life.</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Now, on with the banquet! More meat!<br> With plenty of barbecue sauce!</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> This reminds me of Brazilian churrasco.</p><p><strong>Passing Office Worker:</strong><br> Um, excuse me. Could I get two... Actually, make that three steak tips? The ones right over there, please.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> Hm? O-oh, sure, here you go.<br> I see you&#39;ve got a very healthy appetite.</p><p><strong>Passing Office Worker:</strong><br> Oh no, I really don&#39;t, usually.<br> It&#39;s just that this meat is so good.</p><p><strong>Passing Office Worker:</strong><br> Oh, could I get a few hot dogs to go, please?<br> No seafood, thanks. I hate octopus and all that.</p><p><strong>Passing Office Worker:</strong><br> Thank you.<br> Have a great lunch, Chief Red!</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> ...Chief Red?<br> She must have me confused with someone else...</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> That aside, the way she stuffed herself looked extremely familiar...</p><h2 id="this-repetition-will-eventually-end" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#this-repetition-will-eventually-end" aria-hidden="true">#</a> This Repetition Will Eventually End</h2><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Oof...

Let&#39;s go, Avalon Armor!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Well that was a clichéd way to end things.<br> So much for the reference material.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> We may not have been able to talk with XX much, but at least there was almost no collateral damage this time.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> At this pace, I think we should be able to have a more involved conversation the next time we fight.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> That&#39;s enough, Foreigner! This street right here is Luluhawa&#39;s greatest moneymaker!</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> As long as my eyes still glow red,<br> I won&#39;t let you get away with destroy–Huh?</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> What are you all doing here, Senpai?<br> Don&#39;t tell me you&#39;ve given up on your comic?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Nah. We just realized it was more efficient to get rid of the loudmouth early on.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> ...Hmm, I see.<br> Well, as long as that&#39;s all it is, that&#39;s fine...</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> So, did you get rid of the Foreigner?<br> You&#39;re not trying to recruit her, are you?</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong><br> You rang, BB? ...Whoa, get a load of you.<br> What&#39;s with the weird outfit?</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Oh, never mind this. I just got a tan to match my current tropical imp aesthetic♡</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong><br> Gotcha. Definitely ain&#39;t a bad look on you...<br> But anyway, why the cold shoulder alluva sudden?</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong><br> I&#39;ve been freeloadin&#39; at Chaldea for some time. Surely there ain&#39;t no need to go about recruitin&#39; me now?</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Oh, when I mentioned the Foreigner, I didn&#39;t mean you, Hokusai. I was talking about–</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Wait. You&#39;re still alive?</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong><br> Sure am. It was a real close shave, though.</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong><br> Lucky for me Fujimaru showed up when [♂ he /♀ she] did.</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong><br> Heh, looks like I really owe you one, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong><br> If you ever need my help with anythin&#39;,<br> I&#39;d be glad to offer it.</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong><br> All right, let&#39;s head back, Toto-sama!<br> What&#39;s that? What&#39;re we gonna do there?</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong><br> What else?<br> We&#39;re gonna go ask that club for a favor...</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong><br> ...and draw that...robot(?)...we just saw as a guest!</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong><br> I can&#39;t get her outta my head.<br> I gotta get her down on paper!</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong><br> That...robot(?)...was too cool for words!</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> ...Hey, guys? I&#39;ve got a favor to–</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Oh, excuse me, BB. I need to check this message...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> &quot;The final draft&#39;s in trouble.<br> Come back to the hotel ASAP.&quot;</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That doesn&#39;t sound good. Come on, Senpai!<br> We need to leave right now!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> (What&#39;s this about? We only just got to the hotel.<br> I haven&#39;t even started drawing yet...)</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Huh...? Heeey! Hold up, Chaldeans!</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> ...(Sigh) They&#39;re already gone...<br> Dammit, I had a favor to ask them, too...</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Still, as ServantFes&#39;s organizer, I can&#39;t very well hold them back if their manga&#39;s in trouble.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> I don&#39;t know who&#39;s helping you out, Senpai, but it seems you&#39;ve got quite the motley crew on your side.</p><p><strong>Count of Monte Cristo:</strong><br> Hehehe. Specifically, I&#39;m the trouble at the hotel.</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> That guy with the weird laugh!<br> Mix your room up with ours or something?</p><p><strong>Count of Monte Cristo:</strong><br> No.</p><p><strong>Count of Monte Cristo:</strong><br> I merely made use of that communication method in order to give you a warning.</p><p><strong>Count of Monte Cristo:</strong><br> I&#39;m not joining any faction, and I wanted to avoid coming face-to-face with BB.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Aha, so that&#39;s what that was all about. Okay then, what is it you wanna tell us so badly that you&#39;d go to all these lengths?</p><p><strong>Count of Monte Cristo:</strong><br> ...Hmph. Have you grown tired of repeating this loop yet?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Not me.</p><p><strong>Count of Monte Cristo:</strong><br> Heh... I suppose I should have expected no less of you.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Yeah, kind of...</p><p><strong>Count of Monte Cristo:</strong><br> Worry not, Fujimaru. I have every confidence that you will be able to endure it.</p><p><strong>Count of Monte Cristo:</strong><br> Now, as for my warning...</p><p><strong>Count of Monte Cristo:</strong><br> ...it pertains to none other than your earlier opponent: the Foreigner, XX.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> She feels like she&#39;s breaking the rules just by existing.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> ...Yeah, she was cutting it close.<br> Very, very close.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> She&#39;s pretty awesome, isn&#39;t she?</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> ...Well now.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> I didn&#39;t know you went in for that sort of metal mold, Master.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Metal mold?</p><p><strong>Count of Monte Cristo:</strong><br> I understand where you&#39;re coming from.</p><p><strong>Count of Monte Cristo:</strong><br> However...I believe you should turn her to our side.</p><p><strong>Count of Monte Cristo:</strong><br> That Foreigner holds the key to unraveling all of this Singularity&#39;s mysteries.</p><p><strong>Count of Monte Cristo:</strong><br> You cannot simply fight her.<br> You must find a way to bargain with her.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> How do we lure her out?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Good question...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Maybe we could ask Hokusai to help,<br> since she&#39;s also a Foreigner...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Alternatively, we could ask someone skilled in the art of negotiation.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Bargain, huh...</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Hmm...</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Sounds like we need a negotiator.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> I like the sound of that...<br> I wonder if I could change to that class myself...</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> But who&#39;s gonna be able to get through to a lady from another world like–Oh.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Ahaaa, now I see. Fight sideshow with sideshow!</p><p><strong>Oda Nobunaga:</strong></p><p>Who&#39;re you calling a sideshow!?</p><p><strong>Oda Nobunaga:</strong><br> What, you mean me!? Me!?<br> Well...you&#39;re not wrong!</p><p><strong>Oda Nobunaga:</strong><br> That said, Heroine X would be one thing, but Heroine XX...?</p><p><strong>Oda Nobunaga:</strong><br> As far as Servants go,<br> I&#39;m as old-school Japanese as they come.</p><p><strong>Oda Nobunaga:</strong><br> I don&#39;t think I&#39;m cut out for all this newfangled Servant Universe stuff.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I thought you&#39;d be perfect for this.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I think so too!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> But Nobbu, you&#39;re...you know.</p><p><strong>Oda Nobunaga:</strong><br> No, I DON&#39;T know!</p><p><strong>Oda Nobunaga:</strong><br> I know I serve as the comic relief more often than not!</p><p><strong>Oda Nobunaga:</strong><br> But I still think I&#39;m as good-looking and talented as any other Servant!</p><p><strong>Oda Nobunaga:</strong><br> Ah well. Okay, so you just want me to talk to Heroine XX, right?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Yup. We&#39;ll call you the next time she attacks.</p><p><strong>Oda Nobunaga:</strong><br> Very well. When you need me, go ahead and use a Command Spell, or whatever it is you gotta do.</p><p><strong>Oda Nobunaga:</strong><br> ...So, now that we&#39;ve come to an agreement,<br> what do you say to a little warm-up?</p><p><strong>Oda Nobunaga:</strong><br> I&#39;m getting kind of rusty here, you know!? That&#39;s what happens when you only show up once a year!</p><h2 id="the-melancholy-of-katsushika-hokusai" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#the-melancholy-of-katsushika-hokusai" aria-hidden="true">#</a> The Melancholy of Katsushika Hokusai</h2><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Oh?</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> ...There seems to be some sort of commotion.<br> Let&#39;s go see what it&#39;s about.</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong><br> That don&#39;t make a lick of sense.</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong><br> Askin&#39; to trade places would be one thing, but you want me to hand over all of my club&#39;s space?</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> That&#39;s right.<br> As it stands right now, I just don&#39;t have enough.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> If I don&#39;t have enough, I&#39;ll have to take what I need from others. Every ServantFes exhibitor knows that.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> But don&#39;t worry, I&#39;m nothing if not fair.<br> If I lose, I&#39;ll be willing to give up my space.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> I mean, you were so popular at the last con that you ended up crowding out other clubs&#39; spaces, right?</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong><br> Ha! Don&#39;t be ridiculous! Of course a famous artist&#39;s gonna have people linin&#39; up.</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong><br> Normally I&#39;d tell you to take a long walk off a short pier...but I ain&#39;t one to run from a fight.</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong><br> Bring it on then, sister.<br> What sorta contest did you have in mind?</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Heh. We fight to see who&#39;s the strongest, of course. That&#39;s what being a Servant&#39;s all about.</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong><br> Huh...? But, that&#39;s not fair.<br> You&#39;ve got so many others fighting for you!</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> And what&#39;s wrong with that? They&#39;re here because of my charm–in other words, my power.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> So, I take it it&#39;ll just be the two of you then?</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong><br> Settle down, you pigheaded oaf. Me an&#39; Toto-sama can handle you and your little army just fine.</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong><br> You&#39;re going to face them all by yourself, Hokusai? But, you can&#39;t...!</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong><br> You an&#39; me may both be Foreigners, but that don&#39;t mean we&#39;re cut from the same cloth. I can&#39;t go lettin&#39; a dainty little girl get caught up in a scrap.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Fine with me. Come on, my Good-Looking Braves!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> All right, there&#39;s no way this is cool!</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> It&#39;s totally fine!<br> Why, you ask? &#39;Cause I&#39;m Medb, dammit!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Hold it right there!</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Hmph, I should&#39;ve known you Chaldeans might show up!</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> But fine, this works out nicely.<br> Now I can take my revenge for last year.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> So let&#39;s have a straight-up, head-on,<br> fair-and-square fistfight!</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Hooray! Now&#39;s our chance to take her head for ourselves, Master.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Now, now, settle down.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> You really are obsessed... Anyway, there sure are a lot of these punks here, huh?</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> All these men love me from the bottom of their hearts. That alone gives their lives value.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> That&#39;s a laugh. As far as you&#39;re concerned, men are nothing more than walking used tissue paper, right?</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Well I never. What an inelegant analogy.<br> That&#39;s not to say you&#39;re wrong, though.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> You know how your fingers get dirty after a good meal? Well, someone&#39;s got to be the tissue if you&#39;re going to wipe them clean.</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong><br> (I-I&#39;ve never heard such an alluring, enigmatic, unabashedly empty metaphor before...)</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> So yeah, they&#39;re scraps of paper. But they&#39;re not just any old scraps of paper. They&#39;re a storybook.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> A story that&#39;s all about my love for them.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> The only way they die is if I lose my special gleam,<br> or if I&#39;m disgraced in a spectacularly ugly fashion.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> That&#39;s never going to happen, of course, but hey, you&#39;ve got to have insurance juuust in case.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> True. Never know when some cheese is gonna come flying.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> You. Shut it.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Anyway, that&#39;s why I decided to make a photo album. A record of my love that would remain for ages to come.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Master, I&#39;ll admit that much of this is over my head...</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> ...but could this photo album truly be worth more than one of Lady Hokusai&#39;s books?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> They do say beauty&#39;s in the eye of the beholder.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> In which case, that&#39;s still no reason for Medb to try and steal another&#39;s space.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> It might. For Medb, anyway.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> I like that. Very individualistic. In which case...</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Hmm, I see how it is. So you Chaldeans are siding with the little artist, huh?</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Of course we are. Lady Hokusai and I share the same Japanese roots; I know without a doubt that she would never draw something obscene!</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong><br> Uh... I don&#39;t know. Wouldn&#39;t say love scenes<br> (read: porn) are that easy to draw...</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong><br> ...but Toto-sama&#39;s, well...</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Doesn&#39;t matter to me much either way. Ah, whatever.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> This new class has me feeling pretty belligerent myself, really.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Huh? You&#39;re blaming that on your class?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Since when did your class have anything to do with it?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong></p><p>What&#39;re you doing, taking the enemy&#39;s side!?<br> Enough of this crap! Let&#39;s just get her already!</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong><br> Great! I appreciate the help! Now that we&#39;re in the same boat, it&#39;s all hands on deck!</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong></p><p>I said, I&#39;m going to fight too!</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Fine with me. I&#39;ll take you all on at once.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> And when I win, you&#39;re all going to address me as “Queen”! Got that!?</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong><br> So...you want us to call you Queen Medb Queen?</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Ugh, you know what? Never mind. Not worth it.</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong><br> Dagnabbit, they just keep comin&#39;!</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong><br> What&#39;s wrong with you guys?<br> You better not be runnin&#39; outta steam already!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> I told you, none of us are running out of steam!<br> Not with all the training we&#39;ve put in!</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Ugh, this is endless!<br> Why won&#39;t you just give up already!?</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> All right, that&#39;s it, I&#39;m done for today.<br> We&#39;ll settle this in three days, at the Medb Contest!</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> And we&#39;ll do it fair and square!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Fair and square? That&#39;s sure not how I remember it...</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> What was that?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> The contest by Medb, for Medb...</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Look at you all well informed. That&#39;s right!<br> And when it comes, I&#39;ll mop the floor with you guys.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> The next time we meet,<br> you&#39;ll be begging me to take your space!</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> ...Right?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I&#39;ll be sure to take that into consideration...</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> That&#39;s the spirit! Think positive!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I&#39;ll see what I can do.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Just what I like to hear!</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> All right then, see you all around. I&#39;ve got a lot of relaxing and other environmentally friendly endeavors to pursue, and not nearly enough time to do it.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Hooohohoho!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> She&#39;s got that stuck-up evil rich girl act down to a T, doesn&#39;t she. Even more than before.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I think she&#39;s more lost than anything...</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong><br> Phew, you lot really saved my ass. Thanks, Master.</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong><br> Yes, thank you so much, Master! If there&#39;s anything I can do to repay you, please don&#39;t hesitate to ask.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Oh... Right.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> This seems like as good a time as any to bring up our request. After all, we do need to sell as many copies as possible.</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong><br> I can&#39;t go givin&#39; up our club space,<br> but anything else is on the table.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Well... Uh...</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong><br> ?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> If you&#39;ve got time, I was hoping you could give me some art lessons. For my manga.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> ...But what am I saying,<br> of course you don&#39;t have time.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Never mind. Forget it.</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong><br> Don&#39;t be ridiculous.<br> Of course I&#39;d be willin&#39; to help.</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong><br> I may not got a lotta time, but I do gotta return the favor you just did me. So I&#39;m joinin&#39; your club.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Are you sure!?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> I mean, you&#39;re a professional artist, right?<br> Don&#39;t you have, like, trade secrets to protect?</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong><br> Ah, don&#39;t worry &#39;bout that. Toto-sama here used to take hundreds o&#39; pupils, and I used to tutor people to help with the bills.</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong><br> Nothin&#39; I can teach you can make you a good artist by itself. Still gotta put in the work.</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong><br> And above all, actin&#39; all modest and stuff don&#39;t suit you. So go ahead and ask me what you really want!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> ...You asked for it.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Teach me how to draw better, Katsushika Hokusai!</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong><br> You got it.</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong><br> By the time I&#39;m through with you, you&#39;ll know the greatness of Japanese paintin&#39; through and through, or my name ain&#39;t Katsushika Hokusai of Tentacle Iron Bar!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Um...

Don&#39;t you think that&#39;s enough?</p><p><strong>Heroine XX:</strong><br> ?</p><p><strong>Oda Nobunaga:</strong><br> You can hide your feelings or your sadomasochism with that mecha stuff all you want, but it doesn&#39;t fool this fool!</p><p><strong>Oda Nobunaga:</strong><br> It&#39;s hard being the only one without a swimsuit on, isn&#39;t it?</p><p><strong>Heroine XX:</strong></p><p>...!</p><p><strong>Oda Nobunaga:</strong><br> Especially since it must be boiling in that thing.<br> I get it. Exercising willpower is hard.</p><p><strong>Heroine XX:</strong><br> No, this is–</p><p><strong>Oda Nobunaga:</strong><br> Besides, doesn&#39;t it kind of defeat the purpose, trying to ruin ServantFes in a cosplay getup like that?</p><p><strong>Heroine XX:</strong></p><p>Cosplay!?</p><p><strong>Oda Nobunaga:</strong><br> I&#39;m cut from much the same cloth myself,<br> so I could tell right away!</p><p><strong>Oda Nobunaga:</strong><br> Come on, be honest with yourself. You&#39;re super bad at the tsundere thing and you know it!</p><p><strong>Oda Nobunaga:</strong><br> Suits me just fine, though!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> (Is that something to be proud of...?)</p><p><strong>Heroine XX:</strong><br> H-h-h... Ho...</p><p><strong>Oda Nobunaga:</strong><br> Ho?</p><p><strong>F：Heroine XX:</strong></p><p>How is this not a swimsuit, you big jerk!?</p><p><strong>Oda Nobunaga:</strong><br> You do have a swimsuit!?<br> And a skimpy old-school bikini at that!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> So you were wearing a swimsuit under that thing the whole time!</p><p><strong>F：Heroine XX:</strong><br> Of course I was! After all...<br> This! Is! Summer!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> You look cute! And badass!</p><p><strong>F：Heroine XX:</strong><br> Th-thank you for the honest opinion! As it&#39;s summer and all, I decided to spend my bonus on a new outfit!</p><p><strong>F：Heroine XX:</strong></p><p>As for you, Nobbu!<br> What would a rock &#39;n&#39; roll fiend like you know!?</p><p><strong>F：Heroine XX:</strong><br> A new season of Universe World is here, and all the other outlaws I used to hang with have grown up and gotten jobs!</p><p><strong>F：Heroine XX:</strong><br> I couldn&#39;t be the only one left out, so I tried interviewing with the Galactic Police on a whim...</p><p><strong>F：Heroine XX:</strong><br> ...only to find out I would&#39;ve had a less toxic workplace if I&#39;d gotten a job shoveling nuclear waste!</p><p><strong>F：Heroine XX:</strong><br> Then, just when I thought I&#39;d get some paid leave to visit a resort planet, they send me to Hawaii...on business!</p><p><strong>F：Heroine XX:</strong><br> So now, while all the other Servants are out partying,<br> I&#39;m the only one who&#39;s still! Stuck! Working!!!</p><p><strong>F：Heroine XX:</strong><br> And for what? An Evil God No. 3 reading that turned out to be a nonentity? Do they think you can just order new evil gods off Amazones or something!?</p><p><strong>F：Heroine XX:</strong><br> Now I&#39;ve got some sideshow Servant feeling sorry for me!? That&#39;s the last straw! I can&#39;t take it anymore!</p><p><strong>F：Heroine XX:</strong><br> I am so done holding back. Ask not for whom the lunch bell tolls; it tolls for thee!</p><p><strong>Oda Nobunaga:</strong><br> Now you&#39;re ripping off a catchphrase!?</p><p><strong>F：Heroine XX:</strong><br> It&#39;s fine! My Rhongomyniad considers you a rival!<br> I&#39;m sure the old man won&#39;t have a problem with it!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> ...Did you hear that, Fujimaru?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Evil God No. 3, huh...</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Yeah.<br> ...Everything finally adds up.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> What old man was she talking about?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Did you crack your head on a coconut or something?<br> I meant the part about Evil God No. 3!</p><p><strong>F：Heroine XX:</strong><br> Evil God Hunter, Heroine XX,<br> commencing Foreigner elimination!</p><p><strong>F：Heroine XX:</strong><br> As they say, an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth, and a Foreigner for a Foreigner!</p><p><strong>F：Heroine XX:</strong><br> And once all&#39;s said and done, I&#39;ll finally get to enjoy Luluhawa as much as I want!</p><p><strong>Oda Nobunaga:</strong><br> Hmm. Looks like this is it for negotiations!<br> Pretty sure I can&#39;t talk her down at this point!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Then, that means...!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> We&#39;ll just have to kick her ass, right!?<br> Don&#39;t gotta tell me twice!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>F：Heroine XX:</strong><br> Oh man, this feels even better than I&#39;d imagined... Swimsuits by the seaside... I knew this was going to be fun!</p><p><strong>F：Heroine XX:</strong><br> Still, I have my own pride as a Foreigner!<br> You won&#39;t tempt me away from my duties that easily!</p><p><strong>F：Heroine XX:</strong><br> That&#39;s all for now! I&#39;m heading back to wait for my true target to show on the morning of the seventh day!</p><p><strong>F：Heroine XX:</strong><br> Farewell, Nitwit Nobbu! Farewell, Master of Earth!</p><p><strong>F：Heroine XX:</strong><br> Next time, I&#39;ll bring in my beloved ship stationed outside satellite orbit range, the Death Saber!</p><p><strong>A：Narration:</strong><br> This Just In: Heroine X&#39;s Du Stallion II Destroyed!<br> By the Evil Goddess of Justice! Oh the Humanity!</p><p><strong>F：Heroine XX:</strong><br> I&#39;ll be using my Anti-Planet Noble Phantasm to wipe ServantFes off the map. If you don&#39;t want to get vaporized along with it, I&#39;d get out of this Singularity while you still can!</p><p><strong>Oda Nobunaga:</strong><br> Damn, she got away...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I guess we failed.</p><p><strong>Oda Nobunaga:</strong><br> But the good news is, now we have more leverage to work with.</p><p><strong>Oda Nobunaga:</strong><br> Specifically, we now know exactly what&#39;s tying her down: work obligations!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Where are you going with this?</p><p><strong>Oda Nobunaga:</strong><br> If we can free her from those obligations and turn her into a lazy bum like Osakabehime, that&#39;ll solve everything!</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Chotto a minute! Did you just say something incredibly rude and mistaken about me!?</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> There&#39;s no reason at all for me to get a job!<br> Know why? &#39;Cause I&#39;m a minor!</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> And I&#39;ll always be a minor for as long as I&#39;m a Servant!</p><p><strong>Oda Nobunaga:</strong><br> Liar.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> Don&#39;t be a liar, Batty.<br> Unless you want me to set your pants on fire.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> I&#39;m not lying! I really believe that!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> No wonder you never work...</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Okay, Master? So please don&#39;t go around bemoaning my employment prospects!</p><p><strong>Oda Nobunaga:</strong><br> There you have it, Master. You need to come up with a new job for XX before she shows up again.</p><p><strong>Oda Nobunaga:</strong><br> Don&#39;t worry. As long as we have leverage, it won&#39;t take long before I have her eating out of the palm of my hand!</p><h2 id="showdown-final-foreigner" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#showdown-final-foreigner" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Showdown: Final Foreigner</h2><p><strong>Count of Monte Cristo:</strong><br> Are you here!?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> We&#39;re here, we&#39;re here!<br> Keep it hell down!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> And yeah, yeah, it makes your coat look cool or whatever, but would you freakin&#39; cut it out with that wind thing you&#39;re always doing?</p><p><strong>Count of Monte Cristo:</strong><br> You certainly are a nitpicky one, aren&#39;t you.<br> Well, no matter.</p><p><strong>Count of Monte Cristo:</strong><br> Fujimaru, I now know where XX is.<br> However...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Is there a problem?</p><p><strong>Count of Monte Cristo:</strong><br> ...No, not a problem. It&#39;s just that she&#39;s in a very...unique environment.</p><p><strong>Count of Monte Cristo:</strong><br> It would be much better if you could save her, rather than defeat her.</p><p><strong>Count of Monte Cristo:</strong><br> Are you ready to leave?<br> Then let us head for Kilauea.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> So this is Kilauea... It really is just a vast expanse of rock as far as the eye can see.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> It&#39;s still an active volcano, making it one of Hawaii&#39;s biggest tourist attractions.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> It&#39;s also where Pele lives.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> You could even buy a bunch of Pele merch at the nearby visitor center if you want.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> I&#39;d rec the Kilauea photo book myself. It&#39;s got pictures of some of its past eruptions, and–</p><p><strong>Oda Nobunaga:</strong><br> Man, enough with the tour!<br> If I wanted a guide, I would&#39;ve asked for one.</p><p><strong>Oda Nobunaga:</strong><br> So, what do you want me to do here?<br> Hm...?

All I have to do is use my Noble Phantasm once per day, and the rest of the time, I can just listen to someone drawl on about some king!?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> (I get the feeling she&#39;s not hearing the full story, but I know better than to say something now.)</p><p><strong>F：Heroine XX:</strong><br> So I get a suite at a fancy hotel...</p><p><strong>F：Heroine XX:</strong><br> An all-you-can-eat breakfast buffet...<br> Dinner at the restaurant...</p><p><strong>F：Heroine XX:</strong><br> And I only have to work from 2:00 to 5:00 p.m. each day!?</p><p><strong>F：Heroine XX:</strong><br> Is this real? Am I dreaming?</p><p><strong>F：Heroine XX:</strong><br> Luluhawa&#39;s amazing! The tropics are amazing!</p><p><strong>Oda Nobunaga:</strong><br> Indeed, I was surprised as well.<br> Living here would be enough to mellow anyone out.</p><p><strong>Oda Nobunaga:</strong><br> So, what do you say? Well? Well? Well well well?<br> (Musou Sandan negotiation tactics)</p><p><strong>F：Heroine XX:</strong><br> You need to ask!?<br> Hya!</p><p><strong>F：Heroine XX:</strong><br> Oh no! I accidentally snapped the antenna I use to communicate with HQ! How clumsy of me!</p><p><strong>F：Heroine XX:</strong><br> Now I&#39;ve got no choice but to ask the locals for help! Thanks for helping me, locals!</p><p><strong>Oda Nobunaga:</strong><br> Awesome. (Thumbs up)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Attagirl.</p><p><strong>Oda Nobunaga:</strong><br> And now a high five!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Way to go, Demon King of the Sixth Heaven!</p><p><strong>Oda Nobunaga:</strong><br> Pretty great, right? No, no, don&#39;t say another word!<br> I already know how awesome I am!</p><p><strong>F：Heroine XX:</strong><br> ...Well, on that note,<br> let me reintroduce myself properly.</p><p><strong>F：Heroine XX:</strong><br> I am Heroine XX. From now on, I&#39;ll be working alongside all of you at Chaldea. Glad to be part of the team!</p><p><strong>F：Heroine XX:</strong><br> Oh, can I ask where my desk is?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Next to Chaldea&#39;s boiler room.</p><p><strong>Oda Nobunaga:</strong><br> Aw crap, you&#39;re sticking her with me!?<br> I&#39;ve got my hands full of crazies as it is!</p><p><strong>Oda Nobunaga:</strong><br> Do you have any idea how many bottles of antacid I&#39;m already going through!?</p><p><strong>F：Heroine XX:</strong><br> So, can I go ahead and take my paid leave right now?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Uh, sure?</p><p><strong>G：Heroine XX:</strong><br> Great. Then I&#39;m gonna go check out this suite.</p><p><strong>G：Heroine XX:</strong><br> If you have any other questions for me,<br> I&#39;ll be glad to answer them tomorrow.</p><p><strong>G：Heroine XX:</strong><br> Now then, if you&#39;ll excuse me...</p><p><strong>G：Heroine XX:</strong><br> Woohoooooo! Vacation, here I coooooome!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Ah.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...That was even faster than I expected.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Anyway, does this mean the situation with XX is resolved now?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> I&#39;d say so.<br> ...Which just leaves the other situation.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You mean, that Evil God No. 3 she mentioned?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Right. But I guess we don&#39;t need to worry about it just yet. Oh, and one more thing.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> You there, Count of Monte Cristo?</p><p><strong>Count of Monte Cristo:</strong><br> I am. What is it, Jeanne d&#39;Arc?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Would you mind checking up on Kilauea regularly?</p><p><strong>Count of Monte Cristo:</strong><br> ...Not at all.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Great, thanks.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> &#39;Course, as long as I&#39;m not totally off the mark...</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> ...I doubt anything&#39;s gonna happen.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> What do you mean?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> ...I&#39;m not...well...<br> What would Holmes say if he was here?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> “Now is not the time”?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> There you go.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Okay then, let&#39;s head back. Now that this is taken care of, there&#39;s only one thing left to do.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Dominate ServantFes!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Exactly.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> ...But now, after so many freakin&#39; loops, I&#39;m starting to think even that&#39;s not really a problem.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Right now, there&#39;s something I&#39;m still not sure about. Something I still can&#39;t put my finger on.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Whatever it is, it keeps eluding me.<br> But once I finally figure it out...</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> ...I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll be able to draw something I&#39;m happy with.</p><h2 id="deadline-climax" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#deadline-climax" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Deadline Climax</h2><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> ...At first, I was just drawing manga to beat her. Then, I became obsessed with improving my craft.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> ...And now, I&#39;m chasing after something. Something that&#39;s almost...but not quite in my grasp.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> But...when I do finally get hold of it, this dream will be over. Mmm... And it&#39;s been such a long dream.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> ...Maybe that&#39;s why I&#39;m still out of reach.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> No, that&#39;s not it.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> That&#39;s something everybody wishes for to some degree,<br> but only a select few can ever succeed at doing.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> Imagination may not have any limit,<br> but the act of creation does.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> For you too?</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> Of course.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> I don&#39;t think any creator is ever fully satisfied with their work.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Huh. Sounds a lot like being a Servant.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> ...That&#39;s very deep.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Whatever you say.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> ...I&#39;ve got an idea for a story I kinda want to draw. Wanna hear?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I don&#39;t know why, but I started telling her what I&#39;d been thinking about. She just smiled and said it was a great idea.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> But it didn&#39;t feel right.<br> Something was...lacking.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> That&#39;s when it hit me: I already had someone close to me I could discuss story ideas with. Someone who would share my thrill at coming up with a good one.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> ...So, you know the book I&#39;m drawing now?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Yes?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Do you think it&#39;s interesting?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> ...Well that&#39;s good.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> But, don&#39;t you think it&#39;s still missing something?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Maybe the ending could be more satisfying?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> ...You&#39;re probably right, annoying as it is.<br> As it stands now, the ending is kinda cheap.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> It&#39;s not about whether it&#39;s a happy ending or a “bad” one. It just doesn&#39;t feel earned.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> The monster turning back into a human is cliché.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> ...That part, huh.<br> Yeah, it is kind of a dead horse now.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> All right then, what about this?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> If the monster stays a monster,<br> and the princess stays a princess...</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> ...do you think they could still understand one another?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Is mutual understanding that important?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> So you don&#39;t think they need to know everything about each other? Can you really call that true love?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> ...Ugh, this is complicated.<br> But then again... Yeah, you might be right.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> This princess definitely could.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> ...You really know this character well, don&#39;t you?<br> But then, I guess you would, after all these loops.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Hey.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Yeah?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Do you REALLY think this is interesting?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I can&#39;t tell anymore.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> ...Yeah, makes sense. You and I&#39;ve both been too close to it for too long.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I do.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> ...Huh. Well, I appreciate that,<br> even if you are just being nice.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Sure is noisy outside. But I guess that&#39;s to be expected, what with the beach right below.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> ...Ugh. Why am I even doing this?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> I wish I could&#39;ve just enjoyed ServantFes like a normal person.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Are you having second thoughts?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> ...Nah. Just thought I&#39;d say that out loud and try it on for size.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Yeah...</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> I swear, this is all her fault...</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> ...By the way, I just had a thought.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> What do you think of adding a scene like this to make the new ending more convincing?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I guess it&#39;s fine, but...</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> But what?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> It&#39;ll increase the number of pages we need to draw?<br> ...Well, yeah, that&#39;s true...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Won&#39;t we need to add another page or two to fit this in?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Ugh. Yeah, that&#39;s true...</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> I guess it would be pretty tough to add another page or two now, when we&#39;re only just squeaking by as it is.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> ...But...the story needs this scene.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> It&#39;s also kind of a downer.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> ...W-well yeah, I know it&#39;s not one of those fun action scenes...</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> ...but if the monster&#39;s body and soul are gonna end up all battered, there has to be a battle here, right?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> It&#39;s not enough to just tell the reader about it.<br> We have to show it.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Then we&#39;ll have to rework the entire story structure.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> ...Y-yeah, I guess so, huh.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> We&#39;ll have to go over the draft again... Restructure the pages... Tighten up the panel layout...</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> ...Guess it&#39;s no use. We&#39;ll never finish in time.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> What if we got everyone else to pitch in?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> You and I are already doing all the heavy lifting. I&#39;d say Mash is the only one who could help out at all.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> So we&#39;d have to adjust the panel layouts, add background characters in the battle scene, and...and...</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> ...Ugggh. I&#39;m sorry, I need to go out for a bit.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> I&#39;m gonna go pick a fight and clear my head.<br> Come with me.</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong><br> Oh, hello there. Is there something I can do for you?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> I&#39;m looking to pick a fight. Any recs?<br> Say, the overgrown brat you&#39;ve got working for you?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> You rang, assface?</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong><br> Let me remind you, fighting is strictly prohibited.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Then let&#39;s take this outside. There shouldn&#39;t be any problem with a street fight, right?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> What are you, some sort of mad dog?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Takes one to know one.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> The hell&#39;d you say!?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Come on. Let&#39;s do this.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> You take that back!<br> Where do you get off calling me a mad dog!?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> ...Uh, cause that&#39;s literally your whole deal?<br> And what&#39;re you whining for? You started it.<br> ...Right, Fujimaru?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> No comment.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> You do know that&#39;s basically as good as an affirmation here, right?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> Master! (Grrrrrr)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I, uh...don&#39;t know if I&#39;d put it that way...</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> Then what way would you put it!? Hey!<br> Look at me when I&#39;m talking to you, asshole!</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong><br> All right, that&#39;s enough. Back to work.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong></p><p>GRAAAH!</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong><br> And in the future, please refrain from taunting my employee, if you wouldn&#39;t mind.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> It was just a little teasing. Lighten up already.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> Oh, hello, Alter. What are you doing out here?<br> Is your final draft coming along okay?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> I could ask the same of you.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> Oh, I&#39;m all done, thanks!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> ...You don&#39;t say.</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong><br> You too, huh? Yeah, my own final draft came together pretty quickly.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> At last...the wings of freedom...</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> It was way harder than usual this year, but I somehow managed something I was much more satisfied with...</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> You don&#39;t say!</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> (Psst... Why is Alter in such a foul mood?<br> Is something wrong?)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> We ran into a little trouble with the manga...</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> So...it&#39;s not because she&#39;s feeling bad?</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> You want to go back to the drawing board? NOW?!<br> Are you insane?!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> But it&#39;ll make the whole thing way better!</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> What&#39;s the point of that if you don&#39;t finish in time for the con!?</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> I&#39;ve made that same mistake more than once,<br> so I know what I&#39;m talking about!</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Trust me when I say that missing the deadline sucks a lot more than putting out something you&#39;re not fully satisfied with!</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> This is your first con, so I get that you don&#39;t really wakarunderstand that yet, but–</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> I know it, believe me!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> I&#39;ve already drawn a ton of–Uh,<br> I mean, first time or not, I get it!</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong><br> In that case, maybe you oughta just accept what you got and put it all together as best you can?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> ...Yeah, I guess.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> ...Hmm. Now I see.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> By the way, Alter, why did you come out here in the first place?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> I was looking to pick a fight so I could blow off some steam.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Fighting as stress relief? I just get up and stretch for a while, but you do you, I guess.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> ...All right. In that case, we&#39;ll be your opponents.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Huh!?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> ...You? Really?</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> Yes, me. Don&#39;t worry about it.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> Hold on, let me just go get my partner.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> Are you all set?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> ...I&#39;ve got no idea what&#39;s going through that empty head of yours...</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> ...but if you&#39;re offering to help me blow off steam, I&#39;m not gonna pass up this chance.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Get ready, &#39;cause I&#39;m gonna sock you good!</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong><br> Wait, I&#39;m doin&#39; this too?<br> Ah well, I guess them&#39;s the breaks.</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong><br> Now that my final draft&#39;s all done, breakin&#39; a finger or two oughta be good for a laugh!</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> If you think that&#39;s funny,<br> I don&#39;t wanna know what you find tragic!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> Phew! It feels good to work out again.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> My back... My hands...</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong><br> Gotta say, that was a pretty good sweat I worked up.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Why&#39;d you agree to do this, anyway?<br> I still don&#39;t get it.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Not that I really care,<br> since I got the fight I wanted.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> Oh, don&#39;t you worry about that.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> Now then, if you&#39;ll excuse us,<br> we have to go adjust our schedules a bit.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> Come on, Osakabehime, Hokusai!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> ...What is her deal?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I&#39;d better get things ready.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Huh? What are you talking about?</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Uh, M-Master?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> I thought we were just going to give up for this loop and go with what we&#39;ve got, like they said.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> So why are you messing with the panel layouts?<br> And why are there so many more tablets now?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Come on in!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Hey, this is my roo–</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> Good evening!</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Oh wow, you really do have everything all set up.<br> Oh well, guess I&#39;ll just have to help out then.</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong><br> Mmkay, where did you want us to start?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Waaaiiit, wait, wait!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> The hell? What&#39;s going on?</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> Alter, we had a fight, and you beat us, right?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Uh... Yeah, that&#39;s true...</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> So as the losers, we thought it was only fair that we help the winner.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Awww, and here I was planning to spend what&#39;s basically my last day here swimming at Waikiki Beach.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> ...Fine, my lie in summer.<br> I was just gonna lock myself in and take it easy.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> I guess I can take some time to help.<br> What panel layouts need the most work?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Here, and here, and here, and–</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong></p><p>That many!?</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Hmm... At this point, it might just be better to start over from the rough draft.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I think it might be faster to start over from the rough draft?</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Well, let me see.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> ...I think you&#39;re right. It probably would flow a lot better if we just started over.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Come on, you don&#39;t have to do this.<br> I-it&#39;s not like I asked for your help or anything.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> No, you didn&#39;t. But we&#39;re butting in anyway.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> ...Well, you may not have asked for our help, but Master did.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> You, Fujimaru?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I know we&#39;ve got something great here.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I want to do everything we can to make this book turn out great.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> ...<br> ...Nghhh...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Please, Jeanne Alter. Let them help.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I&#39;ve been reading the draft...and I think you should go for whatever you need to do to be happy with it.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> You made this call, Master?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> ...Without even asking me?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I know we can finish this.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> I mean, I&#39;m sure we can, but...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> We&#39;ll get this done, even if it kills us.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Even if it kills us...huh.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> ...You&#39;re not wrong...</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> I do think this one&#39;s worth killing ourselves over to try and make it perfect, but...</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> ...What about you guys? Are you really okay with helping? What if this book ends up taking first place?</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> Fine with me.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> I see ServantFes as a type of conversation. We all get together, and converse with words and books alike.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> Sales are important, of course, but I&#39;d much rather there be another great book in the mix.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> ...As for me, I can&#39;t say I don&#39;t have my pride as one of the older clubs here.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> But if I&#39;m being honest... I just really want to read this story&#39;s finished version.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> And if I have to help make that happen,<br> then it can&#39;t be shikata&#39;d.</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong><br> Me, I&#39;m already done with my book,<br> and I do owe you guys a lot.</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong><br> And I gotta say, these tablet thingies are really darn useful.</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong><br> With tools like this on our side, finishin&#39; this thing might be rough, but it ain&#39;t impossible.</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong><br> All I gotta do is match your art style, right?<br> I could do that in my sleep.</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong><br> Now why don&#39;tcha show me how to use this thing, Princess? You oughta know a trick or two, right?</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Yes, yes.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> I swear, how did I end up teaching a world-renowned artist how to use a tablet?</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> So you see, Alter? You don&#39;t have to worry.<br> Now let&#39;s make a great book, shall we?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> ...What is it with this place?<br> Nobody here can mind their own damn business.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> So? What do you say?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> ...Of course I&#39;m gonna take them up on it.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> All right, Head Assistant, let&#39;s do this thing!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> ...Looking back on it now, drawing the manga felt like a life-or-death battle.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> This needs to be redone.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Wha...</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> After a long and bloody fight, both the monster&#39;s body and soul are bruised and battered.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> And the princess&#39;s love...<br> wouldn&#39;t be enough to revive him.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> It should be something more all-encompassing, something that transcends love altogether. Don&#39;t you think?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> No, I don&#39;t.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Something bigger than love would be way too good for this monster. It&#39;d just be a waste.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Because he&#39;s been doing everything he can on his own up to this point.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Do you really think he&#39;d be happy to be loved by something intangible like a country or community?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> ...No, he wouldn&#39;t. And the princess&#39;s love for him isn&#39;t given freely, and it isn&#39;t platonic.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> It needs to be more self-righteous and possessive... Like she wants to keep him all for herself.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> ...I see.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> In that case, I withdraw my objection!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> ...I get the feeling you just played me.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> Don&#39;t be silly. It just goes to show that talking things out can help you see a new side of things.</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong><br> There you go. How&#39;s this for the background?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Let me see... Crap.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Uwaa. This is, like, real art.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> But it still works as manga art, if only just.</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong><br> It was real touch and go for a while,<br> I&#39;ll tell you that.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> ...Dammit. Famous artist or not, I was all set to nitpick...but the damn thing&#39;s perfect.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> This background is exactly what I had in mind.</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong><br> I couldn&#39;ta done it without your vivid description of the battlefield.</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong><br> Glad I could be of service!</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> How &#39;bout a little pick-me-up? These energy drinks&#39;ll even replenish Servants&#39; magical energy!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Oh yeah?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong></p><p>(BEEELCH!!!)</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Goddammit, I think I&#39;m gonna hurl.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> If you must, could you do so from the balcony?<br> We all have to share that bathroom, after all.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> I-I&#39;ll do that!</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Was it really that bad?<br> She said it was a famous elixir down at the–</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Wait. Don&#39;t tell me she made it herself...?</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong></p><p>Achoo!</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Hurk. God, that was foul...</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> And the worst part is that I actually do feel less stressed now...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Maybe because you, um...got it all out?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> You mean hurled!? Yeah, I did!<br> I spilled my guts out there!</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> Stop that. You ought to at least act embarrassed after a display like that.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Too late. That train&#39;s long since left the station.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You can say that again.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> ...You were awfully quick to agree to that.<br> A little too quick...</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> All right, which one of you numbnuts just barfed on a customer!?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> [♂ He /♀ She] did.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Now you&#39;re making me take the fall!?</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Dragons aren&#39;t exactly known for being responsible...</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> You&#39;re hopeless, you know that!

Look!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> H-hey, why&#39;re these guys trying to get in our faces?</p><p><strong>Count of Monte Cristo:</strong><br> They are Celtic soldiers.<br> Medb&#39;s underlings!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Count!</p><p><strong>Count of Monte Cristo:</strong><br> I&#39;ll deal with them.<br> The rest of you, hurry to the con!</p><p><strong>Count of Monte Cristo:</strong><br> Fortunately, I thought something like this might happen, so I made arrangements.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Arrangements?</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> I&#39;m heeere!</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> I heard you need a ride!</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Get on! I&#39;ll have you at the con in no time!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Okay, let&#39;s split up.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Ushiwakamaru, you go with Kintoki.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Eh?</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Got it! Thanks for your help, Lord Kintoki!</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> ...N-no problem! Just don&#39;t go falling off!</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Then I&#39;ll make sure to hold on to you tight!</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> No! That&#39;s...I mean, I guess that&#39;s okay, but...!</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> A-ah, whatever! Get ready, &#39;cause I&#39;m gonna floor it! Golden Bear, full throttle!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I admit I&#39;m a little worried about Kintoki, but never mind that now! Alter, you go on Astolfo&#39;s hippogriff!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Come on, Master, you&#39;re coming too!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> We&#39;ll be right behind you!<br> See you again soon, Master!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> All right, let&#39;s go!</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Two of you? No problemo! Sooo, which one of you&#39;s okay with a princess carry?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> ...Fujimaru is.</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> We&#39;re almost there...!</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Huh? What&#39;s that sound?</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Aaah!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Wh-what was that!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Medb&#39;s chariot!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> That...little...BITCH!</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> That last one got us good!<br> We&#39;re gonna have to make an emergency landing!</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Go on back, Hippogriff!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Can you still run, Master?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Of course! This swimsuit&#39;s also a Mystic Code, after all!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Seriously? Freak. But I guess we&#39;re lucky Chaldea&#39;s got a penchant for overengineering right now!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Fine then, use it to strengthen your legs!<br> You should at least be able to pull that off!</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> I&#39;ll try to hold off that chariot!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Can you really do that by yourself!?</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Sure! Without Medb in that thing, it&#39;s just a big, sturdy, dangerously destructive machine of war!</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> ...Maybe I can&#39;t do this by myself!</p><p><strong>D：???:</strong><br> Man, you guys can&#39;t do anything on your own, can you? Guess I&#39;ll just have to bail you out again.</p><p><strong>E：Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Mwahaha, ox-drawn carriages are my specialty! This will be good practice for my next fight with Raikou!</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Huh?</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn:</strong><br> Hey there, Master. That&#39;s Medb&#39;s chariot, isn&#39;t it?</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn:</strong><br> You must&#39;ve really pissed her off this time.</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn:</strong><br> She only breaks that thing out when she&#39;s really hit the limits of her rage!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Aloha Man! Ibaraki-Douji!</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn:</strong><br> Aloha!? Does this look like a Hawaiian shirt to you!?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Oh shut up! I was talking about your soul,<br> not your fashion choices! You&#39;re just like Robin!</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn:</strong><br> Hey! I&#39;m not nearly as twisted as he is!</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Hmph. If Medb thinks she can ruin all our hard work with a stunt like this, she&#39;s sorely mistaken.</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> I&#39;m not letting all that lettering I helped with go to waste! Now hurry up and get to the con already.</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> And if you manage to take first prize, let&#39;s have another one of those barbecue parties to celebrate.</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Your treat, of course!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Of course!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Thanks, Luluhawa Banana Oni!</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Banana Oni!? When did I get such a delicious-sounding nickname!?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> All right, let&#39;s run!</p><p><strong>Gorgeous P:</strong><br> Hahahaha! Another year, another sorry crop of manga. But I suppose this is all we can expect from amateurs!</p><p><strong>Gorgeous P:</strong><br> Aside from the professional writers among the Servants like Andersen and Shakespeare, of course.</p><p><strong>Gorgeous P:</strong><br> I suppose this means Medb&#39;s photo album is a lock for the top seller then?</p><p><strong>Moolah:</strong><br> So it would seem.</p><p><strong>Moolah:</strong><br> All the money she saved by making it full of selfies let her really splurge on the cover and general design.</p><p><strong>Moolah:</strong><br> I&#39;m pretty sure it&#39;s the only self-published book in the history of self-published books to be sold as a jewel-encrusted leather hardcover.</p><p><strong>Moolah:</strong><br> Not that I mind, since we made a literal ton of money off it.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Looks like I&#39;ll end up winning after all. Thanks for all your support. Now bow down before your queen!</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> I suppose I should reward you for showing me how to take a good selfie, Anastasia. What would you like?</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> GODDAMN HOT.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> I see... Not much I can do about that...</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> So Moolah, any word from that not-so-holy maiden&#39;s club? Did they turn in their book yet?</p><p><strong>Moolah:</strong><br> No, they haven&#39;t.<br> I was looking forward to it, too...</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> I see. Then I&#39;ve already won.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> I was kind of curious what they had in store after all that smack they talked...</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> ...but it doesn&#39;t matter how good their book might be if they can&#39;t get it to the con.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Made it!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Made it!</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> !</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Moolah! Here&#39;s the digital file of our book.<br> I need you to fire up your printers right now.</p><p><strong>Moolah:</strong><br> Ooh, a day-of submission?<br> Thank you for your business☆</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> I don&#39;t care if you take us for all we&#39;ve got today. Just make sure you get enough copies printed in time.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> You can make all the copies we need with that reverse cause-and-effect printer of yours, right? Then here, this is how many we need.</p><p><strong>Moolah:</strong><br> Wow. Don&#39;t get me wrong, I&#39;m thrilled to charge you for all these...but this is your first con, correct? Are you sure you&#39;re going to sell this many?</p><p><strong>Gorgeous P:</strong><br> Stand back, Moolah. I&#39;ll be the judge of how many copies this book merits.</p><p><strong>Gorgeous P:</strong><br> At the moment, Medb&#39;s photo album is the clear front-runner.</p><p><strong>Gorgeous P:</strong><br> My own tastes are about as far from Venus as you can get, but I can&#39;t deny there&#39;s something genuine there.</p><p><strong>Gorgeous P:</strong><br> It&#39;s no wonder that Medb&#39;s “beauty” is a hit with the mongrels. Even I went and purchased a copy.</p><p><strong>Gorgeous P:</strong><br> Her book is undoubtedly one of this year&#39;s top contenders. Do you really think yours will require more copies?</p><p><strong>Gorgeous P:</strong><br> Heh. I imagine your amateur effort will merit no more than a hundred, at best.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> ...See for yourself then.</p><p><strong>Moolah:</strong><br> O-okay, I&#39;ll print one up as a test run.<br> Check this one out.</p><p><strong>Gorgeous P:</strong><br> Hmm...</p><p><strong>d&#39;Eon:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Gorgeous P:</strong><br> Oho, interesting...</p><p><strong>Gorgeous P:</strong><br> ...Really...?</p><p><strong>Moolah:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Gorgeous P:</strong><br> ...Oh come on. Why would you go to the battlefield now? And why aren&#39;t you stopping him?</p><p><strong>d&#39;Eon:</strong><br> ...!</p><p><strong>Moolah:</strong><br> O-oh my. This is rather engaging...</p><p><strong>Gorgeous P:</strong><br> Whoa! I can&#39;t believe he&#39;s still alive!</p><p><strong>d&#39;Eon:</strong><br> What are you waiting for, Boss!?<br> Turn the page!</p><p><strong>Gorgeous P:</strong><br> Not so fast.<br> One needs to savor these intervals between pages.</p><p><strong>Gorgeous P:</strong><br> After all, much of the magic of manga lies in the space between panels. Every good reader knows that.</p><p><strong>Moolah:</strong><br> Oops, my hand slipped☆<br> Huh!? Does this mean they can&#39;t be together now?</p><p><strong>d&#39;Eon:</strong><br> Can you blame them? He&#39;s a monster, and she&#39;s a princess. They were arguably doomed from the start.</p><p><strong>Moolah:</strong><br> I refuse to believe that!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> I gotta say, Master, seeing other people read our book like this is kind of...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Sweat inducing.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> It&#39;s, uh, just &#39;cause it&#39;s hot in here. Gotta be.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Embarrassing.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> I was gonna say agonizing, but that too.</p><p><strong>Gorgeous P:</strong><br> ...So the monster gave his life for the princess.<br> A well-worn trope for these sorts of stories.</p><p><strong>Gorgeous P:</strong><br> That said...this background art is incredible!<br> In fact, it&#39;s legitimately breathtaking!</p><p><strong>d&#39;Eon:</strong><br> I understand how the monster feels. He believes his ugliness could ultimately serve only as a source of suffering for his beloved.</p><p><strong>d&#39;Eon:</strong><br> In which case, it&#39;s no wonder he would choose to sacrifice himself. He must have thought it was the only way.</p><p><strong>Gorgeous P:</strong><br> Nonsense! The only way I will permit is the way that leads to Uruk!</p><p><strong>Gorgeous P:</strong><br> ...Huh?</p><p><strong>Gorgeous P:</strong><br> I...I...</p><p><strong>Gorgeous P:</strong><br> I remember...!</p><p><strong>Gorgeous P:</strong><br> I&#39;m not a rich man who lives in Luluhawa!<br> I&#39;m the King of Heroes, Gilgamesh P!</p><p><strong>Gorgeous P:</strong><br> Someone bopped me in the head with a squeaky plastic hammer the moment I set foot in Hawaii, causing me to lose my memories!</p><p><strong>d&#39;Eon:</strong><br> We all know that already!<br> Now come on, I want to read what happens next!</p><p><strong>Gorgeous P:</strong><br> I see. Today is full of surprises.</p><p><strong>Gorgeous P:</strong><br> ...Regardless, there would not seem to be a<br> “next” to read, now that the monster is dead.</p><p><strong>Gorgeous P:</strong><br> Wait. How is he still alive?</p><p><strong>Moolah:</strong><br> Hehehe. This was foreshadowed a few pages ago, King of Heroes.</p><p><strong>Moolah:</strong><br> I knew I smelled a good ending forthcoming.<br> Call it women&#39;s intuition☆</p><p><strong>d&#39;Eon:</strong><br> Thank goodness... I was so sure the monster had died on the battlefield...</p><p><strong>d&#39;Eon:</strong><br> Although, it does look like he can&#39;t fight anymore.</p><p><strong>Gorgeous P:</strong><br> Indeed. With his wild nature gone,<br> the monster is now just another animal.</p><p><strong>Gorgeous P:</strong><br> And now that she&#39;s given up her crown,<br> the princess is just another woman.</p><p><strong>Gorgeous P:</strong><br> Which means there is no longer anything standing between them.</p><p><strong>Moolah:</strong><br> So they went on to elope... How romantic. Though I wonder, will they be able to live happily ever after?</p><p><strong>d&#39;Eon:</strong><br> I think they will. This voyage portends that their journey together will be a good one.</p><p><strong>Moolah:</strong><br> I hope you&#39;re right.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> ...So? How many copies are you gonna print?</p><p><strong>Gorgeous P:</strong><br> A fair question.</p><p><strong>Gorgeous P:</strong><br> Given that your manga was able to shock my memories into returning...I must admit that it is a fine bit of entertainment indeed.</p><p><strong>Gorgeous P:</strong><br> In fact, it has rendered a faint moistness to my eye and reminded me that amateur works can be just as good as anything else.</p><p><strong>Gorgeous P:</strong><br> Thus, in recognition of your accomplishment, I will run my printers...at full capacity, capacity, capacity, capacity!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> ...Yes!</p><p><strong>Moolah:</strong><br> But that doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s going to sell, you know? Are you sure you can turn that many copies at your first con?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> ...We&#39;ll be fine. We&#39;ve seen a lot more con action than you might think.</p><p><strong>Moolah:</strong><br> Oh? Didn&#39;t you say this was your very first doujin?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> ...Yeah, I did.</p><p><strong>Gorgeous P:</strong><br> Not to worry. Good artists naturally attract good salespeople.</p><p><strong>Gorgeous P:</strong><br> That&#39;s part of what makes these sorts of fan artist alleys so fun! Now then...the time is upon us, Moolah!</p><p><strong>Gorgeous P:</strong><br> Let this year&#39;s ServantFes begin!<br> Hahaha, I&#39;ll be very interested to see what happens!</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong><br> There we go.</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong><br> Gotta say, I really appreciate you lettin&#39; me hawk my own book here.</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong><br> Oooh, Hokusai, won&#39;t you please let me help?<br> Please? Preeetty pleeease?</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong><br> All right, all right, I hear ya already.<br> ...Okay, how &#39;bout this?</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong><br> Why don&#39;tcha take this “Line Starts Here” sign and show the customers where they need ta go?</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong><br> You can count on me! Did you hear, Master!?<br> Did you hear!? I have a job now!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Good luck!</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong><br> Thank you, Master!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> That&#39;s a big responsibility, you know.</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong><br> ...!</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong><br> I-I&#39;ll do my very best! I won&#39;t let anybody down!</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong><br> Well would ya look at that. Glad she&#39;s so happy.<br> Still feel bad for havin&#39; her help me out though.</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> You mean because of the “Iron Bar” part...?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Or the “Tentacle” part...?</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong><br> Hey, take it up with Toto-sama.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Here&#39;s your change!<br> Thank you so much!</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> The line starts here, everyone!<br> Please queue up in an orderly fashion!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Thanks for the support.<br> Here you go, take it!</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> Hey there!<br> You guys sure took your time showing up!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> It&#39;s a long story...</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> Anyway, I&#39;ll take a copy of your book, if you don&#39;t mind.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> You helped us out plenty, so don&#39;t sweat the cost.<br> On the house.</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> Don&#39;t be ridiculous, Jalter.</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> I&#39;m just exchanging some of that useless treasure I&#39;ve piled up for something of real value here.</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> If I don&#39;t pay now,<br> I&#39;ll just feel bad about it later.</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> Now shut up and take my money!<br> ...I always wanted to say that.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You really are an upstanding man of the sea, huh?</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> Heh... I&#39;ve been a part of this scene for a long time now. Ever since I became a Servant, in fact!</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> And I&#39;m really, really proud to see you guys put out such a great book.</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> Almost makes it seem like I was your sponsor or something! Heh, obviously I wasn&#39;t, but still...</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> Anyway, that&#39;s enough chitchat.<br> See you round!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I&#39;m all out of books!</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Nothing but empty boxes here too.<br> Which means...</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> We sold out!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> ...We actually did it.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> We really did...</p><p><strong>Moolah:</strong><br> This concludes ServantFes!</p><p><strong>Gorgeous P:</strong><br> So, you sold out just as I thought you would.<br> You certainly took your time about it, though.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Yeah, yeah, you win, I lose! I get it!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Hold it.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Now what?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> The whole point of these books is sharing them, right? Here.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> ...I don&#39;t really need it, but fine, I guess I can take it off your hands. Here, I guess you can have one of my books in exchange.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Just don&#39;t expect it to keep its value for long.<br> I&#39;m gonna make an even better one next year!</p><p><strong>Gorgeous P:</strong><br> So, you&#39;ve already got a plan for your next book. Impressive presentation skills.</p><p><strong>Gorgeous P:</strong><br> Say, that gives me an idea. What do you think about holding our next industry initiative in a gorgeous, decadent skyscraper, Moolah?</p><p><strong>Moolah:</strong><br> A skyscraper? Like the sort that giant monkey climbed? I can&#39;t say I care for places like that.</p><p><strong>Moolah:</strong><br> Las Vegas, on the other hand...♡</p><p><strong>Gorgeous P:</strong><br> Hahaha, you do like your deserts, don&#39;t you? I guess it&#39;s true what they say: you can take the woman out of the desert, but not the desert out of the woman.</p><p><strong>Gorgeous P:</strong><br> But enough of that!</p><p><strong>Gorgeous P:</strong><br> Gespenst Ketzer! I award you this Holy Grail for taking first place at ServantFes!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Confirming... The magical energy reservoir checks out. This is definitely a Holy Grail.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> So now, all we have to do is use it at Kilauea,<br> and this Singularity will go away...right?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Well, that&#39;s what BB says...</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Hang on.<br> ...Let&#39;s hear what this guy&#39;s got to say first.</p><p><strong>Count of Monte Cristo:</strong><br> So you&#39;re done.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> You got a real flair for showing up once everything&#39;s over, don&#39;tcha?</p><p><strong>Count of Monte Cristo:</strong><br> There is nothing I can do about that. I&#39;ve been busy handling the matter you left to me after we defeated the Foreigner.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> How&#39;d it go, anyway?</p><p><strong>Count of Monte Cristo:</strong><br> I have been keeping an eye out since you asked,<br> and it&#39;s just as you suspected.</p><p><strong>Count of Monte Cristo:</strong><br> She has not been there once in all this time.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Gotcha. Well then, let&#39;s just skip the whole bit with Kilauea and go straight to the Mauna Kea Observatories.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Pele awaits there, at the site of the final battle.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Did you say...“final battle”?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> If you&#39;d just read the guidebook,<br> you&#39;d know what I was talking about.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> ...I mean, uh, not that I gave it more than a passing glance. Just skimmed it, really...</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou...</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Somethin&#39; to say, furball!?<br> Now come on, let&#39;s go!</p><h2 id="door-to-summer-dark-mix" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#door-to-summer-dark-mix" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Door to Summer/Dark Mix</h2><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> In Hawaiian mythology, Pele lives in Kilauea.<br> That part fits.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> But BB never went there.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Even weirder, she explicitly told us to come here, to Mauna Kea, on the last day.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> That just doesn&#39;t make sense. Mauna Kea is the snowy mountain where Poliʻahu lived.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> According to myth, this was the one place Pele could never conquer, and she hated it more than anything.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> ...I see. Then BB may be Pele the goddess, but she is not Pele.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Or, she is not ONLY Pele... That means everything comes down to the order of events, doesn&#39;t it?</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Specifically: When did the Foreigner that Chaldea detected first arrive here?</p><p><strong>Count of Monte Cristo:</strong><br> That&#39;s right. You all came to Hawaii after the Foreigner was detected.</p><p><strong>Count of Monte Cristo:</strong><br> But Foreigner XX didn&#39;t show up until after you&#39;d checked in at the hotel.</p><p><strong>D：Robin Hood:</strong><br> That means it wouldn&#39;t make sense for XX to be the Foreigner we detected.</p><p><strong>D：Robin Hood:</strong><br> Honestly, I&#39;d been wondering exactly when XX first got to Hawaii.</p><p><strong>D：Robin Hood:</strong><br> But now that we know XX isn&#39;t the Foreigner we&#39;re looking for, the question is: Who is?</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> (...I don&#39;t wanna get in trouble,<br> so I&#39;m just gonna keep my mouth shut.)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Ah! So, the reason we couldn&#39;t contact Chaldea&#39;s Hawaiian office isn&#39;t because this place became a Singularity, but–</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Right you are! It&#39;s because the entire office disappeared into Void Space, like it never existed to begin with!</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Welcome to the Mauna Kea Evil God Observatories, foolish humans♡</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> BB...!</p><p><strong>BB Pele:</strong><br> Teehee. Do you even know where Chaldea&#39;s Hawaiian office used to be located?</p><p><strong>BB Pele:</strong><br> It was right here, on the peak of this very mountain.</p><p><strong>BB Pele:</strong><br> Did you know that Mauna Kea is one of the best mountains for stargazing in the entire world?</p><p><strong>BB Pele:</strong><br> Or that it&#39;s home to a cluster of research facilities with telescopes from all sorts of different countries?</p><p><strong>BB Pele:</strong><br> The one from Japan, Subaru, is especially well known.</p><p><strong>BB Pele:</strong><br> It&#39;s quite the sight, seeing the silhouettes of so many observatories along the top of the mountain.</p><p><strong>BB Pele:</strong><br> Though of course...</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> ...there ISN&#39;T anything on top of this mountain anymore. I cast them all down into Void Space myself!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> This ominous aura...<br> It&#39;s just like Abigail&#39;s...!</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Abigail? Ugh, don&#39;t insult me. I&#39;m nothing like that lazy, good-for-nothing sleepyhead.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> I&#39;m a much more active, much more friendly dynamo of destruction!</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> I&#39;ve been peeping on you foolish humans from outer space, thinking up all sorts of ways we can have fun together!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Wh-what the...!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> This all seems painfully familiar...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Is this...a slot machine...?</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> What the hell are...no, what WERE those things?<br> They&#39;re bizarrely horrifying!</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> H-hey, Master? You don&#39;t look so good.<br> Are you feeling okay? Do you want some candy?</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Tick, tock, tick, tock♪</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Did you enjoy your repeating summer vacation?<br> You decided to reach for the stars, worked hard...</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> ...encountered and overcame setbacks, found friends to help you, and emerged victorious in the end.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> I haven&#39;t seen such a good reality show in ages.<br> It was worth all the trouble it took to set it up.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> But then...</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> ...I had the perfect bow to put on this touching story, and you just ignored it altogether!</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Why didn&#39;t you use the Holy Grail?</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> You&#39;re the Master of Chaldea, right?<br> Aren&#39;t you supposed to use the Grail to help people?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Easy.<br> Tell her, Fujimaru.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You seriously think we&#39;d trust YOU, BB?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I knew doing what you said would end badly.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Whaaat!? THAT&#39;S why my perfect plan was foiled!?</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> (Sniff)... After everything I did for all of you, this is the thanks I get...?</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> I worked really hard to put all this together for you, you know?</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> I spent the last month working it all out with Pele here.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> I was just laying the groundwork to hold ServantFes here when I decided to drop in on Chaldea&#39;s Hawaiian office.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Then, when I took a look through their telescope to see how far humanity&#39;s astronomical skills had advanced...</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> ...it synergized with my own functionality, and I saw so far into space that I locked eyes with an evil god.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> How does that old quote go again? “If you gaze long into an abyss, the abyss will also gaze into you”?</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Turns out, Nietzsche was more right than he knew when he said that♡ As soon as our eyes met, I synchronized with the evil god and became an eeevil BB!</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> It didn&#39;t take long for Chaldea&#39;s Hawaiian office to catch on, so I went and tossed them all into my shadow♪</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> And I tossed the other observatories in for good measure♪ So now, there&#39;s nothing left up here!</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> I plunged it all into the shadow of the void. Destroying the evidence, as they say☆</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Then, you were the Foreigner Chaldea observed!</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Yep! Rewinding time is the evil god&#39;s Authority.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Collecting human desires is my innate functionality. And controlling Luluhawa at will is Pele&#39;s Authority.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> I&#39;m also the one who fudged that golden eyesore Gilgamesh&#39;s memory!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Then, you&#39;re the one who put the Knights of the Round Table in swimsuits...?</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> And the one who gave me MY swimsuit!</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> That&#39;s right. It was aaall me.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Well, except Jeanne Alter&#39;s horrid swimsuit.<br> I had nothing to do with that. Suuuch awful taste!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Hey! You leave my taste outta this, asshole!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> All right, I get how you got possessed by an evil god. I can even get my head around it happening just because you looked at the thing.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> But how are you disguising your class?<br> Is the Moon Cancer thing just BS?</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Nope! Sure, I synced up with the evil god pretty well, but I didn&#39;t merge with it!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Didn&#39;t merge with it...?<br> But, all those evil things you&#39;ve done...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Ohhh... I get it...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> That&#39;s the thing, Mash. BB is kinda, well...</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> That&#39;s right! It doesn&#39;t matter that I synced up with an evil god from the abyss. I&#39;m still the same old BB I&#39;ve always been!</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> We just hit it off really well, agreed on a plan of action, then waved goodbye and went our separate ways☆</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> So your whole thing is that you test humans, watch them drown in their desires, then end up losing when they outwit your dumb ass...</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Now I get it. You and this evil god both have the same messed-up fetish, huh?</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Yep! So there you have it. I&#39;m a Foreigner, yes...in more ways than one...but also a Moon Cancer!</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Oh, and one little nitpick.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> “End up losing when they outwit your dumb ass”? Don&#39;t make me laugh! That was absolutely the exception that proves the rule.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> I&#39;m going to whup all your butts here and now,<br> and you&#39;ll go right back to day one!</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> And this time, I&#39;ll even reset your memories while I&#39;m at it. Humanity&#39;s future sucks anyway!</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> So why shouldn&#39;t you just keep reliving this summer forever, so everyone can be happy?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> (She really does have good intentions...even if the road they pave leads waaay past hell...)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> BB... No, make that BBHotep.<br> Can I ask you something?</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Huh? Why would you call me that?<br> You barely even know me!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> What would have happened if Senpai had used the Holy Grail at Kilauea, like you asked?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Would this Singularity really have disappeared?</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Hey, I&#39;m no liar. Of course it would disappear...along with the rest of the planet.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> My Holy Grail&#39;s more of a monkey&#39;s paw. You wish for something, and more or less get the opposite.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Wish for wealth, and lose all your money.<br> Wish for peace, and the world&#39;s plunged into war.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> And if you made a wish with purely good intentions...<br> Hehe... Hehehehehe!</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Forget waking up from a dream!<br> It&#39;d be the bad end to end all bad ends!</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> And don&#39;t you think that would be the best way for all of you to go out?</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> You&#39;re a monster...</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Oh, but please don&#39;t misunderstand me, okay?<br> It&#39;s not that I want to wipe out humanity.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> I mean, if humanity were gone, who would I play with?</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> I don&#39;t want to actually break my toys.<br> I just want to see how much I can mess with them.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> BB is gathering up magical energy...<br> She&#39;s getting ready to attack!</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Now, without further ado...<br> Iiit&#39;s piiig tiiime!</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> ...Heh, nice try.<br> But I had a feeling this would happen!</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Robin?</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Let&#39;s see what that spell the Caster of Kykeon taught me can do. No Face May King, Anti-Pig Version!</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Hey! No fair!</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Phew, that was close! And really, BB?<br> You&#39;re complaining about ME being unfair!?</p><p><strong>Heroine XX:</strong><br> I heard the whole thing!<br> So, you&#39;ve finally shown yourself, Foreigner!</p><p><strong>Heroine XX:</strong><br> I&#39;ve been searching for the source of all the evil I&#39;d been sensing lurking around ServantFes, and now I&#39;ve finally found it!</p><p><strong>Heroine XX:</strong><br> Now all that&#39;s left is to carry out your sentence... Execution!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> ...Yep. Much as I hate to admit it, I&#39;ll never be able to draw a better book than I managed this time.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Part of me might wanna give it another go, but that&#39;s about enough of this endless summer shit. You like playing with toys, BB?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Well, playtime&#39;s over.<br> I&#39;m gonna beat some sense back into you!</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> My, my, listen to you. But...<br> Hehehe, hehehehe...!</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> You drew a lot of books in your various loops, I&#39;ll give you that. But there&#39;s still one genre you haven&#39;t tried your hand at, isn&#39;t there?</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Well, now seems like a good time to fix that. So, as the Great Evil BB, let me teach you aaall about it!</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Are you ready, Master?<br> This is where the battle really begins.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> This is going to be a real-life horror show, complete with blood, gore, and lots of literal dead ends.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Scream and cry all you like; you can&#39;t turn back now. You are about to get veeery intimate with the unending darkness of Void Space!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Not a scratch on me, of course♡</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> So, humans, what sort of horror would you like to experience next? There&#39;s still so much we haven&#39;t tried yet!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Ugh! How the hell is she so strong!?<br> It doesn&#39;t make any damn sense!</p><p><strong>D：Robin Hood:</strong><br> What do you expect? She&#39;s a goddess, a Foreigner,<br> and a ridiculously OP Servant all in one!</p><p><strong>D：Robin Hood:</strong><br> This is looking real bad...!<br> We&#39;re not gonna be able to escape that shadow!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It&#39;s consuming all of Mauna Kea...! It&#39;s as though my shield isn&#39;t offering any protection whatsoever!</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> That&#39;s because it isn&#39;t. You still don&#39;t get it?<br> The usual rules don&#39;t apply here.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Things might be different if you had more than three dimensions to work with, but I don&#39;t see humanity ever evolving that much, let alone in the next few minutes.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Now I think it&#39;s time I gobbled you and the rest of summer up in one delicious bite♡</p><p><strong>Heroine XX:</strong></p><p>Hraaargh!</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> ...!</p><p><strong>Heroine XX:</strong><br> That&#39;s enough, you goddamn Foreigner!<br> Who the hell even likes cosmic horrors anyway!?</p><p><strong>Heroine XX:</strong><br> Everyone knows SF is the best genre of all time!<br> Now, I&#39;m gonna show you why!</p><p><strong>Heroine XX:</strong><br> Shine bright, my galactic spear! Seal this evil god away, and bring order to this universe!</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Huh!? That ridiculously bright light...!<br> Is that cosmic ether!?</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> You were supposed to just be a joke character!!!<br> How&#39;d you end up with a weapon to kill evil gods!?</p><p><strong>Heroine XX:</strong><br> I said I was a Foreigner Hunter! Not my fault you wouldn&#39;t listen! Now, my double-sided spear, unleash your nebula!</p><p><strong>Heroine XX:</strong><br> Get ready for the true power of a heroine!<br> The power of paid leeeave!</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Aaah!</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> (Sniff)... All that Authority, confiscated...</p><p><strong>Heroine XX:</strong><br> They didn&#39;t make me a space cop for nothing.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> But I heard you weren&#39;t on active duty with them anymore!</p><p><strong>Heroine XX:</strong><br> That doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m gonna pass up a juicy bounty on a Foreigner! Space cops have quotas to meet, you know!</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Dammit, I knew I should&#39;ve looked into their policies and stuff too...</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Oh well, I guess I don&#39;t really care enough to bother...</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> So that oughta be the end of these time loops. I take it you&#39;re ready to calm down now that the whole evil god thing is over?</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Hmph. I never needed an evil god to be perfectly wicked on my own...</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> ...Anyway, are you sure about this? This does mean your vacation will actually end, you know.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Isn&#39;t there anything you still want to do here?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> I...</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> ...I can solve that easily enough.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> ...Gorgeous P?</p><p><strong>Gorgeous P:</strong><br> Indeed.</p><p><strong>Gorgeous P:</strong><br> And I don&#39;t need to do anything as ham-fisted as rewinding time. I just need to make a proclamation.</p><p><strong>Gorgeous P:</strong><br> I hereby extend ServantFes by one more day!</p><p><strong>Gorgeous P:</strong><br> You may have sold every copy of your book, but there is still plenty of celebrating left to be done. Go forth, mingle, and enjoy yourselves!</p><p><strong>Gorgeous P:</strong><br> Consider it a wrap party.<br> I&#39;ll pick up the tab, of course.</p><p><strong>Gorgeous P:</strong><br> That is, my secretary will, using all that money she&#39;s trying to sneak off with.</p><p><strong>Moolah:</strong></p><p>H-huh!?</p><p><strong>Moolah:</strong><br> But I worked so HARD to stea–I mean,<br> save it all!</p><p><strong>Gorgeous P:</strong><br> As they say, you can&#39;t take it with you.</p><p><strong>Gorgeous P:</strong><br> I can vouch for that personally!</p><p><strong>Moolah:</strong><br> Please! At least let me keep half of it! My dreams of a camel paradise are growing fainter by the second!</p><p><strong>Heroine XX:</strong><br> All right, I&#39;ll take this criminal Servant...I mean, BB up to my ship for interrogation and cleansing.</p><p><strong>Heroine XX:</strong><br> Now come on, you, get a move on.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Aw man, so you&#39;re really gonna book me... I can&#39;t believe you&#39;re into that kind of doujin content!</p><p><strong>Heroine XX:</strong><br> I can carry you there on my spear tip if you&#39;d prefer?</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> I&#39;ll be good☆</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Okay Senpai, looks like I&#39;ll be seeing you later.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Oh, right! I almost forgot.<br> Hup!</p><p><strong>Heroine XX:</strong><br> All right, we&#39;ll be off then. But don&#39;t worry, we&#39;ll be back before tomorrow night&#39;s party!</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Once I&#39;ve done a little time for my crime,<br> let&#39;s just call it even, okay? Okay☆</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> ...What&#39;d she drop?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Are these...our manga?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> This is the photocopied manga we made in the first loop...and these are all our other attempts...</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> ...Wow. We really stuck with it, huh?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Hm?<br> ...That&#39;s weird.</p><p><strong>D：Robin Hood:</strong><br> What&#39;s up?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Two of these books are the same.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> This book&#39;s the one we drew in this loop...<br> But this other book is...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It looks older, doesn&#39;t it?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> ...Oh no.<br> This can&#39;t be happening...!</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> What&#39;s wrong?<br> Is there a problem with that book?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> N-never mind that now. Master, c&#39;mere.<br> I gotta talk to you. Alone.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> ...Okay, look. See this book? It&#39;s the one we just drew. But this other one? It&#39;s the one that made me want to try drawing in the first place.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Second one&#39;s...a little different.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Right. But the lead-up to the last act is pretty much identical.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> The ending may be a little different,<br> but that&#39;s about it.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> ...And that leads me to one inescapable,<br> horrifying conclusion...</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> I drew this manga, didn&#39;t I?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Looks that way, yeah.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong></p><p>This. Is. So. Embarrassing!!!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> So all this time, I&#39;ve been working so hard to surpass my own damn book!? I&#39;ve been jealous of my own work!?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> BB must&#39;ve left my own finished book from the future in Chaldea on purpose! She KNEW this would happen!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> I can&#39;t believe it! All that time I went on and on about making a better manga...!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Gaaah! I wish I could go back in time and just kill myself!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong></p><p>Aaaaaaaaaahhh!!!<br> Aaaaaaaaaahhh!!!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Wh-what&#39;s the matter, Alter!? You&#39;re going to hurt yourself if you keep pounding those rocks!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Oh God... Why does there ALWAYS have to be a stupid goddamn last-minute plot twist!?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Prithee, wherefore didst it become my wretched fate to be expelled from blissful vales of ignorance? Oh, woe is me!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> She even sounds different!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I&#39;m sure she&#39;ll be back to her old self...eventually...</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> This is it. This is rock bottom. I am finally here... Just let me lie here awhile...until it passes...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> A-all right. I&#39;m sorry Alter isn&#39;t feeling better, but at least we know this Singularity will disappear soon.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> And since we still have some time before it does...<br> AND since we came all this way to Luluhawa...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...let&#39;s take the time we have left to enjoy our vacation here, Master!</p><h2 id="more-adventures-in-luluhawa" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#more-adventures-in-luluhawa" aria-hidden="true">#</a> More Adventures in Luluhawa</h2><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Man, it feels like we haven&#39;t seen this airport in forever.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Just how many loops did we end up spending in Luluhawa, anyway?</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Yeah, those seven days felt like forever. BB may have caused a lot of trouble, but I&#39;m grateful for that opportunity at least.</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> She gave me this swimsuit too, so she&#39;s all right in my book. In fact, as far as I&#39;m concerned, she gets to be an honorary oni now!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ServantFes concluded without further incident, and we were able to contact Chaldea&#39;s Hawaiian branch as well.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Once the Luluhawa Singularity disappears in a few hours, these islands should all return to normal.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> So the observatories are back too, huh.<br> I guess BB really didn&#39;t hurt anyone.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> I don&#39;t know, I can think of at least one person she did a real number on... But never mind that now.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> The important thing is that we can now finally say goodbye to Luluhawa. You guys got all your things?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Sure do!</p><p><strong>F：???:</strong><br> Ah, vacations! There&#39;s nothing better than going home with a suitcase full of souvenirs and a heart full of wonderful memories!</p><p><strong>F：???:</strong><br> I know a lot&#39;s happened, but as long as you enjoyed yourselves, I consider that a Big Beautiful win!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> That voice...!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> The root of all evil...!</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> That&#39;s riiight☆ Congratulations on making it through an unending week of Luluhawa, everyone☆</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> You took first place at ServantFes,<br> and successfully repelled the Foreigner!</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Now all you have left to do is fly to South America and hop a plane to Chaldea!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You&#39;re here to see us off, BB?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Aren&#39;t you coming back with us?</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Senpai, it looks like BB has frozen. I think...she&#39;s very reluctant to say whatever is on her mind.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Eh, why listen? Nothing we&#39;ll get out of talking to her except more frustration and embarrassment.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Screw her. Let&#39;s just ditch her and get going.<br> Our flight leaves in three hours anyway.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Oh, well, you&#39;re wrong about that much!<br> I shut down all the flights. Permanently.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Luluhawa&#39;s not going away that easily, either.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> I&#39;m going to have to give the staff at Chaldea&#39;s Hawaiian office a veeery stern talking-to, so they know better than to go around making hopeful observations!</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Although, making you crawl around on all fours or keeping you as tiny insects... It&#39;s starting to become old hat at this point. I really need to come up with something new...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Wait, are you saying we&#39;re still not done here?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Or have you still not learned your lesson, BB?</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Hmph!

I need your help with something.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> YOU want OUR help? What happened to being a kouhai who could do anything and everything?</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> If you&#39;ve got a problem that needs solving, then solve it your damn self. We&#39;re exhausted, and more importantly, we are sick of your shit.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Oh Robin... I see you&#39;re still sulking about being relegated to management...</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> I was hoping Luluhawa would help you grow out of being so petty, but I guess that was asking too much...</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> If only I could have done more to help...</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Oh, don&#39;t even try that garbage on us!

Are you completely blind,<br> or just aesthetically challenged, Ibaraki!?</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Of course I&#39;ve changed! Just look at me!</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Pele&#39;s Spirit Origin is so dug into mine that this tan just...won&#39;t! Go! Away! Even the Holy Grail can&#39;t get rid of it!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Um, yes, you do have a lovely tan right now...<br> But is that a problem?</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Of course it is!</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> I know what people have been thinking.

I&#39;m so very sorry!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> For what it&#39;s worth, this book is a work of fiction, and any resemblance to actual Servants is, um...coincidental?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I promise you, we never wanted to damage the Round Table&#39;s good name or reputation...!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> We just kinda...made it all up.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> (Refrain from commenting)</p><p><strong>Gawain:</strong><br> ...Heh. Hahaha.</p><p><strong>Gawain:</strong><br> I do beg your pardon. I assure you I was not laughing in mockery, but delight.</p><p><strong>Gawain:</strong><br> Fujimaru, Mash, would you be so kind as to sell me a copy of your book?</p><p><strong>Gawain:</strong><br> Even at a glance, I can tell from our depictions that there is a great deal of truth about us in this book.</p><p><strong>Gawain:</strong><br> If it was your hands that brought it to life, so much the better. I would be delighted to read it.</p><p><strong>Gawain:</strong><br> Oh, but please don&#39;t tell the other knights that I was the first to purchase a copy. It would be rather embarrassing.</p><p><strong>Gawain:</strong><br> I have my uptight, no-nonsense image to think of, after all.</p><p><strong>Gorgeous P:</strong><br> Hahahahaha! How did you ever come up with such a manga!? If I didn&#39;t know better, I would say you were trying to get me to laugh myself to death!</p><p><strong>Gorgeous P:</strong><br> Not a whit of it makes sense, yet it all works wonderfully! Which one of you created this comedic masterpiece!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> W-well, this book was a collaborative effort, but I suppose I&#39;m technically the creative director.</p><p><strong>Gorgeous P:</strong><br> Heh, I see. I look forward to seeing what you come up with next.</p><p><strong>Gorgeous P:</strong><br> If I might suggest, how about adding a new character?</p><p><strong>Gorgeous P:</strong><br> It may be something of an old-fashioned tale, but what if a prince from the most distinguished family in the neighborhood, who lives in the mansion next door...</p><p><strong>Gorgeous P:</strong><br> ...ends up as a private tutor to the little Lion King, which leads to them developing a lovely romance–</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> Aha, what a wonderful thing to discover...<br> I knew lining up early was a good idea.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> Sir Bedivere, might I trouble you for another loan? As you can see, I am but a hapless poet who ekes out a meager existence through fishing.</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> Sure thing. This makes two hundred and sixty-four thousand BB Bucks I&#39;ve lent you to date. Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;m keeping very close track.</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> Two copies if you would, milady.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Of course. Here you go, Sir Bedivere.<br> I threw in a nice paper bag to carry them both, too.</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> You&#39;re too kind.</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> I wish I could buy copies for the rest of the knights, but apparently, bulk purchases are considered poor form at ServantFes.</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> So we&#39;ll just stick with copies for the two of us. Right, Tristan?</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> Indeed. I&#39;m sure the other knights will find their way here in time. No doubt the first will be Gawa–</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> My mistake. It seems there is another knight who discovered this booth long before us, though she appears to be reluctant to show herself...</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> Good grief. Who would think that a seasoned knight of France would still be so shy amongst her companions...</p><p><strong>Girl Knight:</strong></p><p>E-excuse me! Is this book about the Knights of the Round Table?</p><p><strong>Girl Knight:</strong><br> Th-then I&#39;d like to buy a copy, please!<br> H-how many thousands of BB Bucks is it for one...?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Oh, it&#39;s not nearly that expensive.<br> Just fifty Gil Bucks.</p><p><strong>Girl Knight:</strong><br> I-I see! That&#39;s wonderful! Then I&#39;ll gladly take a copy! Best of luck to you today!</p><p><strong>Girl Knight:</strong><br> Oh man... There&#39;s another new Round Table book here... And it looks pretty extreme...</p><p><strong>Girl Knight:</strong></p><p>Hang on... Sir Kay and King Pellinore are a couple in this!? There must be some kind of mistake! This is repugnant! Could I have a copy please!?</p><p><strong>Girl Knight:</strong><br> Huh? There&#39;s an age restriction on this? I have to show ID? H-how dare you! I&#39;m just as grown-up as anyone here...!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Phew. I didn&#39;t even notice it was already afternoon. Thirty more minutes until ServantFes comes to an end...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> We still have ten copies left over, but the reception has been better than I ever hoped. I&#39;m so glad.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Now we just have to wait for the others to get back... Huh?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ??</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ???</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Hey! You in the swimsuit!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> We&#39;ve still got copies! Come check it out!</p><p><strong>Swimsuited Servant:</strong><br> O-oh, hello. I just happened to be passing by, completely coincidentally, of course. Though I do actually have something to ask you...</p><p><strong>Swimsuited Servant:</strong><br> ...Have you, um, been enjoying this summer?</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Absolutely. Between the sightseeing and the doujin, it&#39;s been a very busy seven days.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I&#39;ve been having lots of fun.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes. It&#39;s been a wonderful time. Would you like to take a look at our book while you&#39;re here?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It&#39;s more about daily life, rather than any particular conflict.</p><p><strong>F：Swimsuited Servant:</strong><br> ...I see. Well, since our paths happened to cross like this and all, I think I will take a copy. Or ten.</p><p><strong>Swimsuited Servant:</strong><br> Thank you. I&#39;m glad I found this book. We tried forming our own club, to little avail...but now, I&#39;ll be able to end this trip with some fond memories.</p><p><strong>Swimsuited Servant:</strong><br> I&#39;m so grateful to the Servant who made this Singularity for providing me with that opportunity!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> We did it, Senpai!<br> He just bought most of our last remaining stock!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Of course, we didn&#39;t have enough copies printed to take first place even if we sold them all...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...but I&#39;m still so happy that so many people liked our book. It makes all the hard work we did well worth it!</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Indeed. I&#39;m especially grateful to Lancelot.<br> He helped us out a lot right at the end.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Huh? Lancelot was here?<br> Did he show up while I was off buying supplies...?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I&#39;m sorry I wasn&#39;t able to say hello to him,<br> but I&#39;m glad he at least stopped by.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> (She still has no idea...!)</p><h2 id="doujin-curry-×-rice-first-half" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#doujin-curry-×-rice-first-half" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Doujin: &quot;Curry × Rice&quot; First Half</h2><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Good morning, everyone!<br> The printer just delivered our book!</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Allow me to open the box!<br> Ooh, this is so exciting.</p><p><strong>C：Robin Hood:</strong><br> Yeah, I can&#39;t wait to see it. How about you, Alter?<br> You think this one came out well?</p><p><strong>D：Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> &#39;Course it did. It&#39;s too bad I ran out of time at the end and couldn&#39;t polish it as much as I wanted...</p><p><strong>D：Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> ...but aside from that it was pretty kick-ass.<br> I&#39;m positive it turned out great.</p><p><strong>D：Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Now...ooopen sesame!<br> Let&#39;s see how this spicy masterpiece turned out!</p><p><strong>D：Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Whoa... I don&#39;t know how it ended up like this,<br> but this cover is wicked awesome...!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I&#39;m sure the inside is just as awesome!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It tells an epic, gripping tale just brimming with spectacle and suspense! It&#39;s far greater than the sum of its parts!</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> This is great. I&#39;ve always liked destined duels.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Of course, in my case, the duels I fought were all over in a flash, so I never experienced much in the way of drama.</p><p><strong>C：Robin Hood:</strong><br> (Sigh) This is exactly why I hate overpowered heroes.</p><p><strong>C：Robin Hood:</strong><br> They have no idea what it&#39;s like to go through life laying traps, preparing poisons, or crawling around in stinky bogs, just to survive another day.</p><p><strong>C：Robin Hood:</strong><br> That said...I might not have any interest in fighting a duel to the death myself...</p><p><strong>C：Robin Hood:</strong><br> ...but I can tell this kind of story&#39;ll be a big hit. It&#39;s pretty badass, and that Indian king movie is awesome.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> So this book should suit the tastes of people like Lord Robin and myself.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Perhaps that means it has universal appeal–the kind that will create quite a buzz for our book.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That sounds like...going viral!<br> It&#39;s exactly what we want!</p><p><strong>D：Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Going viral, huh.<br> Hehe, I like the sound of that.</p><p><strong>C：Robin Hood:</strong><br> All right, let&#39;s head to the con then.

It&#39;s about India, you know.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Are you sure? No girls in this one, you know.</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> What, that? Bah! I am not so uncultured that I can&#39;t enjoy a good doujin on its own merits!</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> Besides, when you&#39;re on my level, you can just gender-swap the characters in your mind, no probl–I mean, never mind.</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> The point is, quality is quality!<br> Well, good luck! I&#39;ll be rooting for you!</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> What a strange sight... Both the paper bags he&#39;s carrying are full to bursting with doujin...</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> I never would have thought there was another collector as fervent as Blackbeard. Is that...Arjuna?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I think so...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> He must have been given sample books from all sorts of places...</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> Phew... There&#39;s so much to see. I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;m going to even have time to get my own shopping done.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> Oh, hello, Fujimaru. I didn&#39;t know you were attending ServantFes this year.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> ...<br> Would you mind if I read your book?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> N-not at all!</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> Hmm, a battle between two brothers over which of them will inherit the throne... Fascinating.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> Indeed, brothers in India are quick to fight one another. I don&#39;t see how it could be otherwise.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> And in the conclusion...</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> No, wait. It would be foolish to read the whole thing now.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> I&#39;ll take one–no, five copies,<br> in the hope that the archer wins.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I&#39;m not sure what you mean by that hope, but thank you!</p><p><strong>Karna:</strong><br> I&#39;m impressed you can run a shop in this unbearable heat while staying completely still. I could never manage that.</p><p><strong>Karna:</strong><br> By the way, this is fascinating. Most fascinating.</p><p><strong>Karna:</strong><br> ...I feel I&#39;ve heard that is what you&#39;re supposed to say when you want to read a book... Is that all right?</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Of course. Please, go right ahead!</p><p><strong>Karna:</strong><br> Thank you... These battle scenes are especially striking. An archer firing three arrows at once, hm?</p><p><strong>Karna:</strong><br> And what&#39;s this? He used coconut trees as catapults to fire soldiers with iron shields at the castle? What a frighteningly effective tactic.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Right? Right!? I quite love the scene where they ride their horses down an incredibly steep cliff!</p><p><strong>Karna:</strong><br> This will be an excellent reference manual for future battles. I&#39;ll take five of them.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> (Gasp...gasp)...<br> Do you have any books left? You do, right?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Oh, Osakabehime! We actually just sold out...</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Naniii!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> But since you helped us so much, I thought it would only be right to put a copy aside for you.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Here you go. On the house.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Whoa, really? Yattaaa!</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Ehehehe. Let&#39;s see...</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Two men obsessed, love and hate, passions blazing so strongly they can only resolve their differences by fighting... This doujin has it all!</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> I can&#39;t believe Alter has gotten so good so fast... She&#39;s a genius!</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> This is exactly why I could never give up doujin!</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> The pupil has already become a master!<br> And now she&#39;s even a source of great inspiration!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Thank you, Osakabehime... But I think it would make Alter much happier if you told her that yourself.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Are you joking!? She&#39;d nigerundayo because hearing praise embarrasses her too much! She&#39;s a real chicken about compliments, that one!</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> All right, I&#39;ve got to go organize all the goodies I picked up, so see you later!</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Oh, by the way, what are your chances of victory looking like?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I&#39;m not sure. We sold everything we brought, but we also didn&#39;t print too many in the first place...</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Oh, that&#39;s a shame. But you did your very best,<br> so you should be proud!</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> The great thing about artist alley at a con is that it&#39;s fun just to be there!</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> And that makes everyone a winner!</p><h2 id="doujin-martha-s-built-upper-first-half" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#doujin-martha-s-built-upper-first-half" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Doujin: &quot;Martha&#39;s Built Upper&quot; First Half</h2><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Our samples are here!</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Ooh, I&#39;m excited for this one.

What happened to the purity of hand-to-hand combat?</p><p><strong>Sasaki Kojirou:</strong><br> Ordinarily, bringing a sword to a brawl would end in one-sided slaughter...</p><p><strong>Sasaki Kojirou:</strong><br> ...but in your case, Lady Martha, I must concede that your fists far surpass any blade.</p><p><strong>Sasaki Kojirou:</strong><br> Indeed, I see that in the end, you catch and snap my sword in your hands before trapping me in a deadly grapple.</p><p><strong>Sasaki Kojirou:</strong><br> Hahaha, it would seem my goose is well and truly cooked now. When you&#39;re through with me, I daresay I will look like one who has just been through a meat grinder!</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> Oh come now, don&#39;t exaggerate. They really captured how I would actually behave here!</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> Of course I&#39;d go easy on you after putting you in a choke hold. See?

I didn&#39;t know Japanese storytelling favored stories of reincarnation!</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> But I don&#39;t get why you made this chick in the blue dress the main character. I mean, in the end, she just resolves things with brute force, right?</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> If you were going for a story about intelligence, mind games, and romance, you should&#39;ve focused on this chick in the red dress.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> In fact, you should change that right now, unless you want to feel the wrath of a divine curse.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> The point is to avoid messing up at the end, though...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I mean brute force is...kinda what they both rely on...</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Well, that aside, I still like it.<br> At least, this body seems to be really happy with it.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> I guess this is what homesickness feels like.

You&#39;re an author too, right!? Surely you understand why!</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> What, you think this book is harmful or something?<br> Don&#39;t be ridiculous!</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> This is nothing! Less than nothing, even! Why would you even try to regulate this sort of book now!?</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> Okay, listen. EVERY story has the potential to turn people&#39;s lives upside down, by virtue of speaking directly to our hearts.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> Do you know what we call books that are filled only with facts and figures? Data.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> And yes, when it comes to data, mistakes may be evil, but for stories? This is possibility itself. The wishes and dreams of those who worked to bring the story to life.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> To censor that is to censor culture, and in turn, humankind itself. If you&#39;re going to call stories about men and women vulgar–No, wait. Scratch that.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> As a goddess, if you truly wish to protect the people you watch over, then shouldn&#39;t you be able to handle this sort of “poison”?</p><p><strong>Pārvatī:</strong><br> O-okay!

Another power must&#39;ve wormed its way into our workplace...</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Perhaps this is our punishment for spending too much time exploring Luluhawa, and not enough polishing our skills...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Hehehe...

Sorry about that. I tend to laugh kind of loudly when I get too excited.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Anyway, now I know an altogether different way to handle waves. The ocean here really is fun!</p><p><strong>Anne:</strong><br> Master ahoy☆<br> Were you all out swimming together?</p><p><strong>Anne:</strong><br> Why didn&#39;t you invite me?<br> I don&#39;t want to be the odd woman out.</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> Don&#39;t worry, the day&#39;s only just begun.<br> We still have plenty of time to change that!</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> On that note, Tamamo the dangerous summer fox maiden is here, and she brought beach balls!</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> You&#39;ve all got energy to spare, right? Then why don&#39;t we put it to use and work up a good sweat before lunch?</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> How about a game of beach volleyball?<br> It&#39;s a classic for a reason, after all.</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> Why don&#39;t you be our referee, Master?<br> All you have to do is sit back and enjoy the show♡</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Ah! That sounds like a great idea to me too, Master. Let&#39;s take Lady Tamamo-no-Mae up on her suggestion and play beach volleyball next!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Sounds good.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I&#39;m fine with whatever as long as you&#39;re enjoying yourself, Ushiwakamaru.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Then it&#39;s settled! For our second round, we&#39;ll play a game of beach volleyball! At last, never skipping leg day will pay off!</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> You must have done a lot of thigh workouts yourself, Lady Martha! Now&#39;s the time to put them to good use!</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> Wha–E-excuse me, but I&#39;m a member of the clergy. Please don&#39;t talk about me like I&#39;m some sort of training fanatic...</p><p><strong>Anne:</strong><br> Hehe, don&#39;t go thinking you&#39;ve already won.</p><p><strong>Anne:</strong><br> You two might know your way around a weight room,<br> but you&#39;re still landlubbers.</p><p><strong>Anne:</strong><br> Your legs can&#39;t hope to measure up to those of us who live life on the sea. Isn&#39;t that right, Tamamo?</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> Absolutely. I might be a fox, but right now,<br> I&#39;m also a shark out for blood.</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> My Megalo Jump Spike would put Susanoo to shame,<br> even in his prime!</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> Try and block me all you want, Martha.<br> I&#39;ll break right through your iron wall♡</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> Well listen to you. I&#39;m warning you now, I wouldn&#39;t underestimate Jacob&#39;s God Fist if I were you. Now hold on while I go get my jersey!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>E：Surprise Orion:</strong><br> Game, set, and match!<br> At 15 to 13, the winner is Team Skullshark!</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> Grr...! I can&#39;t believe I flubbed it at the very end of the third set...!</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Yes, it&#39;s too bad what happened with that spike of yours, Lady Martha...</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> I never would have thought it was possible to pop a volleyball like a balloon...</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> Oopsies.</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> Hehe. It was a close match, but we just barely had the edge in the mental game.</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> All right then, Master Referee♡ Why don&#39;t we go celebrate our win with a lovely lunch out toge–Huh!?</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> I don&#39;t see Master anywhere!<br> Orion, where did Master go!?</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> [♂ He /♀ She] just took off in the middle of your game.</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> I couldn&#39;t let this once-in-a-lifetime match end prematurely, so I decided to stop peeping and start reffing.</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> So, where should we go to lunch? I&#39;m flattered you&#39;d ask. Usually, it&#39;s me trying to pick up–gurk!</p><p><strong>Anne:</strong><br> Sorry for stepping on your pet fur ball, Artemis.</p><p><strong>Anne:</strong><br> But anyway, we need to hurry up and look for Master! You&#39;ve all got a bad feeling about this too, don&#39;t you!?</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Khh... I&#39;m such an idiot!<br> I can&#39;t believe I let my guard down like that...!</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Come on, let&#39;s all split up and look for [♂ him /♀ her]!<br> There&#39;s no telling what might have happened...!</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Pirate A:</strong><br> Heh heh heh... Ain&#39;t no one gonna bother us &#39;round here, Master of Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Pirate A:</strong><br> Vacation spot or not, ye oughta know better&#39;n ta come ta the bottom of a cliff like this all by yer lonesome.</p><p><strong>Pirate A:</strong><br> Tell me, Master, do ye understan&#39; how this happened?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> The ball Martha popped was blowing away...</p><p><strong>Pirate A:</strong><br> Go on.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> So I went to pick it up so it wouldn&#39;t just end up being trash on the beach. Then you showed up.</p><p><strong>Pirates:</strong><br> Bahahahaha! Did ye hear that, boys!?<br> Talk about no good deed goin&#39; unpunished!</p><p><strong>Pirate A:</strong><br> Maybe now ye&#39;ll think twice before ye go traipsin&#39; around tryin&#39; ta be a Good Samaritan.</p><p><strong>Pirate A:</strong><br> Not that ye&#39;ll ever get a chance at that!<br> Right, boys!?</p><p><strong>Pirate B:</strong><br> Right! I still remember what happened in Okeanos clear as day.</p><p><strong>Pirate B:</strong><br> Sure, I mighta made a mistake signin&#39; on with Blackbeard...</p><p><strong>Pirate B:</strong><br> ...but it was your Servants what threw me overboard.</p><p><strong>Pirate C:</strong><br> An&#39; ta add insult ta injury, yesterday...</p><p><strong>Pirate C:</strong><br> ...yer Servant, Ibaraki-Douji, took me fer all I got.<br> Now I ain&#39;t got no money left fer ServantFes.</p><p><strong>Pirate A:</strong><br> Do ye get it now? We&#39;re all victims here!</p><p><strong>Pirate A:</strong><br> Now, yer gonna pay us what we&#39;re due.</p><p><strong>Pirate A:</strong><br> Let&#39;s see... How &#39;bout we start by having ye use up all those Command Spells of yers? Don&#39;t want no Servants showin&#39; up here, after all...</p><p><strong>Pirate B:</strong><br> Hehehe... Don&#39;t bother callin&#39; fer help...</p><p><strong>Pirate C:</strong><br> Heeheehee... Ye know, [♂ he&#39;s /♀ she&#39;s] a lot cuter than I thought now I&#39;m seein&#39; [♂ him /♀ her] up close...</p><p><strong>Pirates:</strong><br> Heeheeheehee...!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> This is looking pretty bad...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> How am I gonna get out of this one...!?</p><p><strong>D：Surfer:</strong><br> Pardon me. Could I ask you a question?</p><p><strong>Pirates:</strong><br> Who the hell&#39;re you!? What do ye and yer lame purple hair want with us, Four-Eyes!?</p><p><strong>D：Surfer:</strong><br> Did you lose something around here?<br> You didn&#39;t? Well that&#39;s too bad.</p><p><strong>D：Surfer:</strong><br> I thought perhaps you might be searching for your consciences. It seems I was hoping for too much.</p><p><strong>D：Surfer:</strong><br> If you have no intention of turning over a new leaf, then we can end this here and now.</p><p><strong>D：Surfer:</strong><br> Please stay right where you are, Fujimaru.<br> Don&#39;t worry, just close your eyes for a minute and all will be well.</p><p><strong>Pirates:</strong><br> The only eyes closin&#39; &#39;round here are gonna be yers!<br> Get him, boys!</p><p><strong>D：Surfer:</strong><br> Heh...!</p><p><strong>Pirates:</strong><br> What...the...<br> What did you...just do...?</p><p><strong>F：Musician:</strong><br> ...What did he do?<br> Nothing at all...</p><p><strong>F：Musician:</strong><br> The attack that caused your legs to cramp up was my own, unleashed from where I was hidden in the shadows...</p><p><strong>F：Musician:</strong><br> Yes, it is I, Tristan, Beach Child of Sadness...<br> Are you all right, Fujimaru?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Tristan...!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Then, does that mean the guy with the shades is</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> Indeed, he is. The handsome Frenchman has been most at home here in Luluhawa.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> He was the first of the Round Table to strip off his armor and head straight for the ocean.</p><p><strong>D：Surfer:</strong><br> Hahaha, I guess this new look suits me a little too well? Sorry about that. I AM the strongest Knight of the Round Table, after all.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> Indeed, who else could he be but the Knight of the Lake, now the Surfer of the Tropics...Sir Lancelot.</p><p><strong>Gawain:</strong><br> Please don&#39;t take what these two jokers have to say at face value. They&#39;ve been letting the Luluhawan air go to their heads.</p><p><strong>Gawain:</strong><br> At any rate, I&#39;m relieved to see you are unharmed, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Gawain:</strong><br> I apologize if we overstepped our bounds in staging our little rescue, but we couldn&#39;t help but worry.</p><p><strong>Gawain:</strong><br> Still, the last thing we would wish to do as Knights of the Round Table is to offend you.</p><p><strong>Gawain:</strong><br> So you would be doing the four of us a great kindness if you could laugh this off as just a bunch of busybodies unable to stop themselves from butting in.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> The four of you...?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Does that mean...</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> W-well, after they all changed into swimsuits,<br> I couldn&#39;t be the only one left out...</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> But that doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m letting myself go soft. I just thought my usual armor would stand out too much here...</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> At least, that&#39;s what I thought...<br> But I just don&#39;t...feel right in these clothes...</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> So I&#39;ve been trying to avoid going out in public as much as possible...</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> But now that I&#39;m here, I&#39;m relieved to see you don&#39;t think anything of it. I guess this outfit wasn&#39;t as strange as I thought.</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> Oh! And hello, Fujimaru. I hope Sir Tristan wasn&#39;t being too much of a bother?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...[♂ What kind of Round Table knights ARE you!? /♀ (Try and fail to undilate pupils)]</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Master! I can&#39;t apologize enough for my carelessness! I will accept any scolding you feel is appropriate later!</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> First, I must dispose of these despicable villains who tried to steal you away!</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> A blond, a redhead, and some sort of purple mess...<br> And all unrepentant scoundrels, by the look of you.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Stay right where you are! Or don&#39;t! Regardless,<br> you&#39;ll never see the light of another day!</p><p><strong>A：Pirates:</strong><br> Aaah! It&#39;s the headhunting Berserker...!<br> We&#39;re done for! But damn if she doesn&#39;t look badass!</p><p><strong>A：Pirates:</strong><br> Blackbeard was right! The Master of Chaldea really does have some bangin&#39; Servants!</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> ...Wait. You think we are the villains?</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> Oh, how it saddens me to say so, but I&#39;m afraid you are mistaken... Go on, Sir Lancelot, tell her why we are here.</p><p><strong>Lancelot:</strong><br> Hoo baby! We got ourselves a real babe here,<br> don&#39;t we, bros! Wooo! Wooo!!!</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> (...Oh, Sir Lancelot... I think your talent for disguises–or rather, your ability to adapt to your surroundings–backfired...)</p><p><strong>Gawain:</strong><br> (Impressive, Sir Lancelot. You&#39;ve completely adopted the Luluhawan style as your own...!)</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Lancelot:</strong><br> I think we got off on the wrong foot.<br> Let me start over. I am none other than...</p><p><strong>F：Tristan (Narrating):</strong><br> Watch as we see the brief flirtation from Sir Lancelot. Note the way he peeks over his glasses. Oh, he is definitely interested!</p><p><strong>Lancelot:</strong><br> ...the leader of Club Camelot,<br> Lancelot, commonly known as “Best Boy.”</p><p><strong>Lancelot:</strong><br> While my first and foremost concern is Master&#39;s safety, I also believe in practicing proper beach etiquette.</p><p><strong>Lancelot:</strong><br> And if, by a twist of fate, I should happen to meet a beautiful, charming young lady there, it would be rude not to invite her to tea.</p><p><strong>Lancelot:</strong><br> Yes, that is how the Round Table rolls!<br> Am I right, bros!?</p><p><strong>Gawain:</strong><br> Of course. If we see a damsel in distress, we are honor bound to rescue her. That is the purpose of our club!</p><p><strong>Gawain:</strong><br> That is why the newly formed Round Table of Camelot exists! I am grateful to ServantFes for this opportunity.</p><p><strong>Gawain:</strong><br> Thanks to this convention, we were able to repair our broken bonds and renew our friendship!</p><p><strong>Gawain:</strong><br> So I assure you, young maiden, that you have nothing to fear from us...even as you stand there...seething in a bloodthirsty rage...</p><p><strong>Gawain:</strong><br> I am unsure why you are so upset,<br> but please...put down your weapon.</p><p><strong>Gawain:</strong><br> Despite what you might think, we are not exactly detail-oriented, so explaining everything in full would be too much hassle to bother with.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> ...<br> (Look that clearly says &quot;You&#39;re all so dead&quot;)</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> (Welp, she&#39;s gone and taken out her weapon. Hehe,<br> not that I blame her. I would&#39;ve done the same.)</p><p><strong>Pirate A:</strong><br> Aw bilgewater, I don&#39;t wanna get caught in the cross fire! C&#39;mon, men, get her &#39;fore she gets us!</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Very well then! I will hurl each and every one of you clear out of this bay all the way to the Atlantic myself! Prepare to face true tengu power!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Lancelot:</strong><br> Wooo! I cannot believe THREE Knights of the Round Table weren&#39;t able to take down our opponent!</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> At last, the time has came to spread my wings!</p><p><strong>Gawain:</strong><br> Alas! No matter how dreadful an opponent she may have been, I could not bring myself to take up my sword against a scantily clad woman!</p><p><strong>Gawain:</strong><br> It seems summer will be my downfall...quite literally!</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Hmph. A nice long swim back to shore should help you overeager boys cool your heads.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> ...Now, that just leaves you,<br> and those pirates hiding behind you.</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> My humblest apologies, milady. I understand your confusion, but I assure you, we meant no harm.</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> We saw that Fujimaru was surrounded by pirates,<br> and intervened to make sure [♂ he /♀ she] was safe.</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> Isn&#39;t that right, Fujimaru?</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Hmm. Normally, I would dismiss your excuses as so much nonsense, but I suppose you have been conducting yourself like a true gentleman.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Is what he says true, Master?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> It&#39;s true. They really saved me.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> ...I see. Then I must offer you my thanks.</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> Not at all. They got what was coming to them,<br> and they did need to cool their heads.</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> They may have seemed calm and placid, but they were really quite worked up on the inside.</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> The sea near our island was dark and murky, so the clear blue water here must have brought out the inner child in each of them.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> ...What about you? You&#39;re a member of the Round Table, just like them. What about your inner child?</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> Oh, well, my journey was longer than theirs, so I suppose mine must have retreated a little deeper inside.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> All right, I understand.<br> But these pirates are a different matter.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> You scoundrels abducted Master.<br> The bay is too good for you.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> I&#39;m going to send you three flying well past the horizon.</p><p><strong>Pirate A:</strong><br> Wait!<br> Ye got us all wrong! We didn&#39;t do nothin&#39;!</p><p><strong>Pirate A:</strong><br> We just wanted ta warn [♂ him /♀ her] about the sharp rocks around the tide pools up ahead!</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> What?</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> Really? Odd. You seemed quite clearly to be threatening [♂ him /♀ her].</p><p><strong>Pirate A:</strong><br> No! We just wanted [♂ his /♀ her] autograph!<br> [♂ He&#39;s /♀ She&#39;s] famous, y&#39;know!</p><p><strong>Pirate A:</strong><br> We mighta never gotten another chance like this, so we wanted somethin&#39; ta remember this adventure by!</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> Then...what about the lost consciences you dropped?<br> The ones Sir Lancelot mentioned?</p><p><strong>Pirate A:</strong><br> O&#39; course they ain&#39;t lost!<br> We never dropped &#39;em in the first place!</p><p><strong>Pirate A:</strong><br> We&#39;re good, honest pirates now!<br> We got outta Blackbeard&#39;s crew long ago!</p><p><strong>Pirate A:</strong><br> This is exactly why I hate knights and warriors an&#39; such! You&#39;re always goin&#39; &#39;round just looking fer excuses to prove how tough ye are!</p><p><strong>Pirate A:</strong><br> So ye go around pickin&#39; fights ye know ye can win,<br> and don&#39;t even try to hear us out! Jerks!</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> I-I don&#39;t think I was acting THAT rashly...<br> I didn&#39;t even try to kill you this time...</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> Hahaha, now I see. Hahaha.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> So, um...did you still want my autograph?</p><p><strong>Pirate A:</strong><br> O&#39; course we do, dummy!</p><p><strong>Pirate A:</strong><br> Hang on, we got some Luluhawa souvenirs we just bought that oughta do the trick nicely... What&#39;d ye get, B? A wood carvin&#39;?</p><p><strong>Pirate B:</strong><br> Naw, I got a paper lantern they was sellin&#39; in the hotel gift shop. It&#39;s tourist trash, an&#39; I love it.</p><p><strong>Pirate C:</strong><br> Me, I got a Missouri T-shirt that just says &quot;BATTLESHIP!&quot;</p><p><strong>Pirate C:</strong><br> It&#39;s great. Feels like somethin&#39;<br> straight outta a movie.</p><p><strong>Pirate A:</strong><br> I gotcha. I&#39;m still holdin&#39; on to the pamphlet from last year&#39;s Kawaii Fes so&#39;s I can remember it.</p><p><strong>Pirate A:</strong><br> Okay then, would ye sign these for us?<br> Oh, an&#39; where&#39;s your club&#39;s table?</p><p><strong>Pirate A:</strong><br> A-01, eh? Hey, that&#39;s one o&#39; the end tables. Ye must be pretty popular then. We&#39;ll hafta visit yers first!</p><p><strong>Pirate A:</strong><br> All right, tha&#39;s all we wanted.<br> We&#39;ll just be gettin&#39; on our way.</p><p><strong>Pirate A:</strong><br> See ye &#39;round! An&#39; be more careful from now on,<br> ye hear! Not everywhere in Luluhawa&#39;s safe!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Well...that was a thing that happened.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> No one&#39;s ever asked for my autograph before...</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> Hm, they turned out to be a lovely band of pirates indeed. And now, they have made off with something precious to us.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Yes, it seems we were hasty in our judgment of them.<br> So what did they make off with?</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> Our dignity, of course.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> All right then, I think I&#39;ll be on my way as well, before the king gets a chance to reprimand me...</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> Now where are Sir Gawain and Sir Lancelot? ...Ah, they&#39;re competing to see who can swim back to shore the fastest.</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> I&#39;d better go stop them now,<br> before things get even more out of hand.</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> It was good to see you again, Fujimaru,<br> even if the circumstances were less than ideal.</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> I hope you enjoy your time here in Luluhawa.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I hope all you Round Table guys do, too.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> ...So, does this mean everything worked out?</p><p><strong>A：Martha:</strong><br> Heeey! Ushiwakaaa!<br> Did you find Fujimaru yet!?</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Right.

Now that you&#39;re in my classroom, I will not so much as tolerate absurd, head-in-the-clouds, touristy thoughts like...</p><p><strong>Captain Scáthach:</strong><br> “Oh em gee, I actually shot a gun☆” or “Man, who knew hitting a target eight meters away was this easy!”</p><p><strong>Captain Scáthach:</strong><br> Amateur or not, not one of you will leave this range until you can shoot the wings off a fly!</p><p><strong>Captain Scáthach:</strong><br> You never know what the future may hold.</p><p><strong>Captain Scáthach:</strong><br> A giant meteorite...<br> A zombie plague... Kaiju attacks...</p><p><strong>Captain Scáthach:</strong><br> So I need to prepare you for any and all possible survival scenarios!</p><p><strong>Captain Scáthach:</strong><br> As your captain, I can do no less in repayment for your money. Do not mistake this for a leisure activity!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> What kind of tour have I gotten myself into...</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> It&#39;s certainly unique. I&#39;m told they only hold two a day thanks to their intense training methods.</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> Usually we would have to sign up over a month in advance. We&#39;re lucky Jeanne Alter managed to get us in on such short notice.</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> It&#39;s too bad she had to cancel at the last minute so as not to fall behind on her doujin.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Why isn&#39;t Jeanne Alter here!? She signed us up for this, right!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes, well... I&#39;m afraid Robin stopped her.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> He said he couldn&#39;t let her go with her work falling behind and his pighood on the line.</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong><br> All right, here&#39;s your beginner gear:<br> earplugs, goggles, and hats.</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong><br> The hats are to keep the sun out of your eyes, so feel free to take them off if you don&#39;t need them. But do not forget your earplugs and goggles, or I&#39;ll kill you myself.</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> How do I look, Fujimaru?<br> (Adjusting gear)</p><p><strong>C：Mash:</strong><br> Thank you, but I brought my own!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You&#39;re really fired up for this, Mash...!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I can see you&#39;re enjoying yourself, Bedi...!</p><p><strong>Captain Scáthach:</strong><br> Let&#39;s see... Bedivere, you chose the B Course,<br> forgoing handguns entirely in favor of rifles.</p><p><strong>Captain Scáthach:</strong><br> It seems you have some experience with firearms then. Good call.</p><p><strong>Captain Scáthach:</strong><br> Go on and take the Golt M4 and the RUS47 then.<br> You have forty rounds for each weapon.</p><p><strong>Captain Scáthach:</strong><br> As for Sergeant Kyrielight...<br> I see you&#39;re going with the spec-ops course.</p><p><strong>Captain Scáthach:</strong><br> Heh. You must be hiding a lot of confidence behind that baby face.</p><p><strong>Captain Scáthach:</strong><br> Hmm. So you want to practice the Golt M4, the RUS47, the Springsea M1A, the R-tom M24, the HIAHIA416...</p><p><strong>Captain Scáthach:</strong><br> ...and you want to try firing slugs from the Mu870 too, huh? Along with twenty rounds from the 12GA? Impressive.</p><p><strong>Captain Scáthach:</strong><br> I like your spirit. Go ahead and take the M700 Tactical as well! It&#39;s the hottest sniper rifle in the world right now!</p><p><strong>C：Mash:</strong><br> Roger that! Thank you, Captain!</p><p><strong>Captain Scáthach:</strong><br> That just leaves you, Fujimaru. Let&#39;s see...</p><p><strong>Captain Scáthach:</strong><br> Fifty 9mm rounds with the Shlock 17 handgun, fifty rounds for an MUK25, and thirty 9mm rounds with a rifle...</p><p><strong>Captain Scáthach:</strong><br> What are you, an utter novice?<br> Have you ever fired a gun before? No? I see.</p><p><strong>Captain Scáthach:</strong><br> Then I&#39;ll teach you starting with the basics.<br> By the time we&#39;re done, you&#39;ll be an ace marksman.</p><p><strong>Captain Scáthach:</strong><br> If you do miss the target, I&#39;ll just beat the skill into your skull until your brain leaks out of your ears!</p><p><strong>Captain Scáthach:</strong><br> So as long as you return home alive from this range, you&#39;ll know you&#39;re a competent shot.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Uh... I&#39;m not–</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> ALL the bad feelings about this. All of them.</p><p><strong>Captain Scáthach:</strong><br> Now let&#39;s start with the basics. Right hand on the grip, left hand steadying the right.</p><p><strong>Captain Scáthach:</strong><br> Simple as that may seem, beginners tend to mess this part up. The right hand is only there to hold the grip and pull the trigger.</p><p><strong>Captain Scáthach:</strong><br> The left hand is the one that truly holds the gun. Gripping it with your right hand too strongly makes the barrel drop when you fire.</p><p><strong>Captain Scáthach:</strong><br> Naturally, that affects the bullet&#39;s trajectory, leading to it just carving a furrow in the ground.</p><p><strong>Captain Scáthach:</strong><br> Here&#39;s a couple of extra bullets, on the house.</p><p><strong>Captain Scáthach:</strong><br> Now, first you&#39;re going to get past your nervousness about firing a gun. Then you&#39;re going to learn that hitting the target is harder than it looks!</p><p><strong>Captain Scáthach:</strong><br> I&#39;ve set your first target at fifty meters.<br> That&#39;s the absolute minimum range I&#39;ll permit.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> It&#39;s so small I can barely make it out!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Are you sure this isn&#39;t more of an expert range?</p><p><strong>Captain Scáthach:</strong><br> This is how you stand. Elbows in, legs apart,<br> chest forward. Look at the sight with both eyes.</p><p><strong>Captain Scáthach:</strong><br> Now listen close.<br> Every shot you make irritates me that much more.</p><p><strong>Captain Scáthach:</strong><br> Irritate me enough, and the only way to calm down is to use my Noble Phantasm on whoever&#39;s causing that frustration. Get the picture?</p><p><strong>Captain Scáthach:</strong><br> Now if you want to live to see another sunrise, get to shooting!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I can&#39;t.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Nope, sorry. I&#39;m out.</p><p><strong>Captain Scáthach:</strong><br> Oh? You can&#39;t go through with it? You want to cancel the tour? Well, too bad. Nobody leaves my class in the middle of a lesson.</p><p><strong>Captain Scáthach:</strong><br> I will make you into a great soldier before our three hours are up, whether you like it or not!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I knew I should&#39;ve thought twice before coming here!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> All right, fine! You wanna do this? Let&#39;s do it!</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> Is this all the ammunition you&#39;ve got!?<br> I&#39;m the guardian of Csejte, remember!?</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> You&#39;ll need at least a hundred times more ammo than this if you want to accurately appraise my capabilities!</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> Argh, this is so frustrating!<br> And after I flew all this way to Luluhawa!</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> This is where they remade that famous kaiju movie, right!? So why aren&#39;t there any actual kaiju!?</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> Argh, I&#39;m so pissed! That does it! I&#39;m just gonna blow up the target AND the mountain behind it!</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> If the kaiju aren&#39;t gonna come to Luluhawa, I&#39;ll just have to become a kaiju myself, like the ones in that new flick with the guy looking for his wife!</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong><br> No need to rattle your screws, Steel Demoness. This is no military facility. It is a family shooting range.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong><br> Many here are merely tourists who come for the novelty. Others are avid local gun enthusiasts, here to keep their favorite firearms in shape.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong><br> I myself am here to ensure my own beloved Secace remains in good working order.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong><br> Truly, this shooting range is one of the finest. Between its vast sky, piercing sunlight, and the picturesque sheer cliffs with foaming sea at their base, it is like the set of a blockbuster movie come to life.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong><br> No wonder even the most earnest of maids forgets her duties here.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong><br> There we go.</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> Th-that weapon...! Am I dreaming,<br> or is that really an anti-materiel rifle!?</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong><br> Heh. As if a humble maid would possess such a terrifyingly destructive weapon as that. I already told you. This is my beloved Secace.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong><br> Still, I doubt there are any other gun connoisseurs here with such unusual taste in firearms as mysel–Wait.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong><br> Is that...an authentic eighteenth-century flintlock? That is...astonishingly retro. And yet–</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> Th-that old guy really knows how to use it.<br> He hasn&#39;t missed the bull&#39;s-eye yet!</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> And not only that...it looks like he&#39;s actually making each and every bullet by hand.</p><p><strong>Billy:</strong><br> He sure is, li&#39;l lady. Back in the day, if you had a gun, you were probably making rounds for it.</p><p><strong>Billy:</strong><br> Just put the lead in that little cup there, melt it down, pour the liquid lead into a special mold, and let it cool till you had yourself a bullet.</p><p><strong>Billy:</strong><br> None of those streamlined rounds modern guns fire. Nope, these were more like little metal balls.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong><br> They certainly produce a lot of smoke with each shot fired, too... That aside, that old man&#39;s form is impeccable.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong><br> He keeps leaning back in his chair, making new bullets, then firing them off as if it were second nature to him...</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong><br> I do not think I have even seen his rear end so much as budge in all the rounds he has fired.</p><p><strong>Billy:</strong><br> He must be the last gunslinger of his time. Can&#39;t rightly see what he has to learn from a shootin&#39; range like this...</p><p><strong>Billy:</strong><br> ...but watchin&#39; him lights a fire in me for damn sure. Makes me wanna take him on, gunslinger to gunslinger.</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> ...I think I&#39;ll hold off on my Rocket Punch after all. I wouldn&#39;t feel right using that in front of a gentleman so obviously attached to so old a gun.</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> Efficiency is great, but it isn&#39;t everything. There&#39;s something to be said for putting one&#39;s heart into each and every shot fired.</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> I know that&#39;s the sort of person I&#39;d want piloting me.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Snipers!</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Listen well, my Edison Army elites! Today is the day we finally get to conduct our long-awaited training drill!</p><p><strong>Edison Soldier:</strong><br> Thanks for going to all the trouble to bring this heavy armor to Luluhawa for us, Mr. President.</p><p><strong>Edison Soldier:</strong><br> Is that our target over there?<br> The boards with that guy&#39;s picture on them?</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Of course! I made those boards out of cheap plywood,<br> so they should explode spectacularly!</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Unfortunately, your accuracy with your machine guns is rather poor, since they have to be aimed manually and all.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Which is why I brought in a special instructor!</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> An amazing markswoman who can hit her mark with hardly a thought and without even looking at the target!</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Ms. Artemis!</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong><br> That&#39;s meee☆ Hi, I&#39;m Artemis! Goddess of the moon and the hunt, here on behalf of my darling Orion!</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong><br> If it&#39;s the bow you want to learn,<br> I&#39;ll be glad to teach you everything I know!</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> And as you can see, she&#39;s a real looker, too!<br> A round of applause for Ms. Artemis, men!</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Captain Scáthach may be a harsh teacher, as you can see from her mercilessly prodding Master with her spear, but not Artemis!</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> No, our instructor is the very picture of grace and warmheartedness! Now go on and drink in her volup–er, voluminous techniques!</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Hahaha, money is no object! Go ahead and use as much ammo as it takes! Miss as much as you have to!</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong><br> Who said anything about letting you miss shots? If any of you miss even one, I&#39;ll turn you into a deer and kill you on the spot.</p><p><strong>Edison Soldier:</strong><br> Wat.</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong><br> I&#39;m the legendary goddess of hunting, and proud of it! Nobody&#39;s ruining that reputation on my watch!</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong><br> Oh, and I can still turn you into deer even if you&#39;re machines. In fact, that makes it easier.</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong><br> So make sure to hit those targets like your lives depend on it, okay, guys?</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong><br> Don&#39;t worry, you&#39;ll be fine! Once, when I was bathing in a spring, Darling shot my change of clothes off the branch I&#39;d hung them on from over two mountains away!</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong><br> If he can do that, you should be able to hit the target with your eyes closed and your backs turned!</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong><br> I know you can do this!<br> You just have to believe in yourselves!</p><p><strong>Edison Soldier:</strong><br> Oh God, she really believes that, too! That just adds to the pressure...! Hey, Boss!? Can we cancel this lesson, like, right now!?</p><p><strong>Edison Soldier:</strong><br> If we don&#39;t do something now,<br> we&#39;re going to end up the Deer Head Army!</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> (Suddenly nowhere to be seen)</p><p><strong>Edison Soldier:</strong><br> Edisoooooon!!!</p><p><strong>Captain Scáthach:</strong><br> That&#39;s enough!<br> I see you&#39;ve fired all your ammunition!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> (Thumbs up)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Thank you, Captain!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I just finished the spec-ops course, too!<br> There&#39;s nothing like the feel of actual recoil!</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong><br> Turns out it&#39;s much easier to aim with a rifle than a handgun. Now I know!</p><p><strong>Captain Scáthach:</strong><br> Good. I know I said some things I don&#39;t regret, like<br> “Are you completely incapable of multitasking?”...</p><p><strong>Captain Scáthach:</strong><br> ...“Did you already forget everything I taught you?” “You think you&#39;re the only one exempt from Earth&#39;s gravity!?” and of course “God, you suck!”...</p><p><strong>Captain Scáthach:</strong><br> ...but you all stuck with it and succeeded.<br> I&#39;m proud of you.</p><p><strong>Captain Scáthach:</strong><br> So now, you&#39;re fully accredited marksmen. Well,<br> there&#39;s still one more thing for you to overcome...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Is that what it sounded like...?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> The shooting range completely covered in dust clouds now...?</p><p><strong>Captain Scáthach:</strong><br> Right. The wild chickens really don&#39;t like gunpowder smoke, and they&#39;re about to let us know it.</p><p><strong>Captain Scáthach:</strong><br> Now that this tour is over,<br> it&#39;s up to all of you to defend yourselves.</p><p><strong>Captain Scáthach:</strong><br> Tourists, dismissed! I wish you luck getting through those birds and back to your hotel!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> There&#39;s an army of wild chickens headed this way! Great timing! Now we can go duck–uh, chicken hunting, Senpai!</p><p><strong>C：Mash:</strong><br> This is the perfect chance to put our new training to good use!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I still don&#39;t get why you&#39;re so excited about this!</p><h2 id="interlude-family-flag" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#interlude-family-flag" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Interlude: Family Flag</h2><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I think I&#39;ll take a little break...</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> Good evening, Master.<br> Lovely weather tonight, isn&#39;t it?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Still wearing your swimsuit, huh?</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> Of course. That way, I can go swimming whenever I feel like it.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Are you taking a break too, Jeanne?</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> Yes, I am. I&#39;m just on my way to the beach now.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> Would you care to join me, Master?</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> I must say, Master, you certainly have your work cut out for you every year. First there was that desert island, then a race, and now, ServantFes.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> And since it&#39;s summer, lots of Servants tend to get a little...out of hand.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> Does it just not occur to them to try and conduct themselves more modestly?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You sound like a head prefect...</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> Hehe, a head prefect, huh. As my Ruler self,<br> that might well be what I most closely resemble.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> But right now, I&#39;m an Archer, and I have just a little more freedom than usual!</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> ...Yes, just a little!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> You sound like a mother...</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> I believe you mean “big sister,” right?<br> Riiight?</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> I&#39;m still too young to–I mean,<br> it&#39;s too soon for me to be a parental figure...</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> So I&#39;m perfectly happy sticking with my big sister position!</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> That said, I&#39;m still in perfectly high spirits myself.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> I can tell this place has had a relaxing effect on you too, Master.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> Sure, it looks like there&#39;s something more going on behind the scenes, but never mind that now.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> We&#39;re in Luluhawa!<br> Relaxing is the order of the day!</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> Please, don&#39;t think of me as your Servant here.<br> Let&#39;s see...</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> How about you think of me as your big sister?</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> That way, once it&#39;s time to get back to restoring humanity...</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> ...you can still count on me for any help you need.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> Once you see what a good big sister I am, thanks to all the practice I&#39;ve had with Alter and Alter Lily...</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> ...you&#39;ll be saying, “You&#39;re the best big sister ever!” before you know it!</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> All right, let&#39;s start by holding hands.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> Every good big sister holds hands with her little [♂ brother /♀ sister]!</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> Now let&#39;s go!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> So I guess I have a big sister now.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> And a super reliable one at that!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Sister?</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> No, that doesn&#39;t sound quite right.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> You really must call me “Sis,”<br> or I&#39;ll simply ignore you!</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> ...What&#39;s that?

It looks like it&#39;s going to be another beautiful day in Luluhawa.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Why don&#39;t we start it off with some breakfast?<br> Now what do I feel like today...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...! Did you hear that, Master!?<br> It sounded like it was coming from the buffet!</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> The hell was that sound!?<br> Yo, Master! Come with me!</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> Dammit, how many times have I gotta tell you!?<br> No fighting in the friggin&#39; hotel!</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Om nom nom.<br> (Gulp)</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> ...Okay, let&#39;s get back to it!</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> (Munch, munch)<br> (Glug, glug)</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> ...Ahh, that was delicious.<br> Now, where were we?</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Hehehe.<br> Here&#39;s to a good, clean fight.</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> And by that I mean I&#39;m gonna yank your guts out through your throat and use your entrails to hang you from the nearest Bunyan Fig tree!</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> Ugh. You&#39;re disgusting. People eat here, you know.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> Why can&#39;t you just vaporize your opponents so there&#39;s no mess to clean up, like me?</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong><br> Um, personally, I&#39;d kind of rather you didn&#39;t fight in the dining area at all?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> U-um, excuse me?<br> What&#39;s going on!?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> Didn&#39;t I tell you to cut that shit out!?<br> If you&#39;re gonna fight, take it out to the beach!</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> I&#39;m afraid I can&#39;t do that. I would never be foolish enough to turn my back on an oni.</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Not doing it either. I know her type!</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> She&#39;s the kind of monster who wouldn&#39;t think twice about lying to your face and stabbing you in the back!</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> So? Of course I couldn&#39;t care less about anyone who isn&#39;t Master. What&#39;s your point?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> What&#39;s this all about now?</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> Master!</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> Oh please, help me!<br> I was so scared!</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> I was just defending myself against Ibaraki&#39;s terrifying outburst!</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> No, I was fighting to protect humanity itself!</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> What the hell!?<br> She&#39;s seriously changed her tune here!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I understand how you feel.

Kiyo, have a seat.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> &#39;Kaaay!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I noticed you didn&#39;t come to spy on me today.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> No, though it wasn&#39;t for a lack of trying.<br> Who knew hotels had such good security...</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> ...I&#39;m pretty sure our security ain&#39;t got nothin&#39; on Chaldea&#39;s.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> If you wanna fight, take it to the beach.<br> I&#39;m the one who&#39;s gotta clean up this mess, you know!</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> Now go on, and take Master with you!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> So...why were you fighting, anyway?</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> Well, it went something like this...</p><p><strong>D：Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Hm? Isn&#39;t that...<br> Oh, it&#39;s just the little dragon.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Come on, Ibaraki, you should know better than to go around picking fights.</p><p><strong>E：Kiyohime:</strong><br> ...Little? You&#39;re one to talk.</p><p><strong>E：Kiyohime:</strong><br> What&#39;s an oni who&#39;s been banned from almost everywhere doing in a nice hotel like this?</p><p><strong>E：Kiyohime:</strong><br> Shouldn&#39;t a Berserker like you be staying in a box on the side of the road or something?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> And Kiyohime went and dumped gas on the fire.</p><p><strong>D：Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Hah! Hate to break it to you, but I&#39;m a Lancer now. I&#39;ve got twice as much patience and the same amount of hatred!</p><p><strong>D：Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> I am SO strong right now!<br> I could get used to this Lancer business!</p><p><strong>E：Kiyohime:</strong><br> ...What?<br> A Lancer?</p><p><strong>E：Kiyohime:</strong><br> ...Welp, time for you to die.</p><p><strong>D：Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> How does that make sense!?</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> I trust you see now why that foul oni and I can never possibly get along!</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> You&#39;re just being dumb!</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Come on, Master, I didn&#39;t do anything wrong, right!?</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> ...I-in this...one, very specific case, I mean!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Lancer... Come to think of it,<br> you&#39;re a Lancer now too, aren&#39;t you, Kiyohime?</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> Exactly!</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> That&#39;s exactly the problem!<br> I knew you&#39;d understand, Mash!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> So...you tried to kill her because she&#39;s a Lancer, just like you?</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> Yes, that&#39;s right.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> We&#39;re both Berserkers who became Lancers!<br> We&#39;re far too much alike to be on the same stage!</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> There can be only one!</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> No there can&#39;t! I mean, yes there can!<br> Wait... Uh...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> What about your Noble Phantasms? Those aren&#39;t similar, right?</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Yeah! Our Noble Phantasms are nothing alike!<br> Mine is awesomely fun and flashy and just plain cool!</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> And yours is...<br> Well...</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> I&#39;m not usually one to judge,<br> but isn&#39;t it kinda...grisly?</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> I mean, it&#39;s something you came up with for the person you supposedly love, right?</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> Is that a challenge!?</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Hey, I&#39;m just calling it how I see it!</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> You don&#39;t think my Noble Phantasm is grisly, do you, Master!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> (Pretend not to see her)</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> Hm? My lie-dar is pinging!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> (Whistle nonchalantly)</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> Maaasteeer?</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Compare it to mine! It&#39;s so dazzling you&#39;d never think it belonged to an oni, and it shines even brighter at night.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> True, that Noble Phantasm does seem like it would be most effective at night.</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong><br> That&#39;s perfect then. There&#39;s something I&#39;d like you to help me with this evening.</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Hm?</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> Huh?</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong><br> You see...</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> I can&#39;t believe he wanted us to use our Noble Phantasms to put on a show and spread the word about his hotel.</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Just what does he think oni are, anyway...</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> My Noble Phantasm is only meant for Master...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> (There are far too many ways to interpret that...)</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> Ah, don&#39;t worry &#39;bout it.<br> Just use it once and that&#39;ll be the end of it.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> Luckily, the beach here&#39;s pretty much overrun with crabs and chickens at night.</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Oh, that sounded like a chicken just now.</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Boudica!</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong><br> I know. Don&#39;t worry, the oven&#39;s all warmed up and ready. Just keep them coming.</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> You got it!<br> Just sit back and leave everything to me!</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> All I demand in return is that you save the best parts for me!</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong><br> Yes, yes, I know.</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> All right Master, let&#39;s do this thing!</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Fried chicken, deep-fried chicken, barbecue chicken, rotisserie chicken, chicken sashimi...</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Mwahahaha, this is shaping up to be a decent meal.<br> Now let&#39;s chow down, oni style!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Mwahahaha! Behold!</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> The Fireworks of Mt. Ooe!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> What a beautiful Noble Phantasm...<br> It really is evocative of summer.</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Right?</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Jeanne Alter and Shuten came up with the name for it.</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Jeanne Alter&#39;s contribution was...</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Hm? Isn&#39;t your Noble Phantasm just, uh, what&#39;s it called...</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> ...Raketen Faust, I think?</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> No, no, it&#39;s nothing like that. First my spear turns into five spears, then it turns into a fist...</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> ...then I imagine that they&#39;re Tsuna,<br> and I punch the living hell out of them!</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> And that launches them way up into the air!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Ah, I gotcha. So it&#39;s an Ovaler Schnitt.</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Shuten fiddled around with my Spirit Origin to make it for me. She said if my Spirit Origin was gonna change, my Noble Phantasm oughta change with it!</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> I was so glad she helped...but it really tickled!</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> ...By the way, what language are those words anyway?<br> It sounds really cool.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> German.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> I think if I were gonna name your Noble Phantasm,<br> I&#39;d call it something like...Encomium Moriae.</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Encomium Moriae...!</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> And from Shuten...</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> Hmm...</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> I&#39;m not really sure how one should go about naming a Noble Phantasm...</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> Oh, wait, I just thought of something.<br> Now what was it called again?</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> We didn&#39;t have a word for it back when we were alive. You know, those things that tear off when you twist them, and fall apart if you squeeze them.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> Hmm. What was that called?</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> Anyway, back to Noble Phantasms. If, by some quirk of fate, you find yourself with a new one someday, the question is this: What should you call it?</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> ...Hmm...</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> Well, Ibaraki, like I said,<br> I don&#39;t know much about this stuff...</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> ...but what about something like,<br> I don&#39;t know, The Fireworks of Mt. Ooe?</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> And of course, if you&#39;re gonna call it something like that...</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> ...you&#39;d better make sure it&#39;s as pretty as the real thing, you hear?</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> Listen, Ibaraki.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> Oni like us are supposed to be greedy about everything, you know? It&#39;s in our nature.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> So if there&#39;s two things you want,<br> you have to make sure you get both.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> Sure, you could find one thing you want and hang on to it, or find one person you want and gnaw on them till you&#39;d gobbled up every last bit.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> That&#39;s a nice, simple, modest way of life.<br> All well and good...for people who aren&#39;t us.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> We&#39;re oni. We don&#39;t do modesty or restraint.<br> We take anything and everything we want.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> So if there&#39;s another name you want to add to your hypothetical new Noble Phantasm...</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> ...just add it on top of “Fireworks.”</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> And that is the epic tale of how my new Noble Phantasm got its awesome name!</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Now let&#39;s keep this show going!<br> Kaboom!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Oooh!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Aaah!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Bravo!</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> What&#39;s all that about? We just shout whatever comes to mind when watching fireworks?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> All right, I&#39;mma get in on this too.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> Arthur!</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> Dojo-ji Bell Form 108 - Karyu-nagi!</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> Was that a compliment when you said my bell doubles perfectly as an iron griddle?</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> Oh, I&#39;d better make sure to cook the boar inside all the way through, or dinner could get kind of messy.</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> All right, all done!<br> Boudica! Boudicaaa!</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong><br> Don&#39;t worry, there&#39;s plenty to go around.</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Good, good.</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Still, as yummy as this is, it is getting a little boring having nothing but meat all the time...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I figured you might say that, so I got you some dessert.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Here, have a macaron.</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Ah! I didn&#39;t know you could read minds!</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Guess this means you Masters have to know how to do all sorts of things... Must be rough.</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Believe me, I know how tiring it is, always trying to be considerate and stuff. So don&#39;t worry about that tonight! Tonight, all you and I have to think about is eating as much as we want!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Today was lots of fun too, wasn&#39;t it?</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Eating succulent meat and sweet treats...</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Seeing pretty scenery,<br> going swimming in the wide open sea...</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Hmph, I guess tropical life isn&#39;t too bad. It&#39;s the perfect place to experience all the summer indulgence humans love!</p><h2 id="interlude-play-hard-play-hard" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#interlude-play-hard-play-hard" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Interlude: Play Hard, Play Hard</h2><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Wow! Look at all this open space, Master!</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> It&#39;s as lush and beautiful as any grassy plain I&#39;ve seen!</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> I can&#39;t believe this used to be the inside of a volcano!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou fou!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I&#39;m glad Fou and Ushiwakamaru are enjoying themselves, Senpai. Taking a break outside was a really good idea.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> They do seem to be in high spirits.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> They do look happy about this.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Oh yes. I&#39;ve been happy to devote myself to serving as your bodyguard, Master, but I plan on taking full advantage of this break time!</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> If I&#39;m going to cut loose, then I&#39;m going to cut extremely loose. That&#39;s just who I am right now.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Oh, Master, there&#39;s something I&#39;ve been wanting to try together. Would you join me for it!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Of course!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> What is it?</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Training! What else?</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> I think this will be of great help to you too, Master. Making a book takes a lot of stamina, after all.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> And right now, the teaching of Mt. Kurama closest to my heart is, “Training is play, play is training.”</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> So on that note...<br> Let&#39;s play, Master! (Puppy dog eyes)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Can&#39;t argue with that.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> What are we waiting for?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Catch THIS!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Foutch! ...Fo, fouuu.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Well done, Lord Fou!

But be warned,<br> our playtime is no ordinary playtime.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Here, playing is also training, and vice versa.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> And that means you can come at me with everything you&#39;ve got! I can take you all on without breaking a sweat!</p><p><strong>Kids:</strong><br> &#39;Kaaay! Then here we gooo!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> (Huff...

Lady Mash.<br> Thank you, but I&#39;m not looking to join them.</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> I would hate to inadvertently end up traumatizing the children, after all. Hahaha.</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> No, I was just watching Lord Yoshitsune play.<br> It is...deeply moving for me to see this.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That much...?</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> Of course, I suppose I should be calling her “Lord Ushiwakamaru,” especially now.</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> I think being on this island has helped her get a bit closer to who she used to be back when she was training on Mt. Kurama.</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> ...To the best of my knowledge, she didn&#39;t have many friends back then. At least, none who were human.</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> The only reason she survived was her affinity for nature, animals, and tengu.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> She must have had a wild childhood...</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> But later, when she was commanding us as a warrior for the Genji clan...</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> Well, she still had moments of lighthearted mischief, but she was first and foremost a cold, calculating general who strove for perfection in all of her actions and pursuits.</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> So to see her playing so idyllically with children right before my eyes...</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> ...is a novel, and deeply moving, experience for me.</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> I feel as though I&#39;m seeing another way my most renowned of lords could have turned out.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Benkei...</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Hmm. No sooner do I come to ask Master and Lady Mash if they&#39;re ready to start playing with us again than I see your ugly mug.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> But this works out nicely.<br> You, Kaison, will be my new steed!</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> You want me to give you a shoulder ride? Just like that? And please, my lord, my name is Benkei!</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Oh, was it?<br> Well, no matter. Our next game will be a joust!</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> I was planning to ask Master and Lady Mash to play,<br> but now that you&#39;re here, I won&#39;t have to!</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Now, ride like the wind, Hitachibou!

I will overcome!<br> (Desperately trying to convince himself)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Well...it looks like Benkei&#39;s going to get to enjoy the play-slash-training for himself.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Why don&#39;t we take advantage of this and relax a little longer?</p><h2 id="interlude-loco-moco" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#interlude-loco-moco" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Interlude: Loco Moco!</h2><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:</strong><br> Hmm...</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:</strong><br> To think there was an island so bathed in sunlight this far to the east. What a grand world we inhabit.</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:</strong><br> Now then, since this ServantFes event holds little of interest for one such as myself...</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:</strong><br> ...how should I go about spending my time here...</p><p><strong>Babbage:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:</strong><br> Lord Babbage.</p><p><strong>Babbage:</strong><br> Oh, if it isn&#39;t the samurai from the East.<br> How do you do?</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:</strong><br> Oh, I suppose I cannot complain.<br> How about you? What brings you to these parts?</p><p><strong>Frankenstein:</strong><br> Loco moco! Hehe.<br> We&#39;re all going for some loco moco!</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:</strong><br> Loco moco.</p><p><strong>Babbage:</strong><br> Indeed. Loco moco.</p><p><strong>C：:</strong><br> Fran absolutely insisted, you see, so we&#39;re going to a place that I&#39;m told has excellent loco moco bowls.</p><p><strong>C：:</strong><br> I confess, at the outset of summer, I never imagined I would have a chance to go out for loco moco bowls in Hawaii with just my dear daughter! Oh, and Babbage as well, I suppose.</p><p><strong>C：:</strong><br> And after that, we&#39;ll go play on the beach and enjoy all the sights ServantFes has to offer. What more could a proud papa want?</p><p><strong>C：:</strong><br> The answer, of course, is nothing. Hahaha, with a schedule like this, I will have nary a second to dream up my usual schemes!</p><p><strong>C：:</strong><br> It&#39;s a shame, really, given that a certain dour detective seems to be stuck at Chaldea and therefore unable to interfere in any such dastardly designs.</p><p><strong>Frankenstein:</strong><br> Papa, you&#39;re not going to start scheming again, are you?</p><p><strong>C：:</strong><br> No, no, of course not! Perish the thought, my dear girl! Now then, what say we visit Diamond Head in the afternoon!</p><p><strong>C：:</strong><br> I&#39;m told the view of the beach from up there is positively divine.</p><p><strong>C：:</strong><br> And given this marvelous time we live in, I have no doubt we will be able to reach the peak in some manner of luxurious conveyance! I can&#39;t wait!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> (Disclaimer: The path to Diamond Head&#39;s peak is strictly foot traffic only.)</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> (Please also note that there are no vending machines on the trail, so make sure to bring plenty of water.)</p><p><strong>Frankenstein:</strong><br> Hooray! Loco moco! Diamond Head!</p><p><strong>Babbage:</strong><br> A trip to Diamond Head after a bowl of loco moco, eh. That does sound like a perfect way to spend the day.</p><p><strong>Babbage:</strong><br> I beg your pardon, sir samurai,<br> but we must be on our way.</p><p><strong>Frankenstein:</strong><br> Oh. Want to loco moco with us, mister?</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:</strong><br> I appreciate your invitation, but I was just planning to go for a walk around our lodgings.</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:</strong><br> Heh. Go and enjoy your time as a family.</p><p><strong>Frankenstein:</strong><br> Okay! Thanks, mister!<br> Let&#39;s loco moco together some other time!</p><p><strong>C：:</strong><br> F-Fran? Fran! I don&#39;t know how I feel about you hitting on a man the same age as your papa!</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:</strong><br> It warms my heart to see a family getting along so well.</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:</strong><br> That aside...</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:</strong><br> ...I have not the faintest notion of what loco moco is.</p><p><strong>D：:</strong><br> Oh, Lord Tajima! What an odd coincidence for us to find ourselves on the same island!</p><p><strong>D：:</strong><br> Are you here for ServantFes as well?</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:</strong><br> No. Whatever the reason may be, I do not find these modern events to be to my tastes.</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:</strong><br> And so I have elected to dedicate my time here to more traditional pleasures. What about you?</p><p><strong>D：:</strong><br> I am actually in much the same boat.</p><p><strong>D：:</strong><br> It does seem to be a fun gathering, but as I cannot draw to save my life, I am content to watch as others enjoy themselves.</p><p><strong>D：:</strong><br> Besides, there are plenty of other fun things to do on this island, so I thought it would be best to attempt as many of them as I could.</p><p><strong>D：:</strong><br> Hehe. I have to admit, it is nice,<br> visiting another country like this.</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:</strong><br> Agreed. I can think of few better opportunities for broadening one&#39;s horizons.</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:</strong><br> By way of example, I just learned of two words I had never heard before.</p><p><strong>D：:</strong><br> Oh, really? What were they?</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:</strong><br> Loco moco.</p><p><strong>D：:</strong><br> Loco moco.</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:</strong><br> Indeed. I have also been given to understand that there is something known as a &quot;loco moco bowl.&quot;</p><p><strong>D：:</strong><br> I see. Loco moco bowl, huh.</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:</strong><br> Indeed.</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:</strong><br> The words “loco moco” have a delightful ring to them, but I cannot imagine what they might mean...</p><p><strong>D：:</strong><br> Hm hm...<br> Loco moco... Loco moco bowl...</p><p><strong>D：:</strong><br> They do have a delightful ring to them, yes. Yoshihide would have loved to hear this when he was little.</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:</strong><br> Yes, good point. I can easily imagine young boys happily chanting these words amongst themselves. Shichirou would–</p><p><strong>E：:</strong><br> Forgive me.</p><p><strong>D：:</strong><br> Oh, hello!</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:</strong><br> Hmm. The kunoichi...</p><p><strong>E：:</strong><br> I apologize for employing my Presence Concealment and removing it so suddenly. I am , and I couldn&#39;t help but overhear your conversation.</p><p><strong>E：:</strong><br> I believe you were discussing loco moco?<br> I too have heard of it.</p><p><strong>E：:</strong><br> If you will permit me, I will share what I know.</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:</strong><br> No need for such formalities. We are all Servants under the same Master now. Go on, tell us.</p><p><strong>E：:</strong><br> As you wish.</p><p><strong>E：:</strong><br> Loco moco is the name of one of Luluhawa&#39;s most famous foods.</p><p><strong>D：:</strong><br> Food, is it...?</p><p><strong>E：:</strong><br> It consists of white rice with a hamburger steak and sunny-side egg on top, with a bit of gravy added for additional flavor.</p><p><strong>E：:</strong><br> It is delicious.</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:</strong><br> ...I see.</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:</strong><br> That would explain how such a dish could be served in a bowl.</p><p><strong>E：:</strong><br> Yes, sir. (I would have thought that was obvious,<br> but I&#39;ll keep that to myself.)</p><p><strong>D：:</strong><br> I know of hamburger steak!<br> And sunny-side up eggs, too!</p><p><strong>D：:</strong><br> Lord Emiya and Lady Boudica have made both for me a number of times before. They are delicious!</p><p><strong>D：:</strong><br> Although... Hmm...</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:</strong><br> Is something wrong?</p><p><strong>D：:</strong><br> I am sure this is because it is a Luluhawan specialty, but... Well...</p><p><strong>D：:</strong><br> I had already imagined a loco moco to be a cute, unusual creature indigenous to this exotic land...</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:</strong><br> I see.</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:</strong><br> It is too soon to give up. Loco moco could well be a dish named after such a creature.</p><p><strong>D：:</strong><br> Hey, yeah!</p><p><strong>E：:</strong><br> Um, I&#39;m afraid that is–</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:</strong><br> Well done, . From here on, we shall undertake the quest to uncover the truth of the loco moco ourselves.</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:</strong><br> Your assistance has been invaluable.<br> I am in your debt.</p><p><strong>E：:</strong><br> !!!</p><p><strong>E：:</strong><br> I-I am but a humble kunoichi, my lord, and you are a renowned daimyo. Please, do not bow your head to me...!</p><p><strong>E：:</strong><br> Oh gosh! Forgive me...!</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:</strong><br> Very well then, let us be on our way, Lady .<br> We must solve the riddle of loco moco.</p><p><strong>D：:</strong><br> Right!</p><p><strong>E：:</strong><br> (Maybe I shouldn&#39;t have said anything...)</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Oh? You want to know the origins of loco moco?</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong><br> I&#39;m afraid I don&#39;t know much about Hawaii...</p><p><strong>D：:</strong><br> I see... That&#39;s all right. I am certain we can track down its etymology on our own!</p><p><strong>D：:</strong><br> I am certain that it must be an adorable animal beloved by children everywhere.</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:</strong><br> Indeed.</p><p><strong>Lion &amp; Gentleman:</strong><br> ???</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> Hey guys! It sounds like there&#39;s a really fun discussion going on here. What are you all talking about?</p><p><strong>Lion &amp; Gentleman:</strong><br> (The gentlemen explain.)</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> Loco moco&#39;s origins?</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> Hmm, that&#39;s a tough question...</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> Nobody knows for sure where the words “loco moco” came from. We don&#39;t even know if they originated in Hawaii.</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> What we do know is that they&#39;re well established by now. The first thing that would come to most people&#39;s minds upon hearing them is that dish.</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> It seems not knowing the name&#39;s origin hasn&#39;t stopped it from becoming such a widely popular term...</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> It&#39;s really kind of mystical in its own way when you think about it. ...What brought this up, anyway?</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:</strong><br> Hmm. So its origins are unknown...</p><p><strong>D：:</strong><br> Please cheer up, Lord Tajima.<br> This is actually good news!</p><p><strong>D：:</strong><br> This leaves us with the possibility that it may indeed have once been some sort of cute creature. Perhaps a Phantasmal of some sort!</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:</strong><br> A child of monsters, eh... I see. That would certainly explain its strange yet pleasant-sounding name.</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:</strong><br> Truly, you are possessed of a wondrously flexible mind, Lady . It is no wonder you...</p><p><strong>D：:</strong><br> Hehe. Thank you, Lord Tajima. But this isn&#39;t over yet. Now that we have come this far, we should see this through till the end.</p><p><strong>D：:</strong><br> Maybe one of this island&#39;s elders will know something about it!</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:</strong><br> Very well. Then let us be on our way.</p><p><strong>D：:</strong><br> Great! And let&#39;s ask Lady to join us, too!</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> ...There they go.</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong><br> I can&#39;t seem to recall any creature called a loco moco, in Hawaii or anywhere else, for that matter...</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong><br> ...but I didn&#39;t even get a chance to say so. Hmm.</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> Don&#39;t worry. This is all part of Mahatma!</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> It may be difficult spending all your time looking for the truth of something you&#39;re not even sure exists, but doing it on a trip for a little while can be a lot of fun.</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> And who knows?<br> They might just make a fascinating discovery!</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> Now come on, guys! Let&#39;s go see what new Mahatma we can find here in Luluhawa!</p><p><strong>Lion &amp; Gentleman:</strong><br> Oh crap.

I guess we ended up having lunch kind of late today, didn&#39;t we, Senpai?</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Ah, don&#39;t worry about that. This banana sauce is the best no matter what time of day it is.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> So what shall we do this afternoon? Do we keep working on the book, or maybe go sightseeing?</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Put me down for sightseeing. We could rent a boat,<br> do a little scuba diving, and... Hm?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Well that&#39;s not shady at all...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I&#39;ll try asking him what he wants...</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Yeah, we should probably do something about him. Don&#39;t want him ruining all the other tourists&#39; lunches by making them feel watched.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Hey, you in the hood. We see you there,<br> slinking around the shadows. What gives?</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> ...This doesn&#39;t concern you, Robin Hood.<br> Just forget you ever saw me.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> I am currently on a solo mission for extremely personal reasons that even I don&#39;t fully comprehend.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;m not gonna hurt you guys or any of the other guests.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The problem is, uh...creeping around armed to the teeth like that is a little...menacing on its own.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It makes you look about five times as murderous as usual. Is everything okay, Emiya?</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>G：Emiya:</strong><br> ...Yeah, everything&#39;s fine.<br> It&#39;s just, that family over there&#39;s...</p><p><strong>G：Emiya:</strong><br> ...Never mind, it&#39;s nothing.<br> I&#39;m just making the most of my time in Luluhawa.</p><p><strong>G：Emiya:</strong><br> ...!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Now he&#39;s furious!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> What!? What happened in the last five seconds!?</p><p><strong>G：Emiya:</strong><br> It&#39;s not you guys.<br> It&#39;s those men over there who look so shady...!</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> La la laaa♪</p><p><strong>Ruby:</strong><br> You&#39;re certainly in a good mood, Illya.<br> Was that loco moco really that delicious?</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> It sure was!<br> I&#39;ve never had authentic gravy like that before!</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> Mommy&#39;s loco moco bowls were always yummy,<br> but the loco moco here is yummy too!</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> Right, Chloe!?<br> Right, Caster!?</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> Yeah, it was all right, I guess.</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong><br> Teehee. Yes, I liked it a lot too.</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong><br> I never thought I&#39;d get the chance to try tropical cuisine in this body. Life really is full if surprises.</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong><br> Not to mention I got to meet all of you, too.<br> What a lovely day this is turning out to be.</p><p><strong>Ruby:</strong><br> Yep. Sure are a lot of strange coincidences now and then.</p><p><strong>Ruby:</strong><br> Never would&#39;ve pegged a pretty lady like you a Caster what with you all flustered trying to figure out what to order.</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong><br> Thank you all again. This was a wonderful lunch.</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> Thank YOU! I&#39;m so glad I got to have lunch with you, Caster!</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> Come to think of it, this is the first time Mothe–I mean, Caster and us have all eaten together, isn&#39;t it.</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> Uh-huh!</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> (Oh, Illya. All those times we told her to mind her own business, and she still can&#39;t help herself.)</p><p><strong>Ruby:</strong><br> (Now, now, no harm in talking to new people occasionally, right? Besides, it&#39;s summer vacation!)</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> (Summer vacation?<br> What do you think Chaldea is, a school?)</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong><br> Chloe?</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> Aah! Sorry! It&#39;s nothing...really.</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> Hehe. What&#39;s with the cutesy,<br> shy act all of a sudden, Chloe?</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> M-me, cutesy!?</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong><br> I don&#39;t know if our paths will ever cross again...but this was lovely. Thank you all again. I had a lovely time.</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong><br> Are you all going to ServantFes?</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> Hmm. It looks like a lot of fun, but...<br> (Glance)</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> No thanks. Not my thing.</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> Aww, come on! Can&#39;t we at least go for a little bit to see what it&#39;s like!?</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> Exactly! Vacations like this are a rare opportunity, especially where ServantFes is involved!</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> I know, we can cosplay together!<br> Like they say, if you&#39;ve got it, flaunt it☆</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> And you two have what it takes to dominate! I&#39;d love to see your beast mode up close and personal...!</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> Bring that out, and you could absolutely destroy Medb. You&#39;ll go down as ServantFes legends!</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> (Face that practically screams<br> “Huh? Who&#39;s this creeper?”)</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> Isn&#39;t that right, Ukulele Sensei,<br> talk of the nighttime bar scene?</p><p><strong>Ukulele Star:</strong><br> I can&#39;t speak to that. But I do think it would be wonderful if that older woman there were to join them.</p><p><strong>Ukulele Star:</strong><br> Cosplay is all about contrast. Having a cute cosplayer and a beautiful cosplayer side by side, well...</p><p><strong>Ukulele Star:</strong><br> ...there&#39;s nothing better in my book...</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> (Face that practically screams<br> “Huh? What&#39;s going on”?)</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> You know, you&#39;re right. I was so focused on the little beast in front of me that I lost sight of the HD image.</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> Then on that note, how would you like to join us as well, milady? If it&#39;s a new costume you want, I&#39;ve got volunteers who are more than happy to provide.</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong><br> Oh my, really?<br> Thank you, sirs, that&#39;s very kind of you.</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong><br> Then...perhaps I&#39;ll try dressing up as a magical girl alongside Illya and Chloe.</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> Hooo baby, now you&#39;re talking!</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> All right men, bring me the finest tailor in all of Luluhawa!</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> And step on it, before Master shows up to stop us like some sort of Counter Force! Right, Sensei!?</p><p><strong>Ukulele Star:</strong><br> True... It seems I have no choice but to ride this wave...</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> ...I thought I&#39;d start by offing those guys,<br> if it&#39;s all right with you.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Now I get it. Don&#39;t worry, we won&#39;t stop you.<br> Hell, for this, we&#39;ll even lend you a hand.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> It&#39;d be one thing if those girls volunteered to attend the con, but that&#39;s practically a scam!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Blackbeard may be a lost cause, but I do think that musician could stand to think about what he&#39;s doing...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> If he keeps this sort of thing up,<br> he&#39;ll bring shame to the rest of the Round Table...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> All right.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Let&#39;s do it.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> I&#39;ll separate them from the girls.<br> Lucky I still have some flash bombs.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> Oh, you want to know how they&#39;re used?<br> Like this.</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> What the hell was that!?<br> My eyes! My eyeees!</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> Get ready men, we&#39;re under attack!<br> Dammit, what&#39;s BB&#39;s con staff doing here!?</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> H-huh? What happened to all those people surrounding us?</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> All I know is I saw a bright flash, and then they were gone... I wonder what that was all about.</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong><br> Too bad... I was looking forward to taking a picture of all three of us...</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> No! No way! That would just bring all sorts of deviants out of the woodwork!</p><p><strong>G：Emiya:</strong><br> ...Thanks. I don&#39;t know why that was bothering me so much, but I feel better now.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> All right, I&#39;d better go keep an eye out for any other potential Blackbeards.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> Gotta make sure things stay nice and peaceful around here, after all.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I see Emiya&#39;s going back to tailing...I mean, protecting Irisviel and the others.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I think we all know why Emiya is so nervous,<br> but some things are better left unsaid!</p><h2 id="interlude-full-of-dreams-making-doujin" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#interlude-full-of-dreams-making-doujin" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Interlude: Full of Dreams!

Yup, we&#39;re good.</p><p><strong>C：:</strong><br> Sorry for taking up your time like this when I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve got your own doujin to work on.</p><p><strong>C：:</strong><br> Honestly, I was amazed you agreed to take this on so quickly. I take it things are going well with yours?</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong><br> Hell no.</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong><br> I like to pride myself on my speed, but the number of pages I gotta draw every day is rough, even for me.</p><p><strong>C：:</strong><br> Then I really don&#39;t get why you agreed to do this guest art. Why didn&#39;t you just say no?</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong><br> Oh, that? More often&#39;n not, you work faster by mixin&#39; it up while you&#39;re takin&#39; a break.</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong><br> &#39;Course, I expect takin&#39; a break from drawin&#39; one art project ta work on another might be weird...</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong><br> ...but that&#39;s just how we painter types are.<br> Nothin&#39; we can do about it.</p><p><strong>C：:</strong><br> So that&#39;s how it is, huh? Well anyway, you helped me out a ton. I&#39;ll send you a sample book as soon as they&#39;re ready.</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong><br> Sounds great.</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong><br> All right, guess I&#39;d better get back ta my doujin...</p><p><strong>C：:</strong><br> Hmm.

Heh heh heh...</p><p><strong>C：:</strong><br> With name recognition like this, even an anthology of guest contributions&#39;ll sell in the millions.</p><p><strong>C：:</strong><br> If I price it at (mumble), I can pay all my guest contributors and still come away with...</p><p><strong>C：:</strong><br> Hahaha! I just can&#39;t stop smiling!</p><p><strong>C：:</strong><br> I&#39;m so glad I didn&#39;t agree to pay them a percentage of the proceeds. &#39;Course, it helps that I only asked people I knew would never ask for that.</p><p><strong>C：:</strong><br> Nobody loses! I didn&#39;t have to lie, and it&#39;s not even illegal. It&#39;s perfect! Everyone comes out of this happy!</p><p><strong>C：:</strong><br> And I don&#39;t have to write a single page myself.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> W-well...I suppose, technically,<br> he&#39;s still putting in hard work...</p><p><strong>C：:</strong><br> I can&#39;t believe how easy it is to make money off other people&#39;s work these days.

Who knew office work could be this much fun!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> He&#39;s totally ripping off his guest contributors, isn&#39;t he?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I think we have to do something about this.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> You&#39;re... You&#39;re right. If he plans to sell his book based on the fame of his contributors, they deserve a fair share of the proceeds.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I have no problems with an editor being fairly compensated for their work...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...but that doesn&#39;t give one the right to treat their writers and artists unfairly.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I just hope all the contributors can still make that sort of contract with him...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Times like this, we need the Man in Red.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Times like this, we need a good lawyer.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes, I agree.

Our club, The One Thousand and One Night Offerings Collective&#39;s doujin has been proceeding well so far...but this is where it really gets interesting.</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> We need to eat lots of good food now so we&#39;ll have the strength to face the challenges ahead.</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> We certainly can&#39;t live off protein bars and energy drinks, like that weird bat girl.

What can I get for you?<br> Perhaps several of our most expensive items?</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> You work here? I could have sworn I saw you in a different restaurant...</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong><br> Heh. When you reach my level of excellence, you are able to write your own ticket, so to speak. Any number of establishments will seek your skills.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong><br> In addition to waiting tables, I am also a master chef and a fastidious cleaner. Suffice to say, there is much more to me than my penchant for popsicles.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong><br> Now, what will it be? If nourishment is what you need, I recommend the Hawaiian Burger Combo Meal.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong><br> The burger is too well prepared to offer much sustenance, but the mountain of fries that comes with it is cooked in delicious oil, and will ensure you leave with full bellies.</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> I see. Well, in that case...</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> I know, right! That page is some of my best work,<br> if I do say so myself!</p><p><strong>C：:</strong><br> Yes, the expressions were masterfully done.<br> I was very impressed...</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> Hehehe. And personally, I think I did a pretty good job on the other parts, too!</p><p><strong>C：:</strong><br> (She must be talking about the Pharaoh Phun Phacts she snuck into the corners of each page.)</p><p><strong>C：:</strong><br> (The sheer passion she puts into those is certainly something...)</p><p><strong>C：:</strong><br> (I couldn&#39;t believe my eyes when I first noticed the panel frames were actually tiny verses extolling the pharaohs&#39; praises. Of course, even if the readers happen to notice, they&#39;ll need magnifying glasses to read them...)</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> Okay! Now that we&#39;ve had our meal,<br> let&#39;s return to our room and get back to work!</p><p><strong>C：:</strong><br> Yes, I suppose we should.<br> Excuse me, could we have the check, please?</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong><br> Coming right up, young ladies.<br> I am glad you enjoyed the food.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong><br> This is the outrageous price you must pay for your meal of unhealthy junk food made from healthy Hawaiian ingredients.</p><p><strong>C：:</strong><br> Um, yes, all right.<br> (Paying the exact amount shown on the bill)</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>C：:</strong><br> ...? (Why did she draw her rifle instead of going to the register...?)</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong><br> I think there may be some mistake here, young ladies.<br> It is clear for all to see that you are royalty.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong><br> As such, I believe an appropriate gratuity would be thirty percent, yes?</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> Oh, r-right, I&#39;m sorry. Come on partner,<br> you should know better than that.</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> Let&#39;s see... Will this take care of it?</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong><br> ...Fantastic. Very well then, have a wonderful vacation. R.I.P.</p><p><strong>C：:</strong><br> Why did you give her that extra money just now?<br> Was it a bribe for her to spare our lives...?</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> No, no, it was her tip. I know they don&#39;t do this where we come from, but in Western countries like the United States, it&#39;s customary to pay waiters a percent of your bill as a tip. Required, even.</p><p><strong>C：:</strong><br> I see... I had no idea...</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> I was surprised when I first learned about it too.</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> But after thinking it over, I realized it was no different from offering a word of praise to the servants who would fan me all day on top of paying their salaries.</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> In that sense, it&#39;s an excellent opportunity to show off the generosity of the pharaohs!</p><p><strong>C：:</strong><br> I see... So, how much are you required to give them?</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> How much money, you mean? It depends.</p><p><strong>C：:</strong><br> ...!</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> I heard that it tends to be around ten to twenty percent of the total bill.</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> Oh, but in fancy restaurants like this one, it&#39;s more common to tip twenty to twenty-five percent, so that&#39;s what I did just now.</p><p><strong>C：:</strong><br> Y-you&#39;re kidding... Then, there&#39;s no telling how much money you might be required to spend!?</p><p><strong>C：:</strong><br> That&#39;s horrifying.<br> I could wind up dead...well, financially!</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> I didn&#39;t say anything when we left our room because I thought you already knew, but...you&#39;re actually supposed to tip housekeeping too.</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> That&#39;s why I left that bill on top of the bed.</p><p><strong>C：:</strong><br> N-now that you mention it, you did, didn&#39;t you! I just thought that was some sort of ritual peculiar to the pharaohs...</p><p><strong>C：:</strong><br> Incidentally, what would happen if one forgot to tip?</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> Well, it&#39;s very rude not to, so I imagine housekeeping would be fairly upset.</p><p><strong>C：:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> I&#39;m upset.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> Clarent Blood Arthur!</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong><br> I&#39;m upset too.</p><p><strong>Hyde:</strong><br> Hahahaaa! I can&#39;t hold back anymooore!</p><p><strong>C：:</strong><br> That would be fatal!</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> Wh-where&#39;s this coming from!?</p><p><strong>C：:</strong><br> Hurry, we need to get back to our room before housekeeping arrives.</p><p><strong>C：:</strong><br> Now I understand. The most dangerous thing to beware in this country is death by insufficient tipping...!</p><p><strong>C：:</strong><br> I had no idea this custom was so critical to one&#39;s survival... I&#39;ll need to be more careful in the future...</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> ...</p></div><!--[--><!--]--></div><footer class="page-meta"><div class="meta-item edit-link"><a class="external-link meta-item-label" href="https://github.com/r-grandorder/tri-hermes/edit/main/src/Events/2020/summer3.md" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" aria-label="Help us improve this page!"><!--[--><!--]--> Help us improve this page! <span><svg class="external-link-icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewbox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path><polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg><span class="external-link-icon-sr-only">open in new window</span></span><!--[--><!--]--></a></div><div class="meta-item last-updated"><span class="meta-item-label">Last Updated: </span><!----></div><div class="meta-item contributors"><span class="meta-item-label">Contributors: </span><span class="meta-item-info"><!--[--><!--[--><span class="contributor" title="email: 59034871+Fgrandorder@users.noreply.github.com">Lib</span><!----><!--]--><!--]--></span></div></footer><!----><!--[--><!--]--></main><!--]--></div><!----><!--]--></div>
