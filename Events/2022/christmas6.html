What&#39;s with all the festive red an&#39; green decorations here? I didn&#39;t even notice &#39;em goin&#39; up.</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong><br> Pretty sure this ain&#39;t one of Toto-sama&#39;s messes... This some kinda special Chaldea tradition thing?</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong><br> Ohhh, yeah, I remember now. There&#39;s some holiday near the end of the year, ain&#39;t there?</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong><br> I think it&#39;s–</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong><br> Door&#39;s open! C&#39;mon in!</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong><br> If you&#39;re here about a commission, I&#39;m already booked through the year, so I don&#39;t know if I&#39;ll be able ta squeeze ya in, but I can at least hear ya out.</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong><br> Who knows? Maybe you&#39;ll have a subject so enticin&#39; it&#39;ll make me wanna push all my other jobs back!</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong><br> Huh?</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong><br> Damn, I may just be a painter, but even I can tell this is serious. &#39;Kay, pal. Whaddya want?</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Isn&#39;t it obvious?</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> I want to give you a present.<br> Here. Merry Christmas.</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong><br> !?!?!?</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> My apologies for the intrusion. And once again: Merry Christmas.</p><p><strong>Scáthach-Skadi:</strong><br> ...!?</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> I hope you&#39;re doing well.<br> I&#39;m here to bring you a present.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> Aah! What do you care how I&#39;m doing, assface!?<br> You want a piece of me or something!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Senpai, we&#39;ve been accompanying Karna on his rounds for a while now...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> So speaking as a seasoned C-Pro*, how do you think<br> he&#39;s been doing?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I think he&#39;s doing great.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I agree. Karna always takes everything<br> he does seriously...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...so I had a feeling she&#39;d make a great Santa.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> But...I do think he may be coming<br> across a little, um, somber?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Hmm. I guess he might be coming on a little strong?</p><hr><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> I am aware. Many people are understandably on edge when receiving an unexpected guest in their rooms.</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> Hmm. Maybe I should announce who I am the moment I open the door, so they don&#39;t find me suspicious.</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> Perhaps something like,<br> “Nobody move. Santa Claus is here.”</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> (He&#39;s on the right track, but that still sounds like some kind of raid...)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Maybe he just needs to smile more?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes, I think so too.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That said...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Well, some of our Santas have been...more inclined to smile than others, so I think everyone&#39;s used to it.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> So smiling could just be a bonus of sorts.</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> Smiling, huh.<br> ...I&#39;ll give it a shot.</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> Even though I have officially inherited the position,<br> I still have much to learn about the ways of Santa.</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> If there are areas in which I have room to improve,<br> then I must pursue them aggressively.</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> To that end, I am prepared to endure any manner of training, no matter how difficult or strenuous.</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> I suppose that means I&#39;ll also need to spar against opponents who can provide an appropriate challenge.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You&#39;re sounding a lot more like a boxer than a Santa.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Sounds more like something a heavyweight contenderwould say than a gift-giver.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I agree, Senpai. In fact, that reminds me of something Aśvatthāman said earlier...</p><p><strong>Aśvatthāman:</strong><br> Yo, Karna! I heard all about it!</p><p><strong>Aśvatthāman:</strong><br> Sounds like you got stuck with a hell of a gig this year!</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> Heh. I don&#39;t know if I would describe it like that, but I am honored to be entrusted with such a rewarding task.</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> Now that I have, it is only right that I should endeavor to carry it out to the best of my ability.</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> I&#39;m glad to see you&#39;re in high spirits as usual, too, Aśvatthāman.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> (Now they&#39;re punching each other&#39;s palms as if they were kids.)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> (Almost feels like I&#39;m watching a coupleof kids roughhousing in the hall.)</p><hr><p><strong>Aśvatthāman:</strong><br> Hah, well look at you. Reminds me of the good old days.</p><p><strong>Aśvatthāman:</strong><br> I remember we used to be so eager to practice any new moves we learned that we&#39;d spend the rest of the day beating the shit out of each other with &#39;em.</p><p><strong>Aśvatthāman:</strong><br> Duryodhana&#39;d get tired of it and bail after a while...but you always stuck around till I was good and satisfied.</p><p><strong>Aśvatthāman:</strong><br> Thanks to that, I think I had more bruises than skin!</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> Of course. We didn&#39;t have time to rest; we were too busy bettering ourselves. Those were good days.</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> And now, we have all new good days.</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> On that note, I&#39;d better start visiting rooms.<br> I have presents to deliver, after all.</p><p><strong>Aśvatthāman:</strong><br> ...?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> So what do you think of Karna as Santa, Aśvatthāman?</p><hr><p><strong>Aśvatthāman:</strong><br> Oh, hey, Master. Didn&#39;t see you there.</p><p><strong>Aśvatthāman:</strong><br> Anyway, you wanna know what I think of him as Santa? I think it&#39;s godsdamn awesome. He seems like his old self again.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> What do you mean?</p><p><strong>Aśvatthāman:</strong><br> Don&#39;t get me wrong, he&#39;s still the same guy at heart.<br> It&#39;s just that... Hmm, how to put this...?</p><p><strong>Aśvatthāman:</strong><br> Now that he&#39;s become Santa, something new and unfamiliar to him, it&#39;s got him thinking he needs to train again...</p><p><strong>Aśvatthāman:</strong><br> ...which has him thinking like he did back in the days he was training nonstop.</p><p><strong>Aśvatthāman:</strong><br> Back then, he was stoic, earnest as all hell...</p><p><strong>Aśvatthāman:</strong><br> ...and so hell-bent on improving himself that he&#39;d pull off the craziest shit before you even knew what he was doing.</p><p><strong>Aśvatthāman:</strong><br> Come to think of it, he even pretended to be a brāhmana at some point so he could learn from his old man&#39;s teacher.</p><p><strong>Aśvatthāman:</strong><br> Got his ass whooped for it something fierce, but he didn&#39;t care. I still don&#39;t know how it all went down myself, but I bet if you asked him about it, he&#39;d just say something like:</p><p><strong>Aśvatthāman:</strong><br> “I never lied. I just never told them I wasn&#39;t.”</p><p><strong>Aśvatthāman:</strong><br> Anyway, I&#39;m guessing that kind of devotion to training is what made him like a boxer, since that&#39;s the closest analogue in the modern day.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I see...</p><hr><p><strong>Aśvatthāman:</strong><br> It&#39;ll probably change how he gets along with the other Servants, too. Hell, with Arjuna, he might just–</p><p><strong>Aśvatthāman:</strong><br> ...On second thought, never mind.<br> I got no idea how that might shake out.</p><p><strong>Aśvatthāman:</strong><br> Anyway, that little workout made me hungry.</p><p><strong>Aśvatthāman:</strong><br> I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll have plenty of other chances to spar with him now that he&#39;s back in training mode, so for the moment, I&#39;m gonna grab a bite at the cafeteria.</p><p><strong>Aśvatthāman:</strong><br> ...Anyway, my point is, he&#39;s still a Servant here at Chaldea. That much hasn&#39;t changed.</p><p><strong>Aśvatthāman:</strong><br> He might say some weirder things than usual, but don&#39;t worry about it. Deep down, he&#39;s still Karna. Later!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> We&#39;ve seen him deliver a number of presents since that conversation now, and Aśvatthāman was right.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Really, when you think about it,<br> we shouldn&#39;t be surprised.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> He&#39;s certainly not the first Servant at Chaldea to have a new Spirit Origin affect their interests and tastes.</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> Come on, Master and Mash. I still have a great deal of presents to hand out and roadwork for my training!</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> Be warned, I won&#39;t wait around for you if you can&#39;t keep up. You can always use a trainer bicycle if you need to.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It sounds like his training is about to get serious.<br> Shall we keep following him, Senpai?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Sure thing!</p><hr><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> Swish! Swish!<br> ...Okay, here we are.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> (Huff... Huff...)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Now I wish I&#39;d taken the bike after all...</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Are you okay, Senpai? Here, have some water.<br> Do you want some too, Karna?</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> Thank you, but no thank you. Water is one of the worst things you can have if you&#39;re focusing on weight control.</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> Please, give Master my share.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> W-well, all right, if you say so.</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> Now, let&#39;s go in and deliver this present.</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> Let&#39;s see... I need to smile, and I need to explain what it is I&#39;m doing here. Okay.</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> Freeze! Do you see this smile?<br> Remain still and this will be over shortly!</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong></p><h1 id="gyaaah-a-burglar" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#gyaaah-a-burglar" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Gyaaah!

You can&#39;t just go barging into a delicate young otomaiden&#39;s room like that, you know?</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> I&#39;m sorry. I guess that wasn&#39;t the right Santa move.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Well, I don&#39;t think I&#39;d really know the chigai, to tell you the truth.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Anyway, we&#39;ve got a guy Santa this year, huh? That&#39;s a breath of fresh air.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> My understanding is that Santa has traditionally been a male figure...but yes, around here, it is.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Hey, as long as I get a gift,<br> I don&#39;t care who I get it from.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> In fact, I can already tell what it is!</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> That&#39;s the latest volume by Tentacle Iron Bar, isn&#39;t it!? It has to be! I put it on the wish list I stuffed into my stocking and everything!</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> Heh. Worry not. Santa&#39;s job is to<br> make wishes come true, after all.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> (Huh? It&#39;s pitch black? That doesn&#39;t look like any of the more Christmassy gifts he&#39;s handed out so far...)</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Yaaay! Arigathanks!</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> ...Huh? I can&#39;t get it open.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Seriously, what am I supposed to do with this thing!?</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> I&#39;ve tried a box cutter, scissors...

I wasn&#39;t planning to eat you just yet, since you still need to be prepped and seasoned...</p><p><strong>Vritra:</strong><br> ...but I suppose there wouldn&#39;t be anything wrong with having a little taste.</p><p><strong>==ARROW==</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Khh!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> (No wonder this evil dragon could go toe to toe with a god!)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> (She&#39;s so strong!)</p><hr><p><strong>Vritra:</strong><br> Oho, you&#39;re really struggling, aren&#39;t you?<br> Mmm, now I&#39;m getting really hungry.</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> Does this mean my Santa fists still aren&#39;t heavy enough!?</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> ...Huh?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Karna! See that distortion in front of you!? I&#39;m betting that&#39;s the core of this occluded Singularity!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> You should be able to disable it with one good hit!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> That should also knock out the field Vritra created, which might weaken her!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Karna!

I&#39;ll give it a shot.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Phew, I can breathe a lot easier now...</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Does this mean the occluded Singularity turned back into a normal minute Singularity?</p><p><strong>Vritra:</strong><br> Oho. So you managed to destroy the foundation of my dam world with your fist.</p><p><strong>Vritra:</strong><br> Ahh, you really should quit while you&#39;re ahead.<br> You already seem plenty delicious.</p><p><strong>Vritra:</strong><br> Truly, I don&#39;t know what I&#39;m going to do with you.</p><p><strong>Vritra:</strong><br> Still...I think that&#39;s enough for today. I don&#39;t want to gobble you up before you&#39;ve fully ripened.</p><p><strong>Vritra:</strong><br> If you want to lure me back out, I suggest you make yourselves as delectable as possible.</p><p><strong>Vritra:</strong><br> Do that, and...<br> Keeheehee!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> ...She&#39;s gone. Vritra&#39;s signal has completely disappeared.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I&#39;m sorry. I shouldn&#39;t have let her get away...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Don&#39;t worry about it.

Then yes, it seems like our only choice is to erase these occluded Singularities one by one.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Of course, we may run into Vritra<br> again while we&#39;re doing that...</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> If we do, then I&#39;ll defeat her.<br> That&#39;s all there is to it.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> (That&#39;s definitely the right idea, but much easier said than done when we&#39;re talking about an evil dragon the likes of Vritra...)</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> (Especially with the Rayshift restrictions these occluded Singularities have in place.)</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> (We might have to make some tough decisions about who to bring along to raise our chances of victory.)</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> (Luckily, not only do we have several Servants with ties to Indra, we also have a bunch of legendary dragon-slayers.)</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> (All we have to do now is come up with a plan that takes advantage of those assets!)</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> (That&#39;s definitely the right idea, but much easier said than done when we&#39;re talking about an evil dragon the likes of Vritra...)</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> (Especially with the Rayshift restrictions these occluded Singularities have in place.)</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> (We might have to make some tough decisions about who to bring along to raise our chances of victory.)</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> (Luckily, not only do we have several Servants with ties to Indra, we also have a bunch of legendary dragon-slayers.)</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> (All we have to do now is come up with a plan that takes advantage of those assets!)</p><p><strong>Vritra:</strong><br> Mmm, I can&#39;t wait! I simply can&#39;t wait!</p><p><strong>Vritra:</strong><br> At first, I thought it would just be an amusing change of pace to block the concept of Christmas presents instead of water.</p><p><strong>Vritra:</strong><br> But now, I&#39;ve been rewarded for my efforts with some of the tastiest looking morsels I&#39;ve seen in a long time.</p><p><strong>Vritra:</strong><br> ...Come to think of it, I thought I sensed another with an aura like Indra&#39;s as well...</p><p><strong>Vritra:</strong><br> Well, no matter. That can be tomorrow&#39;s delight to look forward to. Ahh, this is so exciting.</p><p><strong>Vritra:</strong><br> Yes, that&#39;s it. Suffer.

As heroes of India,<br> it&#39;s our responsibility to handle her.</p><p><strong>Pārvatī:</strong><br> I expect that&#39;s even more true for you, Arjuna...</p><p><strong>Pārvatī:</strong><br> ...seeing as you&#39;re the son of Indra, the Vritrahan–the deity who famously slew Vritra.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> ...Yes, it is.</p><p><strong>Pārvatī:</strong><br> That said... Nnn. So Vritra&#39;s been going after Christmas presents, huh?</p><p><strong>Pārvatī:</strong><br> Obviously, we can&#39;t let her get away with that,<br> but for some reason...</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> Is there something you&#39;re worried about, Lady Pārvatī?</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> If you plan on going after her, I&#39;ll gladly accompany you to the depths of hell if necessary.</p><p><strong>Pārvatī:</strong><br> I don&#39;t know if I&#39;d say I&#39;m worried per se.<br> It&#39;s more like...

But, this is Vritra we&#39;re talking about.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> The same evil dragon who stole water from the human world and brought a plague of drought upon the land.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> The king of the Asuras who will always return to wreak havoc on humankind, no matter how many times the gods may defeat her.</p><p><strong>Pārvatī:</strong><br> Yes, I do understand that...<br> But, well, this is about Christmas.</p><p><strong>Pārvatī:</strong><br> So, this time, I think I need to stay out of it.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> ...?</p><p><strong>Pārvatī:</strong><br> Oh, but that doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m going to stop you from going after her.</p><p><strong>Pārvatī:</strong><br> In fact, I&#39;m hoping you&#39;ll do everything you can to resolve this situation in my stead.</p><p><strong>Pārvatī:</strong><br> But of course, that means you&#39;ll need to work WITH people, not try to handle it all on your own. Understand?</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> S-so then, you mean–</p><p><strong>Pārvatī:</strong><br> That&#39;s right. If Vritra is attacking Santa, then the most effective way to defeat her is to support Santa directly, don&#39;t you think?</p><p><strong>Pārvatī:</strong><br> So I&#39;m counting on you to help Karna in my stead.<br> Okay, Arjuna?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Good.

Santa has always been at home in wintry environments. If anything, this scenery is even more evocative of a white Christmas.</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> It&#39;s also the perfect environment for roadwork. The harder the routine, the stronger my mind will become.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> I&#39;m...glad you&#39;re looking on the bright side?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Just try not to be too hard on<br> Fujimaru, okay?</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> Of course.

Me.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> As the son of Indra, it is my duty to stop Vritra&#39;s evil deeds wherever she should rear her head.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> I&#39;m also here on behalf of Lady Pārvatī,<br> who asked me to fight in her stead.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> That is all to say that I am not in any way, shape, or form here to help...him.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> Besides, protecting their Master, even at the cost of life or limb, is a Servant&#39;s greatest duty.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> So, as the greatest Servant of all time, it simply makes sense that I am here to do so.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> U-uh, thanks?</p><hr><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> You&#39;re welcome.<br> (Obviously proud)</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> I never thought the day would come when you and I would be fighting side by side, Arjuna.</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> Go on. Raise your fist.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> Huh? ...I see. Then you really are focused on boxing right now.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> Very well then.<br> Is that all right with you, Master?</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> If Karna wishes to fight me,<br> I&#39;m happy to accept his challenge.</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> As fun as that sounds, I&#39;m Santa right now.<br> This is just how boxers say hello.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> D-did you see that, Master!?<br> This cannot stand! It cannot!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Seems fine to me.</p><hr><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> Then I&#39;m not sure you understand<br> the severity of the problem.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> Don&#39;t you see?<br> Karna is doing things he normally would not!</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> Can you imagine him just...just...lightly bumping my fist like that under normal circumstances? I certainly can&#39;t!</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> This can only mean that him becoming Santa has radically elevated his spirits!</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> How am I supposed to respond to this!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> What about just, you know...acting normal?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> According to Aśvatthāman,<br> Karna is acting younger than usual...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...because he&#39;s now in the same state of<br> mind he was during his training days.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> ...I see. So he&#39;s back to the way he was when we were both studying under Droṇa. I think I understand... I think.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> Khh. At any rate, the fact remains that there&#39;s no telling what he might do next while he&#39;s like this.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> I&#39;ll need to pay even closer attention to him than usual!</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> If you want to spar with me, little boy,<br> I&#39;ll take you on anytime.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> Of course I don&#39;t! And don&#39;t call me<br> “little boy”! You&#39;re creeping me out!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Uh, last, but certainly not least, we needed a Servant<br> who would be a good match for a large evil dragonkin like Vritra.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Luckily, Chaldea has several famed dragon-slayers to choose from, so we plan on assigning each of them to a different Singularity.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> This way, each one can give everything they&#39;ve got for their given Singularity without worrying about exhausting themselves for the others.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> We call it “Operation Daily Dragon-Slayer”!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> And for the first day, he was the obvious choice.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Uh, last, but certainly not least, we needed a Servant<br> who would be a good match for a large evil dragonkin like Vritra.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Luckily, Chaldea has several famed dragon-slayers to choose from, so we plan on assigning each of them to a different Singularity.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> This way, each one can give everything they&#39;ve got for their given Singularity without worrying about exhausting themselves for the others.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> We call it “Operation Daily Dragon-Slayer”!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> And for the first day, he was the obvious choice.</p><p><strong>Sigurd:</strong><br> I am Sigurd.

I expect we should be able to work together nicely, since this won&#39;t be our first time traveling together.</p><p><strong>Sigurd:</strong><br> We may not have numbers on our side, but we do have skill and strength. I am certain we will do fine.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I know you will!</p><hr><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> All right then, everyone take care, and let&#39;s get this mission started!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> All right then, everyone take care, and let&#39;s get this mission started!</p><p><strong>==ARROW==</strong></p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> ...I see.

Saves me the trouble of taming you.</p><p><strong>Vritra:</strong><br> You are both a demon of a familiar sort to me and an empty shadow these morsels know well.</p><p><strong>Vritra:</strong><br> So I wasn&#39;t entirely sure you&#39;d be willing to obey commands, even if you are fundamentally incapable of disobedience.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> A shinobi is obligated to obey their master.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> However... I understand I am no more than a copy of my true self, but even so, there is something I must say:</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> This is a foolish idea.</p><p><strong>Vritra:</strong><br> Oh?</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> If you think Master and [♂ his /♀️ her] companions will hesitate<br> to attack someone they know, you are gravely mistaken.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> They are true warriors who have survived innumerable life-and-death battles.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> So I can say with absolute certainty...</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> ...that they would never hold back against an opponent simply because that opponent bears a familiar face!</p><p><strong>Vritra:</strong><br> Oh? Well, I look forward to seeing that for myself.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> That being said, I am well aware that you are my master now, and I have no intention of betraying you.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> I invite you to watch the battle and witness for yourself where my loyalties lie!</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> (Ugh, I swear. Why did she have to copy my mind as well as my body?)</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> (All that&#39;s doing is making it harder for me to serve her...)</p><p><strong>Vritra:</strong><br> Oh, by the way.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Yes?</p><p><strong>Vritra:</strong><br> You are dressed in your shrine maiden outfit right now, are you not? Well, it&#39;s my understanding that shrine maidens frequently dance.</p><p><strong>Vritra:</strong><br> I&#39;m actually quite fond of the performing arts. You may dance for me, if you like.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> With all due respect, my lady, I never dance except at festivals and Shinto rites.</p><p><strong>Vritra:</strong><br> Hmph. Well you&#39;re no fun.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> (Huff... Huff...)</p><hr><p><strong>Georgios:</strong><br> Are you all right, Master?</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong><br> When traversing slippery terrain, it&#39;s best to grip the ground with the entire sole of your foot.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> Remember, there&#39;s no need to hurry.<br> Just take it one careful step at a time.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> Oh, and also–</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> Here, Master, I&#39;ll carry your bag for you.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Uh, th-thanks.</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> No problem. I was just thinking some weight would help make this training more intense. It has been lacking so far.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> That&#39;s okay. I can manage.</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> Even so, there&#39;s no harm in lightening your load when you&#39;re coming up on a match.</p><hr><p><strong>Georgios:</strong><br> A fair point.</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong><br> This route may be treacherous, but so far, there appear to be no hostile–Hm?</p><p><strong>Sigurd:</strong><br> Master, get behind me!</p><p><strong>Sigurd:</strong><br> Hmm. Those were frozen cherry blossom petals.<br> They must have been carried here on the wind.</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong><br> Well, that could only happen in this frozen Singularity.</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong><br> Unfortunately, at that speed and sharpness,<br> even flower petals can cut as keenly as knives.</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong><br> We&#39;ll have to watch out for more of these ice blossom blizzards as we make our way towards our target.</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong><br> And we must especially ensure<br> that no harm comes to Master.</p><p><strong>Sigurd:</strong><br> Understood. Then these ice blossom blizzards are the first major threat we face. Hmm... Is “ice blizzard” redundant?</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> This world can throw as many Blizzard Blossom Punches at us as it likes. I&#39;ll counter every last one of them.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> ...Can we at least agree on the name first?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> You&#39;re all doing wonderfully, everyone.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Even with the increased frequency of these blizzards, you&#39;ve been fending off the petals with aplomb!</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong><br> I suppose I should have expected no less from such capable Heroic Spirits. Clearly, there is no need for me to issue specific orders.</p><p><strong>Sigurd:</strong><br> Heh. That is kind of you to say, Lord Georgios, but your travel experience still puts mine to shame.</p><p><strong>Sigurd:</strong><br> I will have to pass your teachings on to my beloved as well, so that we may one day put them to use on a trip where it is just the two of us.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Great work, guys! You should be arriving at the Singularity core pretty soon now.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> ...Huh? What&#39;s this signal?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Great work, guys! You should be arriving at the Singularity core pretty soon now.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> ...Huh? What&#39;s this signal?</p><p><strong>Vritra:</strong><br> So, you&#39;ve come.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It&#39;s Vritra! Be on your guard, everyone!</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> I see. So that&#39;s her...</p><p><strong>Vritra:</strong><br> Hm?<br> (Sniff, sniff...)</p><p><strong>Vritra:</strong><br> Keeheehee!<br> I&#39;d recognize the scent of that blood anywhere!</p><p><strong>Vritra:</strong><br> You&#39;re descended from Indra, aren&#39;t you, child?</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> Don&#39;t you call me a child, serpent.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> I am Arjuna. I am one of the five Pandava<br> brothers, and the son of Indra!</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> I am also an Archer Servant under<br> Master Fujimaru!</p><p><strong>Vritra:</strong><br> Ahh, so you&#39;re Indra&#39;s own child then.<br> That just makes this all the more interesting.</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> Hold it, Vritra. I&#39;m your opponent here, remember?</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> Not so fast, Karna. Remember, Indra has defeated Vritra a great many times.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> I am his son, and so it should fall to me.</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> What are you talking about?<br> I&#39;m the one she&#39;s been targeting.</p><p><strong>Vritra:</strong><br> Oh, I see you two are good friends.<br> I&#39;m glad you&#39;re both so eager to face me.</p><p><strong>Vritra:</strong><br> However, I still have a lot of fun I&#39;m looking forward to, and I&#39;m not about to cut it short here.</p><p><strong>Vritra:</strong><br> No, I&#39;m only here to spectate today. Let me introduce you to your opponent.</p><p><strong>Mochizuki Chiyome:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Is that...Mochizuki Chiyome?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> It definitely looks like her, but she doesn&#39;t seem to be the one from Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> It looks to be an expertly made copy,<br> with similar qualities to a Shadow Servant.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> It definitely looks like her, but she doesn&#39;t seem to be the one from Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> It looks to be an expertly made copy,<br> with similar qualities to a Shadow Servant.</p><p><strong>Vritra:</strong><br> That Santa person and I have been bound together by fate.</p><p><strong>Vritra:</strong><br> Thanks to that bond, I was able to take information pertaining to an empty shadow sharing my serpentine qualities and make them into a demon of my own kin.</p><p><strong>Vritra:</strong><br> That is who you see before you.<br> She is the core of this dammed off space.</p><p><strong>Vritra:</strong><br> What do you think? Much more interesting than making it a simple keystone, no?</p><p><strong>Vritra:</strong><br> Anyway, it&#39;s time I was on my way. I look forward to hearing you and your companions screaming in agony, child of Indra.</p><p><strong>Mochizuki Chiyome:</strong><br> There you have it. I am Chiyome, yet I am not Chiyome.</p><p><strong>Mochizuki Chiyome:</strong><br> In essence, I am merely one of Vritra&#39;s familiars who has been given her appearance and personality.</p><p><strong>Mochizuki Chiyome:</strong><br> You need not hold back against me.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> She looks and sounds just like our Chiyome. This could be a difficult fight, for multiple reasons...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> It doesn&#39;t matter. We still have to do this.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Even so, we still have to do this!</p><hr><p><strong>Mochizuki Chiyome:</strong><br> (Oh yes, that&#39;s the Master I know. It&#39;s too bad I can&#39;t<br> outwardly express how glad I am to hear [♂ him /♀️ her] say that!)</p><p><strong>Sigurd:</strong><br> Agreed. As much as it pains me to do battle with a familiar face, it does not affect our mission.</p><p><strong>Sigurd:</strong><br> You are exactly the sort of opponent I was brought here to fight as a daily dragon-slayer.</p><p><strong>Sigurd:</strong><br> And so I shall do my part to carry out our mission here...</p><p><strong>Sigurd:</strong><br> ...by unleashing all my strength against you without any concern for conserving energy for tomorrow!</p><p><strong>Mochizuki Chiyome:</strong><br> Huh? Lord Sigurd, the dragon-slayer...?</p><p><strong>Mochizuki Chiyome:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Mochizuki Chiyome:</strong><br> Um... I promise I&#39;m only asking this out of curiosity, and not because I&#39;m scared, but...</p><p><strong>Mochizuki Chiyome:</strong><br> ...are you sure you&#39;re not taking<br> this a little TOO seriously?</p><p><strong>Mochizuki Chiyome:</strong><br> Vritra only chose me because my body harbors the curse of a serpent.</p><p><strong>Mochizuki Chiyome:</strong><br> I&#39;m not actually a dragon...</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong><br> As something of a professional dragon-slayer myself, I must say distinguishing between serpents and dragons is actually quite difficult.</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong><br> That is why they are generally treated as the same unless there is some urgent need to make a distinction.</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong><br> Trust me, I know of what I speak. My apologies, but as a serpent, the dragon&#39;s sins are still yours to bear.</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> I don&#39;t care what you are as long as I can punch you.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> Do you not realize how terrible that sounds!?</p><p><strong>Sigurd:</strong><br> I&#39;m sorry, Lady Chiyome.<br> I&#39;m just not capable of holding back in battle.</p><p><strong>Mochizuki Chiyome:</strong><br> Gnn... W-well, neither am I!</p><p><strong>Mochizuki Chiyome:</strong><br> I&#39;m a merciless, cold-blooded ninja, after all!</p><p><strong>Mochizuki Chiyome:</strong><br> I couldn&#39;t hold back against a familiar<br> face even if I wanted to!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> (Now I feel kind of bad for her.)</p><hr><p><strong>Mochizuki Chiyome:</strong><br> I don&#39;t need your pity!</p><p><strong>Mochizuki Chiyome:</strong><br> I am an empty shadow bound to serve Vritra, so that&#39;s just what I&#39;m going to do! I don&#39;t have a choice!</p><p><strong>Mochizuki Chiyome:</strong><br> Now come, and let us have a good, clean fight!</p><p><strong>==ARROW==</strong></p><p><strong>Mochizuki Chiyome:</strong><br> Nnn... I&#39;ve always hated the cold. It makes me so sleepy. I wonder if there&#39;s a kotatsu around here...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It&#39;s really too bad we had to do that to her...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I&#39;ll have to do something nice forthe real Chiyome when I get back...</p><hr><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> There&#39;s the core. I&#39;ll take care of it.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Great job, guys! With the core gone, that occluded Singularity shouldn&#39;t stick around much longer.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Great job, guys! With the core gone, that occluded Singularity shouldn&#39;t stick around much longer.</p><p><strong>Sigurd:</strong><br> Mission accomplished.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> Things here seem to have returned to normal now that the ice has melted.</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> Returned to normal, huh?</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> Oh gods. Don&#39;t tell me you&#39;re unhappy because it looks less Christmassy now, are you?</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> No, I&#39;m not.</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> It&#39;s a shame my roadwork will be easier without the ice, but there&#39;s still plenty of training opportunities here.</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> That embankment over there looks perfect for lower body training. It reminds me of how Droṇa used to make us run wind sprints over and over.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> ...No comment.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Cherry blossoms really are beautiful, aren&#39;t they?</p><hr><p><strong>Sigurd:</strong><br> That&#39;s right. We&#39;re in Japan now, aren&#39;t we? I&#39;ve heard of the cherry blossom viewing parties called “hanami” they hold here.</p><p><strong>Sigurd:</strong><br> I&#39;d love to attend one with Brynhild someday. Though of course, my attention would be squarely focused on her rather than the blossoms.</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong><br> Oh my, this landscape. It&#39;s so...so...<br> (Shutter button finger twitching)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I don&#39;t see the harm in taking just one picture.It&#39;ll be a nice memory.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Why not take one shot to remember this Singularity by?</p><hr><p><strong>Georgios:</strong><br> Yes... You make a good point, Master.<br> All right then, just one photo...</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong><br> Oh yes, that is a good one.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I&#39;m afraid Vritra&#39;s signal has vanished.<br> She must have gone somewhere else.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Well, nothing we can do about that now. If we keep this up, she&#39;ll run out of Singularities to hide out in eventually.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Anyway, great job all around!<br> That takes care of today&#39;s mission nicely.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> All that&#39;s left for you guys to do now is come back and get some well-earned rest!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Well, nothing we can do about that now. If we keep this up, she&#39;ll run out of Singularities to hide out in eventually.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Anyway, great job all around!<br> That takes care of today&#39;s mission nicely.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> All that&#39;s left for you guys to do now is come back and get some well-earned rest!</p><p><strong>Vritra:</strong><br> My, my, this is turning out to be even more interesting than I expected. I never imagined I would run into one of Indra&#39;s bloodline here.</p><p><strong>Vritra:</strong><br> Keeheehee. I can already tell I&#39;m going to have so much fun with this...</p><h2 id="round-3-the-star-near-the-shore-and-the-dragon-s-bond" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#round-3-the-star-near-the-shore-and-the-dragon-s-bond" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Round 3: The Star Near the Shore and the Dragon&#39;s Bond</h2><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> So this is the next Singularity.</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong><br> It seems we&#39;ll need to proceed along the shoreline.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> Our target is just off the coast, so I don&#39;t think we&#39;ll be able to stay on the beach the whole time.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> At some point, we&#39;ll need to brave our way across the frozen ocean.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> I&#39;ve been to waterfront cities before...and there&#39;s something unsettling about one entirely frozen over like this.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> It&#39;s just not natural, being this near the water and not hearing a single wave.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I see you&#39;re the fourth team member today, Martha.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> (I&#39;m surprised she&#39;s not wearing her swimsuit at the beach...)</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> What&#39;s that look for? You got a problem with me?<br> ...Ahem. Let&#39;s just pretend that didn&#39;t happen, shall we?</p><hr><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> I heard all about what&#39;s going on, and I&#39;m here to help.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> For my part, I will simply do what I&#39;ve always done: conduct myself in a manner befitting a saint.</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong><br> I have no doubt your help will be invaluable, Lady Martha.</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong><br> Not only are you and I both saints, we have also both vanquished dragons with the Lord&#39;s guidance.</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong><br> Together, I am certain we can overcome<br> any obstacle in our path.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> Um, I&#39;m not sure terms like “vanquish” are really in keeping with my saintly ways.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> I prefer to put it as “gently helping my adversary to see the light of reason.”</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> Wouldn&#39;t you agree that&#39;s more accurate, Tarasque?</p><p><strong>Tarasque:</strong></p><p>Grrr... (I-if you say so, Mistress. Personally, I still remember the moment our eyes met, and my only thought was, “I am so dead.”)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> A collaborative battle between Martha and Mr. Georgios... Two of the greatest saints in history, each famous for defeating a dragon.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> This is so exciting, and I&#39;m not even there with you!</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> A dream match that goes beyond group affiliations to decide the reigning champion... This will be something to see.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> What are you talking about?<br> We&#39;re not going to fight each other!</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> Hehe. Be that as it may, Martha,<br> I can&#39;t wait to spar with you myself.</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> Since we both practice pious pugilism, I would love to find out which of our styles is stronger and faster.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> I told you, that&#39;s not what I&#39;m here for today!<br> I&#39;m a saint, remember!? A saint!</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> I mean, that&#39;s not to say I&#39;m not interested... I&#39;d just rather discuss that sort of thing when Master isn&#39;t around.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> Apparently, people have become more used to seeing me in my swimsuit than with my staff...</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> ...so I can&#39;t pass up this chance to reestablish my saintly image.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> At any rate, today, I am here strictly as Martha, the patron saint of housewives, to spread His teachings with a smile.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> Oh, but that does remind me. Do you know those twins who came to Chaldea recently, Castor and Pollux?</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> Well, I&#39;ve heard that Pollux is a master of fisticuffs. Why not ask her to spar with you sometime?</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> I did. Several times, in fact.</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> Unfortunately, we were never able to finish even a single round because her brother kept getting in our way.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> Oh... Right. I suppose he would, wouldn&#39;t he...</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> I wouldn&#39;t take anything that half-baked Santa says too seriously, Lady Martha.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> Besides, we should be focused on the mission now.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> Yes, good point.<br> We should save the chitchat for another time.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Okay then, why don&#39;t you guys get going?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> By the way, we scanned the ice on the ocean there, and we can assure you it&#39;s not gonna break easily.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> That said, we can&#39;t anticipate what might happen as you go further out, so watch your step.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Okay then, why don&#39;t you guys get going?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> By the way, we scanned the ice on the ocean there, and we can assure you it&#39;s not gonna break easily.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> That said, we can&#39;t anticipate what might happen as you go further out, so watch your step.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Will do!</p><hr><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> By the way, what kind of dragon is this Vritra?<br> Is she a large one?</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong><br> Thus far, we have only seen her in a humanoid form with a tail. I am not even sure if she can transform into a full dragon in her current state.</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> Does it matter how big a dragon is?</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> Of course it does!<br> You need weight to land heavy blows, after all.</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong><br> That said, there&#39;s no reason to fear dragons, no matter their size.</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong><br> You see, even flying dragons need all four of their legs to support their great frames.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> Exactly. So the typical strategy for fighting them is to get down low and rob them of their mobility, then–</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> You can&#39;t strike below the belt in boxing, so I&#39;ll have to stick to body blows. I wonder if those work on dragons...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> (I&#39;ve never heard such a lively discussionabout slaying dragons before...)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> (Martha...)</p><hr><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Sure you don&#39;t want to join them, Arjuna?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I appreciate you staying alert,but maybe you should take a little break?</p><hr><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> No, that&#39;s all right, Master. As Da Vinci said, there&#39;s no telling what might happen out here, so I have to keep my guard up.</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> We haven&#39;t let our guards down.<br> We&#39;re just as alert as you are.</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> But that doesn&#39;t mean we can&#39;t also deepen our combat knowledge at the same time. In fact, it&#39;s important we do so.</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> Don&#39;t you remember what our mentor told us about not neglecting our studies?</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> The more we broaden our horizons, the better Santas (read: warriors) we stand to become.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> ...<br> ...Yes, you&#39;re right.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> I&#39;m sorry, Karna. Like you said, I&#39;ll try to broaden my horizons so I can become a great San–</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> Hold on! I don&#39;t even want to be Santa!<br> What? Why do you look so surprised!?</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> Could I speak to you for a minute?</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> I&#39;m sorry you had to see that.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> It&#39;s okay. I can&#39;t say I understand how you feel...but I do sympathize.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> If you need to get something off your chest, I&#39;m happy to listen, you know.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> Thank you, but no, I don&#39;t.<br> I&#39;m just a little, well, confused.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> Can I ask what you think of Karna now that he&#39;s become Santa, Lady Martha?</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> I wouldn&#39;t say I find it confusing, but he is definitely a little different than usual.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> It kind of feels like...he&#39;s excited about seeing a childhood friend for the first time in years.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> ...I think that&#39;s what has me confused.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> However much our paths may have differed, we did grow up together.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> Even if I cared to, I cannot deny that.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> But...we have a great deal of history besides that as well.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> So maybe seeing him forget all about it and act like none of it ever happened is bothering me.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> I know that&#39;s narrow-minded of me, but even so...</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> Hmm. I don&#39;t know if I&#39;d agree with that.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> This is only my opinion, mind you...</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> But I don&#39;t think he&#39;s forgotten anything, nor is he pretending like none of it ever happened.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> No, I think he&#39;s just genuinely enjoying feeling like his younger self again.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> ...Hehe, I&#39;m sorry. Please don&#39;t mind me. I never have been good about keeping my nose out of other people&#39;s business.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> Besides, I&#39;m a saint.<br> I have to do my part to help lost souls, don&#39;t I?</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> ...I...</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> !!!</p><p><strong>==ARROW==</strong></p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> What&#39;s going on!? Why is everything shaking!?</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong><br> Look out!<br> Something&#39;s heading toward us from out in the bay!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> What is that!?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I&#39;m seeing what looks like a tidal wave made out of ice!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It&#39;s enormous...and it&#39;s moving extremely quickly! You won&#39;t have time to get to shore before it reaches you!</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> If we can&#39;t get away from it, we&#39;ll just have to go over it! Tarasque!</p><p><strong>Tarasque:</strong></p><p>GrrrRRRrrr!<br> (Get on, everyone!)</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> Don&#39;t worry about me. I can manage the jump myself.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> You sure? All right–<br> Uh-oh, it&#39;s here! Now!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> That was close...</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Thank goodness Tarasque was able to help you evade it.</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong><br> Well, that&#39;s not good. I can see what looks to be a second wave off in the distance!</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> Not a problem. I&#39;ll just think of it as an alternative to jump rope training.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> Again, Tarasque! Show us what you&#39;ve got!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Hmm. Those ice waves are definitely coming in regular intervals. What could be causing them?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Hmm. Those ice waves are definitely coming in regular intervals. What could be causing them?</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> I wish we could just fly straight to our target,<br> but I&#39;m afraid Tarasque won&#39;t last that long.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> We&#39;ll just have to keep evading the waves as they come.</p><p><strong>Tarasque:</strong></p><p>Grrr... (I&#39;m sorry. I wish I could be of more help...)</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> So is this a unique natural phenomenon, like the frozen cherry blossoms we saw yesterday?</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong><br> It seems so. And I have a hunch this is intended as a form of attack.</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong><br> I don&#39;t sense any of the dragon&#39;s malice about them.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Hmm, you think so?<br> Well, if you&#39;re sure, I&#39;ll take your word for it.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> But personally, I feel like they&#39;re too regular to be a natural phenomenon.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Hmm, you think so?<br> Well, if you&#39;re sure, I&#39;ll take your word for it.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> But personally, I feel like they&#39;re too regular to be a natural phenomenon.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> Ah, another one! Well, either way, we&#39;ll just have to keep leaping over them as we make our way forward!</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> Come on, Tarasque, get up there!</p><p><strong>Tarasque:</strong><br> GRRrrr...<br> (I&#39;m sorry, Big Sis, but I need a break...)</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> A break!? What do you need a break for!?<br> I was sure I trained you better than that!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> There! I can see where the waves are coming from!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> There! I can see where the waves are coming from!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> That&#39;s Lady Lambda...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> That&#39;s Lambdaryllis...</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> And Vritra&#39;s there with her!</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> That&#39;s Vritra!?<br> ...Hmm. She doesn&#39;t look all that big.</p><p><strong>Vritra:</strong><br> Oho, nice. Very nice. I wasn&#39;t expecting much from this little ice dance...</p><p><strong>Vritra:</strong><br> ...but these “triple Axels” of yours are quite a sight to behold!</p><p><strong>Lambda:</strong><br> I&#39;m still just seeing what the ice here is like.<br> I haven&#39;t even started skating for real yet.</p><p><strong>Lambda:</strong><br> I&#39;ve never seen a spectator get so worked up over a simple rehearsal before, let alone a patron.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> Evade!</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> Now I see. So her figure skating<br> is what was causing these waves.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> I don&#39;t know exactly what kind of skating techniques she&#39;s using...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> ...but yeah, it looks like the ice shavings created by her flashier jumps and spins are making the waves.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> I don&#39;t know exactly what kind of skating techniques she&#39;s using...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> ...but yeah, it looks like the ice shavings created by her flashier jumps and spins are making the waves.</p><p><strong>Lambda:</strong><br> Oh?</p><p><strong>Vritra:</strong><br> Ah, there you are. Good timing. Lambda here should be just about warmed up by now.</p><p><strong>Vritra:</strong><br> I&#39;m not going to lift a finger myself, of course.<br> I&#39;m only here to watch you all dance. Good luck.</p><p><strong>Lambda:</strong><br> I was wondering what this was all about when Vritra said she had frozen an entire ocean for me to skate on...</p><p><strong>Lambda:</strong><br> ...but now I understand.</p><p><strong>Lambda:</strong><br> It looks like she lined up some premium spectators after all. Now this is an audience worth skating for.</p><p><strong>Lambda:</strong><br> I still don&#39;t like how she copied me so she could put me to work for her...</p><p><strong>Lambda:</strong><br> ...but now that I&#39;ve got a special stage, and...well, slightly special guests, I suppose I can dance for at least one song.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> So, yesterday we had Chiyome, now we have Lambda?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I guess this mean&#39;s Lambda&#39;s the next Chiyome then.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Right, Master. That isn&#39;t the actual Lambdaryllis.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> She&#39;s most likely a copy Vritra made.</p><p><strong>Lambda:</strong><br> Don&#39;t talk about me like that.<br> Copy or not, a star is still a star.</p><p><strong>Lambda:</strong><br> Even if I&#39;m the understudy, my dancing is the epitome of beauty.</p><p><strong>Lambda:</strong><br> When you&#39;ve reached the acme of perfection like I have, it doesn&#39;t matter if you&#39;re real or not.</p><p><strong>Lambda:</strong><br> Now then, before we get this special performance underway...</p><p><strong>Lambda:</strong><br> ...there&#39;s something I think I need to ask you about.<br> What is that?</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> What&#39;s what?</p><p><strong>Lambda:</strong><br> That! That thing you&#39;re parking your ass on right now!<br> Is it related to Leviathan?</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> Yes, if you must know, Tarasque is Leviathan&#39;s child.</p><p><strong>Lambda:</strong><br> Well, that explains it. You see, I&#39;m a High Servant and Leviathan is my base.</p><p><strong>Lambda:</strong><br> No wonder I sensed something special about it then.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> Do you sense anything, Tarasque?</p><p><strong>Tarasque:</strong></p><p>Grrr... (Huh? Uh, let me see...)</p><p><strong>Tarasque:</strong></p><p>(No, I&#39;m pretty sure I don&#39;t. I mean, I guess we might have some kind of connection, but it&#39;s pretty iffy.)</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> There, you see!? Look at that befuddled face! Tarasque obviously has no idea what you&#39;re talking about!</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> Also, since no one else seems willing to say it, I will:</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> That thing you&#39;re wearing doesn&#39;t even look like Leviathan. It&#39;s obviously penguin themed.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> (Way to go, Martha! You actually went there!)</p><hr><p><strong>Lambda:</strong><br> Wh-what are you talking about!? This is obviously Leviathan! Any idiot can see that!</p><p><strong>Lambda:</strong><br> (I mean, I don&#39;t actually know what Leviathan looks like, but I know Leviathan&#39;s my base, that this parka looks great on me, and that my magical energy generated it in the first place.)</p><p><strong>Lambda:</strong><br> (So it HAS to be Leviathan, right!? I mean, what else could it possibly be!?)</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong><br> Leviathan is certainly a type<br> of dragonkin in its own right.</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong><br> And while I do sense its presence here, I can&#39;t tell if it&#39;s from her, or from those adorable animals.</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong><br> I think this calls for a closer inspection...</p><p><strong>Lambda:</strong><br> Quiet, you! And don&#39;t touch my backup dancers!<br> I swear, I shouldn&#39;t even have to say that!</p><p><strong>Lambda:</strong><br> At any rate, I&#39;m Leviathan, which makes me Tarasque&#39;s mother, and I object to how you&#39;re treating the poor thing.</p><p><strong>Lambda:</strong><br> Come here, Tarasque. It&#39;s all right.</p><p><strong>Lambda:</strong><br> I&#39;m sure I can come up with a new routine that takes advantage of that big bulk of yours.</p><p><strong>Tarasque:</strong><br> Grr? (Huh?)</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> Now what are you talking about!?<br> Tarasque is my...um...serf?</p><p><strong>Lambda:</strong><br> Serf? Heh. Come now, surely there&#39;s<br> a more modern term than that.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> I know I&#39;m from the first century, but that doesn&#39;t give you the right to criticize my word choice!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> This is the weirdest ice hockey game I&#39;ve ever seen...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Poor Tarasque. Being a giant hockey puck can&#39;t be fun...</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Martha and Lambda are both trying to send Tarasque flying into each other!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Neither one is giving a centimeter, since Lambda&#39;s kicks and Martha&#39;s punches keep landing at the same time!</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> As far as I can tell,<br> they seem to be perfectly evenly matched.</p><p><strong>Lambda:</strong><br> Why you... This is MY child! I have a right to protect him as I see fit!</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> You uppity little... Who do you think made him turn over a new leaf in the first place!?</p><p><strong>Tarasque:</strong></p><p>(H-hang on, Big Sis! If you both keep smooshing me like that, I... I...)</p><p><strong>Tarasque:</strong></p><p>(I&#39;m gonna pop clean out of my shell!)</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> I&#39;ve seen this sort of thing before.</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> It didn&#39;t have anything to do with Santa or boxing, though. I just saw it in one of the library&#39;s files.</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> It was another case involving two mothers and a child.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Oh yes, I think I know the one you mean. It&#39;s where they both claim to be the child&#39;s parent, and each try to pull the child in different directions.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Pretty sure they&#39;re pushing, not pulling here, but I guess it&#39;s still pretty similar.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Pretty sure they&#39;re pushing, not pulling here, but I guess it&#39;s still pretty similar.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> So if that story&#39;s logic applies here too, then whoever lets go of Tarasque first is actually the one with the stronger claim!</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> Saint!</p><p><strong>Tarasque:</strong></p><p>(Uh-oh. That punch just ruined my balance...<br> Gaaah! I&#39;m gonna go flying!)</p><p><strong>Lambda:</strong><br> Khh!</p><p><strong>Lambda:</strong><br> Heh... Hehehe... So, you&#39;ve shown your true colors.</p><p><strong>Lambda:</strong><br> I could see Tarasque was in pain, which is why I couldn&#39;t bring myself to use my full strength.</p><p><strong>Lambda:</strong><br> (Okay, she straight-up overpowered me, but I&#39;ll be damned if I&#39;m gonna admit that.)</p><p><strong>Lambda:</strong><br> (I&#39;m the sadistic queen of the rink, after all. Seeing someone in pain only makes me more excited.)</p><p><strong>Lambda:</strong><br> (Besides, a star like me is elegant, not brutish, so the fact that I lost this contest of pure strength just proves how graceful I really am!)</p><p><strong>Lambda:</strong><br> Now do you and your overgrown muscles understand? You never noticed he was in pain, which means you–</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> Don&#39;t make me laugh!<br> You&#39;re the one who&#39;s shown her true colors!</p><p><strong>Lambda:</strong><br> Huh?</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> Me, hold back? Don&#39;t be ridiculous.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> I trusted that Tarasque was tough enough to take it, and you didn&#39;t!</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> That proves I know him better than you ever will!</p><p><strong>Lambda:</strong><br> What!? (She has a lovely voice,<br> but that is some grade A crazy talk!)</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> No matter how you look at it, this is clearly my victory!</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong><br> Trust, huh? That&#39;s...one way you could interpret this. One, uh, very generous way...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I guess this just goes to show the difference in their experience.</p><hr><p><strong>Tarasque:</strong><br> Grrr... (Big Sis definitely knows how tough I am better than anyone else... Ow ow ow ow...)</p><p><strong>Lambda:</strong><br> ...Fine. Competitions of brute strength aren&#39;t my style anyway.</p><p><strong>Lambda:</strong><br> A star on the ice is a star on the ice, even if that ice is an entire frozen ocean.</p><p><strong>Lambda:</strong><br> So once I&#39;ve used my natural star beauty to wipe the floor–er, rink, with you...</p><p><strong>Lambda:</strong><br> ...I&#39;ll claim Tarasque for myself, just like I would any gift bouquet tossed onto my stage!</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> Gifts, huh. You do know how to hit where it hurts, don&#39;t you? Impressive.</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> As Santa Claus, maybe I should find a way to make your wish come true as well.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> Do you even listen to yourself!?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Yeah, don&#39;t forget, she&#39;s a copy, not a real Servant. If you start granting wishes to every imitation-thing like that, you&#39;ll never have enough to go around!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Yeah, don&#39;t forget, she&#39;s a copy, not a real Servant. If you start granting wishes to every imitation-thing like that, you&#39;ll never have enough to go around!</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> I see... Good point.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> For a moment, I was a little worried you might actually side with her, but I&#39;m glad you&#39;re seeing reason now.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> Now, come on! I don&#39;t know if you really are Leviathan or not...</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> ...but since you claim to be Tarasque&#39;s mother, I&#39;ll beat some sense into you just like I did him!</p><p><strong>==ARROW==</strong></p><p><strong>Lambda:</strong><br> Damn... Oh well, it&#39;s okay.<br> It doesn&#39;t matter if I was never real.</p><p><strong>Lambda:</strong><br> The star should always be a phantom, forever out of arm&#39;s reach anyway.</p><p><strong>Lambda:</strong><br> Besides... As long as my performance moves my audience, I don’t mind if it&#39;s my last.</p><p><strong>Lambda:</strong><br> That&#39;s what it is to be a professional.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> It was beautiful.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I know.</p><hr><p><strong>Tarasque:</strong><br> Grrr... (I&#39;m sorry. I appreciate the offer,<br> but I&#39;ll always be a fighter, not a dancer.)</p><p><strong>Vritra:</strong><br> Well, well, that was a lovely dance.</p><p><strong>Vritra:</strong><br> I was planning to leave earlier,<br> but I ended up staying to watch the whole show.</p><p><strong>Vritra:</strong><br> I know this is exactly the sort of thing Indra used to use against me, but I just can&#39;t help it.</p><p><strong>Vritra:</strong><br> Ah well. I&#39;ve had my fun today, so I think it&#39;s time I take my lea–</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> Not so fast.<br> That battle made me realize something important.</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> Just answer one question before you leave.</p><p><strong>Vritra:</strong><br> Hm?</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> It&#39;s about your reasons for interfering with my work–with Christmas.</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> You could have just come and tried to kill me, but you didn&#39;t.</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> Instead, you chose to interfere with my gift giving remotely by creating those unopenable presents. There must be a reason for that.</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> Maybe there&#39;s a present you want for yourself,<br> like the lightweight skating boxer we just fought.</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> And maybe you&#39;re doing all this because you&#39;re unhappy you can&#39;t get it.</p><p><strong>Vritra:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Vritra:</strong><br> Yes, I suppose it&#39;s something like that.</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> I see. In that case...</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> I may have a lot of training left to go, but even so, I&#39;m still Santa Claus.</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> So answer me this: What do you want for Christmas?</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> Tell me what you want, and I&#39;ll search my entire bag of presents for something to make sure your holiday is a happy one.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> No wonder you&#39;re the Hero of Benefaction.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> You&#39;re a good man, Karna.</p><hr><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Vritra:</strong><br> Keeheehee! What a delightful surprise from you, Santa!</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> Any other Santa would do the same.<br> ...I think.</p><p><strong>Vritra:</strong><br> Well, worry not. You don&#39;t need to search your bag, because you&#39;ll never find what I want inside.</p><p><strong>Vritra:</strong><br> All I want for Christmas is your agonized wails as I steal your Christmas from you!</p><p><strong>Vritra:</strong><br> That&#39;s the greatest–the only gift you can give me!</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Hmm. Maybe this means she&#39;s just another<br> natural-born sadist, like Lambdaryllis.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Hmm. Maybe this means she&#39;s just another<br> natural-born sadist, like Lambdaryllis.</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong><br> So her goal is to watch us all suffer, hm?</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong><br> Exactly what I&#39;d expect from an irredeemably evil dragon. My sword and I will see that she pays for her sins.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> Now that it looks like my work here is done, would you mind a bit of advice?</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> What is it?</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> Well, it&#39;s something I noticed while we were fighting, but...</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> Are you having more trouble fighting as part of a team than usual?</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> ...I didn&#39;t think I was, but now that you mention it, maybe I am.</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> Boxers are meant to fight by themselves, and of course, there&#39;s only one Santa Claus.</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> That said, I don&#39;t feel as though it&#39;s working against me. That&#39;s why I&#39;ve been focusing on improving my skills as a solo fighter.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> I see. Well, if you&#39;re that sure of yourself, then I have nothing more to say.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> I guess now&#39;s probably not the time to be thinking about that sort of thing. This is just how you need to fight now.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> I know I&#39;d certainly be taken aback if someone told me I didn&#39;t need to wield my staff anymore.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> Anyway, it looks like we&#39;ve found this Singularity&#39;s core.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> Let&#39;s destroy it once we&#39;re back on solid ground.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Ahh, much better!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Now that&#39;s what a vacation resort&#39;s supposed to look like.</p><hr><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> Indeed. Christmas or not, this is still a beautiful summer. Even more beautiful now.</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> I&#39;m especially fond of this beach.<br> It should be excellent for roadwork.</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong><br> This certainly does seem like paradise on earth.<br> Maybe one more photo...</p><p><strong>Vritra:</strong><br> Well now, today has been just full of surprises.<br> You really wish to work with me of your own accord?</p><p><strong>Vritra:</strong><br> All right, I suppose I can at least hear you out.<br> Besides, you do smell like one of my kind.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Vritra:</strong><br> Hmm. Very well.</p><p><strong>Vritra:</strong><br> I was just thinking that having only my demons serve as the anchors was starting to get a bit old, anyway.</p><p><strong>Vritra:</strong><br> All right, you can handle the next one. And I think it&#39;ll be more fun if I don&#39;t even show up at all this time.</p><p><strong>Vritra:</strong><br> It should be a nice change of pace, watching things unfold from a greater distance than usual...</p><h2 id="round-4-the-monster-of-the-bamboo-forest-labyrinth" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#round-4-the-monster-of-the-bamboo-forest-labyrinth" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Round 4: The Monster of the Bamboo Forest Labyrinth</h2><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Okay, as you can see, this latest occluded<br> Singularity is located in a bamboo forest in Asia.</p><p><strong>Aśvatthāman:</strong><br> All right, where are you, dragon!?

My apologies.</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong><br> At any rate, we should go over our route to our target.</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong><br> This is a frozen bamboo forest, which means we will have poor visibility as well as poor footing.</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong><br> It will also be difficult to retain our sense of direction, since all this bamboo has blocked off any paths we would normally take.</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong><br> Make sure you stay close to us at all times, Master...</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong><br> Even a moment&#39;s lapse in attention could result in your being lost here forever.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> G-got it. I&#39;ll be careful!</p><hr><p><strong>Aśvatthāman:</strong><br> Ugh, dammit! It&#39;s a goddamn dead end!</p><p><strong>Aśvatthāman:</strong><br> Who the hell does this punk-ass dragon think they are, anyway? Just bring your ass out here so we can fight, dammit!</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong><br> This place is even more complex than I&#39;d feared. It&#39;s as though we&#39;re traversing a labyrinth made of frozen bamboo.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I&#39;m mapping the terrain as we speak.<br> Would you like me to send what I&#39;ve got?</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> Thank you, but no, that won&#39;t be necessary. I, too, am building a map of this area in my head as we speak.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That&#39;s wonderful, Arjuna. I should have known you would have the situation well in hand. I&#39;ll just keep this map going as a kind of backup, then.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> If you decide you&#39;d like to use it, just say the word.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> Thank you, Mash. I&#39;ll do that.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> All right, Master, let&#39;s go back to that three-way fork we saw earlier and try following the left path this time.</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> It&#39;s too bad I can&#39;t get much roadwork done here.</p><p><strong>Aśvatthāman:</strong><br> Ugh, this is pissing me off. We haven&#39;t seen a single enemy so far, and we can&#39;t even go in a straight line here.</p><p><strong>Aśvatthāman:</strong><br> Then when I get bored and try to pass the time with a little fighting, Arjuna keeps stepping in and being all, “Now is not the time.”</p><p><strong>Aśvatthāman:</strong><br> He really hasn&#39;t changed a goddamn bit.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> So you all used to train together, huh?</p><hr><p><strong>Aśvatthāman:</strong><br> Yup. My old man was basically the martial arts teacher for the entire Kuru clan.</p><p><strong>Aśvatthāman:</strong><br> He taught Prince Duryodhana and his ninety-nine brothers, Prince Arjuna and his four brothers...</p><p><strong>Aśvatthāman:</strong><br> ...and plenty of other guys in addition to me and Karna.</p><p><strong>Aśvatthāman:</strong><br> I&#39;ve got tons of stories from those days that&#39;d have you laughing your ass off. Maybe Karna&#39;s told you some of them?</p><p><strong>Aśvatthāman:</strong><br> ...Well, probably not. Not unless you asked about them directly.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...?</p><hr><p><strong>Aśvatthāman:</strong><br> Anyway, I&#39;m sure my old man had his own stuff to worry about, being the teacher for the whole clan and all, so he couldn&#39;t teach everyone exactly the same way.</p><p><strong>Aśvatthāman:</strong><br> I bet Karna&#39;s got his own share of memories from that time that piss him the hell off, too.</p><p><strong>Aśvatthāman:</strong><br> He never let his bad experiences get in the way of his training, though. I always admired that about him...</p><p><strong>Aśvatthāman:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Aśvatthāman:</strong><br> Gaah, now I&#39;m getting all wistful and shit!<br> This friggin&#39; sucks! I want to be pumped, dammit!</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> Quiet.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> All right, Master, it looks like we&#39;ll need to go down the left path at the next fork in the–</p><p><strong>Aśvatthāman:</strong><br> MORE friggin&#39; twists and turns!? This is getting goddamn ridiculous!</p><p><strong>Aśvatthāman:</strong><br> Hang on. I&#39;ve got it.<br> Goddamn, why didn&#39;t I think of this before?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Think of what?</p><hr><p><strong>Aśvatthāman:</strong><br> I got it, Master! If we can&#39;t figure out which way to go, all we gotta do&#39;s make our own way!</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> Whoa, whoa, hold it. You don&#39;t mean–</p><p><strong>Aśvatthāman:</strong><br> All right! Here goes!</p><p><strong>Aśvatthāman:</strong><br> Sudarshana Chakra Yamarāja!!!</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> What were you thinking!? At least give us some warning before you–Oh no!</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> That frozen bamboo up there just broke off and is headed our way like a volley of ice spears! Stand back, Master!</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> Hup!</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong><br> Allow me!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Th-thanks, guys.</p><hr><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> Now then.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> Aśvatthāman? Do you have anything to say for yourself?</p><p><strong>Aśvatthāman:</strong></p><h1 id="no-i-don-t" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#no-i-don-t" aria-hidden="true">#</a> ...No!

Impenetrable. Flawless.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> Wouldn&#39;t you agree, Master?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> (He&#39;s really making a show of that, isn&#39;t he...)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Of course it was.</p><hr><p><strong>Aśvatthāman:</strong><br> G-got it.</p><p><strong>Aśvatthāman:</strong><br> Anyway, I did save us some time, and that&#39;s gotta help. Right, Da Vinci?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> True, this is taking longer than I expected.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> It may not be the most peaceful approach, but as long as you can promise it&#39;s safe, this might not be a bad idea.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> True, this is taking longer than I expected.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> It may not be the most peaceful approach, but as long as you can promise it&#39;s safe, this might not be a bad idea.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> ...(Sigh) All right. If you and Master are sure about this, then I have no objections.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> Okay then, Aśvatthāman, clear a path for us!<br> I will use my arrows to keep Master safe!</p><p><strong>Aśvatthāman:</strong><br> You know, hearing that from you,<br> I&#39;m not so sure I wanna keep doing this anymore!</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> Don&#39;t be childish.</p><p><strong>Aśvatthāman:</strong><br> One, two... Hraaah!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That was great, Aśvatthāman.<br> You&#39;ve reached the signal source!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Huh? Is that...?</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> Wow, really? That was your best way to get here? What a bunch of brutes. It&#39;s so stupid I just love it.</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong><br> Kama, the god of love...or a copy of her, rather. Not typically one who comes to mind at the mention of dragons.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That&#39;s not a copy, Georgios. I&#39;m getting a Servant signal from her! It&#39;s the real Kama!</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> That&#39;s right. It&#39;s the REAL me.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> I&#39;m working with Vritra by watching over this Singularity&#39;s core for her.</p><p><strong>Aśvatthāman:</strong><br> The hell!? So I&#39;m not gonna get to fight a goddamn dragon after all!? Now I&#39;m really friggin&#39; pissed!</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> I don&#39;t know what it is you were hoping for here, but could you not stand so close to me? You reek of Shiva.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> Besides, shouldn&#39;t you guys be all shocked to find one of your own betraying you?</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> Ugh, gods of destruction, always ruining any chance at dramatic tension... (Sigh)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Why are you working with Vritra?</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> THANK YOU! I was waiting for someone to ask!</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> At least one of you knows how these things are supposed to go, Master.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> You haven&#39;t caused trouble in a while, so...not exactly surprised.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> Freaking what!? You&#39;re talking like you expected this out of me all along!</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> I mean, I&#39;m not upset. I&#39;m actually kind of impressed by how well you get me.</p><hr><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> To get to why I&#39;m doing this... I&#39;m really just out to cause trouble here.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> Oh, but it&#39;s not that I WANT to cause trouble for anyone per se. It&#39;s more like I have to, because of what I am.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> What do you mean by that, Kama?</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> Don&#39;t you remember? The only reason I fired that arrow at Shiva was because Indra ordered me to.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> And this...was my reward.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> Now do you get it, son of Indra?</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> I only use a vajra associated with Indra to piss you guys off.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> I don&#39;t know why Vritra is doing this, but I&#39;d guess her reasons are pretty similar.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> Basically, we&#39;re both demons and vajra buddies, so we have a lot in common.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> So, wouldn&#39;t you know it, I just couldn&#39;t help myself.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> Yes, that&#39;s right. There are some aspects of what I&#39;m doing here that are simply beyond my control.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> Most of them are fun, since they&#39;re things I&#39;d choose to do anyway, but there are also some I really can&#39;t stand.</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong><br> ...Everyone, is there any chance that she&#39;s under some form of mind control?</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong><br> I do know that some evil dragons are capable of that. Perhaps Vritra is one of them.</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> No, that&#39;s just regular Kama. She&#39;s being entirely true to herself. I can tell.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong><br> Hmm, I see. So that is just who she is.</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong><br> That does make me somewhat reluctant to fight her...<br> Then again, maybe it doesn&#39;t?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Pretty sure she knew what she was in for.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I don&#39;t think you need to hold back against her. Not too much, anyway.</p><hr><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> Of course. Santa has no mercy for those who would interfere with his duties.</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> So I will continue to fight until I have become a worthy Santa (read: warrior), whether I must face a god or a demon.</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> That is what Christmas is all about.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> Um, I&#39;m no Christmas expert, but even I know that&#39;s not even kind of what it&#39;s about.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> Anyway, as long as you Indra-related gods consider me a nuisance, that&#39;s all I need to be satisfied.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> Now then, let&#39;s try to make sure we both come out of this alive, shall we?</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong><br> You may not technically be a dragon yourself, but the way you prioritize your own tastes and desires above all else is certainly something you have in common with them!</p><p><strong>Aśvatthāman:</strong><br> Grr, I don&#39;t even care anymore!</p><p><strong>Aśvatthāman:</strong><br> If you&#39;re the only one here, then I&#39;ll just have to take out all my pent-up anger on you!</p><p><strong>Aśvatthāman:</strong><br> You better put up as good a fight as a dragon!<br> Do you hear me? Now come on, let&#39;s freakin&#39; GO!</p><p><strong>==ARROW==</strong></p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> (Sigh) I honestly expected to upset you gods connected to Indra more than that.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> But I guess my fun was bound to end the moment a god connected to Shiva showed up too. Hmph.</p><p><strong>Aśvatthāman:</strong><br> Hey, if anyone&#39;s got a right to complain here, it&#39;s me. Get Vritra&#39;s scaley ass out here so I can have a real fight, dammit.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> I only agreed to work with her so that I could have some fun. I can&#39;t make her do anything.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> If you want to see her that badly, I guess you&#39;ll just have to look in another Singularity.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> Well, so long. Merry Christmas and all that jazz.</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> Thank you. Santa will never let a holiday greeting go unreturned, so...</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> Merry Christmas.</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> Once I&#39;ve become a worthy Santa, I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll be able to bring you the best present you could hope for.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> ...(Sigh). They just do not get sarcasm...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Anyway, the important thing&#39;s that you guys won.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> We still don&#39;t know if Kama helping Vritra out here has any greater significance, but we can worry about that later.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> For now, go ahead and take care of that Singularity core.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Anyway, the important thing&#39;s that you guys won.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> We still don&#39;t know if Kama helping Vritra out here has any greater significance, but we can worry about that later.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> For now, go ahead and take care of that Singularity core.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Ooh, that&#39;s a nice breeze...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> It&#39;s so...rejuvenating here...</p><hr><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Well hey, since you&#39;re already there and all, why not enjoy some bamboo forest therapy before you head back? Could be refreshing.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Well hey, since you&#39;re already there and all, why not enjoy some bamboo forest therapy before you head back? Could be refreshing.</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong><br> Good idea. Now, let&#39;s see if I can find the best spot for that special shot...</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> ...I&#39;m sorry, but I think I&#39;m going to head back now. There&#39;s something bothering me and I want to look into it.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> (Something nagging at him?)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> (I wonder what that was all about.)</p><hr><p><strong>Aśvatthāman:</strong><br> Ugh, refreshing my ass.<br> I&#39;m barely even warmed up here, dammit.</p><p><strong>Aśvatthāman:</strong><br> You guys&#39;re gonna stay here for a while longer, right?<br> Perfect! Come on, Karna, let&#39;s spar!</p><p><strong>Aśvatthāman:</strong><br> And none of that stopping right before you make contact bullshit this time. Hit me like you mean it!</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> Fine by me. I was just thinking about how I didn&#39;t get any decent training done here.</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> Wandering a labyrinth with a bunch of dead ends doesn&#39;t lend itself to training, really.</p><p><strong>Aśvatthāman:</strong><br> Hahaha! You should&#39;ve just punched<br> through them, like I did!</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> You&#39;ve got that right!</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> I knew it. Something doesn&#39;t add up.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> Most of them are fun, since they&#39;re things I&#39;d choose to do anyway, but there are some I really can&#39;t stand.</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> No, that&#39;s just regular Kama. She&#39;s being entirely true to herself. I can tell.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> Those two statements are completely at odds with each other. Why? What does it all mean?</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> ...Maybe one possibility is... No, that can&#39;t be it. But that would mean...</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> If I&#39;m right...then this might get to the heart of who Vritra is, too.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> Could that be why Lady Pārvatī chose not to get involved? Because she already knew about this?</p><p><strong>Pārvatī (Auditory Hallucination?):</strong><br> You got it. But that&#39;s all I&#39;m going to say. I&#39;m counting on all of you to take care of this, okay?</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> Yes, my lady. I understand.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> All right then, what should I do next?</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> As if I didn&#39;t know.<br> I need to find out who Vritra truly is for myself.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> And if I&#39;m going to do that...</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> ...I guess I&#39;m going to need his help.<br> His eyes are sharper than anyone&#39;s, and besides...</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> While I might not be able to deal with this any longer myself, for him, things might take on an entirely different meaning...</p><h2 id="round-5-the-sound-of-the-river" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#round-5-the-sound-of-the-river" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Round 5: The Sound of the River</h2><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Well this is a nice change of pace.</p><hr><p><strong>Arjuna Alter:</strong><br> ...I agree, Master.</p><p><strong>Arjuna Alter:</strong><br> Getting to travel with you like this is a very nice change of pace for me.</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong><br> Hmm. I was a little perplexed when Arjuna said he wished to send someone in his place for this mission...</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong><br> ...but now, it all makes sense.</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong><br> Though I do wonder if there was any deeper significance to him entrusting his own alter with this mission...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> So hey, Arjuna Alter. I didn&#39;t want to get into this if I didn&#39;t have to, but considering the possible risks involved, I think it&#39;s better if we just clear the air now.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> There&#39;s a lot we don&#39;t know about your state of mind, so I have to ask:</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> What do you think of Karna?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> So hey, Arjuna Alter.

Something I cannot quite put into words.</p><p><strong>Arjuna Alter:</strong><br> Still, even that sensation means nothing to me.<br> My only concern now is vanquishing evil by Master&#39;s side.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I see. It sounds like you do have a somewhat different stance than Archer Arjuna then.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> What about you, Karna?</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> As I am now, I don&#39;t know you all that well, but Aśvatthāman told me:</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> “He might be a different aspect of him, but he&#39;s still Arjuna. Just treat him like you usually would, dammit.”</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> So even though you look different, if you truly are the same Arjuna who studied with me under the same teacher...</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> ...then that&#39;s just what I&#39;m going to try to do.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> (Why did he just raise his fist in front of Arjuna Alter&#39;s face?)</p><hr><p><strong>Arjuna Alter:</strong><br> ...?</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> This is something I&#39;ve done with Arjuna as well.</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> I&#39;m told it&#39;s something one does when you are reunited with someone you remember fondly, as well as at the start and end of a battle fought together.</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> It doesn&#39;t matter if you&#39;re enemies or allies. This is something done by any two people who engage in combat.</p><p><strong>Arjuna Alter:</strong><br> ...I see. Very well then.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> (He gave Karna a fist bump!)</p><p><strong>Arjuna Alter:</strong><br> Hmm... This is new information, and a new sensation. I&#39;ll make sure certain it&#39;s accurately recorded in my memory.</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong><br> Well, we certainly shouldn&#39;t be wanting for firepower with you taking over for Arjuna, Sir Alter.</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong><br> You may fight differently than he does, of course,<br> but with my knowledge and experience...</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong><br> ...I&#39;m certain I can put together a new team strategy that will let us defeat this Singularity&#39;s dragon.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> That&#39;s kind of you to say, but I know I&#39;m not nearly as strong as the other dragon-slayers you&#39;ve had. I&#39;m sorry.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> Though that&#39;s not to say I won&#39;t<br> do my very best in this battle.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Glad to have you with us, Sieg.</p><hr><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> Thank you, Master. I know I have big shoes to fill, and though I&#39;m not sure I can fill them, I&#39;ll definitely try.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> That aside...I still wonder why in the world Siegfried suggested I go on this mission in his place?</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> I mean, I do have some experience taking down evil dragons with Sigurd, but...</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> I really don&#39;t feel confident going up against a dragon that&#39;s gone toe-to-toe with gods.</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong><br> Oh, you need not feel as though this mission&#39;s success rests entirely on your shoulders. Sir Karna, Sir Alter, and myself are all here as well.</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong><br> I&#39;m also well aware that Sir Siegfried&#39;s dragon-slaying skills are every bit the equal of Lord Sigurd&#39;s.</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong><br> If he sent you here in his place, he must have had an excellent reason for doing so.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> What did Siegfried actually say to you, anyway?</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> Um... “It is Christmas, after all.”<br> I&#39;m still not sure what he meant by that.</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> Oho. That sounds like it has something to do with Santa as well.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> I&#39;m sorry. I really couldn&#39;t say.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Oh well, no biggie.

All right, everyone, let&#39;s be on our way.</p><p><strong>Arjuna Alter:</strong><br> This world certainly is...freezing, isn&#39;t it.</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> That is simply how Christmas is.</p><p><strong>Arjuna Alter:</strong><br> I see.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> (I know they&#39;re just making small talk,<br> but those two are so much larger than life...)</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> (...that it feels like they&#39;re having a some deep, profound conversation...)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> (Yeah.

I&#39;m kind of jealous!)</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> So hey, since we&#39;ve got a while till you reach the target anyway, I might as well pass on something our analysis team just discovered.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> I don&#39;t know how pertinent this fact is to our mission, but it&#39;s still a neat bit of trivia.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> What is it?</p><hr><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> These occluded Singularities&#39; original environments have all been frozen over into these wintery landscapes, right?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> You might think this was caused by a huge temperature drop, but it actually isn&#39;t. The cold is apparently just a side effect of sorts.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> In a sense, the coldness was added on after the fact to match everything being frozen.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> What do you mean?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Hmm, how can I put this...?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Okay, so these worlds look frozen, right? In actuality, though, they&#39;re just...stopped.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Basically, the concepts behind these worlds–or the space they occupy, if you prefer–have been shut down.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> They&#39;ve been blocked from functioning as normal, like the name “occluded” suggests.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> So now, they just...exist. Complete entities unto themselves, neither affecting nor being affected by anything else.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Consequently, they look frozen solid, even though that&#39;s not technically what happened.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> For example, say you used some kind of fire magecraft or fire-based Noble Phantasm to burn an entire area here to the ground.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> It would definitely affect that area temporarily, but it wouldn&#39;t do anything to the base reality of the world itself.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Even with the bamboo forest from yesterday, Aśvatthāman was able to use his Noble Phantasm to make a simple path, but it would&#39;ve been fundamentally impossible to destroy the forest itself.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Hell, even the paths he made will have blocked themselves off again by now.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> So hey, since we&#39;ve got a while till you reach the target anyway, I might as well pass on something our analysis team just discovered.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> I don&#39;t know how pertinent this fact is to our mission, but it&#39;s still a neat bit of trivia.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> What is it?</p><hr><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> These occluded Singularities&#39; original environments have all been frozen over into these wintery landscapes, right?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> You might think this was caused by a huge temperature drop, but it actually isn&#39;t.

This should already be basic knowledge for you. We were both taught that growing up.</p><p><strong>Arjuna Alter:</strong><br> Unfortunately, this body is no longer human...</p><p><strong>Arjuna Alter:</strong><br> ...so there may well be things the human Arjuna knew that I do not.</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong><br> Good timing. We&#39;ve been walking for a long while now, so let&#39;s take a short break here.</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong><br> We can have a quick bite to eat, and go over everything we know about this situation to ensure we&#39;re all on the same page.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Sounds good!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Now that you mention it, I am kind of peckish.</p><hr><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Mmm, that garlic and cream sauce smells reeeally good...</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong><br> Just a moment, Master... There, it&#39;s done. Here you go.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Help me, Teacher! My stomach won&#39;t stop growling!</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong><br> Then we&#39;d better do something about it. Here you go.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Whatever&#39;s in that pot really does look delicious.<br> What kind of dish is it?</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong><br> Just a simple chicken and garlic sauce dish I used to make all the time.</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong><br> I think these days, it&#39;s known as chkmeruli.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> (Munch, munch) Whatever it&#39;s called, it&#39;s super yummy!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Oh man, I feel warmer already!</p><hr><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> I&#39;ve heard chicken is one of the best foods you can eat for weight control. Especially the white meat.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> What is it, Arjuna?</p><p><strong>Arjuna Alter:</strong><br> To be honest...I don&#39;t really understand flavor.</p><p><strong>Arjuna Alter:</strong><br> At most, I can tell if something<br> is especially spicy or sweet.</p><p><strong>Arjuna Alter:</strong><br> I am not sure that I can taste the nuances of flavors in this food the way you all do.</p><p><strong>Arjuna Alter:</strong><br> Even so...I can tell it is very warm.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> ...I see. Then you should take your time eating it.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> ...No, I&#39;m serious. You really ought to slow down.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> Servant or not, you could still burn your mouth if you try to eat it all in just a few bites.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> Here. Try bringing the spoon up to your lips and blowing on it before you take a bite.</p><p><strong>Arjuna Alter:</strong><br> ...(Blowing gently)</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> That&#39;s it. Perfect.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> (It might be rude of me to even be thinking this, seeing how he&#39;s practically a god...)</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> (...but in some ways, he reminds me a lot of, well, us.)</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> (We homunculi are born fully grown, and exist solely to fulfill our designated purpose.)</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> (At least, that&#39;s how we&#39;re designed.)</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> (But now, he&#39;s changing naturally over time,<br> just like we do.)</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> (It just goes to show that, even transient as our existences may be...we&#39;re all still alive.)</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong><br> Go on, eat up.<br> You need plenty of stamina to defeat a dragon, after all.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> Oh, that reminds me. I had a question about that.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> See, neither Siegfried nor Sigurd will tell me any details about how they defeated their dragons.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> Pretty much all they say is that they were so desperate to survive, that they don&#39;t remember anything.</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong><br> Ah, yes, well...I&#39;m afraid that&#39;s rather complicated.</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong><br> It may very well be that they simply are not able to tell you anything.</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong><br> You see, fighting a dragon is very different from fighting a typical monster.</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong><br> True dragons, like Fafnir, are born from an abundance of human greed, and are thus more like concepts than actual creatures.</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong><br> They are great lizards and formless demons all at once. Thus, defeating one demands the entirety of your being and ability.</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong><br> If you can&#39;t pull out every bit of strength you&#39;ve gained from your life up to that point, the dragon will do it for you.</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong><br> That is the threat true dragons pose.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Um... I&#39;m not sure I get what you mean.</p><hr><p><strong>Georgios:</strong><br> What I mean is, facing a dragon is no different from telling the story of your entire life.</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong><br> Describing the broad strokes is easy enough, but delving into details can soon become embarrassing.</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong><br> Not to mention that in many cases, we simply cannot recall some things any longer.</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong><br> That&#39;s why we can only discuss surface level tricks, like the best way to get your sword through their scales.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> (So Georgios can&#39;t describe it well, either...<br> I guess that&#39;s just how it is?)</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> So what&#39;s a dragon&#39;s weakness? Its chin?</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong><br> Dragons can have many different weaknesses, but you should also not expect them to have any at all.</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong><br> Still, we can plan ahead for a few possible patterns, then go over how to–</p><p><strong>Arjuna Alter:</strong><br> ...?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Everything all right?</p><hr><p><strong>Arjuna Alter:</strong><br> Something is headed this way.</p><p><strong>==ARROW==</strong></p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> I never imagined the river would fracture vertically. That was close.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> That wasn&#39;t like Lambdaryllis&#39;s ice waves.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Some kind of undulation came from upstream that caused the frozen river to temporarily break apart.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Welp, now I need to work on a way to detect these undulations before they reach you.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> That wasn&#39;t like Lambdaryllis&#39;s ice waves.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Some kind of undulation came from upstream that caused the frozen river to temporarily break apart.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Welp, now I need to work on a way to detect these undulations before they reach you.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Is everyone all right?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> We&#39;re okay! We managed to dodge it!</p><hr><p><strong>Arjuna Alter:</strong><br> Here comes another one. Get ready.</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong><br> It&#39;s coming down the left side!<br> Move to the right!</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong><br> If we get swallowed up in one of those fissures...</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong><br> ...we&#39;ll end up trapped below the river&#39;s frozen surface with no way out.</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong><br> Fortunately, strange as it may sound, the fissures also repair themselves quickly, so the ice should still be safe to traverse once the danger has passed.</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong><br> We&#39;ll just have to make our way along this narrow river while evading direct contact with the fissures.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> So we&#39;re FPS strafing.</p><hr><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> I&#39;ve seen Ganesha playing games like that. They seem like a good way to improve hand-eye coordination.</p><p><strong>Arjuna Alter:</strong><br> Any threat with the potential to kill Master is...evil...</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> Hold on. I&#39;m sure you&#39;re more than strong enough to just block those fissures outright, but if you do that, the backlash will just create even more fissures.</p><p><strong>Arjuna Alter:</strong><br> I see. So if I destroy these fissures now, Master will be unable to progress any further.</p><p><strong>Arjuna Alter:</strong><br> Understood. Then for now, I will focus solely on<br> defending [♂ him /♀️ her], until I can eliminate this evil at its source.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> You guys all rode Tarasque to evade a similar threat before, right?</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> I wish I could turn into my dragon form more easily so I could fly you all to the target...</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> ...but it&#39;s just too hard to maintain that Noble Phantasm for that long.</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong><br> That&#39;s quite all right. We can evade this threat ourselves easily enough, and we wouldn&#39;t want you to be exhausted by the time we get to the big fight.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> Come to think of it, that reminds me of another important question I had.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> While I do possess Siegfried&#39;s dragon-slaying power, I&#39;m also part Fafnir myself.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> So, um... Does that mean you&#39;re going to go all “originating from sin” on me?</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong><br> Hehe, not to worry. I&#39;m not about to put an ally to the sword merely because they happen to be part dragon.</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong><br> As I said before, dragons are more akin to concepts than creatures.</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong><br> If someone still possesses such a concept<br> even after becoming a Servant...</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong><br> ...then there must be a good reason.</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong><br> I can understand that there are circumstances in which a dragon becomes an inextricable part of a Servant&#39;s life, or duty, or fate.</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong><br> Though of course, being who I am, I will still remain vigilant around them.</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong><br> Yes. For example...</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong><br> Even if that Servant was an ally fighting on my side...</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong><br> ...and even were they someone with whom I had previously shared pleasant conversations...</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong><br> ...should I determine they were, in fact, an evil dragon who must be put the sword, I would not hesitate to do so.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> ...Got it. Then I&#39;ll do everything I can to make sure I don&#39;t end up turning evil.</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong><br> If you can say that and mean it, then you&#39;ll be just fine. I guarantee it.</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> Here comes another one. Time for more sidestep training. Be ready!</p><p><strong>Arjuna Alter:</strong><br> Master, please move to your ten o&#39;clock. And quickly. No evil will escape my sight.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> You should be fairly close to the target now...<br> Does anything seem different?</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> ...Yes. I can hear something.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> That sounds...familiar...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> No way. Is that what&#39;s been causing those fissures?</p><hr><p><strong>Vritra:</strong><br> Ah yes, I do enjoy singing.<br> It&#39;s been so long since I&#39;ve last heard any.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Whoa, no singing? I can&#39;t even imagine what a dull life you must have led. You poor thing.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> But that must mean your ears are just overloaded with delight now!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> You are just so amazingly lucky to end your musical dry spell with a bunch of MY songs!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Plus, I think you&#39;re the first audience who&#39;s ever–Ahem, I mean, the first in a long time...</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> ...to stay and listen quietly instead of writhing around on the floor or running away as fast as you can!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> So, any requests? Maybe a ballad that&#39;ll have you spilling your bodily fluids?</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Or an unhealthy metal number that&#39;ll ramp up your taste for cruelty?</p><p><strong>Vritra:</strong><br> Hmm. Surprise me.</p><p><strong>Vritra:</strong><br> I do enjoy singing, but I don&#39;t know much about it.<br> Or rather, I can&#39;t really tell songs apart.</p><p><strong>Vritra:</strong><br> There is just something nice about singing, period.<br> It makes everything more fun.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Wait. Does that mean you couldn&#39;t tell the difference between any of the songs I&#39;ve sung so far?</p><p><strong>Vritra:</strong><br> Honestly, no.</p><p><strong>Vritra:</strong><br> Oh, but don&#39;t worry. I could tell that some were like clawing a piece of steel with a scale, while others were more akin to death throes.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> So you&#39;re just happy with any song at all? I mean low standards is one thing, but this is insane!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Maybe I shouldn&#39;t have gotten so carried away? Or maybe I&#39;d be better off being evaluated by one of those karaoke scoring machines?</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Wait, never mind that now! [♂ Puppy /♀️ Deerlet]!<br> When did you get here!?</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Well this changes everything! At first I thought we were filming a promo video or something, not an actual concert...</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> ...so I&#39;m relieved to see my live audience growing!</p><p><strong>Vritra:</strong><br> Didn&#39;t I tell you more would be coming?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> That must be Elly&#39;s shadow then.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Right. She appears to be the same type of reproduction we&#39;ve seen in other occluded Singularities.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> So that&#39;s not really her? Good. Then I won&#39;t have to worry about holding back.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Huh? You&#39;re in the presence of a genuine stage idol, and that&#39;s all you have to say? Are you one of those people who doesn&#39;t “get” music or something?</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> Yes, I suppose I am. I&#39;m sorry.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Hey, at least you&#39;re honest! That counts for a lot in my book. Anyway, that must mean this is your first concert ever, right!?</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> It&#39;s practically the destiny of an idol&#39;s idol like me to help guys like you see the light of our glory!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> How about the rest of you then?<br> Got any favorite genres?</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong><br> I&#39;ve always enjoyed hymns, myself.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Hymns, huh? That sounds like songs of encouragement!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Okay, got it! I sing those kinds of songs to myself all the time anyway, so I&#39;m sure I can hymn it up all day!</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> I&#39;ve heard some people like to listen to music on headphones while doing their roadwork.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> So you want catchy songs to get you pumped up! Got it!</p><p><strong>Arjuna Alter:</strong><br> I never had many chances to engage with music myself.</p><p><strong>Arjuna Alter:</strong><br> I used to think I could never understand it, but oddly, after hearing your singing voice...I felt something.</p><p><strong>Arjuna Alter:</strong><br> The lilt of your intonation. The rhythm of your words. I see... So that is music.</p><p><strong>Arjuna Alter:</strong><br> I never dreamed I would hear sounds that spoke to me like that after I stripped myself of all desires besides those pertaining to my duty.</p><p><strong>Arjuna Alter:</strong><br> This has been a novel–even comforting experience.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Whoa, whoa! What&#39;s even happening here!?</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> I can&#39;t remember the last time I had someone in the<br> audience just straight up compliment me!Want an<br> autograph? A photo book?A commemorative CD set?</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Oh wow, my very own stan! You&#39;re going for my<br> entire pin collection!? Thanks!</p><p><strong>Arjuna Alter:</strong><br> This...certainly is...a lot of stuff.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Damn, she&#39;s pushing her merch on him like crazy! I guess this was bound to happen when the Hero of the Endowed finally met a wannabe idol.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Damn, she&#39;s pushing her merch on him like crazy! I guess this was bound to happen when the Hero of the Endowed finally met a wannabe idol.</p><p><strong>Vritra:</strong><br> Hmm? And who is that?</p><p><strong>Vritra:</strong><br> He smells...strange. Far too much<br> like the gods for my liking.</p><p><strong>Vritra:</strong><br> So even beings like that can become empty shadows?<br> How annoying.</p><p><strong>Vritra:</strong><br> Well, no matter. Since I have no intention of fighting any gods just yet, I think I will let Elisabeth here handle this and be on my–</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> Hold it, Vritra.</p><p><strong>Vritra:</strong><br> Oh? You have a strange aura about you too, boy.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> I&#39;m a dragon, too.<br> ...Well, I guess I should say I&#39;m also a dragon.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> That&#39;s why I want to talk to you.</p><p><strong>Vritra:</strong><br> And I should hear what you have to say because we are two of a kind? Is that it?</p><p><strong>Vritra:</strong><br> Don&#39;t bother. That doesn&#39;t mean anything to me.</p><p><strong>Vritra:</strong><br> Even Elisabeth here only acquired<br> that form through a twist of fate.</p><p><strong>Vritra:</strong><br> I didn&#39;t choose her for this because she&#39;s a dragon.</p><p><strong>Vritra:</strong><br> No, wait... ARE you actually a dragon?</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Hehehe. Let&#39;s just say we idols have lots of secrets, by which I mean “No comment.”</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> The only other thing I&#39;ll say is that we&#39;re obligated to be everyone&#39;s fantasy. We&#39;re pretty meta like that.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> ...I know what she is. She&#39;s an Innocent Monster.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> She ended up that way because the things she did in life were said to be so depraved that people thought she had ties to demons.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> I don&#39;t know how true this is, but according to Chaldea&#39;s database...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> ...Elisabeth gained her dragon properties because the Báthory family coat of arms included dragon teeth.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Though personally, I think there&#39;s a<br> little more to the story than that.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> I don&#39;t know how true this is, but according to Chaldea&#39;s database...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> ...Elisabeth gained her dragon properties because the Báthory family coat of arms included dragon teeth.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Though personally, I think there&#39;s a<br> little more to the story than that.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> ...True. There&#39;s a reason I&#39;m a dragon, so there must be a reason she is, too.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> And I&#39;m sure there&#39;s a reason you are as well, Vritra.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> Although, maybe it was foolish of me to try to talk to you dragon to dragon...</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> However, Santa doesn&#39;t care if you&#39;re a dragon or a serpent. That has nothing to do with why I&#39;m here.</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> All I want is to take back Christmas, and become a true Santa Claus.</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> You can&#39;t be too considerate of your opponent&#39;s circumstances, Sieg. It&#39;ll only weaken your fists.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> I see. I guess you&#39;re probably right...</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> Okay. Everything else aside,<br> I understand what it is we have to do now.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> Thank you for reminding me that I&#39;m here today as a dragon-slayer, not a dragon.</p><p><strong>Arjuna Alter:</strong><br> I am here...to pass judgment on evil. So first, Vritra...I will see if that is what you are...</p><p><strong>Vritra:</strong><br> I already told you, I&#39;m not going to fight any gods today. I&#39;ve always been one to save the best for last.</p><p><strong>Vritra:</strong><br> Don&#39;t worry, it&#39;s just about timing. I&#39;ll face you all myself soon enough.</p><p><strong>Vritra:</strong><br> If I were you, I&#39;d make sure I was as strong as I could possibly be before that time comes.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It looks like she got away again...</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> Not a problem. I can tell we&#39;re driving her deeper into the corner of the ring with every step.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> If that&#39;s what you think, Karna,<br> that&#39;s good enough for me.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> My goal for today is to help Santa and free this occluded Singularity, and I&#39;m going to do everything I can to make that happen.</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong><br> Yes, I think that&#39;s for the best. You can&#39;t go straight for a dragon&#39;s eye and expect your sword will reach it.</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong><br> It&#39;s best to start by attacking its limbs and throwing it off balance.</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong><br> Strange though it may seem, there is more to being a dragon-slayer than merely slaying a dragon.</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong><br> That part only comes when one has proven they have the will to stay and fight...</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong><br> ...even when faced with an adversary as formidable as a dragon.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> I see. Well, if there&#39;s one thing I have going for me, it&#39;s my will.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> I owe Siegfried my life. Now that he&#39;s entrusted me with this mission, running away is simply not an option.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> I don&#39;t know if I&#39;m up to becoming a dragon-slayer or not, but I won&#39;t do less than my best!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Huh? You guys are gonna try to slay me now? Seriously?</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Look, I can understand being so infatuated with me that you&#39;d rather slay me than share me with anyone else, but I&#39;m sorry, idols just don&#39;t do romance. It&#39;d be such a scandal for the rest of our adoring fans.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> Oh, uh, no, that&#39;s not what I meant.<br> It was just a figure of speech.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> (Although, copy or not, if we have to defeat her,<br> I guess she&#39;ll still end up dead anyway...right?)</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Ohhh, I gotcha. So you&#39;re basically saying you&#39;ve gotta treat every concert as if it were a battlefield. Well yeah, duh.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> All right! Get ready for the concert of a lifetime!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> We&#39;re gonna have to fight back if we want to makeit out of here with our hearing–I mean, lives!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> No concerts, please! I&#39;m, uh, more of a streaming !</p><hr><p><strong>==ARROW==</strong></p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Huh? It&#39;s over already?</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> But I only just finished warming up my vocal chords! Can&#39;t I at least get an encooore!?</p><p><strong>Arjuna Alter:</strong><br> ...I can no longer hear that song...</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> Don&#39;t worry. You can hear it anytime you want once you get back to Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> Also, I have a sneaking suspicion you might also enjoy that one Roman emperor&#39;s singing too.</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong><br> Well, Lord Sieg? How do you feel now that you&#39;ve achieved a great victory in your mission?</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> Honestly, I still don&#39;t know. I&#39;m not sure that I did a good job here, much less “achieved a great victory.”</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> I think I did at least manage to do what I was supposed to as today&#39;s dragon-slayer...</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> ...but this only reaffirms for me that I&#39;ll never be the kind of hero Siegfried is.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> I&#39;m a dragon, and a dragon-slayer. Both and neither at the same time. That&#39;s just who I am.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> That said–</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Okay, Santa, there&#39;s the core!<br> Go ahead and do your thing!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Okay, Santa, there&#39;s the core!<br> Go ahead and do your thing!</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> That said...now that I&#39;ve gotten to fight alongside Master, as well as all of you...</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> ...I do feel like I can hold my head a little higher than I could before.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong><br> I think, maybe...this is what it feels like to be proud of who you are.</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong><br> I see. Perhaps it was in fact that very feeling Lord Siegfried wished to give you as a gift.</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong><br> It is that time of year, after all.</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> Hmm. Well, if we&#39;re talking gifts, then as Santa, I can&#39;t afford to fall behind.</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> Still, after hearing that, I think I accomplished the bare minimum of what I needed to as well.</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> Boxers are supposed to inspire children by how bravely they fight, after all. This works out perfectly, so consider that your present from me.</p><p><strong>Arjuna Alter:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Master, Arjuna Alter has been staring at the river for a while now.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> It is a beautiful river, isn&#39;t it?I&#39;m glad we were able to restore it.</p><hr><p><strong>Arjuna Alter:</strong><br> Master. Is this scenery...normal?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I&#39;d say so.</p><p><strong>Arjuna Alter:</strong><br> ...I see.</p><p><strong>Arjuna Alter:</strong><br> There is nothing I either like or dislike, so I have no criteria by which to judge it...</p><p><strong>Arjuna Alter:</strong><br> ...but if you say it&#39;s normal, then I&#39;ll trust that it is.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> It&#39;s not just normal. It&#39;s awesome.</p><p><strong>Arjuna Alter:</strong><br> ...Yes, I suppose it is.</p><p><strong>Arjuna Alter:</strong><br> There is nothing I either like or dislike, but if this scenery brings a smile to your face...</p><p><strong>Arjuna Alter:</strong><br> ...then I am certain its tranquility<br> must be a very good thing indeed.</p><hr><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> All right, only one more occluded Singularity left to go. This could well be the site of our final battle.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> So let&#39;s go out there and give it all we&#39;ve got!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> All right, only one more occluded Singularity left to go.

There&#39;s gonna be a bunch more hazards popping up from both above and below!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I wish we could figure out how to anticipate them so we could you better warning, but the best we can do right now is warn you right before they show up!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Heads up!

Get out of there!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Next, I have a forecast for the next round of fire bombs headed your way!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> They should reach you in about twenty to thirty seconds, though they may change trajectory depending on where they hit the iceberg!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> ...Have things settled down?<br> At least for the most part?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> ...Have things settled down?<br> At least for the most part?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes, it would seem so.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Though between the ice geysers bursting out of the ground, and the fire bombs coming at you from a distance at the same time...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...it has been yet another difficult environment to traverse.</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong><br> Well, you certainly don&#39;t come across a frozen field of lava every day. No surprise that it is both strange and dangerous.</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> Be that as it may, our only option is to keep making our way forward.</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> The only time you can stop moving feet during a roadwork session is when you&#39;re shadowboxing.</p><p><strong>Arjuna Alter:</strong><br> So, this evil seeks to interfere with our effort to eradicate a greater evil at its source... The world is still just as full of evil as ever...</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong><br> So hey, are you sure I&#39;m the right guy for this job?</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong><br> Sure, I did defeat a dragon...</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong><br> ...but that was when I was an old man,<br> not in my prime like I am now.</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong><br> I mean, I still remember doing it,<br> since I&#39;m a Servant and all...</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong><br> But at this point, fighting a dragon now sounds like more of a hassle than anything.</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong><br> So I don&#39;t know how much help I&#39;m gonna be here.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Don&#39;t worry, you&#39;ll be fine. We crunched the numbers, and you&#39;ve definitely got what it takes for this mission.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Besides, you&#39;re not gonna leave<br> after coming this far, right?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Don&#39;t worry, you&#39;ll be fine. We crunched the numbers, and you&#39;ve definitely got what it takes for this mission.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Besides, you&#39;re not gonna leave<br> after coming this far, right?</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong><br> Hell no. Just &#39;cause I don&#39;t like dragons doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m gonna pass up a party like this!</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong><br> And hey, since I won&#39;t be fighting it on my own, maybe I can even let one of you guys handle the annoying parts of fighting a dragon and just enjoy going to town on it.</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong><br> &#39;Sides, I like this Santa&#39;s style. Ain&#39;t many things more hardcore than fighting with just your fists.</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> I couldn&#39;t have said it better myself.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Guys, it&#39;s great that you&#39;re both fired up,but maybe don&#39;t goad each other right now?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I know what you guys are thinking, and now&#39;s not the time.</p><hr><p><strong>Georgios:</strong><br> Agreed. Now is absolutely not the time for an impromptu sparring match. Save it for later.</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong><br> Right now, we need to focus on making our way forward while avoiding these obstacles.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Well, I can tell you guys what we know so far.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> It looks like the ice geysers are a natural phenomenon, but the fire bombs are probably some kind of attack.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> They&#39;ve all been making a beeline for you guys, and there are no signs of them anywhere else.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> I&#39;m also pretty sure their cores are made up of lumps of igneous rock taken straight from the area you&#39;re in.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> So whoever&#39;s lobbing them is probably digging up or shattering frozen rocks, enveloping them in superheated flame...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> ...and firing them at you with all the force of a siege engine.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> They&#39;re as hot as they are heavy, and you really don&#39;t want one hitting you.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Well, I can tell you guys what we know so far.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> It looks like the ice geysers are a natural phenomenon, but the fire bombs are probably some kind of attack.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> They&#39;ve all been making a beeline for you guys, and there are no signs of them anywhere else.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> I&#39;m also pretty sure their cores are made up of lumps of igneous rock taken straight from the area you&#39;re in.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> So whoever&#39;s lobbing them is probably digging up or shattering frozen rocks, enveloping them in superheated flame...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> ...and firing them at you with all the force of a siege engine.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> They&#39;re as hot as they are heavy, and you really don&#39;t want one hitting you.</p><p><strong>Arjuna Alter:</strong><br> Not a problem. If nothing else, I will make certain no evil reaches Master.</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong><br> The enemy must be raring to go if they&#39;re already chucking these things at us. My kinda party!</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong><br> By the way, I don&#39;t know much about this Vritra dragon. Does she breathe fire and stuff?</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> I think she may have, considering that some stories say she was born from fire.</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong><br> You don&#39;t say.</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong><br> As I recall, the dragon you defeated was also a fire-breather, correct?</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong><br> You and I haven&#39;t had many chances to talk until now...</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong><br> ...so I&#39;m hoping to take this opportunity to learn more of your own dragon-slaying tale.</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong><br> I&#39;d like to oblige, but like I said,<br> it was a much older me who did that.</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong><br> And honestly, I don&#39;t remember much of it very clearly.</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong><br> How did I feel about it? Was I glad to go?<br> Did I enjoy it? Was I afraid? I have no idea.</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong><br> All I can say for sure is...</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong><br> ...I did it &#39;cause I had to.</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong><br> I was a king back then. Didn&#39;t matter that I never set out to be one.</p><p><strong>Arjuna Alter:</strong><br> I understand. Evil had to be punished, didn&#39;t it?</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong><br> Maybe. The main thing is that I was king, so I couldn&#39;t stand back and do nothing while the dragon was eating my people.</p><p><strong>Arjuna Alter:</strong><br> I see...</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong><br> Well said.</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong><br> As a follower of the Lord, I could not turn away way when I came across that town under a poisonous dragon&#39;s talon.</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong><br> Doing nothing was never an option.<br> It had to be slain, so I slew it.</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong><br> It does seem fate plays at least some role in steering us toward most dragon hunts.</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> I don&#39;t know about that, but I do agree about doing what needs to be done.</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> Just like how I have to do this to become a true Santa Claus...</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> ...and take back Christmas as it&#39;s meant to be.</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong><br> Does that mean even the Hero of Benefaction hates seeing a kid cry at not being able to open their present?</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> ...There have always been things people desired–things they needed, to survive.</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> As someone who possessed such things, it was only natural for me to share them with those I met who needed them.</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> I never gave much thought to what happened to them afterwards...but, you may be right.</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> I do think there&#39;s something wrong with giving someone a gift that makes them sad instead of happy.</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> In fact, Ganesha just recently admonished me about this.</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> “Getting people&#39;s hopes up only to dash them is the worst! Especially when you do it with a totally straight face like that!”</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Then I guess we&#39;ll just have to do our bestto resolve this situation, won&#39;t we?</p><hr><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> Of course. Come on, let&#39;s go.</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong><br> Tch, now we&#39;re seeing more of those geysers and fire bombs than ever!</p><p><strong>Arjuna Alter:</strong><br> I will cut them all down...!</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong><br> Make sure to conserve your magical energy!<br> You&#39;ll need every bit of it for the main fight!</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> Master, I think you should hold on to my back.<br> It&#39;ll be easier to sidestep and parry that way.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> O-okay, if you insist!</p><hr><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong><br> We haven&#39;t made much progress in a while, have we?</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong><br> Be nice if we could at least focus on just the ice geysers or the fire bombs instead of both at once.</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong><br> Hrah! Haha, now that&#39;s hot!</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong><br> I swear, there&#39;s no end to this fire, is there? I wonder if this is what it was like with the dragon I fought, too.</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong><br> ...You know, I think that might&#39;ve jogged my memory. How&#39;d I do this last time...?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Did you remember a strategy that could help us, Beowulf!?</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong><br> I&#39;m not sure. But whatever I did back then,<br> I bet it went something like this!</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong><br> First, I dodge this son of a bitch...</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong><br> Then I chop it down!<br> Hrunting Nailing!</p><p><strong>Arjuna Alter:</strong><br> ...?</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong><br> Next, I pick it up, and...<br> Hnghhh!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> You cut down that ice pillar and made it into a shield! Nice! But, uh, isn&#39;t it kind of heavy!?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> You cut down that ice pillar and made it into a shield! Nice! But, uh, isn&#39;t it kind of heavy!?</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong><br> &#39;Course it is! That&#39;s why we gotta hurry! Come on!</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong><br> Sir Karna, take Master and stay behind Sir Beowulf! Sir Alter and I will help him fend off the fire bombs!</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> Got it.</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong><br> Lady Mash, Lady Da Vinci, please focus on warning us about upcoming geysers. We&#39;ll take care of the rest!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> But, won&#39;t the heat from the fire bombs melt that ice shield pretty quickly!?</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong><br> Not a problem! I&#39;ll just make another one every time that happens! Now come on!</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong><br> (Impressive. He has all the incredible power of his youth, and the wisdom of a wise king.)</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong><br> (I knew you would be a fine dragon-slayer, Sir Beowulf.)</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong><br> All right! We&#39;re here!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> There, I see them! It&#39;s Vritra and...Kiyohime!</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> Hello, Master♡ It&#39;s about time you got here!</p><p><strong>Vritra:</strong><br> Hmm. I&#39;m not sure how, but I think I made a mistake with this one&#39;s copy.</p><p><strong>Vritra:</strong><br> Or are Berserkers just...like this?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> They really are.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Well, this IS Kiyo-yo we&#39;re talking about, so...</p><hr><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> Ahh, I knew it! I knew you would understand everything without so much as a single word, Master!</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> This can truly only be...destiny! Love! Je t&#39;aime!</p><p><strong>Vritra:</strong><br> Hm. No. I still don&#39;t get it.</p><p><strong>Vritra:</strong><br> Almost as soon as I made her, she started flinging those fire bombs your way. I didn&#39;t even say anything.</p><p><strong>Vritra:</strong><br> What did you do to get on her bad side?</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> My, how dare you! I never breathed so much as a lick of fire! Those weren&#39;t fire bombs; they were love bombs!</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> I knew that if I flung them at my darling Master,<br> [♂ he /♀️ she] would follow them straight to me!</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong><br> Hmm. True, I suppose getting lost is one thing we never had to worry about...</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> First, I channeled my overwhelming love into scooping out great hunks of ice... Infused them with a burst of my deep, passionate love...</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> ...then I just wished for my love to be reciprocated as I put my back into flinging them towards the object of my affection!</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> Ahh, what an elegant, dainty, compassionate way to lead my beloved to me... And now that it worked so well, it&#39;s a clear sign we should have our wedding tomorrow, if not sooner!</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> Incidentally, I got the idea for making a trail out of bread crumbs from an old fairy tale!</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> I think it was called “Hansel and Gretel”?</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong><br> Grendel? Now what&#39;d he do?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I don&#39;t think she&#39;s talking about your sworn enemy, Beowulf. Gretel is the name of the younger sister in the story!</p><p><strong>Vritra:</strong><br> I haven&#39;t the slightest idea what she&#39;s talking about, but her passion is something to behold.</p><p><strong>Vritra:</strong><br> She&#39;s clearly more than eager to burn you down to cinders.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> Of course! That&#39;s what love is all about!</p><p><strong>Vritra:</strong><br> (I really, really don&#39;t get it...)</p><p><strong>Vritra:</strong><br> At any rate... Yes, I think she should make a fine final obstacle.</p><p><strong>Vritra:</strong><br> If you&#39;re able to defeat her...</p><p><strong>Vritra:</strong><br> ...you should then be just about ready to face me.</p><p><strong>Vritra:</strong><br> But do be careful. The sweet spot doesn&#39;t last as long as you might think.</p><p><strong>Vritra:</strong><br> If you show her any mercy, let down your guard, or hold anything back...you could end up being too late.</p><p><strong>Vritra:</strong><br> And that would spoil my fun as well.<br> Don&#39;t disappoint me, all right?</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> Me, hold back? Never.</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> I need to defeat you as soon as possible so I can finally become a true Santa.</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> Otherwise, Christmas won&#39;t even come once this year.</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> So if I need to win this match to earn the right to challenge you, then I&#39;ll put everything I have into making my fists shine as brightly as possible.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> All right... For now, it&#39;s all eyes on Kiyohime!</p><hr><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> You only have eyes for me, Master!? Ahh, what a joy it is to hear you declare your love for me so loudly!</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> Though I do have to ask why you<br> qualified that with “for now.”</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> Because that almost makes it sound like you plan to cheat on me in the future.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> Why don&#39;t we have a little private couple&#39;s counseling inside my bell right now, just so we can...clear that up?</p><p><strong>==ARROW==</strong></p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> Oh! I just realized something.<br> I&#39;m not actually me, am I?</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> So then, does that mean Master was planning to cheat on me...with the real me?</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> I suppose I can accept th–Wait, no I can&#39;t!<br> Copy or no, I still want to keep [♂ him /♀️ her] all to myself!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> All right!</p><hr><p><strong>Vritra:</strong><br> So, you managed to overcome the final obstacle. Good.</p><p><strong>Vritra:</strong><br> Then I have no compunction about fighting you. You have proven yourselves worthy of facing me.</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong><br> Heh! Well ain&#39;t that nice of you!</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> Nothing more need be said.</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> You won&#39;t get away. All that&#39;s left now is for me to defeat you, and become a true Santa.</p><p><strong>Vritra:</strong><br> Good, good. That&#39;s the spirit.</p><p><strong>Vritra:</strong><br> Oh, but before we get started, let me just say this:</p><p><strong>Vritra:</strong><br> I don&#39;t care how much you scream, or cry, or otherwise make an absolute disgrace of yourselves.</p><p><strong>Vritra:</strong><br> Actually, I absolutely love that. Just thinking about it sends shivers down my tail.</p><p><strong>Vritra:</strong><br> But whatever you do...don&#39;t give up in the middle of things. That would be pathetically anticlimactic.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Vritra&#39;s magical energy pattern is changing...<br> She&#39;s preparing to attack! Please be careful, Master!</p><p><strong>==ARROW==</strong></p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> She&#39;s so strong!!!</p><hr><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> ...This isn&#39;t...over yet. I&#39;ll keep...getting up...as many times...as it takes...!</p><p><strong>Arjuna Alter:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong><br> (Everyone&#39;s standing their ground admirably...but we&#39;ve all taken a lot of damage. And that&#39;s not all!)</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong><br> The hell&#39;s going on here?<br> We&#39;re not even touching her!</p><p><strong>Vritra:</strong><br> Hmm. I seem to have grown accustomed to this much sooner than I expected.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Is that...a Holy Grail!?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> So she did have a Holy Grail all along.<br> I thought as much.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Even for a being as powerful as Vritra...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> ...interfering with Santa&#39;s power at its root,<br> and blocking off multiple Singularities at once...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> ...would have been well beyond her ability to achieve alone.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> But even setting that aside, where is that nigh-invulnerability coming from?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> So she did have a Holy Grail all along.<br> I thought as much.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Even for a being as powerful as Vritra...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> ...interfering with Santa&#39;s power at its root,<br> and blocking off multiple Singularities at once...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> ...would have been well beyond her ability to achieve alone.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> But even setting that aside, where is that nigh-invulnerability coming from?</p><p><strong>Vritra:</strong><br> I should have known I would have trouble getting used to power other than my own.

If anything, you gave up much too soon.</p><p><strong>Vritra:</strong><br> Keeheehee! Very well, child of Indra!</p><p><strong>Vritra:</strong><br> I&#39;ll play along with your game for now.</p><p><strong>Vritra:</strong><br> Besides, it&#39;s not as though anything will change if I wait a little longer.</p><p><strong>Vritra:</strong><br> You have one day.

Do you think you could check in on him for me, Master?</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> If he still hasn&#39;t figured it out, then I&#39;ll take responsibility for this and go defeat Vritra myself.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> I swear it on my father, Indra.</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> Maybe he meant there&#39;s something besides a lack of training that&#39;s stopping me from becoming a true Santa.</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> But if there is, I don&#39;t know what it could be.</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> Why is being the Hero of Benefaction alone not enough?</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> I&#39;ve watched the other Santa Clauses,<br> and I thought I knew what I had to do.</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> Santa is supposed to deliver presents and rule Christmas as its strongest warrior, right?</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> ...Master, you&#39;ve known the other<br> Santa Clauses for a long time.</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> Can you think of anything they have that I don&#39;t?</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> If you can, please tell me.<br> Maybe it&#39;ll help me find the answer I need.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...Well, in your case...</p><hr><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You seem like you&#39;ve been so focused on giving outgifts that you haven&#39;t been enjoying yourself much.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> It kind of feels like you&#39;ve been missingout on the joyous part of the holiday.</p><hr><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> ...!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> All the other Santas took their duties seriouslytoo, but they also took time to have fun.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> By the time Christmas was over, the other Santaslooked just as happy as everyone else.</p><hr><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> ...I see. So Santa Claus also needs fun and joy.</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> A gift he gives not just to others, but also to himself.</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> Of course. Anyone who can&#39;t even give himself a present could never hope to give them to children around the world.</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> The very idea of such a person claiming to be Santa is ridiculous. Now I see. So that is what Arjuna meant.</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> However, I don&#39;t find any joy in serving as Santa.</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> All I have is my desire to be strong–to be a true Santa.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Then why not make that your gift?</p><hr><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> Impossible. I don&#39;t have that in my sack. I&#39;d have to be a true Santa before I could give myself that gift.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Then why not let other people give it to you?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Hey, there&#39;s no rule that says Santa can&#39;treceive gifts as well as give them.</p><hr><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> !!!</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> ...I see.</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> For my own present–my own benefaction–I can give myself the gift of wanting to learn and grow.</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> And to do that, I&#39;ll also need to allow myself to receive benefaction from others.</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> If there&#39;s something my sack of presents is missing... I should just ask others for it.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Basically, I think you might have been going aboutyour duties a little TOO stoically so far.</p><hr><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> You&#39;re right. I thought being Santa was something I had to do on my own.</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> But what I really want is the strength to become someone else, like I did when I was studying under Droṇa.</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> Aśvatthāman, Duryodhana, Yudhiṣṭhira,<br> Bhima, Arjuna...</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> Some of them were enemies, but I may never have become as strong as I did if it wasn&#39;t for them.</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> So...maybe I should do the same thing now. If I can&#39;t do this all on my own, I should probably ask for help.</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> Help from someone who may be able to make me stronger.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Sounds like a plan to me.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Hey, I depend on others&#39; help all the time.</p><hr><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> ...So that&#39;s why I&#39;ve changed my mind.</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> My goal is still to become a true Santa, but now I&#39;m not going to avoid things that will help me reach that goal.</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> From now on, I&#39;m not only going to deliver presents. I&#39;m also going to accept them.</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> That&#39;s why I&#39;m here now.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Sounds good to me! Believe me, if there&#39;s any way we can help, we&#39;re happy to do it.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Sounds good to me! Believe me, if there&#39;s any way we can help, we&#39;re happy to do it.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I feel the same way. I&#39;m happy to keep supporting you as best I can from here!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> So, what exactly do you need from us?</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> What I need is to defeat Vritra.</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> Will you lend me your power so I can achieve that?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Of course. I&#39;ve already got other dragon-slayers lined up, so all you have to do is say the word.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Let&#39;s see.

Something Arjuna must have realized, too.</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> If we&#39;re going to defeat Vritra now that she has the power of a Holy Grail, we&#39;re going to need a plan of our own.</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> So instead of a dragon-slayer, I&#39;d like you to call on...</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> You do know authors only write stories about dragons, right? We don&#39;t actually go and hunt them.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> Were my specialty nonfiction, I might consider research that&#39;s less...exciting than fighting dragons, but unfortunately for you, I write fairy tales.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> But, all right, fine.<br> I just hope I don&#39;t end up as an author-sized snack...</p><p><strong>Scheherazade:</strong><br> A dragon?

Master, is that...?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> An evil dragon rolling around in the snow? Yup.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> An evil dragon tumbling around like a child? Yup.</p><hr><p><strong>Vritra:</strong><br> Aah!<br> ...So, you&#39;ve finally come.</p><p><strong>Vritra:</strong><br> Wh-why are you looking at me like that?<br> I wasn&#39;t doing anything strange.</p><p><strong>Vritra:</strong><br> I like keeping clean, so I was just using the snow to bathe.

It&#39;s very refreshing.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Well, at least we know she doesn&#39;t hibernate.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Well, at least we know she doesn&#39;t hibernate.</p><p><strong>Vritra:</strong><br> Hmm? I see the godlike one who bears the face of Indra&#39;s child is here, but I don&#39;t see the child himself.</p><p><strong>Vritra:</strong><br> And after I went out of my way to honor his request and wait before killing you.</p><p><strong>Vritra:</strong><br> Does this mean you know what it is I truly want too then?</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> No. We&#39;re only hear to defeat you once and for all.</p><p><strong>Vritra:</strong><br> ...<br> Well, no matter.</p><p><strong>Vritra:</strong><br> So I take it that means you&#39;ve found a way to defeat me, even though I&#39;ve gotten used to this Holy Grail thing&#39;s power?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> (Her magical energy is incredible! I can already tell they&#39;ll never be able to get past her defenses just by fighting like they usually do. But–)</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> I know. The secret to why our attacks didn&#39;t reach you...</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> ...is that the Holy Grail&#39;s power drew out the protection you possessed in your legends.</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> You may not have had it when you first materialized, but I&#39;m sure the Holy Grail changed that.</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> After all, that protection was<br> something you always possessed.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> One of your stories says you formed a contract with the gods that said you could never be slain during the day or night, by weapons of wood or stone, or by anything wet or dry.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Of course, some people say that story actually originated with the demon Namuci, even though you&#39;re frequently treated as the same being.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> One of your stories says you formed a contract with the gods that said you could never be slain during the day or night, by weapons of wood or stone, or by anything wet or dry.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Of course, some people say that story actually originated with the demon Namuci, even though you&#39;re frequently treated as the same being.</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> Now we know it wasn&#39;t simply some defensive power or a magical energy barrier that stopped our attacks from reaching you.</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> It is because of a trait ascribed to you in myth, which means we have ways to get around it.</p><p><strong>Vritra:</strong><br> Keeheehee. So, you knew about my contract with the gods. Well, that&#39;s all right.</p><p><strong>Vritra:</strong><br> After all, surely you don&#39;t still think you can defeat me with your fists alone, do you?</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong><br> True. My sword had no effect on you, but Sir Karna and Sir Beowulf&#39;s fists did, at least by comparison.</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong><br> I understand now the reason for that is they were weapons that were neither wood nor stone, neither wet nor dry.</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong><br> Of course, we haven&#39;t forgotten that their attacks never quite reached you.</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> Which is why we&#39;ve gone further today.</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> We&#39;ve recreated the same circumstances that enabled Indra to defeat you, even bound by your contract.</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> First, he chose to fight you at twilight, which is neither night nor day.</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> And second...</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> ...Ha! He killed you with something that was neither wet nor dry: foam!</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> I do think as twists go, that could use a little more foreshadowing, but I can&#39;t deny that fantastical leaps of logic can sometimes be quite engaging for readers!</p><p><strong>Scheherazade:</strong><br> The very idea of fighting a dragon myself is too terrible to consider, but if this is all you need from me, I should be able to manage...</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> I&#39;m no Shakespeare, but wrapping you guys up in foam should still be pretty easy. Especially since I won&#39;t have to do any editing passes.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> Enchant! Go ahead, take all the tragic foam you need!</p><p><strong>Scheherazade:</strong><br> Allow me to tell you a story.<br> The queen of serpents once said,</p><p><strong>Scheherazade:</strong><br> “If I am to be boiled in a pot, collect the first layer of foam that spreads upon the water in a bottle, and drink the second layer yourself...”</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> So we&#39;re going to do the same thing,<br> and defeat you with foam.</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> For foam is something that is neither a weapon,<br> nor wet, nor dry!</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong><br> Could you apply some to my sword as well?</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong><br> It may not work as well on that as it does on fists, but I&#39;m certain it will still be helpful!</p><p><strong>Arjuna Alter:</strong><br> It doesn&#39;t matter what form the sword of purging takes. All that matters is that evil is eradicated...</p><p><strong>Vritra:</strong><br> Keeheehee!<br> Excellent! That&#39;s more like it!</p><p><strong>Vritra:</strong><br> Maybe you really will be able to grant my wish after all.</p><p><strong>Vritra:</strong><br> Go on then, let me hear your agonized screams, your pitiful sobs. Let me watch you struggle and fail like the insignificant little specks you are!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Andersen and Scheherazade&#39;s foam enchantments have been applied to everyone in the front line!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Everything&#39;s ready, Master!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Then let&#39;s get started!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Come on, guys! It&#39;s time to take back everyone&#39;s presents!</p><hr><p><strong>==ARROW==</strong></p><p><strong>Vritra:</strong><br> Tch!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It&#39;s working! We have the advantage!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Keep it up! Don&#39;t give her a chance to recover!</p><hr><p><strong>Georgios:</strong><br> Thy dragon, originating from sin!<br> Ascalon!</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> We&#39;ve got you pinned in the corner. Now we&#39;re going to put you down for the count!</p><p><strong>Vritra:</strong><br> Arrrgh! I felt that one under my scales!</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong><br> The blow was not as deep as I would have liked...but it was enough to throw her off balance! Now, finish her off!</p><p><strong>Vritra:</strong><br> ...!</p><p><strong>Arjuna Alter:</strong><br> ...?</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> What are you doing, Arjuna!?</p><p><strong>Arjuna Alter:</strong><br> I thought something felt strange. Now that I wield saṃvartakalpa&#39;s sword of recursion, meant to eradicate all evil...</p><p><strong>Arjuna Alter:</strong><br> ...its blade has come into contact with this being&#39;s very life. I understand now.</p><p><strong>Arjuna Alter:</strong><br> Master, I need to tell you something.<br> This dragon is not evil.</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> She&#39;s not...?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> B-but, all of Vritra&#39;s legends describe her as an evil dragon...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...and isn&#39;t what she&#39;s done with this year&#39;s Christmas presents incredibly evil!?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> ...Maybe it&#39;s just an indication that she&#39;s not entirely evil after all.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> What do you think, Fujimaru?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Given that you don&#39;t exactly seem shocked here...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> ...I&#39;m guessing you already heard<br> what&#39;s going on from Arjuna?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> ...Maybe it&#39;s just an indication that she&#39;s not entirely evil after all.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> What do you think, Fujimaru?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Given that you don&#39;t exactly seem shocked here...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> ...I&#39;m guessing you already heard<br> what&#39;s going on from Arjuna?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I should&#39;ve known you&#39;d figure it out, Da Vinci.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Yup. That&#39;s exactly what happened.</p><hr><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> Let me just say this.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> Vritra is said to be an evil dragon...but in one sense, she&#39;s also just a natural phenomenon.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> She&#39;s the incarnation of obstacles for humanity–a being whose purpose is to dam up the world.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> Let me be as clear as I can about this, Master.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> As far as humans are concerned, Vritra is both an obstacle and a trial. No more, no less.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> As the legends say, she was responsible for numerous widespread droughts, and each time, Indra killed her.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> But I don&#39;t think she caused those droughts with the goal of eradicating humanity.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> While she did cause them great distress, she also always met her end at Indra&#39;s hands–almost like she was fated to do so.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> This is only conjecture on my part, but...</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> ...arrogant as she may be, I think she&#39;s only giving us–humans and gods alike–obstacles to test us.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> That is where her true objective lies.<br> At least, that&#39;s what I think.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> ...What is that true objective, you ask?</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> Respectfully, Master, you&#39;ve seen enough yourself that I&#39;m sure you can figure it out on your own.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> S-so, did you, Master?<br> Figure out what Vritra&#39;s true objective is, I mean?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> (Given how she&#39;s acted so far...I think so.)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> (It&#39;s kind of hard to believe, but...)</p><hr><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Vritra, do you...</p><hr><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Do you like seeing humans and gods work hard to overcome adversity?</p><hr><p><strong>Vritra:</strong><br> Keeheehee! Yes, I do!</p><p><strong>Vritra:</strong><br> I love seeing both weak, insignificant humans and proud, arrogant gods struggle, persevere, wail...</p><p><strong>Vritra:</strong><br> ...and ultimately rise up to prevail over an obstacle they have to overcome. It makes my scales quiver in excitement!</p><p><strong>Vritra:</strong><br> Think about it. Humans are tiny and weak and live for barely an instant, right?</p><p><strong>Vritra:</strong><br> And gods are powerful and pompous as hell, right?</p><p><strong>Vritra:</strong><br> So what could possibly be more entertaining...</p><p><strong>Vritra:</strong><br> ...than seeing them huffing, puffing, and working themselves to the bone to take back something I&#39;ve blocked off!?</p><p><strong>Vritra:</strong><br> Of course, the best part is the moment when they finally manage to overcome whatever obstacle was in their way.</p><p><strong>Vritra:</strong><br> There wouldn&#39;t be any point if they were to simply give up and walk away.</p><p><strong>Vritra:</strong><br> No, I want to see you lot struggle and despair before finally rising to the challenge.</p><p><strong>Vritra:</strong><br> And I&#39;ll gladly be that obstacle myself as many times as I have to if it means getting to see that.</p><p><strong>Vritra:</strong><br> Not even death can stop me. I&#39;ll keep coming back to life over and over to stand in your way!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Well, she&#39;s definitely a huge sadist, not that we didn&#39;t already know that...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> But I guess this means she also has a masochistic streak, since she wants the people she torments to overcome her.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Seems like a fetish only gods, demons, and other nigh-invincible beings can really participate in.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> All right, I understand why she&#39;s been doing all this now...but don&#39;t her actions still qualify as evil?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> That might actually not be so easy to answer. It really depends on how you define evil.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> If Vritra is just symbolizing natural cycles, like water growing scarce before becoming plentiful...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> ...then the question is one of whether the cycles themselves are seen as evil.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Humans might think of a drought as evil, but that&#39;s not necessarily true for the world as a whole. It&#39;s just another natural system.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Maybe that&#39;s why Arjuna Alter doesn&#39;t consider things like that to be evil.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> I guess there could be other reasons he said she&#39;s not evil, but who knows? He&#39;s not exactly chatty.</p><p><strong>Arjuna Alter:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> (Yeah. Now that I think about it, I do get the sense there&#39;s at least one other less obvious reason.)</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> (Something we still don&#39;t know that gets to the heart of who Vritra really is...)</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Well, she&#39;s definitely a huge sadist, not that we didn&#39;t already know that...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> But I guess this means she also has a masochistic streak, since she wants the people she torments to overcome her.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Seems like a fetish only gods, demons, and other nigh-invincible beings can really participate in.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> All right, I understand why she&#39;s been doing all this now...but don&#39;t her actions still qualify as evil?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> That might actually not be so easy to answer.

That is simply what it means to be a dragon.</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> That&#39;s right. Whatever your intentions, what you&#39;re doing here is still wrong.</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> And what I need to do hasn&#39;t changed.</p><p><strong>Vritra:</strong><br> Yes, that&#39;s right.</p><p><strong>Vritra:</strong><br> I don&#39;t care whether I&#39;m evil,<br> or even whether I&#39;m a dragon.</p><p><strong>Vritra:</strong><br> I&#39;m just me, and I&#39;m not about to hold back now.</p><p><strong>Vritra:</strong><br> I want to see you tiny beings put everything you have into defeating me. I want to see you really struggle.</p><p><strong>Vritra:</strong><br> And that can only happen when you&#39;re fighting me at my full power. Taking a dive would suck all the fun out of it.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> Well I&#39;ll be damned. You almost sound as if you&#39;ve written some serialized fiction yourself.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> Generally speaking, a good author should try to pit their protagonists against the strongest enemy they can think of. The more hopeless their prospects of victory seem, the better.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> Then you leave people wondering how they could ever overcome such a foe.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> However you square that circle, there&#39;s nothing more dramatic than having your future protagonists triumph over seemingly impossible odds.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> Though of course, if you can&#39;t pull that off convincingly, you&#39;ll just end up with a book that&#39;s barely worth the paper it&#39;s printed on!</p><p><strong>Vritra:</strong><br> That is not an option.</p><p><strong>Vritra:</strong><br> I want something entertaining. I want to see something truly wonderful.</p><p><strong>Vritra:</strong><br> I want you to defeat me, and to see you weeping tears of joy when you reclaim what you so desired.</p><p><strong>Vritra:</strong><br> So what are you waiting for? If you&#39;re hoping I&#39;ll surrender, you haven&#39;t been paying attention!</p><p><strong>Vritra:</strong><br> The only way you&#39;re getting your presents back is by prying them out of my talons!</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> You&#39;re right. It doesn&#39;t matter whether you&#39;re evil or not. I have to defeat you, so I will.</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> As both this year&#39;s Santa Claus,<br> and Fujimaru&#39;s Servant...</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> ...my job is to win this battle with a decisive KO.</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> This may no longer be the Age of Gods,<br> and you may not have stolen our water...</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> ...but, with these fists, I&#39;m going to prove that humans are just as capable of overcoming your obstacles as ever!</p><p><strong>==ARROW==</strong></p><p><strong>Vritra:</strong><br> You may not be descended from Indra, but it seems you do have ties to him.</p><p><strong>Vritra:</strong><br> Will you be able to defeat me like he did!?</p><p><strong>Vritra:</strong><br> It&#39;s time we found out! Hraaah!</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> I can, and I will. That is who I am.</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> If there is something you want, it&#39;s my job to give it to you.</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> That&#39;s what it means to be Santa Claus.</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> So if what you want is to see us surpass you,<br> then that is the gift you&#39;ll get!</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> Now, get ready for my other Noble Phantasm.</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> This is a killer punch that only Santa Claus can unleash.</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> A single cross-counter guaranteed to KO any opponent...</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong></p><h1 id="graharaja-santa-cross" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#graharaja-santa-cross" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Graharaja Santa Cross!!!</h1><p><strong>Vritra:</strong><br> Guh...</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> That...is my Christmas present to you.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You did it!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> You won by KO!</p><hr><p><strong>Georgios:</strong><br> Then it seems this is finally over.</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong><br> Well done, Sir Karna. It was an honor to witness the birth of a new dragon-slayer.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> ...Huh? What&#39;s going on with these readings?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> ...Huh? What&#39;s going on with these readings?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Da Vinci, do you think these might be–</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Something just shattered!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Does this mean...there was something else blocked off inside this occluded Singularity?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Something just shattered!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Does this mean...there was something else blocked off inside this occluded Singularity?</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> It&#39;s said that Vritra sealed the world&#39;s water inside the Himalayas...</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> ...so something here must have made it possible for her to seal away other things.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> And now that seal has been broken? Then–</p><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong><br> That&#39;s right. At long last, we&#39;ve broken the seal I&#39;ve been searching for this whole time.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Oh maaan, I wanna read that new manga volume so badlyyy! Imamediately, if not sooner!</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Partly because I just straight up want to read it, but also because it&#39;s gonna affect what I draw for the next con!</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Now that it&#39;s finally here, I might as well ride the wave of its popularity and make my own doujin based on it!</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> But if I read it just before the con, I know I&#39;ll be so inspired to create that I&#39;ll end up wanting to make posters and bonus booklets too...</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> ...and then I&#39;ll have even more trouble meeting the deadline than usual!</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> So please! Pleeease let me read yooou!<br> (Rubbing her cheek against the box)</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Wait.

It actually opened!</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Well then, without further ado–Wait.<br> Chotto a minute. Is this–</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Wow...</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Is that what this Singularity is supposed to look like? It&#39;s beautiful...</p><p><strong>Arjuna Alter:</strong><br> I knew it.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Knew what?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Knew what?</p><p><strong>Arjuna Alter:</strong><br> This is one of the reasons I knew the dragon not to be evil.</p><p><strong>Arjuna Alter:</strong><br> I sensed that whenever Vritra builds her dams in the world, or stops something from behaving as it should...</p><p><strong>Arjuna Alter:</strong><br> ...there is something else that goes along with those deeds.</p><p><strong>Arjuna Alter:</strong><br> Though unfortunately, as a child of a god who has lost most of his humanity, I lack the words to describe it.</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong><br> To be honest, I noticed this something of what you&#39;re talking about as well, though only faintly.</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong><br> The few pictures I&#39;ve taken on this journey are proof of it.</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong><br> They are too magnificent for words, and it&#39;s nothing to do with my skill as a photographer.</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong><br> No, it&#39;s because the landscapes we&#39;ve witnessed are truly something special.</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong><br> I&#39;m not entirely sure why, but there was something about them that simply shone brighter than usual.</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong><br> So I think what this means is that, whenever Vritra traps something, it also results in something even better being created.</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong><br> That is admittedly only my personal interpretation. Still, I cannot help but feel it is the case.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Really? Is that even possible?</p><p><strong>Vritra:</strong><br> Keeheehee. It&#39;s not something I set out to do; it just happens.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Vritra...</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Her Spirit Origin has started to collapse. At this point...I think talking is all she can manage.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> There&#39;s a case to be made that, in mythology, adversity and obstacles exist to give people a chance for growth.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> After all, you can&#39;t overcome an obstacle without growing and changing.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> If you cut off access to something essential, like water, of course people aren&#39;t gonna be happy about it.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> But...the same way the energy stored up over winter goes into making plants bloom en masse in spring...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> ...it could well be that the land itself has to be sealed away to make scenery this beautiful.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Maybe the concepts Vritra really embodies are about growing through overcoming adversity...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> ...and being the kind of necessary evil to prompt further progress.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> But hey, that&#39;s just my own interpretation!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> There&#39;s a case to be made that, in mythology, adversity and obstacles exist to give people a chance for growth.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> After all, you can&#39;t overcome an obstacle without growing and changing.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> If you cut off access to something essential, like water, of course people aren&#39;t gonna be happy about it.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> But...the same way the energy stored up over winter goes into making plants bloom en masse in spring...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> ...it could well be that the land itself has to be sealed away to make scenery this beautiful.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Maybe the concepts Vritra really embodies are about growing through overcoming adversity...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> ...and being the kind of necessary evil to prompt further progress.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> But hey, that&#39;s just my own interpretation!</p><p><strong>Vritra:</strong><br> I don&#39;t know about any of that. All I know is that I enjoy seeing people try their best to accomplish something.</p><p><strong>Vritra:</strong><br> That said...</p><p><strong>Vritra:</strong><br> Since I do this sort of thing regularly, it is more entertaining if you get stronger every time.</p><p><strong>Vritra:</strong><br> That much is true.</p><p><strong>Vritra:</strong><br> Which is why I&#39;m going to keep tormenting you, and the world you live in.</p><p><strong>Vritra:</strong><br> All you have to do is show me how much stronger you&#39;ve become. You&#39;ll need to, because when I come back, I&#39;ll be even stronger too.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...So you&#39;re definitely coming back again, huh?</p><hr><p><strong>Vritra:</strong><br> Of course. I&#39;m an indestructible demon. Not even Indra could get rid of me for good.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Okay, but we&#39;re already pretty busy right now, so...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Okay, but we&#39;re kind of in the middle ofsomething pretty big right now, so...</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Master is right. The truth is, we&#39;re already stretched pretty thin, so you would really be doing us a favor if you didn&#39;t cause problems for a while.</p><p><strong>Vritra:</strong><br> Oh? So there&#39;s another formidable obstacle out there besides me? Hmm.</p><p><strong>Vritra:</strong><br> If this threat is so great that humans, gods, and the world itself are banding together to fight against it...</p><p><strong>Vritra:</strong><br> ...then it might be kind of novel to watch that struggle from the sidelines for once.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> If you&#39;re willing to help us fight it, you&#39;re more than welcome to join us.</p><hr><p><strong>Vritra:</strong><br> Keeheehee! What a strange thing to say. You do know I&#39;m a demon, yes?</p><p><strong>Vritra:</strong><br> Still, now that we&#39;ve formed this connection, maybe I will drop by. You know, if I feel like it.</p><p><strong>Vritra:</strong><br> Just make sure you don&#39;t succumb to this threat before I&#39;ve had a chance to come and watch, you powerful little weakling.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I won&#39;t.

I must say, this whole experience has only reinforced the fact that dragon hunts rarely go as expected. It was a fine experience.</p><p><strong>Arjuna Alter:</strong><br> Evil still runs rampant throughout this world...</p><p><strong>Arjuna Alter:</strong><br> ...but at least there is none to be found here.<br> That is a good thing.</p><p><strong>Scheherazade:</strong><br> Does that mean I no longer have to worry about dying?

I still have time to make my winter deadline!</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> I need to channel these impulses into something tangible before I explode! Okay, first I&#39;ll do a rough draft, then...</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong><br> Hooray, my gift opened! And it turned out to be even better than I&#39;d hoped!</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong><br> Maybe it&#39;s because I had to wait so long to open it, but it almost looks like it&#39;s sparkling!</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong><br> I&#39;m so sorry about what I said before. You&#39;re not a meanie at all.</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong><br> Thank you, Santa!</p><p><strong>Red Hare:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Red Hare:</strong><br> (Crunch, munch) Oh boy, these carrots are so good I can&#39;t put them down! Me, Lu Bu! (Munch, munch)</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> Ugh, nothing but happy faces everywhere you turn.<br> It&#39;s enough to turn my stomach.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> Don&#39;t you agree?</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> No, I don&#39;t. Besides, it has nothing to do with me.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> Is that right? Hehehe, if you say so.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> Say, while you&#39;re here, can I ask you something else?</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> ...As long as it&#39;s something I can answer.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> I can see Pārvatī figuring out Vritra&#39;s deal early on, since she&#39;s Pārvatī and all...</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> But how did you figure it out before everyone else?</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> I think you caught on about when I showed up, so I was wondering if I maybe slipped up.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> ...It&#39;s because Karna said you were your usual self.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> ?</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> He&#39;s never been one to fall for lies or treachery. Even as a human, he always had a sharp eye for the truth.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> So when he said that about you...</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> ...I was sure that you were there entirely of your own volition.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> Well, yeah. I even said as much.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> It was the perfect opportunity to piss you Indra types off, after all.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> However, you also said there were some parts of what you were doing that you didn&#39;t like.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> I did?</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> You did. So the question was, what was it you hated to do?</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> I knew it couldn&#39;t be opposing us and Master.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> You&#39;re generally far too cynical to care about that sort of thing.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> I suppose you could have simply been sarcastic about it, but that didn&#39;t seem to be the case, either.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> So I thought about what you would hate to do some more, and then I realized what the answer was:</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> Loving people.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> We all know how much you hate your job as the god of love, so if you hated part of what you were doing with Vritra, it had to mean that love was somehow involved.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> That was when I began to doubt whether Vritra&#39;s actions were truly evil.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> If you, of all people, were helping her willingly...</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> ...then your doing so must have been in some way involved love.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> ...Well, I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve heard of tough love before, right? Sometimes, the best way to love someone is to give them a challenge they can only overcome by learning and growing.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> That was a necessary evil as far as I was concerned.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> Well, I was only hypothesizing at the time. I had no actual proof.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> So I decided the best thing I could do was entrust my alter to handle it in my stead, since, as a child of the gods, he could determine good from evil from a truly impartial perspective.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> ...That&#39;s all I have to say about that. Was there anything else you wanted to know?</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> Are you sure that&#39;s all there was to it?</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> Hm?</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> Hey, I am the god of love. I&#39;m sensitive to this sort of thing. That&#39;s why I have to ask.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> Are you sure there wasn&#39;t something you were trying to give your alter by having him take over for you?</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> I mean, he&#39;s entirely forgotten about his human life, right?</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> So maybe you, for instance, wanted to jog his memory by having him spend time with your half brother, especially now that he&#39;s been acting more like his younger self?</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> That WOULD be a lovely Christmas present to give your alter, wouldn&#39;t it?</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> Whoa, watch where you&#39;re pointing that thing!<br> I&#39;m a god, remember!?</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> I sense great evil within you. If you&#39;re actually a demon that means Master harm, there is no reason not to erase you from existence here and now.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> Yeah, no, I could give you a few. Besides, the worst I get up to these days is a bit of mischief.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> I swear, this is the whole problem with humans who&#39;re too close to Shiva. They think they can just torch whatever they don&#39;t like.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> Well don&#39;t worry, I can tell when I&#39;m not wanted. Just don&#39;t shoot me in the back or anything, okay?</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> (Hmm. I&#39;m pretty sure my theory was dead-on, but I still don&#39;t know why he trusted Karna to give his other self that gift.)</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> (Unless...he actually has more faith in Karna&#39;s abilities than anyone else?)</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> ...Weirdo.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I return to my room, leaving the holiday din behind.<br> Not that it was entirely unpleasant to hear.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> If anything, I actually like this kind of peaceful, joyous atmosphere. Sometimes, I even find myself smiling.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> But, none of that changes the fact that this holiday has nothing to do with me.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I&#39;ve never celebrated Christmas before, and I&#39;m definitely not about to start now that he&#39;s Santa Claus.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Then, just as I go to lie down...<br> I notice a small note on my bedside table.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> Hm? Who left this here?<br> And when were they in my room?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> The note bears only a time slot for<br> the combat simulator.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I know right away what it means...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> ...and I know what is intended to mean to me.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Yes, that&#39;s right. Christmas or not, I would never ask for a present.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> But, even so...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> ...that doesn&#39;t mean there was nothing I wanted.</p><p></p></div><!--[--><!--]--></div><footer class="page-meta"><div class="meta-item edit-link"><a class="external-link meta-item-label" href="https://github.com/r-grandorder/tri-hermes/edit/main/src/Events/2022/christmas6.md" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" aria-label="Help us improve this page!"><!--[--><!--]--> Help us improve this page! <span><svg class="external-link-icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewbox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path><polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg><span class="external-link-icon-sr-only">open in new window</span></span><!--[--><!--]--></a></div><div class="meta-item last-updated"><span class="meta-item-label">Last Updated: </span><!----></div><div class="meta-item contributors"><span class="meta-item-label">Contributors: </span><span class="meta-item-info"><!--[--><!--[--><span class="contributor" title="email: 59034871+Fgrandorder@users.noreply.github.com">Lib</span><!----><!--]--><!--]--></span></div></footer><!----><!--[--><!--]--></main><!--]--></div><!----><!--]--></div>
