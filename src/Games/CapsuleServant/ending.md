**???:** So you finally made it this far…

**Shirou:** Yeah, this place clearly isn’t normal. Oh, it’s Rin.

**Rin:** Shirou? Why are you here?

**???:** Yeah yeah, anyway, please notice me.

**Shirou:** Hmm, do you hear a voice?

**Rin:** What is Capsule Servant anyway! All these weirdos keep coming out one after another!

**???:** I said listen to me… This is the problem with Tohsakas…

**???:** Very well. I did not expect you to make it this far.

**???:** I shall send you into meaningless confusion myself.

**???:** If you stand before me, human children, then wepent your sins.

**Shirou:** What? That baby is talking!

Rin W-what’s going on?!

**???:** Yes, thank you for the the cliche surpwised reaction.

**???:** I am the one chosen by the gwail…

**???:** “Baby Caren”

**Caren-chan:** Caren-chan for showt.

**Caren-chan:** With the grail’s power, I created a world in which every character’s worth decreases.

**Shirou:** I see, that’s why all the boss characters were so disappointing!

**Rin:** No no no, they were beyond disappointing!

**Caren-chan:** Well, they’re supposed to be cursed to have their worth decreased…

**Caren-chan:** But they were a pretty disappointing bunch to begin with, so they didn’t change much, you shee…

**Caren-chan:** Especially TO-SAKA, what even was that.

**Rin:** …Ah, yeah, sorry.

**Caren-chan:** Well, it was entertaining to watch you fighting amongst yourselves with the Capsule Servants I prepared, goo goo.

**Rin:** …Then you’re the one behind everything!

**Caren-chan:** If this wasn’t leading up to me being behind everything, it wouldn’t make any sense.

**Caren-chan:** Fear not, there won’t be any weird person in an apron or the inevitable return of the dark Blossom after this.

**Shirou:** I see. But why are you doing this, Caren-chan?

**Caren-chan:** Just to mess with you.

**Rin:** Rude?!

**Caren-chan:** Only joking. This is my benevolence towards you.

**Caren-chan:** I am approving of your struggles in the face of your ordeals.

**Caren-chan:** Yesh, I am the world-observing baby chosen by the Great Grail to gaze down on the world in amusement!!!

**Rin:** Super Rude!!

**Shirou:** I see, I don’t really get it, but let’s stop her, Rin!

**Rin:** Wait wait, you’re not hesitating at all?! Well, I’d like to say that, but your nonchalant attitude is very reassuring now!

**Caren-chan:** Foolish human children, learn the meaning of true benevolence.

**Caren-chan:** Now, t r e m b l e i n f e a r goo goo.



**Caren-chan:** Ga ga…

**Caren-chan:** H-how… couwd I be defeated…

**Shirou:** Yeah, beating up a baby feels pretty awkward!

**Rin:** What are you saying? Listen, you have to beat your enemies black and blue!

**Caren-chan:** This world is so cruel to children, it should just be destroyed… I cannot resist that cliche style of ending.

**Caren-chan:** Goo goo. (switch on)

**Shirou:** What?! This space is collapsing!

**Rin:** Ah geez, I knew something like this would happen. Anyway, let’s get out of here, Shirou!

**Shirou:** I see, got it!

**Caren-chan:** Heh… The grail is nothing more than the negative thoughts of people.

**Caren-chan:** Very well, if I fall here, your world shall return to its original shtate. Go now, human children…

**Shirou:** …

**Rin:** What are you doing, Shirou?! If you don’t hurry, the exit’s gonna close!

**Shirou:** Rin, go on ahead!

**Rin:** Huh? W-what are you saying! If you don’t hurry, it’s gonna close! That exit that looks like a wormhole, see?!

**Shirou:** Yeah, I’m gonna go after. Bye!

**Rin:** Wait, what are you doing, heyyyy! Shiroooooooooou!!!…

**Shirou:** Okay, then we’re getting out of here too, Caren-chan!

**Caren-chan:** …What are you trying to do?

**Caren-chan:** If you stay here, you will be caught in my destruction and be dragged into the spiral of worthlessness along with me.

**Shirou:** I see. Just come with me!

**Caren-chan:** B-but, with the grail destroyed, I am just a cute baby!

**Caren-chan:** There’s nothing an orphaned elementary school child like yourself can do, particularly in the social sense.

**Shirou:** That’s okay, in the worst case I’ll just have Fuji-nee adopt you!

**Caren-chan:** Ehh, is that possible? E-Emiya Shirou, why are you going so far…

**Shirou:** Let’s see———— Yeah!

**Shirou:** “—–Because I’m a hero of justice!”

**Rin:** Geez, who told Shirou he could do thaaat!

**Shirou:** …Cough cough. We made it!

**Rin:** Shirou, you’re all right! I-I wasn’t worried about you, I wasn’t!

**Shirou:** Yeah, sorry that I made you worried. Caren-chan is safe too!

**Rin:** W-what a relief… Wait, what?! Caren… chan?!

**Caren-chan:** Pleased to meet you, I am Emiya Caren. (peace)

**Rin:** Huuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuh?!!!

**Rin:** What is this?! Shirou! Why’d you bring her along?!

**Shirou:** Well, it’d be pitiful if she disappeared like that, right?

**Rin:** That’s not the problem! I mean, what’s this “Emiya Caren” about?!

**Caren-chan:** I intend to be raised as the Emiya family’s baby from now on, so please give me your regards, goo goo.

**Rin:** Don’t you goo goo me!

**Narration:** Emiya Shirou, fourth-grader, is a father of one!

**Narration:** Surrounded by society’s cruel eyes, his friends, and some bothersome girls…

**Narration:** …between childcare and school, his days are busy but fun!

**Narration:** Don’t lose, Shirou! Do your best, Caren!

**Narration:** Apparently she’s listed on the family register as Fujimura’s daughter, so there is no need to fear the government!

**Rin:** Wait wait wait, this is weird! This whole thing is weird!

**Shirou:** Okay, drink up and get big and strong!

**Fujimura:** Wait a minute, what do you mean she’s my daughter?! And is this the only place Fujimura gets to appear?!

**Rin:** Aaaah geez! What kind of ending is this?!!

**Caren-chan:** Goo goo. (peace)

**The End**

Caren: So how is that for my origin story?

**Shirou & Rin**: You wrote that whole thing?!
