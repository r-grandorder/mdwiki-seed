**Shinji:** Welcome to stage 01, also known as the tutorial!

**Rin:** I hate wakame.

**Shinji:** I’m Matou Shinji-sama, who originally was planned to be the boss character “General Shinji” but for various reasons was demoted to the tutorial punching bag!

**Rin:** I hate wakame.

**Shinji:** I was hoping they’d establish that when I was in elementary school I was purehearted and still a relatively good boy, but they didn’t! Here we go!!

**Rin:** I hate wakame.

**Sakura:** I finally found you. I’ll get revenge for Nii-san…

**Rin:** Sakura?! Don’t you recognize me?!

**Sakura:** Who might you be?

**Rin:** It’s me! Cute, smart, talented at magecraft! The heir of the Tohsaka family, and your precious big sister!

**Sakura:** Okay, please die right now.

**Rin:** What a sad fate, huh!

**Kayneth:** Kukuku… Move aside, girl. I’ll be taking all the rare Capsaba!

**Rin:** This is a game for kids, so try to read the mood!

**Kayneth:** Fool, reading is for books!

**Kayneth:** Just how much do you think I’ve invested in this? Capsaba is already my life!

**Rin:** …Are you unmarried? Or did your wife cheat on you?

**Kayneth:** Read the mood, red demon! Very well, overly talkative children require education.

**Kayneth:** Behold this Capsaba uncle’s coordination!

**Rin:** I don’t get it, but I’m taking that money!

**Ayaka:** ……… (stare)

**Rin:** You’re staring at me… Do you want to play Capsaba?

**Ayaka:** Eh? Me…? (gasp)! You’re saying I’m an easy target because I look weak and wear glasses, aren’t you?!

**Rin:** No, that’s not…

**Ayaka:** Then what is—-(gasp)?!

**Ayaka:** How terrible, you noticed my hidden heroine power and are trying to get rid of me while you still can…

**Ayaka:** You’re going to beat me at Capsaba, take me to the empty lot behind the candy store and make me fight you in a Grail War… Like Misaya-san! Like Misaya-san!

**Rin:** Okay, now I’m really pissed off for some reason!



![](https://i.imgur.com/1xhSGeD.jpeg)

**Waver:** N-no way… A kid like this is a Capsaba Master?

**Rin:** Huh? Are you a magus?

**Waver:** Y-you could tell?! T-that’s right! I’m the genius magus who’s famous at the Clock Tower, Waver Velvet!

**Rin:** Hmmm. But you don’t seem to have many magic circuits.

**Waver:** Urk?! (shock!)

**Waver:** …H-how do I put this… Kids sure are cruel.

**Rin:** Of course kids are cruel. You’ll understand when you’re older!

**Hakuno:** ……. (ta-da)

**Rin:** Ah, that’s Servant Archer!

**Hakuno:** ……. (glint)

**Rin:** And you look like you get along really well?!

**Hakuno:** ……. (smirk)

**Rin:** I don’t really understand…

**Rin:** But it looks like this is a fight I can’t afford to lose!

**Luvia:** Oooooohohoho, I am Luviagelita Edelfelt!

**Luvia:** I’m a girl genius who will one day become queen of not only the Capsaba world, but also the wrestling ring!

**Rin:** Sorry, but you’ll have to be number 2 in the world. After all, I exist.

**Rin:** Ah, I don’t care about the ring.

**Luvia:** Ouch. I did not expect to find a rival for the belt here.

**Luvia:** You there… State your name.

**Rin:** I’m Tohsaka Rin! I don’t really have a reason, but I feel like it’ll be bad if I don’t crush you here, so I’ll take you on!

**Rin:** Ah, I don’t need a belt or whatever.

**Luvia:** Uhuhuhu… Very well!

**Luvia:** Then I challenge you to an open-weight division no-time-limit single-round electrified barbed-wire deathmatch!

**Rin:** Sorry, please do it with Capsaba!

**Kirei:** Lost lamb… What business do you have at my church?

**Rin:** Oh, what are you doing, Kirei?

**Kirei:** Ah, Rin, it’s you. Hm, you wish to know what I am doing?

**Kirei:** Let’s see… You could say I’m not doing anything.

**Rin:** You’ve got too much time on your hands like always. Well then, I’m going.

**Kirei:** I’m not doing anything, but I KNOW everything.

**Kirei:** Well then, good day. Spend all your time on fighting.

**Rin:** …Hmmm. Then tell me. Well, I’ll beat it out of you anyway, though!

**Kirei:** Unlike your father, you’re decisive. You truly are Tohsaka Rin!

**Rin:** Thanks, not that I enjoy being complimented by a fake priest!

**Tokiomi:** Welcome, young Capsaba Master. Your battle ends here.

**Rin:** Oh no… How could Father be a Capsaba uncle?!

**Rin:** I can’t believe he was the same as that Baldneth guy! Gross!

**Tokiomi:** Do not compare me to the likes of a dark Capsaba uncle. I am a bright Capsaba uncle…

**Tokiomi:** I have good manners, and truly grieve for the future of the Capsaba world.

**Rin:** That’s the same thing, Father! Just grieving won’t change anything!

**Rin:** The only thing that can bring peace to the Capsaba world is the violent power of money!

**Rin:** I’m going to defeat you and keep going!

**Tokiomi:** Now, wait.

**Tokiomi:** I did say I have manners. If this can be solved through words, I will do so.

**Rin:** R-really? I guess just talking would be ok…

**Tokiomi:** However, some things cannot be solved through words!

**Tokiomi:** One cannot survive on elegance alone! The courage to slowly descend into savagery is necessary for an aristocrat, Rin!

**Rin:** How persuasive…! That was very enlightening, Father!

**Master Artoria:** Stop, child.

**Master Artoria:** I am Artoria, a Master fighting the Holy Grail War.

**Rin:** No, this isn’t the Holy Grail War, it’s Capsaba…

**Master Artoria:** Why do you mumble such incomprehensible things… You intend to have me let down my guard so you can strike, do you not?

**Master Artoria:** Argh, just like my brother Kay…!

**Rin:** I feel like you’re missing the point…

**Master Artoria:** Regardless, pity is useless in the Holy Grail War. Even if my opponent is a child, I shall show no mercy…

**Master Artoria:** I challenge you for the grail!

**Rin:** You’re not even listening, are you?!

**Narration:** Professor Tokiomi, captured by the evil Dimensional Empire MATO plotting to control all parallel worlds, was forced to perform terrible research!



**Narration:** With the aim of a cross-dimensional assault, he constructed a not-very-original type of weapon…

**Narration:** That is, a giant humanoid weapon using the Great Grail as a power source!

**ULTIMATE WEAPON S NUMBER ONE**

**Professor Tokiomi:** That being the case, listen well, Rin.

**Professor Tokiomi:** I managed to escape their base, but I can’t go on anymore.

**Professor Tokiomi:** But without their notice I was somehow able to complete the massive humanoid weapon GS-01.

**Professor Tokiomi:** Please accept my dying request and fight the Dimensional Empire MATO!

**Rin:** What are you doing, Father…

**Professor Tokiomi:** By the way, I am your father Tokiomi from another dimension, so I’d like you to remember that I am not the same person as your father from this world, strictly speaking.

**Professor Tokiomi:** Convenient, isn’t it? Right?

**Professor Tokiomi:** Hm? Does this mean I’ve inadvertently reproduced the Second Magic of the old gem man who is our family’s master?

**Rin:** That’s putting the cart before the horse.

**Professor Tokiomi:** Regardless, the only one left for me to turn to is you, my daughter Rin!

**General Shinji:** Found you, Professor Tokiomi! The price for betrayal is death, now diiiiie! General Shinji Beam!

**Professor Tokiomi:** Ngh! Look out, Rin!

**Rin:** Eh?! But I’m not the one being aimed at?!

**Professor Tokiomi:** Bwaaaaaaahhhhh?!!!!

**Professor Tokiomi:** …A-are you all right, Rin?

**Rin:** Father?!

**Professor Tokiomi:** This is the end for me. Please, join forces with your sister GS-01 and protect the world your father loved…

**Rin:** Don’t push the fate of the world on me! What’s GS-01, anyway? Huh? Sister?



![](https://i.imgur.com/Xi8v6G4.jpeg)

**General Shinji:** Wha?! You were already complete, GS-01, AKA Gigantic Sakura!

**General Shinji:** Wait, uwa?!

**Narration:** (squish)

**Rin & Professor Tokiomi:** Ah.

**G-Sakura:** …So, what is this? Why did I wake up in the morning looking like this?!

**Rin:** C-could you be Sakura? Y-you sure have grown since I last saw you…

**Rin:** I mean… Um… You know?

**G-Sakura:** Oh? You look just like Nee-san when she was little…

**G-Sakura:** …I see, so that means I was given the short end of the stick again, was I?

**G-Sakura:** E x – F a t h e r ?

**Professor Tokiomi:** No… I’m already dead, so direct your complaints to Rin…

**Professor Tokiomi:** I mean, …your father is dead! Dead indeed!

**Professor Tokiomi:** Anyway, just talk to Rin, and take the world for yourselves as loving sisters…!

**G-Sakura:** ………

**Rin:** ………

**Professor Tokiomi:** ………Rin.

**Rin:** What?

**Professor Tokiomi:** I’m leaving it all to you!!!



**Rin:** All right, I won! But even though you’re huge now, you fight with Servants, huh?

**G-Sakura:** Waaaaah! It’s an issue with the game’s system, so I had no choooooice!

**G-Sakura:** And how come even though Nee-san is a protagonist with a new design, I’m treated like this again?!

**G-Sakura:** Weeeeeeehhhhhhhh!

**Professor Tokiomi:** …Fear not, SAKURA.

**Professor Tokiomi:** You, Gigantic SAKURA, also known as GS-01, are also a new design.

**G-Sakura:** That’s not the problem!

**Professor Tokiomi:** Mph! My Tohsaka Elegant Radar is detecting enemies!

**Cosmic General Shinji:** Huhahahahahaha! Stop right there, traitors!

**Cosmic General Shinji:** I’ve arrived to rationally take advantage of your fatigue after fighting amongst yourselves!

**Cosmic General Shinji:** You’ve fallen right into the trap of Cosmic General Shinji, remodelled to have an evolved IQ of 5800!

**Cosmic General Shinji:** Now, combatant Clone Shinjis, get them!



![](https://i.imgur.com/Zp7oq9z.jpeg)

**Clone Shinjis:** Wakameee! Wakameee! Wakameee!

**Rin:** Ahhh geez, this is just one pain after another! SAKURA, let’s beat them up for now! We’ll talk later!

**G-Sakura:** O-oh well… Let’s go, little Nee-san from another world!

**Professor Tokiomi:** Yes, go! GS-01 and my daughter!

**Rin & G-Sakura:** Shut up!

**Narration:** The near future!

**Narration:** Rin, who went overboard and took over the Dimensional Empire MATO, embarked on a quest for world domination as the dimensional empress Kaiser Rin!

**Narration:** No one can stand in the way of the completed GS Series anymore!

**Narration:** “The world seems to want to be dominated?”

**Kaiser Rin:** The nautical GS-02, Black SAKURA!

**GS-02:** Yep, it’s me, the usual Dark Sakura.

**Kaiser Rin:** The aerial GS-03, BB SAKURA!

**GS-03:** Is the sequel coming out yet?

**Kaiser Rin:** And on land, GS-01, Gigantic SAKURA!

**Kaiser Rin:** Go! We’re going to conquer the world!

**Kaiser Rin:** Hey, this is pretty fun!

**G-Sakura:** Why did it turn out like this?!

**The End**



![](https://i.imgur.com/GcEIwf7.jpeg)

**Rin:** Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeek?!

**Celebloomers:** Haaaa ha ha! Weak! Too weak!

**Celebloomers:** How absurd that you would challenge the Capsule Servant world champion, Illy… I mean…

**Celebloomers:** The mysterious champ Celebloomers-sama, with such little skill!

**Rin:** …H-how… could I lose…

**Celebloomers:** Huhuuu, then just as promised, I’ll be talking all of your Servants!

**Celebloomers:** Thank you for your patronage! The exit is right over there!

**Rin:** Waaaaaaaaaah!



**My Strongest Partner**



**Rin:** What should I do… All my Servants were taken away…

**???:** Cheer up.

**Rin:** My allowance is all gone, so I can’t use the machine to get any mo… Eh? What?

**???:** …Right here, in your pocket.

**Rin:** Eh? My pocket…? Ah! I had one left!

**Archer:** Hmph, you finally noticed. I am the Capsule Servant EMI… I mean, Archer.

**Rin:** Wait, this Servant taaaaaalks???!!!

**Archer:** Naturally. I’m a lucky one, you see.

**Rin:** Eeeeeeeeh?! Lucky Servants talk?!

**Archer:** Yes. Keep it a secret.

**Rin:** …L-lucky Servants are amazing!!!

**Archer:** You seem depressed that you lost, but you still have me. It’s too early to give up.

**Rin:** …But I can’t make a deck with just you, and I already used up all my allowance…

**Archer:** What, I am a lucky one after all. Leave it to me…!

**Archer:** Reality Marble: Unlimited Blade Works!



![](https://i.imgur.com/skp5ViR.jpeg)



---



**Rin:** W-what is this?! My surroundings turned into an infertile land with nothing but gears and swords in it?!

**Archer:** Infertile…?

**Archer:** Oh well, anyway, I can make Servants using projection magecraft.

**Rin:** Projection magecraft is magecraft to make fake things, right… So you’re saying you’ll make phony Capsaba!

**Archer:** …I-indeed. It sounds bad when you put it that way, but it doesn’t cost anything, so well, that’s right.

**Archer:** Ah, incidentally, I can only project Servants that I’ve seen before.

**Rin:** Wow!

**Rin:** Then I’ll have you project the Servants I already got…

**Rin:** Ah! And I’ll have you project those display models in the window of that toy shop…

**Rin:** Hmm! You could do the Servants that only show up in the anime, too…

**Rin:** What are you doing, Archer, we gotta project everything we can get our hands on!

**Archer:** Indeed, that lack of hesitation doesn’t bode well at all!



![](https://i.imgur.com/4t2XAiH.jpeg)

**Rin:** Sorry to keep you waiting, Celebloomers!

**Rin:** Look! Gaze upon my infinitely huge Tohsaka Celebrity Deck made by projecting Servants!

**Celebloomers:** That’s just illegal activity, right?!



**Celebloomers:** H-how could I lose…

**Celebloomers:** I mean, summoning infinite Servants is too much, nobody follows the rules at the end of the century, it’s already the 21st century though… (slump)

**Rin:** Yep! Quantity really is what matters in battle! Good job, Archer!

**Archer:** Be that as it may, we’re definitely the villains here, Rin.

**Rin:** Being able to get infinite Servants is like a dream come true, huh!

**Rin:** Hm? Wait… Could this mean…!

**Archer:** What is it?

**Rin:** Heeeey, Archer…? I have a request. (smile)

**Archer:** (Ah, I don’t like where this is going.)



![](https://i.imgur.com/FjFXKJY.jpeg)

**Shinji:** Woooooooaaaaaah?!

**Shinji:** Isn’t this the super limited-edition Servant drawn specially by Takeuchi Takashi, Galactica Saber?!

**Shinji:** Can I really have this for 200 yen, Tohsaka?

**Rin:** It’s nooooooo problem at all! If you like, shall I offer you a set of 10?

**Shinji:** Just as I’d expect from Tohsaka-sama, phew!

**Rin:** Okay, this one is 50 yen, and that rare Servant is 150 yen!

**Rin:** All right! If I keep this up, I’ll be rich in no time… Eheheheheh… I can’t stop laughing!

**Bazett:** Stop right there, illegal Capsaba user!

**Rin:** Eh?! What?! Wait, what are you wearing lmao oh my god i can’t even lmao

**Bazett:** B-be quiet! Employees can’t go against the clients’ wishes!

**Bazett:** Wait, more importantly, you there, elementary schooler! You’re under arrest for the charge of illegal Servant counterfeiting!

**Rin:** Eh? I-illegal… This is projection magecraft, so… Huh? Is that illegal?

**Bazett:** There’s no need to ask questions! I came here under request from the Association to invesigate the rise in sales in this area…

**Bazett:** But to think you were so blatantly counterfeiting Capsaba out in the open…!

**Bazett:** I’m very shocked at the East’s decline in morals!

**Bazett:** No, I’m more shocked at your outfit…

**Rin:** No, that’s not it, this is projection, not counterfeit…

**Bazett:** Quiet!

**Bazett:** You have the right to remain silent, the right to an attorney, and the responsibiility to hide your magecraft!

**Bazett:** Anyway, I’ll hear your explanation down at the station, so give up and let me arrest you!

**Archer:** Let’s get out of here, Rin.

**Rin:** Eh?! Ah, wait, my profits…?!

**Archer:** There’s no time!

**Archer:** You there, Enforcer, I’m sorry but please return that money to its original owners.

**Rin:** Ehhhhhh?! Noooooo!

**Rin:** My moneeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeey?!

**The End**

**Lonely Holy Grail War**



**Rin:** Ah, I got a Lancer.

**Rin:** Hmm, what should I do, should I try for another one…?

**???:** Hey! You there, kid! H-help me!

**Rin:** Huh? What’s this voice? Where’s it coming from…

**???:** Right here! Down here! By your feet!

**Rin:** My feet… Eh? A Servant?!



![](https://i.imgur.com/IuJFWbd.jpeg)

**Avenger:** You finally noticed.

**Avenger:** I’m Servant Angra… I mean, Avenger.

**Rin:** Hmmm… Wait, a talking Servant?!

**Avenger:** Of course, that’s cause I’m a lucky one.

**Avenger:** Anyway, help me, Miss!

**Rin:** What do you mean, help…



![](https://i.imgur.com/eq43ycj.jpeg)

**???:** Found you, Avenger! Be good and return to my capsule!

**Rin:** Eh? Who are you, lady?

**Bazett:** I am Bazett Fraga McRemitz, an Enforcer sent by the Association.

**Rin:** Hmmm. But why are you chasing that Servant?

**Bazett:** T-that’s because, um, that Servant is my only frie–

**Bazett:** I mean…

**Bazett:** A-actually, that lucky talking Servant is an illegal Servant designated to be sealed.

**Bazett:** The Association dispatched me to recover that Servant!

**Avenger:** Liar!

**Avenger:** Just because I can talk, that Master makes me go shopping, and clean, and take her phone calls, she’s terrible!

**Avenger:** Capsaba aren’t that kind of servant!

**Bazett:** H-how rude! I feed you, so this is just give-and-take!

**Avenger:** All you feed me is beef bowl, you iron maiden!

**Avenger:** Having beef bowl for breakfast, lunch and dinner is the height of insanity!

**Bazett:** I-it doesn’t matter what you eat as long as it has calories!

**Bazett:** I give you extra ginger sometimes, right?!

**Avenger:** And at night, that Master starts grumbling to me, it’s kinda scary!

**Bazett:** I-I don’t grumble!

**Bazett:** Don’t make it sound like I’m a lonely woman whose only friend is a Capsaba!

**Bazett:** I mean, I-I have lots of friends… Um, uh…

**Bazett:** Ah! Here, look at this, the contact list on my phone is full of numbers!

**Avenger:** What’s she talking about? Those are all business contacts.

**Bazett:** …

**Rin:** …

**Avenger:** …

**Bazett:** This means war!!!!!

**Rin:** But this has nothing to do with me!



**Bazett:** I… I lost… Then I really will have to spend the Holy Grail War alone.

**Bazett:** Ahh, it’s true, I don’t have a single friend!

**Bazett:** My Capsaba is my only friend! I’m really sorry for existing!

**Rin:** Hmm, I think I did something bad. Avenger, why not go back?

**Avenger:** It does seem like we bullied her a bit too hard, so it leaves a bad aftertaste…

**Bazett:** That’s right, come back! No, please come back!

**Bazett:** Aren’t we friends, Avenger?!

**Rin:** But why do you want Avenger so bad?

**Bazett:** Well, um… I honestly would rather use Lancer or something like that.

**Bazett:** But I keep getting doubles of Avenger no matter what I do.

**Rin:** I see.

**Rin:** Then shall I give you this Lancer I just got?

**Bazett:** Eh?!

**Avenger:** Eh?!



![](https://i.imgur.com/2oq9Euj.jpeg)

**Lancer:** Eh?!

**Rin:** Wah?! My Lancer talked too?!

**Lancer:** Actually, I’m a lucky one too.

**Lancer:** Wait, hey missy, you can’t trade me away when you just got me!

**Lancer:** I think we’re compatible, really! Like a dream team, don’t you think?!



![](https://i.imgur.com/FUs2dnw.jpeg)



---



**Bazett:** It’s really okay?! Y-yaaaaay! I did it, I got the Lancer I always dreamed of!

**Lancer:** W-wait, missy! Aren’t you going to think about this?!

**Lancer:** Look, I’m a lucky one so I can use a castle Noble Phantasm and stuff, a castle!

**Avenger:** T-that’s right, let’s think about this!

**Avenger:** I ran away and fought with you and stuff, but we really are a good combination!

**Avenger:** …Wasn’t that the heartwarming direction this story was supposed to go in, Master?!

**Bazett:** Ah, I’ll trade Avenger to you.

**Bazett:** That one’s rude but super weak, so be careful when using it.

**Bazett:** Man, I really wanted a Lancer deck!

**Rin:** I had doubles of Lancer, so it’s OK. All right, trade complete!

**Lancer & Avenger:** EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH????????!!!!!!!!

**The End**

**See The World By Jeanne**



**Jeanne:** About 780-and-a-half hours from France, my train arrived in Fuyuki, Japan.

**Jeanne:** Many Servants were summoned, fought, and died here.

**Jeanne:** Looking at the town, you can see many traces of the Holy Grail War.

**Jeanne:** On the right, the remains of a building that suddenly exploded in the middle of the night.

**Jeanne:** On the left, a park that was spontaneously engulfed in a sea of flames.

**Jeanne:** Finally, a riverbed where giant monsters appeared like something out of a special-effects show.

**Jeanne:** Even I, Ruler, don’t know why the Association’s management didn’t cover all this up.



![](https://i.imgur.com/xQAAGcI.jpeg)



---



**Jeanne:** So I, the maiden of Orleans, Jeanne d’Arc…

**Jeanne:** …am using the Heroic Spirit vacation time that I recieve for completing my work as Ruler to come here to Fuyuki on holiday.

**Rin:** ?

**Jeanne:** Of course, as France’s biggest celebrity, I haven’t forgotten to disguise myself to hide my identity.

**Jeanne:** It wouldn’t do to see “Shocker! Saint Descends In Far-East Land!” as the headline on tomorrow’s morning newspaper, after all.

**Jeanne:** Despite appearances, I’m the worldwide super-famous Heroic Spirit Jeanne d’Arc, you know?

**Jeanne:** It’s so haaard. It’s so haaard to hide my identity even when I’m on vacation.

**Jeanne:** It’s so haaard to have to hide my name for a different reason than Servants.

**Rin:** ?

**Jeanne:** Oh, this girl… (gasp)?! Could she be…

**Jeanne:** …a modern saint who was affected by my holy aura, couldn’t contain herself, and rushed to serve under the Lord’s banner?!

**Rin:** ?

**Jeanne:** Oh well, there’s not much I can do about it, I am a worldwide super famous Heroic Spirit after all.

**Jeanne:** Anyone who saw the maiden of Orleans praying by the side of the road would be so deeply moved by such a sacred sight…

**Jeanne:** …and dedicate their life to such prayer and unconditional love, right?

**Rin:** Ah, I know you, you’re Jeanne… Jeanne d’Arc!

**Jeanne:** That’s right! So you do know!

**Jeanne:** Yes! I am the shining symbol of France’s history, Jeanne d’Arc!

**Jeanne:** Ahh, I thought I might not be that well-known in the East, but my fears were unfounded!

**Rin:** If I remember right, you rode on a horse and said…

**Rin:** “There is no such word as impossible in my dictionary!”

**Rin:** Right?!

**Jeanne:** Napoleon again?!

**Jeanne:** I mean, sure, that guy’s still really popular in Paris!



**Jeanne:** What is this…

**Jeanne:** Seriously, mixing me up with that little man is on a whole other level past mixing me up with King Arthur…

**Rin:** Oh, I thought a Heroic Spirit with a dictionary that made everything possible sounded cool.

**Jeanne:** Well, okay, I’ll admit that the little man is famous.

**Jeanne:** But when it comes to famous French people, I’ve got much more seniority!

**Rin:** Hmmm, but I still don’t really get it. Are you in any anime?

**Jeanne:** Hmmm, I showed up in an anime a little, but I wasn’t the main character…

**Jeanne:** Ah! Then here, read this! Fate/Apocrypha!

**Jeanne:** It’s a popular series featuring Jeanne-san! It’s a little long, but it’s so good you’ll lose track of time!

**Rin:** Hmm, so this existed. Then I’ll give it a read.



**Rin:** Whew… I’m done reading.

**Jeanne:** H-how did you like it?

**Rin:** Yeah! It was good!

**Jeanne:** It is, isn’t it! After all, the series features the super famous Heroic Spirit Jeanne-san!

**Rin:** Especially the parts with Astolfo!

**Jeanne:** Damn you, pink hair!



**Narration:** ~7 years later~

**Jeanne:** …Whew, I’ve never been summoned so violently before.

**Jeanne:** Ah, it’s been awhile, Rin!

**Rin:** …Huh?!

**Jeanne:** I had to participate in the Holy Grail War after all!

**Jeanne:** I wanted to compete for the grail sometime too.

**Jeanne:** Eh? You don’t want a Ruler or anything? Don’t worry.

**Jeanne:** I mean, I have a sword too, and I can add +10 ability even if it’s just a butter knife, so I can probably be Saber, right?

**Jeanne:** Yes, why hide it? I’ve been mistaken for a Saber before!

**Rin:** …So?

**Jeanne:** It might finally be coming! The Jeaaaaaaaaanne boom!

**Jeanne:** Of course there’ll be a stage adaptation, but let’s not forget my movie, and my anime, and my schools, and my currency, and my laws!

**Jeanne:** The first law will be…

**Jeanne:** “All pink haired girls (and people who look like girls) will have their hair cut off immediately.”

**Jeanne:** So, I look forward to working with you!

**Rin:** Th…

**Jeanne:** It’s all right, Rin. I’ll work hard from now on! (smile)

**Rin:** This isn’t that kind of story!

**The End**

**TO-SAKA:** Welcome, child who doesn’t feel like a stranger at all!

**TO-SAKA:** I am an envoy from the parallel universe where Heroic Spirit EMIYA was not created…

**TO-SAKA:** The ultimate, final possibility for Tohsaka Rin…

**TO-SAKA:** Heroic Spirit TO-SAKA!

**Rin:** ………

**TO-SAKA:** Yes, I’m the wandering witch, journeying through the dimensions to destroy every grail…

**TO-SAKA:** Magical Witch TO-SAKA! Wow, sexy!

**Rin:** ………

**TO-SAKA:** …On that day, stricken with grief, I was forced to make a most terrible decision.

**TO-SAKA:** …Yes, I formed a contract with the world.

**Rin:** ………

**TO-SAKA:** …Yes, I had to make the contract.

**TO-SAKA:** …To repay my excessively huge loan!

**Rin:** ………

**TO-SAKA:** Anyway, the world said…

**TO-SAKA:** “Hmmm, they’re having too many Grail Wars over there, we don’t lend out Heroic Sprits for free, you know…”

**TO-SAKA:** “So since you’re new, TO-SAKA-san, we thought we’d have you destroy the grails in a few worlds so there’ll be fewer Grail Wars…”

**TO-SAKA:** “Yep, for each grail you destroy that’s 3% of your loan paid off, so thanks in advance!”

**TO-SAKA:** So I’m busy destroying grails every day!

**Rin:** ………I understand.

**Rin:** Before anyone sees…

**TO-SAKA:** So I’ll be destroying this world’s grail too!

**TO-SAKA:** The after-effects may blow this town off the map, but that’s inevitable, so give up!

**TO-SAKA:** BELIEVE MY JUSTICE! ARRIVE MY DREAM!

**TO-SAKA:** Hoooo!

**Rin:** “——–I have to make it like this never existed!”



**TO-SAKA:** Huhu… just as I’d expect from myself at that age.

**TO-SAKA:** …Yes, back then, I thought I could do anything.

**TO-SAKA:** …Where did I go wrong?

**Rin:** Yeah yeah, I don’t care, just take your possibility and disappear! Before anyone shows up!

**TO-SAKA:** This… this…

**TO-SAKA:** “IOU (Self Geass Scroll)”

**TO-SAKA:** …If if it wasn’t for this…

**Rin:** How much did you borrow, anyway? Let me see.

**Rin:** Woah, that’s a lot… Even I’m disgusted!

**Rin:** Anyway, annual interest 14.7%… Umm, and you destroyed this many grails already…

**TO-SAKA:** Aaaargh, I don’t even care anymore, so maybe I’ll just go bankrupt.

**TO-SAKA:** But then I won’t be able to take out cards and stuff.

**Rin:** —Hmm? Hey, wait a minute.

**Rin:** This is already paid off.

**TO-SAKA:** Mail order is a real pain without a card…

**TO-SAKA:** Eh?!

**Rin:** See, the interest rate is 14.7% per year, and you destroyed this many grails…

**Rin:** I mean, you paid too much interest, so this is what they call overpayment, right? I saw it on TV the other day.

**TO-SAKA:** Ahh, now that you mention it, I was having so much fun destroying the grails that I haven’t looked at my statement lately.

**Rin:** Putting the cart before the horse like that means you really are me, huh…

**Rin:** Hmm, by my calculations, you’re gonna get a lot of money back.

**TO-SAKA:** What?! Guess I was a genius even when I was younger, to notice something like that!

TO-SAKA! Hooraaaaay! I’m free! In that case, time to celebrate!

**TO-SAKA:** I’ll treat you too, little me, so come along!

**TO-SAKA:** Beer, fried chicken, miso nabe, horse sashimi, woohoo! Time to party!

**TO-SAKA:** Who said girls can’t like raw meat?!

**Rin:** Ah, then there’s some stuff I want, so take me shopping too!

**TO-SAKA:** Leave it to big sis!

**World (George):** …So, you got carried away and spent too much and took out another loan.

**TO-SAKA:** …I’m so ashamed.

**Rin:** Why did it turn out like this?

**World:** …Well, TO-SAKA-san, it’ll be okay as long as you work hard. You paid off the last one, right?

**World:** …Then, annual interest 16.3%, and 2.5% of the loan paid off for each grail destroyed.

**TO-SAKA:** Eh? …Isn’t the interest up from last time… No, it’s nothing. Please…

**Rin:** Why did it turn out like this?

**World:** …And, you there, you’ll be contracting as Elementary School Heroic Spirit RIN-san.

**World:** Same conditions as TO-SAKA-san?

**TO-SAKA:** “——Huhu, can you keep up with me?” Wow!

**Rin:** Why did it turn out like this!!!!!!

**The End**
