**Shinji:** Welcome to stage 01, also known as the tutorial!

**Shirou:** I see. That’s nice of you!

**Shinji:** I’m Matou Shinji-sama, who originally was planned to be the boss character “General Shinji” but for various reasons was demoted to the tutorial punching bag!

**Shirou:** I see. What a pity!

**Shinji:** I was hoping they’d establish that when I was in elementary school I was purehearted and still a relatively good boy, but they didn’t! Here we go!!

**Shirou:** I see. Sorry, I guess!

**Sakura:** I finally found you. I’ll get revenge for Nii-san…

**Shirou:** Okay. Who’s he?

**Sakura:** Um, you see… He’s got a lot of pride but gives off this really strong feeling of unimportance… His hair is gross like wakame…

**Shirou:** Ah, you mean Shinji from the tutorial!

**Sakura:** …….(What a wonderful person…) Okay, I got it. If I lose, I’ll become your bride, okay.

**Shirou:** I see, Shinji must have it tough!

**Kayneth:** Kukuku… Move aside, commoner boy. I’ll be taking all the rare Capsaba!

**Shirou:** I see, you must be really childish to cut in line!

**Kayneth:** Hmph. When it comes to survival there are no adults or children or young ladies!

**Kayneth:** Just how much do you think I’ve invested in this? Capsaba is already my life!

**Shirou:** Yep, then your life will be over when you run out of money!

**Kayneth:** T-that’s quite wise… Then I must recognize you as a formidable opponent.

**Kayneth:** Behold this Capsaba Meister’s artfully constructed deck!

**Shirou:** I see, so you’re the type who doesn’t learn until he gets hurt!

**Ayaka:** ……… (stare)

**Shirou:** Okay, are you my next opponent, lady?

**Ayaka:** Mph! What? You’re saying I’m an easy target because I look weak and wear glasses, aren’t you?!

**Shirou:** No, then should we stop?

**Ayaka:** You mean you’re ignoring me?! So you don’t like glasses, do you!

**Ayaka:** I’m right, aren’t I?! What’s wrong with glasses?!

**Shirou:** Yeah, you’re the bothersome type!



![](https://i.imgur.com/k8TTr64.jpg)

**Waver:** No way… A kid like this is a Capsaba Master?

**Shirou:** Yeah, that’s right!

**Waver:** We met by chance… then this is destiny…! In that case, I can’t run away! Isn’t that right, Rider!

**Shirou:** I see, then there’s no choice but to fight!

**Waver:** No, wait. I need to emotionally prepare… U-ummmm… R-Rider!

**Waver:** Let’s win no matter what…

**Waver:** Let’s take the grail!

**Waver:** Let’s take the world too!

**Waver:** Failure is not an option…!

**Waver:** All right, I’m gonna do it!

**Shirou:** Live more carefreely, mister!

**Hakuno:** ……. (doooon)

**Shirou:** …This lady…

**Hakuno:** …….

**Shirou:** …….

**Hakuno:** ……. (smirk)

**Shirou:** …She’s pretty good!

**Luvia:** Oooooohohoho, I am Luviagelita Edelfelt!

**Luvia:** I’m a girl genius who will one day become queen of not only the Capsaba world, but also the wrestling ring!

**Shirou:** I see. You should start small!

**Luvia:** Hmph, what accurate advice for a first meeting… State your name.

**Luvia:** You seem to show promise, so I may consider hiring you as an apprentice butler.

**Shirou:** I see. I already know what I want to be, so no thanks!

**Luvia:** My, you have a good sense of purpose as well! Excellent!

**Luvia:** I’ll present you the special opportunity to become my manager! Only if you win against me, that is!

**Shirou:** I see. I won’t be your manager, but I’ll give it a shot!



![](https://i.imgur.com/xHbLFrd.jpg)

**Kirei:** Lost lamb… What business do you have at my church?

**Shirou:** I see, you’re hiding something, huh mister!

**Kirei:** Hmm, it seems you are quite perceptive in this world.

**Kirei:** A result of Emiya Kiritsugu’s training, perhaps?

**Shirou:** Hm? You know Dad?

**Kirei:** Yes… But that is not important. If I’m “hiding” something, what do you plan to do?

**Kirei:** Emiya… Shirou-kun?

**Shirou:** Yeah, I’m gonna beat you up!



![](https://i.imgur.com/Z8lflXT.jpg)



---



**Tokiomi:** I am Fuyuki’s Second Owner, the Capsaba uncle, Tohsaka Tokiomi.

**Tokiomi:** An elegant dandy who is retrieving the Capsule Servants, which are too powerful for children to have.

**Tokiomi:** I think you can understand what this means. Well?

**Shirou:** I don’t understand at all! Huh? Tohsaka? Are you with Rin?!

**Tokiomi:** Oh, are you Rin’s friend? In that case, please get along with her.

**Tokiomi:** You wouldn’t think it to look at her, but can be careless. I fear she may fall in love with some boy of doubtful origin someday.

**Tokiomi:** Oh, hahaha, how rude of me. It seems I’m being too much of a doting parent!

**Shirou:** I see, Rin must have it tough!

**Tokiomi:** In any case, your reckless fighting ends here.

**Tokiomi:** If I win, I will have you hand over your Serv…

**Shirou:** What’s wrong?

**Tokiomi:** Nice joke. It seems I’ve left my Capsaba at home. Would you mind waiting a minute?

**Shirou:** I see, like father like daughter!

**Master Artoria:** Are you to be my next opponent, then?

**Master Artoria:** I am Artoria, a Master fighting the Holy Grail War.

**Shirou:** I see. You’re manly!

**Master Artoria:** Wha–?! …I did not choose this style of speech!

**Master Artoria:** It is because of the men of my family that I became this way!

**Shirou:** I see. What a pity!

**Master Artoria:** What a disgrace to be pitied by a child…

**Master Artoria:** Regardless, if you wish to pass through here, you must first defeat me!

**Shirou:** Okay, here we go!



**Narration:** Professor Tokiomi, captured by the evil Dimensional Empire MATO plotting to control all parallel worlds, was forced to perform terrible research!

**Narration:** With the aim of a cross-dimensional assault, he constructed a not-very-original type of weapon…

**Narration:** That is, a giant humanoid weapon using the Great Grail as a power source!



![](https://i.imgur.com/zLGMkKu.jpg)



**ULTIMATE WEAPON S NUMBER ONE**



![](https://i.imgur.com/T472CZM.jpg)

**Professor Tokiomi:** That being the case, listen well, Shirou-kun.

**Professor Tokiomi:** I managed to escape their base, but I can’t go on anymore.

**Professor Tokiomi:** But without their notice I was somehow able to complete the massive humanoid weapon SAKURA.

**Professor Tokiomi:** Please accept my dying request and fight the Dimensional Empire MATO!

**Shirou:** What are you doing, Rin’s dad?

**Professor Tokiomi:** Indeed, I honestly wanted my daughter Rin to fight, but she refused me point-blank a minute ago, you see…

**Professor Tokiomi:** This must be what they call the rebellious age… Lately she’s been saying harsh things like how my beard looks like it belong on Paris Fashion Week or how I stink of musk…

**Shirou:** I see, being too much of a dandy can be a problem too!

**Professor Tokiomi:** Anyway, the only one left for me to turn to is you, who just happened to show up!

**Professor Tokiomi:** Will you accept? If you like, I don’t mind offering you Rin’s hand in marriage!

**Shirou:** I see, you should treat your kids with more care!



![](https://i.imgur.com/7bHfTs1.jpg)



---



**General Shinji:** Found you, Professor Tokiomi, you traitor! Now, will you come quietly?!

**Professor Tokiomi:** Damn you, General Shinji, one of the top brass of the MATO empire! I won’t let you people do as you like!

**Professor Tokiomi:** Now, Shirou-kun! Activate SAKURA immediately!

**Shirou:** I got it, but how do I pilot this?

**Professor Tokiomi:** Fear not! The truth is, Capsule Servants…

**Professor Tokiomi:** …were spread throughout the world by me as practice tools to find someone qualified to pilot SAKURA.

**Professor Tokiomi:** If you’ve already made it this far, then you should be able to control SAKURA just as you control the Capsule Servants…!

**Shirou:** I see, now that you mention it, this story was about Capsule Servants!



![](https://i.imgur.com/kihjN2o.jpg)



---



**Shinji:** Wha–?! You were already complete, SAKURA?! Wait, uwa?!

**Shinji:** (squish)

Shirou & **Professor Tokiomi:** Ah.

**G-SAKURA:** …So, what is this? Why did I wake up in the morning looking like this?!

**Professor Tokiomi:** Well, er, I was being menaced by MATO and had no choice, you see…

**G-SAKURA:** …Is that so. …Then, isn’t there anything else you’ve forgotten to say?

**G-SAKURA:** E x – F a t h e r ?

**Professor Tokiomi:** ……….

**G-SAKURA:** ……….

**Professor Tokiomi:** Shirou-kun…

**Shirou:** What?

**Professor Tokiomi:** Help me!



**Shirou:** Okay, I won, but sorry, I guess!

**G-SAKURA:** Waaaah! This is a terrible thing to do to your own daughteeer!

**G-SAKURA:** With my body like this I can never become a briiiide! (glance)

**G-SAKURA:** Isn’t there anyone who will take meeee?! (glance)

**Shirou:** Okay, she’s glancing at me for some reason, but what do I do?

**Professor Tokiomi:** …So that was it. The requirement to pilot SAKURA was mutual trust…

**Professor Tokiomi:** Yes… the power of your bond, Shirou-kun.

**Shirou:** Yeah, if her dad’s like this, I guess I feel kind of sorry for SAKURA!

**Professor Tokiomi:** Mph! My Tohsaka Elegant Radar is detecting enemies!

**Commander-in-chief Euryale:** Huhuhu, don’t get carried away just because you defeated General Shinji!

**Commander-in-chief Euryale:** He was just an extra who wasn’t particularly one of us!

**High Priestess Stheno:** We, the Gorgon Sisters, will put an end to you personally!

**Commander-in-chief Euryale:** Go! Originally big but now even more giant, anti-SAKURA giant humanoid weapon MEDO-SA!



![](https://i.imgur.com/4sWM0Wk.jpg)



---



**Medo-sa:** …Ah, yes, hi there, I’m the giant humanoid weapon… was that it? …Medo-sa.

**G-SAKURA:** …We both have trouble with family, don’t we, Rider.



![](https://i.imgur.com/gD4ZsYU.jpg)



---



**Narration:** In the near future, mankind’s battle against the MATO empire plotting to rule the dimension begins!

**Narration:** In the midst of that battle is the boy who controls the world’s strongest humanoid weapon, SAKURA!

**Narration:** His name is Emiya Shirou!

**Shirou:** Destroy, Gigantic SAKURA!

**G-SAKURA:** Eh?! I’m still like this?!

**The End**

**Sella:** Milady, we’ve arrived.

**???:** …Huhu. Yes, then it’s time to teach these Eastern bumpkins the true meaning of a Capsule Servant battle…

**???:** Or Capsabattle for short.

**Liz:** Illya, when you get off a plane, you have to wear a happi, a happi.

**Celebloomers:** I’m nooooooooot Illya! Didn’t we decide that my magnificent codename was the mysterious Capsaba champion Celebloomers?!

**Celebloomers:** No, more importantly, what’s a happi? Sounds kinda fun? Liz, aren’t you a bit too knowledgeable about Japan?

**Sella:** Milady, the preparations have been made for your press conference, so come this way.

**Celebloomers:** …Oh, right, right, let’s do it like this.

**Celebloomers:** Ehhh, ahem.

**Celebloomers:** Ohhh, it’s so haaard being the champion, you have to do press conferences day in and day out with no rest.



The Beautiful, Dignified, Noble and All-Around Amazing Challenger



**Celebloomers:** There’s nobody here?!

**Sella:** T-this wasn’t supposed to…

**Sella:** Leysritt, you did correctly inform the Japanese government about Milady’s arival, didn’t you?!

**Liz:** Mm-hmm, I phoned before we left. They said something like “we ain’t no soba restaurant!” though.

**Liz:** Close enough.

**Celebloomers:** Right, so you didn’t inform them at all!

**Shirou:** What are you doing?

**Celebloomers:** Hm? What’s with this kid?

**Celebloomers:** (gasp)?!

**Celebloomers:** Could he be a Japanese fan who heard that I, the current Capsaba Champion, had arrived and forced his way in?!

**Celebloomers:** Ehhh, this suuure is a problem, I need to run this kind of thing through my manager!

**Shirou:** Huh, is that so?

**Liz:** Illya, it looks like this boy doesn’t know anything.

**Celebloomers:** Wh…at…?!

**Shinji:** Waaaaaaaaaaaait a minuuuuuuuuuuute!!!

**Shirou:** Shinji?!



![](https://i.imgur.com/wlI3zT3.jpg)

**Shinji:** M-might you be… the reigning champion of the Capsule Servant Battle – or Capsabattle for short – world championships, the mysterious, beautiful Capser…

**Shinji:** Celebloomers-san?!

**Celebloomers:** Eh?!

**Celebloomers:** Ah, right, that’s right! I’m the reigning Capsabattle champion and the mysterious beautiful Capser…

**Celebloomers:** Celebloomers-san!!!

**Shirou:** Is that true, Shinji?!

**Shinji:** Yeah!

**Shinji:** Celebloomers-san is the Capsaba champ who uses the orthodox financial-power style, famous for annihilating her opponents with a deck put together by using money!

**Shinji:** Hey, you’re not bowing deeply enough, Emiya!

**Shirou:** I see, so it all comes down to money!

**Celebloomers:** No, um, you see, by use of clever tactics and technique…

**Shinji:** In the end, Capsule Servant is all about how many strong rare Servants you can collect!

**Shinji:** Normally, everyone reads the mood to keep the game fun, but…

**Shinji:** Celebloomers-san can’t, so she spent a ton of money loading her deck with rare Servants!

**Shinji:** To the extent that even I, the son of the noble Matou family, can’t help but be turned off by it, phew!

**Shirou:** I see, phew!

**Celebloomers:** Very well, now die!



![](https://i.imgur.com/BhQpaNm.jpg)

**Celebloomers:** H-how could I lose…?

**Celebloomers:** A-are you telling me I still haven’t spent enough money?!

**Shirou:** Yeah, I think there’s something more important than money.

**Shinji:** Yes, Capsaba is a battle of bonds.

**Shinji:** What’s important is whether you and your Servants communicate with your hearts!

**Celebloomers:** Liz, clean up this wakame.

**Liz:** Okay, then come this way.

**Shinji:** Young Capsers, let us meet again! Phew!

**Sella:** Milady, please do not be discouraged. However, I would be most grateful if you would take this as an opportunity to grow out of this worthless game.

**Celebloomers:** No no no no!

**Celebloomers:** I’m the champ!

**Celebloomers:** I collected a lot of rare Servants, so I’m the strongest!!!

**???:** Haaahahahaha! How unsightly, Capsabattle world champion Celebloomers!

**Celebloomers:** Wha–?! This voice…?!



![](https://i.imgur.com/YNfGJyW.jpg)

**Gilgamesh:** Celebloomers – if that was your name – you have made no mistake!

**Gilgamesh:** The foundation of the game of Capsaba is amassing property.

**Gilgamesh:** Witness the power of true excessive spending, to which the likes of you cannot compare!

**Celebloomers:** Aaaaah?! Is that Servant–?!

**Gilgamesh:** Wahahahaha, terrifying, is it not? I spent the entirety of my treasury on collecting many super-rare Servants!

**Gilgamesh:** Among them is even this Galactica Saber, a super-rare Servant specially drawn by Takeuchi Takashi! I hug it while I sleep every night!

**Celebloomers:** H-how could it be… How could I, the world champ Celebloomers, lose at spending…

**Celebloomers:** S-Shirou-kun, you defeated me, so I entrust the rest to you…

**Celebloomers:** Please, please obtain the legendary ultra-rare Servant that even I could not get…

**Celebloomers:** “Galactica Saber FE (Final Edition)”

**Celebloomers:** Please… Guh…

**Sella:** Milady?!

**Liz:** By collecting all the Saber editions from limited-time Servant draws…

**Liz:** …there’s apparently a rare chance of drawing Galactica Saber FE, Shirou.

**Shirou:** All right! I’m retiring from Capsaba!

**The End**

**The Mysterious Heroic Spirit, FRAGA Appears**



![](https://i.imgur.com/xW1M2w5.jpg)



---



**???:** Oh. You there, please wait a minute.

**Shirou:** Hm? Do you need something, mister?

**???:** Who are you calling mister? No matter how you look at it, I’m a miss!

**???:** …Ah, no, it’s nothing.

**???:** …If I’m yelling at child like this I really need to have more self-discipline…

**???:** Er, I was dispatched by the Heroic Spirit Association in order to save the world from crisis. I am the temp Heroic Spirit Baze… I mean, FRAGA.

**Shirou:** I see. I won’t ask what the Heroic Spirit Association is!

**FRAGA:** Thank you for being so understanding. The Capsule Servants, which out of all the parallel worlds only exist in this one…

**FRAGA:** This social power created through the use of the grail…

**FRAGA:** They are too dangerous for children to have, in the allowance-related sense.

**FRAGA:** I won’t say anything mean, so please hand all those Servants over to me.

**Shirou:** I see. By the way, mister, you’re dressed pretty normal for a Heroic Spirit.

**FRAGA:** Eh? Is there something strange about it?

**Shirou:** Y’see, Heroic Spirits have cool outfits and Noble Phantasms and stuff. I saw it on TV, they shoot beams out of swords and stuff like that.

**FRAGA:** Eh? Cool outfits?

**FRAGA:** No, but this suit is order-made and, look, the fabric, the fabric is very nice!

**FRAGA:** And as for the Noble Phantasm, um, s-see these fists?!

**Shirou:** By the way, how did you become a Heroic Spirit?

**FRAGA:** Eh? How, well…

**FRAGA:** 5000 push-ups a day, 5000 sit-ups, and 100km of running.

**FRAGA:** I kept up that daily routine and kept taking on work and eventually found myself like this…

**Shirou:** I see. Were you satisfied with that life?

**FRAGA:** Eh? W-what’s with this boy?

**FRAGA:** W-well, you could say I didn’t really have anything better to do, or something like that.

**Shirou:** By the way, what does “temp” mean if you’re a Heroic Spirit?

**FRAGA:** Urk…

**FRAGA:** Well, of course I would have preferred regular employment…

**FRAGA:** Lately there’ve been too many new Heroic Spirits, and I was pretty tied up after graduation…

**Shirou:** I see, so you wasted your precious new-graduate period!

**FRAGA:** But I tried hard at job hunting too! I even got an interview in the end.

**FRAGA:** I got a letter that said, “We don’t have any openings at the moment, but we may contact you at a further opportunity.”

**FRAGA:** “Would it be okay to contact you at that time?”

**FRAGA:** So I thought I’d work as a temp while I wait for them to contact me…

**Shirou:** I see. I hate to tell you this, but that was a rejection letter!

**FRAGA:** What did you just say?! No wonder they didn’t contact me!

**FRAGA:** What on earth?! If they wanted to reject me, why couldn’t they just clearly say they were rejecting me?!

**Shirou:** Yeah, I wonder why. That’s society for you, I guess!

**FRAGA:** Guh! A-anyway, I have to work now if I want to eat!

**FRAGA:** If I think about the future my Sunday afternoons will be painful, so for now I’ll immerse myself in battle!

**FRAGA:** So, to go back to what I was saying earlier, prepare yourself!

**Shirou:** Yeah, I guess some things are just hopeless!



**FRAGA:** I… I lost…

**FRAGA:** I wonder if my work-related injury insurance will cover this… Ah, I was a temp worker.

**FRAGA:** Ooh… I’m so envious of how easy the regularly employed Heroic Spirits have it…

**Shirou:** Yeah, I don’t know what to say!

**FRAGA:** I’m not working as a temp Heroic Spirit because I want to.

**FRAGA:** But even if I turned things around and appeared as a regular Servant…

**FRAGA:** …a temp Heroic Spirit would never be accepted over an official Heroic Spirit…

**Shirou:** Hmmm, then how do you become an official Heroic Spirit?

**FRAGA:** Well, by participating in the Holy Grail War and getting good results, for example…

**FRAGA:** That is, you just need good achievements!

**FRAGA:** …But a temp Heroic Spirit wouldn’t get that chance to begin with.

**FRAGA:** Aah! Who made the Holy Grail War like this?!

**Shirou:** I see, then if I ever participate in the Holy Grail War, I’ll contract with you, mister!

**FRAGA:** Like I said, I’m not a mister…

**FRAGA:** What?! Really?! You’re not lying, right?!

**FRAGA:** It’s not something like, “Would it be okay to contact you when the Holy Grail War takes place?”

**FRAGA:** Right?!

**Shirou:** Yeah, so if I participate I’ll contact you, so give me your contact info!

**FRAGA:** All right, then I’ll give you this earring!

**FRAGA:** You need a relic to summon a Servant!

**FRAGA:** Wah, I’m just like an official Heroic Spirit now, hooraaaay!

**Shirou:** I see, I don’t know if I participate or not, but wait patiently, ok!

**FRAGA:** Yes!

**FRAGA:** Well then, thank you for everything! I’m returning to the Throne of Heroes (for temp use) to wait, so thank you in advance!

**Shirou:** Yeah, then see you later!



**Narration:** ~7 years later~

**FRAGA:** Official Heroic Spirits? You act all high-and-mighty at the workplace, but this is all you’ve got! Ability is everything in the field!

**Shirou:** Ahh, yeah, Baze… I mean, Boxer, that’s enough.

**FRAGA:** Well then, shall we go smash Berserker next?!

**FRAGA:** Please leave everything to Boxer, the Heroic Spirit of the fist, Master!

**FRAGA:** Huhuhu… With these results, I have a real shot at being hired as an offical Heroic Spirit!

**Shirou:** Yep, the Holy Grail War sure is hell!

**The End**

**See The World By Jeanne**

**Jeanne:** About 9700km from Domremy, France, I saw a quiet town from the window of a car.

**Jeanne:** Fuyuki, the town known as the location of the original Holy Grail War.

**Jeanne:** Most of the people living here have been affected by the Holy Grail War, be it in a major or minor way.

**Jeanne:** The large temple visible in the mountains is Ryuudou temple, which contains a large natural cave.

**Jeanne:** The Great Grail with Justeaze as its base is installed there, making it the place where the first and last grails of the Holy Grail War were summoned.

**Jeanne:** Well, people have still been having Grail Wars all over the place after that, though.

**Jeanne:** So I, the maiden of Orleans, Jeanne d’Arc…

**Jeanne:** …am using the Heroic Spirit vacation time that I recieve for completing my work as Ruler to come here to Fuyuki on holiday.

**Shirou:** ?

**Jeanne:** Of course, as France’s biggest celebrity, I haven’t forgotten to disguise myself to hide my identity.

**Jeanne:** It wouldn’t do to see “Shocker! Saint Descends In Far-East Land!” as the headline on tomorrow’s morning newspaper, after all.

**Jeanne:** Despite appearances, I’m the worldwide super-famous Heroic Spirit Jeanne d’Arc, you know?

**Jeanne:** It’s so haaard. It’s so haaard to hide my identity even when I’m on vacation.

**Jeanne:** It’s so haaard to have to hide my name for a different reason than Servants.

**Shirou:** ?

**Jeanne:** Oh, this boy… (gasp)?! Could he be…

**Jeanne:** …a young soldier who was affected by my holy aura, couldn’t contain himself, and rushed to serve under my banner?!

**Shirou:** ?

**Jeanne:** Oh well, there’s not much I can do about it, I am a worldwide super famous Heroic Spirit after all.

**Jeanne:** Anyone who saw the maiden of Orleans walking wearily along the road would pledge to rush through a fleeting yet intense life like a flame in service to her sacred banner, wouldn’t they?

**Shirou:** Ah! I remember! I’ve seen you on TV!

**Jeanne:** Right?! Of course you would.

**Jeanne:** It’s so haaard, it’s so haaard having my uncontainable super famous Heroic Spirit aura (divinity) seep out even if I try to hide it.

**Jeanne:** But I’m in the Ruler position, so I can’t participate directly.

**Jeanne:** Even if you said “if I’m gonna summon anyone it’s gotta be the maiden of Orleans, it’s just common sense!”…

**Jeanne:** …and wanted to summon me, it seems that’s impossible as far as the system goes, so please give up, okay… um… little boy from this country?

**Shirou:** You’re King Arthur, right?! King Arthur! They showed you on that anime on TV! You’re actually a girl, right, I know I know!

**Jeanne:** Damn you, England!



**Jeanne:** How can this be…?

**Jeanne:** To think I was actually not such a famous Heroic Spirit in the East…

**Jeanne:** What were you doing, Xavier?

**Shirou:** Sorry, seems I mistook you for someone else!

**Jeanne:** I don’t think I can be that easily mistaken for King Arthur though… My chest, for example…

**Jeanne:** No, but still, I’m Jeanne d’Arc, you know?! From the Hundred-Year War?!

**Jeanne:** When you think “hero of France”, you think me, right?!

**Shirou:** Sorry. But I do know of Napoleon!

**Jeanne:** Even that little man?!

**Jeanne:** Grrr…

**Jeanne:** Here! Please look at this flag, it’s an amazing Noble Phantasm!

**Jeanne:** One wave of this even made Gilles so full of spirit he went France BASARA on the enemy camp and it was a huge mess!

**Shirou:** Sorry, it’s kinda plain. A sword that shoots beams is easier to understand!

**Jeanne:** Waaaaah! Fine!

**Jeanne:** Stupid, stupid! Pink hair! I’m never coming back to this countryyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy!

**Shirou:** Sorry, pretty foreign ladyyyyyyy! I don’t really get it, but sorryyyyyyyy!



**Narration:** ~7 years later~

**Shirou:**

**Lancer:**

**Jeanne:** I will ask you. Might you be my Master?

**Shirou:**

**Jeanne:** Or whatever. I can’t stand out if I don’t participate!

**Jeanne:** Being Ruler feels more like a punishment. I wanted to try competing for the grail too sometime!

**Jeanne:** Oh, my Noble Phantasm? Don’t worry, I brought a really flashy one.

**Jeanne:** Look at this one-time-use Crimson– Ah, this was a self-destruction Noble Phantasm! (tee-hee)

**Shirou:** Wait wait wait.

**Jeanne:** It might finally be coming! The Jeaaaaaaaaanne boom!

**Jeanne:** There’ll be a Red Jeanne and a Sakura Jeanne, gosh, guess there’s no helping it since I’m such a popular character!

**Jeanne:** It’s so haaard, it’s so haaard being popular, I’m tired of all these Jeanne clones…

**Jeanne:** …Do you think I might be well on my way to becoming a star cash-cow like that?!

**Shirou & Lancer:** Wait wait wait wait wait wait wait.

**The End**

**TO-SAKA:** Welcome, vaguely familiar-looking bad boy!

**TO-SAKA:** I am an envoy from the parallel universe where Heroic Spirit EMIYA was not created…

**TO-SAKA:** The ultimate, final possibility for a certain perfect young girl…

**TO-SAKA:** Heroic Spirit TO-SAKA!

**Shirou:** I see, so you’ve reached the end of the line!

**TO-SAKA:** Yes, I’m the wandering witch, journeying through the dimensions to destroy every grail…

**TO-SAKA:** Magical Witch TO-SAKA!

**Shirou:** I see, please be clear about whether you’re a Heroic Spirit or not!

**TO-SAKA:** …On that day, stricken with grief, I was forced to make a most terrible decision.

**TO-SAKA:** …Yes, I formed a contract with the world.

**Shirou:** I see, you had it hard!

**TO-SAKA:** Yes, I had to make the contract.

**TO-SAKA:** …To repay my excessively large loan!

**Shirou:** I see, just as I expected, you brought it on yourself!

**TO-SAKA:** Anyway, the world said…

**TO-SAKA:** “Hmmm, they’re having too many Grail Wars over there, we don’t lend out Heroic Sprits for free, you know…”

**TO-SAKA:** “So since you’re new, TO-SAKA-san, we thought we’d have you destroy the grails in a few worlds so there’ll be fewer Grail Wars…”

**TO-SAKA:** “Yep, for each grail you destroy that’s 3% of your loan paid off, so thanks in advance!”

**TO-SAKA:** So I’m busy destroying grails every day!

**Shirou:** Time flies when you’re hard at work, huh?

**TO-SAKA:** So I’ll be destroying this world’s grail too!

**TO-SAKA:** The after-effects may blow this town off the map, but it’s to repay my loan, so oh well! Wow!

**Shirou:** I see. This is too much in a lot of ways and I can’t stand to look, so I’m gonna stop you!



**TO-SAKA:** As I expected… I remember now.

**TO-SAKA:** You are… yes, you’re Shirou, aren’t you…

**Shirou:** I don’t get it, but hang in there, Heroic Spirit TO-SAKA!

**TO-SAKA:** Huhu, that tendency to be nice to everyone hasn’t changed.

**TO-SAKA:** …No, I’m the one who changed.

**TO-SAKA:** Even if it’s to repay my debts, to think I’d contract with the world and be reduced to a destructive witch…

**Shirou:** I think I’ve heard this story somewhere before, but anyway, let’s end this, TO-SAKA!

**TO-SAKA:** …Yes, that’s right. I need to put an end to it.

**TO-SAKA:** …Thank you, Shirou. I remembered… my true self… (slump)

**Shirou:** TO-SAKAAAAAAAAAAAAA!



**TO-SAKA:** …That’s right.

**TO-SAKA:** Now that I think about it, even if it was to pay back a loan I could never afford on my own, contracting with the world just isn’t like me at all!

**TO-SAKA:** If you can’t pay it back, then just don’t!

**TO-SAKA:** Be it the bank, or the world!

**Shirou:** Yeah, that’s the TO-SAKA I know, even though we just met today!

**TO-SAKA:** Right! It’s better to take over the world and loan out Heroic Spirits for the Holy Grail War for a fee!

**TO-SAKA:** I could call it a Heroic Spirit temporary employment agency. Ranging from rank E to A, depending on the client’s budget!

**TO-SAKA:** Your reliable partner in the Holy Grail War, TO-SAKA Heroic Sprit Service, awaits your patronage!

**Shirou:** Yeah, doing whatever you want feels TO-SAKA-like, so that’s fine!

**Shirou:** Well, I’m going home, so do your best!

**TO-SAKA:** Well then, first things first, let’s go beat the world senseless!

**TO-SAKA:** Here we go, Shirou!

**Shirou:** Ah, I gotta go too?

**Shirou:** Okay, I thought so, so whatever.

**TO-SAKA:** As I’d expect from Shirou, even as a child that part of you hasn’t changed!

**TO-SAKA:** All right, time to start my venture! I’m going to embrace my ambition!
