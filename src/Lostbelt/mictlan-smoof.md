**Kadoc:**

> This is—-- What in the world is this place—--  
>   
> Looks like an operating room and a lifeform who seems to be dead…?

**Fujimaru Ritsuka:**

> …  
>   
> Situationally, this person—

**Kadoc:**

> Yea, this person was the one who was the Master of the Servant in the Singularity.  
>   
> Moriarty called it, “Specimen: E”.

**Mashu:**

> .! I apologize for being taken back by this. But I’ll start collecting surrounding data!

**Kadoc:**

> Go ahead. Please scan everything in this room. I’ll go ahead and look into any used spells or mana residuals as well.  
>   
> …That would be the best thing to do right now. But with all this modern equipment here, for mana to be here is—

**Guda:**

> Just now—  
>   
> Mashu, Kadoc, I have a bad feeling about this!

**Kadoc:**

> Stop yelling like that, freaks me out! But I’ve seen that look on your face many times!  
>   
> It means we’re in danger! Mashu, scan faster!

**Mashu:**

> Alright! I only have 10 seconds left to record and measure every bit of information in this room!

**Kadoc:**

> Alright, the door’s still open! Once Mashu is done scanning, we’re getting out of here!  
Fujimaru! You—---  
>   
> Why are you carrying the corpse!? Don’t touch shit if you don’t know what it is!

**Fujimaru Ritsuka:**

> (...I mean, it looks scary…)  
>   
> But, leaving it here is a bit…  
>   
> Let’s put it outside at least…

Mashu is finished with her scan and everyone escapes along with the corpse. The bonds of matter in the space are becoming untangled and there’s a timespace disturbance with no passage before them. Mashu forcibly transports Fujimaru and Kadoc out of there.

Back at the ship, Goredolf does a check on the trio. The trio has gotten some rest and have begun taking preparations for the next Lostbelt. Goredolf congratulates you guys for annihilating Traum as it was safely extinguished. He also holds out hope that Sherlock Holmes will return. Nemo states that everyone such as Muniere, Sion and Da Vinci are working hard to analyze everything and report it soon. 

Currently, the Storm Border is hovering over North America and will take two days to arrive at the Amazon Rainforest in South America. Sion congratulates your return from Traum and advises that energy plays a big factor in summoning Servants. 

![](https://i.redd.it/6aw69f44p18a1.png)

Sion says to Kadoc that she was also convinced that Holmes was an Apostle of the “Foreign God”. There are two reasons why Sion believed this to be true. The first being the Sixth Singularity in which Sherlock Holmes got information by being in sync with TRI HERMES. A mere Heroic Spirit would have their Spirit Origin burst due to information overload. The second was that he stopped thinking about the “Foreign God’s” motive by becoming Chaldea’s ally.

Sion says that the “Foreign God” wanted him to cooperate with Chaldea. Sion assumed that his job was either “Cooperate up to Point A, but stop cooperating beyond Point B” or “If Chaldea has accomplished Point A, then annihilate Chaldea from the inside.”

![](https://i.redd.it/5bwx4cw5p18a1.png)

Nemo asks if Sherlock Holmes should’ve came back if he rebelled against the “Foreign God”, but that’s where the mystery lies and the hint on how to approach the essence of the “Foreign God” as Sion says that he didn’t choose self-destruction. Holmes left the stage because as long as he was the Management Advisor then, he’ll live and continue to follow the “Foreign God”.

![](https://i.redd.it/0d0lkjrbp18a1.png)

Da Vinci appears over the transmission and says that Specimen: E yielded bonus results for her. There was a Virus Data Bomb just hiding in that corner of space. If she opened it, then it’d explode, but Goredolf yells at her to stop, put the lid on and go outside. Moriarty interrupts the transmission.

![](https://i.redd.it/x3w78mjdp18a1.png)

**Moriarty:**

> Ah, test, test. Can you hear me? Is this even shooting properly?  
>   
> Oh. Alright, that’s a nice angle. Unfortunately, there’s no chairs around here, so I’ll have to just stand.  
>   
> Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Or good evening. I am the evil genius, James Moriarty.  
>   
> By the time this file is opened, I would have already disappeared. Truly unfortunate.  
>   
> I prepared this just in case something happened, but this is a pre-recorded Moriarty video.  
>   
> Now. I know we’ve been through a lot, but let’s wash that away please.  
>   
> I wanted to save the world. It’s a heavy burden for Chaldea, no, for Fujimaru.  
>   
> I can effectively save the world.  
>   
> It’s because I have a lot of pride.  
>   
> This is not to alarm Master Fujimaru.  
>   
> Since I was too shy to directly tell you, I’ll tell you here and now.  
>   
> I do not acknowledge Fujimaru. I want you to never be mistaken about that.

Mashu:

> I apologize. May I delete this video?

**Guda:**

> Hold on.  
>   
> Let’s hold on there.

![](https://i.redd.it/i5nen9ahp18a1.png)

**Moriarty:**

> You guys have gained information on “Specimen: E”.  
>   
> It’s Chaldea’s job to analyze what “Specimen: E” is…but that’s a bit of a service.  
>   
> That thing is not a lifeform of Earth.  
>   
> It is the remains of a lifeform that has been concealed, surveyed and experimented on in that facility for about 100 years.  
>   
> In its final moments, it screamed out to its brethren, but it seems it called out to the “Foreign God”...  
>   
> I wasn’t able to find anything out other than that. But that’s because I missed the readings I needed.  
>   
> TRISMEGISTUS II in the Storm Border should be able to reach those answers.  
>   
> Now then, farewell, Chaldea. I pray that you guys discover the answers…well, I won’t pray for that.  
>   
> Miracles are always bound to happen. Praying to god is something that students do when they’ve forgotten their homework.

**Kadoc:**

> That bastard, is he trying to be sarcastic!?

**Mashu:**

> He’s a horrible professor…! He’s a bad influence on Master’s personality!

![](https://i.redd.it/jpx9n77kp18a1.png)

**Moriarty:**

> Are Kadoc Zemlupus’s and Mashu Kyrielight’s reactions over?  
>   
> Ah, ahem. Let me do you another service.  
>   
> With all this good will…or well, disservice I’ve done, I’m at risk of never being summoned at Chaldea in the future.  
>   
> Let me be clear, you guys don’t have a lot of time.  
>   
> With U-Olga Marie appearing as the “Foreign God”, she plans to further strengthen her Saint Graph.  
>   
> There is an “Existence Outside the Domain” that slumbers within South America. This absolute taboo is classified only to the “Department of Lore” within the Mage Association.  
>   
> It is a genuine invader (invasive lifeform) on this planet—  
>   
> This cosmic being is named “ORT”. Her current goal is to fuse with it.  
>   
> Hahaha, are you shocked? Surprised? If so, then that is delightful.  
>   
> The time limit draws near. You have no time to rest after defeating me.  
>   
> Once the “Foreign God” gets her hands on ORT, we lose.  
>   
> You better hurry. Or else, this planet will split in two with all this evil potential it has.

![](https://i.redd.it/zfobn1dmp18a1.png)

Goredolf is shocked by the name ORT while you’re oblivious to that name. Goredolf rephrases a nasty quote about ORT and envies you for not hearing that name even once.

![](https://i.redd.it/himxausnp18a1.png)

**Kadoc:**

> ORT, huh, well…  
>   
> In words you’ll understand, it’s a horror story that spreads around within the mage world.  
>   
> They say that “before the Common Era, it was a comic lifeform that landed in South America and anyone who would get close to it would be killed”.  
>   
> There wasn’t a single living mage who’d return after stepping into its domain.  
>   
> Regardless, whether it was considered too dangerous to leave alone or for scientific interest…  
>   
> In the 16th century, a long awaited Grand-ranked mage embarked to South America with 6 fellow Brand-ranked mages.  
>   
> It’s the highest rank that a mage can ever achieve in the mage world. A monster able to tackle a country alone.  
>   
> A rank below that would be the Brand mages who are jewel-like prodigies with abilities that rival a Grand’s.  
>   
> Seven of them collectively venturing is a never before seen event.  
>   
> In actuality, it seemed that there was a festive mood in the exploration logs of the campsite they made in the deep forest.  
>   
> However…only one mage came back from that exploration.  
>   
> “That thing can never be touched. No human on this Earth can do it”.  
>   
> “Wait for the next period. We will place our hope onto new evolved lifeforms who’ll come after our extinction.”  
>   
> While he was talking, he became a living crystal before the public’s eyes.  
>   
> The mage’s name was Astea. One of the twelve lords of the Clock Tower at the time.  
>   
> After the incident, the institutional head (the top) of the Mage Association and Clock Tower announced that this lifeform be named “ORT”.  
>   
> Henceforth, South America came to be well known as an demon-infested area that humanity should never walk into.  
>   
> For mage families who were on the edge like mine, it was a questionable fairytale.  
>   
> Look at Goredolf, nobles were told this as if it were a fact.  
>   
> Parents would terrify their misbehaving child with “ORT is coming for you”.

Goredolf tells you that if ORT started moving, it’d crush the Earth in seconds as he was told. Nemo confesses that it appeals to his sense of adventure and Goredolf warns him about that attitude.

![](https://i.redd.it/81wnnk9qp18a1.png)

**Mashu:**

> I remembered something. There was a description of “ORT” in Chaldea’s library.  
>   
> Currently, “ORT” is affirmed to be the strongest and mysterious lifeform in the mage world.  
>   
> It is a tremendous spider-shaped cosmic lifeform that possesses a hard, soft, hot and cold exterior with an energy generation that’s a nuclear fusion reaction in its interior, and touching it would turn you into a crystallized substance.  
>   
> We can only hope that humanity’s technology will advance so that we can analyze it in 3000 A.D. It is truly a “Threat to Humanity”.

Sion is confused and ponders why the “Foreign God” would even fuse with ORT when she’s already strong enough as is. Nemo proposes that as an acclaimed President of the Earth, she’ll become possessive of the things that reside here. Sion gives an example of Chaldea being level 50 and the “Foreign God” at level 1000, with the fusion with ORT, she’d be at level 10,000.

Sion proposes to everyone in Chaldea and in the Storm Border that they’ll have to work on confirming if she can actually fuse with anyone. If she can, then everything they’ve worked on since Lostbelt 6 will be worthless.

**Sion:**

> The Storm Border will depart for the Seventh Lostbelt as it finalizes adjusting its equipment.  
>   
> Let’s find the “Foreign God” and crush her before she can fuse with “ORT”!

**Fou:**

> Fou, fooou!

**Nurse Nemo:**

> I’m glad. This is perfect for you. As expected of Habetrot-san. Great job.

> This is what you’ll use against the Seventh Lostbelt…no, against the “Foreign God”.

**Fujimaru Ritsuka:**

> I’m alright.

**Fou:**

In the medical room, Da Vinci and Mashu talk about the condition of Ortenaus. Both seem pretty relieved that there’s no complications with it. Mashu seems to have an easier time with it and with Black Barrel. However, while Mashu is growing stronger and almost equivalent to a Top Servant, Da Vinci places a restriction on Black Barrel. The main usage for it now is “Bombardment via Mana Compression”. The calculation of Life Scale using Accomplish Measure, the formation of the Black Barrel and the creation of Dead Counter are forbidden because it puts too much strain on both the user and the Master. As well as the ban on using it in urban areas since it’ll potentially harm civilians and the effects are wide. This much was relayed to Fujimaru Ritsuka.

![](https://i.redd.it/qt8uvihbc48a1.png)

Da Vinci informs Mashu that the Black Barrel weaponizes the “Concept of Death” and the Atlas Institute deems it a hazard. Regular Servants as they materialize are created via Ether since they can’t grow any stronger than what they were when they’re recorded in the Throne of Heroes. With the concept of a Demi-Servant, Mashu’s Saint Graph is growing due to her physical and mental growth.

The problem here is that Mashu is being more Heroic Spirit-like as she continues to live out her days. Da Vinci lectures her by telling her that Servants are “Ghost Liner: Boundary Record Belts”. The more power Mashu seeks, the more she’ll stop being “Demi”. Da Vinci tells Mashu that if she feels bad about something, she can take off Ortenaus and head back to the Border since she has companions at Novum Chaldea. Da Vinci also mentions that Fujimaru or her haven't given up on Olga Marie.

![](https://i.redd.it/jink2ugcc48a1.png)

**Nemo:**

> The ship will soon be passing through Central America! We’ll be going from Mexico to Guatemala without any enemy interference!  
>   
> As we travel beyond the Bleached Earth, we’ll approach South America’s “Storm Wall”! Operation commences in approximately 20 minutes!

**Goredolf:**

> A-alright! Novum Chaldea, everyone station yourselves!  
>   
> While we are carrying out this operation urgently, preparations have been completed beforehand.  
>   
> So there’s nothing to be worried about! Right, Technical Advisor!?

**Da Vinci:**

> Of course. We have our ace against the “Foreign God”.  
>   
> A sacred sword that’s augmented with the concept of a sacred sword—  
>   
> It’s shown to have a 99.99% success rate. So there won’t be any problems with it in battle including the transformation sequence.

Goredolf is amazed and curious about this. He assumes that it’ll be an artillery weapon that’ll be fired once the transformation sequence is completed. Muniere tells Goredolf that the Marines will be the one firing it. Sion digresses and asks Goredolf if he wants to hear about the analysis of Specimen: E.

![](https://i.redd.it/dglz4c2gc48a1.png)

**Sion:**

1. The operating room is on the same level of our civilization. It’s all state of the art equipment.
2. “Specimen: E” is an unknown lifeform. TRISMEGISTUS II has no corresponding data regarding it.
3. There was a large amount of blood and cells detected in the room, but was wiped clean. This was from a human.

Analysis is far from done, Sion says. But for now she has stopped TRISMEGISTUS II’s analysis to focus on this mission. You ask if a murder occurred due to Point #3. Sion replies that you have a keen eye, but answers that assuming that it was self-inflicted harm, then yes, a murder did happen.

Mashu asks if the blood was the result of some kind of operation from the operating table. Sion replies that it is half possible. The reason why it’s not fully possible is that blood would never travel far or even 1 meter from the operating table. Nemo interrupts them by announcing that they’re approaching their destination.

![](https://i.redd.it/k8l65b0jc48a1.png)

**Professor Nemo:**

> TRISMEGISTUS II has recommended that 4 Servants be summoned for this mission\~.  
>   
> Normally you would use your energy to summon after you’ve landed in the Lostbelt, but Britain set a precedent for us.  
>   
> The first Servant who’s been summoned is headed towards the Control Room.  
>   
> The other three Servants will join you momentarily.

Goredolf says that what Professor Nemo said is right. Summoning in a Lostbelt is not ideal anymore. He goes on about how South America is an cruel land, therefore the Servant has to be strong, cruel, uncivilized and gorilla-like who acts monkey-like.

![](https://i.redd.it/r8lbquyjc48a1.png)

**Nitocris:**

> Who are you calling an ape! That’s disrespectful, Commander of Chaldea!

**Fujimaru Ritsuka:**

> Nitocris!  
>   
> A Medjed looking person!

**Nitocris:**

> Indeed. You look well, Fujimaru Ritsuka. As you can see, I’ve responded to your wish for assistance.

Nitocris states that she is summoned from Chaldea’s record of Nitocris’s Saint Graph. While she’ll know what Chaldea has experienced with her, for Nitocris, this is her first time meeting them.

![](https://i.redd.it/e751dvl2d48a1.png)

She introduces herself as Nitocris, the sky god personification and user of the Underworld Mirror. Mashu notices something different about Nitocris. Nitocris responds that she’s in her “ideal state” with all the mana supply she’s getting from the Storm Border. She also has Independent Action attached to her as well.

Kadoc is surprised that she’s able to act like this and agree to helping Chaldea which makes him assume that she has a lot of faith in Fujimaru. He’s also surprised that she can be this effective with the mana supply she’s been given.

**Da Vinci:**

> Nitocris will be acting as Master’s bodyguard…well, we’re entrusting you to be the bodyguard of the on-field team.  
>   
> We expect you to do a lot of walking and exploring in South America. We’ll also need someone who’s adaptable, suitable in group fights and uses magecraft that’s resistant to fever and impurity.

**Habetrot:**

> Hmm. Seems like I’ll be playing bodyguard, huh. That being the case, I’ll introduce myself.  
>   
> Alright! I’m Habetrot! I’m sort of like the guardian faerie that dwells in Mashu’s shield.

![](https://i.redd.it/7901biioc48a1.png)

Goredolf is pleased that the number of Servants that are able to help us and raises morale by encouraging everyone to find the Fantasy Tree and chop it down. However, Sion and Goredolf mention that there’s no Fantasy Tree to be detected in the Lostbelt, but there should be a Fantasy Tree equivalent there or a conditional Fantasy Tree (LB6 (withered Tree) and LB3 (concealed Tree)). However, neutralizing the “Foreign God” is top priority.

**Nemo:**

> The bow will now commence a dimensional punch! From here on out, operation, defeat the “Foreign God”, commences!

You punched through the Lostbelt Storm Wall, Nemo asks for a visual on how the state of the Seventh Lostbelt looks and everyone is shocked.

![](https://i.redd.it/ismy2pt6d48a1.png)

**Fujimaru Ritsuka:**

> It’s nothing but a…wasteland here.

**Goredolf:**

> What is this, hell–!? Isn’t this supposed to be South America, the Amazon Rainforest!?  
>   
> This is a desiccated land! Heavy thunderclouds! No plants or animals to be seen! Constant rain of volcanic ash!  
>   
> The Amazon jungle is supposed to be known as the “lungs of the Earth”, but not even a human can exist here!  
>   
> It’s like a “volcanic winter” here! Even Lostbelts draw a line somewhere!

**Sion:**

> Mr. Goredolf is right. I can’t even call this Biosphere 1.  
>   
> Lostbelts are “discontinued human histories” and this is too deviated.  
>   
> What was the cause of this…no, I wonder what the circumstances were for the environment to become like this…

**Nemo Professor:**

> Yes, it's surprising. I apologize, but can I have a moment please?  
>   
> I’ve finished scanning the surface, let me transmit it. Ms. Sion, tell me your opinion.

![](https://i.redd.it/zlr2qae8d48a1.png)

**Fujimaru Ritsuka:**

> What…is this?  
>   
> (---I know it. This is—)

**Goredolf:**

> Hm? What is this? I’m sure I know this from somewhere.  
>   
> Zemlupus. Do you know this?

**Kadoc:**

> …Y-yea.  
>   
> It’s, y’know, that. It’s that. Hey, Kyrielight, say it.

**Mashu:**

> This is…possibly Pangea? But I’m not certain it is…

**Sion:**

> No, you’re right. This is undoubtedly the super continent, Pangea.

![](https://i.redd.it/b5qdb05bd48a1.png)

Muniere tells Goredolf that this is not about pancakes and about the supercontinent that predated the continents we have now. The continents we have now are due to crustal movements within the Earth.

![](https://i.redd.it/p7ttyfhdd48a1.png)

Goredolf says that we’re in 2017, but asks why we’re seeing a supercontinent here. Da Vinci’s impression are that this isn’t exactly Pangea since these are unsustainable conditions for humans to live in, but before Da Vinci could elaborate on an extinction event, Fou jumps at the sense that someone is coming with the alarms going off. The one who’s approaching us is U-Olga Marie.

![](https://i.redd.it/nwpwf7ved48a1.png)

**U-Olga Marie:**

> …To think something happened, but it’s you people. Aren’t you all foolish for coming here?  
>   
> Hmm. Perhaps you’ve gone with the momentum and arrived to cut off the seventh Fantasy Tree, but that was truly foolish.  
>   
> Do you have any idea where you are? This is the Lostbelt I selected for my homestay.  
>   
> I can instantly detect any irregularities. As the ruler of Earth, do you think I’d let you trespass on this land?  
>   
> I should’ve formed a gravitational field from the start so that pitiful vehicle could be pulverized…  
>   
> Rejoice. I’m in a very good mood! Grand Servants, was it? The apexes of humanity, decisive magecraft, I have dealt with all 7 Servants in one go.  
>   
> That’s right, I shall give you people a chance!  
>   
> I will lecture you by proving that I am worthy of governing this planet since you won’t take my speech as the truth.  
>   
> Come out and face me, humans!  
>   
> This will be the last, so I shall do what you people consider, savoring this battle.

**Goredolf:**

> Urgghhhhh! This is too sudden, I can’t think!

> But that damn “Foreign God” is acting like some exchange student on Earth! I don’t get her at all!

> Of course! Hume Barrel is ready to go into firing sequence!

**Goredolf:**

> Alright! Operation start! Our enemy is the “Foreign God”, U-Olga Marie!

Mashu deploys “Mold Camelot” and repels it like a tennis ball while U-Olga Marie complements her by telling her that she’s a tennis Heroic Spirit, but Mashu rejects that. With enough time bought, the team is now ready to deploy the holy sword essence incorporated into the Storm Border.

[Video Link](https://reddit.com/link/zv8iu4/video/b78y6450f48a1player)

Professor Nemo states that while the Black Barrel measures the lifespan of a target and converts that into weaponized energy, the holy sword essence measures the threat to humanity but instead of weaponized energy, it’s defensive and does the same thing as the Black Barrel. Now that’s left is to fire it. Captain Nemo fires the Hume Barrel.

[Video Link](https://reddit.com/link/zv8iu4/video/3rj9p5j0f48a1player)

Nemo Marine announces that U-Olga Marie seems to have absorbed it and somehow powered up. This leaves everyone panicked and Goredolf tells the team that even she’s shocked by how she managed to survive. Goredolf assumes that she’ll pull out another gravitational field. Da Vinci and Nemo scramble to produce a second shot. But as Da Vinci is suggesting to switch from a photon reaction shot to an armor piercing shot, Nemo Marine announces something.

![](https://i.redd.it/5gytwu35f48a1.png)

**Nemo Marine A:**

> Wait, wait, we have confirmation of an abnormality on the surface! It’s a massive crustal collapseee!

**Nemo Marine B:**

Muniere reports that the pillar and the “Foreign God” are fighting against each other. Nemo commands Mashu to retreat back to Hatch 1 of where the Shadow Border resides.

**Nemo:**

Nemo and Sion have to stay for Nemo to stay manifested and Nemo commands Da Vinci to get to the hanger as well. Goredolf is the only human left that resides on the front of the ship, but Nitocris tells him that he is under Nitocris’s protection. Kadoc tells you that Nemo will have more freedom once we meet up with Mashu, but Nemo still gives you one of the Marines if you need anything.

The Man hits you and you begin to fall through the sky and you wake up in a cave with Nemo Marine. Nemo Marine is relieved to see you alive and describes how when part of the Storm Border got hit causing you to fall out, Nemo Marine came out and hugged you till you reached the floor and somehow ended up in a cave.

You ask why Nemo Marine is whispering. Nemo Marine responds to look over there.

U-Olga Marie sleeps but is suddenly awakened by your voice. She calls you and Nemo Marine, harmless protists and claims how she is the highest lifeform and has come to be the ruler of this planet. U-Olga Marie does not know who she is and how she’s talking to you and Nemo Marine in this cave.

Amnesia. That is what you and Nemo Marine have deduced her condition to be. All she remembers is her name, purpose and the life-threatening attack she took recently.

**U-Olga Marie:**

U-Olga Marie made “this vessel” in order to travel spacetime. She asks for Nemo Marine’s name and Marine states that Marine is Nemo Marine No. 4 and exclaims repeatedly not to be killed. If you introduce yourself, U-Olga Marie will have a sensation of wanting to punch you in the face after hearing your name. Otherwise, if you exclaim not to be killed, she’ll figure out that your guys’ objective is stay alive.

You and Nemo Marine suggest moving to different places since more hostiles might be coming. U-Olga Marie ponders why lifeforms have evolved to something like that since she thinks it’s an inconvenience. Nemo Marine declares to be the watchman of the group since Marine can’t fight like Captain Nemo or U-Olga Marie.

However, U-Olga Marie questions and rejects this as she proposes to leave everything to her, the strongest person here, since being a watchman and such can be tedious. Nemo Marine wants us to take a look at what the forest has to offer.

U-Olga Marie is puzzled by Nemo Marine’s wavelength. Marine’s wavelength went from red to blue. **Blue for “conversation” and red for “caution or fear”. You seem to radiate a yellow wavelength which stands for “friendship” and “delight”**. Nemo Marine retorts by says that even though Sion and the group won’t like this, Marie has Marine’s support.

Mashu is very happy to see you alive and well after the Storm Border incident. U-Olga Marie introduces herself to who she thinks is Chaldea. Mashu says the wrong name as “Director Olga Marie” and U-Olga Marie corrects her by saying that she forgot the U at the beginning. Mashu begins shivering.

Mashu calms down after what she had seen, but Habetrot tells that it's fine after seeing the “Foreig—”. Mashu and Nemo Marine shut Habetrot up before she could finish that sentence. Mashu and Habetrot are caught up in the situation and Mashu expresses her gratitude to Marie for being there and helping them. Either way you want to speak with Tepeu more and Marie upon seeing Tepeu backs away immediately.

U-Olga Marie interrupts and says that deinos should be at a higher level than humans. She also expresses her discontent with Tepeu’s voice and wants him to take in another frequency.

**Tepeu:**

Mashu also talks about how far the crust is in comparison to this Lostbelt. Tepeu is intrigued by our world’s environment.

**Tepeu:**

Whether you heard of the word “Ocelotl” or not, Mashu gives you a brief explanation of it. But if you do, you’ll be reminded of Jaguarman from Babylonia. Mashu says that it is a Nahuatl word for “jaguar” and it is used in Central and South America. Elite jaguar warriors of the Aztec empire and Aztec mythology as well as an alter ego of the war god, Tezcatlipoca. They also could be Elementals lurking in the jungle. This reminds U-Olga Marie of the enemies they fought for the first time.

Since Mashu thinks that it’s like a smuggling organization, you and Mashu propose that they go back to the Storm Border and rescue the others. Last contact with the Storm Border was about 4 hours ago and it’ll take several days to repair functionality.

Habetrot seems confident to go out there and do some exploring. She’s confident since you have the power to summon Servants and utilize the Black Barrel. However, you tell them that you are not a Master anymore since you don’t have Command Seals. But that doesn’t deter you from committing to go to the Storm Border.

Nemo Marine is whining about the heat and that it’s too hot. Mashu tells Marine to get into some shade and asks you if your Mystic Code is functioning properly after everything that’s happened.

![](https://i.redd.it/m21nf64whh8a1.png)

**Tepeu:**

> Currently, the sun has arrived at the third layer. This heat will continue for a while.

> When the sun becomes more distant, the temperature will decrease, so there’s no need to be hasty.  
>   
> Do you think we should take a break around here? While it may be a long journey, taking breaks is important.

Mashu reports that you’ve been walking for 2 hours and proposes to take a 15 minute break. Marine can sense nearby water, so Marine goes out and gets water for the group. Habetrot goes with Marine to help out and requests Mashu to give her some mana.

![](https://i.redd.it/0gotl4mzhh8a1.png)

U-Olga Marie is gaining a lot of information like the humidity, temperature, etc from being in the jungle. She states that it’s like a flood of life from micro to macro which is also like a choking wave of colors. Marie also states that she can get nauseous if she focuses with her sensors. However, you and Mashu get to see a vomiting U-Olga Marie because of sensory overload. Mashu advises reducing the sensitivity to help her out and adapt and U-Olga Marie heeds that advice.

U-Olga Marie asks if Mashu is a human, but Mashu introduces herself and answers that she’s a demi-human. Marie acts as if she knows what that is, but doesn’t like the word so she asks Mashu to come up with a better term.

![](https://i.redd.it/h5n9zhb1ih8a1.png)

Nemo Marine comes back and nonchalantly says that Marine is getting swamped by ferocious dinosaurs and immediately asks for help and goes into the back. A dinosaur roars. You ask Tepeu if he knows this person.

**Tepeu:**

> They’re berserk deinos who've had their brain deteriorated. They’re neither alive or dead.

> They prey on “surrounding lifeforms” to convert to energy as if they’re the jungle’s malignant tumors.

**Mashu:**

After the battle, you reach a corn field. Teppu states that they eat this for pleasure only. Nemo Marine and Tepeu have a conversation about what a corn field can be useful for. U-Olga Marie states that this is for ethanol as well, but asks if something like this is also food for humans as well. Mashu says that depending on the usage, corn fields are cultivated differently.

![](https://i.redd.it/39iatheejh8a1.png)

Habetrot tells Fujimaru that it’s been six hours since we left the cave and the sun hasn’t set. Habetrot wonders why the sun has yet to set. Mashu answers that Mictlan is a sealed structure that’s folded inwards. U-Olga Marie adds that this could be “celestial travel” where there’s no rotation or revolution. She doesn’t know where it’s being controlled but it’s something that humanity can’t achieve with its current technology. Tepeu apologizes for being distracted by conversing with Nemo Marine and not giving a proper explanation.

It is now night time and you spend the night talking to Tepeu about your “humanity”. Tepeu learns about the six continents, the diverse group of ethnicities, multiple cultures and the like. He also learns that his race would be considered reptiles. He has never heard the word ocean before.

![](https://i.redd.it/mwz2vga2mh8a1.png)

Tepeu states that there are a rare number of deinos who have adapted to aquatic life because usually deinos and their skeleton would enlarge causing them to have difficulty moving on land. After learning democracy and communism, Tepeu has figured out how politics and society functions and wants to move on to the next topic. He’s amazed at how civilization has evolved over the years. He’s also impressed by how much we explored our planet and how we’ve observed planets while not having the equipment and technology to fly into space.

![](https://i.redd.it/5ogb5o14mh8a1.png)

Some time passes. Tepeu has learned about how we deal with cells, elements, atoms, etc. He’s delighted at how we need miniscule laws to understand the vastness of space. He puts up an analogy of how our chronology is like a constantly pattern-changing cube.

![](https://i.redd.it/58t066i6mh8a1.png)

Mashu states that Tepeu would always keep talking and asking questions about many things like laws and the like. You wonder if he is an exceptional deinos. Nemo Marine asks if he became a hermit because of how smart he was. Tepeu rephrases that entire question into one term, a heretic. Tepeu affirms the question and states that since his thought process wasn’t on the same wavelength as the other deinos, he moved to the first layer.

**Tepeu:**

> Deinos possess no intellect. Our bodies do not need to be supplemented with knowledge.  
>   
> Homo sapiens have a short lifespan, get easily hurt, and are inferior to other lifeforms in regards to survivability.  
>   
> That is why they develop their body and intellect. But we, deinos, **are a different case**.  
>   
> Mictlan has no such threats. Therefore, evolution was unnecessary.

Tepeu is also amazed about the digestive system of the human body, and how it allows you to remove the toxins of a plant and absorb its nutrients. He envies you for being able to use many plants as food.

![](https://i.redd.it/ovatl7r9mh8a1.png)

**Tepeu:**

Nemo Marine tells Tepeu that it is such a cruel thing to do as if the Ocelotl are torturing them. You ask why they’d do that.

**Tepeu:**

>   
> Those two cities are in between us and the Storm Border’s emergency landing spot which is your guys’ destination.

Mashu informs you that Tezcatlipoca is a Divine Spirit and is surprised that Kukulkan is present in the deinos city. Nemo Marine says that seeing gods in Lostbelts are common now, but Mashu states that it’s illogical for a Mayan God to be in Mictlan. She also realizes that Mictlan is the name of the underworld in Aztec mythology.

**Tepeu:**

> So you’re saying that your guys’ mythology and our world have no common ground, right?

Mashu, currently, wants to discuss how to deal with U-Olga Marie. She reviews her condition of amnesia. She knows her name, purpose and doesn’t know about the Storm Border fight, Bleached Earth, Lostbelts, etc. Nemo Marine thinks that U-Olga Marie is less annoying since she’s “managing” instead of “dominating” the Earth. Habetrot tells them that friends don’t keep secrets from other friends.

![](https://i.redd.it/58l88mvlnh8a1.png)

You call U-Olga Marie over to the campfire to tell her everything about yourself and her. Over the span of the explanation, Marie has learned about Servants, Masters, mages, Chaldea, Singularities, Lostbelts, etc. U-Olga Marie now sees you and Chaldea in a better light. She gives it a 90/100 because there isn’t a finishing touch to it like a shining presence. You suggest Marie to be that presence which delights her very much.

**U-Olga Marie:**

After a while, Mashu suggests that we sleep for about seven hours since it’ll take twelve for the sun to come up so that we leave the corn field early. Nemo Marine will be the watchman for the group as they sleep.

Mashu concludes that these Underworld Layers will be very fearsome places. She asks if Tepeu has conquered these trials and Tepeu responds that he has gone as far as to conquer the third Underworld Layer trial.

The first Underground Layer will have colossal iguanas. Mashu asks if they are the Xochitonal to which Tepeu asks if Pan-Human History have similar underworlds. Mashu talks about Mictlan in Pan-Human History that consists of a Heaven that has thirteen layers, Earth that resides humans and Mictlan which has nine layers. People who naturally die and not through battle go through Mictlan and when they conquer all the trials then their souls return back to nature.

Mashu also explains about the cruelty of the Aztecs with sacrifices, slavery and perpetual fights. Their roots were to be harmonious with nature and grateful to the gods and the world. Mashu thinks that Mictlan in this Lostbelt is similar to their roots.

**Mashu:**

> Yes. The first underground layer, Itzcuintlan. It’s said that in the domain of the vast river, the Apanohuacalhuia river, the dead would have to earn the help of a hairless dog in order to stop being eaten by the colossal iguanas, Xochitonal, and cross the river.

**Tepeu:**

> Dog. What is a dog?

![](https://i.redd.it/pp1akbnpyp8a1.png)

Nemo Marine says that Marine will draw a hairless dog later, but Tepeu makes a sketch of what it could look like from his knowledge. Mashu and Nemo Marine are impressed, but Tepeu is more impressed by how amazing and cruel Pan-Human History is. U-Olga Marie asks why deinos live underground.

Deinos came underground because Maia created that land for them since a meteorite hit the surface and burned everything to ashes. As they thrived in the subterranean world, they had no reason to go back up there.

![](https://i.redd.it/5kopjw1c2q8a1.png)

**U-Olga Marie:**

> Hey, Tepeu. Also Fujimaru and the others.  
>   
> Do you know “ORT”?

Everyone gets silent. Mashu states that Chaldea came here to eliminate ORT. However, that’s not the case anymore because of recent events. U-Olga Marie supports prioritizing other objectives than ORT since Olga deems it not to matter as much (under the influence of her amnesia).

Nemo Marine hears the sounds of water close by and goes to be the first one there.

![](https://i.redd.it/wbm8p0id2q8a1.png)

**Fujimaru Ritsuka:**

> This is the first Underworld Layer—!  
>   
> Huh, this is a river!?

**Nemo Marine:**

> This is impossible\~\~! It’d be impossible to do it with 24 of us Marines.  
>   
> But it’s magnificent so I’m not too sad about it! This vast waterfall feels so nice—!

**Habetrot:**

> Yep. Even the Faerie Country has scenery as great as this.  
>   
> South American mythology is amazing! The scale of nature here is unbelievable!

Mashu says that this is like the Guiana Highlands, the last famous unexplored region on Earth within South America. Mashu is delighted by how Tepeu managed to cross the river and claims that his leg strength and exploration capabilities are very unnatural. Mashu asks him about the route he took to cross it.

![](https://i.redd.it/djl9cbwn2q8a1.png)

**Tepeu:**

> Well, this is different, what is this, this is scary.  
>   
> I apologize, but I have traversed a different one instead of this. It was a vast river, but not to this degree…  
>   
> Fujimaru. Mashu. Is this landscape just as you guys imagined it?

**Fujimaru Ritsuka:**

> Nope.  
>   
> Nope.

**Tepeu:**

> Then…this is not due to a change in your guys’ mentality.  
>   
> Just like when the Crypter came, Chaldea’s arrival gave birth to changes within the “Underworld Layers”.  
>   
> That is my hypothesis… Well, besides that—

**Nemo Marine:**

> Besides that?

![](https://i.redd.it/m870qkrn3q8a1.png)

**Tepeu:**

> This is a thrilling scenery! I’d like to show my acquaintances this great watering place!

**U-Olga Marie:**

>   
> We can be excited later, Tepeu, Marine, and Fujimaru, get behind me!  
>   
> Something’s ascending the bottom of the waterfall! Must be the colossal iguanas!

**Habetrot:**

**Mashu:**

# Arrow 2

![](https://i.redd.it/8i8fzbgg8q8a1.png)

After the battle, Nemo Marine compliments Mashu and U-Olga Marie for their hard work. Habetrot adds that they shouldn't be so overprotective since Fujimaru can defend himself when needed and advises them to have a bit of confidence in him.

![](https://i.redd.it/sk6eyqlw3q8a1.png)

U-Olga Marie corrects Habetrot by saying that she had to be overprotective for Mashu and Habetrot. The reason being that Habetrot uses mana from Mashu’s shield and when that runs out, Habetrot can’t really materialize anymore and can only be replenished via the Storm Border. U-Olga Marie advises Habetrot to conserve that mana to come out when Mashu’s in a tight spot.

U-Olga Marie asks Tepeu if we have to start swimming.

![](https://i.redd.it/lq76vqmy3q8a1.png)

**Tepeu:**

> I cannot swim.  
>   
> Last time, I had to cut down trees to make a raft, but that method won’t work for us.

Mashu compares this to an ocean. Tepeu asks if an ocean is a vast body of water and Nemo Marine affirms it and wants to tell Tepeu about their oceanic journey. 

![](https://i.redd.it/zptd5xk04q8a1.png)

Mashu wants to focus on overcoming this river, but this would be easier if you could summon a Heroic Spirit to fly or cross it. **Mashu lists names like Noah, Moses, Icarus and Sinbad.** U-Olga Marie states that even if they were able to “**normally**” cross it, then they’d work, but if there's a “**mythological approach**” to it, then a Servant with Underworld connections would be better. Mashu compliments her, but uses Director instead of U-Olga which makes U-Olga Marie assume that she’s calling her an old woman.

**???:**

> Ummm… Did you say “Chaldea” just now?  
>   
> I hope I heard that right… It’d be great if you did say that…

**Kingprotea:**

> But, you’re Chaldea’s Master…right? Do you know me?

**Fujimaru Ritsuka:**

> Of course!

> I’m sorry, I don’t…

# Choice 1:

**Kingprotea:**

> Yay, so you’re Fujimaru-san, right!? I was summoned like kaboom! I’m so happy to see you again!

# Choice 2:

**Kingprotea:**

> Is that so? …Even though I remember you…  
>   
> …Is it that, where if I met you in the past, then Fujimaru will meet me in the future…right?  
>   
> Even then, I’m happy to meet you.  
>   
> I am an Alter Ego, Kingprotea.  
>   
> I came from the Imaginary Numbers Sea to give you guys a big splash with everyone’s help!

![](https://i.redd.it/or0k7mk75q8a1.png)

U-Olga Marie is startled and asks if Kingprotea is actually an ally and if Servants are generally like this. Mashu is surprised that Kingprotea showed up in a place like this and Mashu greets her with open arms into the group. 

**Nemo Marine:**

> Ah, I get it! You’re one of the Servants summoned by the Border!  
>   
> Other than Nitocris, 3 other Servants were expected to come. You were one of them, right?

![](https://i.redd.it/f0cdsvg95q8a1.png)

**Kingprotea:**

> Yes, that’s right, Marine-san.  
>   
> I am one of the four Servants that’ll help out Chaldea.  
>   
> But…I thought I could help Chaldea as a Servant of Pan-Human History, but when I woke up, I was on this lake with no one here and noisy bats…  
>   
> I was so worried and I couldn’t move until I heard your guys’ voices…  
>   
> Fufu. I’m happy that I became brave enough to stand up.  
>   
> I was really shocked, but we met up! I look forward to working with you, Master!

**Fujimaru Ritsuka:**

> I look forward to it too, Kingprotea!

U-Olga Marie wants to know what Kingprotea is since Alter Egos shouldn’t exist in Pan-Human History. Kingprotea gives a rundown of what she is. She is a combination of multiple goddesses and also names Airavata as well. Kingprotea also notices something weird mixed in as well, but can’t quite figure it out.

![](https://i.redd.it/m4wpyf7a8q8a1.png)

Kingprotea also explains Airavata. When the Earth was declined by the gods, it became the world of death. Together with the asuras and the troubled gods, they restored the Earth and that was the stirring of the sea of milk which changed the world’s color from dead to alive. The gods threw everything from the world into the sea of milk to create the immortality elixir, Amrita. Thus, the white elephant, Airavata, came into being.

Tepeu is interested in what he’s heard from Kingprotea. But focusing on the main topic, Kingprotea hesitates to ask if she could be the ship that carries everyone through the river, but you ask her anyway. She innocently and gladly accepts the job.

**Kingprotea:**

> This is the first time I've done something this major! I’ll do my very best!

Kingprotea and Nemo Marine are having fun crossing the river together, but U-Olga Marie isn’t riding on Kingprotea because of U-Olga Marie’s fear of Tiamat’s horns. However, everyone else is on Kingprotea’s head.

![](https://i.redd.it/mlsz0v02hq8a1.png)

We’re at the halfway point, but there are strong currents currently so reaching another shore would be best. But suddenly someone heavily injures Kingprotea’s back. No one can see where it’s coming from and Nemo Marine is panicking, but Kingprotea stays strong to fulfill her mission.

**Kingprotea:**

> Everyone, hold on! At least, I’ll get you to the nearest shore…!

**Fujimaru Ritsuka:**

However, Kingprotea, after major blood loss, smiles and faints in the river.

After the battle, Kingprotea took on two Black Barrel shots. U-Olga Marie asks herself why she’s weaker than Kingprotea. Marie suggests going into the jungle in order to conceal ourselves for the time being.

![](https://i.redd.it/zu8fzt2knq8a1.png)

In the jungle, Tepeu tells Marine to be quiet and informs everyone that since Kingprotea is now the Xochitonal or Sentinel of the Underworld, she can’t leave the river to chase us in the jungle. The most urgent thing currently is shelter from danger. U-Olga Marie boasts about her luck that is equivalent to a 99% win rate and 1% loss rate. However, that 1% loss rate becomes reality when Kingprotea squishies U-Olga Marie like a pancake.

![](https://i.redd.it/1fqro42wnq8a1.png)

U-Olga Marie starts the strategy meeting with tears in her eyes. She angrily asks if you had a good time watching her get pummel into a pancake. Back onto the topic at hand. Habetrot informs that no one’s voice can get through to her. U-Olga Marie states that the river is now red due to Protea’s bleeding from her deep back injury. Marie also states that she’s in a state where she can’t make any noise due to the blood loss. You also cannot try to catch Camazotz since he’s already too far away.

**Tepeu:**

> …This is difficult.

> Thanks to Protea, we’ve made it halfway across the vast river, but Protea became our current barrier.

**U-Olga Marie:**

**Tepeu:**

Nemo Marine refuses to wait it out and everyone else knows that isn’t possible for them. You propose an idea, but something is nearby in the forest. You look closer to see a familiar face.

U-Olga Marie seems to understand that with Rasputin’s deep and dark-like blue hue wavelength, he isn’t deceiving her. Nemo Marine tells her to be careful about Rasputin. U-Olga Marie reassures Marine that she cannot be fooled that easily to which Rasputin is quite reassured as well.

Rasputin is here to merely get rid of this astonishing relationship with the group and her and be reminded what she truly is. However, U-Olga Marie is very adamant that she is supporting us throughout the entire way till we reach the Storm Border. This forces Rasputin to **work with us**, however, he cannot assist the group in combat.

**Fujimaru Ritsuka:**

> Wha—  
>   
> Are you really—-

**Rasputin:**

> I only tell the truth. I am a mere butler. Is that not **convenient for you all**?

Mashu tells you that it’s dangerous and unknown if U-Olga Marie suddenly remembers her original self after knowing that he is an Apostle of the Foreign God. She suggests playing along and working with him as U-Olga Marie’s butler.

![](https://i.redd.it/rf3256wf2r8a1.png)

Rasputin clarifies that he is not under U-Olga Marie’s underlying scheme, influence or any of the sort, and he’s also not starved for entertainment to resort to doing any of this. You ask him if he truly knows why U-Olga Marie has amnesia, but Rasputin doesn’t know the answer to that as well. Rasputin is also curious about Limbo (Ashiya Douman) and how he ended up to which you respond by saying that due to reasoning and fair enough punishment.

**Rasputin:**

**Fujimaru:**

> Well—-

**Rasputin:**

> I see. You were a world shrouded in fog and made a deal to come back. I understand the predicament now.

Mashu is in disbelief, but Rasputin says that it’s logical seeing how Kingprotea gave up her soul so readily for Fujimaru and any order pertaining to his Command Seal markings. However, that is not the important thing.

**Tepeu:**

> I see. The contract of exchanging “Command Seals” for “revival” won’t be fulfilled when he’s in the Underworld.

Fortunately for you, you can actually summon while in the Underworld Layers. Rasputin advises you to carefully formulate your team in order to beat Kingprotea. However, with you and U-Olga Marie making such a gloomy face, you confess that they are not trying to kill her, but free her.

**Rasputin:**

# Arrow 4

**Fujimaru Ritsuka:**

> Grigori Rasputin…!  
>   
> Father Kotomine…!

**Rasputin:**

> Thank you, Fujimaru-kun. You saved having me to introduce myself.  
>   
> Feel free to call me either Rasputin or Father Kotomine.  
>   
> But to think I’d bump into you guys while I’m searching for someone. Could this be divine guidance?  
>   
> Oh, I can guess the situation. There’s no need to tell me the details.

> You want to conquer the “First Underworld” to get to the Storm Border.  
>   
> However, you had to make a necessary temporary retreat from the “Underworld Sentinel”.  
>   
> Am I correct?

**Fujimaru Ritsuka:**

> Sure…but why are you here?

**Mashu:**

> That’s right. We have a hostile relationship.  
>   
> There’s no other reason for your appearance than to obstruct us from eliminating the Fantasy Tree.

**Rasputin:**

> Hahahaha. We can’t have this. It seems you have a misunderstanding.  
>   
> But it seems you’ve suffered due to the other Apostles’ actions, right? I am held by sacred professions. I do not enjoy combat.  
>   
> Currently, I act upon a different objective. I did say I was searching for someone.  
>   
> If you can fulfill that, then we shall not be enemies. And for that goal has been fulfilled.

**U-Olga Marie:**

> .?

**Raputin:**

> So you were here all along, my Lady. I have come to pick you up.  
>   
> I was worried when you fell on the ground, but I was relieved to see you without a scratch.  
>   
> Now, let us head back to the Earth Supervision Office, the Great Majestic House.  
>   
> You have much work, entertainment and study materials that awaits you.

**U-Olga Marie:**

> Eh, I don’t know you. Who’re you?

**Rasputin:**

> Hahaha. Such a harsh joke.  
>   
> I am your loyal butler, Rasputin. I’m sure you haven’t forgotten me.

**U-Olga Marie:**

> .???????????????????

![](https://i.redd.it/lgv0gm6d2r8a1.png)

**Rasputin:**

> Hahahaha. Hahahahahaha.  
>   
> Forgive me, I was appalled by my Lady’s open-mindedness, I couldn’t hold it in.  
>   
> It is fine if you do not remember my name. “Priest” should be quite enough for you.  
>   
> It’s crucial that I am my Lady’s butler. I am your servant, an ally.  
>   
> Are you aware of at least that?

U-Olga Marie seems to understand that with Rasputin’s deep and dark-like blue hue wavelength, he isn’t deceiving her. Nemo Marine tells her to be careful about Rasputin. U-Olga Marie reassures Marine that she cannot be fooled that easily to which Rasputin is quite reassured as well.

Rasputin is here to merely get rid of this astonishing relationship with the group and her and be reminded what she truly is. However, U-Olga Marie is very adamant that she is supporting us throughout the entire way till we reach the Storm Border. This forces Rasputin to **work with us**, however, he cannot assist the group in combat.

**Fujimaru Ritsuka:**

> Wha—  
>   
> Are you really—-

**Rasputin:**

> I only tell the truth. I am a mere butler. Is that not **convenient for you all**?

Mashu tells you that it’s dangerous and unknown if U-Olga Marie suddenly remembers her original self after knowing that he is an Apostle of the Foreign God. She suggests playing along and working with him as U-Olga Marie’s butler.

![](https://i.redd.it/rf3256wf2r8a1.png)

Rasputin clarifies that he is not under U-Olga Marie’s underlying scheme, influence or any of the sort, and he’s also not starved for entertainment to resort to doing any of this. You ask him if he truly knows why U-Olga Marie has amnesia, but Rasputin doesn’t know the answer to that as well. Rasputin is also curious about Limbo (Ashiya Douman) and how he ended up to which you respond by saying that due to reasoning and fair enough punishment.

**Rasputin:**

> Alright, let’s just say I didn’t hear that. Let us commence the strategy meeting, ladies and gentlemen.  
>   
> You’re trying to defeat this…girl who’s become Xochitonal, the “Underworld Sentinel”, right?  
>   
> I can lend a bit of advice. Even then, I do have some experience in exorcizing spirits.

**Mashu:**

> Did you say…exorcism, Father Kotomine?

**Rasputin:**

> Indeed. That Servant is possessed by an evil spirit. Needless to say, it’s the mask.  
>   
> It’s said to be the calavera (skull) in Mexico. I can sense the power of a mighty Divine Spirit.  
>   
> The Servant should return to normal if we remove the mask. Though I cannot guarantee **they’ll go back to their original state.**

**Nemo Marine:**

> What? What do you mean?

![](https://i.redd.it/4rpzsg0i2r8a1.png)

**Tepeu:**

> Those who’ve become the “Underworld Sentinel” are enemies who are eternally bound to the underworld.  
>   
> A test for the living to leave the underworld and for the dead to descend deeper into the underworld, but Sentinels are never allowed to leave the underworld, right?  
>   
> Is this a new decree born from the God of Pan-Human History?

**Rasputin:**

> Yes. You are clever, Tepeu. Indeed, it was decided by a God.  
>   
> However, this is also our chance. The underworld is overwritten by Pan-Human History mythology that has become a Lostbelt and not a Lostbelt.  
>   
> Mashu-kun. Can you measure the Human Order Foundation Value with that machine?

**Mashu:**

> I can measure it, but…no…the Human Order Foundation Value is fluctuating…?  
>   
> How could this be…

![](https://i.redd.it/d0mr1xsk2r8a1.png)

**Rasputin:**

> It is considered a Compiled Event and a Pruned Event.  
>   
> Another way to think about it is that all past, present and future are accepted.  
>   
> As long as you can supply Heroic Spirits tied to Chaldea with resources (mana), then you can summon as many Servants as you’d like here.  
>   
> Even temporarily pull “what-if” relationships as well.

> It means that Fujimaru can summon a Heroic Spirit A-type whom he wasn’t aware of, as long as he can summon B-type whom he knew.  
>   
> Although, there can be a limit of several for one mage. It’s impossible for an infinite.  
>   
> However, you can summon an army of a hundred Servants with the Storm Border’s engines.  
>   
> Similar to what you did in Tunguska.

**Mashu:**

> E-even you knew that?

**Rasputin:**

> Oh, I took a gamble with Tunguska. I assumed that would be your final tactic.

> Mashu-kun, you’re gullibly honest. If only Kadoc was more like you.

**Rasputin:**

**Fujimaru Ritsuka:**

# Arrow 1

Marine complains about how hot it’s become after the first Underworld and feels like going back to play with Protea, but Marine’s joking of course, since Marine is our bodyguard. Mashu comments on how Tepeu and Nemo Marine have become like father and son bonding with each other.

U-Olga Marie says that in human age, Tepeu would be 90 years old. Mashu thinks that this would make Tepeu a grandfather rather than an actual father and feels bad for taking an elderly on a journey like this. However, Tepeu’s bodily functions don’t wither until their death. Tepeu asks if it was alright to leave Kingprotea behind like that.

![](https://i.redd.it/6o6467qkux8a1.png)

A flashback to a little while ago. Mashu and U-Olga Marie tell Kingprotea that this is normal for them to have trouble midway through something. However, U-Olga Marie asks why they can’t bring along Kingprotea.

**Rasputin:**

> We cannot do that, my Lady.  
>   
> Even though we liberated the mask, Kingprotea still remains the “Underworld Sentinel”.  
>   
> She’ll have to act without a Master like Fujimaru or the Storm Border since she became a “Underworld Sentinel” and has to act within the “Underworld Layers”.

![](https://i.redd.it/a1sy6g0iux8a1.png)

**Kingprotea:**

> Yes. I was summoned by the Storm Border, but I fell down to Mictlan without a contract with Master and a mana link path.  
>   
> I can act even with my big mana furnace…but that weird bat…Camazotz forcibly influenced me. “I’ll grant you strength if you become a Sentinel”.

U-Olga Marie wants Rasputin to do something about Kingprotea being stuck in the Underworld because she wants Protea free and able to join us.

**Rasputin:**

> I cannot do anything. While the wound has been removed, we are talking about the Saint Graph itself.  
>   
> Kingprotea needs to return to her initial state to leave the Underworld.

**Mashu:**

> .! Then we can leave her for now and summon her back via the Border—-

![](https://i.redd.it/ctcp5simux8a1.png)

**Rasputin:**

> If we don’t consider the risks of resummoning, then that could work. Kingprotea is a Divine Spirit Class Servant.  
>   
> The chances of summoning her once more is low. But if we summon her again, she won’t be restricted anymore.  
>   
> However, even though it may be the same Heroic Spirit and body, you’ll never meet the “one in front of you now”.  
>   
> That is the fate of all Servants. Please understand this, U-Olga Marie-sama.

**U-Olga Marie:**

> Why-why is it such an inconvenient system? Who conjured this up?

**Kingprotea:**

> …Fufu. Thank you for feeling bad for me.  
>   
> But, it’ll be okay now.  
>   
> I’m acknowledged at Xochitonal and got sort of an Alter…

> At least, I don’t have a Master in “here (the first Underworld)” and I can keep going by myself.

> So I’ll be waiting for everyone here. If you guys come back here again, I’ll crush everything for you!

![](https://i.redd.it/jrqt0hhqux8a1.png)

Back to the present, you believe that Kingprotea is strong enough to be on her own. Tepeu doesn’t outright reject, but simply keeps it to himself since he has his own opinion on leaving someone behind. Nemo Marine tells Tepeu if he likes her because of her horns, but still knows that Tepeu worries for her. Tepeu rejects such a question since aquatic lifeforms are difficult to sympathize with. While aquatic and flying deinos are rare and see the world in a different view, those on the ground are the exact opposite, that’s why Tepeu worries for her due to differences in size and shape.

![](https://i.redd.it/agblbuxrux8a1.png)

Rasputin asks Mashu about their communication with the Storm Border. Mashu responds that **they haven’t had contact in 48 hours** which prompts Rasputin to tell them that they should stop worrying about Kingprotea and focus on the Storm Border and its crew since the worst may have already happened.

Rasputin alerts the group about the incoming flying insects. He also informs them that they can inflict fever upon contact. Tepeu adds on by stating that it’s the sixth leading cause of death among deinos. **The insects can inject poison through their mouths and it can penetrate through deinos’ bio-waves. Albeit, there’s no damage done, it can “cause pain enough to make them unconscious”.** Rasputin is impressed by South America’s ecosystem and the like.

**Nemo Marine:**

> What are you laughing for\~! What kind of bite gives people pain to the point they die\~\~\~!?  
>   
> Fujimaru, do something! Drive them away, drive them away\~!

After the battle, **Nemo Marine apologizes for not being useful in his role as a scout.** Habetrot tells Marine that he has nothing to apologize for and that it’s just how the world of Mictlan is. We aren’t accustomed to the land yet, there’s poor visibility, the heat and in addition to being close to the sky. Habetrot reassures Nemo Marine that even Mashu’s Ortenaus couldn’t detect the enemies we fought earlier.

You cheer Nemo Marine up by saying that even if Marine wasn’t able to properly scout, Marine helped the group in different ways. Marine, in response, strives to be a treasure hunter in South America.

![](https://i.redd.it/2vhrpf22vx8a1.png)

**Tepeu:**

> Let’s rest a bit before that, Marine. Exploring this jungle at night is dangerous.  
>   
> A coatl (snake) can sneak in fast before we can detect it. We wouldn’t be able to know there’s a cipactli (big alligator) camouflaged until we get very close to it.  
>   
> There were carnivorous insects and berserk deinos lurking nearby.  
>   
> They act and move as long as there is sunlight and sleep at night. That is the invariable principle of Mictlan.

Nemo Marine happily goes to be the watchguard for the night. Mashu says that Nemo Marine doesn’t have to do that since there is a frequency that the insect we fought doesn't like, so they used that to set up an insecticide barrier.

![](https://i.redd.it/6bepeh64vx8a1.png)

**Nemo Marine:**

> Okay! I’ll use my sleeepppping bagggg! I love the comfy feeling\~\~!

![](https://i.redd.it/9ic7xxw6vx8a1.png)

On the other hand, Tepeu is very amazed at the insect repellent technology that we used. U-Olga Marie disagrees because since humanity is always filling a void that doesn’t need to be filled, they suffer the consequences. She uses nuclear fission as an extreme example and how they discharge harmful substances into the environment which can cause harm in the name of obtaining energy. She concludes that the chart of humanity’s engineering is very complicated and for Tepeu to not rate Pan-Human History very highly.

You and Mashu ask U-Olga Marie why she wants to be President of the Earth. U-Olga Marie doesn’t want to answer such a redundant question, but will answer anyway as it is her duty.

The group arrives at a very wide and vast plain. Mashu is shocked that there’d be something like this in Mictlan since she initially thought there was going to just be mountains and jungles.

**Nemo Marine:**

The enemy deinos are increasing by the minute to the point where the group is surrounded. You suggest retreating and going back into the forest. The group does so.

**Tepeu:**

> See?

**Habetrot:**

**Tepeu:**

Tepeu suggests that we go to Chichen Itza since we need permission to go through the deinos and that would take a long time.

**Tepeu:**

**Tepeu:**

Habetrot is astonished and complains about how big it is in comparison to Pan-Human History. She can’t even walk up the steps which means she has to go back into the Black Barrel disappointed that she has to cancel her long-awaited Lostbelt sightseeing.

However, everyone that’s human such as you, Mashu and Rasputin have turned into deinos.

Mashu thanks Rasputin for his clever thinking and you act as if you were a deino. Rasputin says that you won’t attract any unnecessary attention if you were to speak normally, so he suggests just speaking normally.

![](https://i.redd.it/qx105m8b4y8a1.png)

As for U-Olga Marie and Nemo Marine, we rewind a bit in time. A while ago, U-Olga Marie states that she isn’t interested in disguises so she’ll stay in the forest. Rasputin, on the other hand, will go since he is interested in Chichen Itza, although he’ll bring back souvenirs for U-Olga Marie. Marie says that her butler is too free-spirited. Habetrot will be in Spirit Form for the majority of the trip to Chichen Itza.

**Nemo Marine:**

> Really? Then, I’ll stay behind! I don’t want U to be lonely!

![](https://i.redd.it/6jmqshfd4y8a1.png)

Back to the present, Mashu states that we’re here to **authorize passage** so that they can get to the Storm Border. Habetrot asks how many people currently reside in Chichen Itza.

![](https://i.redd.it/hbt3ypwf4y8a1.png)

**Tepeu:**

> Back then when I was here, there were about 2000 people, but due to the Ocelotl hunting deinos, all the deinos scattered around Mictlan came together here.

> From what I can roughly notice, there’s 2400 current residents here.

**Fujimaru Ritsuka:**

> Even when they’re getting together from all over Mictlan…?  
>   
> It only went up by 400?

**Tepeu:**

> The Crypter appeared, built a town of Ocelotl, Mexico City and the Ocelotl murdered more deinos.

> Even if they are born, their survival rate afterwards will be hopeless. Well, Mictlan is coming to an end anyways.

**Mashu:**

> Is that because—-we’re here to cut off the Fantasy Tree?

**Tepeu:**

> Well, that is an ending of sorts.  
>   
> However, do not worry, Mashu, Fujimaru.

> You guys must make decisions solely for your guys’ survival.

![](https://i.redd.it/mwhqi9xc5y8a1.png)

**Rasputin:**

>   
> If it is business, then does the concept of “currency” exist within your guys’ lives?

![](https://i.redd.it/gkcgsoun5y8a1.png)



**Tepeu:**

> Indeed, currency exists. It is an invention of Pan-Human History. We do not need it.  
>   
> We are just laying out what others need. If there is something you want, then feel free to take as much as you’d like.  
>   
> The sole deinos standing behind the stand are there for our protection. The individual difference between deinos is big.  
>   
> One item could favor a deinos while it could be poison for another.

> Deinos who understand that work as consultants in those stands.

**Fujimaru Ritsuka:**

> A perfect supplying system with no bartering…?  
>   
> Why is there no currency involved?

![](https://i.redd.it/al9n3mid5y8a1.png)

**Rasputin:**

> …Deinos and humans are different after all. Humans **lack too many things**.

> It is not just nourishment for us to keep functioning. There is also the “happiness” that suffices our mind.  
>   
> Seeking better happiness than others. Seeking for more things to have than others.  
>   
> It is this type of hunger that compelled humans to invent a method of “efficiently gaining wealth”.  
>   
> Currency is the blood that flows through human society, but with all there is, **we are limited to what we can achieve as individuals** in life.  
>   
> Just like with deinos and their strong physique and carefree existence, **they lack nothing when it comes to survival**.  
>   
> They do not have the notion of “competition”. Everyone is equal and a respected friend here.

![](https://i.redd.it/frccby6k5y8a1.png)

Tepeu states that compared to our world, there is no war or racial differences here. They have a sport named xoqqer which is just a ceremonial competition, but even that is peaceful. Xoqqer is like a priest’s prayer where they express their gratitude for the radiance of the sun and pray for its continuation.

**Rasputin:**

> The continuation of the sun…Mr. Tepeu, here’s my second question.  
>   
> There’s a Central American pyramid…at the heart of this town, is that an altar where the king resides?  
>   
> It looks like a Pan-Human History structure. The only difference being—

**Mashu:**

> There are crystals that extend to the sky from the summit of the altar. Like a jade crystal…

![](https://i.redd.it/koxcz93k4y8a1.png)

**Tepeu:**

> Hohou, there are sun altars that exist in Pan-Human History?  
>   
> The notion of being closer to heaven seems to be never changing.   
>   
> That is the reason the holy ground exists within Chichen Itza. The sun begins and ends here.  
>   
> It is the “Sun Itinerary”.  
>   
> Pan-Human History’s sun is in space and the Earth revolves around it, right?  
>   
> However, there is no space within Mictlan as the sun is within Mictlan.  
>   
> According to everyone (Pan-Human History), our sun in Mictlan is an artificially made condensed sun.  
>   
> The sun starts to move at Chichen Itza, travels to the ninth layer and returns back here.  
>   
> That altar is the sun’s “home”. Upon the sun’s return, it closes the sun, give it vitality and send out again.  
>   
> That is the mechanism of the sun in Mictlan.

Rasputin learns that from that information alone, he deduces that the sun’s gravity is the earth’s surface and is a sun reliant on the laws of Mictlan. Tepeu corrects everyone on one last thing. The pillars are not crystals, but rather, vegetation. Tepeu notes everyone to notice the sparkling resin. It is the Cosmic Tree (not Fantasy Tree) that pierces Mictlan. Tepeu suggests that we can talk to the Dinosaur King if we just go up the altar. Mashu asks if it is really that simple.

![](https://i.redd.it/kj7tfvto4y8a1.png)

**Tepeu:**

> It is. To be honest, I was once a priest of Chichen Itza.  
>   
> Though I ran away from Chichen Itza before the appearance of the Dinosaur King, so I am not acquainted with the King, but I do have a work history…and so-called connections.  
>   
> Also, we never decided upon “territory” and “borders”.   
>   
> Anyone is able to go wherever they want. Just how the sun makes its round trip in the world.

![](https://i.redd.it/82eylgcn4y8a1.png)

The current priest is automatically angry at Tepeu as the group makes its way to the altar. The current deinos priest tells Tepeu to go back to wherever he dwelled and asks if he is here to boast about his disciples.

**Tepeu:**

> Not disciples, but more like teachers. I have learned a lot from them.  
>   
> That being said, Priest Vucub. I am pleased to see you healthy.  
>   
> I’d like to request an audience with the Dinosaur King, would that be alright?

![](https://i.redd.it/1yutyeas4y8a1.png)

**Priest Vucub:**

> That wouldn't be alright…! The King is busy dealing with the Ocelotls.  
>   
> With you being retired, you don’t know this, but the Ocelotl are brutal creatures called humans!  
>   
> The king demonstrated a do-or-die resistance and blocked the great plains in response to the deinos extinction crisis.  
>   
> Chichen Itza is not a place for cowards like you! So hurry up and get out of here!

**Tepeu:**

> Wait, my house should still be in Chichen Itza. I built it myself after all.

**Priest Vucub:**

> That’s not what we’re talking about here! —-Fighters! Fighters, come forth!

![](https://i.redd.it/ssh5y0sf6y8a1.png)

**Priest Vucub:**

> Get these shameless deinos out of here! Audience with the Dinosaur King is forbidden!

![](https://i.redd.it/pxscd1wg6y8a1.png)

**Tepeu:**

> See?

Tepeu says that Vucub hates Tepeu very much like a rotten corn field and has sent assassins after him. Tepeu also forgot to congratulate him on getting to the position of Head Priest. Mashu states that we are going to have to find a different approach to this matter. You suggest to find information in order to find collaborators and meet up with the Dinosaur King that way.

Tepeu says that his house should be relatively safe since it is off the main street. He also wants to invite Nemo Marine and U-Olga Marie over as well and suggests that we all stick together on this.

# Arrow 4

![](https://i.redd.it/xinfetbm8y8a1.png)

Nemo Marine and U-Olga Marie congratulate you on your hard work so far. U-Olga Marie adds that she would also reject anyone with an audience if they didn’t have an appointment. U-Olga Marie wants to wreck havoc on the altar so that the Dinosaur King can come out and talk to them, but Rasputin is highly against that since it’ll cause more problems than solutions.

![](https://i.redd.it/wzv656zq8y8a1.png)

Tepeu takes pride in his home and where it is currently located. Tepeu assures everyone that they’ll sleep fine despite the big size.

![](https://i.redd.it/ui3uy22s8y8a1.png)

![](https://i.redd.it/1yrfy46u8y8a1.png)

However, due to the amount of time Tepeu has been separate from his home in Chichen Itza, weeds have grown forth and Tepeu assumes that the suffering of whoever has a garden has to deal with weed extermination and pest control.

![](https://i.redd.it/359l8j6w8y8a1.png)

After the battle, Mashu, Nemo Marine, you and Rasputin have cleaned Tepeu’s house to make it look brand new once more. Nemo Marine states that he cleans all the oil stains in the engine room normally on the Storm Border while Rasputin states he specializes in cleaning kitchens.

![](https://i.redd.it/aufi3q3y8y8a1.png)

Tepeu states that he has a hard time cleaning with this body structure of his. Naturally deinos don’t really clean up after themselves, but for Tepeu, it bothers him very much that he has to clean regularly. Therefore, he moved (into the cave in early chapters) to forget about the nuisance of cleaning a home.

![](https://i.redd.it/jlfr9znz8y8a1.png)

**Tepeu wants to know about the Chichen Itza of Pan-Human History.** Mashu explains that it was a Mayan city located in South America on the Yucatan Peninsula. **The city continued from 1600 BCE to 900 CE.** Mashu states that before the time period 1600 BCE to 250 CE was considered the Preclassic Period. The Classic Period was from 250 to 900 CE. The Post-Classic Period was from 900 CE to 16th century. Chichen Itza was built by the people of Itza in the Post-Classic Period.

![](https://i.redd.it/nmiwe9l19y8a1.png)

Itza people were considered “outsiders” or descendants of those who escaped the fall of central Maya. They eventually reached a land with a fertile spring cenote and named it Chichen Itza (At the mouth of the well of the Itza). **Kukulkan, the God of Wind and Water, was the name of the God they worshiped in Chichen Itza and the same god the Aztecs would eventually worship, Quetzalcoatl.**

![](https://i.redd.it/akn20fl39y8a1.png)

Tepeu asks how they fell despite being in the blessings of their God. Mashu explains that when the Mayan civilization fell, the gods disappeared and Central America entered the Age of Man. 

Something that’s actually worth noting in this entire lecture. Mashu mentions the name **Hernan Cortes**. Cortes and his Spaniards fought the Aztec kingdom and emerged victorious. This caused the Aztec kingdom to be renamed into Mexico. Nemo Marine says that it is unbelievable that an army of 500 Spaniards eliminated several thousands in the Aztec Kingdom.

![](https://i.redd.it/q1kltnb59y8a1.png)

Nemo Marine tells a story about **how Hernan Cortes was thought to be the second coming of Quetzalcoatl by the Aztecs resulting in them treating Hernan Cortes as a guest from a foreign land.**

![](https://i.redd.it/nd0camxa9y8a1.png)

**Tepeu:**

> Indeed. Guns are the weapons that the Ocelotl are using, right?  
>   
> They are conquerors who arrived from the **outside world**. Oppressing and murdering local tribes with guns.  
>   
> This is the same situation with what’s happened in Mictlan.  
>   
> The Crypter, Daybit, is the reemergence of Hernan Cortes.

Tepeu wants to know more about Tezcalipoca and Quezalcoatl, but it is getting late so they call it a day here.

![](https://i.redd.it/ujt924ja9y8a1.png)

**Rasputin:**

> But before that, I have one last question.  
>   
> Mr. Tepeu. It’s clear that Chichen Itza was not meant for the Deinos.  
>   
> Either way, this lifestyle conforms to the humanity of Pan-Human History.  
>   
> Who built this city? Who is the Deinos’ “Dinosaur King”?

**Tepeu:**

> Well. The Dinosaur King appeared very recently and is unrelated to Chichen Itza.  
>   
> Kukulkan is one who created Chichen Itza.   
>   
> It is stated that the Sun God Kukulkan built this city to govern Mictlan.

It is morning and you have slept well. Tepeu greets everyone, but corrects himself to say “good morning” instead. Tepeu will prepare corn for breakfast today. Nemo Marine comes running over, complimenting how nice it is to sleep so soundly in a safe city like Chichen Itza. Habetrot manifests and says that normally Heroic Spirits can go into spirit form and lie dormant for energy conservation, but Marine can’t do that.

**Nemo Marine:**

U-Olga Marie starts the meeting with projected screens and footage of the city.

![](https://i.redd.it/tm4x8j74zn9a1.png)

**Rasputin:**

> Oh…you remembered a fragment of your powers. Truly astonishing.  
>   
> According to this footage, the only way to the throne is the stairs to the altar.  
>   
> This route is unusable since there are Deinos called “Fighters” guarding the place.  
>   
> Additionally, the Dinosaur King’s private room has been confirmed to be like a villa through the President’s sharp sighted eyes, but there seems to be no confirmation of this Dinosaur King individual.  
>   
> It seems that they are absent.  
>   
> Supposing that if we were to brute force our way through to gain an audience with the Dinosaur King, our chances are slim.

![](https://i.redd.it/cfnohhp6zn9a1.png)

Rasputin mentions that contact with the Dinosaur King by any normal methods will be difficult. Rasputin enlarges a picture of an arena-like picture. Nemo Marine and Tepeu tell you that this is where xoqqer is held and the only form of entertainment they have.

U-Olga Marie took the liberty to scan and survey the deinos’ thoughts. Some of them are as follows, “Xoqqer begins after the next night”, “I’m excited. I’m excited. I wonder who’ll go to the finals”, and  “The winner will be able to talk directly to the King. The experience to be with Kukulkan.”

![](https://i.redd.it/955zo5t7zn9a1.png)

U-Olga Marie suggests participating in this tournament in order to meet with the Dinosaur King. **You need an explanation of what xoqqer is.** Tepeu basically describes xoqqer the same way soccer works in our world. Tepeu wanted to be a xoqqer player when he was young, but had to give up when he grew older.

**Fujimaru Ritsuka:**

> So it’s basically soccerrrr!  
>   
> So it’s basically footballll!

![](https://i.redd.it/88l58c4bzn9a1.png)

Mashu reiterates the objective and adds that we have to get along with strong players so that we can join their team. Rasputin asks Tepeu how a xoqqer match is like and gives out a sample, 2 vs 2 or 4 vs 4. Tepeu answers that it is 11 vs 11. Rasputin tells them that they have a chance to join a pre-existing team if it’s 11 vs 11.

![](https://i.redd.it/6fnk4qvczn9a1.png)

Mashu requests Rasputin to apply the deinos disguise back on. Rasputin took the entire to refine his sacrament so that our deinos disguise will only be seen by deinos and we can look normal. U-Olga Marie asks if we’ll look like deinos to actual deinos and to us, we’ll just look normal and Rasputin says that’ll be the case.

U-Olga Marie suggests that we split up so that the more teams we’re on, the better chance we’ll have to see the Dinosaur King. Therefore, U-Olga Marie will be competing against you for the sake of the objective.

**Rasputin:**

> Then it’ll be Fujimaru and Mashu, My Lady and I, and Mr. Tepeu and Marine.

**Nemo Marine:**

> Okay! We’ll all do our best if it’s football! Watch me find a good team!

**Tepeu:**

> Then let us regroup when the sun is around the fourth layer.

> It is crucial that we confirm the situation as a group.

**Fujimaru Ritsuka:**

> Got it!

You stroll through the town and listen in to what other deinos might be talking about. One deinos is talking about how hot it’s becoming nowadays and if every other species can hold up fine. The second deinos they’re talking to have the opposite idea and focus on the quality of corn. A third deinos in the conversation wants to talk about xoqqer instead of Priest Vucub because his policies have led to the deaths of deinos lately.

The third deinos thanks the Crypter that xoqqer has become more enjoyable and the number of deinos deaths have decreased.

Mashu states that the town is getting busier by the minute and advises you to be careful to not get stepped on. Habetrot is surprised by the many kinds of deinos around here and seems to ask you about dinosaurs. 

![](https://i.redd.it/ii1he2kizn9a1.png)

Mashu instead gives you a brief lecture about dinosaurs, describing the many types of dinosaurs there are like the tyrannosaurus, triceratops, parasaurolophus, pteranodon, etc and also informing us of how they all became extinct. In the end, she’s grateful that she met a dinosaur even if it was in a Lostbelt.

Habetrot just wants to know about the strongest, smartest and best dinosaur there is and the one who does not make an enemy out of. Mashu answers that it would be Deinonychus and goes on a bit describing their features, but unfortunately, there’s not too many of them here.

**Mashu:**

> Actually, Tepeu-san has arranged for us to meet with some noble xoqqer team members.  
>   
> They’re training themselves for tomorrow’s ceremony at the Ceremony Arena.  
>   
> Anyone can freely go into the Ceremony Arena on the weekdays. Let’s head over there quickly!

You head over to the Ceremony Arena and it is packed to the brim with Deinos. Xoqqer players and teams are earnestly preparing for their matches by warming up. Habetrot is very pleased by how close and polite players are to each other.

**Mashu:**

> Hmm, they’re on the red east side, platform 2, Team Death Rolling—

**???:**

> Fuahhahahaha!  
>   
> It’s always nice to see an eager fanboy! Hup!

**???:**

> You’ve come! (Right)

> We are! (Left)

> The absolute gentlemen! The 11 Deinonychus Brothers!

![](https://i.redd.it/1t0wao6kzn9a1.png)

**Mashu & Habetrot:**

> (Dumbfounded)

The middle deinoychus welcomes them and introduces themselves as well as showing off their achievements. They’ve had seven consecutive victories in the Mazatl Cup. The brothers asks if you’re here to watch them, root them on, things like that, but no, you’re here to ask them if your group can be on their team.

The Deinonychus Brothers ask if you’re the group with Tepeu and they also refer to Tepeu as Master (in a teacher kind of reference). The brothers assume that Tepeu sent us out here to get the brothers out of a pinch. 

![](https://i.redd.it/50uuvvbozn9a1.png)

**11 Deinonychus Brother, Right:**

> Get out there on the field (ceremonial field), rookies! Let’s see how well you move—  
>   
> Gotta see those moves! Kyeeeeeeee! We bite, veteran bite!

**Mashu & Habetrot:**

> (Astonished)

After the match, the team is surprised by how well you did and imagines if our group was part of their team. They let you into the group and don't really care about being formal so you can call them the 11 Deinonychus Brothers. However, there aren’t 11 of them in total.

Habetrot materializes and the 11 Deinonychus Brothers are surprised by her (disguised form). They have never seen such a tochtli before. The brothers comment that it looks like a different species, but not an Ocelotl (jaguar) and more like a whimsy and free creature.

**Mashu:**

> We’d like to participate in tomorrow’s xoqqer as substitutes, would that be alright?

![](https://i.redd.it/96zl955qzn9a1.png)

They include you guys as one of the 11 and you’ll be actual team players and not subs for them. Their morale is brimming with hope as they aren’t scared to drop out the first round now that your group is on the team. However, Mashu seems to point out that they have low standards going into the match with words like “participation rewards” and being able to pass the first round but not mentioning about winning the tournament.

Everyone in response looks away as if embarrassed. But it’s clear that they win and play by being reliant on yellow cards. The 11 Deinonychus Brothers tell them that their defenders were plagued with cocoa poisoning and informs them that eating too much cocoa gets you cocoa poisoning.

11 Deinonychus Brother Number 7 knows that you’re trying to cross the great plains, but you won’t be able to see the Dinosaur King because of Priest Vucub. Everyone thinks that Vucub is trying to be in charge of Chichen Itza. This results in deinos leaving or staying for their own reasons.

![](https://i.redd.it/s1zpqbjc0o9a1.png)

11 Deinonychus Brother Number 7 says that they use what we call formations, but they’re ineffective for the most part after Tepeu left them. Tepeu would strategize for each opponent the team went up against. After Tepeu left, the team had to rely on penalties and when the Crypter came, rules had to be revised so that it became only three penalties. Accidents occurred towards the team which made the team have 11 members to 7.

The reason why they still play xoqqer is because it is simply fun for them. Playing the game, running around and laughing with your brothers is what made them continue playing no matter what.

**11 Deinonychus Brother Number 7:**

> In Chichen Itza…No, there weren't any deinos who were an oddball like Tepeu.

Number 6 comes along and tells them that if they’re gonna practice their going to need a Maia ball and a fresh one at that because they believe that if the ball isn’t a fresh ball, then Kukulkan won’t be happy with the individual who has a used ball.

**11 Deinonychus Brother Number 7:**

> Come on, Fujimaru.

![](https://i.redd.it/leww9g9l0o9a1.png)

You ask if there are any other rules out there for xoqqer. Tepeu notes that you need a fresh personal ball like you’ve learned yesterday. The group plans to make a ball for each person and return to training for the upcoming matches.

![](https://i.redd.it/pnttsgum0o9a1.png)

Since Tepeu advises everyone that the jungle is currently dangerous, Nemo Marine goes back to the team. As you, Mashu and Tepeu head into the forest, Tepeu advises that there are many Ocelotl, carnivorous insects and the like around here. Tepeu will procure the resources while you and Mashu take care of the surroundings.

**Habetrot:**

> Mashu, Fujimaru, sorry but we’ve got a problem here.

**Mashu:**

**???:**

Tepeu comes back with materials and asks why we look so intense. We tell about what happened and Tepeu is in disbelief and asks us if we’re eating peyotl. A peyotl is a hairy fruit the size of a human head that causes hallucinations when eaten. Priests love these.

Tepeu suggests the group to go back to finalize their personal ball before the ceremony. Mashu reiterates the objective for us one more time.

**Mashu:**

> This is a mission we can’t fail. Let’s stay focused, Master.

Nemo Marine’s opinion is that it’s sweet but hot/spicy. Tepeu has crafted everyone who is participating, their own personal ball for tomorrow’s ceremony. Tepeu and Mashu advise everyone to prepare for tomorrow. Tonight, Mashu and Nemo Marine will clean up the place before resting up.

![](https://i.redd.it/izdvwktv1o9a1.png)

You go out and see what U-Olga Marie is doing. U-Olga Marie tells you that she’s just watching the deinos live their lives as they please. U-Olga Marie notices the Storm Border far in the distance but can’t make out anything else. You want to know if everyone’s okay.

![](https://i.redd.it/onh0qcsm2o9a1.png)

**U-Olga Marie:**

Tepeu and Habetrot discuss their team formation. Tepeu states that their team was formed hastily only if everyone else couldn’t formulate a team in time. You hear running and you see U-Olga Marie sprint over to you.

U-Olga Marie boastfully brags and is proud that she experienced a dream last night. She also brags about how strong she was and how she defeated those Grand Servants. Mashu plays along, but Marie tells Mashu that she’s telling the truth.

11 Deinonychus Brother Left states that there’s no way that they’ll lose with all the techniques that they’ve learned over the course of their training and want to try them out quickly. The Middle Brother tells them to relax and play with a cool mind so that they don’t play foolishly.

The 11 Deinonychus Brothers are dedicated to fulfilling your group’s wishes because they consider you, Mashu and Habetrot as siblings within the team.

U-Olga Marie comes in and says that they’ll be the one winning. Two other big deinos come in behind her and Mashu is surprised that U-Olga Marie was able to form a team.

U-Olga Marie is very excited to play even though we have the same objective. U-Olga Marie warns us that we should leave before we get hurt on the field. Mashu states that their team is the Death Rolling, and dictates that the match will be an intense one with the winner coming out on top at the last second.

You come back after your meeting with Daybit. You decide to not tell Mashu until the time is right. Priest Vucub announces that the tournament is now at the finals with the sun about to set on the throne of Chichen Itza. Vucub hopes that, with the finals afoot, Kukulkan will reveal himself to the audience and for a spectacular game. 

When Priest Vucub is about to announce the two teams for the final match, an unprecedented turn of event occurs. Tepeu comes in and says that Tepeu and Marine’s team have withdrawn or forfeit. You and Nemo Marine are shocked by this revelation. Tepeu’s reasoning is that since it’s our team versus their team, there’s no point in continuing because they’ll achieve an audience with the Dinosaur King regardless of who wins. Nemo Marine accepts this and go thanks his teammates.

U-Olga Marie asks about that look on your face, and you respond that she got angry for Nemo Marine’s sake. U-Olga Marie refutes and says that Tepeu’s answer hurt her horns (she didn’t like what Tepeu said).

Meanwhile, in the tournament, Priest Vucub says that forfeit at the finals is unprecedented, but after discussing it with the king, the forfeit will be allowed and Death Rolling are the victors. Priest Vucub tells the winning team to present themselves.

A 11 Deinonychus Brother tells you and Mashu to go and see the Dinosaur King while the rest relax in the back since they’re satisfied with everything up until now. Priest Vucub asks for your guys’ name and so you tell him your and Mashu’s name, but doesn’t recognize either of you. However, he does recognize your face, but before Vucub could spit it out, the Dinosaur King interrupts.

![](https://i.redd.it/tetet1fus9aa1.png)

**Dinosaur King:**

**Mashu:**

> —Master!

![](https://i.redd.it/311dz0gvs9aa1.png)

Mashu blocks the attack and the disguises of you, Mashu, Rasputin and U-Olga Marie come to an end and reveal themselves. Priest Vucub finds this unacceptable and brings out a Fighter Wak Chan. Mashu asks you for orders. You suggest neutralizing him in any way possible.

![End of Chapter 6 Arrow 4](https://i.redd.it/oj5dep5zs9aa1.png)

# Arrow 5

![Chapter 6 Arrow 5](https://i.redd.it/zikzzvekv9aa1.png)

Mashu states that little damage has been done to Fighter Wak Chan and Priest Vucub praises Wak Chan as he is the strongest deinos in all of Mictlan. Vucub allows Wak Chan to eat us (meat), but Wak Chan asks if Vucub is an absolute idiot because Wak Chan knows that meat is something that no deinos comes near.

**Fighter Wak Chan:**

> Anyway, I’ve been wantin’ to quit being a Fighter. I don’t get things like the world and Doctrine of the Sun.  
>   
> Rather, I just wanna meet the most beautiful woman in Mictlan someday, get along with her, become a pair with her, and have her outlive me, Fighter Wak Chan.  
>   
> Isn’t that what being strong is about?

Priest Vucub tells Wak Chan that he’s being absurd. Even if the Dinosaur King would allow something like that, Vucub could never allow something ridiculous to happen. Vucub demands Wak Chan that he’ll have to kill us to keep being a Fighter.

![](https://i.redd.it/cmt1lp9cv9aa1.png)

**Wak Chan:**

> I’m telling you, I don’t wanna be a Fighter anymore. I think, I just found my destiny.

**U-Olga Marie:**

> .? What do you want? What do you have there… Flowers? Poisonous flowers?

**Wak Chan:**

> Hello there, crackling-like young lady! I knew that you were the one for me when you hit me with your lighting!  
>   
> Your horns look very pretty! After this battle is over, let’s get marrieddd!

![](https://i.redd.it/wy0b2d7dv9aa1.png)

**U-Olga Marie:**

> .?

**Wak Chan:**

> “?” is not an answer. Marriage. Do you understand? Me. And you.

**U-Olga Marie:**

> Ah, I get it. You’re space debris?

![](https://i.redd.it/rdpn6p9ev9aa1.png)

**Wak Chan:**

> Not even, I’m Wak Chan! Are you a woman who’s pretty, but slow!?

**U-Olga Marie:**

> Huh?

![](https://i.redd.it/p199fccgv9aa1.png)

Priest Vucub cannot believe what he is seeing, so he thinks that Wak Chan has been injured with poisonous bullets. Vucub demands for reinforcements to be brought here. The Dinosaur King is very pleased and amused by this and compares this to the reemergence of Quetzalcoatl. The Dinosaur King reveals his true form as well.

![](https://i.redd.it/e9tkuihhv9aa1.png)

**Dinosaur King:**

> Silence! Fighter reinforcements are not needed! These people are not Ocelotl!  
>   
> They are lifeforms called humans who came here riding the “flying rock”!  
>   
> They are lifeforms who are somewhat clever, and mean no harm to the deinos!

The audience seems to question it, but since it is the King’s words, then they are led to believe that it’s true. Mashu recognizes the Dinosaur King as the person whom they saw yesterday in the jungle.

![](https://i.redd.it/c9vdz83iv9aa1.png)

**Dinosaur King:**

> Hm? Oh, you’re the ones whom I saw yesterday in the jungle.  
>   
> I thought you were weird looking Ocelotl, but I guess that’s not the case. So you guys are Chaldea, huh.  
>   
> Then there’s only one reason why you want to cross the great plains. To head to the “flying rock’s” descent spot, right?  
>   
> …Well, I guess. I’ll allow that.  
>   
> Going to save your comrades is a justifiable reason. I’m not that rotten to criticize you about that.  
>   
> You displayed some interesting matches after all. Also, I’ll forget the disguise incident.

Priest Vucub tells the Dinosaur King that the “flying rock” is a symbol of arrogance and sinister. Vucub suggests that they’d be considered as villains and tells him to not overlook this. The Dinosaur King agrees that they are here to the end of Mictlan, so it'd be simple to just kill them, but…

**Dinosaur King:**

> Hey, you. Fujimaru.  
>   
> I know you have that. Take it out of your pocket and show me.

**Fujimaru Ritsuka:**

> My pocket…?  
>   
> That reminds me…I do have this…

![](https://i.redd.it/m25fflfxu9aa1.png)

**Dinosaur King:**

> There you go. You’re in the middle of your trials. It’s bothersome and a waste of time to deal with him honestly.  
>   
> Understand that, Vucub. He was my guest even before the xoqqer tournament. This isn’t something you can decide upon.  
>   
> Or are you defying me? Alright. I became the Deinos king recently.  
>   
> If you want to claim Chichen Itza in those hands of yours, then come kill me in my slumber.

**Priest Vucub:**

> I…I would never…since the Dinosaur King was appointed by Kukulkan…

**Dinosaur King:**

> Right. Then back down. Clean up the ritual site.  
>   
> Let us talk somewhere else, Fujimaru. The deinos are listening here.  
>   
> Let me hear your guys’ story not as the Deinos King, but **as the Lostbelt King**.  
>   
> …Well, I haven’t introduced myself. It’s unfair that you never got to hear my name, but I knew you all already.  
>   
> Be grateful and listen. My name is Tezcatlipoca. The War God, Tezcatlipoca.  
>   
> **I am the Dinosaur King in Pan-Human History and the God who rules Central America.**

![](https://i.redd.it/p9luasimv9aa1.png)

As the group waits for Tezcatlipoca to arrive at the altar, Nemo Marine asks why he’s not an evil god and why he became the Dinosaur King here. Rasputin clears up any misunderstanding about Tezcatlipoca.

![](https://i.redd.it/xk7gm17ov9aa1.png)

**Rasputin:**

> I’ve said this before, but Tezcatlipoca is not an evil god.  
>   
> He is the God of relentless war. A jaguar personification that lurks in the jungle.  
>   
> He is a dreadful God who steals and sacrifices human hearts.  
>   
> Those who live outside Central America deem him as “evil”.  
>   
> Those in South America at that time deemed it as necessary.  
>   
> The largest and primary misunderstanding that led Tezcatlipoca to be an “evil god” was his confrontation with Quetzalcoatl.  
>   
> Quetzalcoatl who flourished Central America and ruled the country as the king of men, and was considered an undeniable good God.  
>   
> Tezcatlipoca is often misunderstood as an “evil god” because of his rivalry with Quetzalcoatl.  
>   
> Both Gods are “good gods”. Although—-  
>   
> Whether they are evenly matched as Divine Spirits is something I cannot say.

![](https://i.redd.it/7eypvstpv9aa1.png)

Tezcatlipoca arrives at the altar and questions our purpose here. U-Olga Marie states that they’re here to sever the Fantasy Tree and locate ORT. Tezcatlipoca is surprised that Marie is helping Chaldea and asks why. Marie explains that she’s come here to rule Earth, but **can’t** if the planet is already a blank slate. Tezcatlipoca can understand that she helped because their objectives aligned, but wouldn’t if she helped because of compassion and the like.

![](https://i.redd.it/mp98smgsv9aa1.png)

Tezcatlipoca asks why Tepeu is there with the group. Tepeu responds that he wants to learn about Pan-Human History. Tezcatlipoca is angered and tells him that he’ll be disappointed and die when he knows everything.

**Fujimaru Ritsuka:**

> Are you really the “Lostbelt King”?

![](https://i.redd.it/gua52inuv9aa1.png)

**Dinosaur King:**

> Hm… Hmmm….  
>   
> To be precise, no I am not. I am a representative of the “Lostbelt Queen”.  
>   
> “If you don’t want to be killed, then govern Chichen Itza in my place.”  
>   
> I was threatened into doing this a year ago. I undertook it cause I had nothing else better to do.  
>   
> That being said, I only care about protecting Chichen Itza.

![](https://i.redd.it/4n7bi2lwv9aa1.png)

Tezcatlipoca knows that we have no business and tells us to stop wasting time and get out of Chichen Itza. Mashu asks if Tezcatlipoca can assist the group with their objective, but he refuses to be with a bunch of monkeys and wants to be with dinosaurs because they’re the strongest lifeforms on the planet.

**Mashu:**

> What was that?

**Dinosaur King:**

> You don’t need to respond to every single thing. Are you a comedian?  
>   
> I told you to do whatever you want.  
>   
> In any case, you people can’t make this Lostbelt disappear. So there’s no reason for a confrontation.  
>   
> If you still have business here, then quickly finish it and get out.  
>   
> You people have “no” reason to overstay here.

You decide to cross the great plains and head to the Storm Border. Tezcatlipoca says that he’ll get the group a porter to cross the plains quicker. Tepeu asks why he’s helping us even though he said that he won’t help. Tezcatlipoca states that this is the minimum reward for the xoqqer champions.

**Dinosaur King:**

> You mentioned the Storm Border, right? Don’t expect to reconnect with your comrades. It’s too late for you.  
>   
> You entered another country in a battleship. Whatever your reasons may be, this is war.  
>   
> And in war, the Ocelotl take prisoners. They kill enemies who’ve trespassed onto their territory.  
>   
> The ship made a crash landing 5 days ago. If I were the Ocelotl, I would finish the job (dispose of them) on the first day.

## Fragment (I)

![Fragment \(I\)](https://i.redd.it/5dndp5zq7jaa1.png)

# ~4 days ago~

![](https://i.redd.it/gehtfj8r8jaa1.png)

Nemo Engineer comes on the transmission telling everyone that there weren't any malfunctions or explosions happening recently. Da Vinci asks Nemo Nurse if anyone needs tending to after the crash emergency landing. Nemo Nurse reports that everyone is fine and that Fujimaru and Mashu’s vitals are still fine after the incident.

![](https://i.redd.it/ri9e9c5t8jaa1.png)

Da Vinci states that communication is possible in this Lostbelt, but Kadoc reports that the computer room does not have enough electricity for that, and Triton Engine and the emergency electricity has burnt out. They only have **6 minutes to communicate anything to Mashu and Fujimaru before the electricity is out**.

Defense barriers have not been applied since the crash landing. Goredolf states that Kadoc and Nitocris will be their defense for the time being. Kadoc asks about where Nemo is since the Nemo Series is still around.

![](https://i.redd.it/vvu3c9wv8jaa1.png)

Muniere alerts everyone that he’s found Nemo in a cryo-frozen state. Sion states that Nemo did that as a defense mechanism to save everyone. **She also explains that as long as Nemo’s Saint Graph is still intact, the Storm Border will also maintain its structure since Nemo is also the Storm Border itself. That’s also how everyone survived; because he maximized his priority to preserve his own Saint Graph.** Goredolf asks if the Storm Border’s damage was instead…

![](https://i.redd.it/fs6euy0y8jaa1.png)

**Sion:**

> **He took the hit instead of the ship**. And he is still being damaged currently.  
>   
> Originally, his Saint Graph and the Border should have smashed into bits simultaneously, but Captain didn’t allow that to happen before the Border made a forced landing.  
>   
> That is why he froze himself to protect the integrity of the Border.  
>   
> He’s not thawing because he lost his consciousness.  
>   
> Even though he’s unconscious, he’s still taking damage from the Border.

Everyone falls silent and Kadoc proposes to fix the Storm Border so that Nemo can regain consciousness.

**Sion:**

> Captain’s Saint Graph has been smashed up.  
>   
> Since he froze himself before all of this, his appearance still “remains”.  
>   
> If you tried to restore a person who died in an explosion to their “original appearance”, you’d still end up with a corpse.  
>   
> Heroic spirits are not any different.  
>   
> Repairing the Border does not reverse the damage that was inflicted onto his soul.  
>   
> That’s why—

![](https://i.redd.it/mtjzmtsz8jaa1.png)

**Nemo Baker:**

> No, it’s alright! Don’t look so gloomy everyone!  
>   
> The Captain will come back no matter how hurt he is! After all, he’s the indomitable captain!  
>   
> If we can repair the Storm Border, he’ll immediately open his eyes and put on his hat.  
>   
> We’re still on a journey! We also have our prized parfaits left!  
>   
> Alright? How about we do everything we can do now?  
>   
> If we slack off, Captain will scold all of us later.

![](https://i.redd.it/lgopuvvr7jaa1.png)

![](https://i.redd.it/w24odi8s7jaa1.png)

Everyone is very uplifted by Baker’s speech and is compelled to pinch in to do whatever can be done right now. Muniere is concerned that there’s only a minute left on any communication they can get out, but Sion is already on it. Nitocris gets the wrong impression for mummifying him then resurrecting him which Kadoc scolds her for.

![](https://i.redd.it/u8kng5ks7jaa1.png)

**???:**

> To think a ship would fall from the sky like that. As expected of Lostbelts. Only the strangest of things happen in them.

The person introduces himself as the Arms Dealer and wants the Storm Border. He’d be willing to pay any price for that. Muniere firmly states that the Border is not for sale. The Arms Deal is disappointed and shoots his gun.

![](https://i.redd.it/sr9lyma39jaa1.png)

**Arms Dealer:**

> If it’s not for sale, then I’ll forcibly take it myself. It fell into my country to begin with.

Goredolf orders Nemo Nurse to treat him immediately. On the other hand, the Arms Dealer goes on about his interest in guns.

**Kadoc:**

> Bastard—

**Arms Dealer:**

> Izcalli.

![](https://i.redd.it/595vv73t7jaa1.png)

![](https://i.redd.it/gti1iwrt7jaa1.png)

Da Vinci notices that they were surrounded before they could notice them. The Young Man called Izcalli arrives to ask his God (the Arms Dealer) for orders. The Arms Dealer tells them to show him what Izcalli can do after a year in this place.

**Nitocris:**

> Kadoc Zelupus! Right now, you understand what needs to be done!

![](https://i.redd.it/67g1bxei9jaa1.png)

**Kadoc:**

> I know, let’s do this, Nitocris! We’re outnumbered, so let’s wipe them all with a single Noble Phantasm!

![](https://i.redd.it/djbwwlnk9jaa1.png)

**Izcalli:**

> Tch, so this is a Servant, huh…! You ghosts who cling onto Pan-Human History should know your place…!

**Nitocris:**

> Modern weapons and the like are nothing to me! Come fight me again when you’re prepared to face my spirits once more!

**Kadoc:**

> Alright, somehow we managed…!  
>   
> I was worried that I wasn’t able to fight with a Servant whom I had no connection or knowledge of, but you’re awesome, Queen Nitocris!  
>   
> As expected of an ancient Egyptian pharaoh! Your magecraft abilities surpasses even modern Servants!  
>   
> (Hm? Why do I feel so cold?)

Nitocris tells them to kneel and beg for forgiveness. Izcalli feels insulted by this and the Arms Dealer asks what Izcalli will do next. Izcalli responds by saying that he was getting a feel for what it was like to fight a Servant, and that she’ll end her here.

Nitocris continues to downplay their strength and tactics. Izcalli is agitated by this.

Izcalli:

> Remember this. I am Izcalli. I will become the God Tezcatlipoca soon and I am the Ocelotl King!

Nitocris introduces herself as well, but an unknown voice tells her that she’s foolish for telling her status as an individual, but not her own strength. This unknown voice wants to test if Nitocris’s status is equivalent to her strength.

**???:**

> Tlaloc. I am the God of Rain, Tlaloc.

**Tlaloc:**

> Our time will be short, but burn my name into your head. I am fond of every second I get feared and respected.

Izcalli is pleased by her appearance here, but Kadoc is afraid that a Servant like her is here. The entire area starts raining.

![](https://i.redd.it/e7zd94mn9jaa1.png)

**Tlaloc:**

> Now, die. I’m sure you didn’t do much as a Queen.

![](https://i.redd.it/q7r2tn4p9jaa1.png)

**Nitocris:**

> Ah—----.........

**Tlaloc:**

> You were nothing. I suppose there was nothing good about a country that made mummies.

**Nitocris:**

> You’d rather….insult me…than…finish me…off?

**Tlaloc:**

> I’m sure you can’t heal from those injuries. Suffer long and hard before you die.

**Arms Dealer:**

> Huh. You’re not going to take her heart. What a waste. I’ll do it then.

**Tlaloc:**

> Brother. I think there is no need to touch the blood of other mythologies.

**Arms Dealer:**

> Huh?  
>   
> Did you just warn me?  
>   
> A lowly city god? A Servant summoned by me?

![](https://i.redd.it/tulod4wr9jaa1.png)

Tlaloc defends herself by saying that she was being considerate of Tezcalipoca’s vessel. Tezcatlipoca recalls his time eating Indian corpses made him very ill, so he considers it good advice and praises Tlaloc for being a loyal sister. Tezcatlipoca proceeds to shoot her, making Tlaloc faint, causing the rain to stop. Izcalli asks why Tezcatlipoca shot her.

**Tezcatlipoca:**

> My younger sister is no exception.  
>   
> There is hierarchy even in families, and even in good counsel, one who prevents a King’s actions must offer up their lives.  
>   
> That is how it’s all preserved. A king is a being that transcends good and evil.  
>   
> Engrave that into your heart, Izcalli. That is, if you want remain a person (a king) and a God

Izcalli tells Tezcatlipoca that he can do it. Tezcatlipoca orders them that they’re leaving. Izcalli questions the people of the ship.

**Tezcatlipoca:**

> Engineers are the very core of this ship.  
>   
> Those three are the foundation of this ship and…ah, as well as the Servant laying there.  
>   
> Take those four. Kill the rest. There’s no reason to keep them alive if they have no value.  
>   
> The Intermission ends with many guns being fired.

# Arrow 1

You believe that you can make it to the Storm Border with everybody still alive. Wak Chan is very concerned if you’re uncomfortable with going this fast. Mashu responds that they’re fine with this and Wak Chan praises them for being able to handle this speed.

![](https://i.redd.it/1srq32b5l3ba1.png)

U-Olga Marie asks if Nemo Marine wants to ride with her, but Nemo Marine says that he’s fine. Tepeu apologizes for not being as big as Wak Chan, but even Wak Chan says that he’s enjoying this as well.

**Wak Chan:**

> (It’s a darn shame that my beloved Olga won’t ride me!)  
>   
> I’m guessing our destination is past the great plains and into the jungle before the second Underworld.

![](https://i.redd.it/g9jjjyc6l3ba1.png)

Wak Chan why they’re in a rush. Mashu explains that their comrades might be attacked. U-Olga Marie sees signs of life that exceed 12 people, and becomes skeptical. U-Olga Marie proposes to go ahead of them, but Fujimaru refuses that notion.

You reach the destination.

**Tepeu:**

> Marine? Why are you over there?

This unknown enemy (who is Izcalli, but has yet to reveal his name to everyone) has taken Nemo Marine hostage. He demands that Marine shut his mouth before he gets killed just like the people he just killed on the ship. The enemy also assumes that he can use Marine has a torture mechanism for the Master.

Everyone falls silent. Izcalli introduces himself.

**Izcalli:**

> What’s your name, Master? Tell me. I’ll hear it before I kill you.  
>   
> I shall engrave it into Mictlan’s history as pitiful Pan-Human History’s last remaining record.

Nemo Marine watches the group fight for their survival and for the safety of Marine.

**Izcalli:**

Mashu says that she can still fight. Nemo Marine in the background knew that she could keep on fighting.

**U-Olga Marie:**

**Nemo Marine:**

# Arrow 3

![Chapter 7 Arrow 3](https://i.redd.it/qdev2egwl3ba1.png)

We flashback to the past to when Nemo Marine wanted to keep U-Olga Marie company. Nemo Marine skillfully builds a cottage for the group and U-Olga Marie compliments Nemo Marine’s hard work. Marie asks if Marine stayed to keep an eye on her, but Marine asks her if she’d wanted Marine to not be here to which Marie says he’s more useful here building the cottage.

Nemo Marine teaches U-Olga Marie about all the things that Marines do on a daily basis and asks if she wants to take a bath or do other things. Marie, however, doesn’t understand baths. Marine tells her that taking baths is to avoid being dirty, but since U-Olga Marie is different she doesn’t have to take one.

![](https://i.redd.it/kwllrjwxl3ba1.png)

U-Olga Marie wants to know about what Fujimaru said about Marine being one of many. Nemo Marine explains that they’re copies of Nemo, with him being the original. Along with Nurse, Professor, Baker and the others, that makes 24 people in total. **Nemo Marine explains that he’s the only one here because he was tasked to tag along with Fujimaru.**

Nemo Marine says that **no one can grow stronger or weaker.** If Marine A dies, then Marine B can sub in and if B dies then C can sub in. U-Olga Marie notes that Marine acts the same, but **Nemo Marine corrects her by saying that when they work together, they act the same to avoid having different opinions, but there are little differences between them.** For instance, Nemo Marine that’s here and now is a crybaby.

**Nemo Marine:**

> But now that I don’t need to match the other Marine, I can be my true self.  
>   
> It’s a bit embarrassing to act like “it’s just me”.

![](https://i.redd.it/btc7cpwyl3ba1.png)

**U-Olga Marie:**

> I’m relieved to hear that you’re a copy.  
>   
> Mictlan must have been tough on your body, but with your original, Captain Nemo, then you’ll be able to be revived.  
>   
> I think that’s an outstanding survival ability.

![](https://i.redd.it/2qz5beh0m3ba1.png)

**Nemo Marine:**

> Yep. It is. That’s why I’m fine being weak.  
>   
> Even if I vanish, there’s other Marines and everyone won’t forget me☆

**U-Olga Marie:**

> (----That color—he just lied—-)

Nemo Marine whines that he wishes he could fight like his Captain.

**U-Olga Marie:**

> Servants vary. Though I’m not knowledgeable. But you’re special in a lot of areas.  
>   
> Next time we fight, why don’t you and Tepeu hide together. After all, I’m fine with that. Fighting, that is.

**Nemo Marine:**

> Right, we’re friends who’ll save the Earth\~! Again, I can’t thank you enough for protecting me, President. I want to help you to return the favor.

U-Olga Marie is happy to hear this, but asks if he’s alright with her handling everything else that he can’t do.

![](https://i.redd.it/q1z8fcq1m3ba1.png)

**Nemo Marine:**

> U, I think you’re scary, quick-tempered, and mean, but you have a sense of responsibility which makes you an amazing person.  
>   
> “I don’t like doing everything around here, but I won’t run from what I can and should do.”  
>   
> That’s the kind of person I like. You’re amazing. That’s why I’m happy to be here with you\~.  
>   
> I want to be just like you, U☆ Even though we can’t grow!

**U-Olga Marie:**

> …Right. Then why don’t you work hard on what you do well in? If anything happens, I’ll follow up on it.

![](https://i.redd.it/ukt58tg2m3ba1.png)

**Nemo Marine:**

> Alright! I can’t fight, but I’ve become huge burden soon—-  
>   
> So I’ll keep up with everyone! Support me on the way, alright, Olga Marie!

**Izcalli:**

> Are you not angry? If so, it’s misdirected. Seems like you lot are still wrong.

**Fujimaru Ritsuka:**

> —About what.

![](https://i.redd.it/0ene0by6m3ba1.png)

**Izcalli:**

> About your guys’ grief and anger about your friend’s death.

> We Ocelotl are different.  
>   
> Death for us is a natural thing. Death for humans is a natural thing as well. If you didn’t think that way, then we wouldn’t be able to kill each other.  
>   
> **We are allowed to kill because all life is equivalent.**

**Rasputin:**

> ….Oh. Then, do you people not mourn your friend’s death?

**Izcalli:**

> Naturally. **If we sympathize with our brethren, then we cannot wage war.**  
>   
> You lot in Pan-Human History mourn your comrade’s death. As if it were natural. As if it were a salvation.  
>   
> With that kind of intelligence, **you’d think that about the enemy side**, and it'd be a reason to not be able to take lives.  
>

> But that’s the reality. You repulsive humans of Pan-Human History.  
>   
> You kill while possessing imagination. You steal as you respect life.  
>   
> What a contradiction. Before the basis of good and evil, you lot are all flawed.

Izcalli continues to boast that they are different from Pan-Human History. They only respond to their Tezcatlipoca’s emotions like being joyful with him, trembling when he is angry and the like.

![](https://i.redd.it/i0dlg4u8m3ba1.png)

**Izcalli:**

> No matter how many enemies or brethren die, the emotion of fury and grief is for our God to bear on his back.

> That is how war is justifiable. If it weren’t, then human life would be too hideous.

**Mashu:**

> …… Even if you say that, you—

**U-Olga Marie:**

> Absurd. Is boasting the only thing you can do, human?  
>   
> Then die! As you wish, die at my (God’s) hand!

**Izcalli:**

> What the…!?

U-Olga Marie annihilates most of the Ocelotl and pushes back Izcalli with her thunder.

**Izcalli:**

> Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!?

# Arrow 4

![Chapter 7 Arrow 4](https://i.redd.it/o23vb4b5n3ba1.png)

Everyone gazes upon the horrifying scenery. Rasputin states that it was unfortunate that Izcalli came in and striked when Chaldea were at their lowest point. Tepeu states that he should’ve been the one to die instead of Nemo Marine. Rasputin states that Tepeu’s fighting capabilities are equivalent to a Servant while Nemo Marine didn’t have anything to defend himself with. In war, it is an effective tactic to strike combat supporters who have low combat power.

![](https://i.redd.it/oefa3848n3ba1.png)

**Nemo Marine A:**

> Ah! Fujimaru and Mashu! Yahoooo! Welcome backkkkkk!

![](https://i.redd.it/auash39zo3ba1.png)

**Tepeu:**

> \-----------

**Nemo Marine B:**

> It’s really them. They have dinosaurs with them, but I don’t mind it! Commander Goredolf! Commander Goredolffff!



![](https://i.redd.it/al0f26n9n3ba1.png)

**Goredolf:**

> Hey, you’re too loud, be quiet! The Ocelotls might attack again—-  
>   
> Oooo! Oooooooooooh! You’re safe—You guys are safe!

**Mashu:**

> Director Goredolf? Does that mean everyone’s safe?

Goredolf explains that this horrifying scene is just magecraft camouflage. They were about to be shot to death, but thanks to their luck, wit and virtue. The rest of them hid themselves in the hanger. Everyday, Ocelotl would attack them until Marine heard the lightning, came out and saw it was the group.

Fujimaru and Mashu express their relief and worry for the remaining staff that were here.

**???:**

> Of course, this is someone who saved everyone from being surrounded by Ocelotl.  
>   
> An unknown beautiful woman who solely saw the crisis of the Human Order and manifested in this Lostbelt, ran through the jungle with her prideful motorcycle and defeated the Ocelotl in one sweep with a special service of unique quality bullets—---

![](https://i.redd.it/v3thpenbn3ba1.png)

**Koyanskaya:**

> Indeed. It was I, Tamamovitch Koyanskaya, at your service♡

![](https://i.redd.it/p086gxa0p3ba1.png)

We roll back to the end of the Intermission (I) where Goredolf is about to be gunned down by the Ocelotl.

Goredolf, as a last resort, tries to attempt negotiation and states his business here. Izcalli likes Goredolf purely because Goredolf still wants to do something after everything has been taken from him. Goredolf wants to negotiate without being at gunpoint.

**Izcalli:**

> Yet, a blond haired foreigner arrived from the outside. Die without knowing Mictlan (our world).

Just as Goredolf is about to die, Koyanskaya saves him with her NFF services by defeating the Ocelotl.

![](https://i.redd.it/a82x1v41p3ba1.png)

**Koyanskaya:**

> Yes, it’s been awhile, your Excellency♡  
>   
> Koyanskaya of Light, here to do business with the endangered Chaldea☆

![](https://i.redd.it/9k3wmiw6p3ba1.png)

Izcalli orders the Ocelotl to kill Goredolf and then Koyanskaya. Koyanskaya uses a smoke grenade to conceal the staff members and orders them to ask questions later and hide in the Border for the time being.

![](https://i.redd.it/iqt68b96p3ba1.png)

**Koyanskaya:**

> …Though I can’t say this is a perfect rescue since I didn’t save every member…  
>   
> I will not have any more losses. As a representative of NFF Services, I will guarantee everyone’s safety.

![](https://i.redd.it/hip7v0jfn3ba1.png)

We cut back to the present and Goredolf asks how she was summoned. Koyanskaya recalls her statement, “No matter how trivial or small it may be, I will return the favor by helping you” and states that she didn’t become a Servant just to gain some cash for free.

![](https://i.redd.it/30lc7x73p3ba1.png)

Koyanskaya reveals that the catalyst for her summoning was Goredolf’s concealed lipstick that he still had on around Lostbelt 3. Goredolf’s reasoning is that the lipstick would become an item that would make him nostalgic about the journey he went on.

Rasputin and U-Olga Marie reveal themselves to Goredolf. Goredolf is shocked by their appearance here, but he doesn’t know the context of the situation.

![](https://i.redd.it/xcmyhripo3ba1.png)

A short while ago, in the Storm Border, specifically, in the hanger, Goredolf gets briefed on the situation that U-Olga Marie has amnesia and Rasputin merely followed along because of Marie’s orders. Back to the present, Goredolf gets informed of their journey to the Storm Border, but is too focused on not saying “Foreign God”.

![](https://i.redd.it/1m9jvn3ro3ba1.png)

**Goredolf:**

> Here’s the situation on our end. The Storm Border is severely damaged.  
>   
> Da Vinci, Sion, Kadoc and Captain Nemo were taken by an unknown armed group.  
>   
> Currently, we have 9 Chaldea staff members including me, regarding the Nemo Series who’re functioning on their own, we have 11 Marine, Nurse, Bakery, Professor, and Engineer which makes 15 people, along with Koyanskaya and Nitocris who is recovery from being on the verge of death.  
>   
> We have 26 members in total.  
>   
> Up until now, we’ve been confined at the stern of the Border with no access to the Control or Medical Room, but we can safely use it thanks to your guys’ arrival.  
>   
> But we cannot use it due to a shortage of electricity.

![](https://i.redd.it/nhkm53vso3ba1.png)

U-Olga Marie counts it as 12 members in total because the Nemo Series are just one Servant all together sharing one Saint Graph. U-Olga Marie also wants to know about Goredolf and his rebellion against her, but Goredolf slips up and tells her about the Storm Border. Marie is confused by this.

![](https://i.redd.it/cvucbz8uo3ba1.png)

U-Olga Marie demands to know who destroyed the Storm Border, which makes Goredolf nervous on how to respond. Fortunately, Rasputin uses the excuse that Goredolf is wary of the people that we picked up on the way. Rasputin proposes that he and Olga Marie earn his trust.

Rasputin notices that there was a man (Muniere) in the Medical Room. Goredolf desperately asks if he can restore him, but Rasputin will only help if U-Olga Marie says so.

**U-Olga Marie:**

> .? I don’t get it, but I have to order you? Butler. You can do anything, just go help them.

**Rasputin:**

> As you so desire. With this single Elemental that dwells within this body—  
>   
> I shall demonstrate the “Bahloo of the Moon”, spirit of the dark night who offered immortality to humans long ago.

**Fujimaru Ritsuka:**

> You’re back…you’re back—!

![](https://i.redd.it/ec6gsk3mr3ba1.png)

Both Mashu and Fujimaru hug him. Mashu expresses her relief in seeing Muniere back alive. Muniere expresses that all of this life-threatening stuff is something that hasn’t changed and still happens on a daily basis. Muniere says that we shouldn’t worry about it. Muniere talks about the Human Order Incineration Incident where it all began and that the staff of Chaldea were driven to support Mashu and Fujimaru. From there and up till now, they were able to get along. Nemo Nurse tells Fujimaru and Mashu that Goredolf wants them in the Control Room.

![](https://i.redd.it/2e7knuuor3ba1.png)

**Goredolf:**

> Now, let us establish our next strategic objective!

> After we broke into the Seventh Lostbelt, we had to make an unavoidable emergency landing due to an attack by an unknown light.

> And our essential members were taken captive by this adversary!

Master Fujimaru, investigator Mashu Kyrielight, Habetrot, on-site ally Tepeu, For…U-Olga Marie, Rasputin, and Koyanskaya will be the 7 members who will rescue Chaldea staff members, Da Vinci, Sion, Kadoc and Nemo from captivity!

Your destination is the Ocelotls’ metropolis, Mexico City!

**Fujimaru Ritsuka:**

> Understood!  
>   
> Hm? Are you informed about Mictlan?

If you choose the second option, Koyanskaya will tell you that she informed him about Mictlan as they were getting attacked. Rasputin says that they could’ve offered a better explanation if they waited for their arrival.

![](https://i.redd.it/f9xnms4rr3ba1.png)

Goredolf and the rest of the crew will stay to repair the Border with Wak Chan being a bodyguard for the Storm Border. Goredolf likes the fact that they are herbivores and intelligent beings. Rasputin asks about Nitocris’s condition, but Goredolf reports that Nitocris isn’t any fighting condition so he won’t let her follow Fujimaru. Goredolf states that Rasputin, Koyanskaya and U-Olga Marie are enough to compensate. Rasputin and Koyanskaya tease each other about whether they’re up for it or not.

![](https://i.redd.it/7gg8lqlsr3ba1.png)

**Koyanskaya:**

> My, how lovely♡ I’d rather die than receive your therapy♡

Koyanskaya asks about Fou, but it seems that Fou’s nowhere to be seen. 

**Koyanskaya:**

> (...Ah, so that’s how it is. That beast plans to not get involved with ORT, huh)

Meanwhile, Tepeu is with the Nemo Series. The Nemo Series love him as he knows how to use their tools very efficiently. Tepeu is now tasked with giving medicine and techniques that can reinforce a Servant Saint Graph to Nemo. 

![](https://i.redd.it/cq3be0jqu3ba1.png)

Tepeu goes and abruptly meets U-Olga Marie. She says if he’s fine with going to Mexico City and he is. Tepeu worries about the Second Underworld.

**U-Olga Marie:**

**Tepeu:**

> Why, indeed.

Mashu states that the wind is getting colder, meaning that they’re getting close to the Second Underworld. Any communication is severely limited, but Mashu is recording everything to send back to Chaldea. Habetrot needs to conserve energy because Ortenaus couldn’t be fully charged.

**Rasputin:**

> Before we proceed to the Second Underworld Layer. Mr. Tepeu, what kind of trial is it?

![](https://i.redd.it/tuue6hw8ztba1.png)

**Tepeu:**

> Previously, I crossed a mountain trail over a mountain.

> The winds are strong which consumes your stamina to ascend the mountain, but other than that, there’s nothing special about this Underworld.  
>   
> Ah, if you’re careless, then you’ll slip and fall.  
>   
> I’d like to ask everyone to support each other to prevent falling.  
>   
> Also, the road is mingled with polished obsidian due to the wind, so you’ll get cut when you fall down.  
>   
> It’s a minor injury, but if everyone falls multiple times, then we’ll be bleeding heavily.

U-Olga Marie disregards this because she can levitate. She doesn’t tell you how many tons she weighs since she regards that as a state secret, but she at least weighs 10,000 tons. However, this can be ignored due to her gravitational manipulation.

**Tepeu:**

> I see. Then, U-Olga Marie can be our windbreak if any problems arise.

> Everyone, we’ve arrived.

**Tepeu:**

U-Olga Marie states that these **mountains and rocks around them are very lethal.** **Mashu states that the wind speed is currently 10 meters per second and maximum instantaneous wind speed is 20 meters per second.** She states that we’ll need to look out for flying things hurling towards them, and that we’ll have a tough time traversing.

Rasputin notes that these conditions can hinder a Servant’s movement entirely. Koyanskaya pulls out her winter outfit (Koyanskaya of Light, Second Ascension). This outfit was a gift from someone previously. You want one, but she can’t offer you one.

![](https://i.redd.it/d1f1laigztba1.png)

Tepeu remembers that **honey orchids can be useful for everyone since they can be used during the winter season to generate heat** from within the individual, but he didn’t bring any. However, **you remember back when you met Daybit in Chichen Itza and he gave you all that material. You pull out honey orchids and vine ropes that Daybit pushed onto you.** Tepeu distributes it to everyone. **The group seems to be very interested in the taste (Mashu), potential cooking material (Rasputin), medicine (Koyanskaya and Tepeu).** U-Olga Marie wants some, but you’re close to empty so Marie says that she’s fine.

![](https://i.redd.it/yehdzobjztba1.png)

As you are halfway through the mountain, Tepeu asks if this Underworld is similar to anything in Pan-Human History. Mashu states that it’s similar to Itztepetl and explains that Itztepetl is very similar to this Underworld. Tepeu is shocked and claims that people can’t overcome this trial then.

**Rasputin:**

**Fujimaru Ritsuka:**

![](https://i.redd.it/7y0we8umztba1.png)

U-Olga Marie and Mashu know this person. This person is Camazotz. Camazotz says the same introduction he said during his appearance in the First Underworld. He notices that one of them is gone (Nemo Marine) and someone was added in their place (Koyanskaya).

**Camazotz:**

> I truly hope you all never encounter such a disaster. Every one of you are my rare guests.  
>   
> I love Pan-Human History. I do love the taste of blood from monkeys rather than deinos.

**Koyanskaya:**

> —-------

Mashu notices that Koyanskaya is unusually serious. Koyanskaya already knows Camazotz from Mashu’s report back in the Storm Border. She comments that he is a headache to look and speak to and wants to quickly get rid of him to take back your Command Seals.

**Camazotz:**

![](https://i.redd.it/2yu1klkvztba1.png)

**Tepeu:**

![](https://i.redd.it/3i5loshxztba1.png)

Koyanskaya explains that she had given them a free month trial on her to use NFF Services. However, Tezcatlipoca said “We get how it works now. We’ll be manufacturing our own now.” This statement made Koyanskaya furious that Tezcatlipoca stole their know-how and created a business rival.

Mashu knows who Beni-enma is, but Beni-enma is not swayed by someone who knows her. Though she will give her breakfast everyday for that. Beni-enma Alter is told that Chaldea is a destroyer of worlds.

**Beni-enma Alter:**

> —-Therefore. The good will die peacefully, the evil will die tragically.

![](https://i.redd.it/wbjnu7og5uba1.png)

As the fight continues, Beni-enma Alter uses the mountain range as her weapon as well. U-Olga Marie is hit by Beni-enma Alter causing her brainwaves to instantly die and disappear, but U-Olga Marie comes back successfully rebooted and does not want to the same thing to happen again.

Beni-enma Alter has comprehended the groups’ criminal charges.

Tepeu asks if Beni-enma Alter is a Servant of Chaldea. Mashu confirms that she is one of the four Servants tasked with accompanying Fujimaru on this adventure. U-Olga Marie tells the group to forget about Beni-enma and move to the next layer. Rasputin agrees with this notion to continue traversing.

![](https://i.redd.it/or22cius5uba1.png)

**Rasputin:**

> Beni-enma…it is unknown what kind of origin she has as a Heroic Spirit, but her Saint Graph structure is a Divine Spirit type. Additionally, she has that fearsome swordsmanship.

> To wield the mountain range as a sword blade…Currently, my lady will lose 100 percent in terms of approach and scale.

![](https://i.redd.it/ei801huu5uba1.png)

U-Olga Marie agrees with what Rasputin says since she’s scared of Beni-enma’s abilities. Koyanskaya **wants to stay and purify Beni-enma**. You agree to U-Olga Marie’s notion of continuing on. Tepeu shows you the way. Tepeu states that we are at risk of being attacked, but our group can surely handle it anyways.

![](https://i.redd.it/7m3wkg4w5uba1.png)

> Day one of crossing the mountain

The group notices that they are stuck in an endless loop of traversing the mountain. U-Olga Maries states that this Underworld is a space that is closed upon itself and that there is no exit. Rasputin states that with **Beni-enma Alter as the new Underworld Sentinel, the rules of the Underworld have been overridden and has taken the structure of hell in Japanese folklore.** U-Olga Marie vaguely remembers the sentence Beni-enma gave them, but Rasputin recalls that it’s a hundred quintillion years.

**U-Olga Marie:**

> Doesn’t that mean I’m about to reach my lifespan!?

# Arrow 4

The group is surprised at the sentence they now have to face.

**Rasputin:**

> This is truly what they call “life imprisonment”. But, this does call for a jailbreak.

**Habetrot:**

> “Jailbreak”, but how are we supposed to get out?

![](https://i.redd.it/r31gnscp6uba1.png)

**Rasputin:**

> That’s simple.  
>   
> If Beni-enma is the Sentinel and the one who sentenced us, then making her disappear would mean returning to the original Underworld Layer.

**Fujimaru Ritsuka:**

> …Do you have an opinion on this, Koyanskaya?

**Koyanskaya:**

> Naturally I’m against this. This sham priest can go die.

Rasputin explains this Underworld that’s refitted to Beni-enma’s liking to a Japanese hell can revive sinners after they’re killed. That’s also how U-Olga Marie was able to come back and reboot herself. Servants can be killed numerous times, it’s the amount of pain a Servant can endure.

You tell Rasputin that you want her back to normal just like with Kingprotea.

![](https://i.redd.it/rxfj2s7t6uba1.png)

**Rasputin:**

> I apologize, but it will be difficult for me. With Kingprotea, she had a wound that was the “mask”.

It gets you and Mashu thinking of a Servant that possesses anything related to rejuvenation. After a while, Mashu reports that there’s no one that fits the criteria of having any rejuvenation Noble Phantasm. Habetrot doesn’t know any faeries either. Right now, it stands that the group believes that there aren’t any options. However, someone communicates to them through the communication line.

![](https://i.redd.it/02sif9yy6uba1.png)

**Fionn MacCoul:**

**Mashu:**

**Rasputin:**

Someone over the intercom claims himself to be the greatest king of Uruk and humanity’s strongest and best collector.

**Fujimaru Ritsuka:**

> Woahhh—, it’s the king—-!  
>   
> I-i-it’s been a long time…!

![](https://i.redd.it/0f6147y07uba1.png)

Caster Gilgamesh appears. Mashu realizes that Gilgamesh would be the one who’d have items pertaining to anything.

**Gilgamesh:**

> I take it you need “rejuvenation” medicine? Then I have it in my possession.  
>   
> Though the summoner’s mana is third-rate, so I cannot come over myself, but you should be able to summon the miracle drug. Here, take it.

**Rasputin:**

> Oh. How very generous of you. You are different from the king I know. Could we have the wrong king?

![](https://i.redd.it/xw5kkrd37uba1.png)

**Gilgamesh:**

> Hahahah, Fujimaru. Cut off his head while you have the chance.  
>   
> That man will betray you afterwards. And he’ll do it at the moment something disastrous occurs.

![](https://i.redd.it/qrpdi4c57uba1.png)

**Rasputin:**

> That is a misunderstanding. I wasn’t his ally from the very beginning.

> However, king Gilgamesh.  
>   
> According to legends, you searched the abyss for the rejuvenation medicine, and eventually found it.

>   
> Ultimately, you failed to obtain the “sacred rejuvenation herb”…am I remembering that correctly?

![](https://i.redd.it/0cup06x67uba1.png)

**Gilgamesh:**

> Fool. Who do you think I am?

You either remember this story or don’t, but if you do, you’ll get a flashback of BB saying that’s what the King told you in your room with a smug look. Gilgamesh wishes you luck that you’ll make it through the Underworld.

Mashu asks why Gilgamesh rated Fujimaru as third-rate. Gilgamesh says that out of the three criteria, mana, catalysts and the power of fate, the power of fate is insufficient. Gilgamesh asks if you dropped it anywhere. However, Gilgamesh considers that you’ve grown and considers you second rate.

U-Olga Marie tells you that a mountain beside you is starting to move, and that you should respond with a Servant that has resistance to instant death. U-Olga Marie says that she’ll do something in the case you don’t have a Servant resistant to instant death, and tells Mashu to stand back.

**Beni-enma Alter:**

> Even if you are a mouse, the guilty shall never leave. Do not make a big fuss, I shall display the techniques of my swordsmanship here.

![](https://i.redd.it/1vzpenn2auba1.png)

As the fight persists, Koyanskaya insults Beni-enma Alter’s blade techniques as a mess and that Beni-enma shouldn’t boast about her weapon anymore. Her sword is good for big targets, but not for small targets. This makes Beni-enma go all in for Koyanskaya.

**Koyanskaya:**

Koyanskaya determines that this is her chance to go in for Beni-enma Alter. She uses her motorcycle to speed through the mountain of blades to approach Beni-enma Alter.

![](https://i.redd.it/oaxzvs5kcuba1.png)

**Koyanskaya:**

> Phew, I did it! Now, now, open up!

**Beni-enma Alter:**

> A—--a pervert—-!?

After this, Beni-enma turns back to normal.

![](https://i.redd.it/g5rfwa7ocuba1.png)

Beni-enma introduces herself and thanks you for protecting the Human Order. She advises you to have a healthy day by resting early and eating properly. She expresses her determination to help you on your adventure throughout this Lostbelt. You either welcome her aboard or thank her for her hospitality in the past.

![](https://i.redd.it/e473ttamcuba1.png)

**If you thank her for her hospitality in the past,** she’ll know that you’ve been to Enma-tei before and guesses that they’ll meet in the future. Beni-enma asks what we did and when we arrived at Enma-tei. Mashu responds that Chaldea came into Enma-tei in some year during New Years Day. She says that Beni-enma hospitality was spectacular and notes that she was also managing everything with all the other sparrows. Beni-enma is delighted to hear that.

**Beni-enma:**

> With that being over.  
>   
> Can someone get this ghost so that she can stop clinging to my leg?

**Koyanskaya:**

> You’re lying, right, Beni-chaaaaann!? Please remember meeeeee!

![](https://i.redd.it/95m7lwtpcuba1.png)

**Beni-enma:**

> I know a shrine maiden fox who exactly looks like you, and there’s nothing good about you anyways.

Koyanskaya accepts this reality and notes that she was the one who saved her from her Altered form. Beni-enma comments that form and what she did in that form was a disgrace. She still will be a representative of the ten kings, but not in that form.

You get your second stroke of your Command Seal back. 

![](https://i.redd.it/9g7fimorcuba1.png)

**Rasputin:**

> My. That leaves one stroke remaining. It’s safe to say that the third Underworld Sentinel will be withholding it.

**Beni-enma:**

> That bat man, to think that foolish bat would use Fujimaru’s Command Seals like that.  
>   
> But thanks to that, it sheltered my powers.

Beni-enma knows that it’ll be very detrimental to stay in the Underworld as a Sentinel. Beni-enma wants everyone to proceed and not worry about her since she’ll be fine. She says that the next battle is where she’ll shine.

**Fujimaru Ritsuka:**

> .?

As you witness Ocelotl go around the city doing things similar to Chichen Itza, Mashu notes that there are 30,000 people alone on the main street. Koyanskaya states that women and children help build villages in the surrounding forest. Rasputin asks if this city was built on its own with the help of other Ocelotl.

![](https://i.redd.it/oy6xwkbeppca1.png)

**Koyanskaya:**

> …No. Unfortunately, the city was prepared by Tezcatlipoca.

> The Divine Spirit, Tezcatlipoca, was a Servant summoned by the Crypter, David.  
>   
> He bestowed the Ocelotl this city, and revived Aztec mythology in Mictlan.  
>   
> This city’s belief is not with Kukulkan, but with the black sun…the smoking mirror, Tezcatlipoca.  
>   
> The Ocelotl are nothing compared to the Deinos when it comes to strength, but have excellent fertility and adaptability—--  
>   
> Above all else, they flourish because of their “fighting spirit” which is something the deinos don’t have.

U-Olga Marie states that she understands the situation between Chaldea and Tezcatlipoca, but with this city entirely, she states that this city is similar to Mashu and Fujimaru’s color. Tepeu falls silent and Rasputin advises Marie to be careful what she says because people can be sensitive.

**Rasputin:**

> Are they separated?  
>   
> I can make us look like Ocelotl with my disguise technique, but we won’t understand their language.

**Mashu:**

> Yes. Even the translator in Ortenaus cannot adapt to it…

![](https://i.redd.it/68rlw0kkppca1.png)

**Rasputin:**

> Right, that means information gathering through conversation is impossible.

> That means we must search “suspicious locations” on foot.  
>   
> Places with heavy security. Or a Servant who can sense the presence of the Heroic Spirit Nemo.  
>   
> Though, if I were Tezcalipoca, I’d prepare cells that isolate any such presence.

You point out the two buildings at the city’s center. Mashu explains that there is an altar in the middle with platforms that lead from the two buildings to the altar in the middle. Koyanskaya diverts from the conversation about the sacrificial altar.

![](https://i.redd.it/41zg0zzoppca1.png)

**Koyanskaya:**

> Also, those two temples are buildings to worship the gods Tlaloc and Huitzilopochtli.

> The summoned Tezcatlipoca’s resting place is in Huitzilopochtli’s temple.

> Father Kotomine’s disguise technique cannot deceive Tezcatlipoca.

> If he found you out, you’d DIE without any arguments! So let’s not approach the temples.

If you don’t know about Huitzilopochtli, then Mashu will give you a quick lecture of who he is. Mashu states that he is Quetzalcoatl’s enemy. You ask about Daybit, but Koyanskaya states that he’s never in Mexico City and is always investigating the ruins in the sea of trees. She wonders if Daybit is doing his job as a Crypter properly.

U-Olga Marie wants to go around town, but Rasputin says that due to the scarce approach we have in obtaining information and having to be efficient with personnel, he asks Tepeu and U-Olga Marie to wait outside the city. This is due to Tepeu being to big and U-Olga Marie’s horns.

You ask if Marie can make her horns any smaller, but she’s already made it small as it is. U-Olga Marie understands the risks at stake here and wants you and Mashu to thoroughly explore the city and learn everything like culture, ideology and way of living.

Koyanskaya will investigate the back alleys outside the main street. Rasputin will investigate the temples from afar. You and Mashu will investigate the main streets and blend in with the Ocelotl.

During your investigation, you find out there are no prisons or police stations in Mexico City. Mashu notices that the masks on the Ocelotls’ face make it hard to read their expressions. You hear a woman speaking English begging for something at a stall in the background. She can speak to and understand the Ocelotl.

![](https://i.redd.it/gql14bbxppca1.png)

You call for the lady, but you mess up and you weren’t supposed to speak. However, the lady covers you and brings up an excuse that this is the language that Daybit uses.

**???:**

> Now then. Greetings, travelers! I’m Cuauhtli! What about you guys?

Cuauhtli asks if they’re speaking in a foreign language for tomorrow's ceremony. Tomorrow’s ceremony is about the conquering warriors, Chaldea. However, Cuauhtli won’t be joining in the sacrificial ritual.

**Cuauhtli:**

> I’m not good at fighting. My speciality lies in cultivating new land and cultivation.

Mashu asks you what to do since Cuauhtli doesn’t know anything about Mexico City. You ask if we met before, and Cuauhtli states that they could have passed each other and never noticed.

**Cuauhtli:**

> Have you traveled with “someone” who resembles me? If so, then this is a lovely coincidence.

An Ocelotl wants something from Fujimaru. Cuauhtli translates that the Ocelotl smells honey from Fujimaru and wants to trade it for something valuable.

You take out the **skull candy you obtained from “the Man”.** The Ocelotl jumps in excitement and you hand it over to him. You give one to Cuauhtli as well as a gift.

![](https://i.redd.it/h22br6izppca1.png)

**Cuauhtli:**

> Then, I’ll gladly take itttt! This is the first a human has given me a presentttt!  
>   
> To return the gratitude, I’ll tell you a bit of a rumor, alright?  
>   
> The conqueror Chaldea who’ve been brought here by King Izcalli and Tezcatlipoca will be handled tomorrow.  
>   
> They possess special blood, therefore, they’ve been selected as sacrifices to be offered up to the sun.  
>   
> So, you better prepare quickly if you’re going to save them.

> Even if it means fighting 100,000 Ocelotl.

> Isn’t your guys’ speciality to move on this intelligence, Fujimaru-san of Pan-Human History?

**Fujimaru Ritsuka:**

> .! How do you know my name!  
>   
> Wait…!

Cuauhtli runs off, but Mashu can’t find her or catch her after she ran through the crowd like a breeze. You decide to go back to the camping site.

![](https://i.redd.it/dg574vw0qpca1.png)

![](https://i.redd.it/0kfvw656qpca1.png)

You report everything to the group back in the campsite. U-Olga Marie is shocked by tomorrow’s ceremony. Rasputin tells her that it isn’t to sacrifice the sinners, but offering their hearts as an act of holiness. Marie is still upset that they have to sacrifice outsiders to proper their country. 

![](https://i.redd.it/yhs2n9g8qpca1.png)

Tepeu asks about how sacrifices work and why it is necessary in some cultures. Rasputin gives a lecture about the meaning of sacrifice in Aztec civilization. The notable and important points that Rasputin gives is that:

1. **They had an interest in astronomy** which stemmed from their ancestors being victims of a cosmic threat. This led to them taking in Central and South American memories that the world would be destroyed by a foreign cosmic object. In Aztec myth, the world was **destroyed multiple times**. Rasputin says **four, but it’s five** with the “present time” of Aztec mythology. **This is the Aztec mythological version of the cycle of rebirth and extinction.** People took Central America’s memories of rebirth and extinction as a lesson and were influenced by them.
2. The Aztec civilization believed that the world would be **destroyed every 52 years**. Once the radiance of the sun disappeared, the world would be engulfed in darkness which would commence the destruction of the Aztec world. **This is why priests offered up living sacrifices to maintain the sun’s radiance.**
3. Tepeu asks why couldn’t the people realize that the sun operates independently. Rasputin explains that this was the reality for the Aztecs. The worldview of the sun and destruction was difficult for anyone to live. **Rasputin believed that the Aztec fell due to magecraft, as they rejected human sacrifices,** considering the world the Aztecs lived in at the time.
4. Quetzalcoatl denied human sacrifice while Tezcatlipoca did. The Spaniards came and considered Tezcatlipoca for supporting such sacrifices after they witnessed the highest aloft waterside city.
5. Moctezuma II invited Hernan Cortes because he believed that Hernan Cortes was Quetzalcoatl. But it is odd that someone would invite a person who didn’t like human sacrifice. The gods that were worshiped in Tenochtitlan were the Rain God, Tlaloc and the Tribal God, Huitzilopochtli. He considered that the Aztec would be destroyed by other tribes and wanted to stop human sacrifice. He considered Hernan Cortes to be the “reemergence of Quetzalcoatl”, a weapon he could use.
6. However, Hernan Cortes was oblivious to their culture until La Malinche taught him the language, culture and the Aztec Empire’s weakness. In the end, the Aztec Empire and the other tribes were defeated by the Spanish Empire. Though in truth, it was La Malinche.

Rasputin focuses on the main objective which is tomorrow’s ceremony where they’ll use Chaldea staff as offerings.

**Rasputin:**

> Prisoners are kept in an underground prison in Tlaloc’s temple.

Rasputin states that the plan to infiltrate the temple and break Chaldea out will be tomorrow during the ceremony. The plan is that as Ocelotl kneel and pray for the ritual’s success, the group will go in and get them.

**Koyanskaya:**

> Very well. Allow me to secure an infiltration route.  
>   
> Everyone can continue to chat here. Upon the name of NFF Services, I will secure us a perfect route.

# Arrow 3

![Chapter 9 Arrow 3](https://i.redd.it/xd6rmtydrpca1.png)

Izcalli is seemingly saying his farewell with this being his last sight of the waterways dividing the city into two. Tlaloc comes to warm Izcalli to not be out on a sunless night. Izcalli answers that where they are is where only kings, gods and sacrifices are permitted to be.

**Izcalli:**

> Besides…what is that appearance? You look as if you’re a human from Pan-Human History…

![](https://i.redd.it/c30wawfgrpca1.png)

**Tlaloc:**

> …Do not mind it. It is just to match with my brother.  
>   
> “If you want to protect Mexico City, then make an effort to integrate into civilization.”  
>   
> They dislike obsolete gods. He said that the Ocelotl would call me old-fashioned.

**Izcalli:**

> No. I am content with Tlaloc’s usual appearance.  
>   
> Mictlan deserves to witness the embodiment of blessed rain and death by flooding rivers.

![](https://i.redd.it/hs1g7jcjrpca1.png)

**Tlaloc:**

> …Indeed. This is the Lostbelt of Mictlan.  
>   
> Different from the weak Mictlan of Pan-Human History. A place where they allow the existence of warriors.  
>   
> Are you aware of it, Izcalli? The definition of paradise in Aztec mythology.  
>   
> It is those who go to Mictlan and “weren’t warriors”.  
>   
> A world with no relation with good and evil, where humans died naturally and not in battle.  
>   
> This Mictlan is the exact opposite. At the very least, that’s how it is for the Ocelotl.

Izcalli explains that the Ocelotl are warriors and they are offerings to Tezcatlipoca when they die in battle. **The Aztecs of Pan-Human History were mistaken because it is not just a ceremony of rebirth** and not about sacrificing those who weren’t warriors for rain and the like.

Izcalli explains that this world is different because they only rip out powerful organs to revive a god.

![](https://i.redd.it/kj4pwe4orpca1.png)

**Izcalli:**

> And now we are close to the needed amount. That Chaldea staff and the great artificial human.  
>   
> Their hearts are rarer than the deinos. The revival of the true Tezcatlipoca. The final step.

Tlaloc asks Izcalli if he knows about the deepest layer of Mictlan.

**Izcalli:**

> Yes. There rests a “weapon” that can annihilate Pan-Human History.  
>   
> A year ago, Tezcatlipoca ascended from the deepest layer to the fifth layer and bestowed weapons to us.  
>   
> A year later, he went down to the deepest layer again to obtain another weapon to destroy Pan-Human History.  
>   
> We will obey that will. We will exterminate the deinos, grasp the hegemony of Mictlan, and replace the foolish Pan-Human History with Mexico City taking over the “next” of humanity.

Tlaloc tells him that he’s right. However, Tlaloc orders him to make tomorrow perfect or else his life will be forfeit. Izcalli swears to meet those expectations and fulfill his duty perfectly. Tlaloc sternly asks him if he is being arrogant by underestimating Pan-Human History even after what happened at the Storm Border (Marie using her thunder to knock out Izcalli).

![](https://i.redd.it/n4yywuslrpca1.png)

**Izcalli:**

> —I am belittling them. That does not mean I am dismissing them.  
>   
> They are novices who break down after the death of their fellow brethren. As a warrior, I cannot comprehend their emotions.  
>   
> They are intent on killing us as hostiles, yet aren’t prepared for even the death of their brethren—  
>   
> I have never felt such detest. The humans of Pan-Human History are unsightly.  
>   
> For me to be raised by Tezcatlipoca, their civilization is not worth acknowledging.

![](https://i.redd.it/u1i7q8sqrpca1.png)

**Tlaloc:**

> …Right. You don’t acknowledge them, but you continue to hate them, it seems.

**Izcalli:**

> Tlaloc?

**Tlaloc:**

> I am talking to myself. If you heard it, then think about what it means.

Tlaloc starts walking away, Izcalli holds her up thinking that she still has headaches after Tezcatlipoca’s shot, but Tlaloc walks away saying that she’s fine.

![](https://i.redd.it/gaw1s9ksrpca1.png)

Meanwhile, Kadoc and Sion are in a cell together. Sion explains that there is no possible way to communicate with anyone. 

![](https://i.redd.it/2u1rbseurpca1.png)

**Sion:**

> It’s as if we’re in a different world…like being inside an animal…  
>   
> Or being in a spaceship that cuts off communication…

Kadoc says that he’s conserving his energy for **when** we come in and save them. Kadoc hears someone coming down and assumes that we’re there, but it’s Daybit. Kadoc tells Daybit that he didn’t think that Daybit would arm Lostbelt natives with weapons and cultivate an army.

![](https://i.redd.it/r0ssvihwrpca1.png)

**Daybit:**

> The one who inspected your guys’ ship was my Servant who acted alone.  
>   
> I was doing something else. I just returned to Mexico City.  
>   
> Though, I would have done the same thing. The only difference being that I would’ve disposed of you all than take captives.

Sion introduces herself to Daybit, but Daybit knows about her being in the Wandering Sea and supplying Chaldea with the Anti-Foreign God weapon.

![](https://i.redd.it/99t9mc8lspca1.png)

**Daybit:**

> I’ve remembered your name and face. You’re someone who I’d kill.  
>   
> I am not an outstanding man like Wodime, but my memory is the best there is.  
>   
> The next time we meet, I’ll go for you first. I can guarantee that.

**Sion:**

> Ah, alright.  
>   
> (Woah, was that a death threat, Mr. Kadoc?)

**Kadoc:**

> (If it sounds like a proposal to you, then you’re a fool. —More importantly)  
>   
> You say next time, so you aren’t to kill us now, huh. Why? You’re the last Crypter left.  
>   
> You haven’t rebelled against the “Foreign God” like Kirishtaria did.  
>   
> You have no reason to keep someone like me who’s defected to Chaldea or their talented staff.

**Daybit:**

> Tezcatlipoca was the one who captured you guys. Not me.  
>   
> He has his own ideas and objectives. I had nothing to do with the snatching since I wasn’t there.  
>   
> —Well, you could say that he took the initiative.  
>   
> He’s the type to go out and never say anything about it.  
>   
> He’ll suddenly return and nonchalantly say “ah, my bad, but I completely used up your bank account”.

![](https://i.redd.it/qgco6mmespca1.png)

**Sion:**

> (Is this DV (domestic violence)?)

**Kadoc:**

> Ha. So you aren’t on good terms with your Servant. Then you aren’t going to kill us because of your Servant…  
>   
> You’re frightened of Tezcatlipoca, aren’t you?

![](https://i.redd.it/7k9p2gagspca1.png)

**Daybit:**

> Yea. He’s a major Servant. He dominated extraterrestrial life on Mictlan and established Pan-Human History rules in one year.  
>   
> In reality, Mexico City is his city.  
>   
> He summoned temples, cultivated the Ocelotl, constructed this city, and chose the city’s king.  
>   
> All I am is Tezcatlipoca’s summoner.  
>   
> If Chaldea intends on fighting this Lostbelt, then the one who’ll destroy you will not be me, but Tezcatlipoca.

**Sion:**

> Then, you have no interest in this Lostbelt, right, Mr. Daybit? Are you fine with Chaldea removing this Lostbelt?

![](https://i.redd.it/bxtkbsaispca1.png)

**Daybit:**

> So you want to remove it. I won’t interfere if you do it in 10 days.

**Sion:**

> I see, I see. Then if Chaldea can sever the Fantasy Tree, then doesn’t that mean your objectives will restart at square one?

**Daybit:**

> That is, if you can do it. As an individual, I don’t care either way—  
>   
> Since Wodime carried through till the very end, I will also fulfill my Order.

**Kadoc:**

> …Don’t be absurd. Kirishtaria didn’t follow through with it.  
>   
> He was betrayed by Beryl at the last second, and died.

![](https://i.redd.it/vz8wt5bqspca1.png)

**Daybit:**

> I’m not talking about the result. It’s about the will.  
>   
> He didn’t move on his calculation that “my plan will absolutely succeed”.  
>   
> What kept his body which was on the verge of death moving was his will.  
>   
> He kept going till the very end. Even if he was annoyed, he had no regrets.  
>   
> You could say he followed through. Yet the ideals he sought out for didn’t materialize.

**Kadoc:**

> …Well. …I guess you’re right.

**Daybit:**

> Let’s stop there. Let’s focus on something else. I don’t have time today.   
>   
> I have a question, Kadoc. Why won’t you bring your Servant along?  
>   
> You’re a Master. Use your Servant, you should be able to break out of this prison with ease.

![](https://i.redd.it/qkjj0w5sspca1.png)

**Kadoc:**

> Well I obviously don’t have one. I’m no longer a Crypter and changed sides.  
>   
> I don’t have authorization from Chaldea to summon a Servant, and I don’t wish for one either.

**Daybit:**

> That’s not what I’m talking about. Why won’t you use what’s there.

![](https://i.redd.it/qfc1mv0uspca1.png)

**Kadoc:**

> Huh?

![](https://i.redd.it/klnudt6wspca1.png)

**Daybit:**

> …Good grief. You’re a lucky guy. I can see why Peperoncino never let you go.  
>   
> You still have your Sirius Light.   
>   
> It’s a spell that generates mana that’s ten times larger than a Command Seal. A detonator that instantly amplifies the caster’s mana circuits.  
>   
> A Crypter using the Greater Command Seal would die. To simply put it, they implode.  
>   
> The Greater Command Seal is a bomb. In the case that the Crypter failed their Rayshift, Marisbury prepared an insurance plan so that we can accomplish an Order **by destroying the entire territory.**  
>   
> Ophelia was lucky that was on the brink of death. She was a caster who’s already dead before their Greater Command Seal could be activated.  
>   
> If Ophelia utilized her Greater Command Seal before receiving a fatal wound, then she would’ve eliminated the Shadow Border and all Chaldea survivors.

Kadoc explains that he vaguely thought that was the case and the Beryl was there because he’d make sure their Greater Command Seal was used if any Crypter tried to escape from the Singularity. That’s why there were seven Crypters, one for each Singularity. He knew that Marisbury didn’t believe that the Crypter could fulfill the Human Order Restoration.

Kadoc states that what Daybit is saying is that Kadoc should use his Sirius Light to blow both him and Daybit up. Daybit says that he doesn’t care, but notes that Nemo and Da Vinci are in a separate jail.

![](https://i.redd.it/lu4cp2h1tpca1.png)

**Daybit:**

> The Greater Command Seal is a bomb, and also a Master’s wildcard.  
>   
> The Greater Command Seal gives you a chance to give an abnormal order to your Servant.  
>   
> I told you what happened with Ophelia. **But if you suicide before you use it, then you won’t implode.**  
>   
> In short, you either die, or achieve something before you die. It’s up to you what you want to do, Kadoc.

Daybit leaves.

![](https://i.redd.it/w6n2i443tpca1.png)

**Kadoc:**

> …Is that all!? Why did you come here then!?

**Daybit:**

> I told you already. To confirm enemy capabilities. It’s the least **I can do** since I can’t kill you all here and now.

Sion is surprised by what she heard. She couldn’t understand what they were talking about even though it was right in front of her. She compares Daybit to an open void in the world. Kadoc sympathizes with her, but he states that Daybit is a caring, social and smart person. Daybit only says something if it’s necessary.

Kadoc:

> (...Like I said. There’s meaning in the information he told me about the Greater Command Seal. He’s telling me to think—about what to do with it and where to use it)

Kadoc asks her to keep what just happened a secret. She agrees to keep the entire thing a secret which makes Kadoc relieved.

## Chapter 10 - Day of ORT

 

![Chapter 10: Day of ORT](https://i.redd.it/l5wd9oa2enda1.png)

# Arrow 1

![](https://i.redd.it/pjrj1dj5enda1.png)

Mashu points out that the atmosphere of today and yesterday are on different wavelengths. Koyanskaya explains that today is the ceremony after all. Koyanskaya emphasizes that if there were any deinos present, then there would be a massacre. Tepeu, out of fear, asks if his disguise is properly working. Rasputin reassures him that it is working properly.

Habetrot wants to hurry in there and get them, but Koyanskaya says that the priests are doing prayers to the sun. After the prayers, the sacrifices are brought up to the top of the temple. Koyanskaya says that they have 2 hours and that she’s seen this ritual done before.

Tepeu finds this terrifying because when deinos are killed by the Ocelotl and use their parts for stuff, he doesn’t mind that. The thing he finds terrifying is the sacrifice of humans from Pan-Human History. Tepeu considers that murder.

![](https://i.redd.it/e9lls4w8enda1.png)

**Koyanskaya:**

> Everyone, prepare yourselves. Once we turn this street corner, we’ll arrive at the side of the temple.  
>   
> There is no Ocelotl within the vicinity, though there are several guards inside.  
>   
> We’ll have to fight if we’re seen, but the captives’ safety isn’t guaranteed if we do fight.  
>   
> Let us wrap this up quickly. Is that alright?  
>   
> Then, let’s be off. Rescue operation, commence!

![](https://i.redd.it/bm9f0nvaenda1.png)

Inside the temple, the group has to navigate their way to the prison. Rasputin offers to take one or two Ocelotl for interrogation so that it can be easier on them. Koyanskaya takes up on Rasputin’s offer and handles it herself.

![](https://i.redd.it/mdupfvucenda1.png)

Koyanskaya talks to the Ocelotl guard and the Ocelotl guard casually tells her that it’s the third cell down the steps. Mashu and Olga Marie are shocked at how Koyanskaya did it. Koyanskaya roasts Rasputin that such violent interrogation techniques like beating Ocelotl up, shooting them, and the like for information is unbetting. Koyanskaya used the art of coaxing to obtain information.

**Koyanskaya:**

> (In reality, I bribed them with bananas and corn, but that’s a trade secret)  
>   
> Though, this isn’t the place to be boasting.  
>   
> It seems that 2 sacrifices have been moved to the altar in the middle of the night. The other 2 are still captured in the dungeon.  
>   
> The two sacrifices who were chosen were a mage and a homunculus. I suppose it’d be Kadoc-sama and Da Vinci-sama.  
>   
> First, let’s rescue the moribund Heroic Spirit Nemo and Sion Eltnam from the dungeon, afterwards, we hurry up to the altar and grab the other 2; are we good with that plan?

**Fujimaru Ritsuka:**

> Of course!  
>   
> Let’s hurry!

![](https://i.redd.it/p7hdgxofenda1.png)

We arrive at the dungeon and meet Kadoc. You realize that Sion and Da Vinci were taken as sacrifices, not Kadoc and Da Vinci. Kadoc explains that they chose a more famous person than the stronger one. Kadoc briefs you on Nemo’s situation.

![](https://i.redd.it/4ekpse7henda1.png)

**Tepeu:**

> Pardon me. This is the Heroic Spirit Nemo, right? I will be administering the medicine given to me by Professor.  
>   
> I think it went like this and the spell went like this.  
>   
> Mythological concept, clarified. Human Order essentials, analyzed. Saint Graph construct, supplemented. Itinerancy faith, established.

Nemo Marine wakes up and asks Tepeu if he is a Lostbelt native. Tepeu stands there in shock. Nemo knows that he was the one who administered the medicine to him.

**Tepeu:**

> No. No, it is nothing, Captain Nemo. It’s just, you resemble someone who I lost.  
>   
> Greetings. I am Tepeu. I am someone of humanity in the subterranean world, Mictlan, the South American Lostbelt.

> You can get more information from Fujimaru and Mashu. I will guard the passageway.

**Nemo:**

> —Aside from him, I understand the current situation.

> Sion, Da Vinci. They are compatriots of Chaldea, we will rescue both of them no matter what!

![Chapter 10 Arrow 2](https://i.redd.it/039q75kpenda1.png)

As they’re running to the top of the temple for Sion and Da Vinci, U-Olga Marie notices Kadoc’s horrible condition, mainly his eyebags, and asks if he’s taking care of himself properly. Kadoc explains that this is normal for people who utilize Anti-Beast Magecraft. U-Olga Marie sympathizes with him since he has to be attentive at all times for beasts lurking around.

![](https://i.redd.it/n24fpw0renda1.png)

**Kadoc:**

> (Hey, Fujimaru, what is all of this! I would have never expected this insane situation, you know!?)  
>   
> (Rasputin and Koyanskaya! And even U-Olga Marie!)  
>   
> (I wonder what kind of events happened to form this absurd party! I’ve had enough of these drastic and dramatic events!)

You calm him down, but he’s still skeptical that things will die down. Kadoc has already caught on about the U-Olga Marie situation. He knows that we have to play along with Marie’s amnesia.

![](https://i.redd.it/jwa09mx8fnda1.png)

**Rasputin:**

> My, having a secret talk, are we? It’s amazing that you’ve been making friends, Kadoc.  
>   
> I’m very proud of you. I knew it was worth the risk to deliver you onto the Border.

![](https://i.redd.it/qkw1g1k9fnda1.png)

**Koyanskaya:**

> My! So it was the priest that rescued Kadoc who should’ve died on Olympus!?  
>   
> What a betrayal… You were on such good terms with the other Apostles…  
>   
> Now the deceased Limbo-san and Muramasa-sama won’t be recompensed after all they’ve done…  
>   
> To put it simply, I think it’s time you commit seppuku as an apology…

**Rasputin:**

> You must not fake cry, Koyanskaya-kun. The Lord wouldn’t forgive you, even if you’re a beautiful woman.  
>   
> If you want to be better at acting, you must confront your own hideousness by looking in a mirror.

![](https://i.redd.it/d1asz48afnda1.png)

Koyanskaya and Rasputin start fighting each other.

**Kadoc:**

> Here’s the plan. We’ll have to deal with the priests and the others at the altar.  
>   
> From there, Fujimaru, Mashu, Nemo, U-Olga Marie and…  
>   
> The dinosaur…Mr. Tepeu will enter into the fray.

**Tepeu:**

> While I cannot fight, I would be the best choice in drawing the Ocelotls’ attention.

**Kadoc:**

> (...So he’s a pacifist, huh… This Lostbelt is entirely different unlike the rest…)  
>   
> Well, while we’re fighting, Rasputin and Koyanskaya will rescue Da Vinci and Sion.  
>   
> Naturally, Chaldea (we) aren’t fools (good natured) to leave it up to just those two. I’ll keep an eye on them.

**Fujimaru Ritsuka:**

> O-of course.  
>   
> Alright, let’s go with that.

**Kadoc:**

> Let’s split up. We’ll approach the altar from a different route.  
>   
> The more you guys stand out, the greater the success. Go on a rampage!

![](https://i.redd.it/5r5zfrjbfnda1.png)

**Izcalli:**

> Roar, warriors of Mictlan!  
>   
> With the blood of those deinos lot, the Lunar Path has returned to its rightful color!  
>   
> They wish for an unchanging cycle! They have established nothing, they are the foolish deinos!  
>   
> Their blood has been sent to Xibalba! The great sun shall awaken once more!

![](https://i.redd.it/4ayr1zhcfnda1.png)

**Izcalli:**

> Give your life to the sun! Glory to Tezcatlipoca! And a cruel death to all conquerors!  
>   
> Pan-Human History has denied our Mictlan and fifth sun! They are foreign invaders, but now, their hearts will spark the holy fire!  
>   
> The sun will rejoice in this rare blood! With this sacrifice, our wishes will be fulfilled!

Mashu says that their enthusiasm is shaking the bridge. You and U-Olga Marie decide to push in. You call out to him to tell him that this all ends here. The crowd below becomes confused, but becomes excited a second later.

![](https://i.redd.it/b7s73nqffnda1.png)

**Izcalli:**

> So you’ve come, man of Pan-Human History. This wouldn’t have been worthwhile if you hadn’t come.  
>   
> We have the hearts we need, your heads have some worth to them.  
>   
> After all, you all are warriors who’ve defeated countless Ocelotl. A befitting show for the ritual’s finale.  
>   
> These are the olden Ocelotl. Warriors among warriors. They will be a fair match for your summoned Servants.  
>   
> —We will never be careless. I am the King of the Ocelotl, and Tezcatlipoca who’s lived for a year.  
>   
> On my name as ruler of Mictlan! I will emerge victorious against you conquerors!

#  Arrow 3

![Chapter 10 Arrow 3](https://i.redd.it/tfu6aralfnda1.png)

**Izcalli:**

> Why…!? Is this a hero? The power of a hero…?  
>   
> Foolish, heroes of Pan-Human History have no value at all…!  
>   
> They deceive people! Delude their trust! They steal and destroy with their ignorance!  
>   
> I will not acknowledge them. I will never acknowledge the future of your people’s world.  
>   
> Priest! Commence the sacrificial ritual!  
>   
> Kill their brethren first! Their morale should be lost with that!

An Ocelotl is defeated by Koyanskaya. Koyanskaya has secured Sion and Da Vinci. Kadoc orders everyone to retreat since they achieve their goal. Kadoc nearly dodges a bullet. That bullet coming from…

![](https://i.redd.it/igxweelofnda1.png)

**Tezcatlipoca:**

> Now let’s slow down. You just breached the enemy’s core.  
>   
> It’d be a waste to go back now. Since I’ll be shooting you all dead, youngins.

**Kadoc:**

> Tezcatlipoca…!? His presence or mana wasn’t even here, how did you suddenly appear!?

**Tezcatlipoca:**

> I’ve been here from the start. This city is my world after all.  
>   
> Ah, ever heard of the western style of god is omnipresent? Think of it like that.

![](https://i.redd.it/p9htpeerfnda1.png)

You notice him and Tezcatlipoca knows that you’ve been giving those skull candy away. He says that he’ll kill you here if you don’t want to undergo the trials. Izcalli persists that he continue battling. Tezcatlipoca asks Izcalli about his purpose. Izcalli’s purpose is to survive so that his body can be used as a vessel for Tezcalipoca.

![](https://i.redd.it/akb20yqtfnda1.png)

Tezcatlipoca looks at the group and decides to kill you all here. Kadoc wonders what you’re going to decide on doing since Tezcatlipoca is a fearsome foe. Tezcatlipoca notices U-Olga Marie and asks if she’s here for revenge.

U-Olga Marie seems to know Tezcatlipoca, but seems to have malfunctioned in remembering who he is entirely. She continues to have trouble remembering.

![](https://i.redd.it/mg0noo9xfnda1.png)

**U-Olga Marie:**

> I remember now! He’s the one who killed me! Beat him up, Fujimaru!

**Tezcatlipoca:**

> Indeed, Tlaloc.  
>   
> I can handle a mere mage of Pan-Human History, but that woman is beyond my control.  
>   
> Swap with me. I permit you to soak the altar.

![](https://i.redd.it/xa99pwmzfnda1.png)

**Tlaloc:**

> …You’ve snuck into the city, raided the temple, interrupted Izcalli and confronted my brother.  
>   
> —You truly are a damned champion, huh.  
>   
> It’s either you jump off and die or die by my currents.

![](https://i.redd.it/7eo44c90gnda1.png)

**Kadoc:**

> Shit, so it’s a fight in the end, huh…!  
>   
> Summon a Servant, Fujimaru! There’s someone who can counter Tlaloc, right!?

**Fujimaru Ritsuka:**

> Of course! I’m counting on you, Nemo!  
>   
> A Servant who can float!

# Choice 2:

**Mashu:**

> R-really!? I don’t understand, but I’ll follow Master’s judgment!

# CHOICE END

**Tlaloc:**

> .? …This is the first time I’m fighting you… It doesn't matter either way.  
>   
> You’ll fall to your death anyway. At the very least, I’ll make it painless by knocking you out.

# Arrow 4

![Chapter 10 Arrow 4](https://i.redd.it/1y0s9u07gnda1.png)

You stand against Tlaloc and her currents. The rain has stopped. You consider this as avenging Nitocris. Tlaloc corrects you slightly that she never was affected by her currents and was defeated in another manner, but Tlaloc won’t tell you. Tlaloc gets serious and becomes someone else. Nemo confirms a class change and something else.

![](https://i.redd.it/tslnm0k5gnda1.png)

**Huitzilopochtli:**

> Indeed. Tlaloc is taking her break. How will fair fighting against God Huitzilopochtli rather than the grace of rain, Tlaloc?  
>   
> You’ll be fighting against this Saint Graph now. You all seem to specialize in fighting, right?

Mashu is struggling against Huitzilopochtli and Huitzilopochtli seems to love symmetry. Kadoc suggests that you and Mashu retreat since Huitzilopochtli seems to be too much for them. Kadoc dodges Tezcatlipoca’s bullet once more.

![](https://i.redd.it/93kj4fs9gnda1.png)

**Tezcatlipoca:**

> You better stop talking shit about my sister. Well, no, you’re saying in the open rather than behind her back.  
>   
> I object to your judgment. Or is it a complaint? No matter, hope you’re ready for what’s about to come.  
>   
> Once you’re done with them, handle the mage over there, hummingbird.  
>   
> Those two sacrifices we had—escaped. That priest looking guy. He sure moves fast.  
>   
> But we’re in luck, we’ve got two hearts right here. The quality may have decreased, but they’re humans from Pan-Human History.  
>   
> We’ll go with them for today. Izcalli is going to be depressed if the ritual doesn't go through.

**Huitzilopochtli:**

> …Indeed. Izcalli is doing very well. His failures will be compensated by me.

U-Olga Marie is in trouble since her attacks are landing. She looks to you for advice on how to proceed. Huitzilopochtli starts approaching with killing intent since she knows that she has the upper hand.

**???:**

> Now this won’t do.  
>   
> I tried to stay away from fights involving guests from Pan-Human History, but that boy over there is under my watch after all.  
>   
> So let me pitch in!  
>   
> Hupp!

**Huitzilopochtli:**

> She penetrated my brother’s smoke…!? Who are you, a Servant of Pan-Human History!?

![](https://i.redd.it/wbphzgwdgnda1.png)

**Cuauhtli:**

> .? Ah, that’s right. I didn’t introduce myself to Huitzilopochtli yet.  
>   
> Hello, everyone from Pan-Human History. I am Kukulkan. The God of wind, water and the sun, Kukulkan.  
>   
> To put it simply, I am Mictlan’s creator. In your terms, I am the Queen of the “South American Lostbelt”!

**Mashu:**

> Huh—

**Fujimaru:**

> Huuuuuuuuuuuh!?  
>   
> Somehow you look like someone I know!

# Arrow 6

![](https://i.redd.it/z5faue6yjnda1.png)

Tlaloc is surprised about how things turned out and that the city is back to normal. Tezcatlipoca, on the other hand, is absolutely thrilled to have such an event play out with last-minute entrants, and doesn’t mind being the loser for once.

Tlaloc has something to say, but Tezcatlipoca tells her to spit it out since they’re siblings. Tlaloc is concerned about Tezcatlipoca’s vessel and suggests to make the Crypter treat it for him.

![](https://i.redd.it/sf51zvl0lnda1.png)

**Tezcatlipoca:**

> No need. There’s no need to bestow him needless penalties. I need him to be in perfect condition for the Underworld Pilgrimage.

Tezcatlipoca asks about Tlaloc’s recovery from Kukulkan’s punch. Tlaloc doesn’t answer the question, but makes remarks that she’ll defeat her next time. Tezcatlipoca tells her to fix her temple for the Ocelotls’ satisfaction. 

![](https://i.redd.it/tvlrzn32lnda1.png)

Tlaloc asks about the future. Tezcatlipoca nonchalantly confirms that it was the future of Mexico City. He states that the Aztec is a ruined country. **A soldier dies when death comes knocking at their door** and states that there’s no need to change the future.

Tezcatlipoca states that if Izcalli had a gun in his hands, Izcalli would disregard for his own life and Tezcatlipoca considers him a monkey in the end.

Tlaloc asks Tezcatlipoca if he needs to use this city as a battlefield or even that monster for victory, but regrets saying that since that would mean defying him. Tezcatlipoca states that he is no one’s ally, and is an ally of “war”. 

![](https://i.redd.it/8vlqfpl0knda1.png)

**Tezcatlipoca:**

> Daybit’s objective. Chaldea’s objective. The wishes of the Ocelotl. The wishes of the Deinos.  
>   
> I support them all. I shall not interrupt.   
>   
> But Kukulkan is a different case, me and her do not have the same stance.  
>   
> Whoever dies or whatever is lost in Mictlan is nothing but a trivial matter.  
>   
> Well, I’m taking a massive gamble on Daybit. His objective is the biggest reward out of them all.  
>   
> Are you going for Izcalli? If things go well, he’ll massively improve. He’s got talent after all.  
>   
> Have some fun, Tlaloc.  
>   
> What Quetzalcoatl has and what you don’t have is the freedom to entertain yourself for the enjoyment of it all.

![](https://i.redd.it/5acjov0plnda1.png)

Tezcatlipoca walks away. Tlaloc contemplates to herself what enjoyment is and what the form of that enjoyment is like. Her enjoyment is the city. Protecting the city and its citizens, mourning the warriors who continue to take pride from the city and love the city. 

**Tlaloc:**

> Nobody knows the end is set in stone. For now, no one knows…

![](https://i.redd.it/luonf7m5knda1.png)

**Izcalli:**

> …Tch. Noisy Ocelotl.  
>   
> …No, I understand the picture. They’re discontent with me failing the ritual.  
>   
> A king who’s lost to the conquerors from Pan-Human History. A worthless king. An undignified king.  
>   
> “Get out. Get out. Get out of Mexico City.”  
>   
> “An incompetent king should get out of our city.”  
>   
> Have it your way. After I become Tezcatlipoca, I will leave this city.  
>   
> Damn lowly warriors. Nobody would want to live in a city mimicking Pan-Human History civilization.  
>   
> I’ll make my own city. A city where people pray to the gods and sun in unison.

> An underground Underworld paradise where Tezcatlipoca lives with no sacrifices, no weaklings, no wealthy people, no meaningless battles.  
>   
> —My wound aches. Chaldea arrived here a while ago.  
>   
> Conquerors from Pan-Human History. Humans who’ve come to eliminate Mictlan.

> …This is a trivial problem. A very trivial problem.

> I couldn’t obtain their heart for sacrifice, but those things are less than a deino’s heart.

> What were you expecting from people who gain pleasure from pulling the trigger of a gun, Izcalli?  
>   
> Emotions are worthless for a king. Just work for our god. Yet—

> After witnessing such an event, why am I hesitating?
