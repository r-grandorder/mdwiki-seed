# Jack the Ripper

## Jack Kills Jack

**Jack:**
Hey, hey, hey,
Mommy.

 
**Jack:**
...Are you awake?
Ah, you are awake.

 
**Jack:**
Looks like we got lost.
Your Servant is over there, too.

 
**Jack:**
And Fou is there, too.

 
**Fou:**
Fou...

 
**Jack:**
Hehehe, he's so fluffy!

 
**Fou:**
Mkyu!?
Fou, Fou, Fou!?

 
**Mash:**
J-Jack!
You're holding it too tight!

 
**Jack:**
Okay.

 
**Fou:**
Fou...

 
**Mash:**
Master, are you all right?
Yes. I've just woken up as well.

 
**Mash:**
It looks like&ndash;we are in London.

 
**Jack:**
Yes, we are. This is our...hm, home?

 
**Mash:**
I tried to make contact with Doctor a while ago, but...
Apparently, the connection has been cut off.

 
**Jack:**
Then, why don't we go find Mom together, Mommy.

 
**Mash:**
Jack?

 
**Jack:**
It's going to be fine.

 
**Jack:**
The fresh air, good smells, and beautiful sky.

 
**Mash:**
...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Are you all right?
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Are you feeling sick?
 


---
 
**Mash:**
Um, yes.
Well... The air feels a little weird.

 
**Mash:**
You look...fine, Master.
I wonder why.

 
**Jack:**
Mommy, Mommy.
There. I found Mom.

 
**Mash:**
Is that...your?
No, that isn't! It's an enemy!

 
**Jack:**
...Really? But our Mom usually comes to hurt us.

 
**Jack:**
Like crushing us, or ripping us into pieces.
So, I'm sure that's Mom.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
This is something else.
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
That's not your mother.
 


---
 
**Jack:**
Okay. If you say so, Mommy,
it probably isn't.

 
**Jack:**
In that case, it's just someone who'll try to hurt us.
Just like doctors.

 
**Jack:**
...Yes. Mommy, can I beat them up?
I can, right?

 
**Jack:**
Yes, yes!


**--BATTLE--:**

**Jack:**
I'm so disappointed.
I thought it was Mom.

 
**Mash:**
Homunculus... You think it was the mage?

 
**Jack:**
The mage?
...No, it wasn't him.

 
**Jack:**
Anyways, let's go find Mom.
That's why we're here, right, Mommy?

 
**Mash:**
...Who did she mean by "him?"
Anyway, we should follow Jack.

 
**Jack:**
Mom, Mom, Mom...
I can't find her anywhere.

 
**Mash:**
...Excepting the Homunculus we encountered earlier, not one soul is walking in the streets, let alone your mother.

 
**Jack:**
Mommy, Mommy.
That's us over there.

 
**Mash:**
What?!

 
**Jack(?):**
I, I, I am Jack...the Ripper.
I am Jack the Ripper!

 
**Mash:**
That's...Jack the Ripper?!

 
**Jack:**
But Jack is us.

 
**Mash:**
Oh, no. I didn't mean that... Um, maybe I did.
Is that one a fake? Or the real one?

 
**Jack:**
I don't care.
I believe that we are the real one.

 
**Jack:**
That one believes that he is us.
So, we have no choice but to take him out.

 
**Jack:**
Now that we've met, we have to kill him so that we can prove we are us.

 
**Jack:**
Come on, let's get him&ndash; Mommy!


**--BATTLE--:**

**Jack:**
Jack is dead♪
We're dead, too♪

 
**Mash:**
Jack, that's a very disturbing song...

 
**Jack:**
...Hey, Mommy.

 
**Jack:**
If another Jack is&ndash;stronger than us,
what are you going to do?

 
**Jack:**
Are you going to dump us?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
No, I would never do that to you.
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Strength doesn't matter.
 


---
 
**Jack:**
...Are you sure?
But isn't that exactly how the Holy Grail War works?

 
**Jack:**
It isn't?
...Hm, okay. I'm wrong then.

 
**Jack:**
You're a weird person, Mommy.
Of course it's better to be stronger.

 
**Jack:**
You think so, too, don't you?

 
**Mash:**
No, Jack.
Neither Master nor I think that way.

 
**Mash:**
If we are to discuss being strong or weak, perhaps all of us are weak against our opponents.

 
**Mash:**
Of course, it'd be better if we were stronger.
But strength alone will not help us fight it out from here.

 
**Mash:**
I believe what we need is mutual trust.

 
**Mash:**
We fight with faith in our Master,
and Master fights having faith in us.

 
**Jack:**
...What a strange person you are. I have never met someone who would say things like that.

 
**Mash:**
Oh...really?

 
**Jack:**
But, sure, I like the way you think.
Look, the last Jack is right there.

 
**Jack:**
I'm sure he's much stronger than us.
Much wiser, much more vicious, and much more terrible.

 
**Jack:**
I'm sure that one is the real Jack the Ripper.

 
**Jack:**
The manifestation of everyone's fantasies&ndash;

 
**Jack:**
We might be nothing more than a monster who took advantage of that.

 
**Jack:**
...If you can still accept us,
we'll do what we can do. For your sake, Mommy.

 
**Jack:**
...Yeah, let's do it!


**--BATTLE--:**

**Mash:**
...The fog is clearing.
We've regained communication with the Doctor, too.

 
**Mash:**
Apparently, we can return to Chaldea now.
I'm going to prepare for our return.

 
**Jack:**
...Yes. We are officially Jack the Ripper now.

 
**Jack:**
A frowzy, bloodthirsty killer.
A monster that terrorized people in London&ndash;

 
**Jack:**
But still...this is our "name."

 
**Jack:**
Master, let's go back "home."
I want to eat a hamburg steak when we get back.


## Dozing Träumerei

**Narration:**
An age of prosperity is upon us.

 
**Narration:**
The great United Kingdom has become the dominant world power thanks to its booming second industrial revolution.

 
**Narration:**
Like a broken record, technology continues to rapidly outpace itself. Money changes hands throughout the world, continuing to grow with every transaction.

 
**Narration:**
Some grow rich, some grow conceited, some prey on others, some go rotten, some steal and rob, and some simply look on and sneer...

 
**Narration:**
An age of darkness is upon us.

 
**Narration:**
The weak are eaten alive as the systems that govern lives keep spreading poverty.

 
**Narration:**
People continue to die one after another. Men... Women... Children... Elderly... All of them, dead.

 
**Narration:**
In the end, only the rich survived...and they did so with glee.

 
**Narration:**
Smile.

 
**Narration:**
Keep a big, happy grin on your face.
Live the happiest life you can.

 
**Narration:**
These ideas are simply common sense for most people...
But not for those girls.

 
**Narration:**
Smile.

 
**Narration:**
...We pray that we are blamed, punished, and redeemed.

 
**Narration:**
By the way, you there.
Yes, you.

 
**Narration:**
Haven't you known for a long time that she was broken beyond repair?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...!


---
 
**C：???:**
Hang in there. Here, breathe with this handkerchief.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Where are we...?
 
**C：???:**
I believe we're in London. My name is Amakusa Shirou. Do you recognize me, Master?

 
**Amakusa Shirou:**
Oh good, so you do understand me. Wonderful.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Amakusa Shirou...?
 
**Amakusa Shirou:**
Yes, Master. We're in London now, and unfortunately, the situation doesn't seem good...

 


---
 
**Amakusa Shirou:**
I wish we could just head back to Chaldea now that you're awake...

 
**Amakusa Shirou:**
But unfortunately, I get the distinct impression that there's something we need to do first.

 
**Amakusa Shirou:**
There must be a reason why we ended up here.
Do you remember anything, Master?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Now that you mention it, I think I do...


---
 
**Jack:**
Yah!

 
**Mash:**
There, that's all the combat data we need.
Great job, Jack.

 
**Jack:**
Aww, it's over already?

 
**Jack:**
No faaair! We wanna play mooore!

 
**Mash:**
Um... Well, we could certainly always use more data.

 
**Mash:**
Would you be okay with that, Master?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Fine with me.
 
**Jack:**
Yay! Then let's go somewhere different!

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Are you sure you can keep going?
 
**Jack:**
Sure I'm sure!

 
**Mash:**
Okay then, just give me a second.

 
**Jack:**
Ooh, and we want a different place, too!

 


---
 
**Mash:**
You got it.
Here, you can choose from these.

 
**Jack:**
Hmm, now where should we go...?

 
**Jack:**
Hmm... Hmm...
...Huh?

 
**Jack:**
Where's “Shinjookoo”?

 
**Mash:**
Shinjuku is an area in Tokyo, the capital city of a country called Japan.

 
**Jack:**
Let's go there then! It looks like fun!

 
**Mash:**
Understood. Just give me a moment, and I'll go ahead and change the location then.

 
**Mash:**
Let's also change the enemies to match, and...

 
**Mash:**
There you go.

 
**Jack:**
Ooh... Wow...

 
**Jack:**
It's so pretty here! We think we like it!

 
**Mash:**
O-oh yeah?

 
**Jack:**
It's rough, and trashy...and perfect!

 
**Jack:**
We bet there's all sorts of dead people here, and unhappy people here...

 
**Jack:**
And... And...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Uh... Jack?


---
 
**Jack:**
...Huh?

 
**Jack:**
That's weird. That's really weird.

 
**Jack:**
We don't know this city. We're sure we've never been here before.

 
**Jack:**
So then...why do we understand it so well?

 
**Mash:**
Jack!?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Easy there!
 
**Jack:**
No.
No, no, no.

 
**Jack:**
We're not like that anymore.
We're not!

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Are you okay? What's going on?
 
**Jack:**
Nothing... It's nothing.
Don't worry, Mommy, we're fine!

 
**Jack:**
...Ghh... Khh...!

 


---
 
**Jack:**
...Oh no.

 
**Jack:**
We've gotta go back.
We've gotta go back right now!

 
**Mash:**
Is this...a high-density magical energy reaction!?
Master, get away from there!

 
**Mash:**
And hurry!

 
**Jack:**
...!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Jack!?


---
 
**Amakusa Shirou:**
And when you came to, you found yourself here, huh? Now I see.

 
**Amakusa Shirou:**
...That's right. I remember now too. I was planning to use the combat simulator right after.

 
**Amakusa Shirou:**
But then there was some kind of error right before I went to take my turn, and the next thing I knew, I was here.

 
**Amakusa Shirou:**
Whatever's going on, it sounds like Jack has something to do with it.

 
**Amakusa Shirou:**
Then I guess we'd better go look for her.
But first...

 
**Amakusa Shirou:**
We should take care of these guys.
Let's get this combat simulation started, shall we?


**--BATTLE--:**

**Narration:**
...We reach for the light, but always fall short.
We reach for the darkness, only to find more than we can carry.

 
**Narration:**
Looking back now, the only memories we can recall involve pain and suffering.

 
**Narration:**
We wanted someone to help us, but we just kept dying before we knew what was happening.

 
**Narration:**
We died like we were being squashed out of existence, and disappeared like we were being ground into nothingness.

 
**Narration:**
We're the victims of society, and its sworn enemy.

 
**Narration:**
Who can we blame for that?

 
**Jack:**
Huh?
This is...

 
**C：???:**
Yes, this is where you were born. Or maybe I should say it's where you never grew up!

 
**Jack:**
Huh? Nursery?

 
**Nursery Rhyme(?):**
No, I am not Nursery Rhyme.

 
**Nursery Rhyme(?):**
I just transformed into someone you wouldn't want to have to fight.

 
**Nursery Rhyme(?):**
I'm actually retribution.

 
**Nursery Rhyme(?):**
You're going to atone for all those people you killed.

 
**Jack:**
...!

 
**Nursery Rhyme(?):**
Are you going to run away from your sins?
Are you going to refuse your just deserts?

 
**Jack:**
...Stop it.

 
**Nursery Rhyme(?):**
Oh no I won't! You need to die for what you've done! It's your duty!

 
**Jack:**
Stop it... Stop it!
Don't say things like that!

 
**Nursery Rhyme(?):**
You can't run away forever!

 
**Nursery Rhyme(?):**
You're a miniature hell that's been dropped into this world...

 
**Nursery Rhyme(?):**
So you need to accept your punishment and disappear!

 
**Amakusa Shirou:**
...So Master, what I'm about to tell you may sound somewhat random, but I promise you it's relevant to our current situation.

 
**Amakusa Shirou:**
I'm not sure if you already know this, but just in case you don't...

 
**Amakusa Shirou:**
Jack the Ripper is an unusual case, even among Servants.

 
**Amakusa Shirou:**
She's basically more like an evil ghost than a person.
Don't misunderstand. I'm not saying that to be mean.

 
**Amakusa Shirou:**
But the fact is, in truth she is an evil spirit born from the city of London itself...

 
**Amakusa Shirou:**
...and Jack the Ripper is just the skin the spirit has chosen to wear.

 
**Amakusa Shirou:**
What's more, that particular trait is something wholly unique to her, at least as far as I know.

 
**Amakusa Shirou:**
While I have heard rumors that another criminal has been summoned among the Berserkers...

 
**Amakusa Shirou:**
...I feel fairly confident in saying that our Jack is the only one who appears this young.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
But she's still smart, right?
 
**Amakusa Shirou:**
Oh yes, she's very wise. To put it another way, she's a very quick thinker.

 
**Amakusa Shirou:**
Of course, you could also say that most Servants are wise, whether they look like children or not.

 
**Amakusa Shirou:**
Incidentally, I'm pretty sure that wisdom is not something she had while she was still alive, so to speak.

 
**Amakusa Shirou:**
If anything, it's like... Well, crowd wisdom.

 
**Amakusa Shirou:**
Regardless, she's a child now, and deserves to enjoy all that that confers.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I have to say, she's pretty sweet for an evil spirit.
 
**Amakusa Shirou:**
Oh yes, absolutely.

 
**Amakusa Shirou:**
She may be brutal and merciless towards her enemies, but you could say the same of most any Servant.

 
**Amakusa Shirou:**
If anything, it's extremely heartwarming to see her trying to enjoy her life with such childlike wonderment.

 


---
 
**D：???:**
...But she's also a murderer, remember?

 
**Amakusa Shirou:**
!

 
**Amakusa Shirou:**
I suggest you stand back a bit, Master.

 
**Amakusa Shirou:**
Sorry for drawing my Black Keys so suddenly.
If you don't mind my asking, who are you?

 
**D：???:**
Me? Hmm... I suppose you can call me “Ms. London.”

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Ms. London...?
 
**Ms. London:**
Not that my name particularly matters.

 
**Ms. London:**
Now then, are you ready to face reality?

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I know that she's killed people before, Ms. London.
 
**Ms. London:**
Of course. It's right in her name, after all.
But you mustn't turn away from that fact either.

 


---
 
**Amakusa Shirou:**
...It would seem you're not here to fight us then.
I apologize for my earlier actions.

 
**Amakusa Shirou:**
...Hmm.

 
**Amakusa Shirou:**
Master, this is just my intuition speaking,
but I think we should let her come with us.

 
**Amakusa Shirou:**
I think that's what she wants too.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Got it.


---
 
**Ms. London:**
...Thank you. I'm glad we were able to reach an understanding so quickly.

 
**Ms. London:**
It is as you said. I would like to accompany you two.

 
**Ms. London:**
It doesn't matter what I am, or why I am.

 
**Ms. London:**
While I'm sure it won't be straightforward to do so,
right now, I would ask that you think only of saving that child.

 
**Amakusa Shirou:**
Looks like we've found an obstacle already.

 
**Amakusa Shirou:**
Once we're done with them, I'm hoping you'll tell us more about what it is you want.

 
**Amakusa Shirou:**
Now then, shall we, Master!?


**--BATTLE--:**

**Ms. London:**
Jack is one of London's many victims.

 
**Amakusa Shirou:**
Yes, that sounds right.

 
**Ms. London:**
She's a poor, pitiful being, fully deserving of our compassion. That's why it's no surprise she sought revenge.

 
**Amakusa Shirou:**
Hold on. That doesn't sound quite right.

 
**Amakusa Shirou:**
If someone had killed her, then her taking revenge on them would make perfect sense.

 
**Amakusa Shirou:**
Though of course, if we happened to be there, both Master and I would try to stop her from doing so.

 
**Amakusa Shirou:**
But taking revenge on someone who didn't kill her makes no sense at all.

 
**Amakusa Shirou:**
That's just lashing out.

 
**Ms. London:**
True. But as someone whose name escapes me once said...

 
**Ms. London:**
...victimhood can be used to legitimize any number of evils.

 
**Amakusa Shirou:**
...That's true.

 
**Amakusa Shirou:**
I must admit that it is all too common for one to use one's position as a victim&ndash;or the appearance thereof&ndash;as a weapon.

 
**Ms. London:**
That is the sort of line Jack is walking right now.

 
**Ms. London:**
Please, stop her before she crosses it.

 
**Narration:**
...We're standing at the edge of an abyss.

 
**Narration:**
 
Somebody is whispering in our ear, telling us we'll feel much better if we just jump off.

 
**Narration:**
 
They say we deserve pity because we were murdered.

 
**Narration:**
 
Killed by our parents, our doctors, society, and by who knows what else.

 
**Nursery Rhyme(?):**
You can't always run away, you know?

 
**Nursery Rhyme(?):**
If you don't come clean with your sins,
they'll just keep piling up!

 
**Narration:**
 
Shut up. We didn't do anything wrong.

 
**Narration:**
 
We only seek retribution. You're the ones who are punishing us after you went and made us like this.

 
**Nursery Rhyme(?):**
Yes, you may be right. In fact, you almost certainly are! But does that mean it's okay for you to kill others?

 
**Narration:**
...Yes. It has to be.

 
**Narration:**
 
It has to be okay to get back at people.
It has to be okay to take revenge.

 
**Narration:**
 
We're... We're so...

 
**Nursery Rhyme(?):**
...
...

 
**Jack:**
We'll...kill you.

 
**???:**
...Now, now. You mustn't go around killing like that.

 
**Narration:**
 
We hear a clear, kind voice.

 
**Narration:**
 
We turn around to see someone shrouded in hazy mist.

 
**Narration:**
 
And yet, for some reason,
seeing them made us stop in our tracks.

 
**Jack:**
...Who are you?

 
**???:**
 
Hehe, it doesn't matter who I am. Just listen to me, okay?

 
**???:**
 
I know you've all been through a lot. It's more than anyone should have to bear.

 
**???:**
 
You could blame all living creatures for conspiring to make your lives miserable, and you wouldn't be wrong to do so.

 
**???:**
 
But if you use that as an excuse to hurt others,
it will end up hurting all of you, too.

 
**Jack:**
It will...?

 
**???:**
 
You're broken even now, but not in a sense that makes you dangerous or evil.

 
**???:**
 
But if you start hurting other people...
If you start to think it's right for you to do so...

 
**???:**
 
...then one day, you'll end up completely falling apart.

 
**Jack:**
How can you tell?

 
**???:**
 
I'm not sure either.
But you know I'm right, don't you?

 
**Jack:**
...
...

 
**Nursery Rhyme(?):**
What's wrong?
Aren't you going to hate them back?

 
**Doctor:**
Don't you remember how many of you those doctors killed?

 
**Aristocrat:**
Don't you remember how those men who made you never even looked twice at you?

 
**Nameless People:**
Don't you remember how the living couldn't have cared less about you?

 
**Jack:**
Ngh... Khh...!

 
**Narration:**
 
It pisses us off. It's so infuriating. The more we think we have to shrug it off, the angrier we get.

 
**Narration:**
 
Whoever this person is, they're right.
We didn't do anything wrong.

 
**Narration:**
So why should we...?
Why shouldn't we...?

 
**???:**
 
That's not right either, Jack.

 
**???:**
 
Your anger, your frustrations, your regrets... They're fine as they are. Those are things all living beings need to reflect on.

 
**???:**
 
...Just like how you can't stop to linger unless you've been constantly seeking something, some things can't be seen unless you have regrets.

 
**???:**
 
And now...what you've been seeking is here.

 
**Jack:**
Huh?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Jack!


---
 
**Jack:**
Mommy! And...Amakusa Shirou?

 
**Amakusa Shirou:**
Aha, now I see.

 
**Amakusa Shirou:**
Ms. London, was it?

 
**Amakusa Shirou:**
Could you be London itself, just as your name suggests?

 
**Ms. London:**
Yes...and no.

 
**Jack:**
Huh? Is that the same person we've been talking to here?

 
**Amakusa Shirou:**
Nonsensical though that may sound, it does look that way.

 
**Amakusa Shirou:**
She must have wanted to help you very much indeed.

 
**Jack:**
...Hmm, okay.

 
**Nursery Rhyme(?):**
So, there are more chirping songbirds here now.
But that doesn't matter.

 
**Amakusa Shirou:**
Hmm.

 
**Amakusa Shirou:**
You're not actually Nursery Rhyme, are you?

 
**Jack:**
Ah! We thought so!

 
**Amakusa Shirou:**
She may be anyone and no one, but she would never transform into adults who have given up on their dreams.

 
**Amakusa Shirou:**
Hmm. So that must mean...

 
**Amakusa Shirou:**
...you read Jack's memories and chose to look like someone who would make a good victim. Am I right?

 
**Nursery Rhyme(?):**
Wow, that's amazing! It's like watching a great detective in action!

 
**Amakusa Shirou:**
Lamentably, I lack a certain gentleman's facility with the violin.

 
**Nursery Rhyme(?):**
But it doesn't matter that you've figured me out. I'll still be a victim as long as I look like this!

 
**Amakusa Shirou:**
Hmm.

 
**Amakusa Shirou:**
I'd be very interested to figure out what you truly are, but for now, I'll settle for just defeating you.

 
**Amakusa Shirou:**
Do you think you can beat her, Jack?

 
**Jack:**
But...
But she's...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
It's okay, Jack.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
That girl there? She's nobody.


---
 
**Jack:**
Huh?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
She's neither a victim nor a victimizer.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
She's just someone we have to beat to get out of this dream.


---
 
**Jack:**
Oh, yeah.

 
**Jack:**
Now we get it. We have to get out of here so you can leave too, right, Mommy?

 
**Amakusa Shirou:**
Yes, that's very true. Not to mention the real Nursery Rhyme, and your other friends, would be very sad without you.

 
**Jack:**
Oh no, we don't like that.
We don't want them to be sad.

 
**Amakusa Shirou:**
Right? So then, there's only one thing left to do.

 
**Jack:**
Yeah, you're right.
...Okay! We'll dismember her!


**--BATTLE--:**

**Nursery Rhyme(?):**
...Aww, too bad.

 
**Nursery Rhyme(?):**
I was so sure my society would have been perfect if I had just embedded you conceptually into it as an aggressor.

 
**Amakusa Shirou:**
Now I see. How very unusual.

 
**Amakusa Shirou:**
I never would have thought the residual data from our combat simulations would gain consciousness and try to create its own society.

 
**Amakusa Shirou:**
Maybe you inadvertently copied a strange spell or two when you made this perfect recreation of London?

 
**Amakusa Shirou:**
Given how close this location is to the Clock Tower, I'm not surprised recreating it could lead to some oddities.

 
**Nursery Rhyme(?):**
I guess I'll have to choose the next place I recreate more carefully then.

 
**Nursery Rhyme(?):**
All right... See you later, Ms. Perpetual Victim.

 
**Jack:**
Bye-bye!

 
**Nursery Rhyme(?):**
...Ugh, this is so disappointing.

 
**Ms. London:**
Well, that's a relief.

 
**Jack:**
You are 
 
**Ms. London:**
I'm nobody, Jack. Though if I had to pick something, I suppose I'd say I'm London's conscience.

 
**Ms. London:**
No matter how coarse human society's systems may be, or how inferior its character...

 
**Ms. London:**
...the fact remains that everyone has at least a little conscience in them.

 
**Ms. London:**
The same concept was present even in the society that that Nursery Rhyme made.

 
**Amakusa Shirou:**
That still leaves a few questions unanswered though.

 
**Amakusa Shirou:**
For example, why are you a woman?
Why did you choose that particular personality?

 
**Ms. London:**
Well...

 
**Jack:**
Is it because you're a mommy,
even if you're not our Mommy?

 
**Ms. London:**
...You know, I like that interpretation.
Yes, let's go with that.

 
**Ms. London:**
I'm someone you've dreamed about.

 
**Ms. London:**
Someone who loves and accepts you unconditionally, and who wouldn't hesitate to take a bullet for you if necessary.

 
**Ms. London:**
Someone who, once upon a time, just might have been your Master in a Holy Grail War.

 
**Ms. London:**
Yes, I think that's just a lovely dream...
A Träumerei.

 
**Jack:**
Nn...

 
**Ms. London:**
Now, it's time to wake up from this simulation, and go back home.

 
**Ms. London:**
Will you be okay now, Jack?

 
**Jack:**
...Yeah. We think we'll make do.

 
**Amakusa Shirou:**
Oh good, it looks like our comms are back online. This seems as good a time as any to exit the simulation then.

 
**Amakusa Shirou:**
Farewell, Ms. London.

**Fujimaru 1:**
Goodbye!
 
**Ms. London:**
Goodbye, everyone.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Thank you for showing us the way.
 
**Ms. London:**
Not at all. I'm the one who should be thanking you.

**Jack:**
...
...

 
**Ms. London:**
Oh my. What's wrong, Jack?

 
**Jack:**
Well, um... We think...

 
**Jack:**
...we're really glad...we got to meet you.

 
**Jack:**
Maybe we still haven't met you yet, or maybe we already did...

 
**Jack:**
But now that we've met you, we...
On second thought, never mind that part.

 
**Jack:**
We think...we're gonna try a little harder.

 
**Jack:**
Goodbye, Mystery Lady.

 
**Ms. London:**
Goodbye, Jack the Ripper. May you be happy to your final breath.

 
**Jack:**
Um, Mommy? We're sorry for what happened today.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
That's okay. How are you doing now?


---
 
**Jack:**
We're not sure.

 
**Jack:**
We don't really get humanity, and we don't have any reason to work hard for them.

 
**Jack:**
We even think the world might be better off if they were gone.

 
**Jack:**
But right now, we're having fun. We're happy.

 
**Jack:**
Not to mention, if that mysterious lady is out there somewhere...

 
**Jack:**
...No, even if she's gone now, and there's only traces of her left somewhere on this planet...

 
**Jack:**
We think we have to do the best we can.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Thanks, Jack.
 
**Jack:**
You're welcome, Mommy!

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Then let's all do our best together, okay?
 
**Jack:**
Yeah... Yeah, let's!
We promise we'll try really, really hard!

 
**Jack:**
So, maybe...we can still dream together too! Okay, Mommy?

**Narration:**
...When one person kills another, that person is indelibly marked with sin.

 
**Narration:**
In that sense, she has long been a grave sinner, and always will be.

 
**Narration:**
But you can also look at it this way.

 
**Narration:**
Now that those victims have all come together as a single entity in the form of Jack the Ripper...

 
**Narration:**
...they've finally been given the right to dream.

 
**Narration:**
As she nods off by the young [♂ man's /♀️ woman's} side,
she can hear happy, peaceful music playing nearby.

 
**Narration:**
The kind of music...that children dream about.
