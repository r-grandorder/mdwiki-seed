# Medusa Lily

## The Three Friendly Gorgon Sisters

**Mash:**
Oh? Isn't that...?

 
**Euryale:**
Hellooo, Medusa.
Quit spacing out.

 
**Euryale:**
That tea is way beyond steeped.
We don't want bitter tea!

 
**Stheno:**
You're right. The moment of tea perfection has already passed. If only you were the normal Medusa...

 
**Stheno:**
She may be gangly and graceless, but at least she never missed the right time to pour the tea.

 
**Stheno:**
You should be more mindful of your size.
Some things you can't do on speed alone.

 
**Medusa:**
My apologies, big older sister, little older sister.
I was too focused on the hourglass...

 
**Medusa:**
Here is your tea. Little older sister prefers one scoop of sugar, correct?

 
**Euryale:**
Yes. Just a bit...only a little bit...

 
**Stheno:**
That will be enough, Medusa.
We shall have our tea.

 
**Euryale:**
 
...Hey, what IS this!?
This tastes terrible!

 
**Stheno:**
You mustn't be so harsh, me.
Our younger sister is doing her best.

 
**Stheno:**
Then again, it is truly disgusting. The problem isn't how it was made, but that she used bad tea leaves.

 
**Stheno:**
Medusa.
Where did you get this tea from?

 
**Medusa:**
I-I'm terribly sorry! I used a pretty golden can that I found in the reception room.

 
**Stheno:**
I see. At least you took some minimal effort. But if you want to find good tea, go to the doctor's clinic.

 
**Stheno:**
That man stashes away good Chinese tea. You should also learn how to properly prepare tea from him.

 
**Euryale:**
I hate Chinese tea.
You can only mix honey with it! ...I-I mean...

 
**Euryale:**
If you are to steep black tea, you should use soft water that's free of minerals. Why in the world did you decide to use hard water, Medusa?

 
**Medusa:**
...Um, was that bad?

 
**Medusa:**
I thought it was for the best to splurge on mineral water...

 
**Euryale:**
Mineral water!? What a terrible rookie mistake, even for you, Medusa!

 
**Euryale:**
You must go to Japan. Japan! You shall learn about soft water, and the proper essential rules for preparing black tea there!

 
**Medusa:**
...I see.
Please forgive me for being so ignorant...

 
**Mash:**
...It appears the sisters are having tea.

 
**Mash:**
Whenever the young Medusa is with us...

 
**Mash:**
...she seems so mature and composed...

 
**Mash:**
But watching her right now, she seems to be acting her age, or at least the age she appears to be.

 
**Mash:**
Although...

 
**Stheno:**
Oh, it's Master and Mash.
Are you here because you missed us so?

 
**Euryale:**
So much that even a brief moment apart is agony?
Teehee, you are so cute, Master.

 
**Medusa:**
Oh...hello, Master, Mash.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...They weren't bullying you, were they?


---
 
**Medusa:**
N-no, absolutely not.
This is all because of how immature I am!

 
**Medusa:**
And...actually, I'm a little happy about...this. There's no problem.

 
**Mash:**
...?

 
**Medusa:**
To tell you the truth, it took a very long time for me to be able to speak to my sisters, even after I was summoned to Chaldea.

 
**Medusa:**
Until now, all I could do was watch from afar...because I was scared.

 
**Medusa:**
I was created by an irregularity in history.

 
**Medusa:**
I'm here as a product of a miraculous coincidence and humanity's warped timeline...

 
**Medusa:**
I am the Medusa who is not an Anti-Hero...someone who should never have existed in the first place.

 
**Medusa:**
And I had no idea how my older sisters would react when they saw me.

 
**Medusa:**
I wouldn't have known what to do had they ignored me, or if they said I was not their younger sister...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...


---
 
**Medusa:**
Oh, please don't look so glum, Master.

 
**Medusa:**
It turned out that I was worrying needlessly.

 
**Medusa:**
My older sisters call me by my name and treat me as their younger sister.

 
**Medusa:**
And that...makes me happy.

 
**Mash:**
I-I see...
Um, if I may point out...

 
**Mash:**
Since Stheno and Euryale are goddesses...

 
**Mash:**
...we know that they have a tendency to be very...intense and often make impossible requests...

 
**Mash:**
And, well, when it comes to their treatment of Medusa... Um, it seems they don't really hold back when it comes to their own family...

 
**Mash:**
Sometimes it's painful to see what unfolds...

 
**Medusa:**
Family members...I see...

 
**Medusa:**
...

 
**Mash:**
But perhaps it's all right if Medusa doesn't mind...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
We should intervene if it goes too far.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Different things make different people happy...


---
 
**Mash:**
You're...right...

 
**Euryale:**
Hellooo! How much longer are you two going to be whispering over there!?

 
**Stheno:**
Mash, Master, would you two like some tea? I'll have to warn you that it will be a poor cup of tea prepared by our failure of a younger sister.

 
**Medusa:**
I will prepare it right away. Please wait a minute.

 
**Euryale:**
You really are impossible, Medusa. Get us some new snacks, too. I know there are some on top of the cabinet over there.

 
**Euryale:**
We cannot possibly reach them ourselves, frail and delicate as we are, but you're a huge woman whose nickname was Big Mountain of the Shapeless Isle...

 
**Medusa:**
Um, I'll need to borrow this step stool...

 
**Medusa:**
And stack these boxes...

 
**Medusa:**
(Huff...puff...)
Reeeach...got it!

 
**Euryale:**
...

 
**Stheno:**
You know, thinking on it, I believe we stored a cookie jar under the floor.

 
**Stheno:**
But, Medusa, be careful of that enormous body of yours. You might get stuck down there if you so much as stretch your arms or legs.

 
**Medusa:**
Here, right? I can't reach, so I'll just crawl under to find it... (Rummage, rummage) ...Whew. I found it.

 
**Stheno:**
...

 
**Medusa:**
...Is something the matter?

 
**Euryale:**
...Agh! This is so frustrating!

 
**Euryale:**
Why is this Medusa so small!?

 
**Medusa:**
...I wonder. This form...it seems to be how I was before Athena cursed me.

 
**Medusa:**
It's frustrating that I'm so young and powerless, but...

 
**Medusa:**
...I am still happy.

 
**Medusa:**
I didn't get to spend much time with my sisters in this form, you see...

 
**Medusa:**
Having a chance to spend time with them like this is so new to me...

 
**Mash:**
...I see. I know that Medusa was concerned that her form is an irregular one...

 
**Mash:**
But it appears that it's not all bad.

 
**Stheno:**
Happy, you say, Medusa?
Did you hear that, me?

 
**Euryale:**
I did hear that, me. I can hardly believe what our foolish sister just said.

 
**Euryale:**
I heard her saying she's happy to take OUR role as the small, cute goddess for herself!

 
**Medusa:**
Wha...!? N-no! That wasn't what I meant!

 
**Euryale:**
Oh...oh, my. How could you treat your older sisters this way, when all we've done was treat you with kindness and compassion...

 
**Stheno:**
True... But such an idea as this couldn't be something Medusa concocted alone.

 
**Stheno:**
There must be someone else who should be persecuted as her coconspirator...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Could that be...me...?

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
(Attempt to avert gaze)
 


---
 
**Stheno:**
The Master is responsible for their Servants.
Isn't that how it works here?

 
**Euryale:**
This entire Servant system is wrong to begin with.

 
**Euryale:**
To have goddesses like ourselves manifest in this world only to be used as Servants to fight is just such a horrid idea.

 
**Euryale:**
We aren't able to fight, and we could starve if we were left alone. We are the eternal girls who cannot live without help from others... That is who we are.

 
**Stheno:**
Oh...perhaps that's why...

 
**Mash:**
...?

 
**Stheno:**
Medusa has manifested in this world with our usual cuteness. We manifested here with the power to fight, something that isn't really innate to us.

 
**Stheno:**
There is a possibility that the three of us took the attractive features away from one another to make it our own.

 
**Euryale:**
...I see. What a profound statement, me.
Then we must confirm your hypothesis!

 
**Stheno:**
Yes, let's move to a different location, me.

 
**Medusa:**
...? Um, big older sister and little older sister...to where?

 
**Stheno:**
Quiet, you!
You don't get to refuse.

 
**Medusa:**
...Where are we?

 
**Mash:**
This is Chaldea's training ground.

 
**Euryale:**
We can go all-out here.

 
**Stheno:**
Yes, just something to punish our younger sister and Master who took something precious away from us and gave us something useless in exchange.

 
**Stheno:**
I'll warn you that you mustn't hold back, Medusa. We're doing this to test out fighting abilities, too.

 
**Medusa:**
B-but...!

 
**Euryale:**
Now, let's begin.

 
**Euryale:**
Honestly, playing with our little sister like this is new to us, too!

 
**--BATTLE--:**

**Euryale:**
...

 
**Euryale:**
I can't believe!
They really hit us!

 
**Stheno:**
Ah... So, it's true...
No one likes us...

 
**Stheno:**
To be defeated by the cute, stylish, and maybe overly romantic version of our younger sister...

 
**Medusa:**
Y-you have it all wrong, big older sister and little older sister! You said I shouldn't hold back...

 
**Euryale:**
We were just saying that! Ugh, do we have to spell EVERYTHING out for you!?

 
**Euryale:**
The younger sister CANNOT be better than her older sisters!

 
**Medusa:**
Ow...ow...

 
**Mash:**
Oh...she's pulling Medusa's cheek really hard...

 
**Stheno:**
...Now that I think about it,
using Charm against Medusa was pointless.

 
**Medusa:**
A-actually! It hit me really good! B-because...well...because my older sisters were too cute...it was so intense...

 
**Stheno:**
Oh? How could you let such lies pass through your lips? How dare you!?

 
**Medusa:**
Ow...ow...ah...ahh...

 
**Mash:**
Oh...and now they're tugging her other cheek...

 
**Euryale:**
But now we know...our battle skills really are only so-so.

 
**Stheno:**
Yes. It appears violent battles really are Medusa's only skill.

 
**Medusa:**
...Of course. If something were to happen, I would step in to solve the problem, and be sure to do so without bothering my older sisters.

 
**Medusa:**
But I'm sorry... With this small body of mine,
I'm not sure how much I can be of help...

 
**Stheno:**
Oh, my. Did you hear that, me?

 
**Stheno:**
Medusa just flat-out admitted that she stole the title of cutest goddess from us.

 
**Euryale:**
Oh yes, I heard, me.

 
**Euryale:**
Isn't that like boasting you got paid, even though you skived off work? I believe that's quite unfair.

 
**Stheno:**
It may be nice...but let's put that topic aside. There is just one thing I can't accept as the older sister.

 
**Stheno:**
I really must say that we simply must do something about you being so small. It's not right to have you be the same size as us.

 
**Mash:**
Well...isn't that just something that can't be changed...?

 
**Euryale:**
...

 
**Euryale:**
Oh, I know. I vaguely remember being with a super big person recently.

 
**Euryale:**
Our problem is because the three of us are lined up together.

 
**Euryale:**
If there was another person who is even bigger, Medusa's annoying short stature shouldn't stand out.

 
**Stheno:**
Good idea. But is there someone who would fit the bill?

 
**Euryale:**
Leave it to me! We're at the training ground.
If I do this...and press this...

 
**Mash:**
Ah...um, Euryale!
That button starts up the training program...!

 
**Euryale:**
I know. I'm just bringing up something big to test our theory. I'm as smart as I am cute... You know, I sometimes scare myself♪

 
**Euryale:**
Size? MAX, of course! Difficulty? I don't know what that means, but “Super Difficult Mode” sounds good!

 
**Mash:**
U-um!

 
**Euryale:**
That'll do it. And...start♪

 
**Euryale:**
...Huh?

 
**Stheno:**
Me. It's big, but I think it's TOO big...

 
**???:**
 
...!!!

 
**Mash:**
I think...maybe...all that button mashing made it go berserk! It's coming at us without any limiters!

 
**Medusa:**
...Older sisters, watch out!

 
**Medusa:**
Begone...!
I won't let you lay a finger on my sisters!


**--BATTLE--:**

**Medusa:**
...Whew. I managed to defeat them.
How are my older sisters...?

 
**Medusa:**
Oh...I'm so glad...

 
**Mash:**
Medusa!?
Oh no... She's collapsed from her wounds...!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Let's carry her to the infirmary.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Let's treat her right away.
 
**Mash:**
But we lack the first aid here...

 
**Mash:**
The best thing to do is to transport her to an appropriate place for treatment, Senpai. Let's go.

 


---
 
**Stheno:**
I can't believe she went down before us. Look at that face... She looks like she thinks she just did something really great.

 
**Euryale:**
...I agree. She shouldn't look so smug.

 
**Mash:**
U-um, she's injured, so would you please not pull her cheek right now?

 
**Mash:**
We need to take her to the infirmary.
Please, step aside...I'm going to...

 
**Stheno:**
No need. This is the result of our foolish younger sister's carelessness. It's something her family should take care of.

 
**Euryale:**
Indeed. Making her two older sisters go through so much trouble...she really is a dumb, clumsy, and good-for-nothing younger sister.

 
**Euryale:**
If Mash takes her, she won't know how much trouble she caused for us when she finally wakes up, now will she?

 
**Euryale:**
For her to owe us...to remind her that she will always be beneath her older sisters, I will carry her. I don't want to, but I will.

 
**Mash:**
(Oh...they've lined up side-by-side...and the two of them are carrying Medusa on their backs...)

 
**Medusa:**
Unhhh...older...sisters...

 
**Stheno:**
...If there's a silver lining for Medusa having this form...

 
**Euryale:**
Yes... If she was a giant, the two of us wouldn't have been able to carry her like this.

 
**Stheno:**
...If she was a giant, what would we have done...?

 
**Euryale:**
...We probably would have rolled her like a barrel.

 
**Mash:**
...Senpai. There are times when watching Stheno and Euryale's banter worries me...

 
**Mash:**
But I feel that a lot of the reason they behave that way is because of the absolute, unwavering confidence in their bonds with each other.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
They're family.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
They have a bond.
 


---
 
**Mash:**
Yes. Even if one of them looks different than before, the fact that they are family will never change.

 
**Mash:**
No matter what, they are a trio of sisters who get along very well!
