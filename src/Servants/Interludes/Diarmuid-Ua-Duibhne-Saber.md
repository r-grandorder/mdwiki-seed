# Diarmuid Ua Duibhne (Saber)

## Arrival of Twin Swords

**Kiyohime:**
A killer...you say?

**Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:**
Indeed.

**Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:**
I know little about the workings of the “simulator,” but I do know that a mysterious killer has been appearing there as of late.

**Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:**
It is fortunate that this began during Master's absence, as they were quite a formidable foe...

**Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:**
At any rate, we must remain on the alert.
Would you be so kind as to inform Master?

**Kiyohime:**
Y-yes, of course.

**Kiyohime:**
Although, um, why did you choose to
approach me about this, Lord Tajima?

**Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:**
Now then, if you will excuse me.

**Kiyohime:**
W-w-wait! Just a moment, Lord Tajima!

**Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:**
Is there a problem?

**Kiyohime:**
Well, um...

**Kiyohime:**
I just wanted to make sure...

**Kiyohime:**
You say this killer appearing in the simulator is not what they call an “NPC”?

**Kiyohime:**
Do I have that right?

**Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:**
That is correct.

**Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:**
This person possessed the aura of a true
swordsman...to an extraordinary degree...

**Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:**
It was just yesterday that I encountered them.

**Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:**
I was taking a walk in the simulator when...

**Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:**
...Who goes there?

**Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:**
Show yourself.
I can tell you are no mere enn-pee-see.

**Mysterious Swordsman:**
...

**Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:**
So, you are bereft of speech.
Or perhaps, you were born without a mouth.

**Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:**
I am trained in Otomeryu. Ordinarily, it is not meant to be seen by the eyes of commoners...

**Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:**
...but now that the Tokugawa shogunate no longer holds sway, and I am a mere shadow of the true Tajima...

**Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:**
...I see little point in letting
such concerns stay my blade.

**Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:**
So be warned.
Draw nearer, and I will cut you down.

**Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:**
...!

**Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:**
Impressive.

**Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:**
I must say...

**Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:**
...your swordsmanship is a sight to behold.
No human could make use of such a technique.

**Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:**
You must be some manner of monster.

**Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:**
Or perhaps...a curse that has gained consciousness.

**Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:**
...Regrettably, I was unable to
settle our duel before they left.

**Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:**
It appeared they were dissatisfied with my swordsmanship.

**Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:**
Yes... I had the distinct impression
that one blade is not enough for them.

**Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:**
It was as though they were searching for an opponent who wields two blades instead.

**Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:**
I imagine they were taking the form of a dead man's essence, much like we Heroic Spirits.

**Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:**
But now, they must have lost sight of who they are, and so have turned on those of us who carry blades of our own. What a pity.

**Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:**
...And so they have devolved into some
mindless killer wandering the simulator.

**Kiyohime:**
...So it is basically rogue data that is
similar to a Heroic Spirit. Understood!

**Kiyohime:**
I'll go tell Master right now!
And I'll let Da Vinci and Mash know, too!

**Kiyohime:**
...And that's everything Lord Tajima told me!

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I see. Thanks, Kiyohime.

**Kiyohime:**
You're welcome, Master!


---

**Fujimaru 2:**
He could've just told me himself...

**Kiyohime:**
He said it's because he doesn't
know much about the simulator...


---

**Mash:**
So...does this mean there's a bug in the simulator...?

**Da Vinci:**
Our scans haven't picked up anything, but the main point of the simulator is to project Heroic Spirits' Spirit Origins.

**Da Vinci:**
With all that intricate data in the registry, it's entirely possible that a bit could have gotten scrambled somewhere and caused a problem.

**Da Vinci:**
Besides, Yagyu Tajima-no-kami's one of the best swordsmen who ever lived, right?

**Da Vinci:**
If he felt like this thing wasn't just a normal NPC, I'm inclined to take him at his word. Something must be wrong.

**Da Vinci:**
Hmm. Welp! Guess we'll just have to run some comprehensive emergency system diagnostics!

**Diarmuid:**
...Master.

**Kiyohime:**
Oh, hello, Lord Diarmuid.
What brings you here?

**Diarmuid:**
If I may, I would ask that you
please take me to the simulator.

**Diarmuid:**
I think I might have an idea
as to who this miscreant may be.

**Mash:**
Okay, Senpai, Diarmuid.
The simulator is up and running with no trouble so far.

**Mash:**
I'll be monitoring the entire system from here in real time, but please let me know if you see anything amiss.

**Mash:**
There aren't currently any NPCs in that area, so there shouldn't be anything unusual happening.

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Got it.


---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Thanks, Mash.


---

**Diarmuid:**
If my instincts are correct...

**Diarmuid:**
...we should encounter our target soon,
even if this place is meant to be deserted.

**Mash:**
Are you sure, Diarmuid? I've confirmed that your area is cut off from all external access...

**Diarmuid:**
Yes, I'm sure.

**Diarmuid:**
Whoever this is, they won't pass up their chance to find what they're searching for.

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...Can you tell me?


---

**Fujimaru 2:**
What are they searching for?


---

**Diarmuid:**
...Me.

**Mash:**
What do you mean?

**Diarmuid:**
You were wondering why Lord Tajima didn't tell you about this yourself, right, Master?

**Diarmuid:**
I can answer that.

**Mash:**
...

**Diarmuid:**
It's because our miscreant must be some kind of curse. Or rather, feelings that have degenerated into one.

**Diarmuid:**
I just never thought it would look for me in the simulator, tracking me through the bonds we share.

**Diarmuid:**
...Lady Kiyohime.

**Kiyohime:**
Yes! I'm here!

**Diarmuid:**
There is the faintest trace of this curse still lingering on your shoulder.

**Diarmuid:**
It is from when you spoke to Lord Tajima,
after he encountered it here.

**Diarmuid:**
That is almost certainly why he tried to distance himself from Master. To keep the curse away from [♂ him /♀️ her].

**Mash:**
Really!?

**Mash:**
But, our sensors didn't pick up anything when she entered the Command Room!

**Kiyohime:**
Now that you mention it...I do think my shoulders feel a little heavy...

**Kiyohime:**
I'd better burn that curse
away later, just to be safe.

**Diarmuid:**
Impressive.

**Diarmuid:**
Lord Tajima must have come to you because he knew you would have been able to handle it without difficulty.

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
That...makes a lot of sense.

**Kiyohime:**
?


---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Kiyohime and curses do kind of, uh, go together...

**Kiyohime:**
Master?


---

**Diarmuid:**
That curse...

**Diarmuid:**
No... Those feelings are directed at me.

**Diarmuid:**
I can still detect the scent of Danaan on them.
I have no doubt that it is searching for me.

**Diarmuid:**
I considered trying to quietly handle this myself,
so as not to trouble the rest of you...

**Diarmuid:**
...but that is not a decision I can make on my own.

**Diarmuid:**
I am sworn to serve you now, Master, and cannot take up my spear without your permission. That is why...

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
That's why you came and told me.


---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Thanks, Diarmuid.


---

**Diarmuid:**
You are too kind, Master.

**Diarmuid:**
Please be careful. This scent...
The curse is drawing near!

**Mash:**
I can't see anything on our monitors...

**Mash:**
No, wait! I'm picking up a hostile headed your way!

**Mysterious Swordsman:**
...

**Kiyohime:**
Oh my, he just radiates animosity!

**Mash:**
There is no way this is NPC data!
These numbers shouldn't even be possible! Senpai!

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I'm going to give it a shot.


---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I'll do my best to be careful!


---

**Diarmuid:**
Worry not, Master! Virtual space or not,
I will make sure no harm comes to you!

**Diarmuid:**
I, Diarmuid Ua Duibhne, shall be your opponent!

**--BATTLE--**

**Diarmuid:**
Damn! I can't finish him off with this Spirit Origin!

**Mash:**
Senpai! Diarmuid!

**Kiyohime:**
Master!

**Mash:**
The hostile shows no signs of disappearing! It's going to be fiendishly difficult to defeat them in battle!

**Mash:**
I think you should&ndash;

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Hold on.


---

**Fujimaru 2:**
They're trying to say something...


---

**Mash:**
!?

**Mysterious Swordsman:**
...You are not the one.

**Mysterious Swordsman:**
You are not the one.

**Mysterious Swordsman:**
Your spear is not enough.

**Mysterious Swordsman:**
Show me your true power. Show me the power
of a knight raised by the sea-god Manannán.

**Mysterious Swordsman:**
Show me the sword of Manannán!

**Diarmuid:**
Master, stand back!

**Diarmuid:**
Hraaaaaahhh...!

**Diarmuid:**
Gáe Buidhe!

**Mysterious Swordsman:**
...You are not the one.

**Diarmuid:**
(My demonic spear didn't work?)

**Diarmuid:**
(No, that's not it...!)

**D：Voice:**
...That's right.
He wishes to duel with swords alone.

**D：Voice:**
No other weapon will lay him to rest.

**Diarmuid:**
!!!

**Mash:**
I'm picking up a powerful magical energy reading!
It doesn't appear to be hostile, but...

**Diarmuid:**
Are they here to fight too?
No, wait. This feeling...

**Voice From The Shadows:**
...I'm sorry for the trouble. He is indeed looking for you, but he is also looking for me.

**Diarmuid:**
You're...

**Diarmuid:**
Now I see...

**Mash:**
Diarmuid!?

**Kiyohime:**
You're lowering your spear...?
Isn't that dangerous to do in the face of an enemy?

**Diarmuid:**
It's fine. This shadow is different.

**Diarmuid:**
If anything...I would say he's here to back us up.

**Voice From The Shadows:**
Indeed I am.

**Voice From The Shadows:**
However, I currently lack a corporeal Spirit Origin, and thus would like to make use of yours.

**Voice From The Shadows:**
If that is acceptable to you, Master.

**Diarmuid:**
...Master, I would ask you to grant his request.
We must do this if we are to defeat this opponent.

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I trust you, Diarmuid.


---

**Fujimaru 2:**
(Nod)


---

**Voice From The Shadows:**
Understood!

**Mash:**
They're resonating with each other...!?
It looks like Diarmuid's Spirit Origin is changing!

**Diarmuid:**
...Servant, Saber. My True Name is Diarmuid Ua Duibhne, of the Knights of Fianna...

**Diarmuid:**
...and my two demonic blades are at your service!

**Diarmuid:**
Now! Curse who has taken form in our simulator!

**Diarmuid:**
No... You are a pure, honest giant&ndash;a Giolla Deacair! But I also know you as the Fairy King Ábartach of the Danann!

**Diarmuid:**
Why have you come to Chaldea!?

**Mash:**
Fairy King Ábartach of the Danann!?

**Kiyohime:**
Wh-who's that!?

**Mash:**
He's a king who ruled over one
of the fairy kingdoms in Erin!

**Mash:**
In the Fenian Cycle of Celtic legend, he was said to have formed an alliance with the Knights of Fianna...

**Mash:**
...and in the process of forming that alliance,
Diarmuid ended up fighting one of his knights...

**Mash:**
Although some accounts of that legend say that Diarmuid actually fought the Fairy King himself!

**Mysterious Swordsman:**
Yes... Yesss...

**Mysterious Swordsman:**
That is the knight of Fianna I have been searching for.
At last, you have shown yourself before me.

**Mysterious Swordsman:**
I saw your swordsmanship in my dreams. I saw your swords shining brightly atop the earth once again.

**Mysterious Swordsman:**
Thus did my consciousness cross time and space to arrive in this digital domain...

**Mysterious Swordsman:**
...At last, I have found you again, Diarmuid!

**Mysterious Swordsman:**
Not the invincible knight Fionn,
with his demonic sword Móralltach and demonic spear Gáe Dearg!

**Mysterious Swordsman:**
Nor the figure of the Lancer with two demonic spears! No, at last, you have become a Saber wielding two demonic swords!

**Mysterious Swordsman:**
A far cry indeed from the Diarmuid I saw at the spring on that fateful day...

**Mysterious Swordsman:**
...who was the only one able to leap
beyond that precipitous cliff!

**Mysterious Swordsman:**
Ahh, I want nothing more than to defeat
you and your two swords, Diarmuid!

**Diarmuid:**
...What a self-centered king you are.

**Diarmuid:**
Nonetheless, I understand how you feel,
and I accept your challenge!

**Diarmuid:**
I am Diarmuid Ua Duibhne, First Spear of the Knights of Fianna! But now I stand before you armed with two swords, not spears!

**Diarmuid:**
Now, you shall know defeat!

**--BATTLE--**

**Holmes:**
Fascinating.

**Holmes:**
So two different versions of the same Heroic Spirit now coexist in one Spirit Origin? Hmm...

**Holmes:**
I suppose it is not totally dissimilar from Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde's case, though for you it seems to be a more temporary phenomenon.

**Holmes:**
Especially given how the Saber version seems to have made his way here via the connection he made to Ms. Miyamoto in a parallel world.

**Holmes:**
That particular Spirit Origin has, of course,
been registered in our database by now...

**Holmes:**
...but I'm afraid that your current self can only maintain its manifestation for so long.

**Holmes:**
Therefore&ndash;

**Da Vinci:**
You might as well enjoy yourself while you're here. This should be fun!

**Da Vinci:**
So, I'll put a little more in the way of resources into the simulator while you're here.

**Da Vinci:**
After all, we're Chaldea, the Security Organization for the Preservation of Humanity. You won't find this many Servants anywhere else! Ever!

**Da Vinci:**
There ought to be plenty of badass heroes here for you to cross swords with!

**Diarmuid:**
I, um... Are you sure about this?
I never belonged to this world, after all.

**Diarmuid:**
Are you certain it will not be a problem
to keep me here, even temporarily?

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
It's fine! Don't worry about it!


---

**Fujimaru 2:**
What's Lancer Diarmuid think?


---

**Diarmuid:**
...Oh. Well...

**Kiyohime:**
Go on. What's he saying?

**Diarmuid:**
...The Lancer within me says we
should accept Master's generosity.

**Kiyohime:**
Then listen to him!
Please, enjoy yourself.

**Diarmuid:**
...

**Diarmuid:**
You are all very kind. Very well then, I shall
do my utmost to enjoy what time I have here!

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Great! Then let's get started!


---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Four consecutive battles coming right up!

**Mash:**
Go!


---

**--BATTLE--**

**Diarmuid:**
...I almost feel as though I am dreaming.

**Diarmuid:**
Yet I doubt even the gods or the Fairy King could ever have conceived of something so wondrous as this.

**Diarmuid:**
Truly, I could ask for no better parting gift.

**Diarmuid:**
You have my deepest thanks, Master of Chaldea.

**Mash:**
Senpai... Diarmuid's Spirit Origin is forcefully reverting to its Lancer form!

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...Did you enjoy yourself?

**Diarmuid:**
Of course, Master.


---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I wish you could've stayed longer.


---

**Diarmuid:**
It would seem this is it.
It won't be much longer now until I disappear.

**Diarmuid:**
But please, do not worry about me.
My Lancer Spirit Origin is perfectly capable.

**Diarmuid:**
I am still me, whether I carry sword or spear,
and I will continue to wield them for your sake.

**Diarmuid:**
Now then, I&ndash;

**Diarmuid:**
...!

**Diarmuid:**
That golden sword!
Are you...the King of Knights?

**Altria:**
Forgive me. It would seem you no longer have time to spare for a duel.

**Altria:**
Perhaps we can remedy that some other day,
Sir Diarmuid.

**Altria:**
As I see it, it may be best simply to summon your new Spirit Origin here...

**Altria:**
...but it is only through fate that we may have another chance to duel.

**Altria:**
And so, while I cannot give you my word,
I can at least say this much:

**Altria:**
I hope we will meet again some day,
Diarmuid Ua Duibhne of the Knights of Fianna.

**Diarmuid:**
...Yes. I'd like that very much.

**Diarmuid:**
Should that day ever come, King of Knights...we will have a battle for the ages!
