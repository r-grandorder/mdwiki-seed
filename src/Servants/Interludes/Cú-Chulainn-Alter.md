# Cú Chulainn - Alter

## A War of Only Two

**Narration:**
Even a single mistake in a Rayshift cannot be allowed. Or at least, that would be the case were there no opponents awaiting the team.

 
**Narration:**
Is this mere chance? The whim of a Demon God Pillar?
Or is it simply human error?

 
**Narration:**
Whatever the case, on that day in 2018, only a short while after Cú Chulainn Alter was summoned...

 
**Narration:**
Humanity's last Master, Fujimaru,
was in a dire situation.

 
**Narration:**
Hm? Dire situations are the order of the day here?
Well, be that as it may, THIS particular situation was something rather special.

 
**Narration:**
Master's most trusted Servant,
Mash Kyrielight, was not by [♂ his /♀️ her} side.

 
**Narration:**
It was not long after the difficult, arduous task of correcting the Singularity in America had been completed.

 
**Narration:**
Of all Chaldea's Servants,
[♂ he /♀️ she} took only Cú Chulainn Alter...

 
**Narration:**
...on a forty-eight hour journey.

 
**Cú Chulainn:**
Bluntly, an Alter is another side of us...just another possibility.

 
**Cú Chulainn:**
For example: heroes, no matter what kind of life they lived, almost always end up with blood on their hands.

 
**Cú Chulainn:**
Even heroes who like to think of themselves as good remain aware that they have a merciless side to them.

 
**Cú Chulainn:**
What would happen if their other side was brought to the forefront? Pretty obvious, don't you think?

 
**Tristan:**
It goes without saying that we are conscious that our living selves and ourselves as we are now are more or less the same.

 
**Tristan:**
However, even I cannot make any claim to sainthood.

 
**Tristan:**
A virtuous king can turn cold-blooded.
A cold-blooded king becomes virtuous.

 
**Tristan:**
A mad dog of a knight had a time to shine bright.
And the opposite rings true.

 
**Tristan:**
And there are those who fell from grace, those who fell into darkness, or were driven into it by events beyond their control.

 
**Gilles de Rais:**
...Lamentably, I cannot argue that point.

 
**Gilles de Rais:**
That is the man I ultimately become.
An Anti-Hero, a mass-murderer, a truly evil man.

 
**Gilles de Rais:**
As painful as it may be, it is not something I can simply avoid...

 
**Gilles de Rais:**
I must acknowledge that he is another side of me...
I mustn't avert my gaze from that truth...

 
**Cú Chulainn:**
The real issue is that they're not exactly just another side of us. They've mutated somehow.

 
**Cú Chulainn:**
The other me fused with Medb's far-fetched idea of me as a king.

 
**Cú Chulainn:**
Guess it happened since humanity is so unstable.
Otherwise, I'd have been less of a jerk.

 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
What?
You scared, Fujimaru?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Not really.
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
Don't act so tough.

 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
We lost communication, we're low on food and water,
and I'm the only Servant you've got.

 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
Standing there, saying you're not scared?
Liar.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Well, to be honest...
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
I knew it.

 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
We lost communication, we're low on food and water,
and I'm the only Servant you've got.

 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
Even your trusty Shielder isn't here.

 


---
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
Anyone would be scared out of their wits.
Right?

 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
Don't give me that look.

 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
We did try to kill each other the last time we were here. Am I wrong?

 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
No, I'm not. You and I fought to the death.
You, Fujimaru.

 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
If you're a Master, you are responsible for your Servants in battle. No matter the opponent, the ultimate decision to fight is on you.

 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
That's why I fought against you and lost.
Isn't that right?

 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
But now it's just a faint memory. Look at that.
While we were chit-chatting, enemies surrounded us.

 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
So what'll it be, Master? Retreat or meet the attack head-on? You better choose.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Attack.


---
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
Got it. Good, a quick decision.
You didn't even hesitate. I like it.

 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
Now it's time for a massacre.
This lot isn't even hardy enough to be a good meal.

 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
Still, no harm in an appetizer here and there!


**--BATTLE--:**

**Cú Chulainn:**
Normally, if I were summoned as a Berserker,
I would turn out pretty different.

 
**Cú Chulainn:**
But from what I remember, the raged-out me is probably the world's biggest good-for-nothing.

 
**Cú Chulainn:**
So maybe HE is at least the lesser of two evils.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Hey! We're connected!
All right!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Doctor!


---
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Oh. Hey. Glad you're doing okay.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
We were monitoring your vitals this whole time on our end, but I couldn't relax until I saw your face in person!

 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
Hey. You aren't looking in person. You're yammering from a safe, cushy office. Who the hell do you think you are?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Ugh, well...
I can't really argue that.

 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
...I was only speaking on your behalf.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
He's completely right, Fujimaru.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
When you come back, I'll treat you to my favorite sesame buns by way of apology.

 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
Is that the best you can do?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Eh? Uh...um...my favorite bean buns?
Hngh...this is gonna cost me...!

 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
Master, I am not certain your boss is a good or worthwhile human being.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I sometimes wonder the same thing.
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Oh come on.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
That's not exactly news.
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Just...consider all that an attempt to lighten the mood with a silly joke!

 


---
 
**Dr. Roman:**
...Aaanywho, that's enough chitchat.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
You're in a bit of a dangerous situation right now...
We have two choices about how to retrieve you.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Our first option would be to conduct a forced Rayshift. It's dangerous, but it's probably the best way to deal with the current situation.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
...Let me emphasize that this will be dangerous.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
It will be a great deal harder on you than a normal Rayshift.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Second option: I've already pinpointed your coordinates. You should be able to make your way to Mash on foot.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
If you do that, we can Rayshift you back normally.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
However, Mash is a little far. It will take you at least forty-eight hours to reach her.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Forty-eight hours...


---
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
Ha. Well, well.
You've gotten yourself into quite the mess, Master.

 
**Cú Chulainn:**
Is he saying there's a chance he might betray Master?

 
**Cú Chulainn:**
Who knows? Tough question.

 
**Cú Chulainn:**
No matter how levelheaded Berserkers may seem,
they're all pretty unhinged.

 
**Cú Chulainn:**
However, if they're completely lost to madness, there is a possibility that they could make a mad dash without thinking twice... Maybe.

 
**Cú Chulainn:**
Either way, I can't imagine even the other side of me would do something like that.

 
**Cú Chulainn:**
Honestly, the opposite is more likely, I think.

 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
...I don't sense any enemies nearby.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Thanks.


---
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
Just doing my job as a Servant.
Quit thanking me every time.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
But...


---
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
Irritating.

 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
That's just the natural relationship between Master and their Servants.

 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
I may be born from malice and bizarre circumstance,
but I am still Cú Chulainn.

 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
Kill my enemies.
Protect my allies.

 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
That is how it goes for all Celtic folk:
we kill whether they be enemies or allies.

 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
And I'm not so squeamish as to let others do my dirty work.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Got it.


---
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
Good. Rest up.
I'll keep watch.

 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
Oh. Before you go to sleep,
there's one thing I want to ask you.

 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
...Why did you choose to do it this way?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
No way can I let myself die here.
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
...Figured as much.

 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
Had you chosen the forceful Rayshift option in an attempt to get away from it all, and some kind of accident happened...the world would be over.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Eh, just 'cause.
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
...Hmph.

 


---
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
But now, you're stuck with me for another thirty-six hours.

 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
You have no other allies here, and nobody else can help you. This time we have together will be like torture... Are you sure you can make it out alive?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I am.
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
Oh really?

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I'm not... At least, not if I'm alone.
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
...I see.

 


---
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
Time to head out, [♂ boy /♀️ girl}.
Get a move on.

 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
And one more thing: hydrate yourself from the tree roots before we leave the forest. We won't have another chance to get any water for a while.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
...I've got some bad news.

 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
I doubt you could tell us much that would make matters worse.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
We've detected a large group of enemies up ahead.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
They're spread out all over the place. Trying to go around would add about two hundred hours to your trip.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Considering your food and water supplies, your psychological state, and your current vitals, I recommend you Rayshift immediately.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
It shouldn't be so much of a cause for concern now.
Our chances of success have gone up. It should be fine...probably...

 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
Enemies?
Then I'll kill them.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
There's just too many of them.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Plus, our analysis of enemy activity shows they're in constant communication with each other.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Once they're engaged, they'll just keep calling for reinforcements until they've killed their target.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Matters might have been different if Mash were there, but there's just no way you can protect Fujimaru alone.

 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
...Huh. Nice pep talk.

 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
Well then.
Master, we're going to find a place for you to hide.

 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
Then I'll go slaughter them all.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Come on, don't be absurd!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
First and foremost, I can't let you just leave Fujimaru alone!

 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
As it is, there's no choice.

 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
If I fail, then you can just Rayshift or whatever you want to do.

 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
Let's review.

 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
You'll stay here and find some food and water.

 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
I'll go swing my lance around a bit, even throw out my Noble Phantasm. Once I've swept all the enemies away, I'll call for you.

 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
Got it?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I don't like it.
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
What, are you going to tag along?

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Don't you think I should go with you?
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
You out of your damn mind?

 


---
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
If you pull something like that, the whole plan's a waste. The enemy's after you.

 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
You wanna be dead weight slowing me down?
And you call yourself a Master...

 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
...I want to say that I understand what you're saying.

 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
“I don't want you to die and I don't want to die.”

 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
But the whole Master-Servant relationship isn't that simple.

 
**Cú Chulainn:**
I don't think betrayal is a concern,
but I'd say death is imminent.

 
**Cú Chulainn:**
In a normal Grail War, a Master only thinks of their Servants as familiars, which causes some trouble.

 
**Cú Chulainn:**
Most Masters are good-for-nothing mages. It's no wonder they don't get along with Heroic Spirits.

 
**Cú Chulainn:**
Well, some Servants tolerate them,
but some Servants cross the line.

 
**Cú Chulainn:**
But that guy is the opposite. He understands that he's just a familiar, and acts accordingly.

 
**Cú Chulainn:**
So that's why if Master's life's in danger...I think he'd throw his life away to protect [♂ him /♀️ her} without hesitating.

 
**Cú Chulainn:**
It's not something he'd do out of affection so much as just the sort of service he feels is appropriate.

 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
Goring Spear of Slaughter...Gáe Bolg!!!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
I don't believe it. I knew his NP is Anti-Army,
but he wiped out a third of the enemies.

 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
Quit mocking me. It's ONLY a third.
Until I've massacred the rest of them, this isn't a victory.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
If only you weren't alone, and if only there wasn't such an endless tide of enemies...

 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
Heh. I'm used to this.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
No matter how I look at this, you'll only be able to get through half of them at best. I recommend you give up and make a temporary retreat.

 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
And what would happen if we retreat?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Well...you'll just have to start all over again.

 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
Screw that.

 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
Backup from Chaldea has its limits. If we turn back and start all over again, this [♂ boy /♀️ girl} definitely won't last.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
I don't know...
I think you underestimate Fujimaru.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Let me say this again: at best you can take out half. They may not be individually strong, but their sheer numbers are overwhelming.

 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
That's nothing new for a lone Servant out in the battlefield.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Oh, right.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
I forgot that Cú Chulainn fought through an army of Medb's soldiers all by himself.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
But still, you're a Servant now. We don't have sufficient magical energy for you to keep exerting your true power like that.

 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
...Figured as much.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
You think that's why you have a Master, huh.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
A supplier of magical energy for manifestation...
A link to maintain your existence.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
That, and that alone, is what you believe a Master's purpose to be.

 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
What else would it be?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Unfortunately for you,
there's a good deal more to it.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Now that you've taken out a third of the enemies,
we can ensure [♂ his /♀️ her} safety from our end.

 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
Huh? What the hell are you talking about...?
You're not saying...

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Fujimaru! It's your turn!
Support him as a Master!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Got it, Doctor!


---
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
Damn.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
It'll be okay. Your Master overcame the catastrophe that was the demonic fog in London, so you'll be fine!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
I've sent you all the data we have on the enemies.
Now, fight alongside Cú Chulainn Alter!


**--BATTLE--:**

**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
We've managed to get rid of a good number.
Okay, we're going to dash through.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Are you angry?


---
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
...

 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
I don't agree, but I'm not mad.

 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
...But now I know you're that kind of Master.
From here on, I just have to handle you differently.

 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
Come on, we're going to walk a bit more.
Master, what about food and water?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Uh...


---
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
...You wanna starve?
We can't go back.

 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
Chew on tree roots and lick the stones.
Don't you dare complain. This is your own doing!

 
**Narration:**
And after that?

 
**Narration:**
Afterward, they managed to meet up with Mash Kyrielight, and that was it.

 
**Narration:**
Nothing was physically gained from that incident, but they went through a valuable experience...at least I want to think so.

 
**Narration:**
Even for Fujimaru, chewing on tree roots to survive isn't an everyday occurrence.

 
**Narration:**
Report completed.
Recorder is □□　□□□□□□□□.

 
**Narration:**
Now then...I wonder if someone's going to read through this massive Rayshift report someday.

 
**Narration:**
Or maybe it will never see the light of day...considering the future to be saved, and what lies after that.


## Kill Like a Beast, Fight for Carnage

**Narration:**
...He once said no one should bother trying to understand him.

 
**Narration:**
That sometimes, understanding can lead to hatred,
and that hatred can lead to mistakes.

 
**Narration:**
So one must never try to understand a Berserker.

 
**Narration:**
For understanding is not in their nature.

 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
Tch...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Are you okay?
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
Of course I am.

 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
I have to keep on winning now.
I don't have any other choice.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Can you still fight?
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
...That's a good question, Master.
Stupid one, too.

 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
'Course I can still fight.
I'm still alive, aren't I?

 


---
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
That said, I'll admit our situation couldn't suck harder if it tried.

 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
We can't Rayshift out of here, we can't call Chaldea, I'm the only Servant you've got...

 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
...and on top of all that, the enemy commands Servants from all the main classes.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Not to mention we don't even know what time period this is.


---
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
Right.

 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
There's nothing but primordial forest as far as we can see, the air's filthy, and there's magical energy everywhere.

 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
This place is at least as bad as the Age of Gods.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Do you think it's a Demon God Pillar?
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
Maybe, but who cares?

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I wonder what's causing this.
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
It might be a Demon God Pillar, but who cares?

 


---
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
What matters is that we're facing seven Servants, and we've gotta beat them all if we wanna get out of here.

 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
Whether we beat them one at a time, or all at once...

 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
...we won't be fixing this Singularity until you and I are the only ones left standing here.

 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
And we need to get this done as fast as possible.

 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
Your body looks to be about at its limit, yeah?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
But...
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
If you're seriously gonna spend any energy worrying about my worthless hide...

 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
...then you have no business trying to save humanity.

 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
Now that humanity's been restored, there's any number of Masters who could take your place.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
What about you? Are you okay?
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
Don't bother worrying about me.
We Servants only exist to fill a need.

 


---
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
Your hesitation could easily get us both killed.

 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
Don't get close to me, don't defend me, don't even treat me like a person. ...It'll just dull my spear.

 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
All right, no more chitchat.

 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
All there is now is to fight until I get you back home.

 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
Ready?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...Yeah.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Let's go!
 


---
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
Looks like we've got our first two opponents!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Watch out for Robin Hood!
 
**Robin Hood:**
Damn, you're really worried about a second-rate Servant like me? I know they say “better safe than sorry,” but come on!

 
**Robin Hood:**
Eh, don't worry though. Torturing Masters like you to death really isn't my thing.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Watch out for Semiramis!
 
**Semiramis:**
Well, well. I see this Master has a sharp eye.

 
**Semiramis:**
Too bad it won't do you any good, seeing as you're stuck with a Berserker.

 
**Semiramis:**
Tell you what. Out of respect for your talent,
I'll make your death quick and painless.

 


---
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
Don't make me laugh.

 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
These Servants never stood a chance against me!


**--BATTLE--:**

**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
Gotcha!

 
**Semiramis:**
Hmph, so this is as far as I go...
Well that wasn't fun at all.

 
**Robin Hood:**
Welp, guess this is it.
But, at least we did what we came here to do...

 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You've been poisoned!
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
Tch... So that's what their game was.

 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
Don't worry about it. I might not be long for this world, but I'm not done for yet.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I'll heal you!
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
Don't bother.

 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
Semiramis made this...and she's been poisoning people longer than anyone.

 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
A few cure spells aren't gonna do shit.

 


---
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
So, five to go... Better take care of them before the poison spreads too far.

 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
Still no sign of what time period this is, or a place where we can get a look at this whole Singularity.

 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
Ah well, that's not important.
The main thing is finding the other Servants.

 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
...What? You still worried about the poison or something?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
That's part of it, but...
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
Yeah?

 


---
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
It's just, you have so little regard for yourself...
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
...You haven't changed a bit, have you?

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I don't get you.
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
You don't have to get me. Servants are just machines.

 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
And there's no point in caring for a machine like it was a person.

 


---
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
...Getting back to what matters here...

 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
There's definitely something odd about this Singularity. Some parts look like the Far East, others like South America.

 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
And on top of that, I don't see any signs of people anywhere. We can't just keep stumbling around and hope for the best.

 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
Any bright ideas, Master?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Maybe we could find somewhere to go if we made a boat?
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
...Forget it. Every bone in my body's telling me that's a bad idea.

 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
I'm guessing we could sail all the way around this world and still not find anywhere to go.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Maybe a cave or something...?
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
Yeah, that makes sense.

 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
It'd be a good idea to find shelter in a cave,
in part so you can get some rest.

 


---
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
All right, let's see if we can find a cave.
But first...

 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
...I'm gonna kill these guys and get 'em off our backs. Give me some space, Master.

 
**Karna:**
...Please don't think poorly of me.
It's nothing personal.

 
**Medb:**
Aww, you're the guy we gotta take out, Cú?
Well that sucks!

 
**Medb:**
Come on, why don't you ditch the loser and join us?

 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
Don't be ridiculous. I can't do that.

 
**Karna:**
It's not that.
You're merely loyal to a fault.

 
**Karna:**
Becoming an Alter has done nothing to change that.

 
**Medb:**
True. You just wouldn't be Cú if you went around ditching your charge.

 
**Medb:**
So it'd make me real happy if you just agreed to roll over and kick the bucket to get out of this Holy Grail War!

 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
Holy Grail War?

 
**Karna:**
I see little point in telling you more,
as you are about to die.

 
**Karna:**
Let's begin.

 
**Medb:**
Hmm, I don't know how I feel about this. Facing you when you're poisoned seems like a geis from when you were still alive...

 
**Medb:**
No, wait, I totally know how I feel! This is just as exciting now as it was back then! I can't wait to back you into a corner and finish you off!

 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
Come try.

 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
When this is over, there won't be so much as a speck left of either of you!

 
**Karna:**
I see. So that ferocity is what made you a Berserker.

 
**Karna:**
You have narrowed your focus so much that you've blinded yourself to anything other than your goal.

 
**Karna:**
But remember this, warrior of Ulster: that very part of you is what weighs on your Master the most.


**--BATTLE--:**

**Narration:**
Every breath I take is agony.
I have no idea what I should do.

 
**Narration:**
So I tear into the enemy in front of me.
That's all I'm meant for.

 
**Narration:**
That's what warriors have always done,
especially when we're berserk.

 
**Karna:**
A true hero...kills with his eyes!

 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
Tch...!

 
**Medb:**
Bring it!
Chariot My Love!

 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
Is that a joke, Medb!?

 
**Medb:**
He took it head-on!

 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
Here, Karna.
You can have this back!

 
**Karna:**
...!

 
**Medb:**
Karna!

 
**Karna:**
...It would seem this is it for me...

 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
You left yourself open, Medb.

 
**Medb:**
Huh!?
Oh shi&ndash;

 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
Gáe Bolg...!

 
**Medb:**
Guh...!

 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
It's over. Now it's your turn to die.

 
**Medb:**
Heh, hehe... Owww...
That was...a good hit.

 
**Medb:**
You win this one. But...there's still three Servants left. Think you can take them all with your body falling apart?

 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
Shut up.

 
**Medb:**
Hehe...
See you...on the other side.

**Fujimaru 1:**
Cú Chulainn!

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Alter!


---
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
...Come on... We need to keep going.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Can we at least rest a little?


---
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
?

 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
...Yeah, all right.
You stay here and hold down the fort.

 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
Meantime...I'll go finish off the last three.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Can you just trust me?


---
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
...It's not that. If I didn't trust you,
I'd have killed you long ago.

 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
...
...

 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
...Karna said I'm a burden for you as I am now.

 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
He's probably right.

 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
For some reason...I'm dead set on handling everything on my own.

 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
Allies, comrades, friends...

 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
Anyone who's supposed to help share the load just ends up making it heavier for me.

 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
That goes for you too, Master.

 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
As much as I'm a burden for you,
you're a burden for me.

 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
So you just sit tight here while I go take care of this.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
So now, here I am, all on my own...

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Something about this doesn't feel right...


---
 
**???:**
Huh, what do you know.
You must be that Master of Chaldea [♂ fellow /♀️ lady}.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Andersen...!?


---
 
**Andersen:**
That's me.

 
**Andersen:**
A third-rate Servant, and the only one to voluntarily drop out of this Holy Grail War.

 
**Andersen:**
If you already know who I am, that'll save us some time. Now, what are you doing here?

 
**Andersen:**
Is your Servant staying out of the Holy Grail War?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
“Holy Grail War” is kind of stretching it...


---
 
**Andersen:**
True, this one is much different than the usual battle royale.

 
**Andersen:**
Instead of fighting each other, all seven Servants are working together to keep the Holy Grail safe from a single opposing Servant.

 
**Andersen:**
Of course, since it won't make any difference if I'm there fighting or not, I decided I'd go ahead and sit it out right here.

 
**Andersen:**
Besides, it doesn't matter how many of us our enemy defeats. There's no way he's getting through Heracles.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Heracles...!


---
 
**Andersen:**
Yup. The greatest hero in all of Greek myth. If most Servants can hit like a truck, Herc is more like a goddamn freight train. Only a fool would take him on.

 
**Andersen:**
So, what are you doing here,
anyway, Master of Chaldea?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Well...


---
 
**Andersen:**
Hmm. He prefers to go it on his own, huh.

 
**Andersen:**
That certainly sounds like something Cú Chulainn Alter would say.

 
**Andersen:**
The original Cú Chulainn was a Celtic warrior through and through. For him, both enemy and ally alike could be a friend...depending on his mood.

 
**Andersen:**
...But it sounds like all of that's gone in Cú Chulainn Alter.

 
**Andersen:**
So he thinks it's fine for everyone else to be weak, and as long as he's strong, everything will be fine.

 
**Andersen:**
He also thinks it's just fine to keep his charges at a distance, and doesn't care if he gets hurt.

 
**Andersen:**
What a joke!

 
**Andersen:**
Doesn't he realize that's exactly the sort of behavior that ends up hurting the ones he's supposed to be protecting?

 
**Andersen:**
That's the whole reason why you're hurt and moping around in here now.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I see.
 
**Andersen:**
Good. Then get out of here.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
So that's what I've been feeling...
 
**Andersen:**
Now do you get it?
Only one thing left for you to do.

 


---
 
**Andersen:**
Hurry up and go find him. Once you're out of these woods, turn left and keep heading straight.

 
**Andersen:**
You'll see a cave there.
That is where this war will come to an end.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Thank you, Andersen.


---
 
**Andersen:**
I've got no use for your gratitude. You don't look like you could afford one of my books anyway.

 
**Andersen:**
So get lost.
Go do what a Master's supposed to do.

 
**Andersen:**
If he succeeds at defeating the last two Servants,
it won't take long for this Singularity to disappear.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I can hear them fighting...!


---
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
Hraaaaaaaaah!!!

 
**Heracles:**
 
![berserk2](https://i.imgur.com/7VYgcEB.png)

 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
(Huff, huff, huff...)

 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
...
...

 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
Master? What're you...
Why're you here?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I'm here to fight.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Just felt like it.


---
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
...Tch.
Fine. Suit yourself.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Yep.


---
 
**Altria Alter:**
...So, the Master makes [♂ his /♀️ her} appearance.

 
**Altria Alter:**
But you are too late.
Your blade will never reach me.

 
**Altria Alter:**
Our Berserker's victory is assured.

 
**Heracles:**
 
![berserk2](https://i.imgur.com/7VYgcEB.png)

 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
...!

 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
Not yet.
This isn't over yet!

 
**Narration:**
My body's falling apart.
My mind's going with it.

 
**Narration:**
And I'm up against the strongest hero in all of Greek myth. A monster who completed the Twelve Labors and obtained immortality.

 
**Narration:**
I know I've killed him several times, but he keeps coming back to life and absolutely crushing me.

 
**Narration:**
I can feel my bones grinding.
I can feel my muscles tearing.

 
**Narration:**
But so what?

 
**Narration:**
I'm here to win.
To keep winning.

 
**Narration:**
...It doesn't matter if Master's here or not.
I don't need [♂ him /♀️ her}. And yet...

 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
Tch...!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Heal!
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Enhance!
 


---
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
Thanks for the help, but stay out of this.
...Just sit back and watch.

 
**Narration:**
...God, this sucks.

 
**Narration:**
Just having [♂ him /♀️ her} here is making me and my spear stronger...!

 
**Altria Alter:**
...Oho.

 
**Altria Alter:**
So you managed to reach me even without defeating Heracles.

 
**Altria Alter:**
...Very well.
Then I shall join the battle as well.

 
**Altria Alter:**
...Prepare to taste the steel of my sacred sword,
warrior of Ulster.

 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
No thanks.

 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
Don't go spacing out on me, Master.
We've got a battle to win.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Right...!


---
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
I'm pulling out all my curses.
No more holding back.

 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
...Let's go kill us some Servants.
Curruid Coinchenn...!


**--BATTLE--:**

**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
Haaaaaaaaaaaah!!!

 
**Altria Alter:**
...Impressive.

 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
I don't see the Caster anywhere...
I take it you're the last one?

 
**Altria Alter:**
That is correct.

 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
So, why were you guys summoned, anyway?

 
**Altria Alter:**
...I do not know.

 
**Altria Alter:**
All I know is that we were made to wait here, peacefully, until you two arrived.

 
**Altria Alter:**
We were then ordered to kill you. Nothing more.

 
**Altria Alter:**
This can only mean one of two things.
Whoever summoned us hates either Chaldea, or you.

 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
...I see.

 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
So this was just a big experiment.

 
**Altria Alter:**
Perhaps.

 
**Altria Alter:**
...Watch yourself, Master of Chaldea...

 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
It's over.

 
**Da Vinci:**
Heeey!
Fujimaru!

 
**Da Vinci:**
Phew, it looks like you're all right.
That's a relief.

 
**Da Vinci:**
Once we got cut off from voice comms, the only thing we could do was track your vital signs...

 
**Da Vinci:**
Though at least they remained stable the whole time. Everything okay on your end?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I'll explain when we get back.
 
**Da Vinci:**
Oho, sounds like we're in for a good story.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Well, more or less...
 
**Da Vinci:**
I see, I see.

 


---
 
**Da Vinci:**
All right, since it looks like you're all done cleaning up there, we'll get ready to bring you back.

 
**Da Vinci:**
Just let us know when you're done.

 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
...Someone with a grudge against us, huh. Guess there's still a Demon God Pillar out there somewhere.

 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
Must be rough, having someone wish you were dead for saving humanity.

 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
But anyway...

 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
...if you've got an enemy you need good and dead,
just give me a shout and I'll come running.

 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
That's what Berserkers are supposed to do, after all.

 
**Narration:**
...Man, this sucks.

 
**Narration:**
My own eventual death's probably gonna be a real shitshow...

 
**Narration:**
...but I guess at least one person's gonna be sad when I'm gone.
