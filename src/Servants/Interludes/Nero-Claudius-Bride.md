# Nero Claudius (Bride)

## Bouquet of Meetings

**Nero Bride:**
Well then, Fujimaru.
While I've made a pact with you, it's merely temporary.

 
**Nero Bride:**
In my current form, the rules that apply to other Servants don't apply to me.

 
**Nero Bride:**
Specifically, there is no Master-Servant relationship.
The only thing that ties me to you is your beauty.

 
**Nero Bride:**
I'm not just referring to your face and figure, you see? Both magnanimity and delicacy are equally important.

 
**Nero Bride:**
Or rather, are you capable of complimenting your partner? Master, do you possess THAT within your heart?

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...You mean tolerance?


---

**Fujimaru 2:**
...You mean resourcefulness?

---
 


 
**Nero Bride:**
So you do understand.
From now, I will tangibly measure that virtue.

 
**Nero Bride:**
They're drawn here by the alluring fragrance of flowers.
Use me well, and defeat them.

 
**Nero Bride:**
I'm an exquisite instrument playing sublime music. That instrument is for you to play.

 
**Nero Bride:**
Deftly take down your enemies to satisfy me.
I want us to make an oath to celebrate our meeting&mdash;

 
**Nero Bride:**
Hmph, don't be so nervous.
In modern terms, it's simply an arranged marriage!

 
**Nero Bride:**
Let's go, Master!
This will be memorable...our first team effort!


**--BATTLE--:**

**Nero Bride:**
You fought well, but your instruction wasn't perfect.
I'll give you a passing grade, though barely.

 
**Nero Bride:**
I won't blame you for being a immature mage.
Actually, there's more anticipation.

 
**Nero Bride:**
Seeing just how much my Master will thrive is the privilege of the bride beside him.

 
**Nero Bride:**
Now, about the dowry... Don't make such a sour face.
Fujimaru, I'm aware how empty your coffers are.

 
**Nero Bride:**
Perfect, I'll just take their jewelry instead.
This ring is just a toy, but it'll do for now.

 
**Nero Bride:**
Fit for a Servant that the bouquet of encounter is a battle.

 
**Nero Bride:**
Whether you're the ring to decorate my finger, or I'm the jewel to decorate yours&mdash;

 
**Nero Bride:**
That will be determined by the fights to come.
Let's see what you're made of, Master.


## The Bouquet of Resolve

**Nero Bride:**
So this is the place where the so-called Greater Grail was. Hm... I knew it. This spot would make an ideal forge.

 
**Nero Bride:**
Now then, Fujimaru.
I brought you here for a reason.

 
**Nero Bride:**
As we have grown quite accustomed to each other,
I'm considering taking our contract to the next step.

 
**Nero Bride:**
To be specific, we're here to increase my strength. Now, I am well aware that you have no complaints about me.

 
**Nero Bride:**
I know I am a dependable Servant. Or, more accurately, the number one, most trustworthy Servant!

 
**Nero Bride:**
But...you know... Well... That's not enough for me.
I want you to rely on me even more!

 
**Nero Bride:**
So, to make that wish a reality, I've created a situation where I am indispensable!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Um...?

 
**Nero Bride:**
Don't you understand!? I am going to be the ultimate Servant under your command!

 
**Nero Bride:**
That's right! I hereby declare it!

 
---

**Fujimaru 2:**
You're already indispensable, Nero.


 
**Nero Bride:**
Umu! I knew it. I knew it!
Why you, stating the obvious! Yooou!

 
---

 
**Nero Bride:**
...Oops. This isn't the best place to raise one's voice.

 
**Nero Bride:**
To business, then!
Our task today is to strengthen my sword.

 
**Nero Bride:**
My sword is beautiful and excellent, but unlike many other Heroic Spirits' weapons, mine has no specific legend of its own.

 
**Nero Bride:**
...Umu. This is just between you and me.

 
**Nero Bride:**
I actually made this sword myself, by hand. That on its own makes it a most desirable weapon, but it doesn't make it very powerful.

 
**Nero Bride:**
So, I've decided to reforge it, here on a new leyline! This iron meteorite is a spiritual stone that fell to Earth in the distant past.

 
**Nero Bride:**
What did Simon call them... Tears of the stars?
Things not of this world...

 
**Nero Bride:**
...Fragments of hope that even the stars themselves could not know? ...Something like that. No matter.

 
**Nero Bride:**
We shall place it on the powerful leyline in the heart of this cavern, stoke it with fire, and infuse it with life.

 
**Nero Bride:**
...There's just one problem.
I am sure I need not even say it, but...

 
**Nero Bride:**
Well, as you can see, this cavern is a den of wicked beasts! While I am strengthening my sword, I want you to protect me.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Leave it to me.


 
**Nero Bride:**
Umu, I'm counting on you, Master!

 
---

**Fujimaru 2:**
We can't fight together?


 
**Nero Bride:**
Urgh. Don't give me those abandoned puppy dog eyes.
I want to fight with you as well!

 
**Nero Bride:**
But the task of reforging this sword must be mine alone. I must refrain from battling alongside you.

 
---

 
**Monster:**
...!

 
**Nero Bride:**
They're here. I leave the rest to you!
Don't worry. I'm a genius. I can finish it up in a day!

 
**Nero Bride:**
Commit yourself to a full day's worth of battle for me, without rest or sleep!


**--BATTLE--:**

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Are you done yet!?

---


**Fujimaru 2:**
I'm getting exhausted!

---
 


 
**Nero Bride:**
Hmmmm... It's done, but something's missing...
I'm not happy the way this is curved.

 
**Nero Bride:**
Okay, that settles it!
Rejoice, Fujimaru.

 
**Nero Bride:**
This will be an item of great sentimental value between us! It must be absolutely perfect! No compromises! Time to start over from scratch!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
What incredible professionalism!

---


**Fujimaru 2:**
What are you thinking!?

---
 


 
**Nero Bride:**
Hahaha, don't praise me so much. It's embarrassing!
All right, back to protecting me, Master!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Are...are you done this time!?

---


**Fujimaru 2:**
...Um, I'm getting REALLY tired!

---
 


 
**Nero Bride:**
Hm. Damn. I cannot believe I of all people would make such a rudimentary mistake!

 
**Nero Bride:**
I forgot to engrave our names on the sword!

 
**Nero Bride:**
Good thing I caught the mistake!
I truly am a genius, and a lucky one at that!

 
**Nero Bride:**
That's okay! I'll just start over again!
I'm really getting in the zone now, Master!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Like engraving our initials inside a heart!

---


**Fujimaru 2:**
Okay, Nero, what the hell?

---
 


 
**Nero Bride:**
Don't get so excited. This will be the last one!
This will be an absolute masterpiece!

 
**Nero Bride:**
But it seems fate has finally caught up with us.

 
**Nero Bride:**
My beautiful sword, infused with the May wind...
It seems the creation of something so exquisite cannot be easily accomplished.

 
**Nero Bride:**
That is one peak of the Septem Montes!
An awakening of extreme greed from the capital of sin!

 
**Nero Bride:**
The dragon of the overflowing fountain of demonic energy: Avaritia! Hm? Why do I know this...?

 
**Nero Bride:**
...Hm, I suppose it just kind of slipped out.
That does happen with me sometimes, you know...

 
**Nero Bride:**
Regardless, I can assure you that it is a terribly powerful enemy! It is truly an offering worthy for the creation of my Noble Phantasm!

 
**Nero Bride:**
If you have any pride as my Master, show me you can claim that creature's crown!


**--BATTLE--:**

**Nero Bride:**
Sorry to make you wait! After seven attempts, a new sword is finally born!

 
**Nero Bride:**
I call it, Fervence Ardeo! I have made it into a blazing holy fountain based on this great cavern!

 
**Nero Bride:**
Come on. Don't be bashful! Take a good look!
You can come closer. Come closer!

 
**Nero Bride:**
Right here. Look closely at the handle.
See how our names are so beautifully engraved?

 
**Nero Bride:**
Hee hee. Don't be so embarrassed, or I'll get embarrassed too! Now you really can't help but be crazy about me!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Yep, you're right.


---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I keep telling you I'm already crazy about you!

---
 


 
**Nero Bride:**
U-umu... An excellent response, Master!
Now, let us head to a new battlefield!

 
**Nero Bride:**
I can wait no longer to show off the power of my new blade!
