# Sakata Kintoki

## Kintoki's Bear Extermination on Mt. Ashigara

**Sakata Kintoki:**
Bored. I'm so bored I might just nod off to sleep.
Still, not that bad a night.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
City noise isn't bad, but the silence of the wilderness at night is something else altogether.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Specifically, it's like, uh, you know...healing or therapeutic or whatever you call it?

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Well, whatever, who cares.
Which do you prefer, Boss?

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
A woman of the night, or a woman of the wilderness?
A showy woman, or a reserved and quiet young lady?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
City nights.
 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
That's surprising. Guess I didn't read you right.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
But you know, I also like the cities of your era.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
If we're lucky enough to save the world, I'll take you to a good place. Not quite gold, but platinum.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
It's a favorite I found in a previous materialization. Nice place. Both the booze and the food were pretty good.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Nights in the wild.
 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
As expected! I had a feeling you did, buddy!
We really do see eye to eye on everything!

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
But, aren't you a city mouse? Your face says you clearly weren't raised in the mountains.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
I grew up in the mountains. You can say the forest was my garden. I used to run around all the time.

 


---
 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Anyway... That sky ring is such a nuisance.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
The stupid thing ruins the night scenery.
Really uncool.

 
**Mash:**
Yes. We still don't know what the sky ring is.
It's an unexplained phenomenon.

 
**Mash:**
Both the Doctor and Da Vinci have been attempting to analyze it, but&ndash;

 
**Fou:**
Fou, fou...

 
**Dr. Roman:**
We can't figure it out. Not at all.
That guy said that it was a Noble Phantasm, but...

 
**Fou:**
Fou, foou, fou...

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
I don't like it. Geez, the moon and stars are all you need in a night sky.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
That thing's up there, lookin' like the stars, the moon, and even the sun's getting in its way.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
I don't know who, but&ndash;

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Well, this ain't the time for idle chatter.
Seems we got more insensitive dudes.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
They do say the moon goes good with a drink, but what? Even monsters want something with their booze?

 
**Mash:**
Huh?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Is there something out there?
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I don't sense anything
 


---
 
**Mash:**
No magical energy readings detected.
It's just a quiet forest.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
I don't think anyone's sensed us either.
I mean, I guess there're a few wild animals out there,

 
**Dr. Roman:**
but I don't sense anything that would be a particular threat to&ndash;

 
**???:**
GAAAAAAAAA&ndash;!!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Huh!? What!?

 
**Mash:**
Roaring of an unidentified creature confirmed from the southwest! It's outside of the magical energy detection radius, but...

 
**Mash:**
There's no doubt! It's the roaring of dragonkin!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
I-I see. So that's why! The reason why you, the Heroic Spirit Sakata Kintoki, were out “strolling” tonight!

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
...Tch. It's bigger than I thought.
And this job's a bigger pain in the ass now.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
The Second Singularity, was it?
I felt something roaring away in this era.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Man, it's gotta be&mdash;bears.

 
**Mash:**
Bears?

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
The only huge beasts that roar in the mountains are bears. These ones are particularly noisy!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
I wouldn't call them bears! Well, I guess it does no harm to perceive them that way?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Dragonkin, the strongest Phantasmals.
In a way, they're at the top of the ecosystem...

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Leave it to me! Time for a bear-extermination party.
Boss. I'll lead you there!

 
**Mash:**
&ndash;Multiple magical energy readings approaching at high speed! Judging from the speed and energy, most likely wyverns!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Perhaps they chain manifested due to the presence of the dragonkin. Unfortunately for us, there're a lot of them!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Drive the bears off!
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Drive the wyverns off!
 


---
 
**Mash:**
Yes, Master!
&ndash;Preparing for battle!

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Remember to roll up your sleeves! It's not cool to get splattered with blood during battle!


**--BATTLE--:**

**Sakata Kintoki:**
That was boring. I don't think I even worked off my last meal.

 
**Mash:**
Ending battle.
...All Phantasmals eliminated.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
I don't think that was one of his skills, but Sakata Kintoki was just tearing those Phantasmals apart.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Stories say he's a hero that took a bear down as a child, so it makes sense that he's this strong as an adult.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Sakata Kintoki, are you hiding any Anti-Phantasmal skills?

 
**Fou:**
Fou, foou.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Huh?

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
What're you talking 'bout, Doctor?
I'm the source of my own strength.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
I'm a golden man, glittering like gold.
You need a different reason?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Uh, no, not really...

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
All right, we're good then.
Oh, and stop calling me by my full name.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Huh? Wh-Why is that?

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
U-Umm, just try to get it, would you?
...I mean, “Kintoki.” It's a pretty lame name.

 
**Mash:**
&ndash;An enormous magical energy reading is approaching! It must have noticed us during the last battle.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
I can see it from here too! No doubt about it, it's huge, a Fafnir-type dragonkin!

 
**Mash:**
Judging from its speed, it seems to be flying.
Get ready for an attack!

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
This is so fun! I bet a flying bear is even stronger than a brown bear!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
How strong were brown bears in the Heian era!?
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Flying bears? Scary!
 


---
 
**Mash:**
Only a few seconds left until encounter.
&ndash;Senpai, orders please!

 
**???:**
GAAAAAAAAA&ndash;!!

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Oh, how bold! I'm totally awake now.
I'll send you on a tour of hell as thanks!


**--BATTLE--:**

**Mash:**
...Target defeated! Ending combat.
Disappearance of the large dragonkin confirmed!

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Master, that was a good workout before a late-night snack! Western brown bears aren't that bad!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
To be so calm against a dragonkin is really something... He must really be the child of a thunder god.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Or, perhaps in this case I should say, child of a red dragon? He's obviously not a run-of-the-mill Heroic Spirit&ndash;

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
I'm just me. Ugh, it's really too bad though.

 
**Mash:**
What is?

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
My class, you know. Why did they summon me as a Berserker?

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
If I materialized as a Rider, I coulda clashed midair with them on my “Golden Bear.”

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Huh, what's that!?
What's this Golden Bear?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Maybe a car?
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Maybe a robot?
 


---
 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
You're close, Boss. Oh, so close!

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
You see, the Golden Bear can transform itself between car form&ndash;

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
&ndash;and bear form.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Wh-What! I want to see that! I really do! Doesn't a transforming Noble Phantasm sound amazing!?

 
**Fou:**
Fou, fou, foou!!

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Oh, even the blue squirrel here gets it. If I had the Bear, even Nikola Tesla would beg me in tears...

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
“I want that too!” he'd say, and I'd make him get mad like a sorry little brat.

 
**Mash:**
Even Fou is quite excited...
Senpai&ndash;

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I wanna see it! I totally wanna see it!
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Transfoorm!
 


---
 
**Mash:**
...also seems very happy.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Well, I'm sure there'll be a chance to show you all someday. Anyway, let's hurry on home and have a drink!

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
A celebration for driving off the bears!
Doctor, get your best booze ready for us!


## Kintoki's Oni Slaying at Mt. Ooe

**Mash:**
Um, a clean...up?

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Yah. Just a little business I've gotta do.
I need Boss to come along with me.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Won't take long. It'll be a breeze.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I don't mind. Let's go!
 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Alright! That's my Boss! You get me!

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Okay, but where're we going, and what're we doing?
 
**Mash:**
You're going to Rayshift instead of using the training simulator, correct? What for?

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
You'll see soon. Mash, come on, let's do a cool golden shift!

 


---
 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Here's the specific coordinates. Right here.

 
**Mash:**
Oh, you wrote it down? All right then, let's&mdash;

 
**Mash:**
!?

 
**Mash:**
Th-this place... A short-term Rayshift may be possible if it's not for a Holy Grail investigation... But...

 
**Da Vinci:**
But I've taken all possible measures to prepare for this. You're going to THAT era, after all.

 
**Mash:**
Da Vinci! Oh, so you know already.

 
**Da Vinci:**
Yup. Kintoki came to talk to me about it last night. He seemed to have really given this some thought, which is not at all like him.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
I ain't thinkin' too much about it. I just got feverish for half a day mullin' over it, that's all!

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Y'all hate long explanations, right?
So I just cut to the chase. Got a problem with that!?

 
**Mash:**
No. But if you can at least tell us your reasoning...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Is this really serious...?

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Where exactly are we going?
 


---
 
**Mash:**
...Oh right, Senpai. We are Rayshifting to the B.C. era.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
There ya have it! And I told ya it was for a cleanup job. Gotta take care of a family matter.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Yo, Fuuma! If you're there, come on out!
The more Servants, the better!

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
...Impressive, Lord Kintoki. You've detected me...

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
As an Assassin, I am quite ashamed of this. But even my skills are no match for the legendary Lord Kintoki.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
(Uh... Well, I just took a shot in the dark in case he was there... Lucky I said something.)

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Whatever. That's my golden luck, I tell ya! We've gained a great ally!

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Countin' on ya, Fuuma! Yo, Mash.
Gimme a big-ass golden shift, got it!?

 
**Mash:**
Senpai...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I don't mind. Let's go!

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Family to Kintoki is family to Chaldea!
 


---
 
**Mash:**
Right, Senpai. Understood. Rayshifting to the B.C. era, before the end of the battle at the Demonic Front!

 
**Da Vinci:**
Sorry Mash, I need your help on my end. Like I said before, I'll have to do all I can to prove Fujimaru's existence.

 
**Mash:**
Y-yes. I, Mash Kyrielight, shall support you with all I have!

 
**Mash:**
Senpai, please come back safe!
And don't forget your scarf!

 
**Fou:**
Fooou!

 
**Mash:**
Oh, Fou!? I was wondering where you'd gotten to...
What are you doing in the circle...? Ah!

 
**Fou:**
Foufou fooou!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Oh, hey, Fou.
 
**Fou:**
Kyaaau!

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Don't jump in at the last minute from now on.
 
**Fou:**
Fooou...

 


---
 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
We're on...a mountain? And it looks quite steep.

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
Thankfully, there is a path. Whether climbing up a mountain or going down one, the presence of a path is of the utmost importance.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
This place looks familiar.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
This looks like the sacred mountain even the gods feared...
 


---
 
**Mash:**
That's right, Senpai. You've been there before. That's Mt. Ebih, the sacred mountain tied to Ishtar's myth.

 
**Mash:**
Last time we, um...fought against some aesthetically disastrous&ndash;I mean, very strong demonic statues there.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Well, looks like they ain't around.
And if they are, we'll just haveta take care of 'em!

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
Please proceed with caution, Lord Kintoki. Those particular statues' kicks were beyond powerful...

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
They were more destructive than a low-tier Servant's Noble Phantasm. They were certainly dangerous.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Well, yeah. Either way, if they do show up, it's not like we'll be able to just tiptoe arou&mdash;

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Hm? Wait a moment. Those statues over there...
Are they the ones you fought?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
They weren't Spriggan types, no.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
They were more erm...unique.
 


---
 
**Mash:**
...She should be a goddess who governs beauty, so why were they so hideous?

 
**Mash:**
Unless the sense of beauty in the Age of Gods was very different than what we're used to...

 
**Fou:**
Fou, fooou.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Hm?

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Are looks that important? Don't bother me much.

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
Are you speaking only about how a demonic statue looks? Or...

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Demonic statues, humans, tsuchigumo, it doesn't matter. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Regardless of outward appearance, there's good, and then there's evil.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Strong folks're strong, and weak ones are weak.
Some folks joke around, and some are serious.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
...There are even some who are beautiful, but scary at the same time.

 
**G：???:**
Oh, my. There's no need to speak so harshly.

 
**G：???:**
Why say such a thing when they're so adorably sweet. Don't you agree, heehee? This goddess of Sumer has wonderful taste.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
...That voice!

 
**Mash:**
I-I'm sorry, she told me to keep my mouth shut!
One more Servant Rayshifted with you!

 
**Mash:**
But I didn't expect... No, she is approaching along with what looks like several hostile responses!

 
**Mash:**
Shuten-Douji! You said you wanted to help Senpai!

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
Heehee. Mash, don't be so harsh with me.
I didn't do this maliciously.

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
Three giant demonic statues incoming!
And on one of their shoulders...that's...Shuten-Douji...!

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
I saw these cuties lying around, so I gave them a sip of my wine.

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
I did nothing wrong. I didn't turn it to poison like when I release my True Name. It's just wine.

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
All I did was offer it to them.

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
Heehee, they're so energetic. Look.
Their arms, legs, and bodies are all so puffed up.

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
If they're connected to the gods, see, it's only logical for them to spring to life or grow stronger.

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
It's the Divine Wine... The Shinpen Kidoku!
That's the oni's godly poison!

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
B-but according to legend, it's only supposed to strengthen humans! I've never heard of any godly beings getting stronger...!

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Zip it, boy. All we gotta do is smash 'em to pieces.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
I don't care how pretty their faces are or how beautiful their skin is. I got business at the end of that mountain trail!

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
They'll be a good warm-up! Yo, Boss! We only just Rayshifted, and already we got a golden battle on our hands!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Ready to battle!

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Golden battle... Begin!


---
 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Let's do this!!!


**--BATTLE--:**

**Shuten-Douji:**
Oh, my. But those were three godly oni&mdash;

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
How disappointing. Heehee. I see you are strong as ever, golden-haired, blue-eyed brat.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
...Shut up. The hell're you doin' here, anyway?

 
**Mash:**
Wait, Kintoki! Shuten-Douji really does want to help you and Master out!

 
**Mash:**
She voluntarily Rayshifted. She said she wanted to head out quickly, even if it could be dangerous.

 
**Mash:**
Even for a tough Servant like her, a hastened Rayshift makes it very hard to maintain her existence.

 
**Mash:**
Even then, she&mdash;

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
That ain't somethin' praiseworthy. That thing there's an oni. No matter how human she acts, she ain't.

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
Oh, how could you be so cruel? You shouldn't say such a thing just because of how I look.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Ain't your looks. Not one bit.
I'm sayin' it based on what's underneath.

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
...Heehee, like he's checking out my underthings...

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
So, what? Want to keep at it until we die?
I'm game, brat.

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
Lord Kintoki. Unnecessary combat...

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
I know. She may be an oni, but she's still Boss's Servant. Besides, I'm not the leader of this marching troupe.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Boss, I'm leaving the decision to you. I'll play along.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Let's take Shuten-Douji with us.
 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
All right. Can't complain if Boss says so. Let's get goin'.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I have a feeling Shuten-Douji's going to come in handy soon...
 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
...You serious, Boss?
That thing there's quite a headache.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Actually, I had the same hunch... I guess...
Well, at least I ain't the only one, then.

 


---
 
**Shuten-Douji:**
What, what? Quit your whispering!

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
Let me in! Me too, me too! Right, Master?

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Too close! Don't you get near me...or Boss!

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
Heehee. Oh, come on. What a wicked thing to say.

 
**Minamoto-no-Raikou:**
... (Gasp!) My mother's intuition is telling me something bad will happen!

 
**Minamoto-no-Raikou:**
Something that will sadden this mother, something shameful and wanton... Somewhere...

 
**Minamoto-no-Raikou:**
Could another pest...be bothering Master or Kintoki...?

 
**Boudica:**
Yes, yes, snap out of it.
Pay attention when you're holding a knife.

 
**Boudica:**
You were the one who wanted to learn how to cook dishes from various countries and eras. You need to concentrate.

 
**Boudica:**
Got it? Right now, we're the teachers, and you're the student.

 
**Minamoto-no-Raikou:**
Y-yes. My apologies, teacher. What was I thinking...?

 
**Emiya:**
Ready? Then let's move on to the next step.
Though I have to admit, your knife skills are impressive.

 
**Emiya:**
It's something of a unique technique, but in the end things are cut properly, so I really shouldn't criticize.

 
**Boudica:**
No, no. We should be warning her about that, don't you think?

 
**Boudica:**
Slicing ingredients by throwing them into the air is...you know...probably not ideal.

 
**Boudica:**
Yeah... That's no good. Let's start over, with the basics.

 
**Emiya:**
Right. Then let's begin with the proper handling of a knife.

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
...Yes, I have a bad feeling about this.

 
**Fou:**
Foufou, fou. Kyuuu.

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
I don't want to think about what's awaiting us when we return to Chaldea... No, no, it's just a wild hunch...


**--ARROW--:**

**Shuten-Douji:**
Look at this. It's like a harem of my very own.

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
I have a golden-haired, blue-eyed brat to my right. I have Master on my left. Ready to take me from behind, a red-eyed boy.

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
I have good wine. All I need is a moon in the sky above, watching over it all...

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
I can't ask for anything more. Heehee, what do you think? Why not spend a night with me like this?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
From behind...?
 
**Shuten-Douji:**
You know, take me out. The red-eyed boy may look innocent, but in truth he is a savage.

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
He has a kunai ready to slip between my ribs if I do anything silly.

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
Or maybe he has a thing for me? Yours may be a bit diluted, but we are still of the same blood. Let's be friendly.

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
N-no. I was simply admiring...
(She's not wrong about me watching her, though...)

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Nonononono.
 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
That's my Boss! Hit her where it hurts!
Tell her you ain't listening to her hogwash!

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
Oh, you two meanies are no fun.
Well then, how about you? Kotarou, was it?

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
Why not relax a bit? You are all so busy all the time.
It wouldn't kill you to take it easy once in a while.

 


---
 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
No. Staying here too long would be dangerous. We must do what we came here to do, and return immediately.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
That's a sound argument. Now, floor it.
We're almost at the summit.

 
**Fou:**
Fou, fooou!

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Yeah, you're right. A long stay's a no-go since it's a short-term Rayshift.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
We just came here to get some cleanup done.
Nothing more, nothing less. Let's get this over with.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
From what I heard, the history of the Singularity after the Grail gets retrieved is different.

 
**Mash:**
Yes. The irregularities that occur in a Singularity do not get properly recorded into human history.

 
**Mash:**
However, based on what King Gilgamesh said, they don't get entirely undone, either...

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Right. It doesn't completely go away.
It's not like tears and screams can just be erased.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Besides. If bad things are left behind, they might have an effect on the periods that come after.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
That's what this cleanup is about. Just a little finishing touch on the Demonic Front. We gotta put a stop to the misdeeds of any family members who might be affiliated with us!

 
**Mash:**
Affiliated with us? That means...

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
Oh. How very odd.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
...Got a problem with that?

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
No. I'm not sure what, but something in my chest... See, hold out your hand. Right or left side, doesn't matter. See?

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Huh!?

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
Cop a feel of my chest.
Oh, Master. Master. I want Master to do it. See?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I mean, if it's for the mission...
 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Boss, she'll eat you up. You better stop.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Hard pass.
 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
That's the right answer. She'll eat you right up if you just grope at her.

 


---
 
**Shuten-Douji:**
Oh don't say that! I wouldn't just eat Master! Probably. Maybe.

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
Wh-what do you mean maybe!?

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
What the brat said just triggered me. I didn't know he thought about me that way, and so I...

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
And so it made me a bit peckish and eating a human or two would be just the thing. My bad.

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
I was serious, but not serious.
Heehee. I'm sure Master won't understand.

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
Please don't just eat us on a whim! Shuten-Douji is exactly what I had heard... Truly wicked, even for an oni!

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
That's right. She's an oni. Ain't no two ways about it, she's nothin' like a human.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Oni live as oni. They kill as oni. They live their lives however they want and don't change for anyone.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
They ain't just mere beasts. They got some things in common with humans, but you better believe they ain't human!

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
That's probably why things turned out the way they did here. They don't give a rip what happens to human history.

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
Teehee. You understand us well.

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
How strange. The brat should be human, but...

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
He understands us so well. More than a certain someone who would do just about anything for the promise of chocolate.

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
You sure know what we're all about.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
You guys weren't exactly subtle, either. Even if it's something you like, you destroy it. Kill. Backstab.

 
**Mash:**
Enemy signals up ahead! I detect multiple large magical energy responses, Senpai!

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
...They've finally made their appearance.
Boss, let's have at 'em!

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
...?

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
...Who goes there?

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
This mountain is mine. You don't seem to know what happens to those who trespass.

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
I shall shred your bodies and devour your flesh. I shall gnaw at those bones of yours and toss them away!

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
I am this mountain's master.
I am also the leader of the very first group of bandits!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Banana!

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Don't tell me you're still here from Gilgamesh's summoning...


---
 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
She's...! Ibaraki-Douji, one of the seven Servants summoned by King Gilgamesh!

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
According to Chaldea's records about the Seventh Singularity, her whereabouts were unknown. But who would have thought...!

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
Oh, it's you. You're that nasty king's friend!

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
No, wait. Aren't you the red-eyed boy?
Did you finally decide to work for me?

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
Haha, I knew it! You finally realized that I am a much better master to serve than that stupid king!

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
Tomoe was terrifying, but you're acceptable! As a foreign oni, let's rain terror on this kingdom together!

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
...Um, I hate to say this, but this is the first time we've met. The “me” that you're talking about is different than “me.”

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
What? Hmmmm, now that you mention it, you smell different. Are you a ghost or something?

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
No matter. I'll say it again: I won't obey anyone!

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
I'm an oni, the master of this mountain!
Tell your king that the king of oni rules here!

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Uruk's king is not around anymore. He completed his task and died. He pulled back at the right time.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
As for you... Well, I know you don't care about human history.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
I bet you didn't form any bonds with the King of Heroes, so you don't feel any obligation to anyone.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Which means you just have to live on as an oni.
And while that may work for you...

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Quit roosting on someone else's mountain! You're the oni of Mt. Ooe! Master of the ten raging flames!

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
Wh-what!? Why do you talk like you know me?

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
You may not know, but we know, you idiot!

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
Now, now, she's still being true to who she is, so don't blame her.

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
Right, Ibaraki? Is being on a different mountain really that fun?

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
That form, that voice... Could it be Shuten? Shuten-Douji!? Wh-why are you here?

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
Is this an illusion? A dream? No, no. Looking closer, the big brawny guy looks familiar...

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
He looks like he has some colored plates over his eyes, but that golden hair and those thick arms that're too big for any human... YOU!

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
SAKATA KINTOKI!?

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Damn straight!!!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Oh right, like Ushiwakamaru, Benkei, and Leonidas...

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
She doesn't have any memories of Chaldea!
 


---
 
**Mash:**
Yes, so it seems. How the Servants retain their memories in the Singularity...

 
**Mash:**
...is something the staff is looking into, but it seems like she has absolutely no memory of Chaldea!

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Ain't no thing! A chance encounter is a sign of divine approval!

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
We can't just let a familiar face causin' trouble slide!
We gotta do somethin' about it!

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
...Wh-what!?

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
You're just tryin' to live your life. Not your fault, really.
I wonder what I would've done in your shoes.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
But it ain't right for you to stay here forever!

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Just think of human history as the surface of a pond. You bein' here's like someone tossin' a pebble in.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Y'know what happens on impact? Makes a splash, and every droplet in that splash represents a different person.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Can't really know what'll happen, to be honest. There may be people who will cry, or some might laugh.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
But even so...

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
There's a possibility that someone who shouldn't've gotten hurt will get hurt.

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
...

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
...No. Not just a possibility. People WILL get hurt. Then they'll scream. That's right. Someone definitely screamed. They wanted my help.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
I heard it. I don't know how or why, but I heard a cry for help.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
So... Sorry, Ibaraki-Douji. I've got no choice but to boot your ass back to the Throne of Heroes.

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
I don't understand! Not at all! Not one bit!
What are you even talking about!?

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
You heard a voice? What? I don't hear anything at all!

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
But yeah... One thing's clear. Sakata Kintoki. As long as I make a great show of killing you right here...

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
...Shuten over there will snap out of it.
Good, good, that's good!

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
...I have to thank you, Kintoki!
You brought my friend right to me!

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
I shall slaughter you all, and create a new Mt. Ooe with Shuten!

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
Ibaraki-Douji is approaching!

 
**Mash:**
Senpai, please be careful!
Ibaraki-Douji is not the only one there!

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Hah! Demonic Beasts from the Age of Gods, I see! They're formidable opponents! Let's do this!

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Behold my golden broadaxe shining in the distance! Watch as it suppresses celestial demons and strikes down yasha!

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
I'm goin' golden full throttle! This is gonna be Sakata Kintoki's great oni extermination!


**--BATTLE--:**

**Mash:**
Defeat of the enemy Servant has been confirmed! Senpai, you won!

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
Why... Why? Why must I disappear...?

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
I didn't do anything wrong... I didn't even eat any of the humans who fled here from Uruk or whatever it was...

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
They didn't think they'd survive there...
All I did was make them my minions for a while...

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
I was just...living my life... That's all...

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
With the weaklings... With those unknown deformed beasts... Together... That's all...

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
...Oh, but... Yeah, that's right.

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
For the longest time, it wasn't enough for me... It didn't matter that there were humans around or that those conniving beasts would slink over.

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
There's nobody here. Do you understand?
No one who knows me, or who talks to me...

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
It wasn't long before the humans left. Said they were gonna check on Uruk&ndash;excuses like that&ndash;and just up and left.

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
None of them ever came back. I'm sure they died.

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
The deformed beasts are getting weaker by the day.
Had they not been killed, they would've died out soon...

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
...They were all trembling with fear. They just treated me like a bonfire to huddle around for warmth.

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
But really, I was trembling just like them.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
...

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
Shuten... Kintoki...

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
I... I...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...


---
 
**Shuten-Douji:**
Hmmm? Say it, Ibaraki.

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
Shuten... Oh, you're right there. Shuten-Douji...

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
Atop this unfamiliar mountain, all by myself... I was...

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
...I was so lonely...

 
**Mash:**
Confirmed disappearance of Ibaraki-Douji.
Same with the demons.

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
...Lord Kintoki.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Yep. That'll do it. Sorry I roped you into my family problems.

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
Oh, no need to apologize!
I didn't... Please don't worry about it.

 
**Fuuma Kotarou:**
You and Master made the right choice, Lord Kintoki.
If you hadn't intervened, the incarnated Ibaraki-Douji would likely have affected history.

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
Right. You had no choice. And if you were killed during this deadly battle, that would be the end of that.

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
Besides... Heehee...teehee hee...

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
I've never seen the brat be so... Heehee... Oh, too funny! This is too much, I just don't know what to do with myself!

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
...The hell?

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
That's the second time you've called us “family.” I wonder what I should tell Ibaraki once we get back to Chaldea.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Oh, yeah...

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
He did say that.
 


---
 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
!!!

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Well, that... Don't you dare! That's not golden at all!

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
Oh that is absolutely not my problem. This has been such a treat. Mash, hurry and take us back.

 
**Mash:**
Uh, okay. All right everyone, the temporary Rayshift ends here. Commencing return Rayshift from the Seventh Singularity!

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
...What? I have no business with you lot. Scram.

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
I need to meet up with Nitocris.
Move it or die. And die, Sakata Kintoki.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Shut up. Maybe you don't got business with us, but we got business with you!

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
Oh???

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
You see... Um...

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
What? Use your words.
You're not just teasing me, are you?

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Uh, well you see... Yeah... Just wanted to say sorry. I was trying to tell myself it's okay but it just didn't seem right to me.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
I know it's pointless telling you this, but I won't be satisfied if I don't!

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
So... Sorry again. Sorry on a buncha levels.

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
Fool! You're making no sense!

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
...Yeah, guess not. At least take this.
Here.

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
A pouch? What's this? Something's inside...

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
(Rustle rustle)

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
...What!? Could it be...!?

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
You like chocolates, right? I put in a buncha different kinds. Ain't exactly an apology gift or nothin', but...

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
At least I wrapped it in golden wrapping paper.
Well, if you like it, have at it. See ya.

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
Don't you dare come say you want it back!
(Munch) (Nom nom)

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Like hell I'd say that!

 
**Minamoto-no-Raikou:**
Wh-wha-wha-what...!? What is going on? Why is my dear, sweet Kintoki giving that pest a present!?

 
**Minamoto-no-Raikou:**
This...this is not acceptable! I didn't raise him right!
I must act! I have no other choice but to assail&mdash;
Hmmmf!? (Munch)

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Calm down, Mother.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
He had his reasons.
 


---
 
**Minamoto-no-Raikou:**
Master, but...! No! They say that one mustn't get too attached!

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
Heehee. Oh? Are we no more than household pets to you? That may be, but do try not to be so silly.

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
But still... Whether that brat treats us like someone's child, or a dog or cat...

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
He does have a few human qualities left to him...
