# Suzuka Gozen

## A High School Girl Stroll in Chaldea

**Mash:**
Here, Senpai, I brought you some tea.

 
**Mash:**
I think this pot turned out better than the one I made yesterday... How is it?

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Perfect.


---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Every pot you make comes out better than the last.

---
 


 
**Mash:**
I'm glad to hear that.
Okay, I'll pour myself a cup too&ndash;

 
**Mash:**
...?

 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
OMG! I, like, can't even! You're MY Master,
Master, so you've gotta, like, do something!

 
**Mash:**
Suzuka, what's wrong?
Here, have some tea first.

 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
Tea? OMG you're like, so considerate! I'm so touched knowing Mash can really look after people.

 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
This Jasmine tea is delish! BTW, this tea actually goes really well with Japanese sweets...

 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
...AND THAT'S NOT WHY I'M HERE!
The tea is, like, so good though...

 
**Mash:**
Then...why are you here?

 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
Why? Do you even have to ask!?
Isn't it freakin' obvious? I am literally...

 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
...bored AF!!!

 
**Mash:**
...Huh?

 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
I have got, like, nothing but time here.
I mean, I'm a high school girl!

 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
We should like...not ever have entire days in our planners empty!

 
**Mash:**
I-I see... A teenage girl, huh...

 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
We can't fall even one day behind! We gotta, like, keep up with the trends and stuff or we'll end up looking like total losers!

 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
It's how us high school girls gotta live!
It's, like, an actual war!

 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
Now that I'm all, like, materialized, I'm not wasting another second hanging around this boring dump! YFM?

 
**Mash:**
R-right...

 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
Hm? Hold up...
(Staaare)

 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
...You said your name's Mash, right?
How old are you again?

 
**Mash:**
Me? Well, it's sort of complicated in my case...

 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
 
Really!? Aren't you, like, at LEAST high school age!?
Such a waste... Oh wait, maybe this is actually, like, perfect?

 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
'Cuz, like, you'd be perfect for what high school girls do. You know, like cliques and stuff!

 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
All right Mash, you come with me.
Oh, I guess you can come too, Master.

 
**Mash:**
Huh? Where are we going?

 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
Dunno. We don't, like, have to have a destination, do we?

 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
We can figure that out later. I just wanna get outta here and chat a little and stuff.

 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
It'd rock if there was someplace we could chill, like a mall, but since there isn't, we'll just have to settle for walking around this Chaldea place.

 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
I mean, you could even, like, show me around if you wanna. I don't know this place at all.

 
**Mash:**
Well, I don't mind giving you a tour, but,
it doesn't have to be right NOW, does it...?

 
**Mash:**
Senpai and I were just enjoying a nice,
relaxing teatime while we&ndash;

 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
C'mon, let's GO already!
We're burning daylight or whatever! (Tug, tug)

 
**Mash:**
Well...umm...I guess I can't refuse...

 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
Haha! It's not every day you get to go on a walk with two cute high schoolers hanging all over you.
Isn't Fujimaru like the luckiest [♂ guy /♀️ girl] out there?

 
**Mash:**
I... I'm a staff member of Chaldea, not a student...

 
**Mash:**
Um, Suzuka, please don't take this the wrong way,
but you're not really in high school, right...?

 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
Hey, don't get hung up on the details, Mash.

 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
It's like they say, you're only as old as you feel,
right? And I am for sure a teenager at heart!

 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
Now shut up about all that age crap and show me around! Oooh, where's the nearest crêpe stand? Real high school girl walks totes need munchies!

 
**Mash:**
I'm afraid we don't have any food stands here...
But there is a tearoom up ahead.

 
**Mash:**
See the sign that says “Moonlight”? It used to be an empty storeroom until Dr. Roman fixed it up.

 
**Mash:**
I'm told it has AV equipment, soundproofed walls,
and even a karaoke machine.

 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
Karaoke! Oh that is just, like,
a perfect place to stop for our walk!

 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
Besides, you've gotta have mad karaoke skills when you go out to mixers and stuff!

 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
Not gonna lie, I'm pretty good when it comes to music. So good I drew out Takamaru when he was hiding in a cave.

 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
Oh but to set the record straight, karaoke isn't about who's the best singer.

 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
The most important part about karaoke is having fun and making sure everyone can enjoy it.

 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
Oh this will totes help me max out my high school girl game! C'mon, what're we still doing here!?

 
**Mash:**
Okay, let's go pay it a visit. But I don't know much about singing, so I'll probably just stick to listening.

 
**Mash:**
...

 
**Mash:**
(Speaking of which, I remember asking about this karaoke machine...)

 
**Mash:**
(...Da Vinci was deadly serious when she said it would be better if I don't go near it for a while... I wonder why?)

 
**Mash:**
Here we are.

 
**Mash:**
...? I think I hear something inside...
Maybe someone's already using it?

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I've got a bad feeling about this.

---


**Fujimaru 2:**
Oh great, here we go...

---


 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
Oh? Is another high school girl in there?
C'mon Mash, Fujimaru, let's go meet them!

 
**Nero:**
 
I am the♪...per... p-p-p-per!

 
**Nero:**
 
Perfectest emperOR♪ (Bleat)

 
**Elisabeth:**
 
Bloody, bloody, nice and bloody♪

 
**Elisabeth:**
 
Hyper Idol ShowTIME♪ (Squawk)

 
**Mash:**
...!

 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
Th-the hell...!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
GAAAAAAH!

---


**Fujimaru 2:**
(Go into shock)

---


 
**Mash:**
Senpai!? Hang in there, Senpai!
Please, get a hold of yourself!

 
**Nero:**
Heh, your lovely singing voice gave my goosebumps goosebumps, Lancer! I am reminded once again why you are my rival!

 
**Elisabeth:**
I'm impressed by your devilish singing too, Saber. I never would've guessed you had an auditory train wreck like that up your sleeve, given your adorable looks.

 
**Elisabeth:**
That was good. Great, even! So awful it was perfect!
And you were so off-key you were like a locked door.

 
**Nero:**
As in the door to success!? Please, stop!
You'll make me blush!

 
**Elisabeth:**
And I love your Tyrant Burning Shout!
It'd be the perfect...for a top idol like me!

 
**Mash:**
It's...Nero and Elisabeth. They seem to be smiling and glaring at each other simultaneously...

 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
Wha... What WAS that singing? That was, like, the ACTUAL WORST! My brain is trying to shut off my sense of hearing...

 
**Nero:**
Hm? And just WHAT do you mean by that?

 
**Nero:**
You there, Fox Ears! Just because you are a devoted fan lured by the siren song of my beautiful music does not give you the right to simply listen for free!

 
**Elisabeth:**
Yeah! Where do you get off sighing during our recital!? Beat it, before we start charging admission!

 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
Yikes... Admission? For karaoke?
That is, like, so not funny.

 
**Mash:**
I'm afraid it's no joke, Suzuka. Hard as it must be to believe, they are both completely serious.

 
**Mash:**
As far as they're both concerned, singing gives their lives purpose. They would never joke about it.

 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
Oh... Okay...
So that's these chicks' deal, huh...

 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
...Chill... I must stay chill... Their songs might've almost knocked me out cold but karaoke isn't about who's the best singer!

 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
...Not just me, but EVERYONE has to enjoy karaoke... Yeah...we should be having fun. All right!

 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
Ahem... What you two think about your singing is like totally not my business, and it's not my place to critique it or anything, y'know?

 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
Some people might call your singing...unique.
But as long as you two are having fun, who cares?

 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
Anyway, if you're done...
I think it's our turn to use this room.

 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
I'm a high school girl, so I gotta do some serious karaoke training. My social life DEPENDS on it. Now get outta the way!

 
**Nero:**
Huh? Do not be ridiculous, Fox Ears.

 
**Nero:**
My performance has only just begun. How can you expect me to step off the stage after only twenty hours?

 
**Elisabeth:**
And I still have over a hundred songs to get through!
Even if most of them are just remixes.

 
**Elisabeth:**
There's my Halloween standard arrangement, my Halloween demon realm arrangement, my Halloween Goderi arrangement, my Halloween sound arrange&ndash;

 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
...I see. So you're saying you aren't going anywhere, aren't you?

 
**Mash:**
Um, Suzuka? What if you sang with them?

 
**Mash:**
Of course, Master and I just remembered something urgent we have to attend to, so we definitely won't be joining you.

 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
Uh, what? Are you nuts? I'm not singing with them!
I'm trying to improve my skills, not make them worse!

 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
Besides, I don't wanna sing with just ANYONE! You're the only other high schooler here besides me, Mash!

 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
There is, like, not enough money in the world for me to sing with Little Red Tone-Deaf Hood and her creepy idol wannabe sidekick.

 
**Mash:**
Um, as I said before,
I may technically be a teenage girl, but&ndash;

 
**Nero:**
What was that!? You dare refer to a great emperor like myself as “Little Red Tone-Deaf Hood”!? I have a most beautiful singing voice!

 
**Elisabeth:**
Creepy idol wannabe...sidekick!?

 
**Elisabeth:**
Heh, hehe, hehehe.
Now I get it, Saber.

 
**Elisabeth:**
This girl must be...jealous of our immense talent!

 
**Nero:**
Aha, so that is it! She must be a contrarian&ndash;a “hater” who despises things that are popular.

 
**Nero:**
This only serves as proof that my singing is spreading beyond its intended audience!

 
**Nero:**
Still... Umu, it is sad that we cannot see eye to eye,
even after becoming Servants...

 
**Nero:**
...but that does not mean I shall be relinquishing this mic anytime soon. All that matters is that I am enjoying myself!

 
**Nero:**
You there, Fox Ears... Hm? Fox Ears...? For some reason, that appellation fills me with dread, but no matter.

 
**Nero:**
 
If you wish to claim this mic as your own,
you shall have to pry it out of my hands!

 
**Elisabeth:**
True. In the idol world, everything comes down to power and violence eventually.

 
**Elisabeth:**
And since I am the top idol, if you're going to try and steal my mic, you'd better be ready for a world of hurt!

 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
Ha! What are you two talking about? I don't even... Whatevs, if you're hoping for a fight then I'm totes down!

 
**Mash:**
Oh no. These incredibly powerful Servants are about to fight for an incredibly insignificant reason...!


**--BATTLE--:**

**Nero:**
Khh... I suppose my performance must have taken a greater toll on me than I realized... (Thud)

 
**Elisabeth:**
Aw man, if only I hadn't put in those two hours of high touch practice before singing... (Thud)

 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
Hehe...
Teenagers are totes the best at being greedy!

 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
Now let's get this karaoke party star&ndash;Huh?

 
**Mash:**
It seems our battle ended up destroying the machine...

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
War! What is it good for? Absolutely nothing...

 
---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Too bad we didn't get to hear you sing.


 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
Y-yeah, that sucks. I wish I could've shown you guys what real singing sounds like.

 
---

 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
(Sigh)... Oh well, guess there's nothing we can do now that it's broken.

 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
But hey, it's not like there aren't a bunch of other things we've still gotta do!

 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
C'mon, Mash and Master, let's blow this popsicle stand and find somewhere else to go!

 
**Mash:**
Hold on, let me just finish submitting the damage report and repair request... Okay, done. Although, now that I think about it, we may be better off if the machine is never repaired...

 
**Nero:**
 
(Standing up) What? The machine is broken?
In that case...

 
**Nero:**
...we shall now test our singing might free of the confines of musical accompaniment! Lancer, I challenge you to an a cappella contest! La la laaa!

 
**Elisabeth:**
 
(Standing up) Challenge accepted! A true idol has no problem keeping her fans enthralled with the power of her voice alone! Laaa!

 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
...UGH, whatevs.
Just get me away from this freak show...


**--ARROW--:**

**Suzuka Gozen:**
Hey, Master? Mash? I've said this before,
so I'm pretty sure you know what the deal is, but...

 
**Mash:**
Yes?

 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
I wanna be the cutest girl ever.
That way I'll be gucci when I finally meet “the one.”

 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
Like...I've got no idea if any other versions of me already met “the one” somewhere, or if I'm gonna meet him myself one day...

 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
...but I am totes certain he's out there.

 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
He's, like, gotta be perfect. Someone I can devote all my love and stuff to. And be a killer hot bae.

 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
Sooo, if there's any chance I might meet him, I can't just slack off on being awesomely cute, can I?

 
**Mash:**
I, uh, I see. So that's why you want to,
uh...polish your skills.

 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
Yup! So karaoke is pretty much off the list now...but I can totes hone other skills on our walk!

 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
...Besides, the way I see it, a top-tier high school girl's gotta know how to play the game, which means she's gotta be used to hanging out with guys.

 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
If my future boyfriend gets away 'cause I end up freezing at a crucial moment, that'd just be the worst, right?

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I...guess you might be right.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Wouldn't a naive, innocent girl have her own appeal?


 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
Um, no. Obviously.

 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
I mean, you HAVE heard about the whole, like, missed connection thing, right? You get ONE shot to say the right thing, and if you blow it, it's all over!

 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
So I can't just sit in my tower waiting for Prince Charming or whatever! I gotta go on the ATTACK!

 
---

 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
So! My next goal on this walk is to find a certified hottie and chat him up♪

 
**Mash:**
A, uh, certified hottie, huh...
Well, there are a good number of other Servants here.

 
**Mash:**
...While we're on the subject, what sort of things are you looking for in a romantic partner, Suzuka?

 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
Ooh, you wanna talk about boys?

 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
Hehehe, I KNEW we were totes on the same page, Mash!

 
**Mash:**
N-no, I don't think so.
I was just asking purely out of curiosity. I'm not&ndash;

 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
Right, yeah, anyways... Hmm, I don't really have a clear picture, you know? I mean, if I did, that'd sure make finding “the one” way easier.

 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
So I guess I'll know what I'm looking for when I see it.

 
**Mash:**
...I see. So you can't say anything for sure until you've actually met him...

 
**Mash:**
Does that mean you can't tell if it's fate or not until it's actually happening?

 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
Oh, yeah, totally! That's it exactly!
Don't overthink it and all, right?

 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
If you wanna talk, talk. If not, don't.
You just gotta figure it out as you go.

 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
Now come on!
I wanna see what sorta guys this place has!

 
**Diarmuid:**
Hello Master, Mash. Are you out for a walk?
...May I ask who your new friend is?

 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
Hmm...nah. He might be handsome, but he looks like he's got hella bad romantic luck. Plus, for some reason I feel like a boar would kick his ass.

 
**Diarmuid:**
...!

 
**Gilgamesh:**
Oho, is the mongrel out for a walk? You must be starved for stimulation. Very well. I am in fine spirits today, so I shall grant you an audience.

 
**Gilgamesh:**
Just this once, I will permit you to regale me with the tales of your many comedic failures. Be certain to make them entertaining.

 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
Hmm...nah. It's cool to be an influencer, but he's way too stuck-up for me. I think I'd prefer the kid we saw earlier who looks kinda like him.

 
**Gilgamesh:**
...!

 
**Astolfo:**
Hmm? What's going on? Huh? Huh?

 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
...Nah, not really my type. Plus, nobody likes a guy who's cuter than her. Nobody!

 
**Astolfo:**
...!

 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
What. The. Hell!? There are tons of good-looking guys here, so how come all I can do is swipe left? There's just something wrong with all of them!

 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
Forget finding a boyfriend! There's not even someone worth practicing my flirting on here!

 
**Mash:**
I feel oddly bad about that...

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Maybe you should try changing things up?

---


**Fujimaru 2:**
Maybe don't limit yourself to handsome young guys?

---


 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
Hmm... You might be onto something there. Maybe I should try older guys. Silver foxes are totes a thing.

 
**Mash:**
Ah. Speaking of which...

 
**Fergus:**
Hm? If it isn't Mash and Master.
I'm glad to see you both in good health.

 
**Fergus:**
And...I don't believe we've met?

 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
'Sup. I'm Suzuka, a Saber.
I'm outie five thousand. Peace.

 
**Fergus:**
Oho, a Saber, you say? What a coincidence!
The name's Fergus and I'm a Saber myself.

 
**Fergus:**
Hmm... (Staaare)

 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
...?

 
**Fergus:**
I must say, Lady Suzuka...
You are one fine woman.

 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
 
Eh? A-ahaha, for real?
Aw, that's so sweet.

 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
I guess that super jacked look can work.

 
**Fergus:**
Haha, I see, I see. In that case, Lady Suzuka...maybe we should have ourselves a little “sparring” session?

 
**Fergus:**
You seem like you have energy to spare.
I would love to have you as my partner.

 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
Oh... You mean that thing swordsmen like to get up to? Hmm... Yeah, why not? I was getting kinda tired of just strolling around.

 
**Mash:**
Senpai. Senpai!

 
**Mash:**
Is it just me, or are the two of them speaking English and still somehow managing to not be speaking the same language?

 
**Fergus:**
Then you accept? Wonderful.

 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
So where do you wanna do this thing? I passed a training room earlier if you wanna go at it there.

 
**Fergus:**
Oho, the training room, you say? I was thinking either your room or mine...but I see you prefer someplace a little...roomier! Very well, I gladly accept.

 
**Fergus:**
Ahh, I can't wait to get started. Despite your flippant demeanor, I knew from the moment I laid eyes on you that you were ripe for the plucking.

 
**Fergus:**
Between your full, perky breasts, your shapely bottom, and those childbearing hips, I can tell I will truly enjoy some vigorous lovemaking with you! Wahaha!

 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
 
Huh!? W-wait. When you said “partner,” you meant...
Wh-what are you, stupid or something!? What the ACTUAL HELL, creeper!?

 
**Mash:**
...I knew it.

 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
Forget it!
I take back literally everything I said before!

 
**Fergus:**
Now, now, there's nothing to be embarrassed about.
Come on. Come on. (Approaching determinedly)

 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
Wh-why you... Dammit, I knew this place was a freak show! Left swipe. Left swipe! LEFT SWIIIIIIIIPE!

 
**--BATTLE--:**

**Suzuka Gozen:**
Ugh, that sucked ass.

 
**Mash:**
I'm so sorry. Usually, he's a paragon of Sabers, and highly dependable, but he can get...carried away...

 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
You don't need to apologize!
It's that old freak with the drill who's way out of line!

 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
And where the hell's he get off calling me “ripe”!? Can't he talk about how I'm a cute teenage girl in the prime of my fricking youth!?

 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
...It's un-freakin'-believable!

 
**Mash:**
N-now, now, at least it's all over. There's a break room right over there. How about we rest a bit?

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
 
...Hehehehe. I've lost count of how many drinks this is.
But who cares? Bottoms up!

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
 
Yeah!
Wine shared with you is always special wine, Shuten!

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
And the snacks we stole off of the green Archer are sooo deliciously sweet! Mmm...

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
Now, what were we talking about again?
Oh, right. So I gave those humans an earful.

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
I said ... from the bottom of my heart...so you all must be ...! So there!

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
My, my, you must have scared them out of their minds, Ibaraki. Your transformations surprise even me sometimes.

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
Fufu... What could be scarier than a sudden, unexpected, and dramatic transformation...? I don't know WHAT I'd do if I ran into a big oni with a completely blank face...

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
...Right!? Kind of a masterstroke from me, don't you think? I wish you could've seen the looks on their faces! Ehehehehe...

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I'm surprised to find them drinking here.

---


**Fujimaru 2:**
No wonder the hallway stank of alcohol.

---


 
**Mash:**
The two oni?
They do seem to be thoroughly intoxicated.

 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
Tch, it's the oni! And I was already in a bad mood... What gives...!

 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
...Mash.
Do they do this kinda crap often?

 
**Mash:**
Yes, I'd say so.
I've seen them like this several times before.

 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
Dammit, this is exactly why&ndash;

 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
Ugh, they're annoying and I just can't with this freakin' stench! Hey! Oni!

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
Hm? Do I know you...?

 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
Do you, like, not know what a total pain you are being with all this drinking!? Get outta here!

 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
This is TOTALLY why people always say oni suck, or that they're clueless, or that they just like to attack when you're minding your own business...

 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
I mean, okay, so, like, that might've led to a couple romantic encounters or something, but that really doesn't matter anymore!

 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
Just...shape the hell up and quit making trouble for me already, oni!

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
So you say we suck? That we are clueless?
Big words from a little fox! ...Wait... You're not actually a fox, are you...?

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
Well, well... If it isn't that Demon King's princess.
I'm deliiighted to meet you.

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
Hm? You know her, Shuten?

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
It's Suzuka Gozen, daughter of the Demon King of the Fourth Heaven.

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
She lived in Japan long before I set foot in Ooe, so I haven't had the pleasure, but I've heard aaall about her.

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
...Care to join us for a drink? Oni have sooo much in common with the daughters of Demon Kings. We should get along reeeally well. What do you say?

 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
Tch... So you know who I am.
Then I have A LOT more to say to you now.

 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
Your lazy asses are why I got sent to Japan in the first place. You caused me no end of trouble.

 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
Japan is just a few tiny islands. You could have turned it into a demon kingdom in a week if you actually cared! But nooo! You failed to do so.

 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
Easy to believe all you did was get drunk even then! I suspect you only bothered attacking humans when you were bored and felt like it!

 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
An oni who doesn't know her place is bad,
but a lazy oni is just infuriating.

 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
You've got some nerve showing your lazy side to me. If you cannot be of service, then go take your useless hide somewhere and disappe&ndash;

 
**Mash:**
U-um...Suzuka?

 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
What?

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
Oh my, Suzuka. Listen to yooou!
It sounds like the reeeal you is starting to show!

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
I guess seeing an oni must have jolted you back to your true self, hmmm?

 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
 
...! I-I was...
That was just, like, an accident, 'kay?

 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
I just, like, could NOT be bothered to say how much you guys suck&ndash;though you still totes suck!

 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
Ugh, I am, like, embarrassed AF. Wait, I mean...no I'm not! Being a teenager is totes the best! We're cute, and awesome... We're just the best! Totes!

 
**Mash:**
S-Suzuka? You seem a little flustered.
You're also blushing bright red.

 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
I slipped... I can't believe I slipped...!
Being around those things forced my old self out...

 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
...That side of me is old news; this is the real me now... But since I haven't been manifested here for long, I'm still weak and immature... Even though...

 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
I decided that this time, I was gonna find true love...and stick with it...to the end... (Mumble)

 
**Mash:**
Sh-she's just facing the wall and mumbling to herself!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I think we should, like, give her some space.

---


**Fujimaru 2:**
She's, like, freaking me out.

---


 
**Mash:**
...Um, Senpai, I think her speech pattern may have...rubbed off on you a bit?

 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
...Hra! There, I'm back!
And I am a thousand percent better!

 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
Which is good, 'cause I'm, like, gonna need all the energy I can get for this next part.

 
**Mash:**
N-next part? I'm glad to hear you're feeling better now,
but...what comes next...?

 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
Oh come on, even you can totally figure that out, right?

 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
...Put the fear of god into these punk-ass oni for sending me on a cruddy trip down memory lane!

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
Mwahahaha. Did you hear that, Shuten?
I think the little demon princess is angry at us.

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
Oh, how annoying.
I don't see why she doesn't just join us for a drink.

 
**Mash:**
Uh-oh... I think we're about to get drawn into another battle. Be careful, Senpai!


**--BATTLE--:**

**Ibaraki-Douji:**
Tch... I guess they're too tough for us.
C'mon, Shuten. Let's go somewhere else.

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
Hmm, maybe I had a little too much to drink...?
A little hair of the dog should help...

 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
(Sigh)...

 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
...Just so you guys know, Master,
they were basically right about me.

 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
I'm the daughter of the Demon King of the Fourth Heaven. I'm just another Servant, just another Saber.

 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
But...that doesn't change the fact that I'm a high school girl at heart. That's just who I am now. Capisce?

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...Why did you pick that of all things?


 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
It's not about a choice!
It's about being true to myself above all!

 
**Mash:**
Actually I'm curious about that too.
If you don't mind, would you please tell us why?

 
---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Got it. All that matters is that you're cute.


 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
Aha, so you DO get it, Master.

 
**Mash:**
Still, I'm curious why you chose this of all things to begin with.

 
---

 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
(Sigh)... Look, a lot of real crazy stuff went down while I was alive.

 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
Then, after I became a Heroic Spirit, I found out what modern high school girls are like, right?

 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
They're, like, the embodiment of popularity,
beauty, and cuteness. It's just, like, super fab.

 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
Plus, they enjoy life to the fullest! So I thought, this is it. This is what I've been looking for.

 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
...Totally makes sense, right?

 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
So my wish is to find the best boyfriend ever, have the best romance ever, and get the whole happily ever after thing, 'kay?

 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
So, to do that, I decided to be the best teenage high school girl ever.

 
**Mash:**
Aha... Now I understand, Suzuka.

 
**Mash:**
You just really, really...

 
**Mash:**
...REALLY want to find romance.

 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
...Pretty much.

 
**Mash:**
...Hehe.

 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
Hey, don't you know it's, like, rude to laugh in people's faces!? C'mon, let's go to this damn break room of yours.

 
**Mash:**
Sure. I'll show you where it is.

 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
Well, well, now look who's all high and mighty...
I think it's, like, truth or dare o'clock.

 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
So, as a fellow teenage girl, you're gonna tell me the truth about your experiences with boys when we get to the break room! C'mon let's go.

 
**Mash:**
Huh? Huh!? I...I never agreed to that...!

 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
Aha, don't bother running! You're not going anywhere!
Just, like, resign yourself to your fate!
