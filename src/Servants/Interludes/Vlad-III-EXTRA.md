# Vlad III - EXTRA

## Scorched Earth

**Vlad III:**
What's wrong?
Can't sleep, my friend?

 
**Vlad III:**
Leave the night watch to me.
Humans require sleep. Rest up for tomorrow.

 
**Vlad III:**
Hm? You want to hear the story of me before I became a Heroic Spirit? You are a peculiar contractor. I must ask your forgiveness.

 
**Vlad III:**
There are no stories of THIS me worth telling.
Nor do I have any feats to boast of.

 
**Vlad III:**
I donned this armor to purge tyranny from the land...making me no different than those who had fallen.

 
**Vlad III:**
The Vlad III who was the lord of the land is no more.
I stand here before you as a general, a warrior.

 
**Vlad III:**
The only reason why I contracted with you as a Heroic Spirit was because I sensed the presence of evil.

 
**Vlad III:**
You fight for justice, and the Lord allowed me to wield my lance so long as it was under your command.

 
**Vlad III:**
I have neither principles nor ideals. I am simply a machine, impaling your enemies. What stories could such a thing possibly have to tell?

 
**Vlad III:**
Actually, now that I think about it,
perhaps I do have a reason...

 
**Vlad III:**
Maybe it is just the dying flames of our fire here,
but a peculiar vision comes to mind...

 
**Vlad III:**
Unlike the other Heroic Spirits, I've no need for a second wish. I do not even know why I fight so fiercely after my death.

 
**Vlad III:**
I lost sight of God's love. I may have believed it was real, but I had forsaken the love that I actually received. Twice.

 
**Vlad III:**
First was the goodness of the citizens...the virtuous spirit given by the nobility. And second was my other loving half who fell from the tower...

 
**Vlad III:**
I do not doubt God's love, but I never believed I would witness it ever again.

 
**Vlad III:**
But...I had a dream.

 
**Vlad III:**
Hahaha. Even Servants can dream. Our dreams, though, are no more than our way of reliving what happened in our lives.

 
**Vlad III:**
Yet mine was different. Unbelievable as it may sound, my dream was not about my past.

 
**Vlad III:**
It was a dream about a woman...a woman who was thinly frail, sickly at heart, who truly stood at death's door.

 
**Vlad III:**
The woman had lost her beloved child. Stillbirth.
The experience likely shattered her heart and mind.

 
**Vlad III:**
In despair, she refused to eat. In a cruel twist of fate, she found she could only consume those whom she truly loved.

 
**Vlad III:**
Of course, the woman was exiled from her homeland,
a fate she accepted, becoming an outcast.

 
**Vlad III:**
Humans who do not eat, without exception,
fail to survive.

 
**Vlad III:**
She might have been able to convince herself that it is the natural order of things for one life to take another for sustenance.

 
**Vlad III:**
However, she did not once consume her loved ones,
even to the day of her death.

 
**Vlad III:**
She chose the lives of others over her own. She managed to avoid terrorizing her loved ones until the end.

 
**Vlad III:**
This may sound strange to say aloud, but I believe that, through that woman, I caught just a glimpse of the love I'd lost.

 
**Vlad III:**
Just knowing such a woman exists...
I would gladly burn in the fires of hell once more.

 
**Vlad III:**
Nngh!

 
**Vlad III:**
What horrendous ghosts! Even after death,
they attempt to murder and consume the living!

 
**Vlad III:**
In life, they attacked others for their own gain, and in death their loathing of the living is born of their own suffering!

 
**Vlad III:**
Sinners who left your own prayers behind and for whom no one prays for anymore! I do not ask for your repentance! You will be no more than prey for my spear!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
That's amazing! Truly a storm of violence!
Even his armor is a weapon!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
He's like a hedgehog on fire...or a spinning guillotine...or maybe a human trench mortar...!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Is he like a black stain on a paint canvas?

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Like a snowplow train?
 


---
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Yeah, that's it! Anyway, he's just tearing his way through enemy territory!

 
**Mash:**
Doctor! Master! This really isn't the time to be making abstract metaphors about him!

 
**Mash:**
Please come back, Lord Vlad! We're detecting over a hundred enemies! We need to retreat while we still have the chance!

 
**Vlad III:**
Heh. What are you talking about, shield maiden? Do you think a mere hundred enemies is enough to stop me?

 
**Vlad III:**
It's only a few hundred arrows and a lance piercing my body!

 
**Vlad III:**
Pathetic. No more than trifles. Smelling salts would sooner go to my head than these enemies!

 
**Vlad III:**
Gu...ungh!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Lord Vlad...!

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Lancer...!
 


---
 
**Vlad III:**
Heh. That was a good strike. Now I'm awake! Time to repay you! Accept my gift from the base of your spine through the top of your head!

 
**Ghost:**
FiGiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii&mdash;!

 
**Mash:**
...

 
**Vlad III:**
What's wrong? Are the rest of these enemies cowards!? Will none of you fools challenge me one-on-one!?

 
**Vlad III:**
Then there is nothing to do but mow this lot down.
They are no more than ghosts, but they did challenge me.

 
**Vlad III:**
I will rip you apart until not a trace remains!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Ah, so that's Vlad Țepeș, the Impaler. He was an evil general, and he protected Wallachia from an army of over a million.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
I never believed those stories, but now I see the evidence of it with my own eyes!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
His battlefield philosophy is brutal! There's no surviving unless you eradicate all those enemies or force them to retreat!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Obviously, we're in good hands as long as he's around!

 
**Mash:**
This is no time to be impressed! Master, your orders!
We will support Lord Vlad in battle!


**--BATTLE--:**

**Vlad III:**
It's done.
My friend, are you safe?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Of course.
 
**Vlad III:**
Ah, you are so dependable! I am impressed that you are untroubled after witnessing one of my battles!

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Lord Vlad, are you okay?
 
**Vlad III:**
Of course. I cannot allow my friend to see me bleed.
I must confess that last enemy did a number on me, though.

 


---
 
**Vlad III:**
But honestly, this city is quite vexing.

 
**Vlad III:**
I hear it was once the site of a Holy Grail War, but does the Holy Grail War really bring about so much destruction to one place?

 
**Vlad III:**
This sight is not of this world. Some other catastrophe must've led to this horrific calamity.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
I noticed that too. It's hard to imagine even a Holy Grail going out of control could cause all this.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Well, the Greater Grail in Fuyuki was a ginormous Magical Reactor Core, so it's at least possible it could blow the whole city up.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
But for it to keep burning like this...
It doesn't make sense.

 
**Mash:**
Are there other things we don't know? Did you come with us because there's something you sensed,
Lord Vlad?

 
**Vlad III:**
It wasn't for the expedition, as I've no experience or knowledge in such things. It's just that I do not care for the particular contamination in this Singularity.

 
**Vlad III:**
There's something here. Something I loathe above all else. I'd hoped to find its source and destroy it...

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Sorry. You're out of time. The Holy Grail has already been recovered from that Singularity.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
You can't stay there long, I'm afraid. The surplus magical energy sent to Sheba is about to run out.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
I'm sure this expedition leaves you unsatisfied,
Lord Vlad, but can we have you all return right now?

 
**Vlad III:**
Ah, no need to fret, Romantic Man.

 
**Vlad III:**
Your spineless personality is deplorable, but your daily hard work and attention to detail are to be commended at least.

 
**Vlad III:**
Ah, would that all humans were so diligent as you.
Such could never be, sadly.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Welcome back, Fujimaru.
Where's Lord Vlad? Ah...he's back in standby mode.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
But I never imagined a Servant like him would point out the problem of Fuyuki.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Looking back into Fuyuki is on our to-do list,
but the next Singularity takes priority.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
After all, we are approaching the Seventh Singularity in Uruk, during the Age of Gods. Everyone will have to work their butts off, or we won't make it...

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Oh? Is something on your mind, Fujimaru? If I can be of help, I'm more than happy to lend an ear.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...I just don't understand why Lord Vlad fights...

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I heard this story, once...
 


---
 
**Dr. Roman:**
...Hm. A Servant's dream...

 
**Dr. Roman:**
You may be talking about the battle records that get engraved into their soul after they become Heroic Spirits.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
But I don't think that's a sad story.
He said “I would gladly burn in the fires of hell”...

 
**Dr. Roman:**
He doesn't mean he wants to suffer again.
I think he means he's just looking for some hope.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Even if she had to do it for her survival, the woman in his story never chose to take the life of another.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
It wasn't for her dignity or for her humanity...

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Basically... One doesn't sacrifice the lives of others for their own protection or gain.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Obvious human kindness...the way a soul should be...was something he believed in. That goes for both past and present.
