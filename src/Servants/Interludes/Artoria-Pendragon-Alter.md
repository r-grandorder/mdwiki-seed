# Artoria Pendragon (Alter)

## Generations of Alter

**Dr. Roman:**
A Rayshift into the heart of the Fuyuki Greater Grail?
It's not impossible, but why?

 
**Mash:**
I'm told it's a urgent request from Saber.
Right, Senpai?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Haha, we can't turn down a request from the corrupted Saber, can we? That King of Knights is merciless.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
But the space inside the Greater Grail isn't stable.
If you do a Rayshift, you'll likely get punted back out.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Well, I'm sure Saber has something in mind.
Let's get started.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Mash, take care of Fujimaru.
If things get dangerous, let me know right away.

 
**Mash:**
That's the plan.
Let's start the Rayshift, Senpai.

 
**Mash:**
Are we in...France?
I thought we shifted into the Greater Grail...

 
**Mash:**
Doctor? Doctor?
Come in... Doctor?

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
We can't contact him?

 
**Mash:**
...So it seems.
He said it was spatially unstable, but where are we&mdash;

 
---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I think Roman's slacking off?
 
**Fou:**
Fou!

 
**Mash:**
Fou agrees, but...I can't be sure.
I can't even establish a connection.

 
**Mash:**
The inside of the Greater Grail is like a singularity, and the connection won't be stable, he said. But where are we&mdash;

---

 
**Saber Alter:**
We're inside Greater Grail in a fragment that doesn't exist. Think of it as a place that recreates beings that became the singularities.

 
**Mash:**
Saber? You arrived first?

 
**Saber Alter:**
So you came too, Kyrielight? ...Alright, I suppose. Thank you for answering my wish, Fujimaru.

 
**Saber Alter:**
I'm amazed you believed in me enough to Rayshift inside the Greater Grail.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I want an explanation.
 
**Saber Alter:**
There's no need for one.
What you need are strong Servants.

 
**Saber Alter:**
I'm simply granting you that wish.

 
---

**Fujimaru 2:**
If it's what you want, Saber.

 
**Saber Alter:**
...I see.
If that's how you feel, then I won't hold back.

--- 

 
**Fou:**
Fou, fou!

 
**Mash:**
Master, Saber, footsteps on the road ahead!
It appears to be enemies!

 
**Saber Alter:**
Let's start with a warm-up.
We'll wipe them out, Fujimaru.


**--BATTLE--:**

**Mash:**
That Shadow Servant...
Um, Saber, is this place&mdash;

 
**Saber Alter:**
Good guess Mash.
This is one of the endings you passed by.

 
**Saber Alter:**
It's only a temporary recreation, "but for the purpose of combat," this is not an illusion.

 
**Fou:**
Fou, fooou!

 
**Mash:**
More enemies!
So this next Servant is&mdash;

 
**Saber Alter:**
Fear not. You defeated them once, and this time the fate of the world isn't at stake. Enjoy the dance of death.

 
**Mash:**
I-I can't see it that simply!
Death is really scary!

 
**Saber Alter:**
Of course, enjoy the fear I'm saying. The Heroic Spirit who entrusted himself to you would have.

 
**Mash:**
Huh?

 
**Saber Alter:**
Fujimaru, conserve your energy because the next one's the big one. Defeat this one with 60% of your strength.


**--BATTLE--:**

**Mash:**
Master, we've arrived at the throne room.
...Oh, I knew it&mdash;

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
&mdash;Tsk, I wondered why "I was here" suddenly.
So this is why.

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
How truly upsetting. What is this?
More of that nightmare?

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
Whose idea was it to drag out a fake who's already been defeated once?

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
Was it that Master there? Or that girl?
No, that's not right.

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
Only a Heroic Spirit as tainted as me could come up with a bad idea like this.

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
Am I wrong?
You, Britain's tainted King of Knights?

 
**Saber Alter:**
&mdash;You're talkative.
Did Jeanne d'Arc talk a lot as well?

 
**Saber Alter:**
No, I'm sure she did.
She was happy to be called the Maiden of Orleans.

 
**Saber Alter:**
I'm sure she liked to talk.
What can I say, she had the mind of a peasant.

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
&mdash;Huh? What's your problem?
Are all Britons idiots?

 
**Mash:**
(Senpai, the air is choking with danger!
There was no room for talking, anyway!)

 
**Saber Alter:**
Of course.
We're here to defeat this woman.

 
**Saber Alter:**
Fujimaru, you are an inexperienced Master.
Fight stronger, more terrifying foes and polish your skills.

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
Oh, so that's it. The kind King of Knights has prepared a trial for that Master.

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
Very well, I accept. But be careful,
I'm vulgar and very violent&mdash;

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
And after what you did to me last time, I'm ready to rip your head from your neck!

 
**Mash:**
Master, she's serious!
Be extremely careful!

 
**Saber Alter:**
A splendid yell, flag-bearer.
I'm glad I chose you as an opponent.

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
What? Trying to be a friendly? Disgusting! You think we can be best friends just because we're both evil?

 
**Saber Alter:**
No, I simply chose a worthy opponent to crush.
I've no emotional attachments towards you.

 
**Saber Alter:**
But I will say one thing...

 
**Saber Alter:**
Shadow of Jeanne d'Arc, born of the Grail,
you said we were both tainted beyond measure&mdash;

 
**Saber Alter:**
But from where I stand, you are far more tainted than me.

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
Hehe&mdash;That's my line, mere clone of that coward King Vortigern!


**--BATTLE--:**

**Jeanne Alter:**
...Okay, okay, I lost, I lost.

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
I don't have a grudge against your Master, so I'll be a good girl and disappear.

 
**Mash:**
Enemy Servant annihilation confirmed...
Whew. That was a tough fight...

 
**Saber Alter:**
...Sympathy for two people who fell to evil, huh?
I can't deny that.

 
**Saber Alter:**
I chose to rule by violence and instinct, and you chose to rule by fear and reason.

 
**Saber Alter:**
The more a Heroic Spirit was bound by ideals in their former life, the more they possess a twisted side like us.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Saber...

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
You and that Jeanne are different.

---
 

 
**Saber Alter:**
That's just what you believe.
But&mdash;a Servant obeys their Master.

 
**Saber Alter:**
As long as you believe that, I won't be a fool and believe otherwise.

 
**Saber Alter:**
Also, your skills have improved a bit Fujimaru.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Of course!

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
A little, but yeah.

---
 

 
**Saber Alter:**
Glad to hear it.
Let's return to Chaldea.

 
**Saber Alter:**
Women like Jeanne and I are only useful like this.
If there's a next time, I'll find you another strong foe.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
You're back!
What happened to you two?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Communications went dead, and for a moment the Humanity Foundation value for Fuyuki and France reverted to negative!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
A lot happened.

 
**Mash:**
...It's as Senpai says.
So much has happened and it's hard to explain.

 
---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I'm tired and going to my room.

 
**Fou:**
Fou, fooouu...

---

 
**Dr. Roman:**
I-Is that so? Sure, I guess.
You two look exhausted, and things are okay for now.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Okay, I'll call an end to this Rayshift for now...
But something seems strange.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
You guys didn't go to an amusement park or something without me, right? ...Nah, no way!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
There's no way you could just Rayshift to the Greater Grail, and fight a bonus stage with powerful opponents you've already encountered!

 
**Fou:**
Fou, fooouu...


## Two Sides of a Coin

**Saber Alter:**
Another chance has come, Fujimaru.
Rayshift into the Greater Grail.

 
**Mash:**
A-Again?
Last time it was evil Jeanne, so this time...

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Thug Emperor Nero?

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Good-goody Lancelot?

---
 

 
**Fou:**
Mm, kyukyu, kyui!

 
**Saber Alter:**
You'll see when you get there...
Though to tell the truth, I don't know myself.

 
**Mash:**
You don't? You mean you can't pinpoint who it is we'll be fighting?

 
**Saber Alter:**
No, I have chosen the opponent.
What I'm saying is&mdash;

 
**Saber Alter:**
I don't know who that person is. It seems like that one is fundamentally different than the other Heroic Spirits.

 
**Mash:**
Fundamentally different... Was there someone like that? Oh, I feel like Elisabeth might be different.

 
**Saber Alter:**
That one is just a weird.
...Well, you'll sense it when we arrive.

 
**Mash:**
These are the Roman plains?
I was sure it would be another throne room...

 
**Fou:**
Fooouu!

 
**Mash:**
Th-This rumble...a giant?
No, it's an army of giant golems!

 
**Mash:**
What is that? They're burying the horizon!
It's like the Great Wall of China is advancing on us...

 
**Mash:**
They're heading right for us!
Saber, is that our opponent?

 
**Saber Alter:**
...I think not, but I don't know.
That golem army might be the same as that one.

 
**Saber Alter:**
Either way, we're busting through the wall Fujimaru. They don't see us as enemies.

 
**Saber Alter:**
They're just like a massive steamroller that crushes everything before it.

 
**Saber Alter:**
There's nothing to be gained by fighting them, and there are too many to defeat.

 
**Saber Alter:**
Concentrate on a few and open a gap in the wall!


**--BATTLE--:**

**Mash:**
Wow...
It's like a tsunami.

 
**Mash:**
Those giants have no will of their own, but there seems to be a will guiding them.

 
**Mash:**
"End all civilization on this planet." I'm not sure,
but that's what their command sounds like...

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
That's an exaggeration...

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I feel it...

---
 

 
**Saber Alter:**
They certainly won't halt. &mdash;Do not be afraid.
Fujimaru, we shall pierce through the second wave as well.

 
**Saber Alter:**
Our real target lies beyond this wall of giants.
We shall see if Mash's instincts were correct!


**--BATTLE--:**

**Mash:**
We made it past the giants! That's the Heroic Spirit Altera, the one we saw in Rome!

 
**Altera:**
...So a lifeform besides me appears in my dream?
Answer me. Who are you?

 
**Saber Alter:**
That's what I want to know, white Heroic Spirit.
Mash called you Altera, but&mdash;

 
**Saber Alter:**
Are you really Altera? You don't seem like the conqueror they called the Scourge of God.

 
**Altera:**
...You disturb my dream, and then insult me?
You are...Britain's King of Knights, yes?

 
**Altera:**
I am Altera.
My appearance and this blade are proof of that.

 
**Altera:**
&mdash;Answer me.
What makes you doubt the truth that I speak?

 
**Altera:**
If your answer displeases me, I'll show no mercy.
I'll incinerate you and this world.

 
**Mash:**
(Senpai, she seems to understand us more, but she sounds a lot more angry!)

 
**Mash:**
(But I understand that feeling.)

 
**Mash:**
(If this is Altera's dream, it would be embarrassing for others to see it!)

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Sorry, we didn't mean to pry into your dreams...

 
**Altera:**
...It doesn't matter if you intended to or not.
The fact is, you're humiliating me.

 
---

**Fujimaru 2:**
You've got some crazy dreams.

 
**Altera:**
...I know.
Even I don't know why I have these dreams.

 
**Altera:**
But&mdash;that's why I can't forgive you.
You have peeked into my inexplicable dreams.

 
---
 
**Altera:**
Answer me.
Why do you mock me so?

 
**Saber Alter:**
...Why, you ask?
I finally understand now after coming here.

 
**Saber Alter:**
Oh great conqueror and Heroic Spirit Altera.
You have become a paradox.

 
**Saber Alter:**
Some kings conquer to satisfy their people.
Some kings rule to satisfy their own greed.

 
**Saber Alter:**
Each definition of kingship varies.
Everyone has their own ideology, and justifiable goals.

 
**Saber Alter:**
But&mdash;you are different.
You are a conqueror and a destroyer.

 
**Saber Alter:**
Some kings bring destruction in their conquest,
but no king brings destruction after a conquest.

 
**Saber Alter:**
That is not a king who rules man.
That is a Demon God who denies the world of man.

 
**Saber Alter:**
I ask again, Heroic Spirit Altera.
Are you really&mdash;a Heroic Spirit like us?

 
**Altera:**
&mdash;I have no answer for that. As the head of the Huns,
I simply fought and slew our enemy.

 
**Altera:**
It was you people who called me a king, a hero, a God of War.

 
**Altera:**
Or would you, a fellow Heroic Spirit, deny me?
Just like me, you can only destroy.

 
**Altera:**
&mdash;I don't like you.
I don't like you at all.

 
**Altera:**
Begone from my dream. This plain of destruction is mine alone. I don't want to see any humans!

 
**Mash:**
Wow... All the Mana in the atmosphere is being drawn into her blade!

 
**Mash:**
So that is the Sword of Mars, the Noble Phantasm that can incinerate the world!

 
**Saber Alter:**
Excellent. Altera herself was a disappointment,
but that Noble Phantasm is a worthy foe.

 
**Saber Alter:**
If it's going to swallow all the Mana in the world,
it will be an excellent opponent.

 
**Saber Alter:**
My heart is that of a dragon.
The Od in my body shall resist the breath of the World.

 
**Saber Alter:**
Let's go, Master!
It's time to see whose Noble Phantasm is the strongest!


**--BATTLE--:**

**Altera:**
That...sword...was tempered inside the planet itself...
It's a true Divine Weapon?

 
**Altera:**
I know it...I know this pain...
That's...What era was that&mdash;

 
**Mash:**
Heroic Spirit Altera annihilation confirmed.
Did we...win?

 
**Saber Alter:**
So it seems. I thought she was like Jeanne, another Heroic Spirit twisted by the Grail, but&mdash;

 
**Saber Alter:**
It seems she was twisted from before.
Enough that she herself didn't know who she was.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
What are we going to do about this?

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Saber, the world's collapsing!

---
 

 
**Saber Alter:**
Don't worry, this is Altera's dream.
Since she disappeared, the dream will wake up.

 
**Saber Alter:**
Our minds will return as the world ends.
It may leave a small aftertaste, but do not fret.

 
**Mash:**
S-So we're experiencing a simulation of the end of the world... This is the kind of bad feeling I don't want to know...

 
**Saber Alter:**
Forgive me.
I tried to be of use to my Master, but this time I failed.

 
**Saber Alter:**
Once this world ends, let us meet again. Don't worry Fujimaru, it wasn't a complete waste.

 
**Saber Alter:**
Battling Altera increased my own power. I shall show you an even more powerful slash in our next battle.

 
**Mash:**
Oh, Saber just left without us!
Senpai, we, um...

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
We'll wait until it's completely white.

---
 
**Mash:**
I-I knew it&mdash;!

 
---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Mash, close your eyes if you're scared.

---
 
**Mash:**
I-I can't!
Closing my eyes just makes me more scared!

 

 
**Mash:**
I'm done doing favors for Alter! Senpai, next time,
think more about your actions, okay!
