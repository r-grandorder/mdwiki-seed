# Lancelot - Berserker

## Knight of Owner

**Mash:**
Ahh...
This breeze certainly feels nice, doesn't it Senpai?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
It sure does, by the way...
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
It sure does, come to think of it...
 


---
 
**Dr. Roman:**
I was wondering why you brought a Berserker to such a peaceful picnic.

 
**Lancelot:**
...

 
**Mash:**
Doctor, Lancelot may be a Berserker, but I think if you talk to him he'll understand.

 
**Mash:**
He's a reasonable Berserker, so I think it's all right.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
A reasonable Berserker...
He couldn't be a Berserker then, could he...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
He can understand us?
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
To be honest, it seems that way.
 


---
 
**Mash:**
Yes...
He does seem to understand us.

 
**Fou:**
Foou?

 
**Lancelot:**
![berserk2](https://i.imgur.com/7VYgcEB.png)&ndash;!!!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Gah! I knew it!
He doesn't understand us!

 
**Mash:**
No, that's not it! &ndash;Senpai! It's an enemy attack!
Get behind me! I'll intercept th...

 
**Mash:**
Huh?
Where's my shield?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Come to think of it, where is it?
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Sorry, I put our lunches on it...
 


---
 
**Mash:**
Oh! It still has our lunches on it!
Senpai, watch out!

 
**Lancelot:**
![berserk2](https://i.imgur.com/7VYgcEB.png)&ndash;!!!

 
**Mash:**
Lancelot!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
He used the chopsticks&ndash;
to stop the attack... That's amazing...

 
**Mash:**
So that's the skill of the Knight of Owner.
Bravo, Lancelot!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
But those chopsticks won't hold out for long!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Can he use something else as a weapon?
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I think we need to get Mash's shield...
 


---
 
**Fou:**
Foou!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Huh? ...What did you find, Fou?
That's a log! Well done, Fou!

 
**Mash:**
Take it, Lancelot!

 
**Lancelot:**
![berserk2](https://i.imgur.com/7VYgcEB.png)&ndash;!!!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Whoa! Just touching that log he instantly transformed it into a Noble Phantasm-level weapon!


**--BATTLE--:**

**Mash:**
They're still coming!
Senpai, your orders!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Our pleasant picnic is ruined...
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Lancelot, a fresh log for you!
 


---
 
**Lancelot:**
![berserk2](https://i.imgur.com/7VYgcEB.png)&ndash;!!!


**--BATTLE--:**

**Mash:**
This is the last wave of enemies!
Lancelot, your log&mdash;

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
It's bashed to bits. A new log for you!
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Thank goodness there's a forest nearby!
 


---
 
**Lancelot:**
![berserk2](https://i.imgur.com/7VYgcEB.png)&ndash;!!!

 
**Mash:**
H-He seems upset! Master, it seems as if he's had it with logs, and wants a real weapon!


**--BATTLE--:**

**Mash:**
Whew... Somehow, we fought them off.
You were a great help, Lancelot!

 
**Lancelot:**
...

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Knight of Owner... I see.
But, can logs and chopsticks be counted as weapons?

 
**Mash:**
I've heard of a great swordsman in ancient Japan who used chopsticks to defeat an insect-like monster, so I don't think it's unusual.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Wow, you sure know a lot...
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Was that Musashi?
 


---
 
**Mash:**
Yes. But even then, they wouldn't work as weapons without Lancelot's unparallel abilities.

 
**Lancelot:**
![berserk1](https://i.imgur.com/XAqlQYL.png)!!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
What? Another enemy attack?
...Or not. Is he communicating with us?

 
**Mash:**
I'm sure that's it.
Don't you agree Senpai?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Huh? Well...
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
So it seems.
 


---
 
**Lancelot:**

**Fou:**
Fou!


## For Someone's Glory

**Mash:**
Lancelot's...face?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Yeah. See, he's always wearing that helmet, right?
Don't you want to see what's under there?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Yes, I totally do.
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
He's probably quite handsome.
 


---
 
**Fou:**
Foou?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
You'll have to admit, Lancelot is the ideal image of a knight! He's the most popular Heroic Spirit among the ladies in this world.

 
**Mash:**
Haa...
But how can we get his helmet off?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Plan A: A slip of the hand during battle!
All right, let's give it a try!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Now then, I'm going to start the battle simulation program. Is everybody ready?

 
**Lancelot:**
...

 
**Mash:**
(I feel really bad about tricking him...)
...Got it, Doctor. I'm ready any time.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
The enemy's a simulated Servant used for trainings,
so it's not dangerous. Don't worry.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
(I'm going to set the parameters at the highest, though.)

 
**Mash:**
Let's begin, Master.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
All right! Let's do our best!
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Am I supposed to slip and pull his helmet off?
 


---
 
**Mash:**
Senpai!
Shhh! Shhh!

 
**Lancelot:**
![berserk2](https://i.imgur.com/7VYgcEB.png)&ndash;!!!


**--BATTLE--:**

**Lancelot:**
![berserk2](https://i.imgur.com/7VYgcEB.png)&ndash;!!

 
**Mash:**
Th-That was excellent... (It's no good.
He doesn't leave any openings during or after battle!)

 
**Dr. Roman:**
(He truly is the Knight of the Lake!)
Is he really under Madness Enhancement?

 
**Mash:**
That must be his famous "Eternal Arms Mastery."

 
**Mash:**
Even under Madness Enhancement, his combat skills will never deteriorate.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
We're not through yet! Don't give up, Mash!
The next Shadow Servant will be incredible!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
(Hahaha, I'm gonna rig the settings.)
(Even the Knight of the Lake won't be able to...)

 
**Dr. Roman:**
...Oops.

 
**Mash:**
Um...
Doctor, what is this?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Sorry, I messed up. I might've summoned an extremely powerful mock Servant.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Oopsie Daisy?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I saw this coming.
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Oopsie daisy my butt!
 


---
 
**Fou:**
Foou!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Oh, just FYI.
This Shadow Servant might cost you your lives...

 
**Mash:**
Doctor?!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
D-Do your best!

 
**Mash:**
I'll make you pay for this later, got it?
Anyway, let's take care of this Lancelot!

 
**Lancelot:**
![berserk2](https://i.imgur.com/7VYgcEB.png)&ndash;!!


**--BATTLE--:**

**Mash:**
W-We won...just barely.

 
**Lancelot:**
...

 
**Dr. Roman:**
He made that fight look like a walk in the park...
The Knight of the Lake... What a guy...

 
**Fou:**
Foou...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
So, remind me why we're doing this.
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I just want to go back to my room...
 


---
 
**Mash:**
Sheesh, it's all because the Doctor wanted to see Lancelot's face, that's why we... Oops.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Mash?

 
**Lancelot:**
...

 
**Mash:**
I-I'm sorry...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Sorry, but we're really curious...
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Come on and just show us!
 


---
 
**Lancelot:**
...!!! (Kachank)

 
**Mash:**
...What?
You're going to show us?

 
**Fou:**
Fou!?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Whaaaaaat?
All my effort was for nothing...

 
**Dr. Roman:**
But, finally, we can see the Knight of the Lake's true face!

 
**Mash:**
...!!! (Gulp)

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Whooooah! ...What the?

 
**Mash:**
I don't know what to say...

 
**Dr. Roman:**
For some reason, even with his helmet off, it's a blur and I can't make out his features at all.

 
**Lancelot:**
...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Could this be?
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Show us your face!
 


---
 
**Dr. Roman:**
I get it. I think this is the effect of
"For Someone's Glory."

 
**Mash:**
The skill that conceals his status and appearance, isn't it?

 
**Mash:**
But still, even this close with his helmet off, I still can't see a thing...

 
**Dr. Roman:**
All this has made me...so tired.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
What a disappointment!
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Let's go back and eat...
 


---
 
**Mash:**
Y-Yeah, let's...

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Well, talk about a waste of time.
I think that's the right phrase for today.

 
**Mash:**
Don't talk like that, Doctor!
Lancelot, please don't be offended.

 
**Lancelot:**
...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Show us your true face sometime, all right?
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Someday we'll be able to see your real face, right?
 


---
 
**Mash:**
Haha... Yes, that's right.
I have a feeling it will happen.

 
**Fou:**
Fou!!
