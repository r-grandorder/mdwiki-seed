# Hans Christian Andersen

## Human Observation

**Andersen:**
How are you, Master? It's good to see that you're not looking disgruntled today.

 
**Andersen:**
I am so disgusted with my super-boring life that my brain has turned to stone.

 
**Andersen:**
I feel like as if I've been transformed into a dumb monkey. I'm overwhelmingly lacking enrichment in my life.

 
**Andersen:**
Look. Don't you have anything to say as my Master?

**Fujimaru 1:**
Stone bread?
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Enrichment?
 


---
 
**Andersen:**
Huh? You don't know the taste of a completely-dried bread? Scandinavians start their breakfast 
 
**Andersen:**
by forcefully washing down a piece of rock-like bread with a drink like lead-boiled water...

 
**Andersen:**
Well, that trivia aside,
what I want to say, Fujimaru, is...

 
**Andersen:**
Give me something new to write about, or if you don't have anything, then give me some money.
I'll have some fun at the bar to kill some time.

 
**Mash:**
...Senpai, Mr. Andersen is sounding more arrogant and reprehensible than ever.

 
**Mash:**
Did you do anything to get on his bad side?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I didn't do anything.
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Andersen is always like this.
 


---
 
**Mash:**
So you say you're not at fault.
Of course. That's what I remember, too.

 
**Mash:**
Mr. Andersen.
We don't have any resources to waste here at Chaldea.

 
**Mash:**
Please behave yourself, and work on a new book.
Personally, I request a sequel of The Little Mermaid...

 
**Andersen:**
Tch.
That story is so popular among women and kids.

 
**Andersen:**
I wrote that story to mock the idiots in this world,
so I don't understand why it would be taken as a touching tale.

 
**Mash:**
What&mdash;M-Mister, what did you just say?

 
**Andersen:**
I said, that is one of the worst trash that I ever wrote, you fool!

 
**Andersen:**
Geez. I made the ending so obvious,
but people kept calling it a tragedy or tragic love story.

 
**Andersen:**
Not only is she finally released from love at first sight,
but she even gets a soul as a reward in the end!

 
**Andersen:**
Listen. The best part about love is when it's purely yours. That's my conclusion, at least.

 
**Andersen:**
You ask me to write a sequel, but why can't you understand it would only drive Little Mermaid to further despair?

 
**Mash:**
&mdash;

 
**Andersen:**
Uh... What, you look like it's the end of the world.
...

 
**Andersen:**
I'm saying, don't ask me to write a sequel to a story that ended already. It's the reader's privilege to imagine what happens after the ending.

 
**Mash:**
...

 
**Andersen:**
...Fine. If you don't have any money,
some new inspiration will do.

 
**Andersen:**
Take me wherever you can, Fujimaru.
France would be nice for now.

 
**Andersen:**
What are you doing, Mash? You're coming, too.
We'll end up dying if it's just me and Fujimaru.

 
**Mash:**
R-Right...

 
**Mash:**
...Whew.
Is this place alright with you, Mr. Andersen?

 
**Andersen:**
Yes. Anywhere is okay as long as I can stay away from my desk. Let's enjoy the city of France first...

 
**Mash:**
Master, hostiles approaching! Looks like ghosts from the Hundred Years' War manifested using the Grail's power.

 
**Andersen:**
Hmm. Soldiers from the past are reappearing?
Interesting, why don't you play with them, Fujimaru?

 
**Andersen:**
I'm against physical labor but I will bear with it to get something to write about.
Make this battle a good one, yeah?


**--BATTLE--:**

**Andersen:**
Not bad. I never thought of this.
But perhaps it was too late.

 
**Mash:**
Mr. Andersen?

 
**Andersen:**
Fujimaru, Mash.
Let's move on to the next location.

 
**Andersen:**
You went on quite a rampage in Rome, correct?
Then let's head to the Italian Peninsula, where my heart belongs!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I didn't do it by choice...
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I thought you said you hate physical labor...
 


---
 
**Andersen:**
Skip the commentary, and you call yourself my editor?
Let's go check the next observation object already!

 
**Mash:**
Apparently, we've pushed his buttons as a writer.
Let's just accept it and keep him company.

 
**Andersen:**
I found you!
How do you do? Take that!

 
**Soldier:**
Ugh!

 
**Soldier:**
What's wrong with you people! Especially that kid there! His face has "bad guy" written all over it!

 
**Andersen:**
Wow, so aggressive! As expected of Roman Soldiers, their brains are always on vacation.

 
**Mash:**
Mister, with all due respect. Anybody would get mad if a stranger suddenly threw a mud ball at their face.

 
**Andersen:**
What? All I did was add fuel to the fire!
Fujimaru, make sure you keep them alive this time, too!


**--BATTLE--:**

**Andersen:**
&mdash;Well.
Now that we've finally ventured out into the ocean.

 
**Pirate:**
Ohhhh, our prey is coming to us!
Guys, this is a non-stop party!

 
**Pirate:**
Should we strip them? Or strangle them? Ridicule them?
Whatever. Let's just kill them and let off some steam!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Are we surrounded?
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
We're already in huge trouble?
 


---
 
**Mash:**
Yes, this is what happens when Andersen fixes the coordinates right on a pirate ship!

 
**Andersen:**
Hahaha. Sorry, I underestimated the pirates' IQs.
I had no idea how dumb they actually are.

 
**Andersen:**
They aren't worth observing. I'm going home.
You guys go ahead and beat them up for me.

 
**Andersen:**
They may be a memory of the sea, but they're still humans. Beat them to a pulp, and make them regret their actions.

 
**Mash:**
You don't have to tell us! We'll do that!
And you should reflect on your deeds for once, too!

 
**Andersen:**
Gotcha. Oh, Mash, about the sequel to The Little Mermaid, can I base the Prince on those pirates?

 
**Mash:**
Absolutely not!


**--BATTLE--:**

**Andersen:**
Now I'm satisfied. Good work, Fujimaru.
I had an experience like no other thanks to you.

 
**Mash:**
...We're finally back.
We had a rough time, huh, Master?

 
**Mash:**
Aimlessly fighting through all those eras...

 
**Mash:**
It was good combat experience for us,
but why did you do it, Mr. Andersen?

 
**Andersen:**
To observe people, of course. The weapons people of those eras used, how they fought.

 
**Andersen:**
Even primitive combat reflects human thought.
The differences of all those eras will make a great reference.

 
**Mash:**
Observe people... Then, you must love mankind. Right, Mr. Andersen?

 
**Andersen:**
Huh? Don't be stupid!
I've no interest in mankind. I just needed data.

 
**Andersen:**
Not only the soldiers, I learned something about you two as well. Maybe I will write it into a book someday.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Thank you for that.
 
**Mash:**
...Being written about by one of the three greatest fairy tale authors, I'm embarrassed just saying it.

 
**Mash:**
But I think it would be a great honor.
Dr. Roman would get so jealous.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I'll pass.
 
**Mash:**
Huh...

 
**Mash:**
Yeah, you're right.
Count me out, too.

 
**Mash:**
...You're a more thoughtful person than I imagined, Senpai...

 


---
 
**Andersen:**
You two get along so well.
You're so easygoing.

 
**Andersen:**
I made a contract with you as a Servant because I had no choice, but now I've changed my mind.

 
**Andersen:**
It's hard to find partners for this crazy fieldwork, you know.

 
**Andersen:**
I think I'll get a little more fired up from now on.
A little. Very little. A tiny bit.

 
**Mash:**
I'm glad I was able to help you write, Mr. Andersen.

 
**Andersen:**
...Don't you understand that's a separate matter?
This is why I hate my readers...
