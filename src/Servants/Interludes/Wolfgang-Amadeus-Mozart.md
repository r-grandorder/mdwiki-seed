# Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart

## Symphony of the Heroic Spirits

**Townsperson:**
Get out if you can't pay!
I'm keeping this until you've got the money you owe!

 
**Amadeus:**
Oww...What a violent man... The drink was cheap...
And there were no pork cutlets either...

 
**Amadeus:**
Oh, but losing my travel bag was a bad blow.
I don't want him selling it to the pawn shop.

 
**Mash:**
...Master, that's Amadeus lying on the ground in front of us.

 
**Mash:**
He appears to have been bounced out of the tavern like a pinball.

**Fujimaru 1:**
What happened?
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
You okay, scum?
 


---
 
**Amadeus:**
Oh dear. You've caught me at an embarrassing moment.
Fujimaru, Mash, are you two getting lunch as well?

 
**Amadeus:**
I would advice against that tavern.
The meat and fish are excellent, but the drink is awful.

 
**Amadeus:**
And the customer service is abysmal! What kind of establishment throws you out just because you can't pay?

 
**Mash:**
Amadeus, did you go in there without any money?

 
**Amadeus:**
Of course I did.
I'm a genius composer.

 
**Amadeus:**
God loves me and says I get an unlimited tab for everything.

 
**Amadeus:**
But the owner here knows nothing about music!
He doesn't even have a single piano in his tavern!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Taverns in this era don't have pianos, obviously.
From his perspective, you're the crazy one.

 
**Amadeus:**
How am I crazy? I played him a song on my flute.
It wasn't a full concert, but it should more than suffice.

 
**Mash:**
T-That sounds wonderful. I think a song from Amadeus would be worth a full day's meals, not just one.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
I see. And what kind of song did you play for him, Amadeus?

 
**Amadeus:**
Well, it's untitled, but if I gave it a name, perhaps,
"A fugue to inspire sudden bowel movements."

 
**Amadeus:**
As you can tell from my Noble Phantasm, it worked perfectly. It was hilarious seeing the line to the bathroom.

 
**Mash:**
Senpai, he's bad news! He's the kind of Servant you can't let wander around on his own!

 
**Amadeus:**
Hahaha! You're making me blush!
Still, excellent timing.

 
**Amadeus:**
I've had my revenge on the owner, but he took my bag of instruments. I need to make money quickly.

 
**Amadeus:**
Will you come with me for a while?
I just need a simple bodyguard.

 
**Mash:**
...We're all the way outside town.
What are we doing here, Amadeus?

 
**Amadeus:**
Oh, there are bandits in this area that attack merchant wagons. If I get rid of them, I'll be paid in gold.

 
**Amadeus:**
Look, here they come.
I'm counting on you, Master. Teach them a lesson!


**--BATTLE--:**

**Bandit:**
What's going on? They're as strong as raging bulls!
We can't beat'em by ourselves! Bring it over here!

 
**Mash:**
R-Raging bulls is rather rude, isn't it Master?

 
**Amadeus:**
Well, anyone would think that seeing the way you swing that shield. Then add in the size of your chest&mdash;

 
**Mash:**
Monsieur Amadeus, one more word and your category might switch from ally to enemy.

 
**Amadeus:**
Oh my. How scary. I'd love to tease you more, but we're in the middle of combat.

 
**Amadeus:**
Fujimaru, the bandits haven't given up yet.
The big one's coming&mdash;

 
**Bandit:**
Okay, take off the leash! Go, Patricia!
There's your targets! Go ahead and eat them!

 
**Wyvern:**
GRAAAAAWR!

 
**Mash:**
A-A stray wyvern...!
They must have a decent breeder with them!

 
**Amadeus:**
Yes, I'm surprised, too. And disgusted.
Talk about a waste of talent!

 
**Amadeus:**
If they've got the talent to train a wyvern, why are those idiots wasting their lives on this?


**--BATTLE--:**

**Amadeus:**
Well, wasn't that a nice haul? We got paid three times what I expected, Fujimaru, Mash!

 
**Mash:**
Yes.
I didn't expect to capture 23 people.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
They were tough enough to have a wyvern with them.
Each one's worth a pretty penny, and all together they're worth even more.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Now you can live the high life.
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Now you can pay off your debt.
 


---
 
**Amadeus:**
That's right. I can pay my tab at that tavern, then at the others...And then I guess that's all of it.

 
**Mash:**
You owe money at other taverns too!?

 
**Amadeus:**
Yes. Most just wouldn't let me in.
Otherwise, why would I go to a new place?

 
**Mash:**
I don't know...Amadeus's skills and appearance are so impressive, but he's got too many personality problems.

 
**Mash:**
Next time we summon him, please summon him at an age where he's more dignified.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You mean when he's older?
 
**Mash:**
Yes. An old Amadeus should be a lot more calm.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
You mean when he's younger?
 
**Mash:**
Yes. He'll be less powerful in battle, but a child of 12 won't be going to pubs.

 


---
 
**Dr. Roman:**
No, that's impossible Fujimaru.
A Servant is summoned at the height of their powers.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
It's at the time of their lives when that Heroic Spirit was strongest. Otherwise there'd be no point.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
As long as he's a Servant, Amadeus will carry this form.
Well, his age might change if he's in a different class...

 
**Amadeus:**
I'm never anything but a Caster.
So you won't see me old, or young.

 
**Amadeus:**
And I'll tell you something else, Mash.
There are only two kinds of artist Servants.

 
**Mash:**
Two kinds?
Um...What do you mean?

 
**Amadeus:**
I mean their age when they're summoned.
Whether they appear as children or adults.

 
**Amadeus:**
I can promise you that artist Servants will all either be children or young adults. Nothing else.

 
**Amadeus:**
Servants are summoned at the height of their powers,
right? That means when they were a genius.

 
**Amadeus:**
The ones who appear as children grew up to be decent, dignified adults.

 
**Amadeus:**
That's why they manifest as "children," when they were called geniuses. Child prodigies who didn't care about the problems they caused.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Oh, I see. An artist's talent comes from their instincts.
And they're summoned when those instincts were strongest?

 
**Mash:**
In other words, they're summoned as children, when they were pure geniuses. And the young adults?

 
**Amadeus:**
Those ones are weirdos and scums, who would never change until the day they die!

 
**Mash:**
...

 
**Dr. Roman:**
...It sounds so convincing when he says it...
And what an awful Servant he is...

 
**Amadeus:**
Oh, it's dinner time!
My tab's paid off, so it's off to my favorite pub.

 
**Amadeus:**
Oh, but I do need to thank you.
Here, Fujimaru. A present from me.

 
**Amadeus:**
This is also my thanks for everything you do for me.
Buh-bye, then! You guys have a nice dinner too!

 
**Mash:**
He's gone... Some Servants have no interest in the era they're summoned to,

 
**Mash:**
And some Servants, like Amadeus, act like they belong there...

 
**Mash:**
There really are all different types of Heroic Spirits...
