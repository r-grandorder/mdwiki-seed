# Hassan of the Serenity

## That's Why I'm Going to Die Here, as Myself

**Serenity:**
Welcome back, Master.

 
**Serenity:**
Good job on your assignment on the minute Singularity.
I'm glad to see you have returned safely.

 
**Serenity:**
I'm sorry that I'm the one greeting you today.
Mash was on standby until the very last minute...

 
**Serenity:**
But then a staff member came by and wanted to speak with her about Sheba.

 
**Serenity:**
And so I have come to greet you instead.
I'm sorry if I have disappointed you.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Thanks for your greeting, Hassan.
 
**Serenity:**
Yes. Welcome back.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I'm not disappointed.
 
**Serenity:**
Thank you...

 


---
 
**Serenity:**
Will you be returning to My Room?
Oh, but if you would like to eat...

 
**Serenity:**
I've already notified the kitchen.
Mr. Emiya, Miss Cat, Miss Boudica, and Miss Raikou...

 
**Serenity:**
...are all surely anticipating your arrival.
What would you like to do?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Yeah, I am a little hungry.
 
**Serenity:**
Understood. Strength that's been depleted must be restored.

 
**Serenity:**
Then this way, please.
I shall accompany you to the cafeteria.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Maybe head to the cafeteria after I rest a bit.
 


---
 
**Serenity:**
Ah. You must be exhausted.
I will notify the kitchen that you will arrive later.

 
**Serenity:**
Then I will accompany you to My Room.

 
**Serenity:**
...Um, I mean...I didn't mean to make it sound like that...

 
**Serenity:**
I've recently come to reflect on my past actions... The fact that I would sneak into your bed without permission is, well...

 
**Serenity:**
Miss Raikou told me that such a thing is...indecent.
She was wearing a swimsuit when she told me...

 
**Serenity:**
Of course, I always knew that to be the case in the back of my mind, and I always meant to behave appropriately, as I was raised...

 
**Serenity:**
But I could not help myself, and that's why I... multiple times... Oh, yes...multiple times...

 
**Serenity:**
I bothered you so many times...
I will be careful from now on.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You don't have to be so formal about it...

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
All things in moderation. Moderation.


---
 
**Serenity:**
...But if you say that, I might...

 
**Serenity:**
No... No! Decency is important! We wouldn't want people sneaking into others' beds without permission!

 
**Serenity:**
Moderation!
I will cultivate self-restraint!

 
**Serenity:**
Master.

 
**Serenity:**
Chaldea is a strange place. I may not be in any position to say so because I've not traveled the world to learn much about various places...

 
**Serenity:**
But that's how I feel... Many heroes from different times and parts of the world exist here together...

 
**Serenity:**
Heroes of the past.
Heroic Spirits. Servants.

 
**Serenity:**
Dead beings, whose purpose isn't to live correctly in the present age...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Um, well...

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Aren't they...incarnated temporarily?
 


---
 
**Serenity:**
No.

 
**Serenity:**
Oh, I mean... Well, I'm not sure how to say this...
I suppose that is one way to describe things.

 
**Serenity:**
We retain our form using our Spirit Origins to stay in Chaldea, and we live like humans.

 
**Serenity:**
I do not know the details of its system, but this is all thanks to the immense amount of magical energy that is supplied by Chaldea.

 
**Serenity:**
Perhaps a mage, even a Caster-class Servant...

 
**Serenity:**
...would be able to better put into words what I am trying to describe...

 
**Serenity:**
But I can say this much: this body of mine is made possible through the power of ether.

 
**Serenity:**
Blood courses through me, and I have a heart and brain. But at the same time, I have a Spirit Core.

 
**Serenity:**
So unlike you, I am not a being with a proper body.

 
**Serenity:**
A true incarnation...in other words, to gain existence as a complete living being would likely require the power of a wish-granting vessel like a Holy Grail.

 
**Serenity:**
But...

 
**Serenity:**
If I...could possibly...

 
**Serenity:**
!!!

 
**Arash:**
Oops.

 
**Arash:**
Not looking where you were going, huh?
Walking distracted isn't a good idea, Miss Serenity.

 
**Arash:**
Yo, Master. You're safe.
How did that last Rayshift go for you?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I'm back, Arash.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Back home safe and sound!
 


---
 
**Arash:**
Haha. Glad to hear it. You've got a nice color to your face too. Oh and you as well, Miss Serenity.

 
**Serenity:**
...

 
**Arash:**
Heh.

 
**Serenity:**
...B-but, it can't be!

 
**Arash:**
Hm?

 
**Serenity:**
My apologies, Archer Arash.
I will take my leave now, Master.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Huh? Hassan?

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
What's wrong?
 


---
 
**Serenity:**
I'm sorry.
I...um...I...

 
**Serenity:**
...I'm terribly...sorry.
Now's not...no...no...

 
**Serenity:**
I cannot...no matter what...

 
**Arash:**
Huh. She went as far as dissipating into thin air.
I didn't mean to cause her so much distress.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I wonder what happened...
 
**Arash:**
Oh, yeah.
Well...you know...

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Do you have any idea, Arash?
 
**Arash:**
Sorry. It's probably best if I don't say anything.
I think she should tell you personally.

 


---
 
**Arash:**
It's quite the pickle.
All you can really do is to brace for it.

 
**Arash:**
To us Servants, the Master is our foundation.
No matter how much magical energy Chaldea supplies...

 
**Arash:**
And no matter what anchors us for manifestation...a Servant's existence rests on the Master.

 
**Arash:**
Well, we're not really humans, but that's another story. There's no use lecturing you on that.

 
**Arash:**
...Just act naturally.
I beg you.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I don't really get it, but...

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I'll just try not to get flustered.
 


---
 
**Arash:**
That's the spirit.
That's our Master!


**--SECTION BREAK--:**
 
**Narration:**
...In regards to the strange behavior of the Assassin, Hassan of the Serenity.

 
**Narration:**
Our first witness is Archer, Arash.

 
**Narration:**
It appears the two of them ran into each other in the hallway.

 
**Narration:**
Note that she was unable to properly respond to the sudden encounter, as she was focused only on Master.

 
**Narration:**
...and as a result, she made skin-to-skin contact with Arash.

 
**Narration:**
As you all know, the poisonous toxins that course through her body reach a wide range. They can even penetrate special garments made from magical energy.

 
**Narration:**
While not always fatal, a Servant touching her body will be affected by her poison.

 
**Narration:**
Paralysis and dizziness are common effects.

 
**Narration:**
Arash Kamangir, however, is highly resistant to poison.
So, he seems to be fine even after this contact.

 
**Narration:**
But it was around that time when Hassan of the Serenity began to exhibit other strange behavior.

 
**Narration:**
Second witness: Mash Kyrielight.
Third witness: Chaldea Staff J. Doe (name withheld).

 
**Narration:**
There are multiple witness reports of the subject standing in front of Master's My Room, doing nothing but bowing her head.

 
**Narration:**
And not just once or twice. Over the past few days, there have been at least five witnesses who have all given similar reports.

 
**Narration:**
She is clearly disturbed, which must be what is driving her behavior. She is obviously in psychological pain.

 
**Narration:**
...The reason is clear.

 
**Narration:**
She has finally come to realize that there are individuals other than Master to whom her touch is not fatal.

 
**Narration:**
It was just a matter of time.

 
**Narration:**
After contact with Arash, it appears she is trying to remain calm...at least around Master.

 
**Narration:**
But swift action must be taken, or there is a possibility that this could affect her and our activities in our Rayshifting missions.

 
**Narration:**
  《This concludes the report by Paracelsus.》


**--SECTION BREAK--:**

**Serenity:**
...

 
**Serenity:**
I sense multiple entities with hostile intent.
It appears we are surrounded, Master.

 
**Serenity:**
...Whether we choose to break through or flee,
it appears a fight is inevitable.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
It's okay, just stay calm.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Let's just do things as usual.
 


---
 
**Serenity:**
Yes. I await your orders.

 
**Serenity:**
...This may only be the simulator, but I will behave as if it were a matter of life and death. Whatever my Master commands...I will do!


**--BATTLE--:**

**Serenity:**
...

 
**Serenity:**
...I'm sorry, Master.

 
**Serenity:**
You went out of your way to invite me to join you in the simulator, yet...I was of no help.

 
**Serenity:**
I didn't expect so many enemies. If I only managed to break through even the slightest...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Well, it seemed like a successive battle program.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
It's not your fault, Hassan.
 


---
 
**Serenity:**
...

 
**Serenity:**
Thank you, Master.
You are always so kind... Our Master...

 
**Serenity:**
But I...I'm really...

 
**Serenity:**
Even though I am one of your Servants...though this should never happen...I just...

 
**Serenity:**
I cannot act...the way I should...

 
**Mash:**
Welcome back, Senpai!
Serenity!

 
**Serenity:**
...I'm sorry.
Please take care of Master.

 
**Mash:**
Oh, Serenity...?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
She didn't even say “I'm back”...

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
She just left...
 


---
 
**Mash:**
Yes...


**--SECTION BREAK--:**

**Paracelsus:**
Good work in the simulator, Hassan of the Serenity.

 
**Paracelsus:**
I figured whatever was bothering you would have gone away once you accompanied Master into battle.

 
**Paracelsus:**
Yet you immediately ran back to your own room...
This is very serious.

 
**Serenity:**
...

 
**Serenity:**
...I thought I locked my door.

 
**Paracelsus:**
You forget that I am a mage.

 
**Paracelsus:**
...And a physician as well.

 
**Serenity:**
Servants have no need for physicians.
I ask that you leave.

 
**Paracelsus:**
...First, a little parable for you.

 
**Serenity:**
I don't...

 
**Paracelsus:**
It's also a sort of fairy tale.
Once upon a time, there was a poisonous girl.

 
**Serenity:**
...

 
**Paracelsus:**
The poisonous girl killed many people. As the name suggests, the girl's veins ran black with poison.

 
**Paracelsus:**
The girl was searching...for someone who would not die from her touch, who would smile back at her.

 
**Paracelsus:**
For someone whom she could lean against...just like she'd seen so many people doing.

 
**Paracelsus:**
The girl was searching...for love.

 
**Paracelsus:**
The first one, a man, ended in failure. He died. He spoke sweet nothings to her, but then died as soon as the two kissed.

 
**Paracelsus:**
But then...the second one...was a young girl.

 
**Paracelsus:**
One so very powerful that she managed to touch the poisonous girl's skin as if it were nothing...

 
**Paracelsus:**
...and then smile.

 
**Serenity:**
...Is that...story true?

 
**Paracelsus:**
Like I said, it's a parable.
Though, of course, there are elements of truth.

 
**Paracelsus:**
So the poisonous girl thought to herself, “Ah, this maiden is the one. The one I've desired, the one I've been searching for all this time.”

 
**Paracelsus:**
She was thrilled.
She worked herself into a fervor.

 
**Paracelsus:**
The poisonous girl accepted the powerful girl as her master, and entered her service. She killed many, and collected many souls...

 
**Serenity:**
...A soul eater?

 
**Paracelsus:**
Who knows? That may have been the case.
Either way, the poisonous girl killed and killed and killed.

 
**Paracelsus:**
And then she met a young man.

 
**Paracelsus:**
He was a kind young man. He possessed a noble soul, and he was even concerned with the poisonous girl's safety when she showed herself in battle.

 
**Paracelsus:**
Even though...he was destined to die by the girl's hands.

 
**Paracelsus:**
The girl killed the young man...kissing him with her poisoned lips.

 
**Paracelsus:**
She did so without mercy, even though she felt only kindness from him.

 
**Paracelsus:**
And so, the girl continued to work under her powerful master, killing more and more.

 
**Paracelsus:**
Then one day, the poisonous girl received a gift from a man.

 
**Paracelsus:**
It was the kind man, animated as one of the living dead by some kind of magecraft.

 
**Serenity:**
...A gift...

 
**Paracelsus:**
The man said to her, “O poisonous girl. You don't care who the person is, as long as they don't die, right?”

 
**Paracelsus:**
“You only serve your master because your touch does not kill her, not because you love her.”

 
**Paracelsus:**
“Then this living corpse should satisfy you.”

 
**Serenity:**
...

 
**Serenity:**
...And what did she say?

 
**Paracelsus:**
Who knows?

 
**Serenity:**
Which did the girl love...?
The girl, or the young man's corpse?

 
**Paracelsus:**
I cannot say. The story's ending is the poisonous girl's alone. It is not for you to know.

 
**Paracelsus:**
At the very least, the girl went into a long slumber, carrying the story's conclusion with her. And she was never to wake up again. Ever.

 
**Serenity:**
...Caster Paracelsus.

 
**Paracelsus:**
Yes?

 
**Serenity:**
What you are trying to tell me is that my hesitation...this turmoil within me...is...

 
**Serenity:**
...not...love...

 
**Paracelsus:**
I cannot say.
I wonder, do you even know what love is?

 
**Serenity:**
I...

 
**Paracelsus:**
Hassan of the Serenity.

 
**Paracelsus:**
Sometimes, getting lost and hesitating is a good thing. That makes it a story all your own.

 
**Paracelsus:**
You stand before us as a Spirit Origin.
Your manifestation in Chaldea is all your own.

 
**Paracelsus:**
Memories and thoughts do not linger. Just like with humans. If a Heroic Spirit dies, its Spirit Origin simply ends there.

 
**Paracelsus:**
That's why, Hassan-i Sabbah...should you chose to cling to the reservations that plague your heart...

 
**Paracelsus:**
...and continue along your journey with that sentiment...

 
**Paracelsus:**
I will not stop you.
Nor will I tell you that you are wrong.

 
**Serenity:**
...!!!

 
**Serenity:**
...Then... I... I...

 
**Serenity:**
Paracelsus, oh, Paracelsus.
There's just one thing I must tell Master&ndash;

 
**Paracelsus:**
Then go on.
I will not stop you.

 
**Serenity:**
Thank you, Caster Paracelsus.

 
**Paracelsus:**
I wish you luck.

 
**Arash:**
I didn't mean to eavesdrop.

 
**Arash:**
But I couldn't help but watch.
You chose your words...very carefully...

 
**Arash:**
Memories don't remain, huh?

 
**Paracelsus:**
I did not wish to lie, so I was, as you say,
very careful in my choice of words.

 
**Paracelsus:**
Hassan of the Serenity. Her Spirit Origin is somewhat different than ours. Even if SHE were to be summoned once again...

 
**Paracelsus:**
Those records would never be carried over from the Throne.

 
**Paracelsus:**
Only when she gains love, that is.

 
**Paracelsus:**
The Hassan of the Serenity who fell in love will never be summoned again. That Hassan shall sleep for eternity, and carry those emotions with her.

 
**Paracelsus:**
Even if she were summoned using the Holy Grail or through a special magecraft ritual, the checks and balances system should make it so that a different her with a different Spirit Origin would manifest.

 
**Arash:**
...Yeah, the one we have now is a great example.

 
**Paracelsus:**
Yes. She's a completely different person. Different than the girl we know from that distant Holy Grail War in a faraway past.

 
**Arash:**
Even we're different. Circumstances and their outcomes may differ slightly, but I understand that is the way it is for all Servants.

 
**Paracelsus:**
Indeed. Just a SLIGHT difference. Heh. And...that should ring true the next time we are summoned as well.

 
**Paracelsus:**
If it wasn't for the Singularity or the exception that is the Chaldea summoning ritual, fragments of our memories carrying over should not be possible, either.

 
**Arash:**
What a pain in the ass.

 
**Paracelsus:**
Yes. For you and me, both.


**--SECTION BREAK--:**
 
**Serenity:**
Master!

 
**Serenity:**
...U-um...I...I...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You've come back.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
It's okay. Take your time.
 


---
 
**Serenity:**
Y-yes...

 
**Serenity:**
...Breathe in...breathe out...
Calm down...focus...I...

 
**Serenity:**
I can do this. I've decided that I'll talk.
Inhale...exhale...

 
**Serenity:**
Master. First of all, I apologize for my mishap in battle earlier.

 
**Serenity:**
I am fine now. I decided I will be fine from now on.
Um...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Okay.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Tell me, Hassan-i Sabbah.
 


---
 
**Serenity:**
I will tell you the truth. I have learned that there are others who my touch does not kill. I mean, apart from you, Master.

 
**Serenity:**
And so...

 
**Serenity:**
I was hesitant. I wavered.

 
**Serenity:**
I thought I was determined...that I wouldn't mind even if the First One's evening bell tolled for me...

 
**Serenity:**
But then I became confused...
I panicked, I wandered, and my mind was all a mess...

 
**Serenity:**
Someone who doesn't die from touching me.
Someone who doesn't die from embracing me...

 
**Serenity:**
The role was so easily filled...the hero Arash was absolutely unfazed even after I touched him!

 
**Serenity:**
I heard he was strong against toxins, according to his lore and characteristics. But...I never thought that was actually true...

 
**Serenity:**
The moment I witnessed it for myself...I...I...
It felt like my chest was about to burst...

 
**Serenity:**
And then I couldn't look at you in the eye...

 
**Serenity:**
...I...I...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
(Nods)
 


---
 
**Serenity:**
No...no, you do not understand, Master.

 
**Serenity:**
It was true that I hesitated. I'm still confused.
But...but I want to think that it's fine...

 
**Serenity:**
I was the one who decided to be with you.
That feeling will never change.

 
**Serenity:**
After hearing Paracelsus's story, I began to realize...that if this Spirit Origin that is me...does not stay forever...

 
**Serenity:**
I will no longer avoid the truth. This Spirit Origin shall begin and end here. There is no me beyond that.

 
**Serenity:**
That's why I'll be fine. I'm fine now.
I won't flee...from anybody.

 
**Serenity:**
...And not even from my own heart.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Okay. Got it.
 
**Serenity:**
Yes.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
What do you mean?
 


---
 
**Serenity:**
I will stay by your side. That is what I have decided. That's why...th-th-this is a confession.

 
**Serenity:**
I am unsure whether this feeling is love or not...

 
**Serenity:**
No! I will try my best! I'm sure I am going to keep agonizing over this, but I'm sure I will eventually come to a conclusion.

 
**Serenity:**
That's why, until that time...

 
**Serenity:**
Please...I would like you, Master, to resist any love or affections from anyone who comes your way...

 
**Serenity:**
And wait...for me...
I would...appreciate that...

 
**Serenity:**
...Would you be able to forgive me for thinking and wishing this?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I, uh...
 


---
 
**Serenity:**
Thank you very much, Master.
I'm going to keep trying my best.

 
**Serenity:**
I will eventually come to a conclusion.
Even before Kiyohime whisks you away.

 
**E：Kiyohime (Ambush):**
Did you call for me, my dear Anchin!?

 
**Serenity:**
Eh...uh...um...seriously?
Presence Concealment?

 
**Kiyohime:**
Oh, no. I just slithered my way over here like usual!
You just didn't hear me because you were so wound up!

 
**Kiyohime:**
By the way...what in the world was that all about!? That sounded like some sort of confession...like a bittersweet and tender-sounding confession!

 
**Kiyohime:**
I-I will not allow such behavior to happen while I'M around! So, I WILL BURN YOU!

 
**Kiyohime:**
Ah! She's dissipating!

 
**Kiyohime:**
Hold it right there! I actually didn't hear a word you said...I only SENSED something was going on...so tell me EVERYTHING!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I'm not sure what happened...

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
This...this can only end badly...
 


---
 
**Fou:**
Fou fooou!
