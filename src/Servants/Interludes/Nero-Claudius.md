# Nero Claudius

## First Sailing, Once Again

**Nero:**
Well then, this is Nero Claudius, now a Heroic Spirit.

 
**Nero:**
Umu! It's only natural that a genius like myself would become a Heroic Spirit.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
...So much for our parting in Rome. I see your perfect confidence remains unchanged, Emperor...

 
**Mash:**
Yes. But I'm happy about this reunion.
I look forward to working with you Nero.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I'm looking forward to it as well.

 
**Nero:**
Umu! But now I'm your Servant, not your Emperor.
From now on call me "Red Saber!"

 
---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Even as a Heroic Spirit, you're still short.

 
**Nero:**
F-Fool! I am not "short!" This is my perfect form!
I have no problem with my height.

 
**Nero:**
...N-No problem at all!
I don't feel bitter about my height! Not one bit!

 
---

 
**Nero:**
Oops, I guess this wasn't the time to chit chat.

 
**Nero:**
Ahem, Mages of Chaldea who strive to save humanity.

 
**Nero:**
May that battle be an impossible battle in a distant past, I have not forgotten your efforts.

 
**Nero:**
You have my gratitude.
I owe you Fujimaru.

 
**Nero:**
Umu&mdash;And I am going to owe you this time too!
Get the ships out! It's time for me to depart with my Master!

 
**Nero:**
Yes, the weather is clear, and the waves are high.
We'll arrive in no time!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
&mdash;Hmm?
 
---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Huh?

---
 


 
**Nero:**
What're you gaping at?
We've come this far, just grant my wish already!

 
**Nero:**
Look at Mash, she blends in perfectly. There she is,
brooding on the deck. Hmm, why are her eyes so lifeless?

 
**Mash:**
Senpai... I see that Nero... I mean, Red Saber,
is even pushier...than...before...

 
**Mash:**
You put us all on a boat before we have any idea what's going on...and come...all this way...Ugh.

 
**Fou:**
Fou, Fou!

 
**Mash:**
Oh...Motion sickness medicine. Thank you, Fou...
Red Saber's steering is horrifyin...Ugh.

 
**Nero:**
There it is!
Our destination, the island of buried mysteries!

 
**Nero:**
They call it the "Bermuda Triangle" or something?

 
**Nero:**
They use that name to refer to these waters, but don't worry about it. On board Fujimaru, Mash!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Why?

 
---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Give us a reason!

---
 


 
**Nero:**
It's an "island of buried mysteries." Obviously,&mdash;
it's treasure-hunting time!

 
**Golem:**
<span style="font-size:25px">GoAAAAAAAAAAAAAA&mdash;!</span>

 
**Pirate:**
Take that!

 
**Nero:**
Thank you for your warm welcome!

 
**Nero:**
But, you're in my way. Come again after you've made yourself five times more beautiful!

 
**Mash:**
Master! I have no clue what she's talking about, but for now, let's fight!


**--BATTLE--:**

**Nero:**
That was a good warm-up. How was I?
My sword skills haven't gotten worse, have they?

 
**Mash:**
They're much improved and will come in handy...

 
**Nero:**
Haha! I know, right? I know, right!
You're an honest girl, Mash! I like you!

 
**Nero:**
Anyway, I'll start the search.
According to my intuition... Umu, we should go this way!

 
**Mash:**
There she goes on her own again...
Let's go after her, Master!

 
**Nero:**
We've got ourselves a werebeast! Hmm,
I'm worried about the smell of gunpowder, but whatever!

 
**Nero:**
Let's go, Fujimaru!
We're going to beat these guys and get the treasure!


**--BATTLE--:**

**Nero:**
Now that the annoyances are out of our way.
Mash, go ahead and open the treasure chest.

 
**Nero:**
I'm sure there's tons of wonderful treasure in there&mdash;

 
**Mash:**
I have unfortunate news, Your Majesty.
Please look inside.

 
**Nero:**
Hey&mdash;There's nothing in here? Is this a...pelican?

 
**Mash:**
...I'm not sure.
It looks like a penguin to me.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Looks like someone beat us here.

 
---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Guess it was too good to be true.

---
 


 
**Nero:**
This sucks!
But it wasn't such a waste of time after all!

 
**Nero:**
If you look closely, there's some stuff left in here.
Whoever came before us must be a careless fool!

 
**Nero:**
Okay, we're going to take this and have a triumphant return! Good work Fujimaru, Mash.

 
**Mash:**
Um... Well, that's fine, but why?

 
**Mash:**
I don't see why an emperor would really need any treasure.

 
**Nero:**
...Umu, with my Golden Rule I wouldn't have to worry about money, but I need more capital right now.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
More capital?

 
---

**Fujimaru 2:**
For what reason?

---
 


 
**Nero:**
That's a secret, of course!
You'll find out eventually, so look forward to it!

 
**Mash:**
...You heard her, Senpai.
It seems that Her Majesty has some sort of grand plan.

 
**Mash:**
Anyway, let's collect some resources that we might be able to use. There's some Saint Quartz!


## A Golden Business

**Nero:**
The time is now. I shall start the grand enterprise that I've been planning for a long time.

 
**Nero:**
However, to make something perfect,
you need unparalleled talent and resolve.

 
**Nero:**
Don't you think so, Fujimaru?
You should understand my suffering.

 
**Mash:**
(Senpai. I think Red Saber is trying to talk to you.)

 
**Dr. Roman:**
(These questions can be a headache.
Let's just give her a random answer.)

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
O-Of course I understand.

 
---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I don't get it at all.

---
 


 
**Nero:**
Umu! I knew you'd get it right away.
Thanks to you, I've made up my mind.

 
**Nero:**
We're going to rebuild the Domus Aurea! My Noble Phantasm and the essence of my artist's soul&mdash;

 
**Nero:**
In any event, we've come to the plains in search of the last required piece. Lend me a hand, Fujimaru.

 
**Nero:**
We need to be careful with money.
Rebuilding the Golden Theater will be costly.

 
**Nero:**
The materials, personnel, and my design fees! This time, let's try to do something about the material costs.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
She's trying to improve her Noble Phantasm with money... Not a lot of Heroic Spirits would do that.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
So that's why you were trying to gather treasure before.
But Your Majesty, can you strengthen your Noble Phantasm like that?

 
**Nero:**
Of course. The Golden Theater I created with my magical energy is based off the original that existed.

 
**Nero:**
It's a matter of the image that's in my mind when I activate my Noble Phantasm. If we renovate the theater, I can sear that image in my mind.

 
**Nero:**
That way, when I use my Noble Phantasm it should be just as extravagant and even more dazzling. That's the plan, anyway.

 
**Mash:**
...I see. So her Noble Phantasm depends on the power of her imagination.

 
**Mash:**
The more grand that Theater becomes,
the more real the image becomes for Red Saber.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I think it's already real enough, but...

 
**Nero:**
Haha, don't compliment me now, Fujimaru.
You're so cute. Compliment me later.

 
---

**Fujimaru 2:**
You're going to wear yourself out.

 
**Nero:**
Dummy! Pushing yourself and pretending is the same thing! What's the point of not trying your best?

 
---

 
**Nero:**
In any event, the final material should appear soon.
Everyone get ready for combat. This is going to be tough?

 
**Mash:**
???
It's going to appear?

 
**Mash:**
Just what are you going to have us make?

 
**Nero:**
Isn't it obvious?
A colosseum of sorts.

 
**Fou:**
Fou?

 
**Nero:**
Umu, a new Golden Theater. A mix between a theater and a colosseum, a completely new way to watch someone fight.

 
**Nero:**
...Well, there won't be any fighting in the Theater.
I'm just going to make the entrance look like the Colosseum.

 
**Nero:**
Do you guys know what Colosseum means?

 
**Mash:**
I think it was...Oh, I remember.
It means "Before the Giant Statue."

 
**Dr. Roman:**
That's right.
It came from the word "colossus."

 
**Dr. Roman:**
There's a giant statue in front of the Colosseum in Rome that watches over the spectators.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
&mdash;Oh, that's right. It was around the time of Emperor Nero when that colosseum&mdash;

 
**Nero:**
That's right! It was a statue of me!
It's 31 meters high. It was a beautiful statue.

 
**Nero:**
Though when the Colosseum was built my Theater was destroyed, but let's not talk about that.

 
**Nero:**
In any event, this time I'm after&mdash;

 
**Mash:**
Master, we've got hostiles!
Oh, no&mdash;There's a bunch of golems closing in!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Nero, this couldn't be your&mdash;

 
**Nero:**
Umu. I used my patrons to drive the golems here to use as material!

 
**Nero:**
Let's do this, Fujimaru!
It's the spring of golem hunting!


**--BATTLE--:**

**Mash:**
We've taken out the enemy golems...
The battle is over...

 
**Fou:**
Kyuu...

 
**Dr. Roman:**
What a primitive way of fighting...
To pummel the gates physically...

 
**Nero:**
U-Umu, this went too far.
I've realized my mistake here...

 
**Nero:**
But with this much material here, let's start building!
I'll show you how mankind first started using concrete!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
In what pose will you build the statue?

 
**Nero:**
Hm...I have to think about that...

 
---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I want to build a statue of Mash, too.


 
**Mash:**
N-No, that's quite okay, Senpai!

 
---

 
**Nero:**
...Sorry. I'll build the statue later.
These golems make for good materials, but...

 
**Nero:**
They just don't have the right appeal.
The voices I hear from the stones are the brawny types.

 
**Nero:**
I can't carve a good statue with this.
I've given up on the Colosseum style this time.

 
**Nero:**
But I will rebuild the Theater.
Don't worry, I won't waste your effort Master.

 
**Nero:**
Now it's time to really get to work! Let's get the materials together and make our triumphant return to Rome!

 
**Nero:**
We're going to make my Theater strong, firm, and as tough as a fortress...

 
**Nero:**
That's right, something Heracles can't even handle.
The strongest Theater yet!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
This emperor hasn't learned anything!


## No Matter How Many Times the End Comes

**Nero:**
Sorry about that Fujimaru.
I have some personal business I need your help with.

 
**Nero:**
...The United Empire is gone, and Rome is in an ephemeral peace.

 
**Nero:**
However, the one who led Rome as its first citizen,
Nero Claudius is no longer there.

 
**Nero:**
Rather, the human "Nero" is no longer there because I contracted with you, Fujimaru.

 
**Nero:**
The human "Nero" already left Rome just like in history.
Now "I" sit as its Emperor.

 
**Mash:**
The Era's ability to bring back the past...
No, to repair itself.

 
**Mash:**
As long as the Servant Nero is here, the Emperor Nero must be dead.

 
**Mash:**
In normal space and time, both the human before death and the Servant after death can exist simultaneously.

 
**Mash:**
But in a Singularity, "what's accurate" and
"what's stronger" ends up taking precedence.

 
**Mash:**
Once the Heroic Spirit Nero contracted with you,
the Nero at Septem became this Nero, unfortunately.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You didn't have to say "unfortunately,"  Mash.


 
**Mash:**
...My apologies.

 
**Mash:**
I wasn't trying to criticize you...
Sorry about that, Emperor Nero.

 
**Nero:**
It's fine. You were just lamenting the fact that I passed away, correct?

 
**Nero:**
If that's the case, I forgive you. Actually, I'm happy.
You mourned me, even though I was called a tyrant.

 
---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Is that bad?


 
**Mash:**
Yes, sorry about that Emperor Nero.

 
**Mash:**
Well, it's a confusing problem, so I ended up using a negative expression...

 
**Mash:**
Emperor Nero, no...Nero.
You are definitely here in Rome.

 
**Mash:**
I am happy about such fortune, Emperor.

 
**Nero:**
Umu, you're a really nice girl, Mash!

 
**Nero:**
You feel regret for your mistakes, and feel happy when good things happen.

 
**Nero:**
I'll forgive what you said with that smile of yours.
You can accompany me to a bath later as an apology!

 
---

 
**Nero:**
...Oh, not good. I always get carried away when Fujimaru is around.

 
**Nero:**
There's only one reason why we've come to Septem.
I want you to help me, Master.

 
**Nero:**
Remember when I brought out a boat last time?
I heard a little something during the voyage.

 
**Nero:**
Supposedly there's a ghost that appears in the cursed deserts on the outskirts of Rome.

 
**Nero:**
I think I might know who that ghost is.

 
**Nero:**
Right now, I'm carrying out my royal duties as a Servant,
but I'm not sure when I'll finish them and disappear.

 
**Nero:**
That's why before that happens...
I want to ease Rome's pain with my own two hands.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I'd love to help.

---
 


 
**Nero:**
&mdash;Umu.
I am counting on you, one who contracted with me.

 
**Mash:**
...The sun's gone down, Master.
It's a familiar scene, but it feels lonely here...

 
**Mash:**
...It's like no one's here.
A stage everyone's forgotten about...

 
**Nero:**
...

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Is it really around here?


---

**Fujimaru 2:**
What did you mean you think you know who it is?

---
 


 
**Nero:**
Umu, it should be around here. The shape of the rocks, the sound of the wind, the faded color of the setting sun...

 
**Nero:**
I remember it all, even now. The fate of an emperor who died here, in these wastelands.

 
**Mash:**
&mdash;!
Nero, is this&mdash;

 
**Nero:**
Umu. This is where I died.
Nero Claudius slit her own throat here.

 
**Nero:**
Nero loved the people and she continually showed her burning passion...

 
**Nero:**
However, it wasn't the warm love people knew of.

 
**Nero:**
Nero only knew how to love one way. To demand,
give, and burn away... Violently.

 
**Nero:**
It was like forcing people to do things, you may say.
Nero didn't realize even until her end, that her actions were like poison to the people.

 
**Nero:**
Nero made a mistake that weakened her own position,
and was chased away from her throne by the senate.

 
**Nero:**
The army turned against her, but even then she believed that the people she loved so passionately would defend her.

 
**Nero:**
...I don't think I need to tell you what happened.
The people didn't defend the foolish tyrant.

 
**Nero:**
Although Nero escaped from her pursuers, she chose to end her life out of grief.

 
**Nero:**
&mdash;I can't say what Nero was grieving over.
Just that her life ended here.

 
**Nero:**
But...Nero didn't die that easily.

 
**Nero:**
Or more like she couldn't die, rather.
She couldn't breathe. Her heart ached. Her eyes burned.

 
**Nero:**
It was like being driven to madness by a never-ending fever.

 
**Nero:**
Three days passed and Nero still wasn't discovered by her pursuers.

 
**Nero:**
She woke at sunset each day,
for she thought she heard people calling out her name.

 
**Nero:**
It was the sound of the people that she loved. She knew they didn't blame Emperor Nero. That they were praising her.

 
**Nero:**
Haha, talk about adding insult to injury.
That couldn't have been, it just couldn't.

 
**Nero:**
Even so... Nero awoke, just to verify what she heard.

 
**Nero:**
At the first sunset, she sniffed her nose to an illusion.
At the second sunset, she bit her lips to the inaudible calls.

 
**Nero:**
And at the third sunset&mdash;

 
**Mash:**
...That's right.
Emperor Nero said her last words.

 
**Mash:**
A soldier found her body, exposed in the wilderness,
and out of pity, covered her with a cloth.

 
**Mash:**
At that moment, Emperor Nero opened her eyes and said: "Too late, but how noble of you."

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...

---
 


 
**Nero:**
Umu, my fate ended there.

 
**Nero:**
I don't know what Nero was thinking at the very end.

 
**Nero:**
But Nero was okay with that.
Even if it wasn't by the people she loved so much&mdash;

 
**Nero:**
The tyrant was happy that her life ended with the warmth of a human.

 
**Nero:**
That's the deus ex machina that I dream of even now.

 
**Nero:**
Because no matter what happened, it was that very miracle which made the story a happy ending.

 
**Nero:**
If that soldier hadn't come along, I would have still been waiting in the wilderness for the impossible.

 
**Nero:**
And that is why!
Why I must kill you!

 
**Nero:**
A tyrant's wandering dream!
The reflection of a flower that forgot how to wither!

 
**Nero:**
The ghost of mine that cannot accept this end!
Show yourself and take up your sword!

 
**Ghost:**
&mdash;

 
**Mash:**
A collection of powerful magical energy?
What is this&mdash;

 
**Mash:**
It's not the shadow of a Servant, nor its ghost...
it's like the Demon God&mdash;

 
**Nero:**
The Fifth Emperor, Nero Claudius, implores you!
My Master, Fujimaru!

 
**Nero:**
Lend me your strength! I might be a bit late, but&mdash;
I shall right my wrongs with my own sword!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Leave it to me, Nero!


---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Gladly, Your Majesty!

---
 



**--BATTLE--:**

**Nero:**
You idiot!
How could an actor refuse to let the curtain go down?

 
**Nero:**
We thrive, and then perish! We cannot avoid death!
The ending cannot be changed!

 
**Nero:**
That is why we sing!
That is why we scream!

 
**Nero:**
I neither give up on, nor lament what I love! No matter how many times that final curtain comes down!

 
**Ghost:**
...Oh...I can hear it...
The call from the capital... The sixth...

 
**Nero:**
...Farewell.
The girl who never went back to being "me."

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Nero...

---


**Fujimaru 2:**
What do you mean "me"?

---
 


 
**Nero:**
...Umu. Worthless mumbles to myself.
Don't worry about it.

 
**Nero:**
In any event&mdash;

 
**Nero:**
That was wonderful, Fujimaru.
I expected nothing less from you! I knew you were dependable!

 
**Nero:**
Thanks to you, that which disturbed Rome... No, it didn't disturb Rome actually, it was being ignored by Rome...

 
**Nero:**
I feel lonely now.
I think I could get depressed here...

 
**Nero:**
No, that's not it. The people were just being nice and pretending they didn't see me!

 
**Nero:**
That's the Roman citizens and Nero for you!
They're the best!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Just how positive can you be?!

---


**Fujimaru 2:**
Such a display of strength!

---
 


 
**Nero:**
How could I serve as an emperor otherwise?
If you have a little hope, you can laugh.

 
**Nero:**
That's how I live! No matter how may many times I fall, I'll get back up again!

 
**Nero:**
I'll show you that next time Mash, Fujimaru.

 
**Nero:**
I was victorious because of you all.
I'll show you my thanks on the battlefield.

 
**Nero:**
Anyway, let's get back to Chaldea, Master!
Let's bring thunderous applause to this Earth!
