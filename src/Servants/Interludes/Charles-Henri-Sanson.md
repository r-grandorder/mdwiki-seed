# Charles-Henri Sanson

## Guillotine Boy

**Sanson:**
...

 
**Citizen:**
Guillotine!
Put 'em on the guillotine!

 
**Citizen:**
Be beheaded and know the evil you have done up to now!

 
**Sanson:**
...

 
**Citizen:**
Guillotine! Guillotine! Guillotine!
Kill them! Kill them! Kill them!

 
**Sanson:**
...Whoa.
You seemed to be having a nightmare. What happened?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
The dream, just now...
 


---
 
**Sanson:**
Maybe you dreamed about me?
Really, I was just recalling the past now, too.

 
**Sanson:**
...My life is a repeat of what you saw.
There are no regrets. None obviously.

 
**Sanson:**
I mean, an executioner wielding a sword with regret would be something below a packhorse.

 
**Sanson:**
I send criminals to heaven, without an instant of pain, to enable them to travel freely to their death.

 
**Sanson:**
Executioners are the blades of the state at all times.
It wouldn't work any other way.

 
**Sanson:**
This is because the law can be bent at any time.
If it declares a criminal innocent, that's fine too.

 
**Sanson:**
They merely slipped through a loophole of the law.
As long as nobody gives up, the criminal will still be punished someday.

 
**Sanson:**
But&ndash;the law punishes the innocent at times.
This was especially prominent in the French Revolution.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Innocent people were killed?
 


---
 
**Sanson:**
That's right.

 
**Sanson:**
...Their crime, if any, was being born.

 
**Sanson:**
That child died simply because he served a man that should be executed.

 
**Sanson:**
Considering that, though there still are loopholes, the fact that the act of punishing the innocent has became rare 
 
**Sanson:**
should be something welcomed.

 
**Sanson:**
...Oh, sorry.
I apparently disturbed your slumber.

 
**Sanson:**
I pray that you have sweet dreams.
Well, good night.

 
**Sanson:**
Oh, is it Mash and Master?
What happened?

 
**Sanson:**
...That's right. It's definitely strange here.
It looks like... France, but not the Paris I grew up in.

 
**Mash:**
I can't specify the place. It appears that I can't communicate with the Doctor either.

 
**Mash:**
We may have been flown off to another era during the Rayshift.

 
**Mash:**
Let's ask what's going on in the city, first.

 
**Mash:**
There may be a Singularity, and we may be able to return if we fix that.

 
**Fou:**
Fou!

 
**Sanson:**
Oh, you're here, too?
...Yeah, it's as you say, Mash.

 
**Sanson:**
Let's move onward, Master.
We just might find something.

 
**Citizen:**
H-Help...

 
**Soldier:**
Quiet! You're guilty!
Proceed with the execution!

 
**Sanson:**
What'd you say...You stop it.
It's impossible to have an execution without a trial!

 
**Mash:**
Sanson!?

 
**Soldier:**
Who're you?
You, a townsman, dare to defy us!?

 
**Soldier:**
Gosh. These uneducated morons!
I shall execute you, in the name of the King.

 
**Sanson:**
...What...!?

 
**Soldier:**
No need for excuses.
We shall judge you!

 
**Sanson:**
...Right. How lucky. You said excuses are useless, and there's no room for discussion, right?

 
**Sanson:**
"Thanks for making this easy for me."
I feel like my soul is defiled simply by talking to you.

 
**Sanson:**
Permission to fight, Master.
I'll ask these soldiers where the true crime lies.


**--BATTLE--:**

**Sanson:**
We're good. They are unable to fight for now.
Let's free the citizens at once.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
What if they're criminals?
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
What if they're guilty?
 


---
 
**Sanson:**
...Be that as it may, the law is the law.
The area should be arranged for an execution, at least.

 
**Sanson:**
Not believing their innocence while helping them...
I must say I feel quite contradictory.

 
**Citizen:**
Ugh...!

 
**Soldier:**
So we're done with all executions, right?

 
**Soldier:**
Not yet.
You still have this child.

 
**Child:**
Uuh...

 
**Sanson:**
&ndash;That's enough.

 
**Soldier:**
...Why do you stop us?

 
**Sanson:**
...er!
It's obvious, isn't it!

 
**Sanson:**
That's not the law or an execution!
Just one-sided, unreasonable slaughter!

 
**Soldier:**
&ndash;You were involved, too, weren't you?
Charles-Henri Sanson.

 
**Sanson:**
...What...!?

 
**Soldier:**
Right.
You're in no position to say that.

 
**Soldier:**
In the name of the King.
In the name of the government.

 
**Soldier:**
How many men did you kill?
How many men did you punish?

 
**Soldier:**
...There were many innocent people among them, I bet.

 
**Sanson:**
Stop...Stop!!

 
**Soldier:**
IT IS YOUR FAULT!


**--BATTLE--:**

**Sanson:**
(Panting...)

 
**Mash:**
Sanson...

 
**Sanson:**
...I know. I do know.
I know that!

 
**Sanson:**
But, execution and murder are different!
No, they have to be different!

 
**Sanson (?):**
&ndash;Well, can you explain the difference?

 
**Sanson:**
...Er!?
Are you&ndash;me?

 
**Sanson (?):**
Am I you?

 
**Sanson (?):**
You became a Servant.
Do you kill somebody with your own free-will?

 
**Sanson (?):**
Or will you obey your Master&ndash;conform to the law,
and execute someone?

 
**Sanson:**
I am...
I am...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Sanson won't murder anymore.
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Sanson is an executioner.
 


---
 
**Sanson:**
Master...

 
**Sanson (?):**
This man was once greatly confused in France, and murdered many men.

 
**Sanson (?):**
How can you say he won't follow the same path again?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
As long as I'm the Master.
 


---
 
**Sanson:**
...Master...

 
**Sanson (?):**
If you're going to go that far, Master, I shall put that resolve to the test.

 
**Sanson (?):**
Whether or not "Sanson" can truly overcome it&ndash;!


**--BATTLE--:**

**Sanson (?):**
...Hmph.
You're that determined, Master?

 
**Sanson (?):**
That's fine, then. Though I have yet to assess whether I can place my blade of trust with you&ndash;

 
**Sanson (?):**
First, let's show you what I can do as an executioner.

 
**Sanson:**
Hey there.
Were you dreaming?

 
**Sanson:**
...Probably.
I was dreaming myself.

 
**Sanson:**
...Still no end to my worries.
No, my agony haunts me even now, after death.

 
**Sanson:**
Nevertheless, I offer my strength to you for believing in me then.

 
**Sanson:**
Because that's all that I can do now&ndash;
