# Houzouin Inshun

## A Fight Against the Self (Literally)

**Inshun:**
Hmm, hmm, hmm.
I see, I see.

 
**Inshun:**
So he is somehow me, but also not me...

 
**Inshun:**
...Lancer of Purgatorio.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I'd rather not think about him too much...
 
**Inshun:**
I understand.
I am very sorry about this, Fujimaru.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Sorry we don't really have much on him...
 
**Inshun:**
Not at all. This is more than enough.
Hmm, I see he was quite the monster.

 


---

**Mash:**
Can I ask what brought this up, Inshun? What made you want to see the information on Shimousa now...?

 
**Inshun:**
A fair question.

 
**Inshun:**
As I see it, one could make a compelling case for Lancer of Purgatorio's sins being my own.

 
**Inshun:**
Despite being summoned as a Heroic Spirit...

 
**Inshun:**
...it was my own strength that made me a target&ndash;a catalyst to facilitate my fall to Lancer of Purgatorio.

 
**Inshun:**
That will never do. It is a far more miserable fate than I could have ever imagined.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
But, that wasn't your fault...
 
**Inshun:**
Indeed not.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
You have a pretty intense sense of personal responsibility!
 
**Inshun:**
I am a monk first, you know.
Even before I am a hero.

 


---
 
**Inshun:**
Of course, I have no memory whatsoever of the time I spent as Lancer of Purgatorio.

 
**Inshun:**
So, from my perspective...

 
**Inshun:**
...it is no different than having a doppelgänger going around causing destruction in my name.

 
**Inshun:**
However, Master, there is one aspect of this in particular that I absolutely cannot abide.

 
**Inshun:**
This evil doppelgänger of mine cannot&ndash;must not be stronger than me.

 
**Inshun:**
For if giving myself over to evil made my spear techniques that much sharper, I would have no choice but to do so.

 
**Inshun:**
Of course, I would see it as a failure, as I would have given up my humanity.

 
**Inshun:**
But had I learned of it while I was alive...I cannot say for certain that I could have resisted the temptation that would have offered.

 
**Inshun:**
Indeed, I cannot be certain at all.
And that worries me!

 
**Inshun:**
Lady Musashi was kind enough to assure me that I was definitely stronger than Purgatorio...

 
**Inshun:**
...but that is not enough!

 
**Inshun:**
No, I believe the only choice left to me now is to prove it in the simulator.

 
**Inshun:**
It is possible to do that, yes?
If I can converse with him there too, so much the better.

 
**Inshun:**
This way, I can find out which of us is stronger...me, or my evil doppelgänger.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...All right, I can see you've made up your mind.
 
**Inshun:**
Indeed, I have.
Thank you for indulging me, Master!

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Okay, let's do it!
 
**Inshun:**
Wonderful! No evil version of me will ever get the better of my true self!

 


---
 
**Mash:**
...Now I see. Fighting Lancer of Purgatorio really is something you need to do for yourself.

 
**Mash:**
Understood.
I'll boot up the simulator right now!


**--BATTLE--:**

**Inshun:**
Too easy!

 
**Inshun:**
In fact...they all seemed strangely weak.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Yeah, the real one was way stronger than that.
 
**Inshun:**
I thought as much.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Maybe you're just that good...?
 
**Inshun:**
Thank you, Master, but I know that the Purgatorio I saw in Chaldea's database was capable of more than this.

 


---
 
**Inshun:**
Lady Mash, I appreciate your thoughtfulness,
but there is no need to hold anything back.

 
**Inshun:**
Please, give me something closer to the true Purgatorio.

 
**Mash:**
R-right!

 
**Mash:**
Okay, let's see...
I know, I'll try raising the difficulty!

 
**Mash:**
I'll also increase his base stats, unlock his Noble Phantasm, and give him more subordinates to command...

 
**Mash:**
There, that should do it.
Commencing second battle now!


**--BATTLE--:**

**Inshun:**
Hmm. That was certainly a more challenging foe...
but still a far cry from what I was hoping for.

 
**Inshun:**
His spear technique was lacking in both refinement and bloodlust.

 
**Mash:**
I see... I'm sorry. I'm afraid this might be as close as the simulator can get.

 
**Inshun:**
What a shame. Then I suppose it will not be possible to compare our skills in this manner.

 
**Inshun:**
I apologize for wasting your time with this, Master!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Don't worry about it. All part of the job.


---
 
**Inshun:**
Hahahaha. Spoken like a true leader.

 
**Inshun:**
Very well then, let us call it a day.
Thank you again, Master!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Anytime, Inshun.


---
 
**Fou:**
Fooou...

 
**Narration:**
The sky is stained red as blood.
Crimson crows caw eerily in the distance.

 
**Narration:**
Blood drips from the tip of my spear. I will not relax my grip until those before me are dead.

 
**Narration:**
...Rejoice. Your offerings are all here.

 
**Narration:**
I will kill all manner of innocents.
Children, the elderly, infants, invalids...

 
**Narration:**
Why, you ask? To sharpen my spear. Spears are meant for killing, and so only killing can hone their edges.

 
**Narration:**
The time for the massacre is at hand.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Wh-what the hell!?


---
 
**Lancer of Purgatorio:**
Hahahahahaha!
Hee... Heeheeheeheehee!

 
**Lancer of Purgatorio:**
What a delightful discovery! I can feel my skills sharpening with every life my spear takes!

 
**Lancer of Purgatorio:**
Thinking back on it now...
my life could not have been more dull!

 
**Lancer of Purgatorio:**
Behold, behold, behold, Fujimaru!

 
**Lancer of Purgatorio:**
The more bodies pile up,
the keener my spear grows!

 
**Lancer of Purgatorio:**
Now, you will bear witness as I kill hundreds, thousands, all to propel my spear into the realm of the gods!

 
**A：???:**
Ahem... I apologize for interrupting your speech,
but I take it you are Lord Lancer of Purgatorio?

 
**Lancer of Purgatorio:**
...So, you've come...
Houzouin Inshun...!

 
**Inshun:**
Of course. Now that I have heard your third-rate villainy for myself, I cannot simply stand by and do nothing about it.

 
**Inshun:**
My name is Houzouin Inshun.
Now, let us have a good, fair fight.

 
**Lancer of Purgatorio:**
Hahaha! You, Inshun?
At best, you are a pale imitation.

 
**Lancer of Purgatorio:**
You live in a dreamworld, whereas I live in reality. Refusing to take life? The Buddha's mercy?

 
**Lancer of Purgatorio:**
Foolishness! Complete and utter foolishness!

 
**Lancer of Purgatorio:**
You reached your limit the moment you allowed such pointless notions to hold you back!

 
**Lancer of Purgatorio:**
There will be no fight!
Only a slaughter!

 
**Inshun:**
If killing truly made one stronger, the Warring States period would have overflowed with masters of the blade.

 
**Inshun:**
Hmm... Be honest with me, Master.

 
**Inshun:**
Between him and me, who do you think is stronger?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You!
 
**Inshun:**
Hahahaha! You have a good eye indeed, Master!

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Us!
 
**Inshun:**
O-oh, right. It is a bit embarrassing to have it pointed out so bluntly, but I cannot deny it!

 


---
 
**Inshun:**
That aside, if anyone here should be laughing, it is me!

 
**Inshun:**
Purgatorio, you have been going on and on about making your spear sharper, which leaves me a bit confused.

 
**Inshun:**
Which is it? Do you wish for your spear to grow sharper, or do you wish to grow stronger?

 
**Lancer of Purgatorio:**
What was that...?

 
**Inshun:**
The best mouse-catching cat in the world would be no good to anyone if it also went around eating people.

 
**Inshun:**
After all, a cat's most important duty is to be cute. Would you not agree?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Meow.
 
**Inshun:**
Exactly. All a cat need do to be cute is meow.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Yeah, I guess that's true.
 
**Inshun:**
Unfortunately, it seems Purgatorio here has gotten his priorities mixed up.

 


---
 
**Lancer of Purgatorio:**
What are you even talking about!?

 
**Inshun:**
It's simple.

 
**Inshun:**
If all you want is a sharper spear, there is a better way to obtain it than by slaughtering people.

 
**Lancer of Purgatorio:**
What...!?

 
**Inshun:**
All you need do is let someone stronger handle it.
What could be easier?

 
**Lancer of Purgatorio:**
Ridiculous, Inshun!
You're not making the least bit of sense!

 
**Inshun:**
And what sense is there in causing others unnecessary pain and suffering?

 
**Inshun:**
Is your desire merely to brag about all the lives you have taken?

 
**Inshun:**
If so, I can think of no more hollow or foolish endeavor than the one you undertake.

 
**Inshun:**
I imagine the corruption makes it impossible for you to know any better, but I cannot help but laugh when I think how you truly believed that was all you needed to grow stronger.

 
**Inshun:**
All right. I've learned all I wanted to know.
Now the only thing left to us is a duel.

 
**Inshun:**
Indeed, I consider this an act of mercy, for I have never in my life met a more pitiable opponent!

 
**Lancer of Purgatorio:**
Enough of your foolish prattling, Inshun!

 
**Lancer of Purgatorio:**
You will see for yourself how sharp my spear has become...as it slices you to ribbons!

 
**Inshun:**
Come then, Master.

 
**Inshun:**
Let us bring this to a speedy end and be on our way back to Chaldea!


**--BATTLE--:**

**Lancer of Purgatorio:**
Mwahahaha! Is that all you've got!?
None can match this body and its sheer techni&ndash;

 
**Inshun:**
It's over.

 
**Lancer of Purgatorio:**
 
Wha...!?
Ah... Ahhh!?

 
**Lancer of Purgatorio:**
Impossible! This can't be right! Your strike had all the strength of a house cat swatting at a reed! How could I not parry it...!?

 
**Inshun:**
You have wasted so much power; power that already exceeded your limits. Of course it would leave you vulnerable.

 
**Inshun:**
You completely failed to understand your own body, Purgatorio.

 
**Lancer of Purgatorio:**
No... No! This cannot be true!

 
**Lancer of Purgatorio:**
I haven't even avenged my defeat at the hands of that Musashi woman!

 
**Lancer of Purgatorio:**
My miraculous resurrection was meant to be my chance to exact my reven&ndash;

 
**Inshun:**
Hmm, I suppose you may fare a bit better against an opponent with swords since that has been your focus...

 
**Inshun:**
...but the rest is quite sloppy. You may have gained in one area, but you have lost much in others.

 
**Lancer of Purgatorio:**
Wha...

 
**Inshun:**
Whether they reach the level of the Buddha or become an oni, everyone eventually hits their limit.

 
**Inshun:**
Speaking for myself, I find it an incredible waste.

 
**Inshun:**
Your spear may have grown sharper,
but as a Lancer, you have grown weaker.

 
**Lancer of Purgatorio:**
How... How dare yoooooou!?
You'll pay for this, Inshun!

 
**Inshun:**
Farewell, Purgatorio.

 
**Inshun:**
...What a disappointment. To think I would be no more than a common highwayman if I fell from grace...

 
**Lancer of Purgatorio:**
 
Urk... Ghh...

 
**Inshun:**
Phew, there we go.
Now that was a good simulation.

 
**Inshun:**
Lady Mash, would you be so kind as to turn the simulator off now? ...Lady Mash?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I don't think we're in the simulator.
 
**Inshun:**
...Are you sure?

 
**Inshun:**
They called me here so suddenly that I simply assumed this was some sort of emergency training...

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I think this is just a dream.
 
**Inshun:**
I see. Just another dream sequence, huh.
...Wait. A dream!?

 


---
 
**Inshun:**
Ahh...

 
**Inshun:**
I never thought this would only turn out to be a dream I shared with you, Master!

 
**Inshun:**
Hmm... Well, I suppose that is all right.

 
**Inshun:**
If the only life I took was my own,
surely no one could be upset about that!

 
**Inshun:**
Indeed, I believe they refer to this as a win-win-win!

 
**Inshun:**
...No?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
All's well that ends well!


---
 
**Inshun:**
Right!

 
**Inshun:**
Now then, I think I will have to try dueling Lady Musashi as soon as I wake up...

 
**Inshun:**
Otherwise, all the effort Purgatorio put into his anti-Musashi techniques will go to waste.

 
**Inshun:**
Still, there is one thing this incident has assured me of, Master.

 
**Inshun:**
I am now certain that I truly am the best version of myself!
