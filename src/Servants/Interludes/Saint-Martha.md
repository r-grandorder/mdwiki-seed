# Saint Martha

## Saint of the Dragon and Sea

**Martha:**
A normal...
Yes, the kind of normal girl you'd find in any town.

 
**Martha:**
I lived happily with my little sister and brother, even though we quarreled from time to time.

 
**Martha:**
I was born in Bethany, and raised in the same town.

 
**Martha:**
I thought that I'd live my life the same as everyone else.

 
**Martha:**
...No. Actually, how shall I put it?
Perhaps I never even thought about the future.

 
**Martha:**
Because I was always busy. What should we have for dinner tonight? What would tomorrow's weather be&ndash;

 
**Martha:**
I was always running around, even when "He" was there.

 
**Martha:**
While my sister listened to "His" words, all I did was worry about making guests feel welcomed.

 
**Mash:**
Martha, you were a girl who put her family first.
I think that's admirable.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You're naturally friendly.
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I think it's nice.
 


---
 
**Martha:**
I wonder about that.
Aren't you disappointed?

 
**Martha:**
Saints whom people love always seem to shine...Yes, like Jeanne d'Arc.

 
**Mash:**
Both Jeanne and you seem like shining saints to me.

 
**Mash:**
In loving people, you became their hope.
That's the sort of women you are.

 
**Mash:**
That's why I think you equally deserve to be called saints.

 
**Martha:**
...Thank you, Mash Kyrielight.

 
**Mash:**
Don't mention it&ndash;

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Oh, sorry to interrupt, but I'm detecting multiple magical signatures in the sea ahead.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Just as Martha feared, there's some sort of distortion on the Marseille coast as it's being repaired.

 
**Mash:**
Doctor, do we need to dive under the sea?

 
**Martha:**
I doubt it. If push comes to shove,
my Tarasque will guide the "swarm" to the shore.

 
**Mash:**
Swarm?

 
**Fou:**
Fooou?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Guide? Wait, is Fou there with you?

 
**Martha:**
Yes. That's a swarm, without a doubt.
My trait allows me to accurately detect that.

 
**Martha:**
A swarm of an incomplete subspecies of dragon.
Something that shouldn't be in this area of the 15th century.

 
**???:**
GYAAAAAA&ndash;!

 
**Mash:**
...That's the roar of a wyvern!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
I see! As expected of the Saint of Dragons!
You sensed the swarm of wyverns gather.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Prepare for battle!
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Martha, call the Tarasque!
 


---
 
**Martha:**
...This is nothing.
This coast was once part of the Tarasque's domain.

 
**Martha:**
Born of Leviathan, created by God on the Fifth Day&ndash;
he is a fierce monster many a brave man tried to slay.

 
**Martha:**
Now the Tarasque exists with me.
The sad dragon who knows not of love.

 
**Martha:**
Go now Tarasque, wielding a burning heat equal to the sun...

 
**Martha:**
Grant momentary peace to these creatures made pitiful by the moment of their birth&ndash;

 
**Dr. Roman:**
St. Martha's magical energy is rising! I-Is this turning into a battle of Kaiju Tarasque vs. Wyvern Army?

 
**Mash:**
The wyvern swarm is approaching!
Time for battle, Senpai!


**--BATTLE--:**

**Mash:**
Battle's over. No&ndash;
more are coming! Confirming a trailing swarm!

 
**Martha:**
There's just no end to them!
This is annoying!

 
**Mash:**
Huh?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Hm?

 
**Fou:**
Fou?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Martha, did you just&ndash;
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I must have imagined it.
 


---
 
**Martha:**
Did something happen, everyone?
Come on, let's hang on a little longer. FIGHT!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
FIGHT!
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I must have imagined it.
 


---
 
**Mash:**
Um, uh, right. We're going to continue the battle!
Senpai, your orders, please!


**--BATTLE--:**

**Mash:**
I confirm the enemy is completely destroyed!
We did it, Senpai!

 
**Martha:**
&ndash;Ha. You're no match for us, lizards. Did those mere wyverns hope to best me and the Tarasque?

 
**Martha:**
They're just peeping hatchlings, fresh from their eggs.

 
**Mash:**
!!!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Y-Your Holiness?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Lalala, I don't hear anything.
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
...
 


---
 
**Martha:**
...Ahem.
Thus return the poor souls who know not of love.

 
**Martha:**
God's love is equal.
Yes, in the past, the Tarasque was treated the same.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Y-Yes.
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I'm sure.
 


---
 
**Martha:**
When dragons choose slaughter and refuse to listen,
the use of force is the only way♡

 
**Dr. Roman:**
O-Oh ...Terrible...
I mean, total respect, Your Holiness!

 
**Mash:**
St. Martha may be a saint, but she's also an extremely gifted dragon slayer, isn't she?

 
**Mash:**
I see that now.
Senpai, she'll be a very dependable Servant.

 
**Martha:**
Oh, you're too kind.
I'm just&ndash;

 
**Martha:**
&ndash;Just a magnificent dragon slayer♡

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Huh&ndash;?
She called herself a dragon slayer?

 
**Fou:**
Foou, foufou!


## The Desired Saint

**Martha:**
...

 
**Mash:**
...

 
**Fou:**
Fou...

 
**Mash:**
...Yes, Fou.
But please be quiet for now.

 
**Martha:**
...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Martha, is something bothering you?
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
What's with this atmosphere?
 


---
 
**Mash:**
Yes, Martha's on edge, isn't she?
Ever since we came to this era.

 
**Mash:**
There's something wrong in Ancient Rome, in the Second Singularity.
It was her&ndash;It was Martha who told us that.

 
**Mash:**
I assume it's not a good news.
Could it be related to the dragons again?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
If so, then that's odd.
Wasn't she all excited about it before?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Maybe it's personal this time?
 
**Mash:**
But the era she lived in before&ndash;
was the 1st century, wasn't it?

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
What could it be?
 
**Mash:**
I have no idea&ndash;

 


---
 
**Martha:**
...Normally.

 
**Martha:**
It's normally not possible, because all souls are under God's divine grace.

 
**Martha:**
Wandering the Earth, not going to either Heaven or Hell.

 
**Martha:**
Such acts are not allowed, I mean, all of the...

 
**Martha:**
Original Sins have already...

 
**Mash:**
Martha?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
The souls&ndash; Oh! I detect a magical energy reaction! A large amount, dead ahead!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Based on the signature pattern, ghosts are coming, be careful!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Mash, prepare for battle!
 
**Mash:**
Yes, Master!

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Martha, time for battle!
 
**Martha:**
...

 


---
 
**Martha:**
...Damn.

 
**Mash:**
Huh?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Damn! A saint said damn?
Uh, d-did I say something wrong?

 
**Martha:**
I said it's freaking impossible...
And what's with that stupid amount.

 
**Martha:**
I thought I said all souls, are under the God's divine grace...

 
**Fou:**
Fou.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Lalala, I can't hear anything.
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Martha!
 


---
 
**Mash:**
So I didn't imagine it last time.
Something's wrong with Martha&ndash;

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Yes, you're right! You're definitely right!
Souls wandering the Earth is normally "not possible!"

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Sending them back to God's grace, yes.
But ghost-type monsters, really?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
They only exist because of magecraft, they aren't "naturally" generated.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
In other words, they aren't part of nature.
But, hold on, if that's the case then Heroic Spirits&ndash;

 
**???:**
Ohh, oh, ohhhh&ndash;

 
**Martha:**
...I told you.

 
**Martha:**
This is freaking impossible.
Why do they appear before us, especially&ndash;

 
**Martha:**
...before me!

 
**Mash:**
St. Martha's magical energy level is rising!
S-Senpai, she's going to unleash her Noble Phantasm!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Without the Master's order? S-She's pissed!
O-Oh no, Fujimaru!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
With Kaiju Tarasque on the rampage Rome is done for!
Get her under control! T-To battle!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Eliminate those ghost as soon as you can!
Is that clear?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Mash, prepare for battle!
 


---
 
**Mash:**
Yes, Master!


**--BATTLE--:**

**Mash:**
Hostiles, destroyed!
...The battle's over, Senpai.

 
**Mash:**
This should put Martha back to being her usual quiet self...

 
**Martha:**
...

 
**Mash:**
Huh?

 
**Fou:**
Foou...

 
**Dr. Roman:**
If she's not back to normal, then, Umm&ndash;
Right, of course. I've got it, you two!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
There's still something there.
Rather, she's here because she sensed "this."

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Something much larger than a mere ghost.
This is, yes, the sixth imaginary element&ndash;

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Its true nature is unknown, but at the very least, its magical energy indicates is "that".

 
**Mash:**
...I sense it, too.
Senpai, prepare for battle.

 
**Fou:**
Fou&ndash;

 
**Martha:**
...

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Don't let Martha go out! It's likely she'll unleash the True Name of her Noble Phantasm like before.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
At any rate, your opponent is&ndash;

 
**???:**
GAAAAAA&ndash;!!

 
**Mash:**
Picking up high level of magical energy!
It's definitely a "demon."

 
**Martha:**
...Tarasque.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Oh, no! Fujimaru, hurry! We have to defeat the enemy and take control of St. Martha!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Mash, prepare for battle!
 
**Mash:**
Yes, Master!
Preparing for battle!

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Martha, please take care of this!
 
**Martha:**
...Unforgivable. Unforgivable!
I'll crush it.

 


---
 
**Fou:**
Fou, fou-foou!!

 
**Mash:**
Here we go!!


**--BATTLE--:**

**Martha:**
...For heaven's sake.

 
**Martha:**
Haven't we enough trials to face?
Just look at this world, isn't it obvious?

 
**Martha:**
There's no place for anyone who can't see that, may that be men or demons. Back to hell with you!

 
**Martha:**
No matter what era it is, there's no place for demons.

 
**Martha:**
...Because all original sins were carried away by "Him."

 
**Mash:**
...Martha...

 
**Dr. Roman:**
All right, the battle's over.
And it looks like St. Martha's calm again. Whew!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
All's well that ends well.
Wow, that was scary...

 
**Fou:**
Fou, foou!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
A demon possessing the power equal to a dragon is scary, but, I think I am more afraid of St. Martha actually.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Really, I'm really glad she didn't go berserk...

 
**Martha:**
Pardon?
Did I do something?

 
**Martha:**
Thanks to you, we've driven off the lost souls and the demon. All this too is God's will.

 
**Martha:**
Yes, in normal circumstances, my existence as a Heroic Spirit is unnatural.

 
**Martha:**
Even so... As long as I am with you, those who strive to save the world.

 
**Martha:**
My momentary existence.
My shallow resurrection.

 
**Martha:**
...I believe all that has a purpose.
Thank you. Fujimaru, Mash Kyrielight.

 
**Mash:**
No, St. Martha, thank you for lending us your assistance.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Yes, thank you.
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
We'll be counting on you.
 


---
 
**Martha:**
...Yes.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
(Huh? Did she skip my name just now?)

 
**Fou:**
(Fou, foou)
