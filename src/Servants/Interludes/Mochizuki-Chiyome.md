# Mochizuki Chiyome

## Snakes... They Coil Around Me

**Shuten-Douji:**
Oh, hello.

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
What a coincidence, running into you here.

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
I think this might be the first time for us to bump into each other without anyone else being around. Do I have that right?

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
Usually you look away or hide in Master's shadow the second you see me.

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
Let's see, I think your name was Paraíso...?
No, no, wait, I've got it.
You're that Kouga Mochizuki clan ninja.

 
**Chiyome:**
Ulp...

 
**Chiyome:**
A-ah...ah...

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
Now what was your name again? Mochizuki...Chiyojo? Chiyome? Mmm... Chiyome's muuuch cuter, so let's just go with that.

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
What's your class, Chiyome?
Assassin?

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
Why, what a coincidence! Mine too!
Will wonders never cease.

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
After all, you and I are both clearly...

 
**Chiyome:**
A-aaah... Aah...
Ulp...

 
**Chiyome:**
(She's...looking at me...)
P-please...stop... No... No...

 
**Chiyome:**
...Forgive...me...

 
**Chiyome:**
...!

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
My, my... She really doesn't care for little old me, does she?

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
Why, it makes me feel like a frog staring down a snake.

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
...Hmm?

 
**Medusa:**
Um, did you want to talk to me about something?

 
**Medusa:**
I'm in a bit of a hurry.
I have to bring my sisters their meal.

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
Oh, don't worry, this will only take a moment.
You see...

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
(Mumble, mumble... Whisper, whisper)

 
**Medusa:**
What, is this supposed to be a secret?
Hmm... Are you sure she'd like that?

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
You're a god too, right? Come on, can't you do an oni a favor? Pretty pleeease?

 
**Medusa:**
...Nnn... I'm not sure...
But, well... Hmm...

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
It's not like this would be your first time, right?

 
**Medusa:**
Nnn...

 
**Chiyome:**
...Master?

**Fujimaru 1:**
Chiyome?
 
**Chiyome:**
Yes, Master. It is I, Mochizuki Chiyome,
Kouga Jonin.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Shuten asked me to come here...
 
**Chiyome:**
I-is that so.

 


---
 
**Chiyome:**
I am here on behalf of the Lancer, Lady Medusa,
who asked me to come to the Command Room.

 
**Chiyome:**
But, I see she is not here...
What is going on?

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
Good evening, all.
You see, I'm what's going on!

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
Lovely night, isn't it? Really gets my blood pumping, if you know what I mean.

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
Mind helping me take the edge off with a bit of exercise? Chaldea's got that “simulator” thing, yes?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You want to do combat training?
 
**Shuten-Douji:**
Yeah, that sounds good. Seeing how we're the same class and all, I was hoping she could give me some pointers.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
You mean, you want to spar with Chiyome?
 


---
 
**Shuten-Douji:**
Sounds like Master's on board with it.
What do you say, Chiyome? Care to join me?

 
**Chiyome:**
!

 
**Chiyome:**
I-if Master commands it...I would happily go to the ends of the earth.

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
Fufu, that sounds like a yes to me! That's the spirit.
All right then, let's get started!


**--BATTLE--:**

**Chiyome:**
...
...

 
**Chiyome:**
...Snakes, snakes, snakes. So many snakes!

 
**Chiyome:**
Wh-wh-what is the meaning of this!?

 
**Chiyome:**
There are so many snakes!
It's like you're...purposefully...

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
Oh?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Are you afraid of snakes, Chiyome?
 
**Chiyome:**
I-I...

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
You're doing this on purpose, aren't you, Shuten?
 


---
 
**Shuten-Douji:**
Not a big fan of snakes, are you?

 
**Chiyome:**
!!!

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
Chiyome of the Kouga Mochizuki clan. You use your curse sooo expertly, yet you don't seem at all accustomed to it.

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
What a waste. Don't you know how hard your ancestors worked to pass it down across generations?

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
They sure didn't go to all that effort just so you could cringe in terror at an illusion of a snake...

 
**Chiyome:**
I... That's...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Hold up.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Are you trying to torment Chiyome?
 


---
 
**Shuten-Douji:**
Fufufu, you stay out of this, Master...
or I just might have to eat you.

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
Come on, you know how it is.

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
Humans love overcoming their weaknesses, right?
Not me, of course. The very idea fills me with dread.

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
But you're a human-based Heroic Spirit, right, Chiyome? Don't you HAVE to overcome your weakness? Don't you want to?

 
**Chiyome:**
I-I...
I have no fear of...snakes...

 
**Chiyome:**
Indeed, I have no weaknesses whatsoever!

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
Oh, really? How silly of me. My bad.
I'm relieved to hear that.

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
Then we can keep going without worrying about needing to hold back.

 
**Chiyome:**
...
...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Chiyome.
 
**Chiyome:**
P-please do not worry about me.
I have no issue with this whatsoever.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
We can always stop the simulator if you want.
 
**Chiyome:**
D-do not be ridiculous! I was already swallowed up by a snake long ago! I have nothing to fear from one now!

 


---
 
**Shuten-Douji:**
All right then, here goes nothing...

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
I do hope you'll forgive me if I end up squashing you like a bug.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Chiyome!

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Here she comes! Hang in there!
 


---
 
**Chiyome:**
Yes, Master...!

 
**Chiyome:**
I, Mochizuki Chiyome, shall carry out your orders to the letter!


**--BATTLE--:**

**Chiyome:**
Snakes, snakes, and more snakes...
I have had enough!!!

 
**Chiyome:**
Just...

 
**Chiyome:**
Just wh-what do you want with me!? Fine, I confess!
I have been terrified of snakes since I was a child!

 
**Chiyome:**
But so what!? What would you know of the pain and suffering that comes from being born with the curse of Orochi!?

 
**Chiyome:**
How could you possibly know what it is like to be burdened with the knowledge that you will one day grow scales and become a serpent!?

 
**Chiyome:**
That day may be today...or tomorrow...or any of the days yet to come!

 
**Chiyome:**
Or worse, perhaps that fate will not fall to me, but to my child, or my grandchild, or my distant descendant...

 
**Chiyome:**
But regardless of who is made to endure that fate, it is one that all of Orochi's shrine maidens born to the Mochizuki clan must bear!

 
**Chiyome:**
Even in death, in this new, transient life as a shadow, my curse has not been lifted...

 
**Chiyome:**
Do you have any idea how this feels!?

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
Hmm.

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
Nope!

 
**Chiyome:**
!!!

 
**Chiyome:**
Then cease your torment of me and allow me to serve the new master I have found in peace!

 
**Chiyome:**
After all this time...!

 
**Chiyome:**
I have finally found a master that does not see shinobi as disposable pawns, but treats me with kindness and respect!

 
**Chiyome:**
I can hardly fathom my fortune in meeting [♂ him /♀️ her}!
I can never hope to adequately pay [♂ him /♀️ her} back!

 
**Chiyome:**
That is why I at least want to be of as much use to [♂ him /♀️ her} as I possibly can, to my very last breath!

 
**Chiyome:**
And yet...!

 
**Chiyome:**
You CEASELESSY seek to prevent me from doing so!
Why!?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Chiyome...
 


---
 
**Chiyome:**
Forgive my loss of temper, Master, but I am afraid my patience has reached its absolute limit!

 
**Chiyome:**
 
Lady Shuten-Douji!

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
Yeees?

 
**Chiyome:**
You are Shuten-Douji of Mt. Ooe...
The oni of the Heian period...

 
**Chiyome:**
No! As far as I am concerned, you are no oni of Mt. Ooe! You are nothing less than the child of the great serpent god responsible for my curse!

 
**Chiyome:**
I know that the ancient serpent, or perhaps dragon,
known as Yamata-no-Orochi, was once worshipped as Ibuki Daimyojin...and that he had a single child to his name!

 
**Chiyome:**
You, Lady Ibuki-Douji!

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
...Well, well. You've got guts,
calling me by THAT True Name, hmm, Chiyome.

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
My, my... You must reeeally hate me...

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
I was hoping for something like this, but I really must admit, you've surpassed all my expectations.

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
What is it they say these days about courage? Ah yes. You've got balls of steel...figuratively speaking.

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
I do love a good display of courage.

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
Just look at you shaking in your boots, digging your heels in like a child trying to look taller than she really is.

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
You really care for Master that much?
You wanna serve [♂ him /♀️ her} so badly it hurts?

 
**Chiyome:**
...I do.

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
Then...

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
...are you having a steamy romance with [♂ him /♀️ her}?
You ARE a widow, as I recall.

 
**Chiyome:**
L-l-loyalty and longing have nothing to do with one another!

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
Mm... Is that so? Then what would you do if [♂ he /♀️ she} asked you to share [♂ his /♀️ her} bed?

 
**Chiyome:**
If that is what my Master requires,
I would not hesitate!

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
Then you ARE having a little romance with [♂ him /♀️ her}.

 
**Chiyome:**
I-I told you that loyalty and longing have nothing to do with one another! Now, cease this at once! I will not have you slander Master's good name any further!

 
**Chiyome:**
Even if you are the daughter of Ibuki...
I will not let you insult [♂ him /♀️ her} again...

 
**Chiyome:**
...no matter how much the cursed blood of my ancestor, Kouga Saburou, may torment me!

 
**Chiyome:**
Be warned, Lady Ibuki!
Your next word will be your last!

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
Come get me.

 
**Chiyome:**
...Very well then! Have at you!


**--BATTLE--:**

**Chiyome:**
(Huff, huff...huff...!)
Her magical energy seems...inexhaustible!

 
**Chiyome:**
(Huff, huff...)
(Gasp...) We shinobi...do not usually find ourselves out of breath...

 
**Chiyome:**
So this is the power of an oni... Nay, the true power of Shuten-Douji, daughter of Orochi!!!

 
**Chiyome:**
...And apparently, she is still only using a fraction of it.

 
**Chiyome:**
Yet here I am, employing my full strength, to no avail. Is this is her oni power at work, or her serpent power?

 
**Chiyome:**
Nonetheless...
I will not admit defeat yet...

 
**Chiyome:**
...I refuse to lay down my blade until the very end!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
That's enough, Chiyome!

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Stop this! Both of you!
 


---
 
**Shuten-Douji:**
That's some fighting spirit you've got.
Still not enough to take down an oni, though.

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
But hey, you tried.

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
...
...

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
Well, I'm satisfied. I give up. You win, I lose.
See you around.

 
**Chiyome:**
...Huh?

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
...
...

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
...I was watching the whole time, Shuten.

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
Hey now, what's with the pouty face? I was just about to take a hot bath. Step aside, will you?

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
Do you have a thing for getting mixed up in other people's business or something?

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
Why else would you go around teasing that half-assed snake demon who clings desperately to her humanity?

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
Come to think of it, you did the same thing with that whole pagoda thing a while back. It's almost as if...

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
Yes?

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
Have you...

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
...Don't tell me you've started feeling sorry for humans?

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
Fu...
Hehe, fufufu.

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
Fufufufufufufufufu!

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
Ahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!Hehe, hehehe!
That's the funniest thing you've ever said, Ibaraki!

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
You've got it completely backwards!

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
Backwards...?

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
Fufu. It doesn't matter how many oni descendants or cursed bloodlines we get here. Those cowards could never be up to the task, since they wouldn't last a single breath against either you or I.

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
Humans, Heroic Spirits...they're all the same.

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
Just one little puff, and poof...they're gone.

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
???

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
Oh, I'm just thinking out loud.
Don't mind me.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You did great, Chiyome.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Way to go!
 


---
 
**Chiyome:**
Thank you!

 
**Chiyome:**
Although, I am still not sure if she was taking that fight seriously... I feel as though she was merely testing me.

 
**Chiyome:**
But regardless, my resolve will waver no longer.
Orochi's curse may never leave me...

 
**Chiyome:**
...and I may never entirely overcome my fear of it...but now I won't ever lose sight of where my loyalties lie.

 
**Chiyome:**
So please, worry not, Master!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Not a problem.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Glad to have you with us, Chiyome.
 


---
 
**Chiyome:**
Thank you!

 
**Chiyome:**
...I suppose I never did tell you about my ancestor, Saburou, and his curse.

 
**Chiyome:**
I am truly sorry for that, Master!
Truly!

 
**Chiyome:**
...
...

 
**Chiyome:**
I trust it hardly need be said at this point, but, yes, I am cursed, and there is nothing that can be done about it.

 
**Chiyome:**
So, if you wish to end our contract, and be rid of me and all the trouble I bring, I will understand...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I'm not ending anything.
 


---
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You'll always be welcome here, Chiyome!
 


---
 
**Chiyome:**
Thank you, Master!!! I promise to serve you to the very best of my ability!
