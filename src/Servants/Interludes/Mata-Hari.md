## Meltdown Lover

**Mata Hari:**
So this is the place that'll have clues for the investigation?

 
**Mash:**
Yes. And we'd like to ask you,
Mata Hari, to carry out the investigation.

 
**Mata Hari:**
Oh, you're wise with your decision.
I'll definitely get it done.

 
**Mata Hari:**
But, Master. Unfortunately, I won't be able to get anywhere by myself.

 
**Mata Hari:**
So, please be sure to protect me, hehe.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Of course.
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I'll do my best.
 


---
 
**Mata Hari:**
I'm counting on you.

 
**Mash:**
Please, we'll leave the investigation to you.

 
**Mata Hari:**
Right, of course.
Please hold on a second.

 
**Mata Hari:**
...I wonder if he'll do.
Well, I'll be on my way.

 
**Mata Hari:**
Once I enter the tavern, please wait until evening.
I'm sure there'll be a raid.

 
**Mash:**
Y-Yes.
I got it.

 
**Mata Hari:**
Hello, how are you?

 
**Citizen:**
Huh?
Oh, well...Who are you?

 
**Mata Hari:**
A traveling performer.
You're a local, right?

 
**Citizen:**
Yeah, I was born and raised here.

 
**Mata Hari:**
Then, can you tell me about this town?
I want to make a living here for a while.

 
**Mata Hari:**
If so, I'll have to know my way around the town, right?

 
**Mata Hari:**
Of course, I'll buy you a drink.
That is, if you know a good place.

 
**Citizen:**
Oh, of course.

 
**Mata Hari:**
Then, let's go.
Hehehe, maybe it's not healthy to drink during the day.

 
**Mata Hari:**
But, it's fun not being healthy.
...Wouldn't you agree?

 
**Citizen:**
Oh...Oh yeah, sure!
Then, let's go drink!

 
**Mash:**
...Brilliant technique. A man perceived as single and in his early thirties instantly fell for it.

 
**Mash:**
Despite wearing such revealing dress, she doesn't feel unnatural at all.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
A-As expected of a legendary spy who made men of French, English, and Russian governments fall for her...

 
**Dr. Roman:**
If she wants to, she can pleasure...
I mean, make the entire town fall for her.

 
**Mash:**
Anyway, let's follow her and wait until nightfall.

 
**Mash:**
Mata Hari is good at espionage but poor at fighting, so we have to support her.

 
**Mata Hari:**
Ahahaha, this is so much fun.
What happened to you?

 
**Mata Hari:**
Still haven't had enough to drink?
Or is there something else you rather do?

 
**Mata Hari:**
I guess it's true when men drink too much, they lose their performance.

 
**Citizen:**
...Who are you?
You are not just any traveling entertainer.

 
**Mata Hari:**
Well, who am I? That aside,
can you call out the soldiers you've been hiding?

 
**Citizen:**
!!!

 
**Mata Hari:**
Spectacular. Though I'm a Servant,
I'm a mere Assassin, so this may be out of my control.

 
**Mata Hari:**
...But.
Unfortunately for you, I'm not alone right now.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Let's go!
 


---
 
**Mata Hari:**
Yes, Master. I will give it everything since you believe in me, Mata Hari!

 
**Mata Hari:**
Hehehehehe.
Being a Servant is fun!


**--BATTLE--:**

**Mata Hari:**
Whew. It's over.
Well...Yup, that's the one right there.

 
**Soldier:**
Damn...You guys, what are you...?

 
**Mata Hari:**
Well now, that doesn't matter because you lost.
It's fine. Everyone's alive, right?

 
**Mata Hari:**
Now, why don't you tell us everything.
Don't miss a thing, ok?

 
**Mata Hari:**
Don't worry. I won't hurt you.
Because I hate things that hurt.

 
**Mata Hari:**
Or do you like to be hurt?
I can hurt you if you'd like.

 
**Soldier:**
N-No...
I'm fine...thank you...

 
**Mata Hari:**
Here, you can lay on my lap.
Well, go ahead&ndash;tell me, everything.

 
**Soldier:**
S-Sure...

 
**Mash:**
...Wow, that's amazing. How do you put it... I've witnessed the moment a man is captivated by someone.

 
**Mata Hari:**
What a good boy you are~
Now, tell mommy everything you know.

 
**Mash:**
This is dangerous, Senpai! If this continues,
we'll be crossing a line I'm not sure we want to!

 
**Mata Hari:**
I've got the information.
Let's go see the King.

 
**Mata Hari:**
It seems there're golems guarding the gate,
so let's all do our best there. On three!

 
**Mash:**
Mata Hari.
What happened to that man just now...

 
**Mata Hari:**
No problem. Even without me,
he'll surely find someone who matches his type.

 
**Mata Hari:**
Hehehehehehe.
What's your type, Master?

 
**Mash:**
L-Let's get going, Master!
Come on!

 
**Mata Hari:**
Hehehehehe.

 
**Mash:**
Golems sighted.
I'm going, Master!

 
**Mata Hari:**
Yes, let's do our best~


**--BATTLE--:**

**Mata Hari:**
So, the King is the last, huh?
Well, let's give him a good spanking first.

 
**Mata Hari:**
Then, I'll extract the information for you.

 
**Mash:**
But...he's the king of a country.
Can you do anything?

 
**Mata Hari:**
What're you talking about, cute little Mash?
From my experience, kings are the easiest to handle.

 
**Mata Hari:**
I mean, kings are at the top of their nations, right?
So, they need comfort more than anyone in their nations.

 
**Mata Hari:**
If anyone doesn't want that, then it must be a king who sacrifices everything for his people...or for God.

 
**Mata Hari:**
Otherwise, he's a tyrant who understands that it's the people who make all the sacrifices.

 
**Mata Hari:**
If he's an ordinary king, then no problem.
Well, let's fight.

 
**King:**
W-Who are you people!?
Stand back!

 
**Mash:**
No, pardon us but we'd like your assistance in an investigation. We also can't deny this is rather forceful.

 
**King:**
You bastards...!
K-Kill, I'm going to kill you&ndash;!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Watch out.
It appears that the King is possessed by something.

 
**Mash:**
I can see that!

 
**Mata Hari:**
Leaves us no choice, then.
Let's exorcise him, Masterâ™ª


**--BATTLE--:**

**King:**
Uh, I...what on earth...
Who are you people...?

 
**Mata Hari:**
Well done, Your Majesty.
Hehehe, my name is Mata Hari.

 
**King:**
Mata Hari...?
A strange...name...

 
**Mata Hari:**
Yes, now can you look at these eyes?
My eyes are the sun.

 
**Mata Hari:**
A woman with eyes of the sun&ndash;that is my name.
Now, spill it all out.

 
**King:**
Oh...

 
**Mash:**
...Whew, looks like the investigation will be complete.
Thank you, Mata Hari.

 
**Mata Hari:**
No problem. I'm glad to have been a help to you guys, Master.

 
**Mata Hari:**
Well, Master. While we're at it,
how about another drink before heading back?

 
**Mata Hari:**
Ah, no?
Oh, that's too bad. Hehehehehe...
