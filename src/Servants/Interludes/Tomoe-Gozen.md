# Tomoe Gozen
 
## My Heart Shall Never Forget That Rising Sun
 
**Mash:**
Okay, that's all for today's simulator training.
Great work, everyone!

 
**Tomoe Gozen:**
And to you, Lady Mash.

 
**Tomoe Gozen:**
That goes for all of you as well.
You all worked very hard today.

 
**Jack:**
Hehe. So we did good?

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
Oh yes, very good. I could see how hard you were working right from beginning to end.

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
Well of course. My mentor always said that a job done right is its own reward!

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
Anyway, now that we're done here, it's time for snacks, right? Then let's go to the cafeteria!

 
**Tomoe Gozen:**
Good idea. But aren't you forgetting something?

 
**Tomoe Gozen:**
What is it that Lady Nightingale always tells you to do after getting back from a simulation or Rayshift?

 
**Jack:**
Huh?

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
Um...

 
**Tomoe Gozen:**
Wash your hands with soap and water.
Go on, let me hear you say it!

 
**Jack & Lily:**
Wash our hands! With soap and water!

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
Oh yes, washing your hands is very important!

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
Uncle Emiya and Boudica would be very cross with us if we picked up a doughnut with dirty hands.

 
**Tomoe Gozen:**
Yes, I'm sure they would. So make sure you wash properly, and don't forget to scrub under your fingernails, okay?

 
**Children:**
'Kaaay.

 
**Tomoe Gozen:**
Very good. All right then, off to the washroom.
No dawdling.

 
**Children:**
'Kaaay!

 
**Mash:**
I'm impressed, Tomoe. There aren't many Heroic Spirits who are so good with children, not even in Chaldea.

 
**Mash:**
Do you have some sort of trick or technique?

 
**Tomoe Gozen:**
Oh no, it's nothing special.
I'm just used to dealing with children.

 
**Tomoe Gozen:**
Besides, the little ones here are so well-behaved that it's really no trouble at all.

 
**Tomoe Gozen:**
Even when they were playing around in the simulator, they never failed to respond to Master's commands.

 
**Tomoe Gozen:**
I hope you'll tell them what a wonderful job they did, Master.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You're right, I should.
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
You first, Tomoe. Thanks for all your help.
 
**Tomoe Gozen:**
Oh, no, I didn't mean me. I meant&ndash;

 
**Tomoe Gozen:**
Oh, right. You did say “first,” didn't you?
Thank you, Master. That's very kind of you.

 


---
 
**Mash:**
Okay, I'm going to sort through all this training data and go report it to Da Vinci.

 
**Mash:**
Please feel free to take the rest of the day off, Senpai.

 
**Mash:**
You've been training nonstop since the morning, and it's just as important to rest as it is to work hard.

 
**Mash:**
You could go relax in your room, or play something in the rec room... Whatever you'd like to do to relax.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Make sure you don't go burning yourself out either, Mash.
 
**Mash:**
Thank you, Senpai.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Okay then, let's meet up in the cafeteria once you're done.
 
**Mash:**
Are you sure? I won't be done until the evening...

 
**Mash:**
Oh! I didn't realize you were inviting me to dinner at first. Sounds good!

 


---
 
**Mash:**
All right then, see you later!

 
**Tomoe Gozen:**
...
...

 
**Tomoe Gozen:**
...Hmm.

 
**Tomoe Gozen:**
...Hmm, hmm!

 
**Tomoe Gozen:**
Now I get it!

 
**Tomoe Gozen:**
Master, Master. I hope I'm not being rude, but I couldn't help but notice how well you and Lady Mash get along.

 
**Tomoe Gozen:**
I think it's just wonderful.
It warms my heart to see it.

 
**Tomoe Gozen:**
So, um...on a related note, Master...

 
**Tomoe Gozen:**
I realize it is very improper of me to ask this of someone so young...

 
**Tomoe Gozen:**
...but, um, I couldn't help but wonder how many you left behind in your hometown?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
How many what?
 


---
 
**Tomoe Gozen:**
W-well...um...

 
**Tomoe Gozen:**
I speak of...s-suitors.

 
**Tomoe Gozen:**
Oh, but of course, I know very little of modern customs, so I won't be so crass as to ask if you are yet wed!

 
**Tomoe Gozen:**
At any rate, what is your answer? Naturally, you are still young, so I know there is every possibility that you have not yet had such experiences.

 
**Tomoe Gozen:**
But I have also heard from Lord Zhuge Liang that it is not uncommon for today's young people to engage in courtships at an early age, so I thought that you might be one of them.

 
**Tomoe Gozen:**
S-s-so how about it? Is there anyone, um,
special you left behind in your hometown?

 
**Tomoe Gozen:**
O-or are you still pure and unsullied?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
“Unsullied,” huh?

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
What do you mean by “unsullied”?
 


---
 
**Tomoe Gozen:**
O-oh, w-well, I-I just meant, um...

 
**Tomoe Gozen:**
I-I certainly have no intention of prying, but after seeing Lady Mash serve you so devotedly, well...

 
**Tomoe Gozen:**
...I simply couldn't help but wonder how it is she thinks of you.

 
**Tomoe Gozen:**
After all, Master, while you are essentially a general leading the charge in the battle for humanity, you were by no means born and raised in Chaldea.

 
**Tomoe Gozen:**
As such, I figured it was well within the realm of possibility that you might have family, friends, or suitors back in your homeland.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
“Suitors”?
 
**Tomoe Gozen:**
Oh, right. Nowadays, I believe they are called, um, “lovers”?

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
By “suitors,” I assume you mean “lovers”?
 
**Tomoe Gozen:**
Y-yes, that's right.
I believe that is what they are called nowadays...

 


---
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Nope. No way. No how. Nuh-uh. Negative.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Of course not!
 


---
 
**Tomoe Gozen:**
Oh!

 
**Tomoe Gozen:**
You're so skilled at commanding so many different Heroic Spirits that I was sure you must have a suitor or three waiting for you back home...

 
**Tomoe Gozen:**
But I suppose you really are too young for this sort of discussion after all!

 
**Tomoe Gozen:**
Oh gosh, oh gosh!
I-I-I'm so terribly sorry, Master!

 
**Tomoe Gozen:**
I should have known you would be more conscientious than that! Please forgive me for ever thinking otherwise!

 
**Tomoe Gozen:**
...
...

 
**Tomoe Gozen:**
...U-um, could I ask you one last thing just to make perfectly sure, Master?

 
**Tomoe Gozen:**
You, um, wouldn't happen to have any children back home, would you?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Definitely not.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Can't say I do, no.
 


---
 
**Tomoe Gozen:**
Right. Of course...

 
**Tomoe Gozen:**
It's just that, you get along with the childlike Heroic Spirits so well that I thought you might have had prior experience raising one... And since you are a general from modern times, I didn't think it was outside the realm of possibility.

 
**Tomoe Gozen:**
But I see now that I was being very foolish.
I hope you can forgive me...

 
**Tomoe Gozen:**
...
...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Hang on. Is this because you wanted to talk to a parent?
 
**Tomoe Gozen:**
...Y-yes, that's right.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I'm pretty sure there're some Heroic Spirits here who've been parents.
 
**Tomoe Gozen:**
...Yes, that's true.

 
**Tomoe Gozen:**
I've already learned a great deal from my discussions with Lord Tajima and Lady Marie.

 
**Tomoe Gozen:**
We may all be from different times and places, but thanks to them...

 
**Tomoe Gozen:**
...I know now that there are fleeting, precious things in this world that remain the same in any age.

 
**Tomoe Gozen:**
Which is exactly why I...

 


---
 
**Tomoe Gozen:**
I wanted to talk to someone who is raising a child right now. Not that I expect I could be of any help to them...

 
**Tomoe Gozen:**
I just...wanted to ask them something.

 
**Tomoe Gozen:**
Even a single question would have been enough...

 
**Tomoe Gozen:**
But no, I could never make such a selfish demand. Especially given the circumstances we are all facing at the moment.

 
**Tomoe Gozen:**
All right, Master, I will see you tomorrow. Please feel free to call on me if you wish to do any more training or tactical planning!

 
**Tomoe Gozen:**
As always, I, Tomoe Gozen, will be there to aid you.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Hold up.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Actually, I was hoping we could talk a little more.
 


---
 
**Tomoe Gozen:**
O-oh?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I was hoping you could tell me about your family, Tomoe.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
This seems like a good chance for you to finally tell me about your family.
 


---
 
**Tomoe Gozen:**
.........All right.

 
**Tomoe Gozen:**
Please watch your step, Master.

 
**Tomoe Gozen:**
We may only be in the simulator, but it is still all too easy to lose one's footing in the forest at night.

 
**Tomoe Gozen:**
Although the injuries we suffer here may go away once we return to reality, a Heroic Spirit still could never bear it if they were to let their Master come to harm.

 
**Tomoe Gozen:**
Here, this way.

 
**Tomoe Gozen:**
Will this area suffice?

 
**Tomoe Gozen:**
Thank you, Master. You are too kind to come all this way just to listen to me talk about myself.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Don't worry about it. I just thought this would be easier for you.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I just figured it'd be better to get away from the prying ears in the Command Room.
 


---
 
**Tomoe Gozen:**
...Very true.

 
**Tomoe Gozen:**
...
...

 
**Tomoe Gozen:**
Let's see, how much did I tell you about my family before...

 
**Tomoe Gozen:**
Well, I am Lord Yoshinaka's&ndash;

 
**Tomoe Gozen:**
...I am the daughter of Nakahara-no-Kanetoh, foster-father of Kiso Yoshinaka. As such, I knew Lord Yoshinaka from youth.

 
**Tomoe Gozen:**
I remember he and I got along far better than I ever did with my brothers, Kanemitsu and Kanehira.

 
**Tomoe Gozen:**
Well, I suppose I should say half brothers,
as we had different mothers.

 
**Tomoe Gozen:**
Now that I think of it, my mother's blood in my veins is most likely where my oni power comes from.

 
**Tomoe Gozen:**
Though I've also heard that some modern-day legends claim I was born when my mother was impregnated by the power of the dragon god residing in the Tomoe River's deep waters .

 
**Tomoe Gozen:**
Whichever it was, perhaps that is the reason why I never spent much time with my brothers.

 
**Tomoe Gozen:**
Instead, I spent most of my time in the Kiso Valley with Lord Komaoumaru&ndash;Lord Yoshinaka that is.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
So you and Yoshinaka were friends ever since childhood.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
So you were together pretty much your whole lives then.
 


---
 
**Tomoe Gozen:**
Yes, we were.

 
**Tomoe Gozen:**
Even when I became more onilike, and these monstrous horns started to poke out of my forehead...

 
**Tomoe Gozen:**
...Lord Yoshinaka was the only one who never batted an eye at it. All he did was tell me:

 
**Tomoe Gozen:**
“Now I see. So that is where your Monstrous Strength comes from. Then there is no need to hang your head in shame.”

 
**Tomoe Gozen:**
“You should be proud. With strength like that, you are more than worthy of being my right-hand woman.”

 
**Tomoe Gozen:**
...Right before he tipped his head back and gave a delightful, boisterous laugh.

 
**Tomoe Gozen:**
Now, let's see... This next story takes place after I had become one of Lord Yoshinaka's wives.

 
**Tomoe Gozen:**
There was a woman I talked to shortly before the Battle of Kurikara...

 
**Yamabuki Gozen:**
(Sigh) Oh, Lady Tomoe.
How can you be both so strong and so weak?

 
**Tomoe Gozen:**
...
...

 
**Tomoe Gozen:**
Am I...truly helping Lord Yoshinaka?

 
**Tomoe Gozen:**
As an archer, I cannot hold a candle to my brothers, the Kiso Elite Four. As a woman, you and Lady Fuyuhime are far more beautiful than I could ever hope to be...

 
**Tomoe Gozen:**
And as his wife, I have not yet even been able to provide him with a child...

 
**Tomoe Gozen:**
On top of all that, these protruding horns serve as a constant reminder of my inhuman nature...

 
**Tomoe Gozen:**
...
...

 
**Tomoe Gozen:**
So I cannot help but wonder if I will ever be able to accompany Lord Yoshinaka to the destination he seeks...

 
**Yamabuki Gozen:**
Come now, our dear Tomoe, you should know better than that. Don't let those horns stop you from holding your head high.

 
**Yamabuki Gozen:**
Both Lady Fuyuhime and I have every confidence in you. And need I remind you that I too have known you since we were both children, just as Lord Yoshinaka has?

 
**Yamabuki Gozen:**
We are all Lord Yoshinaka's wives. Ordinarily, that would likely mean we would be competing amongst ourselves for his favor.

 
**Yamabuki Gozen:**
And truth be told, Lady Fuyuhime and I dislike each other a great deal as a result of that.

 
**Yamabuki Gozen:**
But you, Tomoe...our dear Tomoe... You are different.

 
**Yamabuki Gozen:**
You are the only one of us who can fight. The only one who can stand by Lord Yoshinaka's side even on the battlefield.

 
**Yamabuki Gozen:**
While the rest of us can do little more than pray for his safe return, you have the power to actually protect him.

 
**Yamabuki Gozen:**
And what could be more fortunate than that?

 
**Yamabuki Gozen:**
So we are all counting on you to help Lord Yoshinaka in ways that we simply cannot.

 
**Yamabuki Gozen:**
No ordinary wife or concubine can be of help out on the field of battle, but you can be by Lord Yoshinaka's side wherever he goes.

 
**Yamabuki Gozen:**
As for your oni horns, so what!? Once you put on a matching headband, no other soldier will so much as look twice!

 
**Tomoe Gozen:**
Lady Yamabuki...!

 
**Tomoe Gozen:**
I... I had no idea you felt that way about me...

 
**Tomoe Gozen:**
...All right. I've made up my mind.

 
**Tomoe Gozen:**
I swear to you here and now that I will fight by Lord Yoshinaka's side on behalf of every woman who loves him!

 
**Tomoe Gozen:**
And should the worst come to pass, and he meets his end on the battlefield, I am prepared to be with him in his final moments on all of your behalfs as well!

 
**Yamabuki Gozen:**
 
...Tomoe.

 
**Tomoe Gozen:**
Yes!?

 
**Yamabuki Gozen:**
 
Don't you know better than to think about losing a battle before it's even begun!?

 
**Tomoe Gozen:**
Oh, r-right! I'm sorry!

 
**Tomoe Gozen:**
...We ended up winning the Battle of Kurikara by an overwhelming degree.

 
**Tomoe Gozen:**
Lord Yoshinaka fought magnificently against the Taira clan's massive army, and led us right into the city of Kyoto.

 
**Tomoe Gozen:**
...
...

 
**Tomoe Gozen:**
But unfortunately, things do not always go as planned. Once Lord Yoshinaka had finally gained the position of Seii-Taishogun...

 
**Tomoe Gozen:**
...he lost his life soon after when Minamoto-no-Yoritomo ordered Minamoto-no-Noriyori and Minamoto-no-Yoshitsune to kill him.

 
**Tomoe Gozen:**
And, I... I...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You weren't able to be there for him in his final moments.
 
**Tomoe Gozen:**
No... I wasn't.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
...
 
**Tomoe Gozen:**
...I was unable to be there for him in his final moments.

 


---
 
**Tomoe Gozen:**
I failed to keep the promise I had made to Lady Yamabuki.

 
**Tomoe Gozen:**
Before his death...Lord Yoshinaka told me to live.
To carry on no matter what.

 
**Tomoe Gozen:**
I only learned that there was a deeper meaning to his words later, when I discovered I was pregnant with his child.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You mean...

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Asahina Saburou Yoshihide?
 


---
 
**Tomoe Gozen:**
Yes. That was Yoshihide.

 
**Tomoe Gozen:**
Though I pretended I had had him with Lord Wada Yoshimori, I never had any doubt that he was actually Lord Yoshinaka's son.

 
**Tomoe Gozen:**
...Shortly after Yoshihide was born, I decided to raise him as a normal woman. And I did.

 
**Tomoe Gozen:**
By then, my oni horns had vanished from my forehead, and there was no sign left that I was anything other than human.

 
**Tomoe Gozen:**
Once Yoshihide was all grown up, I prayed for Lord Yoshinaka's soul to rest in peace and lived out the rest of my life as a normal human.

 
**Tomoe Gozen:**
Obviously, I had no idea about this until I became a Heroic Spirit, but I am told that even my corpse appeared to be perfectly ordinary.

 
**Tomoe Gozen:**
...
...

 
**Tomoe Gozen:**
You know, I always thought that I had lived my life by suppressing my oni urges, but now, I am not so sure.

 
**Tomoe Gozen:**
If I had been there for Lord Yoshinaka's final moments...

 
**Tomoe Gozen:**
...my grief and rage may well have ended up turning me into a true oni, one more apt to devour my son than raise him.

 
**Tomoe Gozen:**
And if that's true...that would mean Lord Yoshinaka saved me in more ways than one.

 
**Tomoe Gozen:**
Wait. What am I doing!?

 
**Tomoe Gozen:**
O-oh gosh, I'm so sorry, Master. I didn't mean to go on and on about Lord Yoshinaka like that!

 
**Tomoe Gozen:**
How strange... I had every intention of telling you about my family&ndash;especially Yoshihide!

 
**Tomoe Gozen:**
How strange... Where did I go wrong?

 
**Tomoe Gozen:**
D-does this mean I can't even mention Lord Yoshinaka without getting completely sidetracked!?

 
**Tomoe Gozen:**
U-um, perhaps I should start over at the beginning...

 
**Tomoe Gozen:**
But no, wait. Even back then, I was still good friends with Lord Komaoumaru, so&ndash;

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
It's okay. I got it.
 
**Tomoe Gozen:**
A-are you sure?

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
You still love Yoshinaka and Yoshihide even now, don't you?
 
**Tomoe Gozen:**
I...

 
**Tomoe Gozen:**
Yes! Yes, of course I do!

 


---
 
**Tomoe Gozen:**
Ahh, Master. [♂ Lord /♀️ Lady} Fujimaru. I wish Lord Yoshinaka and Yoshihide had had a chance to meet you.

 
**Tomoe Gozen:**
If they had...I am certain you would all become as close as family yourselves.

 
**Tomoe Gozen:**
After all&ndash;

 
**Tomoe Gozen:**
What's going on?

 
**F：Da Vinci:**
Hey guys! Sorry to interrupt, but I'm afraid I've got some bad news!

 
**F：Da Vinci:**
The idiot who was supposed to be monitoring the simulator decided to run a virus scan even though you guys were in there, and now it thinks you're malware that needs to be deleted!

 
**F：Da Vinci:**
And it's decided to do that by sending some exceptionally powerful monsters your way. They're sort of functioning as antivirus software.

 
**F：Da Vinci:**
We'll try to shut them down as soon as we can, but I'm afraid you'll have to hold out on your own in the meantime!

 
**G：Da Vinci:**
Hey guys! Sorry to interrupt, but I'm afraid I've got some bad news!

 
**G：Da Vinci:**

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Wow, I can't remember the last time we had a human error like this!
 
**Tomoe Gozen:**
Oh gosh, oh gosh. I guess there really is no such thing as a perfect system...

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Don't worry, we'll figure something out.
 
**Tomoe Gozen:**
Right you are, Master.

 


---
 
**Tomoe Gozen:**
Very well then. However long it takes to resolve this situation, be it half a day or a full twenty-four hours...

 
**Tomoe Gozen:**
...I, Tomoe Gozen, shall see that no harm befalls my Master whatsoever!

 
**Tomoe Gozen:**
Have at you, foul beasts!

 
**--BATTLE--:**
 
**Tomoe Gozen:**
There!

 
**Tomoe Gozen:**
...
...

 
**Tomoe Gozen:**
...I don't see any more enemies. There certainly were a lot of them, but it would seem that was the last of them.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Looks that way. Nice job.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
You did great, Tomoe.
 


---
 
**Tomoe Gozen:**
...I do not deserve your kind words, Master. You would never have been in danger if I hadn't asked you to come here.

 
**Tomoe Gozen:**
For that, I am terribly sorry.
Still, now that all is said and done...

 
**Tomoe Gozen:**
I think...I do feel a little better!

 
**Tomoe Gozen:**
Thank you so much for listening to me, my new Master.

 
**Tomoe Gozen:**
I... Strictly speaking, I am not actually Tomoe Gozen.
I am simply a shadow of her cast by humanity.

 
**Tomoe Gozen:**
Even this body you see here now is from the time when she spent her days on the battlefield.

 
**Tomoe Gozen:**
While I do still have precious memories of the life she lived, my duty now is to keep you safe.

 
**Tomoe Gozen:**
There is nothing more important to me now than ensuring you are able to live out your days in health and peace!

 
**Tomoe Gozen:**
As such, I doubt there is anything to be gained from looking back at my past like this, so...please, just forget this whole thing ever happened.

 
**Tomoe Gozen:**
From here on, I promise I will do my very best to never subject you to this shameful side of me again!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Not at all. I'm glad you told me about this.
 
**Tomoe Gozen:**
...Thank you, Master.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
...So what were you gonna say before we were interrupted?
 
**Tomoe Gozen:**
Oh, yes. Well, um, after all...

 
**Tomoe Gozen:**
...
...

 
**Tomoe Gozen:**
...After all, you also fight for something bigger than yourself.

 
**Tomoe Gozen:**
And in that sense...I see a great many similarities between you and Lord Yoshinaka.

 
**Tomoe Gozen:**
I truly believe you have the same inner spark as he did. One that shines with the same light and promise as the rays of the morning sun.

 


---
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
The morning sun, huh...?
 
**Tomoe Gozen:**
Absolutely!

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I think you might be giving me way too much credit.
 
**Tomoe Gozen:**
Not at all, Master! I assure you, I meant every word!

 


---
 
**Mash:**
There you are!

 
**Mash:**
Thank goodness you two are all right!
We finally managed to shut down the virus scan!

 
**Tomoe Gozen:**
Thank you, Lady Mash!

 
**Tomoe Gozen:**
Not to worry, [♂ Lord /♀️ Lady} Fujimaru is safe and sound!

 
**Tomoe Gozen:**
Wait right there!
I shall bring [♂ him /♀️ her} back in no time at all!
