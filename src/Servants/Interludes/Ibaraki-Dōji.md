# Ibaraki Douji

## Fire and Alcohol and Oni! Oh, My!

**Mash:**
We've arrived. Rayshift successful.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Actually, why Rayshift to this era now?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Even if the Singularity has been resolved, it's still a handful to prove your existence in that era...

 
**Mash:**
Yes...I understand that.

 
**Mash:**
Especially now, when we need to rest as much as we can before the decisive battle against the King of Mages.

 
**Mash:**
I also wanted Master to get some rest back in Chaldea, but...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
It's not like I had a choice. I was forced.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
It's hard to say no to Ibaraki...


---
 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
Hahaha! Rest!? Like I'd let you rest! Cry!
Cry while you tell me what a terrifying oni I am!

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
People should cry in terror every time they see an oni like me! There's no peace or rest when I'm around!

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
...But now that I think of it...

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
If I were you, every encounter I had with Shuten would only end up with memories of bitterness and agony.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
The way she teases me... Yeah...

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
True. So true.


---
 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
Hehehe. I see, I see.
Yup, I think that a lo&ndash;erm... Never mind.

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
Anyway. The point is, Shuten is amazing. Her cruelty and evil are beyond any regular oni, and I need to follow that example!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Well, do it in moderation.
So, Ibaraki, why'd you want to come here?

 
**Mash:**
...It's not just to stop Master from resting, is it?

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
Hmph. Nope. There's somewhere I wanna go.

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
We've got a lot of walking to do.
I hope you have your hiking shoes on.

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
...Actually, doesn't matter.
If you get tired or slow me down, I'll just drag you along!

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
And then you'll scream and cry and tell me how cruel and awful I am! Heehee... Just watch, and be amazed!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
It's really not a safe place for a stroll...
So why do you want to go there?

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
...Something smells. I can't leave it be.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Smells...?

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
Eh, you'll see when we get there. I'll take the lead. Follow me.

 
**Mash:**
...Ibaraki's hyped up.
Let's just follow her, Master.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Maybe she found a tree that grows sweets...

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Maybe she found a chocolate fountain...


---
 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
A-as if! There's no such thing! Right? RIGHT!?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Actually, Uruk has a secret candy tree orchard.


---
 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
 
WHAT!? Wh-where is it? Tell me! We're gonna stop by on our way! E-even if it's not on our way! WE WILL GO!

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
Hmmm... Just thinking about sweets makes my mouth water. Those are good. Such flavors are not possible within the oni realm.

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
And even I know how preciously rare they are.
I know that I mustn't have more than one per day.

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
Butbutbut...! If candy grows on trees...it'll never run out! And I can eat as much as I want!!!

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
Kwahahaha! Master, yes! You've given me the best news of my life! Candy! Unliiimited caaandy!!!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Just kidding.


---
 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
...

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
...

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
YOU MONSTER!!!

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
Hm. This is kinda homey. Reminds me of Mt. Ooe. Everything in these forests is evil.

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
And obviously I'd be the boss of all this.
Not a lotta things out there as evil as a blood-crazed oni!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
I'm just going to say again that I never expected we'd come across an actual oni.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
I wasn't even sure we'd be able to communicate properly...

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Not least because of how incredibly violent you were in Rashomon the first time we ran into you...

 
**Dr. Roman:**
But since your Madness Enhancement seems to be mixed with your oni nature, you seem to be one of those Berserkers that can converse normally.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
I'm glad we were able to get along,
unexpected as that was.

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
An oni getting along with humans...

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
Cut the nonsense, onmyouji. I am an oni. That's a human. There's no getting along for us.

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
This human is...y-yeah...totally terrified of me!

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
The only relationship we have is the kind between a frightening tyrant and a whimpering, terrified kid!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
(It's so cute when she tries to be scary.) Terrifying. Truly.


---
 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
Yes, yes! I knew it! Of course it is!

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
That dull, warm gaze and your dumb face twitching in a terrified half-smile is all the proof I need!

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
And onmyouji... Just because I'm an oni doesn't mean you can look at me like a circus freak. I'll eat you.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
I'm not an onmyouji. We're called doctors.
And, well...sorry.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
I see now that I was being insensitive.
I'm sorry I upset you, Ibaraki.

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
Hmph. Whatever.

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
So are oni really that rare in this era? If you went to Mt. Ooe back in the day, there were tons around.

 
**Mash:**
You mentioned that mountain earlier...
Is that your homeland, Ibaraki-Douji?

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
Homeland? I guess you could call it that.

 
**Mash:**
What kind of place was it?
You said it was similar to here...

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
It's a mountain where the oni I led gathered.
We even built a palace there.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
An oni palace... Sounds incredible...

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
Hm. Without that, the oni would be no different than mere beasts.

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
I won't tell them to live like humans, but we need our pride. That's why we need food, clothes, and shelter.

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
...I guess thinking like that is what made me stand out from all the other oni.

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
But that's my problem.
My time spent as an oni was glorious!

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
I led mighty oni troops and we rampaged through the capital in the Heian period. There was Kuma-Douji, Torakuma-Douji, Hoshiguma, Kanekuma...

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
And my bestest number one companion and loving blood sister...Shuten.

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
We raided and pillaged human cities all the time. When we were done, we went back to the mountain to rest.

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
And when we wanted more, we took it!
Just thinking of all the fun we had makes my heart race!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
I see. Your story is...disturbing, but it sounds like you were happy.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
You rounded up a bunch of freewheeling oni and made them into a gang.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Oni are powerful, but alone they can be killed by a group of humans. That's why you decided to band together.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Yep, yep. No mean feat. You had the gift of foresight. Might even have been wasted on an oni, really.

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
...Not really. I just acted according to my mother's teachings.

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
The only one who kept to her own principles, lived in luxury, and ruled as an evil, cruel oni was Shuten.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Ah, Shuten-Douji. She is certainly extraordinary. Honestly, calling her an oni might be selling her short.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Hm? Speaking of which, where is she?
She's not with you this time?

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
No need. I don't wanna bother her with this.
...This way. Let's get this over with before she wakes up.

 
**Mash:**
Oh, okay.
Let's go, Master.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Maybe it's my imagination...but I'm starting to get a bad feeling about this...

 
**???:**
...Ah...ahhhhhh...

 
**Mash:**
...What's that...!?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
It reads almost like a Servant...or not?
Is it some sort of remnant...?

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
...Ha. That scent... I smell it. Is it you?

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
You smell of oni, female warrior!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
!?


---
 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
My current form limits my ability to detect things a bit, but I'm sure you know very well yourself.

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
There was supposedly a Heroic Spirit who was summoned to this land and later defeated.

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
Judging from the state of the battlefield...
I'd say there were flames. Flames like mine.

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
With flames intense enough to scorch your own body, you incinerated the enemies around you. ...I see that kind of intensity and desire. Am I wrong?

 
**Mash:**
A female warrior...who died in Uruk?
We did not meet her...

 
**Mash:**
But I have some information on her.

 
**Mash:**
A Servant named Tomoe Gozen sacrificed herself to defeat the Demonic Beasts' commander, Girtablilu.

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
Ah. So that means those are her charred remains.

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
Of course they are. I'm sure you know, but we oni are the epitome of sloppy.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Are you saying Tomoe Gozen was an oni!?

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
Based on her scent, not exactly.
Maybe she was descended from oni.

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
Though I'm sure she has more direct lineage than that Fuuma kid.

 
**Tomoe Gozen?:**
Ah...ahhhhhh...!
AHHHHHH!!!

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
She has no sense or will. Just mindless violence.

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
Or perhaps... She absorbed some power from that, umm... Girta...waffle? Maybe that's why she's losing control.

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
Not that I can blame her for losing her mind after being incinerated along with her enemy.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
What a delicious-sounding enemy...

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Tastiest enemy ever.


---
 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
Kwahahaha, in name only!
It certainly doesn't SMELL delicious.

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
That thing's just an imitation oni.
A writhing, burnt husk.

 
**Mash:**
Ibaraki-Douji... You knew about this...?

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
No. I just wanted to get rid of the source of its stench before Shuten noticed it.

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
There was no way for me to recognize the smell.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Get rid of it...? If Tomoe Gozen is descended from oni, don't you feel some kinship with her?

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
Maybe if it was the real thing, but that's just a remnant. Looks like there's other stuff mixed in, too.

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
There's no need to question its existence.
Human, what would you do in my place?

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
If the mostly dead remnants that smelled of your kind were mixed with other, unknown things...

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
If all they did was writhe around and lash out violently...

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
...what would you do?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Sounds like a zombie movie to me...

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I've seen this movie. I know how it ends.


---
 
**Mash:**
...I see.

 
**Mash:**
When you put it that way, Ibaraki's approach seems...understandable.

 
**Mash:**
I obviously do not know what an oni scent&ndash;

 
**Tomoe Gozen?:**
Gu...ah...ahhh!!!

 
**Mash:**
Well, I know it's something we can't just leave here.

 
**Mash:**
Even if she was a great Servant who stopped the invasion of the Demonic Front and we are indebted to her...

 
**Mash:**
...all this remnant does is pose a danger to an era about to be restored.

 
**Tomoe Gozen?:**
![berserk1](https://i.imgur.com/XAqlQYL.png)!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Oh no. It looks like you've got her attention!
She doesn't seem at all friendly!

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
Kukuku... So you noticed my scent.
Gonna try and eat me and make me a part of you, eh?

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
Well as a proper oni, lemme tell you:
You're pitiful! Pathetic! Wretched!

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
Know your place. I'm the one who's gonna eat you!
My name is Ibaraki-Douji!

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
I'm the leader of the oni of Mt. Ooe! The one who drowned the Heian capital in blood and terror!


**--BATTLE--:**

**Tomoe Gozen?:**
Ibara...ki... Yes... You...returned... How wonderful...

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
...?

 
**Tomoe Gozen?:**
Please...laugh...at me... I'm lower...than an oni...
I... I couldn't...acknowledge you...

 
**Tomoe Gozen?:**
I...stomped all over...Girtablilu's heart...
He said I...was beautiful...

 
**Tomoe Gozen?:**
But... But I told him...that it was impossible...
Impossible for an oni to...understand humans...

 
**Dr. Roman:**
...Threat response...completely gone.
Good work.

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
What the hell? Did she know me?

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
...Never mind.
I knew it. It was neither fun nor delicious.

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
I'm just glad that it didn't cause trouble for Shuten.

 
**Mash:**
Master... Look how sad she looks...

 
**Mash:**
She's just standing there staring at the spot where the enemy fell...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Well, she was talking about her comrades...


---
 
**Mash:**
You're right. She talks big, but they were both oni.
She probably has a lot on her mind.

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
...If only you were more than a remnant...

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
If you are truly descended from oni, come to Mt. Ooe.
I am the leader of the oni. I will not refuse you.

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
Maybe, if I feel like it, I'd share a human liver with you... No...I wouldn't like that, but I'd share wonderful foreign sweets or two to you...


**--ARROW--:**

**Dr. Roman:**
...Whew. Who knew there'd still be irregularities in an era even after we fixed the Singularity?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Maybe it's because of the concentration of magical energy in Uruk. But no matter what, you managed to take care of it. Come back with your heads held high&ndash;

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
No.

 
**Mash:**
...?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Huh?

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
I said “no,” onmyouji.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
I'm a doctor, not an onmyouji! Ugh, never mind that.
Are you saying that you're not coming back yet?

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
Indeed.

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
There are other places to go.
Accompany me, Master.

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
Refuse, and I'll drag you.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
The poison of selfishness somethingsomething...
 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
Eh? Poison? No thanks. You know, though...Shuten would even drink up poisoned alcohol if it involves THAT man.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
(...Oh! Right!) How, uh, evil...of you...?
 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
Hm? What did you just say? Hey, what did you say???
I couldn't hear you! Say it again!

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
Bwahahaha! I knew it! I'm such a great oni, I even scare myself! Good! Cry more! Scream more!

 
**Mash:**
Master... What a wonderful way to handle her.
You really are kind!

 


---
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Well, I guess you did lead with your nose...?
That helped us out.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
If there's another place you need to go to, I'm sure you have your reasons.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
I'd rather not think about it, but I can't guarantee there isn't another remnant like before.

 
**Mash:**
Yes. Even with the Singularity resolved, we do not know for sure what would happen if we left it alone.

 
**Mash:**
Besides...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Besides?


---
 
**Mash:**
Ibaraki...has always been kind of charming, even cute...

 
**Mash:**
Like when she butts heads with Raikou and Kintoki, or when she's getting bullied by Shuten, or when she's eating sweets.

 
**Mash:**
But back there...when she acted like a proper leader of the oni... I was impressed.

 
**Mash:**
Seeing that really cast her in a new light. I think I want to see more of this side of her. Or...something like that...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...Right.


---
 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
Hey, what are you two babbling about?
If we're going, let's get a move on!

 
**Mash:**
Wow...

 
**Mash:**
I'm not sure if this is from correcting the Singularity, or whether this is all thanks to the survivors...

 
**Mash:**
But the city is very lively now!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Not quite so much as when you first arrived,
but it is still impressive.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Glad to hear it.
So is your next destination somewhere around here?

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
Yes, but we need to walk a bit more.
Still...

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
Hm. What a lively city.
If Shuten were here, she'd be thrilled.

 
**Mash:**
Yes. Uruk is King Gilgamesh's city!
I'm sure it's rowdy in a lot of ways.

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
Right. Being lively and bountiful is good.
That makes the pillaging more fun!

 
**Mash:**
...Um, Ibaraki?

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
I'm kidding. This isn't the Heian capital where I ran amok. Besides, I don't have Shuten nor my minions.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
(...Does that mean she would run amok if they WERE here?)

 
**Mash:**
A-anyway...

 
**Mash:**
I see that you really do have strong feelings for Shuten. You mention her frequently.

 
**Mash:**
I can tell you are always mindful of her.

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
Shuten and I spent a lot of time together, like siblings.

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
Among all the oni on Mt. Ooe, she was the only one I saw as an equal, not an underling.

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
And not just in terms of rank.
I have a lot of respect for the way she lived her life.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Hm. Would you listen to my story in all seriousness?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
In many of the stories about oni, Shuten-Douji is said to have been the leader of the oni in Mt. Ooe...

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
And there's a reason for that. Shuten was flashier, stronger, and more dangerous than all the rest of us.

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
Even when we attacked the capital, she was the one who stood out.

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
She seeks pleasure, after all.

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
She lived to drink, pillage, kill, eat...
Just watching her was fascinating.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
(For humans, I'm sure watching her was utterly horrifying...)

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
Anyway. We're almost there. This way.

 
**Mash:**
Yes. But how come we're going through so many alleyways...

 
**Mash:**
...Oh! We're in front of the ziggurat!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
I can't believe this. The Sacred Temple watches over Uruk. There's no way ghost would be lurking around here.

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
Shut up. I smell something. This way.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
It's hard for me to believe that a threat would be hiding under HIS watchful eye, in his kingdom...

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
...?

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
You guys have got it all wrong.
What I'm looking for is the treasury.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
...

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Whaaa...!?

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
Don't make me say “shut up” again.
I'll rip out your throat.

 
**Mash:**
I thought this was just more of what we talked about earlier!

 
**Mash:**
Like some sense of duty as the leader of the oni to clean up oni remnants... Something like that...

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
...? Isn't this exactly the sort of thing the leader of the oni should do? Oni loot and pillage.

 
**Mash:**
B-but you just said you wouldn't attack this city...

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
Not the city itself, obviously. I wouldn't be able to do that on my own. But I never said I wouldn't steal some treasure.

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
Besides, I want to bring a souvenir back for Shuten.

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
We're talking about the king's treasury, so I'm sure there's some incredible treasure here that outshines whatever's in the Heian capital.

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
Wine Shuten would enjoy... A hairpin that would look good on her... A kimono that would accentuate her beauty...

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
And this is a grand treasure vault. Some super delicious sweets that I've never even imagined must be stored here as well.

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
...Th-those are totally a gift for Shuten! I just...need to taste-test them in case they're poisoned... Yeah...

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
Kuhahaha...

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
I wonder if I can carry them all out...?

 
**???:**
I thought I smelled something unusual, so I came to see for myself. What a bold bunch of thieves.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
He's here!!!
Hm? But...

 
**Mash:**
That's right, Doctor. King Gilgamesh is...

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Wh-who's that?? Are you human? Or a ghost?
A Servant!? Um...?

 
**Gilgamesh:**
Fool!
This is MY city, MY castle, and MY treasury!

 
**Gilgamesh:**
Whether I am on my throne or in the underworld, OF COURSE I would come to see the mongrels who dare attempt to rob it.

 
**Gilgamesh:**
It would be far stranger if I did not!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
We shouldn't think too much of this guy!

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
This king is no different than the other ones...


---
 
**Mash:**
A-anyway, allow us to explain ourselves, King of Heroes. There's a good rea&ndash;

 
**Gilgamesh:**
Silence! You have nothing to say that I need to hear!
You all need to learn your place!

 
**Gilgamesh:**
...Although, I did see what you did with Tomoe.

 
**Gilgamesh:**
Because of that, I will excuse some of your behavior.
You may wander my city. You may sneak into my palace...

 
**Gilgamesh:**
...but I WILL NOT show an ounce of mercy to those who dare to raid my treasury!

 
**Gilgamesh:**
This is beyond disrespect! This is treason! Anarchy!
You will learn what it is to earn my wrath!

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
A golden man... Gah, so garish. And he's so intense... That's no ordinary man!

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
...Well, hm... He does seem kinda familiar...
Or, well, he makes me a little fidgety.

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
It's this weird sort of discomfort...like when I need to sit down in front of Mother because I'm in for a scolding...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Oh yeah, King Gilgamesh summoned Banana...

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Oh yeah. Didn't Ushiwakamaru scare her off?


---
 
**Gilgamesh:**
I have not forgotten your desertion in the face of the enemy. That, also, is not excused by your good deed in ending Tomoe Gozen.

 
**Gilgamesh:**
You may not technically be the one I summoned, but you shall take her punishment regardless.

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
 
Unnngh...unnngh... I don't know what you're talking about! I feel like I do, but I don't!

 
**Gilgamesh:**
Just like Chaldea's Master, what you know or don't know does not matter!

 
**Gilgamesh:**
I shall be the judge, jury, and executioner for your crimes in trying to steal from my treasury!

 
**Gilgamesh:**
Brace yourselves, fools! If you want to live, fight with all your power, or suffer my wrath!

 
**Mash:**
This...is no good!
Let's hang in there as best we can, Master!


**--BATTLE--:**

**Gilgamesh:**
Fwahahahahaha! I'm just warming up!
I shall even put on my armor for you!

 
**Gilgamesh:**
Burn my regal, glorious presence into your minds!

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
Why you... This is why I hate golden guys!
They're flashy, blinding, and they just piss me off!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
You do know that your main color is gold, right?

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
It is in good taste! Mother picked it out!
It doesn't just sparkle all the time like that thing!

 
**Gilgamesh:**
You're quite tenacious for a mongrel.
As a reward for your spirit, I will call it a day.

 
**Gilgamesh:**
Rejoice. I shall show you the contents of the treasury that you so coveted.

 
**Gilgamesh:**
Gate of Babylon!

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
This is the end!
I have no other choice!

 
**Mash:**
...Ibaraki-Douji!?
Why are you covering me and Master&ndash;

 
**Mash:**
...!?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
We're, uh, really high up...!

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Waaaaaahhh!?
 


---
 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
Close your mouth tight or you'll bite your tongue!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
It's no use. Even though Ibaraki-Douji could jump over the gate of Rashomon, a point-blank hit there will be fatal!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
...There's...no attack!?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Could this be...Ibaraki-Douji's “Disengage” skill that lets her avoid or flee from enemy attacks?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
The legend where she was the only one who managed to flee from Raikou's four oni-slayers... The legend of her escaping even after Watanabe-no-Tsuna took off her arm is&ndash;

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
Shut up, onmyouji! How dare you mention that hateful Minamoto! It's making me wanna KILL!

 
**Mash:**
I agree this is no time to be chatting!
Doctor, please prepare for Rayshift!


**--SECTION BREAK--:**
 
**Gilgamesh:**
Hmph. Mongrel.

 
**???:**
Shall we go after them, King Gilgamesh?

 
**Gilgamesh:**
No. Leave them be.
She is only doing what is in her nature.

 
**Gilgamesh:**
Never pursuing dignity or honor... She wouldn't hesitate to turn her back on all that mattered if it meant she would survive.

 
**Gilgamesh:**
How ugly...how pitiful...how beautiful that is.

 
**Gilgamesh:**
...I remember now. That's why I gave up on her. There was no point forcing her to be my dog. A beast will live and die as a beast. That is all it can do.

 
**???:**
Yes, but...what about the crime of attempting to loot the king's treasury? Shall that be overlooked?

 
**Gilgamesh:**
I told you: no more than a beast.

 
**Gilgamesh:**
She was simply drawn to the scent of my treasures as a wild dog to meat. No more than a stray lurking near the front door.

 
**Gilgamesh:**
There's no need to chase such a creature to its lair for the kill. Of course, should she return, I won't hesitate to crush her.


**--SECTION BREAK--:**
 
**Shuten-Douji:**
(Yawn) ...I am so booored...

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
Hm? Ibaraki. Welcome back. Where have you been?

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
...

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
???

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
I'm sorry, Shuten. I meant to bring back a souvenir for you... But I couldn't...

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
Well, I don't even know where you've been.
Don't worry about it.

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
But more importantly, I was bored because you left me alone.

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
My sweetie wasn't here, and when I tried to pick on the brat, he ran away as usual.

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
And Raikou didn't even come and try to take my head off...

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
If you're talking about a souvenir, you coming back is the best present, Ibaraki.

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
!!!

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
I sense some large battle about to begin.

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
The best way to lighten the mood is drinking.
Well, I drink all the time, but keep me company, Ibaraki.

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
Oh. Okay. Yeah... Okay.

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
...O-of course...!

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
So where were you all this time?

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
Ku... Kuhahaha. I may not have a souvenir, but I have stories to tell! Listen to all of my glorious feats!

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
I did what only a true oni could ever do! Master cried like a baby! The people trembled in fear...in the hundreds...no, thousands!

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
...? (Sniff, sniff) Hm, I smell an unfamiliar oni on you.

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
Don't tell me... You abandoned poor, lonely Shuten to go have fun with another oni?

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
How could you... I'm... I'm going to cry...

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
N-n-n-n-n-no! Absolutely not! It's not what you think! L-listen, Shuten! I can explain!

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
... (Sob, sob)

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
Sh-Shuteeeeeen!!!

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
(Ah, Ibaraki is truly the best entertainment to go along with my alcohol. I never get tired of her...)
