# Edmond Dantès

## Nightmare; or, the Call of Love and Hate

**Narration:**
...I can't see anything.

 
**Narration:**
Black. Dark. Lightless. There was only a sinking sensation, like I'd fallen into somewhere very, very deep.

 
**Narration:**
Or is there nothing there to see? I don't know.
I can't even tell whether my eyes are open.

 
**Narration:**
Where am I? I don't know. Am I standing or sitting?

 
**Narration:**
I try to speak. My lips don't move. My tongue doesn't move. No sound comes from my throat.

 
**Narration:**
Ah. Am I in a bad situation?

 
**Narration:**
My body does feel heavy...

 
**???:**
Looks like you have fallen deep.

 
**???:**
But yes. It's probably why it was you of all people.

 
**???:**
Welcome, Fujimaru. Welcome to the deep place where all sorts of carcasses fall, sink, and remain.

 
**???:**
...Hmph. What's with that look?
Those lost puppy eyes are a waste of time with me.

 
**???:**
Of course, time is meaningless.
At least in a place like this.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...Are you by chance...?
 


---
 
**???:**
Do you know me?
No. It can't be. You know nothing.

 
**???:**
Don't you get it, Master?
Fujimaru.

 
**???:**
I have come from a place far beyond love and hatred. And so, I am somewhat...different from the version of me you know.

 
**???:**
...All right. They'll be here soon.

 
**???:**
You must leave this place. I am the one who shall burn away the remnants of darkness festering here.

 
**???:**
My flames shall scorch your self and soul, and I cannot guarantee your safety.

 
**???:**
Forgive me. You do not belong in a place like this.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I don't want to.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I don't know what's going on, but I can't leave you alone.
 


---
 
**???:**
...I see. Then keep up, and mind the flames.


**--BATTLE--:**

**Edmond Dantès:**
...What are you doing here, Berserker?

 
**Nightingale:**
I'll ask you the same question: what are you doing in Master's room? It is the middle of the night.

 
**Nightingale:**
Sleep is necessary to maintain the health of a human body. I advise you to return to your own room to rest, Mister Edmond Dantès.

 
**Edmond Dantès:**
I am a Servant. You are as well.

 
**Nightingale:**
Yes.

 
**Edmond Dantès:**
...

 
**Nightingale:**
I'm speaking of Master. Our conversation will interrupt [♂ his /♀️ her} sleep cycle. Though [♂ he /♀️ she} may be sleeping peacefully right now...

 
**Edmond Dantès:**
Peacefully, is that right?

 
**Nightingale:**
...Something the matter, sir?

 
**Edmond Dantès:**
No. As long as [♂ he /♀️ she} is sleeping, that's fine.

 
**Edmond Dantès:**
I was worried some residual effect might remain in [♂ his /♀️ her} consciousness... No, it's nothing. Forget about it.

 
**Nightingale:**
Mister Dantès.
May I ask a question?

 
**Edmond Dantès:**
If you must.

 
**Nightingale:**
It's been bothering me for a while, but it seems an emergency operation will be necessary.

 
**Nightingale:**
I must take action before it is too late. Leave it to me. I shall pursue the most effective treatment for the injured area.

 
**Edmond Dantès:**
...Master is not injured.
As you pointed out, I hear peaceful breathing.

 
**Nightingale:**
No. Wrong, Sir.

 
**Edmond Dantès:**
...

 
**Nightingale:**
I am talking about you. Your mental state is injured.
If it's the surgical removal of the affected area you require, leave it to me.

 
**Edmond Dantès:**
...What?

 
**Edmond Dantès:**
Mercédès. I know of your wicked ways, but to go that far seems excessive, even to you?

 
**Nightingale:**
Just like that. That statement. You may not realize it, but your outbursts suggest that you're mistaking me for someone else.

 
**Nightingale:**
Swift, decisive action must be taken. Yes. You have uttered troubling nonsense about the sleeping Master.

 
**Edmond Dantès:**
...Wait.

 
**Nightingale:**
No. Measures will be taken.

 
**Edmond Dantès:**
Don't you dare come at me with a scalpel in one hand and a gun in the other. At least hold the scalpel in your dominant hand. No, that's not what I meant to say!

 
**Edmond Dantès:**
Why are you watching Master sleep, anyway?
You must have sensed some sort of abnormality.

 
**Edmond Dantès:**
I don't know if it's instinct, or if you sensed something in [♂ his /♀️ her} magical energy, but you are correct. You've read the situation right.

 
**Edmond Dantès:**
Master is in contact with many Servants, so how did this happen to [♂ his /♀️ her} mental state?

 
**Nightingale:**
Stop talking nonsense.

 
**Edmond Dantès:**
...Mercédès.

 
**Nightingale:**
Like I said, my name is not Mercédès.
You are suffering from an affliction of the mind.

 
**Nightingale:**
It appears that you do not see me as a Servant.
You call me Berserker, yet still call me Mercédès.

 
**Nightingale:**
I am not her. I am not the woman whom you call by that name.

 
**Edmond Dantès:**
Of course not. Your Spirit Origin doesn't have the memories of those seven days.

 
**Nightingale:**
Yet...whenever I hear that name, strangely...

 
**Nightingale:**
It makes me long for something far away...
Something that I no longer possess.

 
**Nightingale:**
However, as I am still not this Mercédès, there is nothing for it but to take the appropriate measures. Thus...

 
**Nightingale:**
...I shall disinfect that mental state of yours.

 
**Edmond Dantès:**
...

 
**Nightingale:**
Oh. He has fled.

 
**Nightingale:**
...Unbelievable. Next time I see him, I must be sure to tend to him.


**--ARROW--:**

**Mash:**
...A dream where Nightingale was arguing with someone?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Something like that...

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I don't remember it all that clearly...


---
 


---
 
**Mash:**
What a strange dream.
I am no expert in interpreting dreams...

 
**Mash:**
But if you would like, shall I try accessing Chaldea's database?

 
**Mash:**
Even I can do that much.
It's not like we're booting up Sheba or Trismegistus.

 
**Helena:**
Oh? Are you trying to perform oneiromancy?
Leave it to me!

 
**Helena:**
Since ancient times, as far back as the Age of Gods, humanity has tried to interpret the meaning of their dreams.

 
**Helena:**
The most famous of dream interpreter of your modern time would be Sigmund Freud...

 
**Helena:**
But my dream interpretation is one of a kind! Hee hee.
I call it&ndash;

 
**Edison:**
Thrilling DC dream interpretation!

 
**Nikola Tesla:**
Exciting AC dream interpretation!

 
**Edison:**
Huh...!? If you shoot AC through your brain, it'll be a “Scanners” kind of head explosion catastrophe!

 
**Nikola Tesla:**
Haha, you know nothing, furball! AC is harmless to the body! It's even healthy if used in the right amount!

 
**Nikola Tesla:**
It can do anything! For example, it can observe how neurons communicate in detail!

 
**Nikola Tesla:**
Let us decipher what is inside Fujimaru's head once and for all!

 
**Nikola Tesla:**
For example, what is Master's favorite dish?
And of course, what is [♂ his /♀️ her} favorite AC!

 
**Edison:**
Argh! You mean things like what kind of clothes Master likes! And of course, what is [♂ his /♀️ her} favorite DC!

 
**Nikola Tesla:**
...What kind of DC...?
You misspoke, Edison. You're making no sense.

 
**Edison:**
 
Look who's talking!!!!!!

 
**Mash:**
Th-they're fighting again... Those two are really going at it. It's such a childish fight! And they've already come to blows!

 
**Mash:**
But to be honest, observing the brain is a bit much...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Sounds interesting.
 
**Mash:**
S-Senpai! I know it sounds interesting...

 
**Mash:**
But those two may really lay bare everything in your mind. If that happens...

 
**Mash:**
I have a feeling it would do more harm than good...

 
**Mash:**
Things like your favorite food wouldn't be an issue...
But certain other types of information that might be revealed...

 
**Mash:**
...They would definitely cause problems!

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
No, I'm not down for invasion of my privacy.
 
**Mash:**
That's right! It's no good!
It's not right to look into other people's heads!

 


---
 
**Helena:**
Well said, Mash. You're quite right.

 
**Helena:**
Things like this must be done in secret. It was my fault for bringing it up in a public place like this.

 
**Helena:**
Let's put both Lemurian oneiromancy and the dream reading I learned directly from the Mahatmas on hold for today. Yep.

 
**Helena:**
I'm sorry.
And... You two bratty geniuses!

 
**Gentleman & Lion:**
 
Y-yes, ma'am!

 
**Helena:**
Don't start fighting as soon as you see each other! If you have that much energy to spare, go to the simulator!

 
**Helena:**
Twenty consecutive Soul Eaters and Spriggans!
Work out your extra energy that way!

 
**Gentleman & Lion:**
Wh-whaaaaat!?

 
**Helena:**
What did you say!? Be polite!

 
**Gentleman & Lion:**
 
Yes, ma'am!

 
**Mash:**
...I can't believe what I just saw. That...they really went through twenty consecutive battles!

 
**Mash:**
Those two looked really determined.
It was quite an inspiring sight to see.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Electric Lion's Proud Infinite Battle.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Electric Gentleman's Brave Infinite Battle.


---
 
**Mash:**
Infinite... It really was intense.

 
**Mash:**
Senpai, did you just stumble a bit?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Oh, did I?

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I might've gotten dizzy watching the infinite battle.
 


---
 
**Amakusa Shirou:**
Oh, Master. Mash.
What a wonderful morning.

 
**Mash:**
Good morning, Amakusa.
Oh! And Jeanne d'Arc Alter Santa Lily.

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
Good morning! Um, if my name's too hard to say, you can call me Lily, or Alter. Even Jeanne!

 
**Mash:**
Well, then I will call you Jeanne Alter.
Good morning once again.

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
Yes... Good morning!

 
**Amakusa Shirou:**
...

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
Mentor, is something wrong?

 
**Amakusa Shirou:**
The smiles on your faces were simply dazzling.
As warm as the sun itself rising into the sky.

 
**Amakusa Shirou:**
It is truly wonderful, and fills my heart.

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
Y-you think so? Um, did I just get praised?

 
**Amakusa Shirou:**
Yes. Of course.

 
**Amakusa Shirou:**
...By the way, Master.
Has anything new happened?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Nothing really...
 
**Amakusa Shirou:**
Is that so? Well, then, never mind.

 
**Amakusa Shirou:**
As I'd expect of the avenging demon who advanced his own mentality to that state. I'm relieved to see that he is doing his job properly.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I think I had a dream about Nightingale.
 
**Amakusa Shirou:**
...A dream about someone arguing with Nightingale?
I see, so that's what's going on.

 
**Amakusa Shirou:**
She, too, is perceptive, in a way...
No. Never mind. Apologies, I have said too much.

 


---
 
**Mash:**
...Amakusa?

 
**Amakusa Shirou:**
No, nothing. I was only talking to myself.

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
...?

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
Mentor, what are you talking about?
I am so confused.

 
**Amakusa Shirou:**
This is rather a complicated matter.
Well, if I had to cut it down to a single phrase...

 
**Amakusa Shirou:**
...It's just a dream. The sort that someone like you, who's been through so much this past year, would have.

 
**???:**
...You've sunk down here again.

 
**???:**
Unbelievable. You really are a curious Master.

 
**???:**
You could have had a peaceful dream, or lain in a dreamless slumber.

 
**???:**
But instead you come here, to this awful place.
I suggest you stop.

 
**???:**
Do you understand?
This place is too dangerous.

 
**???:**
This darkness is indeed a part of your dream, but one normally would not see this. It is not a place where you should linger.

 
**???:**
The me here is quite different than the me you know.
I may not always be so hospitable.

 
**???:**
Begone. And forget this place.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You don't look any different to me.
 
**???:**
...Ha. You make me laugh! You don't change a bit, no matter where you are, Master!

 
**???:**
No different, huh?

 
**???:**
Right. That's correct. I may be different from me, but we are in many ways the same person.

 
**???:**
I am the Avenger who existed during those seven days, and I am also the Servant who fights along with you.

 
**???:**
Both of them are essentially me.

 
**???:**
But, to be precise... The me here, in this place, is slightly different.

 
**???:**
I show my true ability in these darkest depths. I am one who looks into your soul, that shines brightly like the flames of hell.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
You're not going to smoke?
 
**???:**
...Ah, yes.

 
**???:**
I am afraid I lack a light.
Or, have I handed you one before?

 
**???:**
Then, please. My dark flame of vengeance would simply char my precious cigar.

 
**???:**
(Puff) ...You're impertinent. Even in the black depths of a dream, you try to amuse me.

 


---
 
**???:**
...Tonight is the night to finish this.

 
**???:**
This is the cacophony of noise that has accumulated inside of you in consequence of your connection with so many heroic Spirits.

 
**???:**
They are remnants of dreams, shadows, and illusions. Dark things piled up deep within your soul. In a way, this is your... trash heap.

 
**???:**
The regrets, resentments, and shattered wishes of the myriad enemies you've defeated. Yes, that's right... everything from love to hatred.

 
**???:**
There is only one thing I can say to you now: begone.

 
**???:**
This is my job. It is not something you should see.

 
**???:**
Through your dreams, you have connected with the memories of many Heroic Spirits, and accomplished much, have you not? That is enough.

 
**???:**
There's no need for you to take responsibility for even the leftover emotions of corpses.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...
 


---
 
**???:**
...But, just in case. Fujimaru.

 
**???:**
If you wish from the bottom of your heart...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I don't want you to fight alone!

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I can't leave you alone!
 


---
 
**???:**
Ha...

 
**???:**
Hahahahahahahahahaha!
Fine! Then do not fall behind!

 
**???:**
Mere droplets, discarded and decayed! Ones that could not even reach anger, but merely sunk and festered.

 
**???:**
I shall consume them with my flames!

 
**???:**
My prey is the very carcasses of the phantoms you fought within the memories of the Heroic Spirits that your soul watches over!

 
**???:**
Hahaha. Yes, let their form be made clear this time!

 
**???:**
And mine as well!

 
**Edmond Dantès:**
...Come, let us eradicate those that wander!

 
**Edmond Dantès:**
Let's go, Master.
We're going to take that thing beyond love and hatred!


**--BATTLE--:**

**Nightingale:**
...We meet again, sir.

 
**Edmond Dantès:**
Indeed.

 
**Nightingale:**
Master's room is up ahead. Do you have business there? It is already late, and interrupting one's slumber is bad for their health.

 
**Edmond Dantès:**
No. I... Well...
I suppose I'm just enjoying a midnight stroll.

 
**Edmond Dantès:**
What about you, Berserker? The Mage King's threat is no more. Why are you so on edge?

 
**Nightingale:**
I am not on edge. I am simply looking for a chance to disinfect your brain.

 
**Nightingale:**
Your mental state is injured.
Your mental state is polluted, abnormal.

 
**Nightingale:**
...It's twisted. Injured. Wounded.

 
**Edmond Dantès:**
...Heh heh heh.

 
**Nightingale:**
You are...laughing?

 
**Edmond Dantès:**
Of course I'm laughing! My mental state is far, far removed from any normal person's!

 
**Edmond Dantès:**
I am the vengeful demon! I am one who ceased to be human ages ago! I am the Count of Monte Cristo!

 
**Edmond Dantès:**
...But I have no need of treatment from you. I am what I am, and I have incarnated as myself in this 21st century.

 
**Edmond Dantès:**
As long as Master desires it, the Count of Monte Cristo shall exist. As long as [♂ he /♀️ she} continues to fight, I shall lend my assistance.

 
**Edmond Dantès:**
To put it in your terms, the “injury” to my mental state is one that cannot be cured.

 
**Edmond Dantès:**
It is precisely the fact that my mind is beyond love and hatred, beyond madness, that certain things become possible for me... It may not happen often, but it does happen.

 
**Nightingale:**
You are not making sense.
Please speak clearly and concisely.

 
**Edmond Dantès:**
Treatment is unnecessary.
Just leave me be, Mercédès.

 
**Edmond Dantès:**
And do not come near me. Your straightforward ways are similar to Fujimaru's.

 
**Edmond Dantès:**
And it is quite blinding...to me.

 
**Nightingale:**
...?

 
**Edmond Dantès:**
Go check on Master in the morning.
[♂ His /♀️ Her} mind and body may be somewhat exhausted.

 
**Edmond Dantès:**
...After all, [♂ he /♀️ she} will have had a nightmare.
