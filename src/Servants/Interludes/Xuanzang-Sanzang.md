# Xuanzang Sanzang

## It's Just...I'm not Lost!

**Sanzang:**
...

 
**Sanzang:**
...

 
**Sanzang:**
...

 
**Sanzang:**
...!

 
**Sanzang:**
...(Glare)

 
**Sanzang:**
...Camping is wonderful!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Camping out in the night forest is nice.
 
**Sanzang:**
Ugh...sorry. I'm really sorry.
But I'm relieved to hear you say that...

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Yep...that's right...
 
**Sanzang:**
Ungh...that's right...

 


---
 
**Sanzang:**
Sorrysorrysorry! I heard we were going to investigate a tiny Singularity...

 
**Sanzang:**
So I thought this was going to be super easy even without Touta or Nitocris. But, well...um...

 
**Sanzang:**
We wandered...and wandered some more... Next thing we know, we're waaay beyond where we're supposed to be...

 
**Sanzang:**
And now we're camping out in the woods... I'm sorry.

 
**Sanzang:**
Even though we have a clear destination, we took so many detours... Even I know that this is bad...

 
**Sanzang:**
It's just, from the moment I start a journey,
I can never take the straight path...

 
**Sanzang:**
It's not always like that when I'm not alone.
The normal me does have proper disciples, after all.

 
**Sanzang:**
But when I'm alone, I just can't help myself...
I am beyond hopeless...

 
**Sanzang:**
Um...

 
**Sanzang:**
C-camping out is wonder...ful.
The stars are so pretty!

 
**Sanzang:**
And now that we started a fire, all the bugs are out and attracted by it...it's like we're attracting attention because we're so popular!

 
**Sanzang:**
And eating under the night sky is so nice!
(Munch, munch...)

 
**Sanzang:**
Oh, I have plenty of rice balls. It's a Sanzang rule to carry two days' worth of food on a one-day trip.

 
**Sanzang:**
Now come on. Don't hold back. Eat up.
I even have fresh water from that river over there!

 
**Sanzang:**
Since we're in a lush forest, we were able to forage up plenty of nuts and mysterious fruits!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Let's try a taste...

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Mysterious fruit may not be a good idea...
 


---
 
**Sanzang:**
Oh. Would you rather have fish or meat?
Yeah...you're right...

 
**Sanzang:**
...Ugh! I'm so sorry for being so inconsiderate.
But since I'm a Buddhist monk, all killing is forbidden.

 
**Sanzang:**
Oh, but I won't stop you from hunting. I won't go in and stop other hunters from doing their thing, either.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Rice balls and nuts are fine for tonight.
 
**Sanzang:**
You don't have to force yourself.
But...thanks.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I'm gonna try the mysterious fruit!
 
**Sanzang:**
Be my guest! Hee hee!

 


---
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Anyway...

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
We're totally lost...
 


---
 
**Sanzang:**
Ugh...I am beyond sorry...

 
**Sanzang:**
It was because I kept powering forward.
I know...I get it...it's totally my fault!

 
**Sanzang:**
It's always been like this...Wukong, Bajie,
and Wujing have all scolded me about this.

 
**Sanzang:**
(Sigh) I just can't seem to break this habit.
Maybe I can't get better because I'm not trying to fix it.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Who knows?

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
You definitely can't get better if you don't try!
 


---
 
**Sanzang:**
You're right. Absolutely right. Ungh.

 
**Sanzang:**
We've lost communication with Chaldea,
and I'm sure Mash is worried sick.

 
**Sanzang:**
...Ugh...

 
**Sanzang:**
It's morning!

 
**Sanzang:**
Then let's head on!
GO! WEST!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Not to the west!

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
We need to go north, though.
 


---
 
**Sanzang:**
...

 
**Sanzang:**
Yes. That's...
That is what Da Vinci's instructions said.

 
**Sanzang:**
But trust me. Listen.

 
**Sanzang:**
You and I...and humans in general don't journey on rationality alone.

 
**Sanzang:**
Yesterday, I forced you to walk so much that your legs got all sore.

 
**Sanzang:**
Aaand yes, I forced you to stay outdoors overnight, with all those bugs around.

 
**Sanzang:**
I apologize for that.
I shouldn't mix exploration with training.

 
**Sanzang:**
I don't want to cause trouble for Master.
I don't want you to think of me as a stubborn teacher.

 
**Sanzang:**
But...even so...I just can't ignore my instincts!

 
**Sanzang:**
So, once this is all done,
I'm going to apologize to you SO much!

 
**Sanzang:**
But right now, I want you to just follow me!
I'm going west!

 
**Sanzang:**
I need to go.
Because...I hear a voice!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
A voice...?

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
What does that mean?
 


---
 
**Sanzang:**
No need to explain...cuz I don't get it either!
Anyway, let's GO! GO WEST!

 
**Village Man:**
Aaahhh!!! A monster...!
It's the monster that's said to come from the north!

 
**Village Woman:**
Help! Help! My child is still in the house...oh no...the monster's coming...!

 
**Sanzang:**
Hold it right there!

 
**Sanzang:**
We made it! Just in time!
No...we might actually be too late.

 
**Sanzang:**
But this village hasn't been destroyed yet! Good!
All that's left is for someone to get rid of this monster!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Sanzang!

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Did you know about this?
 


---
 
**Sanzang:**
Talk later!

 
**Sanzang:**
Right now, we gotta stop this monster!
Hey, you four-legged beast! Don't eat the villagers!

 
**Sanzang:**
The Buddha once said:
if there were to&ndash;

 
**Sanzang:**
...H-hey! It's a really inspirational quote!

 
**Sanzang:**
I guess I have no choice since you're not gonna listen, and you're trying to eat a child!

 
**Sanzang:**
All living things feel hunger, yes... So eating isn't evil, but I can't just let this happen!

 
**Sanzang:**
If its actions are beastly desires that surpass natural desires, I'll just have to teach it a lesson!

 
**Sanzang:**
My palm is an impregnable wall...
I will never forsake those in pain...

 
**Sanzang:**
People who seek my help, the children who shed their tears... Now come on, Fujimaru!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Roger that, my teacher!

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Don't worry about magical energy! Just fight!
 


---
 
**Sanzang:**
GOGO! Enforcing Buddhist law...I mean,
let's kick its butt!


**--BATTLE--:**

**Sanzang:**
Swift Divine Retribution!

 
**Sanzang:**
Phew...

 
**Sanzang:**
As there are laws in Buddhist teachings, so too are there laws in this world, and passions may lead to enlightenment!

 
**Sanzang:**
Now is probably not your time to stop hurting others and gain salvation, but I believe that time will one day come for you.

 
**Sanzang:**
So for now, goodbye. I'm sorry.

 
**Village Man:**
Oh! Oh...!
The monster has fallen! Are we saved!?

 
**Village Woman:**
Oh my son! My baby! I'm so relieved!
Come here, my son!

 
**Sanzang:**
It was strong!
But we managed to beat it!

 
**Sanzang:**
Villagers, listen!
Please let those who got hurt or weakened rest!

 
**Sanzang:**
Take them to an open area, like a temple or church! Give them water and blankets! Also medicine if you have any!

 
**Sanzang:**
Go find them all! Right now, it doesn't matter if they are rich or poor!

 
**Sanzang:**
Do all you can to aid the wounded! With your help,
I will get as many people back in shape as I can!

 
**Sanzang:**
I don't have healing skills or Noble Phantasms,
but I do have some knowledge in making medicinal soup.

 
**Village Woman:**
We haven't quite grasped the situation, but if you are a traveling monk, and got rid of this monster for us...

 
**Village Man:**
You must have come from a distant land, yet you still saved us.

 
**Sanzang:**
Of course I did! I demonstrated the protection of the Buddha to everyone!

 
**Sanzang:**
So save those in need! I will continue to wander around to do so myself as well!

 
**Mash:**
...Senpai!

 
**Mash:**
What a relief!
We've restored communication!

 
**Mash:**
The location of the abnormality's source has changed. Unbelievably, it moved to a different place at high speed right after you Rayshifted...

 
**Mash:**
And when I tried to contact you...

 
**Da Vinci:**
We had trouble getting a connection. We panicked on our end, but maybe that worry was for naught.

 
**Da Vinci:**
I'm just glad we didn't completely lose you guys. Anyway...

 
**Da Vinci:**
You guys never cease to amaze. I was watching as you beat the crap out of the source of the abnormality.

 
**Da Vinci:**
Was it a coincidence? Or is it Sanzang's special ability? Did she manage to detect where the abnormality was located?

 
**Sanzang:**
Eh? What's this?

 
**Sanzang:**
Hm? Is it a special Servant ability of mine?
No way. Nope, that's not it.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Really?

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
So you were really just lost?
 


---
 
**Sanzang:**
Heh...hee hee...um...

 
**Sanzang:**
Yes. That's right. I always get myself lost...even when I don't intend to...

 
**Sanzang:**
Whether that be in a Singularity or when I'm wandering around in the simulator...it's all the same.

 
**Sanzang:**
I'm always in search of something.
Especially when I'm traveling alone.

 
**Sanzang:**
There is always someone who needs help.
Definitely. After all, the world is BEYOND big.

 
**Sanzang:**
I'd like to help as many people as possible, as much as possible.

 
**Sanzang:**
Though I can't do it while I'm sleeping or eating, but while I'm still up and running, I'd like to help everyone I meet!

 
**Sanzang:**
That's why I walk, and I'll keep walking!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Sanzang...
 


---
 
**Sanzang:**
But, I'm sorry.

 
**Sanzang:**
I roped you into this...I'm sorry to have made you worry when we were alone in the woods at night.

 
**Sanzang:**
You have many roles, and you are a busy person. You're the last person I should drag into my whimsical stuff.

 
**Sanzang:**
This time around...yep!
I'm reflecting back on my actions!

 
**Sanzang:**
I won't do it again. Next time, it's not going to be the two of us. I've learned my lesson!

 
**Sanzang:**
That's why we should go with everyone next time!
I'm sure we won't get lost then!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Just the two of us camping out can be nice, too.
 
**Sanzang:**
Eh?

 
**Sanzang:**
Eh, eh??? Really?

 
**Sanzang:**
But...didn't you have a hard time sleeping because we were infested with bugs?

 
**Sanzang:**
...Don't tell me you don't mind sleeping in uncomfortable, outdoorsy places?

 
**Sanzang:**
If Master insists, I don't mind, either.
...Really? Are you sure?

 
**Sanzang:**
...You're serious?

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Let's go camping together again!
 
**Sanzang:**
Yes! Let's bring more people along so we can assign them to be the lookout or make them do the cooking.

 
**Sanzang:**
Fufufu! How exciting! Now that that's decided,
I need to prepare for the next Rayshift!

 


---
 
**C：Village Child:**
Miss?
We gathered all the injured people in the church.

 
**Sanzang:**
Thank you. I'll be right there!

 
**Sanzang:**
Come on, Fujimaru. We'll discuss what we'll do later. But first, let's save the village!

 
**Sanzang:**
GO! WEST!

 
**Mash:**
U-um...the church is actually to the south, Sanzang!

 
**Sanzang:**
...Waah...
