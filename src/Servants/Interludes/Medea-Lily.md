# Medea Lily

## Close Friend of a Witch

**Medea Lily:**
Let me introduce myself once again, Master. I'm Medea, and my class is Caster.

 
**Medea Lily:**
I have been devoted to practicing magecraft as head priestess of a shrine under Hecate, Goddess of the moon.

 
**Medea Lily:**
So, you can relax when I'm around, and treat me like a housekeeper who can use magic.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Wow... So she's that Medea? Man, how did she turn into a devil like that?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
That's rude, Roman.
 
**Mash:**
I agree.
Stop talking, Doctor.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
That's why girls don't like you, Doctor.
 
**Mash:**
I agree. Now I understand why you are into net idols.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
I'm telling you, me not being popular with girls has nothing to do with me being a fan of Magi☆Mari!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Apologize to all the idol fans!

 


---
 
**Mash:**
Anyhow, Medea... Well, Lily.
Why did you call Senpai out to a place like this?

 
**Medea Lily:**
Well, actually, while I was “praying” for everyone's health, I detected a terrible aura on this island.

 
**Medea Lily:**
It'd be catastrophic if left unchecked... No, even worse, I can't bear to watch a crack form in their friendship...

 
**Medea Lily:**
When I thought that, Fujimaru's face came to mind. With a beautiful, gleaming smile♡

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Um... You mean, you want Fujimaru to mediate a fight?

 
**Medea Lily:**
Yes♡ I'd be happy if Master can persuade them with some virtue.

 
**Mash:**
...Speaking of which, I can hear the sounds of swords clashing coming from the woods.

 
**Mash:**
Senpai, I have a bad feeling about it... Let's go check it out.

 
**Medea Lily:**
Hehe, you are such a worrywart, Mash.
There's not even a teaspoonful of danger.

 
**Jeanne:**
I can't overlook your undisciplined behavior any more!

 
**Jeanne:**
Even my patience, which is as wide and firm as Carcassonne, has just been worn out!

 
**Astolfo:**
That's actually my line, you sulky saint! I don't care if you say, “be temperate,” or “be restrained”!

 
**Astolfo:**
You're not convincing at all, saying that with your flabby figure!

 
**Astolfo:**
You were trying so hard with that high-school girl image, I thought I'd laugh to death! I'll seek compensation on behalf of all Servants!

 
**Jeanne:**
Wh-What's wrong with high-school girls&mdash;!?

 
**Astolfo:**
And Jeanne Alter? What kind of joke is that&mdash;!?

 
**Medea Lily:**
Oh dear.

 
**Mash:**
I guess you can call this... Hell?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Okay folks, let's pretend we didn't see that and go back. This is a case we must not get involved in.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I totally agree.
 
**Medea Lily:**
Oh no Fujimaru, I thought I could count on you!

 
**Mash:**
...Senpai, let's try and help out. It's also scary to see Lily crying.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
You think I can just walk away?
 
**Medea Lily:**
Fujimaru! Yes, I knew you would help me! I believe in you!

 


---
 
**Dr. Roman:**
...All right then.
Go ahead, Fujimaru.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Stop fighting!

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Yes, that Alter was questionable!
 


---
 
**Jeanne:**
Are you siding with Astolfo? You are, aren't you? Pervert! Go to hell!

 
**Jeanne:**
You somehow look familiar to me, but I'll show you no mercy if you intend to get in my way!

 
**Jeanne:**
Come, messengers of the saint, winds of discipline! Gather under my flag and swear absolute obedience to me!

 
**Wyvern:**
Grrr. Help m&ndash;, grrr!

 
**Astolfo:**
Ugh! (←SHOOK)

 
**Jeanne:**
See, even I can do something as trivial as commanding wyverns!

 
**Jeanne:**
I was just hiding that until I got angry because once I do this, I feel like I'll lose something more important than my image!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Hey, isn't she actually Alter!? Wait, we can talk it out! Let's just talk!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
If anything, I'm totally on Team Jeanne!

 
**Jeanne:**
No more excuses, no apologies accepted! Come on! Get them Team Jeanne! Punish these rude people!

 
**Wyvern:**
Grrr. You're mea&ndash;, grrr!


**--BATTLE--:**

**Jeanne:**
Oh, no... My followers were easily defeated!

 
**Astolfo:**
Hmph, of course. They were merely fans who succumbed to the influence of that flag!

 
**Astolfo:**
It's my turn now!
Guys, it's time to come out!

 
**Jeanne:**
Nyahaaa!? (SHOOK)

 
**Dr. Roman:**
An army of horses&mdash;!?

 
**Astolfo:**
See? Those are my allies who I brainwashed with the horn's power!

 
**Astolfo:**
Now, brace yourself, fake saint! How dare you get a high school girl version before me! I must kill you now!

 
**Mash:**
Oh no, it's going to turn into another battle! Master, please do something!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Stop fighting!

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
That miniskirt is questionable!
 


---
 
**Astolfo:**
Speaking of which, who are you guys anyway? Whatever. I don't care, I'll take you all out together!

 
**Astolfo:**
My rationality has evaporated away!
I'll deal with the complicated stuff after I win!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
This one is just as terrible!
Be careful, Fujimaru!


**--BATTLE--:**

**Mash:**
Huff, huff... You two, please calm down... We are strangers who just happened to be passing by...

 
**Jeanne:**
Hmm, although I hope more than Astolfo's rationality would evaporate, that annoying pink hair is still a respectable knight...

 
**Jeanne:**
To be able to defeat an army led by someone like that...

 
**Astolfo:**
Unbelievable! Jeanne may be slow physically AND mentally, but she's still a sub-heroine who is my rival...

 
**Astolfo:**
To be able to defeat an army like that...

 
**Mash:**
Um, they actually get along, don't they?

 
**Jeanne:**
Now that it's come to this. Let's team up, Astolfo! Come on!

 
**Astolfo:**
Of course, we'll defeat our enemies together! We'll show them our outstanding combination!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Okay, we've reached a conclusion! I've had enough. Fujimaru, take them both down!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Bring the judgment of reasoning upon those two Berserkers!


**--BATTLE--:**

**Jeanne & Astolfo:**
Noooooo!

 
**Mash:**
Target defeated. However, the issue has not been resolved yet.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Yeah, it's going from bad to worse. I guess they can be really violent when snapped&mdash;

 
**Medea Lily:**
No need to worry. You can leave this to me. Let me start by taking out my dagger...

 
**Medea Lily:**
Hm, around here? Or maybe here?
Here we go, Pain Breaker!

 
**Mash:**
Medea!?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Wh-Wh-Wh-What just happened!? Did you really stab a Noble Phantasm into an unconscious Heroic Spirit who couldn't resist!?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Let's pretend we didn't see it.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
...It was an awful incident...
 


---
 
**Jeanne:**
Uh... Huh? Where is this... There's someone on top of me...

 
**Jeanne:**
Astolfo!? How did you get that terrible bump on your head!?

 
**Jeanne:**
Who did that to you!?

 
**Mash:**
...Well, that's Jea&ndash;

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Shh! Don't tell her, Mash. You didn't see any bruise caused by that flag. Got it?

 
**Astolfo:**
Uh... Huh!? Where is this... Is someone under me...

 
**Astolfo:**
Jeanne! How did you get those cuts? It's like someone kept targeting your chest!

 
**Astolfo:**
Who did that to you!?

 
**Mash:**
Well, I'm saying that was As&ndash;

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Silence is gold, Mash.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
...There was no awful incident...
 


---
 
**Medea Lily:**
Excellent. It appears they fought over trivial matters, but they are back to normal now.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
...I see. I now remember Medea Lily's alignment is the opposite of Princess Medea's.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
So her Noble Phantasm is also the direct opposite to that of the treacherous witch. Her Noble Phantasm resolves conflicts.

 
**Jeanne:**
At any rate... Here you go. I'm relieved to see you have no other injuries, Astolfo.

 
**Jeanne:**
By the way, you promised you'd take me on a trip above the sky. Is your hippogriff still around?

 
**Astolfo:**
Of course, Jeanne. You weigh as much as you look, right? Then, it should have no issues flying with you aboard!

 
**Jeanne:**
Sounds fun. I'm sure your hippogriff will provide quite a&mdash;

 
**Jeanne:**
Oh. Hi, Fujimaru.
And...sniff-sniff.

 
**Jeanne:**
Is this sweet smell... honey?

 
**Mash:**
Yes, there's been a terribly delicious scent in the air since a little while ago.

 
**Medea Lily:**
Indeed, I had the time to make some pancakes.

 
**Medea Lily:**
I hope you'll forget terrible things and enjoy your happy afternoon with these.

 
**Jeanne:**
That's very nice. Somehow I'm really hungry.
...I wonder if I exercised or something...

 
**Astolfo:**
Wow, they're delicious! I love these pancakes! Hey, Jeanne, you should try them!

 
**Jeanne:**
Yes, let me try some... Oh, wow! A Noble Phantasm level of sweetness?

 
**Mash:**
They quickly became a pair of girls happily enjoying sweets together...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Friendship is beautiful.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Another pancake, please.
 


---
 
**Medea Lily:**
Hehehe.
This is all thanks to your help.

 
**Medea Lily:**
Thank you so much for handling my crazy request. I hope I continue to have your support, Master.

 
**Mash:**
Well, you have extraordinary skills.
You are a master of settling quarrels.

 
**Medea Lily:**
Yes, I am.
Because I'm a friendly witch♡


## Pancakes of Happiness

**Medea Lily:**
Well, it should be around here...

 
**Medea Lily:**
Oh, please wait a minute Master!
Let me scout around first.

 
**Mash:**
(Sigh) We're really here, Senpai.
We can no longer turn back.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Ah, I wonder what kind of blood ritual we're going to witness. Fujimaru's courage will be tested...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Hahaha, you two are overreacting.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Are you two still against it?
 


---
 
**Mash:**
It's not that I'm against it, it's just a headache...
Remember what happened an hour ago, Senpai.

 
**Medea Lily:**
♪♪♪

 
**Da Vinci:**
You're in a good mood as usual, Medea. I heard you settled a fight between the King of Heroes and the King of Conquerors.

 
**Da Vinci:**
Stopping a serious fight between those two is not something an average Heroic Spirit can do.

 
**Da Vinci:**
What's your secret to reconciliation?
Curses don't work for them, I assume.

 
**Medea Lily:**
Oh, they don't fight because they hate each other.

 
**Medea Lily:**
They just want to throw their opinions at each other.
So, I found an acceptable middle ground...

 
**Medea Lily:**
...and offered pancakes to them at the end.
Pancakes can be really handy at times.

 
**Da Vinci:**
O-Oh, really? Were there cakes back in your era?

 
**Medea Lily:**
I learned about them after I was summoned to the present age.

 
**Medea Lily:**
I found something to get into other than magecraft, and people are really enjoying them. I am very happy.

 
**Da Vinci:**
(I see. We can't go up against that. Even dragons would stop fighting when faced with such a happy aura of hers...)

 
**Medea Lily:**
Oh, but... I have recently come across a problem.
The food stockpile in Chaldea is, well...

 
**Da Vinci:**
Oh, right. We have food for a year, but none can be used towards sweets.

 
**Da Vinci:**
Medea, can't you do anything about it with your magecraft?

 
**Medea Lily:**
Well, if I Rayshift somewhere, I can create as many ingredients as I want with alchemy...

 
**Medea Lily:**
But when I return to Chaldea, I can only bring back whatever I can carry.

 
**Medea Lily:**
Even going through the space-time gate, I can barely carry enough for Fujimaru and Mash.

 
**Medea Lily:**
I'm afraid I can only bring back enough ingredients for one pancake. Oh!

 
**Da Vinci:**
What is it? Did something inspire you?

 
**Medea Lily:**
Yes! I just had a wonderful idea!
This is probably all thanks to the genius Da Vinci!

 
**Medea Lily:**
If you can carry only one pancake, you just need to make that one pancake edible forever!

 
**Medea Lily:**
Yes, how about we obtain the magical factor of a Demon God Pillar, an ingredient that regenerates even after countless destruction!

 
**Da Vinci:**
Excuse me?

 
**Medea Lily:**
Oh, I must tell Fujimaru right away!
We should go hunt a Demon God Pillar together!

 
**Mash:**
...And that's how you gave in to Lily who desperately begged you to go hunting for a Demon God Pillar with her.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
I didn't know Medea was naturally an airhead...

 
**Dr. Roman:**
I guess reality hit her after Jason was so terrible to her...

 
**Medea Lily:**
Everyone, I've found it! The residual magical energy of a Demon God Pillar!

 
**Medea Lily:**
Now, I'll use this as catalyst to fish for another Demon God Pillar. There are 72 of them, so I'm sure it's okay just to take one.

 
**Mash:**
You make it sound like a Demon God Pillar is tonight's dinner...

 
**Medea Lily:**
Now I shall make a summoning circle.
Maple honey... vanilla cream...

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Even the spell chants sound sweet for that witch!

 
**Medea Lily:**
Custard bell, whipped!

 
**Medea Lily:**
Allez cuis... I mean, I summon thee! Thou born of the abyss, rise from the ashes of evil and answer my call!

 
**Demon:**
CHOOOOOCOOOOLAAAATE!

 
**Medea Lily:**
I-I'm sorry, Master!
I failed, it's just a normal demon!

 
**Mash:**
It's probably because you cast the wrong spell.
It's because you said, “Allez cuisine” and such.

 
**Medea Lily:**
Don't point it out, Mash. I regret what I've done! For now, let's send them back!


**--BATTLE--:**

**Medea Lily:**
Oh, what a surprise. Is everyone all right?

 
**Mash:**
Yes, barely. I couldn't bear to be defeated by demons summoned that easily...

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Wow, I see that Mash is finally starting to feel pride as a Servant! That's a good thing!

 
**Mash:**
Well, I just wouldn't want to disappoint the Heroic Spirit who lets me use his power.

 
**Medea Lily:**
Mash's right. Those were powerful spirits but not quite enough. They are perfect catalysts for a curse, but that's not why we're here today.

 
**Medea Lily:**
I shall pull myself together and try again...
Maple honey... Vanilla cream...

 
**Medea Lily:**
Custard bell, whipped! I summon thee! Thou born of the abyss, rise from the ashes of evil and answer my call!

 
**E：???:**
Who calleth me? Who dares summon me using the fragments of my kindred?

 
**Mash:**
Whoa...It really showed up!
I had no idea how outstanding you were, Lily!

 
**B：Medea:**
Yes, yes, it is I! I'm Medea, top pupil of Goddess Hecate, and I summoned you!

 
**E：???:**
Hm. So you are involved with the Divine Spirits.
Then, I shall allow myself to be summoned by you.

 
**E：???:**
I am Haagenti, one of the 72 Demon Gods.
I turn water into wealth, and wealth into water.

 
**Demon God Pillar Haagenti:**
Hope of the Goddess. State your wish. Extermination of mankind? Decline of mankind? Or enslavement of mankind?

 
**Demon God Pillar Haagenti:**
State your evil wish. State your lustful desire.
Provide me a curse that is unbearable to listen to!

 
**Medea Lily:**
Okay! I wish to defeat you so I can take your magical factor!

 
**Medea Lily:**
You're going to be my cooking ingredient!

 
**Demon God Pillar Haagenti:**
Hm. Good, good, words full of curses on manki...
Um, pardon?

 
**Medea Lily:**
All right, everyone. It's time to show our true power! Let's do our best for the sake of pancakes!


**--BATTLE--:**

**Medea Lily:**
Yes! We destroyed the Spirit Core of the Demon God Pillar. Now we just need to transform all this magical energy!

 
**Demon God Pillar Haagenti:**
Ohhh... Ohhhhhhh!
This... this... is impossible!

 
**Medea Lily:**
Shrink, shrink! Shrink like a handful of flour bouncing in a bowl...

 
**Demon God Pillar Haagenti:**
Gaaaaaahh! Gaaaaaahh!

 
**Medea Lily:**
Pat, pat, maple pat... One scoopful, shrink small like a strawberry...

 
**Medea Lily:**
I did it! Cooking is complete! Now I can make the pancake of my dreams, Master!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
This was your dream?

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
That Demon God Pillar is the ingredient... right?
 


---
 
**Medea Lily:**
Yes, so?

 
**Medea Lily:**
The magical element has been churned, filtered, and refined to the limit, so it's no longer what it was originally.

 
**Medea Lily:**
Oh! Did you want to eat a Demon God Pillar-flavored cake? I-I'm sorry, I didn't realize!

 
**Medea Lily:**
I-I'll summon another pillar right away! Aww, the connection is almost gone. Can I make it in time?

 
**Mash:**
N-No, we don't need another Demon God Pillar!
I want to eat your pancakes!

 
**Medea Lily:**
Oh. That's good to know I just need to cook them as usual.

 
**Medea Lily:**
Okay then, it'll take me a little time. Please look forward to my pancakes, Fujimaru.

 
**Medea Lily:**
I'll deliver the best pancakes ever as an expression of my gratitude♡

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Poof. She disappeared into thin air.
She probably has her own kitchen somewhere in this era.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
I now have a better opinion of Jason...

 
**Dr. Roman:**
I admire him for changing such an airhead into such a tough, realistic woman...

 
**Mash:**
Medea Lily is hopelessly innocent.
She gives what she loves to whom she loves...

 
**Mash:**
I learned that her feeling is unconditional love.
If possible, I want to continue protecting her purity.

 
**Mash:**
Master. We should do the best we can to respond to Lily's love.
