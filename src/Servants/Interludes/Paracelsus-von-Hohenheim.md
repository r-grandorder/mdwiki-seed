# Paracelsus von Hohenheim

## Devil's Quest


---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Foe yesterday, ally today, huh?
 


---
 
**Dr. Roman:**
It feels so bizarre, you know? He was one of the masterminds behind Project Demonic Fog...

 
**Dr. Roman:**
...but now he's one of our allies. A miracle of the Heroic Spirit summoning system, I suppose.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
But I admit I was startled when he said that he wanted to go to "the London of that era."

 
**Paracelsus:**
That's understandable. I attempted to commit vile crimes against the world and its people.

 
**Paracelsus:**
It's logical for you to doubt me.
However&ndash;

 
**Paracelsus:**
I truly do not wish for the human world to be destroyed.
Thus, I sympathize with your goals and objectives.

 
**Paracelsus:**
Now I believe that it's possible to save all of my beloved children.

 
**Paracelsus:**
...My former self running that Project may have laughed in contempt at such a notion.

 
**Paracelsus:**
But now... Now that I've entered into a contract with Fujimaru.

 
**Paracelsus:**
I have faith once again.
In people. In the world.

 
**Paracelsus:**
...In the existence of allies of justice capable of fighting evil.

 
**Mash:**
Allies of justice&ndash;

 
**Paracelsus:**
That is none other than all of you. You defeated me as I reached out to the Project at the edge of despair.

 
**Paracelsus:**
Allow me to say the following with the deepest gratitude.

 
**Paracelsus:**
Thank you.
I beg you to show me your power once more.

 
**Mash:**
It depends on the situation.
Mr. Paracelsus.

 
**Mash:**
You mentioned unusual changes occurring in London as it corrects itself&ndash;that is what you claim?

 
**Paracelsus:**
Yes.

 
**Mash:**
What do you mean by "unusual changes?"
The Demonic Fog is gradually dissipating.

 
**Mash:**
As the era is corrected, London should return to normal without having to wait for the Demonic Fog to clear up.

 
**Mash:**
And yet,
you seem to be agitated.

 
**Mash:**
Why is that&ndash;

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
He senses something?
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
He knows something?
 


---
 
**Paracelsus:**
To Master's query, all I can say is this.
Yes and no.

 
**Paracelsus:**
It's true that I sense some kind of connection.
But I also know that there's something in this place.

 
**Paracelsus:**
Namely&ndash;

 
**Paracelsus:**
Never mind. Let us speak later.
Something remaining in the Demonic Fog approaches.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
He's right!
Multiple magical energy readings detected in the fog!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
They're likely the automatas!
They're bursting with magical energy, so be careful!

 
**Mash:**
Understood.
Senpai, give us orders!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Prepare for battle!
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Destroy the enemy while maintaining a barrier!
 


---
 
**Mash:**
Yes, Master!
&ndash;Preparing for battle!


**--BATTLE--:**

**Mash:**
Ending combat.
All enemies destroyed.

 
**Paracelsus:**
...Very impressive, Master.

 
**Paracelsus:**
Let us be off then.
I must show you firsthand what I know.

 
**Paracelsus:**
There's an underground space under the southern tip of Regent's Park...

 
**Paracelsus:**
It's part of the underground facility for the Mage's Association Or rather, for Clock Tower.

 
**Paracelsus:**
You could say it's one of their quarantine areas.
There's something here that has been sealed.

 
**Mash:**
Something?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Stuff like...dangerous magical tomes, Mystic Codes, and catalysts?

 
**Paracelsus:**
Yes.

 
**Paracelsus:**
Magical tomes&ndash;
This is basically what I'm referring to.

 
**Paracelsus:**
In particular, there's one tome that was used to seal a powerful evil that almost manifested itself in this world.

 
**Paracelsus:**
That tome, along with many other magical books,
was carefully sealed with powerful spells.

 
**Paracelsus:**
Even the spread of the Demonic Fog could not weaken the seals placed on the tomes.

 
**Paracelsus:**
Just like other dangerous things that were sealed.
However...

 
**Mash:**
You believe that these seals have been broken, correct?

 
**Paracelsus:**
Yes.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Your reasoning?
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
You seem quite certain.
 


---
 
**Mash:**
Yes, Senpai.
I'm also bothered by his self-assurance.

 
**Paracelsus:**
...It's simple.

 
**Paracelsus:**
The reason is that if I existed in this London and continued to pursue my designs&ndash;

 
**Paracelsus:**
&ndash;I would break the seals without fail.

 
**Mash:**
...What!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Huh!? Does that mean you're going to break the seals now!?

 
**Fou:**
Foou!

 
**Paracelsus:**
No. I'm not the one who will break the seals.
It will be the one still here&ndash;

 
**???:**
&ndash;To be more precise, the "me" from here.

 
**Mash:**
This voice&ndash;
Wait, I've detected a new Servant!

 
**Paracelsus:**
Show yourself.
Loather and mourner of evil, and yet is evil himself.

 
**Paracelsus:**
You who would crush all life with the very hands that would hold your dear children... You abomination.

 
**Paracelsus:**
I am thou... Thou art I.
Thy name is my name&ndash;

 
**Paracelsus:**
Paracelsus von Hohenheim!
The consort of evil!

 
**Paracelsus?:**
...Oh dear.
What an unfriendly way to address yourself.

 
**Mash:**
!?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
There are two Paracelsuses?
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Which one is the real one?!
 


---
 
**Paracelsus?:**
How easy it is to confuse you.
But I shall speak only the truth.

 
**Paracelsus?:**
We are both real.
I am thou... Thou art I.

 
**Paracelsus?:**
The Servant Paracelsus beside you whom you duly summoned and made a contract with.

 
**Paracelsus?:**
And I, born of Servant Paracelsus' magical energy that returned to the fog when you defeated him.

 
**Paracelsus?:**
Both share the name "von Hohenheim."
Both are real.

 
**Paracelsus?:**
Admittedly, my existence is somewhat unstable.

 
**Paracelsus?:**
For the Holy Grail is already gone! Materialization while lacking ways to summon Heroic Spirits!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
...He seems to be right. Observational results show that his magical energy is weak.

 
**Mash:**
The Demonic Fog...
Has given birth to a final Heroic Spirit?

 
**Paracelsus:**
Yes, exactly. That's why I'm in a hurry.
In a hurry to destroy this era.

 
**Paracelsus:**
At this rate, this era will be completely restored.
If so, I cannot destroy it with my own hands.

 
**Paracelsus:**
My existence will likely disappear.
However, I can't let that happen.

 
**Paracelsus:**
I have accepted the destruction of humanity as fate.
One cannot stop it. Thus&ndash;

 
**Paracelsus:**
&ndash;I have no choice but to go through with this!

 
**???:**
<span style="font-size:25px">GAAAAAAAA&ndash;!</span>

 
**Dr. Roman:**
What!?

 
**Mash:**
Massive magical response!
There's something&ndash;behind him!

 
**Paracelsus:**
It seems the seal has been broken.
It seems my other self is quite efficient.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
No time to praise yourself!
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
How do you repair the seal?
 


---
 
**Paracelsus:**
We must make haste.
We must destroy it before it fully activates.

 
**Paracelsus:**
If what was sealed materializes,
the Sixth Imaginary Factor&ndash;No&ndash;

 
**Paracelsus:**
&ndash;We must destroy it.
Along with my other self barring the way!

 
**Mash:**
...Senpai!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Prepare for battle!
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Let's do this, Mash!
 


---
 
**Mash:**
Yes, Master!
Preparing for and entering battle immediately&ndash;!


**--BATTLE--:**

**Mash:**
...Large-type enemy, destroyed!

 
**Mash:**
What a powerful enemy...
But somehow we managed to win...

 
**Paracelsus?:**
How disappointing&ndash;

 
**Paracelsus?:**
That is all I can say to you after giving up.
For the world will be incinerated.

 
**Paracelsus:**
No.
You are wrong.

 
**Paracelsus:**
That is what I can say, as I will not give up.
I know the world will be saved.

 
**Paracelsus?:**
...Hah. How absurd.
To think that "I"...

 
**Paracelsus?:**
...the one who continued to choose evil despite having no desire to, would be punished...

 
**Paracelsus?:**
...by my own hand...

 
**Paracelsus?:**
Ah...
The end of this pathetic, ugly self...

 
**Paracelsus?:**
This, I offer to you...Misaya...

 
**Mash:**
The enemy Servant has gone completely silent.
...Ending combat.

 
**Fou:**
Foou!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
What a terrifying opponent to face...
Well, we are in the heart of the Mage Association's lair.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
It was as fearsome as Fafnir.
It's a matter of luck that we pulled through.

 
**Paracelsus:**
That's not true&ndash;

 
**Paracelsus:**
You are all capable of victory.
Even if it were to awaken once again.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
What?

 
**Paracelsus:**
You are a bulwark against evil.
You are truly the allies of justice that I believe in.

 
**Paracelsus:**
Thus,
no matter what fearsome opponents you may face...

 
**Paracelsus:**
...no matter what betrayals you face,
no matter the depths of despair you witness...

 
**Paracelsus:**
It is impossible for you to lose&ndash;
