# Charles Babbage

## Iron Mobile Report C. Babbage

**Babbage:**
&mdash;

 
**Babbage:**
&mdash;It's calling.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
What's calling?
 
**Babbage:**
You should be able to hear it as well.
Open those ears of yours.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
You hear a voice calling for help?
 
**Babbage:**
Indeed.

 


---
 
**Babbage:**
It is impossible to deceive my auditory sensors.
For I have a great, lofty mission.

 
**Babbage:**
&ndash;To save the world.

 
**Babbage:**
As long as my engine continues to operate,
evil is incapable of existing in this world.

 
**Babbage:**
Thus, let us be off,
you who were chosen to awaken me.

 
**Babbage:**
O Brave Heroes of Steam!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Let's go, Babbage!
 


---
 
**Babbage:**
&ndash;Affirmative!

 
**Babbage:**
Steam pressure, maximum!
Difference Engine, full power!

 
**Babbage:**
Condensed Steam Propulsion Device, activate!
Our mission is to save the princess in distress!

 
**Babbage:**
&ndash;Lift off!

 
**Mash:**
Gyahhh!

 
**???:**
Gah, hah, hah! I've got you now, Princess Mash!
Stop your struggling and give up.

 
**Mash:**
Someone... Someone, help me!
These demons are going to destroy my country!

 
**Babbage:**
<span style="font-size:25px">&ndash;HAH!</span>

 
**Babbage:**
Charles Babbage has arrived! Stop right there,
you fiends who threaten a sweet princess!

 
**Mash:**
The King of Steam, and Fujimaru!
You came to save me!

 
**Babbage:**
Indeed!

 
**???:**
Hmph... If it isn't the pesky mechanical giant and the hero Fujimaru! How dare you get in our way!

 
**???:**
Today will surely be your last!
Come out, my army of evil golems!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Babbage! Enemies!
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Let's destroy them!
 


---
 
**Babbage:**
&ndash;Now is the time! Charles Babbage, Combat Mode!


**--BATTLE--:**

**???:**
I-impossible... How could my invincible evil golem army lose to a single mechanical giant!?

 
**???:**
Damn you!
Who are you!

 
**Babbage:**
I am the King of Steam!!

 
**Babbage:**
Unable to grasp the future I envisioned,
I am the king of an ephemeral world of fantasy!

 
**Babbage:**
Bravery, power, and glory evade me.
But since this body is mere fantasy&ndash;

 
**Babbage:**
Witness my inexhaustible, unlimited,
and matchless Noble Phantasm!

 
**Babbage:**
&mdash;!

 
**Mash:**
King of Steam!
You'll protect us tonight as well, won't you?

 
**Babbage:**
Indeed!

 
**???:**
Damn you! Damn you! Damn you! In that case,
witness my secret weapon&ndash; TRANSFORM!

 
**???:**
<span style="font-size:25px">GAAAAAAAAAAA!!</span>

 
**Mash:**
Gyaahhhhhhhhhh!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Babbage, we're in trouble! It's a dragon!
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
We have to fight!
 


---
 
**Babbage:**
...Even if I must stand against a Phantasmal dragon king,
I shall protect the princess and this world.

 
**Babbage:**
It's time to show the true power of my Noble Phantasm.
Behold!

 
**Babbage:**
Dimension of Steam&ndash; The edge of my future vision,
where evil perishes and humans flourish!

 
**Babbage:**
&mdash;Unlocking all functions!

 
**Babbage:**
All weapons live!
Steam Ether Reactor, full power!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Time to fight, King of Steam!
 


---
 
**Babbage:**
&mdash;Understood!


**--BATTLE--:**


---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...Or at least that's the dream I saw.
 


---
 
**Mash:**
I... Umm...
Was a princess?

 
**Mash:**
Is that right?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Yeah.
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
You were a princess.
 


---
 
**Mash:**
So, in other words...
Umm, what does that mean exactly&ndash;

 
**Mash:**
U-Umm, I mean, uhh...
Was it a fun dream...for you?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Yeah!
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Everything about it was amazing!
 


---
 
**Mash:**
I see.
I'm glad.

 
**Mash:**
I'm happy if you had fun.
It seems like you got a good night's sleep.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Good morning... Huh?
Mash, you seem to be very pleased about something.

 
**Mash:**
Nope, it's nothing.
Good morning, Doctor.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Huh?
