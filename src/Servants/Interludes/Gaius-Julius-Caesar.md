# Gaius Julius Caesar

## Nostalgic Merrits

**Caesar:**
&ndash;So nostalgic.

 
**Caesar:**
It's easy to end with just that one phrase,
but I don't do that. Do you know why?

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
(shake head)
 
**Mash:**
Right Senpai, I don't understand his ideas either.

 
**Fou:**
Fou...

 
---

**Fujimaru 2:**
(nod)

 
**Mash:**
Senpai, you can understand the idea behind his words.
But I...

 
**Fou:**
Fou...

---

 
**Caesar:**
I achieved valor in Gaul and Britannia.
That is a fact, and it was written down as well.

 
**Caesar:**
I guess you could say that I was young.
But, that was not all.

 
**Caesar:**
I escaped. It felt slightly better to preoccupy myself with service by sword than the schemes surging through Rome.

 
**Caesar:**
Betrayal for betrayal, conspiracy for conspiracy.
It's easy for me to climb the ladder of power as such.

 
**Caesar:**
After all&ndash;

 
**Caesar:**
I am a descendant of the goddess of love and beauty,
and a man who fathered a child with a female fairy.

 
**Caesar:**
My beauty makes women fall into my hands at will.
Add in my intelligence and I'm the best at scheming.

 
**Caesar:**
But...

 
**Mash:**
...

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Beauty?

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
He said beauty, right?

---
 

 
**Fou:**
Fou.

 
**Caesar:**
Actually, scheming takes quite a bit of courage.
At first you feel nothing, but gradually. Gradually.

 
**Caesar:**
While I bite into juicy grapes, while I fool around with women, political enemies die off by my schemes&ndash;

 
**Caesar:**
But when it's being repeated over and over, you start to feel sick, as if something's been tainted.

 
**Caesar:**
That is why, at times, I escaped to the battlefield.

 
**Mash:**
...I now finally understand.
Gaius Julius Caesar.

 
**Mash:**
You seek to settle all the escaping you did right here and right now.

 
**Caesar:**
That's right. I&ndash;wait, enemies.
They must have noticed us.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Enemy signatures are approaching!
Is this like, remnants of the United Empire army?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Rome should be correcting itself now, so why are there United Empire soldiers still left?

 
**Caesar:**
I'll tell you later. Before that Fujimaru, hurry up and drive them off.

 
**Caesar:**
I will take command for you.
I am a great commander.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Caesar, you fight too!

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
You're a Saber and you're hanging back?

---
 

 
**Caesar:**
Saber, right, Saber. Saber.
By rights I shouldn't even be in the Saber class.

 
**Caesar:**
...I only unsheathe my sword when I'm next to a beauty.

 
**Mash:**
Why look at me...

 
**Caesar:**
Not knowing your own beauty is equal to a crime, yes?
Well anyways, I shall unsheathe my sword.
Oh, brother&ndash;


**--BATTLE--:**

**Caesar:**
...I guess that's it.
Makes me sick.

 
**Caesar:**
Wielding a sword like this gets me fired up with nostalgia. Though, swordfights are the epitome of nuisances.

 
**Caesar:**
I seem to be escaping even now that I am a Heroic Spirit.
How pathetic!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Why are you so angry?

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Despite the lack of scheming?

---
 

 
**Mash:**
Yes, Senpai's question is legitimate.
Caesar, what is upsetting you?

 
**Mash:**
You are already a Heroic Spirit, unrelated to the bloodstained schemes of ancient Rome.

 
**Mash:**
And still...
You end up returning to Rome with us, why?

 
**Caesar:**
I've said it many times.
It is to escape.

 
**Caesar:**
To put it nicely, it's to settle things.
Oh, it also answers this Doctor guy's question.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
You mean these United Empire remnants?
For some reason, they're still around...

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Whoa, another enemy attack as we speak!
Is this area under the United Empire influence?

 
**Caesar:**
Right.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
What?

 
**Fou:**
Fou!

 
**Mash:**
We're entering combat, Master!
Your orders, please!


**--BATTLE--:**

**Mash:**
&ndash;Battle complete.
Soldiers perceived as United Empire are retreating.

 
**Caesar:**
After them. If they're headed home,
it'll save us the trouble of searching.

 
**Mash:**
Search?
Search for what&ndash;

 
**Caesar:**
I'll go on ahead.

 
**Mash:**
Please wait&ndash;
Oh, h-he's fast!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
He's pretty nimble for his size.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I expect nothing less from a Saber.

---
 

 
**Mash:**
Y-Yes... No, well&ndash;

 
**Dr. Roman:**
You guys should chase them, too!
I don't know what he'll do, but you can't abandon him!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Understood!

---
 

 
**Mash:**
Yes.

 
**Mash:**
We've caught up.
Caesar is right there&ndash;

 
**Caesar:**
You're finally here.
Perfect, you can see me face my own foolishness.

 
**Mash:**
Face?

 
**Fou:**
Fou?

 
**???:**
...I am a distinguished general of Rome.

 
**???:**
I'm the general that conquered Gaul, and made a successful expedition to Britannia.

 
**???:**
I slaughtered the great general Pompey.
I'm the only ruler of Rome, the origin of its Emperor.

 
**???:**
I danced within the cruelty of Rome, and also danced in the battlefield.

 
**???:**
I shall continue fighting.
As long as Rome exists, my dance continues.

 
**Caesar:**
No, that horrible dance ends here.
This is the end of your escapism.

 
**Caesar:**
A general? The origin of Emperor?
That is quite absurd!

 
**Caesar:**
You are merely escaping!
You pig!

 
**Caesar:**
You could not grant the wish of the one woman you loved, and you chose not to name your loving child as your heir!

 
**???:**
I am! I am Caesar!
The origin of all Roman Emperors!

 
**Caesar:**
That's right, you are me!
My unsightly half that still clings onto Rome!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
I see, I get it now! Residual effects of the Second Holy Grail is what "that" is!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
So that's why it's leading the United Empire remnants.
In other words, "that" is like Caesar's shadow!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
He sensed its presence, and guided you guys all the way here&ndash;!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
He could have just said so.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
That is indeed hard to mention.

---
 

 
**Mash:**
...Yes.

 
**Caesar:**
I apologize, beautiful friends.
I'd like to defeat my ugly escapism half right here.

 
**Caesar:**
...No, I want to return it to myself.
Lend me your powers.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Understood!

---
 

 
**Mash:**
Yes, Senpai!

 
**???:**
Oh... Ooooh!
I am! I am Caesar! I am!

 
**Caesar:**
Shut up, you pig! Such ugliness will scatter like flower petals before my beauty!


**--BATTLE--:**

**Caesar:**
...Begone my foolish past.

 
**Mash:**
Confirming zero response.
Battle's over, Senpai.

 
**Fou:**
Fou...

 
**Caesar:**
Whew, I'm tired.
Indeed, I am not fit to fight at the front line.

 
**Caesar:**
Let us hurry back to this Chaldea and rest.
I won't move one step further.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Thanks for the hard work.

---
 

 
**Mash:**
Thank you for your hard work.
Senpai, Doctor, please start the return process to Chaldea.

 
**Fou:**
Fou!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Yes, yes, return&ndash; Hmm?
Looks like Caesar's magical capacity has increased?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
After defeating his own shadow, he absorbed it as his own magical energy I guess?

 
**Fou:**
Fou, Fou!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Yes, yes, the return process.
You don't have to rush me so much...
