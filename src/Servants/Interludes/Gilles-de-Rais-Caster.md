# Gilles de Rais - Caster

## Offering to the God

**Gilles:**
Oh, what a wasteland! Scorched earth with no sign of human life, nor blade of grass left behind!

 
**Gilles:**
What manner of disaster could have befallen it?

 
**Mash:**
We're not sure of the details, either. At any rate,
a strange natural disaster beyond human knowledge...

 
**Gilles:**
Natural disaster! Not the ravages of war? Some caprice of God unrelated to Man's sins wiped out those living here?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Yes...Because this is impossible for the people of this era, perhaps you could call it a trick of fate.

 
**Gilles:**
Oh, how wretched! How disastrous!
How tragic! This cannot go unanswered!

 
**Mash:**
...Caster...

 
**Mash:**
Senpai, you can't judge a book by its cover.
Gilles may look terrifying, but he's a good Heroic Spirit.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Hm...I had some concern regarding the man who was the basis for the legend of Bluebeard, but...

**Fujimaru 1:**
He really was a good man, wasn't he?
 
**Gilles:**
Of course! No one else values life more highly than I, Gilles de Rais!

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Are you forcing yourself?
 
**Gilles:**
Nonsense! No one else values life more highly than I, Gilles de Rais!

**Mash:**
He really is a good man!

 
**Gilles:**
Human life is like a fruit. Squeeze, and the gem-like nectar shall sates my thirst. However!

 
**Gilles:**
Pain and screams! Fear and despair! Crushed before they could be fully squeezed out is such a waste!

 
**Mash:**
...Pardon?

 
**Gilles:**
Outrageous! A natural disaster as a caprice of God, and the waste of new lives is outrageous!

 
**Gilles:**
The agonies of all creatures should only be unleashed by one who appreciates the joy of plucking out a life!

 
**Mash:**
...I take back what I said. Senpai, sticking with this weirdo will only ruin Chaldea's reputation.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Well, even so. His abilities as a Servant can't be measured by the scale of good and evil.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
His personality may be kind of out there, but consider him an invaluable assets to be used effectively.

**Fujimaru 1:**
I don't like this...
 
**Gilles:**
Oh? Does my Master still not understand fully the true beauty of life?

 
**Gilles:**
No surprising. Precious few have a genius for aesthetics.
It's not something you develop in a short time.

**Fujimaru 2:**
Sounds fun!
 
**Gilles:**
Heheheh, so, you understand, my Master.
How joyful to work with a Master who thinks as I do.

 
**Gilles:**
In place of God and Satan, let us both savor the light of life, treasured as the stars!

**Mash:**
I heard that Gilles de Rais was a great hero who supported Jeanne d'Arc as a war marshal.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Yes, but at the same time, he's known as a pleasure killer who murdered hundreds of young children.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
While he's a popular Heroic Spirit, that dual nature means he can be a completely different person depending on the class he's summoned in.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
How well you master a Servant like this depends on the Master's latent potential.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Which means, Fujimaru, you'll just have to do your best!

 
**Mash:**
Meaning it's not your problem, Doctor?

 
**Fou:**
Fooou...

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Um, look! While we're talking,
the enemy signatures are getting closer!

 
**Gilles:**
Oh?
Talk about a rough welcome right after I'm summoned.

 
**Gilles:**
Very well. I shall enlighten these creatures on the true beauty of how one should kill!

 
**Mash:**
Um...I suppose this needs to be taken care of first...

 
**Mash:**
Master, you'll have to use this new Servant to get through this ordeal.

 
**Mash:**
I'll be trying hard, too, so fight bravely!


**--BATTLE--:**

**Gilles:**
Hee hee hee hee!
How lovely! How lovely!

 
**Gilles:**
I thought them as mere hors d'oeuvres, but these children sing unexpectedly well.

 
**Gilles:**
Hmm, should I reevaluate the enemy as well, perhaps?
In their own ways, they are beautiful and intriguing materials.

 
**Gilles:**
Crush them! Cut them open! Rip out their guts!
We must hear the sound of their screams for ourselves!

 
**Gilles:**
Heh, this is turning out to be an enjoyable journey, my Master.

 
**Mash:**
...Senpai, don't tell me you're planning to keep using this troublemaker...are you?

 
**Mash:**
I...
I don't think I'll ever eat octopus again...

 
**Fou:**
Fuuouu...

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Well, if you ignore what he says and does, I think he makes a pretty useful asset...

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Well, let's leave that up to Fujimaru.
It's not a proposal one can calmly make from the Command Room.
