# Henry Jekyll & Hyde

## Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde

**Jekyll:**
...I'm feeling pretty good.

 
**Jekyll:**
I finally took control of "Hyde" at last.
It's all thanks to you, I should say.

 
**Jekyll:**
Let me say thank you from my heart.
I might finally be liberated from my own karma.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
...Well, I don't know.
You don't look like you are about to be liberated.

 
**Fou:**
Fooou...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Yeah...
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
That bloodstain worries me...
 


---
 
**Mash:**
Uh, yes... Let's see... Senpai...
When he says he might be liberated...

 
**Mash:**
It might mean a liberation reaffirming violence...
don't you feel... it can, be taken, that way...?

 
**Jekyll:**
Actually, Sorry I had you bring me all the way to London, the Fourth Singularity.

 
**Jekyll:**
I'm grateful to you guys.
Ascension, was it? It was truly amazing.

 
**Jekyll:**
I'm impressed that it could turn me, nothing more than a failed mage, into such a powerful Servant.

 
**Jekyll:**
Besides, as you can see... I got a chance to come to London, though the Demonic Fog still remains.

 
**Mash:**
Since the Holy Grail was removed,
London is undergoing correction to its original era&mdash;

 
**Mash:**
But what brought you here?
You just wanted to visit your homeland, is that it?

 
**Jekyll:**
Huh?
Sure, something like that.

 
**Jekyll:**
Mash, you are quite perceptive.
Yes, I wanted to see my "homeland" firsthand.

 
**Jekyll:**
I'm glad you understand me.
You're "lovely," Mash Kyrielight.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
A-A love confession!?

 
**Mash:**
No, I don't think so. He seems&mdash;

 
**Jekyll:**
Oh, I love you, London! Of course I love you, sky!
Gas lamp! I love you very much!

 
**Mash:**
As you see, his love spreads very wide.
But it is exactly as we predicted beforehand...

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Well, I'm sorry for interrupting when you are hyped up,
but there's a bit of Demonic Fog left&mdash;

 
**Dr. Roman:**
You guys might hinder the phenomenon called Correction of the Era by being there. Yeah, who knows what might happen?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Isn't it time for us to go back?
Can I prepare for Rayshift?

 
**Jekyll:**
...I'm sorry, but will you wait just a little?
There is a place I want to visit.

 
**Jekyll:**
You guys saw "me" once before, right? In this era, in this foggy city, seeking the Fourth Holy Grail.

 
**Mash:**
You mean, we saw you in your lifetime.
Yes, you did help us a lot.

 
**Mash:**
Do you remember?
About when you saved London with us&mdash;

 
**Jekyll:**
Sure, mostly.
Anyway, you know...

 
**Jekyll:**
...I want to see for myself.
This apartment where I supposedly lived.

 
**Jekyll:**
If possible, I wish to talk to myself in my lifetime, too.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Hmm, I get it. But, you should know that Mr. Jekyll may no longer be there.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
This era is being corrected. He may already have returned to the time he's supposed to live in.

 
**Jekyll:**
Even if so...
I still wish to visit. May I?

 
**Mash:**
If you could see him...
Would there be anything you should do?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Is that why you came to this era?
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Face yourself, huh.
 


---
 
**Jekyll:**
Yes, I have something to tell him. That no matter what happens in the future, he can definitely overcome it.

 
**Jekyll:**
At least I overcame "Hyde" by killing myself.
So, I hope that I can just...

 
**Jekyll:**
...give my past self a piece of advice. It can even be something short like "Be brave and face yourself."

 
**Jekyll:**
I know it's merely self-satisfaction. Whatever I say will probably be erased in the Correction of the Era.

 
**Jekyll:**
And yet...
I wish to tell him...

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Well, if that's the case&mdash;
Hmm, Is it okay? Is something like this okay?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Of course, it won't cause something like a time paradox, but Hmm. Hmm.

 
**Fou:**
Foou!!

 
**Past Jekyll:**
...So you came to me?

 
**Past Jekyll:**
I understand most of the situation.
At any rate, it's great to see you guys again like this.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Pleasure is ours.
 
**Past Jekyll:**
Saber and the Heroic Spirits...
are all gone. No, I am fully aware of that.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Oh, you rather seem different?
 
**Past Jekyll:**
You&mdash;think?

 


---
 
**Mash:**
Me, too, it's good to see you again,
Mr. Henry Jekyll.

 
**Past Jekyll:**
I'm glad to know you're doing great.
And, well, whom I see over there is my&mdash;

 
**Jekyll:**
"Your future self."
Just think that way for now.

 
**Past Jekyll:**
"I thought so."
I take it you understood the basic gist at a glance.

 
**Jekyll:**
In that case, I suppose you also know what I'm trying to do, Mr. Henry Jekyll?

 
**Past Jekyll:**
Surely.

 
**Jekyll:**
Haha&mdash;Then, can you die for me?

 
**Mash:**
!?

 
**Fou:**
Foou!!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
W-What!? What's going on there!?
He just jumped on Mr. Jekyll, didn't he!?

 
**Mash:**
He did, Doctor.
He...tried to murder himself from his lifetime!

 
**Jekyll:**
Haha...
That's right, I wish...

 
**Hyde:**
&mdash;No, you listen to me!

 
**Hyde:**
I wanna kill me, or "Jekyll"... Who's lived his goody-goody life from the day he was born!

 
**Hyde:**
Honesty, trust, goodwill!
I don't need that kind of crap!

 
**Hyde:**
You hear me?
I can't stand the fact that you exist!

 
**Hyde:**
I will kill you!
And I will be the complete "Hyde!"

 
**Dr. Roman:**
I'm positive he's an anti-hero!
Wait, he is, right? A-at any rate, we must stop him!

 
**Past Jekyll:**
Well, it's okay.
I've always wanted to fight seriously with him once.

 
**Mash:**
Mr. Jekyll?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You're reckless to battle a Heroic Spirit!
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
You want to kill yourself?
 


---
 
**Past Jekyll:**
I'm not losing my mind.
And, I'm not a powerless human failure of a mage, either.

 
**Past Jekyll:**
I am a "Heroic Spirit." I'm one of the lost Servants materialized from the remains of Demonic Fog.

 
**Past Jekyll:**
I was summoned after you returned to Chaldea, and the living Jekyll returned to his original era&mdash;that's the story.

 
**Hyde:**
What!?

 
**Past Jekyll:**
Somehow I had a feeling that a thing like this could happen&mdash;

 
**Past Jekyll:**
So I was waiting. Right in this room,
right after my living self returned to the original era.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Two identical Heroic Spirits are in the same place!?
Could this really...happen?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Wait a second. I see. Maybe his spirit "has completely separated personalities?"

 
**Hyde:**
Damn, damn, damn!
Shoot, I did all this for nothing!!

 
**Hyde:**
Finally!
I thought I could finally kill "Jekyll"!

 
**Past Jekyll:**
You should read Wells.
Though his books were published after we died.

 
**Past Jekyll:**
The rank system of Heroic Spirits may be something that transcends such a notion, but it's fine&mdash;

 
**Past Jekyll:**
Fujimaru, Mash.
Can you fight with him against me?

 
**Mash:**
What do you mean&mdash;

 
**Past Jekyll:**
If he's like that,
he could be dangerous to get along as your ally, right?

 
**Past Jekyll:**
So, I think I should make him learn his lesson now.
For the future.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
It makes sense!

 
**Mash:**
Doctor!

 
**Hyde:**
Fine. Fine, you bastard!
I'll be happy to play your game, even by myself!

 
**Hyde:**
Goddamnit&mdash;
I'm going to take all my pent-up anger out on you!!

 
**Mash:**
S-Senpai!
What are we going to do now...!?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Whatever happens happens!
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
We just do the best we can!
 


---
 
**Mash:**
Y-yes, Master!
Servant battle&mdash;commencing!


**--BATTLE--:**

**Past Jekyll:**
...Whew. Your combat power is as quite good as I expected. Well done.

 
**Past Jekyll:**
Well, I'll be going now.
I'm sure he learned what his limit was after all.

 
**Past Jekyll:**
Nothing will do you good to be overcome by "Hyde."
Don't forget your original purpose, "myself."

 
**Past Jekyll:**
Are you going to live a life that would shame Tatsumi?
Think a little, and you'd have figured that out.

 
**Past Jekyll:**
Mash, Fujimaru.
Give my regards to Saber and Fran if you see them.

 
**Past Jekyll:**
Good-bye&mdash;

 
**Mash:**
...Servant Jekyll is gone.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
We got the results of the observation.
It shows that his existence itself was unstable.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
The Demonic Fog remaining in London is not perfect, either, so it wasn't a proper summon or materialization.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
He would have disappeared by himself sometime soon anyway. So, um&mdash;

 
**Hyde:**
...Humph.

 
**Jekyll:**
That killed the mood.
I should probably leave it at that, too.

 
**Jekyll:**
That part of "me" looked happy when he disappeared.
What the hell was that "learning his limit."

 
**Jekyll:**
...Oh my.

 
**Mash:**
(Oh&mdash;)

 
**Mash:**
(Senpai. Compared to before, he seems...)

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
A bit more obedient.
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Calmed down?
 


---
 
**Mash:**
(...Yes)

 
**Jekyll:**
I'll return to Chaldea.
Pardon me for getting you in trouble, Master.

 
**Jekyll:**
It's true I acknowledge that I am also "Hyde." but it wouldn't do any good if my thoughts become too hasty.

 
**Jekyll:**
...It will, ah, never allow me to achieve anything.

 
**Jekyll:**
Someday I will resume my battle to control "Hyde" myself. I'm truly sorry, Master, Mash.

 
**Jekyll:**
I should take no more detour and start correcting the world now.

 
**Jekyll:**
...I'll challenge myself to a rematch afterwards.
