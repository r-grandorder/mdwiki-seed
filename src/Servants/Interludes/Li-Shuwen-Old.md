# Li Shuwen - Old

## Perseverance Will Prevail

**Narration:**
It is inherently difficult for humans to prevail against evil. The notion that they could defeat a god is similarly dubious.

 
**Narration:**
But when a human is summoned as a Servant, such lamentations should no longer be given voice.

 
**Narration:**
In China, there are two expressions that convey this idea well: “Shéng jù mù duàn,” and “Shuǐ dī shí chuān.”

 
**Narration:**
Roughly translated, they mean “Little strokes fell great oaks” and “Dripping water penetrates stone.”

 
**Narration:**
Therein lies the essence of human progress.

 
**Inshun:**
Interesting. So that is how the older and wiser Lord Shuwen sees things.

 
**Inshun:**
You are quite a change of pace from your Lancer counterpart.

 
**Li Shuwen:**
Did he do something to upset you? ...Aha, I see.
You challenged my younger self to a duel.

 
**Inshun:**
I did try to control myself, but I am afraid my excitement got the better of me while I was training.

 
**Inshun:**
It seems I still have a long way to go.

 
**Li Shuwen:**
I suppose it would be uncouth of me to apologize for instigating it then.

 
**Li Shuwen:**
That said, Houzouin...

 
**Li Shuwen:**
Surely a man with your spirit and virtue could have resisted the temptation.

 
**Li Shuwen:**
Is that not what being a Servant entails?

 
**Inshun:**
I am afraid it is not as easy as you might think.

 
**Inshun:**
Although I lived to the age of sixty, and still retain memories&ndash;or rather, records of that time, I do not have any of the more temperate sensibilities I gained with age.

 
**Inshun:**
I have no fondness for fighting to the death,
but I do get a bit hotheaded from time to time.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I'll say! You guys came dangerously close to killing each other, you know!
 
**Inshun:**
Haha, I am sorry about that, Master. I knew I should stop, but I simply couldn't help myself.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I'm just glad I stopped you guys in time. It wasn't easy...
 
**Li Shuwen:**
Knowing what I was like in my youth, I'm sure this younger me must have caused a lot of trouble for you.

 


---
 
**Inshun:**
Come to think of it,
Lord Shuwen, have you not met your younger self yet?

 
**Li Shuwen:**
No, I haven't. If I did, there's no doubt in my mind that we would end up killing each other.

 
**Li Shuwen:**
I'm sure my younger self knows that as well as I do. That's why we've made it a point to never be in the same place.

 
**Inshun:**
Why would you end up killing each other?

 
**Inshun:**
Is it because he would not want to see what he is like when he is older?

 
**Li Shuwen:**
Hardly. If anything, it's the other way around.

 
**Li Shuwen:**
I've devoted my life to perfecting my martial arts. If I'd come across an older version of me when I was young, I'd want to fight him too.

 
**Li Shuwen:**
I'm sure he sees me as either the culmination or the conclusion of everything he's worked towards.

 
**Li Shuwen:**
And as a young man, he would have no reason not to see how he measures up to that as he is now.

 
**Inshun:**
Indeed. I could not agree more.

 
**Inshun:**
After all, it would be impossible for anyone besides a Servant to truly fight against oneself.

 
**Inshun:**
And if that other self is a more mature version...

 
**Inshun:**
...the urge to resist seeing whether your current self is stronger than your future self would be irresistible.

 
**Li Shuwen:**
Yes, precisely.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
But you're not going to fight each other?
 
**Li Shuwen:**
I will if you ask us to,
Master...but I know you never would.

 
**Inshun:**
Very true. It would be one thing if you were on opposing sides, but in any other circumstance...

 
**Inshun:**
Nonetheless, I would also be very interested to learn which of you is stronger!

 
**Li Shuwen:**
Hm?

 
**Li Shuwen:**
Isn't it obvious? It would be my Lancer self.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
So, which of you IS stronger?
 
**Li Shuwen:**
My younger, Lancer self would say he is.

 
**Li Shuwen:**
And I would agree with him.

 


---
 
**Li Shuwen:**
...That said...

 
**Li Shuwen:**
...I would still win.

 
**Li Shuwen:**
And as long as I know that for certain, I personally have no desire to fight my younger self.

 
**Li Shuwen:**
...But, if you'd still like us to fight even knowing that, Master, I'd be happy to oblige.

 
**Inshun:**
...Oho. Now I see.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Huh? I don't understand.


---
 
**Li Shuwen:**
I mean that strength alone is not the sole factor in deciding the victor.

 
**Li Shuwen:**
For me, it is not the pinnacle of strength that I seek.

 
**Li Shuwen:**
...It may sound like I'm just an old wolf that's lost his fangs, but this is a domain the Lancer can never reach. Kaka!

 
**Li Shuwen:**
Though of course, if he has,
that's all well and good too.

 
**Li Shuwen:**
It would just mean my victory is even more assured.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
???

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I'm still totally lost...


---
 
**Li Shuwen:**
Heh...

 
**Li Shuwen:**
Don't you worry about it, [♂ son /♀️ sport}.
As a Master, you have your own path to focus on.

 
**Li Shuwen:**
Hmm. But if that alone doesn't convince you, there's an old story I know that might change your mind.

 
**Narration:**
...A long, long time ago...

 
**Narration:**
...there was a man with fearsome good looks and two viciously powerful fists.

 
**Narration:**
The man desired strength above all else,
and fought anyone who would accept his challenge.

 
**Narration:**
The man won each and every fight, as if that were the only natural outcome.

 
**Narration:**
Whether it was through innate talent, or countless hours of diligent training...

 
**Narration:**
...the man kept winning so much that he came to be regarded as an invincible legend...

 
**Narration:**
...even as he left a trail of corpses in his wake.

 
**Narration:**
Not even stray dogs liked him. And why would they?

 
**Narration:**
The intense bloodlust he gave off frightened all living creatures who encountered him.

 
**Narration:**
Although the man had a teacher,
and peers he once studied alongside...

 
**Narration:**
...he always preferred solitude.

 
**Man:**
The way I'm going, I'll surely end up dead in a gutter.

 
**Narration:**
 
The man figured this is what fate had in store for him, and accepted it.

 
**Narration:**
 
The life of violence he led could only ever result in his own destruction.

 
**Narration:**
 
One day, he would fall.
But that day would not be today...


**--BATTLE--:**

**Narration:**
...Another day, another pile of corpses.

 
**Man:**
Tch...

 
**Narration:**
 
That said, the man did not always finish his battles unharmed.

 
**Narration:**
 
Bruised, bloodied, a ferocious crimson tiger... Even the moon seemed to try to avoid shining its light upon him.

 
**Narration:**
Naturally, there was no one around who would ever try to talk to hi&ndash;

 
**Child:**
 
Hey, what're you doing?

 
**Man:**
Hm?


**--ARROW--:**

**Child:**
Hey, what're you doing?

 
**Man:**
Hm?

 
**Child:**
Yikes, so many dead bodies.
Did you kill them, mister?

 
**Man:**
I would be lying if I said I didn't.

 
**Man:**
I've resolved to kill no more than one person per day in duels, but this was nothing so honorable as that.

 
**Child:**
Gotcha. Are you gonna kill me too?

 
**Man:**
Of course not.
You're hardly worth raising my fists over.

 
**Child:**
Aww, you're no fun.

 
**Narration:**
 
The man frowned.
He had no intention of preaching about morality...

 
**Narration:**
 
...but he still felt that was not something a child should say.

 
**Man:**
Go away. This is no sight for children.

 
**Child:**
What's the big deal? Besides, they killed my brother.

 
**Man:**
...I see. So they were bandits.

 
**Child:**
Uh-huh.

 
**Man:**
Then you should be satisfied now. Go home.

 
**Child:**
But, there's still more of them.

 
**Man:**
Oh?

 
**Narration:**
According to the child...

 
**Narration:**
 
...these bandits had built a hideout nearby,
and struck out from there, raiding nearby villages.

 
**Narration:**
 
And since this area was too remote for the authorities to help, there was nothing the villagers could do.

 
**Narration:**
 
He also told the man how his brother was killed for daring to fight back...

 
**Narration:**
 
...keeping his voice calm and measured all the while.

 
**Man:**
I see.

 
**Narration:**
 
The man had no interest in fighting injustice.

 
**Narration:**
 
But he knew that if he did nothing, the child would soon end up following in his brother's footsteps.

 
**Narration:**
 
He could see the determination in the child's eyes, could see that he was willing to fight the bandits no matter what.

 
**Narration:**
 
The man had no obligation to help the child,
and no quarrel with the bandits.

 
**Narration:**
...Still...

 
**Man:**
...Do you mean to go kill them yourself?

 
**Narration:**
 
The man then noticed the child was holding a small dagger close to his chest.

 
**Child:**
Yeah, that's right. I've gotta avenge my brother.

 
**Man:**
You won't survive.

 
**Child:**
Fine by me.

 
**Man:**
...You're too young to decide the manner of your death.

 
**Child:**
But if I don't do it, who will!?

 
**Child:**
Somebody's gotta make them pay!

 
**Man:**
Somebody, hm. So you don't care who that someone may be.

 
**Man:**
If a perfect stranger can go in your place&ndash;if it is not necessary that they be desirous of revenge&ndash;then there is no reason that someone cannot be me.

 
**Man:**
Give me that dagger.
I'll bury it in their hearts myself.

 
**Child:**
...!

 
**Narration:**
 
The man continued, falteringly.

 
**Man:**
The truth is that I have no reason to seek vengeance myself. That's why I go around searching for opportunities.

 
**Man:**
It makes no difference to me if these bandits end up rich, or if a kid ends up throwing his life away.

 
**Man:**
But, as luck would have it,
our fates have intertwined today.

 
**Man:**
I will honor that entangling and serve as a weapon in your stead. I'll be your spear, your fists.

 
**Man:**
If you can swear to yourself that your anger and hatred are justified...

 
**Man:**
...then I will use these fists of mine to crush those bandits.

 
**Child:**
...You mean it?

 
**Narration:**
 
Crouching down, the man looked the child straight in the eye.

 
**Narration:**
 
The child then handed the man his dagger,
tears spilling down his face.

 
**Child:**
Please...avenge my brother.

 
**Man:**
Very well. Your life is now in my hands.

 
**Narration:**
 
As the man walked towards the bandits' hideout,
he let his fighting spirit grow hotter and hotter.

 
**Narration:**
 
Not even a starving tiger would dare attack him now.

 
**Narration:**
 
His bloodlust and delight in battle surged to their boiling points, and he made no effort to hide either.

 
**Narration:**
 
Even the sleeping birds were startled awake by his murderous aura.

 
**C：Bandit:**
Hah? Why're the birds makin' so much noise this late at night?

 
**Man:**
Hmm. Which of you will be the first to die?
It makes no difference to me.

 
**D：Bandit:**
Huh? Who the hell do you think you&ndash;

 
**C：Bandit:**
A-aaaaaah!

 
**Man:**
There is nothing to discuss. No need for words.
Bring all your comrades here. Quickly.

 
**C：Bandit:**
S-somebody help! Hurry!

 
**E：Bandit:**
What's goin' on? The village hire some martial artist or something?

 
**C：Bandit:**
What're you so afraid of? He's just one man!

 
**Man:**
Now, now, go easy on him.
He did well, at least for a bandit.

 
**Man:**
I'm glad you're all here now. It would be much more trouble to track you all down myself.

 
**Man:**
I've counted all of you. If the number of corpses fails to match that count when this is over, I'll know how many of you turned tail and ran.

 
**Narration:**
 
The man's words stoked the bandits' murderous rage further.

 
**Narration:**
 
But it was too late. The man knew that if they truly meant to kill him...

 
**Narration:**
 
...they should have attacked before surrounding him.

 
**Man:**
None of you will leave here alive. Now fight me.

 
**Narration:**
 
The man smiled like a wolf baring its fangs.


**--BATTLE--:**

**G：Bandit:**
He's...a monster...!

 
**Narration:**
 
The bandits' lifeless bodies were strewn across the ground, just as the man's own body was now bruised and battered.

 
**Narration:**
 
But that made little difference to either his feet or his fists.

 
**Bandit Leader:**
A-aaaaaah! Please! Spare me!

 
**Bandit Leader:**
I promise I'll do anything you want!
I'll never kill again as long as I live!

 
**Man:**
Too bad you didn't have your change of heart sooner. This is payback for all the villagers you and your men killed.

 
**Narration:**
 
Blood stained the blade a vivid red. The man continued on his spree, mercilessly felling bandits left and right.

 
**Man:**
...Guess I should go give the dagger back.

 
**Man:**
But I'd better wash the blood off somewhere first...

 
**Narration:**
 
The man made his way down the gloomy mountain,
back to the boy's village.

 
**Narration:**
But...

 
**Man:**
What the...

 
**Narration:**
There was no one there to be found. Not even a sign that anyone had lived there recently.

 
**Narration:**
It was clear to see that the area had been abandoned for years.

 
**Man:**
...I see. I knew retribution should be carried out swiftly...

 
**Man:**
...but I never considered that I'd missed the chance entirely. I truly am useless.

 
**Narration:**
 
Taking the dagger out from his shirt pocket,
he found it had already half-crumbled to dust.

 
**Man:**
...I wonder whose vengeance I carried out.

 
**Man:**
Whoever you are, I bet you would have liked to do it yourself.

 
**Narration:**
...And so, the man left the deserted village behind, with only the wind howling in his wake.

 
**Li Shuwen:**
...Strong as I was back then,
I still couldn't make a difference.

 
**Li Shuwen:**
It doesn't matter how strong you are,
you still can't change the past.

 
**Inshun:**
Hmm. Still, it sounds like there was nothing you could have done about that. Sometimes, people just die for no reason.

 
**Inshun:**
In fact, neither life nor death carries any special meaning.

 
**Inshun:**
Those villagers do deserve to be mourned,
but to try to save all of them...

 
**Li Shuwen:**
Kaka. I am well aware.

 
**Li Shuwen:**
I am far from the Buddha. I've never thought to even try to save all lives in this world.

 
**Li Shuwen:**
That said...

 
**Li Shuwen:**
There are things I can teach, and lessons I can convey.

 
**Li Shuwen:**
What I lacked back then was the composure to realize that.

 
**Li Shuwen:**
I am neither a hero, nor a villain.

 
**Li Shuwen:**
So I thought, at the very least, I should leave what I've learned behind for others to study.

 
**Li Shuwen:**
Even I have something I want to protect. These fists can be quite useful at getting to the crux of certain matters.

 
**Inshun:**
...Still, Lord Shuwen, what you describe is nothing less than a break with your past self.

 
**Inshun:**
Is there nothing about that you regret?

 
**Li Shuwen:**
Regret? Of course.

 
**Li Shuwen:**
Seeing myself grow weaker by the day...
Seeing my fists grow dull and ineffective...

 
**Li Shuwen:**
It would be stranger if I had no regrets at all.

 
**Li Shuwen:**
But, all those regrets are gone, now that I'm here.

 
**Inshun:**
...Aha, I see. You make an excellent point!

 
**Inshun:**
Late though it may be for me, perhaps that is what I should strive for too.

 
**Li Shuwen:**
All right, I think that's enough idle talk for now.
Shall we get going, Master?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Sounds good!
 
**Li Shuwen:**
Very well.

 
**Inshun:**
Indeed! I'm glad we had this talk.

 
**Inshun:**
Now I am more eager to wield my spear than ever!

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
So you're all set then?
 
**Li Shuwen:**
Of course. These fists are yours to command as you see fit.

 


---
 
**Narration:**
...His body grows weaker by the day,
and with it, his fists grow duller.

 
**Narration:**
One can easily imagine his younger self mocking him,
saying something like...

 
**Narration:**
“What were you doing with your life up till now, old man?”

 
**Narration:**
But the old man would just laugh it off.

 
**Narration:**
He knows now that his fists are no longer a weapon he wields solely for his own sake...

 
**Narration:**
...but one that cuts a path forward for those who follow behind...
