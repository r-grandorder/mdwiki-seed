# Queen of Sheba

## Harder Than Going Through the Eye of a Needle

**David:**
Ooof. Oh hey, Fujimaru.
Are you by chance looking for the Queen of Sheba?

 
**David:**
Actually, in the hallway a few minutes ago...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You ran into her?


---
 
**David:**
...I did not. Hahaha!

 
**David:**
I had some business with her myself.
She's the Queen of Sheba, after all.

 
**David:**
She's the queen whose beauty was praised and noted in any number of texts and works of art. Even the Bible!

 
**David:**
And now that beauty has come to Chaldea.
I always meant to introduce myself to her!

 
**David:**
I would start off with a brisk “hello” and a pleasant conversation starter. Then, I would lock eyes with her and seal the deal by taking her hand.

 
**David:**
You have to meet a person to know if you're compatible with them, you know.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I don't know what you're talking about.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
So you're looking for someone to abi-shag...


---
 
**David:**
Hey, I'm passionate about this!
It's very important to me!

 
**David:**
With the help of a certain someone here (a fellow fan of bronze skin and fuzzy ears), I've done a bit of sleuthing.

 
**David:**
First, I checked when the Queen appears in common areas. Then I looked into her favorite facilities and how she likes to get to them...

 
**David:**
But not once have I managed to meet her. Hrmmm...

 
**David:**
I try to get a few steps ahead, but she always seems to see just what I'm planning, and so manages to evade me. I have only failed so far!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
That's impossible.
 
**David:**
I'm not exaggerating. It's all true.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I'll just go report you for stalking...
 
**David:**
Oh, no. I wouldn't recommend that, Master. I'll have you know that I'm always innocent. My good looks always help me beat the rap.

 
**David:**
But, should the security personnel be male, he may falsely accuse me out of sheer jealousy. How sad.

 
**David:**
Besides, I'm only acting on instinct. As a sheep herder, I'm inclined to gather any lost sheep&ndash;

 
**David:**
Okay, fine! It's my fault!
Just put your phone away!

 
**David:**
...But honestly. Big as this place is, failing to run into someone at least once seems odd...

 


---
 
**David:**
Maybe it's because...she's using her power of looking into the future or something...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Maybe it's annoying enough that going so far is all she can do...


---
 
**David:**
You think it's annoying?
But this handsome guy is so desperate!

 
**David:**
I know my actions can be problematic, but don't you think it's funny when you think about it? That fact I, for once, am failing?

 
**David:**
Don't you think that's a sight to behold?
Oh, I hope the Queen of Sheba thinks so too.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
King David's optimism scares me.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I wouldn't say anything if you weren't out of line.


---
 
**David:**
Thanks for that uninspiring word of encouragement, Master. I'll just have to patiently wait for my encounter like a gentleman.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
So...we're back at the Command Room.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Da Vinci asked me to search for her...


---
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Eh!?

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Where am I!? Why is there suddenly a desert!?


---
 
**???:**
Meowhahaha!

 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
Well, well...you fell right into my mousetrap,
agent of the villainous universal genius!

 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
There's no use squirming to get out!
Not so much as a rat is gonna escape on my watch!

 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
You'll get a punch! A kick! A body slam!
Come at me! I've got moves like a jaguar!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...Eh!? Eh? Jaguar Warrior!?

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
But you're not even from the desert...


---
 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
Ha! Everyone knows cats and the desert go together like peanut butter and jelly!

 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
And now, the winds of South America will blow CATastrophically in this desert! What I mean is, you're gonna die!

 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
Ack!!! Ptttfttt! Sand! It's rough and coarse and getting everywhere! And drying out my famous toe beans!

 
**Queen of Sheba:**
U-um...Jaguar?

 
**Queen of Sheba:**
I'm sorry to interrupt, but I believe Master has some business with me...

 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
Oh, I see... I understand. Except I don't!
The only thing I know is that there are butts that need kicking for entering my territory!

 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
I thought I made myself clear, lovely animal-eared girl!
I can only remember and follow one command at a time!

 
**Queen of Sheba:**
P-please wait! (Sigh)...
I guess we have no choice.

 
**Queen of Sheba:**
I'm sorry to ask this since you only just arrived, Master.

 
**Queen of Sheba:**
But would you mind giving me a hand in calming her down? I will repay you generously.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Anything for my Queen!

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Understood. I'll look forward to your reward.


---

**--BATTLE--:**

**Jaguar Warrior:**
Oh gods! Oh gods!
Have you forsaken me, Babylonia's&ndash;

 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
...Babylo-lo!?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...We're back in the Command Room!?


---
 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
Ack...im...pawssible...
So all this was just a desert meowrage...

 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
Hahaha...it was a short-lived dream...the real me probably is asleep at a cat cafe...

 
**Queen of Sheba:**
Whew...have you calmed down, Jaguar?

 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
Yep, I'm awake, and I'm feline fine. Hm. I don't even know what a Babylonia god whatsit is...

 
**Kid Gil:**
Wow. Amazing. (Clap, clap)

 
**Kid Gil:**
That was an amazing illusion.
So potent. It felt so real.

 
**Kid Gil:**
I could even feel the burning heat of the desert sun, and it was making me thirsty.

 
**Kid Gil:**
I'm sure that skill came in handy in protecting the kingdom of Sheba.

 
**Queen of Sheba:**
Kid Gil...don't embarrass me...
That illusion wasn't the one I wanted to use...

 
**Kid Gil:**
Some of Chaldea's magecraft equipment on the fritz, right? It happens all the time, don't worry about it.

 
**Queen of Sheba:**
That's a relief. That means there won't be any lawsuits... Anyway, this is bad!

 
**Queen of Sheba:**
I really didn't intend for Master to get caught up in this!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Kid Gil's here too? What's going on?

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Does this have to do with Da Vinci calling everyone over?


---
 
**Queen of Sheba:**
Oh, my... Oh, my...

 
**Queen of Sheba:**
Da Vinci was looking for me?
I-I didn't even notice.

 
**Queen of Sheba:**
I'm sorry. Kid Gil and I were having a business meeting&ndash;I-I mean, we were in deep conversation, so I didn't realize...

 
**Queen of Sheba:**
And I asked Jaguar to stand guard and make sure no one disturbed us.

 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
Yep. I accepted the task for an hourly rate of three tangerines. One to save for later, one for sketching, and one to freeze.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Very suspicious...

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Are you hiding something?


---
 
**Queen of Sheba:**
Ehhh!?
N-no! Nothing...nothing at all!

 
**Kid Gil:**
Oh, does it look suspicious?

 
**Kid Gil:**
I suppose it does.
I guess Da Vinci does have the upper hand.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Oh, right. So Da Vinci was&ndash;


---
 
**Queen of Sheba:**
Eh!? Tons of lost manuscripts unearthed!?
THE Leonardo da Vinci's manuscripts!?

 
**Queen of Sheba:**
And she's trying to figure out how to handle them!?

 
**Queen of Sheba:**
Well then just give them to me so I can auction them off! I've got this!

 
**Queen of Sheba:**
We can even leave my handling fee open for negotiation. I've already opened up some back channels and&ndash;Oh.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
“Oh”?

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
“Back channels”?


---
 
**Queen of Sheba:**
Ah...um...well... Oh, my... Oh, my...

 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
Hm? What's wrong, my animal-eared amigo?

 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
You just made this really devilish face that reminds me of another friend of mine.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I get it now.
 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
What do you mean, you get it now!?
Explain, please.

 
**Kid Gil:**
Okay.
So you all know that my treasury is...you know...

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I see. Can't authorize that.
 
**Queen of Sheba:**
Ehhhhhh!?
Nooo, Master!

 
**Kid Gil:**
Yes, exactly. It's widely known that my treasury is...you know...

 


---
 
**Kid Gil:**
Of course, I do have a fine collection of weapons and armor as well, but not only that, I also possess a vast number of ornaments and rare metals.

 
**Kid Gil:**
But to keep them all locked up is such a waste...

 
**Kid Gil:**
...That, at least, would be the modern take on it...and since we've had knowledge of modern norms granted to us, that is the conclusion that we came to.

 
**Queen of Sheba:**
That's why...I've suggested Kid Gil try some investment ventures to fund a side business...

 
**Queen of Sheba:**
It will serve as collateral to finance art exhibits for people to appreciate and admire. Growth industries where we can put his fortune to work for him!

 
**Kid Gil:**
She has a great eye for appraisal...
This arrangement would be beneficial for me as well.

 
**Kid Gil:**
My treasury gets a bit more organized, and I get a chance to add some more modern treasures to it as well.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I still don't get why you brought Jaguar Warrior into this...


---
 
**Queen of Sheba:**
Actually...you see...

 
**Queen of Sheba:**
I (discretely) approached some of the more...veteran Servants who have more experience in this modern world, seeking their cooperation...

 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
Meow?

 
**Queen of Sheba:**
U-um...do you have a moment?
There is something I would like to discuss with you...

 
**Georgios:**
Well! If it isn't the great queen of the southern desert nation!

 
**Georgios:**
You cannot imagine how excited I was to learn that you were summoned to Chaldea!

 
**Georgios:**
How reassuring! Ah, how holy!
You, an individual full of knowledge and divinity!

 
**Georgios:**
Together, we shall become the sword and shield of Chaldea and lead it down the path of righteousness!

 
**Queen of Sheba:**
Uh...s-sure...
P-pleased to meet you...

 
**Queen of Sheba:**
Um...well...thank you for your time...

 
**Queen of Sheba:**
Excuse me...

 
**Martha:**
Oh, my! It is the Queen of Sheba! I am honored!
Please, allow me to shake your hand!

 
**Queen of Sheba:**
...S-sure... Ooooucch! My bones! My poor hand!

 
**Martha:**
You are the living embodiment of a miracle!
Faith will surely take hold in this land now!

 
**Martha:**
Should you need any help at all,
please do not hesitate to ask me!

 
**Martha:**
The fastest way to get a six-pack, the best bulking recipes...please leave all of that to me!

 
**Queen of Sheba:**
Um...okay... If I ended up needing that...I guess... Really...sorry for your trouble...

 
**Queen of Sheba:**
Tarasque...is so cute...I wish I had one... (Sob)...

 
**Martha:**
...?

 
**Kid Gil:**
They are all great and reliable people, who hold the Queen of Sheba in the highest esteem...

 
**Kid Gil:**
But they weren't the right personnel for THIS job...haha...

 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
Heh. So you're looking for the right connections and market? It's not that I don't know a few...

 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
But all my sources deal in shady and dangerous addictive substances... Like gourmet candy.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
So this is a business venture to earn you some spending money?


---
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Well, then I know the perfect person.


---
 
**Queen of Sheba:**
...

 
**Queen of Sheba:**
WHAT!?!?!?
It's not who I think it is, is it?

 
**Queen of Sheba:**
Are you perchance thinking of an individual whose name starts with “D”? Specifically, a king whose name starts with “D”?

 
**Queen of Sheba:**
Impossible!

 
**Queen of Sheba:**
He's basically my chief business rival!
A competitor!

 
**Queen of Sheba:**
Were I to team up with him,
it would ruin my profit margins!

 
**Kid Gil:**
Oh, and don't forget that when the business takes off, I'll be taking my cut, too.

 
**Kid Gil:**
I'll invest as much as you need until then, of course.

 
**Queen of Sheba:**
Ack.

 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
Something's bothering me...from a legal standpoint. Let me guess...

 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
Sheba and Kiddy Gil...are you guys trying to get into some kinda shady business together?

 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
Is this going to affect Chaldea's peaceful snack time situation?

 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
I don't want to see Fujimaru and Mash with the expression of someone who's used up all their materials and embers.

 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
Not in my Chaldea. I'd rather die than to have us eat only apple cores for every meal.

 
**Queen of Sheba:**
Th-things would never come to that...p-probably...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
She's suddenly not so confident.
 
**Queen of Sheba:**
I AM confident!

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Wasn't your future sight going to get you a pile of money?
 
**Kid Gil:**
For one thing, if she did anything THAT flashy,
nobody would want to do business with her.

 


---
 
**Queen of Sheba:**
Master, are you trying to get in the way of my side business? I'll have you know, I am not giving up on this endeavor!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Not at first, I wasn't.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I kinda feel like I should stop this, yeah.


---
 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
Hm! I agree with Fujimaru!

 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
Time to boycat this plan! Losing out on three tangerines is tough, but it's gotta be done!

 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
Start the simulator!
Start the battle BGM!

 
**Kid Gil:**
Oh? This is...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
A 3D image?

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
A simulation?


---
 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
Meowhahahaha!

 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
Behold the high-techiness of My Room instantly turning into a small-scale simulator room!

 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
It was so worth getting help from an anonymous member of Chaldea (a fan of fuzzy ears and big sister types)!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Can't put anything past that half-god, half-human feline!
 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
Heh. A couple squeezes of my toe beans, and she was all mine!

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
How much did this renovation cost?
 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
Don't ask about cost!
You'll ruin our P&L!

 


---
 
**Queen of Sheba:**
...If brute force is what would make you listen...

 
**Queen of Sheba:**
Then maybe it wouldn't be so bad to let my fists do the talking to introduce this plan to Master!

 
**Kid Gil:**
Oh, wow. Looks like both parties are really fired up.

 
**Kid Gil:**
Oh well, I guess I did get on this ride!
I'll just have to do my share for our business.

 
**Kid Gil:**
Shall we get down to it, Master?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
His eyes aren't smiling...!

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
He's LITERALLY going to use body language, huh?
 


---

**--BATTLE--:**

**Jaguar Warrior:**
Meowhahahaha!

 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
We won! Chaldea's snack time is made safe at the paws of your faithful Jag&ndash;

 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
Meow?

 
**Emiya:**
Excuse me for interrupting your...uh, deep discussion.

 
**Emiya:**
I received a report that the jaguar who's been looting our pantry is here.

 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
Eh!? Oh crap!

 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
H-hey! Lemme go! Don't just lift me up by the scruff of my neck like that!

 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
...A-air...can't...breathe...

 
**Emiya:**
I got her. Target secured.

 
**Emiya:**
Sorry to cause trouble.
I'll take my leave now.

 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
...! Mrrroooooow!!!

 
**Da Vinci:**
...

 
**Da Vinci:**
(Pat)

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Da Vinci...did you come to check things out?

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Is this...a note?


---
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
(Is she telling me I need to deal with this?)


---
 
**Queen of Sheba:**
...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Why did you want all that money, Queen?

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I'm sure we could give you an allowance that will let you could live comfortably here...


---
 
**Kid Gil:**
Ah, yes. We did not get an explanation of why she wanted to start up a business in the first place.

 
**Kid Gil:**
Not that I much care.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You're always so rational about things like this, Kid Gil.
 


---
 
**Kid Gil:**
Yes... That has been said before.

 
**Kid Gil:**
But this is about her, not me.

 
**Queen of Sheba:**
B-because...

 
**Queen of Sheba:**
C...camels...!

 
**Queen of Sheba:**
I want pet camels!

 
**Queen of Sheba:**
In Chaldea! I want to keep camels in Chaldea!

 
**Queen of Sheba:**
But...after I researched a few things,
it sounded...so difficult...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Camels? How many?
 
**Queen of Sheba:**
At least...maybe one hundred...
A-and I'm not kidding!

 
**Queen of Sheba:**
If there was only one, it'd get lonely!

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Well, yeah, this isn't an environment camels thrive in...
 
**Queen of Sheba:**
Why is Chaldea in a place like this!?

 
**Queen of Sheba:**
Let's move to the desert! The desert!

 


---
 
**Kid Gil:**
Ahaha...a full-scale camel zoo in Chaldea, huh?

 
**Kid Gil:**
Yeah, a few million dollars wouldn't be enough for that.

 
**Kid Gil:**
The cost to build such a facility, plus yearly maintenance...it'd be upwards of three hundred mil!

 
**Kid Gil:**
After all, we're in such an isolated location that we might as well be trying to terraform Mars or something.

 
**Queen of Sheba:**
So...it's impossible...isn't it?
(Sob)... Camel...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Oh...this is?

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Another illusion? Or a mirage?


---
 
**Kid Gil:**
Oh? This is different than the usual simulator projection.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Actually, according to Da Vinci...


---
 
**Kid Gil:**
Oh?

 
**Kid Gil:**
The Near-Future Observation Lens: Sheba keeps starting up because it synchronizes with the Queen of Sheba's mental state?

 
**Kid Gil:**
And not just that, but it's affecting the other machines too, causing a bunch of problems?

 
**Kid Gil:**
I see.

 
**Kid Gil:**
I suppose I should expect as much from something Lev Lainur created...

 
**Kid Gil:**
But, that's strange.

 
**Kid Gil:**
With so many Servants gathered here in Chaldea,
why did this happen now?

 
**Kid Gil:**
...

 
**Kid Gil:**
Oh...I see...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
We need to take care of the Queen's homesickness!
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
...By the way, about my reward...
 
**Queen of Sheba:**
...Oh...okay...

 
**Queen of Sheba:**
Would an assorted camel-shaped cookie box suffice?
They're all broken, though.

 


---
 
**Queen of Sheba:**
Camel... (Droopy ears)

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...Queen of Sheba!


---
 
**Queen of Sheba:**
What is it, Master?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I will take you to the desert!
 
**Queen of Sheba:**
...

 
**Queen of Sheba:**
...You're not pulling my leg, are you?

 
**Queen of Sheba:**
Then...make sure you always bring me along when you go on a quest to the desert!

 
**Queen of Sheba:**
And even if it isn't a quest,
just take me whenever I ask you, okay?

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I will be your camel!
 
**Queen of Sheba:**
...

 
**Queen of Sheba:**
...Really?

 
**Queen of Sheba:**
Promise? I want one with one hump, okay?

 
**Queen of Sheba:**
If you have two humps,
I'll tan your skin and make you into a wallet.

 


---
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...Okay!

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
As you wish, my Queen.
 


---
 
**Queen of Sheba:**
Heehee...

 
**Queen of Sheba:**
Teehee...heehee! Okay!

 
**Queen of Sheba:**
I'm feeling a bit better...
Sorry to worry you all so much.

 
**Kid Gil:**
That's great.
By the way, Queen of Sheba...

 
**Kid Gil:**
If you would like to tamp down this “power”
of yours, I think I can offer some advice.

 
**Queen of Sheba:**
...!!!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Does that mean...
 
**Kid Gil:**
Yes. It's a side effect of her future sight.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
This was all caused by indiscriminate use of future sight?
 
**Kid Gil:**
Yes. It appears so.

 


---
 
**Queen of Sheba:**
I see...

 
**Queen of Sheba:**
Got it. I'll allow Kid Gil to help me once more.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Please help.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Try to keep the mischief to a minimum...
 


---
 
**Kid Gil:**
Master, are you going to go to Da Vinci to report your findings?

 
**Kid Gil:**
Understood. Good work.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
See you.


---
 
**Queen of Sheba:**
Aaack!

 
**Queen of Sheba:**
...Da...!

 
**David:**
Hmmm...I see...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Have you been waiting outside the whole time?


---
 
**David:**
No. Absolutely not. This is just a really,
really, really fortunate coincidence.

 
**David:**
Besides, if I was going to hang around outside, I'd have just knocked.

 
**David:**
I just so happened to pass by&ndash;
(Fidget, fidget)

 
**Queen of Sheba:**
Hnnnrrrrrrgh...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Her fur is standing on end...


---
 
**David:**
...Hmmm. Ah! She truly is the unparalleled beauty of legend!

 
**David:**
I am unworthy of the honor of being in your presence, Your Majesty!

 
**David:**
...But you know what? I'm a bit disappointed...

 
**David:**
Just a liiiiiitle bit... She's not quite my type.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
&mdash;Eh?

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Okay, she's kinda tall, but is that really why?


---
 
**David:**
Oh, how unfortunate!
Unfortunate, but... Yes, I can move on.

 
**David:**
The queen is a beauty, but not really my type of beauty. Let's just leave it at that.

 
**David:**
Welp! Off to the cafeteria to enjoy some babka.

 
**David:**
See you later, Fujimaru. I will let you take the role of the Queen's escort!

 
**Queen of Sheba:**
...

 
**Queen of Sheba:**
...Huh? WHAT!?

 
**Queen of Sheba:**
WHAT IS WITH HIM!?

 
**Queen of Sheba:**
With that face...that voice...saying things like that!

 
**Queen of Sheba:**
I don't like him! I hate him!
I want to go back to the desert!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Don't let that vagabond get under your skin, my Queen.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Looks like we're going to have equipment trouble for a bit longer...


---
 
**Kid Gil:**
Ahahaha.
Master, you really do have your hands full!
