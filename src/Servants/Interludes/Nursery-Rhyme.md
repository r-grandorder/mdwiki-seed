# Nursery Rhyme

## A Bunch of Books, a Crowd of Us

**Mash:**
It's dark... isn't it?

 
**Fou:**
Foooouu...

 
**Mash:**
It's very similar to a place we've seen before.
The Soho area of London.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
The old bookstore, right?
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Where Andersen was, right?
 


---
 
**Mash:**
Yes, Senpai.
It's very similar to the 2nd floor of that bookstore.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
I'm sure it is.
That's because your current location&ndash;

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Is inside Nursery Rhyme's Reality Marble.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Although slightly different if we were to be technical.
It's a subtype of the dream shared by Master and the contracted Servants.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Anyway, it's a special place.
A special place involving the Servant Nursery Rhyme.

 
**Mash:**
Understood, Doctor.
I came up with a similar theory.

 
**Mash:**
...Because she's here.

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
&mdash;

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Why this form, I wonder?
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
She's back to being a book.
 


---
 
**Mash:**
Yes. When you performed the second Ascension,
she gained the form of a young girl.

 
**Mash:**
So why has she regressed to her original form?

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
&mdash;

 
**Mash:**
She doesn't speak, either.
This is&ndash;

 
**Fou:**
Fooou!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Uh-oh! I'm detecting magical energy in your vicinity!
It looks like her, but it's not!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
They're trying to surround you,
which means they're probably enemies!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Prepare for combat!
 


---
 
**Mash:**
Roger, Master!
Give me your orders!


**--BATTLE--:**

**Mash:**
Enemies defeated.
...She helped us.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Which means that, yup, Nursery Rhyme accepts Fujimaru as her Master.

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
&mdash;

 
**Dr. Roman:**
She's a book, so she doesn't talk, though.
What is happening, exactly?

 
**Mash:**
Keep looking into it, Doctor.
It appears we've got more enemies approaching.

 
**Mash:**
Senpai, give me your orders.
The battle continues!


**--BATTLE--:**

**Fou:**
Fooou!

 
**Mash:**
Battle is over. We've defeated them.
Good work, Senpai.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
I'm not getting anywhere with my analysis, but I have news. There's something very similar to Nursery Rhyme nearby.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
That army of books was similar to her,
but this is more like an exact copy.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
This might be what pulled you into that space.
Can you try talking to it?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Roger!
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Nothing else to do anyway
 


---
 
**Mash:**
Okay, Senpai.
Let's move&ndash;You too, Nursery Rhyme.

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
&mdash;

 
**Mash:**
Oh, when you move,
she follows you, huh?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
That book's really attached.
That's really...rather nice...

 
**Mash:**
Yeah.
It feels like watching a cute little animal.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Is that...

 
**Mash:**
Seems like it's up ahead.
I can feel the response.

 
**Fou:**
Fou...

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Here it comes. Looks like it's approaching.
It might be an enemy, so be careful!

 
**Nursery Rhyme?:**
&ndash;Hello, the other me.

 
**Nursery Rhyme?:**
I missed you, book me!
Emotions folded in-between the pages.

 
**Nursery Rhyme?:**
I missed you, real me! The me who can do nothing without fingers to flip the pages.

 
**Nursery Rhyme?:**
I am me, Alice.
You are me, a story.

 
**Nursery Rhyme?:**
No, no. I am me.
I'm not Alice. You stay in that form, okay?

 
**Mash:**
Alice?

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
&mdash;

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Two Nursery Rhymes?
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
What's going on?
 


---
 
**Mash:**
I don't know, exactly...

 
**Mash:**
But the one that's connected to you by contract is the one that's a book.

 
**Mash:**
But at the same time...
That girl over there...

 
**Mash:**
She doesn't seem to be a fake Nursery Rhyme.
Her magical energy feels too similar.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
I got a detailed analysis now that you're closer&ndash;
Yup, Mash is right. Their magical energy response is identical.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
It's too identical.
Like another copy of the same being?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
I want to say that's impossible,
but where you are, in a way, is inside Nursery Rhyme.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
It's possible that her core is split into two beings!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
In other words?
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Dumb it down for me!
 


---
 
**Mash:**
They're both her.
It's a possibility.

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
&mdash;Correct.

 
**Mash:**
(It talked!)

 
**Fou:**
(Fou!)

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
&mdash;That's me. The other me.

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
&mdash;The me in Alice's form.

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
&mdash;The Alice that shouldn't exist
&mdash;Because I imitated that form.

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
&mdash;I thought to myself.
&mdash;That form is Alice's, but...

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
&mdash;Is it okay for me to take it?
&mdash;Can I be Alice when there is no Alice here?

 
**Nursery Rhyme?:**
No, no, no. It's wrong!
I am just a story, right?

 
**Nursery Rhyme?:**
Alice isn't here!
Only I'm here!

 
**Nursery Rhyme?:**
I must stay a story.
I can't stay as Alice.

 
**Nursery Rhyme?:**
Right&ndash;?

 
**Mash:**
??

 
**Dr. Roman:**
...I see! So that's it!
Nursery Rhyme isn't supposed to have a human form!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
But the Ascension gave her the form of a little girl.
That self-contradiction grew within her.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
So she called Fujimaru, her Master,
deep inside her.

 
**Mash:**
She's trying to get an answer, isn't she?
About which form she should choose.

 
**Mash:**
The book Nursery Rhyme is uncertain.
The girl Nursery Rhyme wants to reject it.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...Let's ask her.
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
It's her choice.
 


---
 
**Mash:**
That's right, Senpai.
...Nursery Rhyme, the answer is within you.

 
**Mash:**
We can't answer for you.
We don't know what that girl's form means to you.

 
**Mash:**
We don't know why you're hesitating.
Or who or what you're thinking of.

 
**Mash:**
So...

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
&mdash;I am me. I know that.

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
&mdash;But I want to be Alice.
&mdash;I want that form, if I can have it.

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
&mdash;I want to drink sweet, sweet tea as Alice.
&mdash;I want to eat sweet, sweet candy as Alice.

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
&mdash;I want to play, as Alice.

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
...That was what Alice longed to do,
...when she held me in her arms until the very end.

 
**Mash:**
...Senpai.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
There's your answer.
 


---
 
**Mash:**
Right, Master!

 
**Nursery Rhyme?:**
I see. So that was my decision.
But I won't allow it!

 
**Nursery Rhyme?:**
I am me. Alice isn't here!
I won't let you pretend this is a happy ending!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Magical energy response expanding!
Here she comes!


**--BATTLE--:**

**Mash:**
...Enemy unit defeated.

 
**Nursery Rhyme?:**
Hmph. Actually, I knew how this was going to end.
If Alice isn't here&ndash;

 
**Nursery Rhyme?:**
I can just become Alice.
That's the kind of dumb idea I'd get now.

 
**Nursery Rhyme?:**
Listen, me.
If you're going to choose Alice's form...

 
**Nursery Rhyme?:**
Never...let your...
story have...

 
**Nursery Rhyme?:**
an unhappy ending...

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
&mdash;Yeah.

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
I'll make it a happy ending.
I'll do my best for Alice.

 
**Fou:**
Fooou!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Okay, I guess we're done!
That weird space is closing, I think, so yeah!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
I'll use the Rayshift technology to get you back to Chaldea. Ready&ndash;go!
