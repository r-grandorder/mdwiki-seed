# Artoria Pendragon 

## Reasons to Fight

**Altria:**
This is Fuyuki, birthplace of the Holy Grail War...

 
**Altria:**
Horrible. This flame won't disappear for another 10 or 20 years.

 
**Altria:**
The curse seeped into the very land itself.
This place is no longer fit for human habitation.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Seems so.
Apparently, there's a similar city in America.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
There are fires on the surface, and the ground bseneath is full of gas. It is expected to burn another 50 years.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Well, that was an accident caused by human urban development. This one is a disaster caused by magecraft.

 
**Altria:**
Disaster by magecraft...
What are your thoughts, Master?

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
It's most likely the Holy Grail.
 
**Altria:**
You believe it's Holy Grail... As much as I don't want to admit it, it's seems undeniable.

 
---

**Fujimaru 2:**
It's because it became a singularity.
 
**Altria:**
The Holy Grail was not the cause, rather, the very nature of the city was altered by becoming a singularity?

---

 
**Mash:**
...Excuse me. But it was you who protected this city's Holy Grail, Saber.

 
**Mash:**
Or to be more precise, another aspect of you.
Do you have any memories of those events?

 
**Altria:**
...My apologies.

 
**Altria:**
Heroic Spirits who are summoned to be Servants are separated from their original selves in that moment.

 
**Altria:**
When released from our contract, we return to the Throne and all our experiences are stored as integrated memories.

 
**Altria:**
My current self is the "me" from when I conducted myself as the King of Knights, a Saber.

 
**Altria:**
Fujimaru, Mash, please think of that black armored version of me as an entirely different person.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Yes, that is both a plus and minus of the Heroic Spirit summoning system.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
A single Heroic Spirit can employ various facets of itself, but combat between the same Heroic Spirit is also possible.

 
**Altria:**
But rest assured, as long as my dark fallen self belongs to another class I will never change, no matter what happens.

 
**Altria:**
My sword serves only you and your goal.
It will never attack you even by mistake.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I'm glad to hear that.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I trust you, of course.

---
 

 
**Altria:**
Right. Thank you Master,
for the time being I shall answer that trust.

 
**Mash:**
That growl!
I sense a hostile presence, Senpai!

 
**Altria:**
This should provide excellent combat experience.
Mash, follow me. I shall show you how to fight!

 
**--BATTLE--:**
 
**Altria:**
Just as I thought, she has potential. Mash will become a fine warrior, Fujimaru.

 
**Altria:**
...Then again.
We still need to work on her fear on the battlefield.

 
**Mash:**
...I'm sorry.
Battles are scary, after all.

 
**Mash:**
Aren't you scared, Saber? I mean, you're around the same age as me, and you're a girl too&mdash;

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Yes, I'm curious about that myself.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
It was a surprise to learn that the legendary King Arthur was a girl&mdash;but what really surprised me was your strength.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
I think the quality of Saber's... Altria's Spirit Origin is top-class even among Heroic Spirits.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Altria, King Arthur rather,
why are you so free of doubt?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
You went so far as to disguise yourself as a man to take the throne, unite a ravaged Britain, and drive off invaders.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
What were your reasons to go to such lengths, and what series of events forced you into that position.

 
**Altria:**
...What reasons and events you say? Let me see.
I can explain the series of events, if not the reasons.

 
**Altria:**
I was born to eliminate the previous king, a foolish ruler...
Rather, I was created for it.

 
**Altria:**
I believe it's a type of magecraft called "conceptual fertilization."

 
**Altria:**
Mother was pregnant with the concept of the Red Dragon, guardian of Britain, and gave birth to me.

 
**Altria:**
The high quality of my Spirit Origin is likely a result of that. Afterwards, I drew the sword that selects kings.

 
**Altria:**
Having been chosen by the sword, I was saved by Merlin, my guardian as well as a weird mage.

 
**Altria:**
I was then entrusted with the sacred sword by the Lady of the Lake, and came to rule Britain.

 
**Altria:**
That is the long and short of my past.
Just like the legends.

 
**Altria:**
What may differ slightly from your preconceptions is my gender, I suppose.

 
**Altria:**
I mean. When it comes to ruling a country,
being a man made certain things easier.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Wasn't that hard on you?

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Do you regret it?

---
 

 
**Altria:**
Of course. It was difficult, and I had many failures.
Like anyone, my life had its ups and downs.

 
**Altria:**
Nevertheless, I am satisfied with my life.

 
**Altria:**
I lost my way many times, but in the end, I finally understood.

 
**Altria:**
Although I have hurt many, and failed to recognize many, I protected that which I held most dear to until the very end.

 
**Mash:**
...

 
**Altria:**
Oh dear, this is no place for long chats, is it?

 
**Altria:**
Master, your commands. Let us lift some small part of the curse that infects this land!

 
**--BATTLE--:**
 
**Altria:**
Thank you for accepting my wish to see Fuyuki.

 
**Altria:**
Let us return to Chaldea, Master. I'm sure there are other matters we should be attending now.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Yes, of course.

 
**Mash:**
Just a moment.
You haven't finished your story.

 
---

**Fujimaru 2:**
...Before we go, tell us one more thing.

 
**Altria:**
One more thing?

---

 
**Altria:**
Of course, I told you how I became a king, but I haven't told you why.

 
**Altria:**
My aspiration to be king despite being a woman.
...And for what reasons did I fight?

 
**Altria:**
However, it is a simple, trivial matter. I am sure it is the same as you, dear Fujimaru.

 
**Altria:**
I did not fight for ideals.
I fought for the future.

 
**Altria:**
One that everyone wishes for, everyone desires for. My hand reached for this sword to protect that.

 
**Altria:**
I am not sure if I did a good job.
But I did my best and laid down my life for that dream.

 
**Mash:**
...You have no regrets for how your life ended as King Arthur?

 
**Altria:**
I have some disappointments, but no regrets.

 
**Altria:**
My battle was not the correct salvation for everything&mdash;But I am certain it wasn't a mistake.

 
**Altria:**
From this point forward it is your battle, Master.
I swear on my sword, I will be there to assist you.


## Awakening of the Holy Sword
**Altria:**
...Hm.
This area should serve our needs well.

 
**Altria:**
No one in sight, no buildings either. I don't think there will be casualties no matter what happens here.

 
**Altria:**
&mdash;Aside from us participants, of course.

 
**Mash:**
...Um, Senpai ...Altria is sounding very ominous.
What do you think she plans to do this time?

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I don't know.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
She brought us here without explanation...

---
 

 
**Altria:**
Now then, first I must thank you Master.
You listened to another unreasonable request from me.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Well, you did ask to go to a deserted wasteland out of the blue. What did you need Fujimaru for?

 
**Altria:**
Yes. I thought I might carry out a plan that I have been considering for a while.

 
**Altria:**
As more Heroic Spirits are assisting Chaldea, our battles are also growing proportionally fiercer.

 
**Altria:**
To be honest, don't you feel we are currently ill-equipped? Since we don't know what we'll run into in the future.

 
**Mash:**
Well...yes. As a defense specialist, it's not my place to say, but I'm not sure we'll last with our current firepower.

 
**Altria:**
I thought so.
Which is why I think it's time for me to be serious.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
What!
You mean you weren't fighting seriously until now?

 
**Altria:**
I have been fighting seriously, but with limitation.

 
**Altria:**
My sword is, shall we say, complicated in its workings.

 
**Altria:**
For example, it must not strike one pure of heart.
I also must not strike a fairy.

 
**Altria:**
Such are the multiple oaths of this sword. If any are violated, the power of my Mana Burst is reduced.

 
**Mash:**
Something like a dress code, perhaps.

 
**Mash:**
So what you're saying is, your sword has never been fully unleashed?

 
**Altria:**
Yes. A strike with all of its oaths released will probably be an once in a lifetime event.

 
**Altria:**
I'm not even sure if we'll even get such a chance, but for now, I would like to release some of the oathes to raise its output.

 
**Altria:**
That's the reason I brought you to this place Fujimaru.

 
**Altria:**
"Anyone who fights at my side must be courageous"&mdash;In order to fulfil this oath.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
...In other words, if your Master is weak,
your sword won't be at its full potential?

 
**Altria:**
In this case, it means strength of spirit, not body.
Does this person possess the courage to face someone stronger.

 
**Altria:**
The sacred sword scales to the strength of a Master's heart. With that being said&mdash;

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Wh-What's with all this magical energy!
Saber, what are you doing?

 
**Altria:**
I am summoning a demon that I once struck down and sealed away. Is there a problem?

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Don't tell me!?

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Impossible!

---
 

 
**Mash:**
This amount of energy is on par with a Dragonkin...
Senpai and I can't possibly handle that now!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Why would you do that? I don't remember King Arthur being capable of spells like that!

 
**Altria:**
Oh that, I discussed it with Ms. Leonardo and had her provide me with an instant scroll.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Da Vinnnnnci!

 
**Altria:**
Now's the time to show our courage, Master!
Let's overcome this danger together!

 
**Mash:**
The King ended up being a nutcase!
S-Senpai, what should we do?

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Looks like our only option is to fight!

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Ok, hit me with your best shot!

---
 

 
**Mash:**
How can this be?
My Master is the same kind of person as Saber!


**--BATTLE--:**

**Mash:**
Whew...
We managed...somehow...

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Wow, what a spectacular victory you two... Wasn't that a bit more powerful than a weaker Demon God?

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I'm exhausted...

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I thought we were goners...

---
 

 
**Mash:**
Still, one of the conditions has been cleared.
So I guess it was worth the effort?

 
**Altria:**
Rest time is over.
What are you two doing? More enemies are coming.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
There's a second army? Just how crazy was the Britain under King Arthur's name!

 
**Mash:**
Grr! I'm at the end of my rope!
Saber, this is the last one right?

 
**Altria:**
Yes, this is the last. Not to worry,
they aren't much different than the previous ones.

 
**--BATTLE--:**

**Mash:**
Whew... Yikes, twin demons...
But this should be the...

 
**Mash:**
Oh, come on!
Saber, are you serious?

 
**Altria:**
Hm? Oh...My apologies, I wasn't clear enough.
What I meant was, those were the last "demons."

 
**Altria:**
This time for sure, these are the last enemies we must defeat. We just need to deal with the Dragonkin who serve the demons.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
&mdash;Did you say...Dragonkin?

 
**Altria:**
Come, Master and Mash, now is the time to demonstrate your knowledge and valor! Worry not, if anyone can overcome this it is you!

 
**Mash:**
U-Unwarranted trust can sometimes hit harder than a blow from a dragon, Senpai!


**--BATTLE--:**

**Mash:**
&mdash;

 
**Dr. Roman:**
I can't believe we had to fight a powerful Phantasmal in a wasteland like this for no particular reason.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Mash, Fujimaru, well done...
I can imagine how tired you must be...

 
**Altria:**
What are you so depressed for?
Now is the time to raise a victory shout.

 
**Altria:**
By your own hand, you have proven that you are without limits.

 
**Altria:**
As the Servant who serves you, nothing could make me more proud.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Y-You really mean it?

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
You're proud, Saber?

---
 

 
**Altria:**
Yes. We Servants are not...
interested in our own strength.

 
**Mash:**
(She said, "very" in a small voice, Senpai.)

 
**Altria:**
Ahem. Mash, please keep that to yourself.

 
**Altria:**
In a sense, Heroic Spirits are beings who can see their end, their&mdash;final form. We each know our own strength.

 
**Altria:**
That is not true of you. Where will the humans living in your era find themselves in the end?

 
**Altria:**
How much will they grow? What heights will they reach?
To us Heroic Spirits, it is beyond our imagination.

 
**Altria:**
That is why I am proud that I met a Master such as you.

 
**Altria:**
...It is odd, though.
I feel as if something like this has happened before.

 
**Altria:**
Perhaps I will meet "someone" like you at some point.

 
**Altria:**
...I can be inspired by a Master I respect and love, even if they are inexperienced.

 
**Altria:**
However, this is not the time for that.
What I can do is to guide you to your final battle.

 
**Altria:**
Fujimaru, Master of Chaldea.
My sword has acknowledged your worth.

 
**Altria:**
I too, shall strive to serve you with more strength.
Let us continue to fight well together.

 
**Mash:**
Saber...

 
**Dr. Roman:**
We got King Arthur's stamp of approval...
Plus, we got an upgrade on her Noble Phantasm...

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Let's keep fighting the good fight, Saber.

 
**Altria:**
Yes, please use the increased strength of my Noble Phantasm as your secret weapon against powerful enemies.

 
---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Refrain from any crazy stuff next time, Saber.

 
**Altria:**
Y-You think so?
I thought that the ends justified the means.

 
**Altria:**
Judging from Mash's exhaustion, I see that perhaps I did go too far. Very well, I shall be more careful from now on!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
She doesn't get it...
This king just doesn't get it!
