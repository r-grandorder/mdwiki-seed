# Lord El Melloi II - Zhuge Liang

## Heroic Spirit Possession

**El-Melloi II:**
Oh! Speaking of which, I haven't introduced myself.
I am Lord El-Melloi II.

 
**El-Melloi II:**
I am a mere human, who became the Spirit Origin of a famous strategist from the Three Kingdom Period in China.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Lord?
 
**El-Melloi II:**
What, don't you know?
What kind of manuals did Animusphere make...

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
The Second?
 
**El-Melloi II:**
Right. I was originally a third-rate noble from the countryside. For certain reasons, I took after my mentor and inherited his name.

 


---
 
**Mash:**
Excuse me, Lord El-Melloi II. When you say Lord,
do you mean the "Lord" of the Mage's Association?

 
**El-Melloi II:**
Yes. I represent one of the twelve noble families that operate the Clock Tower, the center of the Mage's Association. The lowest-ranked, though.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Did you know Director Olga Marie?
What time period are you from, anyway?

 
**El-Melloi II:**
Same as Fujimaru, I'm from the 21st century. Before I knew it, I became a Pseudo-Servant.

 
**Mash:**
A Pseudo-Servant...like me. Are you someone that was empowered by Heroic Spirits?

 
**El-Melloi II:**
...The result was the same but the idea's different.
There's nobody identical to you in this time.

 
**El-Melloi II:**
Originally, it's impossible to form a Demi-Servant.
Just the same as it's impossible for Dhampir to be born among vampires.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
As I'd expect of a Clock Tower mage, you probably understand the logic behind the impossible.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
That's right. Mash is an extremely unique example of success. It'd be hard to recreate an accident.

 
**El-Melloi II:**
I'm glad to hear that. I would've suggested an immediate dismantling of Chaldea if it was such a screwed-up organization.

 
**Mash:**
...

 
**Fou:**
Fou, Fooou!

 
**El-Melloi II:**
...Sorry, that was insensitive of me. You aren't guilty of anything, ma'am. I would like to correct myself.

 
**Mash:**
W-Well, you cannot deny that creating Demi-Servants was an inhumane experiment.

 
**Mash:**
Your feeling of disgust is justified, Lord El-Melloi.
Even more so if it comes from justice and morals.

 
**Mash:**
That aside, please continue your explanation.
What are Pseudo-Servants?

 
**El-Melloi II:**
Ah, yes.
I shall answer that question.

 
**El-Melloi II:**
A Pseudo-Servant is someone possessed by a Heroic Spirit. Those Heroic Spirits who can't become a Servant...

 
**El-Melloi II:**
Perhaps they are higher beings like Divine Spirits, or their Spirit Origins can't be created by Chaldea.

 
**El-Melloi II:**
In order to summon them as Servants, human vessels are sometimes used.

 
**El-Melloi II:**
That is what a Pseudo-Servant is. Using a human body as catalyst to forcefully summon a Heroic Spirit.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
??
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
?????
 


---
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Oh-uh, Fujimaru looks confused.
Obviously since it's a particularly unique case, right?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
In short, it's someone being possessed by a ghost.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Then the psyche of the possessed is overwritten by the Heroic Spirit...

 
**El-Melloi II:**
I'm the opposite. I took only the role of Zhuge Liang,
because western logic doesn't match eastern logic.

 
**El-Melloi II:**
But with the greater good of protecting humanity in mind, we share a common goal.

 
**El-Melloi II:**
That's why after a discussion with the Strategist on who should control the body, I ended up staying because of my knowledge of modern eras.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
I see. That's very much Zhuge Liang.
Just like what he did at the end of his life.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
The important thing was for someone to execute his strategies, without participating on it...

 
**Dr. Roman:**
In other words, he found the one capable of his strategies, so he decided not to appear.

 
**El-Melloi II:**
That's right. We've only talked for a bit, but it's obvious he's more of a monster than history described. I didn't feel like I was talking to a human.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...Can you fight?
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
...You're just a human?
 


---
 
**Fou:**
Fou, Fooou.

 
**El-Melloi II:**
I would've been incinerated if I was just a human.

 
**El-Melloi II:**
By becoming one with the Heroic Spirits, I temporarily became a Servant.

 
**El-Melloi II:**
Follow me.
I will show you proof.

 
**El-Melloi II:**
Around here is fine.
Enemy approaching. Prepare for battle.

 
**El-Melloi II:**
You will immediately see if I can fight as a Servant.

 
**El-Melloi II:**
In turn, I will assess your potential as a Master.
Kill two birds with one stone, right?

 
**Monster:**
Gaooooooooooooo&mdash;!

 
**Mash:**
They're already pumped up!
What did you do, Lord El-Melloi?

 
**El-Melloi II:**
Well, this will be interesting.
I used some pheromones to excite them.

 
**El-Melloi II:**
Be careful when you fight, ma'am. The enemy is on a rampage. Don't let your guard down.

 
**Mash:**
Master!
I think he's gone too far with his logic!


**--BATTLE--:**

**Dr. Roman:**
The enemy response is still spreading!
It's massive. Just how excited are they!

 
**Mash:**
This is no time to be in awe, Doctor!
Do something!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Sorry, there's nothing I can do beside scanning the area... You just have handle it by yourselves.

 
**Mash:**
Got it!
It means I can only rely on Senpai, right!?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Sorry Doc. Let's do this, Mash!
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Same as usual. Let's do this, Mash!
 


---
 
**El-Melloi II:**
I see. Aren't you a courageous one?
No plans, but you sure got guts.

 
**El-Melloi II:**
Humph&mdash;Not bad at all.

 
**El-Melloi II:**
You remind me of myself in the past.
If that's the case, "I" shall show my true strength.

 
**El-Melloi II:**
Of course, this is merely on the path of me reaching him.
But it seems this will be a fruitful contract.


**--BATTLE--:**

**Mash:**
The battle is over...
You know...I'm three times more...tired than usual...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Good job, Mash.
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
...It was a disaster, huh?
 


---
 
**Fou:**
Foou!

 
**Mash:**
I'm relieved that you and Fou...both made it...

 
**Mash:**
Those wild beasts had their eyes on the two of you, I was doing everything I can...

 
**Fou:**
Fou!?

 
**El-Melloi II:**
You're done?
So how did I do, Fujimaru? Did I pass?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You've convinced me.
 
**El-Melloi II:**
That's good.
I'm finished assessing you too.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
That's not fair, you can fight as a human.
 
**El-Melloi II:**
Not fair? Oh I see, you mean comparing to you? So you're jealous that I can fight on the front line despite being a human.

 
**El-Melloi II:**
Cherish what you're feeling now. Because it requires strength to withstand that feeling of powerlessness.

 


---
 
**El-Melloi II:**
As you can see, I can fight as a Servant.
You might be unsatisfied with my firepower, but I will make up with my intellect.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Oh. He's definitely a first-rate Servant. I mean all Pseudo-Servants are exceptional cases to begin with.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Fujimaru, eventually you'll be able to meet a Pseudo-Servant who fused with a god, I think.

 
**El-Melloi II:**
Probably...Well, I am a special case.

 
**El-Melloi II:**
Most vessels chosen to become Pseudo-Servants...
in other words, mages, already possess powers.

 
**El-Melloi II:**
And when Heroic Spirits possess humans, they will choose those who closely resemble themselves. So of course they are powerful.

 
**El-Melloi II:**
Those integrated will then transmigrate into a third personality, a new personality if you will.

 
**El-Melloi II:**
Those kinds of Servants are troublesome.
After all, they tend to think like Divine Spirits.

 
**El-Melloi II:**
They will probably be completely selfish and ask for all kinds of impossible things.

 
**El-Melloi II:**
Then you'll know that I'm one of the better ones.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Hahaha...Well, let's save that for the future.
Good job, Mash, Fujimaru.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Come home with Mr. El-Melloi II.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
I couldn't fight with you, but I can welcome you home with a warm cup of tea.


## Endless Sea

**El-Melloi II:**
...

 
**Mash:**
(Senpai, Mr. El-Melloi seems off.
I know he looks irritable all the time, but now...)

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Is he looking at the sea?
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
He's looking at the sunset?
 


---
 
**Fou:**
Fou, fou.

 
**El-Melloi II:**
...So.

 
**El-Melloi II:**
Ma'am. If you're going to hide, at least put down your shield. Anyone will notice a black steel wall on the beach.

 
**El-Melloi II:**
You too Fujimaru.
As her Master you should've pointed that out.

 
**Mash:**
S-Sorry.
It seemed like you wanted to be left alone...

 
**Fou:**
Nnnng...kyau, kyaaaau!

 
**El-Melloi II:**
Nothing, I was just looking at the sea.
I heard it was named Okeanos due to the Grail.

 
**El-Melloi II:**
But it's just a name. It's a horizon as far as you can see, but the edges simply adhere to each other.

 
**El-Melloi II:**
Just like a scroll. A sea enclosed in all directions that perpetually revolves around the same area.

 
**El-Melloi II:**
You can sail it endlessly, but in truth,
it's just a clipped miniature garden. How absurd.

 
**El-Melloi II:**
This is not the place I set out to reach.
Not even close to the real Okeanos.

 
**Mash:**
You wanted to reach Okeanos?
Are those the words of Zhuge Liang?

 
**El-Melloi II:**
...Hmph, those are my words. Watch your mouth.
It appears I got too sentimental.

 
**El-Melloi II:**
It was a dream. One that I had when I was younger.
All the experience I've gained was to further that goal.

 
**El-Melloi II:**
I didn't become what I am now naturally.
I was an average mage.

 
**El-Melloi II:**
Taking on that troublesome teaching position, inheriting the name of El-Melloi, refining my third-rate magical circuit, it's all because&mdash;

 
**El-Melloi II:**
I wanted to become the ideal I yearned for when I was young. Now, I'm just a crooked old mage.

 
**Mash:**
A crooked mage...you?
Even though you are a first-class mage?

 
**El-Melloi II:**
Only my position is first-class. My ability as a mage isn't much different from Fujimaru.

 
**El-Melloi II:**
I somehow managed to keep up with those first-class monsters with my knowledge and preparations.

 
**El-Melloi II:**
Dr. Roman can see through that too. Whatever you say about that guy, he's a natural at talent assessment.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...You didn't reach your ideal?
 
**El-Melloi II:**
Stop with your nonsense. I did reach it.
That's why I'm like this, right?

 
**El-Melloi II:**
I reached my ideal, just not the natural way.
It's a bit harder every day, and it's killing my stomach.

 
**El-Melloi II:**
You need to remember, Fujimaru. With strong convictions and desires, you can reach your ideal.

 
**El-Melloi II:**
It's a rough path for an ordinary person. You'll reach your ideal but lose your way of life in the process.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
...You couldn't reach Okeanos?
 
**El-Melloi II:**
Well, I haven't started the journey yet.
I'm just not ready to reach the endless sea.

 


---
 
**Fou:**
Fou, Foou!

 
**Mash:**
What's in the forest, Fou?
Master, Lord, enemy sighted!

 
**El-Melloi II:**
Geez.
No time for fond memories huh?

 
**El-Melloi II:**
&mdash;It's about to begin, Master.
Let's see how much you've grown.


**--BATTLE--:**

**El-Melloi II:**
Didn't even break a sweat. You don't consider them enemies anymore, huh?

 
**El-Melloi II:**
...Hmm, growth as a mage is unlikely, but it looks like you're gaining experience as a Master.

 
**El-Melloi II:**
It's good to be diligent. All right,
I will give you this as a reward for your efforts.

 
**Mash:**
Is this...a jewel?
It appears to be an expensive Mystic Code...

 
**El-Melloi II:**
It's not. It's just a common protective ore.
On top of that, it's a used one from me.

 
**El-Melloi II:**
I pocketed it as a precaution when I was young, but I don't need it anymore.

 
**El-Melloi II:**
No one will acknowledge your effort anyway, right?
That's why I'm giving it to you as a reward.

 
**Fou:**
Fou, Foou!

 
**El-Melloi II:**
Hey, calm down there!
My student showed progress, it's natural!

 
**El-Melloi II:**
Look what you did! Now my expensive suit is ruined!
Not to mention that my hair is sticky from the sea breeze.

 
**El-Melloi II:**
I shouldn't have come to the beach.
Who's dumb enough to want to come here?

 
**Mash:**
Mr. El-Melloi just left...

 
**Mash:**
He must see his younger self when he looks at you, Senpai.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
In that case, I'm honored...
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
...I'm not that eccentric...
 


---
 
**Mash:**
Yes, here you go Senpai.
A gift from your teacher.

 
**Mash:**
He said that it was used, but I'm positive that he prepared it just for you.

 
**Mash:**
Let's fight and not give up! Let's meet our teacher's expectations!


## Truth of the Ascension

**Fou:**
Foou, Foou♪

 
**Mash:**
You look happy, Fou.
You really liked that lunch.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
It certainly was delicious.
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Everyone had different dishes.
 


---
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Today's cook was a Servant apparently. Which Heroic Spirit was it I wonder... Let's check the kitchen.

 
**???:**
Whoaaaaaaaa!?
Whaaa, What happened here?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Hmm? Seems like something happened.
Whose voice was that? It doesn't sound familiar.

 
**Mash:**
Is it an intruder? A mysterious object is approaching...
Contact in 3, 2, 1&mdash;

 
**Fou:**
Fou!

 
**???:**
Ouch!

 
**???:**
Ow...hey, why don't you look where you're going!
Don't stand in the middle of the road, idiot!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You're not allowed to run in the halls.
 
**???:**
Forgive me, it's an emergency! Anybody would run at mach speed in my position!

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
It's ok. You're so small it tickled.
 
**???:**
Well aren't you condescending?
Jerk!

 


---
 
**Mash:**
Excuse me. Who are you and why are you running like this? You don't look like a Chaldea staff.

 
**???:**
Oh...Well, you know I'm a...
Hey, isn't this Mash and Fujimaru?

 
**???:**
Good timing! Help me, you guys! We have to do something before anybody else sees me like this.

 
**Mash:**
?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
??

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
???
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
...Who are you?
 


---
 
**Fou:**
Fou?

 
**???:**
You can't tell!?
It's me, Wav...I mean, El-Melloi II!

 
**El-Melloi II(Young):**
I know it's strange, but I suddenly turned into my younger self!

 
**Mash:**
!!!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
No way!
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
You look totally different!
 


---
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Exactly!
I mean, your frame is completely different!

 
**El-Melloi II(Young):**
I'm telling the truth!
You and the Master should be able to tell, right?

 
**El-Melloi II(Young):**
Mash is a Servant! She should know!
I am El-Melloi II!

 
**Mash:**
Y-Yes... It comes as a surprise but he's telling the truth.
I mean, he's the same height as me.

 
**El-Melloi II(Young):**
Don't call me short! Oh, this is not the time to get hung up on words.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
How did this happen?
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Do you know the cause?
 


---
 
**El-Melloi II(Young):**
Of course, I have an idea.
It must be those ill-mannered goddesses, I'm sure!

 
**El-Melloi II(Young):**
Right, that's got to be it. I knew something was up when she brought me a present...

 
**El-Melloi II(Young):**
A show of gratitude my ass!
I don't remember meeting her at a cafe at all...

 
**El-Melloi II(Young):**
Anyway, we need to Rayshift now,
Fujimaru! Let's hurry and raid their base!

 
**Mash:**
...And so, we're back to this familiar scenery.
Is this...the "Shaped Isle?"

 
**El-Melloi II(Young):**
Actually, it's supposed to be the "Shapeless Isle" you know. Hey, wicked goddess! Come out!

 
**Stheno:**
Oh. Why, it's Fujimaru and Mash,
along with...Well, well, well.

 
**Stheno:**
You're so small I didn't realize you were there.
I see the Professor is with you too.

 
**Stheno:**
I welcome your unexpected visit here.
What gift did you bring me this time?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
...Her basic condition is receiving a gift.
This goddess never ceases to amaze me.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Sorry, I've come empty-handed.
 
**Stheno:**
That's too bad...but don't worry. Even though you brought me no gifts, I see you did bring me a fine toy&mdash;Ahem, ahem.

 
**Stheno:**
Such a fine and intelligent gentleman with you.
The ultimate ingredient to stave off boredom♡

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
...I will come again.
 
**El-Melloi II(Young):**
What do you mean, come again?

 
**El-Melloi II(Young):**
There isn't a thing on this Earth that would satisfy her as a present.

 
**El-Melloi II(Young):**
She's like Princess Kaguya in Japan. She makes unreasonable demands and enjoys messing with men.

 
**Stheno:**
What a terrible misunderstanding! Please don't take it seriously Fujimaru?

 


---
 
**Euryale:**
"Me." Hey "Me!" Where did you go?
Medusa comes back this afternoon...

 
**Euryale:**
Oh, is that Fujimaru?
Is Mash with you too?

 
**Euryale:**
What's this? You came to play? Good timing.
Today, our little sister is also&mdash;

 
**Euryale:**
Oh. What's that poor thing there? I thought he was one of the sand crabs, he's human?

 
**El-Melloi II(Young):**
Th-That's an unprecedented insult!
How can you make fun of people like it's nothing!

 
**El-Melloi II(Young):**
You know what, stop talking! Return me to my former self! Otherwise you won't hear the end of it from Fujimaru!

 
**Mash:**
(...Senpai, you're involved all of a sudden.
It's highly likely this will become your problem)

 
**Euryale:**
What? You're the one who showed up all of a sudden, what are you talking...

 
**Stheno:**
Shush. Be quiet, "me."
This is getting interesting.

 
**Stheno:**
&mdash;Ahem. I feel bad for your A-class Servant.
It's such a waste on you, Lord El-Melloi II.

 
**Stheno:**
Why don't you just keep growing young and start over as a baby again.

 
**Stheno:**
I am sure in a different future, the possibility of a more rosy life will be waiting for you.

 
**El-Melloi II(Young):**
That's it. I'm taking her down. Leaving her alive won't benefit this world, its people, and all men!

 
**Stheno:**
Oh my, how barbaric!

 
**Stheno:**
In every era, men have their selfish reasons to go after frail women, but...

 
**Stheno:**
Women these days are strong.
My self-defense measures are perfect.

 
**Stheno:**
Come forth protectors of this island.
Let's begin with some warm-ups&mdash;!


**--BATTLE--:**

**El-Melloi II(Young):**
Hmph, golems won't even be a threat, not to Fujimaru.

 
**El-Melloi II(Young):**
Is that all you've got?
Why don't you just give up and lift my curse.

 
**Euryale:**
...Now I'm pissed. "I" wanted to do this so I was just going to stand by and watch.

 
**Euryale:**
But you're mistaken if you think we'll allow some nameless brats like you to talk down to us like that.

 
**Euryale:**
I'll show you the technique that has made brave men cry. Is that ok, "me?"

 
**Stheno:**
Yeah. I guess we're left with no choice (grin).
Let's do this...

 
**Euryale:**
Cooooome, Meduuuuusaaaaaa!

 
**Medusa:**
My big sisters... Please stop summoning me like that.
I'm not some giant robot, you know...

 
**Euryale:**
Silence! Don't talk back to your sisters!
Anyway, that thing over there! That one!

 
**Euryale:**
That cheeky guy over there!
He dared to raise his hand against us!

 
**Stheno:**
That's right. Despite our hospitality to welcome him as a guest, he charged at us without saying a word!

 
**Mash:**
...I see.
Technically she's not lying.

 
**Medusa:**
...Hmm.
Is that true, sir?

 
**El-Melloi II(Young):**
Whoa. Isn't that Servant a bit too scary?
No, you're getting it wrong!

 
**El-Melloi II(Young):**
We came to talk! We only resorted to force because we weren't making progress!

 
**Mash:**
...Unfortunately, he's not lying either.

 
**Medusa:**
&mdash;All right, get ready. As punishment, I'm turning you to stone for one hundred years.

 
**Medusa:**
You'll be small for a statue... At least I can use you as a paperweight.

 
**El-Melloi II(Young):**
Hahaha, I see that Riders sure are professional at pressing all my buttons!

 
**El-Melloi II(Young):**
Now Fujimaru, I mean my Master!
Punish that giant for me!

 
**Medusa:**
...


**--BATTLE--:**

**Mash:**
Enemy Rider defeated.
...But, is this really a good reason to fight?

 
**Medusa:**
Damn...

 
**Euryale:**
Hey, that was sloppy Medusa.

 
**Euryale:**
You didn't go easy on him because he looks like a good kid, did you?

 
**Stheno:**
That's not it, "me."

 
**Stheno:**
Medusa isn't getting heavier and slower,
Fujimaru is getting stronger.

 
**Medusa:**
(...Not heavy...I'm not heavy, big sister...(tears))

 
**El-Melloi II(Young):**
Your secret weapon Medusa is no match for us by herself. This time, why don't you just&mdash;

 
**Stheno:**
What're you talking about? The real battle begins now.
Both Golems and Medusa couldn't finish the job...

 
**Stheno:**
In that case, we'll have to get serious. I'm sure we'll be forgiven for revealing that forbidden name.

 
**Medusa:**
Huh? No way, big sister.
You wouldn't!

 
**Euryale:**
I seeeee. You're right!
If it's come to this we have no choice but to use that!

 
**Euryale:**
Hmmmm. Get ready, you Monchhichi! Demon God of the Shapeless Isle, distinguished in Greek mythology&mdash;

 
**Euryale:**
The Demon God who flattened 100 brave men, the True Body of the Trinity Goddesses Gorgon.
We release you here and now!


**--BATTLE--:**

**Euryale:**
&mdash;Actually, there's no such thing as the True Body of Gorgon. Even if there was it wouldn't be introduced here.

 
**Medusa:**
(...Twice...Twice was I defeated for unknown reasons... Just how unfortunate can I be...)

 
**El-Melloi II(Young):**
Haha... You scared me for a moment.
Turns out it was just you three attacking together.

 
**El-Melloi II(Young):**
You're really out of ammunition now, right?
Just give up already and release me from this curse!

 
**Medusa:**
A curse... What is that?
Surely, my sisters didn't cause you any trouble...

 
**El-Melloi II(Young):**
Don't worry about it, I know you're always the victim.
Sorry about the rough treatment. Why don't you rest?

 
**El-Melloi II(Young):**
You two, Stheno and Euryale!
Get rid of this rejuvenation curse on me!

 
**Euryale:**
Rejuvenation? What's that?
That little runt there is&mdash;

 
**Stheno:**
Hehe. So "I" didn't realize after all.
That's Lord El-Melloi II himself.

 
**Stheno:**
For some reason, he's returned to his younger self.

 
**Euryale:**
No way! That handsome man used to look like that?
How much pain do you have to endure to grow into that?

 
**El-Melloi II(Young):**
That's my business. Leave me alone!
Wait, hold on. You didn't know?

 
**Euryale:**
Nope, I didn't know.
If I did, I would've teased you much more.

 
**El-Melloi II(Young):**
That means...
No way...

 
**Stheno:**
Yes, as you might expect, My Lord♡
We have nothing to do with it.

 
**El-Melloi II(Young):**
What&mdash;

 
**Mash:**
What&mdash;

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
What did you say?!
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Well, that's what I thought!
 


---
 
**El-Melloi II(Young):**
So, so, so, so what's the cause, then?
I can't think of any other external factors!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Well, then the answer is clear, isn't it? If there are no external factors, it just means your growth led to that body.

 
**Fou:**
Fou.

 
**Mash:**
It is a logical conclusion.
Your body got younger because of your Ascension.

 
**El-Melloi II(Young):**
That's... That's ridiculous...
Then it's pointless, isn't it?

 
**El-Melloi II(Young):**
Ascension is a reform to make one stronger!
Why would I revert to a form when I was immature?

 
**Stheno:**
For you, there are things you can only do in that form...

 
**Stheno:**
Rather, you can say that form is the "origin of all your concepts."

 
**Stheno:**
See, your ability as a Servant hasn't degraded one bit, right?

 
**Stheno:**
When you fight as a "main character," that form is the most powerful... Or most fitting.

 
**Stheno:**
You didn't even realize it...
How adorable can you get?

 
**Stheno:**
I ended up playing with you for a bit.
I received the best present to relieve my boredom♡

 
**El-Melloi II(Young):**
Ugh...Ughhh...Ughhhhhhhhh...
Again...Again, played by you!

 
**Stheno:**
But, it doesn't feel right to just keep taking from you...

 
**Stheno:**
If you play some more, I may be able to give you information about an elixir to turn you back, Lord El-Melloi.

 
**Mash:**
Oh... Let's go, Senpai.

 
**Mash:**
Lord El-Melloi is going into a battle that he'll never win.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
...Those who challenge Stheno will only end up being played by her and then disposed of...I shall be careful.

**Fujimaru 1:**
Let's go back to Chaldea.
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Good luck, Lord El-Melloi.
 


---
 
**El-Melloi II(Young):**
Oh. Let's go home then, damn it! Just you watch.
I'll be back to my original form in no time!
