# Helena Blavatsky

## The World that She Sees

**Paracelsus:**
From time to time...

 
**Paracelsus:**
From time to time, I wonder: do I fully comprehend the macrocosm of the three principles?

 
**Paracelsus:**
My theory that the universe corresponds to the anatomy of the human body...

 
**Paracelsus:**
Am I correct in this? If not, then my entire operating paradigm has been incorrect all this time.

 
**Helena:**
...Yep. You're right.

 
**Paracelsus:**
Although, such a thing can only be considered to be the world's truth.

 
**Paracelsus:**
As one who would know the Swirl of the Root, my idiotic agony must sound so trivial right now.

 
**Helena:**
...Yes. I'm sure that is true.

 
**Helena:**
I'm not sure myself, but I sense Mahatma from your words.

 
**Helena:**
That's why I'm rooting for you.
Good luck, Paracelsus!

 
**Paracelsus:**
Thank you very much, Helena Blavatsky.
You're brilliant.

 
**Sanzang:**
You know the phrase “protection of the Buddha”?
That's why I'm here...

 
**Sanzang:**
I'm sure you're under such protection too. Probably. In fact, I'd say it's thanks to this protection that Chaldea still exists!

 
**Sanzang:**
Even in the face of the Incineration of Humanity, we survived!

 
**Sanzang:**
That's why the Buddha is amazing.
My master was especially amazing.

 
**Sanzang:**
Not only am I able to borrow their palm heel, but they see and know everything. Beyond amazing, really.

 
**Sanzang:**
The compassionate and merciful Kannon is also beyond amazing. I've never seen anyone with more to offer.

 
**Sanzang:**
Yesterday, today, and even tomorrow...
The protection of the Buddha is forever!

 
**Sanzang:**
But you know, Wukong and Bajie didn't quite get it.

 
**Helena:**
...Oh really?

 
**Sanzang:**
Right after their vows, they went straight for some meat! In an instant! In a heartbeat!

 
**Sanzang:**
Wukong would say things like, “May the protection of the Buddha reach even my stomach!” That's not right! No!

 
**Helena:**
Uh-huh. I see.

 
**Helena:**
In many sects of Buddhism, the clergy is forbidden from eating meat, right?

 
**Helena:**
But then these disciples break such precepts immediately. Beyond annoying.

 
**Helena:**
On the other hand, I see that you are faithful to the Enlightened One's teachings, and I sense a high Mahatma from you. Good luck!

 
**Sanzang:**
Hee hee. You think so?
Okay. Let us both devote our lives to our faiths!

**Fujimaru 1:**
Mahatma...

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
What does that mean?
 


---
 
**Mash:**
Hello, Senpai.
I've been watching as you puzzled over this, but...

 
**Mash:**
I honestly don't know what she means when she says that.

 
**Mash:**
I do know that Mahatma was supposedly an existence of some kind that Helena mentioned often in her life.

 
**Mash:**
A spiritual existence of high order. They apparently imparted wisdom and truth through documents.

 
**Mash:**
And priestess figures who received such documents supposedly included Helena herself.

 
**C：Mash:**
...Details about Mahatma and their true form are a mystery. There is no mention about them in Chaldea's database, at least.

 
**C：Mash:**
Helena doesn't offer much in the way of detail on the subject, either.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
What's a Mahatma...?


---
 
**Helena:**
...Hm? You called?

 
**Mash:**
Oh. Hello, Helena.

 
**Helena:**
How do you do, Mash, Fujimaru?
Do you two want to know about Mahatma?

 
**Helena:**
Though you know... Hm... What shall I do?
I could have you read my book about it. But, hmmm...

 
**F：???:**
“The Secret Doctrine” is a book of mysteries that covers ancient and modern science and theology.

 
**Mash:**
That voice...

 
**Helena:**
Hey. Who's there?

 
**El-Melloi II:**
It's an important book, and serves as the foundation of modern occultism, but it's not the sort of work we mages should use.

 
**El-Melloi II:**
...Sorry for the intrusion. I just heard a familiar title and couldn't help but respond.

 
**Helena:**
So you've read my book!
Does that mean you feel Mahatma too?

 
**El-Melloi II:**
Of course I've read it. I see.
So you're THE Helena Blavatsky.

 
**El-Melloi II:**
I had hoped to meet and speak to you.
Miss, would you spare me some time?

 
**Helena:**
Of course!
I get it! You're a fan of mine!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
(Birds of a feather?)
 
**Mash:**
(You're right, Senpai.
It seems like they are getting along!)

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
(Incoming magecraft lecture.)
 
**Mash:**
(Perhaps.
I'm not sure if I can keep up...)

 


---
 
**El-Melloi II:**
What intrigues me is that much what you've said seems to contradict the teachings of Theosophy as a field.

 
**El-Melloi II:**
Theosophy as a field involves study and exploration. Its pursuit of the truth of the world and gods is similar to what we mages do...

 
**El-Melloi II:**
But it is still just an academic field.
It's not that Theosophy is similar to mages...

 
**El-Melloi II:**
But rather that mages are simply academics.

 
**El-Melloi II:**
Yet...

 
**El-Melloi II:**
Yet, you practice magecraft.
Even while you speak of Mahatma and the Hierarchy...

 
**El-Melloi II:**
You cast a variety of spells, using the archaic magecraft foundation that Theosophy claims does not exist.

 
**Helena:**
Eh? Y-you're right.
I do not feel Mahatma from that as much.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Huh?

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
She's changed her usual line...
 


---
 
**Mash:**
(Yes, this is a bit different for her...)

 
**El-Melloi II:**
...What exactly do your beliefs cover?

 
**El-Melloi II:**
Don't you think that the Theosophy that you speak of is making a mockery of the actual modern Theosophy?

 
**El-Melloi II:**
Unless...instead of Theosophy, it's your own talents you are mocking...

 
**Helena:**
...

 
**Helena:**
...

 
**Helena:**
U-unnnngh.
When you say it that way...

 
**Helena:**
It's true that I was the one who spread Theosophy to the modern world, but in broader terms, it was like a new kind of Platonism or Gnosticism...

 
**Helena:**
It included many things from the past, and in this case, it included Paracelsus's books too...

 
**Helena:**
I guess you can say it's my philosophy. But... But...

 
**Helena:**
The teachings really expanded during Adyarism or Yeats's time...

 
**Helena:**
...In other words...

 
**Helena:**
 
AFTER I DIED!

 
**El-Melloi II:**
M-my apologies.
I did not intend to anger you.

 
**Helena:**
You dummy! Why you... Why you...!
Lord El-Melloi II's a stupidhead!!!

 
**Helena:**
Stop tormenting me like the SPR!!! Waaaahh!!!

 
**El-Melloi II:**
N-no, I had no intention to...

 
**Helena:**
Waaaaaaaaahhhhhh!!!

 
**Mash:**
S-Senpai! The usually kind and mature Helena...is throwing a childlike tantrum!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I-I've never seen her so angry before!
 
**Mash:**
You may be right. Helena is normally the one to calm Edison and Tesla down...

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I like this side of her!
 
**Mash:**
 
Senpai!

 


---
 
**Alexander:**
Hm, what's going on, teacher?
Did you make a woman angry?

 
**Alexander:**
I never knew teacher was such a lady-killer.
Yeah... I'm curious about how you'll handle this.

 
**El-Melloi II:**
No, I...
Hm? What's that dark shadow behind you?

 
**Alexander:**
Oh this? It caught me back there.
I thought I got away, but it looks like it followed me here.

 
**Darius III:**
 
IS...KANDAR!!!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Hey, it's getting rowdy around here!
 
**Mash:**
It is, and now I sense danger!

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I have a bad feeling about this!
 
**Mash:**
Me too!

 


---
 
**Helena:**
... (Gasp!?)

 
**Helena:**
Wh-what is the meaning of this!? I can't believe you got so many people on your side! Explain yourself, Lord El-Melloi II!!!

 
**Helena:**
Well then, that means I'll have to...

 
**El-Melloi II:**
Um, no, please don't misunderstand, Lady Blavatsky. Please wait. That giant Servant is not on my side...

 
**Helena:**
Thanks for calling me a lady. But too late.
I've started up the Simulator.

 
**Helena:**
Come at me, Lord El-Melloi II!
You too, Alex and Mister Darius III!

 
**Helena:**
You're all going to get a taste of the power of Mahatma! Brace yourselves!!!

 
**Helena:**
Fujimaru and Mash!
You're on my side! Got it!?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Y-yes, ma'am!

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Shoulda seen this coming...
 


---
 
**Helena:**
LET'S. GO!

 
**Helena:**
...Lemuria slumbers in the seas! The Hierarchy graces the skies! And...

 
**Helena:**
And I! In the name of Mahatma... I'm going to let off steam!

 
**El-Melloi II:**
Wait, wait! Let off steam!?


**--BATTLE--:**

**Mash:**
Simulation battle, completed!
For the time being, Helena wins...

 
**Mash:**
But it seemed pretty clear that El-Melloi II was attempting to throw the match...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I'm tired...
 
**Mash:**
...I am too.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
W-well, all's well that ends well!
 
**Mash:**
Y-yes you're right.
I like your thinking, Senpai...

 


---
 
**Helena:**
(Sigh) ...I'm no good.

 
**Helena:**
I vowed to be nice, but sometimes I can't help but explode like that.

 
**Helena:**
Especially when I think of the time when the SPR called me a fraud.

 
**Helena:**
I'm sorry I gave in to my emotions, Mister.
I'm embarrassed to face Mahatma.

 
**El-Melloi II:**
No, I...

 
**Alexander:**
Hey, did you just say Mahatma, the great teacher?
Do you know Mahatma?

 
**Helena:**
Eh?

 
**Mash:**
Eh...

 
**Darius III:**
???

 
**El-Melloi II:**
...Wait. Are you telling us that you know what Mahatma is?

 
**Alexander:**
Well, yeah?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Really!?

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Uh, I'm not sure if that's true...
 


---
 
**Mash:**
(Y-yes, Senpai... Even though Alexander talks like he's familiar with it...)

 
**Mash:**
(Do you really believe Alexander knows what Mahatma is, when even El-Melloi II isn't sure himself?)

 
**Mash:**
(Although, Alexander did learn from Aristotle in Mieza...so it may be possible?)

 
**Mash:**
(Or perhaps, like Helena, he had a gifted mage nearby...)

 
**Helena:**
Seriously!? You know!?
Of Mahatma!?

 
**Alexander:**
Yep. I do.

 
**Helena:**
Oh my! That's amazing!
Well I...do sense strong Mahatma!!

 
**Edison:**
(...Is it over?)

 
**Nikola Tesla:**
(Hm. It would appear to be.)

 
**Nikola Tesla:**
(Yes, indeed it is over. She's laughing.
It appears our dear Helena is in a good mood now.)

 
**Edison:**
(Whew...even I thought the worst this time around.)

 
**Edison:**
(I was worried that fancy suit here triggered her by bringing up the times she was called a fraud, but it seems my fears were unfounded.)

 
**Nikola Tesla:**
(Yes. I thought the dimwit here complained about Helena's moving lab again. Evidently I was mistaken.)

 
**Edison:**
What did you say!?

 
**Nikola Tesla:**
Say that again, fool!

 
**Lion & Gentleman:**
(Oops...shhh...)

 
**Paracelsus:**
You are right.

 
**Paracelsus:**
It is not unusual for each mage to have their own unique usage of odd words and phrases.

 
**Paracelsus:**
For example, I use terms like “prima materia,” “transmutation product,” and “quinta essentia.”

 
**Paracelsus:**
In the world of alchemy, especially during my time, these words were not unique...

 
**Paracelsus:**
...but not all mages use them. Come to think of it, I believe the first founders of the Clock Tower likely used different terms.

 
**Paracelsus:**
That's why this is probably the same for her.

 
**Paracelsus:**
First off, there is no doubting her genius. Such people are generally misunderstood by the common masses.

 
**Paracelsus:**
The Mahatma that she speaks of...and what that means...

 
**Paracelsus:**
In order to truly understand, one would need to be on the same level as her.

 
**Paracelsus:**
Oh, and by the way, Master...

 
**Paracelsus:**
Apropos of nothing, I just happened to prepare an elixir...

 
**Paracelsus:**
It temporarily strengthens the limbic system, the cerebral nerves, and even magical circuits.

 
**Paracelsus:**
Would you like a sip?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
No thank you.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Nope! (Nope!)
 


---
 
**Paracelsus:**
...

 
**Medea:**
...You right there. Yes, you.

 
**Medea:**
Theosophy, was it? If that magecraft is what its name suggests, it must be a study of godly wisdom.

 
**Medea:**
It must be something that didn't originate in the Age of Gods, so I don't expect anything grandiose...

 
**Medea:**
But I don't mind it, Helena Blavatsky. I have a certain interest in those who strive to reach the gods.

 
**Helena:**
...Yes. Thank you, Medea.

 
**Medea:**
My magecraft was given to me by Hekate.
Calling them similar is probably off the mark.

 
**Medea:**
But I do believe it's closer than that of modern mages.
I sense yours is not obsessed with reaching the Root.

 
**Helena:**
...Um...

 
**Helena:**
Y-yes. Yep. You're probably right.
I do feel Mahatma from&mdash;

 
**Helena:**
...

 
**Helena:**
No, I'm sorry. Let me be honest with you, Medea.

 
**Medea:**
...?

 
**Helena:**
The Mahatma and Hierarchy that I have been sensing until today...

 
**Helena:**
I am not sure whether they are the same beings as the gods of the Age of Gods.

 
**Helena:**
I personally believe that true Mahatmas are the supernatural beings who have reached the Swirl of the Root, or at least have come in contact with the Root.

 
**Helena:**
Whether it would be appropriate to call them gods is something that I honestly cannot determine.

 
**Helena:**
...

 
**Helena:**
Hmm... I'm not experienced enough to recognize Mahatma and Divine Spirits properly.

 
**Helena:**
But... But... There's one thing I know for sure.

 
**Helena:**
Hekate. The Goddess Hekate...

 
**Helena:**
Possessing Authority over the earth, the sea, and the sky, who offered many blessings to those who prayed to her...

 
**Helena:**
I think she is one of the most distinguished deities in Greek mythology!

 
**Helena:**
Seriously. From the bottom of heart.
I sense tons of Mahatma!

 
**Medea:**
Heh. You make me blush.

 
**Medea:**
For you to honestly admit your own inexperience and foolishness is proof of your growth.

 
**Medea:**
Helena Blavatsky.
Let me grant you the gift of words.

 
**Medea:**
The wisdom of the gods... A small shard just for you.
