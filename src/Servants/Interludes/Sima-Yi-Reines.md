# Sima Yi (Reines)

## Lady Reines's Reminiscence

**???:**
There it is. Finally.

**???:**
Some of the details might be different, and they might actually use modern technology here, but it's still the same old Clock Tower methods at heart.

**???:**
I guess Flat didn't waste his time telling
me all about this stuff after all.

**???:**
Anyway, I'm relieved to see their old
security habits are the same as ever.

**???:**
Now, let's see what we've got.

**???:**
Requesting disclosure of Pseudo-Servant Research Data.

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Huh? Professor?


---

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Professor!


---

**Reines:**
...

**Reines:**
Fujimaru, was it?

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Y-yeah...


---

**Reines:**
Recognizing speaker as Master Fujimaru.
What can I do for you, Master Fujimaru?

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Uh...


---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Are you feeling all right, Professor?

---

**Reines:**
...

**Reines:**
It would seem the jig is up.

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Huh!?


---

**Reines:**
#### Trimmau! Get back here!

**Reines:**
Damn, she got away!

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
If that's you, Professor, then who was that?


---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Since when do you have a twin!?

---

**Reines:**
Oh come on, you know who that was. That was Trimmau, aka Volumen Hydrargyrum, the El-Melloi family's ultimate Mystic Code.

**Reines:**
She's my personal weapon, computer, and all-purpose maid, and as you'd expect from an ultimate Mystic Code, she does a great job at all that stuff...

**Reines:**
But now, hahaha, she just up and ran away on me!

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Your Mystic Code...ran away?


---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Uh... How does a Mystic Code decide to run away?

---

**Reines:**
No need to say anything more. I might not look like it, but trust me, I'm embarrassed enough as it is.

---

Note: Male Master

**Reines:**
If you haven't yet learned to recognize when a fair
maiden is feeling ashamed, you really should.

---

Note: Female Master

**Reines:**
You know what it's like for a maiden to feel ashamed too, right?

---

**Reines:**
Anyway, now that I missed that chance to nab her...

**???:**

Aaaaaahhh!

**Reines:**
Well, that didn't take long!

**B：???:**
Pseudo-Servant detected.
Proceeding with data collection.

**El-Melloi II:**
What's the meaning of this, Trimmau!?

**Reines:**
Great. Just great.

**El-Melloi II:**
Reines!? Don't tell me you're behind this!

**Reines:**
Dammit, of all the people I hoped wouldn't find out about this! Wait. Were you writing essays in the cafeteria again?

**El-Melloi II:**
It's an old habit of mine! The words come more
easily when I've got something to munch on!

**El-Melloi II:**
Besides, the cafeteria's sandwiches are just too good. I can't resist them.

**Reines:**
Hahaha, I'd say the ones from the café on Druid Street would give them a run for their money, but I got it.

**Reines:**
Anyway, why're you still writing essays at all?
Did you forget you're a Servant now?

**El-Melloi II:**
I can't help it! When I make a new discovery, I can't relax until I've written it down for posterity!

**Reines:**
Fair enough. It's not like your obsessive tendencies are anything new at this point. Anyway, now that the Code's out of the bag, Brother, why don't you give me a hand getting it back in?

**B：???:**
Data collection obstacle detected. Initiating
ability-based obstacle elimination procedure.

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Did it just duplicate itself!?


---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Now it's pretending to be Ishtar and Par!?

---

**Reines:**
Volumen Hydrargyrum only imitates outer appearances.
I should be able to get it back once it's defeated.

**Reines:**
On that note, since Trimmau isn't with me I'm sitting this one out, so I'm counting on you two to beat her instead. Good luck!

**El-Melloi II:**
What have you pulled me into now!?

**--BATTLE--**

**Reines:**
Yup, this is definitely London.

**El-Melloi II:**
And based on the local architecture, it would seem the nineteenth-century setting was accurate as well.

**El-Melloi II:**
I don't see any other people around...
Is that part of the settings, too?

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Why would the Volumen Hydrargyrum come here?


---

**Reines:**
Hmm. I have no idea.

**Reines:**
Aside from the lack of people, there doesn't seem to be anything strange or out of place.

**El-Melloi II:**
What's your tracking spell say?

**Reines:**
Thanks to that bit I gathered earlier,
I was able to get Trimmau's coordinates.

**Reines:**
But it's still going to take a little time to find her.

**El-Melloi II:**
Then it seems now would be a good time for you
to tell us more about this research of yours.

**Reines:**
Damn, so you didn't forget about that, huh?

**Reines:**
Basically, like I said before, it boils down to how we can take advantage of Pseudo-Servants' unique characteristics.

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Like what?


---

**Reines:**
Most Servants never grow or change.

**Reines:**
And why would they? They're all dead, after all.

**Reines:**
The moment they're inscribed in the Throne and given
a Servant class, their form is pretty much set in stone.

**Reines:**
They can level up, sure, but that's really just a way of showing how close they are to their true capabilities.

**Reines:**
But the same isn't true for us Pseudo-Servants, is it?

**El-Melloi II:**
...

**Reines:**
We're simultaneously dead, yet not dead.
Alive, and not alive.

**El-Melloi II:**
I see. So that's where the Volumen Hydrargyrum comes in. It belongs to you, not Sima Yi.

**Reines:**
Exactly. I figured if I played my cards right,
I could find a way to boost my combat capabilities.

**Sima Yi:**
And I thought the same,
which is why I decided to help investigate this idea.

**Sima Yi:**
Specifically, I was adjusting the data to better acclimate the Volumen Hydrargyrum to my own Spirit Origin.

**Sima Yi:**
Both the Volumen Hydrargyrum and Lady Reines are old hands at that sort of tweaking, so if all goes well, it should unlock some new possibilities.

**El-Melloi II:**
I can't tell if that sounds more like something you
would do, or something Lord Sima Yi would do...
Either way, that's no exploit. That's an out-and-out
cheat!

**Reines:**
Huh, I'm surprised you disapprove, Brother.
I thought you liked video games.

**El-Melloi II:**
Video games are designed with their own respective rules, and those rules need to be followed.

**El-Melloi II:**
One careless move, and you could end up destroying your entire Spirit Origin!

**El-Melloi II:**
Please, Lord Sima Yi, try to talk some sense into&ndash;

**Da Vinci:**
Heeey! Can you guys hear me?

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Da Vinci!


---

**Da Vinci:**
I saw the simulator was booted up all of a sudden.
Is something wrong?

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Well...


---

**Fujimaru 2:**
My professor, uh...

---

**Reines:**
Wait, wait! I'll explain that part!

**Da Vinci:**
Now I see. I'm surprised that Volumen Hydrargyrum
would run amok on her own like that.

**Reines:**
I must have made a mistake with one of her settings or something. Believe me, I feel very silly.

**Reines:**
(Let's just keep the fact that I was hacking into
Chaldea's database between you, me, and my brother, okay?)

**Da Vinci:**
Hmm...

**Da Vinci:**
Okay, got it. Now that I know what's going on,
I'll keep an eye on all your vitals from here, too.

**Reines:**
(Phew. That was too close...)

**El-Melloi II:**
It looks like your tracking spell is reacting again.

**Reines:**
Hmm. She's south of here, near Regent's Park.

**Reines:**
Come on, we'd better hurry.

**Reines:**
Ooh, a fish-and-chips stand.
Damn if it doesn't smell good.

**Reines:**
Go buy me some, will you, pupil?

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Didn't you just say we should hurry?

**El-Melloi II:**
Hm? I see the stand,
but I don't see anyone working it...


---

**Fujimaru 2:**
It does smell good, but aren't we kind of busy now?

**Reines:**
That's exactly why we need a snack to keep our energy
up. ...Never mind. There's no one working it.


---

**Reines:**
Hmm. Maybe this is another odd simulator setting? Then again, it really seems as though someone was cooking here just a few minutes ago.

**Reines:**
Maybe they're doing their best Mary Celeste crew impression?

**Reines:**
Mmm, I'll have to really pour on the vinegar to tamp down the delicious smell this freshly fried fish is putting out.

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You're already digging in!?


---

**Reines:**
Hahaha, I'm just showing the food its due respect.
Mmm, yum! It's piping hot and perfectly flaky!

**Reines:**
I can taste the delicious oils with every bite of fish!
And these steaming hot chips are salted perfectly!

**Reines:**
If this stand's proprietor were here,
I'd be breaking out my Reines Stamp of Approval.

**Reines:**
...Hm?

**Reines:**
What the...!?

**--BATTLE--**

**Reines:**
Now I see. Part of Trimmau got into the automated defense systems! And here I thought it was my comeuppance for dine and dashing!

**El-Melloi II:**
Hold it, Reines.

**El-Melloi II:**
Does that mean Trimmau has control
over the simulator itself?

**El-Melloi II:**
How much of her do you have now?

**Reines:**
Let me see... This just makes forty percent.

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Forty percent, huh.


---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I guess that means the main unit is still somewhere else then?

---

**El-Melloi II:**
I knew there had to be more than an odd simulator
setting behind the lack of people here.

**El-Melloi II:**
My Unreturning Formation isn't working right, either.

**Reines:**
You mean Zhuge Liang's famous maneuver?

**El-Melloi II:**
Things might look normal here, but there's something
going on right beneath the surface.

**El-Melloi II:**
It almost feels like a loading screen from a video game...

**Reines:**
My tracking spell!
There you are, Trimmau!

**Reines:**
Huh? It can't be...

**El-Melloi II:**
Reines! Fujimaru!!!

**--ARROW--**

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I'm back in my room?


---

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Does that mean the simulation is over!?


---

**El-Melloi II:**
No, it isn't. Take a closer look, Master.

**El-Melloi II:**
This is the old Chaldea. I'm sure of it.

**Reines:**
No, that's not quite right either, Brother.

**Reines:**
Both my Mystic Eyes and the part of Trimmau I collected are reacting. We're definitely still in the simulator.

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
So, that means&ndash;


---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Then, this must be

---

**El-Melloi II:**
I see. So we're in a simulation of the old Chaldea!

**El-Melloi II:**
Da Vinci, can you still hear us?

**El-Melloi II:**
I think we can take the silence as a no. Damn.

**Reines:**
Brother, you said that London reminded
you of a loading screen, right?

**Reines:**
What if that was a fake out, and Trimmau's real goal was to simulate the old Chaldea?

**El-Melloi II:**
...If it is, that would explain why she infiltrated the automatic defense systems.

**El-Melloi II:**
I see. So she put up that London as a front while she was secretly building this simulation behind the scenes.

**El-Melloi II:**
But even if she is going haywire right now, I still don't understand why Trimmau would go to such lengths...

**P.A. System:**
Authenticating... Error...
Reattempting authentication... Error...

**P.A. System:**
Authentication attempt limit reached. Locking
system... Lockdown protocol halted by root user...

**P.A. System:**
Authenticating... Error...
Reattempting authentication... Error...

**Reines:**
What the hell?

**El-Melloi II:**
It looks like Trimmau's trying to hack into the system. But this... Wait. That's it.

**El-Melloi II:**
Reines.

**Reines:**
Yes, Brother?

**El-Melloi II:**
You saw the last thing Trimmau turned
into back in London, right?

**Reines:**
...Yeah, I did.

**El-Melloi II:**
Do you know who it was?

**El-Melloi II:**
Because if it was who I think it was,
she's someone Fujimaru knows, too.

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Someone I know?

**El-Melloi II:**
That's right. Someone with deep ties to the old Chaldea. Give it some thought, and I think you'll know who I mean.


---

**Fujimaru 2:**
You don't mean...

**El-Melloi II:**
So you figured it out, huh? Makes sense.
I'm sure you knew her a lot better than I did.


---

**Reines:**
It was Chaldea's former director,
Olga Marie Animusphere.

**--ARROW--**

**El-Melloi II:**
Looks like we managed to avoid any obstructions.

**El-Melloi II:**
Are you two ready?

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Olga Marie!


---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Director!


---

**Reines:**
...

**Reines:**
Hi, Trimmau. Sorry I took so long.

**El-Melloi II:**
The only reason Trimmau went haywire
is because she's working properly.

**Reines:**
Huh? What do you mean?

**El-Melloi II:**
Exactly what I said. Trimmau ended up like this
because she was carrying out your orders.

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You ordered her to do this, Professor?


---

**El-Melloi II:**
We had it backwards.

**El-Melloi II:**
You said you couldn't get into the
central sector's data, right?

**El-Melloi II:**
In other words, Trimmau wasn't able to break
through the new Chaldea's security.

**El-Melloi II:**
So in response, she made a place where
she might be able to: the old Chaldea.

**El-Melloi II:**
Instead of trying to get past the new security measures...

**El-Melloi II:**
...she decided to use the simulator to create
a route where she could get past the old ones.

**Reines:**
No way...!

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Is it even possible to bypass security that way?


---

**El-Melloi II:**
It depends, but it wouldn't be the first time this kind of scam has worked, either with magecraft or computers.

**Reines:**
I see. So if there's a flaw in the simulator's security, she might be able to use that to gain access.

**El-Melloi II:**
Whether that's actually the case or not, it must be what Trimmau was thinking when she did all this.

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Mystic Codes can think?


---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Can Mystic Codes really think like that?

---

**Reines:**
Trimmau can. We had Flat help make her personality.

**Reines:**
Oh, Flat was one of Brother's pupils, by the way. The El-Melloi class was actually pretty popular, believe it or not.

**El-Melloi II:**
Was that last part really necessary? Anyway, I can
assure you that Trimmau's thought processes are
impossibly flexible compared to those of standard AI.

**El-Melloi II:**
Unfortunately, if she's going haywire now, that also means there's no telling what she might try next.

**El-Melloi II:**
We'll need to be very careful.

**Reines:**
Well? Come on, Trimmau, say something!

**Olga Marie?:**
...

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You're sure she's actually the Volumen Hydrargyrum, right?


---

**Fujimaru 2:**
You're sure that's not really Director Olga Marie, right?

---

**El-Melloi II:**
Positive. I'm also sure you know
that just as well as I do.

**El-Melloi II:**
She's what Reines was hiding.

**El-Melloi II:**
There's something you're still not telling us,
isn't there?

**El-Melloi II:**
Yes, you were in an important position at the Clock Tower, and you do know a lot about high-level security.

**El-Melloi II:**
But that doesn't mean you can just breeze past Chaldea's security measures like they're nothing.

**El-Melloi II:**
Which means there's something else you're keeping
from us that allowed Trimmau to get through.

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
What's that?


---

**El-Melloi II:**
I'll tell you. Reines here didn't just know how Chaldea's security was set up.

**El-Melloi II:**
She also knew Olga Marie's habits from her own world.
Didn't you?

**Reines:**
Haha, well this is embarrassing.

**Reines:**
There are a number of differences in this world, but
in my world, yes, Olga Marie and I were very close.

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Whoa! I had no idea!


---

**Fujimaru 2:**
You and Olga Marie, huh...


---

**Reines:**
Well, relatively close. As mages, we both had our share of secrets, so we couldn't open up that much.

**Reines:**
But, we were still close enough
to know each other's quirks...

**Reines:**
...and I could see them all over Chaldea's security.

**Reines:**
...Man, this brings back memories.

**Reines:**
As the next Lords in waiting for our respective families, you and I used to deceive each other all the time.

**Reines:**
And as mages from the same generation,
we also always had lots to talk about.

**El-Melloi II:**
Reines, this Olga Marie isn't&ndash;

**Reines:**
I know, Brother.
It's just a Volumen Hydrargyrum that looks like her.

**Reines:**
Besides, I never even knew this world's Olga Marie.

**Reines:**
I took a look at her file once, and she and my counterpart from this world's paths barely crossed at all.

**Reines:**
She never got on that train here,
nor did she ever take part in the Grand Roll with me.

**P.A. System:**
Authenticating... Error...
Reattempting authentication... Error...

**Reines:**
That's why I can't fully get through this Chaldea's security. The Marie I knew might look like the one from this world, but she's a completely different person.

**Reines:**
That's why I&ndash;

**Olga Marie?:**
Mage threat detected.
Eliminating.

**Reines:**
Ghh!

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Professor!


---

**Reines:**
Don't worry. I'm fine.
As I was saying...

**Reines:**
That's why I'm going to tear you apart.

**Reines:**
Seven holes are bored into primordial chaos. There are poisonous women to great men. Never is there a time when neither sun nor moon is set.

**Reines:**
Behold my tactics! Unspoken Formation...release!

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Release!?


---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Trimmau's back to normal!

---

**El-Melloi II:**
Now I see. Sima Yi's Noble Phantasm exposes an enemy's weakness, so Trimmau was imitating Olga Marie because she was Chaldea's weakness!

**Reines:**
Not exactly. I only meant for Trimmau to imitate Olga Marie's habits.

**Reines:**
I never planned for her to imitate Olga Marie herself.

**Reines:**
When she tried, she got stuck at imitating the Olga Marie I know, and now, here we are, trying to clean up the mess.

**Reines:**
And damn if it isn't a hot one. I could cry.

**Reines:**
Now she's imitating me! Well Trim, if you think you
can beat the real deal, you're sorely mistaken!

**El-Melloi II:**
Reines.

**El-Melloi II:**
I'm going to focus my skills entirely on you. You said this is your mess, right? Then clean it up yourself.

**Reines:**
...(Sigh) I swear, you're too damn lenient with
me for your own good sometimes, Brother.

**Reines:**
But I guess I can't blame you, seeing how adorable I am! Thanks, Brother! Just this once, I'll take you up on that!

**--BATTLE--**

**Trimmau:**
...Lady...Reines?

**Reines:**
Welcome back, Trimmau.

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Are you okay!?


---

**Reines:**
I'm fine. It's nothing.

**Reines:**
I just never expected to run into my
Servant karma here of all places.

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Servant karma?


---

**Reines:**
Well, maybe it's not karma so much as a weakness that
only Pseudo-Servants with their host's personality
intact are susceptible to.

**Reines:**
You know how Servants don't retain memories
of their past summonings, right?

**Reines:**
Exceptions to the rule aside, usually it's the person summoning the Servant who feels bad about being forgotten.

**Reines:**
But for Pseudo-Servants, we're the ones who remember, and have to deal with being forgotten.

**Reines:**
Obviously, the chances of running into someone we know are practically nonexistent, since we're in a world entirely different from our own and all.

**Reines:**
So even if we do happen to run into someone we know,
they end up being someone else entirely.

**Reines:**
So, yeah, it's painful.
Nothing I can't handle, but it still hurts.

**Reines:**
...But, maybe it's not all bad.

**Reines:**
Maybe this'll help me better understand
what it's like to be in your shoes.

**Reines:**
As a Master, you go through this sort of thing all the time, right? So I should probably learn to appreciate this pain.

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
It's not all pain.


---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I can at least tell you it's worth it.

---

**Trimmau:**
Initiating reboot.
Reboot complete.

**Reines:**
Whoa!

**Trimmau:**
I've been monitoring the situation.
I'm so sorry, Lady Reines.

**Reines:**
Don't be.
This was pretty much all my fault.

**Reines:**
I'm sorry, Trimmau.

**Reines:**
At least it looks like the experiment worked. I can tell you and my Spirit Origin are working together better now.

**Trimmau:**
Yes, Lady Reines. I can confirm a thirty-seven
percent increase in Spirit Origin output.

**El-Melloi II:**
Looks like the simulation's fading away
now that Trimmau's back to normal.

**Reines:**
Come on, you two. Let's get out of here.

**Reines:**
Phew. This latest caper really tuckered me out.

**El-Melloi II:**
Then get some sleep.

**El-Melloi II:**
If Jason is anything to go by,
even normal Servants can benefit from a good nap.

**El-Melloi II:**
As Pseudo-Servants,
we no doubt need proper rest even more than they do.

**Reines:**
Hmm. You make a pretty convincing case.

**Reines:**
Okay then, good night, Brother.

**El-Melloi II:**
Good night, Reines.

**A：???:**
Just a moment, El-Melloi II.

**El-Melloi II:**
...Lord Sima Yi.

**A：Sima Yi:**
Worry not. Lady Reines is fast asleep now,
so we can speak freely.

**A：Sima Yi:**
There's something I wished to discuss with you, something that's been nagging at me. In fact, it's something I noticed you purposely shied away from.

**El-Melloi II:**
What are you talking about?

**A：Sima Yi:**
The reason Trimmau went haywire in the first place.

**A：Sima Yi:**
She was making predictive calculations at a level
she could not even properly verbalize, correct?

**El-Melloi II:**
Because we need to know more about
the data Chaldea possesses?

**A：Sima Yi:**
Exactly. The Volumen Hydrargyrum calculated that data was a top priority, even if it meant she had to go haywire to process it.

**El-Melloi II:**
...

**A：Sima Yi:**
Of course, her efforts to do so ultimately proved to be for naught. Haha, I must say, this modern world has turned out to be much more enjoyable than I expected.

**A：Sima Yi:**
Oh, and one more thing. You should come out of hiding once in a while, you cowardly excuse for a tactician.

**A：Sima Yi:**
Your “gift” of women's clothing sent to taunt me is the whole reason I ended up inhabiting a woman's body, after all.

**El-Melloi II:**
...

**???:**
Tell it to someone who cares.
Besides, I'm enjoying this modern world plenty myself.

**El-Melloi II:**
...Huh?

**El-Melloi II:**
Did you just get Liang to rehash the time he sent you women's clothing to insult you as being weak for refusing to fight him?

**A：Sima Yi:**
I sure did. It only makes sense he would respond to me, no matter how deeply he may be lying dormant.

**A：Sima Yi:**
Such is the nature of our relationship.

**A：Sima Yi:**
Of course, I have my doubts as to whether he truly
thought women were synonymous with weakness or not.

**A：Sima Yi:**
At any rate, take care, Zhuge Liang.
I am sure we will see each other again someday.
