# Billy the Kid

## Seven Knights of the Wasteland

**Billy:**
This is a hypothetical question.

 
**Billy:**
Say you were asked to protect a town,
even if your chances of surviving were...uh, low.

 
**Billy:**
Tons of powerful, heavily armed enemies and you've got some scrounged up gear and just about no allies.

 
**Billy:**
Would you fight, even without a reward?
Or would you not?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Fight.
 
**Billy:**
Your bravery always impresses me.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Protect.
 
**Billy:**
Yeah, you always have the right answers.

 


---
 
**Billy:**
After you.

 
**Scoundrel:**
You bastard!

 
**Scoundrel:**
Oww...ow!
Damn...you...!

 
**Billy:**
With a hand that slow, nobody would hire you as a gunman.
Well, might as well do some honest work. Who knows, good things might happen!

 
**Mash:**
Look how he moves. I never imagined the human body could move so quickly...

 
**Da Vinci:**
The best quickdraw in the West,
a move so great, it's almost legendary.

 
**Da Vinci:**
I'd like to see that for myself someday.

 
**Billy:**
Um...Master?
Master, do you have a minute?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
What's wrong?
 
**Billy:**
I just got some news at a saloon.
Seems like this town's getting targeted.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Sure!
 
**Billy:**
Haha, my Master's sure upbeat!

 
**Billy:**
Anyway.
I hear that this town's getting targeted.

 


---
 
**Mash:**
Targeted...by whom?

 
**Billy:**
Bandits, scoundrels. Like that lot we encountered earlier. Spooked the sheriff and now he's useless.

 
**Billy:**
And the townspeople are afraid to go out.
I wanna help them. That's not a bad thing, right?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I think that's great.
 
**Billy:**
Oh, okay! Then let's do it!

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Unforgiven!
 
**Billy:**
I knew my Master'd be up for anything!
I'm really starting to like you!

 


---
 
**Mash:**
Senpai, I don't know if you should have accepted this task so lightly. You should at least have asked how many you're going up against...

 
**Billy:**
Oh, I don't know either.
Hold on. I'll go ask.

 
**Mash:**
Protecting this town from scoundrels...
(Gasp) This is a standard setup for a Western movie!

 
**Mash:**
Oh my...what a very cowboy-ish setting, Master!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Do you like that sorta thing?
 
**Mash:**
Um, well, not exactly... But there were books about it in the library, and I got engrossed in the story...

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
You seem to know a lot.
 
**Mash:**
Yes, there were Westerns in the library, so I studied them as if they were classic stories.

 


---
 
**Billy:**
Hey Master, Master!
I asked around to see how many there are.

 
**Mash:**
So how many are there?

 
**Billy:**
About a thousand.

 
**Mash:**
1,000. I see. It's a typical Western setting&ndash;
Ehhh!? A THOUSAND!?

 
**Billy:**
Master, give me your binoculars.
Okay, I see them... Hey, isn't that...!?

 
**Da Vinci:**
Hmmm. It appears that your opponent has hired a bunch of leftover Celtic soldiers.

 
**Mash:**
Impossible...that army should have disappeared when Queen Medb was defeated!

 
**Da Vinci:**
They've been summoned to this time and place before, and the area is still very unstable in space time.

 
**Da Vinci:**
With a bit of coincidence and sheer luck, they could very well be summoned again by employing the proper technique.

 
**Da Vinci:**
That said, it would be impossible for an amateur with no knowledge of magecraft to just pull off a freak summoning out of nowhere. Which means...

 
**Billy:**
The other side has a mage, too...or someone like that.

 
**Da Vinci:**
Naturally.
That's what worries me.

 
**Billy:**
One thousand Celtic soldiers...that's quite the number.

 
**Mash:**
Master!
Take a look at this!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
This can't be...

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
A Servant signature?


---
 
**Mash:**
Yes! It appears that numerous Servants are getting summoned as countermeasures.

 
**Da Vinci:**
I can't believe that many Heroic Spirits are willing to come. Maybe they're spoiling for a fight. Or they're just natural heroes down to their core.

 
**Da Vinci:**
Well, doesn't matter.
We'll take all the help we can get.

 
**Da Vinci:**
We'll operate as if we're fixing a Singularity,
Fujimaru. Explain to the Servants and ask them for help.

 
**Billy:**
Haha, Master!
This is really turning into a Western!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Teamwork!
 
**Billy:**
Roger that, Master!
All right, let's do this!

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Gunfight at the corral!
 
**Billy:**
Haha, okay, Master! You'll get front row seats to watch how I handle my guns!

 


---
 
**D：???:**
Listen up...that town ahead has tons of people, food, and gold.

 
**D：???:**
...Take them all.
Loot everything you can find.

 
**Celtic Soldier:**
Yeah!!!

 
**D：???:**
We are hungry wolves.
We are beasts who only know how to fight and eat.

 
**D：???:**
That's fine. If we don't do so,
we can't lay our roots down on this continent.

 
**D：???:**
Steal the leylines and make this grand continent our own. No gun or sword is a match for you.

 
**D：???:**
Now, go!

 
**D：???:**
Use this place as a base so our clan can prosper once again!

 
**Celtic Soldier:**
Reporting! A hundred of our front line soldiers have been annihilated.

 
**D：???:**
I see that our enemy is quite the adversary.

 
**D：???:**
...

 
**D：???:**
What!?

 
**Celtic Soldier:**
Our enemies also have Servants.

 
**D：???:**
...

 
**D：???:**
Servants...why you...!

 
**Narration:**
Let's wind the clock back a bit here.

 
**Billy:**
And so, in order to protect this town from a thousand Celtic bandits, I need everyone's help!

 
**B：???:**
Hahaha! So it's Thermopylae once again!
That does get me fired up!

 
**Leonidas:**
I, Leonidas I, shall offer my shield in protection of this town!

 
**Leonidas:**
Any one Servant is a match for a thousand soldiers, and we have seven. There's nothing to fear!

 
**C：???:**
No wonder Servants who are experts in defense got summoned.

 
**Hektor:**
But do you think this old man will be useful in this modern world?

 
**Hektor:**
Either way, I got it. Hektor of Troy...
I ask that you don't overwork me.

 
**D：???:**
Bandits are oppression.
That means this town is being oppressed right now!

 
**Spartacus:**
It is my duty to destroy all oppressors!

 
**E：???:**
Understood, agreed, and ready to succeed! Defense may not be my forte, but leave surprising the enemy and sowing chaos in their ranks to me!

 
**Mephistopheles:**
For I am Mephistopheles!
I shall spread the joy of confusion to the enemies!

 
**Mephistopheles:**
Ah, despair is so delicious!

 
**F：???:**
Assignment accepted. I can see why we were called, as many enemies as there are.

 
**Hundred Personas:**
Hmph. As long as you have Hassan of the Hundred Personas, I shall fill out our numbers to match theirs!

 
**Hundred Personas:**
Admittedly, protecting a town is not the typical duty of an assassin, but it's not as if I have no experience in doing such a thing.

 
**G：???:**
Well, summoning me makes sense, at least.

 
**Diarmuid:**
I, Diarmuid Ua Duibhne, have apparently run amok in this land before.

 
**Diarmuid:**
But that was as an enemy.
I would like to wield my dual lances as an ally this time.

 
**Diarmuid:**
...Amazing. A handful of heroes facing off against a horde or enemies... This is what I've waited for!

 
**Diarmuid:**
Master! What is your command!?
I shall paint this entire battlefield red with blood!

 
**Billy:**
Wow, I didn't think everyone would agree to join!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
That's good.
 
**Billy:**
They may say otherwise, but they're all softies at heart. After all, there's nothing to gain from this.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
It's all thanks to Billy running around.
 
**Billy:**
You think so? Heh.
That's flattering if it's true.

 


---
 
**Mash:**
Mash Kyrielight shall help you all by navigating for you!

 
**Mash:**
I will immediately inform you all if there are any changes in the town.

 
**Billy:**
All right.
Let's start by evacuating everyone in the town.

 
**Billy:**
We're going to take them to the cave inside a forest nearby. I've already spoken to the sheriff.

 
**Hundred Personas:**
Then we shall be in charge of leading the way. We do have a Hassan persona who is good at organizing lines.

 
**Diarmuid:**
...It's true. Fighting on the front line is not the only way to do it. Miss Hassan has the role of establishing communication with everyone.

 
**Diarmuid:**
It's not as exciting or glorious, but I will also accompany Miss Hassan. We need to avoid getting attacked from both sides.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Thanks, you two!


---
 
**Both:**
Roger that!

 
**Billy:**
Think about it, Master.
We now have seven reliable Servants.

 
**Billy:**
Let's start with the enemy's front line!


**--BATTLE--:**

**Leonidas:**
The enemies were spineless! How careless of them to put such weaklings on the front lines!

 
**Leonidas:**
However, there are still more.
We should rest up while we have the chance.

 
**Hektor:**
Hey, good work.

 
**Hektor:**
This is probably going to be a drawn-out battle, so Master, you should rest a bit.

 
**Hektor:**
Those are proper Celtic soldiers out there. They're quite the adversary considering how many there are.

 
**Hundred Personas:**
Master, I have my report for you:
evacuation of the townspeople is not yet complete.

 
**Hundred Personas:**
We've gotten about forty percent out. I'm impressed with how well Diarmuid has handled the women...

 
**Hundred Personas:**
But there are still children and the elderly.
It won't be easy evacuating them all.

 
**Billy:**
Master! They're here!
More incoming!

 
**Diarmuid:**
The two of us will put the evacuations on hold for now and join you in battle.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Thanks, Diarmuid!
 
**Diarmuid:**
Leave it to me!

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Billy, are you ready!?
 
**Billy:**
Of course! I'm done reloading my gun.
Now, come at us, invaders!

 
**Billy:**
This'll be like a shooting gallery!

 


---

**--BATTLE--:**

**Hundred Personas:**
Next report. Good news: half of the town's population has been evacuated. However...

 
**Hundred Personas:**
We have eagle-eyed enemies. Some of the Celts are trying to sneak ahead and ambush them.

 
**Hundred Personas:**
Spartacus is intercepting their attacks and Mephistopheles is confusing the enemy to hold them back.

 
**Hundred Personas:**
Still, it looks like the evacuees in the rear will come under attack.

 
**Leonidas:**
Master. Leave this area to us!
Please prioritize the evacuees!

 
**Hektor:**
Get going, Master and Billy!
This is the path that you two have chosen to take!

 
**Billy:**
...Okay! Master!
Mount your horse! We're going together!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Got it!


---

**--ARROW--:**

**Mash:**
There's still so many townspeople left...!

 
**Spartacus:**
OPPRESSOOOOOOOOORRRRRRSSS!!!

 
**Billy:**
Crap, Spartacus is getting pinned down!

 
**Celtic Soldier:**
Huh?

 
**Mephistopheles:**
Tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock.
Ahhh, watching an explosion is always so exciting!

 
**Mash:**
The townspeople are spooked by Mephistopheles,
and they've slowed down even more...

 
**Billy:**
Okay. Master, what should we do!?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Rescue Spartacus!
 
**Billy:**
Okay, Master.
BANG! BANG! BANG!

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Fight alongside Mephistopheles!
 
**Billy:**
Okay, Master.
BANG! BANG! BANG!

 


---

**--BATTLE--:**

**Billy:**
Master, give me the bandolier I handed you earlier!

 
**Billy:**
Thanks!
Okay! Let's keep going!

 
**Mash:**
!

 
**Mash:**
There are some Celtic soldiers trying to attack the evacuees! Please do something!

 
**Billy:**
Why you...!

 
**Billy:**
Crap...I misfired...!

 
**Spartacus:**
Hahahaha! I shall be the anvil against which our oppressors are crushed!

 
**Mash:**
Spartacus!

 
**Spartacus:**
My love...is going to explode!

 
**Celtic Soldier:**
Wha...!?

 
**Spartacus:**
Oppression will not be suffered to continue...
Now die...knowing that truth...!

 
**Mash:**
Spartacus has disappeared while taking in the Celtic Soldiers around him...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Damn...


---
 
**Billy:**
I'm sorry.
It was my mistake.

 
**Mephistopheles:**
No. We were just unlucky. And you know,
if you think that was as bad as things get...

 
**Mephistopheles:**
...then there's nowhere to go from here but up!
Okay, here's another bomb!

 
**Hundred Personas:**
We have about eighty percent of the civilians evacuated. Just a little bit more.

 
**Diarmuid:**
Ungh...these are...!

 
**Mash:**
Detecting two giant enemies right next to Diarmuid.
A chimera and a Spriggan!

 
**Mash:**
I didn't think those were still around...!

 
**Billy:**
It just means that the Incineration of Humanity left that much of a mark here! Let's rescue everyone!


**--BATTLE--:**

**Diarmuid:**
You saved us, my lord...!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Don't worry about it!


---
 
**Mash:**
Master!
I'm still picking up the chimera!

 
**Diarmuid:**
Please stand back!

 
**Diarmuid:**
Ungh...nnnnnggggh!

 
**Diarmuid:**
Twin spears!

 
**Billy:**
Diarmuid!

 
**Diarmuid:**
...It seems this is the end for me.
I leave the rest to you...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...Okay.
 
**Diarmuid:**
I have regrets...but...this isn't...that bad...

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
...Good work.
 
**Diarmuid:**
Hahahaha, I only did what is expected of a Servant.
Thank you, Master.

 
**Diarmuid:**
Though it was brief, I'm glad to have fought alongside you...

 


---
 
**Billy:**
...Let's go, Master!

 
**Mash:**
There are no more giant enemy responses.
Let's move forward!


**--ARROW--:**


---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Mash, how are Hektor and the others doing!?


---
 
**Mash:**
The Celts have broken through the barricade!

 
**Mash:**
Leonidas is still holding them off,
but he won't last much longer...!

 
**Leonidas:**
All right!
It seems this is the end for me!

 
**Leonidas:**
Sir Hektor, this will be my final effort, so let us activate our Noble Phantasms together!

 
**Hektor:**
Tch. I got the short end of the stick here.
I'd rather trade places with you, Leonidas.

 
**Leonidas:**
Hahahaha. Unfortunately, the rear guard in battle is what truly makes a fight shine. I cannot trade places with you now!

 
**Hektor:**
...It was an honor to have fought alongside you, Guardian of the Hot Gate.

 
**Leonidas:**
And you, Sir Hektor of the Shining Helmet.
It was a great honor...!

 
**Hektor:**
Let's go...Durindana!
Blow 'em away!

 
**Mash:**
I've...lost Leonidas's signal...
Hektor is still okay.

 
**Hundred Personas:**
Everyone has been evacuated! We'll hold the enemy back so they don't chase after the civilians!

 
**Mephistopheles:**
I shall string them along and toy with them!
Ahhh, blowing them up will give me such a thrill!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...I'm counting on you, Hassan.
 
**Hundred Personas:**
Why the sudden formality? It was always going to go like this. I was ready for this.

 
**Hundred Personas:**
Now, there are only ten of us.
Just don't make this a losing battle for us, Master!

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Thank you, Mephisto.
 
**Mephistopheles:**
What are you talking about, my little Rabbit!? I simply wanted to explode my bombs. And you simply wanted to protect the town.

 
**Mephistopheles:**
Isn't this a win-win situation?

 


---
 
**Hundred Personas:**
Don't just stand there, Mephistopheles!
To battle!

 
**Mephistopheles:**
Okay! It's time for our final stand!
Take care, you guys!

 
**Billy:**
Okay, Master!
Let's go. Let's leave this place to them!

 
**Hundred Personas:**
So?

 
**Mephistopheles:**
Oh? Whatever do you mean by “so”?

 
**Hundred Personas:**
How many bombs do you have left?
Aren't you running low?

 
**Mephistopheles:**
Ah. Well, this may be a surprise,
but I have a great many hidden pockets!

 
**Mephistopheles:**
One...two...three... I have a total of five more.

 
**Hundred Personas:**
And when you run out of those, our only option will be a suicide attack. An Assassin relying on a suicide attack... Ugh, how mortifying.

 
**Hundred Personas:**
If this reached the ears of the First One, I'm sure to get a lecture more terrifying than death itself!

 
**Mephistopheles:**
Ah, but our destiny is to gloriously bloom and scatter like flower petals. And that means we just need to go out with a BANG!

 
**Mephistopheles:**
Let's go out in the flashiest way.

 
**Hundred Personas:**
Unbelievable. I envy the jester his carelessness.
Well, I suppose neither of us ever look back!

 
**Billy:**
Hektor!

 
**Hektor:**
Hey, Billy.
I just set off the final trap.

 
**Hektor:**
It's a simple oil barrel, but I bought enough time to chat. Are all the civilians evacuated?

 
**Billy:**
A chase is inevitable,
but don't worry about that for now.

 
**Hektor:**
All right... This town is isolated and it stretches narrowly from north to south. Setting up a front line here to defend it wasn't an option.

 
**Hektor:**
But now that the townspeople are gone, it's a different story. This old man is ready to go wild.

 
**Hektor:**
You just need to hurry over and deal with the enemy's boss with Master.

 
**Billy:**
Whoa, that's a big responsibility.

 
**Hektor:**
No role is insignificant in this situation.
So which is it? Are you going to do it, or not?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Let's do it.
 
**Hektor:**
Excellent, Master!

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
What do you think, Billy?
 
**Billy:**
Of course we'll do it!
And Master seems to be on the same page!

 


---
 
**Hektor:**
Yeah.
That's the spirit.

 
**Hektor:**
Got it. Now, go!
I'll cover you!

 
**Billy:**
Master, sit behind me!
We're going to break through the enemy line!

 
**Hektor:**
Now then...I don't have enough magical energy to shoot off Durindana...

 
**Hektor:**
But as luck would have it, I'm skilled at throwing things! As long as I have a rock or two, you lot aren't long for this world!

 
**Billy:**
Hang in there, Silver!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Silver?


---
 
**Billy:**
My horse's name!
We're going to intercept the enemy here!


**--BATTLE--:**

**Billy:**
Okay, we've broken through the enemy line completely! Run! Run!

 
**Mash:**
I'm detecting enemies up ahead! Looks like they have a huge amount of magical energy, so please be careful!

 
**Billy:**
I know! I feel it stinging!
It feels like Pat Garrett's bloodlust!

 
**Mash:**
Can a human possibly exude so much bloodlust!?

 
**Billy:**
They can.
Especially during the pioneering days!

 
**Billy:**
...Now tell us.
Who the heck are you?

 
**Billy:**
Ehh, doesn't really matter.

 
**???:**
Why you...stupid Servants! I can't believe my ambitions have been halted by mere familiars...

 
**???:**
My golden opportunity lay right after humanity was restored. I took over this land's leyline...and I will take my revenge against the Mage's Association...!

 
**Mash:**
Based on what he's saying, I assume he's a mage who was expelled from the Mage's Association for political reasons.

 
**Mage:**
With this vast land and the leyline spread throughout it...my clan will return to its former glory.

 
**Mage:**
The United States just needs to disappear from the face of history. An insignificant mote of dust that knows nothing of magecraft.

 
**Billy:**
America, huh?
Well, I guess I call it my homeland.

 
**Billy:**
But if you say it's not,
I can't really argue that either.

 
**Billy:**
This is not my land,
and it's not yours either.

 
**Billy:**
We're just transient caretakers of the land.
Now, draw, mage!

 
**Billy:**
Let's see who's faster.

 
**Mage:**
Kill... I'll kill you!
I will not let you get in the way of my golden revenge!


**--BATTLE--:**

**Mage:**
Ungh!

 
**Billy:**
This is the final shot, mage.
I only have one bullet left.

 
**Billy:**
And I take it that you only have one more magecraft use left before you need to rest up.

 
**Billy:**
It'll be a duel. Ready?

 
**Mage:**
...Fine.

 
**Billy:**
There'll be no signal.
As soon as both of us are ready, we go.

 
**Mage:**
Okay. Fine.

 
**Mage:**
(Stupid.)

 
**Mage:**
(I've already set up protective spells... That guy's bullets are low in Divinity. There's no chance they will&ndash;)

 
**Mage:**
Eh?

 
**Billy:**
Okay. I win.

 
**Mage:**
Eh...wait...I haven't...
No...what...I...wait...wait...wait...!

 
**Mage:**
What? I'm...dead!?
He penetrated my defense. How?

 
**Mage:**
How? How? How?

 
**Billy:**
Sorry 'bout that. I'm an outlaw. I'm a villainous kid who plays dirty and always has a trick up his sleeve.

 
**Billy:**
Yep, yeah...

 
**Billy:**
Well, I fired three shots almost simultaneously at the same target, so we can call that a single shot, right?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You had me worried!
 
**Billy:**
Oh, I didn't intend to scare you.
Sorry 'bout that.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I believed in you.
 
**Billy:**
Uh...um...

 


---
 
**Billy:**
Thanks, Master. What?
Don't look over here.

 
**Billy:**
I said don't look at me!

 
**Hektor:**
Hey, is it over?

 
**Billy:**
Thanks, Hektor.

 
**Hektor:**
Don't sweat it. I was able to protect you this time.
I'll always accept a role like this.

 
**Hektor:**
...Uh, well I take that back.
Next time, summon me for easier battles.

 
**Hundred Personas:**
Hmph. I never expected I would give an after-action report, even if I'm the only one left.

 
**Hundred Personas:**
But it was a great contract, Master. You were true to your word, and it didn't end up being a losing battle.

 
**Hundred Personas:**
Ah, and I have this:
a parting gift from Mephistopheles.

 
**Hundred Personas:**
That laughing man seemed to enjoy it till the very end.

 
**Billy:**
A gift from Mephistopheles?
Is that...

 
**Billy:**
A bomb!?

 
**Billy:**
Hyaaah!

 
**Billy:**
...Hm?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
It says “congratulations.”


---
 
**Mash:**
It looks like they're just noisemakers.

 
**Billy:**
That guy messed around until the very end.
Man...

 
**Mash:**
But if it wasn't for Mephistopheles,
matters would have been much worse.

 
**Billy:**
Right.
He's definitely better to have as an ally than enemy.

 
**Billy:**
Now then.
Even after the heroes return, we have so much to do.

 
**Billy:**
We need to bring all the civilians back, and I need to collect my reward from the sheriff. Otherwise this was all for nothing.

 
**Billy:**
If someone asks us what happened to the house that got destroyed, we're gonna play dumb.

 
**Billy:**
But first, let's go eat. I may not be hungry,
but I still want to enjoy something delicious.

 
**Billy:**
How about we have a few drinks at that saloon? Oh, but bear in mind that if you drink booze made in this time, it'll probably taste like horse piss.
