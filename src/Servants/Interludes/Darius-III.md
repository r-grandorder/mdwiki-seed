# Darius III

## Lord of the Destructive Storm

**Darius III:**
![berserk1](https://i.imgur.com/XAqlQYL.png)&ndash;!

 
**Mash:**
&ndash;And the giant king has risen up.

 
**Mash:**
It's the valiant king of ancient Persia, the last king of the Achaemenid Empire.

 
**Mash:**
The king who purged the traitor Bagoas, ruled justly, and battled his eternal rival, Iskandar the Conqueror.

 
**Mash:**
He confronted the world's greatest king of combat, standing in his way as the giant man, a giant wall of infinite valor.

 
**Mash:**
His name is Darius III. The only person in the world capable of defeating him is Iskandar.

 
**Darius III:**
![berserk2](https://i.imgur.com/7VYgcEB.png)&ndash;!!!

 
**Mash:**
Therefore he was invincible.
He will crush any and all enemy soldiers.

 
**Mash:**
From the left approaches a battalion of enemy soldiers, but...

 
**Darius III:**
![berserk1](https://i.imgur.com/XAqlQYL.png)&ndash;!!!

 
**Mash:**
He is completely invincible!
He easily smashes the soldiers to dust.

 
**Mash:**
From the right approaches a battalion of enemy soldiers, but naturally&ndash;

 
**Darius III:**
![berserk1](https://i.imgur.com/XAqlQYL.png)&ndash;!!!

 
**Mash:**
He is utterly invincible!
He mows the soldiers down like grass.

 
**Mash:**
Mighty Darius III.
Valiant Darius III.

 
**Mash:**
His ferocious onslaught cannot be stopped! Just like the King of Conquerors he used to fight when he was alive.

**Fujimaru 1:**
Excuse me, Mash?
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
What's with all the narration?
 


---
 
**Mash:**
Oh, Senpai...
You see, Doctor sent me a script or something...

 
**Mash:**
He said we looked bored, so he told me to read this.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Aren't we going to join the fight?
 


---
 
**Mash:**
Well, we can try to help, but Darius has been like that this whole time&ndash;

 
**Darius III:**
![berserk1](https://i.imgur.com/XAqlQYL.png)&ndash;!!!

 
**Mash:**
He's been sweeping through these skeleton soldiers, so it's impossible to get near him...

 
**Dr. Roman:**
He seems perfectly fine without our help.
I wonder why he even came here in the first place.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
I know Fujimaru had a feeling, that in this era&ndash;

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Darius has some business here in the 1st Century Rome,
an era no longer affected by the Grail. But...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
He is a Berserker, after all.
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I have no idea what he's saying, either.
 


---
 
**Mash:**
Well...
It is incredibly difficult to understand what he's thinking.

 
**Fou:**
Foou...

 
**Dr. Roman:**
At any rate, we don't know why the skeleton soldiers are here!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
But he sure intends to defeat all the monsters here!
So he should be satisfied once all of them are defeated.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
We'll just have to trust that he won't be angry if we take some of his prey! All right&ndash;Shall we do this?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You bet!
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Mash, prepare for battle!
 


---
 
**Mash:**
Yes, Master!
Preparing for battle!


**--BATTLE--:**

**Mash:**
...The enemy still has much strength left.
We must continue fighting, Master!

 
**Darius III:**
![berserk1](https://i.imgur.com/XAqlQYL.png)&ndash;!!!

 
**Mash:**
Ummm, looks like we just need one more push!

 
**Fou:**
Foou!!


**--BATTLE--:**

**Mash:**
...None of the enemy remains.
The battle is over.

 
**Mash:**
Nice work, Senpai.
Darius has calmed down now.

 
**Darius III:**
...

 
**Mash:**
Excuse me, Darius.
Why did you come to this era?

 
**Mash:**
Did you bring us here because you sensed something, and figured out why the monsters were showing up?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
This is ancient Rome, after all.
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Maybe there's someone here he knows?
 


---
 
**Mash:**
Yes. I'm sure there's some phenomenon here that's related to him&ndash;

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Ahh... Yes. So it seems. Well, there does seem to be some phenomenon related to him.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
We've just finished a preliminary analysis, and the origin of the skeleton soldier and ghost spawning is 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
&ndash;the presence of His Majesty Darius himself!

 
**Mash:**
What?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
How can that be?
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Oh! His Noble Phantasm!
 


---
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Yes. Well, you see, it's the Noble Phantasm he carries. "Athanaton Ten Thousand."

 
**Dr. Roman:**
That Noble Phantasm is based on his ten thousand elite soldiers who actually existed, and his legend of unyielding valor.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Along with the legend of their "immortality," they've actually ended up becoming indestructible...

 
**Mash:**
Immortality&ndash;I see.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
That's what's behind this. His Noble Phantasm is able to summon skeleton soldiers and ghosts.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
This location is the recent battlefield where Nero's Roman Army and the United Empire Army clashed.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
That's why the undead kept showing up.

 
**Mash:**
I see... So...
That's... What's... Happening.

 
**Fou:**
Foo, fou...

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Now, that's one crazy private army generator...
Oh, well...

 
**Darius III:**
![berserk1](https://i.imgur.com/XAqlQYL.png)&ndash;!!!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
At least he seems satisfied now...
Let's just forget about it...

 
**Darius III:**

**Mash:**

## Two Heroes, To the End of the Battlefield

**Darius III:**
![berserk2](https://i.imgur.com/7VYgcEB.png)&ndash;!

 
**Darius III:**
![berserk2](https://i.imgur.com/7VYgcEB.png)&ndash;!!!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Whoa! Darius III is going even more wild than before!
We're back on a 1st century Roman battlefield again!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
I-Is this his own private army generator again?
What about you, Master? Do you sense anything!?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Hmm...
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
His power is greater than before.
 


---
 
**Mash:**
His attacks are faster than before!
He's clearly on a rampage!

 
**Mash:**
Watch your magical energy consumption, Senpai.
A Berserker's full power will drain a Master energy fast!

 
**Fou:**
Foou! Kyuu!!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
A-Anyway, let's use the same strategy as last time!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
At this rate, Fujimaru won't last at all.
We have to eliminate the enemy before that happens!

 
**Mash:**
All right, Doctor!
Senpai!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Mash, prepare for battle!
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Crush those that get past Darius!
 


---
 
**Mash:**
Understood, Master!
Commencing battle!


**--BATTLE--:**

**Mash:**
Not many enemies left now!
Senpai, are you all right&ndash;?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I'm still fine!
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I've still got the will to continue!
 


---
 
**Mash:**
...I'm sorry, Senpai.
Hold out just a little longer, please!


**--BATTLE--:**

**Darius III:**
![berserk1](https://i.imgur.com/XAqlQYL.png)&ndash;!!!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Whaaaa? He's still excited after all the monsters are defeated?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Last time, he calmed down the moment they were wiped out, and we could just go back&ndash;

 
**Mash:**
No, Doctor.
I'm afraid this time the situation is different.

 
**Mash:**
&ndash;There's a Servant here.

 
**Alexander:**
It's been a while.
When was the last time we met like this?

 
**Alexander:**
Perhaps I'm one of the Servants you summoned?
I can't be sure, since my connection has been severed.

 
**Alexander:**
So it's pretty hard to figure out what's going on there, sorry about that.

 
**Mash:**
!!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Alexander!
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
It's the younger version of King Iskandar!
 


---
 
**Alexander:**
It's the opposite of what happened in Rome.
Because you called to me so much&ndash;

 
**Alexander:**
It seems I ended up being chain summoned by you. Maybe this place is still affected by the Grail?

 
**Alexander:**
I do have to say, your determination sure is strong. Since I'm like this, I can't really grasp the impact of my later years.

 
**Alexander:**
But I have nothing but respect for you.
O brave king of Persia.

 
**Alexander:**
&ndash;Darius III.

 
**Darius III:**
![berserk1](https://i.imgur.com/XAqlQYL.png)!!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Sheesh! This guy just won't stop!
Young Alexander, wh-what are we gonna do?

 
**Alexander:**
He wants to fight me.
In that case, I think I'll just have to face him.

 
**Alexander:**
Since how we are summoned is reversed from last time, it would be fun to also reverse our roles in life!

 
**Alexander:**
You'll be the one marching onward!
And I shall be the one who stands in your way!

 
**Alexander:**
The king who will eventually stand before me, no, who stood before me, Darius III! Come!

 
**Alexander:**
Let's battle it out!
Just how much I can fight in this form&ndash;

 
**Alexander:**
I've always wanted to test it out!
With you, my beloved rival!

 
**Darius III:**
![berserk2](https://i.imgur.com/7VYgcEB.png)&ndash;!!!

 
**Mash:**
Senpai, time for battle!
Please hang on a little longer&ndash;

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You bet!
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I can do this! Prepare for battle!
 


---
 
**Mash:**
Yes, Master!


**--BATTLE--:**

**Mash:**
We defeated...him? No, something is different about this&ndash;Senpai!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
I can still detect Alexander's magical energy!
Wait, he was eliminated for a moment, what's this?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Did he materialize again in the same spot!?
But what's there is probably a different Servant!

 
**Mash:**
Different?
No, this feeling...

 
**???:**
Wahahahahaha!

 
**???:**
How amusing! My youthful self and my former beloved rival fought! Quite exhilarating! But the outcome was expected.

 
**???:**
Not enough! What could that young pup accomplish by relying so much on Bucephalus?

 
**???:**
My opponent is the dauntless giant king! None other than the last king of the Achaemenid Empire, Darius III!

 
**Darius III:**
![berserk1](https://i.imgur.com/XAqlQYL.png)&ndash;!!!

 
**???:**
Ooh! Ooh! You're quite pleased to see me, I can tell!

 
**???:**
There are none that can stand before you, not even my youthful self!

 
**???:**
You died and transformed into a Heroic Spirit!
You magnificently assimilated ten thousand soldiers, King Darius!

 
**???:**
If anyone can defeat you&ndash;
It can only be me, Iskandar the Conqueror!

 
**Mash:**
...Uh?!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Iskandar! It's Alexander in his later years...
Without a doubt, it is the King of Conquerors!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Th-That's one incredible, super-famous hero! I didn't think the influence of the Holy Grail was still so strong in this area!

 
**Iskandar:**
No, this has nothing to do with the Holy Grail!
Someone has relentlessly insisted on calling me!

 
**Iskandar:**
Someone none other than you! Isn't that right, Darius, my greatest rival!

 
**Darius III:**
![berserk2](https://i.imgur.com/7VYgcEB.png)&ndash;!!!

 
**Mash:**
No use, there's no way to stop him now!
King Iskandar, please&ndash;

 
**Iskandar:**
Not to worry! Not to worry! This is why I showed up. Let's go at it with everything we've got!

 
**Darius III:**
![berserk2](https://i.imgur.com/7VYgcEB.png)&ndash;!!!

 
**Iskandar:**
Wahahahahaha!!
What a joy! Let us cross swords again!


**--BATTLE--:**

**Darius III:**
...

 
**Iskandar:**
What's going on? Why did you suddenly turn into a tame kitten? Is that all you've got? How unsatisfying!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Sorry, but this is as far as I can...
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I-I can't take it any more.
 


---
 
**Mash:**
...Senpai's magical energy is depleted.
I'm afraid, anymore combat would...

 
**Darius III:**
...

 
**Iskandar:**
...I see. Well, to tell the truth,
I have reached my limit as well.

 
**Iskandar:**
Not only was I not properly summoned, I was forcefully materialized without a Holy Grail&ndash;

 
**Iskandar:**
It only makes sense it turned out like this. Darius III, you are the enormous wall that stood before me.

 
**Iskandar:**
Now that your magical energy supply is down, my voice probably won't reach you anymore&ndash;

 
**Iskandar:**
But the next time we meet, let's face each other&ndash;

 
**Darius III:**
...

 
**Mash:**
Servant Iskandar, elimination confirmed.
&ndash;The battle is over.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Whew. He left without causing too much trouble. Thank goodness he's the understanding type. I'm so glad.

 
**Mash:**
...Yes, you're right.
Any further combat is too much.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I...can't...
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I'm...beat...
 


---
 
**Mash:**
Oh! Senpai!?
Quick, Doctor! Rayshift!
