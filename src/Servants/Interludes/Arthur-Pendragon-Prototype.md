# Arthur Pendragon (Prototype)

## Still in Pursuit

**Bradamante:**
Oh gosh, oh gosh, oh gosh, oh gosh!

 
**Bradamante:**
Wh-wh-what do I do!? I never expected to run into another famous Knight of the Round Table!

 
**Bradamante:**
It was just yesterday I resolved to always carry an autograph book with me in case I ran into more opportunities to collect signatures, too!

 
**Bradamante:**
I can't believe I already failed so miserably!

 
**Bedivere:**
Please be at ease, Lady Bradamante.

 
**Bedivere:**
We serve the same Master now,
so we can see one another whenever we like.

 
**Bedivere:**
That said...I may technically be a Knight of the Round Table...

 
**Bedivere:**
...but I am not nearly as accomplished as the other knights, so...

 
**Bedivere:**
Um... An autograph, you said?

 
**Bedivere:**
I'm afraid I wouldn't feel right giving you one, so I must humbly decline.

 
**Bradamante:**
Noooooo!

 
**Bradamante:**
P-p-please don't say that! I-i-if I've offended you,
then I beg your forgiveness!!!

 
**Bradamante:**
Please, Sir Bedivere!

 
**Bedivere:**
N-no, not at all!
If anything, I'm the one who's been&ndash;

 
**Bradamante:**
I'm so sorry!

 
**Bedivere:**
Ah! P-please, don't be!

 
**Bedivere:**
I promise I wasn't seeking an apology!
Oh no, now I've gone and said all the wrong things!

 
**Bedivere:**
...!

 
**Arthur:**
Forgive me, Sir Bedivere.

 
**Arthur:**
I did not mean to eavesdrop,
but I happened to be passing by.

 
**Bedivere:**
My king!

 
**Bedivere:**
Or rather, my king from another world.
I, the unworthy Bedivere, am deeply ashamed.

 
**Bedivere:**
I'm afraid I have been unspeakably rude to Lady Bradamante here, a paladin of the Kingdom of the Franks.

 
**Bradamante:**
No, no! You haven't been anything of the sort, Sir Bedivere!

 
**Bradamante:**
I should never have asked you for the impossible in the first place! O-oh, um...

 
**Bradamante:**
May I ask who that is?

 
**Bedivere:**
Ah, forgive me.

 
**Bedivere:**
This is His Majesty Arthur Pendragon,
Britain's King of Knights.

 
**Bradamante:**
!!!

 
**Bradamante:**
Arthur Pendragon, the King of Knights!?
I-I-I-I-I can't believe it...!

 
**Bradamante:**
Th-this is such a shock... S-so moving...and shocking!
Although, um... Huh?

 
**Bradamante:**
I've met the King of Knights here in Chaldea in various forms before, but...I don't recall any of them being...uh, male...

 
**Bradamante:**
So...does this mean...
Hmm...?

 
**Bedivere:**
To elaborate, he is a being somewhat similar to myself.

 
**Bedivere:**
He is something of a guest in this world, a figure who would normally never materialize as a Servant...

 
**Bradamante:**
Whaaa...?

 
**Arthur:**
I would humbly suggest you think of me as a mere shadow from a dream, paladin Bradamante.

 
**Arthur:**
...Sir Bedivere, I may not be your king,
but I do have one word of advice.

 
**Arthur:**
There is no harm in giving her an autograph.
Any King of Knights would say the same.

 
**Bedivere:**
Yes, my king.

 
**Bradamante:**
Then, does this mean I can have Sir Bedivere's autograph after all!? Hooray!

 
**Bradamante:**
Oh! Uh, Sir King of Knights!?
Could I ask you for your autograph as well!?

 
**Arthur:**
Now then, I think I shall take my leave.
Good day, Lady Bradamante, Sir Bedivere.

 
**Bedivere:**
Yes, my king.

 
**Bradamante:**
Ah!
Sir King of Knights...!

 
**Bradamante:**
He's already gone...
Nnn... Nnnnnn...

 
**Gawain:**
You wish to know more about King Arthur?

 
**Gawain:**
Hmm. We are indeed the Knights of the Round Table, but I am afraid we have had few opportunities to converse with him.

 
**Gawain:**
Though Sir Bedivere would seem to have had more chances than the rest of us.

 
**Bradamante:**
I see, I see...

 
**Sanzang:**
Hm? What's up?

 
**Sanzang:**
Oh, the other Pendragon?
Of course I've met him!

 
**Sanzang:**
The Pendragon from Proper Human History's True Name is Altria Pendragon...

 
**Sanzang:**
...so in this case, um...
I guess I should say his True Name is Arthur!

 
**Sanzang:**
He's really mysterious, isn't he?
There're so much I'd love to ask him!

 
**Sanzang:**
You know, now that I think of it, I don't think I've ever sat down with him face-to-face. Not even to eat lunch!

 
**Bradamante:**
Hmm, I see, I see...

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
He told us some lovely old legends. Didn't he, Jack?

 
**Jack:**
Uh-huh. He's really nice. He doesn't get mad if we sit in his lap or climb on his back.

 
**Jack:**
Although...

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
Yeah. I know what you mean.

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
He always disappears whenever we take our eyes off him. I don't like that very much.

 
**Bradamante:**
Hmmm...

 
**Mordred:**
Eh, my father, the one that's a guy? Hmm, I dunno.
I don't think he means any harm.

 
**Bradamante:**
I see...

 
**Bradamante:**
I think so too! But I also get the feeling he's avoiding me for some reason!

 
**Bradamante:**
So if there's something about me he dislikes,
I need to find out what it is and fix it!

 
**Mordred:**
Oh yeah?

 
**Bradamante:**
All that aside, um... Sir Mordred!

 
**Mordred:**
Yeah?

 
**Bradamante:**
I know you're the ultimate villain in the legend of King Arthur!

 
**Bradamante:**
But...you don't seem to be nearly as bad as I thought, now that I've met you.

 
**Bradamante:**
Ah...

 
**Mordred:**
The hell'd you say to me?

 
**Mordred:**
Bahahahaha! Talk about bein' honest to a fault!
I'm impressed!

 
**Mordred:**
You're all right, paladin of Charlemagne! Just make sure you don't slow us down by dyin' too soon, 'kay?

 
**Jekyll:**
Is something wrong, Saber? Remember, Lady Murasaki asked you to keep your voice down in the library.

 
**Jekyll:**
Hm?

 
**Jekyll:**
Saber... Did you do something to this Heroic Spirit?

 
**Mordred:**
Nah, it's no biggie.

 
**Mordred:**
You know that version of my father who came here from another world? She's worried he's avoiding her.

 
**Jekyll:**
Is that true?

 
**Bradamante:**
Yes, that about sums it up...

 
**Jekyll:**
Hmm...

 
**Jekyll:**
...If it helps, he's like that with everyone. The only one he talks to with any regularity is Sir Bedivere.

 
**Jekyll:**
He'll respond to the situation if needed, but I don't think I've ever seen him engage with anyone on his own initiative.

 
**Jekyll:**
Not even when dealing with Servants he knew in past Holy Grail Wars.

 
**Mordred:**
...
...

 
**Jekyll:**
I'm one of them. He and I once fought each other, though in a place and time very different from this.

 
**Jekyll:**
However, I do not retain a clear memory of that battle...

 
**Bradamante:**
Nnn... Nnnnnn...

 
**Bradamante:**
I thought I heard that Servants don't usually remember their past materializations...

 
**Bradamante:**
Hmm...?

 
**Jekyll:**
Chaldea's summoning system is a little unusual in that regard. Every now and then, it summons a Heroic Spirit who remembers their past materializations...or so I'm told.

 
**Jekyll:**
Unfortunately, I'm not one of them. It's all I can do to barely recall bits and pieces of my own past.

 
**Jekyll:**
Those kinds of memories also affect my Spirit Origin's stability, so...

 
**Bradamante:**
Huh?

 
**Jekyll:**
Sorry, I didn't mean to ramble there.

 
**Jekyll:**
At any rate, Arthur Pendragon tends to keep his distance from just about everyone.

 
**Jekyll:**
So please don't worry about it.
I'm sure it's nothing personal.

 
**Hassan of the Serenity:**
...And that's all I saw.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Thanks!
 
**Hassan of the Serenity:**
I-it was nothing, really.
I just happened to be in the right place at the right time.

 
---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I see. Arthur, huh...

 
**Hassan of the Serenity:**
Yes. I saw him in the underground library.

 
---
 
**Hassan of the Serenity:**
I just thought you should know.
I, um, hope I didn't overstep my bounds...

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Not at all. I appreciate this!

---
 

 
**Cú Chulainn:**
So that's the scoop, huh.

 
**Cú Chulainn:**
The former leader of the Knights of the Round Table, wielder of the sacred sword, is now Chaldea's lonesome King of Knights...

 
**Cú Chulainn:**
I don't know what he's so worried about.
Who cares if he's from a different world or not?

 
**Cú Chulainn:**
Heroic Spirits are supposed to be...

 
**Cú Chulainn:**
...
...

 
**Cú Chulainn:**
...Ah, well, you know.

 
**Cú Chulainn:**
I'm not sure if we can really call him a proper Heroic Spirit or not, so...

 
**Cú Chulainn:**
Hmm, yeah, I guess that'd be tough for him.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
What's this now?

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Do you know what's going on with him?

---
 

 
**Cú Chulainn:**
Haha.

 
**Cú Chulainn:**
What do you think?

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Don't change the subject!
 
**Cú Chulainn:**
You're right. My bad.

 
---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Is this one of those things where you know but can't say?
 
**Cú Chulainn:**
Yeah, pretty much.
You're a sharp one, aren't you, Master?

---

 
**Cú Chulainn:**
Until and unless he says something, it's not my place to talk about it. Especially when I don't even know for sure.

 
**Cú Chulainn:**
Why don'tcha just go talk to him about it?

 
**Cú Chulainn:**
Maybe it'll turn out that he wasn't avoiding anyone, and this was all just a big misunderstanding.

 
**Cú Chulainn:**
Go on and find out. Who cares whether he's inscribed in the Throne or not?

 
**Cú Chulainn:**
He's still a Servant you formed a contract with.
If you call for him, I'm sure he'll show up.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
(Nod)

---
 

 
**Cú Chulainn:**
Right on. Guess I'll go round up some of the family then...

 
**Arash:**
Hahahaha! Sure is taking him a while!

 
**Cú Chulainn:**
Never would've thought he'd choose Ganryu Island.
Well, I figure he'll show up eventually.

 
**Cú Chulainn:**
Say, where's the pharaoh at, hero guy?

 
**Arash:**
Oh, he's not coming.

 
**Cú Chulainn:**
Well, that was blunt...

 
**Arash:**
Said something like “This errand is hardly a matter worthy of my time!” Sorry, Master. You know how he is.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Oh yes. All too well...
 
**Arash:**
Haha, I knew you would. Anyway, just 'cause he's not here now doesn't mean he might not show up later.

 
---

**Fujimaru 2:**
That's okay. Thanks for trying, Arash.

 
**Arash:**
No problem!

---

 
**Mordred:**
Can I go home now? If I ain't gonna get a chance to fight my actual man old man, there's no point in me sticking around.

 
**Jekyll:**
We're not here to fight him, Saber.

 
**Jekyll:**
We just thought it would be easier for him to open up to Master if there were other Servants with a strong connection to him here.

 
**Jekyll:**
He might tend to keep to himself at Chaldea, but there have been points in the past where he's initiated contact with other Servants.

 
**Jekyll:**
Specifically, the ones he fought against in 1991 and 1999...

 
**Jekyll:**
...during the two Holy Grail Wars that took place in a different world.

 
**Mordred:**
Oh, I get it. Mordred doesn't get to have any fun...

 
**Jekyll:**
No, no, Saber, it's not about that...

 
**Arash:**
Haha. Don't worry about it, Doc.

 
**Arash:**
Mordred's King Arthur's kid, right? Even if these two are from different worlds, they're not total strangers.

 
**Mordred:**
What he said, Doc.

 
**Jekyll:**
Doc...

 
**Arash:**
Anyway, what about you? Your Spirit Origin isn't exactly, uh, what it used to be, right...?

 
**Jekyll:**
...So you could tell. You're perceptive as always.

 
**Jekyll:**
True, my Spirit Origin is still unstable.
But I also know I'll be fine as long as I'm not alone.

 
**Jekyll:**
If nothing else, I can maintain my mental state even if my body changes with my Noble Phantasm.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I'm glad to hear that.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
We should have tea sometime, Jekyll.

---
 

 
**Jekyll:**
I would love that.

 
**Jekyll:**
Although...I should warn you that my Spirit Origin tends to waver when it's just us.
But as long as Lady Kyrielight&ndash;

 
**Hassan of the Serenity:**
...Master.

 
**Cú Chulainn:**
Right. Sorry to cut you guys off, but it looks like the man of the hour's finally arrived.

 
**Arthur:**
...I see the gang's all here, Master.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I thought having them around would make it easier to talk.
 
**Arthur:**
I see.
You may be right about that.

 
---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Would you rather it was just us?

 
**Arthur:**
I'm not sure.
I might end up dodging your questions if it was.

---

 
**Cú Chulainn:**
Just so you know, we're not here to make trouble for you or anything. Not unless Master gives the okay, and we all know that's not the sort of [♂ guy he /♀️ gal she] is.

 
**Cú Chulainn:**
I'm just gonna get straight to the point.

 
**Cú Chulainn:**
You're avoiding everyone at Chaldea, aren't you,
King of Knights? It's pretty damn obvious.

 
**Arthur:**
...Yes, I am.

 
**Arthur:**
I've been doing my best not to interact with anyone more than strictly necessary.

 
**Arthur:**
All the more so when it comes to beings with deep ties to this world.

 
**Cú Chulainn:**
Well, that's awfully straightforward of you.

 
**Arthur:**
It was never my intention to hide anything.
I simply never brought it up of my own accord.

 
**Arthur:**
But if I've caused you to worry by doing so,
Master, I will always be happy to apologize.

 
**Arthur:**
I would never want to worry you.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
It's not that, Arthur.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
It's okay. I'm not looking for an apology.

---
 

 
**Arthur:**
...I do not belong in this world.

 
**Arthur:**
I am but a traveler who came from a faraway land in pursuit of a single, specific goal.

 
**Arthur:**
Of course, I am happy to help you, Master. If my sword can help save this planet and bring it a new tomorrow, then I will gladly lend it to your cause.

 
**Arthur:**
I will never betray you, and I will continue to fight as the modern-day wielder of the sacred sword.

 
**Arthur:**
That said...I came here to eradicate evil before it has a chance to spread in the future.

 
**Arthur:**
Once my work here is done, I expect I will be sent back to my own world.

 
**Arthur:**
Therefore&ndash;

 
**Arash:**
Hold up!

 
**Arash:**
Just relax a bit, would you? I could've sworn you were a little more laid back in 1999.

 
**Arash:**
I get that you're here on a mission, but there's no law that says travelers can't make friends.

 
**Arash:**
Right, Master?

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Right.

---
 

 
**Arthur:**
...
...

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You're part of the team now. It's okay to act like it.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
So come on, have some fun with us!

---
 

 
**Arthur:**
...Fujimaru.

 
**Arthur:**
You may well be right.
But even so...

 
**Arthur:**
...I want to leave as few traces of myself in this world as possible. You see, I had a premonition of sorts that&ndash;

 
**Cú Chulainn:**
I can tell you're still not being straight with us.

 
**Mordred:**
Hell no he ain't. Just shut up already, old man!
There's nothing to talk about!

 
**Mordred:**
If he won't listen to reason, then I guess I get to&ndash;er, have to beat some into him!

 
**Jekyll:**
Saber&ndash;

 
**Mordred:**
You stay out of this.

 
**Mordred:**
Y'know, I just remembered something.
I've still gotta pay you back for that one time!

 
**Fran:**
Uh...

 
**Mordred:**
You feel like cake?

 
**Mordred:**
Cake sounds good.
And hey, I think Cat and Boudica were just makin' some.

 
**Mordred:**
Let's go get ourselves a slice!

 
**Fran:**
Uh!

 
**Mordred:**
Right on.
...Oh hey, if it isn't my male father!

 
**Mordred:**
Yo, pops!
Let's go get us some cake!

 
**Mordred:**
Hm? That's weird. He just not hear me or something...?

 
**Fran:**
Uh...

 
**Mordred:**
What? 'Course it wasn't 'cause he didn't want to eat with you, Fran.

 
**Mordred:**
...
...

 
**Mordred:**
You ran off without sayin' a word!

 
**Mordred:**
Not a damn word!!!

 
**Mordred:**
Who the hell just runs off without a word after giving the person inviting them for cake nothing but a funny look!?

 
**Mordred:**
That does it! Nobody does that to me!
Especially not my old man!

 
**Mordred:**
I remember now! I knew I had a good reason to beat your ass!

 
**Cú Chulainn:**
Mordred's got a point, Arthur! No gentleman or knight should turn down an invite without at least giving a response!

 
**Arash:**
Hahahaha, looks like you're outnumbered, Saber.
What're you gonna do now?

 
**Arthur:**
What can I do?

 
**Arthur:**
You're right. I was rude to you back then. The least I can do now is face my punishment with some dignity.

 
**Arthur:**
Have at you, Mordred!

 
**Mordred:**
Now that's more like it! Let's go, Master! Don't worry, I'm not gonna kill him. I'm just gonna beat the everliving shit outta him!

 
**Jekyll:**
But if you do that, you'll...! Oh, forget it!
I'll just have to step in if things get out of hand!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
E-easy does it now!

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Try to hold back, Mordred!

---
 

 
**Mordred:**
All right Clarent, it's been too long since I gave you a taste of your favorite blood! Let's fix that right now!


**--BATTLE--:**

**Mordred:**
Hah! Figures this version of you'd be tough too!

 
**Mordred:**
But at least I got a good one in for Fran! Didja see!?

 
**Cú Chulainn:**
I got a few good hits in too...but damn, you really are a tough bastard! Almost pisses me off how seasoned you are!

 
**Cú Chulainn:**
Don't hold back, Arash!
We'll never pin him down unless we go all out!

 
**Arash:**
I'm just doing the same thing I always do.
That goes for you too, right, Missy?

 
**Serenity:**
I-I try not to get too involved with warrior types...

 
**Jekyll:**
I'm glad I decided to sit this one out. Hyde might be able to keep up, but there's no way I could!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
All right, that's enough!

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Everyone stand down! This battle is over!

---
 

 
**Mordred:**
Huh!? But we were just starting to have fun!

 
**Arthur:**
...I suppose I'd best not push my luck,
given my overwhelming disadvantage.

 
**Cú Chulainn:**
Ha! Looks like the Red Dragon of Britain's still confident enough to make wisecracks. Just don't forget, you're not the only one who knows his opponent's tricks.

 
**Arthur:**
Confident?

 
**Arthur:**
No. That's impossible. There is never a time nor a place when I do not consider myself to be on the battlefield.

 
**Arthur:**
...
...

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Arthur, that's...

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
That must mean you never get to enjoy a moment's peace.

---
 

 
**Arthur:**
I...

 
**Arthur:**
Khh! This powerful magical energy pouring down from the sky... Is that&ndash;

 
**Ozymandias:**
Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!
Hahahahaha! Behold the descent of the sun!

 
**Ozymandias:**
I was told that vengeance was to be had upon a certain insolent wielder of the sacred sword, so I have come to lend my aid!

 
**Ozymandias:**
Hmm, it would seem that my way is blocked by rabble! This must be remedied! I shall begin by clearing the field!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Ozymandias!?

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
H-hey, watch it! This is seriously dangerous!

---
 

 
**Serenity:**
Master! This way!

 
**Serenity:**
I'll take you somewhere safe&ndash;

 
**Arash:**
Missy, behind you!

 
**Serenity:**
Huh!?

 
**Serenity:**
A-a Sphinx!?

 
**Jekyll:**
More powerful magical energy readings are right behind it! Saber, keep Master safe!

 
**Arthur:**
...Was he just talking to you?

 
**Mordred:**
Shut your damn mouth!

 
**Mordred:**
We can get back to our tussle later! If you got time to act cool, then you got time to protect Master!

 
**Cú Chulainn:**
Well, whaddaya know.
He was the first in line to keep Master safe.

 
**Arash:**
Of course. That's just the kind of guy he is.

 
**Arash:**
Even when he was fighting us,
he always kept one eye on Master.

 
**Arash:**
He must've wanted to be able to act at a moment's notice in case it looked like [♂ he /♀️ she] might be in any danger.

 
**Arash:**
In that sense, I don't think he's any different from you, the red Saber, Doc, or Missy.

 
**Cú Chulainn:**
Are you shitting me? Ugh, I knew I hated that guy!

 
**Arash:**
Hahahaha!

 
**Arthur:**
He truly isn't holding back at all.
What is the meaning of this, Ozymandias!?

 
**Ozymandias:**
Is that a joke, wielder of the sacred sword!?
You should know better than any why I am doing this.

 
**Ozymandias:**
Now reflect on your misdeeds, and let the rays of the sun's light scatter your ashes!

 
**Arthur:**
Khh...!

 
**Arthur:**
...Master, it looks as though Ozymandias means business. So there is something I wish to ask of you.

 
**Arthur:**
I, um... I would like to keep you safe.
Will you let me?

 
**Mordred:**
Hey! What do you think you're doing here?

 
**Jekyll:**
I'd like to know that too.

 
**Arthur:**
H-huh? I-I'm not quite sure what you're insinuating,
but whatever it is, it's not what I meant!

 
**Arthur:**
All I'm asking is that Master let me fight by [♂ his /♀️ her] side, just this once!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You don't need to ask that!

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Of course! I've never thought of you as an enemy, anyway!

---
 

 
**Arthur:**
...Thank you, Master.

 
**Mordred:**
Haha! So we're up against a bunch of Divine Beasts from the Age of Gods, huh! This oughta be a good way to kill time, huh, Bean Sprout!?

 
**Jekyll:**
This is really not the time to be joking...

 
**Arthur:**
I know these beasts are not truly alive. They are merely constructs given form by God-King Ozymandias's magical energy.

 
**Arthur:**
Nonetheless, there is meaning in form. I wish to inflict neither pain nor suffering if I can help it.

 
**Arthur:**
However, if the god-king means to attack us without so much as a word of warning...

 
**Arthur:**
...then I will not hesitate to wield my sacred sword!


**--BATTLE--:**

**Romulus:**
Romans!

 
**Romulus:**
Hear me, my children of Rome, and stay your blades.
Hear me, sacred beasts, and bare your fangs no more.

 
**Romulus:**
Any further bloodshed would be meaningless.
Cease your warring at once.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Holy Progenitor!?

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Wh-what are you doing here, Romulus?

---
 

 
**Arthur:**
Holy Progenitor Romulus!

 
**Jekyll:**
Wh-why is the Holy Progenitor of Rome here!? Not only that, his magical energy is far, far greater than usual!

 
**Ozymandias:**
He said he could not bear to see his children fighting amongst themselves, so I brought him along with me. Hmph.

 
**Ozymandias:**
As the son of a god, Romulus ascended to the greatest rank of his mythology. Even I cannot ignore his pleas.

 
**Romulus:**
...Arthur Pendragon, the Red Dragon of Britain.

 
**Romulus:**
I am Rome, and Rome is I. As all roads lead to Rome,
so do I possess knowledge of all things.

 
**Romulus:**
And so, my child, I know where your destination lies.
Ahh, my dear child.

 
**Romulus:**
This may not be where your journey will ultimately end, but it is a fine place to stop and gaze up at the stars.

 
**Romulus:**
You are so focused on what tomorrow brings that you pay the sky no heed, but that is a mistake, my child.

 
**Romulus:**
As you have paused your journey for now, this is the time to cast your gaze upward and behold the stars.

 
**Romulus:**
Indeed, it is for that purpose that you have come here.

 
**Arthur:**
...

 
**Romulus:**
Look to the stars. The great calamity you have been pursuing will come from beyond their borders.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Calamity...?

---
 

 
**Arthur:**
...
...

 
**Arthur:**
......

 
**Arthur:**
...I pursue something truly wicked.

 
**Arthur:**
...A great Beast that will come from far beyond to devour everything in its path.

 
**Arthur:**
The Sixth Beast will surely rear its head someday.
That is why I am here.

 
**Jekyll:**
A Beast...

 
**Arthur:**
It is known as Beast VI and it is one of the great Evils of Humanity, as fearsome as any of the others you have defeated.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
So that's what you've been looking for all this time.

---
 

 
**Arthur:**
Indeed.

 
**Arthur:**
Now that Beast I has appeared in this world, it is only a matter of time until Beast VI follows suit.

 
**Arthur:**
When it does, it will devour everything. People... Cities... Prosperity... Corruption... All of civilization.

 
**Arthur:**
In a different world,
I...we, managed to defeat it twice...

 
**Arthur:**
...but my world's Merlin told me Beast VI would come once again.

 
**Arthur:**
My goal...my duty, is to defeat it a third and final time.

 
**Arthur:**
...I'm sorry, Master. I wasn't sure what to do.

 
**Arthur:**
All this time, I've been thinking I needed to fulfill this duty on my own.

 
**Arthur:**
But I was wrong. I should have told you what I'm about to say the moment we formed a contract.

 
**Arthur:**
Master, please lend me your strength, that I may win this battle. In return I will devote myself to helping you succeed in yours.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You've got a deal, Arthur Pendragon.

---
 

 
**Arthur:**
Thank you, Master.

 
**Arthur:**
When that time comes, I hope I can count on your help as well, Heroic Spirits of Chaldea.

 
**Mordred:**
Ha! You think there's even a chance we'd sit out for a fight against a goddamn Beast!?

 
**Mordred:**
If and when this thing shows up, I'll cut it down to size whether you ask me to or not!

 
**Cú Chulainn:**
You said it!
I think you and I'll get along just fine, Scion of Pendragon!

 
**Mordred:**
That makes one of us...

 
**Cú Chulainn:**
Huh!?

 
**Arash:**
Haha, hey, you know what they say. We're all in this boat together, so we'd better make sure it doesn't sink!

 
**Serenity:**
I...don't think that's how it goes...

 
**Jekyll:**
Y-yeah. There must be a better way to put that!

 
**Ozymandias:**
Very well then. It would seem our business here is concluded, so I will take my leave! Romulus, who became Quirinus, show us out!

 
**Romulus:**
We are Rome!


**--ARROW--:**

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
So?

---
 

 
**Arthur:**
...Hm?

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Are you going to get along with everyone now?

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I was hoping you would try to be more sociable from now on...

---
 

 
**Arthur:**
...Ah, right.
That is what this was originally about, was it not?

 
**Arthur:**
I surrender, Master. I've learned my lesson.

 
**Arthur:**
Besides, I did think that if many Heroic Spirits, or even just you yourself, were to confront me about this...

 
**Arthur:**
...I would need to reconsider my approach to staying here.

 
**Arthur:**
I was hoping to stay out of sight,
but I never wished to cause any trouble.

 
**Arthur:**
Thank you again for having me here, Fujimaru.

 
**Serenity:**
...It's over.

 
**Serenity:**
It looks like the problem has been resolved. He should get along better with the other Servants from now on...

 
**Serenity:**
...
...

 
**Serenity:**
I'm glad I asked for your help with this.

 
**Serenity:**
I would never have been able to figure out by myself whether I should tell Master what I saw in the library.

 
**Paracelsus:**
I'm just glad everything has come together as it should. I truly am.

 
**Serenity:**
Me too.

 
**Serenity:**
By the way, um... Are you sure about this, Paracelsus?

 
**Serenity:**
Don't you want to talk to this otherworldly King of Knights yourself?

 
**Paracelsus:**
I'm sure.

 
**Serenity:**
...
...

 
**Serenity:**
I don't know anything about the Holy Grail War you two fought in, so...I don't know the right thing to say...

 
**Serenity:**
But, I do know that...

 
**Serenity:**
...it's...sad that you're avoiding him.

 
**Paracelsus:**
Thank you. You really are a kind soul at heart.

 
**Paracelsus:**
But it's all right.
Just hearing you say that is all I need...

 
**Bradamante:**
Hm hm hmm♪

 
**Bradamante:**
Where, oh where, could Ruggiero beee♪
Merlin, Lord Merlin, please show me the waaay♪

 
**Bradamante:**
Ah! Those footsteps... This presence...!
Could it be!?

 
**Arthur:**
Oh. If it isn't&ndash;

 
**Bradamante:**
O-oh gosh! Your Majesty, King of Knights!

 
**Bradamante:**
I, um, I'm so sorry about pressuring you for an autograph the other day!

 
**Bradamante:**
I feel terrible about it! I should've known better than to ask Your Majesty of all people for&ndash;

 
**Arthur:**
Wait, Lady Bradamante.

 
**Arthur:**
I am the one who should apologize to you.
My behavior the other day was truly unworthy of a knight.

 
**Bradamante:**
Wha...? H-huh?

 
**Arthur:**
Lady Bradamante, I never even introduced myself properly.

 
**Arthur:**
If it's not too much to ask, would you permit me to start over and introduce myself properly?

 
**Bradamante:**
Y-yes! O-o-of course!

 
**Bradamante:**
Oh, but...are you sure it's okay for a lowly knight like me to speak to the great King of Knights like this...?

 
**Arthur:**
Of course it is. You and I are comrades now,
both sworn to serve the same Master.

 
**Arthur:**
I am a Saber. My True Name is Arthur Pendragon.

 
**Arthur:**
I am the modern-day wielder of the sacred sword,
and the King of Knights who hails from another world!
