# Jeanne d'Arc

## My God is with Me I

**Jeanne:**
&ndash;I am having a dream.&ndash;"She" is smiling happily.

 
**Jeanne:**
To kill all evil, to trample over evil, it's the right thing to do.

 
**Jeanne:**
That's why she's "happy."
That's why she's laughing.

 
**Jeanne:**
&ndash;Ahh... I don't have that kind of "emotion."
&ndash;But still...

 
**Jeanne:**
Could that be...
"something" that is unattainable?

 
**Jeanne:**
There I was, thinking such foolish thoughts.

 
**Mash:**
Good morning, Senpai.
...Um, how are you feeling?

 
**Mash:**
You look a little pale...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I'm fine.
 


---
 
**Mash:**
Really? You've been fighting battle after battle lately.
Fatigue could be building up in you.

 
**Mash:**
It might be better to rest up today.
I'll let the Doctor know.

 
**Fou:**
Fou.

 
**Mash:**
Oh, Fou.
...Can you look after Fou?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
OK.
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Sure.
 


---
 
**Mash:**
Great, thank you very much.

 
**Fou:**
Fou!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...
 


---
 
**Fou:**
...Fou?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...I'm sleepy...
 


---
 
**Jeanne:**
...ster...Master, Master!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...!?
 


---
 
**Fou:**
Fou!

 
**Jeanne:**
Oh, thank goodness!
This is no place to be sleeping.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Where am I?
 


---
 
**Jeanne:**
I do not know either.
Most likely, this is France, I think...

 
**Jeanne:**
Mash!
Master just woke up.

 
**Mash:**
Master! Thank goodness you're all right.
I've finished scouting the area.

 
**Mash:**
At the moment, I couldn't detect anything unusual.

 
**Mash:**
Communication with the Doctor has been severed, which bothers me...

 
**Mash:**
Master, do you remember anything before ending up here?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Not really...
 


---
 
**Mash:**
I was afraid of that.
...It's the same with us too.

 
**Mash:**
When I woke up, we were in this world.
Master, for the time being, let's set up a camp.

 
**Mash:**
The Doctor will notice something is wrong, and then he'll find a way to get us out.

 
**Mash:**
At the meantime, we'll explore this world.
If we find anything unusual, we'll fix it&ndash;

 
**Mash:**
How does that sound?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I think that's fine.
 


---
 
**Mash:**
Good.
All right, let's get going.

 
**Jeanne:**
Such a lovely breeze.
It stirs in me the feeling I've returned to my hometown.

 
**Mash:**
Is that so...

 
**Mash:**
I was raised in Chaldea, so I don't really get that kind of feeling...

 
**Mash:**
But since you seem so happy, Jeanne, I'm glad for you.

 
**Jeanne:**
I-I am sorry.

 
**Mash:**
Jeanne, your hometown is Domremy, correct?
I wonder if it's close to here.

 
**Mash:**
If you'd like, why don't you pay them a visit?

 
**Jeanne:**
I'm afraid France is a very large country...
I can't ask the both of you to accompany for that long.

 
**Jeanne:**
Besides, I don't believe I should return.

 
**Jeanne:**
When I decided to save France, I made up my mind that I could never return to my village.

 
**Mash:**
Is that so...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Have you ever thought about returning?
 


---
 
**Jeanne:**
...Hmm, you asked a cruel question, Master.
Yes, I have thought about wanting to return.

 
**Jeanne:**
Many, many times. Especially whenever I felt the burning sensation in my old arrow wound.

 
**Mash:**
But you never returned.

 
**Jeanne:**
No. Even if&ndash;everything went well, and there was nothing to prevent me from returning.

 
**Jeanne:**
...I just felt that I should not return.
I mean, I threw it all away.

 
**Jeanne:**
My family, my village, everything.

 
**Mash:**
You can't be serious...

 
**Jeanne:**
Hehe. It's all hypothetical anyway.
I was captured, and put to the flame.

 
**Jeanne:**
It's all over now.

 
**Jeanne:**
If we were to change that, I would end up like how Gilles was then.

 
**Jeanne:**
&ndash;But, I don't understand why.

 
**Jeanne:**
On every occasion, people assumed that I have regrets.

 
**Mash:**
But...that really can't be helped.

 
**Mash:**
You see, people tend to have regrets about their life&ndash;
For simply being young.

 
**Jeanne:**
Yes, you're right.
That is quite correct.

 
**Jeanne:**
Time...If I had time, I would've done what I wanted to do.
Or, I would've done the things I couldn't.

 
**Jeanne:**
...Even if I didn't have either... I could at least have found something that I wanted to do.

 
**Jeanne:**
Humans have unlimited possibilities, and the younger you are, those chances skyrocket.

 
**Jeanne:**
But I simply threw that away.
I was a fool, and certainly no saint.

 
**Mash:**
...Really?
Then, I too have&ndash;

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You too, Mash?
 


---
 
**Mash:**
Oh! No, I mean ...It's nothing.
Forget about that, Master. I can see a town.

 
**Mash:**
Let's go. We must find out what era,
and the situation we're currently in&ndash;

 
**Jeanne:**
...I think...they're fine with me.

 
**Mash:**
So it appears.

 
**Mash:**
Thanks to the Dark Jeanne's rampage in 1431, you got caught in a bad situation...

 
**Mash:**
But this town looks peaceful.

 
**Jeanne:**
Thank goodness.
If it's peaceful, there's nothing that could be better.

 
**Jeanne:**
...Huh?

 
**Mash:**
What's the matter?

 
**Jeanne:**
The castle flag... It's the flag of England.
This place must be...under England's control.

 
**Mash:**
Yes, that certainly isn't the flag of France.

 
**Jeanne:**
Is this one of the situation...
That needs to be fixed?

 
**Mash:**
Certainly if they're oppressed, but it feels unnecessary for now. We shouldn't accidentally cause any trouble...

 
**Jeanne:**
...Absolutely.
That is absolutely right, but...

 
**Jeanne:**
No, I'm sorry. That was just my personal feeling.
I am entirely your Servant now, Fujimaru.

 
**Jeanne:**
At any rate, let's gather some information in the town.

 
**Mash:**
Excuse me.

 
**G：Citizen:**
Yes?
What is it?

 
**Mash:**
Actually&ndash;

 
**Jeanne:**
Pardon me.
May I have a moment?

 
**E：Citizen:**
What do you need?

 
**G：Citizen:**
Hello, there.
What would you like?

 
**Mash:**
There's something I'd like to know...

 
**Mash:**
Master!
This is terrible!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Did you find something?
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
A surprising change after all!?
 


---
 
**Mash:**
No. Nothing has happened.

 
**Jeanne:**
...Yes, that's right. The town is peaceful.
Only tiny squabbles that the law could easily resolve.

 
**Jeanne:**
But it seems in this world, England defeated Charles VII, and all of France came under his domain.

 
**Mash:**
That means...

 
**Jeanne:**
That's right.
I am afraid&ndash;"I do not exist" in this world.

 
**Mash:**
There's really nowhere else left for us to investigate.
I guess we could check out the castle, but that's it.

 
**Jeanne:**
But...I find it hard to believe thatEnglish soldiers would allow us in.

 
**Mash:**
Yes, you're right.
At any rate, let's get out of here.

 
**Mash:**
We weren't able to find any leads at all...
I'm worried about tomorrow.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Tomorrow is...
 


---
 
**Mash:**
Yes, I know, tomorrow is another day.
Hehe. Thank you for saying that.

 
**Jeanne:**
...
...

 
**Jeanne:**
...
...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Oui?
 


---
 
**Jeanne:**
Oh, I'm sorry.
I was praying to the Heaven...

 
**Jeanne:**
Has Mash...gone scouting?

 
**Jeanne:**
&ndash;Master, can I speak with you?

 
**Jeanne:**
...At the end, this world is the epitome of peace.

 
**Jeanne:**
England has set up a proper government.

 
**Jeanne:**
Though it seems the French armies were slain&ndash;
it happened quite a while ago.

 
**Jeanne:**
Master...
Apparently, I was never in this world.

 
**Jeanne:**
France did not rise in defiance, was defeated, became the domain of England&ndash;and now enjoys peace.

 
**Jeanne:**
There may have been many twists and turns, conflicts and other problems...

 
**Jeanne:**
But they overcame them.
...They were able to overcome it.

 
**Jeanne:**
I do not exist in this world.
It means...my very existence...was a waste...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I don't think that's true.
 


---
 
**Jeanne:**
...Thank you. But, it's peaceful.
There no longer is a heart-rending war.

 
**Jeanne:**
It's possible that I might even be in Domremy.
I could be living my life peacefully in that village.

 
**Jeanne:**
Common upbringing, common prayers, even a common romance.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Do you want to see?
 


---
 
**Jeanne:**
...Just a little.
But, I feel it would bring me pain afterwards.

 
**Jeanne:**
I'm sure that the me over there is happy.
So I want to pray for her, just a little bit more.

 
**Jeanne:**
Master, go and join Mash and Fou, all right?

 
**Mash:**
Master, where's Jeanne?

 
**Mash:**
...I see. This indeed is a world where Jeanne doesn't exist&ndash;it is the epitome of peace.

 
**Mash:**
But there's something wrong about this.

 
**Mash:**
If Jeanne doesn't rise, and France is not a reality, there will be big implications on history to follow.

 
**Mash:**
I have...a strange feeling about this...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
It's too peaceful.
 


---
 
**Mash:**
...!

 
**Mash:**
Yes, that is absolutely right.
This world is almost too peaceful.

 
**Mash:**
There's no trace of disturbance anywhere in the town.
You'd think there'll be more resistance for a land that was taken by force.

 
**Mash:**
There was absolutely nothing wrong in the town&ndash;
To me, that's actually more odd.

 
**Mash:**
Let's take Jeanne back to town with us and look again.
We need to dig deeper, I think.

 
**Jeanne:**
...What's this...!?

 
**E：Citizen:**
Hello there.
How are you?

 
**E：Citizen:**
Oh, what's the matter?
What do you need?

 
**Mash:**
...The current time is...1AM...right?

 
**Mash:**
In this era, it would be safe to assume most people would be asleep by now already...

 
**Mash:**
But the streets are just as busy as during the day.
...I knew it, something is off!

 
**Jeanne:**
&ndash;Let's head for the castle. The only place we didn't investigate during the day was that castle.

 
**Mash:**
Sure!

 
**Mash:**
This is...!

 
**Jeanne:**
There's blood everywhere...and I am sensing a colossal amount of magical energy.

 
**Jeanne:**
The wandering ghosts...are...French soldiers...!?
No, there are Englishmen among them, too!

 
**Mash:**
They're attacking us!
Master, orders, please!


**--BATTLE--:**

**Mash:**
Take this!

 
**Mash:**
It's finally...over.

 
**Jeanne:**
The spirits of those dead soldiers... Wandering this world with regrets. It's just too many of them.

 
**Jeanne:**
But in the town, there was not a single ghost.

 
**Jeanne:**
...Wait, who is in charge of the town to begin with?If there are no soldiers here, then what are they&ndash;?

 
**Mash:**
I don't know. But one thing is for certain.
This door won't open any more.

 
**Mash:**
Which means...they don't intend to let us get away.

 
**Jeanne:**
...Let's move on.
I still sense something demonic deeper inside the castle.

 
**Mash:**
I hear footsteps.
Several of them...

 
**Jeanne:**
Remnants?...No, it doesn't appear so.

 
**Jeanne:**
Wait, these are...werebeasts?

 
**Mash:**
Master, orders please!


**--BATTLE--:**

**Jeanne:**
How did those monsters get here?

 
**Mash:**
It makes no sense to me either. However...
I do feel that you're the key, Jeanne.

 
**Jeanne:**
Me?
True, this France is my homeland.

 
**Jeanne:**
I will certainly not allow anyone to ravage it&ndash;
...Huh?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
What is it?
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Notice something?
 


---
 
**Mash:**
Jeanne?

 
**Jeanne:**
Yes, that could be it...

 
**Jeanne:**
We must hurry to the throne!
Most likely, this will solve this mystery!

 
**Mash:**
Wha...?
Are we facing...a demon next?

 
**Jeanne:**
Stay calm, Mash.
That is only a monster that looks like a demon.

 
**Jeanne:**
The one they serve&ndash;is you, isn't it?

 
**???:**
Eeeheeheeheehee! Right you are!
Right you are! It is I who controls this demon!

 
**???:**
My name is Mephistopheles!
I am a Servant granted the class of Caster!

 
**Mash:**
It's you...!

 
**Mephistopheles:**
Oh, so you know who I am?
Is it possible that we have been allies?

 
**Mephistopheles:**
In that case don't worry!
I have been summoned by someone else.

 
**Mephistopheles:**
That is to say, I can kill you all without any problem!

 
**Mash:**
...Ugh...

 
**Jeanne:**
Mephistopheles...is your name, right?
I have one question for you.

 
**Mephistopheles:**
Do you?
Then out with it.

 
**Jeanne:**
What is it with this charade?

 
**Mephistopheles:**
That, you see&ndash;

 
**Jeanne:**
Are you trying to tell me that everything I did was pointless?

 
**Jeanne:**
Or possibly, since France does not exist now&ndash;

 
**Jeanne:**
Are you testing me to see if I will raise my banner and rally the people?

 
**Mephistopheles:**
My, my! That is an excellent answer!
I applaud you! A great round of applause, everyone!

 
**Mephistopheles:**
So, what of it?
How does that make you feel?

 
**Jeanne:**
To be honest, It certainly makes me feel awful.
But in the end, this is all a fantasy.

 
**Jeanne:**
I have nothing to fear from a fantasy.

 
**Mephistopheles:**
However, what about a logical fantasy?

 
**Mephistopheles:**
This town is an actualization of the assumption,
"what if you never existed."

 
**Mephistopheles:**
Jeanne d'Arc!
O Holy Maiden of Salvation!

 
**Mephistopheles:**
You alone do not make the world go round!
Nay. Whether you act or not...the people are happy!

 
**Jeanne:**
...
...

 
**Mephistopheles:**
Neither a king nor a hero, and to borrow your own words, neither a saint as well&ndash;

 
**Mephistopheles:**
How dare you worry about the world's transformation!?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
What's wrong with it?
 


---
 
**Mash:**
...!

 
**Mephistopheles:**
Who asked you?
My question was meant for Jeanne d'Arc&ndash;

 
**Jeanne:**
It's exactly as you say.
...I may have been meaningless.

 
**Mephistopheles:**
Heheheh.

 
**Jeanne:**
&ndash;However, does one only act if there is meaning?

 
**Mephistopheles:**
...What did you say?

 
**Jeanne:**
The fate of mankind is bright, vibrant, yet cruel.

 
**Jeanne:**
Just as life can be full of meaning, death can also have equally as much significance.

 
**Jeanne:**
People act when it's "meaningful."
People don't act when it's "meaningless."

 
**Jeanne:**
Acting or staying immobile while knowing the future.
To me, that is not what humans are.

 
**Jeanne:**
&ndash;Let me put it clearly!

 
**Jeanne:**
I'm not looking at the future.
I merely head down the path I have chosen for myself.

 
**Jeanne:**
Let me be even more explicit.
"Tomorrow is another day"&ndash;That's all there is to it.

 
**Jeanne:**
That is my answer.
Tell that to whoever hired you.

 
**Mephistopheles:**
...I see. I see.
I see. I see!

 
**Mephistopheles:**
So, your heart will not break.
In that case! I will have to physically break you.

 
**Mephistopheles:**
...No. Wait a moment.
I haven't been able to make really witty comments.

 
**Mephistopheles:**
Could it be that I am the one that broke?
Could it be? ...Yes, it could be!

 
**Jeanne:**
Take this world as it is.
Even if you have no hope, and all you have is despair.

 
**Jeanne:**
...So people, without halting, can keep their chins up and move forward.

 
**Jeanne:**
Regardless of brambles, regardless of pitfalls.
I will&ndash;choose a path where I can march forward!!


**--BATTLE--:**

**Mephistopheles:**
Heheeheeheehee!
Is my role to be over so soon!?

 
**Mephistopheles:**
Well, I guess it's all right!
If I am over there, tell myself that I said hello, all right?

 
**Mephistopheles:**
Kind regards for the mischievous Mephistopheles!
Until we meet again!

 
**Jeanne:**
...I'm so sorry for getting you involved in this, Mash and Master.

 
**Jeanne:**
It seems that you and I must again
...fight one more fight together.

 
**Jeanne:**
This is a fight challenging what I believe in.

 
**Jeanne:**
If you would, please, Master.
Will you join me?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Of course.
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I promise.
 


---
 
**Jeanne:**
...Thank you, Master.


## My God is with Me II

**Jeanne:**
Seventeen years living in that village.
Seventeen years with my family.

 
**Jeanne:**
Peaceful days spent helping out my parents and praying at the church. A precious time in my life.

 
**Jeanne:**
...But I threw it all away.
I left it all behind for the sake of victory.

 
**Jeanne:**
Master... Master, please wake up.
...Oh, what a relief. You're awake.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Where am I...?
 
**Jeanne:**
It appears we are on a deserted island.
Well, not deserted now that we are here.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Could this be...?
 


---
 
**Jeanne:**
Master. I believe I am to blame for this. I'm very sorry for causing you trouble in such a busy time...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Don't worry about it.


---
 
**Jeanne:**
...Thank you very much, Master.

 
**Jeanne:**
As for our present situation... It seems there is nothing on this island.

 
**Jeanne:**
It is small. I do not sense anything demonic...
But there are no caves, and nothing man-made either.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Which means...?


---
 
**Jeanne:**
It appears that we are inside a dream, like last time.

 
**Jeanne:**
And there is one more thing that I have noticed:
this time around, we are not in a place from my memory.

 
**Jeanne:**
...I'm embarrassed to say this, but I'm at my wits' end.

 
**Jeanne:**
What shall we do...?

 
**Jeanne:**
Wait a moment. It appears...that there's no need for us to simply sit and wait.

 
**Jeanne:**
See!? There's a ship.
It looks like it is coming towards us...

 
**Jeanne:**
...I sense very strong magical energy coming from that ship. Something is definitely up.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
What do you mean?
 
**Jeanne:**
Based on the situation, it's likely some torment from my past, like last time.

 
**Jeanne:**
...But the theme this time around is strange.

 
**Jeanne:**
I may have seen the sea,
but I've never been aboard a ship...

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Should we ignore it?
 


---
 
**Jeanne:**
Well, as we are alone on an island in the middle of the ocean, getting passage on that ship would seem to be our only choice.

 
**Jeanne:**
Um...unless you are saying that you want to enjoy a leisurely vacation on a deserted island, Master...

 
**Jeanne:**
In which case, I will do my best to make that happen!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
No, please! That's not it!


---
 
**Jeanne:**
Hehe. I know.

 


---
 
**Jeanne:**
Our only problem is that it's unclear what kind of people are aboard the ship. If only they were pirates, it would be easy...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Easy?


---
 
**Jeanne:**
Yes, if I take it on myself to discipline...I mean, persuade them, I'm sure they will listen to us.

 
**Jeanne:**
...Master. Something's coming.

 
**Jeanne:**
They've sent over a small boat.
It seems they want us to get on it.

 
**Jeanne:**
There doesn't seem to be anyone on that larger ship, though... Things just keep getting stranger...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Let's go.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
We're getting on.


---
 
**Jeanne:**
Oh, Master!
Please be careful as you board!

 
**Jeanne:**
It may be a trap!

 
**Jeanne:**
...I had my suspicions... It really IS a ghost ship...

 
**Pirate A:**
 
...Ungh...booze...trea...sure...

 
**Pirate A:**
 
Wenches... Good-looking girls...
Amazons... Tanned... Abs...

 
**Pirate B:**
 
Pink hair... Ditzy...

 
**Pirate C:**
 
Braids... Glasses... Intellectual...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Just like the Beard-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named...
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Why are pirates all the same...?
 


---
 
**Jeanne:**
Even in death, they think almost exactly like Blackbeard, don't they...

 
**Jeanne:**
Either way, I cannot allow them to remain.
The dead deserve a peaceful rest.

 
**Jeanne:**
...Let's go!


**--BATTLE--:**


---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Strange. Something weird slipped in.


---
 
**Jeanne:**
L-looks like we got everyone!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
The ship's starting to move...!?


---
 
**Jeanne:**
It appears the ship itself possesses magical energy. If we stop it prematurely, we will be stuck in the middle of the ocean.

 
**Jeanne:**
...It doesn't seem to want to harm us.
Let's continue our course.

 
**Narration:**
In the end, man always seeks to make the impossible...possible.

 
**Narration:**
This is at once a diabolical power and a ray of hope, a desire to make the unknown...known.

 
**Narration:**
...Yes. That is what being human means.

 
**Narration:**
That very fiendishness is precisely what led to so many discoveries in the Age of Exploration.

 
**Narration:**
Conversely, the desire for righteousness and justice can make people commit acts of unspeakable cruelty&ndash;like when I was burned at the stake.

 
**Narration:**
Man's vices can be forgiven... But what of his virtues?

 
**Jeanne:**
Master!
I see a ship up ahead!

 
**Jeanne:**
Is it...drifting? Its sails are tattered.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Looks like there are people on board.


---
 
**Jeanne:**
They're waving at us.
The ship is coming closer, so I'm going to talk to them.

 
**Jeanne:**
What's going on? Did something happen!?

 
**Crewman:**
Help!
We're about to sink!

 
**Crewman:**
Let us aboard!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Hey, we stopped...
 
**Jeanne:**
Looks like everyone's coming aboard regardless of what we have to say about it...

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Let's help them out.
 
**Jeanne:**
Of course.
Hehe. I'm glad we're on the same page, Master.

 


---
 
**Jeanne:**
You there!
We'll extend the plank to your ship, so please hurry!

 
**Drifter:**
Thank you... Thank you!

 
**Jeanne:**
Women and children first!
You still have time!

 
**Jeanne:**
...

 
**Jeanne:**
Strange... So few people on a ship that size shouldn't be enough to sink it...

 
**Jeanne:**
Is that everyone!?

 
**Crewman:**
No, there's more!
There's still two on board!

 
**Crewman:**
Hey, you two!

 
**Jeanne:**
Eh...? No...it can't be... Impossible...!

 
**Jeanne:**
Wh-why, why are you here!?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Jeanne...?


---
 
**Jeanne:**
Why are you here!?
Mother...!?

 
**Crewman:**
Oh come now. You don't even know the half of it yet!

 
**Mephistopheles:**
...Hello, hello! Long time no see!
It's been, oh, a few days since we last met, I believe?

 
**Mephistopheles:**
Everybody stop!

 
**Jeanne:**
Mephistopheles!
What the hell are you...!?

 
**Mephistopheles:**
Well, they're just background characters. I wouldn't want them to cause trouble, so just ignore them.

 
**Mephistopheles:**
...Now then, Jeanne d'Arc. Excluding me, there are two people left on board this ship.

 
**Mephistopheles:**
One is your own mother!

 
**Mephistopheles:**
Thank you so much for coming all the way from France!

 
**Mephistopheles:**
Just kidding! Keheeheehee!

 
**Mephistopheles:**
But wait, there's more! Our last guest of honor needs no introduction...but I'm gonna do it anyway!

 
**Mephistopheles:**
He is...the filthy bishop who, under England's orders, led you to your execution at the stake!

 
**Mephistopheles:**
A real human dumpster fire... The man who was bribed for his judgment, who consigned your soul to the flames!

 
**Mephistopheles:**
The man who laughed and jeered while you were burning. Yes, you should know who it is by now!

 
**Jeanne:**
Pierre Cauchon!

 
**Mephistopheles:**
Eeexaaactly! Now let's untie these two!

 
**Mephistopheles:**
This won't hurt one itty-bitty bit, okeydokey?

 
**Pierre Cauchon:**
...P-p-please don't pull...
Ouch! Ow! Ow! Ow!

 
**Mother:**
...Oh, Jeanne...

 
**Mephistopheles:**
Oh, but that ship of yours? It can only carry one more. Let more than that aboard...and it will surely founder!

 
**Mephistopheles:**
Now, Jeanne d'Arc!
Make your decision!

 
**Mephistopheles:**
Who will you save? Your mother, who has loved you your entire life, or this old geezer who scorned you to the very end?

 
**Mephistopheles:**
Well? Well? WELL!? Whatcha gonna do!?

 
**Jeanne:**
...Oh. The answer is easy.

 
**Mephistopheles:**
Huh?

 
**Jeanne:**
I will simply get off. They can have my place.

 
**Mephistopheles:**
...There was not a bit of hesitation there.
Shoulda seen that coming!

 
**Jeanne:**
...Mother. You are probably an illusion...

 
**Jeanne:**
But I'm glad I could see you once more. Now, please, board our ship.

 
**Mother:**
B-but...

 
**Jeanne:**
Bishop Cauchon.
...You go too. Hurry.

 
**Pierre Cauchon:**
...

 
**Pierre Cauchon:**
I-I am not wrong.
You are a witch!

 
**Jeanne:**
...And that is fine.
What a stubborn man you are.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Come back!
 
**Jeanne:**
No. This is the right thing to do.
I'm very sorry, Master.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I'm going with you!
 
**Jeanne:**
...

 
**Jeanne:**
Wh-what a surprise.

 
**Jeanne:**
I don't know what to say, Master... I'm happy, but such an attitude will lead to an early death for you!

 
**Jeanne:**
I'm one to talk? Y-yes, that's true, but...!

 


---
 
**Mephistopheles:**
...How could you forgive a man like Pierre Cauchon?

 
**Jeanne:**
My mother's sadness will fade one day, just as, in time, my distaste for the bishop will disappear too.

 
**Jeanne:**
It is the sole province of God to judge what is evil.
As humans, all we can do is fight against it.

 
**Jeanne:**
This man may never have my forgiveness, but salvation is a different matter.

 
**Jeanne:**
If it's possible, I shall save him.
However many times I must.

 
**Mephistopheles:**
But didn't you hear what his last words were?
There was not an ounce of remorse in them.

 
**Jeanne:**
It is not for me to demand remorse, regret, or repentance. After all, humans cannot be other than what they are.

 
**Jeanne:**
...Mephistopheles. This ship is going to sink, correct?

 
**Jeanne:**
You should move over to our ship one as well. You may be a Servant, but I'm sure it would still be a problem for you if you were to be stranded out at sea.

 
**Mephistopheles:**
Oh my. You really are an interesting person...to your own detriment!

 
**Mephistopheles:**
But to the individual who had summoned me, I'm sure this is such a buzzkill!

 
**Mephistopheles:**
I'm sure they are positively apoplectic right now!

 
**Mephistopheles:**
So now I shall demonstrate that your choice was a mistake!

 
**Jeanne:**
Eh...!?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
A Noble Phantasm!?


---
 
**Jeanne:**
Wha...!?

 
**Mephistopheles:**
I did not want you to take this game so seriously!
This is merely an imitation! A sham!

 
**Mephistopheles:**
Ah, but then again, these things are imitations that are so very close to being real.

 
**Mephistopheles:**
At least, your real mother would probably have reacted the same way. And even Pierre Cauchon would definitely say what he said!

 
**Jeanne:**
Mephistopheles...!!!

 
**Mephistopheles:**
...Ehehehe! Very good!
I do so ADORE that look on your face!

 
**Jeanne:**
Master! That ship is no longer safe!
Please jump over here!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
O-okay!


---
 
**Mephistopheles:**
Aha. So Master's come too.
Well then... Come, my Shadow Servants!

 
**Jeanne:**
Shadow Servants...!
Just who are you working for!?

 
**Mephistopheles:**
Oh, don't you worry your little head about that.
It's playtime!!!


**--BATTLE--:**

**Mephistopheles:**
Keeheeheehee! I lost again!

 
**Jeanne:**
You were a strong opponent!

 
**Mephistopheles:**
Kahahahahahaha!
That's not how it was supposed to be, Jeanne d'Arc!

 
**Mephistopheles:**
Our loss was determined the very moment you chose to sacrifice your own life without hesitation!

 
**Mephistopheles:**
Why? Don't you get it?
I am the great demon, Mephistopheles!

 
**Mephistopheles:**
If you don't fall from grace, the only other choice is for us to lose!

 
**Mephistopheles:**
Well, looks like I'm still going to get overworked!
Thanks for playing!

 
**Mephistopheles:**
See you again! Byeee!!!

 
**Jeanne:**
He disappeared again.
It doesn't seem like we defeated him, though...

 
**Jeanne:**
Still, I'm starting to understand what his intentions are.

 
**Jeanne:**
Let's do our&ndash;

 
**Jeanne:**
Master? Um, are you by chance...mad?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You shouldn't throw your life away recklessly.
 
**Jeanne:**
Errr... But at that moment, there were no other options...

 
**Jeanne:**
Well I, um, thought that would be the best solution...

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Please don't die.
 
**Jeanne:**
Um. Th-that line really gets to me...

 
**Jeanne:**
But in that situation, the only choice I could have made was to do what&ndash;

 


---
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I know.


---
 
**Jeanne:**
I'm glad you understand!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I'm still mad.


---
 
**Jeanne:**
...I-I-I'm sorry!

 
**Jeanne:**
I know! Chaldea!
When we get back to Chaldea, I'll treat you to anything!

 
**Jeanne:**
Whether we go to Boudica or Emiya...
It'll be your choice!

 
**Jeanne:**
My journey will continue.
But the end is also on the horizon.

 
**Jeanne:**
Even if that journey ends, I would like to continue traveling with you, Master. To fight as a Heroic Spirit.

 
**Jeanne:**
Protecting humanity.
Protecting virtue.

 
**Jeanne:**
That is what I wish for, and nothing more.


## My God is with Me III

**Narration:**
...I don't feel pain from being burned.
...I don't feel grief from being cursed.

 
**Narration:**
The only thing I feel is immense, overwhelming heartbreak. It's not my body that's being consumed, but my soul.

 
**Narration:**
Since I don't seek salvation in ascension,
the stake doesn't fill me with despair.

 
**Narration:**
Instead, I find myself entranced by the flames.
The beautiful, magnificent flames.

 
**Narration:**
Even as they reduce my flesh to ash,
I can feel the holy flames purifying my soul.

 
**Narration:**
Thus began Jeanne d'Arc the Servant. The young girl's final moments, now little more than hazy memories.

 
**E：???:**
...Wake uuup!
Wake up, wake up, wake up pup pup pup!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
That voice... Isn't that...


---
 
**E：???:**
Wake up, or you'll start to hear my shrillest laugh in surround sooound!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Are you trying to curse me!?


---
 
**Mephistopheles:**
Theeere you are. Wakey wakey, eggs and bakey!
It's me, Mephistopheles!

 
**Mephistopheles:**
What an unexpected, but delightful,
surprise to find you here!

 
**Mephistopheles:**
May I ask what brings you out this way, Master?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...Can I go back to bed now?


---
 
**Mephistopheles:**
No, no, no, nonono! We are long since past that!
Yes! Long since past!

 
**Mephistopheles:**
Sadly, our present situation is sliiightly less than ideal for sleepyheads!

 
**Mephistopheles:**
Why is that, your pleading eyes ask?
The answer is simple.

 
**Mephistopheles:**
Because the way things are going,
the world will soon be destroyed!

 
**Mephistopheles:**
...All right, let's go over this world.

 
**Mephistopheles:**
As I'm sure you've already guessed,
this is a non-dream dream. You know, that old saw.

 
**Mephistopheles:**
There's no getting in touch with Chaldea here.
We may as well be cut off from the entire timeline.

 
**Mephistopheles:**
The only place this world connects to is itself.

 
**Mephistopheles:**
I believe it belongs to Jeanne d'Arc.

 
**Mephistopheles:**
And your task here is to destroy it.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Okay...so what about you?
 
**Mephistopheles:**
Ooh, harsh! Well, you know,
I have my own reasons for being here.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
What are you doing here, Mephy?
 
**Mephistopheles:**
Maybe I'm here because, of all the Servants in Chaldea, I'm the closest there is to everyone's image of the Devil?

 
**Mephistopheles:**
Oh, and I also have my own connection to that Ruler, as you know.

 


---
 
**Mephistopheles:**
Now, on that note, let's be on our way!
The final battlefield awaits!

 
**Mephistopheles:**
Oh, I do beg your pardon.

 
**Mephistopheles:**
Final battle or no, even I must admit that showing up dressed like the Devil would be in poor taste!

 
**Mephistopheles:**
So, without further ado...!

 
**E：Mephistopheles:**
What do you think?
Now I look just like any other soldier!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Wow, that's handy...!


---
 
**E：Mephistopheles:**
Of course, it might be easier to just cast a perception inhibitor spell and be done with it, but this way is more fun.

 
**E：Mephistopheles:**
Now then, you there, soldier. It sounds like the whole town is abuzz. Pray tell, what might be going on?

 
**Soldier:**
Oh, they're about to hold an execution.

 
**E：Mephistopheles:**
An execution, you say?

 
**Soldier:**
Aye, they say Jeanne d'Arc finally confessed to heresy.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Wha...!?


---
 
**E：Mephistopheles:**
My, my, whatever are we going to do now?

 
**E：Mephistopheles:**
Historically, this is where she is meant to be burned at the stake.

 
**E：Mephistopheles:**
Even if, hypothetically speaking, we were to Rayshift in and save her at the last second...

 
**E：Mephistopheles:**
...the end result would almost certainly be the same.

 
**E：Mephistopheles:**
Whether Jeanne is burned at the stake,
or ends up dying of old age...

 
**E：Mephistopheles:**
...her role in history has come to an end,
and I doubt it would have any other effect.

 
**E：Mephistopheles:**
If she succeeded at avoiding the stake and tried to stand on history's stage once more, I imagine there would be secret efforts made to...you know.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Assassinate her...?
 
**E：Mephistopheles:**
Indeed. I imagine Charles VII, or perhaps someone else, would betray her, and she would meet a bloody end nonetheless.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Betray her?
 
**E：Mephistopheles:**
Indeed. I'm guessing she would be betrayed again,
and end up getting murdered anyway.

 


---
 
**E：Mephistopheles:**
Aaanyway, none of that matters in this world!

 
**E：Mephistopheles:**
There may be nothing to stop us from leaving her to her fate, but there is nothing stopping us from saving her, either!

 
**Citizen:**
It's Jeanne d'Arc!
It's the witch!

 
**Citizen:**
Poor thing. I don't see why they have to execute her.

 
**Citizen:**
Hey, they say she's a witch.

 
**Citizen:**
Forget the cross! Give her a good stoning!

 
**Citizen:**
Is God going to punish all of us for this?
Or just the priests carrying it out?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Wait a second. That Jeanne is&ndash;
 


---
 
**E：Mephistopheles:**
Indeed, she is. Or isn't, rather.

 
**E：Mephistopheles:**
That's neither Jeanne the Rogue Servant,
nor the actual Jeanne from history.

 
**E：Mephistopheles:**
That's Jeanne d'Arc...the Ruler.

 
**E：Mephistopheles:**
Which perhaps means that if she's burned at the stake now, she may just cease to be your Servant.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
What!? We've got to do something!
 


---
 
**Prosecutor:**
Order! We will now carry out the sentence of execution on Jeanne d'Arc!

 
**Prosecutor:**
This girl claimed she was a saint! She claimed that she heard the voice of God! She defied the Church!

 
**Prosecutor:**
She had no compunctions about engaging in the worst kind of heresy. She is beyond redemption!

 
**E：Mephistopheles:**
My, oh my. This is true of all these sorts of witch trials, of course...

 
**E：Mephistopheles:**
...but I do so enjoy this gloomy atmosphere!

 
**E：Mephistopheles:**
Hm? Why are you looking at me like that?
Do you think I'm not normal or something?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
To put it lightly.
**E：Mephistopheles:**
Oh...

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Yes, but then again, you are Mephy, after all.
 
**E：Mephistopheles:**
Hohoho, you know me so well! No wonder you've been able to keep me on as a Servant!

 


---
 
**Prosecutor:**
Do you have anything to say for yourself, Jeanne d'Arc?

 
**Jeanne:**
...
...

 
**Prosecutor:**
...It would appear you do not.
Very well, light the fire!

 
**E：Mephistopheles:**
...So, what are you going to do now, Master?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I'm going to save her.
 
**E：Mephistopheles:**
Ahh, just as I thought!
In that case, I think I'll join you!

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Are you coming with, Mephy?
 
**E：Mephistopheles:**
Oho. So your going to save her is a foregone conclusion, and the only question is whether I will be joining you, hm?

 
**E：Mephistopheles:**
Of course I will!

 


---
 
**E：Mephistopheles:**
But first, another change of clothes...

 
**E：Mephistopheles:**
Ah tah ta tah♪
Let's go do this thiiing♪

 
**A：Prosecutor:**
Hm? You there, who are you!?
Soldiers, stop them!

 
**Mephistopheles:**
Annnd switch!

 
**Soldier:**
Y-yeowch!? That's hot!

 
**Soldier:**
What the hell was that!?
That man... Don't tell me he's...

 
**Soldier:**
The Devil!?

 
**Prosecutor:**
Settle down! Settle down!
Soldiers, kill that jester!

 
**Mephistopheles:**
Nobody's killing meee!

 
**Jeanne:**
Ah...
You...!?

 
**Prosecutor:**
Khh...! Never mind that!
Just light the cursed fire!

 
**Prosecutor:**
So what if the Devil has come to save the witch!?
Kill them both and be done with it!

 
**Jeanne:**
...Please, stop this.
Don't...!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Sorry, but I can't leave you to burn!


---
 
**Jeanne:**
I mean it!
This is wrong...!

 
**Jeanne:**
I...I'm supposed to...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
That doesn't matter!


---
 
**Jeanne:**
Master...!

 
**Jeanne:**
...I...

 
**D：???:**
...You wished for it, didn't you, Jeanne?

 
**Jeanne:**
Huh...?

 
**Prosecutor:**
You said it, you said it, you said it!
We heard you, we heard you, we heard you!

 
**Prosecutor:**
You did all hear that, didn't you everyone?
[♂ He /♀️ She} said it plain as day, didn't [♂ he /♀️ she}?

 
**Prosecutor:**
Fujimaru said [♂ he /♀️ she} was going to save Jeanne d'Arc! And what's more...she herself asked to be saved!

 
**D：???:**
That's right, Jeanne d'Arc has wished to be saved!
Now, Jeanne. Darkness has awoken within you!

 
**D：???:**
That's enough of the jester act!
It's time to show who I really am.

 
**Jeanne:**
What the...!?
You're...!

 
**C：Mephistopheles (?):**
My, my, oh my, my, my. What can the humble prosecutor Mephistopheles do for you?

 
**Mephistopheles:**
What the? Another one of me? You know, I could swear something like this happened before.

 
**Jeanne:**
...This must be the next part of that dream...
And that must mean you're here.

 
**D：???:**
Figured it out, did you? Well, I guess it was getting kind of obvious by this point.

 
**Jeanne:**
A version of me dressed in black...! But I thought you disappeared after the Holy Grail was collected!?

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
...It did. Since I was the Holy Grail,
I was fated to disappear once it was collected.

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
But it turns out that the Holy Grail was nothing more than my source of magical energy. I exist because that's what Gilles wished for.

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
Even after the Grail was recovered and that time period repaired, his wish remained.

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
Nor did the wish itself ever disappear.
In which case, why wouldn't I still exist?

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
That said, I'd lost almost all of my power. If I'd been left to my own devices, I would have disappeared...

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
But then...you stopped me, Jeanne.

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
You acknowledged my existence without even realizing the truth.

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
You discovered your own dark side...one that was never meant to exist in the first place.

 
**Jeanne:**
But...I...

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
That's right. You didn't accept me.
You said I couldn't possibly exist.

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
...And you were right.
But I still had something to say about it.

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
 
I exist!

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
Whatever the circumstances of my creation,
I was still created!

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
...But even though I could advocate for my own existence, there was only so much else I could do.

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
Namely, create a small world, summon Mephistopheles, and poke whatever darkness you had inside.

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
...Sure, my last two attempts might have ended in failure.

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
But this stake...that was immutable.

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
This was the place where Jeanne d'Arc's dreams came to an end.

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
Even if Jeanne herself had given up and decided to offer herself to the Lord...introducing a third party changes things considerably.

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
Especially one who wishes for nothing more than to save her, and is willing to act on that wish.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
In other words...


---
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
Now do you get it? That's right!
I'm talking about you, Fujimaru!

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
You've gone and proven that Jeanne d'Arc did have a secret desire to escape her fate!

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
In her very last moments, she saw hope in you.

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
And so she wanted to be saved!
She wished for it! Desperately!

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
But she thought that wish was wrong,
was evidence of her own dark side!

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
Once she decided to abandon what was right and cling to her own life, that was the moment I took root inside her!

 
**Mephistopheles:**
My, my, you don't say.
Is that true, other me?

 
**C：Mephistopheles (?):**
Oh yes, quite true. Hmm, it's rather difficult to tell us apart, isn't it? Let me give myself another name.

 
**Mephistopheles (Enemy):**
I'll be Mephistopheles with “(Enemy)” after my name.

 
**Mephistopheles (Enemy):**
Jeanne d'Arc's other half summoned me here.

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
Of course, just about everyone wants to stay alive,
and there's really nothing wrong with that.

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
But for her and me...that wasn't true.

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
Right, Jeanne?

 
**Jeanne:**
Ghh...!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Jeanne!
 
**Jeanne:**
I was careless... I never expected to be forced to acknowledge her like this...!

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Are you okay!?
 
**Jeanne:**
...Yes.
But, it looks like...I really did end up acknowledging her.

 


---
 
**Jeanne:**
But we can talk later.
Right now, we need to stall her!

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
This is it, Mephistopheles!
The final showdown!

 
**Mephistopheles (Enemy):**
Indeed, indeed. Everyone, I would just like you to know that I'm truly sorry about this. ...Release!

 
**Jeanne:**
Khh...!

 
**Mephistopheles:**
My, my. What shall we do now, Master?

 
**Mephistopheles:**
I really must say that I think retreat remains an eminently viable option.

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
...Good point. I suppose I am in your debt.

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
If you want to wake up now, that's fine with me.
Do that, and I'll let you go.

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
It'll be just like you never had a Ruler at all.

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
That'll take care of everything.

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
But...if you're planning on defeating me,
not that you could...

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
...Well, at that point you saving my life won't matter. You'll get no mercy from me.

 
**Mephistopheles (Enemy):**
I'd get out of here if I were you.
Go on, other me, persuade them!

 
**Mephistopheles:**
Good point.
All right, here's my attempt at persuasion.

 
**Mephistopheles:**
Master, I'd get out of here if I were you.

 
**Mephistopheles:**
That shock alone has already transferred over half of Jeanne's power to her Alter.

 
**Mephistopheles:**
Even if I joined you two,
we'd all be hopelessly outmatched!

 
**Mephistopheles:**
You do remember what your obligations are as the Master destined to save humanity, don't you?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Yeah, I remember.


---
 
**Mephistopheles:**
...Then what's your answer?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I'm going to save her!
 
**Jeanne:**
I had a feeling you were going to say that!

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I'm going to fight, and I'm going to win!
 
**Mephistopheles:**
I knew it!

 


---
 
**Mephistopheles (Enemy):**
Oh, my, what happened, other me?
That wasn't very persuasive at all.

 
**Mephistopheles:**
Of course not!

 
**Mephistopheles:**
If you think this is enough to stop [♂ him /♀️ her},
you don't know Chaldea's Master at all!

 
**Mephistopheles:**
Wooo! That. Was. Awesooome!
I just wanted to say that, naturally!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Whatever you say.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Gah! My eyes!
 


---
 
**Both:**
?

 
**Jeanne:**
Master, are you sure about this?

 
**Jeanne:**
I'm at less than half my full power right now.
We may both be Rulers, but she has the upper hand.

 
**Jeanne:**
I'd bet the two Mephistopheles are evenly matched, too. There's no way we can win.

 
**Jeanne:**
Even knowing all that, are you sure you still want to fight?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
We've both seen worse, right?
 
**Jeanne:**
...!

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
...!

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
You didn't run.
 
**Jeanne:**
...No, I didn't.

 


---
 
**Jeanne:**
That way of thinking isn't going to get you very far.
But, then again, that might be why I was summoned in the first place.

 
**Jeanne:**
Even if I am just a ghost who only happened to exist at one point...I think I can still help you.

 
**Mephistopheles (Enemy):**
So we're going to fight after all, are we?
What a shame.

 
**Mephistopheles:**
Indeed. I'm a pacifist, I'll have you know!

 
**Mephistopheles (Enemy):**
But, I guess that's okay!

 
**Mephistopheles:**
After all, I'm Mephistopheles.
I make fun of saints and demons alike!

 
**Mephistopheles (Enemy):**
You know it!

 
**Mephistopheles (Enemy):**
Okay, ghostly boys and girls, I hope you like playing with fire, 'cause the Dragon Witch is about to roast you alive!

 
**Jeanne:**
...Everything else aside, having two of him around is extremely confusing!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Couldn't agree more!


---
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
...Ugh, that clown is a real pain.
Well, at least I can fight jester with jester.

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
Now, what are we going to do about these scattered memories of yours?

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
Specifically, this group of ordinary,
decent folk whipped into a mob frenzy!

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
Look at the anger on their faces, just like monsters! Hmm... I think I'll go ahead and turn them into REAL monsters.

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
Well, Jeanne d'Arc?
Think you can defeat me now!?

 
**Jeanne:**
I don't know if I can defeat you,
but my pennant is telling me I have to try.

 
**Jeanne:**
Let's go, Master!


**--BATTLE--:**

**Jeanne:**
The Lord forgives all sin and wickedness. He rescues the lives that crawl forth from the grave, grieves for them, and takes mercy upon them...

 
**Mephistopheles (Enemy):**
My, my, how impressive! It looks like ghosts just aren't enough to put up a decent fight anymore!

 
**Mephistopheles (Enemy):**
In that case, how about this?
Come on up, anonymous Servants!

 
**Jeanne:**
Shadow Servants!

 
**Mephistopheles:**
What, them? Those are just a few shadows that happened to be hanging around.

 
**Mephistopheles:**
They're not even self-aware.
Trust me, we have nothing to worry about!


**--BATTLE--:**

**Jeanne:**
Got you...!

 
**Mephistopheles (Enemy):**
My, my, so you did!
Well, Master? What's the plan now?

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
...Don't tell me you're worried I might lose?
You know they call me the Dragon Witch!

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
I wield disaster as a weapon. I was made to sow despair wherever I so much as breathe.

 
**Jeanne:**
Oh no. Don't tell me...!

 
**Mephistopheles:**
Wooo! That's amazing! I haven't felt my eyes almost pop out of their sockets like that in a long time!

 
**Jeanne:**
Faf...nir...!

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
That's right! Fafnir, my adorable personal dragon. And this time...he's going to rid me of the righteous Holy Maiden once and for all.

 
**Jeanne:**
...Even so, I am not going to lose!

 
**Jeanne:**
It doesn't matter who you call to come fight on your behalf! We'll beat them all!

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
What, because of God's blessing?

 
**Jeanne:**
In part. The Lord is always by my side...always helping, even if only a little.

 
**Jeanne:**
But the other part is, of course,
thanks to my friends and my Master.

 
**Jeanne:**
They console me when I'm powerless to do something,
and pick me up when I slump in defeat.

 
**Jeanne:**
That's all the salvation I need.

 
**Jeanne:**
I may not have been saved in history,
but I know their desire to help me is genuine.

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
...I see you're as much of a teacher's pet as ever.
God, you piss me off.

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
Fine, then. Let's settle this once and for all. We'll see who wins: me and my dragon, or you and your Master.

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
Let's have a nice pleasant duel to the death, Jeanne d'Arc!

 
**Jeanne:**
Just what I had in mind.
Come at me, Fafnir, Mephistopheles.

 
**Jeanne:**
Come at me...my other self who fell from grace.
The Alter I once so vehemently rejected!

 
**Mephistopheles:**
Wonderful. Then this will truly be the final showdown!
At last, her long and winding journey will come to an end!

**Fujimaru 1:**
I'll back you both up with all I've got!

**--BATTLE--:**

**Jeanne Alter:**
No...way...

 
**Mephistopheles (Enemy):**
Welp, looks like we lost...

 
**Mephistopheles (Enemy):**
But then again, I suppose there was only so far I could go as a jester. What a shame. Maybe we should invite someone more fun to join our little party.

 
**Mephistopheles (Enemy):**
Then again, maybe the Counter Force went easy on us, pitting me against you?

 
**Mephistopheles:**
Not at all. If anything, I think it was a dreadfully cold-blooded decision. This Lord guy seems like a real sadist, if you ask me.

 
**Mephistopheles:**
After all, if I hadn't been here,
that woman you're with would never admit defeat.

 
**Mephistopheles:**
The fact that you and I are equally matched means that she has only herself to blame if she loses.

 
**Mephistopheles (Enemy):**
Ohhh.
Nooow I see!

 
**Mephistopheles (Enemy):**
Well, there you have it, Master.
I'm so terribly sorry.

 
**Mephistopheles (Enemy):**
It may not have looked like it, but I really was doing my best out there, you know?

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
How...?
It shouldn't have been possible for me to lose!

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
You lost your power!
I was the one who took it!

 
**Jeanne:**
I didn't defeat you alone.
We did it together.

 
**Jeanne:**
...Yes, I did end up creating you.
But I didn't regret that at all.

 
**Jeanne:**
Instead...I was happy. Happy to know I was actually the sort of person who wanted to live on more than anything.

 
**Jeanne:**
Happy to know I was the sort of ordinary person who felt joy at seeing others come to her rescue.

 
**Jeanne:**
So I was genuinely happy to see that Master didn't think twice about saving me.

 
**Jeanne:**
I didn't fight as a Holy Maiden. I fought you as just another Servant, and I won. That's all there is to it.

 
**Jeanne:**
That isn't about faith,
however weak or strong it might be.

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
...What a disgrace.
Guess this is really it for me.

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
Nothing I did worked out, right to the end...

 
**Jeanne:**
...I don't know if I'd say that. I did acknowledge you as the darkness that exists inside me.

 
**Jeanne:**
You're another side of my Heroic Spirit. You could end up getting registered as an Anti-Heroic Spirit.

 
**Jeanne:**
Who knows? Maybe there will come a time when your power will be exactly what is necessary to save the day.

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
...Is that supposed to be a joke? I'd rather disappear forever than get dragged into something like that.

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
But if I have no choice,
I hope I can at least change my class first.

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
I'm not cut out to be a Ruler.

 
**Jeanne:**
...And that brings my story to a close.
Master...thank you for everything. Sincerely.

**Fujimaru 1:**
You know, thinking back on it now...

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I kind of get the impression this was all my fault...


---
 
**Jeanne:**
Yes, it may well be.

 
**Jeanne:**
But isn't that how it is with friends and allies?
I know I've made plenty of trouble for you.

 
**Jeanne:**
Besides...it's like I said earlier.

 
**Jeanne:**
This made me really happy.

 
**Jeanne:**
I was so happy I got to see you running in to save me.

 
**Jeanne:**
No other reward could possibly compare to that.

 
**Jeanne:**
That goes for you too, Mephistopheles.
I was so happy that you came to save me.

 
**Mephistopheles:**
Reeeally? I'm not used to this sort of thing,
so I'm not quite sure how to respond to that.

 
**Mephistopheles:**
But, as long as you enjoyed yourself, that's all that matters. Even better if it made you smile!

 
**Mephistopheles:**
Ahh, it really is fun being a Servant.

 
**Mephistopheles:**
This little adventure truly was like a dream come true, so to speak! Well, see you later!

 
**Jeanne:**
Haha, whatever you might be, devil or otherwise...there's nothing more beautiful, or more fun, than joining forces and fighting together.

 
**Jeanne:**
All right, Master, what do you say we awaken from this dream?

 
**Jeanne:**
Your journey to protect humanity is still far from over, after all...

 
**Narration:**
...And so ends one of the stories of Jeanne d'Arc.

 
**Narration:**
Jeanne would go on to experience many things, and eventually, an Avenger of her would be born as well...

 
**Narration:**
But that...is a story for another time.
