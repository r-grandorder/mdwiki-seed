# Sherlock Holmes

## Thinking of the Lost Time

**Holmes:**
Good day, everyone.

**Holmes:**
My name is Sherlock Holmes. I am the world's greatest detective, as well as its only consulting one.

**Holmes:**
I am both the progenitor of all detectives, and the essence of the very concept&ndash;one who reveals truth.

**Holmes:**
Today, I am here to guide you all towards a new mystery, and the facts that lie at its core.

**Holmes:**
I originally became involved with Chaldea when I began investigating the Incineration of Humanity incident in 2018, when I played a part in the Fourth and Sixth Singularities.

**Holmes:**
However, once Goetia, the King of Demon Gods, was defeated, and his plan to incinerate humanity foiled, the world was faced with a new crisis.

**Holmes:**
I speak, of course, of the bleaching of humanity&ndash;an event that has resulted in the entire earth being wiped clean save for the Lostbelts.

**Holmes:**
As you all surely know, this incident led to my gaining an official administrative advisor position at Chaldea.

**Holmes:**
And I must say, it suits me rather nicely.

**Holmes:**
While I continue to act as a detective, naturally, I've also found the work of supporting a larger organization to be quite stimulating.

**Holmes:**
Unfortunately, I'm afraid there
is little room for optimism...

**Holmes:**
...given the sheer scale of this case.

**Holmes:**
My current theory is that in a sense, this bleached Earth phenomenon pairs directly with the Incineration of Humanity.

**Holmes:**
When Goetia incinerated all of human history, he did so by starting in 2018 and going back in time to collect the necessary energy.

**Holmes:**
That is to say, the infamous king never bothered to collect energy from the future, because he knew there would be no human history from which to collect.

**Holmes:**
So using 2018 as a single turning point, he headed back towards the past and succeeded at destroying humanity.

**Holmes:**
Conversely, this great reset has left the past untouched, destroying humanity now, robbing it of its future.

**Holmes:**
Given these facts, one could argue that the King of Demon Gods' plan was intended to avoid this very future...

**Holmes:**
...as it involved incinerating humanity and remaking Earth before it was wiped clean.

**Holmes:**
It is a dreadful problem and a horrific mystery. Even Goetia believed it beyond his ability to resolve.

**Holmes:**
Bad as things are, we cannot afford to stop seeking a solution. Not if we are to regain humanity, and everything else that was lost.

**Holmes:**
We cannot&ndash;will not give up.
No matter what manner of hell may await us...

**Holmes:**
...we must continue onward. We must.

**Holmes:**
I, in turn, will naturally continue to provide my full support.

**Holmes:**
I WILL solve this case, even if I must consume every last bit of energy in my Spirit Core to do so.

**Holmes:**
Why, you ask? Why else?

**Holmes:**
Because...I am the greatest detective.I am Sherlock Holmes.

**Jekyll:**
...Okay, Mr. Holmes, I've finished changing the security levels on all the Lostbelt records.

**Jekyll:**
What would you like to do about the library's request for hard copies of them?

**Holmes:**
That's quite all right. I'm happy to authorize it.

**Holmes:**
All parties involved with those incidents already have the clearance to view those records freely, so it shouldn't pose a problem.

**Holmes:**
More so given that these hard copies will be for Novum Chaldea's own underground library. There is not a single person here who isn't part of Chaldea, and therefore involved in some way.

**Holmes:**
I'll be sure to let the director know about this.
Thank you, Mr. Jekyll, that'll be all.

**Jekyll:**
You're welcome.
Please let me know if there's anything else I can do.

**Jekyll:**
I'll be cooped up in the central computer room for
a while to assist Ms. Da Vinci and Sir Babbage...

**Jekyll:**
...but if you need my help with anything,
I can be here at a moment's notice.

**Holmes:**
Much obliged.

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Are those two friends or something?


---

**Fujimaru 2:**
They seem like they've known each other for a long time.


---

**Mash:**
I know what you mean, Senpai!

**Mash:**
They seem very comfortable working together,
if not outright close with each other.

**Mash:**
It really is like they're old friends!

**Mash:**
Then again, maybe it's no surprise considering when the books based on parts of their lives came out.

**Mash:**
“The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde” was written in the late nineteenth century, and while Sherlock Holmes novels continued to be published well into the twentieth century...

**Mash:**
...the first ones also came out around the end of the nineteenth! Not to mention they're both set in London!

**Jekyll:**
Huh?

**Jekyll:**
Ah, now I see. I thought I had told you two this,
but I guess I never got around to it.

**Jekyll:**
That's right. I knew Mr. Holmes back when I was alive. He was always very kind to me.

**Jekyll:**
We've only had time for brief hellos here and there since we both came to Chaldea...

**Jekyll:**
...but now that I finally know how to use a computer,
I thought I would help him out when I can.

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
So you knew each other when you were both alive, huh? That explains it!


---

**Holmes:**
Hahaha.

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Wait. In your...past life, Holmes?


---

**Holmes:**
Hahahaha.

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Come to think of it, you never did give me a straightanswer about whether you really existed or not...


---

**Holmes:**
Are you certain? That particular topic can get rather thorny quite quickly, to be honest...

**Holmes:**
Indeed, I'm always willing to obfuscate when necessary.

**Holmes:**
While the irony of me saying this as a short-lived Heroic Spirit is not lost on me, as a general rule, one mustn't try to unravel Mystics or the past.

**Holmes:**
Of course, that's not to say Mystics are a significant part of either Mr. Jekyll's past or my own...

**Holmes:**
But regardless, one's past is one's past.
Dig too deep, and&ndash;

**Holmes:**
...

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Holmes?


---

**Fujimaru 2:**
You okay?


---

**Mash:**
Holmes?

**Holmes:**
Then again, I wouldn't want to be so coy
that you end up distrusting me, either!

**Holmes:**
Rest assured, at this point, I have no intentions of covering up anything that is clearly a matter of public record. Yes, Jekyll and I were indeed acquaintances in our lifetimes.

**Mash:**
Th-then, does that mean...

**Mash:**
...you and Mr. Hyde once went toe-to-toe like something straight out of a fan-fiction dream match!?

**Holmes:**
I do love that you're clearly such an avid reader, Ms. Kyrielight! And indeed, it's little wonder that question would be foremost in your mind.

**Holmes:**
But, I am sorry to say, the circumstances of how we came to meet were not nearly so exciting as that. If anything...

**Holmes:**
...

**Holmes:**
...they were one of my most embarrassing failures.

**Holmes:**
I only wish I had never tried to avoid facing Mr. Hyde...

**Jekyll:**
It's not your fault, Mr. Holmes. It's mine.

**Jekyll:**
I'm the one who agreed to organize those case records, and read some of the ones I was clearly told not to.

**Jekyll:**
Not to mention I was the one who ended up entangled in the spiderweb connected to those records...

**Jekyll:**
...laid by the diabolical Moriarty

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Moriarty?


---

**Fujimaru 2:**
What???


---

**Holmes:**
...

**Jekyll:**
I was always fascinated by evil.

**Jekyll:**
So I think when I tracked down Moriarty, the wicked spider himself, my own evil side couldn't resist facing off with him.

**Mash:**
H-hang on, Jekyll.

**Mash:**
In R. L. Stevenson's novella, Dr. Jekyll drinks an experimental serum that causes him to gain a new, evil personality, the titular Mr. Hyde.

**Mash:**
As Mr. Hyde, his very body transforms to reflect his wicked nature, and he undertakes a series of awful deeds.

**Mash:**
Dr. Jekyll is so aghast by this turn of events that he ends up killing Mr. Hyde by taking his own life.

**Mash:**
And from what I've heard, the novella is a fairly accurate depiction of the events of your life.

**Mash:**
But, based on what you just said...

**Mash:**
It sounds as though the Professor&ndash;
or rather, James Moriarty...

**Mash:**
...was somehow involved in you becoming Mr. Hyde?

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...Jekyll?


---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Could you tell us more about what happened?


---

**Jekyll:**
I-it's not a pleasant story.
In fact, it's really quite depressing...

**Jekyll:**
And since Moriarty wasn't directly involved,
there's really no need to go into it...

**Holmes:**
He may not have been directly involved, no...

**Holmes:**
But what about indirectly?

**Holmes:**
In time, the ingredients required for your serum became much harder to come by, no? That was his doing.

**Holmes:**
While I didn't learn this until after the case was closed, there was a time when the Clock Tower's alchemical catalysts were&ndash;

**Jekyll:**
A-ahem!
N-never mind that now!

**Jekyll:**
Since we're all here now, Mr. Holmes, this seems as good a time as any to ask you something I've been curious about!

**Holmes:**
O-oh? And what might that be?

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Come on, Jekyll, don't change the subject now!


---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Hey, I wanted to hear more about what Moriarty did!


---

**Jekyll:**
(Master!)

**Jekyll:**
(I'm rapidly losing confidence in my ability to suppress my, um, urges...)

**Jekyll:**
(And I'm worried Hyde may put in an appearance if we keep this discussion going for too long!)

**Jekyll:**
(So please, help me change the subject!
I'm begging you!)

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
(...Well, in that case...)


---

**Jekyll:**
(Thank you, Master!)

**Mash:**
Senpai? Jekyll?

**Jekyll:**
Yes, um, you mentioned the Clock Tower, Mr. Holmes!?

**Jekyll:**
You know, I engaged in many different fields of study back in my day. I earned doctorates in law and medicine, a spot in the Royal Society of Scientists, and eventually even uncovered some of alchemy's greatest secrets...

**Jekyll:**
But in spite of all that, I never managed to set foot inside the Clock Tower. Apparently, not even my magecraft-adjacent work with alchemy was enough to gain entrance.

**Jekyll:**
In the end, I went to my grave knowing nothing about mages, the Mage's Association, the Clock Tower, or anything else pertaining to that world.

**Jekyll:**
...But the same isn't true for you, is it?

**Jekyll:**
The fact that you mentioned the Clock Tower at all
tells me you must have known that magecraft&ndash;

**Jekyll:**
&ndash;That is, incredible Mystics exist in this world, even as they're unbeknownst to almost all.

**Holmes:**
...

**Holmes:**
...Well, yes, I suppose I did.

**Jekyll:**
!

**Mash:**
Then, you knew the Clock Tower circa 1900!?

**Holmes:**
I knew of it, yes,
but my knowledge was strictly secondhand.

**Holmes:**
At the time, I'd decided to keep my distance from Mystics and other things of that sort.

**Holmes:**
I believed that my domain, and the cases I investigated, were solely within the human world.

**Holmes:**
However...there were times when I unwittingly
encroached on the world beyond.

**Holmes:**
For example, in The Adventure of the Speckled Band&ndash;

**Mash:**
The Adventure of the Speckled Band!?

**Mash:**
Oh, um, do you know that one, Senpai?
If you don't, I'd hate to ruin it...

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I do, so don't worry about it.

**Mash:**
Understood!

**Mash:**
The Adventure of the Speckled Band was one of the
most popular Sherlock Holmes stories of its day.

**Mash:**
It begins when a woman from Surrey asks Holmes to
investigate the circumstances of her twin sister's death.

**Mash:**
Her sister died in a locked room, with seemingly no way for the killer to get in or out, and the last words she spoke were “The speckled band!” In the end, it's revealed that&ndash;

**Jekyll:**
The “speckled band” was actually a venomous snake.

**Mash:**
Right. The speckled band was a snake the killer had been controlling by whistling.

**Mash:**
It had an incredible plot twist at the end, and I have no doubt that Holmes fans at the time enjoyed it a lot.

**Mash:**
But, it has one big plot hole: the fact that&ndash;

**Holmes:**
Snakes, lacking ears, cannot distinguish between whistle tones. And that's hardly the story's only oddity.

**Holmes:**
There's also the fact that the killer enticed the snake with milk, the fact that the snake's venom should not kill its victims so quickly...

**Holmes:**
Truly, there is no end of contradictions.

**Mash:**
Right!

**Holmes:**
So if the story as written couldn't be true,
what actually happened? I'll tell you.


---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I don't, so yes, please keep the spoilers to a minimum!

**Mash:**
R-right! In that case, I'll do my
best to skip over the details.

**Mash:**
Basically, it's a locked-room murder mystery where the victim is killed under seemingly impossible circumstances.

**Mash:**
Holmes managed to solve it brilliantly, of course, but&ndash;

**Jekyll:**
Scientifically speaking, the “truth” still left a number of unanswered questions.

**Mash:**
Exactly.

**Mash:**
Of course, there's nothing wrong with that for a story, but if this case really happened as depicted&ndash;

**Holmes:**
It would mean there are still
greater truths yet to be told.

**Mash:**
Right!

**Holmes:**
So if the story as written couldn't be true,
what actually happened? I'll tell you.

**Holmes:**
I suppose this may inevitably get into spoiler territory, as they say, but rest assured that it will still be a far cry from the events of the novel!


---

**Holmes:**
...There is great evil at work in this case.

**Holmes:**
A man of incredible intelligence is using his unique
talents to commit crimes. I can think of no worse scenario.

**Holmes:**
At any rate, it won't be long now, Watson.

**Holmes:**
Very soon, the instrument of our villain's wicked ambitions will come to this room very in search of more prey.

**Holmes:**
I trust you have your pistol at the ready?

**Watson:**
Wh-what do you mean!? What instrument!?

**Watson:**
And hang on: you have ME playing Dr. Watson!?

**Watson:**
G-granted, you certainly help me out a lot, Administrative Advisor, so I'm not entirely unwilling to join you in retelling one of your old escapades...

**Watson:**
And I can't say I'm not honored that you chose me for the distinguished role of your most trusted colleague&ndash;one famously played by Edward Hardwicke, no less! Very well then, so be it!

**Watson:**
...What are we about to see, Sherlock!?

**Holmes:**
Some sort of curse. There is no more fitting term.

**Holmes:**
It comes from the Clock Tower's domain&ndash;the world of magecraft. It may sound fanciful, but I assure you that its wicked power is very real!

**Holmes:**
I expect the responsible party is most likely a Clock Tower dropout or, on the other end of the spectrum, a Seal Designated mage.

**Holmes:**
...Here it comes!

**Watson:**
Aaaaaaaaah! It's heeeeeeeeere!

**Holmes:**
I must say, whoever let something like this slip out of the Clock Tower ought to be ashamed. Not that any admonishment will do us much good at the moment.

**Holmes:**
Come, Watson, let's take care of it!

＄91-90-05-01-1-1

**Watson:**
I-it's over! It's finally over!
(Huff, gasp...)

**Watson:**
Wh-what in the world was that?

**Holmes:**
The sign that this case is now closed.

**Holmes:**
An evil Dark Arts practitioner was using curses with physical forms to murder his victims...

**Holmes:**
...but now that his curse has been routed,
it's going to come crashing down on his head.

**Holmes:**
I expect he's dying from the recoil over in the next room as we speak. As they say, violence invites violence.

**Watson:**
Really?

**Watson:**
Then, you mean when I was shooting that monster just now, I was actually shooting the dastardly villain behind this latest murder?

**Watson:**
I s-say, couldn't you have said something sooner?
I ended up firing every last bullet I had into it...

**Watson:**
...No, that doesn't sound like something Watson would
say. Let's see... Damn, this is harder than it looks.

**Watson:**
On a different note, I don't know how I'm ever
going to turn this incident into a book...

**Watson:**
Not to mention that if I write about what actually
happened, I'm liable to draw the Clock Tower's attention...

**Holmes:**
Hahaha.

**Holmes:**
Oh, it's quite all right, Watson.
I'm sure you'll come up with something!

＄91-90-05-01-2-0

**Holmes:**
And there you have it. In the published record of these events&ndash;Sir Conan Doyle's novel, to be precise...

**Holmes:**
...a different “truth” was substituted for the
actual facts of the case, as one would expect.

**Holmes:**
Nor was that the only case where the Clock Tower's
involvement, or magecraft, was skirted around.

**Mash:**
You mean there were others!?

**Mash:**
Wh-what about The Hound of the Baskervilles!? I've always thought there were some things that didn't add up!

**Mash:**
Did it actually have something to do with the black dogs that appear in British folklore!?

**Holmes:**
Indeed, it did. Most perceptive, Ms. Kyrielight.

**Holmes:**
But, I'm afraid I can't give you full
marks for that insight alone.

**Mash:**
!

**Holmes:**
It wasn't only the black dog, you see. As a matter of fact, the King of the Storm was also involved with&ndash;

**Holmes:**
...On second thought, I'd best not say any more.

**Holmes:**
I expect it will be far more entertaining once I've had a word with Mr. Edison about filming it for the big screen!

**Mash:**
#### !!!

**Mash:**
Oh gosh, oh gosh, oh gosh.
D-does that mean...

**Mash:**
...there might be a brand-new Sherlock Holmes
movie made here at Novum Chaldea!?

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Easy, Mash! Just take it easy!


---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Your eyes are literally glittering with excitement, Mash...


---

**Mash:**
Did you hear that, Senpai!? Speaking as a huge fan of both the original books and the movie adaptations, this may be the biggest news since&ndash;

**D：???:**
Goodness, it's so lively in here!
Hehe, what's everyone talking about?

**Helena:**
Whatever it is, it certainly can't be an evil scheme
if it's got Mash so excited. Hehe, so what's up?

**Mash:**
Helena!

**Jekyll:**
Good day, Madame Blavatsky.

**Holmes:**
Hahahaha, don't be ridiculous, my dear Yelena. You know I would never engage in any manner of scheming.

**Helena:**
Hmm, I don't know, Sigerson.
You've definitely got a mischievous side to you.

**Holmes:**
Hahahahaha.

**Mash:**
Sigerson! That's one of Holmes's aliases
he used in the original stories!

**Helena:**
I see. So you're all reminiscing, huh?
In that case...

**Helena:**
Did you hear the one about the Himalayas yet?

**Holmes:**
...

**Helena:**
What about the... What did people call it again,
Siger&ndash;Mr. Holmes? The Great Hiatus?

**Mash:**
We haven't heard the one about the Himalayas yet,
no... But I do know about the Great Hiatus!

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
The Great Hiatus, huh...

**Mash:**
I'm glad to see you know about it too, Senpai!


---

**Fujimaru 2:**
You know about it, Mash?

**Mash:**
Of course!


---

**Mash:**
There's a roughly three-year period of time between May 4, 1891, the day Holmes goes over the Reichenbach Falls with Professor Moriarty...

**Mash:**
...and April 5, 1894, the day he reveals to Watson that he's still alive!

**Mash:**
The Sherlock Holmes fandom refers to
this period as the Great Hiatus!

**Mash:**
The explanation Holmes gives for his absence
during this period in the books...

**Mash:**
...is that he spent this time overseas
in places like Tibet and Persia.

**Mash:**
So then, when Holmes was off in Tibet&ndash;

**Helena:**
Yup! After he and I both faked our deaths in
1891&ndash;him at Reichenbach, me in London&ndash;

**Helena:**
We went around exploring the Himalayas together!

**Helena:**
Ugh, I can't believe this.

**Helena:**
Why would the Clock Tower youngsters be coming
after me now? Did I do something to upset them?

**Helena:**
They've left me alone for years, saying they don't care what I do since there's no such thing as Mahatma anyway...

**Helena:**
And now, out of the blue, they start sending assassins after me?

**A：Sigerson:**
I expect they became more wary of you by virtue
of the fact that you faked your death.

**Helena:**
Wary?

**A：Sigerson:**
Given the “genius” Madame Blavatsky's success at bringing modern occultism into mainstream Western society...

**A：Sigerson:**
...they must have thought you were about to make a move on the magecraft world now that your public persona is gone.

**A：Sigerson:**
Or something to that effect.

**Helena:**
You think they were paying that much attention to me?

**A：Sigerson:**
Hmm. I suppose I shouldn't be surprised that
you lack awareness of your own importance.

**A：Sigerson:**
But whether you are aware of it or not, Madame Blavatsky, the fact remains that modern-day Europe is in the midst of an unprecedented occult boom.

**A：Sigerson:**
While it may not have reached the world of true magecraft, the group of people who believe in ghosts and supernatural phenomena is far greater than you think.

**A：Sigerson:**
Even the criticisms leveled by the Society for Psychical Research have done nothing to turn the tide. At this point, it is a genuine social phenomenon.

**A：Sigerson:**
Which is why the Clock Tower, and the Mage's Association, cannot afford to completely ignore it.

**A：Sigerson:**
Remember, they were supposedly forced to add a new department at the turn of the last century thanks to Count Cagliostro's influence.

**A：Sigerson:**
And if that is true, you can be certain they
are keeping a close eye on you as well!

**Helena:**
I see...

**Helena:**
If only they knew I just wanted to let Annie deal
with that stuff so I could be free.

**A：Sigerson:**
Ah yes, Annie Besant, Madame Blavatsky's successor to present-day theosophy.

**Helena:**
That's her.

**Helena:**
I just wanted to stop being Grandma Helena,
the old occultist lady who founded theosophy.

**Helena:**
I didn't want to deal with the British SPR and their incessant complaining, the Theosophical Society... Even my beloved Mahatma!

**Helena:**
I just wanted to be free of everything...

**Helena:**
...and live an ordinary life as a kind,
gentle girl&ndash;one full of hope and possibility.

**Helena:**
But I guess I never will, thanks to the Clock Tower.

**A：Sigerson:**
It may not be the entire Clock Tower behind this. It could simply be Policies, or perhaps one of the other departments going off on their&ndash;

**Helena:**
Who cares? It doesn't change my situation.
(Sigh)

**Helena:**
I was really looking forward to coming to the Himalayas. You were too, right?

**Helena:**
I was excited about seeing secret, winged Demonic Beasts in a land where no one else has ever set foot!

**Helena:**
But instead of some Phantasmals...

**Helena:**
...all we got were assassins and the Chimeras they
brought with them. Ugh. I'm sorry you have to deal with this.

**A：Sigerson:**
Reinforcements, hmm.
Stand back, Madam. I'll take care of them.

**Helena:**
Thanks, Mr. Sigerson! I'll back you up!

**A：Sigerson:**
Much obliged. Now, allow me to show
you once again what baritsu can do.

＄91-90-05-01-3-0

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You threw a Chimera!?


---

**Fujimaru 2:**
And you did all this when you were still alive!?


---

**Helena:**
Yup! Just picked it up, and WHOOSH!
I have to say, it flew surprisingly well!

**Mash:**
So your baritsu was just as strong when you were
alive as it is now... I should have known!

**Holmes:**
Remember, these were not the Phantasmals of Greek myth, but mere imitations devised by late nineteenth-century mages.

**Holmes:**
If slamming them against a wall was enough to shatter all their bones, it is safe to say they never truly posed a threat.

**Holmes:**
In my estimation, they were no more
dangerous than, say, a wild lion.

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Oh yeah, because those aren't dangerous at all.


---

**Fujimaru 2:**
And we all know how safe wild lions are.


---

**Holmes:**
Haha, a fair point. I certainly don't mean
to imply they posed no danger at all.

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Something on your mind, Jekyll?


---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Huh? Did you just smile, Jekyll?


---

**Jekyll:**
Oh, uh, I was just...
How can I put this?

**Jekyll:**
...I guess I was just a little...relieved to hear all that.

**Jekyll:**
See, part of me thought that, now that Holmes had materialized here as a Heroic Spirit...

**Jekyll:**
...all the mystery surrounding him had been cleared up, leaving him with no more secrets.

**Jekyll:**
But clearly, I was wrong!

**Jekyll:**
It turns out that even when he was alive, he was breaking curses and throwing around man-made Demonic Beasts!

**Jekyll:**
So yes, I'm happy to find that you're still just as much a mysterious gentleman as ever, Sherlock Holmes.

**Holmes:**
...Is that your way of paying me a compliment, Jekyll?

**Jekyll:**
Of course.

**Helena:**
A mysterious gentleman, huh?

**Helena:**
Mystery, mystery... Speaking of mysteries, there's still one big one about you, isn't there, Sigerson?

**Holmes:**
Hm?

**Helena:**
We never did find out if you were originally a Rogue
Servant, or if somebody summoned you here. Which is it?

**F：Screen-Edge Phantom Gentleman:**
!!!

**Helena:**
For that matter, how did you show up in the Sixth Singularity all on your&ndash;

**Helena:**
Mmph.

**Moriarty:**
Hahahahaha! Now, now, Ms. Blavatsky, I think that's quite enough for now, don't you?

**Moriarty:**
(That was close! She nearly ruined all the groundwork I've been laying!)

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Professor!


---

**Fujimaru 2:**
What do you think you're doing!?


---

**Mash:**
P-Professor?

**Jekyll:**
!

**Jekyll:**
The spider!

**Moriarty:**
Oh, yes, I do beg your pardon.
It's nothing, really. Nothing at all.

**Moriarty:**
I know how it looks, but I simply noticed some magical energy pooling right around here and thought I'd&ndash;

**Holmes:**
Unhand the lady at once, Professor.

**Moriarty:**
Ah, yes, of course.
My apologies, dear Madam.

**Helena:**
Don't worry about it.
Anyway, did you handle this pool or whatever it was?

**Moriarty:**
I did indeed.
Worry no more.

**Holmes:**
...James Moriarty.

**Holmes:**
The man by which all other evil is measured.
The once king of villainy, and Napoleon of crime.

**Holmes:**
The wicked spider who trampled all over society without so much as a pang of conscience.

**Holmes:**
Surely I need not remind you of the many lives you ruined, or of the countless people you yourself hurt or killed.

**Holmes:**
Now here you are, claiming to be secretly good on the inside even as you remain steadfastly evil and unapologetic for your past crimes...

**Holmes:**
...and the first thing you do upon setting foot in
this room is sneak up behind Madame Blavatsky's back?
I'd say this calls for a heaping helping of baritsu,
doesn't it?

**Moriarty:**
My, my, I could hear those knuckles cracking all the way over here! I suppose this just goes to show why one shouldn't indulge one's evil side too often!

**Moriarty:**
Indeed, I have piled my misdeeds mountainously high!
Am I up to something even now? But of course!

**Moriarty:**
Still, all that being said...let's not get ahead
of ourselves too quickly now, O Great Detective.

**Moriarty:**
I'm hardly some cackling vampire going about making off with beautiful maidens, after all.

**Moriarty:**
Or did you genuinely think a few snide remarks
would be enough to get my goat at this point?

**Moriarty:**
Well, Great Detective?

**Moriarty:**
Hmm. Great Detective.
What a positively stirring turn of phrase!

**Moriarty:**
However...

**Moriarty:**
I take extreme issue with you calling yourself that, Holmes. Frankly, you've got a lot of nerve, acting like you're some sort of hero of justice!

**Moriarty:**
Or is my recollection of you naming yourself the ultimate arbiter of truth mistaken?

**Moriarty:**
That you mediate facts in the name
of preserving human history?

**Holmes:**
There is no need for humanity to know the full truth.
Indeed, they must never know.

**Holmes:**
That is precisely why I was given this Ruler Spirit
Origin&ndash;to be both a mediator, and an arbiter.

**Holmes:**
It is because I'm meant to mediate facts and arbitrate all things to ensure that human history will always exist.

**Holmes:**
Hahaha.

**Moriarty:**
Hehehe.

**Holmes:**
Hahahahahahaha!

**Moriarty:**
Hehahahahahaha!

**Holmes:**
You created a noise block in the mainframe, caused a Valkyrie to go berserk, created a mechanical Elisabeth...

**Holmes:**
Indeed, it would take me days to recount your various misdeeds committed solely since coming to Chaldea.

**Holmes:**
You're the king spider, still scheming and plotting as much as ever, yet you act as though you are some benevolent protector of Master.

**Holmes:**
Where does the truth about you lie, Moriarty?

**Moriarty:**
You wish to know where you can find it, old boy?

**Helena:**
All right, that's enough!

**Helena:**
If you two insist on fighting, you can do it
without getting Fujimaru and me mixed up in it!

**Helena:**
Besides, just look at poor Jekyll.

**Jekyll:**
M-me...?
D-d-d-don't worry, I'm f-f-fine... Hahaha...

**Jekyll:**
I'm fine...

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Yeah, no, you're definitely NOT fine!


---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Then what was Hyde doing there just now!?


---

**Mash:**
Y-you're right, Senpai!
I thought I just saw Hyde there for a split second!

**Helena:**
Okay, break it up! No more arguing!

**Helena:**
If you just can't help yourselves, then let's take
it outside the Command Room and into the simulator!

**Helena:**
Would you do the honors, Mash?

**Mash:**
Huh?

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Go for it, Mash!


---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Good idea! Let's let them get it out of their systems in the simulator.


---

**Mash:**
R-right!

**Mash:**
Arranging simulator settings now!
Um, let's see, how should I split up the teams...?

**Moriarty:**
Why, Team Detective vs. Evil Army, of course!
Wouldn't you agree, Mr. Hyde!?

**Hyde:**
The hell you just say to me, gramps!?
All right, fine by me! I'mma kill you ALL dead!

**Mash:**
Now Jekyll&ndash;I mean, Hyde is here!
And he looks like he's very, um, motivated to fight!

**Holmes:**
Good grief. It would seem Moriarty has left us
with little choice but to clean up this mess!

**Mash:**
It looks like Holmes is raring to go too, Senpai!

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Then let's get this combat simulation started!

＄91-90-05-01-3-1

**Moriarty:**
Nooo! You got meee!

**Moriarty:**
...Oh, drat.
Now my favorite coat's all smudged.

**Moriarty:**
Very well then, I think I'll be on my merry way.
Today's baritsu really did a number on my poor back!

**Moriarty:**
Oh, yes. That'll do, Hyde!

**Hyde:**
Huh!? The hell you talking about!?
I can keep this up all&ndash;

**Moriarty:**
I said, that'll do.

**Jekyll:**
...!?

**Jekyll:**
D-did I...turn into Hyde again?

**Moriarty:**
Now, as they say nowadays... Sayonara, suckers!
Hahahahaha!

**Holmes:**
Good grief.
Seems he threw subtlety out the window today...

**Holmes:**
...

**Holmes:**
All that aside, this vision of London permeated by Demonic Fog certainly does bring back memories.

**Mash:**
The Fourth Singularity is where you accepted
that request from Babbage, right, Holmes?

**Holmes:**
Yes, it is.

**Holmes:**
Unfortunately, I still have yet to fully complete it, much to my chagrin.

**Mash:**
...

**Holmes:**
Though the first murder of humanity was prevented when Goetia and his mass incineration plot were defeated...

**Holmes:**
...it was not long afterwards that a second plot to murder all of humanity began, in the form of the bleaching of Earth.

**Holmes:**
This is easily the largest murder case in all of history. As such, I must do everything I can to solve it, starting with finding out why the Foreign God did it...

**Holmes:**
Yes, the Foreign God&ndash;a mystery of truly unprecedented scale, and a being we still know nothing about despite having conquered numerous Lostbelts.

**Holmes:**
I have no doubt I was given this Ruler Spirit Origin in order to unravel this mystery, and yet...

**Holmes:**
...

**Holmes:**
At any rate, as a detective,
I am obligated to determine what true evil is.

**Holmes:**
And given that I no longer have a human life to take care of, I am more detective now than I ever was in life.

**Holmes:**
Indeed, it may be no exaggeration to say that
I am the very essence of a detective.

**Holmes:**
...Come to think of it...

**Holmes:**
I've never told you why I became a detective,
or what drives me to pursue cases.

**Holmes:**
I have no doubt that Ms. Kyrielight is already
intimately familiar with my backstory.

**Holmes:**
She has clearly read Sir Conan Doyle's novels thoroughly, as well as seen a number of their film adaptations.

**Holmes:**
But what about you, Fujimaru?

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Of course I know it.

**Holmes:**
Well thank you. I'm pleased to hear that. In that case, I hope you'll indulge me in a quick refresher.


---

**Fujimaru 2:**
...I'd like to hear it from you.

**Holmes:**
As you wish.


---

**Holmes:**
Why did I become a detective?
There is one word that sums up my reasons nicely:

**Holmes:**
Justice.

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...Justice.


---

**Holmes:**
Yes, justice.

**Holmes:**
Believe it or not, I fight for justice&ndash;
that is, what is good and right. Surprised?

**Holmes:**
While some famous detectives from modern stories seem concerned solely with solving mysteries for their own sake...

**Holmes:**
...I am not one of them.

**Holmes:**
Well, I do have a fair bit of aptitude for making deductions as well, as you can most likely tell from the nature of my Noble Phantasm...

**Holmes:**
But even so, I remain the one and only Sherlock Holmes.

**Holmes:**
And it is precisely because humanity is currently facing a true existential crisis that I must never completely forget where good and evil lie.

**Holmes:**
Murder is murder.
It cannot be overlooked, no matter what its scope.

**Holmes:**
So I will not turn a blind eye to one taking place before
my eyes, whether there is but one victim, or seven billion of them.

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
So we're really dealing with the murder of all of Proper Human History...

**Holmes:**
Indeed. We must not let it succeed, no matter the cost.


---

**Fujimaru 2:**
...What about the Lostbelts? What do you think of them?

**Holmes:**
What do I think of them? I think they're serial killings involving entire worlds.

**Holmes:**
And what's worse, the culprit has ensured that their blood is on our hands.

**Holmes:**
We are no longer merely fighting for our very existence.

**Holmes:**
In order for our world to survive, we have been forced to commit unspeakable atrocities. All the more reason that the one responsible must be held accountable.


---

**Holmes:**
...

**Holmes:**
...I refuse to let this stand.

**Holmes:**
I WILL see that the evil trampling over innocent people, sneering at the very idea of good and righteousness...

**Holmes:**
...and attempting to further their desires regardless of whom they hurt...is brought to justice.

**Holmes:**
For whose sake, you ask?
Nobody in particular.

**Holmes:**
No, I pursue these cases purely in the name of justice.

**Holmes:**
At heart, that is who I am&ndash;
Sherlock Holmes, protagonist of great adventures.

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You mean, the protagonist of the Arthur Conan Doyle novels?


---

**Holmes:**
Hahaha.

**Holmes:**
True, I suppose I may have no right to call myself a protagonist any longer, now that I've shown you a wealth of evidence proving I once genuinely existed.

**Holmes:**
But, be that as it may,
I am still the one and only Sherlock Holmes.

**Holmes:**
I am a detective, the revealer of truth, and the world's first consulting private investigator.

**Holmes:**
I am also one of the first “great detectives” that became the archetype for many detective stories to follow...

**Holmes:**
...which brings its own set of responsibilities.

**Holmes:**
And...I have my pride as well.

**Helena:**
...You never did answer my question.

**Helena:**
You really put on a show of it, too, with all that talk about solving cases in the name of justice!

**Helena:**
But you're still hiding some pretty big secrets,
aren't you, Sigerson?

**Holmes:**
Good grief. I suppose it was a fool's errand to hope you would forget about that, Madame Blavatsky.

**Holmes:**
Nonetheless, I meant every word I said. I only attempt to solve cases in furtherance of justice in the world.

**Holmes:**
However, you are still correct.
I do indeed have secrets.

**Holmes:**
Furthermore, there is still a great mystery regarding me personally that I have yet to solve.

**Holmes:**
Who summoned me in the first&ndash;

**Holmes:**
...

**Holmes:**
............

**Helena:**
Sigerson?

**Holmes:**
...I know.

**Holmes:**
This is the most pressing question I face in this
materialization. I'll need to find an answer eventually.

**Helena:**
Even if it means turning evil?

**Helena:**
Are you saying you're willing to resort to evil means in pursuit of supposedly just ends?

**Holmes:**
...

**Helena:**
Let me just make sure of one thing.
Would Fujimaru consider this to be evil, too?

**Holmes:**
...No, [♂ he /♀️ she] would not.

**Holmes:**
If nothing else, Yelena, I can assure you of that.

**Holmes:**
I am resolutely on humanity's side,
and that very much includes Fujimaru.

**Holmes:**
Think of it this way: I am a detective&ndash;one who has always fought for what is right, and will continue to do so.

**Helena:**
Are you sure?

**Holmes:**
I am, Madam. But if that is not sufficient
for you...I will make you a promise as well.

**Holmes:**
Everything I have told you is the truth.
I swear it.

**Helena:**
Hehe. And what exactly are you going to swear on? God?

**Holmes:**
Yes, well...

**Holmes:**
I swear it on the sight I saw back in
that hidden cave in the Himalayas...

**Narration:**
On the proud, final moments of your fulfilled life.

**Holmes:**

...Oho.

**Holmes:**

(So even throwing him to the ground wasn't
enough to release his grip on the knife.)

**Holmes:**

(The last of the Clock Tower's assassins is proving quite formidable.)

**Holmes:**

(But stabbing Yelena in the moment I stepped away from her is as far as you go!)

**Holmes:**

(I'm going to rob you of every
last possibility you hold...)

**Holmes:**

(...so that you can never ever harm her again.)

**N：Helena:**
No...don't...

**Narration:**

Coughing up blood with every word,
her purple eyes pleaded with me not to kill him.

**Narration:**

I nod, and strike a vital point to knock the assassin unconscious, robbing him only of his current possibilities.

**A：Sigerson:**
Yelena...

**Narration:**

Why did this happen? How did it happen?

**Narration:**

A woman of your abilities should have been able to make short work of a lone assassin the moment he stepped into the cave...

**Narration:**

No. No, I won't dwell on what could have been.
This was her choice, and she made it.

**Narration:**

Earlier, she told me this...

**Narration:**

“Please don't kill them, Mr. Sigerson.
I want to send them all back home alive, if we can.”

**Narration:**

“You know, I'm much older than I look.
Old enough to be a grandmother.”

**Narration:**

“So, though I don't have any of my own, I don't think it's right for me to take the lives of people young enough to be my own children and grandchildren.”

**Narration:**

“After all, I'm already dead.”

**Narration:**

But Madam, you didn't truly die.
That was a hoax, remember?

**Narration:**

To which she replied,

**Narration:**

“I know. But the moment I cut myself off from
the world, I may as well have died for real.”

**F：Helena:**
Thank...you...

**F：Helena:**
Mr. Sigerson...
No... Sherlock...

**F：Helena:**
It's...an amazing...coincidence...that we ran into...
each other here... Then again...maybe it was...inevitable?

**Narration:**

I couldn't make sense of what she was saying...
but I knew this feeling.

**Narration:**

As I held her in my arms, I could feel everything radiating out from her body.

**Narration:**

Her life force was leaving her. After all she'd accomplished, she was going to die here.

**A：Sigerson:**
Yelena.

**Narration:**

I took her trembling hand in my own, holding it tight.

**Narration:**

...And there, I saw it.

**Narration:**

Perhaps it was the manifestation of some Mystic
that secretly dwells deep in the Himalayas.

**Narration:**

Or perhaps it was a fleet of silver ships able to cross the sea of stars, envoys of a great transcendent teacher that descended to Earth to be with their favorite disciple in her final moments.

**F：Helena:**
Are you...seeing this...Sherlock?

**A：Sigerson:**
I am.

**Helena:**
That light...it's so...bright...

**Narration:**

Or, perhaps...

**Narration:**

...it was the glitter of the last faint tears running
down her cheeks...

**Helena:**
...Sigerson?

**Holmes:**
Oh, yes?

**Holmes:**
What is it, Yelena?

**Helena:**
You tell me. Why'd you go all quiet?

**Helena:**
Also, I'm still waiting for a proper answer.
What are you going to swear on?

**Helena:**
And don't mumble this time.
I can't understand you when you mumble.

**Holmes:**
I swear on...

**Holmes:**
On second thought, that's not the sort of
thing one should ever repeat. Hahahahaha.

**Helena:**
Huh?

**Holmes:**
Hahahahahahaha.

**Helena:**
???

**Fou:**
Fou, fooou!!!

**Holmes:**
Hahahaha, stop that.
Hahahaha, that smarts.

**Helena:**
Oh, it's nice to see Fou warming
up to you for a change. Hehehe.

**Fou:**
Fooou.

**Holmes:**
Hahahahahaha...
