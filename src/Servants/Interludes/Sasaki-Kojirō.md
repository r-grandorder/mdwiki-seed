# Sasaki Kojirou

## LEGEND-OF-THE-SAMURAI

**Chairperson:**
Thank you for your patience!
The next challenger hails from the Far East.

 
**Chairperson:**
A mysterious fighter called "SAMURAI!!"
It's "SASAKI KOJIROU" and friends!

 
**Mash:**
Why did this happen...?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Her Majesty sure got us this time.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
She asked us to come play at the Colosseum, and this is what happens when we believe her words!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
She told us to risk our lives as gladiators to entertain her.
As expected of a historically renown tyrant!!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
And so, as they were forced into this battle.
A comment from SAMURAI of the Far East, please.

 
**Kojirou:**
Hmm, the Colosseum.
A rather special arena, isn't it?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
And you fit in a little bit too well, Kojirou!
Are you here on tour!?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You're calm.
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Aren't you scared?
 


---
 
**Kojirou:**
Well, those walking the path of swordsmanship are prepared for this.
Everything you do is part of your training - as my predecessors would say.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
That refreshing smile.
You're amazing, SAMURAI.

 
**Kojirou:**
Hmm? No, you're wrong, Lord Roman. I'm neither a warrior nor a samurai. Just some dude that can wave a stick.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Whaaaaaat!?

 
**Kojirou:**
Besides a sword, I've carried hoes before, too.
So I am quite handy with peasant works, too.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Whoa...That's impressive, but how did you become a Heroic Spirit, again...?

 
**Chairperson:**
The first match
"SAMURAIS" vs. "Immortal Soldiers!!"

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Wait wait wait, this is messed up!!
Immortal!? Are they zombies!? Skeletons!?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I'll leave it to you this time, Doctor.
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Groovy, Roman.
 


---
 
**Mash:**
Yes. It is twice the communications traffic than usual.
The Doctor's interested in Kojirou...or rather, SAMURAI.

 
**Kojirou:**
Hmm...so let's have a fair...fight!!


**--BATTLE--:**

**Kojirou:**
Umm. Given your opponent's build, you'll need to be creative. Focus on inserting your blade and pulling your arm back, I guess.

 
**Chairperson:**
What an overwhelming force! Who on earth is he?
"SAMURAI," warrior from the Orient!

 
**Chairperson:**
But that's the extent of his power!!
Next up is a gladiator-killing demon!

 
**Chairperson:**
Our champion!!
"Demon Sword, the Emissary from Hell!!"

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Any way you slice it, that's a demon! That's insane!
Isn't that insane!? What has happened to the reign of Rome!?

 
**Mash:**
Calm down, Doctor.
That's a gladiator's costume.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Oh, I seeee. It's just a performance to hype up the battle...and you think I'd fall for that!?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
I mean it's got wings and a tail!!
That transcends the level of a costume!!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Why did the Emperor hire this guy? Is she a moron? I had a feeling all along, but is the Roman Emperor a moron?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
No matter how great a samurai you are, Kojirou...
No, even if you were raised in the wild, that's not fair!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Your opponent transcends Bushido, you know!
Default, Kojirou! That would be the best!

 
**Kojirou:**
Hahaha.
Lord Roman, you worry too much.

 
**Kojirou:**
Don't worry about me!
I fought beasts on a daily basis in the mountains.

 
**Kojirou:**
Look. An ox head, bear body, and monkey legs.
A worthy opponent, but rather boring.

 
**Kojirou:**
Why don't you relax and enjoy this, Lord Roman?
OK, Master. Let's show off our abilities!


**--BATTLE--:**

**Kojirou:**
Hmm. He's invulnerable like Berserker.
Guess this wasn't just a beast?

 
**Chairperson:**
No matter how much you attack him, he won't fall!!
That's our champ, "Demon Sword!!"

 
**Dr. Roman:**
You're still going to insist that it's a human fighter!
I'm going to make a direct complaint to Emperor Nero!

 
**Demon Sword:**
Ugoaaaaaaaaa!!!

 
**Mash:**
Watch out, Master!!

 
**Kojirou:**
Hidden Sword&ndash;Swallow Reversal!!

 
**Demon Sword:**
Goaaaaaaaa...!!

 
**Chairperson:**
...!!
Wh-What has happened!?

 
**Chairperson:**
Demon Sword, undefeated for 100 battles, has finally fallen!!

 
**Kojirou:**
I guess its stock of resurrection ran out.
...How boring.

 
**Kojirou:**
I expected a tough opponent, but it's still quite far from an enlightenment of a new Hidden Sword.

 
**Kojirou:**
Well. I wonder when I'll meet the one who could surpass the swallow on that day.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
No, no, no. The swallow you fought was absolutely nuts, a phantasmal! Was it a phantasmal?

 
**Chairperson:**
A new champion has risen here!!
His name is "SAMURAI," the warrior of the Orient.

 
**Chairperson:**
We ask the audience to welcome this new champion with a loud round of applause!!

 
**Mash:**
This just turned into something amazing, Senpai.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You're amazing, SAMURAI!
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
That's right, SAMURAI.
 


---
 
**Kojirou:**
This is some pretty good cheering.
It lacks elegance but the thunderous applause is nice.

 
**Kojirou:**
Lord Fujimaru, I've caused you trouble.
Well, let's have a drink to celebrate the victory.

 
**Kojirou:**
Will there be a bag of rice, too? Man, a place where you can make money from martial arts! This is a nice town!

 
**Da Vinci:**
&ndash;After that, the fighter from the Orient piled on victory after victory as a great Gladiator in Roman history 
 
**Da Vinci:**
and became a legend among the people for a long time henceforth...

 
**Da Vinci:**
&ndash;Well, that bit of Roman gladiator history continues to be described about in detail but 
 
**Da Vinci:**
Have anything to say, Kojirou?

 
**Kojirou:**
No, I was just excited.
Forgive me.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
It was incredible! Swallow Reversal 100 slashes!
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Her Majesty was delighted, too.
 


---
 
**Mash:**
Kojirou was really popular.
The merchandise was flying off the shelves, too!

 
**Mash:**
Emperor Nero was having a fit though.
She said, "I shall be the 100th opponent!"

 
**Mash:**
But, I am surprised that the history can tolerate this amount of changes.

 
**Da Vinci:**
No, it can't tolerate at all.
Romani, what are we going to do about this?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Well...We went there to correct the history, and now we actually ended up changing it...What should we do, Fou?

 
**Fou:**
Fou!!

 
**Mash:**
Fou said, "Super Overtime."
Doctor, do you want to eat the food we got as prizes?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Don't need it, return it to Rome!
