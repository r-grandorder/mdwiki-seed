# Chevalier d'Eon

## In the Name of Lily

**d'Eon:**
Thank you&ndash;

 
**d'Eon:**
Sorry for making you tag along with me.
But, thank you.

 
**d'Eon:**
Something is going to happen here, in this era.
I can't shake that feeling.

 
**d'Eon:**
So that's why I insisted on this, and now here we are...in the Paris of a bygone age.

 
**d'Eon:**
Honestly, I hope we find nothing, but in that case...hmm.

 
**d'Eon:**
It'll mean I've wasted your time. I apologize,
you're probably tired from the constant fighting.

 
**Mash:**
Don't worry about it.
It seems like Senpai is feeling restless anyway.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Yeah, I just can't fall asleep.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I feel wide-awake.

---
 

 
**Mash:**
Maybe there's some kind of connection with what d'Eon's feeling.

 
**Fou:**
Fou?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
That's right, Masters and Servants are connected through magical energy, so it's possible.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
One recorded example is the phenomenon of shared memories within dreams.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
I imagine there are other examples as well.
It's quite intriguing.

 
**Mash:**
Yes. He, umm, I mean she&ndash;
wait, uh&ndash;

 
**d'Eon:**
Haha, either is fine.
Sometimes I am a man, and sometimes woman.

 
**d'Eon:**
You may refer to me however you wish.
Hey Fujimaru, what do I look like to you?

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
A woman, I guess?

 
**d'Eon:**
Hehe...
So that's how I look.

 
---

**Fujimaru 2:**
A man, I guess?

 
**d'Eon:**
Hmm...
So that's how I look.

 
---
 
**d'Eon:**
I'm the Knight of the White Lily, sworn to defend France's royal family. Gender means nothing to me.

 
**d'Eon:**
Sometimes I'm a saber-wielding dragoon.
Sometimes I'm an elegant lady in a dress.

 
**d'Eon:**
If it's to defend the royal family, I won't hesitate to use a saber or a dress.

 
**d'Eon:**
That remains as true now as it was when I was alive.
Being a Heroic Spirit doesn't change that.

 
**d'Eon:**
Also...

 
**Mash:**
???

 
**Fou:**
Fou?

 
**d'Eon:**
I committed a crime. I remember my manifestation in this world as Berserk Saber.

 
**d'Eon:**
Not just at all of you... I even pointed my blade at "the one" who's the very symbol of the royal family.

 
**d'Eon:**
I want to atone for that.
Forgive me Master Fujimaru.

 
**d'Eon:**
Instead of fulfilling my duties as a Servant, I am now acting to fulfill my duties as a defender of the royal family.

 
**d'Eon:**
Please forgive me, even if it's only for a night.

 
**d'Eon:**
Please give me a chance.
Master.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Don't worry about it.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Sure, I don't feel like sleeping anyway.

---
 

 
**d'Eon:**
...Thank you, Master.

 
**Fou:**
Fou!
Kyuuuuuu!!

 
**Mash:**
Magical energy detected, Senpai!
Multiple units in the town ahead!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
It seems that d'Eon's worry was justified!
If anything comes up, we can also Rayshift!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Multiple signatures approaching our position!
We might have to fight!

 
**Mash:**
...Senpai!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Get ready for battle!

---
 

 
**Mash:**
Yes, Master!

 
**d'Eon:**
Shadowy beings lurking in Paris's twilight hours&ndash;
I, the Knight of the White Lily, shall be your opponent!

 
**--BATTLE--:**

**Mash:**
Enemy unit destroyed. It's likely that the target's composition was magical in nature.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
A ghost-type monster. The fact it lacks a physical body is troublesome, so I'm glad you're the ones against it.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Even against monsters immune from physical attacks, a Servant can still fight with no problems.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Since Servants are composed of magical energies, all your attacks are still effective against non-physical targets.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
A fine opponent.
We're quite lucky then.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
"We're quite lucky?"

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I don't know if I'd put it that way...

---
 

 
**d'Eon:**
Another group is approaching!
Master, looks like another fight!

 
**Fou:**
Kyu!
Foou!

 
**Mash:**
Senpai, please take care of Fou!
Also,&ndash;your orders please!


**--BATTLE--:**

**Mash:**
...I thought the battle would continue, but it seems like there are no more enemies in this area.

 
**d'Eon:**
Hmm, I don't know about that.

 
**d'Eon:**
This feeling... Something's close.
It's cleverly hiding itself, but it's definitely there.

 
**d'Eon:**
Reveal yourself! Present yourself before the royal family's august lily!

 
**d'Eon:**
You who haunts Paris during the dead of night!
&ndash;Wretched ghost mired in wickedness!

 
**E:???:**
...Death...to the royal family...

 
**E:???:**
...Freedom...to the people...

 
**E:???:**
...We, the people, no longer need the white lily of the royal family...

 
**E:???:**
...Thus...

 
**E:???:**
...The revolution shall sweep Paris...

 
**Mash:**
!?

 
**Fou:**
Foou!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
I am picking up a powerful reading! This is different than a Servant, it's closer to the ghosts we encountered.

 
**d'Eon:**
...I know who this is.

 
**d'Eon:**
The strength of this man's convictions. He sought freedom for the people and castigated the royal family.

 
**d'Eon:**
In days and nights long past, I once crossed swords in the shadows with this man.

 
**d'Eon:**
You're... I see.
So it's you who summoned me.

 
**d'Eon:**
&ndash;Maximilien Robespierre.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
What!
Robespierre!?

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Uh, who?

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
He's famous in history!

---
 

 
**Mash:**
Yes. Maximilien Robespierre was the world's first terrorist and an instigator of the revolution&ndash;

 
**Dr. Roman:**
B-But, hold on a second.
Whatever that is, it doesn't look like a Servant!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
The first Holy Grail...
It has influenced Paris and conjured up a ghost!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Everything's a mess, and the era is out of control.
The Holy Grail makes such things possible&ndash;

 
**Ghost of Robespierre:**
...Death...to the royal family...

 
**Ghost of Robespierre:**
...Death...Death, death...

 
**Ghost of Robespierre:**
...Death to all...who oppose the revolution...

 
**Ghost of Robespierre:**
...Ah, yes, upon everyone and everything...

 
**Ghost of Robespierre:**
...Purge...and death!

 
**d'Eon:**
He has lost sight of his own justice.
Robespierre...

 
**d'Eon:**
I could judge your life as an evil one, but now all you wish is death upon everything.

 
**d'Eon:**
You shall fall before a knight of France.
&ndash;By the sword of the White Lily!

 
**Mash:**
Master, your orders, please!


**--BATTLE--:**

**d'Eon:**
&ndash;It's over, poor ghost!

 
**Ghost of Robespierre:**
...ah, aah, ah, aaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh...

 
**Ghost of Robespierre:**
...It's disappearing, everything...

 
**Ghost of Robespierre:**
...France, liberty...to where...

 
**Ghost of Robespierre:**
...do you fade away...

 
**d'Eon:**
No, Robespierre.
They will not fade away.

 
**d'Eon:**
France's royalty may vanish.
Perhaps revolutionaries like you will fall as well.

 
**d'Eon:**
But France itself will never die. It may change its shape or form, but it will continue to exist.

 
**d'Eon:**
As long as this world exists.
So I leave you with these words.

 
**d'Eon:**
&ndash;Vive la France!

 
**Ghost of Robespierre:**
...Ah, Vive la...

 
**Ghost of Robespierre:**
...Fr...an...ce...

 
**Mash:**
&ndash;Magical energy signature eliminated.

 
**Fou:**
Foou...

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Good work, d'Eon.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Now he can rest in peace.

---
 

 
**d'Eon:**
...Yes.

 
**d'Eon:**
Thanks to you, we were able to bring him peace.
Thank you, Master.
