# Orion (Artemis)

## Unsweet Honeymoon

**Artemis:**
Hello, Master! Are you here?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Please leave.
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I'm not home.
 


---
 
**Artemis:**
How mean!
Darling, this Master is neglecting his duties.

 
**Artemis:**
...Darling?

 
**Mash:**
Um, please don't stare at me like that.

 
**Fou:**
Fuukaaaa!

 
**Orion:**
It's fine, it's all right, it's not like it'll hurt you.

 
**Artemis:**
...Hmph!

 
**Mash:**
You (Orion) are in trouble, aren't you?

 
**Orion:**
That's right. I'm in trouble.
Physically.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Please leave.
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I just remembered something, gotta go.
 


---
 
**Artemis:**
Darling,
This person is so heartless.

 
**Artemis:**
Just because Mash is here is no excuse!

 
**Mash:**
???

 
**Orion:**
...Just tell them what you want already.

 
**Artemis:**
Okay!
Um, we want to go to France!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Why?
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
For what reason?
 


---
 
**Artemis:**
Our honeymoon!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Please leave!
 


---
 
**Mash:**
We're here...

 
**Artemis:**
Wow, so this is France!
It's wonderful! The air's so different than Greece!

 
**Orion:**
Sorry, she's being so selfish...

 
**Artemis:**
Let's get this honeymoon started!
First, the Arc de Triomphe!

 
**Mash:**
The Arc de Triomphe was built in 1806,
so it doesn't exist yet...

 
**Artemis:**
How about the Eiffel Tower?

 
**Mash:**
That's 1887.
If you're willing to wait another 450 years or so...

 
**Artemis:**
Aww! No way!

 
**Orion:**
Right, right, are you done?
Let's just wander around a bit and go home.

 
**Mash:**
I really don't feel like going on a tourist trip...

 
**Artemis:**
Sigh... I guess we'll have to see the towns or something.

 
**Artemis:**
But it's probably boring without the Arc de Triomphe or Eiffel Tower... Let's go, but don't expect too much.

 
**Artemis:**
Aww, it really is boring.
The only things different are the buildings and clothes.

 
**Artemis:**
There's people,
there's dogs...

 
**Artemis:**
And there's monsters...

 
**Mash:**
...Why are there monsters here?
Oh, forget it. Let's just fight them! Help me out!

 
**Artemis:**
What? I don't wanna!

 
**Orion:**
Just do it!

 
**Artemis:**
Okaay.
It can't be helped, let's kill them!


**--BATTLE--:**

**Mash:**
Whew. I didn't expect to see monsters...

 
**Artemis:**
What are they doing here?
This world was repaired, right?

 
**Mash:**
Something might be happening.
We have to look into it.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Let's do that.
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Agreed.
 


---
 
**Artemis:**
Huh? But our honeymoon...

 
**Orion:**
Right, right. Well, the honeymoon's delayed.

 
**Artemis:**
Noooo...

 
**Orion:**
...

 
**Artemis:**
...

 
**Orion:**
Oh, fine! Fine!
Listen, Artemis.

 
**Orion:**
"This is our honeymoon."
We're fighting monsters on our honeymoon.

 
**Orion:**
We'll sightsee and beat bad guys.
Good times all around.

 
**Artemis:**
Orion...

 
**Orion:**
Sounds fun, right? Sounds great, right?
I know it sounds totally fun to me!

 
**Artemis:**
...Yeah, you're right!
Darling, I love you!

 
**Orion:**
Your love is way too clingy. No thanks.

 
**Artemis:**
That's so mean!

 
**Mash:**
...Master, do those two like each other, or not?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
What do you think?
 
**Mash:**
...I'm not sure.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
They're lovey-dovey.
 
**Mash:**
I-I see.

 


---
 
**Mash:**
Love is... Very deep.

 
**Artemis:**
Where are we?

 
**Mash:**
An abandoned military camp, I think.
There shouldn't be anything interesting here.

 
**Orion:**
Yeah, the only interesting things would be...
You see all those bags in the corner?

 
**Mash:**
Yes, I do...

 
**Orion:**
Body bags, right?

 
**Mash:**
They are.

 
**Orion:**
...They're moving around.

 
**Artemis:**
Aah! That's scary!
Orion, protect me!

 
**Orion:**
It's the other way around, dummy!
I need you to protect me!

 
**Mash:**
So this time it's the living dead, huh?
Artemis, let's fight!

 
**Artemis:**
Okay! Orion needs my help, which powers me up!
Let's go!


**--BATTLE--:**

**Orion:**
...Whew. That was hard work.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You did nothing.
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
You did something?
 


---
 
**Orion:**
Master, don't say that.
It's depressing... It makes me really sad...

 
**Artemis:**
Sad Orion is so cute!
Mmmmmmm!

 
**Orion:**
You'll crush me! You're crushing me!
And I'm not cute, I'm cool!

 
**Artemis:**
Come on, let's go somewhere else. This time,
I'd like someplace that doesn't smell like blood!

 
**Mash:**
O-Okay, we'll go somewhere else.

 
**Artemis:**
...This place reeks of blood!

 
**Mash:**
I'm sorry.
But this castle should have been purified long ago&ndash;

 
**Artemis:**
Aww, my honeymoon...
Our trip as newlyweds...

 
**Orion:**
Don't worry, as long as we defeat whatever's lurking here, I'm sure the smell will be gone.

 
**Artemis:**
Hmph... I'm really irritated now!
Whoever runs into me should just blame their fate!

 
**Artemis:**
Let's go, Orion, Master!


**--BATTLE--:**

**Artemis:**
Okay, we beat them!

 
**Orion:**
Sigh, oh brother...
I'm tired (mentally, even though I did nothing)...

 
**Mash:**
To think Lamias nested up in the castle...

 
**Artemis:**
My honeymoon is ruined...

 
**Orion:**
...Hmm?
Hey, Artemis.

 
**Artemis:**
What is it, Darling?

 
**Orion:**
Here.

 
**Artemis:**
Huh? This is...a ring?

 
**Orion:**
The Lamia had it... Well, you want a ring for your honeymoon, right?

 
**Artemis:**
Oh...

 
**Orion:**
Listen, I know a ring I took off a Lamia isn't going to make you that happy&ndash;

 
**Artemis:**
No, I'll treasure it! I'll treasure it forever!
Yay! Hooray!

 
**Orion:**
Sigh. Oh, brother...

 
**Orion:**
Master, Mash.
Sorry for the trouble.

 
**Mash:**
Not at all.
...I see. Their love is very complex.

 
**Mash:**
But it's kind of nice to watch.

 
**Orion:**
I-It's not like that, okay!?
This is... um... it's not like that!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
No one likes a male tsundere.
 


---
 
**Orion:**
It's not like that, I said&ndash; Argh, whatever!
Mash, just let me snuggle between your breasts!

 
**Mash:**
Please stop using me as a way to get out of trouble!

 
**Artemis:**
...What are you doing, Darling?
You idiot! Idiot! IDIOT!


## A Certain Love Song

**Artemis:**
Hey, Master!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I'm not here, leave!
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I'm not home!
 


---
 
**Mash:**
Good answer, Senpai.
But the door's already open so that won't work.

 
**Orion:**
What's up, guys?
We've come to cause more trouble.

 
**Mash:**
Oh, so trouble is guaranteed...

 
**Artemis:**
I want to go to America!
Take me there!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
No way!
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
You can't!
 


---
 
**Mash:**
...And here we are in America.

 
**Artemis:**
Yay! Broadway!
Let's go to Broadway, Darling!

 
**Orion:**
Um... Broadway is...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Not here.
 


---
 
**Mash:**
If you can wait another century or so...

 
**Artemis:**
Aww, I'm disappointed! But that's okay, anywhere's fun as long as I'm with Darling!

 
**Artemis:**
Come on, let's go!

 
**Orion:**
Sorry, can you come with us for a while?

 
**Mash:**
...Fine.
Let's go.

 
**Artemis:**
Wow, it's a town! How wonderful!
It feels just like a Western!

 
**Artemis:**
...Are there cowboys?

 
**Mash:**
I don't think there are any in this era...
Wait a minute. Why is there no one here?

 
**Mash:**
That cry... Is that...
A wyvern?

 
**Artemis:**
Oh, wonderful!
A dragon!

 
**Artemis:**
...Wait, I'm sick of dragons.
We fought a bunch of them at sea.

 
**Artemis:**
I don't know who it is, but they suck at picking enemies.

 
**Mash:**
Um, let's fight them!

 
**Orion:**
Right, right. Let's do it!


**--BATTLE--:**

**Mash:**
I don't see any Celtic warriors...
I guess this wasn't their doing.

 
**Artemis:**
It's strange, huh?

 
**Orion:**
...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
What's wrong?
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Something bothering you?
 


---
 
**Orion:**
No, sorry.
It's nothing.

 
**Orion:**
I was just... Yeah, I was just thinking which I like better, Mash's legs or breasts.

 
**Artemis:**
&ndash;Darling?

 
**Orion:**
No, um, well, wai&mdash;

 
**Mash:**
Aww,
Orion is such a silly person.

 
**Mash:**
...He is a person, right?

 
**Orion:**
I'm a person, okay!?
This is just a temporary form, okay!?

 
**Artemis:**
Sigh.
Hey, Orion?

 
**Orion:**
Huh? What is it?

 
**Artemis:**
All these empty plains are boring me!
We came all the way to America!

 
**Orion:**
Sigh, there's nothing we can do.

 
**Orion:**
Then let me tell you this funny story about how I met this guy's wife when she was wearing nothing but&ndash;

 
**Artemis:**
...That's not a funny story, is it?

 
**Orion:**
It's not, is... BWRAGH!

 
**Artemis:**
Like, sheesh! HMPH!

 
**Mash:**
She just said “Hmph!”

 
**Fou:**
Fou...

 
**Artemis:**
...Hmm? Not again!
First wyverns, now what!?

 
**Artemis:**
Golems! Golems, I see!
Fine, fine! I'll do it!

 
**Orion:**
Oww...


**--BATTLE--:**

**Artemis:**
Hmph!
Where are all these monsters coming from?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...
 


---
 
**Mash:**
Master?

 
**Orion:**
Master!

 
**Orion:**
...Sorry, but don't say anything.
It's better if I tell her.

 
**Mash:**
?

 
**Artemis:**
Huh? What? Are you keeping secrets?
Come on, you have to tell me, too!

 
**Orion:**
...It's not a secret, but, um, well, you see...

 
**Orion:**
...Basically, don't you think that all these monsters who show up in this world are our fault?

 
**Artemis:**
&ndash;Huh?

 
**Orion:**
I mean, I'm nothing special,
but you're supposedly a god, right?

 
**Orion:**
Even if not in your Divine Form, you still have some influence on this world.

 
**Orion:**
Distorting it, opening holes and what have you...

 
**Orion:**
So it's kind of obvious that weird things are gonna pour out from there&ndash;

 
**Artemis:**
...So what?
I'm not allowed to go to other worlds?

 
**Artemis:**
...Only where a Holy Grail War is being fought?

 
**Orion:**
Well, I guess... that's how things look.

 
**Artemis:**
...
...

 
**Artemis:**
WAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!
No, no, no, NO, NOOOO!

 
**Orion:**
Sigh, what do I do now...

 
**Artemis:**
I mean, I thought we could finally, finally go outdoors on a date!

 
**Artemis:**
Without having to sneak behind Big Brother's back!

 
**Artemis:**
I wanted to hold hands, and hug, and make out and stuff!

 
**Artemis:**
WAAAAHHHH!

 
**Orion:**
Sigh...

 
**Mash:**
...W-What do we do, Master?
She's bawling. She's totally bawling.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Just leave it to Orion.
 


---
 
**Orion:**
Thanks, Master.
Could you help with something else, too?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Sure.
 


---
 
**Artemis:**
What?

 
**Orion:**
Does it really matter?

 
**Artemis:**
Does what...matter?

 
**Orion:**
Does it matter if there are enemies?
It doesn't mean you and I can't go out.

 
**Artemis:**
Huh?

 
**Orion:**
I mean, you're one of the gods of Olympus!
Does a god really care if she causes others trouble!?

 
**Artemis:**
B-But I can't do that!

 
**Orion:**
You retaliated a hundredfold to those that peeked on you when you were taking a bath, didn't you?

 
**Artemis:**
(Sob) You've got me there!
But I was embarrassed!

 
**Orion:**
Then it doesn't matter!
What kind of god cares what happens to other people?

 
**Artemis:**
But&ndash;

 
**Orion:**
One more thing! ...Throw those stupid worries that I'm going to hate you into Hades or something!

 
**Orion:**
It's too late! It's way too late for me to hate you for stuff like that now, dummy!

 
**Artemis:**
(Sob...)

 
**Orion:**
...

 
**Mash:**
A... A dragon!
It's directly above us, and descending!

 
**Orion:**
Artemis, you ready?

 
**Artemis:**
Yeah... Yeah!
That's right! I'm a god! I'm super-duper important!

 
**Artemis:**
So I'm allowed to cause a little bit of trouble, right? 'Cause I'm a god!

 
**Artemis:**
All right! Let's do this!
Orion, get on my head like always!

 
**Orion:**
Sure, sure, let's win this!

 
**Artemis:**
Yeah!


**--BATTLE--:**

**Artemis:**
Easy win!

 
**Artemis:**
Whew, I worked up a sweat!

 
**Orion:**
(Pant, pant) ...I say this all the time,
but fighting as a plush toy is rough...

 
**Artemis:**
Oh, hey! Hey! Master!

 
**Artemis:**
Um, I might cause a lot of problems for you in the future, but&ndash;

 
**Artemis:**
Thanks for having me with you!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I know.
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I'm ready for it.
 


---
 
**Artemis:**
Thanks! Teeheehee!
I like you almost as much as Orion!

 
**Artemis:**
If there's a god you like, let me know, okay?
I'll introduce you!


## Golden Anniversary!

**???:**
Master! Master! Please hide me, Master!!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Not here now, leave a message.
 
**???:**
Waaah! Your rejection hurts my poor little heart!
I beg of you, Master!!!

 
**Orion:**
A murderer! I'm being chased by a bloodthirsty killer!
It's a murderer in a red and green striped sweater and a hockey mask!

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Orion, what's going on!?
 
**Orion:**
Just open up! We'll talk then!

 
**Orion:**
...

 
**Orion:**
Don't tell me you're not going to open up!?
You devil! Oni! Artemis!!!

 


---
 
**???:**
Daaarling♪

 
**Orion:**
Oh, Lady Artemis has made her appearance!
Sorry! I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

 
**Orion:**
I understand!

 
**Orion:**
If this is about pretending to be Nursery Rhyme's partner to trick the female staff of Chaldea into fawning over me...

 
**Orion:**
I regret my actions from the bottom of my heart!

 
**Artemis:**
...You were doing that?

 
**Orion:**
Ah, so you didn't know...then forge&ndash;gyaaah!!! Please! Please don't twist me like that! I don't bend that way!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I didn't see anything...

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I'm going to bed...
 


---
 
**Artemis:**
Yoo-hoo, Master! How are you?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Um... Who's that next to you?
 
**Artemis:**
Oh this? It used to be Orion. Now it's a rag.

 
**Artemis:**
You can use it to clean the floors!

 
**Orion:**
Cut it out!

 
**Orion:**
I thought I was going to die!
Actually, I very nearly DID die!

 
**Artemis:**
Oh, you're fine. I held back.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I'm good.
 
**Artemis:**
Yep, yep. Being good is a wonderful thing☆

 
**Artemis:**
Does darling appreciate his health now, too?

 
**Orion:**
Yes! Absolutely, yes! Especially with you!
Hooray for health! Not hurting is wonderful!

 


---
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
So, what's all this, then?


---
 
**Orion:**
...What is it?

 
**Artemis:**
Oh, right! So I've been wanting to ask Master...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Golden...


---
 
**Orion:**
Wedding...

 
**Mash:**
Anniversary?

 
**Fou:**
Foufoufoufoufou.

 
**Mash:**
Yes, yes, Fou.
Food time? Here you go.

 
**Artemis:**
Mash, that was a sad response.
As a goddess, that absolutely infuriates me!!!

 
**Mash:**
M-my apologies. I was just surprised that it was a golden anniversary...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Doesn't a golden anniversary mean...


---
 
**Mash:**
Yes, it is a celebration for a couple who's been married for fifty years.

 
**Mash:**
The celebration is said to have started in the year 1860 in Germany, and the custom spread throughout Europe.

 
**Orion:**
Oh, I see. It must have been a big deal if a couple was together for 50 years in the nineteenth century.

 
**Orion:**
No wonder people want to celebrate.

 
**Artemis:**
Isn't it wonderful? I admire that kind of celebration...

 
**Mash:**
The custom is to give gifts of gold, or anything made in pairs.

 
**Orion:**
...So what's this golden thing have to do with anything?

 
**Mash:**
Yes, um... Artemis, your marriage was quite recent...

 
**Orion:**
I'M STILL SINGLE!

 
**Artemis:**
How cruel! But we did get married! Married! M-A-R-R-I-E-D!

 
**Artemis:**
We even went on a honeymoon, and you even gave me a ring!!!

 
**Mash:**
She's having a tantrum...

 
**Mash:**
But Artemis is correct.
You gave her a ring, and you went on a honeymoon.

 
**Orion:**
Heh. Miss Mash. You've forgotten one critical thing: I'm a nice guy who goes around freely like a wandering cloud in the sky.

 
**Orion:**
From one journey to another, from port to port...
I start from Greece and go all around the world.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
So you want to travel around the world...

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
To do a lot of Celtic-ing with a bunch of women.


---
 
**Orion:**
DAMN RIGHT!

 
**Orion:**
(Gasp!) Oh crap! I didn't mean to say that out loud!

 
**Artemis:**
Teehee. Is that so, Orion?
Then I shall tear this wandering cloud to shreds!

 
**Orion:**
NOOOOOO!

 
**Orion:**
I think this golden anniversary is a GREAT idea!
Now that I think of it, we're Heroic Spirits...

 
**Orion:**
...and Heroic Spirits essentially have no concept of time.

 
**Orion:**
I feel like we've been together for fifty years already.

 
**Artemis:**
You're absolutely right, darling! For fifty years, our love as a married couple has grown stronger!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
He's been brainwashed...


---
 
**Mash:**
What makes this sad is that...though it could be harmful, this shouldn't be much of a hindrance to us if we don't do anything...

 
**Artemis:**
Now come, let's do a golden anniversary!
Um, what do we do on a golden anniversary?

 
**Artemis:**
Shall we gather a bunch of humans with the golden touch, like King Midas?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Stop.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Please no.


---
 
**Artemis:**
Oh, you're right! A golden statue is nothing special these days! ...If that's the case, it has to be...

 
**Artemis:**
A Rayshift trip to travel around the world!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
(Mash...)


---
 
**Mash:**
(Yes, I have a very bad feeling about this. They are definitely going to get Senpai in all kinds of trouble...)

 
**Mash:**
(Let's just slowly back out of the room so they don't notice.)

 
**Fou:**
Fou!!!

 
**Artemis:**
!

 
**Orion:**
!

 
**Artemis:**
Teehee, you're not getting away! Come, Master!

 
**Artemis:**
You're going to help make sure our golden anniversary goes beautifully!

 
**Mash:**
Fou...

 
**Fou:**
Fou?

 
**Mash:**
Rayshift successful.
We have safely arrived at the French seaside.

 
**Mash:**
Good work, Master.

 
**Fou:**
Fou!

 
**Artemis:**
Ahhh, what a wonderful breeze! The ocean is outside my jurisdiction but that just makes it all the more exciting.

 
**Artemis:**
We're in an era where I don't have to fight for territory. So let's have a nice, peaceful talk about our married life!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Huh?

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Where's Orion?


---
 
**Artemis:**
...Darling!?

 
**Orion:**
Hahahaha! Successfully escaped!

 
**Orion:**
I mean, I know we'll eventually go back to Chaldea, so I am definitely going to get punished...

 
**Orion:**
But to hell with that!
My name's Orion, the famed hunter of love!!!

 
**Orion:**
I'm a hero with a real lust for life, if you know what I'm saying!
Because when I'm around, it's always bear season, eyy!

 
**???:**
～♪

 
**Orion:**
Whoa! I spy a real sweet hottie over there!

 
**Orion:**
I only see the back of her head, but it's a black-haired beauty! Prim and proper! Looks like I hit the jackpot!

 
**Orion:**
Woohoo! I'm gonna snuggle her by pretending to be a cute creature!

 
**Orion:**
My body is a cute teddy bear!
No one can resist a cute stuffed bear!

 
**Orion:**
Hewwo, pwetty wady, I'm Owion!

 
**???:**
...!

 
**???:**
What the...!?

 
**Artemis:**
Ah!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
What's wrong?


---
 
**Artemis:**
My goddess senses are tingling! I sense danger!

 
**Artemis:**
Darling... My darling's...skull...is getting caved in...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Let's go save him!
 
**Artemis:**
Right! Hold on, my darling!
We're coming to rescue you!

 
**Artemis:**
And then afterwards, if you can explain to me IN DETAIL why you fled, that would be appreciated!

 
**Mash:**
(Artemis may be worried about Orion, but she is still REALLY angry...)

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Huh. Well, he'll be missed.
 
**Artemis:**
He's not dead yet!!!

 
**Artemis:**
Let's go, Master!
Let's go and save my darling!

 
**Artemis:**
There will be many mouths-to-mouths!
Much smooching!

 
**Mash:**
I hate to break this to you, but mouth-to-mouth won't be effective on a caved-in skull!

 


---
 
**Artemis:**
Ummm, according to my goddess senses, he should be around here...

 
**Artemis:**
There!

 
**Orion:**
Kyuuu...kyuu...kyu...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Orion...

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Has turned into a creature that's only cute...


---
 
**Artemis:**
Come to your senses, Darling!
I shall immediately do mouth-to-mouth on you!

 
**Artemis:**
Hng!!! (Squeeze)

 
**Orion:**
Gagck!?
...!?!?!?!?!?!!?!?!?

 
**Mash:**
S-S-S-S-S-S-Senpai! Orion's face is turning into something unbelievable! Even though he's only a bear! Even though he's only a plushie...!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
(Punch Orion with all my might.)
 
**Orion:**
Ahhh... Aaaaaagck!?

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
(Pull Artemis away with all my might.)
 
**Artemis:**
Kyaaah!? Master, touching someone else's wife is fiendish!!!

 
**Artemis:**
And doing so in front of Mash...!

 
**Mash:**
No, it's fine! I know this is all a misunderstanding, so I'm not mad!

 


---
 
**Orion:**
I thought I was gonna die. Actually, I did die. TWICE! Once from my caved-in skull, and again from getting suffocated!

 
**Mash:**
I'm glad you&ndash;

 
**Orion:**
Master. Have you ever wondered why you're alive?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
A few times...


---
 
**Orion:**
We both...have it tough...

 
**Martha:**
My apologies... Something like a tiny wild animal jumped on me, so I punched it to smithereens without thinking...

 
**Mash:**
Martha...

 
**Martha:**
Yes, I know! I know what you are thinking!
But I hope you understand my predicament as well!

 
**Martha:**
As you know, in this getup, I become more aggressive than usual.

 
**Martha:**
So...I couldn't help it... I'm sorry! I regret my actions!
So much so, I will double my praying time!

 
**Orion:**
This woman's amazing.
That was the first time I ever felt my insides leaking out.

 
**Artemis:**
His first time... How dare she be my darling's first!!

 
**Artemis:**
This is unforgivable! You're supposed to be a saint... Have you no shame!?

 
**Artemis:**
The only person who can hurt my darling is me!

 
**Orion:**
Oh boy. Aren't you just full of cheerful bloodlust.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
And she's your wife.


---
 
**Orion:**
What. A. Let. Down.

 
**Martha:**
Uh, um... I'm not sure if I can say this, given that I was the one who directly inflicted this holy punishment...

 
**Martha:**
Actually, I am not foolish enough to get involved in lovers' quarrels or domestic disputes...

 
**Martha:**
I'm not like that, but...Artemis!
Your love is a bit too aggressive!

 
**Martha:**
First of all, love should be tender, even when you're hurting your beloved.

 
**Martha:**
No matter how fiendish, devilish, demonic, or even...um, ursine your partner is&mdash;

 
**Martha:**
I can say with certainty that unrequited love is no good!

 
**Artemis:**
It's not unrequited! We are very much in love!

 
**Orion:**
I'm actually a little hurt to be called fiendish, devilish, and demonic.

 
**Martha:**
No. If it truly was a mutual love, no married man would so casually hit on another woman.

 
**Martha:**
Even if Orion is guilty, I can see that Artemis also has need for improvement and reform.

 
**Martha:**
I do not intend to criticize the ways of the Greeks, but I am called the patron saint of wives!

 
**Martha:**
Artemis and Orion! I shall correct your twisted, unrequited love with my holy fists!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
This is going to hurt...

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Head trauma, here I come...


---
 
**Martha:**
Well, yes, I'm afraid that's the plan! Don't worry.
I will make sure not to hurt you much, Fujimaru!


**--BATTLE--:**

**Artemis:**
Ungh... She's tough! Darling, were you holding back!?

 
**Orion:**
'Course not! I always take battle seriously!

 
**Martha:**
Mnnngh...as obsessive and unhealthy as it is, love is still love...I suppose.

 
**Martha:**
And based on Orion's behavior, it doesn't seem like it is completely unrequited love...

 
**Artemis:**
That's right! Our love is mutual... It is!

 
**Mash:**
Mutual love... To think of others, and love others.

 
**Mash:**
It doesn't appear that way... No, but maybe...those two seem to have some bizarre sort of love of their own...

 
**Mash:**
...Even if they do not follow the same path, or if it's unrequited, as long as they respect one another, that may be fine...

 
**Martha:**
...Well, there are indeed very dangerous unrequited affections in this world...

 
**Mash:**
And yet... I suppose...

 
**Martha:**
...Either way, I seem to have jumped to conclusions. One cannot say that just understanding each other can be called love.

 
**Martha:**
I'm sorry, Artemis. And Bearion.

 
**Martha:**
No matter what form it takes, love is unchanging, and it is one of the primal emotions. One should love greatly, and so find great happiness.

 
**Artemis:**
Our beliefs may differ, but love is the same all around! Orion, let's love each other to the fullest!

 
**Mash:**
...Oh?

 
**Artemis:**
Huh? I thought my head felt light. Darling's gone.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
He sneaked away a minute ago.


---
 
**Artemis:**
...

 
**Artemis:**
Daaarrrliiing!!!


**--ARROW--:**

**Orion:**
Fwahahahahaha!

 
**Orion:**
I don't know how or where I escaped to, but looks like I ended up in a different world!

 
**Orion:**
What should I do? It'll be scary if I get found now. Maybe I should hide out here for a couple of days until things cool down.

 
**???:**
Oh? Oh my, oh my.
A guest. It's a guest! And it's a bear!

 
**???:**
Oh, sir! Are you the one she's been waiting for?

 
**Orion:**
Not sure what you're talking about, but sure!

 
**???:**
I see. Then we need to have a wedding!

 
**Orion:**
Uh, actually, wrong person!
I mean, wrong bear!

 
**???:**
It's a wedding! The entire country is going to party!
The princess will surely be pleased!

 
**???:**
Her prince has come back!

 
**Orion:**
Time to be a sneaky bear...

 
**???:**
No! You can't run away! (Grab)

 
**Orion:**
Gyaaah! Let go! You got the wrong bear!

 
**Orion:**
Nothing good can come of me posing as a prince in a fairytale place like this!

 
**???:**
Don't be so naughty!

 
**???:**
A bad prince like you...needs to turn into a ■■■!

 
**???:**
This curse won't break until the princess kisses you!

 
**Orion:**
...What the heck!?

 
**Artemis:**
Here! I've got darling's scent!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...I'm exhausted.
 
**Mash:**
You really are getting dragged around the world.

 
**Mash:**
Where could Orion have fled to so quickly?

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
You mean...the scent of your prey?
 
**Mash:**
Master's burn doesn't have the usual sting...
Maybe because jet lag has [♂ him /♀️ her} worn out?

 


---
 
**Artemis:**
What a cute town...

 
**Artemis:**
After our golden anniversary celebration, I would love to live in a home like this!

 
**Artemis:**
Master, since you saved the world, I want you to find a nice property for me!

 
**Artemis:**
And I want you to live nearby, so we can be neighbors!

 
**Artemis:**
You know, it's important to have good neighbors!

 
**Mash:**
Good neighbors...

 
**Artemis:**
Now all I need is my darling...

 
**???:**
Oh? Oh my, oh my.
There are so many visitors today!

 
**???:**
I'm so happy. Adults and children both are welcome in the Land of Sweets!

 
**???:**
Why? Because I can just turn the adults into children, and then it's fine!

 
**Mash:**
Nursery Rhyme...!

 
**Artemis:**
Oh my, you are a cutie.
But... I'm sorry, my heart belongs only to my darling!

 
**Artemis:**
But that strange fate of yours, make sure you treasure it, okay?

 
**Artemis:**
Anyway, have you seen my darling?

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
Darling...?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
The talking stuffed bear.


---
 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
Oh no... You can't! That prince bear is the princess's!

 
**Artemis:**
...What did you just say?

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
The prince has finally come home to his sweet princess!

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
And we're going to hold a grand wedding party to celebrate! You can't steal someone's true love in a fairytale!

 
**Artemis:**
...Oh? Uh-huuuh...

 
**Artemis:**
Hey Master. Sounds like my darling is at the princess's place.

 
**Artemis:**
How strange. If he's not here, where could he be?

 
**Mash:**
M-Master...this is bad! This is very bad!

 
**Mash:**
I'm afraid the Land of Sweets is going to be set on fire, melting the chocolates and candies... Even the cakes will get charred!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Calm down!


---
 
**Artemis:**
It's fine. I am calm.
But I will never forgive Orion.

 
**Artemis:**
A grand party with a princess...
This isn't an affair... This is the real deal!

 
**Artemis:**
This was supposed to be a happy golden anniversary celebration...but to learn that he's in another serious relationship...! Orion, you dummy!

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
Protect the Land of Sweets, everyone!

 
**Mash:**
I'm not sure if they're enemies...but let's ready for battle, Master!


**--BATTLE--:**

**Nursery Rhyme:**
Kyuuu. I'm dizzy...

 
**Mash:**
Poor Nursery Rhyme is down!

 
**Artemis:**
I will not allow my darling to get married! I'll capture that bear and take him to file divorce papers right away!

 
**Artemis:**
Oh, and Master, use your authority to annul the marriage! That way, he won't be a divorcé!

 
**Artemis:**
Darling, where are you!?

 
**Brynhild:**
Um... Excuse me... Are you perhaps looking for a bear?

 
**Mash:**
Brynhild!?

 
**Artemis:**
Are you the homewrecker!?

 
**Brynhild:**
Please, no... It is not what you think...

 
**Brynhild:**
...I wanted to return him to you.

 
**Artemis:**
...Come again?

 
**Artemis:**
Darling! No... Look at you...!

 
**Mash:**
(I thought I saw a similar-looking chocolate during last year's Valentine's Day...)

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
He's mouthing something...

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
“Help...”


---
 
**Brynhild:**
Um... I was searching for Sigurd...

 
**Brynhild:**
Nursery brought this bear thinking he was Sigurd...

 
**Brynhild:**
Even when I said he wasn't, she wouldn't listen. She said, “He may be a chocolate bear right now, but he'll turn into Sigurd when the curse is lifted.”

 
**Brynhild:**
And so I was a little flustered.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Is there a way to lift the chocolate curse?


---
 
**Brynhild:**
Yes... According to Nursery...

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
You KISS him!!!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You what, now?


---
 
**Mash:**
What!?

 
**Artemis:**
Kiss!?

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
Yes, that's right. Kissing him will lift the chocolate curse!

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
His bear curse may also get lifted, but I'm not sure, since that's not my specialty!

 
**Mash:**
I see...

 
**Mash:**
So that's why Brynhild was flustered... She was afraid that whoever could lift the curse wouldn't show up if she left.

 
**Brynhild:**
Yes, I was at a loss.

 
**Brynhild:**
This bear is not Sigurd, but there is no doubt he is a hero.

 
**Brynhild:**
No matter what form he'd taken, as a former Valkyrie,
I didn't feel right abandoning him...

 
**Artemis:**
...

 
**Artemis:**
Hey Master, why do you think darling tries to escape?

 
**Artemis:**
Weddings, golden anniversary celebrations... They don't really matter to me... Well, I might not go that far.

 
**Artemis:**
But as long as my darling just stays with me... As long as he and I can live together forever, for eternity...

 
**Artemis:**
That's all I really need.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
He's scared he'll start to hate you.
 
**Artemis:**
Scared...that he'll hate me?

 
**Brynhild:**
...That may be correct.

 
**Brynhild:**
No matter how intimate a man and woman might be, if they are together for long enough, they may end up killing each other.

 
**Brynhild:**
That is not because of pure hatred, but hatred that stems from love.

 
**Brynhild:**
The more one loves, the stronger their wish not to detest or be detested becomes.

 
**Brynhild:**
Human emotion is not something that is constant...
But it shines all the brighter for it.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
He loves, therefore he wants to be pursued.
 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
I know! I know!

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
The prince falls for Cinderella when she flees!

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
That bear flees from you because he wants you to always feel excited!

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
Because eternity is too boring!

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
When you're super bored, you might start hating the person you're with!

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
That's why you flee! The chase keeps you interested in the other person!

 


---
 
**Artemis:**
...I see. So that's how human emotions work.

 
**Artemis:**
As a Divine Spirit, that kind of thinking is incomprehensible to me. I can't imagine eternity being...uncertain...

 
**Brynhild:**
...True, it may not be something you can comprehend.
I really only understand it in theory.

 
**Artemis:**
Eternity is boring... So you say.

 
**Artemis:**
Aw, my darling is impossible! He wants me to keep loving him by making me so anxious!

 
**Artemis:**
Fine. If that's what he wants, I'll chase after him for eternity!

 
**Artemis:**
As long as my heart swells from the occasional, whimsical kindness from him, I will go absolutely crazy for my darling!

 
**Artemis:**
Yes, yes, my Maiden Circuits are in overdrive! Now, my darling! I shall lift your dreadful chocolate curse!

 
**Orion:**
Owwwwwwwwwwwwwww!

 
**Artemis:**
Good morning, my darling!

 
**Orion:**
Eh? Huh? I thought I was chocolate...

 
**Orion:**
Ack! Artemis!? I-I'm sorry I ran away!
It was just a spur of the moment thing! I swear!

 
**Artemis:**
...Yep! It's fine, my darling. I forgive you!

 
**Orion:**
Eh, seriously!?

 
**Orion:**
Normally this kind of offense would result in you reducing me to my constituent atoms!

 
**Orion:**
Wait, did I end up in a parallel world? Is this for real?
Oh, no, I'm in a world that's gonna get pruned, aren't I!?

 
**Orion:**
Oh, but if it's a parallel world...

 
**Artemis:**
Come, my darling. Let's continue our golden anniversary celebration!

 
**Artemis:**
Where shall we go next? It is a golden anniversary, so maybe the Temple of the Golden Pavilion in Japan?

 
**Artemis:**
Or perhaps the Golden Gate Bridge?

 
**Artemis:**
Anywhere is fine. As long as I'm with my darling, it will be wonderful!

 
**Orion:**
Why hello there, delicate-looking girl.
I don't see much of your type in Greece.

 
**Orion:**
How would you like to escape into a love adventure, hmm?

 
**Brynhild:**
Um... I can't... My lance will become lighter and lighter...

 
**Brynhild:**
It could even float up and away like a balloon...

 
**Orion:**
Wha&ndash;whoa!?

 
**Artemis:**
Okay, my darling.

 
**Artemis:**
Let's go get you set on fire at the Temple of the Golden Pavilion. It's fine, you'll burn well!

 
**Artemis:**
Or the Golden Gate Bridge is fine too.
You can bungee jump without a rope!

 
**Orion:**
Well, I guess that's one way to go...

 
**Orion:**
...What the heck am I making clever commentary for!? Aaand Artemis is just her usual self!

 
**Orion:**
HEEELLLP MEEE!!!

 
**Mash:**
...Master, do you have any closing remarks?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Love takes so many forms!
 
**Brynhild:**
That wasn't...much of a closing remark...

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Love is scary!
 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
That's my line.
