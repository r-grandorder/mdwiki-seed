# Leonardo da Vinci

## Not Even The Almighty Hand Can Reach Here

**Mash:**
...Rayshift successful, Senpai.

 
**Mash:**
19th Century London. The Fourth Singularity has already started to correct itself.

 
**Mash:**
There's still a great deal of mist, but it's a normal mist. It's not the demonic fog, so it should be safe for the residents!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Are there people around?

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I don't see any carriages moving.
 


---
 
**Dr. Roman:**
It should gradually go back to normal. The iconic scene of people and carriages on the streets should return soon enough.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
That's all thanks to you. Eventually, we will need to fix all the other Singularities like that, too.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Well, Rayshifting to the Singularities and corrections to the abnormalities are all unprecedented, so it's not that there aren't any concerns...

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Enough of that. I'm sure we'll learn more as we go.
For now, let's just keep moving forward!

 
**Mash:**
Understood, Doctor.

 
**Fou:**
Fou, foufou.

 
**Mash:**
Oh, Fou. You're with us again?
When did you...?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Um, now that we've finished the small talk, can I get down to business?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Can you hear me, Da Vinci? Do we need to prove our existence and adjust Sheba's elevation angle this time?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Actually, are you sure you can leave all that to me and the staff? You can always come back, you know!

 
**Da Vinci:**
Ahahaha! So you caught me already.
I guess it was inevitable.

 
**Da Vinci:**
Don't worry so much, Dr. Roman! We're in a Singularity that's already finished correcting itself.

 
**Da Vinci:**
Besides, this place is close to the modern age. It's the 19th century. With the abnormality corrected, proving our existence shouldn't be too hard, even for you!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
I know, but...!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
I just wanted you to understand what was going through my mind when I turned around and realized you had disappeared. I was afraid! I was petrified!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Hardly half a second had gone by when I thought, “Huh? What the heck is that darn technical advisor doing?
Is she playing?”

 
**Da Vinci:**
Relax. Think of this as training in case of an emergency. In case there comes a time when I'm not around.

 
**Da Vinci:**
Okay. It's been a while since I've been in London.
Now that the pesky demonic fog is gone... Let's see...

 
**Da Vinci:**
Oh, darn. Things have barely gone back to normal.
How disappointing.

 
**Da Vinci:**
And where did we Rayshift to?
Soho? We can't have any fun here!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
(Seriously? Is that supposed to be a critique?)

 
**Da Vinci:**
...I wanted to go to Hyde Park.

 
**Da Vinci:**
I wanted to go to the department store to shop with all the wonderfully fashionable ladies, and then head over to a club to socialize with the gentlemen...

 
**Da Vinci:**
I'm not asking to get to be a noblewoman, but I had at least hoped to cut loose a little.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I see, to have fun as a lady...

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I see, to have fun as a gentleman...
 


---
 
**Mash:**
How expected, Senpai! This is so like Da Vinci! First, she Rayshifts just to take a break, and now she wants to enjoy herself by flouting the usual gender roles of the time!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Okay, calm down, Fujimaru and Mash. Don't get swept up by that oddball's whimsical nonsense.

 
**Mash:**
Y-yes. U-um, Da Vinci! The reason why we Rayshifted here this time was not so we could go sightseeing, but...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You do know, right, Da Vinci?
 
**Da Vinci:**
Of course. There's nothing I don't know.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I'm pretty sure she knows.
 
**Da Vinci:**
I'm impressed, Fujimaru.
You're starting to get me.

 


---
 
**Da Vinci:**
Don't worry. Of course I know. I know that a small abnormality was found in this Fourth Singularity.

 
**Da Vinci:**
And I have a general idea of what it is.
Our destination is the British Museum in Regent's Park!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
A tourist destination!
 
**Mash:**
That's right, Senpai.
But the British Museum is...

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
But the British Museum is...
 
**Mash:**
Yes, Senpai...

 


---
 
**Da Vinci:**
First of all, I was the one who observed the abnormality. Well, there was also something else that bothered me.

 
**Da Vinci:**
And I wanted to see it myself, so that's why I'm accompanying you. Of course I wasn't here to sightsee.

 
**Da Vinci:**
I do not tell meaningless lies. Because such a lie would eventually point towards the truth.

 
**Da Vinci:**
That's why, whenever I make any nonsensical lies, it's to ride along with someone else's lie. Right, Romani?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Uh...um... If you say it that way, I...don't really have a response to that...

 
**Fou:**
Kyu, fooou!

 
**Da Vinci:**
Whoa. I sense some criticism coming from over there. Come on, Fou, don't suspect the pretty big sister like that.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
... (Sigh) The nerve on her to call herself
“pretty big sister” is rather impressive...

 
**Mash:**
Yes, impressive!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Impressive.
 
**Da Vinci:**
Yep, yep.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
She is the fair Mona Lisa, after all...
 
**Da Vinci:**
Hehe, that's the spirit!

 


---
 
**Da Vinci:**
This version of me is the true Mona Lisa! Accept no substitutes! That makes my smile the world's greatest smile. Right?

 
**Fou:**
Fou, kyuu...

 
**Da Vinci:**
Though to be honest... Yeah, I'm in no mood to smile right now.

 
**Da Vinci:**
If only we were at least near Westminster, we could have swung by the National Gallery.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
National Gallery?

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Isn't that...um...
 


---
 
**Mash:**
Senpai, I believe it's an art museum in Trafalgar Square.

 
**Da Vinci:**
Correct. It seems some of my work is displayed there. And there's also a piece of work that I was the inspiration for.

 
**Fou:**
Fou, fooou.

 
**Mash:**
...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Mash?

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
You seem dazed. Everything all right?
 


---
 
**Mash:**
Oh...my apologies, Master.
I was just thinking about what Da Vinci meant.

 
**Mash:**
Things that she directly worked on or things that she was the inspiration for remain years after...

 
**Mash:**
To have your work preserved in museums, and have it receive praise and admiration from those who see it...

 
**Mash:**
I assume many people have seen it and been affected by it...

 
**Mash:**
...I just thought that must be a very wonderful thing.

 
**Fou:**
Foufou, fooou...

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Yep. It's one of the perks a cultural Servant like her can enjoy. Most heroes make a name for themselves through the legend of their battles and victories.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
But it's truly rare to leave a lasting imprint on the world through your work alone. In that sense...

 
**Dr. Roman:**
...Leonardo da Vinci has left an indelible mark on this world. She truly earned the title of “universal genius.”

 
**Dr. Roman:**
It's the absolute truth, and Da Vinci is still considered to be the personification of that genius.

 
**Da Vinci:**
Heh heh. Keep praising me, Romani. Yes, I am not only a helpful and a beautiful big sister, but I am a true genius to boot.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
The “beautiful big sister” part is a bit much. By the way, the work of yours exhibited in the National Gallery is a painting, right?

 
**Da Vinci:**
Yep. A laaarge painting.
Hehe, did you think it was some mysterious code?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
No, not really. That would have been interesting, but I only thought that for a second, okay?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
What about the piece that you were a model for?
Is that a painting too? A portrait?

 
**Fou:**
Fooou!

 
**Da Vinci:**
Wrong. Verrocchio, my mentor in painting, used me as a model to paint a legendary being.

 
**Mash:**
Legendary... What was the theme?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
What is it?

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Something that was modeled after Da Vinci...
 


---
 
**Da Vinci:**
Well, it was the archangel Raphael.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
!!

 
**Fou:**
Fooou!

 
**Mash:**
Eh...! The archangel Raphael...!?
Isn't that angel almost always depicted as male?

 
**Mash:**
The archangel Gabriel is usually the one who is frequently depicted as female.

 
**Mash:**
Oh, but wait. If the male Da Vinci was the model...

 
**Da Vinci:**
It doesn't matter which gender I was back then...

 
**Da Vinci:**
My mentor Verrocchio modeled the angel after me. Besides, it's up to the artist to decide how to depict his subject...

 
**Fou:**
Fou...

 
**Mash:**
In other words, the angel was not drawn to look like Da Vinci...

 
**Mash:**
But the angel was drawn based off of Da Vinci's way of life... Is that what you mean?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...I see.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Even so, doesn't the angel look too handsome?His soul, at least.
 


---
 
**Da Vinci:**
Hahaha. Thanks for those interesting reactions,
Fujimaru, Mash, and Romani.

 
**Da Vinci:**
Well, however I looked, I was extremely beautiful. Archangel or not, bring it on!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
When I think of Da Vinci's portait...

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I thought he looked like an old man.
 


---
 
**Da Vinci:**
Oh I see. Are you thinking of my portrait as an old man?

 
**Da Vinci:**
Well, I won't deny that.
That was, after all, how I looked at one point.

 
**Da Vinci:**
But, you know, changing one's appearance is like changing clothes.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
...You say that so casually, but I can't really imagine that.

 
**Da Vinci:**
Hehe, you think so?

 
**Mash:**
...We've managed to get to the basement.

 
**Fou:**
Fou!

 
**Mash:**
Yes, Fou. That's right. The Mage's Association hasn't been completely fixed just yet.

 
**Mash:**
Most of the British Museum itself has been restored, but this area is still the way it was before...

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Thank goodness. If the correction of the Singularity had progressed much further, we wouldn't have been able to infiltrate the place so easily.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Especially for a place so labyrinthine.
This place is the Mage's Association's ultimate secret.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
This place is like a type of armory. It stores a bunch of rare and extremely precious books.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
And yet, we got in so easily...

 
**Da Vinci:**
That's also made it easy for shady characters to sneak in. Do you feel it, Mash?

 
**Mash:**
Yes, I sense some magical energy up ahead.
Senpai, please be careful.

 
**Fou:**
Fou!

 
**Mash:**
I suspect they are spellbook-type enemies!
I thought the effects of the demonic fog were no more!?

 
**Da Vinci:**
Thick clouds of Mystics naturally lay dormant in Britain. Even without the demonic fog, if we are in the time when reality is correcting the age itself...

 
**Da Vinci:**
...the fact that there are man-eating books around isn't surprising to me at all. Here they come!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
That sounded completely crazy, but she said it like it was normal... Anyway, yeah, it's time to battle!


**--BATTLE--:**

**Mash:**
All enemies defeated.
Good work, Senpai.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You too, Mash.
 
**Mash:**
...Thank you.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Da Vinci, are you pushing yourself?
 
**Da Vinci:**
Not at all. Actually, this is fun! My job normally doesn't let me accompany you like this.

 


---
 
**Da Vinci:**
To freely walk around, huh...

 
**Da Vinci:**
Since we are shorthanded at Chaldea, it somehow became my job to build up the anti-infiltration program.

 
**Da Vinci:**
It's not a particularly taxing job, but day and night, it's just been work, work, work.

 
**Da Vinci:**
Buuut, ever since you formed a contract with me, I've been able to get involved in battle...

 
**Mash:**
Now that you mention it... It is rare for you to be with us from investigation to battle.

 
**Da Vinci:**
Right? That's why I'm really happy. I'm excited!
If it was fieldwork, it would have been even better.

 
**Mash:**
Fieldwork...?

 
**Da Vinci:**
If I'm outside, I can go all-out. Making a bonfire in a place like this is frowned upon, you know.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
(I didn't think it was true, but Leonardo really seems like she's out camping.)

 
**Da Vinci:**
I heard that, Romani.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Oh, sorry... Wait, that wasn't all bad. Was it?

 
**Fou:**
Fou...

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Anyway. So, is this labyrinth the source of London's abnormality?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Da Vinci seems to be convinced that it is, and the fact that we encountered demonic books is all the proof we need.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
But the readings on my side aren't all that clear.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
The Mage's Association bounded field that was originally there has reappeared, and it's interfering with our ability to gather information.

 
**Da Vinci:**
Who knows? Man-eating books hardly seem strange to me.

 
**Da Vinci:**
And besides, I might have made a mistake.
I was still human, after all.

 
**Mash:**
...Da Vinci...making a mistake?

 
**Fou:**
...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You're kidding.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I didn't think Da Vinci made mistakes.
 


---
 
**Da Vinci:**
Ahahaha. You saw through me. You're right.

 
**Da Vinci:**
Like you said, I probably don't make mistakes.
I'm almighty! While many desire to be so, I truly am!

 
**Da Vinci:**
That's why I'm a bit saddened.
I didn't want our reunion to be like this.

 
**Da Vinci:**
During my time, I had not a single equal.

 
**Da Vinci:**
I was a genius, after all. And not just any genius.
A universal genius.

 
**Da Vinci:**
The talents that I was born with were not limited to any single field. Painting, sculpting, architecture, carpentry, anatomy, natural science...

 
**Da Vinci:**
Ah yes, and magecraft.
All fields of human knowledge were my playground.

 
**Da Vinci:**
There was nobody who was equal to me.
Everyone trailed behind.

 
**Mash:**
...

 
**Dr. Roman:**
...Leonardo.

 
**Da Vinci:**
But still. There were a few who could match me in a handful of fields.

 
**Da Vinci:**
For example, yes... You.

 
**???:**
Guuu... Uuuuuuuuu...

 
**???:**
![berserk1](https://i.imgur.com/XAqlQYL.png)...!!!

 
**Mash:**
...Magical energy detected! From what I'm seeing, it looks like a ghost-type enemy!

 
**Da Vinci:**
Shall we do this? I came here to see you...Michelangelo.


**--BATTLE--:**

**Ghost of Michelangelo:**
![berserk1](https://i.imgur.com/XAqlQYL.png)...

 
**Ghost of Michelangelo:**
...

 
**Da Vinci:**
Goodbye, Michelangelo.

 
**Da Vinci:**
While it was only where the arts were concerned...my dear friend, you had a gift that was comparable to my own.

 
**Da Vinci:**
But I wonder. Why were you hanging around the Mage's Association library?

 
**Da Vinci:**
Or perhaps... Did the abnormality of the Singularity cause any lingering spirits lurking around the British Museum...

 
**Da Vinci:**
...to fall underground? Haha, perhaps the truth really is something silly like that.

 
**Fou:**
Fou, fou.

 
**Da Vinci:**
Either way... Michelangelo... I'm a little relieved.

 
**Da Vinci:**
I'm glad you didn't end up in the Throne as a Heroic Spirit. At least your soul should rest in peace now.

 
**Da Vinci:**
Rest in peace...the other uomo universale.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
...

 
**Mash:**
...Da Vinci...

 
**Fou:**
Fou...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Did you have a special relationship with him?

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Your lover, perhaps?
 


---
 
**Da Vinci:**
Hm? Well, it's hard to say...

 
**Da Vinci:**
He really was somebody truly special to me, but I'm not sure how I can express our relationship.

 
**Da Vinci:**
I'm a genius. He was a genius.
I'm sure you know the name Michelangelo.

 
**Mash:**
Y-yes. Michelangelo is a widely known artist, also known as a Renaissance man.

 
**Mash:**
Especially his sculpture, paintings, and designs were considered the work of a true genius.

 
**Da Vinci:**
Yep, yep. Right. I'm a big fan of his “David” as well.

 
**Da Vinci:**
...Well, yeah. I guess I did like him.
I'm not sure if you'd call it love, though.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
More than Mona Lisa?
 


---
 
**Da Vinci:**
...Well, maybe not that much.

 
**Fou:**
Fo, fou!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
That was a quick answer.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Hmmm, I pity Michelangelo. Well, I don't know what he was thinking while he was wandering around.

 
**Da Vinci:**
I died before him. Maybe it's this?
His feelings just...accumulating here...

 
**Da Vinci:**
And a lot of things happened to get them all twisted and warped. Something like that.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Y-yeah. If you're satisfied with that, then I'm fine with it too.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
The fact that you were acting different than usual...
Well, I'll just say that was my imagination.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Anyway, the minute abnormality in the Singularity seems to have stabilized now.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Okay, let's prepare to head back.
Good work everyone!

 
**Mash:**
Yes, Doctor. Good work.

 
**Da Vinci:**
Hehe. Okay Doctor.
Can you Rayshift us back without my help?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
I can. I can!
I've always done it... Wait a minute, have I done it properly!?

 
**Da Vinci:**
Usually I make adjustments in the background...
 Ahem. I'm joking. You've always done it fine.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Ah, wait. Wait, wait.
Have I never done adjustments on my own!?

 
**Da Vinci:**
Ahaha, that's fine! You're not alone!
I'm here, and so is the staff!

 
**Da Vinci:**
And of course, Fujimaru and Mash!

 
**Da Vinci:**
If I say it, there's no mistaking it!
It's lonely doing it all alone. Let's have some fun!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Uh, that's not what I mean!

 
**Fou:**
Fou, kyuuu!

 
**Da Vinci:**
...That happened a while ago.

 
**Da Vinci:**
It was sometime after fixing the Fifth or Sixth Singularity. Yeah. It was right before going to Uruk.

 
**Da Vinci:**
(Sigh) ...That brings back some memories.

 
**Da Vinci:**
That was supposed to be a lesson for you, but that message came right back to me.

 
**Da Vinci:**
Yeah...right. It hit me hard.

 
**Da Vinci:**
I can understand Michelangelo's feelings now. I see.
I can see why he would turn into a troublesome ghost.

 
**Da Vinci:**
(Sigh) It sure is painful having to continue to work even after being left all alone.


## A Gift From a Little Devil

**Narration:**
...I was there for my mother when she died.
...I suppose I should be grateful for that.

 
**Narration:**
And I am. Truly.

 
**Da Vinci:**
...That all happened a long time ago.
A VERY long time ago.

 
**Da Vinci:**
My family were notaries in the village of Vinci. Had been for generations. They were pretty well off, all things considered.

 
**Da Vinci:**
My parents were never married. My mother, Caterina, was beautiful, but she was also a peasant.

 
**Da Vinci:**
Back then, there was no way she or my father, Messer Piero, could possibly have been permitted to make their love official.

 
**Da Vinci:**
In other's eyes, she just wasn't good enough. I don't want to say it because it's too crass. But...that is essentially what people thought of their love.

 
**Da Vinci:**
Still, that didn't stop them from having a beautiful child together.

 
**Da Vinci:**
This is me, Leonardo.

 
**Da Vinci:**
And boy was I cute! I think. But according to what I've heard, and considering what I look like now, how could I not have been?

 
**Da Vinci:**
Yeah, what am I saying? Of course I was adorable.
Let's just leave it at that.

 
**Da Vinci:**
Getting back to my mother, Caterina...

 
**Da Vinci:**
...she married another man after she gave birth to me. They had many children of their own. That's all well and good.

 
**Da Vinci:**
It was certainly better than continuing in a relationship that could never lead to marriage, and she didn't have to worry about me. My grandfather and uncle on the Da Vinci side took care of me.

 
**Da Vinci:**
I grew up healthy and happy, and it wasn't long before my abundant talents started helping me accomplish amazing things...

 
**Da Vinci:**
...but I never forgot about my mother. It wasn't an obsession, really. But I thought about her often.

 
**Da Vinci:**
I think it was Botticelli who said that “enough is plenty”? It certainly sounds like something he'd say.

 
**Da Vinci:**
Anyway, when I was about forty or so, my mother fell ill. She died shortly thereafter.

 
**Da Vinci:**
I had a bit of money back then,
so I tended to her sometimes.

 
**Da Vinci:**
That is why I was able to be there when she finally slipped off. Oh, I held her funeral as well. It was a rather nice funeral, at that.

 
**Da Vinci:**
...Strangely, I can't recall whether I cried at all.
Truly.

 
**Da Vinci:**
I barely remember it at all.
Still...I think I probably did.

 
**Da Vinci:**
I was still a strapping young lad of forty back then, after all, so I must have been more sensitive.

 
**Da Vinci:**
Most importantly...

 
**Da Vinci:**
...I wasn't the universal genius back then that I am now.

 
**Holmes:**
...What's this?

 
**Holmes:**
It seems your repose last night was somewhat less than restful, [♂ Mr. /♀️ Ms.} Fujimaru.

 
**Holmes:**
Did something unusual happen once again while you were asleep?

 
**Holmes:**
My understanding is that this would hardly be the first time.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I dreamed about Da Vinci.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I guess you could say it was unusual...


---
 
**Da Vinci:**
Huh? Me? I wonder why that could have happened.

 
**Da Vinci:**
I must say, I don't recall it. Of course, there's no reason for me not to take you at your word.

 
**Da Vinci:**
It could be that our connection is much stronger now that we have a contract that allows me to accompany you in battle.

 
**Da Vinci:**
Anyway, I'm flattered! Sorta irritating that you're not able to control it, but that aside...

 
**Da Vinci:**
...we should be glad our Master is having new and interesting experiences!

 
**Da Vinci:**
So...uh, just what kind of dream are we talking here, anyway?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I think...you were talking about someone...?


---
 
**Holmes:**
Hmm. Perhaps it was something related to an experience of hers from her lifetime?

 
**Da Vinci:**
Huh, I wonder who it was.
I knew SOOO many interesting people in my lifetime!

 
**Da Vinci:**
Was it Botticelli? Mikey? Lorenzo the Magnificent?
Maybe Isabella d'Este?

 
**Holmes:**
Ah, by the look on [♂ Mr. /♀️ Ms.} Fujimaru's face, I would say it was none of those. It may not, therefore, have been someone of great historical significance.

 
**Holmes:**
A question for you: In your dream conversation, how would you describe Ms. Da Vinci's emotional state?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I think she was smiling?
 
**Holmes:**
Hmm...

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I think she was crying?
 
**Da Vinci:**
Huh?

 
**Da Vinci:**
Pffft, good one. You know I'm not really one to turn on the waterworks, right?

 


---
 
**Da Vinci:**
...Did I wake you? Or were you still up?

 
**Da Vinci:**
Either way, sorry for bothering you so late.

 
**Da Vinci:**
So, I'm pretty sure you've guessed why I'm here.

 
**Da Vinci:**
I couldn't get our conversation from earlier out of my head.

 
**Da Vinci:**
So...I'm curious who I was talking to you about...you know, in that dream you had.

 
**Da Vinci:**
First, though, I should apologize. I think I had it figured out as far as who it was once you dropped that little hint.

 
**Da Vinci:**
I just didn't want to get into it there in the Command Room with so many people around.

 
**Da Vinci:**
Even if I'm just filling in, I'm still their boss. It's hard to talk about sentimental stuff around them.

 
**Da Vinci:**
...Holmes? Well, you know him. I'm sure he's got this whole thing figured out already.

 
**Da Vinci:**
Anyway! Like I said,
I'm pretty sure I know who it was.

 
**Da Vinci:**
I was talking about my mother, right?

 
**Da Vinci:**
...Caterina of Vinci village.
My beautiful mother.

 
**Da Vinci:**
She never did get a chance to raise me,
but she still brought me into this world.

 
**Da Vinci:**
She's the woman who gave me life.
I loved her so much, and I'm sure she loved me too.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Your mother...
 
**Da Vinci:**
Yup.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Did she look like you do now?
 
**Da Vinci:**
Hehe. Who knows?
Though I AM pretty sure she had a lovely smile.

 


---
 
**Da Vinci:**
Things were...complicated. She was my mother,
yes, but she could never marry my father.

 
**Da Vinci:**
Maybe I've already told you about this within that dream, so I'll be brief...

 
**Da Vinci:**
...
...

 
**Da Vinci:**
...I spent the last years of my mother's life with her in Milan.

 
**Da Vinci:**
I was doing pretty well for myself back then, so I took steps to bring my birth mother to live with me.

 
**Da Vinci:**
Not long after, she got so sick she collapsed. I remember going a little out of my mind, not knowing what to do...

 
**Da Vinci:**
Looking back, I realize I may have foolishly been responsible for shortening her life.

 
**Da Vinci:**
It'd be a lie to say I didn't regret that,
but still...

 
**Da Vinci:**
...I wouldn't trade those two years in Milan with her for anything.

 
**Da Vinci:**

**Da Vinci:**
How familiar are you with my paintings?
Ever heard of one I did called “Virgin of the Rocks”?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Not really, sorry...
 
**Da Vinci:**
It's one of my better ones. I'll show you sometime...

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Is it displayed in London, or Paris?
 
**Da Vinci:**
Both. Although, my apprentice did one of them...I think? I'm not sure.

 


---
 
**Da Vinci:**
I painted it in Milan, a few years before I had my mother come live with me. I'm pretty happy with how it turned out...

 
**Da Vinci:**
...but I also went waaay past the deadline on it. Things happened, you know? And I ended up delayed so long all you could do was laugh!

 
**Da Vinci:**
Hm? That's no laughing matter?
Well, yeah, you're right. It's not.

 
**Da Vinci:**
Boy was the priest who commissioned it pissed! Then again, I was pretty pissed too once I saw what he wanted to pay me for it!

 
**Da Vinci:**
...
...

 
**Da Vinci:**
...As the name suggests, it's a painting of the Virgin Mary, the Madonna, sitting among some rocks.

 
**Da Vinci:**
I think...when I was making it, I must have been longing for some maternal presence myself.

 
**Da Vinci:**
That's how it seems to me now, anyway,
with the benefit of hindsight and all.

 
**Da Vinci:**
While I was painting the Madonna, I started to miss my own mother, so much so that I ended up having her move out to Milan to live with me.

 
**Da Vinci:**
I'm sure you've heard the saying,
“No use crying over spilled milk”?

 
**Da Vinci:**
Me, I've always had a different take on it: “You can't put spilled water back in the pot.” I think that's about the perfect summary of human life.

 
**Da Vinci:**
...Although, if I'm being really honest...I think I might like the way Sun Tzu put it the best:

 
**Da Vinci:**
Thus, though we have heard of stupid haste in war, cleverness has never been seen associated with long delays.

 
**Holmes:**
Thus, prompted by [♂ Mr. /♀️ Ms.} Fujimaru's dream...

 
**Holmes:**
...the Heroic Spirit Leonardo da Vinci has a premonition, and decides she would like to take some manner of action...

 
**Holmes:**
...just as she did when she brought her mother to live with her. Do I have that right?

 
**Da Vinci:**
How long have you been there...?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Now I get it.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Is Holmes right?


---
 
**Da Vinci:**
I hate to admit it, but I suppose he is. I DO want to take action here, just like I did with my mother.

 
**Da Vinci:**
And if I'm going to do that,
I'll need your help, just like last time.

 
**Holmes:**
Last time?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You mean, with Michelangelo...?


---
 
**Da Vinci:**
I'm so glad you remembered! Yup, exactly like that.
I suppose I'm being a bit nostalgic again...

 
**Mash:**
Coordinates set for Europe,
on the outskirts of Milan, 1524.

 
**Mash:**
This appears to be a minute Singularity, most likely caused by a small Holy Grail or a Grail fragment.

 
**Mash:**
...It's just as you said, Da Vinci.

 
**Mash:**
I can't believe you called it so accurately before the Command Room could observe it with Sheba...

 
**Holmes:**
I thought this might be a good time to try my hand at Freudian dream interpretation, but it seems that won't be necessary here.

 
**Holmes:**
Most impressive, Da Vinci.
Just the sort of thing I would expect from you.

 
**Holmes:**
Though I suppose something of that ease may be owed to the...precision of Master's dream.

 
**Mash:**
Commencing Rayshift.
Please be careful out there, Senpai!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
See you later!


---
 
**Da Vinci:**
Ahh, this is a sight for sore eyes!
I haven't seen the Duchy of Milan like this in ages!

 
**Fou:**
Fou fou, pastafooou!

 
**Da Vinci:**
Oh, Fou. You snuck along too?
Are you sure you wouldn't rather be with Mash?

 
**Fou:**
Fou. Fou.

 
**Da Vinci:**
I see, I see. So you like beautiful women, do you?
As it happens, I do too! What good taste you have.

 
**Mash:**
Rayshift successful. Readings show you should be in the eastern part of Milan.

 
**Da Vinci:**
Good. I must admit, though, that this is a different time period than when I lived here, so I don't know the place so well as it is now.

 
**Da Vinci:**
It was pretty peaceful back then,
but France and Venice always loomed large as threats.

 
**Da Vinci:**
As much as people went about their lives quietly,
there was a certain tension in the air.

 
**Da Vinci:**
I remember the local hotshot, Il Moro, took a liking to me. I used to play the lira for him...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Lyre? As in the instrument?
 
**Da Vinci:**
Sure is.

 
**Fou:**
Fou fou?

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
So you're a musical genius too...
 
**Da Vinci:**
Have I not mentioned that?
My talents were never confined to a single field.

 
**Da Vinci:**
To name a few, there's painting, sculpture, architecture, weaponry, woodworking, autopsies, natural science...and of course, music.

 


---
 
**Da Vinci:**
All right then, let's just go for a walk and see where we&ndash;

 
**Da Vinci:**
Well, never mind that. Looks like we Rayshifted to just about exactly where we need to be.

 
**Da Vinci:**
There they are, plain as the nose on your face.
They could've at least waited till nightfall.

 
**Da Vinci:**
See?

 
**Fou:**
Faaau! Fau, kyaaau!

 
**Mash:**
Hostiles detected! A lot of them!
It looks like they have the Holy Grail with them!

 
**Da Vinci:**
All right, let's get this show on the road, shall we? I am, of course, a combat genius too, so just sit back and let Da Vinci handle this!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Initiating battle!

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Let's see what you've got!


---
 
**Mash:**
...Here they come!

 
**Da Vinci:**
Just look at all these demons.
Man, they couldn't be more obvious if they tried.


**--BATTLE--:**

**Da Vinci:**
That takes care of them, but...

 
**Fou:**
Fou? Fou, fou fou.

 
**Da Vinci:**
That's right. It's not over yet.
Still more of them here.

 
**Da Vinci:**
The BBEG in particular. I can tell it's not a Servant,
but it's still got a lot of magical energy.

 
**Da Vinci:**
It must have absorbed the Holy Grail fragment to get its magical energy levels up THIS high.

 
**Mash:**
You're right, Da Vinci! I can see those exceptional magical energy readings from here, too!

 
**Mash:**
It must possess a small Holy Grail,
or a fragment of a larger one.

 
**Da Vinci:**
I figured, yeah.
And don't you just look the part.

 
**Da Vinci:**
Hey there, Salaì...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Salaì?


---
 
**Holmes:**
Gian Giacomo Caprotti. While she lived, Da Vinci took him under her wing when he was still a young boy.

 
**Holmes:**
He became Da Vinci's apprentice in Milan in 1490,
where they grew as close as family.

 
**Mash:**
Family...

 
**Holmes:**
Now I see. Since he died in 1524, this minute Singularity must have occurred when the small Holy Grail turned him into a ghost.

 
**Holmes:**
It would seem you were right on the mark, Ms. Da Vinci.

 
**Da Vinci:**
The Salaì I knew already had a fragment, so I figured he must have been the one affecting Master's dreams.

 
**Da Vinci:**
I had a hunch, really,
and it turned out to be dead-on.

 
**Da Vinci:**
Though I wish it wasn't...

 
**Da Vinci:**
You're the only person I ever knew who would think to pester me like this, Salaì.

 
**Da Vinci:**
Still...
Why is it a ghost this time around too?

 
**Da Vinci:**
Ah, well. I guess you never did get to a point where you'd be enshrined in the Throne.

 
**Da Vinci:**
Besides, if you were, I'm pretty sure all your bad habits would put you preeetty firmly on the Anti-Hero end of things anyway.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Was he really THAT bad?

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
He was just a kid, right?


---
 
**Da Vinci:**
He was a beautiful kid. Adorable, even!

 
**Da Vinci:**
Oh, I loved his curly hair. He may not have quite been at my level, but he was still as lovely as an angel.

 
**Fou:**
Fou fou, Da Fooou...

 
**Mash:**
(She's leading off by extolling the virtues of pretty boys! Th-that's our Da Vinci, I guess...)

 
**Da Vinci:**
Buuut, he was a freakin' brat, too. He was easily four times as mischievous as the average person.

 
**Da Vinci:**
He used to sell my shoes just to buy candy...steal my silver brushes...

 
**Da Vinci:**
Hell, he'd steal anything that wasn't nailed down, really... Broke my pots while we ate...

 
**Da Vinci:**
...Ugh, just thinking about it pisses me off.

 
**Da Vinci:**
Salaì, I gotta say...

 
**Da Vinci:**
...a brat like you appearing before the maestro as a wandering ghost, just like what happened with Michelangelo...

 
**Da Vinci:**
...ticks me off even more than I thought it would!

 
**Da Vinci:**
Shut your damn hole!


**--BATTLE--:**

**Mash:**
...Hostiles eliminated. Automatically collecting Holy Grail fragments per the usual protocol.

 
**Fou:**
Fooou...

 
**Da Vinci:**
Annnd collected.
That takes care of that.

 
**Da Vinci:**
(Sigh) Dammit, Salaì...
I heard you died five years after I did.

 
**Da Vinci:**
Why'd you have to go and do that while you were still so young? What a damned waste.

 
**Da Vinci:**
Even if it was just bad luck that led you to the Holy Grail and turned you into a ghost...

 
**Da Vinci:**
...you have no business dying while you're so young.

 
**Da Vinci:**
...You really were nothing but a pain in the ass till the end, weren't you?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Da Vinci...

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
You probably wanted to have a real talk with him, huh?


---
 
**Da Vinci:**
Hmm, I don't know about that. Sure, he ended up an evil, rampaging ghost...but I think that suited him, in an odd sort of way.

 
**Da Vinci:**
What better way for a hellion like him to cause as much trouble as he wants, after all.

 
**Da Vinci:**
In that sense, we were lucky to meet him like this.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...


---
 
**Da Vinci:**
Hey, now! No getting all gloomy on me!
If Da Vinci says it's okay, then it's okay!

 
**Da Vinci:**
I do like that sensitive side of yours, though.
I hope that's something you can hold on to. Always.

 
**Fou:**
Fou, fooou!

 
**Da Vinci:**
All right then!
What do you say we get ourselves back to Chaldea!

 
**Da Vinci:**
I'm sure you'll sleep soundly tonight, Master.
Any dreams you may have will surely be sweet.


**--SECTION BREAK--:**
 
**Narration:**
...Hey, Maestro?

 
**Narration:**
...I don't get it.

 
**Narration:**
...You held a proper funeral for your mother, right?
So why aren't you doing anything this time around?

 
**Narration:**
...Ahahaha. Oh, Maestro.

 
**Narration:**
...This is why you still have all those regrets, you big dummy!

 
**Da Vinci:**
Yup. I get the feeling that's what Salaì was telling me.

 
**Da Vinci:**
I know he wasn't ACTUALLY saying anything,
of course. But that's still the impression I got.

 
**Da Vinci:**
This wasn't a prediction or anything like that.
Just a feeling.

 
**Da Vinci:**
...I swear.

 
**Da Vinci:**
That little imp never did have any problem saying the sort of things no one else would dare to.

 
**Da Vinci:**
But you know, Salaì...even if I couldn't give you a proper funeral, I still feel like I gave you a proper send-off.

 
**Da Vinci:**
Even if I'm the only one who feels that way.

 
**Da Vinci:**
All right...guess I'd better start getting things ready.

 
**Da Vinci:**
Well, getting my spare ready, really.

 
**Da Vinci:**
No telling when my number could be up,
so I've got to be sure I'm ready for anything.

 
**Da Vinci:**
That's probably part of the reason why Salaì showed up now. Demons have long been harbingers of death.

 
**Da Vinci:**
...
...

 
**Da Vinci:**
...While I'm at it, you know what,
I think I'll model it after my childhood appearance.

 
**Da Vinci:**
Holmes probably already has an idea of what I'm up to...but I don't see him having an issue.

 
**Da Vinci:**
He may always play it pretty close to the chest, but he had my back again with this, and he kept his mouth shut when he should have.

 
**Da Vinci:**
...I wonder what you'd think about this plan if you were here.

 
**Da Vinci:**
You'd probably have a big problem with it, wouldn't you? Well, sorry. I've just got to go through with it.

 
**Da Vinci:**
Lady Luck has been awfully kind to me in this life and in the last.

 
**Da Vinci:**
So to make up for that...even if my next death does turn out to suck pretty badly...

 
**Da Vinci:**
...I think...

 
**D：Da Vinci:**
...I'll just have to roll with it.
