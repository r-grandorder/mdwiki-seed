# Ivan the Terrible
 
## Ah...The Ivan the Terrible Murasaki Shikibu...
 
**Narration:**
Ahh, my poor body.
Ahh, my poor mind.

 
**Narration:**
What could have happened to transform me so grotesquely?

 
**Narration:**
I may have been known as “terrible” in my time, but I never imagined I would actually become so literally.

 
**Narration:**
Ahh, and yet, my soul stirs with the desire to serve all of humanity.

 
**Narration:**
It seems I must ask my faithful underling...

 
**Narration:**
Or rather, my beloved Master, about this change in my circumstances.

 
**Ivan the Terrible:**
Why am I an elephant?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You're just bringing this up now!?


---
 
**Mash:**
......

 
**Mash:**
Oh, I'm sorry! I was just so taken aback that I was genuinely at a loss for words.

 
**Mash:**
I'm sorry, Ivan. Um, is it okay if I call you Ivan?

 
**Ivan the Terrible:**
Indeed, it is. I see no need for formalities here.

 
**Ivan the Terrible:**
Still, I have thought my body seemed strangely heavy for a while now... And I also thought my tusks were getting a little long in the tooth. Literally.

 
**Ivan the Terrible:**
At any rate, the question remains.
Why am I an elephant?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
It's a long story.


---
 
**Mash:**
Yes. A very, very long story...

 
**Ivan the Terrible:**
No matter. Start at the beginning.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Okay then...


---
 
**Ivan the Terrible:**
Hmm, I see. So I was fused with Demonic Beasts...

 
**Ivan the Terrible:**
Now I understand.
That must have been a most trying time for both of you.

 
**Mash:**
Yes, it was...

 
**Ivan the Terrible:**
I will not ask that you forget what happened.
But I will tell you not to let it hold you back.

 
**Ivan the Terrible:**
After all, your battle is far from over.

 
**Ivan the Terrible:**
All that aside, it sounds as though my archive did not exist in this Lostbelt place.

 
**Mash:**
Archive? Do you mean your legendary library?

 
**Ivan the Terrible:**
Indeed, I do.

 
**Ivan the Terrible:**
It contained all manner of books from throughout history and the world, including a number of grimoires. It was a tremendous cultural achievement, and my pride and joy.

 
**Ivan the Terrible:**
Unfortunately, it was burned to the ground after my death, and any books that remained were scattered far and wide.

 
**Mash:**
So it would seem. We don't have any records on your library in our database, either.

 
**Mash:**
All it says is that mages have been trying to find it for a very long time.

 
**Ivan the Terrible:**
They must have been searching for my grimoires and their accompanying instruments. I did gather quite a lot of them, after all.

 
**Mash:**
It looks like there was even one family who kept searching for a particular book across three generations with only the barest of leads to go on...

 
**Ivan the Terrible:**
Hmm. Speaking of books...

 
**Ivan the Terrible:**
While I am certainly glad that Chaldea's database has managed to preserve some books in digital form...

 
**Ivan the Terrible:**
...it seems I will not get the chance to turn the pages of a paper book again, at least not while the world is in its present state.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Don't be so sure.


---
 
**Ivan the Terrible:**
What do you mean?

 
**Mash:**
I know!

 
**Mash:**
As a matter of fact, Novum Chaldea now has its very own library, underneath the first floor.

 
**Ivan the Terrible:**
Does it now?

 
**Mash:**
If you're interested, I'd be glad to show you the way.

 
**Ivan the Terrible:**
Yes, please do.

 
**Murasaki Shikibu:**
(Ahh, another peaceful day in the library.)

 
**Murasaki Shikibu:**
(It has just the right amount of people;
not too many, and not too few.)

 
**Murasaki Shikibu:**
(It may no longer be as popular as it was when it was the hot new thing, but there remains a steady crowd of booklovers who visit regularly.)

 
**Murasaki Shikibu:**
(Not only that, today, I get to read a brand-new work from the great William Shakespeare...)

 
**Murasaki Shikibu:**
(...all while enjoying a plate of Japanese sweets Lady Tomoe Gozen made to practice her baking.)

 
**Murasaki Shikibu:**
(This is truly shaping up to be a perfect afternoon...)

 
**Murasaki Shikibu:**
(Hmm, interesting...)

 
**Murasaki Shikibu:**
(Oh my! What a shocking development!)

 
**Murasaki Shikibu:**
(I can't believe he brought in a guest character from Macbeth!)

 
**Murasaki Shikibu:**
(Ahh, I can scarcely wait to turn the next page and see how it ends.)

 
**Murasaki Shikibu:**
(And yet, at the same time, I can't help but wish it would never end...)

 
**Murasaki Shikibu:**
(But then, I suppose those two conflicting emotions are the mark of any good book...)

 
**Murasaki Shikibu:**
...Oh my. Are those...footsteps?

 
**Ivan the Terrible:**
It's me. Umu.

 
**Ivan the Terrible:**
...I mean, it is I.

 
**Murasaki Shikibu:**
Eep! Lord Ivan the Terrible!

 
**Ivan the Terrible:**
I have just learned of this underground library's existence and have come to pay it a quiet, unofficial visit.

 
**Ivan the Terrible:**
Feel free to continue reading your book.
I will find my own way around.

 
**Murasaki Shikibu:**
O-oh no, I couldn't.

 
**Murasaki Shikibu:**
As Chaldea's librarian, I have a duty to give new visitors a proper tour.

 
**Ivan the Terrible:**
Is that so? Very well then, lead the way.

 
**Murasaki Shikibu:**
Of course. Please, follow me.

 
**Mash:**
(...Peek)

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
That sweet bean jelly looks reeeally good...


---
 
**Fou:**
Fou...

 
**Mash:**
Please try to focus on the matter at hand, Senpai!

 
**Murasaki Shikibu:**
And that, with the exception of the storeroom, is the library.

 
**Ivan the Terrible:**
I see...

 
**Murasaki Shikibu:**
Hm?

 
**Murasaki Shikibu:**
Is there something not to your satisfaction?

 
**Ivan the Terrible:**
Oh, I was just thinking how about how much this library's contents differ from my archive.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Does that mean you found it disappointing?


---
 
**Ivan the Terrible:**
No, it is not that.

 
**Ivan the Terrible:**
Most of the books I collected were ancient philosophical texts, grimoires, and treatises on various subjects.

 
**Ivan the Terrible:**
I had always meant to translate them into my mother tongue so that I could gain even greater wisdom, but it seems such books are few and far between here.

 
**Murasaki Shikibu:**
True, not many patrons check out philosophy books or treatises, so we usually keep them in the archive.

 
**Murasaki Shikibu:**
And as a rule, books in the archive are only meant to be read there and may not be checked out.

 
**Murasaki Shikibu:**
Also, unfortunately...I'm afraid we have very little in the way of grimoires or books on magecraft.

 
**Murasaki Shikibu:**
I'm so sorry. I know almost nothing about Western magecraft or sorcery, so...

 
**Ivan the Terrible:**
All that aside, it seems to me that this library still has room for further expansion.

 
**Murasaki Shikibu:**
Hm?

 
**Murasaki Shikibu:**
Well, yes, this space was all constructed using magecraft, so there is still plenty of room left to expand...

 
**Ivan the Terrible:**
Very good.

 
**Ivan the Terrible:**
Master, I have made up my mind.

 
**Ivan the Terrible:**
I am going to gather more books with which to further expand this library, and you are going to help me.

 
**Murasaki Shikibu:**
!!!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
More books...?


---
 
**Ivan the Terrible:**
Indeed.

 
**Ivan the Terrible:**
This library holds great potential.

 
**Ivan the Terrible:**
It deserves to be a singular collection with collections and rare books from every corner of the globe; one that is at least every bit the equal of my archive.

 
**Murasaki Shikibu:**
O-oh my! That would be absolutely wonderful,
but I'm afraid that, well...

 
**Mash:**
Yes. I'm sorry to have to tell you this,
Ivan, as it really is a lovely idea...

 
**Mash:**
...but we're just not allowed to bring back books or other important objects from Rayshifts.

 
**Mash:**
That goes double for especially rare and notable books and grimoires.

 
**Ivan the Terrible:**
True. However, I have an idea how to get around that.

 
**Ivan the Terrible:**
Surely it cannot take much data to digitize a book.

 
**Ivan the Terrible:**
Therefore, we should be able to bring back any books we find in digital form, then simply recreate them as physical copies.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Isn't that counterfeiting!?


---
 
**Ivan the Terrible:**
Hmm... Yes, I suppose it might be. However, humanity itself is currently on the verge of annihilation.

 
**Ivan the Terrible:**
Thus, as lovers of the written word, it is our right&ndash;
nay, our duty, to gather as many books as we can.

 
**Murasaki Shikibu:**
...!

 
**E：???:**
Hahaha! I like the way you think, Ivan the Terrible!

 
**Ivan the Terrible:**
Hm? That voice...

 
**Iskandar:**
I see, I see.

 
**Iskandar:**
You and I may not share a direct connection...

 
**Iskandar:**
But as an avid reader who once made the Library of Alexandria a household name around the world, I just couldn't stay away from an endeavor such as this.

 
**Ivan the Terrible:**
I see...

 
**Ivan the Terrible:**
Does this mean you too will help me to expand this library, Iskandar, descendant of the great Zeus?

 
**Iskandar:**
You need even ask?

 
**Iskandar:**
My chariot can take us anywhere we wish to go in a single leap.

 
**Iskandar:**
Of course, preserving books as data instead of just taking them by force isn't nearly as exciting from a conqueror's perspective.

 
**Iskandar:**
But, circumstances being what they are,
I suppose I can't complain.

 
**Murasaki Shikibu:**
...
...

 
**Murasaki Shikibu:**
(Oh gosh, oh gosh, oh gosh. This is all becoming a far greater ordeal than I had expected!)

 
**Murasaki Shikibu:**
(Which isn't to say I wouldn't also love to grow my library further, because I absolutely would, but still...!)

 
**Murasaki Shikibu:**
(Oh gosh, oh gosh...)

 
**Iskandar:**
Well then, shall we?

 
**Ivan the Terrible:**
Indeed, we shall.

 
**Mash:**
It looks like there's no turning back now, Murasaki Shikibu.

 
**Murasaki Shikibu:**
So it would seem...

 
**Ivan the Terrible:**
By the way, Murasaki Shikibu, does this library have a proper name?

 
**Murasaki Shikibu:**
Huh!?

 
**Murasaki Shikibu:**
Y-yes. It's known as the underground library...

 
**Ivan the Terrible:**
I see. Such modesty may be common among dignitaries in the Far East where you come from...

 
**Ivan the Terrible:**
...but if we are to collect books from all across the world here, a name as pedestrian as “underground library” will never do.

 
**Iskandar:**
I see, I see.

 
**Iskandar:**
After all, this place is about to become a second Library of Alexandria!

 
**Iskandar:**
In fact, now that I mention it...

 
**Iskandar:**
I see now that this library's new name will have to include “Great Library of Alexandria”!

 
**Murasaki Shikibu:**
I-I suppose you're right!

 
**Ivan the Terrible:**
Very well then, I shall try my hand at naming it.

 
**Ivan the Terrible:**
“The Ivan the Terrible Great Library of Alexandria”...
Hmm. I like the sound of that.

 
**Iskandar:**
Agreed. But I'm afraid there's still a crucial name missing.

 
**Murasaki Shikibu:**
Huh?
(I've got a terrible feeling about this.)

 
**Ivan the Terrible:**
Heh. Not to worry. I have of course already thought of that.

 
**Ivan the Terrible:**
It is only proper that the rightful owner's name also be included.

 
**Ivan the Terrible:**
Therefore, this library shall henceforth be known as...

 
**Ivan the Terrible:**
“The Ivan the Terrible Murasaki Shikibu the Beautiful  Great Library of Alexandria”!

 
**Ivan the Terrible:**
Done and done!!!

 
**Murasaki Shikibu:**
...
...

 
**Murasaki Shikibu:**
(Out cold)

 
**Mash:**
M-Murasaki! Speak to us, Murasaki!

 
**Ivan the Terrible:**
It is unfortunate that Murasaki Shikibu could not be here with us due to her suddenly and inexplicably feeling unwell...

 
**Iskandar:**
Ah, don't worry! She'll be overjoyed to see our triumphant return with so many books and so much data that she'll be back to her old self in no time!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
(I've gotta figure out a way to change that name,or she might never recover!)


---
 
**F：Mash:**
This is Mash Kyrielight,
handling the comms for this Rayshift.

 
**F：Mash:**
We set your first destination as London in the hope that you would be able to find plenty of rare books here.

 
**Ivan the Terrible:**
Hm?

 
**Iskandar:**
Oh?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
There's a lot of pressure in the air here...


---
 
**F：Mash:**
Yes, there is. I can see it on my monitor here as well.

 
**F：Mash:**
I'm afraid you'll just have to manage it as best you can, Master.

 
**F：Mash:**
By the way, Ivan and Iskandar, I managed to uncover some data from nineteenth century London.

 
**F：Mash:**
There's an old bookstore not too far from your current position that should have rare books in stock.

 
**Iskandar:**
Then let's get plundering!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Too far. Dial it back a notch.


---
 
**F：Mash:**
P-plundering!? I-I really can't endorse that...

 
**Ivan the Terrible:**
They are right, Great King.
Plundering is solely a last resort.

 
**Ivan the Terrible:**
In times of peace, it is only right that books be obtained with money rather than force.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Only problem is, we don't have any money...
 
**Ivan the Terrible:**
...
...

 
**Ivan the Terrible:**
Plundering it is.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I'm guessing nobody's working there right now...
 
**Ivan the Terrible:**
...
...

 
**Ivan the Terrible:**
I suppose we have no other choice then.

 
**F：Mash:**
(He gave up on that awfully quickly...)

 


---
 
**Ghost:**
Welcome.

 
**Ivan & Iskandar:**
Let's kill it.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Dial it back! Dial it back!


---
 
**F：Mash:**
Strongly seconded!

 
**F：Mash:**
It hasn't shown any signs of hostility so far!
Please, let's just hear it out!

 
**Ivan the Terrible:**
...Very well, Mash. If you insist.

 
**Ivan the Terrible:**
Go on, Master.
I grant you permission to begin negotiations.

 
**Iskandar:**
Haha, sorry about that.
Old plundering habits die hard for men like us!

 
**Ghost:**
Welcome. Anything I can help you find today?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Yeah, we're actually looking for rare books.


---
 
**Ghost:**
Right this way then.
Just a moment.

 
**Ivan the Terrible:**
Oho. Well now.

 
**Ivan the Terrible:**
I am greatly surprised to see a complete copy of the original Gutenberg Bible in a shop such as this.

 
**Iskandar:**
Well, well. A new translation of “The Iliad,” huh.

 
**Iskandar:**
Hmm... I've only read a few pages here and there so far, but this seems to be quite an interesting version.

 
**Iskandar:**
Let's get this one too, Master.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Excuse me...


---
 
**Ghost:**
Yes?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
We were actually hoping to, uh,copy these books instead of buying them...


---
 
**Ghost:**
Hmm. I have no clue what you are talking about,
but I understand the situation.

 
**Ivan the Terrible:**
How does that work?

 
**Ghost:**
Though I must say, I cannot imagine these copies will have anything to equal the love that went into making the originals.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I get that, but still...


---
 
**Ghost:**
So here's an idea.
You and I fight each other in mortal combat.

 
**Ghost:**
If you win, I will allow you to copy the books' data.

 
**Iskandar:**
Plundering it is.

 
**Ivan the Terrible:**
That it is.

 
**F：Mash:**
(Is it just me, or do they both seem much more animated now?)

 
**Ghost:**
I have been reading these books for over two hundred years, long after I became nothing but skin and bones, and eventually dust.

 
**Ghost:**
I have read grimoires and rare books of every conceivable shape, size, and color. I've even read books that move about on their own.

 
**Ghost:**
If you want to create an unauthorized digital facsimile my collection, then do your worst!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
How do you even know what all that is!?


---
 
**Ghost:**
I've always been on top of the latest trends.
Now come, let's take this outside.

 
**Ghost:**
After all, I'd die if anything were to happen to my books.

 
**--BATTLE--:**
 
**Ivan the Terrible:**
Hrn!

 
**Ghost:**
Bwaaa!

 
**F：Mash:**
The ghost who may just love books more than anyone else in human history has been defeated!

 
**Ivan the Terrible:**
Quite. I am most impressed at the power your soul possesses entirely as a result of your bibliophilia.

 
**Ivan the Terrible:**
Nonetheless, I assume our victory means you no longer have an issue with our plundering&ndash;that is, our digitizing your books?

 
**Ghost:**
Yes, I no longer have any issue with that.

 
**Ghost:**
But I'm afraid that still leaves two other matters that need to be resolved.

 
**Iskandar:**
Oh? And what might those be?

 
**Ghost:**
First off: payment.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Yeah... Should've seen that coming.


---
 
**Ivan the Terrible:**
We would never need concern ourselves with payment if we had simply plundered the books to begin with...

 
**Ivan the Terrible:**
But if this is your wish, Master, then so be it.
I shall cover the charge myself.

 
**Ghost:**
Finally, there's one last important thing I must tell you.

 
**Ivan the Terrible:**
Oh?

 
**Iskandar:**
What is it?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Uh... Why do you keep scooting away?


---
 
**Ghost:**
Yes, well, while I am obviously haunting this bookstore...

 
**Ghost:**
...I only do so because I was a very devoted customer.
I don't actually own it.

 
**Ghost:**
Still, as I love books more than anything, I felt an obligation to do my best to protect them.

 
**Ghost:**
Which is why I'm going to use this money to open up my very own bookstore!

 
**Ivan the Terrible:**
...
...

 
**Iskandar:**
...
...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
...
 


---
 
**All:**
Get back heeere!!!

 
**Iskandar:**
Well, that turned out to be quite the fine mess.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I still can't believe we ended up having to fight it again...


---
 
**Ivan the Terrible:**
Quite. I never thought a devoted bibliophile would exploit their bibliophilia for such blatant fraud and deception.

 
**Ivan the Terrible:**
And that half-hearted devotion makes it that much more difficult to deal with.

 
**Ivan the Terrible:**
It has been a long time since I so fervently wished to sit someone atop a keg filled with gunpowder and set it alight.

 
**Helena:**
Excuse me, coming through...

 
**Helena:**
...Um, coming through?

 
**Helena:**
Excuse me! I said, coming through!

 
**Helena:**
Move over already!

 
**Ivan the Terrible:**
Ah, I beg your pardon.

 
**Helena:**
Ugh.

 
**Helena:**
I swear, you guys need to be way more aware of how much space you take up. Especially in the hallway.

 
**Iskandar:**
Hahaha, I haven't had a talking-to like that since I was a boy.

 
**Ivan the Terrible:**
Quite.

 
**Ivan the Terrible:**
It has been a long time indeed since anyone reprimanded me.

 
**Ivan the Terrible:**
Once you become the tsar, most people do not dare to so much as raise their voice in your presence.

 
**Ivan the Terrible:**
Especially little girls like her.

 
**Spartacus:**
Oppress&ndash;I mean, excuse me, but would you mind making way?

 
**Ivan the Terrible:**
Ah, right.

 
**Spartacus:**
Hmm. I appreciate the attempt,
but it's still a tight squeeze...

 
**Spartacus:**
Hrn!

 
**Spartacus:**
Oppressors, you should refrain from standing side by side.

 
**Spartacus:**
You are both much too bulky for that.

 
**Iskandar:**
Hahaha, I don't think you're in any position to talk.

 
**Ivan the Terrible:**
......I see.

 
**Ivan the Terrible:**
I had forgotten I am an elephant now.
It is no wonder I am so big.

 
**Iskandar:**
What, you're telling me you really didn't know?

 
**Ivan the Terrible:**
Indeed, I did not.

 
**Ivan the Terrible:**
I merely happened to look in a mirror for the first time in a long time...

 
**Ivan the Terrible:**
...and thought “Oh, right. What am I now, anyway?”

 
**Iskandar:**
Hahaha, I see you're just as audacious as your body is spacious!

 
**Mash:**
I finished reproducing the books.
The copies turned out very well.

 
**Mash:**
Of course, once everything is back to normal, I'm afraid we'll have to destroy them...

 
**Iskandar:**
Why bother?
What the higher-ups don't know won't hurt them!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I see it takes audacity to know audacity...


---
 
**Mash:**
At any rate, I'm sure Murasaki will be thrilled.
Let's go bring them to her, Senpai!

 
**Ivan the Terrible:**
Oh, yes, I still need to see a sculptor about ordering a nameplate that says:

 
**Ivan the Terrible:**
“The Ivan the Terrible Murasaki Shikibu the Beautiful Great Library of Alexandria”!

 
**Ivan the Terrible:**
...Yes, this will be an excellent library indeed.

 
**Spartacus:**
Hm.

 
**Spartacus:**
You two. A word.

 
**Ivan & Iskandar:**
!!!

 
**Murasaki Shikibu:**
...
...

 
**Murasaki Shikibu:**
L-let me try saying it once again to see if I can get used to it.

 
**Murasaki Shikibu:**
“The Ivan the Terrible Murasaki Shikibu the Beautiful Great Library of Alexandria”...

 
**Murasaki Shikibu:**
...I can't! I just can't bear it!

 
**Murasaki Shikibu:**
I have to refuse their kind but misguided offer, or I'll be so embarrassed I'll collapse into a pile of ether!

 
**Murasaki Shikibu:**
It won't be easy, but at least I know that both Lord Ivan and Lord Iskandar are willing to listen to reason.

 
**Murasaki Shikibu:**
I'm sure they'll let me remove my name from the library as long as I plead my case earnestly.

 
**Murasaki Shikibu:**
I just have to do my best to not be so bowled over by their intimidating auras that I'm unable to get a word in...

 
**Murasaki Shikibu:**
(Inhale)... (Exhale)...

 
**Mash:**
Hi, Murasaki! We're back!

 
**Murasaki Shikibu:**
!

 
**Murasaki Shikibu:**
O-oh, yes. Hello, Lady Mash, Master,
Lord Ivan, and Lord Iskandar.

 
**Murasaki Shikibu:**
Welcome back.

 
**Iskandar:**
Take a look!
Our book-finding expedition was a grand success!

 
**Ivan the Terrible:**
Indeed.

 
**Ivan the Terrible:**
A single Rayshift was all it took to find satisfactory spoils.

 
**Mash:**
These are the copies we made from the data we brought back. Rare books, grimoires, limited editions, single print runs...

 
**Mash:**
So! Where would you like us to put them!?

 
**Murasaki Shikibu:**
!

 
**Murasaki Shikibu:**
O-oh my goodness. What an extraordinary selection of precious books! This is amazing...

 
**Iskandar:**
On another note, Murasaki Shikibu, Ivan and I wanted to apologize about getting carried away with the name.

 
**Ivan the Terrible:**
Indeed.

 
**Ivan the Terrible:**
Spartacus showed us the error of our ways in no uncertain terms.

 
**Ivan the Terrible:**
He told us that it was the height of both tyranny and oppression...

 
**Ivan the Terrible:**
...to adorn this library with our names when you are its rightful custodian.

 
**Murasaki Shikibu:**
Oh, yes, well...

 
**Iskandar:**
Indeed. And he was right.

 
**Iskandar:**
If this land was ours to rule, putting our names on an institution would be considered a great honor...

 
**Ivan the Terrible:**
But this is not our land, and so different considerations hold greater weight here.

 
**Ivan the Terrible:**
Indeed, Spartacus's argument was most convincing.

 
**Iskandar:**
However, all that being said...

 
**Iskandar:**
We were still hoping you wouldn't mind leaving the adjectives associated with our names in the library's name.

 
**Ivan the Terrible:**
Though of course, those adjectives suit you just as well as they do us.

 
**Murasaki Shikibu:**
...
...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
(Come on, Murasaki! Get your head out of the book clouds and listen to them!)

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
(Murasaki! I really think you're gonna want to be mentally present for this decision!)


---
 
**Iskandar:**
Which is why we have a new idea for this library's name.

 
**Ivan the Terrible:**
Indeed. One that still preserves the best aspects of our last one.

 
**Ivan the Terrible:**
“The Great and Terrible Yet Beautiful Murasaki Shikibu Library”

 
**Ivan the Terrible:**
What do you think?

 
**C：In-One-Ear-and-Out-the-Other Murasaki Shikibu:**
Sure, that's fine...
Ahh, so many precious books...

 
**Mash:**
...
...

 
**Iskandar:**
Wonderful! I'm delighted to hear it!
That just leaves the nameplate.

 
**Ivan the Terrible:**
Indeed.

 
**Ivan the Terrible:**
Worry not, Murasaki Shikibu.
I will order it straight away.

 
**Iskandar:**
Oh yes, we still need to decide whether to order its construction from gold or silver.

 
**Ivan the Terrible:**
Whichever we choose, we could also have it decorated with diamonds.

 
**Iskandar:**
Yes! I like the way you think!

 
**Murasaki Shikibu:**
(Contented sigh)...

 
**Murasaki Shikibu:**
Copies or not, I never dreamed that I would ever get my hands on such rare and precious books.

 
**Murasaki Shikibu:**
Ahh. Thank you, everyone. Thank you all so...

 
**Murasaki Shikibu:**
Huh? Where is everyone?

 
**Murasaki Shikibu:**
...
...

 
**Murasaki Shikibu:**
...(Gasp)!
O-oh no. Did I...?

 
**Mash:**
I'm sorry, Murasaki, but&ndash;

**Fujimaru 1:**
You're too late!


---
 
**Murasaki Shikibu:**
Well, in spite of everything, it's still wonderful to have so many more rare books in the library.

 
**Murasaki Shikibu:**
I'll have to write proper letters to Lord Ivan and Lord Iskandar thanking them for their trouble.

 
**Murasaki Shikibu:**
That being said...

 
**Charlotte Corday:**
I found it!

 
**Charlotte Corday:**
This must be...

 
**Charlotte Corday:**
...“The Great and Terrible Yet Beautiful Murasaki Shikibu Library” I've heard so much about!

 
**Charlotte Corday:**
The lovely nameplate makes it so very clear!

 
**Charlotte Corday:**
All right! It's time to dive into a good book!
Whichever should I read first?

 
**Murasaki Shikibu:**
That's the one part I just can't get used to!

 
**Ivan the Terrible:**
Read this treatise, and I am certain you too will understand that there are many different schools of thought.

**Fujimaru 1:**
Right...

**Ivan the Terrible:**
I am also certain the other Lostbelts you must face will vary greatly in shape and circumstance.

 
**Ivan the Terrible:**
I suspect I am only here now because I was defeated in mine.

 
**Ivan the Terrible:**
While I retain my consciousness from both the Lostbelt and Proper Human History, the reason why I chose this form over my more normal likeness from Proper Human History...

 
**Ivan the Terrible:**
...is not merely for its greater prowess in battle.

 
**Ivan the Terrible:**
I represent both victory and defeat. My role here as a Heroic Spirit is to guide you in your next steps.

 
**Ivan the Terrible:**
Remember this well, my Master.

 
**Ivan the Terrible:**
I am simultaneously one defeated, and one meant to oversee your journey.

 
**Ivan the Terrible:**
I am therefore placing all my trust in your conduct, your beliefs, your decisions...

 
**Ivan the Terrible:**
Indeed, in your very way of life.

 
**Ivan the Terrible:**
...Betrayal will not be forgiven.

 
**Ivan the Terrible:**
Not a betrayal of humanity...

 
**Ivan the Terrible:**
...but of myself, and those who watch over your journey with me.

 
**Ivan the Terrible:**
That is the sort of betrayal I will never forgive.

**Fujimaru 1:**

**Ivan the Terrible:**
Heh. Hahahaha!

 
**Ivan the Terrible:**
Did I scare you? My apologies.
It is really quite simple.

 
**Ivan the Terrible:**
All you need do is live your life as you see fit.
That is what I will place my trust in.

 
**Ivan the Terrible:**
To rule effectively, a king requires fear, the ability to reward his subjects, and exaltation from the same subjects.

 
**Ivan the Terrible:**
But to fight a king, a person needs only one thing: faith.

 
**Ivan the Terrible:**
I have never once lost faith in my decision to fight by your side.

 
**Ivan the Terrible:**
Now, let us read the next book and allow our thoughts to wander where they may.

 
**Ivan the Terrible:**
For the road ahead is still long indeed...
