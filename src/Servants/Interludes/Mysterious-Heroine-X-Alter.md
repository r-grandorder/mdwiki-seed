# Mysterious Heroine X Alter

## XXXX. Mysterious Heroines

**Heroine XX:**
It's time...for the XXth Servantverse Servant Assembly!

 
**X Alter:**
Yaaay.
(Clap, clap, clap, clap)

 
**X:**
What the hell are you talking about, you piece of junk?

 
**Heroine XX:**
...Hmph. I am not junk. I am a robot.
A killer machine that neither bleeds nor cries.

 
**Heroine XX:**
...At least for today, if you all don't mind.

 
**Narration:**
　(Cocks head to side)　　　　 　　　(Nods falteringly)

**Fujimaru 1:**
You got it.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
(Sounds like she's got her reasons.)


---
 
**X:**
Huh???

 
**X:**
Oh come on, you're obviously just disguising your voice! I can literally see you wobbling your throat with your hand to do it!

 
**X:**
There's no way a weird robot like that would exist in the Servantverse!

 
**X Alter:**
I don't have a problem with it.
We already have Professor Babbagen and Evil Wind 2B.

 
**X Alter:**
This is my room, by the way. It's got a kotatsu and everything. Hehehe. I've also got plenty of sweets to go with our tea.

 
**Heroine XX:**
(...)

 
**X:**
Oh please. As if a robot would ever want to go in a kotatsu.

 
**X:**
You're weirdly nice to the walking scrap heap, Ex...
I don't know why, but I don't like it!

 
**X Alter:**
Oh... Really?

 
**X Alter:**
She seems like a much better robot than my Black Knight Voloid. My Voloid can't even walk on two legs.

 
**X:**
I swear, just how low IS your opinion of your Voloid?

 
**X:**
And apparently, you're not even interested in trading that old bucket in for a newer model?

 
**X Alter:**
What can I say? That Black Knight and I have been through a lot together.

 
**Heroine XX:**
The Du Stallion II has seen better days, too...

 
**X:**
What was that!?

 
**X:**
Did you just throw shade at my beloved spaceship that's practically in factory new condition!?

 
**Heroine XX:**
BEEEP. That was. A memory bug. Don't worry about it.

 
**X:**
Grrr, oh forget it! I'm just gonna help myself to ALL the sweets on the kotatsu then!

 
**X Alter:**
By all means.
Go ahead, Robot, you can have some too.

 
**X Alter:**
As a Servantverse robot, you should at least be able to digest sweet beans.

 
**Heroine XX:**
...(Eyes welling up with tears)
Aw, Ex, you're the bes&ndash;(Cough, hack, cough)!

 
**Heroine XX:**
Thank you. Alter.

 
**X Alter:**
Hm? Sure, no problem.

 
**X Alter:**
Everyone else, please feel free to help yourselves to the sweets, too.

 
**X Alter:**
What would you like, Master?
I also have some piping hot green tea.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
A chestnut cake and chestnut dumpling, please.
 
**X Alter:**
You have excellent taste, Master.
Chestnuts go great with all sorts of sweets.

 
**X Alter:**
This chestnut cake not only has delicious chestnut adzuki beans, its crisp, crunchy shell is a work of art on its own.

 
**Mash:**
This chestnut jelly is really soft and scrumptious too!

 
**Mecha Eli-chan:**
...I see. I now understand everything.
Today is a day for evaluating different kinds of sweets.

 
**Mash:**
(Munch, munch) That's, um, probably not quite right.
At least, I don't think it is.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Give me everything you've got, please.
 
**X Alter:**
...Oho...
(Clatter)

 
**Mash:**
W-wait! X Alter, please put away your twin blades!

 
**Mash:**
I'm sure Senpai only meant [♂ he /♀️ she} wanted to have one of every TYPE of sweet. Right, Senpai?

 
**Mash:**
...Right?

 
**X Alter:**
Hmm...
All right, I suppose that is acceptable.

 
**X Alter:**
And I do want you to have a firm grasp on the kinds of sweets I like.

 
**Mecha Eli-chan:**
... (Venting exhaust in lieu of sighing)

 


---
 
**Mash:**
So, um... Now that we've all had some lovely tea and a chance to relax, maybe we should get down to business...?

 
**Mecha Eli-chan:**
I agree.
What is this all about?

 
**Heroine XX:**
This is the XXth Servantverse Servant Assem&ndash;

 
**Mecha Eli-chan:**
You have already said as much.
What I want to know is, who chose these members?

 
**Mecha Eli-chan:**
I can understand why my pilot candidate and Mash might be here...

 
**Mecha Eli-chan:**
...but why would you ask me to attend a “Servantverse Servant Assembly”?

 
**Mecha Eli-chan:**
As you all surely know, I am the proud steel guardian of Castle Csejte!

 
**Mecha Eli-chan:**
I want no part of any world as slapdash and ill-defined as this “Servantverse.”

 
**X:**
Huh?

 
**X:**
You come from a world with a Japanese castle stacked on a pyramid stacked on a European castle. You have a giant steel demoness robot, Elisa Particles... How is that different than the Servantverse?

 
**Mecha Eli-chan:**
Blasphemy! Now be quiet and let me speak.
Hmph...

 
**Mecha Eli-chan:**
I hope whoever invited me here didn't do so solely because I'm a robot...did they?

 
**Heroine XX:**
(Hack, cough, cough)

 
**Heroine XX:**
(There's no way I can say I just asked her to come so I'd have some extra camouflage for my cover story now!)

 
**Heroine XX:**
Uh, beep boop, of course not.

 
**Heroine XX:**
(Monotone) I invited you here as an...honorary Servantverse Servant.

 
**Mecha Eli-chan:**
Oh...

 
**X Alter:**
That's weird. I could have sworn you were a full-fledged member of the Servantverse, Mecha Eli-chan.

 
**X Alter:**
I remember the demoness of the demon castle played a huge part in the CEO of Amazones' autobiographical movie.

 
**X Alter:**
There was the scene where you went diving in the liquid hydrogen oceans on a gas giant planet... Your trip to the Bermuda Triangle...

 
**X Alter:**
Your trip to that neutron star with the ultramagnetic field that's impossible to escape... And then there was&ndash;

 
**Mecha Eli-chan:**
What... What are you talking about? I've never done anything like that in all my operational history.

 
**X Alter:**
I was also told you're exceedingly knowledgeable when it comes to Western sweets.

 
**X Alter:**
You can fight, you can sing, you can bake...
You're the perfect robot come to life.

 
**X Alter:**
They also said you make amazing Halloween-themed pies! I do know chestnuts and pumpkin are a sublime combination in sweets, so I can believe it.

 
**Mecha Eli-chan:**
I-it's really just a hobby. Anyway, I still don't fully understand, but, all right.

 
**Mecha Eli-chan:**
If this is basically just a tea party for proper ladies,
then I have no objection.

 
**Mecha Eli-chan:**
(Besides, I've been invited to oil parties courtesy of Danzo, but I've never been to a tea party before.)

 
**Mecha Eli-chan:**
Very well. An opportunity like this doesn't come around every day.

 
**Mecha Eli-chan:**
As the guardian of Csejte with an understanding of Halloween, it's my duty to allow for elegant, stylish times like&ndash;

 
**Heroine XX:**
Do you have any curry cake?
Or maybe cutlet cake?

 
**Mecha Eli-chan:**
(Twitch)

 
**Mecha Eli-chan:**
...Anyway, this is essentially a meeting, yes?
So what's our agenda for today's proceedings?

 
**Mash:**
(Mecha Eli-chan's pretty much running the show now.)

 
**X Alter:**
Hmm. I don't have any of the junky cake X likes...

 
**X Alter:**
But since it's not every day that all of us Servantverse Servants are gathered together like this, we probably should do something special...

 
**X:**
I know! We can have a one-on-one-on-one battle to see which of us is the strongest X of all!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Well someone's a little too fired up for their own good.
 
**X Alter:**
You said it. That is hardly the sort of thing to suit a meeting.

 
**Heroine XX:**
(Nodding vigorously in assent)

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I'd rather hear more about the Servantverse.
 
**Mecha Eli-chan:**
I completely agree with my pilot candidate.

 


---
 
**Mecha Eli-chan:**
Wouldn't it be much more productive to acquire verifiable intel on any possible Servantverse threats, so we can come up with appropriate means to counter them before they pose a threat?

 
**Mecha Eli-chan:**
Especially when it comes to Foreigner-class entities!

 
**Heroine XX:**
I concur! (Venting exhaust)

 
**Mash:**
Um... I don't think that's a threat we need to be overly concerned with...

 
**Mash:**
That aside, I'd love to learn more about the world all you Xs come from!

 
**Mash:**
I think you two said you were roommates there, right, X and Alter?

 
**Heroine XX:**
That is right. It really takes me back.

 
**X:**
Nobody asked you, you hunk of junk!

 
**X:**
That said, it's true that we were forced to share a dorm room back at Cosmo-Chaldea High School.

 
**X:**
Grrr, just thinking about it pisses me off all over again!

 
**X Alter:**
I didn't mind sharing a room in theory, but X was the worst possible roommate I could have imagined.

 
**X Alter:**
Now that I think about it...

 
**X Alter:**
...our teacher, Nameless Red, might have set that up to try and improve X's behavior, even just a little...

 
**X:**
Trust me, it was no picnic for me either, sister!

 
**X:**
We didn't just have to share our room. We were even forced to complete an assignment together...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
An assignment? You mean, at Cosmo-Chaldea High?


---
 
**X:**
Yup. Killing villains, basically.

 
**X:**
I'm sure it was supposed to be Nameless Red's mission, but he pawned it off on his students!

 
**X Alter:**
I think it was on Planet Totooine.
That was a seriously brutal case...

 
**Heroine XX:**
This was back in the start of season one.

 
**X Alter:**
That's right.

 
**X Alter:**
This was when our ratings were in the gutter, when viewers thought we were just another weird series.

 
**Mash:**
...Season? Ratings?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You've got to tell us more now!


---
 
**X Alter:**
Sure, no problem.
So, Planet Totooine is...

 
**Narration:**
 
　　　　　　　　　– Planet Totooine –

 
**X:**
Gaah! Ugh, blech! I'm gonna be washing sand out of everywhere for days!

 
**X:**
How the hell does a planet RAIN sand!?
Everywhere we go, it's just sand, sand, sand!

 
**X:**
What's next? Maybe a sand squall followed by a sand rainbow!?

 
**X Alter:**
A sand rainbow. What a lovely concept.
How very unrealistic, yet sublime.

 
**X Alter:**
But, unfortunately, this sandstorm is so cosmically big it's enveloping everything in Totooine's orbit.

 
**X Alter:**
Dammit... We don't have time for this.
We need to hurry!

 
**X Alter:**
Getting Du Stallion II get shot down and having to make an emergency landing on this planet was not part of the plan.

 
**X Alter:**
I guess those reports that this area was getting unruly were true.

 
**X:**
Maybe we just should've waited for Black Bucket to finish repairing the ship!?

 
**X Alter:**
First of all, he's not a black bucket.
He's my Black Knight.

 
**X Alter:**
Second, we can't wait that long.
Not with...my precious...

 
**X Alter:**
...sweet bean buns at stake!

 
**X Alter:**
I have to get to the Spacebucks that just opened on Totooine before they sell out of their special commemorative buns!

 
**X:**
Huh? Commemorative buns?
What about our mission to dispatch that villain?

 
**X Alter:**
The special Spacebucks version of Totooine's famous Zero Buns comes first.

 
**X:**
What!? You never said anything about some stupid mission like that before!

 
**X:**
...(Sigh) This explains why you were so excited about researching our destination...

 
**X:**
If only you worked half as hard to preserve peace in the Servantverse as you did on acquiring sweets...

 
**X:**
Huh!?
Ex, get down!

 
**X Alter:**
Yikes.

 
**Narration:**
...

 
**X:**
Damn, I can't believe how accurate they are! Looks like we're up against more enemies than we thought!

 
**X Alter:**
That shadow over there... Is that a sand raider?
One of Totooine's mythical desert people?

 
**X Alter:**
Now I see... So that's how it is.

 
**X Alter:**
These sand raider extremists are trying to stop Spacebucks' galactic expansion by any means necessary!

 
**X:**
Seriously!? Oh, hell no! I am NOT getting killed over freaking coffee milk!!!

 
**X:**
Good thing we can totally take these guys if we can just get in close! Let's get 'em, Ex!

 
**X Alter:**
Right. I won't let them stand in the way of peace...or of my sweet bean buns!


**--BATTLE--:**

**???:**
...

 
**???:**
These two weren't part of the plan.
Guess I've got no other choice...

 
**X Alter:**
We didn't learn this until much later...

 
**X Alter:**
...but the incident on Totooine was just the opening act of a huge conspiracy.

 
**X Alter:**
I still find it hard to believe that the legendary bounty hunter, Edgy Fett, was masterminding the whole thing...

 
**X:**
Even in my wildest dreams, I never would've thought a guy that strong would be hiding out among the sand raiders...

 
**X:**
So we ended up letting him get away, failing the assignment, and having to stay behind for special training, AGAIN!

 
**Mash:**
The legendary bounty hunter...

 
**Mecha Eli-chan:**
Edgy Fett...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Short for Edgemiya Fett...


---
 
**X Alter:**
That's right. They say he'll only work for enormous cash bounties, and that even the League of Villains fears him.

 
**X Alter:**
There are also rumors that say he's the Alter of a certain hero, and that Edgy Fett is just a codename.

 
**X:**
It still burns me that we let him get away.
If only Mr. Dual Pistols had been a Saber...

 
**X Alter:**
Anyway, our assignment might not have gone at all well...

 
**X Alter:**
...but the important thing is that I managed to get my hands on the sweet buns in the end.

 
**Mecha Eli-chan:**
I see... At first, I thought this Cosmo-Chaldea High School was a place for raising defenders of justice...

 
**Mecha Eli-chan:**
...but it's actually a charity designed to try and give completely hopeless Servants a chance to be useful somehow.

 
**X:**
Nrghhh...

 
**X:**
Y-yes, I might not have had top grades, but so what!

 
**X:**
Their methods were never a good fit for my learning style anyway!

 
**X:**
Especially when it came to those smug-ass teachers!

 
**Mecha Eli-chan:**
What a terrible tragedy for you.

 
**Mecha Eli-chan:**
So with your combined 2.0 GPA and your complete inability to work as a team, you were dispatched to different planets around the universe?

 
**X:**
That's right! Stupid Principal Lionhead made us go just to piss us off!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
What sort of planets were you two sent to?


---
 
**X Alter:**
They were all very dangerous,
but the one I'll never forget...

 
**X Alter:**
...is Planet Guntama... I could never forget it after what happened there.

 
**Mash:**
Guntama? That name sounds familiar.
Isn't that your home planet, X?

 
**X:**
Hehehe. You got it, Mash!

 
**X Alter:**
That's right. I latched on to X to mooch off her when she went back there during spring break.

 
**X:**
Not that I wanted to go back to my home planet or anything. Or for Ex to come with me in the first place.

 
**X:**
I would've muuuch rather hung out at a different planet.

 
**X Alter:**
But Guntama was the only place we were allowed to go after all the detentions we'd incurred at school.

 
**X:**
Can you believe that!?
Just thinking about it still makes me sooo angry!

 
**Heroine XX:**
Ha ha ha ha. At least you still got to go on break.

 
**Heroine XX:**
I'd say that's better than nothing.

 
**X:**
It's not funny!

 
**X:**
Because of all that, I had to bring Ex along on a trip back home I never wanted to take to begin with.


**--ARROW--:**

		– Planet Guntama –

 
**X Alter:**
Oogh... What is this strange sensation...?

 
**X Alter:**
Is this Planet Guntama undulating?
Is it some kind of curse?

 
**X Alter:**
I can't even think straight with all this watery stuff running down my skin. I feel gross.

 
**X:**
Pretty sure that's just sweat.

 
**X:**
That's the thing about Guntama: it's goddamn hot here!
We're talking Red Ring of Death hot!

 
**X:**
The humidity in this season averages five thousand percent, and that's on a good day!

 
**X:**
This is exactly why I didn't want to come home!

 
**X Alter:**
I don't think I'm going to make it, X.
It was a good life...while it lasted...

 
**X:**
Ex! Wake up!
Argh, now I have even MORE crap to carry!

 
**X:**
Why don't you just take off some clothes if you're that hot!?

 
**X:**
It's not like swimsuit Servants ever go out of style, after all!

 
**X:**
Not that you'd ever catch ME dead in a swimsuit, though! No way, no how!

 
**X:**
All that aside...

 
**X:**
Guntama was never the most happening place, but I don't remember there being absolutely no trace of civilization here...

 
**X:**
Last I checked, it at least had a breezy summer resort area going for it...

 
**X:**
What happened here while I was gone...
Huh!?

 
**Narration:**
 
Mewhehehehe...

 
**Narration:**
 
Your food, or your life...

 
**X:**
Wake up already, Ex!
We've got savages popping up every which way!

 
**X Alter:**
I'm never taking these off...
I don't want to freeze to death...


**--BATTLE--:**

**X Alter:**
Everything happened very quickly...

 
**X Alter:**
...but once we got the attackers to stop hunting our Spirit Origins, we somehow managed to reconcile with them.

 
**X Alter:**
The leopard-tiger-jaguar-panther lady would go on to become a surprisingly popular Servant later.

 
**Heroine XX:**
That was the midseason episode that was absurdly popular among children.

 
**Heroine XX:**
It led to all sorts of spin-off series that took place on the mysterious planet of Guntama.

 
**X:**
Yup! I even became pretty popular myself...
Hey! What's with all the spoilers!?

 
**Heroine XX:**
Oops.

 
**Heroine XX:**
Uh, no, it is nothing. I am just a devout fan.
I cannot help but share my wealth of trivia.

 
**X Alter:**
Makes sense.

 
**X Alter:**
You must be a huge fan of X's then.

 
**X Alter:**
Is that why you dress kind of like her?

 
**Heroine XX:**
(...Ugh. I know she's just from season one, but I still can't believe how clueless she is about a fellow X...)

 
**Heroine XX:**
Uh, yes, I think that might be the case now. Beep boop.

 
**X Alter:**
I couldn't remember much about my past before I came to the academy.

 
**X Alter:**
It wasn't until I came to Guntama that I learned these glasses were the secret key to restoring my memories.

 
**X Alter:**
It also lead directly into “The Final Battle!
Destroy the Bridge on Twin Planet Esaba”...

 
**X Alter:**
...the climactic episode of our first season.

 
**Heroine XX:**
...Huh? Esaba? Climactic episode?

 
**Heroine XX:**
(Esaba... I've never even heard of that planet before.)

 
**Mash:**
Is this Esaba another world you and X infiltrated?

 
**X Alter:**
Do sweet beans go well with buns?

 
**X Alter:**
Right around the time that episode aired, X and I were known as agents capable of single-handedly destroying entire planets in the course of our missions.

 
**X Alter:**
So when the two of us worked together, we could limit the collateral damage to a single planet.

 
**X:**
Oogh.

 
**Mecha Eli-chan:**
(Giggle) Do sweet beans go well with buns... I never would have thought to phrase a rhetorical question like that...

 
**Mecha Eli-chan:**
...Uh, a-ahem. In the future, try not to go around casually destroying planets.

 
**Mecha Eli-chan:**
Now, what happened next? I thought I heard you mention a final battle earlier?

 
**X Alter:**
Oh yes. It was a huge ordeal.
That's why it wasn't just X and me there.

 
**X Alter:**
There were also other students from the academy, and even some teachers who were also active hero Servants.

 
**X Alter:**
By that point, it was no longer just a school assignment, but an important military operation.

 
**X:**
Esaba...

 
**X:**
For some reason, just hearing that name makes my chest go tight...

 
**X Alter:**
...

 
**Heroine XX:**
...? (What's going on?)

 
**Heroine XX:**
I have no record of any such episode...
In fact, I do not even remember seeing it.

 
**X Alter:**
Oh? I guess even robots can overlook things then.

 
**X Alter:**
...Esaba is an artificial planet that is in reality two planets connected by an interstellar bridge.

 
**X Alter:**
It's home to an enormous factory that was targeted and occupied by the League of Villains.

 
**X Alter:**
The villains repurposed the factory's incredible technology to create a huge army of military robots.

 
**X Alter:**
While the individual units were no match for a Servant, the danger they posed came from their sheer, overwhelming numbers.

 
**X Alter:**
Our mission was to recover the manufacturing base in order to break the deadlock.


**--ARROW--:**

		– Artificial Planet Esaba –

 
 
		– Underpole Base Occupied by League of Villains –
　　　
		– Heated Defensive Line Battle Underway –

 
**X:**
...

 
**X Alter:**
X? X? Are you alive? Can you hear me?

 
**X:**
(Huff...huff...) This is nothing...
It's just a flesh wound...

 
**X:**
It'll take more than just a little battle to the death against the Savage Queen...

 
**X:**
...and a brawl with the squid legions of Tentacle General Sanity Gilles to take me down...

 
**X Alter:**
Don't forget Herc The Superhuman's baryon ax that Nameless Red deflected, causing it to pierce straight through your side.

 
**X:**
Oooh, right. Seriously, who IS that guy? Ow ow ow...

 
**X:**
If not for my Saber Ninja Art where I make afterimages with Spirit Origins, this could've been real bad for me.

 
**X Alter:**
...You almost certainly would have died instantly.
Because even for a Servant, those were severe wounds.

 
**X Alter:**
But at least your questionable Saber Ninja Arts came in handy for once.

 
**X:**
Huh!? What do you mean, “questionable”!?
...Ow, ow...

 
**X Alter:**
Our comms are being jammed...

 
**X Alter:**
Deep in the heart of enemy territory as we are, I guess it's no surprise. Plus, we got separated from our team.

 
**X Alter:**
Your injuries are very serious too. We need to hurry and find you somewhere safe to recover.

 
**X Alter:**
There's no telling when more battle Voloids might show up.

 
**X:**
What!? There's no way I'm taking a break in the middle of this final batt&ndash;Guh.

 
**X Alter:**
There, you see?

 
**X Alter:**
I'll stand watch and see if I can find anything useful. Black Knight, help me carry X somewhere safe.

 
**X Alter:**
Who else would I be talking to, Voloid K6-X4?
Don't space out on me now.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...!?

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Uh, g-got it!


---

**--BATTLE--:**

**X Alter:**
...There. We got past the enemy's automated defenses and made it inside their base.

 
**X Alter:**
Though I'm afraid X isn't going to have any opportunities to recover in here.

 
**X Alter:**
Huh? What is it, Black Knight?
...There's still a hostile here!?

 
**X Alter:**
...! Who are you?

 
**???:**
Looks like your friend's out of commission.
Good. That'll make this easier.

 
**X Alter:**
No way...!
Edgy Fett...!!!

 
**Edgy Fett:**
Whoa, easy there.
I'm not about to waste any bullets in here.

 
**Edgy Fett:**
Killing your friend while she's already got one foot in the grave won't earn me a single credit.

 
**Edgy Fett:**
The League of Villains has much bigger fish to fry.

 
**Edgy Fett:**
No, I'm more interested in you...Heroine X Alter.

 
**X Alter:**
X...Alter...!? What are you...
S-stop that... Please, stop.

 
**X Alter:**
M-my name is...Ex...
I don't...go by that... Ngh...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Ex? Are you okay?
 
**Edgy Fett:**
I see. Looks like the brainwashing's stronger than I thought.

 
**Edgy Fett:**
But you still must have noticed how unstable you've been since you came to this planet.

 
**Edgy Fett:**
That vision correction device you're wearing was made here on Esaba. I'm sure you've already figured that out.

 
**Edgy Fett:**
But it was also illegally modified to maintain and reinforce your brainwashing.

 
**Edgy Fett:**
Since you got here, an identical frequency emitted from the planet's automated factory has been canceling out their modifications.

 
**X Alter:**
Huh!? Reinforced brainwashing...?
How do you know about this?

 
**Edgy Fett:**
My last client told me to be careful around you.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
X Alter? Did you just remember something?
 
**X Alter:**
That's right... I... I wandered around space...before I came to Cosmo-Chaldea High School... Ngh...

 
**X Alter:**
Black Knight...some of your memories have been encrypted, right?

 
**X Alter:**
Maybe my memories have something to do with...
(Gasp...gasp...)

 
**X Alter:**
Ahh... I'm glad X isn't awake...to see me like this...

 


---
 
**Edgy Fett:**
I'm afraid I don't have time for idle chatter.

 
**Edgy Fett:**
The League of Villains might have Lionhead's heroes in a tight spot right now...

 
**Edgy Fett:**
...but it won't be long before the busybodies at the Galactic Police catch wind of this and stick their noses in.

 
**Edgy Fett:**
Sooner or later, Esaba's going down. I was just planning my escape route when you showed up.

 
**Edgy Fett:**
So, I've got a proposal for you.

 
**Edgy Fett:**
Come with me, and I'll take you to see the League of Villains' higher-ups.

 
**X Alter:**
N-no...I won't!
I'm a student at...Cosmo-Chaldea High School...!

 
**X:**
...

 
**X:**
(Ex's been acting weird ever since we landed on this planet. Going off on her own, being weirdly belligerent...)

 
**X:**
(At first I thought she just got up on the wrong side of the bed. But this explains what's been happening with her...)

 
**X:**
(...I don't get it one bit.)

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
(Heroine X...?)

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
(When did you wake up?)


---
 
**X:**
(Whoa there. Keep it cool, Black Bucket,
or you're gonna set off my ninja arts.)

 
**X:**
(I noticed someone was following us, so I was getting ready to fight back the moment they dropped their guard...)

 
**X:**
(But now, I don't know what's going on.)

 
**X:**
(I was all set to punch Chief Red's fast and furious looking relative here in the face if he laid a hand on Ex...)

 
**X:**
(...but as much as it sucks, I'm gonna have to wait and see how this plays out, thanks to these injuries.)

 
**Edgy Fett:**
...Suit yourself. I've done what I need to,
so I'm getting out of here.

 
**Edgy Fett:**
I just thought I might be able to cash in on a League of Villains reward. That's all.

 
**X Alter:**
...That's enough, bounty hunter.
Please leave. Before X wakes up.

 
**Edgy Fett:**
...Heh. Just don't go dying on me.
Be a waste of a good bounty.

 
**Edgy Fett:**
...Oh, I almost forgot.

 
**Edgy Fett:**
Since I lost my shot at an easy payday, I guess I might as well drop a little tidbit here...

 
**Edgy Fett:**
...I wouldn't count on a wound from a Savage Queen's heavy spear getting better anytime soon.

 
**Edgy Fett:**
Not unless you've got a way of undoing an anti-healing curse.

 
**X Alter:**
What...? That can't be right!

 
**Edgy Fett:**
This passage leads to the center of the factory. Maybe it'll have something that can help a Servant heal faster.

 
**Edgy Fett:**
Assuming the defender Voloids don't get you first, of course.

 
**X Alter:**
...You're quite the busybody yourself, Edgy Fett.

 
**X:**
 
(I'll say!)

 
**X Alter:**
That's it...!

 
**X Alter:**
I can use this device to heal X.

 
**X Alter:**
...Huh? No, wait. This is...

 
**X Alter:**
...

 
**X:**
 
(What? What is it? Now I really wanna know!)

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Maybe it's about time you woke up?


---
 
**X Alter:**
Dammit. They did see us coming in...!

 
**???:**
Who dares disturb my factory's harmony?

 
**X:**
Damn, doesn't look like we'll be able to talk our way out of this one!

 
**X:**
But that's fine with me!
If they want to fight, I'll take them all on!

 
**X Alter:**
X...!

 
**X Alter:**
You don't have to do this. That guy is probably this factory planet's manager, and he's really strong.

 
**X Alter:**
Besides...I can't let your injuries get any worse.

 
**X:**
Don't be ridiculous, Ex!
That's all the more reason to fight back!

 
**X:**
If I can beat this guy, I'll have academy credits for daaays! Then I'll be able to live it up and pig out every night until I graduate!

 
**X Alter:**
(Sigh)... I swear, you never change...

 
**X Alter:**
You might not have a lot going for you, X, but if nothing else, you don't want for bluster.

 
**X:**
Now you're talking trash about me!?

 
**X:**
I see. So you're planning to turn traitor!
Well not on my watch, you aren't!

 
**???:**
If you wish to plead for your lives, intruders,
you may do so in the depths of hell!

 
**X Alter:**
We weren't talking to you!
Just shut up and give us a moment!

 
**???:**
You underestimate me at your own... Hm?
Is that...?

 
**X Alter:**
Thank you, X.

 
**X Alter:**
You once shared a freshly baked red bean bun with me.

 
**X Alter:**
Now that I think of it, you've always been giving me things, and you never once asked for anything in return.

 
**X Alter:**
I've always wanted to pay you back somehow.

 
**X:**
Huh? I forgot all about that, but...okay?

 
**X:**
H-hey, why so close? This...uh...this isn't really the time to hug it out, I don't think...

 
**X Alter:**
Got you.

 
**X Alter:**
Black Knight, would you might dunking her, please?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Did you say dunk!? W-well, okay.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
(Stuff Heroine X into the machine)


---
 
**X:**
Huh? What're you&ndash;Ow!
Hey, quit shoving me... Gaaah!

 
**X:**
What's the big idea!? What's all this freezing cold slimy stuff!? Aah, I'm gonna die, I'm gonna die, I'm gonna die!!!

 
**X:**
Ex, you traitor! You too, you overgrown bucket!

 
**H：X (Frozen):**
...

 
**X Alter:**
I can tell you're upset about this.
I'm sorry, X.

 
**X Alter:**
I wish I'd found something that could have healed you, but I couldn't.

 
**X Alter:**
This is a flash-freezing device.
It's called a Carbon Coffin.

 
**X Alter:**
Even if I don't make it, I'm sure someone from the school will find you, thaw you, and heal you.

 
**X Alter:**
Even if the whole planet blows up,
you should still be fine...I think.

 
**X Alter:**
...Okay, Black Knight. Send me my battle suit.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
On it!

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Don't you need to take off your glasses?


---
 
**???:**
These undulations... I knew it! It's Alternium!

 
**???:**
So you're the lost Dark R.O.U.N.D.S. successor.

 
**X Alter:**
I might be destined to join the League of Villains one day.

 
**X Alter:**
But that day...is not today.

 
**???:**
...How dull. To think the Black Knight of the Round Table would be reduced to this.

 
**???:**
Any pride you had in infiltrating the enemy side is gone. Now you are ruled entirely by fleeting emotion.

 
**???:**
You are a traitor to our cause.

 
**???:**
Not even the notorious League of Villains would take someone who threw everything into such disorder back.

 
**???:**
You must be returned to them so that they can remind you of your place and put you back in it!

 
**???:**
You can start by becoming one of the parts that makes up the mechanisms of my factory, like a drive shaft, or a heat source, or a distributor.

 
**???:**
If you can't even do that...then die!


**--BATTLE--:**

**Mecha Eli-chan:**
(Sniffle)... I see.

 
**Mecha Eli-chan:**
So the hero Servants were successful at bringing down Esaba and dealing a critical blow to the League of Villains.

 
**Mecha Eli-chan:**
There are few things worse than a factory that makes evil robots. You did the right thing. The heroic thing.

 
**Mash:**
So Planet Esaba was destroyed in an explosion caused by the gravity fields colliding.

 
**Mash:**
And X and Ex were saved by freezing themselves in a Carbon Coffin.

 
**Mash:**
Phew... Talk about a close call!

 
**X Alter:**
Yes, it was. Oh, but we still wouldn't have made it back without Black Knight.

 
**X Alter:**
If it wasn't for his distress beacon, we would have been forever lost in the vacuum of space like so much debris.

 
**X:**
I guess the reason I can't remember all that must be a side effect of the Coffin's freezing process...

 
**Heroine XX:**
Beep boop...
(I'm pretty sure that's not how it works...)

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Hmm... Hm?


---
 
**Mash:**
What is it, Senpai?
Is there something strange about what she said?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
It almost feels like my own memories don't quite match what we just heard...
 
**Mash:**
Really? That must be a very odd sensation.
Maybe it's a kind of déjà vu?

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
What makes you say that?
 
**Mash:**
I, um, I guess it's just my Shielder Sense...?

 


---
 
**X Alter:**
(Staaare)

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
(...Ex is looking at me veeery intently.)


---
 
**Mash:**
Are you sure everything is okay, Senpai?

 
**Mecha Eli-chan:**
Perhaps all this Servantverse information is memetically corrupting [♂ his /♀️ her} mind...?

 
**X:**
You were definitely nodding off a bit there, Master.
Get it together, will you?

 
**Heroine XX:**
Yeah, for real, Mas&ndash;
I mean, yes, you must do better.

 
**X:**
I knew there was something suspicious about her!

 
**X Alter:**
Heh heh.
...Shh. Let's just keep it our little secret.


**--FLASHBACK--:**
 
**X Alter:**
This place won't hold much longer.

 
**X Alter:**
But the battle seems to be going well.
I guess the principal's team must have handled it.

 
**X Alter:**
Huh? You found another Carbon Coffin?
Great job, Black Knight.

 
**X Alter:**
Although... The thing is, that device needs a lot of careful adjustments.

 
**X Alter:**
There wasn't any time for this with X, but someone's usually supposed to stay behind and operate it from the outside.

 
**X Alter:**
If it's not handled properly, it can also lead to issues with memory retention....

 
**X Alter:**
Huh? You can handle those adjustments no problem?
And you can even do it from inside the Coffin?

 
**X Alter:**
...Hmm, I see. That would be perfect.

 
**X Alter:**
...Yeah, you're right.

 
**X Alter:**
I'm sure we don't have much time left...

 
**X Alter:**
...but I hope fate allows me just a little more.

 
**X Alter:**
May the Alternium be with you...
