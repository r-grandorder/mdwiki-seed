# Jaguar Warrior

## Night Rounds! Miss Jaguarmura!

**Mash:**
Here you go, Senpai, Ishtar.
Emiya made some tea for us.

 
**Ishtar:**
...(Sigh) What did I ever do to deserve being summoned to a place like this where I'm forever condemned to choke down cheap tea?

 
**Emiya:**
If you're going to complain, then don't drink it.
I don't really have anything fit for a goddess.

 
**Ishtar:**
Hmph. You there, gloomy Archer, you're not being respectful enough to a goddess like me.

 
**Emiya:**
My apologies. I am a mere peasant, after all. Shouldn't you, in your great benevolence, be more lenient to the likes of me?

 
**Ishtar:**
Hmph. Is it just me,
or am I getting condescended to?

 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
Like a cold chill running down your spine,
I creep in! Yahoo! Is everyone feline good!?

 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
Young ones! Young'ins! Are you all enjoying the purrime of your youth!? Good, good. I won't stop you!

 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
Yep...the only thing I can say is:
(standing prim and tall) ...I wanna join!!!

 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
Oh, that tea smeows really nice.
I want some.

 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
What about snacks?
Like chocolate mouse...I mean, mousse?

 
**Mash:**
...Jaguar Warrior...

 
**Ishtar:**
That cat's as rowdy as always... Is it too late to abandon her in the middle of a field in Uruk, Fujimaru?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
That's probably not an option...


---
 
**Mash:**
...? Senpai. Emiya seems to be acting strange...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Oh right. Has he not met Jaguar Warrior?


---
 
**Emiya:**
...(Utter bafflement)

 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
Mrrow!? That look on his face! Something he saw made him real sad! I'm pawsitive of it!

 
**Emiya:**
No, no. Nothing like that. Toothache.
No reason to be concerned.

 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
Now he's shaking his head all exasperated!

 
**Emiya:**
By the way, Fujimaru. What is this creature?
I can't imagine a Heroic Spirit looking so absurd.

 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
Hey, don't call me “absurd” or a “creature”! That hurts my felines! Fur your information, I am a Divine Spirit! I'm godly...a big shot!

 
**Emiya:**
(Dumbstruck)

 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
Look at that shocked look! Big sister never raised you to become such a catty person!

 
**Emiya:**
Uh...well, I don't remember being raised by a weird cat-creature...

 
**Mash:**
Please calm yourselves... I will go and make more tea, so please have a seat, Jaguar Warrior.

 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
Oh, but not that. I forgot that I hate to drink hot things. Iced tea would be purrfection though.

 
**Ishtar:**
Ugh... I'm not even part of this conversation and she's irritating me! Mash, I give you my permission to beat the crap out of that thing.

 
**Mash:**
I-I will do no such thing! A-and, no, I will not replace sugar with salt, either!

 
**Mash:**
Here you go, Jaguar Warrior. Iced tea.

 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
Ah, thanks Mashy.
(Glug, glug, glug...)

 
**Mash:**
(Mashy...? That's new.)

 
**Mash:**
A-anyway. Everyone's having tea, so please make yourself at home, too, Jaguar Warrior.

 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
(Gulpgulpgulp) Phew! Thanks for the tea!
It was good! I'll be taking my leave, meow!

 
**Ishtar:**
...Huh?

 
**Emiya:**
...What?

 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
Hmmm... (Looking around)

 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
Well, maybe if I look harder, I think there's a couple more people with ties to me that I could find nearby and lug around...

 
**Pārvatī:**
...

 
**Pārvatī:**
(Oh my...what should I do?)

 
**Pārvatī:**
(I don't know why, but since I had time on my hands, I was thinking of asking that red archer to teach me how to cook Japanese food...)

 
**Pārvatī:**
(...But I have this strange feeling that I would get involved in something very...difficult if I go in that room right now.)

 
**Pārvatī:**
(It's just a hunch of mine. Yes, just a hunch.)

 
**Pārvatī:**
...

 
**Pārvatī:**
(Change of plans! Today, I'll go ask Boudica to teach me how to make Western home-cooked meals!)

 
**Emiya:**
...

 
**Emiya:**
(The Divine Spirit of the jaguar...simply chose THAT as a vessel on the basis that she's feral...)

 
**Emiya:**
(I don't know a thing.)

 
**Emiya:**
(She stares at me sometimes, but has she figured something out...? No, there's no way. It's probably just an instinctual thing.)

 
**Emiya:**
(It's just like how I feel something from that red Archer.)

 
**Emiya:**
(And if something sets off my instincts, it may be because there is some sort of connection between us...)

 
**Emiya:**
(But there's nothing I can do if I don't know...)

 
**Emiya:**
(But the one thing I can say for sure is that Chaldea's Summoning System is rubbish.)

 
**Emiya:**
(And it's not just because of her.
After all, it summoned me as a Servant, too.)

 
**Emiya:**
...And if such a group started interacting without considering the consequences, it could lead to chaos.

 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
(Sniff, sniff...) Huh.
I caught a scent, but he's nowhere to be found.

 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
I guess I have no choice.
I guess I'm stuck with these two.

 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
Oh. And obviously, I'll have Master and Mashy help me out, too.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I don't see a way out of this...
 
**Mash:**
No. I don't mind helping out,
but I wonder what we are going to do...

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Sure!
 


---
 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
That's the spirit! Here's a Jaguar Stamp for you as a reward! Rumor has it that if you collect 'em all, something good will happen!

 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
...Eh? Specifically what, you ask? Who knows! Hey, you over there! Don't say stuff like that! It's not shady!

 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
There's a saying that opurrtunity comes to those who believe! Why? 'Cause unlike tigers, this jaguar is a Divine Spirit! Something grrreat would happen!

 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
It's like...like...getting blessed with the power to never get pasta sauce splattered on your shirt...

 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
Or like the power to get TWO sodas from a vending machine...whoa, that's incredible!

 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
Anyway. Have no fear and follow meow!
Let's go, go, go!

 
**Ishtar:**
H-hey! Where are you taking us!?

 
**Emiya:**
(Sigh)... I can't say no now that I know Master is going.

 
**Emiya:**
At least tell us your plan.

 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
Hm! Well, to give you the abridged version...

 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
...we're gonna visit a place that is connected...I think...to all of us. The land of beginnings...

 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
Fuyuki! And it's in a bind!

 
**Emiya:**
Hm. This is...

 
**Ishtar:**
Huh. It's like a graveyard.

 
**Ishtar:**
To bring a shining goddess of Venus to a gloomy place like this...you South American gods are barbaric.

 
**Ishtar:**
This place is just the worst. If you really wanted a goddess, I wish you'd picked a different one.

 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
But hey, it's really lively for such a gloomy place! Grim grinning ghosts come out to socialize!

 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
Yup! Definitely a ghost town! And look at all these things milling about...they're like squatters!

 
**Mash:**
Yes, I've detected that, too!
Da Vinci, what are these!?

 
**Da Vinci:**
Hmmm. I can't say we really expected this...

 
**Da Vinci:**
There's no Holy Grail here anymore, just like the other Singularities. The Incineration of Humanity is over...

 
**Da Vinci:**
The world should have righted itself, and the distortion disappeared...but in this case, the Holy Grail might still be affecting the area.

 
**Da Vinci:**
I'm not exactly sure how and what it's affecting, though.

 
**Mash:**
This isn't something we can ignore, is it?

 
**Da Vinci:**
No. We have no idea what other issues might spring up if we leave it alone. First things first, you'll need to get rid of those malevolent spirits.

 
**Da Vinci:**
Something's causing this.
You just have to find it and get rid of it.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I found it!

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
It looks like it's going to attack!
 


---
 
**Mash:**
Please, Emiya, Ishtar!

 
**Ishtar:**
What!? You want ME to work!?
Can't you guys just handle it yourselves?

 
**Emiya:**
I'd love to do this without you, but it seems your opponent isn't going to just let you go.

 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
The heart of the great jaguar, who loves justice and sacrifices, led me here! Fleeing from the enemy means death OR sacrifice!

 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
Besides, I have this feeling that you two are under my guardianship, so you gotta do what this jaguar says!

 
**Emiya:**
Guardianship? Are you sure it's not more like a pet sort of thing?

 
**Ishtar:**
Wait a minute, shouldn't it be the opposite?

 
**Ishtar:**
We may both be Divided Spirits, but I am a genuine goddess. You're a nagual of Tezcatlipoca. There's no contest&ndash;

 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
Shut up! No backtalk! This teacher does not tolerate misbehavior from her students!

 
**Ishtar:**
Teach...er!? What!?

 
**Ishtar:**
Anyway, these things are buzzing around like gnats and it's pissing me off! I'm gonna swat them all!

 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
Ah! No matter how much complaining she does, she's still going to help me! I KNEW I was adored!

 
**Emiya:**
(Oh crap. She's got the serious eyes!)


**--BATTLE--:**

**Jaguar Warrior:**
Maybe this way? Hmmm, yep, it's this way.
C'mon guys! Let's explore!

 
**Mash:**
This place...is in shambles. From what I can tell,
it looks like it was a school.

 
**Ishtar:**
Huh. A school.

 
**Emiya:**
...Does that mean something to you?

 
**Ishtar:**
Nope. Nothing. Nothing at all.
What about you?

 
**Emiya:**
Same here.
I don't feel anything for this place.

 
**Ishtar:**
...I see. By the way, I feel like you've been a lot less deferential to me since we got here.

 
**Emiya:**
It's better that way. After all, we're both Servants who got summoned by the same Master.

 
**Emiya:**
A Heroic Spirit who can't work with others because they're obsessed with their position in some hierarchy isn't worth the energy it took to summon them.

 
**Emiya:**
That...and I suppose I do feel a bit more at ease since we're in Japan. I'm more comfortable here than places like England or France.

 
**Ishtar:**
Hmph. Aaand we're way out of my comfort zone here...

 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
But I'M purrfectly fine! It's like this land is empawering me!

 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
If I had a nickname here, it'd be the Jaguar of Fuyuki... Hm, that doesn't sound quite right.

 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
Whatever! I don't care!

 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
Now! Follow me!
Follow the jaguar you've put all your trust in!

 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
This feels SO right! Whoo!

 
**Da Vinci:**
Look like she knows where she's going, and she's taking the reins this time around. So, is your destination somewhere beyond the ruins of the school?

 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
...

 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
Let me answer your question with my own question...because that's the jaguar way. Do you all know what this jaguar hates?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I...do not, no.
 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
Hey! That's no good! You need to show more interest in me! Specifically, you need to pet me more in My Room!

 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
And so you know, the answer is: lions.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
A...lion...?
 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
Gracias! It's like you can see right through me!

 
**Mash:**
(Uh, I think she's mentioned it a few times herself...)

 


---
 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
Even though we're both part of the cat family,
I feel like we don't mesh, soul-wise.

 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
I've got this pawful feeling that if we sit at the same table, all my food would get eaten up!

 
**Emiya:**
...So what about it?

 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
Hm. Keeping that fact in mind, we'll just come around the corner of this pile of debris and...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
A lion-faced...Chimera!?


---
 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
I knew it was here. I'm getting pumped up!
This jaguar's nose never lies!

 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
Behold! The mortal enemy of the jaguar...my main competitor of the dinner table!

 
**Mash:**
This response...it's a giant ghost!

 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
That is DEFINITELY the cause of this CATastrophe! It's tall, it's behind the school ruins...it must be a social studies teacher! That's a jaguar hunch!

 
**Da Vinci:**
Yikes, you're starting out with a boss enemy!?
Sometimes good instincts get you into trouble!

 
**Mash:**
B-but...now that we've encountered it, we must do something about it!

 
**Ishtar:**
(Sigh) Honestly, something about this Singularity just pisses me off...

 
**Ishtar:**
And of all the things here,
that one really just makes my skin crawl.

 
**Ishtar:**
It's just a remnant, but it's tearing this city up with a vengeance. Just looking at it makes me sick.

 
**Emiya:**
Hm. I forgot that you're a goddess of love and battle.
Are you saying that you would do a better job?

 
**Emiya:**
Might be a bit late to say, but I really wouldn't have thought fighting and love could coexist in one person. Your perspective must be...interesting.

 
**Ishtar:**
What? You got a problem with that!?
I'll blow you away in one shot!

 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
Hold it right there, you two!
Did you just say something naughty?

 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
I won't allow illicit sexual relationships! Why? Because they makes me sad! But if you insist, you'll need to go through me first!

 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
After all, you can't skip the somber,
“They grow up so fast...”

 
**Mash:**
I-I'm sorry, but please concentrate on the battle!
Master's safety is our priority!

 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
Obviously, I haven't furgotten my mission!

 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
Let's do this, Emiyan and flashy-looking goddess! This will be our first collaborative work, and we're sure to emerge victorious!


**--BATTLE--:**

**Mash:**
Enemy responses are gone.
Whew...

 
**Mash:**
(...She was so loud and rowdy even during battle.)

 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
Justice purrvails!

 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
And peace has been restored to Fuyuki... The end.

 
**Ishtar:**
Peace, you say?
The city's still in ruins.

 
**Emiya:**
And there's not a single living soul around.

 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
But still...we still protected it.
We protected Fuyuki!

 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
And isn't that something to be purroud of?

 
**Ishtar:**
...

 
**Emiya:**
...

 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
It may be broken now, but if it gets back going propurrly, that's a win for us, right?

 
**Mash:**
You're right. There are still a lot of unanswered questions about what happened here...

 
**Mash:**
...but I'm still convinced that there was meaning to this.

 
**Da Vinci:**
Yeah, good work, Fujimaru.

 
**Da Vinci:**
Well, we let a primal beast lead our expedition,
but it seems all's well that ends well.

 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
Now, time to head back home to finish our tea party! You'll need to purrpare tea and snacks!

 
**Mash:**
(It appears...that she has forgotten the fact that she doesn't like hot drinks...)


**--ARROW--:**

**Jaguar Warrior:**
Heh heh heh.
Did you think my epic quest would end in Fuyuki!?

 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
Fwahaha. It's fur from over!!
So...here you go!

 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
Now begins the super-secret post-interlude story!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Such freedom...

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Multiple...
 


---
 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
Okay, thanks for that lackluster response!

 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
The city of night, steeped in desires...it's like a mini-map of someone's life with no possible escape!

 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
And it was here that we received intel that there are children who wander around at night...

 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
To pursue the truth, we head to the Amazon&ndash;I mean, to the city at night.

 
**Emiya:**
Explain to me why I'm here again?

 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
Well, because you're Unit 1.

 
**Emiya:**
Unit...1?

 
**Mash:**
Oh, is Ishtar not coming with us this time?

 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
Hm. Obviously I looked for her before we left, but no matter how much I sniffed around, I couldn't find her!

 
**Emiya:**
(Sigh) She bailed.

 
**Da Vinci:**
By the way, Jaguar Warrior, I'm slightly confused... What, exactly, is the point of this Rayshift?

 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
Tsk, tsk, tsk.
Right now, I'm NOT Jaguar Warrior!

 
**Da Vinci:**
...?

 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
Like a sumo wrestler who hits hard and throws oneself at the kids...! ...Hey! Who's the rude dude calling me a sumo wrestler!? I'll have you know that I'm seen far and wide as a svelte lady!

 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
Anyway...I'm the wonderful adult who looks out for children's futures by tackling their most difficult problems...literally!

 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
Now, give me the reaction that says, “Wow, there's still hope for the world with adults like her in it! Now gimme an autograph!” That's the jaguar way! Meow!

 
**Fou:**
Fou...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Uh...yeeeah...
 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
Hey, what kinda lifeless response is that!?
C'mon, gimme some GUSTO!

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
She's so passionate...!
 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
Heh. Now look upon me with your most adoring gaze!

 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
I should also mention that this is all unpaid volunteer work! That'd be craaazy.

 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
And if word of this gets posted anonymously on bulletin boards or social meowdia, my popularity will skyrocket... So don't post it! Don't you dare!

 


---
 
**Emiya:**
I'm as confused as ever as to what she's on about, but maybe she got a taste for battle after Fuyuki the other day...

 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
By the by, your backstory is that you're the first delinquent I rehabilitated!

 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
Formerly a playboy that bleaches his hair...but my toe bean stick of justice went WHAM! POWWIE! Reformed! I'm in your debt...! Something like that!

 
**Emiya:**
...

 
**Mash:**
I don't know why...but I want to say...good work...

 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
Okay! Time for today's patrol! And let's do it with some enthusiasm! ...Hm! I hear the scream of a delinquent who's lost his way! Let's go!

 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
I found him!

 
**Mash:**
That's...Cú Chulainn.

 
**Cú Chulainn:**
...Ah? Hey, it's you, Master.

 
**Cú Chulainn:**
What's going on? Why's everyone here?
I was just taking a stroll.

 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
Rrrgh! Dress code violation! Pierced ears are absolutely a violation of the school dress code!

 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
That condescending attitude!
Those shifty eyes...!

 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
And the nail in the coffin: wearing a full-body leotard is definitely a sign of rebellion! He is pawsitively a shameless delinquent!

 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
Ah...but I understand. It's not all your fault. The adults who never disciplined you are partly responsible fur your behavior. Oh, and Scáthach.

 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
What you gotta do is body slam the kids! Or at least not teach them an instant death move that NEVER WORKS!

 
**Cú Chulainn:**
...Hey, Archer?
What the actual hell is this nonsense?

 
**Emiya:**
If you figure out an answer to that,
be sure and let me know.

 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
Y-you've got to be kitten me!
I'm the prim and propurr warrior of the jaguar!

 
**Cú Chulainn:**
Jaguar, huh? Well, I'm Cú Chulainn,
the renowed hound of my lands!

 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
Oh yeah, that too. That nickname of yours...it sounds like “the rabid dog of the west,” and that can only mean one thing: DELINQUENT!

 
**Cú Chulainn:**
...What?

 
**Cú Chulainn:**
I have no idea what the hell's going on,
but I'm assuming you're trying to pick a fight.

 
**Mash:**
Jaguar Warrior...
Um, I suggest that you try not to provoke him...

 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
It's all right.
They always act rebellious in the beginning.

 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
BUT! Accepting these delinquents for who they are and not running away is the true way a jaguar shows her beautiful stripes!

 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
In other words...the time for talk's over!
Let's go, punk! Come at me!


**--BATTLE--:**

**Jaguar Warrior:**
I knew he was a purehearted young man deep down. It's the adults of this world who warped the boy! ANYWAY, this jaguar's purposeful night stalking continues!

 
**Cú Chulainn:**
Dammit...I knew I should've gone straight home.
You guys are crazy to tag along with THAT thing.

 
**Emiya:**
Unlike you, I wasn't given the choice...
“Reformed Delinquent Unit 2.”

 
**Mash:**
Now that I think about it,
I don't know why Senpai is here either.

 
**Mash:**
No. I probably shouldn't think too hard about this.

 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
Mrrow! Now that I think about it too, nobody's wearing any badges or cuffs that indicate that they're part of Team Night Stalking Jaguar!

 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
Like matching colored windbreaker jackets...
Hm, what a grrreat idea.

 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
When we get home, I'll go ask Da Vinci to make something like that.

 
**Da Vinci:**
Aw, darn. I'm just so busy, I am pretty sure I won't be able to squeeze it in. Mark me down for a no!

 
**Da Vinci:**
(If I did, I'm pretty sure everyone in Chaldea would end up in jaguar print windbreakers...yuck!)

 
**Fou:**
Fou...

 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
Hm...well, I guess it's enough that we're all working with a single purrpose. For now, let's go purrsue our final delinquent. Follow meow!

 
**Cú Chulainn:**
Did you just hear a dog barking?

 
**Emiya:**
...

 
**Cú Chulainn:**
Who're you lookin' at?
I'll break your back&mdash;

 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
Ah! That's him!

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Crap... Ya gotta be freakin' kiddin'!

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
In case I heard wrong the first time, ya gotta tell me again. This thing...what dog breed is it?

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
...Haha!

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
I see, I see... A GOLDEN retriever!
What a totally golden chance meeting!

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Good boy, good boy! Wanna Kintarou candy? No?
Ya want meat? Yeah, I figured.

 
**Mash:**
Is that...Sakata Kintoki...?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Why is he talking to that woman who's walking her dog?

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
He's petting that dog with a big smile on his face...


---
 
**Da Vinci:**
Oh I forgot...one of his skills lets him communicate with animals. He's very friendly with them.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Huh? Oh, it's you, Boss.
Whatcha doin' out here so late at night?

 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
No mistaking it! Bleached blond hair! Sunglasses! Lotsa bling-bling! He's definitely a super-duper delinquent Heroic Spirit!

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
... (That thing's crazy.)

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
(I totally sense it without her sayin' a single word: this sister's a real big hog sorta beast!)

 
**Mash:**
Please don't get the wrong idea. I believe she is just out rounding up all those breaking curfew.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
What the hell? Don'tcha know that I'm a grown ass man? I'm no boy.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
So it shouldn't matter where and when I hang out.
I ain't botherin' no one.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Aw, dammit. That golden doggie got spooked by the pussy cat and ran away. I'll tell ya what, missy.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
I suggest you get that dangerous aura of yours under control. Normal folks won't be able to handle even lookin' at ya.

 
**Emiya:**
If by not handle, you mean one look at her destroys any intent to reform they may have had, then you would be correct, Sakata.

 
**Cú Chulainn:**
Yep. Definitely.

 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
Hey! Don't you two sink right back into your delinquent ways, dammit!

 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
Look at how he's all dressed like a stereotypical delinquent... I can only imagine the kind of abuse he had to endure in the past!

 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
What sort of dark past does he hide in his heart!?
Find out...after this commercial break!

 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
Okay, CUT!

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
What the heck? There's cameras rollin'?
Seriously!? Where!?

 
**Cú Chulainn:**
There's no camera. Sheesh, figure that out yourself.

 
**Cú Chulainn:**
Hey, Archer.
Don't you think this guy's a little too naïve?

 
**Emiya:**
He's naïve to a fault.
I actually feel bad for bothering him.

 
**Emiya:**
And...I'm mortally afraid that his parent might put in an appearance...

 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
Okay! Now let's go and color that blond hair of yours. Let's show a teaser shot of your black hair right before we break for commercial to hook the viewers.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
HUH!?
You sayin' you're gonna color my golden hair!?

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
...That ain't right. That's cruel, sister. You got no call buttin' in on a guy's way of life!

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
If you guys are serious, then I'm just gonna have to go all-out to defend my GOLDEN look!

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Lookin' at you all in red, blue, and tiger print, I got no problem cuttin' loose since you clearly got no appreciation for gold!

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
My hair, my name, and even my axe are all golden! I'll give you a personal lesson on how awesome it is!

 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
Oh crap! That young man is waving a weapon around and getting all violent!

 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
But this jaguar isn't afraid of anything!

 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
Because...even in times like this, as long I use my trump card, I can reform anyone!

 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
That's right...as long as he's under my guidance
(read: beaten down)...nothing can stop me!


**--BATTLE--:**

**Sakata Kintoki:**
Tsk...

 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
Meowhaha. Give up and dye your hair black.

 
**Mash:**
Senpai, Senpai...

 
**Mash:**
This may have all happened in the heat of the moment...but don't you think Jaguar Warrior has gotten a bit out of hand here?

 
**Da Vinci:**
Hmmm...it may be best that you said something.
The problem is WHAT to say...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I can't help but notice that you're blonde, too...
 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
M-mrow!?
M-my hair is fine because I'm an adult!

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Are you one of those adults who forces others into a mold?
 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
Mrow!!! You've hit a nerve there!

**Emiya:**
Ah. We've cornered her now, pointless as this whole game of cat and mouse has been, though...

 
**Cú Chulainn:**
Hey, looks like that guy's going for a counterattack.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Hey you, the cat who can't take a freakin' hint...I'm only sayin' this once, so listen up.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
This golden hair of mine is...

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
My natural hair color!

 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
 
WHAT!?

 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
Really? Oh, then, that's fine.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
That was easy!


---
 
**Fou:**
Fou!

 
**Cú Chulainn:**
...I get it. That cat's tactic is just to go all-out. The moment we break through, her defenses weaken. Well then, I'll take this opportunity myself...

 
**Cú Chulainn:**
I'll have you know that these earrings of mine are family heirlooms, passed down by my parents. So that's why I can't take them off.

 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
Oh I see. Then that's purrfectly fine.
You can keep them on.

 
**Cú Chulainn:**
Easy. Too easy.

 
**Emiya:**
(...I guess I have no choice.
I feel bad, but this is the end for her.)

 
**Emiya:**
Uh, so, actually... My hair did this on its own.
I don't bleach it at all.

 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
Heh? Haha, there's no fooling me on that! That can't be true! There's no point messing with me!

 
**Emiya:**
How come I'm not getting a break!?

 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
And so! Today's night rounds are over...but I'm obviously going out tomorrow night! Got that, Reformed Delinquent Boy, Unit 1!?

 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
The journey of the young man who idolizes the jaguar on her nightly rounds! Until he can finally put his serial dating days behind him!

 
**Emiya:**
(Sigh) I guess I'm stuck with her a little longer.

 
**Emiya:**
Sorry, Master.
She doesn't mean any harm. Probably.

 
**Emiya:**
She's trying to better the world in her own odd way. I'll take care of the rest.

 
**Emiya:**
You go back to Chaldea and rest up. Me? Just keeping a cup of tea ready for me will be enough.

 
**Mash:**
And there goes Emiya...
That is the posture of a sad, defeated man...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
He looks kinda happy, too...
 


---
 
**Mash:**
You think so?
If Senpai thinks so, maybe it's true...

 
**Da Vinci:**
Yeah. I agree with Fujimaru.
He does seem like he is a little happy.

 
**Da Vinci:**
He's the sort of Heroic Spirit who's always taking care of everyone else, but it always seemed like he kept his distance from Jaguar Warrior before.

 
**Da Vinci:**
But it looks like he's given up and now he's tagging along with her. I'd say it all turned out okay.
