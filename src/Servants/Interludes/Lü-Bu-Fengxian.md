# Lu Bu Fengxian

## Tiger and Wolf

**Fou:**
Foou...

 
**Mash:**
Make yourself comfortable, Senpai.
Here's your coffee.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Thank you, for everything.
 
**Mash:**
No, it's nothing... Oh, the Doctor has something he wants to talk to you about.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Why don't you rest for a bit.
 
**Mash:**
Well...about that... There's something the Doctor wants to talk to you about, Senpai.

 


---
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Sorry to bother you so late.
And, as to what I need to talk to you about...

 
**Lu Bu:**
...

 
**Dr. Roman:**
It's him! Him!! Berserker! Don't you think it's a bit odd having a Berserker for a guard?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Really? You think so?
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
What? I can't?
 


---
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Well, think about it...

 
**Dr. Roman:**
A Berserker is a Servant that has lost its reason, so in a way, they can be said to be the most loyal.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
However, this Berserker is different.
Even you have heard of his tales, right?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
He is known by numerous titles, such as "Unrivaled," "Flying General" and "Lu Bu the Peerless,"

 
**Dr. Roman:**
but he betrayed so many people and became so detested, that people called him...

 
**Dr. Roman:**
"Tiger and Wolf"
...just so you know.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
What I'm trying to say is, it's not good to have him as your guard. It's dangerous, Fujimaru...

 
**Lu Bu:**
...

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Yikes!
Was he just glaring at me?

 
**Lu Bu:**

**Dr. Roman:**
Eeek!!
I knew it!!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
P-Please, forgive me! ...Huh?
What the?

 
**Fou:**
Fou!

 
**Mash:**
Wait, this is...
Master, enemy attack!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You're here to help, right?
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Bravo, Flying General!

**Lu Bu:**

**Mash:**
Here they come!
Intercept!


**--BATTLE--:**

**Mash:**
At any rate, I think it's over.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
No!
I'm getting a reading from behind!

 
**Lu Bu:**
![berserk2](https://i.imgur.com/7VYgcEB.png)&ndash;!!!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
What? He's engaging the enemies already? When did that happen? Now that's what I call "Unrivaled!"

 
**Mash:**
Master, let's join him!


**--BATTLE--:**

**Mash:**
...We finally fought them off.
That aside, he's truly fearsome on the battlefield.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Yeah... He truly is "Unrivaled."
There's nothing fake about that title.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Thank you!
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I knew I could trust you!

**Lu Bu:**
...

 
**Fou:**
Foou!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
The "Tiger and Wolf"... "Lu Bu Fengxian," huh...

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Come to think of it, he sacrificed his life for a woman.
At least there're more than tales of betrayal about him...

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Anyway, I wonder which is his true self...

 
**Mash:**
His true self...

 
**Lu Bu:**
...
