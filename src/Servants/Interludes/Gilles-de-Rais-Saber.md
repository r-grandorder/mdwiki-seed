# Gilles de Rais (Saber)

## Sword of the Saint

**Gilles:**
I'm sorry, Master.
I have a small favor to ask.

 
**Gilles:**
Do you have time to spare?

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
No problem

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
What happened?

---
 

 
**Gilles:**
...I wish to go back to the 1431 France.
There is something I wish to recover&ndash;

 
**Mash:**
...We've arrived in France.
Now Gilles, what is it that you want to recover?

 
**Gilles:**
It's Jeanne's sword. It's the sword of innocence that she discovered at Saint Catherine's Church.

 
**Gilles:**
It went missing when she was captured, but...
I thought I might be able to find it now.

 
**Mash:**
I see.
In that case, let's head for Orleans.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
...Oh?
I'm picking up something in your surroundings.

 
**Mash:**
I've can confirm that... It's not humans.
It appears to be corpses possessed by ghosts.

 
**Gilles:**
It is a mystery&ndash;but at any rate, let's take them out.
It's not going to be pleasant to let them live.

 
**--BATTLE--:**

**Gilles:**
That's the last of them.
Also it's strange, why would the corpses&ndash;

 
**Gilles:**
Well, let's move on anyway.

 
**Gilles:**
Whoa!

 
**Gilles:**
Mash, Master, are you both all right?

 
**Mash:**
Yes, I'm fine.
But there are so many corpses here.

 
**Gilles:**
Hmm.
There might be something.

 
**Gilles:**
Saint Catherine's sword is important, but we must figure out what's causing them to revive, too...

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Nine times out of ten, it's some suspicious virus&ndash;

 
**Mash:**
We're already busy retrieving the Holy Grail, so I decline to deal with such a biohazard!

 
**Gilles:**
Hahaha, it can't be that. I sense a slight trace of magical energy out of their bodies.

 
**Gilles:**
It has something to do with magical means, not biological.

 
**Fou:**
Fou!

 
**Mash:**
What's wrong Fou?
Should we go this way?

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
We should follow him.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Let's follow his orders.

---
 

 
**Gilles:**
Yes. Rather than running in the dark,
we should put our faith in beast's instincts.

 
**Gilles:**
Hm, we've got more of them here.
Master, stay behind us.

 
**Gilles:**
Miss Mash, let's go!

 
**Mash:**
Right!


**--BATTLE--:**

**Gilles:**
...Whew.
Well, we managed to clean it up somehow.

 
**Mash:**
Yes.
But aside from that, what exactly is here&ndash;

 
**Fou:**
Fou!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Oh, a warning! A strong magical energy signature detected near the throne.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
If left alone, it may lead to the birth of another singularity. Could you investigate the possibility?

 
**Mash:**
Understood&mdash;
Ahhh!

 
**Gilles:**
What's this!
Can this be, Saint Catherine's sword!

 
**Mash:**
The shadows are gathering, and they're trying to change their form. This is...a Shadow Servant!

 
**Gilles:**
Ugh!
So, you've been searching for the sword!

 
**Gilles:**
I hate to break it to you, but that sword is not yours.
You will hand it over!

 
**Mash:**
...It's coming!


**--BATTLE--:**

**Gilles:**
Got it!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Target elimination confirmed.
If you retrieve that sword, all should return to normal.

 
**Gilles:**
Yes, we've retrieved the sword.

 
**Gilles:**
...Master, are you familiar with the legend of Jeanne d'Arc and this sword?

 
**Gilles:**
She always waved the flag to encourage us and was always on the front lines, but&ndash;

 
**Gilles:**
She never drew her sword.

 
**Gilles:**
I asked her if she was afraid of getting blood on her hands. She gave me a peculiar answer.

 
**Gilles:**
"No, for when I wave this flag, my hands become one with yours."

 
**Gilles:**
"However, I am embarrassed to say that I am unskilled with the sword. Forgive me."

 
**Gilles:**
She never drew her sword.
However, she carried our sin with us.

 
**Gilles:**
&ndash;That being the case, I will not tolerate anyone drawing this sword but her.

 
**Gilles:**
Someday, somewhere, she will need to draw this sword.
Until then, I must protect it properly.

 
**Gilles:**
...I appreciate you accommodating my personal affairs.

 
**Gilles:**
Let's continue to fight together!
