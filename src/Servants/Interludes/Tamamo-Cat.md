# Tamamo Cat

## Overflowing Wildness

**Tamamo Cat:**
Master, let's go hunting!

 
**Mash:**
Eek!? C-Cat!
Don't surprise me like that!

 
**Tamamo Cat:**
Oh, sorry about that. My bad. My bad. I just can't keep my surging wild nature in check. You gotta understand.

 
**Mash:**
E-Even so, it's unexpected...
Come on, Senpai. Tell her to be more careful.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Are you hungry?
 
**Tamamo Cat:**
Let's just say that's one of the reasons!

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Do you want to sharpen your claws?
 
**Tamamo Cat:**
Let's just say that I always want to sharpen them!

 


---
 
**Tamamo Cat:**
But as expected, Master understands me the best!
In this case, now we really gotta go on that hunt, no?

 
**Fou:**
Fou?

 
**Tamamo Cat:**
Oh! Nice design. That squirrel is really cute.
Climb up on my paw if you like. Rather, get on it now.

 
**Fou:**
Fou, foou!

 
**Tamamo Cat:**
Wahahahahahahaha! That tickles! That tickles!
&mdash;Gotcha!

 
**Fou:**
Fou!?
Nnng, Gyagyaaaaaaaaau!

 
**Tamamo Cat:**
Wahaha! I got this cute little guy now! If you don't want me to squish him, then you'll join us Mash!

 
**Mash:**
Oh no! Fou's been taken hostage...
Senpai, Cat may not look it, but she's got brains!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Yep. Cat's pretty smart sometimes.
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
...Well, she is a "cat" after all...
 


---
 
**Tamamo Cat:**
I've seen this coastline before, Master.
What sort of evil land is this?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
A goddess once lived on this island.
 
**Mash:**
It's the island Stheno lived on.
Don't you remember?

 
**Tamamo Cat:**
Hmm.
I don't remember at all.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
An evil god lived on this island.
 
**Tamamo Cat:**
I knew it. I can feel it.
I mean, this island is pretty gloomy.

 


---
 
**Mash:**
But, Senpai. Why are we really here?
Is there something on this island?

 
**Tamamo Cat:**
Now now, I already know what you're thinking,
Mashy-Mash. This place is the nature's treasure vault, full of carrots.

 
**Tamamo Cat:**
And here's proof of it. Look.
There's a whole group coming out to meet us.

 
**Monster:**
Caaaaaaaaaaaat!

 
**Mash:**
A-Are they enemies?
Doctor, check for enemy lifeforms!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
"The line you are calling cannot be reached. Since it's lunch time, any work outside of Grand Order will be declined."

 
**Mash:**
DOCTOR!
Everybody is too relaxed this time!


**--BATTLE--:**

**Tamamo Cat:**
Woof! We have control of the coast. On to the shore!
I'll catch salmon in the river and animals in the forest!

 
**Mash:**
Cat went into the forest.

 
**Mash:**
We've stuck together this far.
Let's stay together. After her, Senpai!

 
**Asterios:**
Get...out...!
This river...is my...territory...!

 
**Tamamo Cat:**
Are you nuts? Nature belongs to everyone.
It's just like a beef barbecue: first come, first served.

 
**Tamamo Cat:**
...Hmm? Beef...? First come, first served...? Beef... Beef...beef...I'm recalling memories of Matsusaka beef...

 
**Tamamo Cat:**
Drool.
Hey, are you the 5-star ranked beef?

 
**Asterios:**
Evil! You are...evil!
But...Euryale is also...a little...like that!

 
**Mash:**
...Take your eyes off her for a second, and she gets us into trouble. Master, what should we do?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Come on! We have to back up Tamamo Cat!
 


---

**--BATTLE--:**

**Mash:**
The battle is over.
That was one crazy, out-of-control fight...

 
**Tamamo Cat:**
Darn it all! The beef got away.
I wanted to become friends.

 
**Mash:**
...I think maybe Asterios only came here to look for Euryale...

 
**Mash:**
Except, Stheno was the one who lived here.
Well, it's hard to tell them apart...

 
**Tamamo Cat:**
But we've taken the river.
It's time to hunt! I think I'll help myself to a salmon!

 
**Tamamo Cat:**
You must admit, that salmon was a worthy opponent.With wet scales that sparkle like gems... I can't even!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Wow! One swipe! You're good at that!
 
**Tamamo Cat:**
Oh stop it Master! You're making me blush!
But that's because salmon hunting is what cats do best!

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
You only want one?
 
**Tamamo Cat:**
Yes. I only take what I need.
That's the nature's code.

 


---
 
**Tamamo Cat:**
Now it's time for the main event! Hunt the cows in the ranch! I'm taking some potatoes with me too!

 
**Mash:**
Wow! I didn't know... I wasn't expecting a plain like this when we came out of the forest...

 
**Mash:**
...!
Watch out, Master!

 
**David:**
Sorry. But that's your first and final warning. Normally I'd give you four chances, but this time is special.

 
**David:**
You're sheep thieves, aren't you?This is the ranch that I've taken great pains to develop.

 
**David:**
Can you understand? Starting my own ranch has been my dream, my salvation for all the suffering I went through on the throne.

 
**David:**
Simply put, I will kill anyone who ruins my dream.Besides, I got a house full of wives to take care of.

 
**Mash:**
It's a mistake. We've only come here to hunt&mdash;
Er, I mean... Maybe it's not a mistake?

 
**Tamamo Cat:**
Hahahahaha! This is the first time we've met.
It's nice to meet you, King of the Sling!

 
**David:**
I don't particularly like that nickname.It makes me sound like I'm some kind of con artist.

 
**Tamamo Cat:**
Anyway, I'm gonna grab a carrot! But before that,
maybe I should turn into a giant, like in the tale?

 
**David:**
No need. I'm not fighting Goliath again. You there,
beautiful little beast. After I punish you, I'll make you my wife!

 
**Mash:**
Master, another Servant battle!I don't think this is a hunting trip anymore!


**--BATTLE--:**

**David:**
Ugh, sure I don't have to pay rent here, but perhaps I shouldn't have picked this island.

 
**David:**
Oh, well. I can set up shop anywhere I like.
Farewell, all! Just don't go overboard with the plundering!

 
**Tamamo Cat:**
That David...
He was really powerful for no reason, woof...

 
**Tamamo Cat:**
No matters. The prize is in front of us!
I will get my paws on that five-star beef!

 
**Tamamo Cat:**
&mdash;Master!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Huh? What?
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Ya rang?
 


---
 
**Tamamo Cat:**
Listen. If I get carried away, I want you to stop me.
I'm a fierce fighting dog, not a seeing eye dog.

 
**Tamamo Cat:**
I'm only going to take one cattle.
Alrighty then, let's go!

 
**Mash:**
And, she's back.
She brought back exactly one cattle.

 
**Tamamo Cat:**
Yep. It was a good fight.
Now I'm done hunting.

 
**Mash:**
But...umm, you only took a salmon and a cattle, right?
When you said hunting, I thought it'd be more...

 
**Tamamo Cat:**
What? Of course! These are just the ingredients.
My ultimate goal is to make dinner for Master!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
What?
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
You can cook?
 


---
 
**Tamamo Cat:**
What are you talking about? I may not look it, but I'm a great cook. I'm actually a multi-purpose maid.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
No way!
 


---
 
**Mash:**
I agree with Senpai.
I mean, you? Really? Ahahaha.

 
**Tamamo Cat:**
Here! I've made garlic steak,
pumpkin terrine, roast chicken with diavolo sauce,

 
**Tamamo Cat:**
pumpkin pudding and pumpkin pie, and four kinds of canape that I whipped up.

 
**Mash:**
You really are a good cook...

 
**Tamamo Cat:**
I never lie, you know.
How does it taste, Master?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...Fantastic. Absolutely fantastic...
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I want you to always cook for me from now on.
 


---
 
**Tamamo Cat:**
Nyahaha! I'm so pleased you like it. No worries,
it's my way of repaying you for what you do every day.

 
**Tamamo Cat:**
This is getting embarrassing, so I'm going to close with that. &mdash;Now then, I think I'll have a carrot for my reward!


## The Ring of Carnage

**Tamamo Cat:**
Be patient, I have a long story to tell. That Tamamo-no-Mae is one horrible Servant.

 
**Tamamo Cat:**
Now she's turned over a new leaf... I think? But when she was fully matured she was really terrible.

 
**Tamamo Cat:**
When a demon fox gains a tail, its power will grow exponentially. When it becomes a nine-tailed demon fox, its power is immeasurable.

 
**Tamamo Cat:**
When that happened to her, she became afraid of herself. Thinking that she would never get married like that, she ripped off her tails.

 
**Tamamo Cat:**
One of those tails became me, Tamamo Cat.

 
**Tamamo Cat:**
Okay, here you go, Master!
Today I've made a magnificent lobster!

 
**Mash:**
Wow...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Looks like you sauteed and simmered it...
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Now that's an amazing American-style lobster!
 


---
 
**Tamamo Cat:**
Here you go.
Puting some lemon on it makes it even more delicious.

 
**Mash:**
Wow... So this is the essence of human civilization...
Through cooking, we've distinguished mankind from beast.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Just so you know, a cat made this. Hmm? ...Everyone,
I am sorry to bother you when you're having fun...

 
**Mash:**
Are you kidding me? A pointless enemy attack at a time like this? And inside the apartment even?

 
**Monster Shadow:**
Loooooooobsterrrrrrrr&mdash;!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
It appears that they were attracted by the smell of the food! Since they're here for that, they're pretty tough! For some reason&mdash;

 
**Mash:**
Sh-Shadow Servants!?
What's worse, they're all Berserkers?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Precisely. They're the shadows of the Servants who are always hungry!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
These guys are more powerful than what we've faced so far! Be very careful!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
And save the lobster!
I want some, too! Very badly!

 
**Tamamo Cat:**
...Uh-oh. This is bad.
Since I'm the same way, I can tell.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
What is it, Cat?
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
...You mean, we can't win?
 


---
 
**Tamamo Cat:**
It's bad.
The way I am now, I can't defeat these brutes.

 
**Tamamo Cat:**
It's...like I was just telling you, Master.
When we get serious, we turn pretty nasty.

 
**Tamamo Cat:**
I've put a seal on my Noble Phantasm until now.
Master, will it help if I'm strong?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Of course.
 


---
 
**Tamamo Cat:**
Will you still love me if I'm strong?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Of course!
 


---
 
**Tamamo Cat:**
All right, then I have no choice. It's time to get serious! No more messing around from now on!


**--BATTLE--:**

**Tamamo Cat:**
Lobster chop!

 
**Mash:**
Lobster slash!

 
**Shadow Servant:**
Guh! Ghee&mdash;Aaaaaauuuuuugh!

 
**Mash:**
Enemy Servants eliminated.
Master, we successfully defended the lobster.

 
**Tamamo Cat:**
You're pretty good with that lobster, Mash.
I'm sure you'd make a pretty handy wife in the kitchen.

 
**Mash:**
W-Wife!
No...well...uh...I have no experience in cooking...

 
**Tamamo Cat:**
Cooking and fighting are very similar!
They both smell of blood, and are both just as exciting.

 
**Tamamo Cat:**
The greater the battle with the ingredients, the better it tastes. It's the same in relationships too. The one who wins gets to eat!

 
**Mash:**
Oohh... That's an interesting take.
Very informative. Please tell me more, Professor Cat.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
(Fujimaru, are you sure you don't want to stop this? They're heading down quite a dangerous path...)

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I'm glad Cat has made a friend.
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I'm glad Mash has made a friend.
 


---
 
**Tamamo Cat:**
But, finally my Noble Phantasm has been released...

 
**Tamamo Cat:**
When our spirits become filled with gloom, we lose sight of ourselves. This is a slumberer's paradise, between dawn and dusk&mdash;

 
**Tamamo Cat:**
It's the physical manifestation of a pretty frightening tale, but I guarantee that it's easy to use. So go ahead and use it.

 
**Tamamo Cat:**
Master, from now on I'd like you to handle me with caution. Be strict, but sweet and sometimes gentle, all right?
