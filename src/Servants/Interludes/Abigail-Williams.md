# Abigail Williams

## A Dream of a Thousand Stars and One Hundred Nights

**Narration:**
“It was an unassuming memory from a certain wintry night.”

 
**Narration:**
“Like a glass stone found on the beach, shimmering faintly in the corner of an old wardrobe.”

 
**Narration:**
“Like a light flickering softly deep within the dark woods.”

 
**Narration:**
“A completely unexpected,
wonderfully precious experience...”

 
**Abigail:**
...

 
**Queen of Sheba:**
...

 
**David:**
...

 
**Abigail:**
...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Is everything okay, Abby?


---
 
**Abigail:**
...

 
**Abigail:**
...(Giggle)...

 
**Abigail:**
Oh, Tituba, there you go making a big racket again...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...Tituba?

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
(Does she mean the Queen of Sheba...?)


---
 
**Abigail:**
...Oh? Hello, Master.

 
**Abigail:**
I'm sorry.
I guess I spaced out for a little bit.

 
**Abigail:**
Is there something I can help you with?
Eep!

 
**David:**
Hahahaha! Whether in a wasteland or a desert,
some things never change!

 
**David:**
Only having two people around leads to price-fixing and exploitation, but with three, you have options and competition.

 
**David:**
In other words, that's when the gears of a real economy begin to turn!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
(It's David and the Queen of Sheba.)

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I've been hearing a lot of noise. What's going on?
 
**David:**
Oh, hello, Master.
Hello, Abby.

 
**David:**
The queen and I were just having a little chat.
Turns out we have a lot to talk about.

 


---
 
**Queen of Sheba:**
Yes, yes, I know all that,
and it's beside the point!

 
**Queen of Sheba:**
People were once pure, but they've been consumed by the curse of gold ever since they left Eden.

 
**Queen of Sheba:**
Now they're divided into the haves and have-nots, and the animosity between them only continues to grow.

 
**Queen of Sheba:**
It's not right. It shouldn't be like this.
It shouldn't.

 
**Queen of Sheba:**
But as merchants, we can defuse envy with long-term loans, and pacify unquenchable greed with razor-thin margins.

 
**Queen of Sheba:**
Wouldn't you agree that's our duty&ndash;nay, our responsibility?

 
**David:**
Hmm, I'm not so sure about that, Your Majesty.

 
**David:**
I thought you were a queen first and a businesswoman second. Are you sure you're supposed to let yourself get so wrapped up in worldly affairs?

 
**David:**
You may have materialized in this century, but that still seems to go against everything you stand for.

 
**Queen of Sheba:**
Th-these things don't exist in a vacuum! My queenliness and my business acumen are inextricably tied together!

 
**Queen of Sheba:**
I can't just shrug it all off like some happy-go-lucky shepherd!

 
**David:**
Oh? Then do you have something in mind?

 
**Queen of Sheba:**
Hehe... As a matter of fact, I do.

 
**Queen of Sheba:**
Chaldea may be a castle of might and Mystics, but it's not exactly flush with commercial endeavors or economic protections.

 
**David:**
Aha. I see where this is going.

 
**David:**
It's entirely possible that a figurative bucket of ice water could be dumped on Chaldea from an unforeseen direction.

 
**Queen of Sheba:**
Exactly!

 
**Queen of Sheba:**
Lofty as Chaldea's ideals and goals may be,
it is still a human organization!

 
**Queen of Sheba:**
So if we enterprising entrepreneurs all buckle down and work together, we could make wonderful things happen.

 
**Queen of Sheba:**
For starters, we'll definitely need to bring in Caesar and ...

 
**Queen of Sheba:**
Kid Gil could be a hard sell, but there's definitely a fire somewhere under all that smoke...

 
**Queen of Sheba:**
We could call it “The Chaldea Cartel.” That rolls off the tongue nicely! Although, it might make us seem something less than honorable...

 
**Queen of Sheba:**
Ooh, what about “The Chaldea Merchants Association”
then? That would be super “bene” for a guild!

 
**Geronimo:**
...

 
**Queen of Sheba:**
Hmm. You know, David, if you act now...

 
**Queen of Sheba:**
...I miiight just be willing to offer you a seat on the board so you can save face with Master... (Glaaance)

 
**David:**
Gosh, you'd really do that?
I'm flattered you think so highly of me.

 
**David:**
But, unfortunately, that's an offer I am afraid I must decline.

 
**David:**
That said...I was really moved by how hard you worked for Chaldea. It was like you cared for us as much as one of your precious jewels.

 
**David:**
I never expected to see a queen with your dignity work so hard. That made it all the more touching.

 
**David:**
I think even King Solomon would have had the hots for you after seeing that dual nature of yours. I know I certainly do!

 
**Queen of Sheba:**
T-touching?
Hots...!?

 
**David:**
Man, all this talking's made me hungry.

 
**David:**
No, wait. It must be your sweet perfume that's whet my appetite.

 
**David:**
Anyway, I think I'll go help myself to some rugelach in the cafeteria.

 
**David:**
I hope you'll call on me again the next time you want to read poems or put on a lyre concert. See ya!

 
**Queen of Sheba:**
...Da...

 
**Queen of Sheba:**
Da... Da...
Damn you, David!!!

 
**Queen of Sheba:**
I hope you fall off a camel and die!

 
**Queen of Sheba:**
Who do you think you are, rejecting a once-in-a-lifetime offer made purely out of the goodness of my heart!?

 
**Queen of Sheba:**
You will rue the day you declined to get in on the ground floor of my ServaCoin cryptocurrency!

 
**Geronimo:**
...Could I have a word with you, Queen of Sheba?

 
**Queen of Sheba:**
(Snaps out of it) ...Yes? What is it?

 
**Geronimo:**
Personally, I am all in favor of frank, heated exchanges. To engage in one is the sign of a close friendship.

 
**Geronimo:**
That said...I would urge you to control yourself better, especially in front of her. As you can see, she is rather distraught.

 
**Geronimo:**
It is quite an unpleasant sight to see two close friends at each other's throats, after all.

 
**Geronimo:**
Even if one is perfectly aware of each party's good intentions.

 
**Queen of Sheba:**
Ack...

 
**Queen of Sheba:**
I... Yes, he's right. I'm sorry you had to see me behaving like that...

 
**Abigail:**
Um... Please don't worry about it, Your Majesty.

 
**Abigail:**
I appreciate you worrying about me,
Geronimo, but I'm fine. Really.

 
**Abigail:**
...I don't, um... Well, I don't really understand this business talk anyway...

 
**Abigail:**
But just seeing you and King David here together is like a dream come true, Your Majesty.

 
**Abigail:**
It's so wonderful being in your presence that I feel like I'm walking on clouds!

 
**Geronimo:**
...Oho. Perhaps my concerns were misplaced.

 
**Queen of Sheba:**
Phew... (Ears flop in relief)

 
**Queen of Sheba:**
Thank you, Abigail. I promise I'll do my best to live up to your expectations.

 
**Abigail:**
Teehee, please, just call me Abby. Silly Tituba.
Ah...

 
**Abigail:**
I'm sorry. I should know that's not your name by now...

 
**Queen of Sheba:**
Hehe, that's quite all right.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Tituba? As in your servant...?
 
**Abigail:**
...Yes. That's right.

 
**Abigail:**
She was my uncle's slave back in Salem...

 
**Abigail:**
I wonder why I keep calling her by that name...

 
**Abigail:**
She was nothing at all like the Queen of Sheba...

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
(...I think I'll just let that one slide.)
 
**Abigail:**
...I'm so embarrassed...

 
**Queen of Sheba:**
Don't be. We Servants are intimately familiar with our past and our future. I've even heard some of us keep our memories from before we're summoned.

 
**Queen of Sheba:**
So...

 
**Queen of Sheba:**
I can understand why you might get me mixed up with someone else you used to know. Please, don't worry about it.

 
**Abigail:**
...Okay. Thank you, Your Majesty.

 


---
 
**Geronimo:**
...Hmm.

 
**Nezha:**
...Abby. There. You are.

 
**Abigail:**
Hello, Nezha.
Good day, Gilles de Rais.

 
**Gilles de Rais:**
And a good day to you, Abigail Williams.

 
**Nezha:**
There is. A tea party.
The duchess. Said to. Invite you.

 
**Nezha:**
Hm? Wait. Was she. A princess? A queen?
Chaldea has. Too many. Nobles.

 
**Abigail:**
Oh my...! Which queen do you mean?

 
**Nezha:**
Hmm? You will. Find out. In the. Cafeteria.

 
**Abigail:**
O-oh my. It's making me so nervous,
getting a personal invitation...

 
**Geronimo:**
Do you mean the break room?
Would you mind if I came along too?

 
**Nezha:**
...Not at. All. You are. Welcome. To join.

 
**Nezha:**
You can. See. How good my.
Oolong Tea. Is. For yourself.

 
**Queen of Sheba:**
...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Why don't you go with them, Sheba?
 
**Queen of Sheba:**
No, that's okay. I have a feeling a certain green-haired shepherd may be there, and I'd rather not see his stupid face right now.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Are you not going to the tea party yourself, Gilles?
 
**Gilles de Rais:**
No. I have business with you, Master.

 


---
 
**Gilles de Rais:**
Might I have a moment of your time?
There is something I need to tell you.

 
**Queen of Sheba:**
Well that's a coincidence.
There's actually something I need to tell you, too.

 
**Queen of Sheba:**
...No, on second thought,
I don't think this is coincidence at all.

 
**Gilles de Rais:**
You don't say...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...There's an ominous star core headed this way?
 
**Gilles de Rais:**
Correct.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
So, you saw a sign of impending disaster...?
 
**Gilles de Rais:**
Indeed I did!

 


---
 
**Gilles de Rais:**
Chaldea is a unique and blessed place...

 
**Gilles de Rais:**
Thanks to its cutting-edge optical instruments and interconnected network, it is possible to observe the stars in ways that were never before possible.

 
**Gilles de Rais:**
What's more, there are skilled technicians here who are deeply versed in the ways of magecraft.

 
**Gilles de Rais:**
...And yet, there is harmony and discord among the stars that even they cannot see.

 
**Gilles de Rais:**
Even now, there is an almost imperceptibly slight disturbance in the relationship between Saturn and the sun, the two celestial bodies that are supposed to comprise Capricorn.

 
**Gilles de Rais:**
Of course, there is not enough wisdom in the world to perfectly predict the movements of the stars...

 
**Gilles de Rais:**
...which is why I came to the conclusion that some sort of disturbance is making its way here.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
And you had a prediction, Queen of Sheba?

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Are you big on astronomy too, Your Majesty?


---
 
**Queen of Sheba:**
Is that so surprising?

 
**Queen of Sheba:**
I have the stars to thank for my own wisdom too, you know.

 
**Queen of Sheba:**
After all, astrology originated with the people of the sea who first used the stars to navigate the great oceans...

 
**Queen of Sheba:**
...and the people of the desert who crossed vast swathes of sand by night.

 
**Queen of Sheba:**
I'm sure today's scholars would rather pretend otherwise, but the fact is that economies have always been closely tied to the movements of the stars.

 
**Queen of Sheba:**
...I would have brought it up earlier,
if we hadn't been interrupted...

 
**Queen of Sheba:**
...but I was actually just about to mention this disturbance in the stars as well.

 
**Queen of Sheba:**
I'm heartened to see Gilles de Rais came to the same conclusion that I did.

 
**Gilles de Rais:**
...I'm afraid your agreement in this gives me no comfort. Indeed, it only strengthens my concern.

 
**Queen of Sheba:**
Oh... R-right, of course.
I'm sorry, I should really know better. Hehe.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Got it. I'll make sure to keep my eyes peeled.
 
**Gilles de Rais:**
Very well. I encourage you to act with the utmost caution...

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I'll go tell Da Vinci to remain on the alert, too.
 
**Queen of Sheba:**
...Good idea. I think that would be for the best.

 


---
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Thanks for telling me about this, you two.


---
 
**Gilles de Rais:**
...Very well.
That is all I wished to discuss.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Hey, can I talk to you about something?


---
 
**Queen of Sheba:**
...Me?

 
**Queen of Sheba:**
...Ah, now I see.
This is about Abigail.

 
**Queen of Sheba:**
 
Yes... I know she gets my name wrong sometimes.

 
**Queen of Sheba:**
And that it has to do with her memories from when she was alive.

 
**Queen of Sheba:**
Though it does seem like she's been calling me by the wrong name more often lately.

 


---

**Fujimaru 1:**
What do you make of it?

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I can't help but worry a little.


---
 
**Queen of Sheba:**
Hmm...

 
**Queen of Sheba:**
Like I told her earlier,
I don't think it's a cause for concern.

 
**Queen of Sheba:**
She is surrounded by good friends looking out for her best interests here.

 
**Queen of Sheba:**
To be perfectly honest, as one of Chaldea's Servants myself, I don't think it's my place to say anything.

 
**Queen of Sheba:**
Still...if it bothers you,
I suppose there must be a good reason for that.

 
**Queen of Sheba:**
In which case, as a mage,
and as her contracted Master...

 
**Queen of Sheba:**
...I believe it falls to you to step up and help her.

 
**Queen of Sheba:**
If you're still not sure what to do after giving it your best effort, come talk to me again.

 
**Queen of Sheba:**
That said, please don't forget about that disturbance with the stars over the last few days, either.

 
**Queen of Sheba:**
Good luck, and please be careful, Master...

**Fujimaru 1:**
(Somebody's standing at my door...)


---
 
**???:**
Master...?

 
**???:**
...Master?

 
**???:**
Um... Would you mind opening the door, please?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...That sounded like Abby.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Oh, right. I locked my door just to be safe.


---
 
**???:**
I'm sorry to wake you...

 
**???:**
I, um...I know it's very rude of me to bother you so late at night, but...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Hang on, I'll open the door for you.
 
**???:**
...Okay...

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Just use your spirit form and come on in.
 
**???:**
...

 
**???:**
I'm sorry... I...
I just can't get used to my spirit form...

 
**???:**
It's scary... It feels like...I'm going to become someone else...

 
**???:**
Please, Master...
Please don't be mean to me...

 
**???:**
Ah... I'm such a naughty girl...

 
**???:**
...Open, gate...

 


---
 
**Abigail:**
Master...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
(She ran right into my arms)


---
 
**Abigail:**
...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
What's wrong, Abby?


---
 
**Abigail:**
...Please...

 
**Abigail:**
Please tell me, Master...

 
**Abigail:**
Where did I go...?
Where did I disappear to...?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Abby...

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
(Hug her carefully)


---
 
**Abigail:**
(Sniff... Sniff...)

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Are you feeling better now?
 
**Abigail:**
Yes, thank you. That hot drink helped a lot, too...

 
**Abigail:**
But...I think I might have added a little too much milk...

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Want another cup of tea?
 
**Abigail:**
Oh, yes, please!.
Lots of sugar and just a splash of milk, please!

 
**Abigail:**
...You can't? You don't have so many tea leaves?
...Because of Chaldea's tariffs?

 
**Abigail:**
...Because it's night? I see...

 


---
 
**Abigail:**
...Can I talk to you about something, Master?

 
**Abigail:**
...I had a dream.
A terrible, painful dream.

 
**Abigail:**
It felt like...someone was choking me...

 
**Abigail:**
...No. I don't think it was a dream.

 
**Abigail:**
After all, I barely remember anything from my dreams...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
It's normal to forget your dreams after you wake up.
 
**Abigail:**
Then...I was right...

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
That's okay. Servants don't usually dream, anyway.
**Abigail:**
Right... I guess that's true.
The queen said the same thing at the tea party.

 
**Abigail:**
She said it was kind of sad, but that it's also a good thing in a way. So, then...

 


---
 
**Abigail:**
My dream must have been a memory from when I was alive...before I became...a Servant...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
(Abigail Williams's past...?)

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
(She looks deathly pale...)


---
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
(She's never gone out of her way to talk about her pre-Servant life before...)


---
 
**Abigail:**
Master, would you please do me a favor?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
[♂ Sure. /♀️ What sort of favor?}

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
As long as it's something I can do.


---
 
**Abigail:**
...

 
**Abigail:**
I know this is very [♂ improper /♀️ childish},
so I hope you won't [♂ think less of /♀️ laugh at} me, but...

 
**Abigail:**
...would it be okay if I stayed with you until morning? Just for tonight?

 
**Abigail:**
Otherwise, I'm afraid that...

 
**Abigail:**
...that the door to dreamland...will be unlocked...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Of course. That's fine, Abby.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Don't worry. You'll be safe in here.
 


---
 
**Abigail:**
Thank you...Master...

 
**Abigail:**
You didn't have to give up your bed for me.
I would have been fine with a chair.

 
**Abigail:**
...I can still smell you on these sheets...

 
**Abigail:**
...Would you...hold my hand...?
...Master...

 
**Abigail:**
...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Good night, Abby.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
(Hm? All of a sudden, I feel like conking out too...)


---
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I really did fall asleep...

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
It's still night.


---
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...!?

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Where did Abigail go?


---
 
**???:**
Teehee... Hehe...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
That came from outside my door...

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
That sounded like Abby.


---
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I didn't even notice her leaving my bed...


---
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Abby?


---
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Abigail?

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
(It's so quiet...)


---
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
(It's way too quiet outside...)


---
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You can see the stars so clearly tonight...

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Wait a...second...


---
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
What's a forest doing outside Chaldea?


---
 
**???:**
Ahh, what a lovely, starry night!

 
**???:**
Look how brilliantly they sparkle! It's as though the stars have gathered here to put on a show just for us!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...Who are you?

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
You're not fooling anyone, Mephy.


---
 
**Mephistopheles:**
Ah ta ta ta, ta ta ta taaa♪
...Oh?

 
**Mephistopheles:**
Oho, ohoho. I suppose I should have expected no less from Chaldea's veteran mage.

 
**Mephistopheles:**
You're taking all this in stride most marvelously.
...What is that?

 
**Mephistopheles:**
Seeing me here actually puts you much at ease?
How strange. I'm oddly disappointed to hear that.

 
**Mephistopheles:**
Does that mean you understand the situation you find yourself in?

 
**Mephistopheles:**
Or do I need to explain it for you?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
This is my dream.
 
**Mephistopheles:**
I see...

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
This is Abby's dream.
 
**Mephistopheles:**
Oho? A Servant dreaming, you say?

 


---
 
**Mephistopheles:**
Indeed, indeed. This is but a dream.

 
**Mephistopheles:**
Even as we speak, [♂ Sir /♀️ Lady} Mage,
your body is fast asleep in your nice, warm bed...

 
**Mephistopheles:**
Heeheehee. A Servant's dreams are remnants of their past. Their bonds. Their traumas. Their unfinished business.

 
**Mephistopheles:**
It should be plainer than the scissors in my hand that nothing good can come from them.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I have to go after Abby!
 
**Mephistopheles:**
How very like you not to be content with merely letting the dream unfold.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
This isn't exactly my first dream rodeo.
 
**Mephistopheles:**
So you are aware of the problem, but not of the particular symptoms. Hmm...how dreadful.

 


---
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
This place... I recognize it...


---
 
**Mephistopheles:**
...Oh yes, if it's the Williams girl you're looking for,
I happened to see someone who resembled her.

 
**Mephistopheles:**
If you wish to give chase, I suggest you head past this field.

 
**Mephistopheles:**
Now then, I think I shall take this moment to return to the sideli&ndash;Hey!

 
**Mephistopheles:**
Would you mind not being so rough with my costume, pleeease? Woohee!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...!?

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
So this really is Salem!?


---
 
**Mephistopheles:**
Oh? Oh...?

 
**Mephistopheles:**
Do my ears deceive me, or are those angry shouts coming from the other side of the village?

 
**Mephistopheles:**
I can hear voices dripping with venom and malice...
Sneers with desire laid bare for all to see...

 
**Mephistopheles:**
Those are some of my favorite things!
Fascinating!

 
**Mephistopheles:**
We simply MUST see what this is about!
Come, [♂ Sir /♀️ Lady} Mage, let us hurry!

 
**Abigail:**
...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...There she is!

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
...Why's Abby surrounded by other villagers?


---
 
**Girls:**
We didn't do anything wrong!

 
**Girls:**
We had no idea.
Nobody told us anything!

 
**Girls:**
H-how were we supposed to know that...

 
**Girls:**
...s-so many grown-ups were...going to end up hanged!?

 
**Girls:**
Yeah! It's all Ab&ndash;her fault...!

 
**Abigail:**
...

 
**Abigail:**
...I knew.
I listened closely to what went unspoken.

 
**Abigail:**
I knew what would happen.
I could sense it.

 
**Abigail:**
The ones who didn't know...

 
**Abigail:**
...were those who were weak-minded and easily swayed among you...easily...

 
**Abigail:**
...Am I wrong?

 
**Girls:**
...Eek...

 
**Abigail:**
The Devil possessed us.
He preyed on our innocence to seduce us.

 
**Abigail:**
You all saw it yourselves, didn't you?

 
**Abigail:**
You saw the Devil's dark form lurking in the town hall's rafters, didn't you?

 
**Girl:**
I... I'm not...

 
**Abigail:**
It may be too late now,
but it was a truly awful thing to say.

 
**Abigail:**
Unless, perhaps...the Devil is still here in Salem?

 
**Abigail:**
I wonder who he's trying to get hanged now?

 
**Abigail:**
What do you think?
It could be you... Or maybe you.

 
**Girl:**
No, please...
S-stay away from me!

 
**Abigail:**
...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
(Is that...really Abby?)


---
 
**Villager:**
Shut up, you little brats! You shut your damn mouths! I'd rather stuff sand in my ears than listen to another word!

 
**Villager:**
There's nothing more we can do.
Nobody who went to the gallows is ever coming back!

 
**Villager:**
Don't remind us of that cursed time!

 
**Villager:**
That's right... We were dreaming.
We were beset by a horrible nightmare.

 
**Abigail:**
Haha...

 
**Abigail:**
A dream? You think that was a dream?
Is that some kind of joke?

 
**Villager:**
The verdicts were wrong! By the time we took it to trial, we were already defying God's will.

 
**Villager:**
Those who admitted to their crimes only did so under duress. The testimony we heard was false!

 
**Villager:**
There were never any witches here to begin with.

 
**Villager:**
It may take some time...but eventually, those who were punished unjustly will clear their names.

 
**Villager:**
In the end, this was yet another of God's tests...

 
**Abigail:**
A test...?

 
**Abigail:**
Can you really call laying awake, shivering in the night, biting your tongue lest you become the next target, a test?

 
**Villager:**
Ghh...

 
**Villager:**
Even so, we must not forget our prayers.
If we fail to give thanks to God, all is truly lost...

 
**Girls:**
Yeah. Yeah! We'll repent for our misdeeds,
and this time, we'll&ndash;

 
**Abigail:**
That sort of prayer is just you lying to yourself, trying to ease a guilty conscience.

 
**Abigail:**
You were just pretending not to know the truth.
You enjoyed it.

 
**Abigail:**
You loved seeing things spiral out of control, like a snowball tumbling down a hill and growing ever larger.

 
**Abigail:**
You were sick of the grown-ups bossing you around, and you wanted to twist them around your little fingers.

 
**Girl:**
Stop it... Please, stop it!

 
**Abigail:**
Be honest for once.
None of you ever actually saw what I saw, you say?

 
**Abigail:**
The Devil's voice was the wind howling from the sea? Hell's shadows jumping from roof to roof were smoke?

 
**Abigail:**
Don't lie! The Devil WAS inside us back then!

 
**Abigail:**
...I'll never forget it...

 
**Abigail:**
I won't pretend it never happened.
It wasn't just a dream.

 
**Abigail:**
Even if I should be born again someday,
I'll carry this sin with me forever.

**Fujimaru 1:**
...Abby!


---
 
**Abigail:**
Uncle is so depressed he won't even speak to me.

 
**Abigail:**
Even Betty ignores me... She looks at me with such terror, like I am some kind of abomination...

 
**Abigail:**
And Tituba...she's still stuck in that dark cell.

 
**Abigail:**
They won't let me see her, no matter how I beg.
They won't give me a chance to tell her how sorry I am.

 
**Abigail:**
There...there isn't even anyone here who will speak my name...

 
**Abigail:**
But...that's okay... Every time they pretend not to see me, they'll remember the truth.

 
**Abigail:**
There were witches in Salem!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...Abigail!!!


---
 
**Abigail:**
...Huh...?

 
**Abigail:**
Who are you...?
Wait...

 
**Abigail:**
...Mas...ter...?

 
**Abigail:**
What... What am I doing back in Salem?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You're dreaming, Abby. You're just having a bad dream.
 
**Abigail:**
A dream...?

 
**Abigail:**
I...I never wanted any of this to happen...

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Whatever you did, Abby, it's all in the past now.
 
**Abigail:**
You're saying it doesn't matter anymore...?

 


---
 
**Girl:**
I hate you, Abigail Williams!

 
**Girl:**
I wish you'd just get on a ship and disappear.

 
**Girls:**
Yeah! Yeah!

 
**Abigail:**
...!

 
**Abigail:**
...You don't have to tell me.
I'll gladly be the first one to fall!

 
**Abigail:**
But even so...!

 
**Villager:**
Salem is just now picking up the pieces.
We don't need a tainted child like you here!

 
**Villager:**
Forget it all! Just forget about it!

 
**Villager:**
Forget it!

 
**Villager:**
That's right. We should seal this cursed past away.
We can't let the rest of the world know about it!

 
**Villager:**
Salem only barely survived this test God laid before us...

 
**Villager:**
Don't you dare sully the good names of those who gave their lives for it!

 
**Abigail:**
I never meant to...do that...
...No. No.

 
**Abigail:**
You're wrong. There were witches here in Salem.
You can't pretend there weren't.

 
**Abigail:**
I was born and raised in Salem.
I'll never, ever forget what happened here...

 
**Abigail:**
Not the bad...and not the good either...

 
**Villager:**
Why you little...!
How dare you forget your piety, your fear of God!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
They all turned into ghouls!

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
They're going after Abby!


---
 
**Abigail:**
Oh, God... They're like the Devil himself!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I've got to rescue her!


---
 
**Abigail:**
...Master...!

 
**Abigail:**
Please, don't fight...
These people aren't strangers; I know all of them.

 
**Abigail:**
They're my community, just like Chaldea is yours.

 
**Abigail:**
They were all so kind.
If it hadn't been for those trials...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Maybe so, but I can't let them hurt you.
 
**Abigail:**
Ahh, Master...
My heart feels...heavy...

 
**Abigail:**
Master... You're a bad person.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
MothMephy!
 
**Mephistopheles:**
That's meee!
Are you sure about this?

 
**Mephistopheles:**
If you go about messing around with nightmares half-assed, they won't do what they're meant to!

 
**Mephistopheles:**
Oh! Ooh! Bloodlust! Indignation! Pity! It seems your determination is fierce indeed, [♂ Sir /♀️ Lady} Mage.

 


---
 
**Mephistopheles:**
Well then, if you're quite sure,
shall we get started!?

 
**Mephistopheles:**
As luck would have it, my darling little bombies have been positively itching for some action!

 
**Mephistopheles:**
Haha, hahaha, heeehahahahahaha!


**--BATTLE--:**

**Villager:**
Hissssss!

 
**Mephistopheles:**
My, oh my, they just keep on coming, don't they?
There doesn't seem to be any end to them.

 
**Abigail:**
Oh, everyone... I understand...

 
**Abigail:**
You want me to disappear entirely from your memories, don't you.

 
**Villager:**
LEAVE! BEGONE! GOD HAS FORSAKEN YOU!

 
**Abigail:**
None of them wants to admit that they enjoyed letting madness take hold of them...

 
**Abigail:**
...or that they let me fan the flames of everyone's insanity.

 
**Abigail:**
Fine, then. I'll sink as low as I have to.
I'll fall from grace forever and ever.

 
**Abigail:**
Madness is nothing new to us, after all.

 
**Abigail:**
Everyone has the urge to give their minds and bodies over to something bigger than themselves.

 
**Abigail:**
It was always right there, just waiting for a chance!
Anyone could have ended up like me!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
That's enough, Abigail!

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
You don't need to torture yourself anymore!


---
 
**Abigail:**
I want you to carve this in your soul,
so you never lose sight of it!

 
**Abigail:**
I am the witch of Salem!

 
**Abigail:**
...

 
**Abigail:**
...Are you feeling all right, Master?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...I'm...back in my room...

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Abby... I'm sorry. Did I wake you?


---
 
**Abigail:**
...Are you okay? You were moaning in your sleep, and you're sweating.

 
**Abigail:**
Here, I'll wipe off your forehead for you.
You just stay right there, okay?

 
**Abigail:**
...I'm so sorry. It's all my fault.
It wasn't supposed to be like this.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
(Does this mean Abby wasn't the one dreaming...?)

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
(Mephy's not here... Though I guess that makes sense...)


---
 
**Abigail:**
You're going to take a walk around Chaldea until you feel a little better?

 
**Abigail:**
Oooh... A midnight walk?

 
**Abigail:**
That sounds lovely.
Could I come with you?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
(It's so quiet here again...)

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
(It feels a little too quiet here. Almost like it's...deserted?)


---
 
**Abigail:**
It's such a quiet night...
Being up on a snowy mountain is really isolated, isn't it?

 
**Abigail:**
...Master, would you...hold my hand?
I don't want to trip in the dark.

 
**Abigail:**
Hehe... Please don't worry.
I won't depend on you THAT much.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You look like you're enjoying this, Abby.
**Abigail:**
Oh, I am!
It would be such a waste to sleep on a night like this.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
(It's like she's seeing Chaldea for the first time...)
 
**Abigail:**
Oh... You look sleepy, Hugo.
Are you having trouble staying awake?

 
**Abigail:**
Try to wake up!
The night is too much fun to waste sleeping.

 


---
 
**Abigail:**
So that's the kitchen, huh...
And...over there is the study?

 
**Abigail:**
So that's where the writers are making their stories even as we speak.

 
**Abigail:**
I wonder what sort of play they're working on? It would probably bother them if I went to see, wouldn't it?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
(We've gone all around Chaldea, and still haven't run into anyone.)

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
(Something strange is going on here...)


---
 
**Abigail:**
...

 
**Abigail:**
Say...[♂ Mr. /♀️ Ms.} Ringmaster?

 
**Abigail:**
Do you think Mash is already asleep?

 
**Abigail:**
I know she's a very good girl,
so I doubt she'd be up so late...

 
**Abigail:**
In fact...she'd probably be upset if she found out we were staying up this late...

 
**Abigail:**
...Still...

 
**Abigail:**
...would it be okay...to stay together a little longer?
Just the two of us?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
If that's what you want.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I think we can get away with that on a winter night.


---
 
**Abigail:**
Thank you...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
It's good to see you again, Abby.


---
 
**Abigail:**
...

 
**Abigail:**
...You too, [♂ Mr. /♀️ Ms.} Ringmaster.

 
**Abigail:**
I'm glad to see you're doing so well.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You're the Abigail from that Salem, aren't you?


---
 
**Abigail:**
...Yes. I am.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
What happened to Chaldea's Abigail?
 
**Abigail:**
...She's asleep.

 
**Abigail:**
I'm more like a hazy shadow than anything else.

 
**Abigail:**
I'm so sorry the version of me here in Chaldea has had to have such awful dreams.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Is this still a dream?
 
**Abigail:**
...What do you think, [♂ Mr. /♀️ Ms.} Ringmaster?

 
**Abigail:**
All I can say is, as long as I get to talk to you again,
I don't care if it's reality or a dream.

 


---
 
**Abigail:**
The truth is...I'm actually somewhere veeeeeery far away right now.

 
**Abigail:**
Someplace years...hundreds of light-years away...

 
**Abigail:**
It was only because of one tiny chance,
so many coincidences, and you thinking of me...

 
**Abigail:**
...that I'm finally able to be here in Chaldea right now.

 
**Abigail:**
My real self is still off on my journey...

 
**Abigail:**
I can only be here for a short time at night,
when the stars are aligned just right.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
It's a little overwhelming to see you again, but in a good way.
 
**Abigail:**
Really...? Teehee.

 
**Abigail:**
Then I guess it was worth sneaking away to come here when Uncle wasn't looking.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Well from now on, you're welcome to visit whenever you like.
 
**Abigail:**
...Thank you.
I hope I can again...

 


---
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
(...She reminds me of a lost kid worried about finding her parents.)

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
(So, the two Abbys connected through their shared dreams...?)


---
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...Have you been in touch with Lavinia at all?


---
 
**Abigail:**
...

 
**Abigail:**
...That's one reason I wanted to see you again,
[♂ Mr. /♀️ Ms.} Ringmaster. I wanted to talk about her with someone else who knew her.

 
**Abigail:**
And the only ones who still remember her...

 
**Abigail:**
...are you, Mash, and a few other of Chaldea's Servants.

 
**Abigail:**
Ahh... This won't do at all...

 
**Abigail:**
I thought, if I saw you again,
I could put these feelings out of my mind...

 
**Abigail:**
I thought that way, I could start putting one foot in front of the other again...

 
**Abigail:**
But it looks like...I'm a naughtier girl than I thought...

 
**Abigail:**
[♂ Mr. /♀️ Ms.} Ringmaster...?
Would you hold my hand...?

 
**Abigail:**
That's all I want...

 
**Abigail:**
So please...would you do that for me...?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
(Gently take her outstretched hand in yours)
 
**Abigail:**
...[♂ Mr. /♀️ Ms.} Ringmaster...

 
**Abigail:**
Thank you... Thank you...
You don't know how happy this makes me...

 
**Abigail:**
You're such a good person that...I was sure you would refuse...

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
(Quietly shake head)
 
**Abigail:**
...You won't...hold my hand?
You won't even touch me?

 
**Abigail:**
Is that because...I'm no longer the Abigail you know...?

 


---
 
**Abigail:**
...Ghh...!
...That hurts...

 
**Geronimo:**
...I stripped the curse away before it could eat away at her any further.

 
**Geronimo:**
I only wish I could have done so without hurting you or Abigail, Master. Forgive me.

 
**Abigail:**
Who are you...?

 
**Abigail:**
One of Chaldea's Servants... And by the looks of you...you must be one of the New World's native inhabitants...

 
**Geronimo:**
I am. My name is Geronimo. And you are a girl who has layered your soul upon Abigail's body.

 
**Geronimo:**
That inhibitor you are experiencing comes from an asabikeshiinh, also known as a dreamcatcher.

 
**Geronimo:**
It originates with the Ojibwe tribe, but I know how it works well enough to make my own in Chaldea's workshop.

 
**Abigail:**
You laid this trap that far in advance...?

 
**Abigail:**
Right...of course you did. Chaldea does have more than its fair share of cunning tacticians.

 
**Abigail:**
...There's another one of you here?

 
**Nezha:**
...Abby.

 
**Abigail:**
Nezha...
...You?

 
**Nezha:**
...Yes. Long time. No see. Abby.

 
**Nezha:**
I had Geronimo. And. Gilles de Rais.
Add me. To Master's. Security detail.

 
**Nezha:**
Mash. And Mata Hari. Were also.
Prepared for. The threat. From the stars.

 
**Nezha:**
Geronimo and. I were. In charge.
Of the. Gate of sleep.

 
**Nezha:**
Indeed. This. Is a dream. My true body.
And Geronimo's. Are still. In our beds.

 
**Nezha:**
I greatly. Admire your. Trick in. Bridging your.
World and. Chaldea's own. Through dreams.

 
**Nezha:**
I applaud. How much. Your skills. Have grown!

 
**Nezha:**
However! As Marshal. Of the Central Altar. I cannot.
Let you pass. Beyond. My Fire-tipped spear!

 
**Nezha:**
...I wish. Our reunion. Could have.
Been under. Different circumstances.

 
**Abigail:**
Yes... This is hard for me, too...

 
**Abigail:**
But I can't give up now...  Tonight...is probably my last chance.

 
**Abigail:**
[♂ Mr. /♀️ Ms.} Ringmaster will soon be leaving on another journey...

 
**Abigail:**
A long, long journey to the rift between the cosmos and the void... Somewhere even I won't be able to reach...

 
**Nezha:**
Abby. You are. My very. Best friend.
So I. Cannot let. You get. Away with. This.

 
**Nezha:**
If you. Insist on. Making this. Mistake. I will.
Risk my life to. Cut you. Off. At the root!

 
**Abigail:**
...Teehee. That's right.
That is what you would do, isn't it?

 
**Abigail:**
I love you, Nezha.

 
**Nezha:**
...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Oh, no. Abby and Nezha are getting ready to fight!


---
 
**Geronimo:**
Nezha is prepared to do what she must.
Is that all right with you, friend?

 
**Geronimo:**
Do you wish to join the fray yourself?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Sometimes, the kindest thing you can do for someone is be harsh.
 
**Geronimo:**
...Indeed. And it would seem now is one such time.

 
**Geronimo:**
Very well, if tough love is what is called for here,
I shall do my best to help provide it.

 
**Geronimo:**
...Though I know this treatment will be painful for you as well.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Be careful not to hurt Chaldea's Abigail.
 
**Geronimo:**
Easier said than done! That is an extremely difficult task, especially in this particular dreamspace.

 
**Geronimo:**
Still...I share your desire to see her safely returned to us.

 
**Geronimo:**
So I will see that it is so.

 


---

**--BATTLE--:**

**Nezha:**
...Abby! Stop this!

 
**Abigail:**
I won't let you escape...
You're not going anywhere...

 
**Abigail:**
The more you back me into a corner, the deeper into you my bonds sink, and the more they will ensnare you, [♂ Mr. /♀️ Ms.} Ringmaster.

 
**Abigail:**
Soon, I shall pull you in towards me.

 
**Abigail:**
Now...open, gate...

 
**Nezha:**
Abby!

 
**Geronimo:**
Damn... She's brought in more foes!


**--BATTLE--:**

**Geronimo:**
That takes care of all the monsters we can see...but now, Abigail is gone.

 
**Nezha:**
She fled. Deeper into the base!

 
**Nezha:**
I will pursue!

 
**Geronimo:**
What about them?

 
**Nezha:**
I will not. Let. These ghouls. Have their way!
I will wipe them out. Before. They run rampant!

 
**Geronimo:**
Wait. We must not let them overwhelm us.
Remember, this is only a dream.

 
**Geronimo:**
We may both be fighting for control, but this other Abigail still holds most of the cards.

 
**Geronimo:**
These last battles have shown me that even the time we spend here is uncertain.

 
**Nezha:**
That means. We should. Tell. The others. And call for. More help. Who shall. Return to. Reality?

 
**Nezha:**
We can. Expect that. More ghouls. Await us.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...Wait.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Please let me handle this by myself.


---
 
**Nezha:**
...What!? Master. Have you. Gone mad!?

 
**Geronimo:**
...Can you tell us why?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I want to talk Abby down from this myself.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
We're not the only ones who're scrambling here.


---
 
**Geronimo:**
...

 
**Nezha:**
...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...I think there's something Abby still needs.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Abby's not quite like other Servants.


---
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Sometimes, people get so distraught they don't know what to do.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Sometimes, people need help, but don't know how to ask for it.


---
 
**Geronimo:**
In other words...you think the Abigail from Salem...

 
**Geronimo:**
...and the one here at Chaldea are still growing up, do you?

 
**Geronimo:**
...You do have a point. I'm sure it is no coincidence that she manifested here as the same sensitive girl she was during the chaos of the witch trials.

 
**Geronimo:**
Servant or not, this summoning karma is a cruel burden for anyone to bear.

 
**Nezha:**
If you. Ask me. It is. A fall. From grace.

 
**Nezha:**
Neither growth. Nor sublimation. But a fall.
She is. Indulging in. Her own. Inner wickedness.

 
**Nezha:**
As a. Foreigner class. She is. Very dangerous. She is. Attracted to. The evil. In the. Endless abyss.

 
**Nezha:**
We need. To keep. An eye. On her. At all times to.
Ensure she. Does not. Spiral. Out of control.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I think she's just lost right now.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Blaming her for not doing the right thing isn't going to help right now.


---
 
**Nezha:**
...

 
**Geronimo:**
...Now I understand, my friend. You will provide the weary traveler with shelter and respite.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
That's giving me too much credit.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I don't know about that, but I will do my best to cheer her up.


---
 
**Geronimo:**
...Very well. If that is what you want,
Master, I will not interfere.

 
**Nezha:**
What!? So you. You mean. Both of. Us will.
Leave Master. Alone in. This dream?

 
**Geronimo:**
If our goal is to have Abigail let her guard down, I think that it is a better option than for me to chase after her, weapon in hand.

 
**Geronimo:**
Besides, I am not the one who saved her in Salem.
That was you and Master, Nezha.

 
**Nezha:**
...Considering... Understood.
I agree. Though reluctantly.

 
**Nezha:**
But if. Something seems. Wrong in.
Any way. I will. Return immediately.

 
**Nezha:**
Master. Take care. Of Abby.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I will. Tell everyone else thanks for me.


---
 
**Geronimo & Nezha:**
(Nod)


**--ARROW--:**


---

**Fujimaru 1:**
(I'm not hearing any more of those monster howls...)

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
(It's so quiet now...)


---
 
**???:**
...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I can hear someone weeping...


---
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...It's coming from the real Abby's room.


---
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
(Quietly call her name through the door)
 
**???:**
...That's you, isn't it,  Ringmaster...

 
**???:**
...Please come in. You already have a key.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
(Lean back on the door and wait)
**???:**
...

 
**???:**
...

 
**???:**
Please come in.
I promise I won't run away anymore...

 


---
 
**Abigail:**
... Ringmaster...

 
**Abigail:**
It... It wasn't...supposed to be like this...

 
**Abigail:**
I never wanted to hurt Nezha,
or any of your other friends...

 
**Abigail:**
I'm s-so sorry...
But don't worry. I'll disappear soon...

 
**Abigail:**
...Please...let me stay?
Just...just until the celestial gate closes?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
(Sit on the edge of the bed where she's curled up)
 
**Abigail:**
...I'm so embarrassed at how childish I've been acting.

 
**Abigail:**
I wanted to greet you again as a proper lady...

 
**Abigail:**
I'm so ashamed... I don't know how I'll ever be able to face Mash, or Uncle...

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
(Offer her pancakes)
 
**Abigail:**
...O-oh my. These look wonderful.

 
**Abigail:**
They're more like pastries then a meal.

 
**Abigail:**
I envy the version of me at Chaldea if she gets to eat these regularly.

 
**Abigail:**
Thank you for remembering how much I like pancakes,
 Ringmaster...

 
**Abigail:**
But I'll pass on them for now. I don't need to spoil myself any more than I already have...

 


---
 
**Abigail:**
...

 
**Abigail:**
I...

 
**Abigail:**
I wish I could see Lavinia again.
I miss her so much...

 
**Abigail:**
I want to hear her voice again... To sit side by side in front of a campfire, looking up at the stars...

 
**Abigail:**
But...I can't ever make that happen again...

 
**Abigail:**
No matter how many doors I open, I can never go back to that place I remember so fondly.

 
**Abigail:**
...Uncle did tell me there was a way there.

 
**Abigail:**
But...he also said that if I'm truly going to see Lavinia Whateley again, it would probably happen at a time when I'm no longer me anymore...

 
**Abigail:**
That, more than just wielding the silver key's power...I would be like the guardian deity for the gate of time and space.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
(Sounds like an even higher dimension of travel than Rayshifting...)

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
(Sounds like she'd be capable of changing history at that point...)


---
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...Are you enjoying your journey?
 
**Abigail:**
...

 
**Abigail:**
...Yes, I am.

 
**Abigail:**
Even you might be surprised by how many adventures we've had, and how many amazing things I've seen.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I guess your uncle's not gonna be too happy about this, is he?
 
**Abigail:**
...

 
**Abigail:**
...No, he's not.

 


---
 
**Abigail:**
Right now...my real body is in a huge,
ancient library on a distant planet.

 
**Abigail:**
It's got lots of books about all sorts of stars.
It has enough about the old Earth to fill an entire wall.

 
**Abigail:**
Lavinia would have loved it there.
She always did love to read.

 
**Abigail:**
...

 
**Abigail:**
Um...is the version of me in Chaldea being...helpful?

 
**Abigail:**
I hope she's not...making life harder for you...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
She's just as capable as any other Chaldean now.
 
**Abigail:**
Really...?

 
**Abigail:**
Then she was able to become a proper Servant?
She must have worked so hard.

 
**Abigail:**
Then, um...could you maybe praise her...even just once every month or so...?

 
**Abigail:**
I-if you praised her every day,
she'd get so overcome she'd just pass out.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
She was a little unsure of herself, but she adjusted in no time.
 
**Abigail:**
Is that so...

 
**Abigail:**
That makes me so happy.
I'm sure she has you and Mash to thank for it.

 
**Abigail:**
Along with...um...was it Geronimo?
I should apologize to him, too...

 


---
 
**Abigail:**
And...has she made any friends?
No, wait...I can tell.

 
**Abigail:**
I can feel the trust that all of your companions place in her radiating through this Spirit Origin I, uh, borrowed.

 
**Abigail:**
It wouldn't even be possible for me to be here talking to you like this without permission from the version of me here in Chaldea.

 
**Abigail:**
I'm so sorry...

 
**Abigail:**
I've definitely overstayed any welcome I might have had. I'd better be on my way.

 
**Abigail:**
Besides, I need to give you back to everyone who's worried about you. Along with this body, of course.

 
**Abigail:**
... Ringmaster...?

 
**Abigail:**
...Are you okay?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...


---
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...There's someone I miss, too.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I'd do anything to see the person I miss again.


---
 
**Abigail:**
...Yeah.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
But...I'm the last Master of Chaldea.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
When I do see them, I want to be able to hold my head high...


---
 
**Abigail:**
...Yeah.

 
**Abigail:**
... Ringmaster?

 
**Abigail:**
...It's okay to cry.

 
**Abigail:**
It's always okay to cry. If you need a shoulder...I'd be happy to lend you mine...

 
**Abigail:**
That should help you feel a little less lonely.
So...

 
**Abigail:**
...You know,  Ringmaster...

 
**Abigail:**
...I wish I could have called you “Master,” even just once...

 
**Abigail:**
Farewell...
And please, take good care of Abby for me.

 
**Narration:**
“I can't believe it. They b-both literally cried themselves to sleep...”

 
**Narration:**
“Th-they couldn't escape their responsibilities,
even in a dream...”

 
**Narration:**
“...A...”

 
**Narration:**
“A-Abby... Poor thing...”

 
**Narration:**
“I wish I could do something for her...
B-but I can't...”

 
**Narration:**
“I...I can't even w-wipe the tears...from her cheeks...”

 
“...No. I'm afraid not.”

 
“We are no more than illusions that will disappear after tonight.”

 
“Mere projections of the fleeting hopes they harbor in their dreams.”

 
“Y-yes...I know. But, even so...”

 
“I...I still care for you...Abby.”

 
“I-I may j-just be a few words...written on a f-few pages of script...”

 
“...but the bond you and I shared was real...”

 
“As long as you remain you...I'll be...right here, too...”

 
“I'll never forget...how w-warm your fingers were when you combed my hair...”

 
“A black cat...? Where'd it come from?”

 
“...I certainly don't remember...there being any cats at Chaldea...”

 
“Maybe it's someone's familiar...”
“...No, wait...”

 
“O-oh...wow... It's real. It must be able to travel between dreams and reality at will.”

 
“...All cats can do that.”

 
“...Ah...”

 
**???:**
...Phew.

 
**???:**
I can't believe she projected her mind all the way out here. That girl's just full of surprises.

 
**???:**
I would have gotten lost on the way here if my friend hadn't shown me the way.

 
**???:**
Hmm... It looks like I'm either too late,
or things have already wrapped up neatly...

 
“...Carter.”

 
“...You must be here to pick up Abigail.”

 
**Cosmic-Traveling Gentleman:**
...Indeed I am.

 
**Cosmic-Traveling Gentleman:**
I'll have to bring her back without waking her,
since she only just fell asleep.

 
**Narration:**
“Y-yes. Please do that...”

 
**Narration:**
“...C-Carter? Can I ask you something...?”

 
**Cosmic-Traveling Gentleman:**
...Of course.

 
**Cosmic-Traveling Gentleman:**
But do make it quick, if you don't mind. We don't have long before the stars shift out of alignment.

 
**Narration:**
“A-Abby's a priestess...for the outer god with the power of...the silver key...”

 
**Narration:**
“She's a m-miracle who will one day awaken from her rosy slumber...and become the ultimate gate...”

 
**Narration:**
“She's also a threat...like a v-valve sealing the hull...of the boat th-that is the world...”

 
**Narration:**
“In which case...”

 
**Narration:**
“...is that ancient one standing at...the mouth of the well Abby's d-destined form...?”

 
**Narration:**
“Or is she...doomed to become one w-with my outer god...?”

 
**Cosmic-Traveling Gentleman:**
Hmm...

 
**Cosmic-Traveling Gentleman:**
Well, as I told the Chaldeans,
that all depends on Abby.

 
**Cosmic-Traveling Gentleman:**
Not to say that I don't have my own part to play, of course.

 
**Cosmic-Traveling Gentleman:**
It is incumbent on me to make sure she retains her heart and stays a friend of humanity, no matter how far she may travel.

 
**Cosmic-Traveling Gentleman:**
Then she'll keep dreaming about those she cares for, like you two, even if you're only ephemeral concepts.

 
“...Hmm. All right.”

 
“I see...”

 
“Even as [♂ he's /♀️ she's} suffering devastating injuries while fighting for humanity's survival from the pits of hell...”

 
“...my Master is doing [♂ his /♀️ her} best not to lose sight of [♂ himself /♀️ herself}...”

 
“And that's why [♂ he /♀️ she} needs memories that remind [♂ him /♀️ her} of what it means to be human. Sometimes, that means [♂ he'll /♀️ she'll} need warm, therapeutic dreams.”

 
“Huh... That sounds like something a musician would say, now that I hear it spoken aloud.”

 
“At any rate...that goes for you, too.”

 
“...Huh...? Me...?”

 
“You shouldn't be shy about asking the person you love for what you want, especially in a dream of all places.”

 
“That's a privilege only afforded to young ladies, after all.”

 
“I... S-stop it...
I'm...just a concept, right...?”

 
“I...I swear...you're still...s-such an idiot...”

 
**Narration:**
　　　　　　　　　Next Day – Elevenses 
 
**Robin Hood:**
...Sounds like one helluva dream.
But hey, we all have weird dreams from time to time.

 
**Robin Hood:**
Not to mention we had clear skies last night for the first time in friggin' forever. No surprise you might've had a dream or two as a result.

 
**Robin Hood:**
I mean, the nicer the weather is,
the better you feel, yeah?

 
**Sanson:**
...There was also an unusual security detail last night.

 
**Robin Hood:**
There was, wasn't there. I did a shift for it myself, but luckily, we didn't run into any trouble.

 
**Abigail:**
...Oh my, is that true...?

 
**Abigail:**
I slept so soundly last night... I had no idea!

 
**Abigail:**
I think I went and visited Master's room at some point...but when I woke up, I was back in my own...

 
**Sanson:**
What did you dream about, Abby?
If you don't mind, I'd love to hear about it.

 
**Abigail:**
...Okay. If you insist.

 
**Abigail:**
I'm afraid I don't remember it all that clearly, but...

 
**Abigail:**
...I dreamed I saw my old friend,
from the village I grew up in.

 
**Sanson:**
The village you grew up in, hm?
Oh, I presume you mean Salem?

 
**Robin Hood:**
...

 
**Abigail:**
...Yes, that's right.

 
**Abigail:**
She was a beautiful girl, with long, pure white hair.

 
**Abigail:**
I, um, can't seem to remember much else about her...

 
**Abigail:**
...but I still remember the mystical aura she had.
She was like a fairy who came from the stars.

 
**Abigail:**
I think, maybe...we might even have been best friends.

 
**Robin Hood:**
...Yeah. I'm sure you were.

 
**Robin Hood:**
The kind of pals who'd hide frogs in each other's teacups, or have horse shit fights out in the fields.

 
**Abigail:**
R-Robin! Don't say bad words like that!
Of course we'd never do that sort of thing.

 
**Abigail:**
I told you, we were both well-behaved young girls.
We'd go to church together on Sundays...

 
**Abigail:**
...spell our names using the shells we found at the seashore...

 
**Abigail:**
...or sew quilts and just talk to each other in our secret hideout...

 
**Abigail:**
I think that's the sort of friendship we had...

 
**Robin Hood:**
...Right, of course. Thanks for the tea.

 
**Narration:**
“...And then it was over. Just like a dream...”
